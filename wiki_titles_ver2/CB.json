        "text": "Stephen Cooper (born June 19, 1979) is a former American football linebacker for the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Maine. He was signed by the San Diego Chargers as an undrafted free agent in 2003, and played his entire professional career for the Chargers.\nCollege career.\nCooper verbally committed to attend the U.S. Naval Academy but transferred closer to home at the University of Maine to try and earn a scholarship. In an interview with Tom Shanahan, Cooper said his decision was a family one. \"We weren't really thinking about professional football,\" Cooper said, \"We were thinking about a job after college, and if you go to the Naval Academy, you're not going to get turned away for a job.\" Because his high school coach and Maine Black Bears football head coach Jack Cosgrove played together in college, Cooper was offered a scholarship and became an instant star. Cooper earned Maine's Roger Ellis Rookie of Year Award his freshman year in 1999. As a junior, Cooper earned Atlantic-10 Co-Defensive Player of Year. During his senior year, Cooper racked up Atlantic-10 Conference Defensive Player of Year in 2002, the George H. \"Bulger\" Lowe award from the Gridiron Club of Greater Boston as the top defensive football player in New England, and was named a 1st Team Defense 2002 Associated Press NCAA Division I-AA Football All-American. He was also an American Football Coaches Association and Sports Network All-American as well.\nIn a game against Appalachian State, Cooper was named an I-AA All Star where he \"turned the game around late in the third quarter, forcing ASU quarterback Joe Burchette into an interception with Maine trailing 10-0. The Black Bears scored two plays later and pulled out a 14-13 win. Cooper had 13 tackles, three solo and 10 assisted, three tackles for 15 yards of losses and two quarterback sacks for 14 yards of losses.\" Throughout his college career spanning four years from 1999–2002, Cooper finished with 374 tackles, 57 tackles for loss, seven interceptions and 25 sacks.\n2002 steroid possession.\nA week after being named the top defensive player in New England, Cooper was caught with possession of about 1,000 steroid pills on November 1, 2002. He was riding in a car that was speeding on I-95 in Hampden, Maine. The driver, Patrick Kenney, allowed Trooper Michael Johnson to search the car in which he found the pills in a duffel bag sitting on the rear seat. Cooper was not penalized for participation of any games during his senior year as possession of steroids did not violate NCAA rules. A New York Times report stated \"NCAA spokeswoman, Laronica L. Conway, said the illegal possession of steroids was an issue for the institution to resolve. There is no violation of NCAA bylaws unless a player is accused of actually ingesting the pills, not simply possessing them, she said from the association's headquarters in Indianapolis.\"\nThe University of Maine star pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of steroids. Cooper was released following his plea to the misdemeanor offense, and issued a statement saying he had planned not to use the drugs.\nProfessional career.\nThe San Diego Chargers signed Cooper as an undrafted free agent on May 2, 2003. He played in mostly a backup role for his first 4 years before his breakout season in 2007 when he started all 16 games and recorded a career high 107 tackles. The following two seasons were also productive totaling 201 tackles and starting 28 games. He was placed on IR on December 31, 2010 after playing 12 games (11 starts) and recording 43 tackles during the 2010 season. He played 5 more games the following year before another injury cut his season short, being placed on IR on October 12, 2011. He would spend his entire 9 season career in San Diego recording 503 tackles, 9.5 sacks, and 8 interceptions in 125 games. He also recorded 68 tackles, 0.5 sack, and 2 passes defended in 8 playoff games for the Chargers."

        "title": "Guelph Royals (baseball)",
        "text": "The Guelph Royals are a baseball team based in the downtown area of Guelph, Ontario, and are a member of the Southern Ontario-based Intercounty Baseball League. The club was founded in 1861 as the Guelph Maple Leafs, and after winning the \"Canadian Silver Ball Championship\" three times between 1869 and 1872, went on to become world semi-professional champions in 1874, and hold brief membership in the International Association for Professional Base Ball Players during the 1877 season, rivalling National League teams.\nIn 1919, they joined the Intercounty Baseball League, and underwent a series of name changes (the Guelph-Waterloo Royals in 1954; the Guelph Plymouths in 1957; the Guelph Merchants in 1958; the Guelph Royals in 1962; the Guelph CJOYs in 1964) before being officially renamed the \"Royals\". From 1861 to 1925, the team divided its home games between various ballparks in the city, before the construction of a stadium in Exhibition Park led them to permanently play there.\nIn 1986, they moved into a new stadium, David E. Hastings Stadium, also in Exhibition Park. In spite of only winning one Intercounty championship between 1932 and 1993, the team has done well in some subsequent years. However, a May 2018 news item stated that \"the Royals haven’t been above .500 since 2012 and haven't won a league title since 2004\". The team folded in 2017 but was re-started under new owners in 2018.\nHistory.\nA. S. Feast, George Sleeman, and the Guelph Maple Leafs (1861–1873).\nIn 1861, baseball enthusiast A. S. Feast moved from Hamilton, Ontario to Guelph, and – being a professed fan of the Hamilton Maple Leafs, whose name was derived from the nascent national symbol – founded a new, semi-professional club, the \"Guelph Maple Leafs\", in order to take advantage of the high popularity of the sport in 19th-century Southwestern Ontario. The Maple Leafs began play the summer of that year, and their first game wound up a 27-27 tie against a club from Flamborough, Ontario, as the umpires were unsure whether it would be permissible to continue the game beyond nine innings.\nUnder the guidance of Feast, and helped by the substantial amount of talent in the region, the Maple Leafs soon became one of the most promising baseball clubs in Canada, and, in 1865, nearly defeated the Woodstock Young Canadians to win the \"Canadian Silver Ball Championship\" – a loosely-knit tournament in which Canadian teams of the time participated – losing 36-29 in a tumultuous final wherein Guelph players endured threats of physical violence from the audience. During this time, Maple Leafs games frequently attracted attendance in the thousands, owing partly to a high-profile rivalry with the London Tecumsehs, which had caused a schism in the Southwestern Ontario baseball community.\nBy 1869, the Maple Leafs succeeded in winning the Canadian Silver Ball Championship, and proceeded to do so repeatedly until 1871, when they were granted permanent possession of the coveted Silver Ball Trophy. Their status as Canadian champions quickly attracted the attention of George Sleeman, local owner of Silver Creek Brewery, who purchased the team then merged it with one he already owned, the Silver Creek Baseball Club, and began funding the aggressive acquisition of American players, including Pete Gillespie, Scott Hastings, and a new pitcher, William Smith. The Maple Leafs' high-profile acquisitions represented a first for Canadian baseball, and other clubs in the region soon followed suit.\nThe Maple Leafs' prestige increased significantly due to victories accumulated by their strengthened roster, and on July 1, 1873, the Boston Red Stockings, defending National Association champions, played an exhibition game in Guelph in front of an audience of over 10,000 and won 27-8. The match is fictionalized by legendary Western writer Zane Grey – whose brother, Reddy Grey, played for the Boston Red Stockings at the time they competed against the Maple Leafs – in his short story published in 1920, \"The Winning Ball\", in which Guelph defeats a professional team from Rochester in spite of the opposing team's use of the \"rabbit\", a baseball made when a friend of the manager's \"removed the covers from a number of league balls and sewed them on rubber balls of his own making\".\nWorld semi-professional champions, on hiatus (1874–1895).\nIn 1874, George Sleeman received word of a world semi-professional championship being hosted in Watertown, New York, and – thinking the Maple Leafs had a shot – began readying the team. His hopes were validated later that year when a virtuoso performance by pitcher William Smith led the Maple Leafs to three straight victories over some of the best clubs in North America, including a 13-4 trouncing of a Ku Klux Klan team from Oneida, New York. Guelph's victory in this tournament bolstered their international reputation considerably, and may represent the zenith of the franchise's success.\nThe mid-late 1870s brought with them new challenges for the Maple Leafs. In 1875, London, England-born entrepreneur and oil refiner Jacob L. Englehart purchased the London Tecumsehs, and their subsequent acquisition of star pitcher and future Chicago White Stocking Fred Goldsmith, along with catcher Phil Powers and fielder Joe Hornung, challenged Guelph's status as the foremost Canadian baseball club. On May 24, 1876, in front of 6,000 fans in London, the London Tecumsehs finally succeeded in defeating the Maple Leafs 8-7 in ten innings for the Canadian championship, largely owing to Fred Goldsmith's \"scientific pitching\", which made use of his innovative \"skew ball\". Later that year, both teams became charter entrants in the Canadian Association of Base Ball, which was co-organized by George Sleeman, and played for only a few months before closing.\nThe Maple Leafs' exit from the Canadian Association of Base Ball left them without a formal league to play in, and this, coupled with the necessity of holding membership in one in order to field a competitive professional or semi-professional team in the post-National Association of Professional Base Ball Players era caused them to begin searching aggressively. During this period, in late 1876, the St. Louis Brown Stockings – a successful team in the upstart National League, and the antecedents of the modern-day St. Louis Cardinals – travelled to Guelph to play an exhibition match, and were defeated resoundingly. \nThe club's lack of a competitive league to play in was resolved in 1877, when they, along with the London Tecumsehs, both joined the semi-professional International Association for Professional Base Ball Players, which featured both American and Canadian teams, and positioned itself as a rival to the increasingly dominant National League. The Maple Leafs' first season of play, however, was less than successful, as they went 4-12, second lowest in the league only to the subsequently disbanded Lynn Live Oaks, and at cessation withdrew from it. The London Tecumsehs played on for the following season, but closed their doors at its conclusion in 1878, citing a shortage of funds.\nIn the 1880s, the Maple Leafs continued to play at a high level locally, but increased player salaries, coupled with the club's lack of a strong league affiliation, meant baseball in Guelph had begun to flounder. Worsening matters was the team's releasing of key prospect Bud Fowler – a marquee pitcher, and the first ever African-American to play professionally – to the Petrolia Imperials, due to racial discomfort, as well as George Sleeman's lessened involvement in the club's affairs due to the relinquishing of his business assets to his son. In 1886, a promising Maple Leafs team – featuring the likes of Lou Bierbauer, George Bradley, Mike Jones and Ed Kent – lost money, and was placed on hiatus.\nInto the Intercounty League, out of limbo (1896–1932).\nAfter an extended lull, the Maple Leafs regained their footing in 1896, when a new-look team featuring third baseman Jim Cockman and right fielder Bunk Congalton finished the season in a reorganized Canadian League with a .667 record. The following three seasons were less successful, as the Maple Leafs consistently ranked between .400 and .500, however, they did manage to acquire several excellent players, including Babe Doty and Joe Kostal.\nBaseball had its ups and downs until 1919 – the Maple Leafs defeated the St. Louis Browns in an exhibition match in 1876 and in 1894, under a new board of officers, won the semi-pro championship of Canada – when the Inter-County League was established.\nGuelph beat Galt for the Inter-County title the first three years of the new league then had the roles reversed the next three. All told, Royal City teams won four league titles and were runners-up six times before the Second World War.\nIn 1932, the Guelph Maple Leafs won the Ontario Baseball Association senior title. It was the only time in Guelph history that happened.\nProfessional baseball came to Guelph in 1911, when a Canadian league was formed by George 'Knotty' Lee. Guelph teams played a total of four seasons.\nIn 1930 Lee brought pro ball back to Guelph with the Biltmores, who played in the Class D Ontario League along with teams from London, St. Thomas, Brantford, Hamilton and St. Catharines. Jim O'Connor, who was the Inter-County batting champion in 1928, was the only local player to make the Biltmores.\nIn July of that year, just two months after the league began, it folded. St. Catharines, the top team in the league, started the trend on July 21 and the rest of the teams followed suit the next day.\nFor the next 30 years, Guelph's Inter-County team went through an extended dry spell. The Guelph Royals won the regular-season pennant in 1962 but the Brantford Red Sox went on to take the playoff title.\nThe Guelph C-Joys won back-to-back pennants starting in 1966 but didn't break through to win in the playoffs until 1970.\nThat was the last playoff victory for the local franchise until the Guelph Royals won the 1993 championship.\nThe Royals also won the 1997 Inter-County title and lost in the league final on two other occasions, including an infamous ninth-inning collapse that gave the Stratford Hillers the 1994 crown.\nA number of Guelph players have gone on to the pro ranks during the city's history.\nAs of 2015, three Guelphites were playing professionally. Jeremy Ware spent seven seasons in the Montreal Expos organization before moving to the Cleveland Indians earlier this year while Shawn Pearson (Toronto Blue Jays) and Jamie Pogue (St. Louis Cardinals) are also playing in the minor leagues. Notable players are Mark Shepherd. Shepherd who was a promising left handed power hitter from Oakville. Other notable achievements. Chris Robinson, catcher for Morehead State University, who played two seasons with the Royals, was named to the NCAA DI, First Team All American team in 2015.\nFolding and re-starting (2017).\nIn the 2017 season, Guelph was 1-15 after 16 games and they pulled out for the rest of the season The club subsequently folded but was re-started under a new owner, Shawn Fuller and Guelph mayor Cam Guthrie in September 2017. Former owner Jim Rooney was unable to attend the press conference. Fuller said that he would give up the non-profit status and run the team as a corporation.\nThe Royals fielded a new team for the 2018 season, including five players imported from the Dominican Republic, including Angel Villalona a former top San Francisco Giants prospect.\n The Royals were eliminated from the playoffs on 13 August 2018 when they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs (semi-pro baseball) team. During the 2019 season and 2022 seasons, the team was eliminated from the playoffs after losing to the Hamilton Cardinals."

        "text": "The Pakistan national cricket team toured England in 2006 for a four-match Test series, a five-match One Day International series and a single Twenty20 International. After a drawn first Test, England won the next two matches before being awarded the final match in controversial circumstances; on the fourth day, Pakistan's players were penalised for ball tampering and refused to resume play after the tea interval, leading the umpires to award England the match and a 3–0 series victory. In 2008, the ICC controversially declared the result of the final Test as a draw, altering the scoreline to 2–0; however, after criticism, not least by the MCC, this was subsequently reversed in February 2009 and the result restored as an England victory.\nBackground.\nEngland had toured Pakistan the previous winter, with Pakistan winning the three-match Test series 2–0 and the five-match ODI series 3–2. As a result of the Test series, Pakistan rose two spots in the world Test rankings to be ranked second going into the return tour, and England dropped to third after the 12 July annual update of the ICC Test Championship.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nEngland made an opening stand 60 runs before losing their first two wickets in quick succession, as Marcus Trescothick fell, followed an over later by captain Andrew Strauss. Kevin Pietersen was the next man out, adding just 28 runs for the third wicket, but Alastair Cook and Paul Collingwood both reached centuries on the way to a fourth-wicket partnership of 233 runs before Cook was out for 105. Collingwood top-scored in the innings with 186, and Ian Bell also managed an unbeaten 100 before England immediately declared on 528/9 with half a session left in the second day's play.\nSteve Harmison took two wickets in three balls before the close of play, helping England reduce Pakistan to 68/4 early on the third day; however, Mohammad Yousuf and captain Inzamam-ul-Haq added 173 runs for the fifth wicket, and Kamran Akmal also made a half-century, reaching 58 before he was caught behind off the bowling of Kevin Pietersen. Despite partners falling around him, Mohammad Yousuf managed to bat on to a double-century before he was caught behind off Harmison to close the innings – Harmison finished with figures of 4/94.\nEngland began the process of building on their 83-run lead early on the fourth day, but Strauss' 128 was the only notable score as they amassed 296 runs before declaring early on the final day, giving Pakistan a target of 380 to chase in 73 overs. Salman Butt fell to the first ball of the innings from Hoggard, followed by Imran Farhat to leave the tourists at 33/2; however, scores of 48 from Faisal Iqbal and Mohammad Yousuf got them to 141/4, before Inzamam-ul-Haq and Abdul Razzaq batted out the last session for 73 to secure a draw.\n2nd Test.\nWith Inzamam-ul-Haq's run of half-centuries against England finally stopped, as he was caught by Kevin Pietersen off Steve Harmison's bowling for a duck, England recorded an innings victory over Pakistan to take a 1–0 lead into the third Test. In the first innings, Pakistan lost the last eight wickets for 29 to post 119 with no batsmen making a half-century; England surpassed that score for the loss of two wickets, and with Alastair Cook and Ian Bell both making hundreds (127 and 106* respectively), England could eventually declare near the end of day two having made 461. It took England 63 overs to clean up, with Harmison and Monty Panesar sharing the ten wickets evenly (the only wicket takers in both innings) with the help of wicket keeper Geraint Jones, who caught five despite his fractured finger. Panesar took his second five-wicket-haul in three months, and was praised by opposition coach Bob Woolmer.\n3rd Test.\nAfter their innings defeat in the second test, Pakistan dropped Shahid Afridi and Abdul Razzaq, and had to swap Imran Farhat out due to injury. They brought in Salman Butt and Taufeeq Umar to open the innings, plus the bowling of Shahid Nazir. England only made one change, which was to swap the struggling wicketkeeper Geraint Jones for Chris Read. The wicketkeeper position had been the subject of much debate. Read was perceived as the better keeper, although Jones' batting skills were considered to be superior. However, Jones had not scored a significant innings for some time and Read was given an opportunity to impress for the first time since the West Indies tour of 2004.\nThe first day of the test prompted some interesting incidents as England won the toss and batted first. In the morning, there were three rogue decisions from the umpires (who had been testing the use of earpieces to communicate with off-field officials); in the afternoon Kevin Pietersen left the field in bizarre circumstances, and Pakistan responded with 11 overs of very mediocre bowling, using their opening batsmen to bowl during the period before the second new ball was due.\nIn amongst all this, Pietersen scored his 5th test century, and helped propel England to 347/6 by the end of the day. England continued on day 2, with Ian Bell posting his third consecutive test century, and the lower order added useful runs before England were bowled out for 515.\nPakistan's openers once again struggled, and they fell quickly to leave the tourists on 36/2. However, the experienced combination of Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf then combined to produce the largest partnership for Pakistan against England of 363 for the third wicket. They batted well into the afternoon session of the third day, before Yousuf gloved Stephen Harmison through to the keeper having scored 192.\nPakistan then lost some of their advantage in a bizarre passage of play leading up to the tea interval. Younis was run out on 173, Faisal Iqbal fell lbw to his first delivery faced (giving Paul Collingwood his first test wicket), and Inzamam-ul-Haq lost his wicket in a comical way, overbalancing while attempting to sweep a Monty Panesar delivery and falling onto his stumps.\nThe lower order batsmen tried to accelerate the scoring, but lost regular wickets in the process, and Pakistan were finally bowled out for 538.\nEngland's second innings started well, with the openers putting on 158 for the first wicket. Andrew Strauss went on to score 116, and Chris Read scored 55 down the order, but the other wickets fell quite regularly as England attempted to set up a position where they could push for a win on the final day. Pakistan's bowling attack shared the wickets between them, and eventually bowled England out for 345. Pakistan needed 323 runs on the final day to win.\nEngland's bowlers performed well on the final day, and took 5 wickets in the first session ensuring the 323 run target was well out of Pakistan's reach. The run out of Mohammad Yousuf for a single figure score was a key moment in the innings – in fact, Pakistan lost 3 of their top order batsmen to run outs during the game. Sajid Mahmood struck twice in an over shortly before lunch to remove Faisal Iqbal and Kamran Akmal, and would go on to record test best figures of 4/22.\nMonty Panesar also demonstrated his promising talent, taking 3 wickets in the second innings to follow up on 3 wickets in the first, on a pitch not typically associated with assisting spinners. His dismissal of Younis Khan during the afternoon session was spectacular, with a wonderfully flighted delivery that just clipped the bail of the off stump.\nFrom this point, it was a matter of time before England took the honours.\nAs a result of a rib injury obtained during the course of the Test (and determined to be an \"internal\" injury rather than an \"external\" one) the Pakistan Captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq, was unable to bat for 4h20m in the Pakistan 2nd innings, or until the fall of the 5th wicket (whichever came first). As England took five wickets in the first session of the last day, he was able to come in at number 7 in the order. His wicket was eventually the last to fall, being stumped off the bowling of Monty Panesar, and Pakistan were all out for 155.\nEngland won the match by 167 runs, and took an unassailable 2–0 lead in the series, with one left to play.\n4th Test.\nPakistan made three changes to their side for the final test. The uncertainty of the opening pair continued, with Salman Butt and Taufeeq Umar being dropped in favour of Imran Farhat and Mohammad Hafeez. The tourists' bowling ranks were boosted by the return of Mohammad Asif, for whom Mohammad Sami made way.\nPakistan won the toss and chose to field in cloudy conditions. This proved to be a good decision, as Pakistan's seamers Umar Gul and Mohammad Asif took eight wickets between them on the way to bowling England out for 173. Asif in particular caused problems for England's batsmen, and left people wondering what the outcome of the series would have been had he not been injured for the earlier tests.\nLate on day 1, Pakistan began their reply confidently, and their fourth opening partnership combination of the series proved to be the most successful one. Hafeez hit some good shots before retiring hurt with a knee problem. He would return to complete his innings and score 95, while Farhat scored 91. England's poor first day was complete when they dropped Mohammad Yousuf twice before he reached double figures. He went on to score 128, his third century of the series.\nPakistan continued their dominance of the match on day 2, with the close of play score at 336/3, a lead of 163. On day 3, England finally managed to start taking wickets in between frequent rain and bad light interruptions, but they were not able to curtail Pakistan's scoring. Faisal Iqbal ended on 58 not out, his first contribution in the series. Pakistan were finally bowled out for 504, a lead of 331.\nMarcus Trescothick was dismissed early in England's second innings, in what would be his last test match appearance for England. Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook then progressed the score to 78/1 at the close of play.\nThe (what would prove to be eventful) fourth day began with Strauss and Cook continuing on the improved batting performance before Strauss fell lbw to Danish Kaneria with the score on 115. Kevin Pietersen came in and played an aggressive innings, hitting 96 from 114 deliveries, and only falling when he chased a wide delivery in an attempt to bring up his century.\nThe dismissal of Cook for 83 off the bowling of Umar Gul, with a delivery of reverse swing, resulted in umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove calling a halt to play so a set of used balls could be brought out to the middle: Hair and Doctrove ruled that the ball had been tampered with, and awarded 5 penalty runs to England. \nFollowing this incident, Pakistan subsequently refused to continue the match after tea: in keeping with the Laws of Cricket, and despite protests from Pakistan players and officials, Hair and Doctrove awarded the match to England on a forfeit. \nThe ICC changed the result of the match to a draw in July 2008, but reversed this decision on 1 February 2009.\nT20 series.\nOnly T20I.\nPakistan won the match by five wickets. After bowling out four of England's upper order batsmen for fewer than 20 runs between them, Pakistan secured a comfortable win aided by Shahid Afridi who struck 28 off just 10 balls (22 of these in a single over).\nEngland ODI series.\n3rd ODI.\nShoaib Akhtar was in the spotlight after television cameras caught him working on the ball. The pictures appeared to show Akhtar flicking his thumb at the ball. However, ICC referee Mike Procter analysed the TV footage and decided there was no case to answer on behalf of the Pakistani team.\nScotland ODI match.\nOnly ODI.\nPakistan won the match by five wickets, after Scotland lost four wickets in the first eight overs and then four more in the remaining 42. Ryan Watson and Neil McCallum put on 116 for the fifth wicket, an ODI record partnership for Scotland, who played their first ODI for seven years. Their innings also doubled the number of ODI fifties scored for Scotland.\nExternal sources.\nCricketArchive"

        "title": "1975 World Snooker Championship",
        "text": "The 1975 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament that took place between 9 April and 1 May 1975 at various venues in Australia. The event was the 1975 edition of the World Snooker Championship, first held in 1927. The tournament featured 27 participants, eight of whom were seeded and received byes to the second round. The event featured a prize fund of A$30,000 with the winner receiving A$7,500. This was the second (and most recent) World Snooker Championship to be held outside of the United Kingdom after 1969, when the World Championship reverted to a knockout format. The tournament was promoted by Eddie Charlton Promotions on behalf of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.\nThe final was held at the Nunawading Basketball Centre on Burwood Highway, in Burwood East, Victoria. Defending champion Ray Reardon played Eddie Charlton in a best of 61 match. Reardon won 10 of the 12 frames on the second day to lead 16–8 but Charlton took the first nine frames on day three and moved into the lead. Reardon then led 23–21 before Charlton won eight frames in a row to lead 29–23, requiring just two of the last nine frames to win. However Reardon then took seven frames in a row and, although Charlton levelled the match at 30–30, Reardon won the deciding frame to secure a 31–30 victory. It was the third consecutive year that Reardon won the title, and his fourth overall. Dennis Taylor made the highest of the tournament, 128, in his quarter-final match against Gary Owen.\nOverview and format.\nThe World Snooker Championship is the preeminent tournament in professional snooker. Joe Davis won the first edition, in 1927 at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Ray Reardon was the defending champion in 1975, having defeated Graham Miles 22–12 in the 1974 final.\nThe championship was held from 9 April to 1 May 1975 at multiple locations across Australia. This was the second time since 1969 that the championship was held outside the United Kingdom, after 1971. Tobacco brand Park Drive did not continue their sponsorship from 1974. The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association appointed Eddie Charlton Promotions as the promoter. Charlton was a leading player, and the losing finalist in the 1973 World Snooker Championship. Snooker historian Clive Everton later wrote that \"Some sports might have found it odd that a world championship should be promoted by one of its leading contenders but professional snooker, ever since the days of Joe Davis, was used to the idea of a player or clique of players having control of either promotion or administration, or both.\"\nThe event featured 27 participants, with a preliminary round, and eight seeded players who were awarded byes to the second round. The number of frames increased during the tournament, with the opening rounds being the best of 29, the quarter-finals and semi-finals best of 37 and the final a best of 61 frames match.\nThere was controversy about the seedings. John Spencer was seeded 8 which meant that he met top seed Reardon in the quarter-finals; the pair were regarded as the two leading players. 1972 champion Alex Higgins was also in the top half of the draw, while promoter Eddie Charlton was in the bottom half. Several years later, in his autobiography, Reardon called the seedings for the tournament \"a farce\". Journalist and author John Dee referred to \"shady goings on perhaps by the draw committee who seemed to be doing their utmost to bring the title to Australia.\"\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nMost of the early round matches were played in New South Wales although the semi-finals were played in Canberra and Brisbane with the final in Melbourne. Reardon arrived in Australia on 3 March for to play a series of 23 exhibition matches against Charlton ahead of the tournament.\nThis was the only year that Rex King, Ron Mares and Phil Tarrant ever participated in the main Championship. Jim Charlton and Lou Condo also made their world championship debuts.\nPreliminary round.\nThe three preliminary matches were the best of 29 frames, and each featured an Australian player against an English one. David Greaves won in the against Jim Charlton. Lou Condo led Maurice Parkin 13–8 going into their final session; he won the first two frames of the concluding session to complete a 15–8 victory. Tarrant needed to win only a single frame from their last session to defeat Bernard Bennett after building a 14–7 lead, and took the match 15–8.\nFirst round.\nFirst round matches were played across 29 frames. Warren Simpson, runner-up in 1970, defeated Ron Mares 19–10 after he had achieved a winning margin at 15–5. John Pulman eliminated Tarrant 23–6, having assured his win at 15–9. David Taylor defeated at Rex King 15–8. Ian Anderson, who, aged 28, was one of the youngest competitors, took a 6–1 lead against Lou Condo, and won 15–8.\nSouth African Professional Championship winner Perrie Mans was defeated by Dennis Taylor 15–12. Mans was down by two frames after the first session, but recovered to 7–7, before Taylor pulled ahead in the third session. The pair shared the two s for a final score of 16–13. Gary Owen progressed to the next round after achieving a decisive margin against Greaves at 15–3. He won all but one of the dead frames, for 25–4. Jim Meadowcroft led Bill Werbeniuk 2–5, but Werbeniuk reached a winning score at 15–9. Cliff Thorburn took a 10–4 lead against Paddy Morgan, gained the win at 15–6, and finished the contest at 17–12.\nSecond round.\nIn the second round, matches were contested over 29 frames. Reardon took a 4–3 lead against Simpson in their first session. and eventually won 15–11, after which Simpson won the three dead frames. Spencer defeated Pulman 15–10; the four dead frames were shared for a final score of 17–12. Higgins defeated David Taylor 15–2, with Taylor narrowing his deficit during the dead frames to leave the final score 20–9 to Higgins. Williams led Anderson 9–3, and won 15–4; as each player took five of the dead frames, it ended 20–9.\nIn a match that was played against a noisy background of numerous slot machines at the Marrickville RSL Club, Dennis Taylor won each of the first three sessions against Davis by the odd frame, 4–3. Davis then took the first four frames of the final session to lead 13–12; two frames later he led 14–13, but Taylor won the next two frames to secure a 15–14 victory. Davis later wrote that the tournament \"turned out to be a farce from my point of view... the noise and distraction were incredible\".\nOwen defeated Dunning 19–10, having secured his passage to the next round at 15-8. Charlton made the first century break of the championship, 125, during his 15-11 defeat of Werbeniuk. Werbeniuk added only one of the dead frames, ending at 12–17. Thorburn won six of the seven frames in the first session against Miles, followed by him adding all seven frames from their second session. Miles won only four of the 29 frames they played; Thorburn won at 15–2.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-final matches were played across 37 frames. Spencer recorded breaks of 114 and 103, and had a two-frame lead after the first session of his match against Reardon. The pair each won three frames in the second session, to leave Spencer leading 7–5. During the fourth session, five breaks of over 50 were made and Reardon levelled the match at 12–12. Reardon won the match 19–18. Reardon commented after the match, \"I think this was probably the greatest match ever played... I've never potted better or defended better, and I don't think John has.\" The match between Higgins and Williams was delayed for 50 minutes during the second session after an overhead light fell onto the snooker table. Higgins later led 13–5. The final score was 21–16 to Higgins, who had won the match at 19–12.\nTaylor gained a 13–5 leads against Owen, and made the highest break of the tournament, 128, during his 19–9 win. The final score was 23–14 to Taylor. Charlton and Thorburn drew each of their first three sessions 3–3. Charlton established an advantage in the fourth session, and ended it 13–11 up. Thorburn later recalled that, shortly after the commencement of the fifth session, Charlton started to play more quickly: \"He went for everything. He hardly missed a thing. He was running around the table, running around it!\" Thorburn, writing in 1987, remarked that he had never faced anyone who played as well as Charlton had during that session. The final score was 23–14 to Charlton, with a conclusive score reached at 19-12.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were the best of 37 frames. Reardon took the first two sessions against Higgins by margins of 5–1 and 4–2, but Higgins drew level at 10–10; Reardon went on to win 19–14.\nTaylor flew in a light aircraft from Sydney on the morning of his match with Charlton; the aircraft encountered turbulence, and, according to Everton, Taylor \"never recovered from a poor start\". Charlton took 10 of the first 12 frames, and was 16–8 ahead after four sessions, going on to win 19–12. In his autobiography, Taylor recalled that \"Charlton was playing well, with his famous gun-barrel cueing action\", but also mentioned that he had been at a disadvantage playing on a table that Charlton was used to from his earlier matches in the tournament.\nFinal.\nThe final was held at the Nunawading Basketball Centre on Burwood Highway, in Burwood East, Victoria, as the best of 61 frames. Reardon led 16-8, but Charlton then won the next nine frames to take the lead. Reardon was ahead 22-20, but Charlton won nine of the following ten frames to lead 29-23. Reardon produced a seven-frame winning streak to leave himself needing one further frame at 30–29. Charlton won the 60th frame. In the deciding frame, Reardon made a 62 break, to claim victory at 31–30. It was Reardon's third consecutive championship win, and his fourth overall. In all, he won six world titles. Charlton never reached the final again, but he was runner-up at the World Billiards Championship in 1984 and 1988.\nThe 1975 tournament received significantly less UK press coverage than the three preceding world championships had done; the level of coverage in the Australian press was described as \"very poor\" by \"Snooker Scene\". Everton considered that for Charlton, losing the final was \"a psychological set back from which [he] never recovered\".\nResults.\nPreliminary matches.\nResults of the preliminary matches were as follows. Scores shown do not include dead frames.\nMain draw.\nBelow is the results from the event. Players in bold denote match winners, whilst numbers in brackets are the players seeding.

Victoria is a private 18-hole golf course that was designed by golf course architect Tom Fazio and constructed in 1996 on land that had been used for strip mines from the 1950s until 1977. Developed and initially owned by Terry Friedman and family, the course was sold to Victoria Partners LLC in 2010.

        "text": "The 1987 World Snooker Championship (also referred to as the 1987 Embassy World Snooker Championship for the purpose of sponsorship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place between 18 April and 4 May 1987 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. It was the sixth and final ranking event of the 1986–87 snooker season. The championship was the 1987 edition of the World Snooker Championship, first held in 1927, and had 32 participants. The highest ranked 16 players were awarded a place in the first round draw, whilst a pre-tournament qualification event for 104 professionals was held between 26 March and 4 April at the Preston Guild Hall for the remaining places. The tournament was sponsored by cigarette manufacturer Embassy and had a prize fund of £400,000 with the winner receiving £80,000.\nSince his 1986 victory, Joe Johnson had experienced a disappointing season leading up to the 1987 Championship, and bookmakers considered it unlikely that he would retain the title. Johnson did reach the final, a rematch of the previous year's final against Steve Davis. Davis won his fourth championship by defeating Johnson 18 to 14. A total of 18 century breaks were made during the tournament, the highest of which was 127 made by Davis in first frame of the final. Stephen Hendry, aged 18, became the youngest player to win a match in the tournament's history since it moved to the Crucible in 1977, whilst it was the last time that six-times champion Ray Reardon appeared.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the sport was popular in the British Isles. However, in the modern era it has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nThe 1987 championship featured 32 professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single elimination format, each played over several . The 32 competitors in the main tournament were selected using a combination of the top players in the world snooker rankings and a pre-tournament qualification stage. The tournament was promoted by WPBSA Promotions, a subsidiary of professional snooker governing body the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). Joe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, the final match being held in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held in the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England.\nFormat.\nThe championship was held from 18 April to 4 May 1987 at the Crucible, the 11th time that the tournament was held at the venue. It was the last ranking event of the 1986–87 snooker season on the World Snooker Tour. There were a total of 120 entrants from the tour, and the competition's main draw had 32 participants. A four-round knockout qualifying competition was held at Preston Guild Hall from 26 March to 4 April which produced the 16 qualifying players who progressed into the main draw to play the top 16 seeds.\nThe top 16 players in the latest world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. As defending champion, Joe Johnson was seeded first for the event; the remaining 15 seeds were allocated based on the players' world ranking positions. Matches in the first round of the main draw were played as best-of-19-frames, meaning 10 frames were required to win the match. The number of frames needed to win a match increased to 13 in the second round and quarter-finals, and 16 in the semi-finals; the final match was played as best-of-35-frames.\nPrize fund.\nThe event featured a prize fund of £400,000 with the winner receiving £80,000. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nThe defending champion, Joe Johnson, had failed to reach as far as the quarter-finals of a major tournament in the 1986–87 snooker season after winning the 1986 World Championship. This record was described by \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" Les Wheeler as \"disappointing\" and by Clive Everton as a \"poor\" season. Sydney Friskin of \"The Times\" reported that Johnson prepared for the Championship by practising diligently, and that the cyst on his back that previously troubled him had been removed. Johnson started the event as a bookmakers' outsider, priced at 66–1 against winning the tournament.\nLeading up to the event, Neal Foulds had been the most successful player of the season, having gained the most ranking points during the season, ahead of Steve Davis. Twelve days before the start of the tournament, the two-times world champion Alex Higgins was fined £12,000 and given a six-month ban from tournaments by the WPBSA. The ban started on 5 May, the day after the final of the 1987 World Snooker Championship. The penalties resulted from a number of incidents, the most serious of which was headbutting Paul Hatherall, a WPBSA tournament director, at the 1986 UK Championship.\nQualifying.\nThere were four rounds of qualifying, with higher ranked players seeded into the later rounds, and 104 entrants which took place at the Preston Guild Hall between 25 March and 4 April 1987. The 16 winners in the fourth round progressed to play the tournament's top 16 seeds at the Crucible. All qualifying matches were best-of-19 frames held over two . There were 24 matches scheduled in the first qualifying round, but Frank Jonik, Eddie McLaughlin, Sakchai Sim Ngam and Omprakesh Agrawal all withdrew, meaning that their opponents received walkovers. The 11-time pool world champion, Jim Rempe, made a of 104 in defeating Martin Smith 10–9. Veteran professional Bernard Bennett suffered the only whitewash of the first round, failing to win a frame against Billy Kelly.\nIn the second round, there were 32 matches. The youngest player in the competition, Stephen Hendry, made a break of 108 during his 10–7 defeat of Mike Darrington. Eight-times champion Fred Davis lost 5–10 to Ken Owers. Another former champion, John Spencer, who had won the title three times, eliminated Roger Bales 10–3. Trailing after the first session of his qualifying match 3–5, Jimmy van Rensberg was taken to hospital with a suspected heart attack. However, he was later discharged and went on to win 10–6.\nThe third round consisted of 16 matches between winners from the second round. Hendry led 8–1 against Rempe at the end of their first session, with Rempe winning three consecutive frames in their second session before Hendry won the match 10–4. Gino Rigitano conceded the 11th frame of his match against Steve Newbury when there were still enough balls on the table for him to win, and when 4–9 down decided not to play the next frame, thereby losing 4–10. There were two 10–0 whitewashes: by Jon Wright over Mark Wildman and by Tony Jones over van Rensberg.\nThe fourth round also featured 16 matches, with 16 players seeded into the round each meeting one of the third round winners. For the first time since turning professional, John Spencer failed to qualify for the event, as he was defeated 5–10 by Barry West. Bill Werbeniuk and Eddie Charlton also failed to qualify for the competition for the first time. Werbeniuk lost 8–10 to Mark Bennett and Charlton was defeated 4–10 by Warren King. The only match to go to a in round four was John Virgo's 10–9 win over Tony Jones. Dene O'Kane scored five century breaks across his three matches, a new record, including a 132. He received £2,000 for this break, the highest during qualifying.\nFirst round.\nThe first round of the main tournament was held from 18 to 23 April with matches played as the best-of-19 frames over two sessions. Defending champion Joe Johnson played Eugene Hughes, with the match going to a deciding frame and Johnson winning 10–9. Steve Davis was 7–1 ahead of Warren King at the end of their first session, but King then won six of the next seven frames to reduce Davis's lead to one frame at 8–7. Davis narrowly won frame 16 with a break of 63, then completed a 10–7 victory in frame 17, where he successfully gained enough points from King, despite .\nMurdo MacLeod defeated Rex Williams 10–5, despite Williams making the highest break of the first round, a 112. The win made MacLeod the first Scottish player to secure a victory at the Crucible Theatre. Stephen Hendry met veteran player Willie Thorne, led 5–4 at the end of their first session, and then took the first four frames in the second, before Thorne won three in a row. Hendry took the 17th frame to achieve a 10–7 win. At age 18 years and 97 days, Hendry became the youngest-ever player to win a World Championship match at the Crucible. Steve Longworth led 5–4 after the first session of his match, and won five successive frames to defeat Kirk Stevens 10–5. Terry Griffiths also progressed from a 5–4 interval lead to a 10–4 win, against Jim Wych. Alex Higgins, due to start a six-month ban after the Championship, eliminated first-year professional Jon Wright 10–6.\nJimmy White led Dean Reynolds 5–4 at the end of their first session. Reynolds won the first two frames of the second session both on , before White went on to win 10–8. From 7–8, White made breaks of 70, 75 and 59 to win the three frames he needed to progress.

Fourth seed Tony Knowles lost 6–10 to Mike Hallett, having led 6–5, and 11th seed Tony Meo lost 8–10 to John Parrott.\nSilvino Francisco and John Campbell played only eight of their scheduled nine frames in the first session, due to slow play, with Francisco leading 5–3 when they started the following session. Francisco won five consecutive frames at the start of the second session to complete a 10–3 win. Doug Mountjoy led David Taylor 6–3 after their first session, and won 10–6. The 1985 champion Dennis Taylor led Bennett 8–1 before winning 10–4.

Francisco and Hallett were at 8–8 after their second session before Hallett won three frames in a row, with breaks of 84, 47, 35 and 93. He also won the 20th frame, after requiring foul shots from Francisco, to lead 12–8, and clinched victory at 13–9 to reach his first World Championship quarter-final. Foulds led Taylor 5–3 after their first session, and won the match 13–10.\nO'Kane eliminated another top-16 player with a victory over Mountjoy. Mountjoy led 3–0, but O'Kane then won the next six frames, and won 13–5. White made a break of 114 in his match against Parrott, the highest in that year's championship to that point, and won 13–11. Five of the frames had been decided on the black, with White winning four of them. Higgins led Griffiths 6–3 after the first session but Griffiths won four frames in a row and the match was tied at 8–8. Griffiths went on to defeat Higgins 13–10. Six-times winner of the event Reardon led 3–1 but lost 12 of the next 13 frames as he was eliminated 4–13 by Davis. After the tournament, Reardon dropped out of the top 16 in the end-of-season world rankings, moving down from 15 to 38.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-final matches were played over three sessions, in best-of-25 frames, on 28 and 29 April. Johnson led Hendry 8–1 and 12–8, before Hendry won four frames in a row to take the match to a deciding frame at 12–12. In the final frame, after Hendry failed to pot a , Johnson made a break of 46 to take the frame and match 13–12. Hallett compiled two century breaks in the first session of his match against Foulds, who also constructed a century break, with their first session ending at 4–4. Foulds then opened up a lead, leading 10–6 and 12–7 before winning at 13–9.\nDavis was 4–3 ahead of Griffiths after their first session, and 10–5 ahead by the end of the second. He wrapped up a 13–5 win and with breaks of 62, 86 and 51 in three frames in the final session. It was the fifth time that Davis had defeated Griffiths at the World Championship, and the largest winning margin of those encounters. White won all eight frames in the first session in his match against O'Kane, and after winning the first frame of the second session, led 9–0. O'Kane then won five consecutive frames, before White took four of the following five frames to win 13–6.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-final matches were played as the best-of-31 frames, held over four sessions, from 30 April to 2 May.

In frame eight, Foulds made a break of 48 to win the frame, and won frame nine, despite requiring foul shots. Johnson made breaks of 47 in each of the next two frames to lead 6–5. Foulds took the next before Johnson, with his fourth break of 47 in four frames, took the lead again. Foulds won the last frame of the session with a break of 45 to leave them all square at 7–7 after two sessions, and made a break of 114 in the 15th frame to go one ahead before Johnson won seven frames in a row to lead 14–8. After this, Foulds won frame 23, but Johnson won the next two frames to win the match 16–9 to reach his second final.\nDavis and White had been level at 4–4 after their first session, with Davis winning the first four of their second session to lead 8–4 and finishing that session 9–6 ahead. In the first frame of the third session, White was on course to make a maximum break, having potted ten reds and nine blacks, but missed the tenth black. After this, Davis required White to make foul shots in order to gain the necessary penalty points from them for Davis to win the frame. Aided by a black, and by a following a foul by White, Davis eventually won the frame by one point. John Hennessey in \"Pot Black\" magazine wrote that \"at that moment White lost the chance of claiming his first world title,\" adding that White's father later said that losing the frame affected White badly during the following three. However, White later compiled a 119 break, the new highest in the competition, overtaking his earlier 114 in the second round, and ended the third session 9–13 behind. White took the first frame of the fourth session, but lost three of the following four frame as Davis won the match 16–11, concluding with a 74 break in the 27th frame.\nFinal.\nThe final was played as a best-of-35 frames match held over four sessions between Davis and Johnson on 3 and 4 May 1987. It was the first time that the same two players had met in the final at the Crucible for the second year in a row. The last time that two players had met in consecutive finals at the World Championship was when Fred Davis and John Pulman had both reached the final in 1955 and 1956, played at the Tower Circus, Blackpool. The next time it would happen was when Hendry and White met in three consecutive finals between 1992 and 1994. This was also the first time that the final had been contested by the top two seeds of the tournament. The final was refereed by Len Ganley, the second time he had taken charge of the World Championship final.\nIn frame one, Davis compiled a 127 break, which remained the highest break of that year's tournament. Johnson responded winning three frames in a row followed by Davis taking two to level at 3-3. Johnson was 4–3 ahead at the end of the first session. Davis added three successive frames to lead 6–4 at the start of the second session, then Johnson won the 11th frame with a break of 101 before falling three behind as Davis won the next two frames. Johnson was behind in the 14th frame but won it with a break of 73. The last two frames of the session were both won with the aid of fluked reds: the 15th frame by Davis, and the last of the day by Johnson, the day finishing with Davis leading 9–7. On the second day, Johnson won the first frame of the third session to reduce Davis's lead to one frame. Davis then took four consecutive frames to lead 13–8, but missed the last red ball when on a break of 52. Johnson then cleared up to the black, which Davis would have required to level the scores in the frame. However, Davis left the black in a position that it could be potted from, and Johnson won the frame. Davis won the next frame, to lead 14–9 at the end of the third session.\nJohnson made a break of 52 in the first frame of the fourth session, but failed on an attempt to pot a red, which gave Davis an opportunity. Davis then made a break of 35, but left an easy for Johnson, who cleared to the to win. In the next frame, Johnson made a break of 62, and then Davis attempted a , but missed the . Johnson potted the yellow from distance and cleared to the blue, with Davis then conceding the frame. Johnson led 50–0 in the next frame, and with both players making a number of errors Davis left him an easy brown that allowed Johnson in to win his fourth consecutive frame to move to one behind at 13–14. Davis had breaks of 64 and 40 to lead 15–13, a break of 73 to help make it 16–13, and 17–13 winning frame 30, decided on the final . Johnson won another frame, with a break of 67, before Davis clinched victory with a break of 73 to make it 18–14, achieving his fourth World Championship title. After the match, Davis said: \"Winning this is better than 1981 because I've experienced getting beat in the final and its horrible.\"\nAftermath.\nDuring the tournament, there were reports that Foulds and WPBSA chairman Williams were taking beta blockers. These were banned under International Olympic Committee rules, but not prohibited in snooker. Colin Moynihan, a Member of the British Parliament, called for Williams to resign and any players using beta blockers to withdraw from competing. In November 1987, the WPBSA was suspended from using the Sports Council's drug-testing facilities until the use of beta blockers was banned from the sport. Moynihan wrote to Williams supporting the ban that had been proposed by the Sports Council's Drug Advisory Group. Williams resigned as WPBSA chairman in November 1987, having received criticism over the drug testing issue as well as over his personal business connections with promoters Barry Hearn and Frank Warren. The WPBSA voted to ban the use of beta blockers, other than cardioselective types, in January 1988, with the ban to come into effect from the start of the 1988–89 snooker season.\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for the tournament.

It was the sixth and final ranking event of the 1985–86 snooker season and the 1986 edition of the World Snooker Championship, first held in 1927. The total prize fund was £350,000 with £70,000 awarded to the winner and was sponsored by cigarette manufacturer Embassy.\nThe defending champion was Dennis Taylor, who had defeated Steve Davis 18–17 in the 1985 World Snooker Championship final to win his first world title. In defence of his title, Taylor lost in the first round of the event 6–10 to Mike Hallett. Joe Johnson the world number 16 defeated Davis 18–12 in the final to win his sole ranking event. Prior to the competition, the bookmakers' odds for a Johnson victory were 150/1. There were 20 century breaks compiled in total during the tournament, the highest of which was a 134 made by Davis in the opening frame of his quarter-final win.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual professional snooker tournament organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the cue sport was popular in the British Isles. However, in the modern era, which started in 1969 when the World Championship reverted to a knockout format, it has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nJoe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, hosted by the Billiards Association and Control Council, the final match being held at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England.

A bonus of £80,000 was reserved for the first player (if any) to make a maximum break. The prize money allocation is shown below.\nTournament summary.\nQualifying.\nQualifying matches took place at Preston Guild Hall from 26 March to 6 April 1986.

John Spencer qualified to meet another former champion, Alex Higgins, at the main stage of the competition by beating Newbury 10–7 in the final qualifying round. Hendry became the youngest-ever qualifier for the Crucible stages at the time, by defeating Dene O'Kane 10–9, after having led 6–3. O'Kane was one of three top-32 seeds to be knocked out in the fourth round, the other two being Mark Wildman and Murdo MacLeod; Wildman lost 9–10, after establishing a 9–6 lead against Edmonds, while MacLeod was defeated 6–10 by Danny Fowler.\nFirst round.\nThe first round took place between 19 and 24 April, each match played over two sessions as the best of 19 frames. Defending champion Dennis Taylor, looking \"jaded\" according to Clive Everton, lost the first seven frames of his match against Mike Hallett, who ended the first session 8–1 ahead. Taylor won five more frames, but lost the match 6–10. Like John Spencer in 1978, Terry Griffiths in 1980, Cliff Thorburn in 1981, and Steve Davis in 1982, Taylor was unable to retain his first world title; this inability of a first-time champion to defend their title has become known as the \"Crucible curse\".

Steve Davis and Doug Mountjoy, who had contested the 1981 final, ended their first session tied at 4–4, and their second with Davis leading 11–5. Mountjoy did not pot a ball in the final session as Davis completed a 13–5 victory. Alex Higgins missed a black ball from its spot that would have put him 6–2 ahead of Terry Griffiths at the end of their first session, but the frame went to Griffiths, leaving Higgins just 5–3 ahead. Griffiths had the better of their second session, and made a break of 110 to level at 6–6. Whilst the next two frames were shared, Griffiths a to win frame 15 and then went 9–7 ahead at the end of their second session. The match went to a deciding frame, with Griffiths eventually winning 13–12. The match between Kirk Stevens and Eddie Charlton also finished with a deciding frame, Stevens winning the last three frames from 10 to 12 behind, to prevail 13–12.\nJoe Johnson led Mike Hallett 5–3 after their first session, on his way to completing a 13–6 win, making a break of 110 in frame 13. John Parrott and Jimmy White were level at 4–4 and 6–6, before White won a run of four frames to lead 10–6 after the second session. White then won three of the next five frames to win the match 13–8. Willie Thorne beat the Australian Professional Championship winner John Campbell 13–9. In the other second-round matches, Tony Knowles beat Silvino Francisco 13–10, and Cliff Thorburn beat Eugene Hughes 13–6.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played as best-of-25-frames matches over three sessions on 29 and 30 April. Joe Johnson led Terry Griffiths 9–7 at the end of the first day of their match. On resumption of play, Griffiths won five frames in a row to come within one frame of winning the match at 12–9. Despite his three-frame deficit, Johnson took the next four frames, making two century breaks on the way to a 13–12 victory. Steve Davis played Jimmy White in what was effectively a rematch of the 1984 World Snooker Championship final. Davis made a break of 134 in the opening frame and played consistently well in securing a 13–5 victory, White having missed a number of relatively simple pots.\nCliff Thorburn played Willie Thorne and won 13–6. The match report in \"The Times\" stated that Thorne \"was never allowed to play his usual fluent game.\" Thorburn took a 9–3 lead, and finished the second session 11–5 ahead. During the match, his wife Barbara gave birth to their second child in the couple's native Canada. Tony Knowles played Kirk Stevens in the fourth quarter-final. The pair were level at 4–4 after the first session, and then again at 8–8 after the second. At the beginning of the final session, Knowles won five out of six frames to win the match 13–9.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals took place between 1 and 3 May as best-of-31-frames matches played over four sessions. The first semi-final was between Tony Knowles and Joe Johnson. Knowles led 1–0 and 2–1 but ended their first session 3–4 behind, having missed middle pocket pots to allow his opponent into both the sixth and seventh frames. According to Sydney Friskin's match report in \"The Times\", Johnson appeared to be relaxed and was potting well as he built a 10–5 lead over Knowles by the end of the second session, and finished the third session 14–8 ahead. He took the first two frames of the last session to win the match 16–8, reaching his first World Championship final. Johnson won the match despite having taken painkillers for a cyst on his back before the start of play.\nSteve Davis played Cliff Thorburn in the second semi-final. With Davis leading 3–2, Thorburn was on course for a maximum break but failed on the ninth black, although he did go on to win the sixth frame and level the match at 3–3. Davis won the next three frames to lead 6–3, but his lead had dwindled to 8–7 by the end of the first day's play. Thorburn pulled ahead 9–8 and 10–9 in the third session before Davis made his fifth century break of the tournament, a 112, to tie the match at 10–10. A missed black from Davis gave Thorburn the opportunity to take the next frame, but Davis won the last of the session to draw level again at 11–11. On resumption of play, Davis won five frames against Thorburn's one, compiling a break of 122 in the last frame of the match, to secure a 16–12 victory and reach his fifth world final.\nFinal.\nThe final between Steve Davis and Joe Johnson took place on 4 and 5 May. It was a best-of-35 frames match played over four sessions. The two players had never previously played a professional match against each other. Davis was considered much more likely to win the final, reflected in the bookmakers' odds of 2/9 for Davis and 5/1 for Johnson. Davis took a 3–1 lead before the first mid-session interval, having made breaks of 108 and 107. Johnson then took the next three frames to finish the first session 4–3 ahead. Davis made a strong start to the second session, winning four frames in succession to put himself 7–4 ahead. After the next mid-session interval, Johnson won four consecutive frames, before Davis clinched the last frame to leave the match level at 8–8 overnight.\nOn the second day, Johnson wore an unusual pair of red, pink and white leather shoes. On resuming the match, he won another run of four frames to take him into a 12–8 lead, assisted by a fluke on a red ball in the 18th frame. The third session ended with Johnson 13–11 ahead. In the final session, the crowd responded in favour of Johnson, who had played with an attacking style throughout the tournament. He won three of the next four frames to lead 16–12 before the mid-session interval. Johnson then won frame 29, and secured a break of 64 in frame 30 to win the match 18–12. The win helped lift him from 16th place in the 1985–1986 professional rankings to eighth for 1986–1987.\nDavis, being the World Championship runner-up for a second consecutive year, commented to interviewer David Vine \"We can't go on meeting like this, David,\" and Johnson later retorted \"I hope that we can still be friends\". The popularity of Johnson's win resulted in an appearance on television show \"Wogan\", as well as him accompanying Cliff Richard in a box to watch Wimbledon. This was Johnson's only ranking event win in his career, although he would go on to win two non-ranking tournaments: the 1987 Scottish Masters and the 1989 Norwich Union Grand Prix. The two players again met in the final at the following year's championship to contest the world title for a second time, Davis winning the match 18–14. Johnson's attacking style of snooker, notable for his long potting, has been seen as a harbinger of the style that became dominant in the 1990s. The odds on Johnson were 150 to 1 against him winning the 1986 World Championship as he had not won any tournaments in his seven-year career and had never previously won a match at the Crucible. A condensed version of the final was showcased on BBC Two on 22 April 2020 in place of the 2020 World Snooker Championship which had been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nMain draw.\nThe numbers in brackets denote player seedings, whilst match winners are denoted in bold.

        "text": "The 1985 World Snooker Championship (also known as the 1985 Embassy World Snooker Championship for the purpose of sponsorship) was a professional ranking tournament in snooker that took place from 12 to 28 April 1985 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. Organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the event was the ninth consecutive World Snooker Championship to be held at the Crucible, the first tournament having taken place in 1977. A five-round qualifying event for the championship was held at the Preston Guild Hall from 29 March to 5 April for 87 players, 16 of whom reached the main stage, where they met the 16 invited seeded players. The tournament was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC, and was sponsored by the Embassy cigarette company. The total prize fund for the event was £250,000, the highest prize pool for any snooker tournament to that date. The winner received £60,000, which was the highest amount ever received by the winner of a snooker event at that time.\nThe defending champion was Englishman Steve Davis, who had previously won the World Championship three times. He met Northern Irishman Dennis Taylor in the final which was a best-of-35- match. Davis took an early 9–1 lead, but Taylor battled back into the match and drew level at 17–17, forcing a deciding frame. The 35th frame was contested over the final , with the player able to the ball winning the world title. After Taylor missed three attempts to pot the black, Davis missed his only attempt to leave Taylor a relatively simple pot to win his sole World Championship. The match, often referred to as the \"black ball final\", is commonly considered to be the best-known match in the history of snooker and a reason for the surge in the sport's popularity in the 1980s and 1990s.\nCanadian Bill Werbeniuk scored the championship's highest , a 143, in his first-round match. There were 14 century breaks compiled during the championship, with ten more in qualifying matches. This was the first professional snooker championship to introduce a ban on performance-enhancing substances, with all players in the main stage having to undertake drug tests. The final between Davis and Taylor holds the record for the most-viewed broadcast in the United Kingdom of a programme shown after midnight, with a peak of 18.5 million viewers for the match's final frame, breaking the existing records for the most-viewed sporting event and BBC2 programme.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. Developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, snooker was popular in the United Kingdom before being introduced to Europe and the Commonwealth. The sport is now played worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nThe World Championship is organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). It features 32 professional players competing in one-on-one single-elimination matches, played over several . The players are selected to take part using a combination of the world snooker rankings and a pre-tournament qualification round. The first World Championship, in 1927, was won by Joe Davis in a final at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the tournament has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. The 1984 championship was won by England's Steve Davis, who defeated fellow countryman Jimmy White 18–16 in the final; this was Davis's third world championship win, following his victories in 1981 and 1983. The winner of the 1985 championship received a prize of £60,000 from a total of £250,000, the highest first prize amount for a snooker event to that date.\nThe tournament was the first snooker event to feature drug tests for the participants, as mandated by the WPBSA on 9 April 1985; the tests were proposed by WPBSA board member Barry Hearn. The event was broadcast by the BBC in the United Kingdom, with over 90 hours of coverage. The estimated cost for the fortnight's broadcast was reportedly £3 million. The championship was sponsored by the Embassy cigarette company.\nFormat.\nThe championship was held from 12 to 28 April 1985 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, the ninth consecutive World Championship to be held at the venue. It was the last ranking event of the 1984–85 snooker season. There were 103 entrants from the World Snooker Tour, with 32 participants in the competition's main draw. A five-round knockout qualifying competition with 87 players, held at Preston Guild Hall between 29 March and 5 April, produced the 16 qualifying players who progressed into the main draw to play the top 16 seeds. The draw for the tournament was made at the Savoy Hotel in London on 16 January 1985.\nThe top 16 players in the latest world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. As defending champion, Steve Davis was seeded first for the event; the remaining 15 seeds were allocated based on world rankings for the 1984–85 season. Matches in the first round of the main draw were played as best-of-19-frames. The number of frames needed to win a match increased to 13 in the second round and quarter-finals, and 16 in the semi-finals; the final match was played as best-of-35-frames.\nSix former world champions participated in the main tournament at the Crucible: Ray Reardon (1970, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1978), Steve Davis (1981, 1983, and 1984), John Spencer (1969, 1971, and 1977), Alex Higgins (1972 and 1982), Cliff Thorburn (1980) and Terry Griffiths (1979). Four players made their world championship debuts, all via the qualifying event: Dene O'Kane, Eugene Hughes, Tony Jones, and Wayne Jones.\nPrize fund.\nThe event had a total prize fund of £250,000, an increase of £50,000 in the total prize pool from the previous year, and the winner received £60,000, an increase of £16,000 from the previous year. The prize amount was a new record high for snooker event. The breakdown of prize money for the tournament was:\nTournament summary.\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying rounds for the event were played from 29 March to 5 April at the Preston Guildhall. The qualifying competition consisted of five knockout rounds, starting with 87 players. There were seven matches in the first round, bringing the number of remaining players to 80. The other four qualifying rounds each contained 16 matches, the winners of each round meeting the 16 higher-ranked players who had been seeded into the next round. The 16 winners from the fifth and final qualifying round met the top 16 seeds in the first round of the main competition.\nAll qualifying matches were played as best-of-19-frames.&lt;ref name=\"Parrot/Fowler\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; John Dunning was seeded into the third round of qualifying, where he played his first return match since his heart attack at the 1984 Grand Prix; he lost the match to Wayne Jones, 6–10. Danny Fowler made the highest break of the qualifying competition, scoring a 137 in his 10–0 victory over Jim Donnelly in the fourth round, before losing 2–10 to John Parrott in the fifth. Fred Davis, aged 71 and eight-time champion between 1948 and 1956, defeated Robert Chaperon 10–9 in the fourth round of qualifying but lost 6–10 to Rex Williams in the fifth.\nFirst round.\nThe first round of the championship, from 12 to 17 April, featured 32 players competing in 16 best-of-19-frames matches in two sessions; each seeded player competed against a qualifier. The first match to finish was between second seed Tony Knowles and qualifier Tony Jones. Knowles won four straight frames before he was pegged back to 4–4. Jones took four of the next five frames to lead 8–5 but eventually lost 8–10. As part of an initiative to remove performance-enhancing substances, drug tests were performed for the first time during the event; Knowles was the first player tested.&lt;ref name=\"Knowles/Jones\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nA series of articles in the \"Daily Star\" about drug abuse in the championship was based on statements reportedly by Silvino Francisco. Francisco trailed 1–8 after the first session of his first-round match against 11th seed Dennis Taylor, and lost the match 2–10. At a press conference held afterwards, World Snooker chairman Rex Williams said that there was no evidence of drug use in the sport, and Francisco apologised to Kirk Stevens (the player named in the \"Daily Star\" articles), claiming that the statements in the article were a \"total lie\".\nTop seed and defending champion, Steve Davis, won his match against Neal Foulds 10–8 to reach the second round. Only two unseeded players won their first-round matches: Patsy Fagan defeated 12th seed Willie Thorne 10–6 and John Parrott defeated 13th seed John Spencer 10–3. Spencer was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis shortly after the tournament; his vision was affected and he won only two matches all season. After being defeated twice during the season by Eugene Hughes, six-time champion and fifth seed Ray Reardon won 10–9 against Hughes on a deciding frame.\nIn a low-scoring match between ninth seed Alex Higgins and Dean Reynolds, neither player produced a break of over 30 points in the first three frames. Reynolds won just the fifth frame of the opening session, Higgins taking an 8–1 lead and eventually winning 10–4.&lt;ref name=\"Higgins/Reynolds\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; John Virgo led tenth seed Tony Meo 5–4 after the first session, but won just one frame in the second session to lose 6–10. In a press conference after the match, Virgo said: \"I don't think Tony played well enough to beat me. It was the run of the balls that beat me. That's the way it has been for me for six years. I can't explain it. I practise hard. I play well, but sometimes that is not enough. You need a lot of luck in this game and I didn't get any at all.\"\nAlthough fourth seed Kirk Stevens defeated Ray Edmonds 10–8, snooker pundit Clive Everton said that his standard of play was not that of a top-four player and Edmonds \"made [Stevens] work\". In a slow first session, Rex Williams and eighth seed Terry Griffiths played seven (instead of the planned nine) frames; Griffiths led 6–1 after three hours and 38 minutes, eventually winning the match 10–3. Bill Werbeniuk (seeded 14th), who had not won a match all season, defeated Joe Johnson 10–8 and scored a 143 break in the tenth frame – the third-highest break at the championship at that time.\nThird seed Cliff Thorburn defeated Mike Hallett, 10–8; 15th seed Doug Mountjoy defeated Murdo MacLeod, 10–5; 16th seed David Taylor defeated Dene O'Kane, 10–4; and sixth seed Eddie Charlton defeated John Campbell, 10–3, in an all-Australian tie.\nSecond round.\nThe second round, from 18 to 22 April, was played as eight best-of-25-frames matches. Steve Davis led David Taylor 3–0 and 6–3 before winning seven of the eight frames in the second session to win 13–4, scoring century breaks in the eighth (100) and eleventh (105) frames. Alex Higgins and Terry Griffiths were tied 5–5 after ten frames. Griffiths pulled ahead during the second session, leading 10–6, and won three of the first four frames of the final session to win 13–7.&lt;ref name=\"Griffiths/Higgins\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; John Parrott led Kirk Stevens 6–2 after the first session and eventually won, 13–6.\nRay Reardon and Patsy Fagan were tied after the first session, 4–4, before Reardon pulled ahead 7–5. Reardon the final of frame 13 to lead 8–5, and pulled ahead 12–9 before his came off in frame 22 when he was well ahead on points. Reardon would have been allowed 15 minutes to replace his cue tip, but Fagan offered to let Reardon use his cue. Reardon accepted, using Fagan's borrowed cue to complete his victory. In an all-Canadian second-round match, Cliff Thorburn defeated Bill Werbeniuk 13–3 with a . Two former event finalists, Dennis Taylor and Eddie Charlton, met in the second round; Taylor defeated Charlton, 13–6. Seventh seed Jimmy White overcame Tony Meo, after being tied 10–10, to win 13–11. In the final second-round match, Tony Knowles defeated Doug Mountjoy 13–6.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played as best-of-25-frames matches in three sessions on 23 and 24 April. Terry Griffiths led Steve Davis after winning the first four frames of the match, but finished the first session at 4–4. Davis won six of the eight frames in the second session to lead 10–6. In the first frame of the third session, Griffiths committed a by touching a ball with his waistcoat, following which Davis made a break of 80 to win the frame. Davis also took the next two frames, winning 13–6 to reach his fourth World Championship semi-final. John Parrott also won the first four frames of his match against Ray Reardon, and led 5–3 after the first session. Parrott extended his lead to 9–5 in the second session, but missed two in successive frames to lead by only 9–7 after the session. Reardon won the first five frames of the third session (seven in a row) to lead 12–9, and Parrott won the next three frames to force a deciding frame. With one red left on the table, Parrott led by seven points; Reardon Parrott, and won a to win the match with a break of 31.\nDue to slow play, only six of the eight frames of the opening session between Dennis Taylor and Cliff Thorburn were played. Taylor took a lead of 4–0, before ending the session at 4–2. The session was described as interesting by Clive Everton of \"The Guardian\", however, due to the \"high quality of the tactical play.\" The second session was also long-winded, with the match adjourned at 1:21a.m. (after nine hours and 45 minutes of play); Taylor led 10–5, with a frame still to be played. Resuming the match, Taylor won three straight frames to win 13–5 and reach his fifth semi-final. Thorburn said after the match that both players were at fault for the slow play: \"I wasn't the only one playing safe. If I had played well, this would have been the longest match ever.\" There was only one break of over 50 in the entire match, made by Taylor in the final frame.\nSecond seed Tony Knowles played Jimmy White, and led 5–3 after the first session. Knowles made a break of 137 during the session, but missed the black; it would have been the tournament's highest break. He retained his lead through the second session, despite twice being a pot away from being tied; the session finished 9–7. Returning to the match, Knowles won the next two frames but White won a re-spotted black in frame 19. Knowles handled the pressure better than White, and won 13–10.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 25 and 26 April as best-of-31-frames matches over four sessions. Reigning champion Steve Davis defeated Ray Reardon, needing only three sessions to secure a 16–5 victory. Reardon, the oldest-ever World Championship semi-finalist, failed to play at the level he had played against Parrott. Although Reardon had won his previous matches with strong play, Davis's created opportunities throughout the match. Janice Hale of \"Snooker Scene\" magazine wrote that the match had \"an air of inevitability\", with Davis in full control. Davis compiled the 100th century break made at the Crucible, a 106 break in frame 13. In winning, he reached his third straight World Championship final.\nTony Knowles played Dennis Taylor in the second semi-final. After winning the first two frames, Knowles won only three more frames in the rest of the match; Taylor led 10–5 after the second session, and then took six frames in a row to win the match in three sessions. Knowles had expected to win, as the higher-seeded player, but he failed to exhibit the form he had shown earlier in the tournament and fell by the same scoreline as Reardon. Afterwards, he could not understand how he had lost to a lower-seeded player. Taylor said that he had seen Knowles get \"angry\" during the match, however, and that he had \"thrown his cue\" at a few shots. Knowles also lost the following year's event in the semi-finals to eventual champion Joe Johnson.\nFinal.\nThe final was played between Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor on 27 and 28 April as a best-of-35-frames match over four sessions. This was Davis's fourth world final, having won the title in 1981, 1983, and 1984; and Taylor's second, having lost 16–24 to Terry Griffiths in the 1979 final. Davis and Taylor had met at the World Championship on two previous occasions, Taylor winning their first-round encounter in 1979 and Davis winning the semi-final in 1984.\nAlthough Taylor scored a break of 50 in the first frame of the match, Davis won all seven frames of the opening session to lead 7–0. At the start of the second session, Davis took the eighth frame and was leading in frame nine but missed a on the . This error was later considered the turning point of the match, as it allowed Taylor to win his first frame, Davis however won the next fame to lead 9–1, but Taylor won six frames in a row to finish the second session 7–9 behind overnight. On the second day, Taylor tied the match at 11–11 and 15–15, but was never ahead at any point. Davis won the next two frames to lead 17–15, needing one more frame to win the championship. Taylor clinched frame 33 and then made a break of over 50 to tie the match at 17–17, forcing a deciding frame.\nThe final frame lasted more than an hour, finishing after midnight British Summer Time. Davis led 62–44, with just the last four balls to play, Taylor requiring all four to win the match. He difficult shots on the , , and , leaving the black ball to determine the winner of the championship. With the black , both players attempted to the ball. The first real opportunity fell to Taylor, with a long pot to the corner, but he missed the shot; according to commentator Jim Meadowcroft, \"That was the biggest shot of his life\". Davis was left with a thin cut on the black; he stepped up to the table and again missed the shot, leaving Taylor a mid-range shot. Ted Lowe said, \"This is really unbelievable\" before Taylor potted the black and won the match. Taylor was not ahead at any point during the match, until the final pot. The final between Davis and Taylor attracted 18.5 million viewers on BBC2, the programme finishing at 12:23 a.m. after Taylor had won the title. The viewership was the highest for any broadcast after midnight in the United Kingdom, and the most-viewed show on BBC2. The match became known as \"the black ball final\".\nAfter potting the final ball, Taylor raised his ; he \"waggled\" his finger and kissed the winner's trophy. He said in a 2009 interview that the gesture was aimed at his \"good mate\" Trevor East, whom he had told he would win. At a press conference afterwards, he said that the match was the \"best he had ever been involved in [his] life\". Taylor dedicated the world championship to his late mother who had died the previous year. Unwilling to play snooker, he had withdrawn from the 1984 International Open. His family and friends had persuaded him to play again in the Grand Prix event, where he won his first professional title by defeating Cliff Thorburn in the final.\nMain draw.\nThe results for each round of the main stage of the championship are shown below. The numbers in parentheses beside some of the players are their seeding ranks (each championship has 16 seeds and 16 qualifiers).\nQualifying.\nFive rounds of qualifying were played for the event from 29 March to 5 April at the Preston Guildhall.\nRound 1\nLegacy.\nOn his return to Northern Ireland, Taylor received a victory parade in a Land Rover across his home town of Coalisland in front of 10,000 people. He was loaned mayoral robes on the day of the parade, and was accompanied by his wife and three children. He later signed a five-year contract with promoter Barry Hearn as his manager. Media covering the tournament called Steve Davis a \"bad loser\" for his silence and one-word responses to questions from David Vine at a press conference after the event. The press conference was later used as the basis for a \"Spitting Image\" skit on Davis. Taylor's victory is the most-viewed sporting event in the United Kingdom to date, and remains the most-viewed BBC2 program of all time.\nThe tournament final was recreated and redistributed by the BBC in various forms. 4 months later in August 1985 BBC Video released a highlights video of the 1985 final which was one of the biggest selling videos of 1985. At the 2010 World Snooker Championship, to celebrate the 25th anniversary, Taylor and Davis replayed the final frame with commentary by John Virgo. The frame was played as an exhibition, with both players attempting to re-create the shots on the final black ball. The 1985 championship was examined in the BBC documentary, \"When Snooker Ruled the World\", with particular emphasis on the final. Another one-hour BBC documentary on the final, \"Davis v Taylor: The '85 Black Ball Final\", which featured interviews with Taylor's friends and family in Northern Ireland, was presented by Colin Murray.\nDuring the 2015 World Snooker Championship, Davis presented \"Celebrity Black Ball Final\" on the BBC in which celebrities played the final two shots of the match; guests included Rebecca Adlington, Joey Essex, Russell Watson, Richard Osman and Josh Widdicombe. A 2017 BBC poll found the final to be the Crucible's \"most memorable\" moment, with the match receiving more than half the votes. Ronnie O'Sullivan's 1997 maximum break finished second. Davis also lost the following year's final, this time to Joe Johnson, but won another three world titles, in 1987, 1988 and 1989. Taylor never reached the final again, falling to the \"Crucible curse\" at the 1986 championship with a first-round loss to Mike Hallett.\nCentury breaks.\nThere were 14 century breaks in the championship. Bill Werbeniuk's 143 against Joe Johnson in the first round was the joint third-highest break in the championship's history, tied with Willie Thorne's in 1982. Only Cliff Thorburn's maximum break in 1983 and Doug Mountjoy's 145 in 1981 were higher. Tony Knowles missed the black on a break of 137 that would have scored a 144 in his quarter-final with Jimmy White.\nQualifying stages.\nThere were ten century breaks in the qualifying stages; the highest was made by Danny Fowler in his 10–0 whitewash of Jim Donnelly in the fourth round of qualifying."

It is very similar in appearance and habits to the northern cricket frog, \"Acris crepitans\", and was considered formerly conspecific (Dickerson 1906). The scientific name \"Acris\" is from the Greek word for locust, and the species name \"gryllus\" is Latin for cricket (Georgia Wildlife).\nDescription.\nAt 0.75–1.5 inches (16–32 mm) in length, \"Acris gryllus\" is even smaller than \"A. crepitans\". Other characters that differentiate the southern species are: \nThere is evidence that the color of the vertebral stripe on southern cricket frogs can vary temporally and can change within one frog's lifetime. \nRange and habitat.\nThe southern cricket frog is characteristic of coastal plain bogs, bottomland swamps, ponds, and ditches. It prefers sunny areas, and is usually not found in woodlands. Subspecies \"Acris gryllus gryllus\" is found in the Atlantic Coastal Plain from southeastern Virginia through the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, west to the Mississippi River. It is found mostly east of the Fall Line, but extends into more upland areas of the Piedmont along river valleys. Subspecies \"Acris gryllus dorsalis\" is found throughout the Florida peninsula.\nHabits.\nThe southern cricket frog feeds on insects, spiders, and other arthropods. It is active throughout the year in warm weather.\nReproduction.\nBreeding is in late spring and summer. The advertisement call of the males is a loud rapid \"gick, gick, gick\". Up to 150 eggs are laid at a time, and more than one mass may be produced in a season (Martof \"et al.\" 1980)."

        "text": "Kenneth Wade Hill (born December 14, 1965) is an American former Major League Baseball pitcher. During a 14-year career, he pitched for seven teams between 1988 and 2001. As a member of the Montreal Expos in 1994, he appeared in the All-Star Game and finished the season tied for the National League lead in wins. He pitched in the 1995 World Series as a member of the Cleveland Indians.\nEarly life.\nHill graduated from Lynn Classical High School in 1983 and attended North Adams State College.\nCareer.\nHill signed a contract with the Detroit Tigers on February 14, 1985. He made his professional debut that year for the Gastonia Jets of the Class A South Atlantic League. Hill posted a 3–6 record in 15 appearances (12 starts), with an earned run average of 4.96 in 69 innings.\nHill made 22 appearances (16 starts) for Gastonia in 1986. He posted a 9–5 record and a 2.79 ERA in 122.2 innings. He also made a single start for the Glens Falls Tigers, Detroit's Class AA affiliate, before he and a player to be named later, Mike Laga, were traded to the St. Louis Cardinals organization for Mike Heath on August 10. Before the season ended, Hill posted a 1–2 record in three starts with the Arkansas Travelers, St. Louis's Class AA affiliate.\nHe split the 1987 season between Arkansas and the Class A St. Petersburg Cardinals. Hill made 18 appearances for each team and 12 starts combined. With Arkansas, he posted a 3–5 record and a 5.20 ERA over 53.2 innings. With St. Petersburg, he recorded a 1–3 mark and a 4.17 ERA over 41 innings.\nIn 1988, Hill made 22 starts for Arkansas. He posted a 9–9 record and a 4.92 ERA. He also saw limited action with the Cardinals, making his MLB debut on September 3. In that game, Hill faced the Houston Astros and surrendered a pair of earned runs in three innings. In 4 games (1 start) with the Cardinals, Hill tallied an 0–1 record and a 5.14 ERA in 14 innings.\nHill was called up by the injury-plagued St. Louis Cardinals in 1989. He started well, but soon went downhill. He finished that season 7–15, but with a decent 3.80 ERA. After an ineffective 1990, Hill went 11–10 with a 3.57 ERA in 1991. In November 1991, he was traded to the Montreal Expos for first baseman Andrés Galarraga. It was as a member of these Expos that Hill found his groove.\nIn both 1992 and 1994, Hill won 16 games, going 16–9 with a 2.68 ERA in 1991 and 16–5 with a 3.32 ERA in 1994. Notably, the 1994 season was curtailed on August 12 due to the Major League Baseball strike, stranding him on pace for a 23–7 season. He was also an All-Star in 1994, pitching 2 innings in relief and walking one, and finished second in Cy Young voting to Greg Maddux. He then returned to the Cardinals, where he suffered the same fate he endured in his first stint in St. Louis, winning only 6 games, losing 7, and posting a 5.06 ERA. He was then traded to the Cleveland Indians for minor league prospects David Bell, Rick Heiserman, and Pepe McNeal. He did well for the Indians, going 4–1 in the remainder of the regular season and 2–1 in the postseason.\nHe filed for free agency in the 1995 postseason and was signed by the Texas Rangers. In 1996, he tied for the team lead (along with Bobby Witt) with 16 wins and led the Rangers to the postseason for the first time. In 1997, however, an injury sent him to the disabled list and greatly affected the rest of his playing career. He also played for the Anaheim Angels after being traded there later in 1997 for Jim Leyritz. He performed poorly over the next two years, going 13-17 and finally being relegated to the bullpen in 1999. He was released in August 2000 but signed by the Chicago White Sox, for whom he promptly gave up eight runs in three innings and was released two weeks later.\nHe accepted a non-roster invitation from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2001, and appeared in five games for them before being released on April 19. Hill subsequently signed a contract with the Cincinnati Reds on May 18, but he was released exactly a month later, on June 18. The next day, Hill was signed by the Boston Red Sox, but he did not remain with their organization following the season.\nPersonal life.\nHill currently resides in Keller, Texas. His son, Kenny Hill, was a quarterback at Texas Christian University. His youngest son, Marcus, played baseball for the Southlake Carroll Dragons and plays for the Eastern Kentucky University."

        "text": "Boys' ice hockey is a popular and growing sport in the state of New York. Culturally, ice hockey is a fairly well known sport throughout the state, especially Upstate New York - due in part to its cultural connections with Canada and Southern Ontario. \nNew York State Public High School Athletic Association.\n151 high schools field sanctioned varsity teams competing in the New York State Public High School Athletic Association.\nThe sanctioned teams compete from end of November till mid-March with a maximum number of practices and games. These teams are divided into two divisions, I and II. Each based on strength of program and considered \"rolling\" divisions allowing teams to switch divisions each year. The sanctioned Varsity teams are divided into sections used by every sport under NYSPHSAA; Sections I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, and X. Each section has different sets of rules for eligibility of Catholic teams to participate in the State Tournament. Sections I and VI do not allow Catholic schools to compete for the Public State Tournament.\nNew York State Amateur Hockey Association.\n76 club and non-sanctioned New York High School Hockey teams compete in New York State Amateur Hockey Association.\nNYSAHA is the New York state affiliate of USA Hockey. The \"club\" teams are divided into two divisions, large school and small school. Each section is divided into four regions East, West, Central, and North who all follow the NYSAHA Guidebook for state bound eligibility. The majority of the teams come from Long Island, Broome County, Hudson Valley, and Western New York. The non-sanctioned Club teams are divided into sections used by all amateur hockey teams under the NYSAHA umbrella. NYSAHA has set guidelines on the state bound teams and depending on the number of teams' from each section that are state bound determine how many teams' from each section will attend the three-day state tournament for large and small school tournament. Eight teams participate in three-day state tournament at host-city in a point system to determine the top four teams to compete in semi-finals and then eventually the State championship.\nThe non-sanctioned teams have no official start and stop date and no limit on the minimum and maximum of games. West Section begins league play around the end of November and end the season in March. East, Central, and North sections compete from September till the end of March.\nNYSAHA club teams retain their \"club\" label, though many are branded as high school hockey similar to a traditional varsity team. Due to this, the skill level varies from club to club despite all being \"high school hockey\". NYSAHA clubs vary a lot, with some being more advanced or higher level, while others are played more on the basis of having fun or winning a local championship instead of a state championship. \nState tournament.\nNYSPHSAA, each section has different sets of rules for eligibility of Catholic teams to participate in the State Tournament. Section I and VI do not allow Catholic schools to compete for the Public State Tournament. The Catholic schools from Section I and VI meet in Catholic High School State Athletic Association one game championship. NYSPHSAA has pre-determined state tournament brackets with each section sending one team per section and at-large teams in one-game elimination. The Final Four for Divisions I, and II were played in Utica, New York's Memorial Auditorium for many years until recently when they have been held at the LECOM Harborcenter in Buffalo, New York.\nHistory.\nThough high school hockey in New York can be dated back to the mid-1940s, the first league—called the Northern New York Scholastic Hockey League—was formed in 1948 and comprised teams from Massena, Norfolk, Potsdam and Saranac Lake. One of the League's founders, Don Spotswood, was a 1934 Clarkson College graduate who taught high school mathematics in the then Norfolk School District (today Norwood-Norfolk). Clarkson College, along with St. Lawrence University, were significant influences in the birth of high school hockey in this region.\nBuffalo Explorer High School Club Hockey League was the first club hockey league in Western New York, starting in 1972. Southtowns High School Club Hockey League began in 1974 and Western New York High School Club Hockey League in 1976.\nNYSPHSAA recognized high school hockey starting in 1980 with official state tournament being held. Not every section started at the same time and not every team that was sanctioned was allowed to participate in the sanctioned State tournament. Section VI (Western New York) did not allow its champion to participate until 2001. NYSAHA recognized high school hockey in 1982 but league championship were being held as early as 1972 in Buffalo. NYSAHA divided into two divisions in 2002 as prior to that year, only one championship was awarded.\nIn 2008-09, there was no club state championship. For the 2009-10 season, WNYHSCHL will join AAU.\nNYSPHSAA Boys' Teams (former teams = No Longer Exists/Merged).\n^ Two championships were when Aquinas was a Division II team\n§ Monroe, and Webster as a unified district, did not play under a NYSPHSAA classification."

        "text": "USA Network Thursday Night Baseball aired Major League Baseball (MLB) games on the USA Network from 1979 to 1983.\nBackground.\nIn 1979, 22 teams (all but the Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros, New York Mets, and St. Louis Cardinals) participated in a one-year cable deal with United Artists Television and Columbia Pictures Television, then-owners of the USA Network. The deal involved the airing of a Thursday night \"Game of the Week\" in markets at least 50 miles (80 km) from a major league park. The deal earned Major League Baseball less than $500,000, but led to a new two-year contract for 40–45 games per season. The program ran through the 1983 season.\nWith USA's Thursday night coverage, it ended ABC's Monday night broadcast's position as the exclusive national, prime time television franchise for Major League Baseball.\nCoverage history.\nThe series began April 26, 1979 with a doubleheader: Cleveland at Kansas City (Jim Woods and Bud Harrelson announcing) followed by Baltimore at California (Monte Moore and Maury Wills announcing). The second game of the night was typically broadcast from the West Coast. The games were usually blacked-out in the competing teams' cities. Once in a while, when USA aired a repeat of the telecast late at night, local cities were allowed to show the rerun.\nFrom 1980 to 1981, Jim Woods and Nelson Briles (replacing Bud Harrelson) broadcast the early games, while Monte Moore and Wes Parker (replacing Maury Wills) called the late game.\nIn 1982, doubleheaders did not start until June 17. Prior to the doubleheaders starting, Monte Moore and Wes Parker did the individual game until then. When the doubleheaders finally began, Moore and Parker moved over to the late game for the rest of the year. Meanwhile, Eddie Doucette (replacing Jim Woods) and Nelson Briles were assigned to call the early game.\nUSA continued with the plan of not starting doubleheaders until June in the final year of the package in 1983. Steve Zabriskie and Al Albert filled in for Eddie Doucette in September 1982 (Steve Grad also occasionally substituted) while Albert replaced Doucette for a game or more in 1983.\nUSA's coverage became a casualty of the new $1.2 billion TV contract between Major League Baseball, ABC and NBC beginning in 1984 and lasting through 1989. One of the provisions to the new deal was that local telecasts opposite network games had to be eliminated.\nMemorable moments.\nOne particular game of note was a Los Angeles Dodgers–St. Louis Cardinals game in 1981 (the last game before the strike). The game in question featured Fernando Valenzuela picking up his eighth consecutive win to start the season. Valenzuela gave up a home run in the ninth to tie the game 1–1, but Pedro Guerrero hit one himself in the bottom of the ninth for the win.\nOne year later, during a September 16 game between the San Diego Padres and the San Francisco Giants, Darrell Evans went 3-for-5 with four RBI in Giants' 9–3 victory."

        "text": "Teams from 150 high schools competed as varsity ice hockey teams in Western and Eastern Pennsylvania. Unlike many other high school sport in Pennsylvania, hockey is not run under Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association umbrella. However, Pennsylvania's high school ice hockey is sanctioned by USA Hockey and varsity-level programs are marginally overseen by the NHL Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers organizations through the Penguins Cup and the Flyers Cup. However although it is considered a club it is still a part of the High School as a sport and is affiliated with the school. Some high schools with lower hockey participation may combine with other schools to have sufficient rosters. Most schools with a varsity ice hockey team also field a junior varsity team as well\nFormat.\nVarsity teams are divided into four divisions, AAA, AA, A, and B (Open). Western divisional champions earn a bid to the Penguins Cup playoff tournament. Eastern divisional teams earn a bid by invitation to the Flyers Cup playoff tournament. All varsity teams are eligible except non-pure and second varsity teams.\nState Championship.\nThe Pennsylvania State High School Ice Hockey Championship is awarded through a state tournament. The tournament pits the champions from the Penguins Cup and Flyers Cup with the winners receiving the AAA, AA, or A Pennsylvania Cup. The location changes every year rotating between Western and Eastern cities. Attempts to mirror the PIAA state championships by hosting the games in Hershey, Pennsylvania, lasted a single season, with only the 2005 series being held at the historic Hersheypark Arena. Starting in 2014 the state championship is now being playing at Pegula Ice Arena The first Pennsylvania Cup was held at the University of Pennsylvania's Class of 1923 Ice Rink under the auspices of The Philadelphia Flyers \"Hockey Central\" organization. USA Hockey's Mid America Director Frank Black and The Flyers' Andy Abramson organized the championship, after Flyers President Robert \"Bob\" J. Butera and Penguins EVP Paul Martha agreed to sponsor the event annually.\n in State College, PA.\nAlumni.\nNotable professional players that have participated in Pennsylvania high school hockey include Chad Kolarik, Colby Cohen, Brian O'Neill, Ray Dilauro, Mike Richter, Ryan Malone, R.J. Umberger, Mike Weber, Nick Foligno, Eric Tangradi, Nate Guenin, Brandon Saad, Dylan Reese, Shane Ferguson, Matt Bartkowski, John Zeiler, Christian Hanson, William Thomas, Grant Lewis, Tony Voce, Ray Staszak, Matt Clackson, Rob Madore, Ryan Mulhern, John Gibson and Ryan Gunderson. The state has also produced alumni that went on to play minor professional and elite collegiate levels.\nDivisions.\nWhile the western part of the state has been divided into fairly equal levels at the AAA, AA, and A levels, the eastern part has mostly been run by the independent leagues that compete for Flyers Cup. A change was made recently in an effort to provide more uniformity throughout the eastern portion of the state. Whereas the levels were previously determined by where a team finished in its respective leagues, the Flyers Cup recently restructured the system were AAA is all open enrollment schools, AA is the larger public schools, and A is the smaller public schools. The open enrollment schools are not forced to play AAA, but if they do not they cannot qualify for the Flyers Cup. Changes are still being proposed for the 2008–2009 season that could create a second varsity level for open enrollment schools that do not wish to play at the AAA level.\nLeagues.\nWestern PA.\n\"(note: teams from West Virginia also play in PIHL.)\""

        "text": "Rope climbing is a sport in which competitors attempt to climb up a suspended vertical rope using only their hands. Rope climbing is practiced regularly at the World Police and Fire Games, and is enjoying a resurgence in France, where competitions are held in shopping centers. Also, enthusiasts in the Czech Republic resurrected the sport in 1993, and hold local and national competitions.\nHistory and description of the event.\nThis was an Olympic gymnastic event at one time, but was removed from that venue after the 1932 games. In the United States, competitive climbing on both 20 ft and 25 ft, natural fiber ropes was sanctioned by both the AAU and the NCAA until the early 1960s, when these organizations dropped the events. As a result, intercollegiate competition in the U.S. disappeared at this time. In Olympic games held in the U.S., competitors climbed a 25 ft (7.62m) rope, but when post-1896 games were held in Europe, an 8 m (26.3 ft) rope was used. In almost all contests, athletes climbed for speed, starting from a seated position on the floor and using only the hands and arms. Kicking the legs in a kind of \"stride\" was normally permitted. However, at the 1896 Olympic games, competitors were ranked by both time and style (holding an L-position) on a rope so long (15 meters) that some climbers did not reach the top and were therefore excluded. In all succeeding Olympics through the 1932 games, competitors were judged strictly by the time of ascent on a shorter rope.\nAt the top of the climb, there was a circular tambourine with lampblack on its underside, which the climber touched. Several timers with stop watches timed the climb, and an acceptable official time was then agreed upon. Before the event expired in America, an electronic means of timing the climb was developed, but this was an insufficient reason to continue an activity conducted at gymnastic meets that many artistic gymnasts thought should have been relegated to the track and field arena. The world record for the 20 foot climb was 2.8 seconds, first achieved by the American Don Perry in the 1950s."

        "title": "Super League Grand Final",
        "text": "The Super League Grand Final is the championship-deciding game of rugby league's Super League competition. It is played between two teams who have qualified via the Super League Play-Off series. The winning team receives the Super League Trophy and goes on to play the NRL champions in the World Club Challenge. The Harry Sunderland Trophy is awarded to the man of the match. The match is normally played at Old Trafford in Greater Manchester.\nOnly four clubs have won the Super League, as of 2023 - St Helens (9), Leeds Rhinos (8), Wigan Warriors (6), and Bradford Bulls (3).\n(St Helens and Bradford Bulls each won one of their Super League titles before the Play Off and Grand Final system was introduced in 1998).\nWigan Warriors are the current champions, after winning the 2023 Super League Grand Final, defeating Catalans Dragons 10–2, who also become the first ever team to have 2 or more players sin binned in the grand final.\nBackground.\nUse of a play-off system to decide the Championship brought back a rugby league tradition that had fallen out of use in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The Premiership replaced the Championship final but it was to decide the Premiership winners, not the Championship winners. The Premiership was discontinued after the introduction of the Super League play-off series in 1998, ending with the Super League Grand Final. The inaugural Grand Final match was played that year on Saturday 24 October, between Wigan and Leeds.\nVenue.\nThe Grand Final has been held at Old Trafford in Manchester every year since 1998, except in 2020, when it was held at the KCOM Stadium in Hull due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTrophy.\nThe winners of the Super League collect the Grand Final rings and the team's name, captain and year are engraved into the trophy. The winners also collect £100,000 with the runner up collecting £50,000.\nLeeds captain Kevin Sinfield currently holds the record for captaining the most Super League title winning sides after leading Leeds to seven of their Grand Final successes. St Helens contested the final six years in a row (from 2006 until 2011) during which time they succeeded only once in lifting the trophy, against Hull F.C. in 2006, after which they suffered consecutive defeats against Leeds in 2007, 2008, 2009, Wigan in 2010 and Leeds once again in 2011.\nAwards.\nThe Harry Sunderland Trophy is awarded to the Man-of-the-Match in the Super League Grand Final by the Rugby League Writers' Association. Named after Harry Sunderland, who was an Australian rugby league football administrator in both Australia and the United Kingdom, the Trophy was first awarded in the Rugby Football League Championship Final of the 1964–65 season following Sunderland's death.\nFinals.\nThe Super League Grand Final has been the championship-deciding game since Super League III in 1998: This final is held at Old Trafford.\nThe Double.\nIn rugby league, the term 'the Double' is referring to the achievement of a club that wins the top division and Challenge Cup in the same season. To date, this has been achieved by ten clubs, four of them during the Super League era.\nThe Treble.\nThe \"Treble\" refers to the team who wins all three domestic honours on offer during the season; Grand Final, League Leaders' Shield and Challenge Cup. To date seven teams have won the treble, only Bradford Bulls, St Helens and Leeds Rhinos have won the treble in the Super League era.\nThe Quadruple.\nThe Quadruple refers to winning the Super League, League Leaders' Shield, Challenge Cup and World Club Challenge in one season."

The event was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, and was the eighth consecutive World Snooker Championship to be held at the Crucible since the 1977 event. The event featured 94 participants, of which 78 players competed in a qualifying event held at the Redwood Lodge in Bristol from 1 to 13 April. Of these, 16 players qualified for the main stage in Sheffield, where they met 16 invited seeds. The total prize fund for the event was £200,000, the highest total pool for any snooker tournament at that time; the winner received £44,000.\nThe defending champion was English player Steve Davis, who had won the title twice previously. He met fellow-countryman Jimmy White in the final, which was played as a best-of-35- match. Davis took a significant lead of 12–4 after the first two sessions; although White battled back into the match, Davis eventually won 18–16, becoming the first player to retain the title at the Crucible. Rex Williams secured the championship's highest , scoring a 138 in the 12th frame of his first-round loss to White. Eight were made during the competition, the fewest since the 1978 event. The tournament was sponsored by cigarette manufacturer Embassy, and broadcast by BBC.\nTournament format.\nThe 1984 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament that took place between 21 April and 7 May 1984 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The event was the 1984 edition of the World Snooker Championship, which was first held in 1927. It was the last ranking event of the 1984–85 snooker season on the World Snooker Tour. The event was organised by World Snooker and the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). There were a total of 94 entrants from the tour, with one player withdrawing, and the competition's main draw had 32 participants. A three-round knockout qualifying competition with 78 players was held from 1 to 13 April, producing the 16 qualifying players who progressed into the main draw to play the top 16 seeds.\nThe top 16 players in the latest world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. As defending champion, Steve Davis was seeded first for the event; the remaining 15 were allocated based on world rankings for the previous season. Matches in the first round of the main draw were played as best-of-19-frames. The number of frames needed to win a match increased to 13 in the second round and quarter-finals, and 16 in the semi-finals; the final match was played as best-of-35-frames.\nThe tournament was televised on BBC in the United Kingdom. During the last session of the final, the number of viewers varied from 6.3 million (when popular soap opera \"Coronation Street\" aired on ITV) to a peak of 13.1 million in the last 15 minutes of the match. The world number five Alex Higgins provided commentary on selected matches.\nPrize fund.\nThe prize fund for the event was the largest for any snooker tournament to that date, at £200,000 with the winner receiving £44,000. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nSummary.\nQualifying.\nA 78-competitor qualifying tournament for the event was held at Redwood Lodge in Bristol, from 1 April to 14 April 1984. The players were divided into 16 groups, with matches played on a knockout basis to produce 16 qualifiers. All qualifying matches were the best-of-19-. Tommy Murphy made two breaks of 108 in his first round defeat of Jack Fitzmaurice, two weeks after his win over Fitzmaurice in the World Professional Billiards Championship. John Parrott progressed after winning three rounds, beating Dennis Hughes 10–3, Clive Everton 10–2 and the 1978 World Snooker Championship runner-up Perrie Mans 10–0. Neal Foulds, aged 20, the British junior snooker champion, also won three matches to make his Crucible debut, defeating Doug French 10–5, Les Dodd 10–4 and Jim Meadowcroft 10–2.\nEight-time former world champion Fred Davis won his match against Jim Donnelly 10–5. Canadian John Bear, was scheduled to play but did not, and Roy Andrewartha received a walkover for the match. Mike Watterson, who as promoter of the world championship from 1977 to 1983 had first selected the Crucible as the tournament venue, defeated Bernard Bennett 10–5 in the first round before losing 8–10 to Warren King. Losers in the qualifying rounds received £450. Andrewartha, Foulds, Parrott, King, Marcel Gauvreau, Joe Johnson, Paul Mifsud, Mario Morra, and Eddie Sinclair made their World Championship debuts in qualifying.\nFirst round.\nThe first round took place from 21 to 26 April. The matches were contested between the seeded players and qualifiers with each played over two sessions as best-of-19 frames. David Taylor, who was trailing 3–5 to Marcel Gauvreau after their first session, won seven frames in a row to win 10–5 and gain his first ranking points of the season. Roy Andrewartha, a time and motion analyst who played professional snooker part-time, lost 4–10 to Eddie Charlton. Neal Foulds took the last three frames of their first session to lead former world champion Alex Higgins 5–3, and having the more consistent long potting in the match, won 10–9 after the scores had been level at 7–7.\nSilvino Francisco defeated Tony Meo, who to that point had been the fourth-highest earner on the snooker circuit that season, 10–5. Willie Thorne defeated John Virgo for the second consecutive world championship. Virgo's defeat came at the end of a season in which he failed to win any ranking points, and he dropped out of the top 16, to 18th. Eight-time champion Fred Davis made his last appearance at the World Championships, losing 4–10 to Bill Werbeniuk in the first round. Davis had first played in the World Championship in 1937. Aged 70 years and 253 days, he became the tournament's oldest-ever player.\nMany of the matches had one-sided scorelines. Dennis Taylor and Kirk Stevens both won 10–1; Terry Griffiths won 10–2; Steve Davis, John Spencer and Cliff Thorburn won 10–3; and Bill Werbeniuk, Doug Mountjoy and Eddie Charlton won 10–4. Four of the top 16 seeded players lost in the first round: Tony Knowles (fourth seed), Alex Higgins (fifth), John Virgo (fourteenth) and Tony Meo (fifteenth).\nKnowles, who had been the only player to beat Steve Davis in the World Championship in the previous three years, lost 7–10 to John Parrott. Knowles had recently featured in a three-part series in the tabloid newspaper \"The Sun\", where he boasted of his sexual adventures and was dismissive of most other competitors in the tournament. The articles led to Knowles being fined £5,000, imposed by the WPBSA for bringing the sport into disrepute.\nIn the other matches, second seed Ray Reardon beat Jim Wych 10–7, and Jimmy White beat Rex Williams 10–6. Williams made the first break of the tournament in the 12th frame, a total clearance of 138, the highest break of the tournament.

White made breaks of 80, 79, 44, 61, 34, and 82 to lead 10–6 and went on to win 13–7. Griffiths beat Werbeniuk 13–5.\nDennis Taylor led Parrott 11–7, before Parrott won four frames in a row to level at 11–11. Taylor, who was the more consistent potter during the match, took the next two to win 13–11. Thorburn and Thorne contested a tight match that Thorburn won 13–11. From 9–9 against David Taylor, Stevens scored three breaks of over 50 to win the match 13–10. Neal Foulds led Doug Mountjoy 3–1, but ended up losing 6–13.\nReardon, having his least successful season in 17 years as a snooker professional, made a 109 break in the eighth frame to lead 5–3 at the end of the first session against Francisco. The score was tied at 8–8 after the second session. In the last session, Francisco was ahead, but under-hit when trying to pot the . This left Reardon needing one rather than three; Francisco , giving Reardon the additional points required. Reardon went on to win the frame on a after Francisco failed the pot and left the black ball over the of a . From 9–8, Reardon won four frames in a row to win the match 13–8.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were scheduled to each be played over three sessions, on 1 and 2 May, as best-of-25-frames matches. Steve Davis won the first three frames of his match against Terry Griffiths, but Griffiths won the next five frames to lead 5–3. Griffiths then won the first frame of the second session to lead 6–3. Davis, however, pulled back to level the match at 6–6, and the second session ended tied at 8–8. Davis won five of the seven frames in the third session to win 13–10 in a highly technical and safety-oriented match.\nStevens and Reardon's first session finished a frame early, with Reardon commenting that he \"was glad it was over\" having only won a single frame. Reardon won just the first and ninth frames as Stevens defeated him convincingly, 13–2, with a . Stevens set up a semi-final with Jimmy White, who had defeated Cliff Thorburn 13–8. White led 10-6 after the second session, before moving to 12-7 ahead. White went 63 points ahead in frame 20, but Thorburn made a clearance of 64 to win the frame, before White won the match in frame 21. Dennis Taylor defeated Doug Mountjoy, also 13–8, to move into the other semi-final, against Davis.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were scheduled to each be played over four sessions, on 3, 4 and 5 May, as best-of-31-frames matches. Steve Davis led Dennis Taylor 4–3 at the end of their first session, with Taylor winning two of his three frames on the final . Davis won the next three frames to lead 7–3 before Taylor won frames 11 and 12. On a break of 64, Taylor missed a red ball, allowing Davis to make a break of 65 to win the next frame and then make a break of 76 lead 9–5 lead at the end of their second session. Taylor won just one of the first five frames in the third session; Davis lead 13–6, but Taylor won the next two frames to avoid losing with a session to spare. Leading 14–8, Davis won three frames to Taylor's one in their last session to win 16–9.\nIn the other match, Stevens won the opening frame despite needing snookers, but White won the next three to lead 3–1 before the mid-session interval. At this time, White was \"violently sick\", having celebrated his 22nd birthday the night before. White took a 5–3 lead after the first session, also leaving to be sick after making a break of 85 in frame five. White attributed his illness to some sandwiches he had eaten and some cough syrup he had used to recover from a throat infection. The first seven frames of the second session was played in just 90 minutes as Stevens tied the match at 6–6, and then led 8–7 after their second session. Stevens won the next three frames to lead by four with White faltering. White, however, won the next three before Stevens won the final frame of the third session to lead 12–10. White won five frames in a row after Stevens missed a frame ball red in frame 23 to lead 15–12. Just one frame from defeat, Stevens won the next two frames, but White won frame 30 with a break of 44. The match finished 16–14, with White becoming the youngest player to reach a professional snooker World Championship final.\nFinal.\nThe final was played over four sessions, on 6 and 7 May, as a best-of-35-frames match between Steve Davis and Jimmy White. English referee Jim Thorpe presided over the match, taking charge of his third Triple Crown final, after two prior UK Championship finals in 1980 and 1984.\nDavis dominated the first session to lead 6–1. He then extended the lead by winning the first two frames of the second session with breaks of 41, 37 and 44. White won the next frame with two breaks over 50, but was 10–2 behind at the mid-session interval. White won the next two frames, but went in frame 15, which he lost. Davis won the next frame to extend his lead to 12–4 at the end of the second session. On the second day, White fought back to 11–13 by winning seven of the eight frames in the third session. In 2020, Davis commented that he had gone \"into [his] shell\" after leading by so much overnight. The first frame he made a break of 119 which was the second-highest of the tournament. Davis started the final session by winning three of the first four frames to lead 16–12. White then won the next three to put himself just one behind at 15–16. Davis won a close frame by clearing the colours to lead 17–15, then White took the next with a break of 65 to reduce his deficit to 16–17. Davis took the last frame 77–40 to win 18–16 and become the first player to retain the championship at the Crucible.\nThe victory was Davis' third world championship, having previously won in 1981 and 1983. White's loss was the first of six world championship final defeats. He was the youngest player to compete in a world championship final; however, by losing the match he missed his chance to supersede Alex Higgins as the youngest-ever winner. Davis received £44,000 for winning the tournament, taking his prize money for the 1983–84 season to £159,511, more than double that of the second-highest earner, White, who made £78,725. When the world rankings were updated following the tournament, Davis was in first place; White was seventh, earning eight of his seventeen ranking points from being the championship runner-up.\nDavis received boos and jeers from the crowd after defeating the popular White. Davis commented that White had outplayed him on the final day of the final and had \"played his brains out\". Davis would reach the final again for the following two years, and win a further three championships throughout the 1980s. White, however, stated that he played poorly on the first day of the final because of the lengthy semi-final win over Stevens. This was the first of, as of 2020, six world championship finals that White would lose. Despite this, White was confident that he would win the championship in the following years. White later recounted that he had used crack cocaine to cope with the loss, claiming to have spent £32,000 on the drug over a three-month period.\nQualifying.\nA three-round knockout qualifying competition was held from 1 to 13 April at the Redwood Lodge in Bristol, producing the 16 qualifying players who progressed into the main draw to play the top 16 seeds.

        "text": "James Erigena Barrett (March 28, 1875 – October 24, 1921) was a Major League Baseball (MLB) center fielder. A native of Athol, Massachusetts, he batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Barrett played 10 seasons in the major leagues with the Cincinnati Reds (1899–1900, 1906), Detroit Tigers (1901–05), and Boston Red Sox (1907–08). Barrett was the first star for the Tigers, playing for the Tigers in the first five years of their existence. He left the Tigers with the arrival of a new center fielder Ty Cobb. Barrett had a career batting average of .291 (21 points higher than the league average during the deadball years in which he played). He also had a career on-base percentage of .379. In 1903 and 1904, he led the American League in times on base and walks. Despite Barrett's having played in only 866 major league games, baseball historian, Bill James, ranks Barrett as the 72nd best center fielder of all time.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Athol, Massachusetts, Barrett served in the U.S. Army from 1894 to 1896. Barrett joined the company baseball team, playing shortstop for three years.\nIn 1899, Barrett played for the Detroit team in the Western Association before being sold to the Cincinnati Reds in August 1899. In one month with the Reds in 1899, Barrett hit for a .370 batting average, .477 on-base percentage, and .478 slugging percentage. Barrett never matched those numbers again, but continued to be one of the better hitters of his time. In 1900, he hit .316, with a .400 on-base percentage and had career highs with 172 hits, 114 runs and 44 stolen bases (both 3rd best in the National League).\nDetroit Tigers (1901–1905).\nIn 1901, Barrett jumped to the new American League, signing with the Detroit Tigers. Barrett was the star of the Tigers team in the first five years of the franchise's history from 1901 to 1905. In 1901, Barrett was among the league leaders in the American League's inaugural season in runs scored with 110 (fifth), bases on balls with 76 (third), on-base percentage at .385 (ninth), times on base with 240 (fourth), and plate appearances with 630 (fourth).\nBarrett continued to rank among the best batters in the American League each year from 1901 to 1904. His .397 on-base percentage in 1902 was fourth highest in the league. In 1903, arguably his best season, Barrett led the league with a .407 on-base percentage, 74 bases on balls, and 243 times on base.\nIn the 1904 season, despite a 154-game schedule, Barrett became the first major league player to appear in 162 games after Detroit set a season record with 10 tie games. His record for games played was unmatched until the schedules increased to 162 games in 1961. In 1904, Barrett also led the American League with 79 bases on balls and 249 times on base.\nBarrett was also an excellent fielder. He had a strong arm and led all American League outfielders in assists in three of the first four American League seasons. From 1900 to 1904, Barrett racked up an impressive total of 126 assists, including 31 in 1901 and 29 in 1904. He also led American League outfielders in putouts in 1902 (326) and 1904 (339). His range factor score was markedly above the league average from 1900 to 1904, including 1902 when his 2.56 range factor score was 0.52 points above the league average.\nDuring the 1903 and 1904 seasons, Barrett clashed with Detroit manager, Ed Barrow. In his autobiography, \"My Fifty Years in Baseball\", Barrow wrote that he never got along with Barrett. When Detroit owner, Frank Navin, blocked Barrow's efforts to trade the star center fielder, Barrow quit. Barrow wrote that, on one occasion, Barrett complained to Barrow that \"your methods take all the individuality away from a ballplayer.\" Barrow responded, \"Young man, if you ever speak to me that way again I will take more than your individuality away from you. I will knock your block off.\"\nIn 1905, Barrow was gone as the Tigers' manager, but a leg injury slowed Barrett and resulted in his appearing in only 20 games. When Ty Cobb joined the Tigers in August, Barrett faced a new threat. Detroit's new manager Bill Armour introduced Cobb to Barrett. He told Cobb that Barrett's \"knee was on the bum, and I'm using you in his place in center field. Barrett was given the task of teaching Cobb the team's signs, which included a system Barrett had developed in 1905 for stealing the opponents' signs. Cobb wrote in his autobiography that the injured Barrett would sit in the center field stands with a pair of spyglasses \"strong enough to pick out the fillings in the opposition catcher's teeth.\" Barrett would then relay the signs to the batter using markings on a fence sign advertising \"The Detroit News\".\nAs Cobb proved his potential in 1905, Barrett became expendable. Barrett began to resent the young Cobb, who was a clear threat to his job. In early 1906, the Tigers sold Barrett back to the Cincinnati Reds, where he played in only five games.\nLater years.\nBarrett spent his final two seasons in the major leagues playing for the Boston Red Sox in 1907 and 1908. However, he was never the same either as a batter or a fielder. He hit .244 in 1907 and dropped to .125 in 1908. He played his final major league game on May 13, 1908. A knee injury ended his career prematurely.\nHe became a senior partner in the real estate firm of Barrett &amp; Walsh in Detroit. Barrett died from \"a stroke of apoplexy\" (for the avoidance of doubt, apoplexy is an outdated medical term) at his office in October 1921 at age 46. He was buried in Detroit's Mount Olivet Cemetery."

        "text": "The 1983 World Snooker Championship (also known as the 1983 Embassy World Snooker Championship for the purposes of sponsorship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place between 16 April and 2 May 1983 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. This was the third and final world ranking event of the 1982–83 snooker season following the 1982 Professional Players Tournament. Sixteen seeded players qualified directly for the event, with an additional sixteen players progressing through a two-round qualification round held at the Romiley Forum in Stockport, and Redwood Lodge in Bristol. The winner of the event received £30,000, and the tournament was sponsored by cigarette company Embassy.\nAlex Higgins was the defending champion, having won the 1982 championship, but he lost 5–16 to Steve Davis in the semi-finals. Davis, the 1981 champion, won the event for the second time, defeating Cliff Thorburn 18–6 in the final. A total of 18 century breaks were made during the tournament. The highest was made by Thorburn in the fourth of his second round match against Terry Griffiths, where he compiled a maximum break of 147 points, becoming the first player to make such a break in a World Championship match.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional snooker tournament and the game's official world championship. Developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, snooker was popular in the United Kingdom before being introduced to Europe and the Commonwealth. The sport is now played worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nThe 1983 Championship was organised and governed by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). It featured 32 professional players competing in one-on-one single-elimination matches, played over several . The players were selected to take part using a combination of the world snooker rankings and a pre-tournament qualification tournament. The first World Championship, in 1927, was won by Joe Davis in a final at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the tournament has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The defending champion for 1983 was Alex Higgins, who defeated Ray Reardon 18–15 in the 1982 championship final. The tournament was sponsored by cigarette company Embassy, and broadcast on BBC television.\nPrize fund.\nThe winner of the event received a prize of £30,000, the highest amount ever awarded for a snooker tournament up to that point. A breakdown of prize money for this tournament is shown below: \nSummary.\nQualifying.\nA two-round qualification tournament was held in March and April across three venues: at the Snooker Centre in Sheffield, Romiley Forum in Stockport, and Redwood Lodge, Bristol. In round one, Mario Morra was 4–9 behind Ian Black, but won five frames to equalise at 9–9. In the deciding frame, Morra made a 51 break, but Black replied with a 37 to win the frame and the match with just two balls remaining. Black compiled a 108 break against Paul Medati in the sixth fame of their second qualifying round, and won seven of the next eight frames to qualify for the main draw with a 10–4 win. Eddie Sinclair recorded a 112 break during a decisive 10–2 defeat of Colin Roscoe. In the second round, Sinclair played Eugene Hughes and led 5–4 after making six breaks over 40. He later won the match 10–8 after making breaks of 99 and 54 in the final two frames. Patsy Fagan failed to qualify for the main draw for the first time in his career, losing 8–10 to Mick Fisher. Les Dodd won a long match against Ian Williamson that concluded at 1:10 am with Dodd winning the deciding frame. Dodd had received a walkover in the first qualifying round after John Dunning did not appear for their match.\nSnooker veteran Pat Houlihan took a 7–1 lead against Tommy Murphy, but Murphy won seven of the next eight to bring the match to 8–8. Houlihan won the 17th frame, but Murphy took the next two frames with breaks of 52 and 71, allowing him to progress to the next round. Murphy then lost 8–10 to John Virgo after leading 8–7. Virgo made a break of 101 in the 13th frame. Tony Meo defeated Vic Harris 10–0, and then defeated Geoff Foulds 10–4 to qualify. The tournament's promoter, Mike Watterson lost 6–10 to John Campbell. The reigning world billiards champion, Rex Williams, lost just one frame in qualifying, securing a 10–0 whitewash over Mike Darrington and then defeating Fred Davis 10–1.\nMark Wildman won 10–7 against Bob Harris in the first round and qualified directly for the main draw, receiving a walkover as Jim Wych (who had received a bye into the second round) had not travelled from Canada for the match. Cliff Wilson faced Joe Johnson in the second round, a rematch of the 1978 World Amateur Snooker Championship final. In the first round, Wilson had lost only one frame against Clive Everton, whilst Johnson had whitewashed Paul Watchorn. Wilson won against Johnson 10–8.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played between 16 and 22 April with best-of-19-frame matches held over two . Steve Davis was Coral bookmakers' favourite to win the event, priced at 11/8 the day before the tournament began. Terry Griffiths was the second-favourite at 7/1, with Reardon and defending champion Higgins at 8/1. Davis had won four individual tournaments during the season leading up to the competition, whilst Reardon had claimed three titles, and Higgins's only notable success had been in the 1983 Irish Professional Championship. Higgins led Dean Reynolds, 5–1 and finished their first session 6–3 ahead. He then increased his lead to 8–3, before he won the match 10–4. Willie Thorne took a 6–3 lead over Virgo and won the first four frames of their second session to complete a 10–3 victory.\nHaving built a 6–3 advantage over Dave Martin in their first session, Canadian Bill Werbeniuk won 10–4. Jim Meadowcroft made a highest break of just 36 as he was defeated 2–10 by David Taylor. Eddie Charlton completed a 10–7 victory against Dodd after ending their first session 5–3 in front. Three-time former winner John Spencer defeated Mike Hallett 10–7 in a closely contested match. Dennis Taylor wore glasses that he later credited for winning the event two years later. He won the last three frames of his match to defeat Silvino Francisco 10–9. Davis took a 6–0 lead over Williams, but Williams reduced the deficit by winning the next three frames. In their second session, Davis won three of the first four frames to complete a 10–4 victory.\nThorburn had a single-frame lead against Campbell after their first session and won 10–5, despite suffering from influenza symptoms. The 1979 champion Griffiths trailed Wildman 7–8 but won the final three frames to secure a 10–8 victory. In an attacking match, Meo defeated his childhood friend Jimmy White 10–8 having led 6–3 after the first session. White was the only one of the top 16 seeds to lose in the first round. Doug Mountjoy won 10–2 against Wilson, and Kirk Stevens defeated Fisher by the same margin. Reardon, having been 5–4 in front overnight, prevailed 10–7 against Hughes in a match that featured few breaks higher than 30. Perrie Mans and Tony Knowles both progressed with 10–3 wins, over Black and Miles respectively.\nSecond round.\nThe second round was played between 21 and 26 April as the best-of-25-frame matches held over three sessions. Higgins lost the first two frames against Thorne, and in the third frame accused Thorne of making a deliberate miss. Thorne commented that Higgins had accused him of being a cheat, which Higgins denied, although he later said Thorne \"hadn't been very sporting\". Higgins won the frame, and led Thorne 5–3 by the end of the session. Thorne equalised at 7–7 by the end of the second session. From there, Thorne won only one further frame as Higgins took the match 13–8.\nDavid Taylor led Werbeniuk 10–6 after two sessions, but lost 10–13 after Werbeniuk won seven consecutive frames. Dennis Taylor was a frame ahead of Davis, at 4–3 after their first session, but Davis emerged as the winner, 13–11. Stevens compiled a break of 139 in the second frame against Mans, and went on to take a 7–1 lead after the first session and win 13–3 in two sessions. In a session of slow play, Charlton moved from 9–7 against Spencer to take their match 13–11. Knowles led Reardon 9–7 and, after Reardon had equalised at 11–11 and 12–12, defeated him with a break of 66 in the deciding frame. Meo gained a 5–3 lead over Mountjoy after their first session and went on to win 13–11.\nThe final session of the match between Thorburn and Griffiths lasted more than seven hours and finished at 3:51 am, which, at the end of the 2019 Championship, still stood as the latest finish for a snooker match at the Crucible, and at 6 hours and 25 minutes, the longest session. Thorburn achieved the first maximum break at a World Snooker Championship in the fourth frame. He was only the second player after Davis at the 1982 Classic to make an official maximum. The break started with Thorburn a . While he was completing the break, play stopped on the tournament's second table because his friend and fellow Canadian Werbeniuk wanted to watch.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played between 25 and 27 April as the best-of-25 frames held over three sessions. Charlton compiled a break of 115 in his match against Davis, but Davis took a 5–3 lead into their second session, and then won six of the next eight frames. Davis claimed the first two frames of the final session to complete a 13–5 victory.\nHiggins made a break of 109 in the first frame against Werbeniuk, and won the next on the final . At 46 points ahead in the third frame, Higgins attempted to play a behind the pink and was annoyed by referee John Williams, who awarded a against him as the cue ball had not touched the pink. After protestations from Higgins, Williams asked the match scorers for a second opinion, and the decision stood. Werbeniuk then made a break of 57 and won the frame. Higgins said that he wanted a change of referee, and threatened to walk out, but following a discussion with tournament promoter Mike Watterson, agreed to return. He won the following two frames, but lost the next after going while playing a shot on the pink. Werbeniuk won that frame and the next, leaving the scores tied at 4–4 at the end of their first session. Werbeniuk took a 9–7 lead by the end on the next session, but Higgins started the third session by winning three consecutive frames. Werbeniuk recorded a break of 109 to level at 11–11, but Higgins won the next two frames to take the match 13–11.\nKnowles won the first five frames against Meo and led 6–2 after their first session, before winning 13–9. Thorburn took a 4–0 lead over Stevens, and was 5–3 ahead at the end of their first session. Stevens had led 12–10, but Thorburn won 13–12, with the final session finishing at 2:12 am. As of 2019, this was still the second-longest session (at 6 hours and 11 minutes), and the third-latest finish, since the World Snooker Championship has been held at the Crucible.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played between 28 and 30 April as best-of-31-frame matches scheduled over four sessions. Davis won the first session against Higgins 5–2, and also took the first four frames the following day, making a break of 103 in the opening frame of the second session, to extend his lead to 9–2. At the mid-session interval, the Crucible Theatre was evacuated due to a death threat against Davis that had been telephoned to the venue, saying that he would be shot if he won a tenth frame. After an hour-long police search, the audience was readmitted and the match resumed. Davis was 10–4 ahead at the end of the first day. On the second day of their match, Davis compiled a break of 90 to make his lead 11–4. Higgins replied with a break of 74 to reduce his deficit to 5–11, but Davis then won the next five frames to take the match 16–5.\nKnowles led Thorburn 5–3 at the end of their first session before Thorburn levelled the match at both 5–5 and 7–7. Knowles led 8–7 at the end of the second session. Thorburn took the first two frames of the third session, to gain the lead. The players were again equal at 10–10 before Thorburn moved 12–10 ahead at the end of the third session. Knowles won the next two frames after lengthy tactical exchanges, and then took a 13–12 lead with a break of 74. Knowles was within a frame of reaching the final at 15–13, but Thorburn won the next two to force a deciding frame. After Knowles missed a red, Thorburn went on to win the frame, and the match 16–15. Due to the length of the frames, the semi-final finished at 12:45 am.\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 1 and 2 May between Thorburn and Davis as the best of 35 frames, scheduled to be held over four sessions. It was Thorburn's third appearance in a World Championship final, after he had been runner-up in 1977 and champion in 1980. For Davis, it was the second world final, two years after his victory in 1981. At 2–2 after the first four frames, Davis won four in a row to lead 6–2. He increased his advantage to 9–2 at the start of the second session as Thorburn made several errors, including missing a pot on a red when using the , an unsuccessful attempt to a red, and an easy half-ball shot. Thorburn then won two frames, but Davis still finished the first day 12–5 ahead.\nOn the second day, Davis won the first frame on the black ball after Thorburn had missed a shot on the pink to win the frame. Thorburn missed several attempted pots in the second frame of the session, and Davis won this frame too, following it with a break of 59 in winning the third frame, and taking the fourth after another missed pot attempt from Thorburn. After the mid-session interval, Davis compiled a break of 131 in the 22nd frame to leave him one frame from victory at 17–5. Thorburn won one further frame, before Davis achieved victory at 18–6. This was the first final at the Crucible to be completed with a . The concluding frame was won on a . Thorburn was exhausted during the final after winning his last three matches in deciding frames, according to Everton. He played 14 hours more than Davis throughout the tournament. Snooker historian Clive Everton commented that the long matches Thorburn had played earlier in the tournament \"left him so drained ... that he was able to offer only token resistance.\" Davis became the first player to win the event for a second time at the Crucible.\nDavis thanked his family in his post-match speech, and said that his father, and his coach Frank Callan, were the only two people that could help him with snooker. An emotional Davis also offered his commiserations to Thorburn, and said that \"he has had a lot of hard things happening to him and I want to thank him for a great final.\" Thorburn commented on the match, \"I know what purgatory is like now. I tried like hell, but it was too hard for me to win.\" The £30,000 prize money brought Davis's winnings from tournaments to more than £80,000 for the season, with his expected earnings for the following year being estimated at £750,000, including income from sponsorship deals, and from charging £3,000 for playing exhibition matches.\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for the tournament. The numbers in brackets are players seedings, whilst those in bold denote match winners.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was played over two rounds both played as the best-of-19 frames in March and April. The 16 players qualifying for the event met a seeded player in the main competition. Players in bold denote match winners.\nCentury breaks.\nThere were 18 century breaks compiled during the championship, a record which stood until 1986. The highest of the event was a maximum break of 147 made by Thorburn, earning a £5,000 bonus."

Another regular feature has two animated characters (\"Willow and \"Stumpy\") explaining unusual rules or jargon. 'Champagne Cork' features Hampshire's Dominic Cork looking back at the best moments of the past seven days, also there is a Stat of the Week, presented by the Sky Sport Statistician Benedict Bermange, while one of the Sky Sports commentary team is sitting behind him looking distinctly unimpressed.\nThe show mirrors \"Soccer AM\" very closely in many regards; the \"Luther Blissett Stand\" was renamed as the Gary Pratt cricket pavilion, (2006). It was subsequently renamed as the Dwayne Leverock (2007) and the Jesse Ryder Pavilion for the 2008 season. In 2011, it has been renamed the Douglas Jardine Pavilion. The pavilion is filled by the members of a club cricket team, who compete in a bowl-out in the outdoor car park at the end of the show. \"Throw Time\", a feature in which county cricket teams were visited and contested to throw a ball at the stumps with their \"wrong\" hand, closely resembled \"Soccer AM\"'s \"Crossbar Challenge\".\nIn 2009, two weekly features called 'Ultimate Sportsman' and 'Brain + Brawn' were introduced. In 'Ultimate Sportsman', three county professionals all from the same team compete to become the ultimate sportsman. A penalty shootout, a golf pitching challenge and a 3 dart throw are completed, and the player with the most points after this is the winner. In 'Brain + Brawn', two players from the same team attempt to score as many points as possible. One player has to answer quiz questions, while the other must hold a 5 kg dumbbell with their arm straight and horizontal to the body. Time ends when the weight cannot be held for any longer."

        "title": "Rugby union in Italy",
        "text": " \nRugby union in Italy is governed by the Italian Rugby Federation. Rugby was introduced into Italy in the early 1900s. It is also known as \"pallovale\" or \"palla ovale\" (\"oval ball\") within Italy. Two Italian professional teams (Treviso and Zebre) compete in United Rugby Championship, a league that also includes sides from Ireland, Scotland, South Africa and Wales. One of the teams is guaranteed a place in the European Rugby Champions Cup; the other normally plays in the European Rugby Challenge Cup. The Top12 is the main national club competition. Four Italian clubs from the national championship compete in a qualifying tournament that awards two places in the Challenge Cup. Italy competes in the Six Nations Championship and Rugby World Cup, and is classified as a tier one nation by World Rugby (formerly the International Rugby Board).\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body of Italian rugby union is the Federazione Italiana Rugby (FIR). An original organisational committee was established in 1911, although it was in 1928 when the body became the FIR, and in 1987, it joined the International Rugby Board. In 1934 the FIR became a founding member of the Federation Internationale de Rugby Amateur.\nPopularity.\nThere are 1,024 rugby clubs within Italy. These clubs support 153,173 registered male players, as well as 8,118 registered female players.\nMany teams are either from Veneto or Lombardy in the north of Italy as this area has the highest rugby popularity however the sport has achieved national presence as it is played and followed throughout the country. Rugby is now estimated to be the third most popular team sport in Italy behind football and basketball.\nItalian players also play for other European rugby clubs, such as those in the Aviva Premiership.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe remote ancestry of rugby has been linked to a Roman game known as harpastum, which spread throughout their Empire, include the province of Britannia. Athenaeus writes:\nGalen, in \"On Exercise with the Small Ball\", describes Harpastum as:\nThis game was apparently a Romanized version of a Greek game called phaininda. The general impression from ancient descriptions is of a game quite similar to rugby. Additional descriptions suggest a line was drawn in the dirt, and that the teams would endeavor to keep the ball behind their side of the line and prevent the opponents from reaching it. This seems rather like an 'inverted' form of football. If the opponents had the ball on their side of the line, the objective would seem to be to get in and \"pass\" it to another player, or somehow get it back over the line.\nAnother remote Roman ancestor of rugby may be a game called trigon, which involved three players passing a ball to one another by hand. The ball was usually small and hard, but occasionally it was a \"follis\" or large bladder-ball.\nItaly is home to a number of forms of traditional football, some of which have features which are more similar to rugby, than to association football, such as handling the ball. A prime example of this is \"Calcio Storico Fiorentino\" played in Florence. The \"Piazza Santa Croce\" of Florence is the cradle of this sport, that became known as \"giuoco del calcio fiorentino\" (\"Florentine kick game\") or simply \"calcio\" (\"kick\"). The first official rules of \"calcio fiorentino\" were recorded in 1580, although the game had been developing around Florence for some time before that date. The game involved teams of 27 kicking and carrying a ball in a giant sandpit set up in the Piazza Santa Croce in the centre of Florence, both teams aiming for their designated point on the perimeter of the sandpit.\nEarly history.\nBritish communities brought rugby to Genoa between 1890 and 1895, with other games in Italy around 1909. The society that organised the first games dissolved soon after them.\nItalian rugby's traditional heartland consists of the small country towns in the Po Valley and other parts of Northern Italy. Some believe that Italian workers returning from France, particularly the south, introduced the game and gave it a significant rural/working class base, which still exists in towns such as Treviso and Rovigo. A demonstration game was also played in 1910 in Turin between SCUF and Servette of Geneva. French students also introduced the game to Milan University c. 1911. While each of these events has been hailed as the \"origin of Italian rugby\", it seems that they probably happened more or less simultaneously and independent of one another, and that the introduction of rugby to Italy was a series of events, rather than a single starting point. Whatever the ultimate origins of the game in northern Italy, the region's proximity to the French rugby heartland helped as well.\nThe first match played by a representative Italian XV was in 1911, between US Milanese and Voiron of France. On 25 July of the same year the \"Propaganda Committee\" was formed which in 1928 became the Federazione Italiana Rugby (FIR).\nAn original organisational committee was established in 1911, although it was in 1928 when the body became the FIR.\n1920s and Fascist period.\nThe national team played their first game in May 1929 in Barcelona where they lost 0-9 against Spain. A week later, a rematch was held in Milan, where Italy beat Spain 3-0. There was a further game in 1928 when Ambrosiana Milano beat R.C.T. Bucharest 15-3.\nThe first Italian championship, won by Ambrosiana Milano, took place in 1929, with 6 of the 16 teams that existed in Italy. \nIn 1934 the FIR became founding members of FIRA (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur) along with the national teams of Italy, France, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Germany. In 1936 Italy took part in the Fira European Tournament, in Berlin, along with France, Germany and Romania and in 1937, in Paris, along with France, Germany, Romania, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nRugby union spread to other parts of Italy, especially the cities of Rome, Bologna, Padua, Naples, Brescia, Turin and Parma. France was the first of the Championship countries to play Italy at senior level and the inaugural match took place in 1937, France winning 43-5.\nThe Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini rebranded rugby union as \"palla ovale\" (\"oval ball\"), deciding it was an evolution of the Roman game harpastum. The game was used as a vehicle for Fascist unity, and by 1927 rugby union had its own propaganda committee. However, Mussolini found rugby union inconveniently resistant to authority and dropped the sport, and for Fascist purposes turned to \"volata\", a malleable kind of handball. Volata never caught on and in 1933 the effort was officially abandoned, however the invention of the game proved damaging to rugby union's popularity and place in Italian sporting culture. After the decline of the volata project, his supporters turned back to rugby in the years leading up to the Second World War as an alternative to soccer, which they saw as an effete English influence. However, despite this far right involvement, Italian rugby managed to escape too much of an association with the regime.\nPost-war period.\nThe Second World War interrupted Italian rugby union, as it did in other rugby-playing nations. Post-war, there was a desire to return to normality and Italian rugby union entered a new dimension thanks to the help of Allied troops in Italy. Very soon the Veneto (Rovigo, Padua and Treviso) came to assume a prominent position in the Italian rugby union scene earning the name \"Republic of the Italian rugby union\". Parma and L'Aquila also became main centres for rugby union.\nIn the 1960s the Italian Rugby Union had their rival sport, rugby league, hampered by threatening to ban rugby league players from playing rugby union for life.\n1980s and 1990s.\nIn the 1980s, a peculiar set of economic circumstances arose, which helped bolster the game further. In an effort to promote the game, sinking money into rugby became virtually tax-free, and large amounts of sponsorship money went into the game, from companies as large as Benetton which set up their own club sides. Benetton Treviso for example was able to use this money to produce a dramatic rise in standards. Players of Italian ancestry from Australia and Argentina were brought in, and the likes of Frano Botica, David Campese, John Kirwan and Michael Lynagh plied their trade in Italy's top flight. Although the rise in standards was not immediate, the influx of money helped buy in some top foreign coaches such as Mark Ella and Bernard Fourcarde, which allowed them to develop their own stars such as Massimo Giovanelli. This change for the better was reflected in their scorelines - for example, when the Italians played the All Blacks in 1987, they were humiliated 70-6, but when the All Blacks played them in 1991, they found themselves winning only 31-21 in a highly competitive match. Italy narrowly lost to the Australians 23-20 in 1994 (who at time were world champions) The next week Italy were again competitive and Australia struggled to a 20-7 victory.\nIn 1987, the Federazione Italiana Rugby joined the International Rugby Board (IRB), now known as World Rugby. That same year, the national side were invited to compete in the first Rugby World Cup in 1987. Italy had to wait until 1988 to play their first Test against a Home Nation. In 1995, the national side finally got their first victory over a home nation, against Ireland in Treviso, in a Rugby World Cup warm up. In 1999, the domestic competition ran its 100th tournament, with Benetton Treviso winning the championship that year.\nPresent day.\nIn 2000, Italy joined the Five Nations Championships, turning the competition into the Six Nations Championship. In both the 2007 Six Nations and the 2013 Six Nations, Italy finished fourth, their best placing yet.\nNational team.\nThe Italian national rugby union side have been playing international rugby since the late 1920s, and are categorized, by the International Rugby Board, as a tier one nation. They have competed in the Six Nations Championship since 2000 and at all the Rugby World Cups. Italy's best result at a Rugby World Cup was at the 2007 tournament in France, where they won two of their four pool matches and lost by two points to Scotland, narrowly missing the quarter-finals.\nOn St. Valentine's Day 2010, Italy lost narrowly to England in Rome (12-17), further consolidating Italy's rise in international rugby, and this rise continued with a 22-21 victory over France on 12 March 2011.\nAs of April 2024, the Italian national team is ranked 8th in the world, its joint highest ever ranking.\nNotable former Italian international players include:\nItaly also has a national rugby sevens team.\nOther tournaments.\nThe World Rugby Nations Cup in Romania and World Rugby Tbilisi Cup in Georgia are tournaments involving the host teams and usually Tier One teams like Argentina XV and Emerging Italy and Tier Two teams like Portugal and Russia. Nations Cup was first held in 2006.\nCompetitions.\nDomestic.\nApart from the two Italian teams competing in the Pro14, European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup, the Top12 is the main competition for rugby union clubs in Italy. The competition was first contested in 1929, with six clubs. It was altered in 2002 to include just the top 10 sides of Italy, and was extended to twelve teams in 2012/13. The competition runs from September to May. After a home-and-away season, the top four teams play a knock-out competition to decide the championship. The winners are awarded the Albo d'Oro trophy.\nThe current teams are:\nBelow the \"Top12\", domestic Italian rugby is played in the Campionati Nazionali which consists of:\nSerie A: divided into 4 pools of 6 teams who play each other home and away \nSerie B: divided into 4 leagues of 12 teams who play each other home and away.\nSerie C1.\nSerie C2.\nAn Under 19 Championship and a female competition also exist.\nThe Coppa Italia is a knock-out competition for domestic clubs. The competition has been contested annually since 1967, though it was not held from 1974 to 1980, and 1983 to 1994, and again in 1996, 1999 and 2002. From 2010 it's renamed in Excellence Trophy.\nEuropean tournaments.\nPro12.\nTwo Italian sides, Treviso and Aironi were admitted to the Pro12 on 8 March 2009, and started playing in the league from the 2010/11 season. The announcement by Celtic rugby followed a long period of negotiations and planning, starting with a tentative agreement in 2008 to admit two Italian sides. During 2009 the FIR organised a competition to choose which two sides would win the two places. This resulted in a team based in Rome winning one of the two places, despite the Italian rugby heartland being in the north. This decision was overturned after questions about the viability of the new franchise, with Treviso taking its place. Only after repeated assurances by the FIR of the ability of the two new sides to contribute financially to the league did Celtic rugby finally admit the two teams.\nFor the 2012/13 season, Aironi left the Pro12, and was replaced by Zebre, a team based in Parma.\nHeineken Cup and European Rugby Champions Cup.\nItaly fielded teams in the European knock-out competition, the Heineken Cup, from its inception in 1995–96 through its final season of 2013–14. The Heineken Cup was an annual rugby union competition involving leading clubs, regional and provincial teams from the rest of the Six Nations: England, France, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Through the 2009–10 season, Italy usually had two to three clubs in the Heineken Cup. Starting with the 2010–11 season, Italy's two Pro12 sides automatically entered the Heineken Cup.\nStarting in 2014–15, the Heineken Cup has been replaced by the European Rugby Champions Cup. Italy is guaranteed one place in the Champions Cup; the Italian Pro12 team that finishes higher on the previous season's Pro12 table automatically qualifies. The second Italian Pro12 club can earn a Champions Cup place if it is one of the three highest-placed teams apart from the top team of each Pro12 country (Italy, Ireland, Scotland, Wales). Beginning with the 2014–15 season, the second Italian club has another path to the following season's Champions Cup—if it is one of the top two Pro12 teams that does not qualify for the Champions Cup, it will enter a play-off for a Champions Cup place that also involves the seventh-place sides from the English Premiership and Top 14.\nEuropean Challenge Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup.\nThe European Challenge Cup in rugby union, known as the Parker Pen Shield from 2001 to 2003, Parker Pen Challenge Cup from 2003 to 2005, and the Amlin Challenge Cup from 2009 to 2014, was the sister competition to the Heineken Cup. It was competed for by teams from England, France, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, Italy, and Romania (plus, in some years, Portugal and Spain) on a knock-out basis.\nItaly entered 4 clubs: those finishing 1st to 4th in the \"Eccellenza\". Clubs had previously competed in the European Shield, though that particular competition was restructured in 2005.\nStarting in the 2014–15 season, the original Challenge Cup was replaced by the European Rugby Challenge Cup. Any Italian Pro12 team that does not qualify for the Champions Cup plays in the current Challenge Cup.\nEuropean Rugby Qualifying Competition.\nThe introduction of the new European club competition structure for 2014–15 will see the creation of a completely new third-tier competition, the Qualifying Competition. The structure has not yet been announced, but it will involve the top four teams from the \"Eccellenza\" plus club sides from second-tier European rugby nations. These sides will compete for two places in the Challenge Cup."

        "title": "You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown",
        "text": "You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown is the 37th prime-time animated television special based on Charles M. Schulz's comic strip \"Peanuts\". It premiered on January 18, 1994 on NBC. It was the last new \"Peanuts\" special to air on television until \"A Charlie Brown Valentine\" in 2002, and the last before Schulz's death in 2000.\n\"You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown\" is notable for being the only \"Peanuts\" television special to debut on NBC; from 1965 to 2000, most \"Peanuts\" specials were aired by CBS. NBC aired this special as a tie-in with Super Bowl XXVIII, to which NBC held the rights that year; it was produced with the full cooperation of the National Football League, whose team uniforms are featured pervasively in the special.\nPlot.\nAs Lucy prepares to pull her usual trick of pulling the ball away from Charlie Brown as he tries to kick it, Peppermint Patty, Marcie, Franklin, and Linus arrive. They inform Lucy and Charlie Brown that there will be a Punt, Pass, and Kick contest. They mention that first prize wins a new bicycle and a trip to the Super Bowl, and suggest they all enter. As they discuss the contest, Charlie Brown seeks his chance to kick the ball while Lucy is not looking—only for Lucy to blindly pull it away in perfect timing.\nWhile Charlie Brown and Linus are practicing for the contest, they notice a very pretty girl, who catches Linus's attention. They walk up to her and introduce themselves. The girl says her name is Melody-Melody and that has been watching them. They flirt with her and take her out for hot fudge sundaes. They then try to impress her and tell her they will be entering the punt-and-pass contest. Melody says she will be rooting for them at the contest.\nAt the punt-and-pass contest, Charlie Brown and Linus see Melody watching them, and they argue about who Melody came to watch. The announcer announces every player, and every player gets a better score than the next one, except for Marcie who refuses to kick the football thinking the football did nothing to deserve being kicked. Charlie Brown performs well, finishing his turn in first place, only for Linus to best him. To the dismay of both, Melody turns out to be the final contestant, whose score beats all of the others. Betrayed, Linus admits to Charlie Brown that he is in love with her. Melody wins the new bicycle and the tickets to the Super Bowl.\nLater, Charlie Brown and Linus are at the wall. Linus is so upset that the girl he was in love with beat him that he says he will never trust anyone again. Charlie Brown replies \"Your sister says we can't go through life doubting everyone. We have to learn to trust each other\" (echoing her bait line at the beginning of the special before pulling the football away from him). Lucy then comes to them holding a football, much to Charlie Brown's despondence and annoyance.\nMeanwhile, Snoopy coaches The Birds (a football team in Philadelphia Eagles attire consisting of Woodstock and his avian friends), as they compete in the Animal Football League playoffs. In the Eastern final against the Cats (loosely based on the Detroit Lions), Woodstock and his team manage to beat the Cats 38–0. In the league semifinal, the Birds crush the Dogs 58–0. In the World Championship, The Birds take on The Bison (a parody of the Buffalo Bills). As the game begins, Lucy comes onto the field and tells Snoopy he is a horrible coach, and his team will get crushed. But once again, The Birds crush the other team, 62–0 (again parodying Bills assistant coach Chuck Dickerson's disparaging the Washington Redskins prior to Super Bowl XXVI), winning the championship. After each touchdown, the Birds introduce a different celebration dance, and after each win, they douse Snoopy in Chirpade—except for the championship, when Lucy is on the receiving end of the Chirpade shower.\nProduction notes.\nThis special was animated by Wang Film Productions in Taiwan. It was the second and final \"Peanuts\" special to be animated by them.\nFranklin and Marcie, whose last names were never officially revealed during the course of the \"Peanuts\" comic strip, were given surnames for the first time in this special. Franklin's last name—Armstrong—was a homage to cartoonist Robb Armstrong, whose comic strip \"Jump Start\" was among the first broad-appeal comic strips to focus on a black family; Schulz called Armstrong to ask permission to use his name for the special, and Armstrong (who considered Schulz one of his biggest influences) consented without hesitation. Marcie was given the surname of Johnson.\nMusic score.\nAs with the preceding \"It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown\", jazz pianist David Benoit performed and arranged the music score consisting of variations of songs originally performed by jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi. Guaraldi composed music scores for the first 16 \"Peanuts\" television specials and one feature film (\"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\") before his death in February 1976.\nAll songs written by Vince Guaraldi, except where noted.\nReleases.\nTelevision.\n\"You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown\" first aired on January 18, 1994, and was the only animated \"Peanuts\" special to air on NBC, which had the rights to air the Super Bowl in 1994. (All previous \"Peanuts\" specials had aired on CBS, starting with the 1965 premiere of \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\".) The special received an 8.0 rating and was watched by about 7.5 million households.\n\"You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown\" was the last \"Peanuts\" special to air on television before Charles Schulz's death in 2000. (Two more specials were produced, but they were released direct-to-video.) The next new special that aired on television was \"A Charlie Brown Valentine\", which premiered on ABC in 2002. It was also the last \"Peanuts\" special produced using traditional cel animation.\nHome media.\n\"You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown\" is also the only \"Peanuts\" special that Paramount Home Entertainment or Warner Home Video, the last two holders of the \"Peanuts\" home media rights, does not have the video distribution rights to. Its lone video release, like \"It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown\" (1992) before it, was available in VHS format at participating Shell petrol stations. It is currently not available in DVD, Blu-ray or streaming formats."

        "text": "The 1994 Women's Rugby World Cup was the second world cup for women. It was originally scheduled to be held in Amsterdam, Netherlands (April 10–24) but was cancelled only weeks before. However, a replacement competition was organised around the same dates in Scotland. England beat the defending champions USA 38–23 in the final.\nBackground.\nThe official reason for the cancellation was that the event organisers failed to get official endorsement of the event as the \"Women's World Cup\" from the International Rugby Board (IRB). The minutes of the 1993 Interim meeting of the IRB state the following about the \"1994 Women's International Tournament\":\nHence not only was there uncertainty to whether it really was the \"Women's World Cup\" or not, but the IRB refused to endorse it regardless of its status – the \"deferral\" (above) was in practice a refusal to endorse as the next scheduled IRB meeting was only days before the event was due to start. It was not until 2009 that the IRB officially endorsed the event as a \"world cup\" when it published, for the first time, a list of previous winners.\nBecause of this, the Unions of some countries decided not to pay team expenses (including New Zealand, where women's rugby was by now fully integrated in the national union, and ultimately others as well) or withdrew their entries. Several team members decided to go ahead and raised the money themselves, but the surrounding uncertainty of the event status and the financial risk from teams pulling out prompted the event organizers to (rather abruptly) cancel it.\nThe women who had trained so hard, and had gone to much trouble raising money etc., were so disappointed at the cancellation that an alternative tournament in Scotland was soon organized. Despite the IRB threatening sanctions against unions taking part in this unendorsed event, it went ahead.\nThis Women's Rugby World Cup, like its predecessor in 1991, was never endorsed by the IRB and the Scottish organizers did not pursue official sanctioning. However, all of the participating teams regarded it as the \"real\" World Cup.\nEventually eleven of the original sixteen entrants took part – as well as New Zealand, Netherlands also withdrew from both participation as well as hosts, and Spain pulled out very late – after the groups had been drawn – and were replaced by a Scottish Students team. Italy and Germany were also notable absentees. The Soviet Union would have competed but due to their dissolution, they were replaced by Russia and Kazakhstan.\nOnce the event was underway it proved to be a great success, England exacting revenge for their 1991 defeat to USA, beating the defending champions 38–23 in the final.\nMatch Officials.\nJ Fleming (Boroughmuir)"

        "text": "The Luxembourg national rugby union team is a minor team, and is ranked as a third tier nation. The team participates in the annual Rugby Europe Championship Conference 2 North 2017–18 Rugby Europe Conference. Since 1996 Luxembourg also competes in the sevens circuits in Europe Luxembourg national rugby sevens team.\nLuxembourg has been a member of FIRA since 1976, two years after the founding of Luxembourg Rugby Federation (French: \"Fédération Luxembourgeoise de Rugby (FLR)\"). The Grand Duchy has participated several times in the FIRA championships and, despite the small size, has honourably acquitted itself. Luxembourg has also been a member of the International Rugby Board since 1991.\nThe Luxembourg rugby team is the only national sports team to have been three times champions of their group in a European competition. In 1995, more than 20 points scored against Slovenia at Cessange and more than 20 points scored in Split against Croatia and finally an excellent draw against Andorra in Luxembourg enabled them to be champions of their group. In 1997 they won the Bronze Cup with wins against Bosnia, Bulgaria and Monaco. Luxembourg has in their past encounter recorded a 10–10 draw against Georgia, but the best performance to date was a \"Grand Slam\" in 2004 in FIRA-AER European Cup division 3B. In the 2017–2018 campaign, Luxembourg won the Grand Slam against Denmark, Norway, Finland and Estonia in the Rugby Europe Conference 2 North, while also integrating several young players in the squad, and gained promotion to the Rugby Europe Conference 1 North for the 2018–2019 campaign.\nAfter two narrow losses to group favourites Ukraine and Sweden, Luxembourg beat Moldova 23–10 at home to, for the first time ever, secure a spot for a second consecutive year on this level. Two weeks later Luxembourg also beat Hungary away 18–15, showing the potential of the team.\nThe national side is ranked 62nd in the world (as of 23 October 2023).\nNational clubs.\nThe Rugby Club Luxembourg was founded in May 1973 by a group of expatriates working in the Grand Duchy. Several of the founders still live in Luxembourg and contribute one way or another to the sport. The club played its first competitive game against US Castillionnaise in September 1973. Up until 1995, the club played in the Alsace-Lorraine regional league. In that year, the team joined the Belgian second division, which it belonged to until 1998, when it earned promotion to the first division. In 2001, the club decided to return to the French league system, again playing regionally in Alsace-Lorraine. It won its division in 2008 but, after an invitation to play in Germany, decided to join the German league system in 2009. In the 2017–2018 season, RCL is leading Bundesliga 2 West unbeaten and hopes to secure promotion to Bundesliga 1 for the 2018–2019 season.\nDe Rugby Club Walferdange was founded in 1990. In 2001, after 10 years in the Belgian League they finished top of the third division and champion during the 2002/03 season. In its first season in the second division, the club was relegated to 3rd Division. The club's objective having gone through a rebuilding phase, is to return to and remain in the Belgian 2nd division.\nThe Richard Mertens Club is a member of the European Community sports clubs (French: \"Cercle Sportif des Communautés Européennes\") and concentrates on U-7/U-19, its goal being to promote the game of rugby in Luxembourg and act as a feeder club for the two senior clubs of Luxembourg with any talented players. Player retention remains a concern for Luxembourgish rugby with most of such players stopping the sport after school for various reasons, even if they remain in Luxembourg. Despite this, the school has had some success stories since its inception with a few of its past players having gone on to play for well known university and club sides, or having gone on to represent Luxembourg at the senior level.\nIn 2017, a fourth club was founded in the south of the country in Dudelange, Rugby Club Terres Rouge. The club exclusively caters for the youth; it has been implied by the founders that there is potential for founding a senior team.\nA fifth club, the Rugby Eagles Luxembourg, was founded in 2019 and became an official Member of the Luxembourg Rugby Union in June 2020. This club is exclusively a child-centered rugby project.\nStatistics XV.\nTest Record.\nBelow is a table of the representative rugby matches played by the Luxembourg national XV at test level up until 6 April 2024:\nCareer XV.\nView more additional detail Player Statistics\nCurrent squad XV.\nOn 03 November, Luxembourg named their 26-player squad for 2023-24 Rugby Europe Conference - Pool B against Austria."

        "title": "Super 10 (rugby union)",
        "text": "The Super 10 was a rugby union football tournament featuring ten teams from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Tonga, and Western Samoa. The competition ran for three years from 1993 to 1995 and was the predecessor of Super 12 and Super 14, now known as Super Rugby.\nHistory.\nThe Super 10 replaced the Super 6 and the previous South Pacific Championship and CANZ Series tournaments which had been organized by the Australian and New Zealand rugby unions during the 1980s and early 1990s. With South Africa being readmitted into international sport due to the dismantling of apartheid (both The Wallabies and the All Blacks toured South Africa during 1992), there was an opportunity to launch an expanded competition also featuring South Africa's top provincial teams. The South African Broadcasting Corporation's \"Top Sport\" channel committed to a three-year sponsorship of the competition, allowing it to be launched.\nThe official declaration of professionalism in rugby union in August 1995 led to a reworking of the competition. SANZAR, a partnership between the South African Rugby Union, the New Zealand Rugby Union and the Australian Rugby Union was formed, and in association with Rupert Murdoch's News Limited, they created the Super 12. That fully professional competition featured teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa only, with one more team from each country being admitted, and was launched in 1996\nPast winners.\nWinners by year:\nFormat.\nThe ten teams for the competition were arranged as follows:\nThe ten teams were split into two pools to minimize the logistical problems caused by the travel required and the time zone differences between the participating countries. Each team played the other four teams in their pool once, with four competition points being awarded for a win, two for a draw, and one for a loss by seven points or less. Bonus points for scoring four or more tries were not introduced until the formation of the Super 12.\nThe top team in each pool met in a final to decide the championship.\n1993 season.\nFor the inaugural competition, New Zealand were represented by NPC champions , along with , and . South Africa were represented by Currie Cup champions , along with and . were the representatives from the Pacific Tri-Series.\n1994 season.\nFor the second edition of the competition, New Zealand were represented by NPC champions , along with , and . South Africa were represented by Currie Cup champions , along with and . were the representatives from the Pacific Tri-Series.\n1995 season.\nFor the third edition of the competition, New Zealand were represented by NPC champions , along with , and .

        "title": "Paraguay national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Paraguay national rugby team is governed by the Paraguayan Rugby Union. They compete regularly in the South American Rugby Championship, but have yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup.\nParaguay had the unenviable position on 1 May 2002, of being beaten by Argentina A by 152–0. In July of the same year, Japan beat Taiwan by an identical margin – 155–3, but unlike Paraguay, Taiwan scored some points in their match.\nIn the past Paraguay was regularly the 4th team in South American rugby, behind Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. However, in the late 2000s, at both Junior and Senior Levels, Brazil came to compete with and beat Paraguay, relegating Paraguay to 5th place in South America.\nParaguay in South American Rugby.\nWith the formation of the Unión de Rugby del Paraguay in 1970, the national team, Los Yacarés (the Alligators), first represented Paraguay in 1971.\nIn the Sudamericano (South American Championship) of 1971 they lost to Chile, Uruguay and Argentina by between 40 and 60 points, while losing a close game to Brazil, 12–6. This established the pattern which has continued ever since, with Paraguay lagging behind Argentina, Uruguay and Chile, and sharing 4th and 5th place in South America with Brazil.\nIn 1981, in the absence of Argentina, Paraguay finished 3rd in the Sudamericano.\nIn 1985 Paraguay drew 9 all with Uruguay, their only draw with Uruguay at senior level, and lost to Chile by only 3 points, 19–12. Despite the draw, Paraguay still finished in 4th place in the Sudamericano on points difference, due to a heavy loss to Argentina and Uruguay beating Chile.\nIn 1993 Paraguay managed to beat Chile 25–24 in Santiago for the first and only time at senior level, finishing 3rd in the Sudamericano.\nUntil 2003 Paraguay regularly played in the Sudamericano de Rugby A (the first division of the South American rugby championship). However, in 2003 they suffered huge losses, 144–0 to Argentina, 53–7 to Uruguay and 102–0 to Chile.\nFor 2004 Paraguay was replaced in the A by Venezuela, the B Champion from 2003 (who also suffered huge losses). Paraguay won the B championship in both 2004 and 2005, winning the decider against Brazil in 2005 by 45–8.\nIn 2006 and 2007 Paraguay did not play any test matches. They were too good for the Sudamericano B, but not strong enough to compete in the Sudamericano A.\nParaguay returned to international rugby in 2008 in the Sudamericano B played in Asuncion. The Championship also served as 2011 Rugby World Cup qualification. Both Paraguay and Brazil had strong wins against Colombia, Venezuela and Peru. Brazil won the championship decider 15–6, the first time they had beaten Paraguay since 1989. In doing so they also moved above Paraguay in the IRB World Rankings for the first time, a position they have maintained ever since.\nBased on their similar results, CONSUR decided to promoted both Brazil and Paraguay to the Sudamericano A for 2009. In 2009 and 2010 Paraguay and Brazil lost to Chile and Uruguay in the Sudamericano A, and Brazil won the matches between the two countries 36–21 and 24–18.\nIn the 2011 Sudamericano A, Paraguay sent a very inexperienced team to the Championship, after infighting in the Union de Rugby del Paraguay saw the country's top 3 teams (who had formed the majority of players in the national team) withdrawing their players. The team suffered huge losses, 102–6 against Uruguay, 71–3 against Chile, and a record 51–14 against Brazil.\nParaguay was relegated to the Sudamericano B for 2012. In 2012 Paraguay won the Sudamericano B (which also served as a Rugby World Cup Qualifier) easily, with a combined score of 196 to 28, against Colombia, Venezuela and Peru.\nParaguay played further World Cup Qualifiers in late 2012, beating Bermuda 29–14 and losing to Brazil 35–22.\nIn 2013 Paraguay again won the Sudemaericano B, by a closer margin, beating Peru 22–0, Venezuela 48–7 and Colombia 25–15.\nParaguayan rugby continues to face the same problem, that it is generally not strong enough to compete with the other teams in the Sudamericano A, but is too strong for the teams in the Sudamericano B.\nSouth American Rugby Championships.\nSudamericano 1971 Montevideo, Uruguay\n10 OCT 1971 Uruguay 56 – 3 Paraguay\n14 OCT 1971 Chile 40 – 0 Paraguay\n16 OCT 1971 Argentina 61 – 0

The tournament was held in Barcelona, Spain. The format was the same as the previous tournament and again 16 nations competed.\nFor the first time a pre-tournament qualification match took place to decide Asia's second representative but other than that all competitors took part by invitation. 14 of the 16 teams taking part were the same as in 1998 but two lowest ranked European teams (Sweden and Russia) were replaced by teams from Asia (Japan) and Oceania (Samoa).\nThe competition was won by defending champions, New Zealand.\nMatch Officials.\nReferees:\nCompetition format.\nThe format was the same as the previous tournament and again 16 nations competed. The teams were divided into four pools of four teams each, according to each team's seeding.\nFor the first set of matches the highest seeded team played the lowest seeded team while the two mid-seeded teams played each other.\nAfter the first round of matches the positions in each pool were recalculated with the winners of the first matches in first and second places, and the losers in third and fourth places.\nIn the second set of matches, the top two teams and the bottom two teams from each pool played each other. The final pool standings were calculated from the results of these matches to give the final four positions in each pool.\nThe four top teams in each of the pools went forward to contest the World Cup title. The second placed teams from each pool play for 5th position (the Plate), the third place teams for 9th (the Bowl), and the fourth placed teams for 13th (the Shield).

        "text": "The World Rugby Pacific Challenge, formerly the IRB Pacific Rugby Cup, is an annual rugby union football tournament held in Oceania since 2006. It is contested by national 'A' teams (formed from the best locally based players, with most not already on their nations' senior rugby team) from the Asia-Pacific region. The tournament is run by World Rugby (previously IRB) through Oceania Rugby.\nThe original IRB Pacific Rugby Cup featured two teams from each of the three Pacific Island countries of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. The competition followed the completion of Fiji's Colonial Cup, Samoa's National Provincial Championship and Tonga's Provincial Championship and provided player development pathway leading into the IRB Pacific Nations Cup.\nSince 2011, the tournament has been contested by national 'A' sides, although some matches also featured teams from Super Rugby academies in Australia and New Zealand. Teams from Japan, Argentina and Canada have also joined the tournament to compete with the three Pacific Island countries.\nTeams.\nThe competing national 'A' teams as of the 2018 season were:\nOverall.\nSummary of all Pacific Challenge winners and runners-up, for tournaments up to and including 2020:\nHistory.\nPacific Island tournament: 2006 to 2010.\nThe Pacific Rugby Cup initially featured six representative teams, two from each Pacific Island country:\nThe format was a single round-robin tournament with the top-placed team hosting a final against the second-placed to decide the title. The Fiji Warriors won the competition twice, the Samoan teams won the Cup once each, and Tautahi Gold also claimed the title once for Tonga.\nPacific Australasian series: 2011 to 2014.\nFrom 2011, the three Pacific Island countries were represented by their national 'A' teams. They were joined by Japan's national 'A' team, Junior Japan, as the fourth core team in 2013. The itinerary included tour matches against Super Rugby academy opposition from Australia and New Zealand and included the following sides:\nThe tournament was split into three stages with the core Pacific Cup teams playing Super Rugby academies in the first two stages in Australia and New Zealand, respectively. In the third stage, the Pacific Cup teams played each other in a single round robin, home or away, to decide the title. No finals were played and the team finishing on top of the combined table after all stages was the tournament winner. The Fiji Warriors won all three tournaments from 2011 to 2013.\nThe format was expanded again in 2014 with Argentina's Pampas XV and four Australian academy teams joining the competition as core teams competing with the Pacific A sides. The New Zealand development teams did not participate in 2014 and the tournament was held entirely in Australia. Two pools were formed as follows:\nA single round robin was played in each pool with the top ranked sides from each playing in the final. The Pampas XV defeated Reds A in the final held in Sydney to win the title.

        "text": "WWF Super WrestleMania is a multiplatform wrestling video game based on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), released in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis.\nTwo other 16-bit WWF games, \"WWF Royal Rumble\" and \"WWF Raw\", were released which retained the \"tug-of-war\" style grappling system, where moves are performed by locking up and out-tapping the other player or the computer to execute a move.\nGameplay.\nAll wrestlers share the same set of standard professional wrestling moves like scoop slams, suplexes, dropkicks, clotheslines, hip tosses, and elbow drops. The Genesis version also has signature moves for each wrestler which can be performed at any time in the match. Gameplay modes consist of one-on-one, tag team, and four-on-four Survivor Series elimination matches. The Genesis version also contains a WWF Championship mode where the player selects one wrestler and must defeat the rest in a series of one-on-one matches to be crowned WWF Champion.\nWhile the Super NES version does not contain signature moves, its roster is a bit larger, with ten wrestlers compared to eight in the Genesis version. The only wrestlers shared between versions are Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage and Ted DiBiase. Wrestlers exclusive to the Super NES version are Jake Roberts, The Undertaker, Sid Justice, The Legion of Doom and The Natural Disasters. Wrestlers exclusive to the Genesis version are The Ultimate Warrior, Papa Shango, Irwin R. Schyster, The British Bulldog, and Shawn Michaels.\nReception.\nThe game has received \"mixed to positive\" reviews from critics. Germany's \"Aktueller Software Markt\" magazine awarded a \"satisfactory\" rating to the Mega Drive/Genesis version and a \"good\" rating to the SNES version. \"Computer and Video Games\" magazine called it \"the best two-player game anywhere\" and particularly praised its multiplayer capabilities. The \"Game Players Nintendo Guide\" described it as \"a solid wrestling game that could have been one of the best ever if not for some substantial drawbacks. You'll have the most fun playing against a friend; re-creating those famous WWF rivalries definitely makes you anxious to fight just one more match\". \"GameFan\" had a mostly positive opinion of the Genesis version, praising the gameplay, controls and graphics. The French \"Joystick\" magazine called it the best simulation of this sport on both consoles. \"Mean Machines Sega\" called it \"a fun wrestle game (the best on the Megadrive so far) which could have been supported with a bit more front end\". GamePro gave the Sega Genesis version a 13.5 out of 20, while they gave the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version a 17 out of 25."

        "title": "German Rugby Federation",
        "text": "The German Rugby Federation ( or \"DRV\") is the governing body for rugby union in Germany. It organizes the German national team and the three league divisions: the Rugby-Bundesliga, the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga and the Rugby-Regionalliga. It was founded on 4 November 1900 in Kassel, and is the oldest national rugby union in continental Europe. After the Second World War, the DRV was restored on 14 May 1950.\nThe \"DRV\" publishes the \"Deutsches Rugby-Journal\" with 11 issues per year. It is the official organ of the federation.\nHistory.\nPrior to its foundation several initiatives were taken to syndicate the German clubs. When the efforts of the north German clubs failed in 1886, DFV Hannover 1878 joined the \"German Football and Cricket federation\", while the southern clubs opted for the \"South German Football Union\". Despite the well pronounced individualism of the clubs, representatives from Heidelberg and from FV Stuttgart 93, the later VfB Stuttgart, met in February 1898 for the first Rugby-Day () in Frankfurt. Led by Professor Dr. Edward Hill Ulrich this group went on looking for closer contact to the north German clubs. Additional Rugby-Days followed in August 1898 and September 1899. It was not until the fifth of this gatherings, taking place in Hannover on 4 November 1900, that 19 clubs formally decided on a joint operation to form a German Rugby Football Union under the governing body of the German Football Association. On 4 November 1901, only one year after the foundation the Rugby-Football Federation made the decision to leave the association football players and form the self-governed German Rugby Federation.\nCentenary and Barbarians Tour.\nIn 2000 the German Rugby Federation celebrated its centenary. Centenary celebrations included a banquet in the Heidelberg Castle and the hosting of the European leg of the Rugby World Cup Sevens in Heidelberg, in which the German team came close to upsetting Ireland, who had Gordon D'Arcy in their line-up. The tournament was won by the Welsh team, which featured Andy Marinos and Arwel Thomas.\nThe highlight of the Centenary season was the Centenary Match against the Barbarians. The Barbarians included a host of internationals including Scott Hastings, Peter Stringer, Shaun Longstaff, Jeff Probyn, Frankie Sheahan, Russell Earnshaw, Shaun Connor, John Langford and Derwyn Jones and won 47–19 against a determined German team.\nProposed reform 2009.\nThe \"DRV\" proposed a reform of its structure in October 2009, with the view of rugby having become an Olympic sport once more.\nAlso, from 2010–11, every club has to field a minimum of ten players per game who are eligible to play for the German national team, and can only field twelve non-eligible players at the same game.\nFor the national teams, the aim was set to have the men's side achieve qualification for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, at the latest, and qualification for both the men and women for the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nFinancial Crisis.\nThe German Rugby Federation suffered a major crisis in 2011, finding itself close to insolvency, being €200,000 in debt. The situation was brought on by the annual grant of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, \"BMI\", not being paid in 2010 after the ministry voiced concerns that the \"DRV\" was not using the money for the desired purpose, to support the sport. A legal battle that the \"DRV\" chairman Claus-Peter Bach fought with the ministry did not bring the desired result but instead worsened the situation. Bach consequently announced he would not stand for another term in July 2011 and was replaced by Ralph Götz. The \"DRV\" was able to secure a private loan to survive and hopes to attract sponsors that had withdrawn under Bach as well as to reach a settlement with the \"BMI\".\nAt the \"Deutsche Rugby Tag\" (DRT) in mid-July 2012, the \"DRV\" announced that it was able to avoid insolvency and regain its annual grants from the German government on the condition that it sticks to a strict financial plan that would see the \"DRV\" debt free by 2018. Any violation of this plan would see the funding withdrawn and the association confronted with insolvency again.\nStructure.\nThe \"DRV\" is located and registered as a non-profit organisation in Hannover and combines the 13 regional unions (\"Landesverbände\") with 11,656 members total of which 10,023 are male and 1,633 are female players. The 108 registered clubs have 319 referees (as of January 2011). The \"DRV\" has three sub-organisations these are the German Rugby Youth ( or \"DRJ\") since 1967, the Referees Association ( or \"SDRV\") since 1996 and the German Women's Rugby Association ( or \"DRF\") since 2003. As an outcome of the \"Rugby-Tag\" in July 2010 the integration of Touch Rugby was scheduled for January 2011.\nMembership.\nThe DRV is a foundation member of Rugby Europe (1934), and became affiliated to the International Rugby Football Board, now known as World Rugby, in 1988. Moreover, it is a founding member of the German Olympic Sport Federation \"Deutscher Olympischer Sportbund\".\nPresident.\nSince the formation of the association in 1900, its presidents were:"

        "text": "Patrick Christian White (born February 25, 1986) is an American football coach and former player who is an offensive assistant for the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). He played professionally as a quarterback on the NFL and Canadian Football League (CFL). He played college football for the West Virginia Mountaineers and was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the second round of the 2009 NFL draft.\nWhite was also a baseball outfielder. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 2004 MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and in later rounds by the Cincinnati Reds in 2008 and New York Yankees in 2009, but never played for those organizations except in instructional leagues.\nEarly years.\nWhite was voted 3rd in the Mr. Football for Alabama his senior high school season. His senior season he rushed for 1,905 yards and 31 touchdowns at Daphne High. He also passed for 1,488 yards and 15 touchdowns. He became a class 6-A All-State first team for football, but played pitcher and outfield in baseball as well, winning two state championships.\nWhite was being pursued by West Virginia, Auburn, Kentucky, LSU, Mississippi State, and Vanderbilt. However, West Virginia University promised White a chance to play quarterback in college. He originally had committed to LSU as a wide receiver but changed his mind and signed his letter of intent to WVU.\nCollege career.\n2005.\nWhite passed up a career in affiliated baseball and a six-figure contract with the Anaheim Angels to play college football. He began the season as a co-starter along with Adam Bednarik. He started his season out against Syracuse, with 63 yards passing and 20 yards rushing. In the 35–7 victory over Wofford, White passed for 82 yards on six passes out of 10, and rushed for 107 yards and a score. In the 31–19 victory over Maryland, White rushed for 62 yards on nine carries. In the 20–15 victory over ECU, White scored his first ever passing touchdown of his collegiate career and added 64 yards passing. In the 34–17 loss to Virginia Tech, White came into the game in the second half. He totaled 9 passes out of 11 attempts for 85 yards for two touchdowns and 44 yards on the ground.\nWhite's shared time with Bednarik continued until the seventh game of the season against Louisville. With WVU down 24–7, White came in to replace an injured Bednarik and led the Mountaineers to a 46–44, triple overtime victory. He teamed-up with freshman running back Steve Slaton to lead the Mountaineers with his 118 total yards on the game, while Slaton scored a Big East record 6 touchdowns. The game marked the first major game in the duo's memorable career together. The next game, the 45–13 victory over Connecticut, White totaled 106 passing yards and a touchdown, along with 63 rushing yards and two touchdowns for a total of 169 yards and three scores. In the 38–0 victory over Cincinnati, White passed for 100 yards and a score and rushed for 111 yards on only eight carries for 211 total yards. It marked the first 200-yard game of his career. One of White's best games in the tenure before the bowl game was against Pittsburgh in the Backyard Brawl rivalry game. He threw for 41 yards and a touchdown, and ran for 220 yards and 2 touchdowns in the 45–13 win. It was only White's second career 200-yard game and it had come consecutively to his previous 200-yard game against Cincinnati. Against USF, White led the Mountaineers to their first undefeated Big East season since 1993 with a 177-yard, two touchdown rushing performance. He had the longest rush of his career to date, a 76-yard run, and also totaled 89 yards and score through the air for his third consecutive 200-yard game of his freshman season.\nWith White now the starting quarterback, the Mountaineers won the rest of their games to win the Big East Conference title and earn a bid to the 2006 Sugar Bowl against the Georgia Bulldogs. In what was essentially a home game for the Bulldogs as the Sugar Bowl was moved to the Georgia Dome due to Hurricane Katrina, White had what many described as his \"coming-out party\", rushing for 77 yards and throwing for 120 yards and a touchdown in WVU's 38–35 win against the Bulldogs. That season, he passed for 828 yards and 8 touchdowns. He also rushed for 952 yards and 7 touchdowns, which was then a new Big East and WVU record for quarterback rushing yards in a season. He also had three consecutive 200-yard games, which ended when he came short with 197 yards in the Sugar Bowl.\nWhite and Steve Slaton ended the season with 2,995 total yards and 24 touchdowns between the two players.\n2006.\nWhite, running back Steve Slaton, and fullback Owen Schmitt were featured on one of the six regional covers of the August 21, 2006, issue of \"Sports Illustrated\", as part of their \"Big Men On Campus\" article and their 2006–2007 college football season preview. Slaton was named West Virginia's \"Big Man On Campus\" in the same issue. White was named as one of 35 players to watch for the Walter Camp Football Foundation Player of the Year award.\nWhite followed up a tremendous freshman season with a great sophomore season, in which he passed for 1,655 yards and 13 TDs and rushed for 1,219 yards and 18 touchdowns on his way to being named the Big East Offensive Player of the Year and was named to the first-team all-Big East squad. He was considered the leader of the team and his three best performances of the year came in the Gator Bowl, in the loss to Louisville when White continued to try to come back late in the game, and against Pittsburgh in the annual rivalry game, a 45–27 win, when he threw for 204 yards and two touchdowns, and ran for 220 yards and two touchdowns. His 200+ rushing and passing yards makes him one of only eight players in NCAA history to do so in a game. He was also caught on camera mocking the Pitt Panther growl by a national ESPN audience in that game. Pittsburgh linebacker H. B. Blades, who was an all-Big East selection that season, said, \"Pat White is the best quarterback in college football,\" after the loss. In the Gator Bowl against Georgia Tech, White battled ankle, neck, and wrist injuries and a 35–17 third-quarter deficit to bring the Mountaineers back to win 38–35 without the help of back Steve Slaton, who was out with injuries as well. White took the ball on 10 of the last 12 plays, gaining 54 yards and four first downs, to run out the clock for the Mountaineers. Georgia Tech linebacker Philip Wheeler said when asked the three players he liked to watch in college football, \"Three? Forget it. How about one? Pat White. Dude is unbelievable. I mean, he can do it all. He's fast, he stronger than he looks and he can throw it. Yeah, I love watching him – as long as he's not doing it to us.\" Also against Syracuse, White rushed for a career-high 247 yards and scored four touchdowns.\nWhite earned the Alabama Athlete of the Year award on May 8, 2007, for his sophomore season. He was also granted the key to his hometown of Daphne. White's all-purpose offense total of 2,878 yards is ranked third on the most total offense yards in a season in West Virginia school history, while his 1,219 rushing yards is the most ever in a season by a West Virginia quarterback, breaking his 2005 record. His 18 rushing touchdowns is tied for a school record in a season with running backs Ira Errett Rodgers and Amos Zereoué.\nWhite and running back Steve Slaton combined for 2,963 yards and 31 touchdowns rushing in the season. They totaled 4,978 total yards and 49 touchdowns together on the season, the second-best output between the two in their three-year career together.\n2007.\nIn the season opener against Western Michigan, White ended the day going 10-of-18 with 192 yards and two touchdowns through the air, also rushing for 98 yards and two touchdowns as the Mountaineers won 62–24. White's first rushing touchdown was a 38-yard scramble. In the next week against Marshall, the Mountaineers pulled away in the second half with 42 points to win the game 48–23. White led West Virginia to the win with 149 passing yards and two touchdowns and 125 rushing yards and a touchdown – WVU's first score of the game coming off of White's 46-yard pass to Darius Reynaud. In the third game of the season against Maryland, White was eight of thirteen passing with 92 yards and eleven rushes for 22 yards and a touchdown in the 31–14 win. In the following contest against ECU, White went 18-of-20 with 186 yards and two touchdown passes and nine rushes for 44 yards and two touchdowns. White's 90% passing accuracy tied a school record set in 1970, and he completed passes to eight different receivers.\nThe Mountaineers' lost against USF 21–13 at South Florida the following game. White was injured in the game, but went 12–18 for 100 yards, although throwing his first interception on the season. The next game against Syracuse in a 55–14 win, White went 12–15 with 148 yards for a touchdown before injuring his shoulder. He also had 89 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries while being named Big East Player of the Week. At homecoming against Mississippi State, White only played the first half of the 38–13 blowout of the Bulldogs – totaling 8-of-12 passing with 61 yards and a touchdown and had five rushes for 89 yards, including a 64-yard run on the first play of the game for a touchdown. In New Jersey against #25 Rutgers, White threw for 144 yards while going 10-of-16, also rushing for 156 yards on 22 carries for a touchdown – accounting for 300 total yards of offense in the 31–3 win. Against Louisville, White led the Mountaineers to a 38–31 dramatic win. With the game tied 31–31 with less than two minutes less, White ran 50 yards for the game-winning touchdown – finishing the game by going 16-of-25 for 181 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for 147 yards on 24 carries and a touchdown (328 total yards), while also being awarded the Player of the Game honor from ESPN and named Big East Offensive Player of the Week.\nIn the 28–23 win on the road against #22 Cincinnati, White led the Mountaineers to the victory by going 13-of-19 for 140 passing yards with an interception and rushing 27 times for 155 yards and two touchdowns, a total of 295 total offensive yards. His 155 rushing yards put him over Vince Young on the career NCAA quarterback rushing list as he moved to over 3,000 career rushing yards, the first Big East quarterback ever to do so. White and the Mountaineers wrapped up the 2007 Big East Championship with their 66–21 win over #20 Connecticut. White ended the game by going 9 of 13 for 107 yards for a touchdown, but throwing a late interception, and running 16 times for 186 yards and 2 touchdowns. He ended the game with a total of 293 yards and three total touchdowns. White also passed former Mountaineer quarterback Rasheed Marshall to become the school leader for the most total touchdowns.\nWVU entered the game against Pittsburgh as 28 point favorites to win the 100th Backyard Brawl and earn a berth in the BCS championship game. The Mountaineers, however, could never get their high-powered offense going against the Panthers and were hurt by fumbles, missed field goals, a run game they could not stop, and a thumb injury to the non-throwing hand of White. Trailing by one possession late in the fourth quarter (Pat White's backup had scored the only touchdown for West Virginia), West Virginia twice had the ball in Pitt territory. White had just returned but both times failed to convert on fourth down plays. The final Pitt possession saw the underdogs run the ball out of the back of the end zone for a safety as the clock expired. West Virginia kicker Pat McAfee missed two field goals in the game and Pitt's kicker missed one. The loss cost his team a place in the national championship game.\nIn the 48–28 Fiesta Bowl victory over Oklahoma under interim head coach Bill Stewart, White earned the MVP award after passing for 176 yards and two touchdowns and rushing for 150 yards – his sixth career 300-yard game effort. White was named to the ESPN All-Bowl Team following the bowl season, being the only quarterback on the list. ESPN ranked White's performance in the Fiesta Bowl as the #9 best in BCS bowl game history.\n2008.\nWhite was named to the Preseason All-American team. To open up the 2008 football season under head coach Bill Stewart, West Virginia defeated the Villanova Wildcats 48–21. White finished the day by completing 25 of 33 passes for 208 yards and a career-best and stadium-record five touchdowns, while also rushing for 63 yards. White's five passing touchdowns before a sell-out crowd is second-best in school history only to Marc Bulger's six in 1998, and his completions and attempts were also career-highs. In the following game against ECU, White was 11-of-18 for 72 yards and rushed 20 times for 97 yards in the 24–3 loss, for a total of only 169 yards of offense. West Virginia followed-up their loss to ECU with a 17–14 loss in overtime to Colorado, in which White rushed for 149 yards and two touchdowns and passed for 43 yards on 10-of-14 passing. White's 149 yards rushing led the team and his two touchdowns were the only scores of the game for WVU.

However, White sat out for the Syracuse game with a head injury, but the Mountaineers won 17–6 – snapping White's consecutive starting streak of 19 games. White started the following game against Auburn, in which the Mountaineers won 34–17. White had two interceptions early in the game, but finished the victory with 174 yards and three touchdowns on 13-of-21 passing. West Virginia then defeated #25 Connecticut 35–13, picking up the team's first road victory of the season. In the win, White completed 11 of 18 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown and rushed 21 times for 109 yards and two touchdowns. White finished the game with 230 total yards and three touchdowns – earning him Big East Offensive Player of the Week honors. However, the Mountaineers then lost the following Big East matchup against the Cincinnati Bearcats, 26–23 in overtime after a late comeback. White finished the game 20 of 38 passing for 219 yards with two touchdowns and an interception, and also rushed 20 times for 41 yards – totaling 260 total yards in the loss. White's 38 passing attempts was a career-high.\nWhite and the Mountaineers followed their loss with a 35–21 victory over Louisville in their annual series. White finished the game with 122 yards on 6-of-11 passing for two touchdowns and a season-high 200 yards on 21 carries for three touchdowns, including a 66-yard touchdown run. White's 200 rushing yards broke the NCAA record for most rushing yards in a career by a quarterback, passing Brad Smith for first place with his then-total of 4,292 yards. White's 5 total touchdowns (all of West Virginia's scores in the game), also made him become the most prolific scorer in Big East history, passing Donovan McNabb's 10-year record of 96 total touchdowns responsible for. Following White's record-setting performance against Louisville, the Mountaineers were defeated by Pittsburgh in the Backyard Brawl to the score of 19–15. White finished the loss by going 15 of 28 passing for 143 yards with two interceptions and 12 rushes for 93 yards and a touchdown – a 54-yard scramble. White's 54-yard run was the seventh longest of his career and second longest of 2008, but his two picks allowed Pitt back to finish the comeback win.\nFor White's final regular season game as a Mountaineer, at home against South Florida, West Virginia promoted a \"White-Out\" to honor his career. In his Senior Night performance, a 13–7 victory over South Florida, White passed for 141 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 40 yards on a snow-covered field to finish his career at West Virginia in front of 48,000 white-clad fans. The Mountaineers' lone touchdown in the win, White's pass, was his 100th career touchdown and credited him with the milestone of 10,000 career total yards. Prior to the game, WVU managers scraped out the number 5 in the middle of the field in snow and formed a \"5\" in the student section with T-shirts before it opened for fans.\nWhite finished his collegiate career in the Meineke Car Care Bowl against North Carolina. White passed for a career-high 332 yards and three touchdowns on 26-of-32 attempts, also rushing 21 times for 55 yards, as the Mountaineers defeated the Tar Heels 31–30. In the victory, White became the first player in college football history to win four bowl games as a starting quarterback and was named the game MVP for the third consecutive bowl game.\nWhite ended his senior season with career-highs of 1,844 yards and 21 touchdowns on 180-of-274 passing with seven interceptions through the air and 974 yards rushing on 180 attempts for 8 touchdowns – totaling 2,818 yards and 29 touchdowns on offense. White finished his career with 6,051 yards and 56 touchdowns passing and 4,480 yards and 47 touchdowns rushing – a total of 10,531 yards and 103 touchdowns over his career. White also finished his career sixth in the NCAA among the most career victories as a starting quarterback with 34 overall. In spite of all his accomplishments, White was never an NCAA All-American and is not eligible for the College Football Hall of Fame.\nCareer Rushing Yards by Quarterback\nOn January 1, 2013, Denard Robinson of the University of Michigan surpassed White's career rushing yardage total.Robinson played the position of running back in games and accumulated rushing yards. Due to an NCAA rule, Robinson was given the career rushing record by 15 yards, even though he took handoffs at running back. White also had rushing yards as a running back when he took snaps from the wildcat formation.\nAwards and honors.\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\nStatistics.\nRegular and Post season\nBowl games\nProfessional football career.\nFollowing the end of the regular season in his senior season of 2008, White was offered and accepted a bid to the Senior Bowl, where he worked out for scouts at quarterback. NFL Network's Mike Mayock predicted White to be the Senior Bowl MVP and be a 2nd round selection, while Mel Kiper, Jr. selected White as his #5 quarterback prospect in the class. White finished the Senior Bowl going 4 of 9 passing for 95 yards with a touchdown and 31 yards rushing on three rushes – totaling 126 yards with a touchdown. He led two scoring drives, including a 39-yard touchdown pass, en route to being named the 2009 Senior Bowl MVP.\nWhite officially received an invitation to the 2009 NFL Combine.

Soon after, White appeared in a spread for \"ESPN The Magazine\"'s April 20 feature.\nMiami Dolphins.\nWhite was drafted by the Miami Dolphins with the 44th overall pick of the 2009 NFL draft, through a pick acquired from the Washington Redskins in a trade that sent Jason Taylor to Washington. After being drafted, Dolphins' general manager Jeff Ireland stated that White would be in competition for the starting quarterback job with Chad Pennington and Chad Henne, while also being used in the Wildcat formation (effectively making it a spread), and as a receiver.

        "title": "Germany national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Germany national rugby union team () represents Germany in men's international competitions. It currently plays at the second level of European rugby but is yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup. The national team first played in 1927, with rugby union in Germany being administered by the German Rugby Federation (\"Deutscher Rugby-Verband\").\nGermany competes in the Trophy Division, the second tier of the Rugby Europe International Championships, the senior men's rugby tournament for European nations below the Six Nations.\nGermany's greatest achievement in men's rugby is arguably the silver medal won at the 1900 Olympic Games.\nGermany's declared aim was originally to qualify for the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England, but then lowered this ambition to the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, for which it also failed to qualify. The national side is ranked 30th in the world (as of 26 April 2021).\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nThe German rugby union team's history began on 17 April 1927, when they played France in Paris, losing 5–30. The team established itself in their early years as number two in continental Europe, behind the French. They played 14 tests against their neighbour before the Second World War, winning two of them. As an indication of the team's strength, they did not lose to any team but France until 1937, when Italy beat them 9–7. Because Germany never played any of the Home nations, it is difficult to judge the true strength of the team from that era.\nWith the outbreak of the war in 1939, rugby came to a halt and Germany only played one more game, against Italy, in 1940. Germany lost almost a complete first XV in the war, and thus came out of it as a much weaker side, never able to repeat its pre-war successes.\nPost-Second World War.\nAfter an absence of 12 years, Germany, now considerably reduced in size and under the name of Federal Republic of Germany, played its first post-war international in 1952, beating Belgium 16–9. At the same time, in the Eastern part of the country, the German Democratic Republic, the German Democratic Republic national rugby union team was formed. The \"DRV\" continued to offer the East German \"DTSB\" to play a rugby friendly, but this was always declined by the East.\nUntil 1965, Germany played friendlies only as there was no European rugby competition it could take part in.\nThe team also made an appearance at England's home ground, Twickenham Stadium, in 1956, losing 8–26 to Harlequin F.C. on 8 September of that year.\nFrom 1965, it became part of the second tier of FIRA rugby, effectively the third tier of European rugby, the Five nations tournament being outside the FIRA structure. In 1975, it played its first international against a non-European nation, beating Morocco in Hannover.\nThe team's greatest success in the second half of the 20th century was promotion to the A group of FIRA rugby in 1981. From 1981 to 1983, Germany played ten games at this level, but won just one and were relegated back to the B level. After this, the team dropped briefly to the C level in 1985 but promptly returned to the second tier.\nGerman reunification.\nWith the German reunification, in 1991, the German Democratic Republic national rugby union team was dissolved and became part of the Federal Republic's team. In 1994, Horst Kemmling, Germany's long-standing captain, ended his international career, having played a record number of 50 games for Germany from 1976 onwards.\nWith the reorganisation of the European Nations Cup (ENC) in 2000, Germany became part of the second division.\nCentenary and Barbarians tour.\nIn 2000 the German Rugby Federation celebrated its centenary. Centenary celebrations included a banquet in the Heidelberg Castle and the hosting of the European leg of the Rugby World Cup Sevens in Heidelberg, in which the German team came close to upsetting Ireland, who had Gordon D'Arcy in their line-up. The tournament was won by the Welsh team, which featured Andy Marinos and Arwel Thomas.\nThe highlight of the Centenary season was the Centenary Match against the famous Barbarians. The Barbarians included a host of internationals including Scott Hastings, Peter Stringer, Shaun Longstaff, Jeff Probyn, Frankie Sheahan, Russell Earnshaw, Shaun Connor, John Langford and Derwyn Jones and won 47-19 against a determined German team.\nGermany remained in the second division of the European Nations Cup until 2008, when it achieved promotion to the top level, facing Europe's number 7 to 11 teams in 2009 and 2010. Its declared aim at this level was to avoid relegation; qualification for the 2011 Rugby World Cup was not really expected from the team.\nWith over 8,000 spectators, Germany's home game against the Netherlands in Hanover, at the Rudolf-Kalweit-Stadion in April 2007, achieved the best crowd figures for a rugby match in Germany since the pre-Second World War days.\nGermany was unbeaten at home from 12 November 2000, when it lost to Ukraine, until 8 November 2008, when it lost to a Welsh selection.\nENC 2008–10.\nIn March 2009, coach Mark Kuhlmann stepped down after three and a half years in office, while the other two coaches Rudolf Finsterer and Bruno Stolorz, remained in the job. Stolorz was seconded to the German team by the Fédération française de rugby to improve Germany's performance in the sport.\nAfter five losses in the European Nations Cup in 2009, Germany achieved a win in a friendly against Hong Kong late in the year. Germany also managed a 15–12 victory over Switzerland but, as the German team had only one regular player in its side, captain Kehoma Brenner, the team was referred to as \"Germany A\". Mustafa Güngör became Germany's new captain on 8 December 2009, after the retirement of the previous captain Jens Schmidt, and played his first game in this role four days later, against Hong Kong. Germany fielded eight uncapped players in this game. A planned game against the British Forces in Germany in January 2010 had to be called off twice because of bad weather.\nDespite disappointing results on the field and the distinct possibility of Germany being relegated, the sport made some progress in the country in 2009–10. With the admittance of sevens rugby to the Olympic Games, rugby in Germany is now eligible for federal grants. Additionally, the \"Bundeswehr\", the German army, has agreed to admit eight to ten players per year to its sports program, making those players effectively professionals.\nIn October 2009, the \"DRV\" decided to set its aim at playing two friendlies every year in November at home and two in January abroad. It also plans to organise a 10-day tour in Europe every year from 2013.\nAfter disappointing results against Georgia, Portugal and Romania in spring 2010, the team's performance improved against Russia. In its final ENC game against Spain, where a victory by eleven points was needed, Germany played their best game in the campaign yet but nevertheless lost and was relegated. As a consequence, coach Rudolf Finsterer resigned after ten years of service. He was replaced by Torsten Schippe in July 2010, with South African Jakobus Potgieter as Schippes assistant.\nENC 2010–12.\nGermany suffered a defeat in its opening game of the 2010–2012 European Nations Cup First Division B, losing to Poland 17–22 after leading 17–9 at half time. The defeat was seen as unnecessary by the President of the German Rugby Federation, Claus-Peter Bach, but he also considered Poland's victory as deserved. Germany went into the match with a new coach and assistant, a new captain, Alexander Widiker and five uncapped players.\nGermany finally achieved its first win in the ENC since 26 April 2008, when it beat the Netherlands in Amsterdam on 27 November 2010. Its last victory in the European competition had come at the same place against the same opposition, just over 31-month earlier.\nAfter a disappointing first half of the campaign, where Germany only won one of its five games, the team improved and won three in the second half, consequently finishing fourth overall out of six teams. With the final game against Moldova, Germany's captain Alexander Widiker played his 50th game for his country, thereby equaling Horst Kemmling's record.\nENC 2012–14.\nGermany again competed in the European Nations Cup First Division B in 2012–2014, once more facing Poland, Moldova and the Czech Republic. Additionally, it also competed against Ukraine, relegated from the A group, and Sweden, promoted from the Second Division. Germany's first match was on 27 October when it played Ukraine at home. Before that the team played an unofficial warm up match against the New Zealand Ambassador's XV on 13 October 2012, a team that featured former All Black Keith Lowen in its ranks, and ended in a 22–20 victory for Germany.\nGermany won its opening match against Ukraine 46–28, a game in which captain Alexander Widiker became the country's record international rugby union player with 51 games. After a loss to Poland, Germany finished 2012 with a win over Moldova. The German team lost a warm up match to a Welsh student selection in February 2013 before winning its first competitive match in 2013, against Czech Republic, 27-8. Germany finished the first phase of the campaign with a 73-17 victory over Sweden.\nGermany's coach Torsten Schippe resigned from his post in April 2013, citing work commitments as the reason, despite achieving good results with his team.\nSchippe was replaced by his assistant Kobus Potgieter as coach of the German team. Germany started the autumn of 2013 with two wins in friendlies against the B team of the Czech Republic and the New Zealand Ambassador's XV, the later with former All Black captain Taine Randell in its ranks. It then won its away match against Ukraine before winning at home against Poland, thereby taking back the lead in its division. Germany lost its last game of 2013, 15–30 to Moldova, but won comfortably 76–12 against the Czech Republic in April 2014. This game was to be the 58th and last for German captain and record international Alexander Widiker as he retired from international rugby after that.\nGermany's last game of the 2012–14 campaign was against Sweden on 26 April where a bonus point win would guarantee the side the championship, promotion and an advancement in the Rugby World Cup qualifying. Germany won the game 45–20 to advance to a play-off game against the Netherlands in the 2015 Rugby World Cup – Europe qualification, which they won 17-7. They played Russia for a chance to qualify for the Repechage and lead 20–17 up to the 77th minute but eventually lost 20–31 and were knocked out of the qualifying.\nENC 2014–16.\nGermany played two warm up matches in 2014. Germany played a match against the New Zealand Ambassadors XV which it won 21–19. Germany then lost to Namibia 58–20.\nGermany is competing in the European Nations Cup First Division 1A in 2014–16. It is facing Georgia, Portugal, Romania, Russia and Spain in this competition, the same opponents it faced at its last stint at this level when it lost all ten games and was relegated. Germany began its ENC campaign in February 2015 with an 8–64 loss against Georgia. It also lost the following four games against Russia, Portugal, Romania and Spain. Germany thereby ended the first half of the 2014–16 campaign in sixth and last place with just one point out of five games, a bonus point earned against Rumania.\nGermany played two friendlies against Brazil, on 28 November in Blumenau, and 4 December in São Paulo as warm-up matches for the upcoming European Nations Cup games. In the first-ever game against a South American opponent Germany won 29–12 and thereby climbed to 27th spot in the world ranking. After losing the first two games of the 2016 campaign Germany defeated Portugal 50–27 in Hanover in front of over 8,000 spectators. After losing to Romania Germany drew their final game of the campaign, against Spain, thereby finishing in fifth place, above Portugal, and avoiding relegation.\nEurope International Championships 2016–17.\nGermany played in the 2016–17 Championship Division of the Europe International Championships.\nCompetitions.\nThe performance of the German team since introduction of the European Nations Cup in 2000.\nMatch results.\nNotable wins.\nThe following table shows all German wins during the Rugby World Cup era (1987–present) against teams that have played in a Rugby World Cup.\nSource:\nRecord.\nOverall.\nResults listed includes games that was played as West Germany.

        "title": "Doping in baseball",
        "text": "Doping in baseball has been an ongoing issue for Major League Baseball (MLB). After repeated use by some of the most successful professional baseball players in MLB history, these banned substances found their way to the collegiate level. At the junior college level, due to lack of funding and NCAA drug testing, the abuse of PEDs is most common, but they are also an issue in Division I, II and III.\nSeveral players have suggested that drug use is rampant in baseball. In 2003 David Wells stated that \"25 to 40 percent of all Major Leaguers are juiced\". Jose Canseco stated on \"60 Minutes\" and in his 2005 tell-all book \"\" that as many as 80% of players used steroids, and that he credited steroid use for his entire career. Ken Caminiti revealed that he won the National League MVP award while on steroids. In February 2009, after reports emerged alleging that Alex Rodriguez tested positive for steroids in , a year in which he was American League MVP, he admitted to having used performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) between and 2003. Mark McGwire, dogged by allegations of PED use for years, admitted in January 2010 that he had used steroids and human growth hormone off and on for over a decade, including in when he set the single-season home run record.\nHistorical usage.\nOrigins.\nPlayers have attempted to gain chemical advantages in baseball since the earliest days of the sport. In 1889, for example, pitcher Pud Galvin became the first baseball player to be widely known for his use of performance-enhancing substances. Galvin was a user and vocal proponent of the Brown-Séquard Elixir, a testosterone supplement derived from the testicles of live animals such as dogs and guinea pigs.\nThe book \"The Baseball Hall of Shame's Warped Record Book\", written by Bruce Nash, Bob Smith, Allan Zullo, and Lola Tipton, includes an account of Babe Ruth administering to himself an injection of an extract from sheep testicles. The experimental concoction allegedly proved ineffective, making Ruth ill and leading the Yankees to attribute his absence from the lineup to \"a bellyache\".\nDuring World War II, both the Allied and Axis powers systematically provided amphetamines to their troops, in order to improve soldiers' endurance and mental focus. After the end of the war, many of those returning troops attended college, and when they did, they applied their knowledge of the benefits of amphetamine use first to college sports, and then to professional sports, including professional baseball.\nEarly history.\nAccording to writer Zev Chafets, Mickey Mantle's fade during his 1961 home run chase with Roger Maris was the indirect result of an attempt by Mantle to gain a substance-based edge. Chafets alleges that Mantle was hampered by an abscess created by a botched injection of a chemical cocktail administered by a \"quack\" doctor, Max Jacobsen. According to Chafets, the injection included steroids and amphetamines, among other substances.\nIn his autobiography \"I Had a Hammer\", which was co-written with Lonnie Wheeler and published in 1992, outfielder Hank Aaron wrote that he accepted an amphetamine pill from an unnamed teammate and took it before a game during the 1968 season, after becoming frustrated about his lack of offensive performance. Aaron described it as \"a stupid thing to do\", observing that the pill made him feel like he \"was having a heart attack\".\nFormer pitcher Tom House, drafted in 1967 and active in MLB from 1971–1978, has admitted to using \"steroids they wouldn't give to horses\" during his playing career. According to House, the use of performance-enhancing drugs was widespread at that time. He estimates that \"six or seven\" pitchers on every team were at least experimental users of steroids or human growth hormone, and says that after losses, players would frequently joke that they'd been \"out-milligrammed\" rather than beaten.\nThe \"Steroid Era\".\nThe period of time, usually placed sometime between the late 1980s and late 2000s has been dubbed the \"Steroid Era\" by some authors, due to allegations of increased steroid use among MLB players at this time. In \"Steroids\" \"and\" \"Major League Baseball\", the \"Pre Steroids Era\" is defined as running from 1985 to 1993, while the \"Steroids Era\" runs from 1994 to 2004.\nThird baseman Mike Schmidt, an active player from 1972–1989, admitted to Murray Chass in 2006 that he had used amphetamines \"a couple [of] times\". In his book \"Clearing the Bases\", he said that amphetamines \"were widely available in major-league clubhouses\" during his playing career, and that \"amphetamine use in baseball is both far more common and has been going on a lot longer than steroid abuse\".\nRelief pitcher Goose Gossage, active from 1972–1994, also admitted to using amphetamines during his playing career, in a 2013 interview with Ken Davidoff. In the same interview, Gossage voiced the opinion that amphetamines are not \"a performance-enhancing drug\", though he admitted that using them was illegal at the time.\nDuring the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985, several players testified about the use of amphetamines in baseball. Shortstop Dale Berra admitted that he had used \"greenies\" while playing for both the Pittsburgh Pirates and the AAA Portland Beavers, and stated that while in Pittsburgh between 1979 and 1984 he had been supplied with the drugs by teammates Bill Madlock and Willie Stargell. Outfielder John Milner testified that while he was playing for the New York Mets, he had seen in the locker of teammate Willie Mays a powerful liquid amphetamine he called the \"red juice\".\nIn 1988, sportswriter Thomas Boswell claimed that Jose Canseco was the most conspicuous user of steroids in MLB. Later that year, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 criminalized the use and distribution of anabolic steroids.\nSteroids finally made it to baseball's banned substance list in 1991, however testing for major league players did not begin until the 2003 season. While testing for steroids began, the usage did not stop.\nJose Canseco.\nIn 2005, Jose Canseco released a tell-all book, \"\", about his experience with steroids in his career. In the book, Canseco named several other players, including Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez, Juan Gonzalez and Jason Giambi, as steroid users. The book caused great controversy, and most of these players claimed Canseco's implications to be false, though McGwire and Giambi later admitted to using PEDs, and Palmeiro has tested positive.\nIn 2008, Canseco released another book, \"Vindicated\", about his frustrations in the aftermath of the publishing of \"Juiced\". In it, he discusses his belief that Alex Rodriguez also used steroids. The claim was proven true with Rodriguez's admission in 2009, just after his name was leaked as being on the list of 103 players who tested positive for banned substances in Major League Baseball. In July 2013, Alex Rodriguez was again under investigation for using banned substances provided by Biogenesis of America. He was suspended for the entirety of the 2014 season.\nIn January 2010, Mark McGwire admitted to using steroids throughout his professional baseball career. He claimed to only have used steroids for health reasons and for quick recovery, never for strength or size gains. These claims were publicly disputed by McGwire's steroid supplier, who stated that he did, in fact, use steroids to gain a competitive edge. The admission of steroid use caused some to question whether or not his long list of accomplishments should be invalidated. His most famous accomplishment took place in the 1998 season when he broke the single season home run record previously held by Roger Maris.\nIt was after this accomplishment that McGwire and other MLB players came under scrutiny for use of steroids. A news reporter, Steve Wilstein stumbled upon an open container of androstenedione in McGwire's locker in August of the '98 season. At the time androstenedione was not on the banned substance list for Major League Baseball, but was viewed as a precursor to anabolic steroids and was banned by the International Olympic Committee, the National Football League, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association.\nCongressional investigation.\nThe nutrition center BALCO was accused of distributing steroids to many star players, most notably Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi. Baseball has attempted to toughen its drug policy, beginning a plan of random tests to players. Players such as Ryan Franklin and others were handed suspensions as short as ten days. However, a Congressional panel continued to argue that the penalties were not tough enough, and took action.\nMany top players, including Canseco, Rafael Palmeiro, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Curt Schilling were summoned on March 17, 2005, to testify in front of Congress (Schilling was summoned because of his outspoken opposition to the use of PEDs). During the session, Canseco admitted his steroid use which he claims was perfectly acceptable during the 1980s and early 1990s. Palmeiro denied all steroid use during his career, while McGwire refused to discuss the issue, contending that he would be considered guilty no matter what he said. His repeated statement \"I'm not here to talk about the past,\" became the most highlighted moment of the proceedings.\nPalmeiro, who was listed in Canseco's book as a user along with McGwire, denied Canseco's claims and told Congress that those claims were absolutely erroneous. The committee had stated that baseball had failed to confront the problems of performance-enhancing drugs. The committee was disturbed by the accepted use of steroids by athletes because it created a bad persona of players who in many cases are role models to many of the aspiring youth. During the testimonies the players called to Congress offered their condolences for youthful athletes who had committed suicide after using performance-enhancing drugs.\nFive months after the Congressional hearing, information came out indicating Palmeiro had already tested positive for steroids and knew it when he spoke before Congress. He appealed but the test results and ensuing suspension were upheld. Mark McGwire, whose credentials could arguably satisfy expectations for first ballot Hall of Fame election, was denied election in his first year, with many voters citing McGwire's perceived refusal to speak at the Congressional Investigation.\nBALCO scandal.\nDuring this period, Bonds' trainer Greg Anderson and BALCO head Victor Conte (also connected to Jason Giambi and Canseco) were not subpoenaed in California by the House Committee for investigation.\nAs a result of pressure from Congress, baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association started applying stricter regulations and applied a zero tolerance policy in correspondence to performance-enhancing drugs. On August 1, 2005, Palmeiro tested positive for performing-enhancing substances and was suspended ten days. Once thought to be a lock for the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of only four players to have both 3,000 hits and 500 home runs, Palmeiro's legacy has since been called into question. Palmeiro's career quickly plummeted, and he did not play again following the 2005 season after his contract expired.\nThe Bonds controversy continues, especially now that he has surpassed the All-Time Home Run record with 762 career home runs; the media continues to pressure Bonds with questions over the issue. In 2006, the book \"Game of Shadows\" was published offering researched claims that Bonds' trainer was providing illegal performance enhancers to Bonds and other athletes. Bonds had admitted that he did use a clear substance and lotion given to him by his trainer but had no idea that they were any sort of performance enhancers. Bonds claimed that to his knowledge, the substances given to him were legal to treat his arthritis.\n2006 Baseball steroids investigation.\nOn March 29, 2006, ESPN learned that former Senator, Boston Red Sox board member, and Disney chairman George J. Mitchell would head an investigation into past steroid use by Major League Baseball players, including San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds. Mitchell was appointed by baseball commissioner Bud Selig in the wake of controversy over the book \"Game of Shadows\", which chronicles alleged extensive use of performance-enhancing drugs, including several different types of steroids and human growth hormones Bonds allegedly had taken. Selig did not refer to Bonds by name in announcing the investigation, and many past and present players would be investigated. Mitchell took on a role similar to that of John Dowd, who investigated Pete Rose's alleged gambling in the late 1980s. However, Selig acknowledged that the book, by way of calling attention to the issue, was in part responsible for the league's decision to commission an independent investigation. A report of the investigation released on December 13, 2007, named more than 80 former and current baseball players.\nOn June 6, 2006, Arizona Diamondbacks relief pitcher Jason Grimsley's home was searched by federal agents. He later admitted to using human growth hormone, steroids, and amphetamines. According to court documents, Grimsley failed a baseball drug test in 2003 and allegedly named other current and former players who also used drugs. On June 7, 2006, he was released by the Diamondbacks, reportedly at his own request.\nMLB steroid policy.\nOver most of the course of Major League Baseball history, steroid testing was not a major issue. In 1991, Commissioner Fay Vincent sent a memo to all teams stating that steroid use was against the rules, though there was no official rule change. Vincent has said that the memo was intended as a \"moral statement\" to the players, rather than a \"legal one\", that \"the only way a change could be made was through collective bargaining,\" and \"When I left baseball, there was no written policy on drug activity in baseball.\"\nThe 1991 memo did not ban the use of steroids. Steroids were first banned from use in MLB in 2005, with HGH banned from use in 2011. Fay Vincent is actually on record stating that Congress has a list of illegal substances that include steroids that one must obtain via a prescription. He is on record of saying that he in no way banned steroids from MLB, but merely passed along the information that Congress considered the substances illegal without a prescription.\nAfter the BALCO scandal, which involved allegations that top baseball players had used illegal performance-enhancing drugs, Major League Baseball banned steroids. The policy, which was accepted by Major League Baseball players and owners, was issued at the start of the 2005 season and went as follows:\nA first positive test resulted in a suspension of ten games, a second positive test resulted in a suspension of 30 games, the third positive test resulted in a suspension of 60 games, the fourth positive test resulted in a suspension of one full year, and a fifth positive test resulted in a penalty at the commissioner's discretion. Players were tested at least once per year, with the chance that several players could be tested many times.\nThis program replaced the previous steroid testing program under which no player was suspended in 2004. Under the old policy, which was established in 2002, a first-time offense would result in treatment for the player and the player would not be named.\nIn November 2005, MLB owners and players approved even tougher penalties for positive tests. Under the new rules, a first positive test would result in a 50-game suspension, a second positive test would result in a 100-game suspension, and a third positive test would result in a lifetime suspension from MLB.\nOn March 28, 2014, the players and owners announced that the penalties for a positive test would be increased to an 80-game suspension for the first offense, then escalate to a 162-game suspension for the second offense, and a lifetime ban from the sport for the third. Players suspended for the season will not be allowed to participate in post-season games. Suspensions do not allow the player to be paid while suspended. This steroid policy brings MLB closer to international rules.\nOn February 7, 2022, the Associated Press reported that Major League Baseball has stopped testing players for steroids for the first time in nearly 20 years due to the expiration of the sport's drug agreement, two people familiar with the sport's Joint Drug Program stated. The people spoke on condition of anonymity Monday because no public announcement was made. At the time, MLB and the union declined comment on the halt. The halt in testing was due to a 99 day lockout, which ended on March 10, 2022. Testing resumed at that time, but doping and antidoping experts both expressed concern that there was ample time for foul play.\nBarry Bonds's trial.\nSteven Hoskins, on Wednesday, March 23, 2010, testified against Barry Bonds as a government witness in the perjury and obstruction of justice case against the former baseball star. Hoskins described Barry Bonds's use of anabolic steroids, and how his personal trainer, Greg Anderson, would discuss taking the steroids in an open manner. Even though Hoskins never witnessed Barry Bonds actually taking the drugs, he witnessed Anderson handling the needle, and Barry Bonds going in and out of the bedroom, and Barry Bonds complaining about the shots leaving his butt sore. Barry Bonds would use his girlfriends to get the steroids, and would pay them a few thousand dollars at a time. \nBiogenesis anti-aging clinic.\nOn January 10, 2013, MLB and the players union reached an agreement to add random, in season human growth hormone testing and a new test to reveal the use of testosterone. This testing began in the 2013 season and at least twenty MLB players (and athletes in other sports) were accused of taking HGH. Ultimately 14 were suspended, most famously Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers (suspended for final 65 games of 2013 season), Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees (suspended for 211 games (later reduced to 162 games which was the entirety of the 2014 season)), and Nelson Cruz of the Texas Rangers (50 games). The clinic was run by Anthony “Tony” Bosch in Florida. The notebooks he kept made it clear that he supplied human growth hormones, anabolic steroids, and performance-enhancing drug lozenges to his clients, which not only included professional athletes but teenagers as well. It was later revealed that Bosch is not a doctor and has a fake medical degree.\nDoping in college baseball.\nAlthough the NCAA randomly drug-tests student athletes from Division I to Division III, the abuse of performance-enhancing drugs is not uncommon in the college level. It is up to the schools and universities whether they want to implement their own drug testing policy, which most do. The shortcut to the MLB is found in the junior college level or the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). The NJCAA does not drug-test their student athletes so it is up to that college whether or not the players are drug tested at all. Players in JuCo are also eligible for the MLB draft after one year in college. This allows players a way to get around drug tests while also taking a quicker route to the pros which is very appealing to many of the top prospects. Two former LSU baseball players admitted that it was much easier to cheat the drug test at their junior colleges and that they had suspicions about certain teams that they played. Even though this is where the use of PEDs is most common, they are still a problem in NCAA as well. Today 10 percent of Division I, 35 percent of Division II, and 79 percent of Division III schools have their own drug test policy. The head baseball coach for LSU, Paul Maineri, said in 2009 that after recruiting certain players from junior colleges that were not the same after showing up on campus, \"In retrospect looking back, I’m a little smarter and would recognize that the players I recruited were doing something artificially help them in junior college\". Many MLB scouts along with coaches worry about drafting or recruiting players that are using performance-enhancing drugs with the concern that they would not be the same player after they arrive.\nMLB Drug Program.\nMajor league baseball had established a anti-drug policy program to prevent any sort substances banned by the league. The Office of the Commissioner of Baseball states that using these banned substances puts players health at risk and also puts layers at an unfair advantage. The MLB has created many jointed sub programs listed below. \nEffects on Hall of Fame.\nMcGwire remained on the Hall of Fame ballot for the full ten years of eligibility, but never polled more than 24% of the vote. 75% of the vote is required for election.\nIn the 2013 election, not a single player was voted into the Hall of Fame by the BBWAA. With players such as Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, and Sammy Sosa making their first appearance on the ballot, there was great debate on the use of steroids surrounding the legitimacy of their performance toward election. With the topic of steroid use coming into the picture during these player's careers and the Mitchell report released in 2007 investigating past steroid and human growth hormone use, the perception of these accomplishments has been debated as \"controversial to the game of baseball and America's view on the sport\".\nFans of the sport continue to debate whether or not these players should be elected, with some thinking that if they were to be, it might send a message to the world of baseball that it is acceptable to use steroids. Despite this, others believe their accomplishments in the sport outweigh their negative associations with doping. In the 2019 election, Bonds and Clemens ballots had over 59% of the vote, compared to a little over 36% in 2013. In the 2022 election, Bonds and Clemens final year on the ballot, Bonds had 66%, and Clemens had 65%, and missed the Hall of Fame."

        "title": "The Royal Dublin Golf Club",
        "text": "The Royal Dublin Golf Club, founded in 1885, is Ireland's third oldest golf club. It is a private members' club, with an 18-hole links course on Bull Island, Dublin, Ireland. The championship routing that we recognise today was by designed by Harry Colt in the 1920s. Over a three-year period from 2004 the links was extended under the guidance of golf architect Martin Hawtree.\nHistory.\nOrigins and early locations.\nThe Royal Dublin Golf Club was instituted at a meeting held at No. 19 Grafton Street in May 1885, pioneered by a Scottish banker - John Lumsden. Originally called Dublin Golf Club, it received its Royal designation in 1891, when there were 250 members paying an £2 annual subscription (after an entrance fee of 8 guineas). It was originally located near the Magazine Fort in the Phoenix Park, moved to Sutton after a year, and finally in 1889 moved to its present home on North Bull Island (the name may be derived from the locality, Clontarf, which in Gaelic is Cluain Tairbh meaning the Meadow of the Bull).\nBull Island.\nCaptain William Bligh of Mutiny on the Bounty fame was, in the early 19th century, one of those invited to solve the long-standing problems of providing shipping with a safe, straight and deep approach into Dublin. As a result, it was decided to build a sea wall three kilometres out from the shore. The resulting sand bank, Bull Island, still continues to grow. The timber bridge was built in the autumn of 1819 and the Great North Wall, more popularly known as the Bull Wall, was completed by 1823. The club owns the entire links, covering 65 hectares.\nDuring the First World War, the course was taken over by the military and used as a rifle and artillery range, and after the War, the clubhouse was in a very dilapidated condition and the course severely damaged. With £10,000 compensation from the military, and starting in 1919, 64 firing ranges were disassembled by hand, the clubhouse was re-constructed and the links course was redesigned by H. S. (Harry) Colt, the world-famous golf course architect from Sunningdale.\nOn the night of 2 August 1943 the Clubhouse was totally destroyed by fire. Due to delays in finalising development plans for Bull Island, it was not until ten years later that the new clubhouse was opened.\n21st century.\nEarly in the 2000s the membership of the club decided to carry out a renovation of the Colt design. Martin Hawtree was engaged to modernise the classic out-and-back layout. Hawtree's work, delivered between 2004 and 2006 saw the creation of two new holes, the significant raising of the majority of green sites and the addition of around 450 yards to the length of the course, bringing it to 7,268 yards.\nIn 2019 the firm of Clayton, de Vries and Pont (CDP) was engaged to audit the course bunkering scheme. The audit investigated the possibility of returning the overall bunker style to something more fitting with the clubs Colt design heritage.\nIn 2022 club members voted to approve the CDP recommendations, works are due to commence in November 2022 lasting several months.\nLocation.\nThe club is on Bull Island in Dublin Bay. Accessed at one end via an old wooden bridge, or via a modern causeway mid-way along, Bull Island is a sand bank formed as a result of the construction of a sea wall in the 19th century. The club occupies lands from the causeway to the centre of Bull Island to the Bull Wall, running from Clontarf to Raheny. The clubhouse and main entrance are at the Clontarf end, and a service entrance at the Raheny end. The club owns its grounds, while the rest of the island is city property, including the Wooden Bridge and Bull Wall, which previously belonged to Dublin Port.\nEvents.\nThe Royal Dublin has held the Irish Open six times - in 1931, 1936, 1951, 1983, 1984, and 1985. The Royal Dublin hosted the Irish Amateur Open for the first time in 1894, when it was won by J. Ball Jr. of Royal Liverpool and on many occasions since including continuously since 1998 with the exception of three years when the course was undergoing reconstruction. The club regularly welcomes participants in GUI cups and shields.\nThe club has won the Barton Cup, the most prestigious competition in Leinster golf, on five occasions: for the first time in 1946 and again in 1951, 1967, 1979 and 2006.\nFamous visitors.\nIn 1890, just five years after its inception, the Club moved to its current home on Bull Island in Dublin Bay. The links made an immediate impact on the golfing world. Perhaps the greatest pioneer in the history of the game, Old Tom Morris, came to Royal Dublin and played two matches here on 7 June 1894. Also in that year, Royal Dublin hosted its first championship event, the Irish Amateur Open.\nThe list of great golfers who have played the links is long and distinguished, and includes major winners like Ian Woosnam, Ian Baker-Finch, Curtis Strange, Sandy Lyle, Corey Pavin, Bob Charles and Wayne Grady. In addition, television commentator David Feherty won his first professional tournament at Royal Dublin - the 1980 Irish National PGA Championship. In fact Royal Dublin hosted the tournament from 1978 through 1980 and was won by Christy O'Connor, Des Smyth and David Feherty respectively. The tournament continues to this day as the Irish PGA Championship which was won by Padraig Harrington the week before both of his British Open victories. Since then the greatest golfers in the world - both professional and amateur - have come to play in some of Ireland's great tournaments at the famed links.\nFamous non-professional golfers who have visited the club, include former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, the former Presidents of Ireland, Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese, and the former American President, Bill Clinton.\nControversy.\nThe club has faced public criticism for restrictions on membership for women. The club website does not specifically mention restrictions for female members, however a 2017 \"Irish Times\" article highlighted the club's restrictive policy with respect to female members in the context of recent changes internationally, with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St. Andrews's in Scotland ending its policy banning female members in 2014.\nIn 2021 the members of Royal Dublin voted to amend the clubs’ constitution to allow for female membership."

        "text": "George Burnett (born March 25, 1962) is the general manager of the Guelph Storm of the Ontario Hockey League. Burnett previously played in the OHL with the London Knights, and later became a two-time OHL Coach of the Year and won an OHL championship in his first tour of duty with the Guelph Storm. Burnett was head coach and general manager of the Belleville Bulls for 11 seasons, and drafted all three Subban brothers into the OHL; P. K. Subban, Malcolm Subban and Jordan Subban.\nBurnett briefly coached in the National Hockey League for three seasons. He was head coach of the Edmonton Oilers for part of the 1994–95 season, and was an assistant coach for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for two seasons. Burnett coached in the American Hockey League for four seasons, winning one division title and one Calder Cup championship. Burnett was the head coach of Canada's U18 National team which won the gold medal at the Six Nations Cup in the Czech Republic in 2001, and another gold medal at the 2010 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament. Burnett was assistant coach for the Canada's U20 National Junior team at the 2011 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and the 2012 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships winning silver and bronze medals.\nPlaying career.\nLondon Knights (1979–1982).\nBurnett began playing junior hockey with the London Knights of the OMJHL in the 1979–80 season.

However, in 2002 it was decided that one team was needed in the competition. They narrowly missed out on a finals spot in 2002, being on equal points but with a lower For and Against than the Marist Richmond Brothers. Unfortunately this was a high point for the franchise with the team never making the play-offs.\nThe Orca nickname was adopted for the 2006 season, adopting the name from the Southern Orcas consortium – a group attempting to gain an expansion National Rugby League competition licence that was instead granted to the Gold Coast Titans group. Previously they were known as Wellington Franchise.\nNotable players included Ben Matulino and Simon Mannering.\n2008–2009: Bartercard Premiership.\nWellington Rugby League were awarded a place in the new six-team National Provincial Competition.

        "text": "David William Cameron (born July 29, 1958) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former professional player. He is currently the head coach of the Ottawa 67's of the Ontario Hockey League. He was previously the head coach of the Vienna Capitals of the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga (EBEL) and the head coach of the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL) from December 2014 until the conclusion of the 2015–16 season. He also played in the NHL as a forward with the Colorado Rockies and New Jersey Devils between 1981 and 1984.\nCameron has been involved in coaching in ice hockey since the mid-1990s. From 1995 to 1997, he was head coach of the Detroit Falcons/Port Huron Border Cats franchise in the Colonial Hockey League. He then joined the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) as head coach of the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds from 1997 to 1999, followed by being head coach of the Toronto St. Michael's Majors from 2000 to 2004. Cameron joined the American Hockey League (AHL) in 2004 when he became head coach of the Binghamton Senators until 2007, when he returned to the OHL as head coach of the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors until 2011. He then joined the NHL's Ottawa Senators as an assistant coach when Paul MacLean became the team's new head coach, and remained in that position until becoming head coach himself in December 2014.\nCameron has also coached in the international setting, including leading the Canada men's national under-18 ice hockey team to gold at the 2004 U-18 Junior World Cup.\nPlaying career.\nCameron played university hockey with the University of Prince Edward Island from 1976 to 1979, during which he recorded 27 goals and 62 assists (89 points) in 49 games with the Panthers ice hockey team. He was drafted by the New York Islanders in the eighth round of the 1978 NHL Entry Draft.\nAfter completing his university career, Cameron split the 1979–80 season between the Fort Wayne Komets of the International Hockey League and the Indianapolis Checkers of the Central Hockey League (CHL). In six games with the Komets, Cameron had three goals and six assists (nine points), and in 70 games with the Checkers, Cameron had 15 goals and 21 assists (36 points). In the playoffs, he had no points in seven games with Indianapolis.\nCameron returned to the Checkers for the 1980–81 season, where he had a breakout season, scoring 40 goals and 30 assists (70 points) in 78 games, along with 156 penalty minutes. In five playoff games, Cameron had two goals and three assists. On October 1, 1981, the Islanders traded Cameron and Bob Lorimer to the Colorado Rockies in exchange for the Rockies' first-round draft pick in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft, which the Islanders used to select future Hockey Hall of Famer Pat LaFontaine.\nCameron spent the 1981–82 season with the Rockies, save for two games with the Fort Worth Texans of the CHL. With Colorado, Cameron recorded 11 goals and 12 assists (23 points) in 66 games as the club failed to qualify for the 1982 Stanley Cup playoffs. During the subsequent off-season, the Rockies franchise was relocated to East Rutherford, New Jersey, to become the New Jersey Devils.\nCameron struggled in his second NHL season, as appeared in 35 games with the New Jersey Devils in 1982–83, scoring five goals and four assists (nine points). Cameron also spent time with the Wichita Wind of the CHL, scoring 6 goals and 9 assists (15 points) in 25 games.\nCameron spent the entire 1983–84 season with the Devils, scoring 9 goals and 12 assists (21 points) in a career-high 67 games.\nCameron split the 1984–85 season with the Maine Mariners and the Moncton Golden Flames of the American Hockey League (AHL), where he had 8 goals and 17 assists (25 points) in 49 games. After the season, he went back home and played with the Charlottetown Islanders and Fredericton Alpines of the NBSHL. During the 1994–95 season, Cameron made a one-game appearance with the Saint John Flames of the AHL.\nCoaching career.\nDetroit Falcons/Port Huron Border Cats (1995–1997).\nIn 1995, Cameron was named as the head coach of the Detroit Falcons of the Colonial Hockey League. In his first season with the club, the Falcons went 33–32–9, finishing in third place in the East Division. In the first round of the playoffs, the Falcons upset the West Division winning Muskegon Fury in five games, however, Detroit lost in five games against the Flint Generals.\nIn 1996, the Falcons relocated and became the Port Huron Border Cats to start the 1996–97 season. The Border Cats record improved to 38–31–5, which placed them once again in third place in the East Division. In the playoffs, Port Huron lost in five games to the Brantford Smoke in the first round.\nSault Ste. Marie Greyhounds (1997–1999).\nCameron then moved to the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), as he became the head coach of the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. In his first season with the club in 1997–98, the rebuilding team struggled, as they finished with a 20–39–7 record, earning 47 points and missing the playoffs.\nIn 1998–99, the Greyhounds improved to a 31–29–8 record, earning 70 points and sixth place in the Western Conference. Sault Ste. Marie was eliminated by the Owen Sound Platers in the first round in five games.\nSt. John's Maple Leafs (1999–2000).\nCameron moved on to the AHL's St. John's Maple Leafs as an assistant to head coach Al MacAdam in 1999–2000. In his only season with the Maple Leafs, the club had a league-worst 23–45–8–4 record, earning only 58 points as St. John's finished well out of a playoff spot.\nToronto St. Michael's Majors (2000–2004).\nCameron returned to the OHL in 2000 as head coach of the Toronto St. Michael's Majors. In his first season with the team in 2000–01, the Majors improved by 38 points, as they went 35–23–8–2 and made the playoffs for the first time since the rebirth of the team in 1997. St. Michael's defeated the Peterborough Petes in seven games in the first round, followed by another thrilling seven-game series win in the second round against the Sudbury Wolves. The Majors then fell in four-straight against the Ottawa 67's in the Eastern Conference Finals.\nSt. Michael's continued to improve in 2001–02, as the team finished with a 40–19–8–1 record to earn an Eastern Conference best 89 points. The Majors quickly swept the North Bay Centennials in the first round, then defeated the Ottawa 67's in the second round in seven games. St. Michael's then lost in the Eastern Conference Finals for the second-straight year, as the Barrie Colts swept the Majors in four games.\nIn 2002–03, the Majors slipped to fourth place in the Eastern Conference, as they had a 32–24–7–5 record, earning 76 points. In the first round of the playoffs, St. Michael's defeated the Belleville Bulls in a close seven-game series, followed by a five-game upset against the second-seeded Brampton Battalion in the second round to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the third consecutive season. St. Michael's pushed the Ottawa 67's on the brink of elimination with a 6–2 win Game 5 to take a 3–2 series lead, however Ottawa hung on for a 3–2 overtime win in Game 6, followed by a 5–2 Ottawa victory in Game 7 as the Majors were eliminated in the Conference Finals for the third-straight season.\nIn Cameron's fourth season with the club in 2003–04, the Majors had the best record in the Eastern Conference for the second time in three seasons, going 38–21–7–2, registering 85 points. St. Michael's survived a scare from the eighth-seeded Sudbury Wolves, winning in seven games. The Majors comfortably defeated the Brampton Battalion in five games in the second round to reach the Eastern Conference Finals for the fourth-straight year, facing the Mississauga IceDogs. The IceDogs eliminated St. Michael's in six games.\nBinghamton Senators (2004–2007).\nAfter four successful seasons with the Majors, Cameron became head coach of the AHL's Binghamton Senators. The Senators saw a 26-point improvement in Cameron's first season with the team, finishing in first place in the East Division with a 47–21–7–5 record (106 points). In the first round of the 2005 Calder Cup playoffs, the Senators were upset by the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins in six games.\nWith many Binghamton players promoted to the NHL's Ottawa Senators for the 2005–06 season following the end of the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the club struggled and finished with a 35–37–4–4 record, missing the playoffs by finishing in fifth place in the East Division, seven points behind the Bridgeport Sound Tigers.\nBinghamton's struggles continued in 2006–07, finishing with the worst record in the AHL at 23–48–4–5 (55 points), well out of a playoff position. It also stood as the worst record in franchise history, with fans in Binghamton regularly chanting for Cameron's firing during home games throughout the season.\nMississauga St. Michael's Majors (2007–2011).\nAfter a three-year stint with Binghamton, Cameron returned to the Majors organization, which during the summer of 2007 had relocated from Toronto to Mississauga to become the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors. In his first season, 2007–08, the Majors saw a 20-point improvement, as they went 31–32–2–3 (67 points) to finish in fifth place in the Eastern Conference. In the opening round of the playoffs, the Majors were swept in four games by the Niagara IceDogs.\nMississauga continued to improve in 2008–09, as they improved by 14 points with a 39–26–1–2 record (81 points) and a fourth-place finish in the Eastern Conference. The Majors defeated the Barrie Colts in five games in the first round but were eliminated in six games in the second round by the Brampton Battalion.\nThe Majors saw their point total increase again in 2009–10, as the club had a record of 42–20–4–2 (90 points) to finish in third place in the Eastern Conference. Mississauga swept the Peterborough Petes in four games in the opening round, then eliminated the Ottawa 67's in seven games in the second round. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Majors were eliminated in five games by the Barrie Colts.\nIn 2010–11, the Majors were named hosts of the 2011 Memorial Cup. St. Michael's recorded an OHL-best record of 53–13–0–2 record (108 points) to win the Hamilton Spectator Trophy. In the playoffs, the Majors swept the Belleville Bulls in the first round (allowing just one goal against), swept the Sudbury Wolves in the second round, then eliminated the Niagara IceDogs in the Eastern Conference Finals in five games to win the Bobby Orr Trophy as Eastern Conference champions. In the J. Ross Robertson Cup final against the Owen Sound Attack, the Attack won the series through an overtime goal in Game 7.\nIn the 2011 Memorial Cup, St. Michael's finished 2–1 in the round-robin to advance to the semi-finals. In the semi-final game, the Majors defeated the Western Hockey League's Kootenay Ice 3–1 to advance to the final game against the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League's Saint John Sea Dogs. The Sea Dogs won the game 3–1 to win the Memorial Cup.\nOttawa Senators (2011–2016).\nIn 2011, Cameron and Mark Reeds joined the staff of Paul MacLean with the Ottawa Senators as assistant coaches. Cameron became the Senators' head coach in December 2014 after former general manager (GM) Bryan Murray announced MacLean's firing on 8 December, making Cameron the fifth head coach of the team since June 2007. With a strong performance by rookie goaltender Andrew Hammond and forward Mark Stone, the Senators would win 23 of their final 31 games of the regular season, allowing the Senators to qualify for the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Senators would lose in the first round to the Montreal Canadiens in six games.\nCameron remained as head coach of the Senators for the 2015–16 season. However, the Senators would finish the season eight points out of a wild card spot to miss the 2016 playoffs. On March 22, 2016, Senators owner Eugene Melnyk expressed his disappointment with the team, including Cameron's decision to have backup goaltender Matt O'Connor start the first home game against Montreal, which Ottawa lost. On April 10, 2016, Murray announced that he was resigning as GM and that assistant GM Pierre Dorion would be replacing him. Two days later, Cameron was fired, along with assistant coaches André Tourigny and Rick Wamsley; assistant coach Jason Smith was offered another role in the organization. Cameron finished with a record of 70–50–17 with the Senators.\nCalgary Flames (2016–2018).\nOn July 6, 2016, Cameron was hired by the Calgary Flames to be an assistant coach on Glen Gulutzan's staff. Cameron was fired on April 17, 2018, when Gulutzan was fired.\nVienna Capitals (2018–2021).\nIn May 2018, Cameron became the head coach of Vienna Capitals of the Austrian Erste Bank Eishockey Liga.

        "title": "Queensland rugby league team",
        "text": "The Queensland rugby league team represents the Australian state of Queensland in rugby league football. Nicknamed the \"Maroons\" after the colour of their jersey, they play three times a year against arch-rivals New South Wales in the State of Origin series. The team is currently coached by Billy Slater and captained by Daly Cherry-Evans, and is administered by the Queensland Rugby League. They play all of their home matches at Brisbane's Lang Park (known due to naming rights as Suncorp Stadium).\nSince 1908, a rugby league team representing Queensland has been assembled from players based in the state to compete annually against New South Wales. The team used to play matches against other high-profile foreign and domestic touring teams, but has not played anyone other than New South Wales in several decades. From 1980 onwards, when Queensland was first allowed to select players of local origin even if they were currently at clubs outside its borders, the team's success rate against New South Wales improved dramatically. From 1980-87, clubs from both the Brisbane Rugby League and the NSWRL provided players for the side. Since the creation of the Brisbane Broncos in 1988, Maroons players have only been selected from the NSWRL (until 1995) and its successor competition, the National Rugby League, with the sole exception of Game III 2001 when Allan Langer was selected from the Super League. As of 2023, the Maroons have won fourteen out of the past eighteen series, including the most recent series and a record-breaking eight successive State of Origin victories between 2006 and 2013.\nHistory.\nResidential era (1908–1979).\nQueensland had already been playing in their maroon jerseys each year against New South Wales in their sky blue before the split in rugby football between union and league took place. Queensland's captain, Mike Dore, left the rugby union establishment to play the new Northern Union brand of football in 1907 and his decision to switch codes influenced many other Queensland union players including his brother, to join the rugby league ranks. The first Queensland rugby league team ever formed, like the first New South Wales and Australian teams ever formed, was for playing the ground-breaking 1907–08 New Zealand rugby tourists, and was as follows:\n1. Roy Allingham, 2. Doug McLean, 3. George Watson, 4. Arthur O'Brien, 5. William Evans, 6. William Abrahams, 7. Mick Dore8. Jack Horan, 9. Robert Tubman, 10. William Hardcastle, 11. Vic Anderson, 12. Ernest Cartmill, 13. Jack Fihelly\nStill some months away from having its own competition, when Queensland first played rugby league against New South Wales in the opening match of the 1908 interstate series they lost 43–0. This set the precedent for much of interstate rugby league's early history in Australia. During the 1912 New Zealand rugby league tour of Australia, Queensland lost both its matches against the Kiwis in Brisbane. Again, Queensland played two matches against the Kiwis during the 1913 New Zealand rugby league tour of Australia and again the Maroons lost both.\nNew South Wales had won every match between the two states until 1922, when the Maroons, with Cyril Connell playing at , achieved their maiden victory. This commenced Queensland's only golden period before the introduction of State of Origin. In 1925 Queensland toured New Zealand and played against the full New Zealand side. The Queensland side was invited to tour ahead of the New South Wales side because Queensland was the more dominant of the two during this period.\nDuring the 1951 French rugby league tour of Australia and New Zealand Queensland played one match against the successful France national rugby league team, a 19-all draw. During the 1953 American All Stars tour of Australia and New Zealand Queensland hosted a match at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, winning 39–39 before a crowd of 24,397.\nAs the twentieth century progressed, New South Wales proved to be the dominant team. Queensland did not win an interstate series against New South Wales until 1958. The powerful New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership attracted many Queenslanders south of the border, and the \"residential\" selection policy meant that the Maroons would often be disadvantaged against New South Wales teams containing many Queenslanders playing in the New South Wales club competition.\nIn the 1970s Queensland only won four matches, and it was decided that if New South Wales won the first two games of the 1980 series that there would be a \"State of Origin\" selection policy for the last game. This meant that selection would be based on the state a player made his senior debut in, not the state that he currently played in. Queensland's first truly representative team won the first State of Origin match 20–10 on 8 July 1980. After Queensland lost the first two games in 1981 the third match was again a State of Origin match. Queensland also won this game, and all subsequent series have been played under State of Origin selection criteria.\nQueensland's overall record in interstate clashes between 1908 and 1981 (non-State of Origin matches) was 54 wins, 8 draws and 159 losses in 221 games. Between 1908 and 1979 Queensland also played matches against a number of touring Test teams.\nState of Origin era (1980–present).\nIn the inaugural State of Origin match in 1980, Queensland surprised all in a commanding 20–10 win over New South Wales. Arthur Beetson and Chris Close were the stars for Queensland, but Kerry Boustead scored Queensland's first ever try. This saw the new State of Origin rules applied a fairer game, saw it again in 1981. In 1981, legendary captain Arthur Beetson was ready to play before injury ruled him out, so he became coach of the team, and would remain so for the next three years. It seemed that State of Origin might still be dominated by New South Wales with the Blues ahead 15–0, but a remarkable comeback by Queensland saw them defeat New South Wales 22–15 with young captain Wally Lewis and Chris Close the stars of the comeback win. This match gave rugby league officials the impetus to decide that 1982 should have 2 State of Origin matches and a decider if required.\nIn 1982, for the first time all three matches of the interstate series were played using 'origin' selection rules. New South Wales won their first State of Origin match in Game One, but this was not enough to stop Queensland winning the second and third games with Mal Meninga, Rod Morris and captain Wally Lewis the heroes for Queensland of the series. The next year New South Wales won the second game, but Queensland dominated the first and the decider winning the series with Wally Lewis being the saviour for Queensland.\nAt the end of the 1983 seasons in Qld and NSW, the Queensland team also toured Papua New Guinea and England. Their tour of Great Britain saw them play three matches. The first against Hull Kingston Rovers resulted in an 8–6 loss, though the Wally Lewis led Maroons then easily won their remaining matches against Wigan (40–2) and Leeds (58–2).\nIn 1984, Queensland won the first two games for the series, dominating the series, with Kerry Boustead and Wally Lewis the stars of the series, New South Wales won the final match.\nIn 1985, Queensland saw their first ever series loss to New South Wales. New South Wales were dominant through the series. Queensland's poor performance could be seen as Arthur Beetson retiring as coach or New South Wales halfback Steve Mortimer in good form. Queensland lost the first two matches but won the third match. Under new coach, Wayne Bennett, the 1986 series saw Queensland play a lot better but the scoreboard did not show it. Queensland lost all 3 games, only by small margins for each game, but the fact was New South Wales had whitewashed Queensland.\nIn 1987, looking for redemption, Queensland lost the first game to New South Wales, but managed to win the last two games giving Wayne Bennett his first series win. Allan Langer's debut in the 1987 series saw Queensland win their first series since 1984, Langer went on to play 34 games for Queensland. In the exhibition match fourth game of 1987 in the US, Queensland could not manage to win. The Maroons also toured New Zealand in 1987.\nIn 1988, the introduction of Queensland-based clubs for the first grade competition Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast, saw more wealth of talent for Queensland. In 1988 and 1989 it was Allan Langer and Wally Lewis's formidable halves partnership that had them dominate both series winning all 6 matches and not letting New South Wales win. Wayne Bennett won the 1988 series while returning coach Arthur Beetson won the 1989 series. As a result, in 1989 a record-breaking twelve Queenslanders were selected to tour with the Australian national team.\nIn 1990, the New South Wales team managed to win their first game since 1987, and going on to defeat the Queensland team 2–1 in the series, giving Queensland coach Arthur Beetson his first ever series loss with the team. In 1991, it was Queensland legend Wally Lewis, now known as the King, last series. With a new coach, Graham Lowe, Queensland won the first game, before New South Wales won the second. With Lewis's last game, the decider, the Queensland team managed to win the game by two points and give Lewis the perfect sendoff.\nFor the series 1992 to 1994 it seemed that Wally Lewis was sorely missed, losing a record three series in a row. With veteran Mal Meninga taking over as captain, Lowe continuing as coach, the Queensland team were unable to show any spark against New South Wales. They were able to win a game in each of the series in 1992, 1993, and 1994. The King Wally Lewis took over coaching for the Queensland team in 1993 and 1994, the QRL hoping he would revive some spark to the team.\nIn 1995, the Queensland team was noticeably hampered being unable to select players from the Super League teams, most notably the Brisbane Broncos. With new coach and former Queensland captain Paul Vautin, the Queensland team were apparently going to be belted by the New South Wales team. It was not to be. In one of the biggest upsets in Origin history, the baby Queensland team defied all betting odds and whitewashed the New South Wales team 3–0. In 1996, New South Wales got their revenge and whitewashed the Queensland team. In 1997, during the Super League War and the rival Super League Tri-series with another Queensland, New South Wales and New Zealand representative teams. Queensland were unable to win the series ending Vautin's reign as coach.\nIn 1998, Queensland re-employed Wayne Bennett as coach of the team who only wanted a one-year stint at the team. With the Super League War over, Queensland was able to pick a great side again. Allan Langer returned in style in a man of the match appearance guiding the Queensland team to a close 24–23 win in the first game. New South Wales won the second, but Queensland dominated the third and won. With new coach and former Queensland player Mark Murray at the helm the Queensland team won the first before losing the second. In controversial circumstances, Queensland were locked up at 6 all at half-time, scored with 8 minutes to go making it 10–6 seemingly wrapping up the game, but New South Wales scored and missed the conversion to finish the game 10-all, making it the first drawn game and series in State of Origin history. Queensland won the series by retaining the drawn shield. 2000 was a forgettable series, captain Gorden Tallis was sent from the field for dissent to referee Bill Harrigan in a 20–16 loss in Game One. Queensland lost Game Two 28–10 before suffering their worst ever State of Origin defeat 56–16 in Game Three to cap a 3–0 wipewish of the series.\nIn 2001, Wayne Bennett again took over after their humiliating 3–0 loss in 2000. Queensland won the first game decisively however injuries saw them lose the second game and those injuries were still there for Game Three. This saw coach Bennett take a huge risk, bringing out of retirement Allan Langer to make a miraculous comeback. Although some thought Langer couldn't rise to the challenge, the great halfback inspired Queensland to a win in the final game 40–14. In 2002, Langer again returned however Queensland were thumped in Game One 32–4. Queensland won Game Two 26–18 in spite of a horror debut by winger Justin Hodges who gifted New South Wales two tries via ingoal mistakes. The third game proved to be Langers final game, but a miraculous last minute try by back rower Dane Carlaw saw Queensland draw level with New South Wales 18-all. The game could have been won by Queensland if Lote Tuquri had converted the Carlaw try, but the conversion was wide thus resulting in the second drawn series in Origin history with Queensland retaining the shield.\nThe 2003 series, marked a period of New South Wales dominance at Origin. New South Wales won a hard-fought first game 25–12 before disposing of Queensland 27–4 in Game Two. The Queensland team took their anger out by flogging New South Wales in the dead rubber third game 36–6. Queensland however could not stop New South Wales taking the 2004 series 2–1 even with new coach Michael Hagan, when Brad Fittler came out of representative retirement for New South Wales to help them defeat Queensland. Game One was notable for being the first State of Origin game to go into Golden Point extra time, with Shaun Timmins kicking the winning field goal for New South Wales to win 9–8. Queensland won Game Two 22–18 on the back of an incredible try to winger Billy Slater the game in which Fitter returned. New South Wales wouldn't be denied in Game Three, winning 36–14 on the back of an inspirational performance by Fittler.\nThe 2005 series again was not much better for Queensland in spite of a Game One win in Golden Point extra time due to an intercept try to Matthew Bowen off a wayward Brett Kimmorley pass. Queensland however failed to dominate the series losing the final two matches to lose again to New South Wales after halfback Andrew Johns made a memorable return for the final two games. Queensland's 2005 series loss marked their third straight series defeat to New South Wales.\nAs part of the 25 year celebrations in 2005, Queensland named 25 legends for each year before that. The players below are the people who have changed the game forever and will continue to change it even if they are not playing.\nIn 2006, former Queensland great Mal Meninga took the helm of coach and he took a big risk in Game One to have 7 debutantes against a formidable New South Wales side. This showed in the opening 30 minutes where mistakes were made and New South Wales dominated on the scoreboard. A comeback in the second half wasn't enough to win, New South Wales getting home 17–16 on the back of a field goal in the final moments by halfback and last minute Blues replacement Brett Finch. This put coach Meninga and captain Darren Lockyer under intense criticism by New South Wales media. The second game however saw the fired up Queensland team defeat New South Wales easily 30–6. In the third and deciding game, Queensland found themselves down 14–4 with 9 minutes to go after some controversial refereeing decisions. However a miraculous comeback started by Johnathan Thurston and Brent Tate and an intercept try by Lockyer saw them steal the win and the series.\nIn 2007, Queensland were the bookies' favourites for the first time in a long time. Queensland were down 18–6 at half time but came back with 19 unanswered points to win the first game by a score of 25–18. Queensland went on to win the second game 10–6 and win the series. This was Queensland's first win in 12 attempts at Telstra Stadium.\nIn 2008, Queensland played without Darren Lockyer for the whole series and it showed in the first game in Sydney with Queensland losing 18–10. However, the return match in Brisbane saw Queensland return to form winning 30–0, equalling Queensland's biggest ever victory. The final game was again played at Telstra Stadium, with Queensland being down 10–8 at half time before coming back to win the game 16–10 leaving New South Wales pointless for the second half and on the wrong end of 3 successive series defeats.\nThe mid-season test against the Kiwis in 2009 saw a record-equalling ten Queensland representatives, including an all maroon backline and front row.\nIn 2009, the Maroons became the first side to win four consecutive Origin series and were named sporting team of the year at the Queensland Sports Awards in December.In 2010, the Maroons had their 5th consecutive series win becoming the first team to ever do so, whilst also winning the games in a 3–0 clean sweep, the first time Queensland had accomplished this since 1995. Billy Slater was named Man of the Series.\nIn 2011, the Maroons had their 6th consecutive series win becoming the only team to ever do so. Also winning game III 34–24 and the series 2–1 in front of a record home crowd at Suncorp Stadium. This was also their captain Darren Lockyer's final State of Origin game. Cameron Smith was named both Man of the Match and Series.\nIn 2012, Queensland won game III 21–20 by a field goal in front of a mostly Maroon crowd at Suncorp stadium, making 7 series wins in a row. The final score was attributed partly to the retirement of Petero Civoniceva. Johnathon Thurston was named Man of the Match and Nate Myles was awarded Man of the Series.\nIn 2013, Queensland took the series again, for the 8th time in succession, after winning the 3rd game at ANZ Stadium in Sydney 12–10. Brent Tate was awarded Man of the Match.\nIn 2014, Queensland were defeated in an upset at their home stadium in game 1 of the series, and subsequently lost the 2nd game in Sydney, ending their 8-year winning streak.\nIn 2015, Queensland reclaimed the State of Origin series, with victories in Game I and Game III, at ANZ Stadium and Suncorp Stadium respectively. Game III of the series set a number of State of Origin records, including most goals in a game by a team (9 goals), biggest winning margin (46 points) and highest ever attendance at Suncorp (52,500), with Cameron Smith making his 36th appearance for Queensland in the same match, drawing level with Darren Lockyer for the record of most appearances for Queensland.\nOn 2 December 2015, Meninga resigned as Queensland head coach and was appointed head coach of the Australian national rugby league team, succeeding Tim Sheens. Meninga ended his 10-year reign as State of Origin's most successful coach.\nOn 28 December 2015, Kevin Walters was appointed head coach until the end of 2018. Walters, a 20-time Queensland representative and five-time premiership winner with the Brisbane Broncos, served as assistant coach to Meninga during four Origin series wins and coached the Queensland Under 20s side in 2012 and 2014.\nIn 2016, Cameron Smith broke Queensland's record for most appearances, and captained the Maroons to win Games I and II. Queensland's hopes of their first series whitewash since 2010 were dashed when they lost to NSW in Game III. Corey Parker retired following the match.\n2017 would be Johnathan Thurston's last series playing for the Maroons. However, he was injured in a game for the North Queensland Cowboys and was unable to play Game I. Queensland suffered their largest defeat in over 10 years when they lost to NSW 28–4. Thurston returned for Game II and kicked the winning conversion to level the series. However, he was injured again and ruled out for Game III. In his farewell match, which he watched from the coach's box, Queensland defeated NSW 22–6 to win their third straight series and their eleventh from twelve.\nFollowing the end of the 2017 series, coach Kevin Walters had his coaching contract extended for two years.\nFor the 2018 series, coach Kevin Walters selected Greg Inglis, at the time the top try-scorer in the State of Origin series, as the captain. Significant changes were made to the Queensland team for 2018 following the retirement of key players Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston and Cooper Cronk and the absence of Matthew Scott and Darius Boyd. Queensland then lost to NSW in both 2018 and 2019.\nColours and badge.\nThe primary colour of the QLD Maroons is Maroon, which represents the state colour of Queensland. The secondary colour is Gold, with an additional contrasting colour of white. The Maroons badge was created and used since the club's founding in 1908. It features a football set centrally in a stylised Q representing Queensland. Other badges have been used such as a stylised Q with a Kangaroo next to it.\nPlayers.\nWhile the Queensland rugby league team's players mostly come from Queensland, up until 1980 when residential selection criteria were still used, some of New South Wales' most prominent footballers, such as Dally Messenger and Clive Churchill, also played for the Maroons. Queensland's players are some of the most famous athletes Australia produces, with goal-kicking centre Mal Meninga being named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1990, the first rugby league player to ever do so. Since the turn of the century Maroons players have become big name footballers not only in rugby league but in other codes as well. Rugby union's 2003 World Cup Final alone featured four former Queensland players: Brad Thorn playing for the All Blacks, and Mat Rogers, Lote Tuqiri and Wendell Sailor playing for the Wallabies. Former Maroons Karmichael Hunt and Israel Folau were both recruited by the AFL to play Australian rules football (and both also currently play professional rugby union).\nCurrent squad.\nThe Official Queensland Maroons Playing Squad.\nTeam of the Century (1908–2007).\nIn 2008, the centenary year of rugby league in Australia, the Queensland Rugby League named their best ever 17, selected from all players from 1908 to 2007.\n (c)\nAll-Time Team (1980–2020).\nFollowing Queensland's victory in the 2020 series as State of Origin celebrated its 40th anniversary, Origin legends including Wally Lewis, Paul Vautin, Darren Lockyer and Johnathan Thurston along with New South Wales' Peter Sterling and Andrew Johns selected Queensland's best 17 over the 40 years of State of Origin.\n (Player-coach)\n (c)\nCaptains.\nA list of captains for the Maroons since the beginning of the State of Origin era.\nEmerging Origin squad.\nEach January, from 2001 to 2019, a squad of 14–15 players on the cusp of Queensland selection, took part in the Emerging Origin program held at the Queensland Academy of Sport in Brisbane. The program, run by Wayne Bennett and the current Queensland coaching staff, indoctrinated players on Queensland's Origin culture and values and included player training and meetings with dietitians and sports psychologists. From the inaugural Emerging Origin squad in 2001, 12 of the players went on to play for Queensland in State of Origin. Since 2001, 66 players who have participated in the Emerging Origin program have represented Queensland in State of Origin.\nIn 2000, after Queensland's embarrassing series defeat to New South Wales, Bennett returned to coach the Maroons and established the Emerging Origin program in conjunction with the QAS. Before re-taking the job, Bennett phoned then-Queensland Minister for Sport Terry Mackenroth, requesting that if he retake the job, the program receive the support of the government, which Mackenroth agreed to.\nOn 20 December 2019, the Queensland Rugby League announced a 33-man Maroons squad, which included current representatives and uncapped players, to take part in a two-day camp, moving away from the traditional Emerging Origin concept.\nCoaches.\nQueensland has had a total of eight different coaches at State of Origin level, all of whom have played for the Maroons previously except for New Zealand's Graham Lowe, the only non-Australian to coach in State of Origin. The list also includes the known coaches from the pre-Origin era and only counts games against NSW. Games against touring teams from New Zealand and Great Britain or Queensland's three game tour of England in 1983 are not counted. Win percentages are listed to the nearest two decimal places.\nWally Lewis / Ron McAuliffe Medal.\nFrom 1992 to 2003, this award was the \"Wally Lewis Medal\", however after 2003 this medal was dedicated to the player of the series from both Queensland and New South Wales, and thus the award for the Queensland Player of the Series was awarded with the Ron McAuliffe Medal.\nRecords.\nThe most-capped Queensland State of Origin player is Cameron Smith, with 42 caps. The player with the most tries for Queensland in State of Origin history is Greg Inglis, with 18 tries. The player with the most points is Johnathan Thurston, with 220 points."

        "title": "Tanzania national cricket team",
        "text": "The Tanzania national cricket team is the men's team that represents Tanzania in international cricket. Cricket has been played in what is now Tanzania since 1890, and the national side first played in 1951. The Tanzania Cricket Association became an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2001, having previously been part of the East and Central Africa Cricket Conference, which was a member of the ICC in its own right.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Tanzania and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have had the T20I status.\nHistory.\nBeginnings of cricket in Tanzania.\nCricket was first played in what is now Tanzania on the island of Zanzibar by the British Navy as recreation for the officers and crew. Cricket spread to Tanganyika after the British took over the League of Nations mandate in 1919.\nCricket began to be concentrated mostly on the coast and on Zanzibar, with particular development in Dar-es-Salaam. The Indian population quickly took up the game and by the 1930s formed the majority of the players, with a significant European minority.\nNational side.\nEarly matches.\nDistance between Tanganyika and other countries in the African Great Lakes meant that the first international was not played until 1951, when Tanganyika lost by an innings to Kenya. Occasional matches against Kenya and Uganda continued throughout the 1950s and Zanzibar also played matches against Uganda, beginning in 1956.\nOther opponents from further afield also toured, with Tanganyika playing the MCC in 1957 and 1963, a South African Non-Europeans side in 1958 (who also played Zanzibar) and Pakistan International Airlines in 1964. The occasional matches against Kenya and Uganda eventually led to a formal triangular tournament being introduced in 1967, later to become a quadrangular tournament with the addition of Zambia.\nDecline.\nAs many businesses were nationalised in the early 1970s, much of the Indian and British population began to leave the country. Cricketers, including John Solanky, who went on to play for Glamorgan, were amongst those who left the country, and standards went into decline.\nSince the 1970s, the Tanzania Cricket Association has concentrated on developing the game amongst the African communities, and the national side now contains between 20 and 25% African players. The national side returned to form in the mid-1990s, when they were runners-up in two Africa-wide tournaments in 1994 and 1995, though there was again a slight decline in the late 1990s.\nICC membership.\nThe Tanzania Cricket Association became an associate member of the ICC in 2001 (Tanzania had previously played international cricket as part of the combined East Africa and East and Central Africa teams) opening up new opportunities for Tanzanian cricket. The first matches for the national side as an ICC member were in the 2002 Africa Cup where they lost all four of their matches.\nThey showed improvement by the Africa Cricket Association Championship in 2004, where they still finished last, but did beat Zambia in the final match of the tournament, which was a qualifying event for the 2005 ICC Trophy. Even more improvement was shown in the equivalent tournament two years later, when they won Division Two of the World Cricket League Africa Region. This result qualified Tanzania for Division Three of the World Cricket League in Darwin in 2007. Tanzania finished sixth in that tournament after losing to Hong Kong in a play-off, which relegated them to Division Four.\nIn 2008, Tanzania hosted Division Four of the World Cricket League. In this tournament they finished fourth, which meant that they remained in Division Four for the next tournament in 2010, played in Italy, where they came 4th again, thus remaining for 2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Four.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Tanzania\n\"Last updated 20 March 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Tanzania\nMost T20I wickets for Tanzania\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2531.

They brought the sport along with them when Cuba ceased to be a Spanish Colony. The heyday of baseball in Spain was in the 1950s and 1960s.\nOwing to mass-interest in football many baseball clubs didn't survive into the 1970s. The Spanish public's massive shift in focus was largely triggered by the introduction of multiple TV channels that focused mainly on broadcasting the football matches of La Liga, the professional First Division Spanish League. One of the few survivors was the CB Viladecans, whose field was officially used during the 1992 Summer Olympics.\nStructure.\nThe Spanish baseball league is divided into divisions. The top teams play in the \"División de Honor\". In each division, a team plays all other teams twice, once at home and once away, and two matches in the same day, during the regular season. There are no playoffs. The top four teams at the end of the season play in the Copa del Rey.

        "title": "1991 Women's Rugby World Cup",
        "text": "The 1991 Women's Rugby World Cup was the first Women's Rugby World Cup. The tournament was not approved by the International Rugby Board (IRB), yet it still went ahead despite the disapproval of the sports governing body. France confirmed their participation only minutes before the draw was made on 26 February. Representatives of the IRB, WRFU and RFU attended the final, but it was not until 2009 that the IRB officially endorsed the event as a \"world cup\" when it published, for the first time, a list of previous winners in a press release.\nThe tournament was held in and around Cardiff, Wales. Twelve teams competed for the trophy, divided into four pools of three teams each. Each team played three pool matches on 6 April, 8 April, and 10 April, and the semifinals were on 12 April and 14 April, respectively. This meant that the championship teams played five matches over nine days, with only one day rest between matches.\nThe tournament champions were the United States who defeated England 19–6 in the final at Cardiff Arms Park before almost 3,000 fans. The teams that failed to qualify for the semi-finals took part in a \"plate\" tournament between the 11 and 13 April.\nOrganisation.\nThe tournament was created and largely organised by four women who were with the Richmond Women's Rugby Club – Deborah Griffin, Sue Dorrington, Alice Cooper, and Mary Forsyth.\nThe International Rugby Board decided not to sanction or support the tournament. The tournament was run on a very small and tightly controlled budget. The organisers considered a number of host cities, and chose Cardiff, Wales for several reasons — because most of the teams were European it made sense to hold the tournament in Europe; the organisers were looking for a strong rugby community, which Wales possessed; and Cardiff offered help, including paying for the welcome ceremony and closing dinner.\nThe tournament made a financial loss. Due in some part to the fact that the men's 1991 Rugby World Cup was also being held in Europe that year, with some matches staged in Wales, the women's tournament experienced disappointing attendance revenues and the failure to attract television contracts or sponsorship. Another financial drain was due to the Soviet Union team being unable to pay its hotel and transport bills, as Soviets were not permitted to leave the country with hard currency. The team had hoped to survive by bartering and selling goods such as vodka and trinkets such as Russian dolls; these activities were curtailed after they aroused the attention of HM Customs and Excise, and the Soviets relied on contributions by local Cardiff businesses to survive.\nThe financial loss was made good. Anonymous businessmen pledged at the post-tournament celebratory dinner to make up a portion of the deficit. The English Rugby Football Union made good on the remainder of the deficit.\nTeams.\nThe organizers invited multiple rugby unions to participate, and 12 nations confirmed their participation. The teams had varying degrees of international experience. Among the more experienced teams were the Netherlands with 20 caps and France with 18 caps, dating back to their first meeting in 1982. Among the lesser experienced teams were Japan with no prior caps, and Spain with 1 prior cap from a 1989 0–28 drubbing by the French.\nCup.\nThird place playoff.\nOfficially, third place was shared between France and New Zealand.\nHowever, a match between a French and a New Zealand XV did take place on 14 April, France winning 3–0. But it is clear from records held by the RFU Rugby Museum that game was not scheduled as part of the tournament and is not included in any official tournament records after the event.\nParticipants record that New Zealand fielded a weakened team based around players who had not made many appearances in the tournament. New Zealand awarded no caps – indeed the game does not appear in any official Black Fern records. On the other hand, the French RFU have included the game in a recently published official list of internationals, and do appear to have awarded caps.\nAs status of the game is disputed it is also not currently accepted as being a test match."

        "text": "Roy Franklin Simmons (November 8, 1956 – February 20, 2014) was an American football player who played as a guard in the National Football League (NFL) with the New York Giants and the Washington Redskins. With the Redskins he played in Super Bowl XVIII. He became the second former NFL player to come out as gay and the first to disclose that he was HIV-positive.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Savannah, Georgia, Simmons had five siblings from multiple fathers. As a child, he was sexually assaulted by a male acquaintance, and he later said that he was severely affected by the trauma of that event. At Alfred E. Beach High School in Savannah, he became a highly recruited football star before committing to play at Georgia Tech. At Georgia Tech, he acquired the nickname \"Sugarbear\" due to his fun-loving personality. Though Simmons developed a habit of getting intoxicated and visiting bathhouses near the Georgia Tech campus, his college friends did not suspect that he was gay.\nProfessional football career.\nAfter his career at Georgia Tech, he became an eighth-round draft pick of the New York Giants in 1979. After signing with the team, Simmons moved his three younger brothers to New Jersey to live with him. Later, his mother and other family members moved in. Simmons was a regular on the offensive line in his rookie season, and by 1980 he started all 16 games as the left guard.\nSimmons later said that he fell into problems with substance abuse during his time in the NFL. He felt that he had to keep his sexuality a secret, writing, \"The N.F.L. has a reputation, and it’s not even a verbal thing — it's just known. You are gladiators; you are male; you kick butt.\" Simmons lost his position as a starter in 1981 and he left the Giants before the 1982 season, citing mental fatigue. After briefly working as an airport baggage handler and failing to make the Giants roster in a 1983 comeback, he was signed by the Redskins. He appeared in the 1984 Super Bowl.\nSimmons appeared briefly in the United States Football League, but his professional career was over by 1985. In 1989, one of Simmons' young cousins had revealed to a girlfriend of Simmons that the former player had male lovers. Embarrassed, Simmons moved to San Francisco and disengaged from his family. He became immersed in the city's drug culture, was injured in a knife fight and became homeless at one point.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1992, he announced that he was gay on \"The Phil Donahue Show\". Around 1997, he learned that he was HIV-positive. In 2006, three days before the Super Bowl, Simmons requested a media credential and two tickets to the game. The NFL denied his request, saying that it had received too many similar requests to accommodate all of them. Simmons and attorney Gloria Allred wrote to the NFL and requested an investigation into whether his request had been denied due to his sexuality or his HIV status. His autobiography, \"Out of Bounds\", was published that year.\nAccording to Simmons' brother Gary, the former NFL player lived alone and spent several stints in drug treatment after his playing career. Simmons was a born-again Christian, and a Christian Broadcasting Network video profile intimated that Simmons came to see homosexuality as immoral, but Simmons' brother said that Simmons was always proud to identify as a gay black man. Simmons died February 20, 2014, in his Bronx, New York apartment at the age of 57. In 2015, he was inducted into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame.\nIn an interview in 2019, former NBA player Al Harrington revealed that Simmons was his cousin, and that as a child his goal was to grow up and play for the New York Giants just like his older cousin Roy."

        "title": "2000 World Series",
        "text": "The 2000 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2000 season. The 96th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between crosstown opponents, the two-time defending World Series champions and American League (AL) champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion New York Mets. The Yankees defeated the Mets, four games to one, to win their third consecutive championship and 26th overall. The series was often referred to as the \"Subway Series\", referring to the longstanding matchup between New York baseball teams; it was the first World Series contested between two New York teams since the 1956 World Series and the first since the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers moved west to California (as the current San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers, respectively) in 1958 and the subsequent formation of the Mets in 1962. This World Series that featured teams from the same city or state, was the first of its kind since 1989 between the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants. Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.\nThe Yankees advanced to the World Series by defeating the Oakland Athletics, three games to two, in the AL Division Series, and then the Seattle Mariners, four games to two, in the AL Championship Series; it was the third consecutive season the Yankees had reached the World Series, the fourth time in the past five years, and the 37th overall, making it the most of any team in MLB. The Mets advanced to the World Series by defeating the San Francisco Giants, three games to one, in the NL Division Series, and then the St. Louis Cardinals, four games to one, in the NL Championship Series; it was the team's fourth World Series appearance, making it the most of any expansion franchise in MLB and the Mets' first appearance since winning the 1986 World Series.\nThe Yankees were the first team in baseball to win three consecutive championships since the 1972–1974 Oakland Athletics, and the second North American professional sports team in five years to accomplish the feat after the 1996–1998 Chicago Bulls. As of 2023, this remains the last World Series with a repeat champion.\nBackground.\nNew York Yankees.\nAlthough the Yankees were in the midst of a dynasty and not far removed from their dominant 114-win 1998 season, the 2000 season was their weakest performance since 1995. They won just 87 games in the regular season and lost 15 of their last 18.\nNonetheless, strong seasons by Jorge Posada, Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams, and Mariano Rivera were enough to secure the AL East by 2.5 games and the third seed in the American League. In the postseason, they defeated the #2 seed Oakland Athletics in the AL Division Series 3–2 and the fourth-seeded Seattle Mariners in the AL Championship Series 4–2 to reach the World Series. At the time, they were just the fourth team since 1960 to make the World Series after winning fewer than 90 games in the regular season.\nNew York Mets.\nHighlighted by MVP-caliber seasons from Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza as well as strong pitching performances from Al Leiter and Mike Hampton, the New York Mets won 94 games in the regular season. While it wasn't enough to win the NL East from their rival in the Atlanta Braves (who had 95 wins), the Mets won the Wild Card spot by eight games. By winning the 1999 and 2000 Wild Card, the Mets achieved their first back-to-back post-season appearances in franchise history, a feat they would match in their 2015 pennant season and 2016.\nThe fourth-seeded Mets defeated the overall #1 seed San Francisco Giants in the NL Division Series, 3–1, and the second-seeded St. Louis Cardinals, 4–1, in the NL Championship Series. The 2000 World Series was the first World Series appearance for the Mets since their championship in and their second post-season appearance since .\nThis series marked the second year in a row that a World Series matchup would be a repeat from the regular season. The Yankees had beaten the Mets 4–2 in six games from June 9–10 and July 7–9 (including a double header on July 8). This was also the very first time a World Series champion would beat the World Series loser in both the regular season and the World Series.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe American national anthem was sung by Billy Joel. The opener fell on two anniversaries. Twenty-five years prior, Boston Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk ended Game 6 of the 1975 World Series with his famous home run off the left-field foul pole at Fenway Park to beat the Cincinnati Reds and force a Game 7. Twenty years prior, the Philadelphia Phillies won their first World Series title, defeating the Kansas City Royals in six games.\nGame 1 was a match-up between postseason veterans Al Leiter and Andy Pettitte. Pettitte had been with the Yankees for each of their previous three World Series appearances to this point, while Leiter had won world championship as a member of the 1992 and 1993 Toronto Blue Jays teams and the 1997 Florida Marlins.\nThe two teams engaged in a scoreless tie with neither squad threatening much. Then in the sixth, with two outs and rookie Timo Perez in scoring position, Mets first baseman Todd Zeile hit a deep fly to left field. Perez misjudged the ball, thinking it was going to clear the fence, but it hit the top of the wall and bounced back into the field of play. Since it had not gone into the stands, the ball was still live and Yankees left fielder David Justice was able to relay the ball back to the infield just as Perez, who had been running at a trotting speed, was rounding third base. The relay from Derek Jeter to Jorge Posada easily beat Perez to the plate, and instead of scoring the first run of the game the Mets ended the sixth with nothing. Justice then responded in the bottom half of the inning with a double that scored Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch to give the Yankees a 2–0 lead.\nIn the top of the seventh inning, the Mets loaded the bases against Pettitte with one out on two singles and a walk before Bubba Trammell tied the game with a two-run single to left. After Timo Perez's sacrifice bunt moved up the runners, Jeff Nelson relieved Pettitte and allowed an RBI single to Edgardo Alfonzo to put the Mets on top. John Franco relieved Leiter in the eighth and held the Yankees in check, while Mariano Rivera staved off a rally in the top of the ninth to keep the score at 3–2.\nLooking to secure the victory, the Mets called upon their closer, Armando Benítez, to finish the game. Benítez had had some trouble against the Yankees in the past, having faced them often as a member of the Baltimore Orioles, and this time would prove no different. After retiring the first batter he faced, Benitez walked Paul O'Neill. Pinch hitter Luis Polonia followed with a single, as did Jose Vizcaino, loading the bases. Knoblauch then drove in O'Neill with a sacrifice fly to tie the game. Benitez recovered to strike out Jeter for the last out, ensuring the game would require extra innings to decide.\nRivera retired the Mets in order in the tenth, and the Yankees got another chance to win the game when Justice and Bernie Williams drew walks against Dennis Cook to lead off the bottom half. Glendon Rusch then came in and threw a wild first pitch, which enabled the baserunners to advance into scoring position. Rusch then got Tino Martinez to pop out, and after walking Posada he managed to escape further damage by inducing an inning ending double play from O'Neill.\nMike Stanton, the Yankees' left-handed relief specialist, entered the game in the eleventh and set the Mets down in order again. Rusch took the mound again for the Mets and retired Luis Sojo to lead off the inning. He walked Vizcaino, then got Knoblauch to pop out. Jeter drew a walk, but ball four got away from Todd Pratt and the runners advanced to second and third. Rusch then left in favor of Turk Wendell, who retired pinch hitter Glenallen Hill on a fly ball to keep the game going.\nAfter Stanton once again retired the side in order in the twelfth, Wendell came out to try and keep the Yankees from scoring. With one out, back to back hits by Martinez and Posada put both men in scoring position and brought O'Neill to the plate. Wendell put him on intentionally, then got Sojo to pop out to Pratt for the second out. This time, he would not get out of the inning as Vizcaino lined a single into left field to drive in Martinez to give the Yankees a 4–3 win.\nGame 2.\nThe American national anthem was sung by Robert Merrill. Roger Clemens started for the Yankees. Earlier in the year, during Interleague play, Clemens had hit Mets catcher Mike Piazza in the head with a fastball that resulted in a concussion and Piazza going on the disabled list. Early in Game 2, during Piazza's first time up, a Clemens pitch shattered Piazza's bat. The ball went foul, but a sharp edge of the bat came towards Clemens. He came off the mound and threw the bat towards the baseline, almost hitting the running Piazza. Piazza appeared baffled by Clemens' actions, but both benches cleared as a physical altercation nearly ensued. After the game, Clemens would say he did not see Piazza running and threw the bat because he was pumped up with nervous energy and initially charged the incoming broken bat, believing it to be the ball.\nThe Yankees struck in the bottom of the first when Mets starter Mike Hampton walked two with two outs before RBI singles by Tino Martinez and Jorge Posada put them up 2–0. Scott Brosius's leadoff home run next inning made it 3–0. Martinez doubled in the fifth and, after an intentional walk, scored on Paul O'Neill's single. In the seventh, reliever Glendon Rusch allowed a one-out single to Posada and subsequent double to O'Neill. Rick White relieved Rusch and allowed a sacrifice fly to Brosius. In the eighth, Derek Jeter doubled with one out off of White, who was relieved by Dennis Cook and allowed an RBI single to Martinez. Clemens pitched eight shutout innings, allowing just two hits (both singles by Todd Zeile) while striking out nine. In the ninth, Jeff Nelson relieved Clemens and allowed a leadoff single to Edgardo Alfonzo before Piazza homered to make it 6–2. After Robin Ventura singled, Mariano Rivera relieved Nelson. He retired Zeile, allowed a single to Benny Agbayani and then, after Lenny Harris hit into a force-out at home, Jay Payton's three-run home run cut the Yankee lead to 6–5. Rivera struck out Kurt Abbott looking to end the game, and give the Yankees a 2–0 series lead heading to Shea Stadium.\nThe Yankees' Game 2 win tied the longest AL winning streak in the World Series at ten games (the AL had previously won ten straight 1927–29 and again 1937–40).\nGame 3.\nThe American national anthem was sung by NSYNC. In Game 3, Robin Ventura's leadoff home run in the second off of Orlando Hernandez gave the Mets a 1–0 lead, but the Yankees tied it in the third when Derek Jeter singled with two outs off of Rick Reed and scored on David Justice's double. Next inning, Tino Martinez hit a leadoff single and scored on Paul O'Neill's one-out triple, but the Mets tied the game in the sixth when Mike Piazza hit a leadoff double and after a walk, scored on Todd Zeile's double. In the eighth, Zeile singled with one out and scored on Benny Agbayani's double. After Jay Payton singled, Mike Stanton relieved Hernandez and allowed a sacrifice fly to Bubba Trammell to pad the Mets lead. Closer Armando Benitez pitched a scoreless ninth despite allowing a leadoff single to Chuck Knoblauch as the Mets' 4–2 win ended the Yankees' fourteen-game winning streak in World Series play dating back to the 1996 World Series.\nYankee hurler Orlando \"El Duque\" Hernandez earned the loss, snapping his previous undefeated postseason record of 6–0.\nGame 4.\nThe American national anthem was sung by Sheryl Crow. Before Game 4, some analysts felt the tide had changed, that the Mets (down 2–1 in the Series) were now geared with enough momentum to make a comeback. That momentum lasted only until the first pitch from Mets starter Bobby Jones, which Jeter hit far into Shea Stadium's left-field bleachers. It was the 16th leadoff homer in World Series history, also extending a 13-game hitting streak in the World Series for Jeter. The Yankees added to their lead when Paul O'Neill tripled with one out in the second and after an intentional walk, scored on Scott Brosius's sacrifice fly. In the third, Jeter hit a leadoff triple and scored on Luis Sojo's groundout. Mike Piazza's two-run home run off of Denny Neagle cut the Yankees' lead to 3–2, but neither team would score after that. Jose Canseco made his only Yankees playoff appearance in the 6th inning, pinch-hitting for David Cone and striking out. The Yankees secured a dominant 3–1 lead in the Series, with elite pitchers Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens poised for Games 5 and 6 (if necessary). With this win, the Yankees had effectively killed all hope for the Mets.\nA now-iconic moment in Yankees lore, footage of Jeter's leadoff home run, currently serves as the background for the title screen of YES Network's \"Yankeeography\" series.\nGame 5.\nThe American national anthem was sung by Marc Anthony. Looking to clinch, the Yankees scored first on a Bernie Williams home run in the second inning. In the bottom half, however, with runners on second and third and two outs, Andy Pettitte's fielding error on Al Leiter's bunt attempt allowed the Mets to tie the score. Benny Agbayani's RBI single then put them up 2–1. In the top of the sixth inning, Derek Jeter homered to tie the game at 2–2.\nThe Series effectively ended in the top of the ninth. Mets ace Al Leiter had a pitch count that was approaching 140, but manager Bobby Valentine insisted that he would live or die with Leiter. After striking out Tino Martinez and Paul O'Neill, Leiter walked Jorge Posada and allowed a single to Scott Brosius. Yankees infielder Luis Sojo then singled to center, and the throw from center fielder Jay Payton hit Posada as he was sliding into home plate. The ball went into the Yankees' dugout. Bottom of the 9th inning, Mets' slugger Mike Piazza hit a fly ball off Mariano Rivera with two outs and a runner on third. Many thought the ball was a home run. Yankees manager Joe Torre said of the last at-bat:\nIt was probably the most scared I've been when Mike hit that ball ... I screamed, \"No!\" Because any time he hits a ball in the air, it's a home run in my mind. I saw Bernie trotting over for that. I said, \"Wow! I guess I misread that one.\"\nYankees catcher Jorge Posada similarly said, years later: \nI remember it was a loud sound ... It was a pitch that got too much of the plate. It was supposed to be inside. I remember the swing, I remember Mo's reaction. And then I looked at the ball and I see Bernie running after it, and then he stopped. And I'm like, O.K., we're good. \nHowever, Bernie Williams, after the game, with champagne pouring over him, said, \"I knew right away ... I knew he didn't hit it.\" Likewise, Mariano Rivera in his last season (2013) was asked if he thought Piazza had hit a home run and answered, \"No ... He didn't hit it with the sweet spot.\"\nGame 5 was the final World Series game at Shea Stadium (, , and 2000). This would also be the only time that visiting teams won a World Series at Shea Stadium (the Mets lost in 1973 in Oakland). This World Series provided some measure of revenge for Roger Clemens. He won the World Series in the same stadium he lost it at in 1986 while with the Yankees' fierce rival, the Boston Red Sox. Incidentally, members of the 1986 Mets World Series team threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the game.\nComposite box.\n2000 World Series (4–1): New York Yankees (A.L.) over New York Mets (N.L.)\nThe winning margin of three runs was the second-lowest for a five-game series; the 1915 margin was two runs, and five runs in 1933, 1942, and 1974.\nAftermath.\n2000 would be the last World Series title the Yankees would win for nine years, though they would remain competitive each year. They lost the 2001 World Series to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a classic seven game series, and the 2003 World Series to the Florida Marlins in six games.\nThe 2000 World Series was the last hurrah for this Mets core that consisted of Piazza, Leiter (left 2004), Franco (left 2004), Alfonzo (left 2002), Ventura (left 2001), and manager Bobby Valentine (left 2002). After four consecutive seasons of competitive baseball, the Mets would average just 74 wins in the next four seasons, including a 95-loss season in 2003 and two last-place finishes in the NL East (2002 and 2003). After 2002, Bobby Valentine and nearly all of the coaching staff were fired, and by 2005, Mike Piazza was the only remnant from the 2000 team; he would leave the Mets after that season.\nThe Mets have made four postseason appearances since then. The first occurred in 2006, when they lost the NLCS to the eventual champions, the St. Louis Cardinals; the second came in 2015, as NL East champions, when they made a return trip to the World Series and lost to the Kansas City Royals (also in five games); the third took place in 2016 when they lost to the San Francisco Giants in the National League Wild Card game; the team's most recent postseason appearance was in 2022, when they clinched a spot in the newly expanded postseason's National League Wild Card series, only to lose to the San Diego Padres in three games.\nWith the New Jersey Devils winning the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals the previous spring, the New York metropolitan area was home to a World Series and Stanley Cup champion in the same season or calendar year, a distinction it previously earned in 1928 and 1939–40 when the Yankees and New York Rangers won the World Series and Stanley Cup respectively. New York missed out on a championship trifecta, however, when the NFL Giants lost Super Bowl XXXV to the Baltimore Ravens.\nThis was the final World Series the New York Yankees won while playing at the old Yankee Stadium (as previously mentioned, they lost in and again in ) and the final World Series played at Shea Stadium. Both stadiums closed at the end of the 2008 Major League Baseball season. The first season at the new Yankee Stadium () ended with the Yankees winning their 27th; meanwhile, the New York Mets hosted their first-ever World Series at Citi Field, where they lost to the Kansas City Royals in five games.\nDerek Jeter was the last active player involved in the 2000 World Series. He retired following the 2014 season. Some players, like Robin Ventura and Joe McEwing, currently work as coaches.\nBeginning with this World Series, the official logo would be revised annually (effective with the 2001 series) as opposed to previous World Series where the same logo would be recycled for several seasons. As of 2021, Major League Baseball is the only one of the \"Big Four\" leagues to change its championship tournament logos annually; the Super Bowl in the National Football League (since 2010), the Stanley Cup Finals in the National Hockey League, and the NBA Finals in the National Basketball Association continue to use standardized logos with the year (or in the case of the Super Bowl, Roman numerals) updated annually. This also applies to the official logos used for the Wild Card Round (starting in 2012), Division Series and League Championship Series.\nOn October 11, 2005, A&amp;E Home Video released \"The New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996–2001)\" DVD set. Game 5 of the 2000 World Series is included in the set. The entire series was released in October 2013 by Lionsgate Home Entertainment\nRadio and television.\nThe World Series telecast on Fox was the first year of their exclusive coverage of the Fall Classic (although the new contract would technically begin the next year). As in previous World Series televised by the network, Joe Buck called the play-by-play with Tim McCarver (himself a Yankees broadcaster and a former Mets broadcaster) and Bob Brenly served as color commentators. Game 5 of the series was Brenly's last broadcast for Fox, as he left to become manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks and, incidentally, go on to defeat the Yankees in the World Series the following year. Brenly returned to broadcasting in 2005 as part of the Chicago Cubs broadcasts on CSN Chicago and WGN, and also has called postseason games for TBS. In 2012, Brenly returned to the Diamondbacks as a broadcaster.\nESPN Radio's coverage was without Joe Morgan for a second consecutive year for reasons that remain unclear. Instead, Jon Miller shared the booth with Dave Campbell, ESPN Radio's \"Sunday Night Baseball\" color man. In 1999, Morgan was absent from ESPN Radio's World Series coverage because he was working the television broadcasts with Bob Costas on NBC. During Game 3, Miller was forced to leave the booth after the top of the first inning due to an upper respiratory infection. Charley Steiner, serving as a field reporter for the network, filled in on play-by-play for the rest of the game; Miller resumed his duties in Game 4 of the Series.\nJohn Sterling and Michael Kay also broadcast this on WABC and on WFAN, Bob Murphy and Gary Cohen broadcast this series.\nRatings.\nThe World Series drew an average of 12.4 national rating and a 21% share of the audience, down 22.5% from the previous year. The Series drew well in the New York metropolitan area, but nationally, it was, at the time, the lowest-rated World Series in history by a solid margin. Many contemporary analysts argued that the ratings slide was due to lack of interest outside of the New York City area. Others thought the ratings slide was related to the television viewing audience becoming more fragmented in the wake of cable television. Online streaming media services were in their infancy and were a non-factor in 2000.\nThree of the next four World Series (2001, 2003 and 2004) were all rated higher than the 2000 World Series. Following the Boston Red Sox' 86-year championship drought ending with a victory in the 2004 World Series, the event has seen a decline in ratings; every World Series from 2005 to 2013 has drawn lower ratings (sometimes substantially lower) than the 2000 Series."

        "title": "Variations of basketball",
        "text": "Variations of basketball are games or activities based on, or similar in origin to, the game of basketball, in which the player utilizes common basketball skills. Some are essentially identical to basketball, with only minor rules changes, while others are more distant and arguably not simple variations but distinct games. Other variations include children's games, contests or activities intended to help the player practice or reinforce skills, which may or may not have a competitive aspect. Most of the variations are played in informal settings, without the presence of referees or other officials and sometimes without strict adherence to official game rules.\nBasketball variations.\nMain basketball variations include:\nOther variations include:\nDifferent roster sizes\nA competitive game of basketball can be played with as few as the team of 2-on-2, 3-on-3, 4-on-4, or 5-on-5.\nEach team's roster is typically the same size, but an odd number of players may force one team to play with one less player. Sometimes the odd player will be designated as a \"switch\" player, so that the offensive team always has the extra player. Roster sizes above five players per team are uncommon, even in informal games, as the court generally becomes too crowded to allow movement and space to develop between players.\nMore distantly related games.\nSpin-offs from basketball that are now separate sports include:\nRingball.\nRingball is a traditional South African sport that stems from basketball and has been played since 1907. The sport is now promoted in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, India, and Mauritius to establish Ringball as an international sport.\nKorfball.\nKorfball started in the Netherlands and is now played worldwide. Korfball (Dutch: Korfbal) is a mixed gender team ball game, similar to mixed netball and basketball.\nNetball.\nNetball is a limited-contact team sport in which two teams of seven try to score points against one another by placing a ball through a high hoop. Netball was formerly called \"women's basketball\" but now includes men's teams as well.\nSlamball.\nSlamball is full-contact basketball, with trampolines. Points are scored by playing the ball through the net, as in basketball, though the point-scoring rules are modified. The main differences from the parent sport is the court; below the padded basketball rim and backboard are four trampolines set into the floor which serve to propel players to great heights for slam dunks. The rules also permit some physical contact between the members of the four-player teams.\nOther basketball variations.\nH-O-R-S-E.\nThe game of H-O-R-S-E is played by two or more players. The order of turns is established before the game starts. The player whose turn is first is given \"control\", which means they must attempt to make a basket in a particular way of their choosing, explaining to the other players beforehand what the requirements of the shot are. If that player is successful, every other player must attempt that same shot according to its requirements. If a player fails to duplicate the shot, they acquire a letter, starting with H and moving rightward through the word \"Horse\". After all players have made an attempt, control moves to the next player, and the game continues on in this fashion. If a player who has control misses their shot, there is no letter penalty and control moves to the next player. Whenever any player has all of the letters, they are eliminated from the game. The last player in the game is declared the winner.\nIf the players want a shorter or longer game, they can change the length of the word that dictates how many missed shots are needed to get eliminated. Other variations include a requirement that the shot that dictates what other players must make can involve saying something, or making some particular movement. In other versions a player gets a second try on their final shot before getting eliminated from the game, often called “Farmer’s Chance”.\nThe NBA All-Star Weekend H–O–R–S–E Competition is a contest where players from the National Basketball Association play the game against each other.\nAirball.\nThis game can be played by as many players as needed. The first shooting line is the foul line.\nEach player has an order for when it is their turn to shoot. The first shooter takes their shot from the foul line. If they miss the ring and backboard or Airball on the shot, then they are eliminated, and this is applied to any shot by any player during the game.\nIf they miss the shot but hit either the ring or backboard then the next player in line must retrieve the ball after it has bounced once but before it bounces twice, then take the shot from wherever they retrieved the ball. If the ball bounces twice, the player is eliminated.\nIf the shot is made, then the shooter must retrieve the ball before it bounces twice, they then take another shot, if they make 3 shots in a row, then they are able to eliminate another player by hitting them with the ball. The remaining players are able to run away from the shooter but must stop and remain frozen, when the shooter has retrieved the ball after the 3 shot and yelled \"STOP\". The shooter must then take 7 steps and throw the ball from wherever they have reached. Any player who is touched by the ball is then eliminated. The game is then restarted from the Free Throw line from the next player in line. The game is continued until there is only one player not eliminated. Last player standing is the winner.\nSome special techniques used are to start running away from the ring once a shooter has made two shots to ensure that if a 3rd is made, it is more difficult to hit them with the ball. The shooter can negate this by purposefully missing the 3rd shot in the hope the next shooter is too far away to retrieve it. Another technique is to throw the ball very hard at the ring to enable a difficult return for the next shooter.\nFives.\nThis game is played by 2 or more players. The shooting line is typically the top of the key, but can be moved to the foul line for younger players. Before the game starts, select an order of play. All players (except the one shooting) should remain behind the shooting line, out of the line of play.\nThe first player shoots from the shooting line. If the shot is missed, the player must retrieve the rebound, and shoot from the spot that the rebound was retrieved. The other players are not permitted to interfere with either the ball or the player. The player continues to shoot until a basket is made to a maximum of 5 shots. When the first player has made the shot, the next player begins shooting, again from the shooting line. This player must make the basket in the same number, or fewer shots than the preceding shooter. The next player then shoots, again from the shooting line and must make the basket in the same number, or fewer shots than the player that immediately preceded him\\her in shooting.\nIf a player takes more shots than the player that immediately preceded him\\her, a point is added to that player's score. Additionally, if a player is unable to make a basket in 5 shots or less, another point is added to that player's score.\nWhen a player reaches 5 points, he\\she is eliminated from the game. When a player is eliminated from the game, the player immediately following that player has up to 5 shots on his\\her turn. The game continues until all but one player has been eliminated. The last player standing is the winner.\nIn and Out.\nIn and Out is a game that requires more than three players. One player starts the game by shooting from the free throw line. If they make two baskets in a row, they can eliminate a player of their choosing. If they miss their shot, they must try to rebound the ball, and the person closest to the ball where it lands are the two people 'in play'. Whoever gets to the ball first is the attacker and the other is the defender. If the attacker makes a basket, the defender is eliminated.\nThere are always two people that are considered 'in play'. [The other nearby players should maintain relatively still so as not to interfere] The primary player is usually the last person to shoot the ball, and the secondary player is the closest moving person to the ball. (If all players stayed frozen, whoever is closest to where the ball landed is automatically 'in play') Whoever then gets the ball is considered the primary player, aka the attacker, and the secondary player is the defender. However, during play, if another person is closer and makes a move for the ball, that person is now 'in play': Again, whoever gets the ball is the primary, and the last person that moved for the ball is now the secondary.\nIf you are eliminated, you stand off the court, at the foot of the basket, but you can still get back into the game. If a player shoots an airball, you can get back in the game if you are the one to catch it before it touches the ground. You then become the attacker and the person who made the airball shot is the defender. (For this rule, you do have to remain off the court when catching the airball so as not to be actively interfering in the game). The game is over when all but one player has been eliminated. The last player standing is the winner.\nadditional common rule:\nAround the World.\nAround the World (sometimes called Around the Key) is a basketball variant played by 2 or more players, who have all agreed upon a turn order. The game requires a sequence of shooting positions to be decided upon. The object is to be the first player to make a shot from all positions. When a player makes a successful shot from the final position, the game enters the final stage. Some play such that this player is declared the winner. Others play such that those players who have yet to act on the turn get a chance to tie, which cancels any advantage of going first.\nIn theory, the shooting positions are arbitrary; in practice, they are most commonly ordered along the 3-point line in equal intervals starting from one of the sides of the basket and including the straight-on center shot (starting from 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150°, and 180° along the 3-point line with 90° being the center). This 180-degree semi-circular path is the inspiration for the game's name. Other common positions are around the key or even under the basket.\nMaking a shot from a position allows a player to advance to the next position. The rules are very flexible but usually a player keeps advancing until a missed shot. The consequences of missing a shot may vary. Sometimes the game is played such that a missed shot requires the player to start over at the first position. Under this rule, the game may also include another rule that allows a player to \"save\" their position, and pass the ball to the next player. It is probably most common, however, to play such that each player continues until a missed shot. At this point a player may save his position or elect to take another \"chance\" shot. If the chance shot is made, the player advances as normal. If it misses, the player's turn ends and they suffer some penalty, perhaps regressing a position or even starting over.\nThere are a multitude of ways the game can be modified. Other variations include: shooting with the off arm, shooting with alternating arms, or using the backboard on every shot (except those directly to the side of the basket). This game can also be played alone as shooting training.\nKnockout.\nKnockout, sometimes called \"Lightning\", \"Bump\", \"Gotcha\", \"Bumpout\", \"Tornado\", \"Speed\", or \"Killer\" is played by two or more players and requires two basketballs. All players line up behind the selected shooting point, typically the center of the free throw line or the top of the key. The first player in line shoots. If they miss, they rebound the ball and continue shooting until they make a goal. Once the first player throws the ball for his first attempt, the second player may make his first attempt. The goal of the first player is to make a basket before the second player does. If so, the first player recovers the ball and passes it to the next player in line. The goal of the second player is to make a basket before the first player does. If so, the first player is out and play continues as the first player delivers his ball to the next player in line. This pattern follows until all players have been eliminated except one, who is declared the winner. Any new players can typically join the game at the rear of the line until the first player to become out has done so. Typically a new game starts with all players wanting at that time to play lining up at the same shooting point.\nPlayers are usually not required to dribble. In games where dribbling is required, occasional instances of traveling are allowed and double dribble is not enforced. There are no boundaries to the playing field. Some variations allow for a player to use their ball to knock the opponent's ball out of its trajectory in mid-air, but some players discourage this behavior or place limits on it. Softly shooting one's first shot, or throwing it hard against the backboard, in order to quickly recover the ball for a shorter shot is generally considered cheating.\nAdditional common rules:\nKing of the Court.\nAnother less common streetball variant, often referred to as \"King of the Court\", or \"Boston\", results in essentially a one-on-one or sometimes two-on-two tournament between any number of players. Each match is played following normal one-on-one rules, including violations (such as fouls and out-of-bounds) to just one point. The winner remains on the court and gets to take the ball out while the loser returns to the end of the line of players waiting to step on the court. The first player to win a set number of matches (usually 7 or 11) wins the game can only take one shot per turn.\nBeach basketball.\nBeach basketball may be played on concrete or on sand. It was invented in the United States by Philip Bryant in the early 1980s on the PE fields of Gulf Shores School in Gulf Shores, Alabama. The game is played on a circular court with no backboard on the goal. There are no out-of-bounds, ball movement is via the pass or 2½ steps, and there is no dribbling. Eighteen World Beach Basketball Association World Championships have been played over the years.\nGerman beach basketball uses a beach court smaller than a standard basketball court and without lines. Over the year, several tournaments are held, ending in the German championship which is organized by the German basketball federation.\nRules:"

        "text": "Edward Alvin White (born April 4, 1947) is an American former professional football player who played as a guard in the National Football League (NFL). After retiring from football, White has worked as a coach and artist.\nBiography.\nWhite grew up in Lemon Grove, California, and attended Helix High School in La Mesa as a freshman before moving to Coachella Valley. He graduated from Indio High School in Indio, California. White attended the University of California, Berkeley, playing for the California Golden Bears (1966–1968) as a lineman. He was named a consensus All-American player in 1968.\nWhite began his professional football career with the Minnesota Vikings after being drafted in the second round of the 1969 AFL/NFL draft. He is one of 11 players to have played in all four Vikings Super Bowl appearances between 1969 and 1976. Before the 1978 season, he was traded to the San Diego Chargers, with whom he played until 1985 when he retired after 17 years and 241 games. Mainly used at offensive guard, he was selected to the Pro Bowl four times. He played as an offensive lineman for the Chargers 1978-85.\nAfter retiring from the NFL, White worked as a football coach.\nAwards and honors.\nFollowing his retirement, he was inducted into College Football Hall of Fame, University of California Hall of Fame, Breitbard Hall of Fame, East-West Shrine Game Hall of Fame, and the Chargers Hall of Fame. Indio High School named their football field Ed White Stadium in his honor. As a testament to his impact on every team he played on, in 2015 Ed White was selected to the Pac-12 All Century Football team, playing defensive tackle at Cal.\nCharger quarterback Dan Fouts has been vocal about endorsing White for the Pro Football Hall of Fame: “When he retired, nobody had played in more games (241) as an offensive lineman than Ed White. They don’t have many statistics for offensive linemen other than Pro Bowls and Super Bowls, but Ed would be a leader. He was one of the most feared offensive linemen in the game.

        "title": "St. Louis Stars (baseball)",
        "text": "The St. Louis Stars, originally the St. Louis Giants, were a Negro league baseball team that competed independently from as early as 1906 to 1919, and then joined the Negro National League (NNL) for the duration of their existence. After the 1921 season, the Giants were sold by African-American promoter Charlie Mills to Dick Kent and Dr. Sam Sheppard, who built a new park and renamed the club the Stars. As the Stars, they eventually built one of the great dynasties in Negro league history, winning three pennants in four years from 1928 to 1931.\nSt. Louis Giants.\nIn 1906, Charles A. Mills, an African-American bank messenger and baseball fan who wanted to upgrade the team, approached Conrad Kuebler, a white man who owned a ballpark, and convinced him to invest in the team. He then persuaded the Leland Giants to visit St. Louis to play against his team. Mills discovered that the Leland Giants' star third baseman, Dick Wallace wanted a change of scenery, and persuaded him to join the St. Louis Giants as the team's playing manager. Wallace stayed with the team for most of its existence and assembled a core of veterans, including Ben Taylor, shortstop Joe Hewitt, first baseman Tullie McAdoo, catcher/outfielder Sam Bennett, pitchers Bill Drake and Bill Gatewood, and outfielders Jimmie Lyons and Charles Blackwell. Though they were a good club, winning the St. Louis City League championship in 1912 and 1913, they couldn't break the grip of the Chicago American Giants and, later, the Indianapolis ABCs on the unofficial western championship of black baseball.\nNegro National League.\nIn 1920, the Giants finished sixth in the eight-team NNL with a 25–32 record. For the next season, St. Louis acquired center fielder Oscar Charleston from Indianapolis. Led by a historic season by Charleston (the latest research shows him batting .436, with 12 home runs and a league-leading 32 stolen bases in 62 games), who was nearly matched by Blackwell (.430), and with Bill Drake contributing 16 wins, the Giants surged to second place with a 40–28 record. In October, they played a best-of-seven series with the second-place St. Louis Cardinals in Sportsman's Park, and lost four games to one, even though Cardinals' star Rogers Hornsby did not participate. That would be both the club's high point and its swan song, as Mills gave up the NNL's St. Louis franchise that winter. In 1922, most of the Giants' roster would play for the new St. Louis Stars.\nBarnstorming.\nMills organized new, independent teams using the St. Louis Giants moniker, frequently signing old Giants' players. That team toured the east coast in both 1924 and 1928. An African-American industrial league team used the name in the late 1930s (it was also known as the St. Louis Titanium Giants), counting eventual major leaguer Luke Easter among its players.\nSt. Louis Stars.\nThe Stars inherited almost the entire roster of the 1921 Giants (who had finished in second place), with the exception of Hall of Fame center fielder Oscar Charleston. Without Charleston, the Stars dropped to fourth place in 1922, though with a creditable 35–26 record. In 1923, they slipped badly, finishing with 28 wins and 44 losses, good for only sixth place. Midway through the year, they acquired several players from the Toledo Tigers when that team folded, including new manager Candy Jim Taylor. A 37-year-old third baseman, Taylor tied for the 1923 league lead with 20 home runs (19 hit while with St. Louis).\nMore importantly, over the next few years, Taylor put together one of the most impressive assemblages of talent in Negro league history, including Cool Papa Bell, whom Taylor converted from a left-handed pitcher into a brilliant defensive center fielder and leadoff man; Mule Suttles, first baseman and all-time Negro league home run king; Willie Wells, considered by many historians to be John Henry Lloyd's only serious rival as greatest shortstop in Negro league history; and Ted Trent, pitcher and wielder of one of the most effective curveballs in the league.\nChampionship years.\nIn 1924, the Stars improved to 42–34 and a fourth-place finish. The next year, they won the second-half title with a 38–12 record after only narrowly losing the first half (69–27 overall) but lost the playoff series to Bullet Rogan and the Kansas City Monarchs. When Taylor left to manage the Detroit Stars and Cleveland Elites in 1926, the Stars slumped to 49–30, good for third place overall, though Mule Suttles enjoyed a historic season at bat. According to John Holway's Complete Book of the Negro Leagues, he hit .498 and led the NNL in doubles (27), triples (21), and home runs (27, the all-time Negro league single-season record). He returned in 1927, and in 1928 the Stars took over the league, winning the first half going away, and compiling the best overall record (66–26). They defeated the Chicago American Giants, second-half winners (and Negro league world champions for two years running) in an exciting playoff series, 5 games to 4.\nThe Stars continued their winning ways in 1929, but were just edged out in both halves of the season by the Kansas City Monarchs, despite Willie Wells's 27 home runs (tying Suttles's 1926 record). The following year they took their second NNL pennant, defeating the Detroit Stars in the playoff. In 1931, the Stars were awarded the pennant when the league disintegrated partway through the season. The club folded along with the league.\nHome fields.\nThe Giants originally played at Giants Park the first month and a half of the 1922 season, and occasionally played some games in the 1920s at three nearby parks: Vandeventer Lot II, Easton Street Park, and Market Street Park.\nThe Stars played in Stars Park, located at the southeast corner of Compton and Laclede avenues (), which was the primary home baseball park of the Stars from 1922 to 1931. It was completed in mid-season 1922 as one of the few ballparks built expressly for the Negro leagues. It had a capacity of 10,000 people. The park became famous for its 269-foot left field wall, built to accommodate a trolley car barn. Despite special rules that in some seasons counted home runs hit over the car barn as ground-rule doubles, the park proved very friendly to power hitters over the years.\nHall of Fame players.\nBelow are the players for St. Louis that were later inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. After each player's name is his primary position, years played with the Giants/Stars, and year inducted into the Hall of Fame. An asterisk denotes St. Louis as his primary team.\nMLB throwback jerseys.\nThe St. Louis Cardinals have honored the Stars by wearing replica uniforms during regular-season baseball games on several occasions, including July 4, 1997 (at home vs. Pittsburgh), August 1 and 2, 1998 (at Atlanta), June 29, 2003 (at Kansas City), August 12, 2006 (at Pittsburgh), August 14, 2007 (at Washington), July 23, 2011 (at Pittsburgh), September 22, 2020 (at Kansas City), and September 9, 2022 (at Pittsburgh)."

        "title": "National Bowling League",
        "text": "The National Bowling League (NBL) is a defunct professional bowling league that existed from February 24, 1960 to July 9, 1962. The league was formed as an attempt to ride the popularity of bowling television shows, and also to challenge the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA).\nThe league was the brainchild of Leonard \"Len\" Homel, who thought up the idea in 1959, but did not gain support until an article by Don Snyder in the January 1960 issue of \"Bowlers Journal\". Unlike the PBA, bowlers in the NBL were members of teams that competed against squads from other cities, like the successful National Football League (NFL). A 135-match schedule was planned, five games a week, leading to the \"World Series of Bowling\".\nLeague setup and home arenas.\nThe NBL was officially founded on February 24–25, 1960, in Chicago. Initially, the league awarded \"charter franchises\" to Los Angeles, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Dallas, Chicago, Omaha and Raleigh, N.C., as well as \"provisional franchises\" to Fresno, Calif., Miami, New York, Cleveland and Houston. In a meeting in Dallas in May 1960, several other cities made presentations to join the league, including Detroit, San Francisco, St. Louis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Atlanta and Salt Lake City. Several other cities (including Denver, Boston, Birmingham, Tucson/Phoenix and San Diego) were awarded 30-day options on franchises, with an eye to make the NBL a sixteen-team loop.\nUltimately, when the NBL began play in the fall of 1961, it featured ten teams in two divisions:\nThe minimum salary was $6,000, with some such as Buzz Fazio making upwards of $20,000, a payday that rivaled many top PBA bowlers; the entire league payroll set at $800,000.\nFor his part, PBA secretary Ed Elias did not consider the NBL a threat to his organization:\n\"At no time has the PBA ever opposed the idea of a National Bowling League. Having struggled through our early formative days, we knew full well the many problems that could arise for any such new organization. However, we were quick to welcome the idea of additional employment for the man who makes his living bowling. The National Bowling League offered just that, and if it had succeeded as originally planned, it would have meant additional income, prestige and recognition for the bowler himself, and added recognition for the bowling industry — something we are all seeking continually.\"\nFirst draft.\nOn July 17, 1960 the NBL held its first draft, selecting Billy Welu first (Miami), and Don Carter second (Fort Worth). Later rounds selected major league baseball stars Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra, who were both bowling alley owners. On September 5, 1960 Fred Riccillii became the first player to sign. The first name player to sign was Steve Nagy. Others included Buzz Fazio, Ed Lubanski, Billy Golembiewski, Joe Joseph, and Bob Hitt. Don Carter, probably the best-known bowler in the country at the time and already sponsored by Budweiser, turned down a $1,000 per week contract, half-interest in a goat farm, and a cut of the gate.\nArenas and the lack of a TV contract.\nBowling was popular on television at the time; NBC carried \"Championship Bowling\", while other local and national programs included \"Make That Spare\", \"Bowling for Dollars\", and \"Celebrity Bowling.\" The NBL tried to place its matches on ABC, but that network also chose the PBA. (ABC televised PBA matches on the Saturday afternoon \"Pro Bowlers Tour\" from 1961–97; the program later aired on CBS and is now seen on FS1.)\nWithout a television contract, the NBL had to rely on a strong gate. Using mostly smaller arenas and converted theaters (Dallas and Detroit were the only teams that played in actual bowling alleys), the league created \"arena style bowling\", using four to six lanes with bleachers that held anywhere from 1,150 to 3,250 people; this setup is now used today in the PBA. Some had spotlighted lanes, scoreboards, semicircular-pattern seats, a press box, concessions stands, and dressing rooms. Kansas City's Midland and Omaha's Paramount were famous movie theaters that were transformed into NBL arenas.\nRules.\nThere were two ways a player could earn points for his team: by winning his individual match (worth one point) and by making \"bonus\" points. A 210 score earned one bonus point, a 220 game two points, and so on, up to ten bonus points for a perfect 300 game. Matches were divided into two halves, with five players (leadoff, pressure, pivot, cleanup and anchor) from each team pitted against each other. The first half was played on a team-rotation basis, with opposing players competing on a head-to-head basis (leadoff vs. leadoff, etc.). The second half pitted player against player, each bowler bowling one complete game before his teammate bowls.\nThe NBL also featured a wild-card substitution rule. When a bowler was faced with a difficult shot, his captain could call in a specialist to roll for him. (The most common wild-card substitution was calling in a left-hander for a right-hander when a couple of pins on the right side of the alley needed to be knocked down for a critical spare.)\nThe NBL's first match.\nThe NBL's first match was New York at Dallas on October 12, 1961. The Dallas Broncos owner was oilman J. Curtis Sanford, who had come up with the idea of football's Cotton Bowl in 1937. He poured millions into his team, building the Bronco Bowl, a 72-lane alley that was one of the largest bowling centers in the country at the time. The Broncos' home matches were located in a special section that featured six lanes and 18 rows of seats in a semicircle; there was even a seven-piece jazz band to entertain between games. Dallas won their opener 22-2, but the Broncos drew just 2,000 fans on opening night, well short of a sellout, and attendance got worse from there. (The lanes were eventually removed from the Bronco Bowl and it became a popular music venue for rock and roll acts including A-ha, Bob Dylan, U2, and Bruce Springsteen before closing in 2003.)\nOther teams also got off to less-than-promising starts. Jesse Weingart, a co-owner of the original New York team, had his franchise rights terminated in April 1961, and he threatened to sue the league. The new owners, unable to find a home on top of Grand Central Station, wound up remodeling a movie theater in distant Totowa, New Jersey, about 20 miles from Manhattan; the Gladiators home opener on October 17 drew just 600 fans. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Toros built a new facility, Jefferson Street Arena, which could hold only 1,200 fans; even on opening night, they couldn't sell it out, drawing only 950 fans in a 22-9 loss to Fresno. And when the San Antonio Cavaliers' top investor backed out, they wound up rolling all their matches on the road; their planned home (the Aztec Theatre) seated only 1,477, and was considered to be too small even for temporary use—even though the capacity was larger than any of the NBL teams would draw on average in 1961-62.\nThe NBL fails.\nThe Omaha and San Antonio franchises each folded on December 17, 1961, while Kansas City dropped out six days later. When the LA Toros gave up the ghost on January 15, 1962, the league dropped the divisional setup and declared Detroit the \"first half\" champion; the league started the \"second half\" with the remaining six teams starting January 28. Fan interest remained low; even in Detroit, who led the NBL in attendance, the Thunderbirds actually rolled a late-season match behind closed doors, rather than distribute free tickets.\nTwin Cities claimed the second-half title and faced Detroit in the best-of-five \"NBL World Series\" on May 4–6, 1962 in Allen Park, Michigan. The Thunderbirds swept the Skippers in three straight matches (winning the finale, 27-15 in front of about 1,000 spectators), and claimed the only National Bowling League title. Don Bickford of Dallas finished with the best average score at 220.45, edging out Broncos teammate J. B. Solomon at 220.30; Dallas also had the highest average team score with 217.19.\nOn May 9, 1962, acting commissioner Edward Tobolowski announced the NBL would return in 1963, later proposing a shortened 16-week season beginning in January. After suffering stiff financial losses, however, the league also wanted to eliminate player salaries and have bowlers roll for prize money (reportedly as much as $250,000) instead. NBL bowlers were unsurprisingly not fond of this idea; Ed Lubanski, captain of the champion Thunderbirds, said he believed most league players would return to the PBA even if the NBL returned. On July 9, 1962, Tobolowski officially announced the end of the NBL.\nThe book \"Let's Go Bowling!\" claimed that \"most bowlers hesitated to give up their status as part of the PBA to join (the NBL).\"\nFinal standings.\nFirst half.\nTeams marked with (*) did not finish season."

The film, presented by reporter Alan Towers, includes footage of Herbie waddling along the street, joining the family at breakfast and attacking the Randalls' terrier. Part of the film is a four-second shot of Herbie apparently skateboarding by himself on Colin's board. This image seemingly captured the public imagination, and the BBC received many requests for it to be shown again, which it frequently was.\nThe clip also appeared on other TV stations around the world, many of which also produced their own variations on the theme. There was also renewed interest in the clip in 1983 after the death of Herbie was announced and it has been repeated many times since on other TV programmes.\nAs a result of the item's popularity, the term \"skateboarding duck\" has come to signify a particular sort of quirky and essentially frivolous news story, often used to fill time at the end of a broadcast.\nThe item came to define Nationwide in the public mind, and the programme's final item was a sung eulogy to the skateboarding duck, with a surprising twist."

He is the uncle of Cronulla Sharks player Teig Wilton.\nPlaying career.\nMorris played for the Scone Thoroughbreds in his junior years. He made his NRL debut in round 17 of the 2001 NRL season for the Newcastle Knights against the Parramatta Eels at Parramatta Stadium on 22 June 2001.\nHaving won the 2001 NRL Premiership, which Morris did not feature in, the Newcastle club travelled to England to play the 2002 World Club Challenge against Super League champions, the Bradford Bulls. Morris was selected to play from the interchange bench in Newcastle's loss.\nMorris played for NSW Country in 2002 and in 2003.

        "text": "The Philippines national rugby union team, nicknamed the \"Volcanoes\", represents the Philippines in international rugby union. The Philippines have been playing in the Asia Rugby Championship since 2006 when the team was first created. In 2012 they won the Division I championship and were promoted to the top 5 for the 2013 tournament where they earned 4th place and again in the 2014 tournament. The Philippines have yet to make their debut at the Rugby World Cup.\nIn the March 19, 2012 World Rugby Rankings, Philippines, along with Mexico and Pakistan, were listed for the first time, entering with the base rating of 40 points (which positioned the three national teams in 71st place).\nThe national side is ranked 40th in the world (as of April 15, 2024).\nHistory.\nIn 1998 the Philippine Rugby Football Union (PRFU), the national governing body for rugby union in the Philippines, was formed. Rugby union in the Philippines was introduced mainly through the large number of British, Australian and New Zealand expatriates living in the country.\nThe Philippines made their first official international debut at the 5th division of the 2006 ARFU Asian Rugby Series. They won over Guam, 18 – 14, in its first match on May 20, 2006, but was later defeated by Pakistan in a match held on June 11, 2006, and failed to secure the sole slot for promotion to the next division.\nIn December 2006, the Philippines Under-19 went undefeated in the Asian Rugby Football Union (ARFU) Under-19 Second Division Tournament.\nIn 2008, the PRFU gained full membership to the international governing body, the International Rugby Board (IRB). The Philippines dominated the fourth-tier of the ARFU Asian 5 Nations Series and captured the inaugural Division 4 title. During the tournament, the Philippines demolished Brunei 101-0 and then defeated the home side Guam 20–8 to capture the division title.\nIn 2009 the Philippines won the inaugural Asian 5 Nations Division III rugby tournament at the Nomads field in Parañaque City. Defeating Iran 15-0 and Guam 25–0 in their two matches, the Philippines were then promoted to the Asian Five Nations Division II rugby tournament.\nIn 2010 the Philippines competed in the Asian 5 Nations Division II tournament and won it beating India in the final on a score of 44–12. Also in 2010 they played in ARFU Rugby 7s tournaments in Shanghai, Borneo and the Asian Games in Guangzhou.\nIn 2012 the Philippines competed in the Asian 5 Nations Division I tournament and went unbeaten in the round-robin series against Singapore, Chinese Taipei and Sri Lanka, therefore qualifying for the main division for the first time.\nThe Volcanoes suffered heavy defeats in the 2013 edition of A5N, however showed good signs with a competitive first half against Hong Kong in Manila, and a win to avoid relegations against UAE also in Manila.\nNickname and emblem.\nThe Philippines national rugby union team is nicknamed the 'Volcanoes'. The name comes from the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment that fought under the command of the United States Army. It was made up of Filipino-Americans with a few Filipino veterans which fought in World War II. The PRFU thought the situation was similar to the first Philippines national team which mainly consisted of foreign expatriates with only a few Filipinos.\nThe emblem of the team is based on the insignia of the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment. One of its features is a volcano which represents where the infantry units were located.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nSquad for 2019 Asia Rugby Championship:\nOverall record.\nTheir test match record against all nations:"

        "text": "PONY Baseball and Softball is a non-profit organization with headquarters in Washington, Pennsylvania. Started in 1951, PONY organizes youth baseball and softball leagues and tournaments, as over 500,000 players annually play PONY in over 4,000 leagues throughout the United States and over 40 countries world-wide. The televised Pony League World Series held annually in August at Washington's Lew Hays Pony Field attracts teenage teams from around the world. Membership is open to children and young adults from age 4 to 23 and the leagues are organized in two-year age brackets with \"and-under\" programs. Hundreds of PONY players have gone on to Major League Baseball careers, including Hall of Fame inductees Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripken Jr.\nOrigin of name.\nChildren at the Washington, Pennsylvania, YMCA named the organization PONY, which stood for \"Protect Our Neighborhood Youth.\" This later became \"Protect Our Nation's Youth.\"\nLevels of play.\nDistances shown are for baseball with players pitching; distances for other offerings (such as baseball with machine pitching, fast pitch softball, and slow pitch softball) may vary.\nPony League World Series.\nThe Pony League World Series is the flagship tournament of PONY Baseball and Softball. After the creation of the organization in 1951, there were already 505 teams across 106 leagues the following year. This prompted PONY to create the Pony League World Series in Washington County, Pennsylvania, which has hosted a majority of the tournaments since the inaugural edition in 1952.\nFrom 1964 through 1983, the tournament did not have a set location and sometimes took place in other states: California (1964–1965, 1978), Iowa (1979–1980), Illinois (1967, 1974–1975), Nebraska (1966), Texas (1977), and Washington (1983). In 1981, World Series Tournaments, Incorporated (WSTI) was put in charge of running the tournament, and every tournament since 1984 has been played in Washington County, although no team from Pennsylvania has won the tournament since 1955.\nThe first team from outside the United States to play in the tournament was Monterrey, Mexico, in 1959—Monterrey had won the Little League World Series in 1957 and 1958. In 1968, international slots were added to the tournament, with teams from Canada and Venezuela participating. The first participant from Puerto Rico was a team from Cataño in 1971. The first non-US champion was a team from Monterrey in 1972. A team from Japan was the first non-Americas participant, in 1986. The first non-Americas champion was a team from Seoul, South Korea, in 1988.\nThe format of the tournament has differed; for most years it has been double-elimination, while at least the first tournament was single-elimination, and the finals were a best of three at least twice during the 1970s. Most editions of the tournament have been contested with a field of eight teams, but field size has been as small as four and as large as 10:\nThe tournament is currently sponsored by Dick's Sporting Goods and the games are streamed on MLB.com, the official site of Major League Baseball. The recent finals can also be found on YouTube.\nAfter the 2020 edition was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 edition was staged with only US-based teams (including a team from Puerto Rico).\nChampions.\nSource:\n&lt;br&gt;\nNote: In cases of conflicting records, contemporary news reports have been given priority.\nControversy.\nIn the 2023 Pony Asia-Pacific Zone Championships held in Fukushima, Japan, a controversial decision was made, where the Japanese officials unilaterally revoked Taiwan (Chinese Taipei)'s Pony League World Series qualification after losing to Taiwan in the championship game. The reason for disqualification was the alleged use of unapproved bats by the Taiwanese team. However, the PONY league pre-approved the bats prior to each game with stickers. There have also never been complaints from other teams prior to the championship game. In the end, despite Taiwan gathering supports from the majority of the teams, including Hong Kong (1 team) and Mainland China (3 teams) who protested against the decision to disqualify Taiwan, the complaint was overruled by Japan, Philippines and Australia, where the two decision-making officials were from Japan and Philippines.\nThe incident attracted widespread media attention in Taiwan due to the perceived lack of transparency and fairness. The Taoyuan City Government and Taiwan's Sports Administration immediately filed an official complaint to the PONY Baseball and Softball organization headquarters, and are waiting for a reply.\nChampionship totals.\nBy U.S. state or non-U.S. country.

The venues were FM Mattsson Arena in Mora, and Ejendals Arena in Leksand. The total attendance was a significant drop off from the 325,000-plus visitors at the previous World Juniors in British Columbia, Canada.\nFor 2007, the tournament round-robin format was changed from previous years to resemble more closely the format used in the National Hockey League. Teams would receive three points for a win in regulation, while teams winning in overtime would receive two points. Teams losing in overtime would receive one point. During the round-robin portion of the tournament, a five-minute, four-on-four sudden-victory overtime would be played, while the knockout games and the gold medal game would use full-strength, ten- and twenty-minute sudden-victory overtimes, respectively. If the game remained tied after overtime, an NHL-style shootout (with three skaters instead of five, as per other international competitions) would be held.\nCanada won its third consecutive gold medal, capping an undefeated tournament with a 4–2 victory over Russia in the gold medal game.

        "title": "Southern Districts Rugby Club",
        "text": "Southern Districts Rugby Club is a rugby union club based in southern Sydney. The club currently competes in the New South Wales Rugby Union competition the Shute Shield. The club was formed by the amalgamation of the St George and Port Hacking clubs.\nHistory.\nFormed in 1989 by the amalgamation of St George and Port Hacking rugby clubs, with headquarters at Forshaw Park, Sylvania Waters, south of Sydney. The new club played in red, sky blue, white and black jumpers and fielded 6 grade teams, 3 colts' sides, and an under-19XV. Accommodation is limited at Forshaw Park to 2000 but the club has enjoyed splendid support since the amalgamation. \nSt George, founded in 1906, brought to the mix a long record of figuring prominently in 1st grade finals, but not in living memory and with only one premiership win – in 1957, when St George beat Gordon 21–3 in the Grand Final. St George showed promise of great success when it first came into the Sydney competition but was one of the clubs which suffered heavily from the decision to postpone all football for the duration of World War I. The club was forced to disband in 1915 and did not function again until 1928 when the famous Test forward Harold Judd was instrumental in reforming it. Judd coached St George 1st Grade after the 13-year break from competition and his nephew Bruce, a Waratah, helped him revive the club. \nSince winger Dan Carroll became St George's first international when he won selection in the first Wallabies for the tour of England, Wales and North America in 1908–09, 28 players from the club have won international honours, including Mick Clifford, dual international (for Australia and the All Blacks), Owen Stephens, Arthur Buchan, Alan Cameron who played 266 games for the club Eddie Stapleton 236, Terry Casey 105, Ron Graham 167 and Bruce Battishall. St George was relegated to 2nd division in 1979, but won promotion back to 1st division after only one season by beating Sydney University. \nSt George played in single-colour jumpers to save costs, playing in purple in 1928 and in orange during World War II, but when Bill Cerutti became the club coach he recommended that it adopt the red-and-white-striped jumper of the Transvaal Club. This remained the club's uniform until the move to Sylvania. At this time Randwick was playing in red-and-white jumpers, but following requests from St George they changed their colours. The myrtle green that Randwick now play in, was adopted from the destination boards of the trams that ran to Coogee. \nPort Hacking began when a group of lifesavers from Cronulla, North Cronulla and Wanda clubs tried to enter a junior league competition but were rejected because they could only muster one team. They entered the team instead, in the 1957 Whiddon Cup in the competition with Lance Turbet president, Norm Rees secretary and Allan Carruthers treasurer of what was known as the North Cronulla SLSC Rugby Club. They won the Whiddon Cup at their first attempt and the next season won the Burke Cup. \nAfter success in 2 nd division competitions over the preceding 9 seasons (the only club to win 4 grand finals), Port Hacking joined a Sydney competition expanded to 12 teams with Warringah in 1971 and won five matches in its first season. Since then Port Hacking's teething problems were overcome through the efforts of an emerging bunch of players, such as Greg Halpin and Michael Nethery, backed by the experience of Graeme MacDougall, Gary Pearse, John Lambie and John Coolican. The location of the club on the southern outskirts of Sydney gave rugby an important foothold in a fast-developing area. \nThere were grumbles from members of both clubs when they were amalgamated but these have been forgotten as the new club moved to improve facilities at Forshaw Park.\nIn recent years the club has enjoyed some of the benefits of a very successful junior development program. \nIn 2011, the Southern Districts Second Grade team won the grand final of the Colin Caird Shield, defeating Eastwood 24 points to 16.\nIn 2012, The Southern Districts First Grade team lost by one point in the Shute Shield Grand Final to Sydney University 15 points to 14. \nIn 2014, The Southern Districts First Grade team were beaten by Eastwood 33 to 13 at Concord Oval. The Southern Districts First Grade side have also finished runners-up in the minor premiership in 2016 and 2017.\nThe club currently fields four open Grade teams, three Colts teams and a women's 7's team which compete fiercely in all competitions."

Only located 25 km from the city centre, the club is close to many magnificent beaches, the Sydney Academy of Sport and Narrabeen Lake. The club currently competes in the New South Wales Rugby Union competitions, the Shute Shield and Tooheys New Cup. Warringah Rugby has one of the largest numbers of registered junior players in Australia.\nClub history.\nThe club was formed in 1963 due to a high demand of junior rugby players searching for clubs on the northern peninsula. Being one of the most rapidly developing areas in Sydney at the time this subsequently led to the establishment in the 1962/1963 season of the Warringah Junior Rugby Union.\nThe Senior Club was formed to supplement the already established Warringah Junior Rugby Union and commenced playing in the Sydney second division in 1964. Its aims were to provide rugby for juniors, colts and grade players and to eventually join the 1st Division Championship competition. In 1970 the Club won the 2nd Division 1st grade Premiership and was promoted to the 1st Division for the 1971 season.\nMore affectionately known as the Rats or Ratties, the club took on this tag after experiencing many difficult years with many humiliating defeats. The players were reminded by Doug Leslie Snr (Rats of Tobruk), that to give up in the face of adversity is never an option. The tradition of the Rats of Tobruk, of bonding together and making commitments in the true spirit of mateship should always be remembered and will prevail just in the same way as the Desert Rats of Tobruk prevailed. From that time on the Club became known as the Green Rats and their long held friendship with the ‘Rats of Tobruk Veterans Association’ and their legacy is honoured by a memorial on the hill at the southern end of ‘Rat Park’."

        "title": "History of the Indian cricket team",
        "text": "The Indian cricket team made its Test cricket debut in 1932 and has since advanced to be among the top four test teams in the (ICC rankings) in each of 2005 to 2008. The team won the ODI Cricket World Cup in 1983 and 2011. In other major International victories, Team India won the Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2002 and 2013\".\"\nCricket was introduced to the Indian subcontinent by European merchant sailors in the 18th century, and the first cricket club was established in 1792. India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord's, becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as Gavaskar, Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet.\nIndia won its first World Cup in 1983, under the captaincy of Kapil Dev. The '80s and '90s also saw the debut of Tendulkar, Ganguly, Dravid,Laxman and Kumble, considered to be among the greatest Indian players.\nGanguly's, captaincy is considered to be the turning point of Indian cricket as it saw great success and became one of the dominant side of the sport, followed by the superb captaincy of MS Dhoni under whom India won its second World Cup in 2011, the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, and Champions Trophy in 2013. Currently, Rohit Sharma is the captain of all 3 formats – Test, ODI and T20I teams.\nHistory.\nTest status (1932–1970).\nA few Indians played as members of the English cricket team while India was under British rule, including Ranjitsinhji and KS Duleepsinhji, before we start with all of the history of Indian Cricket its very important to know about the person behind this great history of Indian Cricket. Maharaja Of Patiala Sir Bhupinder Singh or Bhuppa best known for his extravagance and for being a cricketer. His cricket teams – Patiala XI is among the best of India. He was a great patron of sports. Maharaja of patiala is the man behind the golden history of Indian Cricket. He sponsored various tours of India for cricket and various tournaments using his own money. He was captain of the Indian cricket team that visited England in 1911, and played in 27 first-class cricket matches between 1915 and 1937. For the season of 1926/27, he played as a member of Marylebone Cricket Club. He donated the Ranji Trophy in honour of Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji, Jam Sahib of Nawanagar. He was selected as the captain of India on its first Test tour of England in 1932, but dropped out for reasons of health two weeks before departure and the Maharaja of Porbandar took over. \nAll this way India becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status. India made its debut as a Test-cricket-playing-nation in England in 1932 led by CK Nayudu, well before Indian independence. The team performed well, with Mohammad Nissar taking 5-93 and 1–42 in the match against England. The match was given test status despite being only 3 days in length. England, batting first, scored 258 with Nissar cleaning up the openers and tailenders. However the Indian team failed to capitalize on their bowling performance, all out for 189 with CK Nayudu the top scorer with 40 runs. England went on to score 275 and set India a target of 346, which always seemed out of the visitor's grasp. India were all out for 187 and lost by 158 runs.\nThe team's first series as an independent country was in 1948 against Australia at Brisbane. Australia were led by Sir Don Bradman while India was led by Lala Amarnath. The Australians returned home, winning the 5 Test series with the score 4–0.\nIndia's first ever Test victory came against England at Madras in 1952. India's first series victory was against Pakistan later the same year. In 1954, India drew a 5-Test series with Pakistan 0–0, the batting strength from India had come from Polly Umrigar and Vijay Manjrekar while the prime bowler was Subhash Gupte with 21 wickets in the series. India's first series against New Zealand in 1956 created a comprehensive series victory for India, winning the 5-Test series 2–0. MH Mankad was excellent in his batting, averaging 105.2 in the series while scoring 526 runs. Once again, S.M. Gupte held India's bowling together, with 34 wickets. The remainder of the 1950s did not show as good results as the start: India lost a 3-Test series to Australia (2-0), lost a 5-Test series against the West Indies (3-0),\nThe team's performances again began to improve in the 1960s, starting with their first series win over England in 1961–62. During this time, India's strong record at home started to develop, in which the team won a series against New Zealand in 1965-66 and drew series against Pakistan, Australia and England. In 1967–68, India won their first series outside the subcontinent against New Zealand.\nOne-day cricket and World Cup success (1970–1985).\nSunil Gavaskar made his debut for India in the West Indies in 1970-71 and immediately made an impact, scoring a total of 774 runs for the series and helping India to a 1–0 series win, their first ever win over the West Indies. Together with established players like Bishen Bedi, Srinivas Venkataraghavan, Erapalli Prasanna and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Gavaskar formed the nucleus of arguably India's strongest Test team up to that point in time. India's win over the West Indies was followed by home and away wins over England in 1971 and 1972–73.\nDuring the 1980s, other players like Mohammed Azharuddin, Ravi Shastri, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, Sanjay Manjrekar, Krish Srikkanth and Maninder Singh emerged. India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating West Indies in an exciting final.\nLate 20th century (1985–2000).\nIn 1985, India won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia. The Test series victory in 1986 in England remained, for nearly 19 years, the last Test series win outside subcontinent. Sunil Gavaskar became the first batsman to accumulate 10,000 runs in Test cricket, and went on to register a record 34 centuries, surpassed only recently by Sachin Tendulkar. Kapil Dev, a genuine all-rounder, became the highest wicket taker in Test cricket, surpassing Richard Hadlee to take a total of 434 wickets, a record which has since been broken by Courtney Walsh, Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan and has also been surpassed by fellow Indian Anil Kumble.\nThe emergence of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble in 1989 and 1990 was to herald an era of Indian cricket that was dominated by stars and individual brilliance. Sachin Tendulkar became arguably the best batsman in the world, along with Brian Lara of the West Indies and in 1998, Sir Donald Bradman himself remarked that Tendulkar batting style was similar to his. Mohammed Azharuddin, who captained India for most of the 1990s, proved a captain whose main strength, if not his motivational skills, was an ability to stay cool under pressure. Azharuddin's artistic batting, however, declined during the later years of his captaincy, and his best innings during this time were mostly when playing at home. The Hyderabadi stylist's career ended after 99 Tests when he was banned for life after being implicated in the match-fixing scandal. Under his captaincy, the Indian team became virtually unbeatable at home, with big wins against teams such as England, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Australia. Their performances abroad, however, left a lot to be desired.\nTowards the end of 1999, the Indian team was in flux. Although they had performed well in the 1999 World Cup, the winter was marked by a disastrous tour to Australia which exposed the Indian team's weaknesses when playing abroad, marked with a loss of form of most of the batsmen, except Tendulkar and the newly emerged VVS Laxman. After Tendulkar quit captaincy and Azharuddin was banned for match-fixing, Sourav Ganguly took over as captain, and the New Zealander John Wright became coach.\nTurn of the millennium (2000–2007).\nSourav Ganguly's captaincy heralded a new era in Indian cricket. It began in the famous series against Australia in 2001, when Steve Waugh's strong team was defeated 2–1 in a Test series after having taken a 1–0 lead at Mumbai. The series is best known for a remarkable turnaround by the Indian team in the Kolkata Test, when VVS Laxman, Rahul Dravid and Harbhajan Singh's performance took India to victory after they had followed on. This series marked a turning point in the Indian team's fortunes, and provided the team with the boost they dearly needed. This was followed by stellar performances by the team when playing abroad, with Test victories coming in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, West Indies, England, Australia, and a famous series victory against arch-rivals Pakistan in 2004. The series in England in 2002 is billed as Rahul Dravid's series, as he became the top scorer for the Indians, with centuries coming at Trent Bridge in Nottingham, Headingley in Leeds and a famous 217 at the Oval in London. This was followed by a sensational win in Australia at Adelaide in 2003, where Dravid, VVS Laxman and Ajit Agarkar scripted a come-from-behind victory after the team had conceded 556 runs in the first innings. The series win in Pakistan that followed was marked by Virender Sehwag becoming the first Indian to score a triple century in Test cricket. Along with Sehwag, players like Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif emerged, making the Indian batting order one of the strongest in the world in both forms of the game*. Their performances helped reduced India's dependence on their top guns in one-day cricket, and a 7-batsman policy contributed to India's successes in the limited-overs game, culminating in their reaching the final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup. In the bowling department, India unearthed a plethora of fast-bowling talent, with Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, and later Irfan Pathan and L Balaji leading the pack. The veteran Anil Kumble became the highest wicket-taker for India after surpassing Kapil Dev, and also passed the 500-mark in March 2006. His bowling performances abroad improved considerably, and he played a major part in India's overseas performances in England, Australia and Pakistan. Harbhajan Singh also provided him great company in the spin department, and at home the two bowling in tandem became a familiar sight.\nIn 2005, Indian cricket was again shrouded in controversy. After a somewhat slow season marked by a dip in team performance following the famous Pakistan series ended, the coaching job passed from John Wright to the Australian Greg Chappell. Saurav Ganguly, whose batting form had taken a beating in that year, was involved in a spat with Chappell over whether he should be continuing as captain to reduce pressure on him. This was followed by Ganguly being dropped from the team and Rahul Dravid taking over as captain. While Tendulkar, Sehwag and Dravid formed the mainstay of the Indian batting, the coming of age of players like Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif led to the emergence of younger stars like Suresh Raina and MS Dhoni.\nIndia's traditional strengths have always been its line-up of spin bowlers and batsmen. Currently, it has a very strong batting lineup with Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag all being selected to play for the ICC World XI in the 2005 \"SuperTest\" against Australia. In previous times, India was unique in that it was the only country to regularly field three spinners in one team, whereas one is the norm, and of the fifteen players to have taken more than 100 wickets, only four were pace bowlers from the last 20 years. However, in recent years, Indian pace bowling has improved, with the emerging talents of Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel and Sreesanth and many more playing in the national team. India, however have always struggled in the pace department with the only prominent pace bowler ever coming was Zaheer Khan.\nIndia has had a very good record against Australia and, before the 2004/05 tour, never being defeated by Australia in a Test Series in India since 1969. This was the reason for Australian captain Steve Waugh labelling India as the \"Final Frontier\". The famous 2001 Australian tour of India saw Harbhajan Singh become the first Indian to take a Test hat-trick and started a good run for the team, as India beat Australia 2–1. India also came runners up to Australia in the final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup.\nSince 2004, India had not been doing as well in One-day Internationals. The players who took India to great heights over the past ten years such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble grew older and did not maintain their form and fitness. Following the series loss to Australia, India collapsed on the final day in the Third Test in Bangalore in early 2005 against Pakistan to squander a series victory, and then lost four consecutive ODIs against Pakistan. This was exacerbated by the suspension handed to captain Ganguly for slow over-rates. Greg Chappell took over from John Wright as the new coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and replaced Kumble and V. V. S. Laxman from the ODI team with younger players. India's unconvincing ODI form continued, scraping past a West Indian team depleted by industrial action in the 2005 Indian Oil Cup and a similarly depleted Zimbabwean team only to be defeated twice in the finals by New Zealand, continuing a poor ODI finals record.\nThe tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly lead to a confidential email sent by Chappell to the BCCI being leaked, in which he condemned the leadership and performance of Ganguly. After a series of high-profile board meetings and public jousting including some players, Rahul Dravid was installed as the captain, triggering a revival in the team's fortunes. The Indians subsequently defeated Sri Lanka 6–1 in a home series. An important part about this series was the discovery of the young talent of the team, including Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Gautam Gambhir and Irfan Pathan. The team also beat the Sri Lankans in the Test series 2–0 to displace England from its position in second place in the ICC Test rankings, but India slipped back by losing the high-profile series to Pakistan. Indian team continued its good form in ODIs, beating Pakistan 4–1 in Pakistan. India achieved the world-record of winning 17 successive matches chasing the total. India convincingly won England's tour of India winning the series 5–1. After leveling the DLF Cup series 1–1 in Abu Dhabi, India travelled to West Indies where they lost the ODI series 1–4 to a weak West Indies team which was ranked 8th in the ICC ODI Ranking. The series loss again questioned the Indian team's ability to play away from the Sub-continent and the chances of the Indian team to win the 2007 Cricket World Cup.\nDravid's captaincy was cut short in the ill-fated 2007 World Cup, where India were out of the league stage following an embarrassing loss to Bangladesh. This was followed by Mahendra Singh Dhoni taking over the reins.\nUnder Dhoni, Kohli and Rohit (2007–present), Dhoni (2007-2017), Kohli (2014-2022), Rohit (2021-Present)..\nUnder MS Dhoni, India won the inaugural T20 World cup. It also began an era of India's dominance in world cricket in both tests and ODIs, culminating in a victory in the 2011 Cricket World Cup and a 4–0 whitewash of Australia in a home test series. It also saw Indian batsmen scoring the only 200s ever, first Sachin Tendulkar then Virender Sehwag and then Rohit Sharma on three occasions.\nDhoni has been widely acknowledged as the most successful Indian captain ever. However, following a drubbing in a test series down under in late 2014, he retired from tests.\nIn the 2015 World Cup, India reached the semi-finals.\nIn June 2017, India toured England for the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy where the Virat Kohli led mighty team lost to Pakistan in the final by 180 runs. Later India toured the Windies where the team won the ODI series by 3–1 but lost the T20I series. By defeating Sri Lanka by 9–0 in all three formats, India became the first team to cleansweep Sri Lanka in ODI series in their home soil.\nIn January 2018, Virat Kohli led Indian team toured South Africa where they lost the Test series by 1–2. But the Team showed some extravagant skills and defeated the mighty South African team and clinched the ODI series by 5–1 and T20I series by 2–1. By the series win, India became the second Asian country to defeat South Africa in ODI and T20I series on their home soil after Pakistan.\nIn the 2019 World Cup, India were defeated in the semi-finals by New Zealand.\nA new era began when the captaincy was passed from Virat Kohli to Rohit Sharma and coaching shifted from Ravi Shastri to Rahul Dravid. Rohit has won various trophies as a captain when Virat was rested as The Asia Cup, Nidahas Trophy and won series against Sri Lanka, New Zealand. Under Rahul Dravid's coaching men in blue whitewashed New Zealand when it was led by Rohit Sharma with 3–0 with Rohit himself scoring 48, 55, 56 in 3 matches being the highest scorer in the series.\nInternational tournaments.\nSince advancing to full Test Status and the creation of more and more international cricket tournaments, India has slowly become involved in a number of Cricketing tournament's including the Cricket World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy and Asia Cup. India's first two Cricket World Cups were largely failures, and the team failed to progress beyond the first round. But India upset the West Indies in the final of the 1983 Cricket World Cup to claim the Prudential Cricket World Cup for the first time, captained by Kapil Dev. India and the West Indies had cruised through the preliminary rounds in Group B, while England and Pakistan emerged the victors from Group A. Most considered India to be the underdogs in the group stages, and their win against West Indies was categorized as similar to Zimbabwe's win over Australia in the same World Cup. They were, in fact, quoted as having odds of 66 to 1 before the beginning of the tournament.\nIndia's performance in the remaining world cups has been considerably consistent. In the 1987 Cricket World Cup, the team advanced to the semi-finals as favourites, they did the same in 1996, both times they suffered upset defeats in the semi-finals. India was less strong in the 1999 Cricket World Cup, and did not make it past the Super Six section. However they impressed all in the 2003 Cup, only losing two games (both against reigning champions Australia) and advancing to the finals before taking a loss.\nIn the year after their World Cup victory, (1984) India continued its new-found dominance over One Day Cricket with a comprehensive win over arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. They went on to secure more victories over their Asian rivals, winning the 1984 Asia Cup with a victory over Sri Lanka in the finals. It won its third consecutive Asia Cup with a victory over Sri Lanka in 1990. It continued its strong streak in 1995, again beating Sri Lanka in the final. However, in 1997, a confident Sri Lanka riding on their first-ever World Cup victory swept past a weaker Indian side, breaking the 4-tournament winning streak."

        "title": "Rugby union in New Zealand",
        "text": "Rugby union has been played in New Zealand since 1870 and is the most popular sport in the country as well as being its national sport. \nThe men's national team, the All Blacks, is currently ranked No. 2 in the world. The country co-hosted and won the first ever Rugby World Cup in 1987, and hosted and won the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The men have won three World Cups (1987, 2011, 2015), the second most of any country after South Africa. \nNew Zealand are the current World Champions for Women's rugby union and were rugby sevens finalists for men and women.\nThe top domestic club competitions are the professional National Provincial Championship and amateur Heartland Championship, and above them the transnational Super Rugby, in which New Zealand has five out of 12 franchises.\nHistory.\nBefore Europeans arrived in New Zealand, the Māori were playing a ball game called kī-o-rahi which greatly resembled Australian Rules Football and rugby football. It has been suggested that this may have influenced New Zealand playing styles, especially amongst the indigenous population.\nVarious codes of football were played in New Zealand in the years following white settlement. Christchurch Football Club, which is now the oldest rugby club in the country, was founded in 1863. It played by its own rules for many years. Rugby football was first introduced to New Zealand in 1870 by Charles John Monro, son of the then-Speaker of the House of Representatives, David Monro. He encountered the game while studying at Christ's College Finchley, in East Finchley, London, England, and on his return introduced the game to Nelson College, who played the first rugby union match against Nelson football club on 14 May it was the 15th . A visit to Wellington by Munro later that same year resulted in an organised match between Nelson and Wellington. By the following year, the game had been formalised in Wellington, and subsequently rugby was taken up in Wanganui and Auckland in 1873 and Hamilton in 1874. In 1875, the first representative team was formed, being a combined-clubs Auckland team which toured the South. It is thought that by the mid-1870s, the game had been taken up by the majority of the colony.\nThe latter stages of the 1870s saw the emergence of a more formal structure, with Unions being formed in both Canterbury and Wellington during 1879. In 1882, the first international rugby side toured New Zealand, a New South Wales side that visited both islands during the latter part of the year. Two years later, a New Zealand team visited New South Wales, wearing blue jerseys with a golden fern. The team won all their games. In 1888, the first ever British Isles rugby team tour took place, visiting New Zealand and Australia. The visitors won all their New Zealand games except for one, losing to Auckland. During 1888-89, the New Zealand Native team became the first from a colony to visit Britain. In 1892 the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU), now known as the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU), was established, to act as the national governing body of the sport. Following the establishment of the national governing body, the first NZRFU national sanctioned tour was undertaken in 1893, when a ten-game tour of Australia was played. The team was captained by Thomas Ellison.\nIn 1902, the governor of New Zealand, the fifth Earl of Ranfurly presented a trophy shield to the Auckland side, who were undefeated in provincial competition that year. The shield became known as the Ranfurly Shield. Three years later, a 1905 New Zealand team, who became known as the \"Originals\", toured the British Isles and France winning all of their games apart from controversially losing the test against Wales. As the team swept through Britain, some of the players took note of how rugby (league) was being played in the North of England. One player, Aucklander George Smith met with Sydney entrepreneur James J. Giltinan on his way home, and discussed the opportunities of such a game. Meanwhile, New Zealander Albert Henry Baskervill had contacted the Northern Union to arrange a New Zealand tour, as he had just read about the game in the Wellington Post. The NZRFU discouraged any involvement from its players and officials, nonetheless, a team departed a travelled to Sydney first, and were there labelled the All Golds, a play on All Blacks in reference to the player payments. The team went on to tour England. They played an import role in rugby league.\nThe 1930s saw a period of skill development for rugby in New Zealand. The 1940 All Black tour of South Africa was one of the first sporting events cancelled due to the Second World War. Rugby was however played in services sport, with games being played with South African allies during the North African desert campaign, also, most domestic competitions were suspended during this time. In 1976, the first ever season of the National Provincial Championship (succeeded in 2006 by the Air New Zealand Cup and Heartland Championship) went underway. In its inaugural format, Division One was made up of seven North Island teams and four South Island. The remaining provinces contested a split second division, though South and North teams did not meet each other, instead played their respective Island clubs. There was a separate relegation system in place for each the North and South, ensuring the number of teams from each island.\nThe 1981 Springbok Tour, or \"The Tour\", went down as one of the most controversial rugby tours ever. From July to September, the Springboks toured New Zealand. Rugby fans filled the stadiums, yet equal numbers of fans protested the games outside the stadiums. Police were divided into Red and Blue riot squads for the tour, and in preparation for possible trouble, all spectators were told to assemble in sports grounds at least an hour before kickoff. At a game at Rugby Park in Hamilton, around 350 protesters pulled down a fence and invaded the pitch. Police, already very worried, pulled the match when they found out a light plane piloted by a protester was headed to fly around the stadium. A protest turned violent in Wellington the following week, escalating the situation. During the final test match at Eden Park, a low flying plane dropped flour bombs over the pitch. A subsequent 1985 All Black tour was prevented by the High Court, but an unofficial tour took place the following year.\nIn 1987, the NZRFU wrote to the International Rugby Football Board, later known as the International Rugby Board (IRB) and now as World Rugby, requesting the possibility of hosting an inaugural Rugby World Cup. The 1987 World Cup was eventually given to both New Zealand and Australia. The All Blacks made it to the final, where they would meet France. The All Blacks won and were crowned the first ever World Champions. In the 1980s, New Zealand provincial sides participated in the South Pacific Championship, along with teams from Australia and Fiji. In 1992 this type of competition was relaunched as the Super Sixes, and was expanded to the Super 10 later. As rugby entered the professional era in the mid-1990s, along with South Africa and Australia, New Zealand formed SANZAR, which would see them start a provincial rugby competition, the Super 12. The 1996 Super 12 season saw the Auckland Blues finish in second place, whilst the Waikato Chiefs 6th, the Otago Highlanders 8th, the Wellington Hurricanes 9th, and the Canterbury Crusaders 12th. The SANZAR agreement also saw the formation of the Tri Nations Series, a contest between the respective national sides, the All Blacks, Springboks and Wallabies. The All Blacks won the first series. Beginning in 2012, the Argentina Pumas entered the competition, which was renamed The Rugby Championship. New Zealand was supposed to jointly host the 2003 World Cup with Australia, but a disagreement with the IRB saw the tournament given to Australia in its entirety. In 2006, New Zealand won the right to host the 2011 World Cup.\nCulture.\nIn New Zealand there are 520 clubs, 141,726 registered players and 2,309 referees. In colonial New Zealand, rugby football served to maintain loyalty to the Crown within the emigrant population, whilst introducing British culture to the Māori population. It was the New Zealand Natives' Rugby Tour of 1888/89 showed that New Zealand could compete with other nations. Similarly, the 1905-06 tour, in which the All Blacks went very close to a clean sweep tour (with just one loss against Wales), helped to create a sense of national pride around the All Blacks, as they appeared physically superior and pulled off an admirable performance on their British tour. It is also thought that this saw the emergence of the Kiwi as a national symbol. Rugby dominates New Zealand's sports media. Being the unofficial national winter sport of New Zealand, rugby attracts large sporting attendances and viewership. As many as 5,000 people have turned out to watch All Black training sessions, while the final of 2011 Rugby World Cup was the single most watched television event in New Zealand history. There is a pay TV channel dedicated to rugby in New Zealand.\nHaka.\nThe \"haka\" is a traditional Māori challenge that has become closely associated with New Zealand rugby at an international level. There are thousands of variations of haka that are performed by various tribes and cultural groups throughout New Zealand; one of the best known is called \"Ka Mate\". The All Blacks have performed a haka before matches since the late 19th century.\nEthnicity.\nEarly forms of rugby had been played in New Zealand since the 1860s. While these were initially associated with the settler elite and the military, other colonists accustomed to hard physical labour also soon took part.\nIn 1872, 'Wirihana' became the first recorded Māori rugby player when he turned out for Wanganui 'Country' in a 20-a-side fixture against their urban counterparts. While some all-Māori clubs were formed, such as Kiri Kiri near Thames, mixed teams were more common in areas like Poverty Bay which had substantial Māori populations.\nMāori living in areas that had supported the Crown during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s seem to have been the first to take up the sport. Jack Taiaroa and Joseph Warbrick were key members of the first representative New Zealand team, which toured New South Wales in 1884.\nGovernance.\nThe New Zealand Rugby (NZR) is responsible for rugby in the country. The NZRU was formed in 1892 as the New Zealand Rugby Football Union with the original representation of seven unions though there was the original significant absence of Canterbury, Otago and Southland. The NZRFU joined the IRFB in 1949. There are 26 member unions within New Zealand. Every province also has its own union. In late 2005, New Zealand won the right to host the 2011 World Cup.\nNational teams.\nAll Blacks.\nNew Zealand, commonly referred to as the All Blacks, are the most successful team in international rugby. They have a positive winning record against all Test nations, and have a win record of over 74%. The first All Blacks Test match was played against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground on 15 August 1903. New Zealand won 22 - 3, with \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" saying, 'The present New Zealand team have shown form so far in advance of every fifteen opposed to them that it seems almost impossible for Australia to put a side into the field with any hope of victory...'.\nThe All Blacks were winners of the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 and were runners-up in 1995. The All Blacks were the only team to have reached the semi-final stage at every World Cup until the 2007 World Cup where they were defeated 20-18 by France in the quarter-finals. New Zealand won its second Rugby World Cup on home soil in 2011. In 2015 New Zealand became the first country to win back to back Rugby World Cups beating Australia 34-17 in the final played at Twickenham on 31 October. The All Blacks dominate the list of winners of the World Rugby Men's 15s Player of the Year, with ten wins and is the only nation with players winning the award multiple times, Richie McCaw (2006, 2009 and 2010), Dan Carter (2005, 2012 and 2015) and Beauden Barrett (2016 and 2017).\nJunior All Blacks.\nThe Junior All Blacks are not an age grade side, but are the second national team behind the All Blacks. They were formerly known as New Zealand A, but the name was changed for marketing purposes. They competed in the Pacific Nations Cup competition alongside Australia A, Fiji, Japan, Samoa and Tonga. They won the inaugural IRB Pacific 5 Nations competition in 2006. In 2007 Australia A joined with the competition, changing its name to Pacific Nations Cup. The Junior All Blacks repeated their 2006 success in 2007 winning the competition with victories in all five of their matches including with a 50−0 thumping of their Australian counterparts at Carisbrook Dunedin. The New Zealand Māori played in the 2008 Pacific Nations Cup. No New Zealand team has played in Pacific Nations Cup since then.\nMāori All Blacks.\nThe Māori All Blacks, previously known as New Zealand Māori, is a representative side that play at home and on tour. The Maori All Blacks team is a selection of the best of New Zealand’s Maori rugby players. All contracted players are able to nominate themselves as eligible for the Maori All Blacks and, in the event a player is considered for selection, the team’s kaumatua (cultural advisor) will trace the player’s whakapapa (genealogy) to confirm his heritage and eligibility. The primary objective of this team is to provide an aspirational pathway for young Maori rugby players. The team was formerly established in 1910, and has played many of the world's top Test teams, beating teams such as England, Ireland and the British &amp; Irish Lions.\nHeartland XV.\nPreviously known as the New Zealand Divisional XV, this team was revamped in 2006. Only players who have participated in the previous season's Heartland Championship are eligible for selection; this makes it effectively a Heartland all-star team. This team traditionally goes on second-level tours; their first tour under the Heartland name was a 2006 end-of-year tour to Argentina, where they played two provincial teams and the Argentina A side, splitting the provincial matches and losing to Argentina A.\nTheir second tour, in November 2008, was a two-match trip to the USA. The first match, in San Francisco, saw them defeat a Pacific Coast XV 39–12. They then travelled to Salt Lake City to take on a USA Select XV in one of the first events held in the new Rio Tinto Stadium, and came from behind to notch a 19–14 win.\nShortly after the tour, the NZRU announced that the Heartland XV would not be assembled in 2009, and would in the future tour every two years.\nBlack Ferns.\nThe Black Ferns are the top national women's team in New Zealand. They are the current Women's Rugby World Cup champions, being 3 time winners after they won the 1998 tournament then again in 2002 in Barcelona and again in 2006 in Canada.\nSevens.\nSevens is a form of rugby union which involves 7 players per team rather than 15 in the regular game. The games are 7 minutes per half (10 minutes in a competition final) rather than 40 minutes per half in the 15-man game. The New Zealand Sevens team compete in the World Rugby Sevens Series, the Sevens World Cup, and the Commonwealth Games Sevens. The New Zealand Sevens team were undefeated in the Sevens events in the Commonwealth Games until 2014, when South Africa defeated them in the final. Since the inception of the Sevens Series in 1999–2000, the New Zealand Sevens team have dominated the series, winning the first six seasons of the competition (2000–2005) and 12 times in all, most recently in 2014.\nUnder 21s.\nThe New Zealand Under 21s rugby union team is for players aged under 21. New Zealand Under 21 (formerly Colts) was first selected in 1955 and played annually until 2007. The Under 21s enjoyed great success on the world stage, winning world titles in 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2004.\nUnder 20s.\nNew Zealand formed an Under 20 side for the first time in 2008. The catalyst for the creation of this side was World Rugby's decision to scrap its under-19 and under-21 world championships in favour of a single under-20 tournament, originally known as the IRB Junior World Championship and now known as the World Rugby Under 20 Championship. The side won the first four editions of the competition (2008–2011), and again in 2015 and 2017.\nUnder 19s.\nThe New Zealand Under 19s rugby team is for players aged under 19. New Zealand Under 19 was selected for the first time in 1990, and played annually until 2007. They were strong contenders during their time, and won the IRB Under 19 World Championship in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2007\nSchoolboys.\nThe New Zealand Schoolboys rugby union team is for secondary school students to help them aim for and achieve higher honors. New Zealand Schoolboys team is a great team to start out in and it brings you into the international scene early on. Famous past schoolboy players include Aaron Mauger, Mils Muliaina, and Joe Rokocoko.\nUniversities.\nThe New Zealand Universities rugby team is composed of the best players from New Zealand's six university clubs. The team has played in many international fixtures including famous wins over the British and Irish Lions in their 1977 tour and the Springboks in 1956. Many former NZU players have gone on to play for the All Blacks including David Kirk, Kieran Read and Conrad Smith. Today the team takes part in a biannual tour to Japan and consists mainly of amateur club players.\nDomestic competitions.\nSuper Rugby.\nWhile not domestic, Super Rugby is an international competition featuring teams from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. The competition, governed by SANZAR, was formed in 1996 as Super 12 after the game turned professional. It became Super 14 in 2006 with the addition of one team each from Australia and South Africa, and Super Rugby in 2011 when a fifth Australian team joined. The current format includes five teams from each participating country.\nWith the expansion to 15 teams, the competition format was dramatically changed. The league phase, originally a single round-robin, was replaced by a three-conference format, with each conference consisting of teams in one of the participating countries. Each team plays home-and-away against the other teams in its conference, plus single games against four teams in each other conference. The finals series was also changed. In the Super 12 and Super 14 eras, this was a knockout series involving the top four finishers. The knockout format was retained for Super Rugby, but now involves the three conference winners plus the top three non-winners without regard to conference. Currently, five New Zealand teams participate in the competition, these being Crusaders, Blues, Hurricanes, Chiefs and Highlanders.\nThe competition was further reorganised in 2016 with a permanent sixth team from South Africa and new entries based in Argentina (Jaguares) and Japan (Sunwolves). At that time, the competition was split into Australasian and African groups (with the latter including the Argentine and Japanese teams), each in turn being divided into two conferences. All of the New Zealand teams formed one conference. The finals series expanded to eight teams, with the top team from each conference, plus the top three non-winners from the Australasian group and the top non-winner from the African group, qualifying.\nNew Zealand teams have dominated Super Rugby for much of its history, winning 12 of the 18 titles decided to date. The Crusaders are the most successful club, having won 10 titles in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The Blues, Highlanders &amp; Chiefs are the other New Zealand teams to have captured the title, the Blues having won in 1996, 1997 and 2003, the Chiefs winning in 2012 and 2013 and the Highlanders winning in 2015. Australia's Brumbies (two titles), Reds (one) and NSW Waratahs (one) and South Africa's Bulls (three) are the only teams from outside New Zealand to have won a title.\n \n \n \nBlues\nChiefs\nHurricanes\nCrusaders\nHighlanders\nBunnings NPC.\nThe Bunnings NPC, is the premier domestic competition in New Zealand rugby. It has previously been known as the Mitre 10 Cup, the ITM Cup and the Air New Zealand Cup as sponsorship deals changed IA fully professional competition contested by 14 provincial teams, it is the successor to Division One of the country's former domestic competition, the National Provincial Championship (NPC).\nThe Bunnings NPC features the following teams from the former NPC Division One:\nIt also features three teams from the former NPC Division Two:\nplus one newly formed team, the merger of the former NPC Division Two teams of Marlborough and Nelson Bays:\nBeginning in 2011, the Mitre 10 Cup split into two divisions—the top-level Premiership and second-level Championship, each with seven teams. Promotion and relegation was reintroduced to the top level of provincial rugby; the winner of the Championship replaces the bottom team of the Premiership; the winner of the Meads Cup replaces the bottom team of the Championship.\nHeartland Championship.\nThe Heartland Championship is an amateur competition contested among 12 teams from the former NPC Divisions Two and Three. It was also founded in 2006 as a result of the reorganisation of the NPC, and is directly run by the NZRU. Its teams compete for the Meads and Lochore Cups, named after famous All Blacks Colin Meads and Brian Lochore. The participating teams are:\nRanfurly Shield.\nThe Ranfurly Shield, also known as the Log o' Wood, has been competed for on a challenge basis by provincial teams since 1904. The current holders of the shield become \"defenders\" in every game played on their home ground, if the opposition or \"challenger\" defeats them, they become the new holder of the Shield. The Shield was first presented by the Governor of New Zealand, the Earl of Ranfurly. \nThe current holders are Wellington.\nClub.\nEach Bunnings NPC and Heartland Championship region conducts local intra-provincial club competitions. The club level is often followed by the local media and has local support. Clubs often rely on the Pub Charity in order to survive. In total, 520 clubs are affiliated to the NZRU.\nInternational competition.\nWorld Cup.\nThe Rugby World Cup is considered the ultimate rugby competition. The New Zealand All Blacks won the first World Cup in 1987, beating France in the final. Since then the All Blacks were favourites on several occasions, but did not win for another 24 years. New Zealand lost to Australia in the semi-final in 2003 and fell to the French team in the quarter-final of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Intense lobbying by the NZRFU and the New Zealand Government helped New Zealand secure hosting rights to the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The All Blacks regained the World Cup on home soil in 2011. They went on to be the first country in history to win the Rugby World Cup two times consecutively, as they won the 2015 competition in England.\nWomen's Rugby World Cup.\nThe Women's Rugby World Cup is considered the top rugby competition for women. The New Zealand Black Ferns first won the world cup in 1998, beating the United States in the final. Since then the Black Ferns have won in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2017. New Zealand lost to Ireland in Pool B in 2014. and didn't qualify in 1994.\nIntense lobbying by the New Zealand Government helped New Zealand secure hosting rights to the 2021 Women's Rugby World Cup by beating out neighbour Australia. It will be the first time the tournament will have been played in the southern hemisphere.\nTri Nations and The Rugby Championship.\nThe Tri Nations, now known as The Rugby Championship, is an annual competition involving the strongest rugby nations from the Southern Hemisphere. When the competition was established in 1996, it featured New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Originally, this involved each country playing one home and one away game against both other countries. From 2006 the competition was expanded with each nation playing both the other nations three times (except in Rugby World Cup years, when it reverted to a home-and-away series). The All Blacks won the first series in 1996, as well as the subsequent 1997 series. They have been the most dominant team in the series; during the Tri Nations era (1996–2011), they won 10 titles to the Springboks' three and the Wallabies' two.\nIn 2012, Argentina joined the competition, which became The Rugby Championship. With four nations now involved, the tournament returned to a straight home-and-away format except in World Cup years, when it is conducted in a single round-robin format. The All Blacks won the first three editions of the renamed competition (2012–2014), giving them a total of 13 Tri Nations and Rugby Championship titles.\nThe Freedom Cup is contested between New Zealand and South Africa, first as part of the Tri Nations and now in The Rugby Championship.\nBledisloe Cup.\nThe Bledisloe Cup reflects the rivalry between Australia and New Zealand and has been contested since the early 1930s. The Bledisloe Cup was irregularly contested between 1931 and 1981, usually during tours by the two nations. During this period, New Zealand won it 19 times and Australia four times. In 1982 it became an annual contest, being contested either as a single game or in a three-test series. Between 1982 and 1995 New Zealand won the Cup 11 times and Australia three times. Since 1996 the Bledisloe Cup has been contested as part of the Tri Nations/Rugby Championship. .\nWorld Cup Sevens.\nThe Rugby World Cup Sevens is World Rugby's equivalent to the (15-man) Rugby World Cup. It is also held every four years, and was originally scheduled in the odd-numbered years in which the 15-man RWC was not held. The competition was first held in 1993. New Zealand won in 2001, were losing finalists to Fiji in 2005, and won the most recent edition in 2013 in Moscow. The 2013 edition was originally intended to be the last because of the impending establishment of an Olympic sevens tournament in 2016. World Rugby (then known as the IRB) later decided to retain the World Cup Sevens, and established a new four-year cycle in which the World Cup would be held in even-numbered non-Olympic years. As such, the next edition was held in 2018 in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nWorld Rugby Sevens Series.\nThe World Rugby Sevens Series, held annually since 1999–2000, is a series of several international tournaments, expanding from nine to ten for the upcoming 2015–16 series, featuring full international sevens teams. New Zealand have been the dominant team throughout the series' history, winning the first six editions (2000–2005), and again in 2007, 2008, and 2010–2014. New Zealand hosts one leg, the New Zealand International Sevens, at Westpac Stadium in Wellington."

        "title": "Mike Smith (ice hockey, born 1982)",
        "text": "Mike Smith (born March 22, 1982) is a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who is an unrestricted free agent. He most recently played for the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Smith has previously played for the Dallas Stars, Tampa Bay Lightning, Phoenix/Arizona Coyotes, and the Calgary Flames. Smith is the 11th goaltender in NHL history to score a goal, which he did in the 2013–14 season against the Detroit Red Wings. A two-time NHL All-Star (2017, 2018), he was named to the 2014 Canadian Olympic Hockey Team, winning a gold medal at the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nSelected by the Dallas Stars in the 2001 NHL draft, Smith played in the American Hockey League (AHL) for the Utah Grizzlies, Houston Aeros, and the Iowa Stars. Smith also played for the Lexington Men O'War of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) in 2002–03. After playing five seasons in the minors, Smith had his NHL debut on October 21, 2006, playing for the Dallas Stars against the Arizona Coyotes putting up a 22-save shutout, making him the first goalie in Dallas Stars history to have a shutout in his first NHL game. Smith was named to the 2006–07 NHL All-Rookie Team.\nPlaying career.\nJunior hockey.\nSmith began his hockey career in 1999 playing for his hometown Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). That season, he played 15 games while backing up future NHL player Andrew Raycroft.\nAfter the start of the 2000–01 season, Smith moved to the Sudbury Wolves, where he played 43 games, registering a 2.52 goals against average (GAA) and 0.913 save percentage in the regular season. The Wolves made it to the second round of the playoffs that year with Smith in net.\nDallas Stars.\nIn the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, Smith was drafted by the Dallas Stars in the fifth round (161st overall), and continued to play in Sudbury, again taking the Wolves into the post-season. Their playoff run ended in four games, however, as the Barrie Colts won the series 4–0.\nThe subsequent season saw Smith's departure from the junior leagues when he split the season between the Lexington Men O' War of the ECHL and the Utah Grizzlies of the American Hockey League (AHL).\nSmith made his professional debut on October 26, 2002, against the Dayton Bombers, scoring a statistically unlikely goal during a shutout in his first win, scoring on an empty net at 19:04 in the third period. Smith is the youngest goaltender ever to score in a professional game, doing so at 20 years of age.\nSmith played only 11 games in Utah, backing up Jason Bacashihua and Corey Hirsch. For 2003–04, Utah added Dan Ellis to their roster, with whom Smith split back up duties, again to Bacashihua. Smith went to play for the Houston Aeros in 2004–05, sharing the net almost equally with Josh Harding, putting up a 0.915 save percentage and 2.42 GAA.\nSmith joined the Iowa Stars for their inaugural season in 2005–06. The Stars played Smith and Dan Ellis back and forth for much of the season until Smith appeared to take much of the netminding responsibilities late in the season. A Stars rally in the stretch secured the final Western Conference playoff spot. Smith started in every game of the seven-game series against the Milwaukee Admirals, which Milwaukee ultimately won.\nSmith underwent shoulder surgery during the off-season for an injury he sustained during Iowa's 2005–06 season. After a faster-than-expected recovery, Smith attended the Dallas Stars' training camp in the fall of 2006, and was awarded the backup goaltender position behind Marty Turco. In his first-ever regulation NHL game on October 21, 2006, Smith stopped 22 shots to post a shutout against the Phoenix Coyotes.\nOn January 4, 2007, Smith was hit in the mask by a slap shot, causing him to miss a few weeks with a concussion. He came back strong, however, winning two games in which Turco was pulled. He then registered a 32-save shutout over the Anaheim Ducks on February 10.\nSmith also started the year living with Marty Turco's family. However, he eventually moved out and then signed a two-year, $950,000 per year contract with the Stars.\nOn June 14, 2007, Smith was named to the 2006–07 NHL All-Rookie Team.\nTampa Bay Lightning.\nOn February 26, 2008, Smith was traded, along with Jussi Jokinen, Jeff Halpern and a fourth round draft pick in 2009, to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for Brad Richards and Johan Holmqvist. Smith made his Lightning debut the following night against the Minnesota Wild, stopping 24 of 27 shots in a 3–2 loss.\nOn March 15, Smith recorded a 3–0 shutout victory over the New York Rangers. He became only the third rookie goaltender in NHL history to record a shutout for two different teams in the same season, and the first to do so in 79 years. Smith recorded 14 wins for the Lightning during the 2008–09 season before suffering a concussion that kept him out of action for the remainder of the season. On February 2, 2011, the Lightning placed Smith on waivers, where he cleared the next day and was subsequently assigned to the Lightning's AHL affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals. He returned to Tampa Bay later in the season, however, and, backing up Dwayne Roloson during the Lightning's 2011 playoff run, made his playoff debut in place of Roloson in the third period of Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Bruins.\nPhoenix/Arizona Coyotes.\nOn July 1, 2011, Smith signed a two-year contract worth $2 million with the Phoenix Coyotes. Smith set the NHL record for the most saves in a regulation shutout victory, as he stopped all 54 shots he faced in a 2–0 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on April 3, 2012. However, his record was later surpassed on January 29, 2014, when Ben Scrivens stopped 59 shots in a 3–0 win for the Edmonton Oilers over the San Jose Sharks. He went on to record an impressive 38 wins in his first season in Phoenix, as the Coyotes qualified for their third consecutive playoff berth, and finished fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy, awarded to the league's top goaltender.\nIn the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, Smith led the Coyotes to their first playoff series win since 1987, beating the Chicago Blackhawks 4–2 in the series. Smith and the Coyotes went on to defeat the Nashville Predators in the Western conference semi-finals, winning the series 4–1. The Coyotes then faced the eventual Stanley Cup champions Los Angeles Kings in the Western Conference Finals, losing the series 4–1. He posted a superb 1.99 GAA and a .944 save percentage, some of the best numbers for starting goaltenders in the playoffs.\nOn July 5, 2013, Smith signed a six-year contract extension with the Coyotes worth $34 million.\nOn October 19, 2013, Smith became the seventh NHL goalie to score a goal with a shot on goal (four other goaltenders have been credited based on own-goals by the opposition). Smith scored with 0.1 seconds left in regulation on an empty net during a win against the Detroit Red Wings. Two months later, Smith would score on himself when, as a result of the hockey puck getting lodged into his waistband, he inadvertently backed into his own net and scored an own goal. The \"butt goal\" handed the game to the Buffalo Sabres, as the game was in overtime.\nCalgary Flames.\nOn June 17, 2017, Smith was traded to the Calgary Flames in exchange for goalie Chad Johnson, prospect Brandon Hickey, and a conditional third-round pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft.\nSmith played his 500th career NHL game on December 9, 2017. This made him the 11th active goalie to reach the milestone and tied him with Jeff Hackett for 69th place on the all-time list.\nAfter being glanced over for the 2018 NHL All-Star Game, Smith was invited as a replacement for Los Angeles Kings goalie Jonathan Quick, who declined his invitation due to a nagging injury.\nEdmonton Oilers.\nOn July 1, 2019, Smith was signed by the Edmonton Oilers to a one-year, $2-million contract.\nOn October 10, 2020, the Oilers re-signed Smith to a one-year, $2 million contract.\nOn July 21, 2021, the Oilers re-signed Smith to a two-year, $4.4 million extension.\nInternational play.\nSmith won a gold medal with Canada's 2014 Winter Olympic team, dressing as a backup for one of Canada's group games. He did not see any ice time and was primarily the third choice goaltender. He also won gold at the 2015 world championships as Canada's starting goalie, going 8–0 through the tournament and recording a shutout streak of 190:03 in the medal round (the final three games).\nPersonal life.\nSmith was raised in Verona, Ontario.\nSmith and Canadian former World Cup skier Brigitte Acton married September 3, 2010. The couple have four children together."

        "text": "The Brian Lara Cricket Academy is a multi-purpose stadium in Tarouba, San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago, that was completed and inaugurated in 2017. It will be used mostly for cricket matches. It is located in southern Trinidad, just outside the heart of the city of San Fernando, beside the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway, about two kilometres southeast of Trinidad and Tobago's former cricket ground at Guaracara Park, Pointe-a-Pierre.\nBuilt to hold 15,000 people in a mix of fixed seating and grass banks it is named after former West Indies cricket captain Brian Lara, who until 17 October 2008 was the all-time leading run scorer in Test cricket, until he was surpassed by Sachin Tendulkar.\nIt was initially planned to host warm-up matches during the 2007 Cricket World Cup and serve as a cricket academy after the tournament. However when it became apparent that the facility would not be completed in time for the tournament the warm-up matches were instead hosted at the Frank Worrell Field at UWI St Augustine.\nThe Caribbean Premier League chose the Brian Lara Cricket Academy as the host for the final matches of the 2017 tournament, the first high-profile matches at the ground. Subsequent to this the Government of Trinidad and Tobago further purchased the rights to hold the CPL finals from 2018 through to 2020 at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy.\nDevelopment.\nThe Brian Lara Cricket Academy was commissioned in 2004 by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago through the state company UDeCOTT to provide a high class sporting venue for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. With Trinidad and Tobago receiving the Brown Package of matches and the use of the Queens Park Oval as the primary venue, the Brian Lara facility was earmarked to host warm-up matches. To be ready for the Cricket World Cup the facility had to be completed by February 2007 and game ready by March 2007.\nMajor design and construction problems kept pushing back the completion date as well as increasing the construction cost. Once it became apparent it would not be ready for the World Cup, matches were shifted to the grounds at UWI. The delays and costs have made the complex one of the more controversial infrastructure projects undertaken in Trinidad and Tobago. The initial cost was estimated to be TT$257 million, but with the cost overruns and the increase in prices of materials, in 2009 the estimated costs were TT$700 million and by the time the facility was eventually opened in 2017 the costs had exceeded TT$1billion.\nOther sports.\nThe Brian Lara Cricket Academy was meant to be a component of a larger complex situated on of farm land in Tarouba, with a cost of TT$1.1 billion. It was designed by Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum, a US architectural firm. The complex was proposed to consist of:\nThe completed stadium serves as a training facility for cricketers. It has four indoor cricket training pitches with computerised biometric technology to measure an athlete’s performance, including two full-length run-up pitches for fast bowlers. Spectators have an unhindered view from every area of the stadium, including the concessionaires area. It also has areas specifically designed for the print, radio and television media.\nThe facility may also include a hotel in the future. It has been estimated to cost an additional TT$190 million.\nCricket matches.\nThe first major cricket matches at the ground were several of the matches of the Caribbean Premier League in September 2017, including the final. The first first-class match was held in November 2017: in 2017-18 and 2018–19 the Trinidad and Tobago team played some of its home matches in the Regional Four Day Competition there, and some at Queen's Park Oval in Port of Spain."

        "title": "Major League Baseball scandals",
        "text": "There have been many dramatic on-and-off-field moments in over 130 years of Major League Baseball:\nGambling scandals.\nBaseball had frequent problems with gamblers influencing the game, until the 1920s when the Black Sox Scandal and the resultant merciless crackdown largely put an end to it. The scandal involved eight players and all were suspended for life.\n1877 Louisville Grays scandal.\nAfter a losing streak towards the end of the season cost the Louisville Grays the pennant, members of the team were discovered to have thrown games for money. Four players, including star pitcher Jim Devlin, were banned from professional baseball for life.\n1908 bribery attempt.\nOn the eve of the \"playoff\" or \"makeup\" game between the Chicago Cubs and the New York Giants that would decide the National League championship, an umpire refused an attempted bribe intended to help the Giants win. The Giants lost to the Cubs, and the matter was kept fairly quiet. It came out the following spring, but the results of the official inquiry were kept secret. However, the Giants' team physician for 1908 was reportedly the culprit and was banned for life.\nRecent research has suggested that the team physician was allowed to be the \"scapegoat\"; some baseball historians now suspect that the Giants' manager, John McGraw, was behind the physician's bribe attempt, or that it may in fact have been McGraw himself who approached the umpire. If true, and had it become known, it could have been disastrous, as McGraw was such a prominent figure in the game.\n1914 World Series upset.\nThe four-game sweep of the Philadelphia Athletics by the Boston Braves in the 1914 World Series was stunning. Students of that Series suspect that the Athletics were angry at their notoriously miserly owner, Connie Mack, and that the A's players did not give the Series their best effort. Although such an allegation was never proven, Mack apparently thought that it was at least a strong possibility, and he soon traded or sold all of the stars away from that 1914 team. The A's team was decimated, and within two years they limped to the worst single-season win-loss percentage in modern baseball history (36-117, .235); it would be over a decade before they recovered.\n1917–1918 suspicions.\nThe manner in which the New York Giants lost to the Chicago White Sox in the 1917 World Series raised some suspicions. A key play in the final game involved Heinie Zimmerman chasing Eddie Collins across an unguarded home plate. Immediately afterward, Zimmerman (who had also hit only .120 during the Series) denied throwing the game or the Series. Within two years, Zimmerman and his corrupt teammate Hal Chase would be suspended for life, not so much due to any one incident but to a series of questionable actions and associations. The fact that the question of throwing the Series was even raised suggests the level of public consciousness of gamblers' potential influence on the game.\nThen, just a year ahead of the infamous Black Sox scandal, there were rumors of World Series fixing by members of the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs lost the 1918 Series in a sparsely-attended affair that also nearly resulted in a players' strike demanding more than the normal gate receipts. With World War I dominating the news (as well as having shortened the regular baseball season and having caused attendance to shrink) the unsubstantiated rumors were allowed to dissipate.\n1919 conspiracy.\nThe 1919 World Series resulted in the most famous scandal in baseball history, often referred to as the Black Sox Scandal. Eight players from the Chicago White Sox (nicknamed the Black Sox) were accused of throwing the series against the Cincinnati Reds.\nDetails of the scandal remain controversial, and the extent to which each player was said to be involved varied. It was, however, front-page news across the country when the story was uncovered late in the 1920 season, and despite being acquitted of criminal charges (throwing baseball games was technically not a crime), the eight players were banned from organized baseball (i.e. the leagues subject to the National Agreement) for life.\nAlthough betting had been an ongoing problem in baseball since the 1870s, it reached a head in this scandal, resulting in radical changes in the game's organization. It resulted in the dissolution of the National Baseball Commission and the appointment of a Commissioner of Baseball (Kenesaw Mountain Landis) who took firm steps to try to rid the game of gambling influence permanently.\nOne important step was the lifetime ban against the Black Sox Scandal participants. The \"eight men out\" were the great \"natural hitter\" \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson; pitchers Eddie Cicotte and \"Lefty\" Williams; infielders \"Buck\" Weaver, \"Chick\" Gandil, Fred McMullin, and \"Swede\" Risberg; and outfielder \"Happy\" Felsch. Jackson, who was suspended during the peak of his career with a .356 lifetime batting average (all-time third), is still regarded as one of the greatest players not in the Hall of Fame.\n1919 aftermath.\nAfter the 1919 scandal and some further game-fixing incidents in 1920 had been resolved, and with Landis having taken over, the gambling problem apparently went away, for the most part, for decades. Commissioners have taken an almost fanatical interest in the subject, suspending well-known individuals for lengthy times just for having been seen with gamblers; Leo Durocher, manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, was suspended by Commissioner Happy Chandler for the 1947 season for just that reason.\nAfter their retirement, Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays served for a while as greeters at legal Atlantic City gambling casinos. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn issued a ban against them. New Jersey state gaming regulators harshly criticized Kuhn's decision, while newspaper articles of the time pointed out that Mantle and Mays played before there were large player salaries. Their bans were lifted during Commissioner Peter Ueberroth's term.\n1980s Pete Rose betting scandal.\nIn March 1989, Pete Rose, baseball's all-time hits leader and manager of the Cincinnati Reds since 1984, was reported by \"Sports Illustrated\" as betting on Major League games, including Reds games, while he was the manager.\nRose had been questioned about his gambling activities in February 1989 by outgoing commissioner Peter Ueberroth and his successor, National League president A. Bartlett Giamatti. Three days later, lawyer John M. Dowd was retained to investigate the charges against Rose. During the investigation, Giamatti took office as the commissioner of baseball.\nThe \"Dowd Report\" asserted that Pete Rose bet on 52 Reds games in 1987, at a minimum of $10,000 a day.\nRose, facing a very harsh punishment, along with his attorney and agent, Reuven Katz, decided to seek a compromise with Major League Baseball. On August 24, 1989, Rose agreed to a voluntary lifetime ban from baseball. The agreement had three key provisions:\nDespite the \"no finding of fact\" provision, Giamatti immediately stated publicly that he felt that Rose bet on baseball games. Eight days later, September 1, Giamatti suffered a fatal heart attack. The consensus among baseball experts is that Giamatti's post-agreement statement, his sudden and untimely death, and appointment of new commissioner, Fay Vincent, a close friend and great admirer of Giamatti, doomed Pete Rose's hopes of reinstatement.\nBud Selig, the former owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, succeeded Vincent in 1992. Rose has applied for reinstatement twice: in September 1997 and March 2003. In both instances, commissioner Selig chose not to act, thereby keeping the ban intact. Upon Selig's retirement from the Commissioner's Office, Rose applied for reinstatement in March 2015, but Selig's successor Rob Manfred denied the request in December of that year.\nOn February 4, 1991, Rose's ban from baseball was extended to the Baseball Hall of Fame, when the twelve members of the board of directors of the Hall voted unanimously to bar Rose from the ballot. However, Major League Baseball allowed Rose to be a part of the All-Century Team celebration in 1999 since he was named one of the team's outfielders.\nIn 2004, after years of speculation and denial, Rose admitted in his book \"My Prison Without Bars\" that the accusations that he had bet on Reds games were true and that he had admitted it to Selig personally some time before. He stated that he always bet on the Reds, never against them. This claim, while never disproven, is irrelevant: the ban is absolute, regardless of whether the bettor is wagering for or against their own team. William D. Cox was banned for betting for his team, and being able to bet for one's own team raises player safety issues anyway, since players do not wish to risk injury mounting a comeback to save a poor bet.\n1980s collusion.\nRepeatedly in the 1980s, MLB owners colluded to keep player salaries down. Over multiple instances the owners were found to have stolen nearly $400 million from the players. When the Major League Baseball players struck in 1994, the owners were found to have committed unfair labor practices in attempting to keep player salaries down again.\nSubstance abuse.\nBaseball has had its share of problems with substance abuse from the inception. Prior to the 1970s, there were countless individual problems with alcohol abuse, but as alcohol was a legal substance during most of that time (except for the Prohibition era), alcohol was typically seen as a character weakness on the part of individuals. Public awareness of illegal drugs accelerated during the 1970s, and by the 1980s a number of players had become caught up.\n1985 cocaine scandal.\nPittsburgh Pirates players Dave Parker, Dale Berra, Rod Scurry, Lee Mazzilli, Lee Lacy, and John Milner, as well as non-Pirates Willie Mays Aikens, Vida Blue, Enos Cabell, Keith Hernandez, Jeffrey Leonard, Tim Raines, and Lonnie Smith, were summoned to appear before a Pittsburgh grand jury. Their testimony led to the Pittsburgh Drug Trials, which made national headlines in September 1985.\nThe spotlight on the \"Pittsburgh problem\" by the national media led to the more widespread awareness of use of other drugs such as amphetamines (\"greenies\" in baseball vernacular) and marijuana in the game. Both have a long history in baseball; Milner (who had retired two years earlier due to recurring hamstring injuries), in fact, spoke of Willie Mays and Willie Stargell, both iconic figures and Baseball Hall of Famers, giving him \"greenies\".\nTestimony revealed that drug dealers frequented the Pirates' clubhouse. Stories such as Rod Scurry leaving a game in the late innings to look for cocaine and John Milner buying two grams of cocaine for $200 in the bathroom stalls at Three Rivers Stadium during a 1980 game against the Houston Astros shocked the grand jurors. Even Kevin Koch, who played the Pirates' mascot, was implicated for buying cocaine and introducing players to a drug dealer. Ultimately, seven drug dealers pleaded guilty on various charges.\nOn February 28, 1986, Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth suspended a number of players for varying lengths of time. A primary condition of reinstatement was public service. It would have also included urine tests, but the players union was able to successfully halt its implementation. To this day, drug testing, particularly of this sort, is a polarizing issue.\nRod Scurry died at age 36 on November 5, 1992 in a Reno, Nevada intensive care unit of a heart attack after a cocaine-fueled incident with police officers led to his hospitalization.\n2005–2006 steroids investigations.\nThe steroids rumors and facts resulted in several de facto bans from the game by players who were either certifiable or suspected users of steroids, and significant doubt has been cast about the quality of various baseball records set since at least the early 1990s. Some people base their opinion on Jose Canseco's tell-all book \"Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits &amp; How Baseball Got Big\".\n2013 Biogenesis scandal.\nIn 2013, twenty Major League Baseball (MLB) players were accused of using HGH after obtaining it from the clinic Biogenesis of America. Milwaukee Brewers star Ryan Braun, who had a drug-related suspension overturned in 2011, made a deal with MLB and accepted a 65-game ban. Two weeks later, New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez was suspended through the 2014 season (211 games), and 12 other players were suspended for 50 games. It was the most players ever suspended at one time by MLB.\n2021 Spider Tack Scandal.\nThe 2021 pitch doctoring controversy arose in Major League Baseball (MLB) around pitchers' use of foreign substances, such as the resin-based Spider Tack, to improve their grip and spin rate on their pitches. On June 15, 2021, MLB announced a 10-game suspension for any player caught using foreign substances on baseballs, with umpire inspections of all pitchers starting on June 21, a decision that was met with mixed reactions from players and coaches.\nSign stealing scandals.\nHouston Astros.\nIn 2019, Mike Fiers of the Oakland Athletics spoke to Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drelich of \"The Athletic\" where he revealed the Astros had been electronically stealing signs since at least the 2017 season. After an investigation by MLB, Astros manager A. J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow were each suspended for one year from MLB. In addition, the Astros were fined $5 million and lost their first- and second-round draft picks for the 2020 and 2021 MLB drafts. After the news broke, Astros owner Jim Crane fired both Hinch and Lunhow. Hinch admitted to knowing about the scheme and discouraging it, but not reporting or stopping it. Both Carlos Beltrán and Alex Cora were also implicated in the report by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred.\nBoston Red Sox.\nThe Boston Red Sox, managed by Cora beginning in the 2018 season, were also accused in a story on \"The Athletic\" of having their own sign stealing scheme. On January 14, 2020, Cora and the Red Sox agreed to \"mutually part ways\". In a statement after the news Cora said, \"I do not want to be a distraction\". The report on the Red Sox scheme was not released before the decision. Two days later, Beltrán and the New York Mets came to a similar parting of the ways; the Mets had hired him as the team's new manager less than three months earlier.\nOn April 22, 2020, MLB suspended Red Sox video replay system operator J.T. Watkins without pay through the 2020 postseason and stripped the team of its second-round draft pick this year after completing an investigation into allegations that Boston stole signs during the 2018 season. Alex Cora was also suspended through the 2020 postseason, but only for his conduct as Houston's bench coach."

The club competes in the Shute Shield competition run by the New South Wales Rugby Union.\nThe club has produced 42 Wallaby representatives. The club's home ground is the historic North Sydney Oval on the North Shore of Sydney. The ground has been a venue for both codes of rugby and for cricket over more than a century.\nClub history.\nPre World War One.\nRugby on the lower North Shore is over 130 years old. Council minutes reveal that the North Shore Football Club played on a paddock adjoining Holterman's Tower, the present location of Shore School.\nThe club later transferred to St Leonard's Park and became known as the Pirates, a team which won the First Grade Premiership in 1898 and the R.A.S. Trophy in 1897/8/9, defeating the neighbouring Wallaroos 10-nil in the third final.\nThe Pirates and Wallaroos combined in 1900 to form North Sydney. It was the first district club to affiliate with the metropolitan Rugby Union in the initial eight-club district competition. The date was 5 April, ahead of Wests on 11 April and Easts on 12 April.\nJim Henderson, commemorated in the present premiership trophies for third and fourth grades, was North's first secretary, and the club's first cap was winger Charlie White, who played in the first-ever test-match in 1899 against the British Isles and then in the first Australia v New Zealand test in 1903.\nThe club did not win any premierships prior to the 1914–18 war, but before competitions were suspended, its name was changed to Northern Suburbs. However, for reasons today unknown, the new name was not implemented until the 1928 season.\nUnder the guidance of one-eyed (lost in action in France) Fred Aarons, Norths played a leading role in the resurgence of rugby in Sydney during the 1920s. The reserve grade won the club's first premiership in 1925 and, in 1929, Norths won the initial Club Championship.\nThe year 1928 saw a young recruit arrive, one Gavin John Andrews, who is now enshrined as the club's greatest treasure, Bon Andrews, after whom North Sydney No. 2 Oval is named.\nThe first of North's two 'golden eras' occurred in the early 1930s. The club's initial first-grade premiership was in 1933, beating Manly 8–6, and again beating Manly in 1935 by 22–5.\nThe inaugural fourth-grade competition in 1932, back-to-back Club Championships in 1934 and 1935 and seven other minor grade premierships, highlighted the first half of the decade.\nAustralian caps in the 1930s were 'Big' Tom Perrin, Waratah Sid King, ex-Kiwi Bill Hemingway, dual international Wal Mackney (stroke of the rowing eight at the Berlin Olympic Games, half Mike Gibbons and Eric Hutchinson who, with brother Frank, was killed while serving in World War II.\nPost World War One.\nThe Red and Blacks took some time to get back on top after the war, winning only the Third Grade Premiership in 1947, the Fourths a year later and nothing in the fifties. In 1947 Roger Cornforth played the first of his two Tests against the All Blacks. Controversially omitted from the 1947–48 Wallabies to the British Isles, this then allowed him to represent Australia at the 1948 Olympics in London at water polo. He also played against the 1950 British Lions.\nPeter Rothwell, Jim Cross and John Carroll added their names to North's honour roll in the 1950s and by 1960 John Thornett and Rod Phelps had joined Norths to improve its fortunes when once again defeating Manly, 21–3, Norths won its third First Grade Premiership and fourth Club Championship and its second Golden Era was ushered in.\nThree years later, the Red and Blacks beat Sydney University back-to-back for the 1963 and '64 First Grade Premierships, together with the Club Championship for those years.\nIn 1964 Norths won three out of the four grade premierships, a rare feat until Randwick's run in the 1980s. In all, eight premierships were won in the 1960s and three Club Championships. From the Thornett and Phelps days, Roy Prosser (for several years Australia's most capped prop), Les Austin, Andy Town, John 'Sparrow' Dowse, Hugh Rose, Reg Smith, Garrick Fay, Peter Carson and Andy Stewart kept Norths alive in the test arena. Others, including Peter Johnston, Keith Henry, playwright and actor Warwick Moss, Peter Medway, Dennis Turnbull, Graeme Ewens, five-eight Jim Allen, Wallaby David Codey who played his Colts Rugby at Norths and ex- Rugby Club president, Russ Tulloch, played for the State. Russ also toured to Great Britain with the Wallabies. There was also the Westralian-Kiwi Bob Thompson.\nThe club won eight premierships during the 1970s including First Grade in 1975. Norths also toured Singapore and Malaysia in 1970 (7 games), England and Wales in 1973 (7 games), USA West Coast in 1976 (6 games) and England, the Netherlands, Belgium and France in 1977 (8 games). By 1981 when, unhappily relegated to Second Division, Norths stood fourth on the list of premierships won in all senior grades in the First Division.\nThere was no doubt that Norths were unlucky to be relegated in 1981. Even though the club went down, it still won the Fourth Grade Premiership. The criterion then was based on the First Grade team and Norths had a disastrous year, scoring only four wins and a draw.\nNorths were relegated with Hornsby, despite being just one point behind Sydney University and, in the club championship, was actually ahead of Warringah, Sydney Uni, St George and Hornsby.\nNorths went on to win the Sydney Rugby Union (second Division) Club Championship in 1986, 1987 and 1988. Finally, after winning it again in 1989, Norths won promotion back into First Division.\nHowever, also during this period the Club undertook two overseas tours. In 1984 there were 6 games against teams in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The club returned to Europe at the end of the 1988, with fixtures in England, France, Belgium and Italy. Some described it as an arduous four-week tour.\nIn the eight years out of Sydney's top division through the 1980s, Norths won 12 premierships including three in first grade as well as four club championships.\nIn addition to those grade rugby successes, a tremendous effort was made to develop the Colts and 12 premierships were won in various grades, which formed a sound basis for the return to First Division.\n1990s.\nIn its first year back, 1990, Norths finished eighth out of 11. In 1991 North's fourth-grade players were semi-finalists and its second-grade Colts were premiers —a first-ever senior Colts win.\nThe season also saw North's first addition to its Australian honours list since 1979—Richard Tombs was selected in the victorious Wallaby World Cup squad. But he had to wait until 1992 to play his first two tests, against Scotland, at home.\nThe 1993 season saw seven teams reach the semis, with Reserve Grade and Colts Seconds and Thirds winning premierships. There was also an overseas tour to the US, playing games in Los Angeles, New Orleans and New York.\n1994 saw the merger of North's two clubs (licensed and rugby). The Alfred Street properties were disposed of. The club purchased and moved to Christie Street, St Leonards location. Third and Fourth Grade won premierships that year, as did the Second Grade Colts.\nRichard Tombs won the inaugural Sydney Morning Herald 'Rugby Player of the Year Award' in 1995, with Nick Harvey being the youngest winner of the AAMI Medal. Fifth Grade won a premiership, and the club toured France, Belgium, Germany and UK at the end of the season.\n1996 saw the beginning of professional rugby. Sixth Grade won the Premiership which was the final year that grade was run in the premier competition.\nIn 1997 the Club lost its Patron and Honorary Life Member, George Marshall. The same year, members voted to change the club's accounting year to close on 30 June annually.\n1997 also saw the arrival of Dennis Brown of New Zealand as head coach attracting such players as the 'bushwackers' dean et al. Plus a contingent of northern hemisphere players such as Fintan 'clinton napkin' Godkin, Linus 'why was I invited to the 1st grade trail' Mortlock the party even included Welsh legends Barry John and Carwyn James. Due to the high standard of these players and the reputation of Norths hospitality more followed in Scotsman David McComisky and Andrew 'Action' Jackson. The boys all left with fond memories of Norths and the 5th grade kit was a little lighter that year after they left! But was easily replaced due to the extraordinary bar profits established that year.\nThe 1998 season proved to be the best since 1975 with a string of notable statistics. These included all five grade teams in the Grand Final, winning Second and Fifth Grade premierships. Norths won The Herald Club of the Year Award, and Michael Sykes the Club Player of the Year.\nKeith Gleeson won the Ken Catchpole Medal (Best &amp; Fairest) in 1999, and at season's end a Club team toured Spain and Portugal. The 90's saw quite a number of players achieving representative honours. Jim Allen, Dominic Vaughan, Mick Kearins, Rod (Rambo) Clark, Sam Domoni, Richard Tombs, Mark Bell, Nick Harvey, Darren Junee, Keith Gleeson and Graeme Bond all played for the N.S.W Waratahs with Bond also playing at the ACT Brumbies in 1999 with Troy Jaques and former 1991 N.S.W Waratah Craig Wells. The representative careers of Ben Darwin and Al Baxter also began to emerge.\n2000s.\nThe year 2000 saw Northern Suburbs celebrate 100 years with the Norths Centenary Dinner, a black-tie affair at the Wentworth Hotel with over 300 people in attendance.\nThe 2001 rugby highlight was obviously the success of the first-grade team securing the minor premiership for the first time since 1960. The season also saw the Wallaby debuts of Ben Darwin and Graeme Bond, with Al Baxter and Francis Cullimore gaining Super 12 contracts.\nDuring the year the Bon Andrews Bequest was established with the $25,000 he left to the club. This money is used to provide educational assistance to talented young players. During the year Vince Arena created a little more history for the club by playing his 300th match for Norths, and on retirement is second only to Bon Andrews in club games.\nFifth Grade won the John Thornett Cup in 2002, and First Grade Colts made it to the grand final for the first time since 1977. Milton Thaiday and Lachlan McKay were offered Super 12 contracts, and First Grade finished second in the Shute Shield, and sixth in the inaugural Tooheys New Cup.\nIn 2003 the season kicked off for some with a tour to Japan. First Grade finished fourth in the Tooheys New Cup, and captain Mark Challender achieved the SMH's ˜Club Player of the Year' award. Kevin Horan was voted ˜Club Coach of the Year'. All four Colts teams qualified for the semis, with First and Fourths losing narrowly in both grand finals. In the Rugby World Cup, Ben Darwin and Al Baxter played for the Wallabies (Al having made his debut earlier in the season against the All Blacks), and Tonga Leaʻaetoa and Sai Latu represented Tonga. And Keith Gleeson played for Ireland.\nEarly 2005 saw Northern Suburbs' club house undergo extensive renovations to reopen in June as Cabana Bar and Lounge. Cabana Bar has since cemented itself as a central venue to Sydney's north shore night life and a strong financial building block for the club.\n2008 was a year of mixed emotions for the club. The colts teams had a disappointing year with some upheaval in the coaching staff and a reduction in player numbers compared to the year before. In hand with the reduction in young blood entering the club, Northern Suburbs were sad to see the passing away of one of their greatest treasures from the 1960s and 70s in Vale Roy Prosser. Roy still holds the club record for the highest number of First Grade games at 220. The Grand Final for 2008 saw Second Grade come from fifth on the table to claim the Premiership after being Runners Up the year before. The Second Grade Coaches Tony Horan and Grahame O'Donnell received a further reward in being promoted to coaching First Grade for the 2009 season.\n2010 saw Norths, Waratahs and Wallabies front rower Al Baxter become the most capped New South Wales front rower when he received his 100th cap in the Super 14. An end of season tour to the United States of America was a success, playing New York Athletic Club, Gentleman of Aspen Rugby Club and Las Vegas Blackjacks.\n2010s and onwards.\nIn 2012 Norths 4th grade team secured the Henderson Cup in beating Manly at Concord Oval 21–0. All grade teams featured in the finals with 5th grade runners up for the John Thornett cup against Sydney University (played under lights at Sydney University Oval no.1). 1st Colts played in the Grand Final at Forshaw Rugby Park.\nIn 2015 Head Coach, Simon Cron was awarded Coach of the Year and Will Miller was runner up in the Ken Catchpole Medal.\nIn 2016 Norths broke a 41-year drought to claim the highly elusive Shute Shield after defeating Sydney University 28–15 at North Sydney Oval. Pandemonium ensued after Norths scored late in the Grand Final with thousands of fans flooding the field in celebration. Captain Will Miller was awarded the Ken Catchpole Medal in addition to Player of the Finals Series honours. Breakout centre Irae Simone was awarded Shute Shield Rookie of the Year for his performances over the course of the season, he then went on and starred in the now Sydney Rays NRC campaign, falling short in the semi-finals and was awarded a contract with NSW Waratahs. \nNorths' Colts 1 side also made their respective final, ironically, going down to Sydney University at Forshaw Rugby Park.\nIn 2017 Norths featured in the 1st and 4th Grade Grand Finals at North Sydney Oval. In February Norths beat Brisbane Brothers to win the Australian Club Championship.\n2018 saw 4th and 3rd Grade both play in Grand Finals at North Sydney Oval. 3rd Grade were victorious."

        "text": "The 1970 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 15 October 1969 to 11 April 1970, as an edition of the World Snooker Championship. The final was held at Victoria Hall in London from 6 to 11 April 1970. The championship was sponsored by Player's No.6 for the second and last time.\nThere were nine participants in the tournament, one more than in the previous year. The defending champion was John Spencer, who had defeated Gary Owen 37–24 in the final of the 1969 World Snooker Championship. Spencer was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 1970 event with a 33–37 loss to Ray Reardon, who claimed the title with a 37–33 final victory over John Pulman. Reardon also made the highest of the tournament, a 118, and received a total prize money of £1,225. He held the world title for only seven months, until the next championship in Australia which concluded in November 1970. Reardon eventually won a total of six world titles, the last of these in 1978.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until 1935, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship.\nIn 1952, the, following a dispute between the Professional Billiards Players' Association (PBPA) and the BACC about the distribution of income from the world championship, the PBPA members established an alternative competition known as the World Professional Match-play Championship, the editions of which are now recognised as world championships, whilst only Horace Lindrum and Clark McConachy entered for the BACC's 1952 World Snooker Championship. The World Professional Match-play Championship continued until 1957, after which there were no world championship matches until it was revived on a challenge basis in 1964. John Pulman retained the title in several challenges from 1964 to 1968. Tobacco brand John Player sponsored his 1968 match against Eddie Charlton. The good attendances for the championship match led to John Player deciding to sponsor the 1969 World Snooker Championship as a knock-out format tournament, using their \"Players No. 6\" brand. The 1969 championship is regarded as the first of the modern snooker era, and was won by John Spencer, who defeated Gary Owen 37–24 in the final.\nThe 1970 Championship was sponsored by tobacco company John Player, using their Player's No.6 brand, the second and last time that they were the world championship sponsors. The tournament was played between 15 October 1969 and 11 April 1970. The winner of the event received cumulative prize money of £1,225. The eight players who participated in the 1969 championship all entered again, joined by David Taylor, who had turned professional after winning the 1968 World Amateur Snooker Championship.\nPrize fund.\nPrize money was awarded as follows:\nTournament summary.\nThere was one first round match, which was played as the best of 21 between Taylor and Bernard Bennett at the Yew Tree Labour Club, West Bromwich, from 15 to 17 October 1969. Bennett won the first two frames, and the players were level at 3–3 before the first day finished with Bennett 4–3 up. He added the eighth frame, with Taylor then taking four consecutive frames. After Bennett won the 13th frame, Taylor made a break of 52 and led 8–6. Taylor ensured qualification for the next round by securing a winning margin at 11–8, with the score 12–9 after .\nThe quarter-finals were played as the best of 61 frames. Owen met Williams at West Bromwich Community Centre from 1 to 6 December, and won all six frames in their first session. He won the seventh frame too, before Williams registered his first frame win. With Williams missing many attempts to balls, Owen took a winning lead at 31–11, and finished 46–15 ahead. Spencer played Jackie Rea at the Co-Op Hall, Bolton, from 8 to 12 December, and won 31–15. Reardon and Fred Davis contested their semi-final from 15 to 19 December at Longport W.M.C., Bolton, with Reardon prevailing 31–26. The last quarter-final, between Pulman and Taylor, was held from 12 to 16 January 1970, at Grimsby and Cleethorpes Transport Recreation Club. After the first two days of play, the pair were tied at 12 frames each, before Pulman went on to win 31–20, and 39–22 after dead frames.\nThe semi-finals were both contested over 73 frames. Spencer and Reardon played their semi-final from 16 to 21 February at the Co-Op Hall, Bolton. In his 1982 autobiography, Reardon recalled that the of the billiard table were \"far too tight for a championship\" and that \"You could not pot the off the at speed with much confidence. The ball was drifting and skidding everywhere and was uncontrollable.\" Reardon built an 8–5 lead on the first day, and led 13–6 after day two. Writing for \"Billiards and Snooker\" magazine, Norman Haseldine thought that Reardon started to manage the \"peculiar running\" of the balls on the table better than Spencer did, although \"both players were guilty of innumerable misses ... and the match never attained the high standard expected\". Reardon went on to defeat Spencer 37–33. The second semi-final took place at Priory Social Club, Middlesbrough from 23 to 28 February, between Pulman and Owen. Pulman led 9–3 after the first day, and extended this to 19–5 on the next day, then to 27–9 after day three. He won 37–13, and the match finished 48–25 after dead frames.\nThe final was held at the Victoria Hall in Bloomsbury Square, London, from 6 to 11 April, as the best of 73 frames. Reardon led 4–2 after the first session, and 8–4 after the second. On the next day, Reardon won four of the six afternoon session frames, and Pulman took four of the six evening frames, including the last three of the session, leaving Reardon 14–10 ahead. Reardon later extended his lead to 27–14, but Pulman narrowed the deficit to a single frame at 33–34. Reardon eventually won 37–33. Reardon received prize money of £1,125 (£750 for winning the final, £300 for winning the semi-final and £175 for winning the quarter-final) and Pulman took £975 (£500 as runner up, and the same amounts as Reardon for the semi-final and quarter-finals). Pulman said after the match that Reardon had deserved to win, and acclaimed Reardon's long potting. Pulman also stated that he felt that his own consistency in matches had been diminished due to a lack of match practice, leading to lapses in concentration. Reardon later wrote that \"nothing will ever surpass the wonder of winning the world crown for the first time\", and that the win made him financially secure for the first time since becoming a professional player: \"I knew that the gamble had succeeded, that I could settle my debts and that the lean years were over. They had been well worthwhile.\"\nReardon held the title for only seven months until the next championship in Australia during November 1970. He went on to win a total of six world championships, the last of them in 1978.\nMain draw.\nThe draw and results for the tournament are shown below.

The tournament was the 1971 edition of the World Snooker Championship, first held in 1927 but was held in 1970. It was the first time the event had been held outside England outside of two challenge matches in 1965, with matches held at various locations in New South Wales and Brisbane. The event featured nine participants, with a round-robin round producing four qualifiers, who then competed in a single-elimination tournament.\nRay Reardon was the defending champion, having defeated John Pulman in the 1970 final, however Reardon lost to John Spencer in the semi-final. Spencer won the event for the second time by defeating Warren Simpson 37–29 in the final held in the Chevron Hotel in Sydney. Eddie Charlton made the highest of the tournament with a 129 in the final session of his round-robin match against Gary Owen.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the sport was popular in the British Isles. However, in the modern era it has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nThis championship featured nine professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a round-robin format, from which four players qualified to a single elimination format. Each match is played over a predetermined number of and . Joe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, the final match being held in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England.\nFormat.\nThe championship was held from 28 September to 7 November 1970 at several locations across Australia. This was the first time the championship was held outside the United Kingdom aside from two challenge matches in 1965, and it would be later hosted in Australia again in 1975. The initial stage was a round robin in which the matches were of 37 frames, played across three days, and each competitor played four of the other eight competitors. The number of frames needed to win a match increased at the semi-finals stage. The semi-finals were scheduled to be the best-of-49 and the final as the best-of-73 frames.\nTournament summary.\nRound-robin.\nThe first match was held from 28 to 30 September between Paddy Morgan and Warren Simpson. The match was won by Morgan by a score of 21–16. Eddie Charlton and Norman Squire met in the second match, during which Charlton made a break of 106, the first century break of the championship. The British players did not start their matches until 6 October when John Spencer, John Pulman and Gary Owen started their first matches.\nRay Reardon started his first match on 9 October where he defeated Perrie Mans. Spencer made a break of 105 in his second win, over Norman Squire, which finished 27–10. Reardon and Spencer both played again from 12 to 14 October.

The highest break of the match was a 95 by Simpson.\nThe second semi-final, between Spencer and Reardon, was played from 27 to 30 October at Parramatta Leagues Club, Sydney. Spencer took a 9–3 lead on the first day, however, Reardon made a 108 break during the evening session. Spencer extended his lead to 19–5 after two days and won the match 25–7 on the third evening. Spencer made a break of 106 on the third afternoon and Reardon made one of 109 in a dead frame on the third evening. The match ended with Spencer leading 34–15. Reardon's defeat meant he held the record as the player with the shortest reign as world champion.\nThe final was held from 2 to 7 November at the Chevron Hotel in Sydney. Spencer led 8–4 after the first day, and 17–7 after the second day. He made a break of 105 on the second afternoon and then made breaks of 126 and 107 in the second and third frames of the evening session. At the half-way stage Simpson had reduced Spencer's lead to 20–16, but missed a number of easy shots as Spencer won nine of the twelve frames on the fourth day to lead 29–19. Spencer was 34–26 ahead by the end of day five, and eventually won the match 37–29 in the final frame of the afternoon session on the sixth day, having led 36–26. The remaining \"dead frames\" were played, resulting in a final score of 42–31 to Spencer. Spencer won his second world title and earned £2,333. Simpson had reached the final at his first attempt.\nResults.\nKnockout stage.\nThe remaining four players contested a knockout round. The basis on which the semi-final draw was organised is not known. The 22 October edition of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" reports that Reardon would play Spencer in the second semi-final. At the time Reardon and Spencer still had to play each other and Charlton, Owen and Simpson also had one match to play. So the final order of the group was still undecided. Snooker historian Clive Everton has speculated that the draw was changed \"behind the scenes ... perhaps to ensure an Australian finalist.\" The draw and results from the semi-finals and final are shown below. Players in bold denote match winners.\nFinal.\nFrame scores in bold are winning scores."

        "title": "John Hart (rugby union coach)",
        "text": "John Bernard Hart (born 1945) is a New Zealand former rugby union personality who coached and managed both the All Blacks and the Auckland rugby union team, and played rugby for Waitemata and Auckland.\nEarly years and playing career.\nHart was born in Auckland to father Joe, who worked for the bicycle importing company W.H. Worrall and Company, and mother Joan. He was the second of four children; he had an older brother, Graeme, a younger sister Loraine and a younger brother, Ian.\nHart was educated at Mount Roskill Grammar School, where he was best all-round sportsman, head of his house and deputy prefect in his final year. He then enrolled in a Bachelor of Commerce at University of Auckland in hope of becoming an accountant, but his attention was more focused towards leisure than his studies. Hart no longer qualified for a bursary after failing more subjects in his second year, forcing him to complete his degree part-time.\nHe was later appointed Group Employee Relations Director for Fletcher Challenge, then New Zealand's largest company.\nCoaching at Auckland.\nJohn Hart began his first class coaching career for Auckland in 1982. He coached Auckland to the National Provincial Championship (NPC) title in 1982, 1984 and 1985, and it was during his tenure that, in 1985, Auckland won the Ranfurly Shield from Canterbury and began the series of 61 successful defences that remains a record in shield history.\nHart, together with Alex Wyllie, was an assistant coach under Brian Lochore when the All Blacks won the first Rugby World Cup in 1987. In 1988, Lochore retired from coaching and Wyllie was appointed to succeed him, an appointment that upset many, especially Auckland, fans. Hart then refused to be part of the selection panel, but was eventually appointed co-coach with Wyllie for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. In hindsight, this was widely regarded to be a mistake: the personality clash between the two coaches was reflected in a split within the squad into Auckland and Canterbury factions.\nFollowing the All Blacks' loss to Australia in the semi-finals, Wyllie resigned, while Hart sought to become head coach, but was beaten to the post by the then Otago coach Laurie Mains.\nMains coached the All Blacks to the final of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, which was won by South Africa, continued as coach for a year-end tour to France, after which he resigned and was replaced by John Hart. During Hart's tenure as head coach, the All Blacks achieved their first ever series win in South Africa, in 1996, and won the Tri-Nations three times, in 1996/97 and 1999. But when New Zealand lost unexpectedly to France in the semi-final of the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Hart, like his immediate predecessors, resigned. As head coach, Hart was in charge of the All Blacks for 41 games, winning 31, drawing one and losing nine.\nIn 1990, John Hart was the coach of a New Zealand Under-21 side that toured Australia. Martin Johnson, who captained England to the title at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, was one of the players in the squad.\nLife after coaching.\nIn January 2005, Hart was appointed to the Board of Cullen Sports, owners of the New Zealand Warriors, a New Zealand rugby league club, for which he later served as the Executive Director of Football. He also served on the boards of a number of other companies, provides consultancy services in the fields of human resources and leadership, and is an active speaker on the lecture circuit. In December 2011 Hart resigned from the Warriors and took up a position as the New Zealand PGA Pro-Am organising committee chairman.\nIn the 1997 Queen's Birthday Honours, Hart was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby.\nHart is the co-author (with Paul Thomas) of two books, \"Straight from the Hart\" (1993) and \"Change of Hart\" (1997) (); the latter gives a first-hand account of the transition to professional rugby, in which he played a significant part."

        "text": "The Sanix World Rugby Youth Invitational Tournament is an international rugby union tournament for 15-a-side youth teams which is held every year during the Golden Week holidays (29 April – 5/6 May) in Fukuoka prefecture, Japan. Participation is by invitation only, and the overseas schools selected by their respective unions to represent their country are generally expected to be of a high standard and among the top five in each country. The event is hosted by the Japan Rugby Football Union and supported by various local bodies including the Kyushu RFU, the Sanix Sports Foundation and Munakata City. The Global Arena in Munakata, Fukuoka on the island of Kyūshū is the venue for this tournament.\nHistory.\nIn 2000 the first tournament was contested by 11 Japanese and five foreign high school teams from various countries. (The tournament expanded from 16 to 20 schools in 2009, thus increasing in both size and importance.) It is a unique competition in world rugby for high schools, and is almost a \"mini World Cup\". The idea was devised and initially funded by the Sanix company president Mr. Munemasa. Sanix still provides about half the substantial costs for overseas teams to participate.\nThree or four of the Japanese teams are from the local area Kyūshū, where high school rugby is particularly strong. The rest are from elsewhere in Japan. A Scottish pipe band is a regular fixture, though there was no band in 2007. However Dollar Academy has participated twice as Scotland's sole representative so far in the tournament in 2000 and 2004, and George Watson's College Pipe Band, Edinburgh have played both the opening and closing ceremonies from 2008 to date. One Italian team (Istituto Casteller) took part in 2002, and Carmarthenshire College from Wales has also participated.\nIn 2014 the tournament debuted a girls' rugby sevens tournament to run parallel to the boys' competition. The debut girls' tournament was won by a Kanto regional selection team, and the most recent champions are St Mary's College, Wellington who won the 2017 tournament.\nCompeting nations.\nAs of 2018 a total of 20 countries have participated in at least one edition of the Sanix World Rugby Youth Tournament, with many countries being represented annually. Nations who have competed in the tournament are as follows:\nChampions.\nBoys' competition.\nSchools with multiple appearances.\nIn the table below, teams are ordered first by number of appearances, then by number of wins, and finally by year of first appearance. In the \"Seasons\" column, bold years indicate winning seasons."

        "title": "St Patrick's Rugby Club",
        "text": "St Patrick's Rugby Club, also known as St Pats, is a rugby union club based in Strathfield, New South Wales. The club, formerly known as St Patrick's Old Boys, currently field six teams in the second division of the NSW Suburban competition, known as \"Subbies\". St Pats was formed in 1964 and since their elevation to first division had not been relegated until 2017. The club was formed by ex-students of St Patrick's College, Strathfield but now has members from various backgrounds including a number of international players.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1964, but initially played rugby league. After St Patrick's College changed to being a rugby union school in 1965, St Pats Rugby Club fielded an under 20s rugby union side in the Western Sydney Junior competition in 1966.\nThe club had expanded to field three teams by 1969, with two sides playing in the NSW Subbies second division. John O’Rourke was the coach. Because Knox Rugby Club also played in black, St Pats made a jersey change to include gold hoops. The club added a fourth team in 1971 as the competition expanded, but was still training at St Patrick's College during those years.\nSt Pats won the Club division two championship in 1973 (as well as the C.W. Blunt Cup for the second grade premiership) and gained promotion to play in Subbies division one for the following season. The club's training location was moved to Ashfield Centenary Sports Ground in 1974 and the Illinois Hotel was the de facto clubhouse. The black jersey with a gold collar (as used by St Patrick's College) was adopted in 1979.\nIn 1980, the club moved home ground again, this time to Hudson Park and a new clubhouse was built and opened the following year. Field lighting was installed in the 1990s and upgraded in 2005 to allow night matches to be played. The St Pats club currently fields six teams in the NSW Subbies competition .\nPremierships.\nThe club has won twenty six premierships across various grades. The Kentwell Cup trophy has been won on four occasions; in 1975 – coached by Don Loughry, in 1993 – coached by Paul Donnellan, in 2013 – shared with Balmain after a 33-all extra-time draw, and in 2014 after a 40–5 trouncing of Drummoyne\nNotes\nClub Championships.\nSt Patrick's has won the Club Championship Trophy on six occasions. The Second Division \"Reliance Shield\" in 1973, and the Club Championship in the First Division in 1976, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2013, and 2014.\nThe club also won the interdivisional championship, known as the Cowboy Cup, in 2013.\nNotable players.\nThe club's current first grade coach is Don Burke of Burke's Backyard fame."

        "title": "2019 Cricket World Cup",
        "text": "The 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was the 12th Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The tournament was hosted between 30 May and 14 July across 10 venues in England and a single venue in Wales. It was the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup, while for Wales it was their third. \nThe tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams in the previous edition, with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games not have a result, India, Australia, England, and New Zealand finished as the top four, with Pakistan missing out on net run rate.\nIn the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the final, which was played at Lord's in London. The final ended in a tie after the match ended with both teams scoring 241 runs, followed by the first Super Over in an ODI; England won the title, their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super Over also finished level. The total attendance throughout the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was 752,000.\nOverall, videos of the group stages amassed over 2.6 billion views from around the world, making it the most-watched cricket competition \nHosting.\nThe hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales withdrew their bid to host the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which was played in Australia and New Zealand. It was the fifth Cricket World Cup played in England, following the 1975, 1979, 1983 and 1999 World Cups. Wales also hosted matches at the 1983 and 1999 tournaments, the latter also seeing matches played in Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands.\nQualification.\nThe 2019 World Cup featured 10 teams, a decrease from previous World Cups in 2011 and 2015, which each featured 14 teams. The hosts (England) and the top seven other teams in the ICC One Day International rankings on 30 September 2017 earned an automatic qualification. Results from 19 September 2017 confirmed that these teams were Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka. The remaining two spots were decided by the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.\nAt the time of the announcement of the qualification structure, ICC Associate and Affiliate Members, who were guaranteed four spots in the previous two World Cup tournaments, could now only be represented by at most two teams, and possibly none at all if they were beaten by the lowest-ranked Full Members in the Qualifier. It also meant that at least two of the ten Test-playing nations at the time of the announcement would have to play in the qualifying tournament, and could miss the World Cup finals entirely. Thus, this was the first World Cup to be contested without all of the Full Member nations being present.\nThe final stage of the tournament was a \"Super Six\" group, from which the top two teams qualified for the 2019 World Cup. The West Indies were guaranteed a spot after defeating Scotland in the penultimate round. Afghanistan joined them after defeating Ireland in the final over of their match. This was the first time since 1983 that Zimbabwe had failed to qualify for a World Cup. Ireland also missed the competition for the first time since 2007, and, for the first time, no Associate nation participated.\nVenues.\nThe fixture list for the tournament was released on 26 April 2018 after the completion of an ICC meeting in Kolkata, India. London Stadium had been named as a possible venue in the planning stages, and in January 2017, the ICC completed an inspection of the ground, confirming that the pitch dimensions would be compliant with the requirements to host ODI matches. However, when the fixtures were announced, London Stadium was not included as a venue. All of the venues used are in England except for Sophia Gardens, which is in Wales. The final was scheduled for 14 July 2019 at Lord's in London.\nSquads.\nAll the participating teams had to submit the names of their respective World Cup squads by 23 April 2019. The teams were allowed to change players in their 15-man squad anytime up to seven days before the start of the tournament. New Zealand was the first team to announce their World Cup squad. The oldest player of the tournament was South African player Imran Tahir, who was 40 years old, while the youngest was Afghan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman, who was 18.\nMatch officials.\nIn April 2019, the ICC named the officials for the tournament, 16 umpires and six match referees. Ian Gould announced that he would retire as an umpire following the conclusion of the tournament.\nPrize money.\nThe International Cricket Council declared a total prize money pool of US$10 million for the tournament, the same as the 2015 edition. England, the winning team, received US$4,000,000, the runner-up $2,000,000 and the losing semi-finalists $800,000. Teams that did not progress past the league stage received $100,000 and the winner of each league stage match received $40,000.\nWarm-up matches.\nBefore the World Cup, the participating nations competed in 10 warm-up matches, which were played from 24 to 28 May 2019. These matches did not have either One Day International (ODI) status or List A status as teams were allowed to field all 15 members of their squad.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony took place on The Mall in central London during the evening of 29 May 2019, a day before the start of the World Cup. Andrew Flintoff, Paddy McGuinness and Shibani Dandekar hosted the event. Prior to the opening ceremony, the 10 captains met at Buckingham Palace where they were greeted by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Harry. A 60-second challenge took place among the 10 participating 'teams', with each side represented by two guest figures, including Viv Richards, Anil Kumble, Mahela Jayawardene, Jacques Kallis, Brett Lee, Kevin Pietersen, Farhan Akhtar, Malala Yousafzai, Yohan Blake, Damayanthi Dharsha, Azhar Ali, Abdur Razzak, Jaya Ahsan, James Franklin and Steven Pienaar, while David Boon was the umpire for the game. England won the game by scoring 74 points, and Australia came second with 69 points.\nMichael Clarke, who captained Australia to the title in 2015, took the World Cup trophy to the stage, accompanied by former England spin bowler Graeme Swann. The ceremony concluded with the official World Cup song, \"Stand By\", performed by Loryn and Rudimental.\nGroup stage.\nThe initial stage of the tournament saw the 10 teams grouped together for a single round-robin, in which each team played the other nine once for a total of 45 matches. Teams earned two points for a win and one for a tie or no-result (a minimum of 20 overs per side was needed to constitute a result). Matches in this stage had no reserve day set aside in the event of bad weather. After four games in seven days were rained off and complaints were made about the lack of reserve days, the ICC chief executive, Dave Richardson, said that trying to include reserve days \"would significantly increase the length of the tournament and practically would be extremely complex to deliver\".\nThe top four teams from the group stage progressed to the knockout stage. If teams were tied on points, then the number of wins and then the net run rate was used to separate them. A similar format was previously used in the 1992 Cricket World Cup, though that tournament featured nine teams instead of ten.\nFollowing the 2019 Pulwama attack, several former Indian players and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) called for the boycott of the group match fixture between India and Pakistan. They also wanted to have the Pakistan team banned from playing in the tournament. However, after conducting a board meeting in Dubai, the ICC rejected the BCCI's proposal and confirmed that the scheduled match would go ahead as planned, at Old Trafford in Manchester, despite the ongoing standoff between the two nations.\nSummary.\nWeek 1.\nThe tournament began on 30 May at The Oval in London, between the host nation, England, and South Africa. England batted first and, despite losing their first wicket to the second ball of the tournament, went on to score 311/8, with Ben Stokes top-scoring with 89 runs. South Africa were bowled out for 207, following a collapse of eight wickets for 78 runs, to give England a victory by 104 runs. The next three matches were one-sided: in the first, the West Indies bowled Pakistan out for just 105, which was the lowest score of the tournament. The target of 106 was chased down in only 13.4 overs, the quickest successful run chase in the tournament. The first double-header of the group stage saw comfortable wins for New Zealand and Australia, as they won by 10 and 7 wickets respectively over Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.\nAt The Oval, in the fifth match of the group stage, Bangladesh made their highest score in an ODI, with 330/6. Mushfiqur Rahim top-scored for Bangladesh with 78, as he and Shakib Al Hasan had a 142-run partnership for the third wicket. In reply, the South Africans could not sustain a partnership with wickets falling regularly throughout their innings. Mustafizur Rahman took three wickets for Bangladesh as South Africa fell short by 22 runs. The following day saw Pakistan cause an upset over one of the tournament favourites, as they beat England by 14 runs at Trent Bridge. This was despite Joe Root (107) and Jos Buttler (103) both scoring centuries in the chase, as they became the first and second batsmen to score hundreds at the tournaments.\nIn Cardiff, three wickets in five balls from Afghanistan's Mohammad Nabi provided the catalyst for a Sri Lankan collapse, as they fell from 144/1 to 201 all out. Kusal Perera top-scored for Sri Lanka with 78, while Nabi took another wicket to finish with four for the innings. After rain reduced Afghanistan's innings to 41 overs, they were unable to reach the revised target of 187 as they lost by 34 runs. Najibullah Zadran top-scored for Afghanistan with 43, while Sri Lanka's Nuwan Pradeep took four wickets. Wednesday saw a double-header being played at the Rose Bowl and The Oval. At the Rose Bowl, India started their campaign with a six-wicket win over South Africa. Yuzvendra Chahal took four wickets as he helped restrict the batsmen to a total of 227. In reply, Rohit Sharma scored 122 not out to help India chase the target with 15 balls to spare. The other match on the Wednesday saw Bangladesh give New Zealand a scare, as the Black Caps went from 160/2 to 191/5 chasing 245, before getting home with three overs to spare. Ross Taylor top-scored for New Zealand with 82, while Matt Henry was the pick of the bowlers with four wickets.\nWeek 2.\nThe second week began with Australia having an early batting collapse to fall to 38/4 in their innings against the West Indies at Nottingham. Half-centuries from Steve Smith and Nathan Coulter-Nile helped Australia recover before they were bowled out for 288. In response, Chris Gayle had two overturned decisions go his way before he was dismissed for 21. Despite a 68 from Shai Hope, Australia won by 15 runs off the back of a five-wicket haul by Mitchell Starc. After the Friday match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Bristol was abandoned due to rain, the Saturday matches were played in nearby Cardiff and Taunton. At Cardiff, Jason Roy made the highest score of the tournament so far, with 153, as he was named man of the match in England's 106-run victory over Bangladesh. In Taunton, a five-wicket haul from Kiwi bowler James Neesham led New Zealand to their third consecutive win, with a seven-wicket victory over Afghanistan.\nThe final completed match of the week saw India defeat Australia by 36 runs at The Oval. Batting first, India targeted Marcus Stoinis and Adam Zampa's bowling with a combined total of 113 runs coming from their 13 overs, as India scored 352/5. Shikhar Dhawan \"(pictured)\" top-scored for India with 117, while Stoinis was the only bowler to take more than one wicket. In the run chase, Australia were behind the required run rate for much of their innings, despite half-centuries from David Warner, Steve Smith and Alex Carey, and were bowled out for 316, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah taking three wickets each. The following two games of the week were washed out. Only 7.2 overs of play was possible in the fixture between South Africa and the West Indies, while the match between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka was abandoned without the toss taking place. The following day at Taunton saw Australia open with a 146-run stand between David Warner and Aaron Finch, with Warner going on to get a century. Pakistan fought back into the innings, with Mohammad Amir taking five wickets, which restricted Australia to 307. In response, Pakistan could not get a partnership established with regular wickets coming from Australia; Pat Cummins finished his 10 overs with figures of 3/33. Sarfaraz Ahmed and Wahab Riaz tried to get Pakistan the victory with a quick-fire 64-run partnership, but it was not enough, with Starc taking two of the final three wickets in the 41-run victory.\nWeek 3.\nAfter a wash-out of the match between India and New Zealand in Nottingham to open up the third week, the fourth wash-out in the World Cup, Joe Root scored his second century of the tournament and took two wickets in England's eight-wicket victory over the West Indies at Southampton. However, the English victory was soured as Jason Roy had to leave the field in the eighth over with hamstring injury that ruled him out of the next two games. South Africa recorded their first win of the tournament at Cardiff against Afghanistan, with Imran Tahir taking four wickets as Afghanistan were bowled out for 125. In reply, South Africa chased down their target for the loss of just one wicket. The other match on Saturday at The Oval saw Aaron Finch and Mitchell Starc guide Australia to an 87-run victory over Sri Lanka that sent them to the top of the table with eight points from five games. The following day saw rivals India and Pakistan face each other at Old Trafford. India scored 336/5 from their 50 overs, which included a man-of-the-match performance of 140 runs from Rohit Sharma. In response, Pakistan got off to a good start and were 117/1 at one stage before Kuldeep Yadav took two wickets in three balls to turn the tide for India, helping them to an 89-run victory via the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method.\nMonday saw Bangladesh beat the West Indies by seven wickets at the County Ground in Taunton. In the West Indies' innings, Shai Hope top-scored with 96 runs from 121 balls as he and Evin Lewis (70) got the West Indies to 321/8 from their 50 overs. In the run chase, Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan scored 124 from 99 balls as aided Bangladesh in chasing the target of 322 and recording Bangladesh's highest successful run chase in their ODI history. At Manchester, Eoin Morgan hit 17 sixes, a new world record in ODIs, as he top-scored for England with 148, leading the hosts to a total of 397/6, the highest total of the tournament. Afghanistan's Rashid Khan conceded 110 runs without taking any wickets, the most expensive bowling spell in Cricket World Cup history, and the second-most expensive of all time. Hashmatullah Shahidi managed 76 in response for Afghanistan, but they were always behind the required rate and fell 151 runs short, managing 247 from their 50 overs. Wednesday saw South Africa taking on New Zealand at Edgbaston. With the match reduced to 49 overs each due to a wet outfield, South Africa posted a total of 241/6 with some late hitting from Rassie van der Dussen, who was unbeaten on 67, while Lockie Ferguson was the best of the bowlers with three wickets. In response, New Zealand were 137/5 at one stage, before a partnership from Kane Williamson (who went on to score a century) and Colin de Grandhomme guided New Zealand to their fourth victory of the tournament.\nWeek 4.\nWeek four saw David Warner score 166, the highest individual score of the tournament, as Australia's total of 381/5 proved out of reach for Bangladesh, despite Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim getting them within 48 runs of the target. Friday saw Lasith Malinga dismantle the English top order, as his four wickets helped Sri Lanka defend a total of 232 for their second win of the tournament. Despite the best efforts of Stokes, who was left stranded on 82 not out, England fell 21 short. Angelo Mathews top-scored for the Sri Lankans with an unbeaten 85, while Mark Wood was the best of the English bowlers with 3/40. The Saturday games saw the first elimination of the tournament, with Afghanistan's loss to India at Southampton meaning they could no longer qualify for the knockout stage. Despite limiting India to 224 from their 50 overs, a Mohammed Shami hat-trick saw Afghanistan fall 12 runs short. The other match on the Saturday saw a close game between New Zealand and the West Indies at Manchester. After New Zealand scored 291/8, including 148 from Kane Williamson, they had the West Indies reeling at 164/7 after 27 overs. The momentum, though, was swung to the West Indies, with Carlos Brathwaite making 101 (including five sixes and nine fours) as he led them to within six runs of the target; however, his attempt to finish off the game with a six saw him caught by Trent Boult at long on, as New Zealand won by five runs.\nThe following day saw South Africa eliminated from the World Cup after an 89-run performance from Haris Sohail got Pakistan to 308/7 before Shadab Khan took three wickets in the South African run chase to give Pakistan a 49-run victory. Monday saw Bangladesh record their third win of the tournament; a 62-run victory over Afghanistan at the Rose Bowl. The match also saw Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan become the second player in World Cup history to take five wickets and score a half-century in the same match. Australia became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals as a century from Aaron Finch, a five-wicket haul from Jason Behrendorff and another four from Mitchell Starc guided them to a 64-run victory over England at Lord's, with only Stokes (89) showing any resistance to Australia's bowling. The result left England needing to win both of their remaining two games to guarantee qualification for the semi-finals. Pakistan caused New Zealand's first loss of the World Cup at Edgbaston with a Babar Azam century guiding them to a victory by six wickets.\nWeek 5.\nThe fifth week of the tournament started with India defeating the West Indies by 125 runs at Old Trafford, with Mohammed Shami taking four wickets as they bowled the West Indies out for 143. The result also knocked the West Indies out of the World Cup. The following day saw play suspended in the match between South Africa and Sri Lanka when bees swarmed the Riverside Ground pitch. Faf du Plessis and Hashim Amla led the run chase with a partnership of 175 runs, taking South Africa to a nine-wicket victory. Saturday saw two matches played. At Lord's, Starc became the first player to take three five-wicket hauls at a World Cup as he guided Australia to an 86-run victory over New Zealand. This was after Australia were 92/5 in the 22nd over before a century partnership between Usman Khawaja and Alex Carey got the total to 243/9. New Zealand managed 157 in response, with Kane Williamson top-scoring with 40. The other match, played at Headingley, saw Afghanistan set 227 against Pakistan, with Shaheen Afridi taking four wickets. The run chase got off to a shaky start with Fakhar Zaman getting out LBW to Mujeeb Ur Rahman for a duck from the second ball of the innings. Babar Azam and Imam-ul-Haq made a partnership of 72, but Pakistan's progress was once again throttled by regular wickets, leaving them needing 46 runs from the last five overs. Imad Wasim immediately hit 18 runs in the 46th over, and despite losing Shadab Khan to a run out in the 47th, Wasim and Wahab Riaz saw Pakistan home to a three-wicket victory with two balls to spare.\nThe return of opener Jason Roy from injury helped England escape their slump as they emerged victorious by 31 runs against the hitherto unbeaten India in a crucial must-win game for the hosts. An opening partnership between Roy (66) and Jonny Bairstow (111) was the key factor in the victory, while Stokes scored 79 runs off 54 balls for his third consecutive half-century, to help England reach 337/7. The score proved too much for India, despite Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli scoring 102 and 66 respectively, while the returning England bowler Liam Plunkett took 3/55. Sri Lanka won the dead rubber against the West Indies at Chester-le-Street, where both Avishka Fernando and Nicholas Pooran scored their maiden ODI centuries. Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan made history against India, as he became the first man to score 500 runs and take 10 wickets in a single World Cup. This performance was not enough, though, with a Rohit Sharma century leading India into the semi-finals at their opponents' expense.\nWeek 6.\nThe final round started with England taking on New Zealand, with the winner guaranteed a semi-final position. Another Jonny Bairstow hundred saw England win by 119 runs and qualify for the semi-finals for the first time since 1992. After the West Indies won the dead rubber against Afghanistan at Leeds, Pakistan needed to win their final match against Bangladesh by a record margin of over 300 runs at Lord's. They won, but only by 94 runs, allowing New Zealand to take the fourth and final semi-final berth. The match saw Pakistan's Shaheen Afridi, aged , become the youngest player to take a five-wicket haul at a Cricket World Cup with the tournament's best bowling figures of 6/35. Despite Bangladesh losing the match, Shakib Al Hasan finished his tournament with 606 runs, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar's record for the most runs in the group stage of a World Cup. Shakib's record would very soon be surpassed by Rohit Sharma and David Warner by the end of the group stage, with former top-scoring in the group stage with 647 runs.\nThe final two matches of the group stage were played on the Saturday to determine who would finish top of the group. At Leeds, India cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka off the back of centuries from K. L. Rahul and Rohit Sharma as they chased down a target of 265 runs. This was Sharma's fifth century of the tournament, the most in a single World Cup. Angelo Mathews scored his third ODI century for Sri Lanka, all of which had come against India. With South Africa defeating Australia by 10 runs, India finished top of the table, sending Australia to a semi-final against England. A century from Faf du Plessis and a further 95 from Rassie van der Dussen saw South Africa set the Australians a target of 326. In response, Australia lost Usman Khawaja early on to a hamstring injury; he later returned but was dismissed for 18, before being ruled out for the rest of the tournament. David Warner scored 122, his third century of the tournament, and Alex Carey scored a career-best 85 but crucial wickets in the middle of the innings gave South Africa the victory.\nFixtures.\nThe ICC released the fixture details on 26 April 2018.\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage started with semi-finals at Old Trafford and Edgbaston, the winners of each progressing to the final at Lord's. All three knockout games were allotted a reserve day. If a reserve day came into play, the match would not be restarted but instead resumed from the previous day's play, if there was any. In the event of no play on the scheduled day or the reserve day, in the semi-finals, the team that finished higher in the group stage progressed to the final, and if no play were possible in the final, the trophy would be shared. If any match ended in a tie, a Super Over would be used to determine the winner. If the scores in the Super Over were also tied, the winner would be determined by the two teams' overall boundary count, including both the match itself and the Super Over.\nOn 25 June 2019, Australia became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals after beating England at Lord's. India became the second team to qualify after they defeated Bangladesh at Edgbaston on 2 July 2019. The following day saw tournament hosts England become the third team to qualify after they beat New Zealand at the Riverside Ground. After Pakistan were unable to increase their net run rate sufficiently enough in their match against Bangladesh at Lord's New Zealand were the fourth and final team to qualify for the semi-finals.\nThe first semi-final was played between India and New Zealand at Old Trafford, while the second semi-final was played between Australia and England at Edgbaston.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first semi-final between India and New Zealand was played at Old Trafford in Manchester. Batting first, New Zealand lost opener Martin Guptill in the fourth over, having scored just one run. However, the Indians found wickets hard to come by after that, as Kane Williamson combined with Henry Nicholls and Ross Taylor for partnerships of 68 and 65 respectively. Williamson managed 67 runs before he was the third man out in the 36th over, a score matched by Taylor when rain stopped play in the 47th over with New Zealand at 211/5 following the wickets of Neesham and De Grandhomme. No further play was possible on the day, so the match went into its reserve day. Taylor managed another seven runs to top-score for the Kiwis, who managed to get the score to 239/8 at the end of their 50 overs. The Indian chase got off to a poor start with India falling to 5/3 in the fourth over, with the top three batsmen all going for one run each, then 24/4 after 10 overs. After a small partnership of 47 runs for the fifth wicket between Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja was joined by MS Dhoni for a century partnership for the seventh wicket that left India needing 37 runs from the final three overs. This game turned out to be MS Dhoni's final game for India, he retired from all formats in August 2020. Once Dhoni had gone (run out), a late-order collapse saw New Zealand take the last four wickets for just 13 runs, sending them into their second consecutive World Cup final.\nThe second semi-final saw England take on Australia at Edgbaston. Australia took the unusual move of walking barefoot around the pitch before the match in a bid to create \"positive energy\". Australia won the toss and chose to bat first, but lost three of their top four batsmen for single-figure scores, two of them to Chris Woakes, to reduce them to 14/3 into the seventh over. Wicket-keeper Alex Carey was promoted up the order due to his recent form, and, after getting his helmet knocked off by a Jofra Archer bouncer, he scored 46 before being caught by Adil Rashid. As wickets continued to tumble at the other end, Steve Smith held his wicket to top-score with 85 as Australia were bowled out for 223 with Woakes and Rashid being the best of the bowlers with three wickets apiece. England took their time to get going in the run chase but were soon making progress, reaching 124 before Jonny Bairstow was trapped LBW by Starc for the first wicket. Quick-hitting Jason Roy went two overs later to a controversial decision, caught behind off a bouncer that appeared not to touch his bat, but England had already used their review on Bairstow's wicket, and Roy departed for 85 off 65 balls, including five sixes. Nevertheless, England were well over halfway to their target by this point, and an unbroken partnership of 79 between Joe Root and captain Eoin Morgan saw them home to an eight-wicket victory and their first World Cup final since 1992.\nFinal.\nAfter New Zealand won the toss and chose to bat first, Henry Nicholls' first half-century of the tournament and a further 47 from wicket-keeper Tom Latham helped the Kiwis to a total of 241/8 from their 50 overs, as Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett each secured three wickets for the hosts. Defending a middling score, the New Zealand bowlers bowled effectively, hampering England's top order, with only Jonny Bairstow managing more than a start with 36. With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over, however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught on 59. However, with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs, and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two dot balls, Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder's throw deflected off Stokes' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, although one interpretation of \"Laws of Cricket\" was that it should have resulted in only five runs being awarded as one of the runs should have not counted as the batsmen had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in. The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84.\nWith the scores tied, the match went to a Super Over. England returned Stokes and Buttler to the crease, and they handled Trent Boult's bowling to accumulate 15 runs without loss. For New Zealand, Martin Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim the title. After a steady accumulation of runs, including a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery, Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs to tie the Super Over, but England's superior boundary count in the match and Super Over combined (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title for the first time after three previous final defeats in 1979, 1987 and 1992. This game has gone down in history as one of the greatest ever finals, and games, in cricketing history. Ben Stokes was named man of the match; referring to the controversial overthrows that deflected off his bat, he said he would be \"apologising to [New Zealand captain Kane Williamson] for the rest of [his] life\", and later said England's first World Cup victory was \"written in the stars\".\nStatistics.\nIndia's Rohit Sharma ended the tournament as the leading run scorer with 648 runs from nine matches which featured a 140 against Pakistan at Old Trafford. He finished ahead of Australia's David Warner (647 runs) and Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan (606 runs). Australian bowler Mitchell Starc ended up as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets, which surpassed the record set by Glenn McGrath in 2007. Second was Lockie Ferguson from New Zealand with 21 wickets, while Mustafizur Rahman (Bangladesh) and Jofra Archer (England) were tied for third place with 20 wickets.\nTeam of the tournament.\nThe ICC announced its team of the tournament on 15 July 2019 with Kane Williamson being named as player of the tournament and captain of the team.\nBroadcasting.\nThe ICC agreed deals for broadcast and digital distribution on a range of platforms, including television, radio and online streaming. The in-house ICC TV served as host broadcasters of the world feed, in collaboration with Sunset+Vine (as part of a new long-term agreement covering all ICC events, excluding the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup in India).\nIn the United Kingdom, live coverage of the tournament was exclusive to pay television service Sky Sports, with free-to-air highlights packages sub-licensed to Channel 4. Sky later agreed to sub-license a simulcast of the final to Channel 4 if England reached the final. Sky Sport (New Zealand) also decided to air the final on its co-owned free-to-air channel Prime.\nHotstar held digital rights to the tournament in India and several other markets. Hotstar surpassed 100 million daily users during the group match between India and Pakistan, and reached a record 25.3 million concurrent viewers during the semi-final between India and New Zealand.\nIn popular culture.\nAn Australian docu-series - The Test was produced, following the Australian national cricket team in the aftermath of the Australian ball tampering scandal. The sixth episode of Season 1 featured Australia at the tournament."

        "title": "John Chavis (American football)",
        "text": "Johnny Chavis (born October 16, 1956), nicknamed \"The Chief\", is an American football coach who is the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach for the Birmingham Stallions of the United Football League (UFL). He previously served as defensive coordinator for the Arkansas Razorbacks football team and former defensive coordinator, linebacker coach, and associate head coach at the Tennessee Volunteers football, LSU Tigers football, and Texas A&amp;M Aggies football programs.\nPlaying career.\nChavis joined Tennessee's football squad as a walk-on defensive lineman. He played sparingly in 1976, picking up two tackles. He delivered an explosive performance in the 1977 Orange-and-White Game, and briefly pushed future All-SEC lineman Jim Noonan for the starting spot at middle guard. Playing as a backup to Noonan, Chavis registered 40 tackles (26 solo) and two sacks, and was awarded a scholarship at the end of the year. Prior to the 1978 season (his senior year), Chavis switched to defensive tackle, and was vaulted into the starting slot after Bill Christian suffered a season-ending knee injury. He finished the year with 32 tackles (19 solo).\nDuring his playing career at UT, Chavis had 74 tackles (46 solo) and two sacks. He lettered in 1977 and 1978 and received his degree from the College of Education in 1979. He was initially served by coach Bill Battle, but spent his final two seasons served by Battle's replacement, Johnny Majors. His position coach was former Atlanta Falcons lineman Jim Dyar.\nChavis is a native of Dillon, South Carolina. He played high school football at Dillon High School under long-time coach Paul Chapman.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nBefore returning to Tennessee (where he had briefly been a graduate assistant), Chavis had been defensive coordinator at Alabama A&amp;M, a historically Black university. There he led the defense of the Division II school to the best defensive record in the nation. The Bulldogs ranked first in total defense in 1987 and 1988.\nBefore taking the defensive coordinator job at Alabama A&amp;M, Chavis coached as a graduate assistant at Tennessee in 1979, as defensive line coach at Alabama A&amp;M from 1980 to 1983 and then as defensive line coach and defensive coordinator at Alabama State in 1984–85.\nTennessee.\nChavis returned to Tennessee in 1989 as defensive line and linebackers coach under his former college coach, Johnny Majors. He was promoted to defensive coordinator under Majors' successor, Phillip Fulmer, in 1995. Under Chavis' watch, Tennessee gained a reputation for fielding some of the stingiest defenses in the nation.\nFollowing the national championship season of 1998, Chavis was named the SEC's outstanding linebacker coach. Tennessee's defense led the SEC in 1996 and ranked in the top three five of the past seven years.\nIn addition to supervising linebackers and the overall defense, Chavis in 1999 was named assistant head coach.\nFollowing the 2006 season, Chavis was named as the Assistant Football Coach of the Year by the American Football Coaches Association.\nChavis and other members of the staff saw increased pressure after a slow start to the 2007 season, including double-digit losses to California and Florida. Yet, the 2007 Tennessee team competed in the SEC Championship game against an LSU team that won the National Championship that year.\nIn that SEC Championship game against LSU, the final score was 21 to 14, with 7 of LSU's points coming from an interception return for a touchdown. A year later Les Miles reached out to Chavis to become the defensive coordinator for LSU largely due to how impressed Miles was with Chief's defensive performance at the SEC Championship game.\nChavis' career at Tennessee came to an end in the 2008 season. Following a 3–6 start and a loss to Steve Spurrier and South Carolina, Phillip Fulmer announced the following Monday that he, at the University's decision, would step down as head coach. Fulmer's resignation would ultimately oust Chavis as defensive coordinator. Chavis' final three games would bring confidence but major disappointment to his final days with Tennessee, starting with an embarrassing 13–7 loss to Wyoming which would keep Tennessee from making a bowl for the second time in four years. Though disappointing, Wyoming only had to move the ball 7 yards for those two scoring drives. Remarkably, Chavis' 2008 defense finished 3rd nationally and 1st in the SEC in Total Defense despite the 2008 Tennessee Total Offense ranking of 115th. Chavis would win his final game at Tennessee against the University of Kentucky, 28–10, continuing a 24-game win streak against the Wildcats.\n\"I look at their defense. Coach Chavis, he's done a great job for a long time.\" – Charlie Weis (Notre Dame Head Coach).\nLSU.\nOn January 5, 2009, Chavis was named the defensive coordinator at LSU. While with the Tigers, his defenses were consistently ranked among the nation's best.\nThe 2011 LSU team finished the regular season undefeated which included a 9–6 overtime victory over Alabama. LSU played in the 2011 national championship game.\nChief was the recipient of the 2011 Broyles Award as the best assistant coach in college football.\nAs of 2013, Chavis has seen 19 players that he's coached at LSU selected in the NFL draft, including five in the first round.\nTexas A&amp;M.\nThe day of LSU's 2014 Music City Bowl loss to Notre Dame, Chavis turned down a three-year, $5.4 million offer from Les Miles. That same day, it was reported that Chavis had accepted an offer from Texas A&amp;M to take their then vacant defensive coordinator position. He officially signed a contract to accept the position on February 12, 2015, which guaranteed him $1.5 million in 2015, $1.55 million in 2016 and $1.6 million in 2017, not including potential bonuses.\nAfter the 2017 season, Texas A&amp;M fired head coach Kevin Sumlin, and hired Florida State head coach Jimbo Fisher. Fisher did not retain Chavis as defensive coordinator, instead hiring Mike Elko away from Notre Dame.\nArkansas.\nIn January 2018, Chavis was hired to be the defensive coordinator for the Arkansas Razorbacks, under new head coach Chad Morris. Chavis was terminated for convenience following the 2019 season with a $1.25 million buyout.\nBirmingham Stallions.\nIn March 2022, it was announced that Chavis would be joining Skip Holtz's staff as the defensive coordinator for the Birmingham Stallions.\nFamily.\nChavis and his wife, Diane Crisp Chavis, are the parents of two sons, C. John Chavis (age ) and Jason Chavis (age )."

        "text": "The 2006 Giro d'Italia was the 89th edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It began in the Belgian city of Seraing with a individual time trial. The race came to a close with a mass-start road stage that stretched from Museo del Ghisallo to Milan. Twenty two teams entered the race that was won by the Italian Ivan Basso of the team. Second and third were the Spain José Enrique Gutiérrez and Italian Gilberto Simoni.\nBasso, riding for , won the Giro in dominant fashion. Basso won three individual stages, as well as the team time trial, along with his fellow Team CSC riders, and won the overall classification by more than 9 minutes over the next best rider, the largest margin of victory in a Grand Tour in the last three years.\nIn the other classifications that the race awarded, Paolo Bettini of the team won the points classification, Quick Step-Innergetic rider Juan Manuel Gárate won the mountains classification, and Paolo Savoldelli of the won the combination classification. finished as the winners of the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" classification, ranking each of the twenty-two teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. The other team classification, the \"Trofeo Super Team\" classification, where the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team was also won by Phonak.\nTeams.\nTwenty-two teams contested the 2006 Giro. Since it was a UCI ProTour event, the 20 ProTour teams were automatically invited and obligated to send a squad. Race officials also invited two other teams. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, giving the race a 198-man peloton at its outset.\nThe 22 that competed in the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe 2006 Giro opened, and had its first 4 stages in the South-East of Belgium in the Wallonia region. The Giro organisers chose to locate the opening in this region as a homage to the thousands of Italians who moved to the region following the end of World War II in order to find jobs in the coal mines of the area. It is estimated that as many as 300'000 Belgians of Italian origin live in this area. The 2006 Giro commemorated the deaths of 136 Italian miners who died in the 1956 Bois du Cazier mine disaster.\nThe race introduced a team time trial stage upon its arrival in Italy. This discipline had been absent from the Giro since edition 1989. It also included of individual time trials, distributed between the prologue and the long time trial at Pontedera.\nIt also featured famous climbs, such as the steep Mortirolo and the Monte Bondone. There were plans to visit Plan de Corones for the first time; however, bad weather prevented the unpaved climb from being used. It instead saw its debut in the Giro d'Italia in 2008.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2006 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point less per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, some points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized, either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the \"Cima Coppi\"), which in 2006 was the Passo di Gavia in stage 20, afforded still more points than the other first-category climbs.\nThe fourth was the combination classification, which awarded a blue jersey. In the combination classification, the top 15 placed riders each day in the general, points, mountains, and 110 Gazzetta classifications earned points, 15 for first and one point less per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. These points were tallied throughout the Giro.\nThere were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage are added, and the team with the lowest time is leading team. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. Other awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Italian Paolo Bettini won the Most Combative classification. Bettini also won the 110 Gazzetta classification. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. Ivan Basso won the Azzurri d'Italia classification. The \"Trofeo Fuga Piaggio\" classification rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. The classification was won by Christophe Edaleine. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. were most successful in avoiding penalties, and so won the Fair Play classification."

        "title": "Slider (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, a slider is a type of delivery bowled by a wrist spin bowler. While a topspinner is released with the thumb facing the batter, a slider is bowled in a similar manner to a legbreak, but instead of imparting sidespin with the third finger, the bowler allows his fingers to roll down the back of the ball, providing a mixture of sidespin and backspin. Whereas a topspinner tends to dip more quickly and bounce higher than a normal delivery, a slider does the opposite: it carries to a fuller length and bounces less than the batter might expect. The sliders will typically head towards the batter with a scrambled seam (with the ball not spinning in the direction of the seam, so the seam direction is not constant, unlike in conventional spin bowling). This has less effect on the flight and bounce but absence of leg spin may deceive the batter. Frequently the slider is bowled with a mixture of side spin and backspin. This has the effect of making the ball harder to differentiate from the leg break for the batters without reducing the mechanical effects caused by the backspin. This delivery may skid straight on or it may turn a small amount.\nIt is claimed that Shane Warne invented this type of delivery. However, this is inaccurate. The Australian spinner Peter Philpott used the technique in the 1960s, calling it simply an orthodox backspinner, while Australian all-rounder and captain Richie Benaud used what he called his 'sliding topspinner' which appears again to have been similar. Since he was taught the technique by Doug Ring, it may be more accurate to suggest that Ring is the originator. Either that, or the ball is one of those deliveries with no easily identifiable point of origin. However Shane Warne's use of the delivery in the 2005 Ashes brought the variation once more into the public consciousness. His dismissal of Ian Bell lbw with the delivery was a classic piece of spin bowling; Bell played for the turn of a normal leg break, but the delivery skidded straight into his front pad without turning.\nAlthough there is often a good deal of confusion on the subject, the slider is thought to be more or less an identical delivery to the \"zooter\".\nFinger spin bowlers, like Ravindra Jadeja, commonly bowl an exactly equivalent ball, which comes out of the front of the hand with backspin present. However the name slider has not passed over into common parlance for its offspin cousin, and the terms arm ball, backspinner or, more recently, teesra are used instead."

        "title": "Los Angeles Tennis Club",
        "text": "The Los Angeles Tennis Club (LATC) is a private tennis club opened in 1920 that was the host of the Pacific Southwest Championships from 1927 until 1974 and 1980 until 1983. It is located at 5851 Clinton Street, between Wilcox and Rossmore, one block south of Melrose Avenue. It is currently the home of the Southern California Championships.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1920 and Thomas C. Bundy was elected as its first president.\nPerry T. Jones was a major fundraiser and took control of Southern California tennis in 1930. He set up his office at the Club with his loyal Secretary, Doris Cooke, and made it famous through his junior development patrons network. It reached from Santa Barbara to San Diego and came together at the LATC to produce a steady stream of world-class tennis players. dubbed \"the cradle of tennis.\" Jones believed in schooling, cleanliness, proper attire, and sportsmanship when helping players develop into champions. He became Davis Cup Captain in 1958, recruited, mentored, and named Alex Olmedo to the team, that included Barry MacKay and Ham Richardson, and won the Davis Cup from Australia, that year. Jack Kramer and Pancho Gonzales acted as advisors to Jones. Jones was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1970. He established the Southern California Tennis Association (SCTA) Hall of Fame in 1968, and was known as \"Mr. Tennis of the West Coast\".\nFrom the 1930s through the early 1970s, the LATC was the center of development for world-class players in the United States. In 1930, Perry T. Jones, became President of the Southern California Tennis Association and the Director of the Southern California Championships and Pacific Southwest Tennis Championships. Bill Tilden was the first winner of the Pacific Southwest tournament in 1927. Jones designed what he termed \"The Factory System\" that utilized Tennis Patrons in San Diego, Long Beach, Pasadena, Beverly Hills, and Santa Monica, such as: Harper Ink, Charles Lane, Dr. Ben Parks, Jack Lynch, Bob Martin, and Helen Roark; and Tennis Teachers: Mercer Beasley, Esther Bartosh, Ben Press, Clyde Walker, Wilbur Folsom, Dick Skeen, Pancho Segura, Carl Earn, Eleanor Tennant, Linda Crosby, Vic Braden, Myron McNamara, and Robert Lansdorp to identify and funnel top-flight junior players to his attention, so he could make them champions with funding, top competition, and tournaments, such as: Ellsworth Vines, Gene Mako, Jack Tidball, Jack Kramer, Joe Hunt, Pauline Betz, Bobby Riggs, Bob Falkenburg, Pancho Gonzales, Ted Schroeder, Joe Hunt, Dave Freeman, Budge Patty, Dodo Cheney, Herb Flam, Hugh Stewart, Pat Yeomans, Gussie Moran, Louise Brough, Maureen Connolly, Beverly Baker, Alex Olmedo, Darlene Hard, Billie Jean King, Sally Moore, Karen Hantze, Mike Franks, Bill Bond, Rafael Osuna, Dennis Ralston, Jon Douglas, Allen Fox, Stan Smith, Charlie Pasarell, Bob Lutz, and many others. Jack Kramer writes in his autobiography in 1979, that \"if you wanted top competition, you had to play at the LATC — especially since there were many fewer tournaments then and practice was the vogue.\" Jones was a strong-willed autocrat who excluded the young Pancho Gonzales from the Club because of his school truancy. He sometimes would not sponsor Bobby Riggs for Eastern Tournaments. He also achieved notoriety for excluding a 12-year-old Billie Jean King from a group photo at the Club, because she was wearing shorts instead of a tennis dress.\nIn 1952, Angela Buxton, who in 1956 won competitions at Wimbledon and the French Championships, encountered anti-Semitism at the club. \"They told me I couldn't play because I was Jewish,\" she said. She trained elsewhere, and had the opportunity to work with Bill Tilden.\nWhen he was still a teenage player, Kramer writes, he could \"get matches against Ellsworth Vines, Bill Tilden, Bobby Riggs, Gene Mako, Joe Hunt, Ted Schroeder, Jack Tidball, Frank Shields, and – often as not – the players on the UCLA and University of Southern California teams. George Toley won 10 NCAA Team Titles as Coach of USC, and was the Teaching Professional at the Club. Sidney Wood would come in for long periods from the East, and Frank Kovacs from Northern California.\" \"Big Bill\" Tilden, the dominant player of the 1920s and the leading gate attraction of the 1930s, was a Philadelphian, who spent much of his time in Los Angeles and at the LATC, playing matches in the morning and Bridge in the afternoon.\nFor five decades, the Pacific Southwest Championships, open only to amateurs until 1968, and played at the LATC, was the second most prestigious American tennis tournament after the US Championships in New York. In preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics, Leonard Strauss, an LATC member and Chairman of Thrifty Drug Stores, spearheaded construction of a new 5,800 seat Tennis Stadium on the UCLA Campus, which then hosted Southern California's major annual professional tennis event, the Pacific Southwest.\nToday.\nThe LATC remains an important tournament, recreation, and community resource for Los Angeles and its Hancock Park community. Owned by 360 equity members, the LATC provides 16 tennis courts along with pool, gym, dining, and bar facilities to its 400 members and their families and guests. The LATC continues to host several amateur, collegiate, and charity tournaments. It is a practice venue for the Loyola High and Marlborough School tennis teams.\nAs of 2017 the fee for new equity memberships is $25,000, not including quarterly and monthly dues, and new applicants undergo a lengthy acceptance process that can take several months and require direct approval of the Board."

        "text": "Kevin Brooks (born October 12, 1969) is an American professional basketball coach and former player. Born in Beaufort, South Carolina, Brooks is a graduate of White Castle High School in White Castle, Louisiana and graduated from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then named the University of Southwestern Louisiana.\nCareer.\nNBA.\nBrooks was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round as the 18th pick of the 1991 NBA draft. Traded to the Denver Nuggets, he played 126 games in three seasons from 1991 to 1994, averaging 3.3 points, 1.1 rebounds and 0.4 assists per game.\nNBL.\nWith the Adelaide 36ers looking for a second import player for the 1998 NBL season, Brooks' friend and former Nuggets teammate Darnell Mee recommended him to the 36ers and they signed the former Nuggets forward to play for two seasons. After his first training session with the team, Brooks' teammates thought he would not last a week in the NBL with his shooting style that saw him release the ball almost from behind his head. However, they soon found Brooks was for real when he scored 20 points in his debut NBL game against the Townsville Suns before going on to average 19.1 points, 6.7 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 31 games. Under the rookie coaching of Australian basketball legend Phil Smyth, and with others such as Darnell Mee, team captain and 1996 Olympian Brett Maher, former Perth Wildcats championship forward Martin Cattalini, centre Paul Rees and veteran forward Mark Davis, Brooks went on to win back-to-back championships in 1998 and 1999. Brooks was named the NBL Grand Final MVP in 1998 during the 36ers 2–0 sweep of the South East Melbourne Magic, averaging 22.5 points, 7 rebounds, 1.5 blocks and 1.5 assists over the series.\nWith largely the same team as in 1998, Brooks and the 36ers became back to back champions by winning the 1998–99 Grand Final series 2–1 over the Victoria Titans (the NBL changed from a winter to summer season at the conclusion of the 1998 season). In his second season in Australia, Brooks continued his good form averaging 17.3 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 33 games and was named in the All-NBL First Team. In 98 games for the 36ers (1998–99 and 2000–01) Brooks averaged 18.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 98 games with the 36ers.\nIn 1999–2000, the NBL refused to let Adelaide register Brooks as it was believed doing so would put the 36ers over the leagues salary cap. Instead Brooks played for the Sydney Kings. While he impressed for the Kings under the coaching of Brett Brown, Brooks never seemed settled and at the end of the season returned to the 36ers for 2000–01. After the team reached the Semi-finals, Brooks was off to Södertälje BBK in Sweden for a season before returning down under, this time to New Zealand when he joined the Wellington Saints for 2002.\nBrooks then moved to back to the NBL and the Newcastle based Hunter Pirates in 2003–04. In his international career, Brooks has competed in France, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Sweden &amp; New Zealand.\nCoaching.\nBrooks started his managerial career as head coach of the Australian Basketball Association Woodville Warriors in Adelaide where in his inaugural year, led the Warriors to the 2005 ABA championship. In June 2005 he joined the Stamford Grand Basketball Academy in Adelaide, South Australia as first an assistant coach and then head coach the following season, training a future player-base for the 36ers.\nShortly thereafter, Brooks accepted the position of 2nd assistant coach with his former team, the Adelaide 36ers in the NBL. The following season, he became the 1st assistant coach with the Wollongong Hawks for the next two years. He was also the head coach of his former New Zealand NBL team the Wellington Saints in 2007.\nBrooks is currently the Executive Producer and Analyst of a weekly live, internet basketball show on Australia Live TV entitled, \"Inside the Game\", as well as assistant coach for the Pembroke School and head coach at St Paul's College (based in Adelaide) basketball teams. In 2017, Brooks became the head coach of the Nazareth Catholic College basketball program.\nOn 21 May 2013, Brooks signed with the Adelaide 36ers as one of the 2013–14 assistant coaches to new head coach Joey Wright, returning for his second assistant coaching stint with the club. Under Wright, the 36ers went from the bottom of the league in 2012–13, to Grand Finalists in 2013–14. He served as Wright's assistant coach with the 36ers until Wright's departure in 2020. Brooks had been backed by Wright as his successor but lost the role to Conner Henry after an unsuccessful attempt at the role."

        "text": "The 1978 World Snooker Championship (officially known as the 1978 Embassy World Snooker Championship) was a professional ranking snooker tournament that took place between 17 and 29 April 1978 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, the second consecutive year the tournament had been held at the venue. A qualifying competition was held at Romiley Forum, Stockport, from 27 March to 7April. The tournament was promoted by Mike Watterson on behalf of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. It had a total prize fund of £24,000, of which £7,500 went to the champion.\nJohn Spencer was the defending champion, having won the 1977 event by defeating Cliff Thorburn 25–21 in the final. Spencer lost 8–13 in the first round to Perrie Mans. The final was contested by Mans and Ray Reardon. Reardon led 5–2 after the first session, before Mans levelled the match at 8–8 after the first day's play. After the third interval Reardon led 12–11 and won the 24th frame with a 64 break to lead 13–11. After the second day, Reardon led 18–14, and eventually won the match 25–18 to secure his sixth and last world title. Aged 45 years and 203 days, Reardon became the oldest world champion in the sport's history, a record that stood for 44 years until Ronnie O'Sullivan won his seventh world title at the 2022 event, aged 46 years and 148 days. The tournament was sponsored by cigarette company Embassy. It was the first snooker world championship tournament to be broadcast in depth by the BBC.\nBackground.\nThe cue sport of snooker was founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Joe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, hosted by the Billiards Association and Control Council, the final match being held at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England' The sport's popularity in the United Kingddom grew after this.\nThe 1978 championship featured sixteen professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single-elimination format, each match played over several . These competitors in the main tournament were selected using a combination of the top players in the snooker world rankings and the winners of a pre-tournament qualification stage. The tournament was promoted by Mike Watterson on behalf of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. It was sponsored by cigarette brand Embassy for the third consecutive year. It was the first championship to have daily BBC coverage throughout the main event.\nFormat.\nThe 1978 World Snooker Championship main tournament took place between 17 and 20April 1978 at the Crucible Theatre. The top eight players from that season's world rankings, calculated from performances at the championship in the previous three years, were seeded into the first round, where they each faced an opponent from the qualifying competition, which was held across two rounds at Romiley Forum, Stockport, from 27 March to 7April. It was the second time that the event was staged at the Crucible, which as of 2023 has remained the venue for the annual tournament.\nDefending champion John Spencer, who had defeated Cliff Thorburn 25–21 in the 1977 final, was the top seed, and top-ranked Ray Reardon was the second seed. \nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below: \nTournament summary.\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying competition was held across two rounds at Romiley Forum, Stockport, from 27 March to 7April. Matches were played as the best of 17 frames, across two . In the preliminary round, Maurice Parkin defeated Bernard Bennett 9–4, in a match where the highest break was just 31. The report in \"Snooker Scene\" magazine concluded that \"the standard of play was not really appropriate to a world championship\". Jack Karnehm was whitewashed 9–0 by Roy Andrewartha. It was the third time that Karnehm had entered the championship, and each time he failed to win a frame. He did not enter again. David Greaves was 12 minutes late to his match against John Barrie, and so, for the first time in the tournament's history, a frame was awarded to a player because of their opponent's late arrival. Barrie had not played in the championship since 1955; he had last won a championship match in 1951. Barrie won 9–3. Pat Houlihan, who had defeated both Reardon and Spencer to win the 1965 English Amateur Championship, took an 8–0 lead against Chris Ross, and won 9–1. \nIn the qualifying round, Doug Mountjoy defeated Andrewartha 9–3 after losing the opening two frames. In the other qualifying matches, Houlihan won 9–7 against Jim Meadowcroft, Patsy Fagan eliminated John Dunning 9–5, Willie Thorne defeated Rex Williams 9–3, Parkin lost 2–9 to Bill Werbeniuk, and David Taylor won 9–7 against Paddy Morgan\nFirst round.\nThe first round took place from 17 to 21April, each match played over three sessions as the best of 25 frames. Defending champion Spencer became the first player to experience the so-called \"Crucible curse\", a superstition that says every first-time world champion at the Crucible will fail to retain the title the following year. He lost 8–13 to Perrie Mans in the first round, despite making breaks of 138 and 118. David Taylor won the first three frames against Graham Miles. The pair were level at 8–8 before Miles went on to win 13–10. Fagan was 10–12 behind Alex Higgins but won three close frames – on a , then the final and, in the , on the final – to complete a 13–12 victory.\nthe first session between Fred Davis and Dennis Taylor saw them each win four frames; in the second session Davis moved into an 11–6 lead, and he eventually won 13–9. Thorne missed at an attempt to pot the ball when leading Eddie Charlton 12–9, and lost the match 12–13. Houlihan made his only appearance in the World Championship at the Crucible, aged 48. He lost 8–13 to Thorburn, who later described him as \"a smooth player... I had to be very careful against Patsy because if the balls were open he could get to you. A very dangerous player.\" Reardon trailed Mountjoy 2–7, but went on to win 13–9. Werbeniuk defeated John Pulman 13–4. Reardon trailed Mountjoy 2–7, but went on to win 13–9.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals took place from 20 to 22April, each match played over three sessions as the best of 25 frames. Mans took a lead of 9–7 into the last session against Miles, and went on to win 13–7. Davis made a 105 break in the fifth frame, and held a one-frame lead after the nine frames of their first session. Fagan levelled at 7–7 with a break of 105 in the 14th frame, and the pair were again tied at 8–8. Davis took the first three frames of the concluding session for 11–8, and secured his passage into the semi-finals at 13–10.\nCharlton won five successive frames to recover from 8–12 and win 13–12 against Thorburn. He compiled a 108 break in the 16th frame. Reardon's four frame advantage in the initial session was maintained during the second session as he went from 6–2 to 10–6. In the third session he won three successive frames, to defeat Werbeniuk 13–6, and compiled a break of 119 in the 18th frame.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals took place from 23 to 26April, both matches played over five sessions as the best of 35 frames. Davis became the oldest championship semi-finalist, at the age of 64 years and 251 days. He lost 16–18 to Mans. Davis reflected afterwards that, \"If I left him anything at all in the open, no matter how far away, he invariably potted it\". Fred's brother Joe Davis, aged 77, who was watching in the audience, was taken ill during the match. According to snooker historian Clive Everton, Joe had been \"swinging in his seat this way and that as he mentally played each shot for his brother\". Joe collapsed two days later and required surgery; he died several weeks after from a chest infection.\nReardon won four of the seven frames in each of the first two sessions against Charlton. Charlton took six of seven frames in the next session to lead 12–9, but then lost all seven frames in the fourth session. This was the only time in the main tournament that year in which a player won all the frames in a complete session. Reardon said afterwards that \"The previous day I'd felt wonderful and couldn't hit a ball. This time I felt tired and listless and played marvellous.\" Reardon won 18–14. A third-place playoff was over two sessions on 27 and 28April as the best of 13 frames. Charlton won 7–3 against Davis.\nFinal.\nThe final took place from 27 to 29April, played over six sessions as the best of 49 frames, with John Williams as referee. Reardon and Mans were level at 2–2 but Reardon finished the first session 5–2 ahead. Mans levelled by taking the first three frames of the second session; Reardon later led 7–5, but the session finished with the score at 8–8. During the third session, they were level again at 10–10; the session finished with Reardon one frame ahead at 12–11. He increased his advantage by taking the first three frames in the next session. Sports historian Ian Morrison later wrote that at 15–11, \"for the first time since the opening session, the scoreboard reflected the true difference between the two players.\" With each player winning three of the next six frames, Reardon was still four frames up, at 18–14. On the third day, Mans narrowed the gap to a single frame, but a 100 break by Reardon in the 36th frame doubled that deficit, and the session finished with Reardon four frames in front again, at 22–18. In the concluding session, Reardon made an 81 break in winning the opening frame, and added the next two frames to secure victory at 25–18. \nReardon became the oldest ever World Champion at the age of 45 years and 203 days, a record that lasted until 2022 when Ronnie O'Sullivan won the title aged 46 years and 148 days. It was Reardon's sixth and last world championship title. In a post-match interview, Reardon stated that he felt he had \"played well throughout\", and praised Mans's ability to pot balls, commenting that \"He makes shots that I would not even dream of attempting.\" Mans said that \"I felt good when I won the first three frames. But then Ray made a century. He found his rhythm and I just couldn't do anything about it.\"\nJohn Hennessy of \"The Times\" felt that the pair were generally evenly matched, but \"temperament, allied to superlative technique, seemed always on Reardon's side. Whereas Mans seemed in just too much of a hurry between strokes Reardon took a measured tread round the table, gathering his thoughts and concentration on the way.\" He speculated that Mans had lost his nerve towards the end of the match, as shown in him playing more shots and attempting fewer of the audacious pots that he had been playing throughout the tournament. Television critic Clive James, television critic for \"The Observer\", praised how Reardon \"embodies in its highest form snooker's heady combination of requirements: he has uncanny physical skill and a subtle mind to go with it.\"\nDuring the final, Peter Fiddick of \"The Guardian\" commented on how \"this nation has been taking an extraordinary interest... in snooker\", and how the players were \"very conscious of their new audience and its implications.\" A few days later, in the same newspaper, Frank Keating wrote that \"snooker finally managed its coming out party at the grand old age of 103.\" Hennessy felt that the substitution of snooker in place of the scheduled coverage of horse racing in the BBC's \"Grandstand\" was \"a remarkable testimony to the grip that the world professional championship took on the British public during the preceding fortnight.\" He predicted that \"One way and another the game is not likely to be the same again.\" Everton, who made his BBC commentary debut for the match between Charlton and Thorne, suggested in 1993 that the BBC's decision to screen daily coverage of the tournament was \"the single most influential decision ever made in the history of snooker, broadening its commercial horizons forever.\"\nMain draw.\nNumbers in parentheses indicate seedings.

        "text": "The 1977 World Snooker Championship is a professional snooker tournament that took place from 18 to 30 April 1977 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. John Spencer won his third World Snooker Championship title by defeating Cliff Thorburn by 25 to 21 in the final. It was the first time the championship was held at the Crucible, which has remained as the venue for the Championship. The tournament was sponsored by cigarette manufacturer Embassy.\nQualifying matches took place from 28 March to 7 April 1977 at Hounslow Civic Centre and Fisher's Snooker Centre, Acton, to select eight qualifiers to play against the eight top-seeded players from the 1976/1977 snooker world rankings in the main tournament. Ray Reardon, who had won the annual championship each year from 1973 to 1976, was defeated 6–13 by Spencer in the quarter-finals. There were six century breaks at the championship; Spencer scored 135, the tournament's highest break, in the sixth frame of his semi-final match against John Pulman. Spencer was the first player to win the championship using a two-piece . As champion, he received £6,000 from the prize fund of £17,000. The World Championship was the only ranking event of the 1976–77 snooker season.\nOverview.\nBritish Army soldiers stationed in India invented snooker, a cue sport, in the late 19th century. Joe Davis won the first World Snooker Championship, which the Billiards Association and Control Council (BA&amp;CC) organised in 1927. In the \"modern\" era of the sport, which started in 1969 when the World Championship reverted to a knockout format, snooker has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand. Since 1977, the championship has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England.\nIn the 1977 championship, 16 professional players competed in one-on-one snooker matches in a single-elimination format, each match being played over several . Ray Reardon was the defending champion, having defeated Alex Higgins 27–16 in the final of the 1976 World Snooker Championship The top-eight players in the 1976/1977 snooker world rankings were exempted to the main tournament, where they each faced a player from a qualifying competition. The championship was organised by the governing body for professional snooker the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), and promoted by Mike Watterson, with sponsorship by cigarette company Embassy. Watterson chose the Crucible after his wife Carol Watterson, saw a play there and recommended the venue. Watterson booked the venue at a cost of £6,600, and made personal financial guarantees for the championship before Embassy's sponsorship had been secured. Audience members purchased tickets at prices ranging from 75p to £3.50, and the event made a surplus of £12,000. Highlights of the semi-finals and final were broadcast on the national television channel BBC2.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for 1977 was: \nTournament summary.\nQualifying.\nThe WPBSA first published official world rankings for players on the main tour for the 1976–77 season. Players' performances in the previous three World Snooker Championships—1974, 1975, and 1976—contributed to their points totals. These rankings were used for seedings for the tournament. As defending champion, Reardon was seeded first and was also number one on the ranking list. Originally, the top 14 players were due to be seeded into the last-16 round, but the WPBSA members voted 11–10 to change this so that only the top eight players were exempted to the last-16. The draw for the tournament was conducted by journalist Janice Hale at Albany Hotel, Birmingham. The 1977 World Championship was the only ranking event of the 1976–77 season.\nQualifying matches were scheduled from 28 March to 7 April 1977, and took place at Hounslow Civic Centre and Fisher's Snooker Centre, Acton. In the first round, John Virgo eliminated Roy Andrewartha 11–1. In the next round, Virgo won four consecutive frames to go from 7–6 against John Dunning to win 11–6. Willie Thorne won six consecutive frames to complete an 11–6 defeat of Bernard Bennett. Jim Meadowcroft gained a 6–3 lead against Patsy Fagan but lost 9–11 after the pair had been level at 8–8. David Taylor defeated David Greaves 11–0 and made a century break in the fourth frame. There were two other 11–0 defeats: by Cliff Thorburn against Chris Ross and by Dennis Taylor against Jack Karnehm. Veteran Jackie Rea was 8–6 and later 9–8 ahead of Masters champion Doug Mountjoy, a first-season professional who was the reigning World Amateur Champion. Mountjoy won three consecutive frames to win the match 11–9. Maurice Parkin withdrew from the tournament due to illness, giving John Pulman a win by default. Fagan, Virgo, Mountjoy and Thorne qualified to make their World Championship debuts.\nFirst round.\nThe first round took place from 18 to 21 April; each match was played over three sessions as the best of 25 frames. Reardon and Fagan each won four frames in their first session, before Reardon opened a 10–7 lead during the second session and won the match 13–7 the following day. John Spencer was three frames behind Virgo at 1–4 and 4–7 but won three successive frames to equalise both times, and won the match 13–9.

Two visits later, Mountjoy potted the black to win the match.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played as best-of-25-frames matches over three sessions on 23 and 24 April. Reardon was never ahead of Spencer, who won the match 6–13, eliminating Reardon. The \"Snooker Scene\" match-report assessment said: \"Even when the title was slipping away from [Reardon] he never seemed able to focus his concentration and stop making mistakes\". Pulman reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1970 by defeating Miles 13–10. The reporter for \"Snooker Scene\" said Pulman played \"the smooth, attractive snooker of his great days\" in the final session.\nThorburn and Charlton were level several times at 3–3, 7–7, 10–10 and 11–11. Charlton won the 23rd frame on the final black but lost the match when Thorburn won the next two frames to win the match 13–12. Mountjoy won the first three frames of his match against Dennis Taylor but then lost the next five frames. Each player won four frames in the second session, then Taylor won the opening frame in the third session to lead 10–7. Mountjoy won the next two frames, each on the final black ball, but lost the 20th frame after he went the last black. Taylor won 13–11.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals took place from 24 to 27 April as best-of-35-frames matches played over five sessions. Pulman took a 3–0 lead but Spencer recovered to 3–3 and compiled a of 135 in the sixth frame. Pulman then went ahead 7–3 before Spencer levelled the match by winning the next four frames. Spencer went on to lead 13–9 and 16–2, and won 18–12, qualifying for the final for the first time since 1972.\nThorburn led 4–3 after the first session and was level at 7–7 with Taylor after the second session. At the start of the third session, Thorburn made a 100 break, which included a on the final , and led 12–9 at the close of the penultimate day. Taylor added three frames to his tally at the start of the fourth session to equalise, and four frames later, the pair were again level at 14–14. Four frames into the last session, they were at 16–16. Thorburn made a break of 111 in the 33rd frame, during which the only time he potted the black ball was at the end, then took a lead of 80–0 points in the 34th frame, which ended 98–30, meaning Thorburn qualified for the final for the first time.\nFinal.\nThe tournament's final took place from 28 to 30 April as the best of 49 frames, and was refereed by John Smyth. Spencer won his third world title by defeating Thorburn 25–21. The first session ended with Spencer 4–2 ahead after he won the opening three frames, and he extended his lead to 5–2 before Thorburn won four of the next five frames to leave the score at 6–6 at the day's conclusion. When the third session ended, Thorburn and Spencer were tied at 9–9. Spencer made a break of 105 in the 18th frame.\nDuring the fourth session, Thorburn gained a 13–11 advantage and extended it to 15–11 but Spencer won the next four frames to make it 15–15.

Thorburn won the following two frames before Spencer won the 42nd frame with a break of 67 to lead 22–20. Thorburn narrowed his deficit to one frame at 21–22 but Spencer won the next three frames to claim victory.\nSpencer was the first player to win the title with a two-piece cue. His previous cue was smashed in a car accident just before the 1974 Norwich Union Open; despite repairs, Spencer was not confident about using it so he purchased a new, two-piece implement whilst on tour in Canada. Having made several century breaks with the new cue following his return to England, Spencer decided to use it for the championship only two months before the tournament. A few months after his victory, he replaced it with a different, Japanese-made cue. Snooker historian Clive Everton wrote Spencer \"exploded two myths\" by winning with a two-piece cue, a type of implement that was generally seen as suitable for pool but not snooker, and having only used it for two months, when most professional players thought it took many months to become proficient with a new cue. Thorburn also used a two-piece cue for the match as was common in his native Canada.\nAn article in \"Snooker Scene\" contrasted Spencer's playing style in his earlier World Championship victories, which featured \"aggressive\" long , to the way he played in 1977, which included fewer long pots and consistent mid-distance potting, and praised his \"coolness and steadiness of nerve\" and his choice of shots to play. The same magazine described Thorburn's strengths at the tournament as \"concentration and consistency\".\nMain draw.\nThe results for the tournament are shown below.

        "title": "Jonah Lomu Rugby",
        "text": "Jonah Lomu Rugby is a rugby union video game developed by Rage Software and published by Codemasters in 1997. It was released for MS-DOS, PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. The title refers to former All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu. It was the first rugby union game released on the Saturn or PlayStation platforms.\nFollowing the 2003 closure of Rage Software, several members of the game's development team went on to work on \"World Championship Rugby\".\nGameplay.\n\"Jonah Lomu Rugby\" puts the player in control of real-life national rugby union teams from the 1995 Rugby World Cup, including the 16 finalists and 16 other teams that participated in the qualifying campaign. The game has support for up to four players.\nModes.\n\"Jonah Lomu Rugby\" has five modes: Friendly, World Cup, Tournament, Territories Cup and Classic Matches. The Friendly mode is a single exhibition game in which the player can play against computer-controlled or human opponents. The World Cup mode replicates the 1995 Rugby World Cup format, with the 16 teams arranged into the same four pools as in the real life tournament. Tournament mode is a knockout format contested by either 4, 8 or 16 teams. Territories Cup mode consists of leagues based around geographic location. The Five Nations and Tri Nations competitions feature the same teams competing in the real life equivalents, whilst the American Cup, Asian Cup and Pacific Cup each feature three teams from the areas.\nThe Classic Matches mode consists of eight scenario matches based on real-life World Cup matches that the player joins in progress with the aim of obtaining a different result to that in real-life.\nDevelopment.\nRage Software's Trevor Williams recounted: \"We wanted a game that stayed true to the rules, but was easy to pick up and play without a complete understanding of all the ins and outs\". After work had concluded on the studio's football title \"Striker '96\" he stated that \"we could see the potential in the engine in a sprite-based rugby simulation could both look good and run at the right pace\", arguing that \"using polygons would slow the game too much\".\nProgrammers Tony McCabe and Antonio Argentieri explained that rugby video games are more difficult to make than other sports games, since the heavy specialization of the different players means a number of different AIs need to be designed and programmed to run simultaneously. The scrum was remodeled more than five times in an effort to make it work in play.\nCommentary for the game was supplied by Bill McLaren and Bill Beaumont. Rage Software purchased the audio rights to the 1995 Five Nations match between England and France to assist in producing realistic sounds for match play.\nThe Saturn version was slated for release in June 1997, but the date was pushed back to September. The game was ready by the June date, but Codemasters held it back to coincide with the release of the PC version and the start of the new rugby season.\nReception.\nMatt Yeo gave a rave review in \"Sega Saturn Magazine\", saying it has \"one of the most innovative and easy to use game play systems ever utilised in a sports game\". He particularly noted the use of on-screen menus during pauses in the game's action, saying they enable newcomers to more easily come to grips with the game by presenting rugby's complicated rules in a simplified, leisurely form. He also praised the four-player support, audio commentary, and dramatic weather conditions, and gave the game a score of 91%.\n\"Computer and Video Games\" gave a positive review of the PlayStation version, noting the \"brilliantly realistic graphics and a logical control system are the stars here\" and awarding the game 4/5.\nIn 2015, a retrospective review in \"The Telegraph\" described Jonah Lomu Rugby as \"the greatest computer game the sport has ever seen\". The \"Irish Independent\" similarly described it as \"the best rugby game ever made\".\nLegacy.\nA copy of the PlayStation version of the game is included in the Pacific Cultures collection of Te Papa (the national museum of New Zealand)."

Early scrimmages reportedly taking place as far back as 1971 at Kelston Boys High school and run by \"The Godfather\" of NZ football, George O'Scanlon. The first reported game was in 1975 between a team in Auckland known as the ADC (Auckland Distribution Centre) Cowboys who travelled to Hamilton for a one-off game against the CCNZOB's (Church College NZ Old Boys). \nAs is tradition in American football USA, a cheer squad also traveled with the ADC Cowboys to support the team. This was the start of a long affiliation of cheer squads formed by teams to support the game of American football in NZ.\nThe scrimmages in Auckland continued and would go on to see the formation of the Metro Lions and Henderson Rangers clubs. There were 4 original clubs formed in 1982, based in Auckland; South Auckland Saints, Metro Lions, Henderson Rangers and North Shore. 2 of those clubs remain today, the Saints as South Auckland Raiders and the Mountain Lions as Metro Lions. Much later competition was started in Wellington and other clubs were formed in places like Whangarei, Tauranga, Hamilton, Wanganui, Palmerston North and Levin.\nThe game today sees the continued growth of the game in Canterbury, Hawkes Bay and Nelson.\n1940's exhibition football was played in wartime New Zealand, with games put on by US serviceman during WW2. Reported games were played in both Auckland and Wellington between rival US warships.\n1949 sees the first reported NZ football player to make a US college team. Joe Hapi from the Hawkes Bay area appears on the BYU Cougars football team as an offensive lineman.\n1964 saw exhibition football played in Gisborne as elders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints put on a game complete with full equipment for the locals. Kaiti Trojans played the Te Hapara Packers.\nOnce again in the late '70s, elders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints introduced football to the Polynesian communities in Auckland and Hamilton, which would lead to the early scrimmages and the competition in Auckland as we know it today.\n1983 saw the San Francisco 49ers draft high-profile USC linebacker Riki Ellison. Riki's presence in the NFL would help promote the game to NZers and prove that Kiwis could make it in professional American Football.\nDuring the late 80's NZ Football received unprecedented media coverage when TV3 began to broadcast NFL highlights packages and Sky Sports would televise the Super Bowl live. The then NZGFA sports information director Ed Mason's work, especially in the newspaper print media was essential to spreading the word that American Football had now well and truly arrived in NZ. Ed Mason went on to become a founding member of NZ Baseball and was inducted into the NZ Baseball Hall Of Fame. Ed Mason is also a Life Member of the Metro Lions American Football Club.\nThere have been a succession of governing bodies for the sport with the current NZAFF being recognised by the NZ Government and with membership from all of the regions playing football; Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch. Twice in its history, there have been organisational splits with competing leagues being formed. In the late 1980s there was the NZ Gridiron Football Association and the NZ American Football League, in the late 1990s and early 2000s there was Gridiron New Zealand and the NZ American Football Association. On both of these occasions, the leagues rejoined each other and overcame their differences.\n1989 saw former NZAFL founder George O'Scanlon establish the ISSI for athletes in Australia, which would go on to introduce the Down Under Bowl concept in the Southern Hemisphere. A tournament NZ would eventually send teams to Australia to compete in. Down Under Bowl directors George O'Scanlon and former Utah State University head coach and BYU special teams coach Chris Pella were instrumental in bringing numerous football programs to NZ in the 1980s and creating countless pathways for NZ football players who wanted pursue the game further in the US.\nGridiron NZ saw the introduction and much-needed promotion of age grades to American Football in NZ, a component essential to its continued growth over the years.\nThe Canadian Football League has also seen a number of athletes with NZ roots make an appearance on rosters over the years. Luc Mullinder, Will Hinchcliff and Johan Asiata.\nLikewise, there has also been a number of athletes appearing on NFL rosters in last few years with NZ roots including Stephen Paea (Bears, Redskins, Browns), Tevita Finau (Jets, Texans), Kona Schwenke (Seahawks), Rhett Ellison (Vikings) BYU rugby convert Paul Lasike (Cardinals, Bears). Others to try out for NFL spots over the years include Will Hinchcliff (Redskins), Nic Purcell (Eagles), Joe Tuineau (Jets), Johan Asiata (Bears) and Abe Markowitz (Seahawks), Andrew Motu'apuaka (Jacksonville Jaguars) \nAmerican Football Auckland Club Profiles\nThere have been a number of clubs in New Zealand since the game's inception, only 2 original clubs remain but some of the others have been:\nMetro Lions:\n Originally known as the Mountain Lions. A foundation club that ran out of Potters Park in Mount Eden. Founding and life members included Pose Tafa, Willie-John Stowers and the late Peter Tua'i. To their credit they continue to this day and are one of the most successful clubs in the country. They are the Metro Lions and were one of the first club to supply players to US College football and the NFL. Most notable was Mark Nua who received a full football scholarship to play at the University of Hawaii. Mark Nua was drafted in the NFL by the Detroit Lions before eventually landing on the San Diego Chargers roster. Mark also played in the World League of American Football for the Sacramento Surge. Also attending the University of Hawaii was sprinter and part-time actor John Freeman. Another of the pioneer Metro Lions to attend college was Toa Sagapolu who played for the University of California Berkeley, playing in the famous Citrus Bowl in 1992 in Orlando. Former Toa Samoa and NZ Warriors rugby league player Shannon Stowers also attended Utah State University. More recently William Hodgman attended Arizona Western College. The club today is based out of Grey Lynn Park.Colours: Black jerseys and silver pants.\nSouth Auckland Raiders:\n A founding club who were originally named the South Auckland Saints. Foundation members included Lawrence Tafa, Arthur Beazley, and Colin Tavui. When the Auckland league first split into two in the early 1980s, they changed their name to the Xerox Raiders and changed their colours to purple and silver. Initially heavily influenced by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who supplied coaching and local players. Former Tongan RWC player Joe Tuineau who attended SE Missouri University spent time on the NY Jets roster. Colours: Red with white numbers and black pants, later white jerseys with orange numbers and pants.\nHenderson Rangers:\nA founding club and under the direction of NZ gridiron pioneer, the late George O’Scanlan. George O'Scanlon reportedly ran a football team at Kelston Boys High School back in the 1970s but failed to find any opposition. O'Scanlon continued to organize games and scrimmages through the late '70s that lead to the formation of both the Henderson Rangers and Metro Lions clubs. They also provided players to the US College system. Former Manu Samoa and Auckland rugby star Timo Tagaloa was the first NZ athlete to receive a full football scholarship to Utah State University. Also JC college and rugby league player Robert Marsom who spent time at Eastern Utah and El Camino colleges. Henderson Rangers continued as a successful club for many years before folding in the early 2000s. Colours: Dark Green with white numbers, gold pants and helmets, later royal blue jerseys with white numbers and red trim, blue pants with red and white stripes, red helmets.\nNorth Shore:\nNorth Shore was one of the 4 founding clubs in NZ football. Essentially it was based out of Long Bay College where an American teacher Wes Edwards put together a very good team. Star players included Joe Fepuleai, David Woods and Nick Leger, both of whom would go on to play for the Roskill Rams and Mt Albert Mustangs. While lacking in size, they did the basics well, especially the sweep with their quick backs. The club lasted for only a few years before folding and several players joining other established teams. Colours: Red with yellow numbers and white pants.\nRoskill Rams:\nThe first of the expansion clubs founded by Tony Andrews with the assistance of Mark Nua and Wayne Wright and was made up mainly of former Metro Lions players. Was very successful in their first season taking out the league championship, continued as a strong club until the late 1980s when players left en-masse to form the Mount Albert Mustangs. Notable player included another former Manu Samoa rugby star Sam Kaleta who reportedly went to University of Arizona before returning to rugby. Also former NZ Maori All Black Paul Tuoro. Former team kicker Michael Chalberg would be the rare recipient of a full football scholarship to the University of Minnesota. Struggled for many years after that before folding in the early 90s.

        "title": "1976 World Snooker Championship",
        "text": "The 1976 World Snooker Championship (officially known as the 1976 Embassy World Snooker Championship) was a professional ranking snooker tournament that took place at two venues, Middlesbrough Town Hall, and Wythenshawe Forum, Manchester, from 7 to 23 April 1976. Qualifying matches were played at the Prince of Wales Hotel, Southport, and at the Park House Hotel, Blackpool from 29 March to 2 April. The tournament was promoted by Maurice Hayes's company Q Promotions on behalf of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. The winner received £6,000 from a total prize fund of £15,300.\nThe winner of the title was Ray Reardon, who defeated Alex Higgins 27–16 in the final at Wythenshawe Forum, to claim his fifth World Championship. Reardon was the defending champion, having won 31–30 against Eddie Charlton in the 1975 final. During the 1976 final, Reardon made several complaints about the environment, which was adjusted to accommodate him. Charlton had complained earlier about a table, which was found to be non-standard, invalidating his break of 137.\nThere were seven century breaks in the championship, the highest of which was 138 by John Spencer. It was the last World Championship before the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield became the regular venue. For the first time, the tournament was sponsored by the cigarette company Embassy; the relationship endured for 30 years.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is the preeminent tournament in professional snooker. Joe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, organised by the Billiards Association and Control Council, the final match being held at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Staged annually until 1940, the tournament was put on hiatus during World War II and went into decline in the post-war era; the 1952 World Snooker Championship was contested by only two players and was replaced by the World Professional Match-play Championship, which was also discontinued in 1957. The title was contested on an occasional challenge basis until 1969, when the World Championship reverted to a knockout tournament format.\nThe 1976 championship featured sixteen professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single-elimination format, each match played over several . These competitors in the main tournament were selected using a combination of the top players based on results from the three previous years and the winners of a pre-tournament qualification stage. The tournament was promoted by Maurice Hayes's company Q Promotions on behalf of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. The defending champion was Ray Reardon, who had defeated Eddie Charlton 31–30 in the 1975 final to win his fourth title.\nThere were 27 entrants for the 1976 tournament. In addition to Reardon, several former champions entered. Multiple-time champions Fred Davis and John Pulman had first entered in 1937 and 1947 respectively. John Spencer (1969 and 1971) and Alex Higgins (1972) were the only players to have won the tournament since 1969 apart from Reardon. The draw for the tournament was due to be televised on the BBC Television current affairs programme \"Nationwide\", with recorded footage of three players as part of the segment. Although Higgins was at the Lime Grove Studios as planned, Spencer said that he was unaware that he was expected to be at the Manchester studios, and Dennis Taylor was playing in a tournament in Portsmouth, so could not attend the Birmingham studio. Graham Miles was appointed as a substitute for Taylor, but got stuck in traffic and abandoned his journey when he realised he would not arrive on time. The draw was not televised; WPBSA officials met actress Glenda Jackson at Lime Grove by chance, and she agreed to make the draw. The main tournament matches were held at either Middlesbrough Town Hall or at the Wythenshawe Forum, Manchester.\nThe tournament was sponsored by tobacco company W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills, using their Embassy brand. As part of the arrangement, they also sponsored a Women's Open tournament, an international amateur tournament, and an open tournament for players in the UK. Embassy's sponsorship of the word championship, which followed an approach by Hayes, endured for the next 30 years. It was the last world championship before the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield became the regular venue.\nPrize fund.\nThe winner of the event received £6,000 from a total prize fund of £15,300. The planned breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below, but it was later decided that there would not be a playoff for third and fourth place.\nTournament summary.\nQualifying.\nOne group of qualifying matches was played at the Prince of Wales Hotel, Southport. The other group took place at the Park House Hotel, Blackpool. At both venues, first round matches were played on 29 and 30 March 1976, the second round matches on 31 March and 1 April, and a final on 2 April. All matches were the best of 15 frames. At Blackpool, veteran Jackie Rea, who had made his tournament debut in 1949, eliminated Ian Anderson 8–5, and then saw off Bernard Bennett by the same score. He lost in the to David Taylor in a match that determined a qualifier for the main event. Taylor had previously accounted for David Greaves 8–1; Greaves had previously defeated Jim Charlton 8–5.\nThe qualifying place from the Southport section was taken by Jim Meadowcroft, who won 8–5 against Willie Thorne. In the first qualifying round, Ron Gross defeated Maurice Parkin 8–5, Lou Condo eliminated Marcus Owen 8–6 and Dennis Wheelwright won only a single frame against Meadowcroft. In the next round, Gross led Meadowcoft 4–3 but lost 4–8, and Thorne won 8–3 against Condo.\nMain tournament.\nThe leading 14 players in the Order of Merit, a ranking based on performances in the preceding three world championships, received automatic entry to the final stages and were joined by two winners from the qualifying competition. The leading eight players in the Order of Merit were seeded. The top half of the draw was played at Middlesbrough Town Hall from 10 to 16 April, and the bottom hal was staged as Wythenshawe Forum from 11 to 19 April. The final was held over 4 days, from 20 to 23 April, at Wythenshawe Forum. There were two of play each day, at 2:00 pm and at 7:30 pm.\nFirst round.\nFirst round matches were played from 10 to 13 April at Middlesbrough, and from 11 to 14 April at Manchester, as the best of 29 frames. Defending champion Ray Reardon won 15–7 against John Dunning and made a break of 106. Reardon won all but one of the last 14 frames. After a complaint by Reardon about distractions, spectators were barred from bringing drinks into the arena and from lighting cigarettes when the competitors were in the process of making their . Gary Owen lost 9–15 to Dennis Taylor. It was Owen's last appearance at the world championship. Snooker historian Clive Everton later wrote that Owen \"seemed to have lost all heart for the game\" and was a lesser player than in the days when he had won two World Amateur Snooker Championships.\nSpencer took a 12–1 lead against David Taylor and won 15–5, finishing the match with a 138 break in the 20th frame. After two sessions, Cliff Thorburn led Higgins 8–6, but he lost the first four frames in the next session and, going into the concluding session, the pair were tied at 10–10. Thorburn held a lead at 13–13 and 14–13, but Higgins won the 28th frame to take the match to a deciding frame, which Higgins won after breaks of 33 and 32.\nA quarter-final between two of the unseeded players was set as Meadowcroft won five of the next six frames after leading Williams 9–5; and Miles lost 10–15 to Perrie Mans. According to article in \"The Times\", Williams \"struggled all through\" his match. Davis held a 15–7 lead against Bill Werbeniuk, but lost the first four frames of their concluding session before going three frames clear at 14–11. The match went to a deciding frame, which was won by Davis.\nHaving been 1–3 and 4–5 behind Pulman, Charlton took four of the last five frames on the first day. Charlton made a break of 137 in the penultimate frame, but, following his criticism of the snooker table, officials measured the size of the and found that five of the six were too large, meaning that his break was not recognised.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played from 14 to 15 April at Middlesbrough, and from 15 to 16 April at Manchester, as the best of 29 frames. Reardon led Taylor 7–0, and was 12–2 after two sessions, and won 15–2. He compiled a break of 115 in the last frame. Meadowcroft praised Mans's as \"fantastic\" Mans constructed a 9–5 lead and won 15–8. The 1972 finalists Spencer and Higgins were level at 7–7 after their first two sessions. Higgins had the better of the third session and finished it 11–9 up. He was one frame from victory at 14–12, but Spencer took the next two frames to force a deciding frame; it was won by Higgins. Charlton led Davis 5–1, 8–7 and 11–9 at the close of their first three sessions. They were level at 13–13, before Charlton added the next two frames for victory.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played from 16 to 18 April at Middlesbrough, and from 17 to 19 April at Manchester, as the best of 39 frames. Mans was known to be a skilled potter and exponent, but lacked ; he had made only two breaks of 50 or more in reaching the semi-finals. According to Everton, Mans's \"limitations were drastically exposed\", as Reardon took the first session 4–2 and went on to win 20–10 with a top break of 133. After the match, Mans accepted Reardon's offer of a 30-minute session of advice about shot selection.\nAll but one of the six frames in first session of the match between Higgins and Charlton went to Higgins, and he finished the first day leading 8–5. By the close of day two, Higgins was 14–12 ahead, having made a break of 121 in the 22nd frame. Charlton was only one frame behind at 16–17. but Higgins took the next two frames, and Charlton took the two after that. Higgins won 20–18, to progress to his first world championship final since his victory in 1972.\nFinal.\nThe final was played as the best of 53 frames from 20 to 23 April at Wythenshawe Forum, meaning that Reardon had travelled to where Higgins had been playing. Higgins had the better of the earlier exchanges, and led 4–2 after the first session. After the session, Reardon complained to the organisers that he could not see the balls properly due to the bright lighting that had been installed for television, and the lighting levels were reduced. He won five successive frames during the second session, and led 8–5 after the first day. Reardon complained about the quality of the snooker table during the afternoon session on the second day. Everton endorsed Reardon's complaints about the table, later detailing how it was extremely difficult to pot balls along one side , while balls were holding close to the opposite cushion, and the ball did not rebound off cushions as expected. Higgins had taken a one frame lead at 10–9 before the table was attended to by fitters during the interval.\nReardon took six of the seven evening frames for 15–11 lead going into the last day. During the evening session, referee Bill Timms declared that Higgins had failed to hit the after being by Reardon. Higgins told Timms that \"I'll have to accept it, but you're wrong.\" Reardon, by exercising his right to have Higgins play the next shot rather than accept a , demonstrated his agreement with Higgins rather than with the referee. With both players making playing errors, Reardon played tactically and won five successive frames, the last with a break of 87, to lead 15–11 after two days.\nHiggins won the first two frames of the fifth session, but Reardon took the next three for 18–13. In the 29th frame, Reardon recovered from 68 points behind to take the frame. He won the 31st frame after . In frame 32, with Reardon well ahead on points, Timms awarded Higgins a free ball, a decision disputed by Reardon. Reardon won that frame to increase his lead to 19–13, but complained about Timms's refereeing to the organisers. It was subsequently announced that Timms was ill, and John Williams would referee the rest of the final. With Higgins conceding several frames while there were still on the table during the sixth session, Reardon ended the third day leading 24–15. Reardon won three of the first frames on the fourth morning to secure his fifth title victory at 27–16, with a . Writing in \"The Guardian\", Everton felt that Reardon \"won without ever displaying his most dominating form\", and that he \"looks in a class of his own and there is no obvious successor in sight. Similarly, \"The Times\" report of the final session concluded that \"Reardon looked a class above the rest.\" Part of the final was shown on BBC Television.\nAftermath.\nThe Sponsored Events Manager for W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills, Peter Dyke, commented that it had been an \"interesting and rewarding involvement\" and said that the company would be interested in maintaining an involvement with snooker. However, he complained that the promoter, Hayes, had declined to tell the company details of income from gate receipts and other sources. Hayes's company Q Promotions went out of business shortly afterwards; it had been beset by problems including confusion over bookings for professionals it managed, including Higgins, which led several snooker clubs to pursue costs from the company. Mike Watterson, whose first sporting promotion had been a match between Higgins and Reardon in 1972, subsequently became the promoter for the 1977 Championship. Sports historian Ian Morrison wrote that following the \"near disaster\" of 1976 for the sponsors, \"Watterson convinced them that he could make the championships work, and the following year he proved himself correct.\" A similar account is provided by Everton: \"Pessimists feared that Embassy would pull out of snooker forthwith. They stayed because there was the prospect of more television coverage and better promotion... Watterson promoted the championship with an efficiency and flair it had never previously experienced.\"\nMain draw.\nNumbers in parentheses indicate seeding.

He is a former captain of Krylya Sovetov Moscow (Soviet Wings) of the Soviet League and was the first Soviet hockey player given permission to play in the National Hockey League (NHL), and the second Soviet player to appear in an NHL game, following Victor Nechayev. He joined the Calgary Flames in 1989 and played parts of three seasons in the NHL. Pryakhin returned to Europe in 1991 where he spent three seasons in Switzerland with Zürcher SC, then four in Finland with Kiekko-Espoo. He also played with the Oji Eagles in Japan for one year before returning to Kryla for a final season before retiring in 2000.\nInternationally, Pryakhin was a member of the Soviet national team. He appeared in two World Junior Championships and won a gold medal in 1983. He was a member of two World Championship teams, winning a silver medal in 1987 and gold in 1990. Pryakhin was also a member of the second place Soviet team at the 1987 Canada Cup.\nPlaying career.\nPryakhin's top level career began in 1980 when he appeared in one Soviet League for Krylya Sovetov Moscow (better known in North America as the Soviet Wings). He joined the team full-time in 1981–82 as a 17-year-old, appearing in 43 games for the Wings. Pryakhin's debut with the Soviet national team came the 1982 World Junior Hockey Championship in a fourth-place finish. He returned for the 1983 tournament and scored six points in seven games to help the Soviets win the gold medal.\nA mid-level player on both the Wings and the national team, Pryakhin's best seasons in the Soviet league came in 1983–84 when he scored 18 goals, and 1986–87 when he had 32 points. He ultimately rose to become captain of the Wings. He was a member of a Soviet squad that won a silver medal at the 1987 World Championship and finished as runners-up to Canada at the 1987 Canada Cup.\nThe National Hockey League (NHL)'s Calgary Flames, anticipating that it would be easier to convince the Soviet Hockey Federation to release a non-star member of their national team to play in North America, opted to select Pryakhin with the 252nd, and last, pick in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft. The Soviets began negotiations with the Flames in February 1989, and he signed a contract with Calgary on March 29. He became the first Soviet player permitted by his national federation to play in the NHL. Pryakhin made his NHL debut on March 31 against the Winnipeg Jets. He was the second Soviet player to appear in an NHL game, following Victor Nechayev. Pryahkin appeared in the Flames' final two games of the regular season, and one game of the 1989 playoffs as the Flames went on to win the Stanley Cup. He did not play enough games or in the finals so his name was left off the Cup. Calgary did give Pryakhin a Stanley Cup ring, and included him on the team picture.\nPryahkin scored his first NHL goal on October 10, 1989, against the New Jersey Devils. He appeared in 20 games with the Flames in 1989–90 and scored 2 goals and 4 points. He added 1 goal and 6 assists in 24 games in 1990–91 and made appearances with the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, Calgary's International Hockey League affiliate in both seasons. Internationally, Pryahkin appeared in three games and won a gold medal with the Soviet team at the 1990 World Championship.\nReturning to Europe in 1991–92, Pryahkin joined Zürcher SC of the Swiss top division. He was a member of the team for three seasons, splitting 1992–93 with Krylya Sovetov in his Russian home, before moving onto the Finnish SM-liiga for four seasons with Kiekko-Espoo. Pryahkin spent a season in Japan in 1998–99 before closing out his career with Krylya Sovetov in the Russian second division in 2000."

        "text": "The 1973 World Snooker Championship (also known as the 1973 Park Drive World Snooker Championship for sponsorship reasons) was a snooker tournament that took place from 16 to 28 April 1973 at the City Exhibition Halls in Manchester, England. The scheduling was a change of practice from championships in the preceding years, which had taken place over several months. The tournament was the 1973 edition of the World Snooker Championship established in 1927. The 1973 tournament was promoted by Peter West and Patrick Nally, and sponsored by tobacco brand Park Drive, with £8,000 prize money. There were 24 entrants, which was a new championship record.\nRay Reardon won the title by defeating Eddie Charlton 38 s to 32 in the final. It was Reardon's second World Championship win, after his first in 1970. He won a further four titles after the 1973 championship, the last of them in 1978. Defending champion Alex Higgins lost 9–13 to Charlton in the semi-finals. Higgins's quarter-final match against Fred Davis was interrupted when rainwater leaked onto the snooker table they were using. There were six century breaks during the competition, the highest of which was a 139 break compiled by John Spencer.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first professional snooker championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until 1935, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship.\nIn 1952, following a dispute between the Professional Billiards Players' Association (PBPA) and the BACC about the distribution of income from the world championship, the PBPA members established an alternative competition known as the World Professional Match-play Championship, the editions of which are now recognised as world championships, whilst only two players entered for the BACC's 1952 World Snooker Championship. The World Professional Match-play Championship continued until 1957, after which there was no world championship until 1964, when it was staged on a challenge basis, with defending champion John Pulman featuring in the first match. Pulman retained the title in several challenges from 1964 to 1968. \nThe 1969 championship, when the tournament reverted to a knockout format, is regarded as the first of the modern snooker era, and was won by John Spencer. From 1972, the championship was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), which was the renamed PBPA. For 1973, the tournament was sponsored by Park Drive. The defending champion was Alex Higgins, who had defeated Spencer 37–31 in the 1972 final.\nTournament.\nFormat.\nThe 1973 competition took place over two weeks, rather than the months it had taken to complete previous championships in the preceding years. It was promoted by Peter West and Patrick Nally, and sponsored by tobacco brand Park Drive, with £8,000 prize money. There were 24 entrants, a new championship record. The venue was City Exhibition Halls, Manchester, initially with concurrent play across eight different snooker tables in different parts of the Halls. s were scheduled at 2:00 pm and 7:30 pm each day. In order to break even, the event required 15,000 paying spectators across the matches; the actual attendance was 25,000. For the first time, a major bookmaker, Ladbrokes, offered odds on a snooker tournament. At the start of the tournament, the bookmakers rated Spencer as the favourite to win, at odds of 9–4, with Higgins second at 3–1.\nPrize fund.\nThe winner of the event received £1,500 from a total prize fund of £8,000. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below.\n£100 was allocated for the winner of the plate competition between losers in the first two rounds, with £50 for the runner-up. John Pulman won the plate competition.\nFirst round.\nFirst round matches were scheduled as best-of-17 frames, taking place on 16 April 1973. Jackie Rea's cue, which he had used since the age of nine, was stolen a few days before his match against Pat Houlihan, and it was returned to him only near the end of their contest. Houlihan took a 2–0 lead, and Rea drew level at 2–2, but he then lost seven frames in a row and was eliminated from the competition. Bernard Bennett led 7–2 against David Greaves before the match went to a , which Greaves won. Graham Miles made the highest break of the first round, 87, in his 9–5 defeat of Geoff Thompson.\nCliff Thorburn and Dennis Taylor made their world championship debuts; both players later became world champions. Taylor took a 4–2 lead, but Thorburn went ahead 8–6 and won the match 9–8. In the other matches of the first round, Perrie Mans eliminated Ron Gross 9–2, David Taylor beat John Dunning 9–4, and the 1970 runner-up Warren Simpson defeated Maurice Parkin 9–3. Jim Meadowcroft received a bye when his scheduled opponent Kingsley Kennerley withdrew due to illness.\nSecond round.\nIn the second round, from 17 to 18 April, matches were played as best-of-31 frames. Higgins was admonished by tournament director Bruce Donkin for arriving more than 20 minutes late for his match against Houlihan, and was later fined £100 by the WPBSA for his behaviour. Higgins took a 6–1 lead in the first session, and led 14–1 after the second session. He took the second and fourth frames of the third session to complete a 16–3 victory. Fred Davis took the first ten frames against Greaves, and won 16–1. Miles led John Pulman 6–1 and 10–5, and made a break of 110 in the 20th frame of the match on the way to a 16–10 victory. Having established a 6–1 advantage against Mans in the first session, Eddie Charlton lost six of the eight frames in their second session, but then added six of seven in the third session, and two frames in the final session, to win 16–8.\nGary Owen was 8–7 ahead against Simpson, but the match eventually finished 16–14 to Owen. Ray Reardon compiled a break of 112 in the 27th frame of his 16–10 defeat of Meadowcroft. Rex Williams and Thorburn were level at 11–11; Williams then took a 14–11 lead, but Thorburn recovered to lead 15–14. Williams took the next two frames to secure his progress to the next round. Spencer made the highest break of the tournament with 139, in the sixth frame of his match against David Taylor, which he won 16–5.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were scheduled as best-of-31 frames matches on 19 and 20 April, with the four matches played concurrently in different arenas. Higgins defeated Davis 16–14, after Davis had led 14–12. There was a 25-minute stoppage during the second frame of their afternoon session, when rainwater leaked onto the snooker table they were using. Williams compiled a break of 108 at the start of his first session against Spencer but lost 16–7. Miles recovered to 4–5 after losing the first five frames against Charlton. Although Miles lost 6–16, the reporter for \"Snooker Scene\" wrote that \"rarely has anyone played so well and lost so heavily.\" Owen lost by the same scoreline against Reardon, after winning the first two frames. According to Reardon, in his 1982 autobiography, there were only two spectators for part of the match.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals, held from 21 to 23 April, were best-of-45 frames matches, played concurrently. Reardon staged a recovery when, having trailed Spencer 12–19, he won their semi-final 23–22. From 12–19, Reardon won eight consecutive frames. The reporter for \"Snooker Scene\" described Reardon's comeback as \"the greatest recovery the event has ever seen.\" Charlton took a 6–0 lead against Higgins, and defeated him 23–9. Higgins attributed his defeat to playing with an unfamiliar cue, that he had been using for under two months. Charlton remarked that \"I think pressure had an awful lot to do with his poor performance. But I feel he has a lot to learn about the game. Whether he is capable of learning, we shall just have to wait and see.\" After the match, Higgins challenged Charlton to play for a stake of £100 and won 7–4.\nFinal.\nThe final was played as a best-of-75 frames contest from 24 to 28 April. Reardon lost the first session of the final against Charlton 0–7. He won the first frame of the second session with a break of 84, and also took the next three frames, to trail 4–7. Having won five of the eight frames in the second session, for 5–10, Reardon added five of the seven frames in the third session, to close the gap at 10–12. The pair were level at 12–12 and 13–13, and Reardon led 17–13 after the fourth session, before going ahead 27–25 after seven sessions of play. At the start of the eighth session, Reardon was affected by the bright lighting that had been installed for the purposes of television coverage, and he lost the first three frames. He complained about the lighting, and two large lights that were focused on the audience were switched off. From 27–28 behind, Reardon won four of the next five frames in the session, and sustained the momentum for an eventual 38–32 victory.\nFor the first time, some frames of the final were televised by the BBC. According to snooker historian Clive Everton, \"Charlton's dogged consistency proved no match for Reardon's flair and wider range of shots.\" It was Reardon's second world snooker championship win, after his first in 1970. He went on to win a further four world titles, the last of them in 1978.\nMain draw.\nResults are shown below. Winning players are denoted in bold.

        "title": "Brazil national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Brazil national rugby union team, nicknamed Tupis, is controlled by the Brazilian Rugby Confederation. Brazil is one of the founding unions of CONSUR (now Sudamérica Rugby) and played in the inaugural South American tournament. Brazil has not qualified for a Rugby World Cup, but participated in the first edition of rugby 7s in the Olympics. Brazil currently ranks 4th in South America (behind Argentina, Uruguay and Chile) and 6th in the Americas region.\nRugby union in Brazil has a long history, dating back to the late 19th century when British immigrants brought the game to Brazil's urban ports. Despite Brazil's success in association football, Brazil has historically been one of the weakest teams of the Americas, having less success than that of Argentina or Uruguay.\nIn the 21st century, efforts were made to revitalize the sport in Brazil. With rugby sevens being added to the Olympic calendar, Brazil was invited to the World Rugby Sevens Series, showing improvement in both the men's and women's series. In 2016, a meeting with the unions of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the United States and Uruguay established the Americas Rugby Championship, meant to mirror the Six Nations and The Rugby Championship, and give consistent tests to the top teams in the region. After 3 close games, two of which Brazil came close to victory, Brazil beat the USA Eagles, 24–23, their first victory in the championship, as well as over the United States and a Tier Two nation. Brazil later went to have its first victories over Belgium and Portugal, marking the first time the team beat any European side and, later, a historical win against Argentina XV. This latter game, along with two wins against Chile and Colombia, secured Brazil its first South American Rugby Championship title, in 2018.\nHistory.\nBeginnings: 19th Century to 1949.\nThe very first instance of rugby being played in Brazil dates back to the late 19th century. British immigrants arriving in Brazil brought the game to various port cities in Brazil. These immigrants set up various athletic clubs which doubled with association football. The first recorded instance of a rugby game being played in Brazil was 1891, played by the São Paulo Athletic Club, under the auspices of Charles William Miller. Future efforts to promote the game were then taken on by Augusto Shaw, after Miller began to devote himself exclusively to football.\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, rugby began to flourish somewhat in Brazil, although it did not enjoy the widespread exposure as football. For the most part, rugby was primarily restricted to those who had British descent, or with some other connection to Britain. In 1926, a proper domestic competition was established. By 1932, a national side had formed; Brazil played its first ever national game against South Africa XV, losing by an unknown margin. The sport suffered a setback when an attempt to get it recognized as a national sport was denied, since rugby was limited to only four states than the required five. World War II suspended operations from 1941 to 1946, as was the case in many countries.\n1950s to 1990s.\nBrazil participated in the first ever South American Rugby Championship, but lost all three of their fixtures. They were shut out 68 and 72 to zero against Chile and Argentina respectively, while Brazil played a closer game against Uruguay, losing 10 – 17. During the 1950s, organization of rugby in Brazil was sporadic; there was no official high governing union at the time, and the national side was only organized by Jimmy Macintyre, who ran the SPAC. Brazil would not play another test until 1961. The modern day Brazilian Rugby Confederation (CBRu) was founded in 1963, in order to govern the game more efficiently in the country. The first president of the CBRu was Harry Donovan. In 1964, Brazil finished runner-up in the South American Rugby Championship, tying Chile 16–16 and defeating Uruguay 15–8.\nIn the 1970s the better structure of rugby allowed the game to be introduced to Brazilians outside of the British-descended community. Brazil experienced somewhat of an expansion in rugby; the game was introduced to universities throughout the country, and Brazil was becoming a destination for rugby tours. In 1974, Brazil played a test match against France, losing by a margin of 7–99. For the rest of the decade Brazil played against its South American neighbors; Brazil frequently beat minnows Paraguay during this period.\nIn 1985, France toured Brazil again, but this time Brazil played much more valiantly, losing by a score of 6–41. Brazil is a charter member of CONSUR (now Sudámerica Rugby), founded in 1989. Despite this, Brazil did not officially join the IRB until 1995, and did not participate in qualifying tournaments until then. However, their first fixture in the qualifiers was a disaster; Brazil was humiliated by Trinidad and Tobago by a score of 41–0, swiftly ending their campaign.\n2000s: the new century.\nBrazil began the 2000s with much more success. In 2000, Brazil easily won the 2000 edition of the SARC; they repeated this in 2001, topping the group of Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela. Brazil advanced to the next round of qualifying, disposing of Trinidad and Tobago; Brazil would go on to lose their final games, but Brazil was finally starting to close the gap. Throughout the 2000s, Brazil began winning more of its games, and in 2008, finally broke through; Brazil beat Paraguay to finally advance to the top flight of the SARC, their first time there since 1989. Brazil further repeated this by beating Paraguay again in 2009.\nIn 2012, the New York Times reported that rugby was Brazil's second fastest growing sport, behind MMA. This is partly due to World Rugby re-investing in Brazil due to the reinstatement of rugby in the 2016 Olympics. Since then, Brazil has been invited to the World Rugby Sevens Series, allowing Brazil to improve against higher competition.\nIn 2014, Brazil recorded its first-ever victory over Chile, defeating the Condores 24 to 16. Since initiatives were taken in 2009, the character of rugby has changed in Brazil; the registration numbers have risen, and the sport has successfully formed sponsorships with companies such as Bradesco, many of whom see Brazilian rugby to be profitable in the future.\nIn 2015, Brazil played two tests against the national team of Germany, one held in Pacaembu Stadium; these performances attracted 10,000 spectators, being one of the highest attendances for rugby in Brazil. Brazil's improved form showed in 2016 in the first edition of the Americas Rugby Championship, where Brazil was on the verge of historic victories against Chile and Uruguay, but could not hold on. After scoring 25 points in their first ever fixture versus Canada, Brazil went on to upset the United States 24–23 in Pacaembu; Brazil proceeded to finish off the tournament losing 7–41 to Argentina, scoring their first try against Argentina in decades.\nFor the 2016 South American Rugby Championship \"A\", RedeTV!, one of Brazil's major TV networks, will air Brazil's games live. Brazil played Uruguay at Allianz Parque in São Paulo, one of the largest stadiums to ever host a rugby game in Brazil. Brazil tied 20–20 against Chile, further signaling their rise to the top in South America. To cap off the tournament, Brazil beat Paraguay 32–21, finishing in third place only behind Chile on points difference.\nBrazil improved in the 2017 edition of the ARC, beating Chile convincingly 17 to 3, before notching their first win in only their second meeting against Canada in Pacaembu, by the score of 24 to 23. After these victories, Brazil rose to 30th, their first time in the top 30 of the World Rugby Rankings since 2009. On November 18, 2017, Brazil won on European soil for the first time in history, defeating Belgium and Portugal, further showing their progress in the 2010s. Brazil's progress continued as they beat Chile on their home soil for the first time in history, and later in the year, in the reformed 2018 South American Rugby Championship, defeated Argentina XV, marking their first-ever victory over an Argentinean side. Brazil would go onto defeat Colombia and was crowned South American champions for the first time in their history.\nUniforms.\nTraditionally, the rugby team of Brazil has worn a strip of a yellow top and green shorts while the away strip consists of a green top and white shorts. The current provider of the kit is local based Topper. In 2015, the shorts were changed to blue, to be consistent with that of Brazil's football team; this included a presentation involving the Tupí tribe, whom the team is nicknamed after. The current shirt sponsor of Brazil is Bradesco.\nNickname.\nFor some time, Brazilian national rugby union side was unofficially associated with Walt Disney's character Zé Carioca. Sometime later, CBRu, still known as Associação Brasileira de Rugby, or simply ABR, chose Vitória Régia as its official emblem and nickname. However, this nickname was not adopted by fans.\nIn March 2012, CBRu announced \"Os Tupis\" as Brazil national rugby union team's official nickname, a reference to Tupi people, the main ethnic group of Brazilian indigenous people. The choice for an emblem started in 2010, when CBRu started receiving e-mails with several suggestions. The three finalists were Tupis, Sucuris (Anacondas) and Araras (Macaws). Fans voted on an Internet poll and chose Tupis with 47% (4,387 votes) of preference. According to CBRu's former president (from 2012-2016), Sami Arap, \"The choice ratified the roots of Brazilian people. Tupi represents the essence of our country, referring to [our] strength, perseverance, loyalty and team spirit\".\nTournament records.\nAmericas Rugby Championship.\nThe Americas Rugby Championship was held in five of the seven years from 2009 to 2015, but Brazil did not participate. Brazil along with Chile has participated in an expanded six-country Americas Rugby Championship in 2016. In the 2016 ARC, 42nd ranked Brazil defeated the 16th ranked United States 24–23, their first win against the United States.\nOverall record.\nBelow is table of the representative rugby matches played by a Brazil national XV at test level up until 18 November 2023.\nCurrent squad.\nBrazil's 26-man squad up for the World Rugby test matches against Zimbabwe and Namibia or Zimbabwe.\nHead Coach: Fernando Portugal\nMedia coverage.\nBefore 2016, most of Brazil's games were aired through SporTV, a paid television network. In 2016, changes were made to Brazil's broadcasting; more commonly available RedeTV! would air games involving the South American Rugby Championship, while ESPN Brasil holds the rights to the Americas Rugby Championship."

Organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, it was the eighth and final ranking event of the 1988–89 snooker season and the thirteenth consecutive World Snooker Championship to be held at the Crucible, the first tournament at this location having taken place in 1977. There were 142 entrants to the competition.\nThe defending champion was Steve Davis, who had previously won the World Championship five times. He met John Parrott in the final, which was a best-of-35- match. Davis won the match 18–3, which remains the biggest winning margin in the sport's modern era, and meant that the final, scheduled for four , finished with a . This was Davis's sixth and last world title, and his last appearance in a World Championship final. Stephen Hendry scored the championship's highest , a 141, in his quarter-final match. There were 19 century breaks compiled during the championship.\nA five-round qualifying event for the championship was held at the Preston Guild Hall from 22 March to 4 April 1989 for 126 players, 16 of whom reached the main stage, where they met the 16 invited seeded players. The tournament was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC, and was sponsored by the Embassy cigarette company. Davis received £105,000 from the total prize fund of £525,000.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual professional snooker tournament organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the cue sport gained popularity in the British Isles in the 1920s and 1930s. In the modern era, which started in 1969 when the World Championship reverted to a knockout format, it has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nJoe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, hosted by the Billiards Association and Control Council, the final match being held at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The 1989 championship featured 32 professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single-elimination format, each round being played over a pre-determined number of , and each match divided into two or more s containing a set number of frames. These competitors in the main tournament were selected using a combination of the top 16 players in the snooker world rankings and the winners of a pre-tournament qualification stage. It was the eighth and final ranking event of the 1988–89 snooker season, and the thirteenth consecutive World Snooker Championship to be held at the Crucible, the first tournament there having taken place in 1977. The defending champion in 1989 was Steve Davis, who had defeated Terry Griffiths 18–11 in the final of the 1988 World Snooker Championship to win his fifth world title.

Davis extended his lead to 5–1, Parrott winning the last frame of the first session to leave Davis 5–2 ahead.\nDavis increased his advantage to 9–2 by winning the first four frames of the evening session on 30 April, recording breaks of 42, 37, 55 and 112, whilst Parrott potted only six balls, totalling 15 points. Parrott led by 44 points in the twelfth frame after constructing a 52 break, but lost the frame after Davis compiled a 62 break. Parrott went after potting a red in the thirteenth frame, allowing Davis the opportunity to win the frame with a break of 59. In the next frame, Davis missed potting the whilst using the , and Parrott made it 3–11 with a break of 68. During the last two frames of the first day, Parrott potted only one red as Davis extended his lead to 13–3, including breaks of 80 and 68.\nAlthough Parrott had chances to win both of the first two frames in the third session, Davis won them both on the pink. With breaks 59 and 38 to add the next two frames, Davis increased his lead to 17–3. Parrott led 40–0 in the 21st frame, before a break of 42 by Davis. Davis won the frame, his 18–3 victory becoming a new record margin of victory in a World Snooker Championship final at the Crucible, surpassing his 18–6 defeat of Thorburn in 1983. It was a third consecutive World Snooker Championship win for Davis, and his sixth title, to equal Reardon's total since the competition was re-launched in 1969. The match ended with a , and the pair played an exhibition match at the venue in place of the last session.\nParrott said afterwards that \"Me not playing anything like, and Steve playing exceptionally well, that's a recipe for 18–3.\" Davis remarked that \"A month before the championship I wasn't playing well enough to beat players like Hendry and Parrott. To actually pull out all the stops and produce the standard of play that I have must rate as one of my greatest achievements. I've played the best snooker of my career.\" The two players occupied the top places in the 1989/1990 world rankings, calculated based on results from the previous two seasons; Davis retaining first position with 64 points, followed by Parrott on 48. Parrott later won the 1991 World Snooker Championship title, whilst 1989 was the last world final reached by Davis.\nIn his 1989 book \"Snooker: Records, Facts and Champions\", Ian Morrison wrote \"Don't let the scoreline lead you to believe that Parrott did not do justice to the occasion. But simply, no man could have lived with Davis the way he played at the Crucible in 1989.\" Snooker historian Clive Everton, who played in the qualifying rounds of the tournament, reflected in 2012 that after the 1989 tournament, despite Davis having lost the 1985 and 1986 championship finals, \"such was his dominance that it would have been impossible to predict with confidence that [Davis] would never win the title again.\" Authors Luke Williams and Paul Gadsby claimed that \"It is ironic, then, that in the wake of his most dominant World Championship triumph, Davis's career almost immediately headed into decline,\" and that Davis's losses to Hendry in the finals of the 1989 UK Championship and the 1990 UK Championship \"symbolised a monumental power shift in the game.\"\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for the tournament.

Organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), it was the sixth and final ranking event of the 1987–88 snooker season and the twelfth consecutive World Snooker Championship to be held at the Crucible, the first tournament there having taken place in 1977.\nA five-round qualifying event for the championship was held at the Preston Guild Hall from 22 March to 2 April 1988 for 113 players, 16 of whom reached the main stage, where they met the 16 invited seeded players. The tournament was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC, and was sponsored by the Embassy cigarette company. The winner received £95,000 from the total prize fund of £475,000.\nThe defending champion was Steve Davis, who had previously won the World Championship four times. He met the 1979 champion Terry Griffiths in the final, which was a best-of-35- match. Davis won the match 18–11 after the pair had been level at 8–8 at the end of the first day of the final. Steve James scored the championship's highest , a 140, in his first-round match. There were 18 century breaks compiled during the championship.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual professional snooker tournament organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the cue sport gained popularity in the British Isles in the 1920s and 1930s. In the modern era, which started in 1969 when the World Championship reverted to a knockout format, it has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nJoe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, organised by the Billiards Association and Control Council, the final match being held at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The 1988 championship featured 32 professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single-elimination format, each match played over several . These competitors in the main tournament were selected using a combination of the top players in the snooker world rankings and the winners of a pre-tournament qualification stage that took place at Preston Guild Hall from 22 March to 2 April 1988. The qualifying competition consisted of five knockout rounds, all contested as the best-of-19-frames, including a single preliminary round match. There were 113 players involved in the qualifying competition, which produced 16 players who each faced one of the top 16 players in the world rankings in the first round of the main event. The rounds held at the Crucible Theatre were broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC. The 1988 championship was sponsored by cigarette brand Embassy, and was also referred to as the Embassy World Snooker Championship.\nPrize fund.\nThe tournament featured a total prize fund of £475,000, with £95,000 being awarded to the winner. The prize money allocation is shown below. An award of £90,000 would have been made to a player making a maximum break.\nTournament summary.\nQualifying.\nQualifying matches took place at Preston Guild Hall from 22 March to 2 April 1988. The qualifying competition consisted of five knockout rounds, including a single preliminary round match, starting with 113 players, and all qualifying matches were played as best-of-19-frames. American pool player Steve Mizerak made his professional snooker debut in the preliminary round, losing 3–10 to Anthony Harris. On the first day of the qualifying competition, Billy Kelly established a new record highest for world championship qualifying, compiling a 141 in the sixth frame of his match against Tony Kearney. Kelly won 10–4, concluding with a 76 break in the 14th frame. Alain Robidoux had walkovers against Frank Jonik, who withdrew due to problems with his back, and Robbie Grace, who was unable to travel from South Africa, which meant Robidoux earned a ranking merit point that enabled him to gain full professional status for the following season. He lost 2–10 to Bill Oliver in the third round.\nDene O'Kane, a quarter-finalist in 1987, led 9–8 against Eddie Sinclair but lost 9–10. Oliver eliminated six-time champion Ray Reardon 10–4 before losing 6–10 to Cliff Wilson. It was the first time in his career that Reardon had failed to qualify for the main event. Returning to snooker after a four-month absence during which he had been treated in a Canadian clinic for cocaine addiction, Kirk Stevens defeated Mark Bennett 10–7. Eight-time champion Fred Davis, aged 74, progressed past Jack Fitzmaurice, 10–8, and Jim Bear, 10–4, before losing 3–10 to John Campbell in the last qualifying round. John Spencer, three-times world champion, was eliminated 7–10 by Warren King at the same stage.\nFour players, Steve James, Bob Chaperon, Tony Drago and Peter Francisco, qualified for the main event for the first time. James received a walkover against Terry Whitthread in the first round, and eliminated Joe O'Boye, Paddy Browne and Eugene Hughes; Chaperon defeated Robert Marshall, Tommy Murphy and David Taylor; Drago won against Tony Chappel; and Francisco eliminated Robby Foldvari.\nFirst round.\nThe first round took place between 16 and 21 April, each match played over two as the best of 19 frames. Davis, who had won three of the five ranking events during the season leading up to the world championship, was Coral bookmakers' pre-tournament favourite to win, with odds of 5/4. Stephen Hendry, winner of the other two ranking tournaments, was the second favourite at 4/1. They were followed by Jimmy White at 8/1 and John Parrott at 10/1.\nDavis won a closely contested match against John Virgo, finally prevailing 10–8. Mike Hallett was 8–1 ahead of Chaperon at the end of their first session, and completed a 10–2 victory. Alex Higgins, who won the competition in 1972 and 1982, had been banned (in April 1987) from the first two ranking events of the season, as part of a punishment imposed by the WPBSA for behaviour including headbutting the tournament director at the 1986 UK Championship. He trailed Drago 2–7 after their first session, and after being defeated 2–10, lost his place in the elite top 16 of the snooker world rankings for the first time since rankings were introduced in 1976. The 1985 champion Taylor was 4–5 behind to Bill Werbeniuk as their first session ended. After their second session the following morning was stopped due to over-running as a result of lengthy tactical exchanges and several delays while Werbeniuk visited the toilet during frames, eventually prevailed 10–8 when it was reconvened. This was Werbeniuk's last appearance at the World Snooker Championship finals.\nJoe Johnson, champion in 1986 and runner-up in 1987, knocked out Wilson 10–7. Nine days after suffering a serious road traffic accident that wrote off his car, James compiled a break of 140, and another of 104, on his way to defeating Rex Williams 10–6. In the opening frame against King, Parrott produced a break of 80, which turned out to be his only break above 40 as he won 10–4. Cliff Thorburn, the champion in 1980 and the first player to make a maximum break in the championship, in 1983, was only able to compete after his lawyers managed to postpone a disciplinary hearing relating to his failed drug test at the 1988 British Open. He eliminated Stevens, who had undergone voluntary treatment for cocaine addiction and fell from fourth place to outside the top 32 in the rankings during the season. Thorburn won the match 10–6.\nFrom 3–3 against Wayne Jones, Neal Foulds led 6–3 at the end of the first session and progressed by winning 10–7. Doug Mountjoy recorded a 10–6 win against Barry West, and Willie Thorne won by the same score against Peter Francisco. Steve Longworth won only a single frame as he went out 1–10 to the 1979 champion Terry Griffiths.\nTony Knowles eliminated Danny Fowler 10–8. Silvino Francisco made breaks of 91, 109 and 105 against Eddie Charlton in their first session, but still ended it 4–5 behind. Charlton, playing with a cue stick that he had only started using earlier that year, won 10–7. Hendry led Dean Reynolds 6–3 and 7–6, taking the last three frames to progress at 10–6. After winning the first seven frames against Campbell, White achieved a 10–3 victory.\nSecond round.\nThe second round, which took place between 21 and 25 April, was played as best-of-25-frames matches spread over three sessions. Davis finished a 13–1 defeat of Hallett with a break of 106. This result matched the heaviest defeat ever recorded in the world snooker championship at the Crucible, Davis's 18–6 victory over Thorburn in the 1983 final. Drago, having defeated a former world champion in the first round, knocked out another in the second round, winning 13–5 against Dennis Taylor. James compiled a break of 112 in the last frame of the first session against Johnson and led 7–1. During the second session, he increased this to 11–3. Johnson won the last two frames of the second session, and the first four frames of the third session, before James took two consecutive frames to qualify 13–9. Thorburn defeated Parrott 13–10, after the pair had been level at 6–6 and 7–7.\nFoulds equaled Davis's record for an emphatic victory at the Crucible, and had a break of 102, eliminating Mountjoy 13–1; Mountjoy's failure to progress further meant that he lost his place in the top 16 of the rankings. Griffiths reached the quarter-finals for the fifth year in succession, going from 9–9 to 13–9 against Thorne and concluding with a 101 break in the 22nd frame. Knowles led Charlton 12–4 as they started the third session, and won 13–7.\nWhite finished the first session against Hendry 5–3 ahead, the pair both preferring attempts to pot balls rather than play shots. White added the first frame of the second session, before Hendry won six frames in a row, including breaks of 52, 79, 125, 56 and 101, thus led 9–6. White took the final frame of the second session. In the third session, Hendry claimed the first frame to lead 10–7. White replied with breaks of 62, 50, 78 and 71, to take the lead at 11–10.

In the 16th frame, Davis himself while on a break of 61, and Drago recovered to win that frame. The third session consisted of a single frame, as Davis completed a 13–4 victory. After the eight frames of the first session between Thorburn and James, the score was 4–4. James, who the bookmakers had rated a 500/1 outsider to win the tournament at the start, was still level at 6–6 but lost 11–13. During the match, he compiled a break of 103, his fourth century break of the competition.\nGriffiths reached the quarter-finals for the first time since he won the title in 1979 by eliminating Foulds 13–9, having been 1–3 behind. White lost the opening frame but took a 7–1 lead over Knowles in their first session. After extending this lead to 10–2, White later commented \"I did the worst thing possible. I started playing to the crowd.\" Knowles won four consecutive frames, compiling a break of 124 in the process, to trail 6–10. White responded by winning the next three to progress 13–6.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals took place between 28 and 30 April as best-of-31-frames matches played over four sessions.

Thorburn led by 57 points in the twentieth frame but conceded 4 points by accidentally missing the red balls when playing a safety shot, and Davis compiled a break of 54 to clinch the frame by a single point, finishing the session 14–8 ahead after winning the last two frames. Davis won the first two frames of the fourth session to complete a 16–8 victory.\nWhite won the first two frames against Griffiths, compiling a break of 83 in the second, and made it 3–1 after Griffiths had won the third frame. Griffiths reduced White's advantage to one frame with a fifth frame break of 114. In the next frame, Griffiths missed a red to allow White in and gain the frame. Griffiths won the following two frames and the first session ended level at 4–4. During the second session, White compiled breaks of 44, 77, and 83 while gaining a 7–6 lead.

It was Davis's sixth successive final, and Griffith's first since his win in 1979. Davis had won fifteen of the previous nineteen matches between the pair. Griffiths won the first frame before missing an easy in the second frame that allowed Davis in to equalise at 1–1. Davis then won the next four frames, Griffiths taking the last frame of the first afternoon session to finish it 2–5 behind. In the second session, Griffiths won the first frame after a break of 34. Davis followed this by taking the next two frames with breaks of 83 and 81 to lead 7–3. Griffiths equalised at 7–7, making breaks of 30, 49, 63 and 55. Davis took the lead back with a break of 66 in the 15th frame, but a fluke on a red by Griffiths and a later miss on a red by Davis contributed to Griffiths equalising at 8–8 at the session's end.\nDavis missed some easy pots at the start of the third session, but still won the first three frames to lead 11–8 as Griffiths made several errors.

A break of 57 by Griffiths won him a frame to reduce Davis's lead to 13–10, and he led 41–0 in the next frame before Davis compiled a 92 break to lead 14–10 at the end of the session.\nIn the fourth session, Davis won the opening frame after making a break of 46, and then won two of the next three frames with breaks of 118 and 123. In the 29th frame, Griffiths missed a black from its spot, and Davis went on to win the frame with a break of 66 and take the title, achieving victory at 18–11.\nClive Everton, who played in the qualifying rounds of the tournament, wrote in \"The Guardian\" that, despite Griffiths equalising at 7–7 by winning four consecutive frames, \"it was not a vintage final.\" \"The Benson and Hedges Snooker Year\" report of the championship concluded that \"The final was never a classic but merely emphasized Davis's superiority and grip on the world of professional snooker.\" Griffiths, who was the oldest world snooker championship finalist since Reardon in 1982, said \"My long potting got me to the final. But in the end it let me down. Steve's safety is so good that you have to make the long potting count and I didn't which was the most disappointing part of my performance in the final.\" This was Davis's fifth world championship win, leaving him one behind Reardon's record total of six titles in the modern era. Davis commented \"You are always delighted to win a world championship, and I'm not thinking about records. All I know is I keep coming back to the World Championship, which is two and a half weeks of agony and turmoil and trauma.\"\nIt was Davis's fourth win in six ranking tournaments in the 1987–88 snooker season, a period in which he also won the 1988 Masters and the 1988 Irish Masters, and he became first player to win all of the snooker \"Triple Crown\" events in a single season. His prize money earnings for the season were £425,000, and he retained his top position in the end-of-year rankings with 59 points, ahead of White in second on 44 points. Griffiths, with 33 points, was fifth, one place higher than in the previous ranking list.\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for each round.

Tournament debutants Steve Davis and Kirk Stevens both achieved 9–1 wins, against Ian Anderson and Roy Amdor respectively.\nIn the qualifying round, Virgo won the last four frames, which included a break of 120 in frame 15, to eliminate Thorne 9–8. In a match that lasted over nine hours, David Taylor won the deciding frame against Dunning. Stevens whitewashed former champion John Pulman. In the other matches, Bill Werbeniuk defeated Andrewartha 9–2, Doug Mountjoy won 9–6 against Houlihan, Davis eliminated Patsy Fagan 9–2, Jim Meadowcroft lost 6–9 to Griffiths, and Rex Williams lost 5–9 to Graham Miles. Davis, Griffiths, and Stevens all qualified for the Crucible stage for the first time.\nFirst round.\nBefore the main competition started, Coral made Reardon their bookmaker's favourite, at odds of 2–1, followed by Eddie Charlton at 5–1, and John Spencer and Alex Higgins who were each priced at 6–1. The first round took place between 16 and 20 April, with matches scheduled three over sessions as the best of 25 frames. Fred Davis made a break of 109, the first century break in that year's main competition, to level at 3–3 with Stevens, but finished their first session 3–5 behind. Aged 65 years and 247 days, he became the oldest ever player to win a match at the Crucible when he defeated Stevens 13–8.\nWerbeniuk defeated Spencer 13–11, and said that he was treating a nerve-related trembling in his cue arm by drinking lager. Cliff Thorburn, runner-up in 1977, compiled a break of 125 in the second session against Virgo, but lost the match 10–13. David Taylor, who had defeated Higgins earlier in the season at the 1978 UK Championship, lost 5–13 to him. Charlton made a 95 break to complete a 13–6 win against Mountjoy. Defending champion Reardon trailed Miles 3–5 after their first session, but then won eight of the nine frames in the second session. Griffiths defeated Mans 13–8, and Steve Davis lost 11–13 to Dennis Taylor. \nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played as best-of-25-frames matches over three sessions between 19 and 21 April. Higgins made breaks of 105 and 112 in the second and third frames respectively of his match against Griffiths, and finished the first session leading 6–2.

Griffiths took the final frame with a 107 break to win won 13–12; it was the third world championship in a row where Higgins was defeated in a deciding frame.\nCharlton defeated Fred Davis 13–4, after taking a 5–0 lead. Davis compiled a 110 break in the eighth frame. Reardon took an early lead of 5–2 against Dennis Taylor; the players were later level at 7–7 when Reardon was distracted by applause from spectators at the other table at the venue, and missed an attempt to pot a brown. Taylor won that frame, and the next, to lead 9–7 after two sessions. He won only one further frame, as Taylor achieved victory at 13–8. Virgo built an 8–1 lead against Webeniuk in their first session, and was six frames clear after the second session, at 11–5. Werbeniuk won the initial frame of the third session, and in the next frame equalled the record championship break of 142 that had been set by Williams in 1965. The prize money for the tournament's highest break was £500, whilst beating the record would have earnt an additional £5,000. Werbeniuk received a further £500 donated jointly from tournament promoter Watterson, Harmsworth, manufacturers of the cloth used on the snooker tables at the event, and tournament table makers Karnehm and Hillman. Virgo won 13–9.\nSemi-finals and third place playoff.\nThe semi-finals took place between 22 and 25 April as best-of-37-frames matches played over four sessions. Griffiths recorded a 101 break in the second frame against Charlton, and after leading 4–3 after one session, increased his advantage during the second session to 10–4. Despite a highest break of just 46, Charlton won the next six frames to draw level. Griffiths won the last frame of the second day to take an 11–10 lead into the concluding day; at the close of the fifth session he was two frames up, at 15–13. The last session ended at 1:40a.m., having taken five hours and 25 minutes to play, and set a record for the latest finish of any match. This duration was just eight minutes less than the longest world championship session on record, which occurred during Reardon and Fred Davis's match in 1969. Charlton led for the first time in the match at 16–15, and was again a frame ahead at 17–16. Griffiths took the next two frames, and completed his passage into the final at 19–17 after Charlton, who was leading by 48 points, missed an attempt to pot a red while using the . Griffiths compiled a 97 break to secure victory. In a post-match interview with David Vine, Griffiths said \"I'm in the final now, you know\", with what snooker historian Clive Everton described as \"an engaging mixture of pride and disbelief\".\nTaylor led after each session against Virgo, with his three frame advantage after the initial session increasing by an additional frame after each of the following three sessions, from 5–2 to 9–5, 13–8, and 17–11. According to \"Snooker Scene\", Taylor displayed the \"more mature match temperament\" throughout, while Virgo \"fumed visibly\" after he made errors or was unlucky. Taylor won 19–12.\nCharlton defeated Virgo 7–3 in the third-place playoff match.\nFinal.\nThe final, between Dennis Taylor and Terry Griffiths, took place from 26 to 28 April, as a best-of-47 frames match scheduled over six sessions, and was refereed by John Williams. Griffiths three times in four shots during the first frame, but won it on the final . Griffiths led 3–1 when in the fifth frame he recorded a break of 120 which broke down on the final ; had he potted the four remaining colours he would have equalled the championship record break of 142. Having increased his lead to 5–1 before the last frame of the first session, he made a break of 65 in the seventh frame, but Taylor countered with a 71 break win the frame on the final and make it 5–2. In the second session, Griffiths took the 15th frame after the pair had been tied at 7–7. The next day, Taylor took an 11–9 lead, and later led 14-12, before Griffiths won twelve of the following 14 frames. With the pair level at 15-15 at the start of the final day of play, Griffiths added two of the next three frames for a 17–16 lead, then won seven consecutive frames, to secure victory at 24–16.\nGriffiths became the first qualifier to win the title at the Crucible. After the match, he commented that he \"didn't really feel I was playing for the championship until the last day...Once I saw the winning post, Dennis did seem to fade a bit.\" Fred Davis hailed Griffith's victory as \"the greatest achievement the game's ever known\", adding that for a player without experience of long matches to win the title was \"just remarkable\". Everton wrote that Griffiths was \"the first authentic television age champion, a working class hero\".\nMain draw.\nThe results for the tournament are shown below.

        "text": "The men's épée was one of four fencing events on the Fencing at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme. The competition was held from 17 to 24 July 1908 at the Franco-British Exhibition fencing grounds. There were 85 competitors from 13 nations. Each nation could enter up to 12 fencers. The medals were swept by the French fencers, who also took the gold medal in the team épée event. Gaston Alibert was the gold medalist, with Alexandre Lippmann taking silver and Eugene Olivier bronze. Officially, it was the second consecutive medal sweep in the event, though two of the three \"Cuban\" fencers who medaled in 1904 were actually American.\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nNone of the five fencers from 1904 returned.\nBohemia, Canada, Denmark, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, and Sweden each made their debut in the event. Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, and Italy each appeared for the second time, matching Cuba and the United States (both absent for the first time) for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was held over four rounds. In each round, each pool held a round-robin, with bouts to 1 touch. Double-touches counted as touches against both fencers. Barrages were used as necessary to determine the advancing fencers.\nResults.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was conducted in round-robin format, to one touch. Pool sizes ranged from 5 to 8 fencers. Double-touches counted against both fencers. The three contestants who had been struck the fewest times advanced.\nPool A.\nFildes and von Rosen had a double-touch, as did Stöhr and Fildes.\nPool B.\nDouble-touches were between Gates and van Schreven, Jack and Gates, and Collignon and van Schreven.\nPool C.\nBlake and Dwinger had the only double-touch in this six-man pool.\nPool D.\nThe fourth pool had 8 fencers. Berger was clearly the best of the crowd, going untouched in his seven bouts. When five different fencers tied for second place at 4 touches against apiece, a playoff round-robin was held. The first playoff eliminated only one fencer, with the remaining four again tying and forcing a second playoff. That round resulted in Holt and Tvrzský tying at 1 touch apiece, eliminating the other two fencers.\nBergsland was hit three times, finishing sixth overall in the pool while the other four fencers in the playoff each received two hits to advance to a second playoff.\nHolt and Tvrzský tied for an overall second-place finish in the pool with one touch against apiece (Tvrzský won the bout between the two, but was himself hit by Diana). Becker and Diana placed fourth.\nPool E.\nThe fifth pool also included 8 fencers, but did not require a playoff. The only touch against Alibert came in a double-touch with van Löben Sels.\nPool F.\nThe sixth competition pool was smaller, with only 6 fencers.\nPool G.\nThe Official Report says only that Bosmans defeated Dubourdieu and Schön in the playoff, without giving further detail.\nPool H.\nThe single bout between Rodocanachi and Chalmers to break the tie for third resulted in a win for the Frenchman.\nPool I.\nThe ninth pool was the first of the second day of competition, 18 July.\nMangiarotti was defeated in the three-way playoff for the two remaining advancement spots.\nPool K.\nThe eleventh pool was the smallest, with only 5 fencers.\nIn the playoff for the second and third spots, le Blon and Haig advanced. Okker was eliminated.\nPool M.\nThe final pool also had only 5 fencers.\nQuarterfinals.\nSeven of the eight second round pools had 5 fencers, with the eighth having only 4. 2 advanced to the semifinals from each pool.\nQuarterfinal 1.\nDoorman again lost to Stern in the playoff bout.\nQuarterfinal 2.\nRenard won the playoff pool, with no further details given in the Official Report.\nQuarterfinal 3.\nAlibert continued on his perfect streak, winning four more bouts untouched.\nBerger won the playoff, defeating von Lobsdorf again.\nQuarterfinal 4.\nMontgomerie won against Gravier and Tvrzský in the three-way playoff for the second semifinal spot.\nQuarterfinal 7.\nLabouchere won the three-way playoff for second place and a semifinal spot.\nSemifinals.\nThere were two semifinals, each of 8 fencers. The top 4 in each advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 1.\nAlibert was hit twice, both in double-touches.\nFinal.\nThe final resulted in Alibert taking the championship after again hitting all opponents, though he suffered another pair of double-touches. There was a three-way tie for second place between two Frenchman and Montgomerie of the British team.\nThe playoff pool for second and third resulted in wins for the two French fencers, completing France's medal sweep in the event."

        "title": "Swimming at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre freestyle",
        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle was one of six swimming events on the swimming at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme. It was the shortest of the three individual freestyle events, as the 50 yard freestyle had been dropped after its one appearance on the 1904 Summer Olympics programme. The 100 metre event was contested for the third time after it had been held at the 1896 and 1906 Olympics. The 1904 Olympics saw a 100-yard event. The competition was held on Friday 17 July 1908 and Monday 20 July 1908. Thirty-four swimmers from twelve nations competed. Each nation was limited to 12 swimmers.\nThe event was won by Charles Daniels of the United States, the first time Hungary had been beaten in the event (excluding Intercalated Games). Zoltán Halmay of Hungary, the winner in 1900, finished second. Harald Julin's bronze was Sweden's first medal in the event.\nThese were the first Olympic Games in which a 100-metre pool had been especially constructed (inside the main stadium's track and field oval). Previous Olympic events were swum in open water (1896: The Mediterranean Sea, 1900: The Seine River, 1904: an artificial lake).\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle (including the 100 yard event in 1904 but excluding the Intercalated Games in 1906). The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nTwo of the six finalists from 1904 returned: gold medalist Zoltán Halmay of Hungary and silver medalist Charles Daniels of the United States. Daniels had beaten Halmay at the 1906 Intercalated Games. Halmay held the world record.\nAustralasia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden each made their debut in the event. Hungary and the United States each made their third appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nWith a much larger field than in 1904, the 1908 competition expanded to three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The 1908 Games also restored the wild-card system from 1900, allowing the fastest swimmers who did not win their heat to advance. The nine heats consisted of between 1 and 6 swimmers, with the winner of the heat advancing along with the fastest loser from across the heats (all tied swimmers advanced in the case of equal times). There were two semifinals, intended to be of 5 swimmers each but one of which actually had 6 due to a tie in the heats; the top 2 finishers in each semifinal (regardless of overall time) advanced to the 4-person final.\nEach race involved a single length of the 100 metre pool, with no turns. Any stroke could be used.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in minutes) prior to the 1908 Summer Olympics.\n\"(*)\" Intercalated Games\n\"(**)\" 100 yards (91.44 m)\nIn the first heat Zoltán Halmay set a new Olympic record with 1:08.2. In the fifth heat Charles Daniels and in the seventh heat Wilfred Edwards equalized the standing world record of 1:05.8. Finally Charles Daniels set a new world record with 1:05.6 in the final.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe fastest swimmer in each heat and the fastest loser advanced. Because there was a tie for fastest loser, both men advanced. Thus, 11 swimmers qualified for the semifinals.\nHeat 8.\nDockrell had no competition in the eighth heat.\nSemifinals.\nThe fastest two swimmers from each semifinal advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nHalmay started fast, leading for the first 30 metres until he was caught by Daniels. Daniels took a slight lead at the halfway mark and won by half a yard."

        "text": "Jerome Byron Allen (born January 28, 1973) is an American former professional basketball player and college head coach. He is the former head coach for the University of Pennsylvania men's basketball team, until resigning after the 2014–15 season. He most recently served as an assistant coach for the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nEarly life.\nAllen was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on January 28, 1973. His family struggled to make ends meet, and he lived with 18 relatives in a five-bedroom home, sharing a bed with his sister. Some of his family members sold crack cocaine, and his father left his family at age 10. He attended public school in his youth but attended Episcopal Academy for high school. He became one of the top high school basketball players in the country at Episcopal, receiving scholarship offers at 16 schools. He chose to attend Penn to study accounting at the Wharton School; he had planned on being an accountant in his youth.\nCollege playing career.\nAllen was a four-year starter at Penn alongside future NBA players Matt Maloney and Ira Bowman. Allen and the Quakers were undefeated from his freshman season to his junior season in the Ivy League. The team's 48-game conference winning streak is the best in Ivy League history. He averaged 13.7 points per game in his career for Penn.\nProfessional playing career.\nMinnesota Timberwolves.\nAllen was selected 49th overall (2nd round, pick 20) by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1995 NBA draft. Until Miye Oni was selected in 2019, Allen was the most recent Ivy League player to be drafted to the NBA. He played 41 games for the Timberwolves, averaging 2.6 points per game in 8.8 minutes per game.\nIndiana Pacers.\nAllen signed with the Indiana Pacers for the 1996 NBA season. He played 51 games, averaging about 3 points in 14 minutes per game. He did not finish the season with the Pacers.\nDenver Nuggets.\nAllen signed with the Denver Nuggets and played 25 games to finish the 1996 NBA season.\nEurope.\nAllen also spent time in France, Italy (with Lottomatica Roma, Carpisa Napoli and Snaidero Udine), Greece, Spain and Turkey.\nCoaching career.\nPenn Quakers.\nIn 2009, he became an assistant coach for the University of Pennsylvania's men's basketball team. On December 14, 2009, Allen was named interim head coach of the Penn men's basketball team after the firing of Glen Miller. On March 31, 2010, he was announced as the new permanent head coach of the Penn Men's Basketball team. He resigned his position as head coach effective on March 10, 2015.\nBoston Celtics.\nAllen joined the Boston Celtics in 2015 under head coach Brad Stevens. Allen was one of Boston's longer-tenured assistants and was with the team for all but two seasons of the Brad Stevens era.\nDetroit Pistons.\nIn summer 2021, Allen announced he was leaving the Celtics' coaching staff to join Dwane Casey in Detroit.\nBribery case and related NCAA sanctions.\nIn October 2018, Allen pleaded guilty to accepting an $18,000 bribe in 2014 while the head coach at Penn to help a student get on the recruiting list in order to get accepted to the university. He was ordered to pay back $18,000 in addition to a $200,000 fine. He would testify on behalf of the federal government against the man he said had bribed him – Phillip Esformes. During Esformes's trial, Allen testified that he had received about $300,000 in bribes from Esformes, and that the student in question was Esformes's son.\nOn February 26, 2020, the NCAA announced penalties against Allen and the Penn men's basketball program stemming from the bribes. The program was placed on two years' probation but did not receive a postseason ban. Allen received a 15-year show-cause penalty from the NCAA, effective until February 20, 2035. It is the longest ever handed down to a (former) head coach. During this period, any school that hires Allen must \"show cause\" for why it should not be sanctioned for doing so. In an unusual move, if Allen gets a head coaching job after the show-cause expires, he must sit out the first half of the first season of his return. It is very difficult for a head coach to return to the collegiate ranks even after a show-cause expires, since many presidents and athletic directors are extremely reluctant to hire someone with a show-cause on his record. Only four coaches have ever worked in college basketball again after receiving a show-cause."

He was drafted by the New England Patriots in the third round of the 2006 NFL Draft, and also played for the New Orleans Saints. He played college football at Texas.\nEarly years.\nThomas attended Frenship High School in Wolfforth, Texas, and helped Frenship reach the state semi-finals in its division in 2000. Thomas excelled at linebacker, running back and tight end for the Tigers, leading to speculation about what his role would be as a college player. After a heated recruiting battle with Texas Tech University, the University of Texas secured a commitment from Thomas to play tight end for the Longhorns.\nCollege career.\nAt Texas, Thomas broke school records for receptions, touchdowns, and yards by a tight end, as well as for receptions in a single game. He was also a candidate for the John Mackey Award, given to the nation's best tight end, and for the Draddy Trophy, for academic merit by a student athlete. In both 2004 and 2005 Thomas was named to the Academic All-Big 12 First-team for accomplishments in the classroom. Long a favorite target of quarterback Vince Young, Thomas played a prominent role in the Longhorns' 41–38 National Championship upset of then No. 1 USC in the 2006 Rose Bowl, hauling in a game-high 10 receptions for 88 yards. He majored in kinesiology.\nProfessional career.\nNew England Patriots.\nThomas was drafted by the New England Patriots in the third round of the 2006 NFL Draft. In the first 14 games of his rookie 2006 season, Thomas had only six receptions for a total of 76 yards, though three of those catches were for first downs (including his first two NFL completions which went for 29 and 11 yards, respectively). His breakout game came against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 16 when, filling in for an injured Benjamin Watson, Thomas caught five passes for a total of 83 yards, including his first NFL touchdown on a 22-yard pass from Tom Brady.\nThomas suffered a foot injury during the Patriots' 2007 offseason conditioning program and was placed on the team's Active/Physically Unable to Perform list for training camp and the preseason. After catching only one pass in one game played for the 2007 season, Thomas was placed on injured reserve by the Patriots on October 3, 2007 in what was suspected to be a re-aggravation of the foot injury he suffered before the start of the season. The Patriots went undefeated during the season while Thomas was absent until losing to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII.\nIn 2008, Thomas started 10 games as part of a two-tight end formation that also included Watson, who started 9 games. Thomas had nine catches during the season for 93 yards, but none after November 2. He was also a healthy inactive in a December 7 game against the Seattle Seahawks.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nThomas was traded to the New Orleans Saints on September 5, 2009 in exchange for a sixth-round draft choice in the 2011 NFL Draft. He had 35 receptions during the 2009 season, a career-high. The Saints would go on to win Super Bowl XLIV after defeating the Indianapolis Colts 31-17. In the Super Bowl, Thomas had 1 catch for 9 yards. On February 19, 2013, it was announced that the Saints had terminated Thomas' contract."

Competitions were first organized in the early 1960s, and the Tripura Cricket Association was formed in 1968.\nTripura entered the Ranji Trophy, along with Goa and Himachal Pradesh, when the competition was expanded for the 1985–86 season. They have always been one of the weaker sides in the competition. Up to the end of the 2022–23 season, they had played 193 first-class matches resulting in nine wins, 120 losses and 64 draws. In List A cricket they had played 138 matches resulting in 26 wins, 111 losses and one no-result.\nIn 1985–86, fielding a team with no previous first-class experience, Tripura lost all four matches, the first three by an innings. In 1986–87 they drew their first match and lost the next three, two of them by an innings. The pattern continued. In 2001–02, their last season playing only against their East Zone neighbours – Assam, Bengal, Bihar and Orissa – Tripura lost two matches by an innings and drew the other two.\nThe Ranji Trophy was restructured for the 2002–03 season, and the lower-ranked teams from around India began to play each other. Tripura's fortunes improved only slightly at first. They registered two losses by an innings and three draws in 2002–03. In 2003–04 they drew all five matches, gaining a first-innings lead in two of them. In 2004–05 they lost three and drew two.\nTripura's first-class victories.\nTripura won their first first-class victory in the 2005–06 season. Until then they had played 87 matches for 65 losses and 22 draws. In their last match of the season, after two draws and two losses, they played Himachal Pradesh at Maharaja Bir Bikram College Stadium in Agartala, Tripura's main home ground.

Up to and including that fixture, they had played 171 first-class matches, winning only nine of them. However, in the following month, they were dismissed for 35 runs in their first innings against Rajasthan.

In a 12-season career, Young posted a .258 batting average with 144 home runs and 606 RBI in 1205 games played.\nIn 1999 Young became only the third first baseman in the history of the game to have more than 25 home runs, 40 doubles, 20 stolen bases, 100 runs scored, and 100 RBI in a single season. At the time of his retirement in 2003, 11 seasons into their streak of 20 consecutive losing seasons which lasted from 1993 to 2012, he was the last remaining player to leave the Pittsburgh Pirates who had played on a winning team with the club (their last winning season before the streak was in 1992, which was his rookie year).\nOriginally selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the seventh round of the 1990 MLB draft and spent 11 MLB seasons playing for the Pirates.

        "text": "The Portugal national rugby union team (), nicknamed Os Lobos (\"The Wolves\"), represents Portugal in men's international rugby union competitions. The team, as well as all rugby union in Portugal, is administered by the Federação Portuguesa de Rugby.\nPortugal have experienced modest success in the last two decades. They qualified for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France and though they lost all their matches, they managed to score one try in each game and led against Romania until the late minutes. Portugal qualified for their second Rugby World Cup in 2022, topping a repechage qualifying group featuring the United States, Hong Kong, and Kenya to qualify for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. In that edition of the tournament, Portugal got their first competition points in a Rugby World Cup when they drew Georgia 18-18. Later on in the tournament, they got their first ever win in the Rugby World Cup when they beat Fiji 24-23 thanks to a late try from Rodrigo Marta.\nHistory.\nEarly.\nPortugal played its first ever rugby international in April 1935 against Spain, losing by a single point, 6–5. They played Spain again the following year with Spain winning 16–9. Portugal had more regular competition from the mid-1960s, and won their first game in 1966, defeating Spain 9–3. Portugal played Italy for the first time in 1967, losing 6–3. They also had their first match against Romania soon after and lost by 40 points. They defeated Belgium in 1968, and also played Morocco for the first time.\nThe first game of the 1970s was a draw against the Netherlands. Portugal managed to draw with Italy (nil all) in 1972 and following that, defeated them 9–6 in 1973. After a number of mixed results throughout the early 1970s, Portugal won five matches in a row from 1979 through to 1981. They played Morocco, who won the encounter. After a 1983 draw against Spain, Portugal managed a seven-game winning streak from 1984 to 1985, including wins over Belgium, Denmark, Morocco, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Zimbabwe. The first Rugby World Cup was held in 1987, though it was by invitation, thus there was no qualifying tournament and Portugal did not participate.\n1990s.\nFrom 1989 to 1990, the 1991 World Cup qualifiers were held for the European nations. Portugal started in Round 2b in October 1989. They defeated Czechoslovakia 15 to 13 in Ricant to advance to Round 2c. However here they were defeated by the Netherlands 32–3 and eliminated from qualifying.\nPortugal again participated in the 1995 World Cup qualifying competition for European teams, starting in Round 1. They were pooled in the West Group, and defeated Belgium and Switzerland, but lost to Spain, advancing into Round 2. Here Wales defeated them, and they lost to Spain.\nPortugal began in Pool 3 of Round B in the European qualifying competition for the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Portugal won all their group matches, except for the one against Spain, and still finished second in the group, which took them into Pool 3 of Round C. All games were held in Edinburgh, Scotland. Portugal lost 85–11 to Scotland, and 21–17 to Spain. Both Scotland and Spain went through to the World Cup; Portugal went into repechage, where Portugal lost a home and away series to Uruguay.\n2000s.\nIn 2002, Portugal began playing for a place in the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Pool A of Round 3 of the European qualifying tournament. They were grouped with Spain and Poland. Each nation only won one game, though on for and against Portugal finished second to Spain. Portugal were knocked out of competition. In 2003–04, Portugal won the European Nations Cup, losing only one match to win their first championship. In 2004, Professor Tomaz Morais, coach of the Portugal national team at both sevens and fifteen a side, was nominated for the IRB's coach of the year award. This was a remarkable achievement for a coach from a third tier rugby nation. Morais has been credited with much of Portugal's progress in recent years.\nIn 2006, it was announced that Portugal would receive a grant from the IRB to help develop their rugby to Tier 2 standard. Few details were released regarding how the money was spent, but it was hoped it would ensure that Portugal's rugby would be able to move onto the next level. In 2006, the inaugural IRB Nations Cup was hosted in Lisbon. The tournament featured Portugal, Russia, Argentina A and Italy A.\n2007 World Cup.\nPortugal began their qualification campaign for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in 2004, as part of the European Nations Cup Division 1 2004–06 tournament. They won their first match, defeating Ukraine 6–36. They then defeated Georgia 18–14 in their second match, won their third match against the Czech Republic, defeated Russia as well, but then lost to Romania. Portugal then drew with Russia 19-all and lost to Georgia. After a loss to Romania and a win against the Czech Republic, Portugal finished third overall in the standings, and qualified for Round 5.\nRound 5 was played in October 2006 as a three match series between Italy, Russia and Portugal. Both Portugal and Russia lost heavily in their matches against Italy, who easily qualified for the finals. Second place came down to the final match of the round in Lisbon. Portugal won the match 26–23 against Russia to make it to Round 6. Round 6 was a home and away series against the Round 5 Pool B winners, Georgia. Portugal lost the first match, but drew 11-all in the second meeting. Georgia went through to the finals, and Portugal entered the repechage round where they defeated Morocco 26–20 on aggregate.\nPortugal then faced Uruguay for the last position in the finals. In the first leg of the two-match Repechage series, Portugal won 12–5. In the second game in Montevideo Portugal lost 18–12. On aggregate, Portugal won 24–23, sending them to their first ever World Cup. Having qualified for their first World Cup, several players were subsequently arrested in the ensuing celebrations as a result of an altercation with local police. No charges were laid and the players involved were allowed to leave Uruguay.\nIn the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Portugal went to Pool C, alongside favourites the All Blacks, Italy, Romania and Scotland. Portugal's highlights included preventing Italy getting a bonus point, scoring a try against the All Blacks, and coming within a try of beating Romania before losing 14–10. They also managed to score in all the four games, unlike Scotland and Romania. The Portugal team were celebrated for their commitment and passion, and for being the only amateur team to make it to the World Cup.\n2008–present.\nAfter the World Cup, Portugal faced some problems, including the end of the club and international careers of several key players, like Joaquim Ferreira, Paulo Murinello, Samuel Belo and Rui Cordeiro, and achieved only one win over Czech Republic in the final round of the European Nations Cup tournament, finishing in 5th place, their worst result since 2002.\nOn 1 November 2008, they lost at home against Canada 21–13 in a friendly game. After a disappointing campaign under Tomaz Morais in the 2006-08 edition of the Six Nations B, that would qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup finals, Murray Henderson was assigned as Specialist Forward coach.\nPortugal missed the second presence at the Rugby World Cup finals, after two surprising losses at home with Georgia (10–16) and Romania (9–20), which the \"Lobos\" had previously defeated 22–21 abroad. Portugal thus missed the 3rd place that would have granted access to the Rugby World Cup repechage.\nTomaz Morais was replaced by New Zealand coach Errol Brain, in October 2010, with a three years contract. He had mixed results, starting with strong performances but ended up with disappointing games. He was replaced by Frederico Sousa in October 2013.\nPortugal lost to Germany in the 2015–16 European Nations Cup Division 1A, finishing last, resulting in relegation for the following year.\nAfter Portugal got relegated to the 2016–17 Rugby Europe Trophy, Portugal went on to win the tournament 3 times in a row until the 2018-19 season, when they were granted promotion to the Rugby Europe Championship. Since then, Portugal have been quite successful in the competition. In the 2020-21 season, they finished 3rd place in a league system and in the 2022-23 season, they finished 1st place in a pool with Romania, Poland and Belgium, which led them to a semi-final with Spain, which they won (27-10), going all the way to the final in Badajoz, which they unfortunately lost to Georgia (38-11).\nPortugal qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup through the repechage tournament held in Dubai, beating Hong Kong, Kenya and drawing with the USA (16-16) on the last game, winning the repechage tournament on point difference.\nThey had a successful tournament, coming 4th in Pool C. They drew 18-18 with Georgia and pulled off a shock upset by beating Fiji 24-23. After the tournament, their world ranking was 13th, the highest they had ever been.\nRecord.\nRugby Europe International Championships.\nNotes:\n\"Portugal's last place finish in the 2014–16 European Nations Cup First Division resulted in their relegation to 2016–17 Rugby Europe Trophy in the following year.\"\nOverall.\nBelow is a table of the representative rugby matches played by a Portugal national XV at test level up until 18 March 2024:\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nOn 18 January, Portugal named their squad for the 2024 Rugby Europe Championship. \nIndividual all-time records.\nGonçalo Uva and Vasco Uva are the most capped players for Portugal (both 101) and Gonçalo Uva also has the record for most matches in the starting XV (95).

        "text": "The Tahiti national rugby union team is a third tier rugby union team, representing the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France. They first played in 1971 and have played numerous games to date, most against rivals Cook Islands and several against Niue. Other games have been played against Samoa, Wallis and Futuna, Papua New Guinea and Tonga. France played a match against Tahiti at the end of their 1979 tour and won 92–12. Plans to have annual \"test\" match series against Pacific island neighbours, New Caledonia have been put on hold, due to time, availability, finances, and coaching and refereeing resources. They have yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup. Rugby union in Tahiti is administered by the Fédération Tahitienne de Rugby de Polynésie Française. Currently, players who have represented or played for the Tahiti national rugby team, are eligible to represent France. However, playing at a professional level can only enable this. At present there are several Tahitian professional rugby players abroad in France's Top 14 and Pro D2 professional competition.\nHistory.\nRugby is greatly growing in popularity in Tahiti, but the national sport still remains soccer.\nRugby came to Tahiti via three separate streams, firstly, through the visits of British, New Zealand and Australian sailors; secondly, through the French presence (many of the main teams are still French military); and thirdly through contact with neighbouring Pacific islands, where the game is popular.\nTahiti first played the game in 1971.\nIt was founded in 1989 and became affiliated to the International Rugby Board in 1994.\nIt is also a full member of Oceania Rugby, which is the governing body for rugby union in Oceania.\nUp to 2003, Tahiti played in international rugby sevens (Pacific Games) and XV-a-side, in the qualifying rounds for the Rugby World Cup.\nIn 2006, there were fourteen clubs in the national championship and two divisions.

        "text": "The Hong Kong national rugby union team (), nicknamed the Dragons, has made the qualifying rounds of the Rugby World Cup. Rugby union in Hong Kong is administered by the Hong Kong Rugby Union since 1952, and successfully competes annually in the Asia Rugby Championship.\nHong Kong has one of the oldest rugby traditions in Asia, having been played there since the 19th century, when British colonists arrived in Hong Kong and brought the sport with them. For a long time, rugby union in Hong Kong was traditionally associated with Hong Kong's British colonial settlers, but since the 1990s there has been extensive efforts to integrate the game with the local Cantonese Chinese community, it included some local born players, with a degree of success; the first of these players being \"Rambo\" Leung Yeung Kit, considered to be, one of best Hong Kong players during his era. Other players such as Ricky Cheuk and Cado Lee had made significant impact in international tournaments. \nHong Kong has finished first place in the Asia Rugby Championship in 2018, 2019, 2022, and 2023, and made it to the repechage of the 2015 Rugby World Cup qualifying, though lost to Uruguay 24 to 3.They again competed in the repechage tournament for the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAccording to old newspapers, rugby union in Hong Kong dates back to the late 1870s, which would establish Hong Kong as perhaps the oldest rugby playing nation in Asia. The players during this era were all British sailors and army/navy men, as well as police and merchant men. The first secretary of rugby in Hong Kong was Jock McGregor.\nThe first fixtures which predate the creation of the modern Hong Kong Rugby Union in 1952 took place from 1924 to 1949. An unofficial interport team from Hong Kong played Shanghai on various dates from 1924 to 1949, both teams being composed entirely of British expatriates living in said port cities; these fixtures ceased after the establishment of Communist rule in mainland China. In 1934, a Hong Kong team played against an Australia Universities team, running out victors 11 to 5.\nAfter the establishment of modern Chinese borders, which before greyed the exact control a union had over territory in China, the Hong Kong Rugby Union was established in 1952; the continuation of British rule in China, as well as the flow of immigrants and capital from the mainland, as well as Hong Kong establishing itself as a major port, allowed the game to flourish, albeit mostly restricted to the white British community.\nDuring this time frame the first official fixtures under the union took place. Hong Kong first received a NZ Universities team in 1958, losing 47 to nil. In 1958, Larry Abel, one of Hong Kong's earliest rugby pioneers, established mini rugby programmes and tournaments, and has been played annually to this day. In 1968, Hong Kong was one of the charter nations of the Asian Rugby Football Union, the others being Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Korea, and Thailand. Hong Kong won its first official fixture against Japan in 1969, by the score of 24 to 22 in Tokyo.\n1970s.\nDuring the 1970s Hong Kong played against many of its other Asian neighbors which had a rugby history, these nations being Japan, South Korea, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Singapore. Hong Kong enjoyed and endured mixed success against its neighbors, finishing second in 1972, only to lose to Japan 16 to nil on home soil.\nIn 1976, the first ever edition of the Hong Kong Sevens was established, which was pivotal in strengthening the sport in Hong Kong. The concept was discussed by business partners Ian Gow and Tokkie Smith, who wanted to promote a viable rugby product in Asia. The first sponsors of this event were Cathay Pacific and Rothmans International, later replaced by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The first sides at this competition were Asian, as well as 2 representative sides from Australia and New Zealand. Soon, the competition grew to include teams from around the world before becoming an official part of the Rugby Sevens calendar.\n1980s–1990s.\nDuring the 1980s, Hong Kong lagged behind Japan and South Korea in terms of competition; Hong Kong was successful against other Asian nations but consistently finished in third place, whereas Japan and South Korea were vying for the top crown. Hong Kong officially joined the IRB in 1988, allowing Hong Kong to compete in the Rugby World Cup, though they did not enter the competition to qualify for 1991.\nThe 1990s proved to be a much more fruitful decade for Hong Kong. Hong Kong played its first ever test match against a non-Asia-Pacific opponent in 1992, losing 16 to 23 to the United States in 1992 in Boxer Stadium, San Francisco. In the same year, Hong Kong finally broke through and reached the final of the Asia Rugby Championship, beating South Korea 20 to 13 before losing to Japan 9 to 37.\nSome notable players during the 1990s represented Hong Kong at the international level including Ashley Billington, David Lewis, Leung Yeung Kit, Chan Fuk Ping and Pieter Schats.\nHong Kong participated in its first qualifying tournament for the Rugby World Cup in 1995, being drawn with Thailand and Singapore in its group. Hong Kong lost its opening fixture to South Korea 28 to 17 before beating its other opponents; Hong Kong therefore missed out on a spot at the 1995 Rugby World Cup. An impressive feat achieved during this campaign though was Ashley Billington's 10 tries versus Singapore on 10 November 1994, which is the most tries ever scored in a Rugby World Cup qualifier by a single player.\nThrough the 1990s, Hong Kong began organizing tests against non-Asian opponents. Opponents that were played were Namibia, Papua New Guinea, the United States, and Canada. Hong Kong recorded some famous victories, beating the USA Eagles on three occasions in the decade, including a victory in San Francisco, and beating Canada in 1998.\nDespite major improvement in the 1990s, Hong Kong bottomed out in its qualifying group for the 1999 Rugby World Cup; Hong Kong beat its nemesis South Korea, but lost to Japan and were upset by the Chinese Taipei; they finished fourth and missed on direct qualification and a repechage.\n2000–present: the new millennium.\nIn 2000, Hong Kong made history when they played China in 2000; this was the first test that Hong Kong played against a team from the Chinese mainland since 1949. The game was played in Shanghai to honor the old rugby matches between Hong Kong and Shanghai. China upset Hong Kong 17 to 15 that day.\nHong Kong struggled somewhat during the early 2000s. In 2001, Hong Kong were once again surprised by China, drawing at 25 points each in Guangzhou. Hong Kong were once again upset by the Chinese Taipei in the 2003 Rugby World Cup qualifiers, losing 20 to 15, although Hong Kong beat China for the first time in that same qualification. Hong Kong lost all its fixtures in the final round of the 2007 Rugby World Cup qualifying campaign, missing out again on repechage or qualification.\nThe 2011 qualifying campaign was similar: Hong Kong beat both South Korea as well as newcomers Kazakhstan, but lost a crucial fixture to the Arabian Gulf; due to bonus points, Kazakhstan advanced instead of Hong Kong to the repechage.\nFor the 2015 qualifiers, Hong Kong finally broke through. Hong Kong were drawn into a group including its traditional East Asian rivals Japan and South Korea as well as Sri Lanka and newcomers the Philippines. Hong Kong thrashed South Korea 39 to 6 in Hong Kong, as well as recording a resounding 108 to 0 victory over the Philippines. Hong Kong finished second, and qualified for the repechage as a result. In the repechage versus Uruguay, in Montevideo, Hong Kong held firm for the first half, only trailing 6 to 3; however, Hong Kong indiscipline, coupled with key players not being available, meant that Hong Kong collapsed in the second half, losing 28 to 3, and bowing out of the qualifiers.\nAt the end of 2015, Hong Kong hosted the 2015 Cup of Nations, which included 3 other emerging rugby nations: Portugal, Russia, and Zimbabwe. Hong Kong finished second, beating Portugal and Zimbabwe but losing to Russia. In 2016, Hong Kong hired Leigh Jones, Japan's defense coach who played a key role in Japan's epic upset of South Africa in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, to take the role of head coach and high performance in Hong Kong.\nIn order to further build for future success, the HKRU, under the vision of Leigh Jones, launched its first fully professional 15s programme called the Elite Rugby Program; the goal of the programme is to encourage domestic players to pursue rugby as a profession in Hong Kong, and long-term, create a professional competition akin to Japan's Top League.\nIn the 2016 Cup of Nations, Hong Kong lost to Russia and won over Zimbabwe and Papua New Guinea. In the 2017 Cup of Nations, the team was defeated again by Russia, while beating Chile and Kenya.\nHong Kong will participate in the inaugural season of World Series Rugby, facing off against the Western Force.\nOverall.\nBelow is table of the representative rugby matches played by a Hong Kong national XV. \nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nOn 15 April 2024, Hong Kong China named a 29 man traveling squad for a tour of Australia. The side scheduled to train in Canberra at the Australian Institute of Sport for 7 days before playing a match against the ACT Brumbies A as a curtain raiser for the Super Rugby clash between ACT Brumbies and the Hurricanes at GIO Stadium Canberra.\nHead Coach: Andrew Douglas\nCaps updated: 18 April 2024\nNotable former players.\nThe Hong Kong Rugby Union has inducted 16 players into its Hall of Fame as part of its Roll of Honour.

        "text": "The Russia national rugby union team (Russian: Сборная России по регби), nicknamed Medvedi (\"The Bears\"), represented Russia in men's international rugby union international competitions. The team is administered by the Rugby Union of Russia (RUR). The RUR is considered the official successor union of the Soviet Union by World Rugby and the combined CIS team which played in the early 1990s. Since 1992, the team has played as Russia. Its first test match as Russia was against the Barbarians in Moscow in June 1992 and the country's first test against an official Test nation was against Belgium later that same year.\nRussia is seen as a Tier 2 union by World Rugby. The team's regular international competition was in the Rugby Europe Championship – often referred to as the Six Nations B. In addition, the team participated in World Rugby-run summer tournaments including the Nations Cup, the dormant Churchill Cup, and other international fixtures.\nRussia competed in their first Rugby World Cup (RWC) in New Zealand in 2011 after qualifying as Europe 2 through their second-place finish in the 2009–10 ENC. Russia played in Pool C and finished fifth, scoring one point. Previous qualification campaigns saw elimination to Portugal ahead of the 2007 tournament, and expulsion from 2003 qualifying for Russia's breaches of eligibility rules. The team also unsuccessfully attempted to qualify for the 1995 and 1999 Rugby World Cups. They competed in the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan by qualifying as Europe 1 as a result of Spain, Romania and Belgium being eliminated.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Rugby and Rugby Europe suspended Russia from international and European continental rugby union competition. In addition, the Rugby Union of Russia was suspended from World Rugby and Rugby Europe.\nHistory.\nThe Rugby Union of the Soviet Union was founded in 1936, although the national side did not play its first official international until 1974.\nThe Soviet Union took time to establish itself, but by the mid-1980s was regularly beating the likes of Italy and Romania. The team was invited to the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup, but declined on political grounds, not least the continued IRB membership of apartheid South Africa. Following the breakup of the USSR, Russian players played for the interim Commonwealth of Independent States team, which played four matches during 1991 and 1992.\nThe first game played by the new Russian national team took place on June 6, 1992, when Russia beat the Barbarians 27–23. Russia's first game against a full IRB member was versus Belgium four months later in the 1992/4 FIRA-AER European Trophy. That edition of the tournament saw Russia secure its first, and to-date only, win over Georgia. Russia continued to participate until realignment of FIRA-AER competitions in 2000.\nThe Russian national side has since played its regular competitive rugby in FIRA-AER's European Nations Cup, the second level mirror tournament to the Six Nations. Russia replaced Morocco in the top tier in 2001 and have stayed there ever since. The Russian side has yet to win the title. The team has played in the now-defunct Superpowers Cup, winning the tournament once, the Nations Cup, the Churchill Cup, and most recently the IRB's International Rugby Series. The RUR attempted to gain greater participation in the autumn test window, and was being integrated into World Rugby's global test match schedule.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Rugby and Rugby Europe suspended Russia from international and European continental rugby union competition. In addition, the Rugby Union of Russia was suspended from World Rugby and Rugby Europe.\nRugby World Cup.\nEarly qualifying attempts (1987 – 2007).\nThe Soviet Union declined to take up its invite to take part in the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup on the basis of the IRB membership by apartheid South Africa. The Soviet Rugby Union was not an IRB member in time for 1991 Rugby World Cup qualifying.\nIn qualifying for the 1995 Rugby World Cup, the first in which the national side was involved, Russia came through preliminary qualifying with wins over Poland and Georgia, before beating Germany but losing to Romania for the Eastern Europe spot. In European qualifying for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Russia finished fourth in Pool 1 in Round B, which was not enough to progress from a group also including Italy, Georgia, Croatia, and Denmark.\nThe Russian national side was expelled from qualifying for the 2003 Rugby World Cup, due to eligibility issues. Spain, who Russia had beaten in qualifying, protested the fielding of three South African-born players (Johan Hendriks, Reiner Volschenck and Werner Pieterse), whom the RUR claimed had qualified through ancestry. However, the RUR did not produce documentation deemed acceptable by the IRB, and Spain were re-instated in qualification in Russia's place.\nIn 2007 Rugby World Cup qualifying, Russia came through European qualifying to a mini-group stage where they were pooled with Italy and Portugal. The winner would qualify directly and the second place team would continue the qualification process, with the third-placed team eliminated. After both losing heavily to Italy, Portugal and Russia met to determine progression to qualifying round 5. Russia lost the match, played in Lisbon, 26–23 and dropped out.\n2011.\nRussia qualified for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand as Europe 2 after finishing second in the 2008–10 European Nations Cup. This marked the team's World Cup debut, with Russia becoming the 25th side to play at the tournament, where they faced Australia, Ireland, Italy and the United States in Group C of the tournament.\n2015.\nThe Russian national rugby union team finished third in European qualifying for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The top two teams in the final group— Georgia and Romania — immediately qualified for the 2015 tournament. Russia, as third-place finisher in the final group, faced Uruguay in a home-and-away two-game playoff. Uruguay won on aggregate and secured the 20th and final qualifying spot for the 2015 tournament, with Russia failing to qualify.\n2019.\nThe Russian national rugby union team once again finished third in European qualifying for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. However, after a controversial game played by Belgium and Spain (which was originally intended to be replayed), the issue of three teams in the group stage fielding ineligible players (Belgium, Romania, and Spain) was investigated by World Rugby and Rugby Europe. It was determined that all three teams had violated eligibility rules and gained an unfair advantage (both Romania and Spain defeated Russia) and were sanctioned, and thus, Russia advanced as the automatic qualifier, with Germany headed to the repechage against Portugal.\nEuropean Nations Cup.\nAs the Soviet Union, the side secured four straight silvers (all behind France and ahead of Italy and Romania) during the 1980s, and three bronzes. Russia first played the FIRA Trophy in the 1992–94 season. Since 2000, Russia's primary international competition is the European Nations Cup, administered by Rugby Europe and played, by-and-large, during the Six Nations international release window in February and March. Russia won the inaugural Division 2 competition, winning promotion to the top tier in 2000, where they have remained ever since. Since realignment, Russia has secured two runners-up spots and three third-place finishes.\nIn the 2011-12 season, Russia finished fourth with five wins and five losses. In the 2013-14 season, the team finished third with six wins and four losses. In the 2015-16 season, the Bears again claimed six wins and four losses to finish third. In the 2017 season, Russia finished fourth with two wins and three losses.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nOn the 23rd of January 2022, the following 26 players were called up for the 2022 Rugby Europe Championship.\nOn the 24th of January, Vasily Artemyev was called up to the squad. On the 26th and 27 January, Vladimir Podrezov and Alexei Golov as well as Victor Kononov and Alexander Gudok were called up to the squad.\nOn 30 January, Victor Arhip was called up to the squad. On the 1st of February, Ramil Gaisin was called up to the squad.\nOn 7 February, Evgeny Mishechkin, Alexei Skobiola, Gleb Farkov, Kirill Golosnitsky, Vladislav Sozonov and Maxim Shevtsov were called up to the squad while Kirill Gotovtsev returned to his club.\nHead Coach: Aleksandr Pervukhin\nCurrent coaching staff.\nThe current coaching staff of the Russian national team:\nPast Coaches.\n\"Since 1992\"\nStadiums and attendance.\nThe national team does not have a permanent home stadium and play their matches at various locations across Russia.

He was drafted by the Calgary Flames in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft in the 1st round as the 18th pick overall.\nCareer.\nWhen Mattsson was a junior, he was considered to be a big star in the future and in 1991, at just 16 years old, he played in Elitserien for his hometown club Malmö IF and before turing 19, he had won the Swedish championship twice (1992 and 1994). In 1993 Calgary Flames drafted him 18th overall in the 1993 NHL Draft.\nAfter his fourth season in Elitserien with Malmö IF, Mattsson signed a contract with the Flames. But Mattsson had a rough time in North America, and despite seasons there he never dressed for a single Flames game, and played exclusively with Calgary's farm team, the Saint John Flames of the AHL. During his third season with Saint John he decided to move back to Sweden and Malmö IF and he finished the season with Malmö. He continued to play with Malmö for another six years with varied results.\nIn the summer of 2004 he decided it was time to move again and this time he signed a three-year contract with Malmö rival SEL team, Färjestad BK.

It was the 120th edition of the Wimbledon Championships and were held from 26 June to 9 July 2006. It was the third Grand Slam tennis event of the year.\nRoger Federer won his fourth consecutive Wimbledon title, defeating Rafael Nadal in what was to be the first of three consecutive Wimbledon finals played between the pair. Venus Williams was unsuccessful in her title defence, losing in the third round against Jelena Janković. Amélie Mauresmo won her second Grand Slam title, and first and only Wimbledon title, defeating Justine Henin-Hardenne in the final in three sets. Mauresmo thus became the first Frenchwoman since 1925 to win the Wimbledon title. It was Henin-Hardenne's second of three Grand Slam final defeats of 2006, having lost the 2006 Australian Open final to Mauresmo earlier in the year; on that occasion, Henin-Hardenne retired due to a stomach virus.\nNotable stories.\nAmerican performance and Serbian breakthrough.\nFor the first time since 1911, no American player reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon, and for the first time since the 1976 Australian Open, no American player reached a Grand Slam quarter-final. Shenay Perry was the only American player to reach the fourth round; she was defeated 6–2, 6–0 by Elena Dementieva after losing the last ten games of the match. Her defeat also meant that no American woman reached the Wimbledon final for the first time since 1998.\nVenus Williams' third round defeat by Jelena Janković of Serbia (on its first Grand Slam appearance as a newly established independent nation from the former Serbia and Montenegro) caused the earliest exit by a defending women's champion at Wimbledon since Steffi Graf lost in the first round in 1994 and meant that neither of the Williams sisters (Serena Williams withdrew due to injury) would be represented in a Wimbledon final for the first time since 1999. These championships were also the first to feature three Serbian players in the fourth round of any Grand Slam tournament: along with Janković, Ana Ivanovic and Novak Djokovic also reached the fourth round, the former losing to Amélie Mauresmo and the latter losing to Mario Ančić.\nLi Na's run to the quarter-finals.\nChina's Li Na became the first player from her country to ever be seeded or reach the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam tournament. She upset the recent French Open finalist Svetlana Kuznetsova in the third round and followed it up with a win over World No. 10 Nicole Vaidišová in the fourth round, before losing her quarter-final to second seed Kim Clijsters. Li would not reach another Grand Slam quarter-final until the 2009 US Open, where again she was defeated by Clijsters.\nStreaker incident.\nMidway during the ladies' quarter-final match between Maria Sharapova and Elena Dementieva, a streaker ran onto the Centre Court and interrupted the match, before ultimately being arrested and brought into custody by Wimbledon security guards. The streaker was later revealed to be Dutch DJ Sander Lantinga, who carried out the stunt as part of the Dutch television show \"Try Before You Die\".\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow are the tables with the point distribution for each discipline of the tournament.\nPrize distribution.\nThe total prize money for 2006 championships was £10,378,710.

        "text": "William Michael Phillips (born 29 August 1982) is a rugby union player who plays at scrum-half. On 16 March 2013, Phillips surpassed the record of 76 caps set by Dwayne Peel as the most capped scrum-half for Wales.\nTall and powerful, unusual properties in a scrum half, he has been compared to ex-Wales international Terry Holmes.\nPersonal life.\nThe third son of dairy farmer Trevor and teacher Morfydd, Phillips was born and raised the youngest in a family of three boys on the family farm between Bancyfelin and St Clears. He is a fluent Welsh speaker.\nHis middle brother became Welsh amateur boxing champion before fighting professionally, while his eldest brother Rob was a scrum-half with Whitland RFC, where Mike also spent his late teenage years as both a blind and open side flanker.\nPhillips then moved to Carmarthen RFC as a flanker, before playing at scrum-half; at ,\nPhillips was dating Welsh singer Amie Duffy until May 2011; it is thought that they were together for 20 months.\nIn September 2012, Phillips was suspended by his club Bayonne for one match for what was described as unacceptable off-field behaviour.\nPhillips is patron of UK charity Follow Your Dreams, which works with children and young people with learning disabilities.\nClub career.\nPhillips made his first appearance for the Scarlets at the age of 20, and remained there in spite of restrictions in first team appearances due to the performances of Dwayne Peel, until the summer of 2005.\nCiting his lack of first team appearances as the main reason, in 2005 Phillips signed for the Cardiff Blues starting most matches, partnering fellow former Welsh Under-21 player Nicky Robinson.\nIn February 2007, Phillips was linked with a move to the Ospreys, on a basic wage of £180,000 as Cardiff Blues would not break their wage structure. Having signed for the Ospreys, at first he was the second-choice scrum-half as former All-Black Justin Marshall held the role. Following Marshall's departure to Montpellier, Phillips had the chance to make the position his own but for a knee ligament injury, allowing the emergence of new signing Jamie Nutbrown to take the role.\nIn June 2011, Phillips left the Ospreys and joined French club Bayonne. In October 2013, he was sacked from Bayonne for repeated misconduct, with the final incident being drunk at an analysis session following the loss to London Wasps in the Amlin Cup.\nOn 2 December 2013, Phillips joined French club Racing Métro, linking up with fellow Wales internationals Jamie Roberts and Dan Lydiate.\nOn 5 May 2016, Phillips made his debut in the Aviva Premiership with English club Sale Sharks.\nOn 26 November 2017 Philips briefly came out of retirement to join the Scarlets squad as cover due to injuries at scrum half and came on as a second-half substitute in their 34–30 Pro 14 win against the Southern Kings.\nInternational career.\nPhillips represented Wales at Under-21 level where he played with fellow Cardiff player Nicky Robinson. In 2003, he made his Wales debut against Romania and scored a try. Phillips toured Argentina and South Africa in 2004, and also scored during the 2005 tour of the USA and Canada.\nHis performances for the Blues saw him get into the Wales squad for the 2006 Six Nations Championship, despite having a poor Autumn International where he started against New Zealand in a match that ended in a heavy defeat for Wales.\nHis first game came against Italy after Dwayne Peel, who had started the game at scrum-half, was injured in the seventh minute. He also started against France where he played extremely well, picking up the man of the match award. After a successful season with the Blues, he was picked for Wales's tour to Argentina where he started both tests.\nPhillips made the squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He started one match against Japan in which he scored a try and won the man of the match award. In all the other games he came off the bench. But Wales had a very disappointing tournament, being knocked out by Fiji in the pool stages.\nIn 2008, Wales appointed a new coach, Warren Gatland, who liked Phillips' physical presence. He played in the Welsh team against England, for the 2008 Six Nations Championship. He scored the winning try as Wales claimed a 26–19 victory – their first at Twickenham in 20 years. Phillips started the next match against Scotland, which Wales won 30–15. Phillips was then replaced by Dwayne Peel for the match against Italy; however, he came on after 42 minutes after Peel was injured again, and made a significant impact as Wales thrashed the Azzuri 47–8. Phillips then started the match against Ireland. Wales made it four from four as they beat the Irish 16–12 to claim the triple crown. Phillips also started against France, as Wales claimed their second grand slam in four years with a 29–12 hammering of Les Bleus. Phillips was one of six players nominated for player of the tournament, but his fellow Ospreys teammate, Shane Williams, won the award.\nA week after the grand slam a knee ligament injury ruled him out for six months, meaning he would miss the tour of South Africa and the Autumn Internationals. But Phillips made a strong return and started all five matches in the 2009 Six Nations Championship. He was named in the team of the tournament, but Wales finished a disappointing fourth after defeats by France and Ireland.\nOn 21 April 2009, Phillips was named as one of 13 Welsh players for the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa. On 10 June 2009 he scored his first try for the Lions, contributing to their 39–3 victory against the Sharks. He also scored a try against South Africa but the Lions lost 26–21, although they came back strongly after starting the second half 26–7 down. Phillips played in the next test, but the Lions lost again 28–25 thanks to a last-gasp penalty by Morné Steyn. Phillips played in the final test as well, and was only one of five players to play in all three tests. The Lions won their first test match since 2001 with a crunching 28–9 victory. Phillips was one of the players of the tour.\nOn 12 March 2011, Phillips scored a controversial try against Ireland in the 2011 Six Nations Championship. When Irish fly-half Johnny Sexton kicked the ball out of play, Wales hooker Matthew Rees took a quick line-out with a different ball to the one which Sexton kicked out of play, which is against the laws of the game. Rees took the throw and Phillips held off Irish winger Tommy Bowe to score in the corner. The try was allowed to stand, and Wales won the game 19–13.\nOn 30 April 2013, Phillips was named in the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia squad.\nOn 1 June 2013, Phillips scored two tries in the Lions tour opening match against The Barbarians and was named man of the match.\nOn 13 August 2015, Philips was cut from the Wales squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. On 8 September 2015, Philips was called into the World Cup squad to cover the injured Rhys Webb who has been ruled out. However, he did not make an appearance during the World Cup and retired from international duty on 1 December 2015 with 99 caps to his name.\nMedia.\nIn 2012, Welsh-speaking Phillips was the subject of a documentary on S4C, in which he stated he would never play for a Welsh club again. Phillips also made a cameo appearance as himself in a 2012 episode of the UK TV comedy drama \"Stella\"."

        "title": "Mark Jones (rugby union, born 1979)",
        "text": "Mark Anthony Jones (born 7 November 1979) is a Welsh professional rugby union coach and former player who played as a wing for the Scarlets and Wales. Since making his international debut for Wales in 2001, he won 47 caps and scored 13 tries. Since going into coaching, Jones has held head-coaching jobs with Rotherham, RGC 1404 and the Namibia national team.\nEarly life.\nJones was born in Builth Wells, Powys. As a youngster, as well as playing rugby, Jones was also a sprinter and once competed against future World Junior Athletics champion Christian Malcolm in a 100 metres final; Jones said his performance against Malcolm was the reason he gave up athletics for a career in rugby. He began his domestic career at Builth Wells Youth before joining the senior side. He was signed by Llandovery from Builth and in his first season of senior rugby was the highest try scorer in the Welsh League. Jones joined Llanelli in 1997 and remained at the club until his retirement in 2010. Jones has represented Wales at U18, U19 and U20 levels and made his first team debut for Wales as a replacement against England in the 2001 Lloyds TSB Six Nations.\nCareer.\nDuring the 2005–06 season, Jones won six international caps and scored three tries. This was after consecutive knee injuries and major reconstructive surgery saw him ruled out of Wales contention since the 2003 Rugby World Cup.\nJones scored seven tries for the Scarlets during the 2006–07 season, three of which came in the region's Heineken Cup run, including one in the semi-final loss to the Leicester Tigers.\nJones appeared for Wales in the 2007 Six Nations against Scotland, Italy and in the sole victory over England. In June, Jones was named in Gareth Jenkins's 41-man preliminary Rugby World Cup 2007 summer training squad after being rested from the two Test tour to Australia. Jones made the final 30-man cut for the World Cup squad in August and played in Wales' warm-up matches ahead of the tournament, scoring a try against Argentina.\nJones appeared for Wales in the Rugby World Cup in pool matches against Canada and Australia. He also played in the final Pool B encounter, scoring a try in Wales's defeat at the hands of Fiji, which saw them eliminated from the tournament. In November 2007 Jones was selected by caretaker coach Nigel Davies in the line-up to face world champions South Africa in the Prince William Cup at the Millennium Stadium.\nNew Wales head coach Warren Gatland included Jones in his Grand Slam-winning 2008 Six Nations squad. He played in four matches, only missing the game against Scotland, and almost scored a try in the championship decider against France, stopped just short of the line after a break.\nIn July 2009, it was announced that Jones was to be handed the captaincy for the Scarlets' 2009–10 season. However, he tore cartilage in his knee while on Wales duty in November 2009, and was ruled out for at least three months. In March 2010, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season, and in April, he expressed concerns that the injury might force him into retirement. He eventually retired from the game in August 2010, bringing to an end a 12-year career. He played 163 times for the Scarlets, including appearances for Llanelli RFC in the pre-regional era, scoring 85 tries.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing his retirement, Jones was announced as a skills coach for the Scarlets region on a two-year contract. This saw him coach skills both at first-team level and with a wider responsibility within the Premiership teams, Academy and age-grade pathways for the region.\nIn 2012 he joined Wales set up, supporting Rob Howley at the 2012 autumn internationals. In 2013 he became interim attack coach during the Six Nations Championship. He also accompanied Robin McBryde on the 2013 tour of Japan.\nIn 2015 he became head coach of the Rotherham Titans in the Championship, taking over from Lee Blackett. He departed in 2016, with Titans chairman Nick Cragg describing Jones as \"a quality individual for whom we have the greatest respect\" but stating that \"results over the last three months have not been what we would have wished them to be and both parties have agreed that now is the time for change\".\nJones took over as head coach of Colwyn Bay-based side RGC 1404 in 2016 as they moved into the Welsh Premier Division for that season. He led the side into a spell of exciting rugby, with commentators praising the Gogs' \"sizzling, attacking style\" which led to their victory in the Welsh National Cup in 2017.\nJones was critical of WRU plans in 2017 to include regional A and under 23 sides in the new Celtic Cup, stating that it devalued Welsh club rugby and threatened the existence of semi-professional teams.\nAfter three years at Eirias Stadium, Jones stood down as head coach of RGC, stating that the travel between his home town of Neath and Colwyn Bay was becoming too difficult for his family. He described one occasion where he travelled 800 miles in one weekend between work, attending his son's football game, and returning home to Neath. He told WalesOnline that he would continue to seek a coaching role, ideally at a PRO14 Welsh regional side. He described his preferred coaching style as \"working with players with a tracksuit on\", but said his time in Colwyn Bay had particularly helped him develop as an off-field coach.\nDuring the 2019 Rugby World Cup, Jones was offered a role coaching the Namibia national rugby union team in Japan, \"working closely with the Namibia backs both prior and during the competition\". He was joined by fellow ex-Wales players Dale McIntosh and Wayne Proctor.\nIn January 2020 Jones surprised rugby pundits when he announced he was moving to Christchurch and joining the coaching setup at the Super Rugby side Crusaders on a two-year deal. Jones will serve as defence coach under head coach Scott Robertson and be running the attack and the backs with Canterbury, moving to New Zealand in 2020 after spending Christmas in Wales. In his interview upon joining the side, he described the South Island team as \"the best rugby organisation in the world\"."

        "title": "The Skeleton in Armor",
        "text": "The Skeleton in Armor is the name given to a skeleton associated with metal, bark and cloth artifacts which was unearthed in Fall River, Massachusetts in 1832. The skeleton was subsequently destroyed in a fire in 1843. It is also the name of a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\nDiscovery and description.\nA contemporary account of the skeleton's discovery and general appearance was written by a Dr. Phineas W. Leland in 1843, soon after the artifact's destruction. The text of the description was as follows:\nAmong the curiosities of peculiar interest (in the cabinets of the Fall River Athenaeum) was the entire skeleton of a man, about which antiquarians in the old as well as the new world had speculated much. The skeleton was found in the year 1832 in a sand- or grave-bank a little east of the Unitarian meetinghouse by some persons while digging away and removing a portion of the bank. (On or very near the site now occupied by the \"Gas-Works\", corner of Hartwell and Fifth Streets). The skeleton was found near the surface in a sitting posture, the legbones doubled upon the thigh-bones, and the thighs brought up nearly parallel with the body. It was quite perfect, and stood remarkably well the test of exposure. Covering the sternum was a triangular plate of brass somewhat corroded by time, and around the body was a broad belt made of small brass tubes four or five inches in length about the size of a pipestem placed parallel and close to each other. Arrowheads made of copper or brass were also found in the grave with the skeleton. That these were the remains of an Indian seemed to be very generally conceded; the configuration of the skull, the position in which the skeleton was found, and the additional fact that parts of other skeletons were found near the same place renders it nearly certain that these were the bones of an Indian.\nAnother description of the artifact written by John Stark, a lawyer in Galena, Illinois appeared in the 1837 volume of the \"American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge\":\nThese remains were found in the town of Fall River, in Bristol County, Mass., about eighteen months since. In digging down a hill near the village, a large mass of earth slid off, leaving in the bank and partially uncovered a human skull, which, on examination, was found to belong to a body buried in a sitting posture, the head being about one foot below what had been for many years the surface of the ground. The surrounding earth was carefully removed and the body found to be enwrapped in a covering of coarse bark of a dark color. Within this envelope were found the remains of another of coarse cloth, made of fine bark and about the texture of a Manilla coffee-bag. On the breast was a plate of brass, thirteen inches long, six broad at the upper end and five at the lower. This plate appears to have been cast, and is from one-eighth to three thirty-seconds of an inch in thickness. It is so much corroded that whether or not anything was ever engraved upon it has not yet been ascertained. It is oval in form, the edges being irregular, apparently made so by corrosion.\nBelow the breastplate, and entirely encircling the body, was a belt composed of brass tubes,each four and a half inches in length and three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter, arranged longitudinally and close together, the length of the tube being the width of the belt. The tubes are of thin brass, cast upon hollow reeds, and were fastened together by pieces of sinew. This belt was so placed as to protect the lower parts of the body below the breastplate. The arrows are of brass, thin, flat, and triangular in shape, with a round hole cut through near the base. The shaft was fastened to the head by inserting the latter in an opening at the end of the wood, and then tying it with a sinew through the round hole, a mode of constructing the weapon never practiced by the Indians, not even with their arrows of thin shell. Parts of the shaft still remain attached to some of them. When first discovered the arrows were in a sort of quiver of bark, which fell in pieces when exposed to the air.\nThe skull is much decayed, but the teeth are sound and apparently of a young man. The pelvis is much decayed and the smaller bones of the lower extremities are gone.\nThe integuments of the right knee, for four or five inches above and below, are in good preservation, apparently the size and shape of life, although quite black.\nConsiderable flesh is still preserved on the hands and arms, but more on the shoulders and elbows. On the back under the belt, and for two inches above and below, the skin and flesh are in good preservation, and have the appearance of being tanned. The chest is much compressed, but the upper viscera are probably entire. The arms are bent up, not crossed, so that the hands turned inwards touch the shoulders. The stature is about five and a half feet. Much of the exterior envelope was decayed, and the inner one appeared to be preserved only where it had been in contact with the brass.\nThe preservation of this body may be the result of some embalming process, and this hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that the skin has the appearance of having been tanned, or it may be the accidental result of the action of the salts of the brass I during oxidation, and this latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that the skin and flesh have been preserved only where they have been in contact with or quite near the brass, or we may account for the preservation of the whole by supposing the presence of salt peter in the soil at the time of the deposit. In either way, the preservation of the remains is fully accounted for, and upon known chemical principles.\nThat the body was not one of the Indians we think needs no argument. We have seen some of the drawings taken from the sculptures found at Palenque, and in those the figures are represented with the breastplates, although smaller than the plate found at Fall River. On the figures at Palenque the bracelets and anklets seem to be of a manufacture precisely similar to the belt of tubes just described.\nIf the body found at Fall River be one of the Asiatic race, who transiently settled in Central America, and afterwards went to Mexico and founded those cities, in exploring the ruins of which such astonishing discoveries have recently been made, then we may well suppose also that it is one of the race whose exploits have, although without a date and almost without a certain name, been immortalized by Homer. Of the great race who founded cities and empires in their eastward march, and are finally lost in South America, the Romans seem to have had a glimmering tradition in the story of Evander.\nBut we rather incline to the belief that the remains found at Fall River belonged to the crew of a Phoenician vessel. The spot where they were found is on the sea-coast, and in the immediate neighborhood of Dighton Rock, famed for its hieroglyphic inscriptions, of which no sufficient explanation has yet been given, alla near which rock brazen vessels have been found. If this latter hypothesis be adopted, a part of it is that these mariners, the unwilling and unfortunate discoverers of a new world, lived some time after they landed, and having written their names, perhaps their epitaphs, upon the rock at Dighton, died, and were buried by the natives.\nLoss.\nThe skeleton was moved to the Fall River Athenaeum, a library, where it was displayed in a glass-covered case, along with the arrow tips. The Athenaeum, along with much of the village of Fall River, was destroyed in the \"Great Fire\" of July 2, 1843.\nIdentity.\nNative American.\nAs stated in the Leland article cited above, the majority opinion of the find at the time was that it represented a Native American chief. Given Fall River's location, this could have been a member of the Narragansett or Wampanoag tribe.\nBesides the other brass arrowheads mentioned above, at least one identical breastplate has been found, and it is known that traders sold the Indians brass kettles from which they made arrowheads. Arrowheads described as \"precisely similar\" were used by the Iroquois in the 17th century.\nPhoenician, Carthaginian, or Egyptian.\nAs the Stark article reproduced above indicates, there was at least one commentator who suggested a much different origin for the artifact. The idea that Phoenicians, Carthaginians, or Egyptians had at some time in the past discovered North America and explored or colonized it was somewhat popular at the time of the find, and occasionally used to explain feats such as the construction of Chichen Itza which many contemporary antiquarians could not believe were actually constructed by Mesoamerican civilizations. This notion has fallen into disfavor and is usually classed as pseudohistory, though there is a small minority of authors who continue to advance such beliefs. \nPhoenicians and later Carthaginians routinely navigated the coasts of the northeastern Atlantic and presumably their trading vessels, blown off course in a storm, could have reached North America. Such accidental one-way contact, as intimated in the last paragraph of Stark's report, could account for the presence of bronze artefacts as well as being compatible with the lack of evidence for a regular settlement, and the absence of indications in Native American oral history (as such shipwrecks would be few in number and just a local curiosity, soon to be forgotten). \nBut regardless the theoretical possibility of isolated Atlantic crossings in antiquity, the reported state of preservation of the body - interred in moist soil - essentially rules out an age of more than a few centuries. Even mummified corpses would rapidly decompose under such conditions.\nEarly colonist or explorer.\nBecause the artifact has been destroyed, there is no way of scientifically dating the remains. Although the style of armor described as being found with the skeleton certainly does not sound similar to anything worn by early European colonists who settled the area, the possibility that the skeleton belonged to some early settler cannot be entirely discounted.\nFraud.\nFinally, there is the possibility that the artifact was a deliberate forgery or a practical joke, although there is no clear motive as to why someone would create such a forgery at that time.\nLongfellow's poem.\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow was evidently familiar with the artifact's discovery. Unlike the authors of the articles reproduced above, Longfellow apparently considered that the artifact was Norse in origin; Longfellow was familiar with the writings of Carl Christian Rafn on the subject of Norse colonization of the Americas. Whether or not Longfellow concluded that this was a genuine Norse artifact is unknown. Nevertheless, he did immortalize the discovery in the poem \"The Skeleton in Armor\". The poem was first published in Lewis Gaylord Clark's \"The Knickerbocker\" in 1841. In the poem, Longfellow also refers to the Old Stone Mill in Touro Park in Newport, Rhode Island, also known as the Newport Tower. Some suggest that the stone structure dates back to the Viking exploration of North America, though it is more likely it was built in the seventeenth century during the time of Governor Benedict Arnold.\nCommemoration.\nIn 1903, Fall River placed a bronze tablet on a brick building on Hartwell and Fifth Street to commemorate the finding of the skeleton at that location.\nThe tablet was 24x20 inches and read: \"A Skeleton In Armor was found near this spot by Hannah Borden Cook In the month of May A D 1831 This Tablet was placed here by the Women's Educational and Industrial Society of Fall River Mass May 27th A D 1903\".\nThe tablet was stolen in 2018 by metal thieves but was recovered and repositioned in a more secure spot."

        "title": "History of Rugby, Warwickshire",
        "text": "This is about the history of the town of Rugby, Warwickshire, England.\nAncient and Roman.\nIn the Early Iron Age the Rugby area was settled. Rugby's site on a plateau at about 400 feet above sea level, overlooking the River Avon made it an important strategic post overlooking the Avon, which was a natural barrier between the Dobunni and the Corieltauvi tribes. Iron Age remains, probably lookout posts or forts, have been located on either side of the Avon.\nIn Roman times, two major Roman roads were built very close to the site of modern-day Rugby: the Fosse Way and Watling Street. Twelve miles north of Rugby is High Cross (Roman name Venonae), where the two roads cross.\nJust outside modern day Rugby, remains have been found of a Roman town called Tripontium, on the original Watling Street which is now known as the A5. Historians believe that the settlement was a kind of ancient service station, providing stabling and accommodation to passing Roman armies and travellers.\nMedieval and Tudor.\nThe small settlement at Rugby was taken over by the Anglo-Saxons around 560 AD, and it was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \"Rocheberie\"; there are several theories about the origin of the name, one is that it is derived from an old Celtic name \"Droche-brig\" meaning 'wild hilltop'. Another theory is that \"Rocheberie\" was a phonetic translation of the Old English name \"Hrocaberg\" meaning 'Hroca's hill fortification'; \"Hroca\" being an Anglo-Saxon man's name pronounced with a silent 'H', and \"berg\" being a name for a hill fortification, with the 'g' being pronounced as an 'ee' sound. By the 13th century the name of the town was commonly spelt as \"Rokeby\" (or \"Rookby\") before gradually evolving into the modern form by the 18th century.\nIn 1255, lord of the manor Henry de Rokeby obtained a market charter for Rugby, which became a small rural market town, which it remained until the 19th century. The layout of the streets in the town centre around the market place still follows the pattern set down in medieval times. Rugby's built-up area was only High Street and Sheep Street and North Street and the Market Place.\nThroughout the Middle Ages, Cistercian monks from Pipewell Abbey in Northamptonshire had an extensive presence in the Rugby area, owning granges and other properties in Rugby itself, plus the surrounding villages of Bilton, Cawston, Church Lawford, Cosford, Dunchurch, Little Lawford, Long Lawford, Newbold-on-Avon, and Thurlaston. Of these the most important was the grange at Cawston. This lasted until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century. \nIn the 12th century Rugby was mentioned as having a castle at the location of what is now Regent Place. However, the nature of the 'castle' is unknown, and it was possibly little more than a fortified manor house. In any event the 'castle' was short lived: It was probably constructed early in the reign of King Stephen (1135–1154) during the period of civil war known as The Anarchy, and then, as a so-called adulterine castle, built without Royal approval, demolished in around 1157 on the orders of King Henry II. The earthworks for the castle were still clearly visible as late as the 19th century, but have since been built over. According to one theory, the stones from the castle were later used to construct the west tower of St Andrew's Church which bears strong resemblance to a castle, and was probably intended for use in a defensive as well as a religious role.\nOne of the most significant events in the town's history was the founding in 1567 of Rugby School: Lawrence Sheriff, a locally born grocer to Queen Elizabeth I, left money in his will to establish a school in Rugby for local boys. The school needed to take some fee-paying pupils from outside the area, to help pay the bills, and gradually became a largely fee-paying school, with most of its pupils coming from outside Rugby. Eventually Lawrence Sheriff School was founded in 1878. to continue Sheriff's intention to provide a free grammar school for the boys of Rugby and surrounding villages. \nFrom medieval times until the late 18th century, the population of Rugby stayed at around 500–1000. It began to grow in the 1770s when the Oxford Canal was constructed around the town and spurred some growth in local industries and in population.\nBrushes with history.\nRugby and its surrounding area had several brushes with some of the most important events in English history.\nThe Rugby area has associations with the Gunpowder Plot – On the eve of the plot on 5 November 1605, the plotters stayed at an inn in nearby Dunchurch to await news of the plot. If it had been successful then they planned to kidnap the princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, who was staying at nearby Coombe Abbey, and install her as Queen.\nDuring the English Civil War in the 17th century, King Charles I is said to have passed through Rugby on his way to Nottingham with 120 Cavalier troops during 1642. The attitudes of the townsfolk were said to be too close to the Parliamentarian cause for the king's liking. One of the most important battles of the war, the Battle of Naseby was fought some 15 miles east of Rugby.\nIn April 1645 Oliver Cromwell stayed in Rugby along with two regiments of Roundhead troops. He is said to have stayed at the \"Shoulder of Mutton Inn\" (where the Marks and Spencers shop used to be)\n19th-century development.\nRugby for centuries was merely High Street, Sheep Street, North Street, and the Market Place. It only grew into an important settlement during the 19th century.\nInfluence of Rugby School.\nRugby School, one of England's oldest and most prestigious public schools, rose to national prominence in the 18th century, during the headmastership of Henry Holyoake (from 1688 to 1731). The school moved to its current location in 1750. Later, the teaching methods pioneered by its headmaster, Dr Thomas Arnold, which contributed to a radical change in Public School education in England. In 1823 William Webb Ellis is said to have invented Rugby Football when he picked up the ball and ran with it.\nThe growing popularity of the school in the 18th and early 19th century led to an increase in population of the town. Many immigrants came to Rugby, many of whom were Rugby School pupils' parents, who preferred their sons to be able to go to a normal home life each night instead of having to endure school conditions (poor food, crowding, bullies) 24 hours every day; in Rugby such immigrants were called \"sojourners\". This caused Rugby to expand along Bilton Road and Dunchurch Road.\nRugby School during this period was immortalised by Thomas Hughes in his semi-autobiographical novel Tom Brown's Schooldays.\nComing of the railways.\nThe major factor in the growth of Rugby was the arrival of railways. In 1835 Rugby was a small rural town with a population of around 2,500. However, in 1838, one of the first trunk lines to be built in England, the London and Birmingham Railway, an early part of what later became the West Coast Main Line, was built around the town.\nIn 1840, the Midland Counties Railway, which linked the East Midlands with North East England, formed a junction with the London and Birmingham, making Rugby the busiest and most important railway junction in Britain.\nSoon railways were being built into Rugby from several different directions. The main Trent Valley Line from Stafford was built into Rugby in 1847. A line to Market Harborough and Peterborough was opened in 1850, and a line to Leamington Spa was opened in 1851. The Northampton loop line to Northampton opened in 1881.\nFor nearly 30 years, nearly all rail traffic between London, the Midlands, the north of England, Scotland, and north Wales passed through Rugby junction, giving the town huge national importance.\nBy the 1860s the junction had become extremely congested, so much so that it was not uncommon for trains to have to queue for hours to pass through. This caused much anger and frustration amongst travellers, for whom Rugby became a byword for delays. Charles Dickens lampooned it in his short story Mugby Junction (1866). To relieve this congestion a new line, later called the Midland Main Line, was built, taking a more direct route to London, avoiding Rugby. Much traffic was diverted onto the new line; Rugby remained one of the most important railway junctions in the country, but was no longer an all-important hub.\nThe first Rugby railway station was opened in 1838 when the London &amp; Birmingham opened, located to the west of the present station. When the Midland Counties line was opened in 1840, the original station was badly located to serve the new line, and so a second station was opened close to the present one. This station lasted for over 40 years but proved to be inadequate to cope with traffic. In 1885 the present station was opened.\nIn 1899 the Great Central Railway was built into Rugby and the town gained a second station which offered an alternative route to London and the north.\nGrowth of industry.\nWith the railways, many wagon works, and engineering facilities were opened, and Rugby's population reached 10,000 by the 1880s, many employed by the railways. Because of its transport links, a number of industries developed in Rugby.\nIn 1862 the Rugby Lias Lime and Cement Co. Ltd. was founded, although manufacture of cement at the site began in 1855. Using the local Blue Lias clay.\nRugby began to develop more industries from the 1880s onwards. In 1881 a corset factory opened, employing local women. From the 1890s onwards Rugby began to attract engineering industry, due largely to its good transport links. The Willans &amp; Robinson works opened in Rugby in 1893 which made steam engines. And in 1899 the British Thomson-Houston works opened which made electrical equipment and later turbines. Engineering would dominate the town's economy for most of the following century.\nChallenges of growth.\nBy the middle of the 19th century Rugby's infrastructure had not kept pace with the increase in population. Most notably, there was not an adequate supply of drinking water which was mostly sourced from wells and street pumps, nor was there adequate sewerage or sanitation. These problems caused Rugby's growth to stall. In 1849 Rugby became the first town in England to have a Local board of health, beating Croydon by a matter of weeks. The board had powers to levy a rate to provide drinking water and sewage facilities as well as powers to clean and pave streets and provide street lighting. However several early schemes to provide adequate drinking water were unsuccessful. It was not until 1876 that a reliable supply was obtained from the River Avon.\nUntil the 1870s, the cattle market was still held in the town centre as it had been since the Middle Ages. However this became increasingly unpopular with local residents. In 1878 the cattle market was moved near the railway station and within the last few years has been transformed into a housing estate\nIn 1894 Rugby became an urban district and gained its first elected council.\n20th century.\nThe engineering works in Rugby attracted many workers to the town, and in the early decades of the 20th century the population grew rapidly and Rugby's built-up area spread fast in all directions. In 1901 the population of Rugby was 16,950, by the 1930s it had reached 40,000.\nDue to its expansion Rugby became a municipal borough in 1932, and the old Rugby Urban District Council was replaced with Rugby Borough Council. The nearby parishes of Bilton, Brownsover, Hillmorton and Newbold-on-Avon were incorporated into the new borough. Further local government reform in 1974 saw the borough expand to include the whole of the abolished Rugby Rural District.\nFrom 1926, near Rugby to its east was a large antenna farm for the Rugby VLF transmitter. All but four of the twelve big radio masts (used to broadcast the MSF time signal) were demolished in June 2004 – delayed by rabbits chewing through the wires controlling detonation. The other four were demolished in 2007.\nIn the late 1930s Frank Whittle developed the jet engine in Rugby. With his work taking place at the British Thomson-Houston works, and at Brownsover Hall.\nUnlike nearby Coventry and Nuneaton, Rugby was highly fortunate to avoid German bombing during the Second World War. This is perhaps somewhat surprising given the town's strategic importance as a railway junction and engineering centre. A few stray bombs landed on Dunchurch and some meant for the English Electric works caused damage to housing at New Bilton, but no other significant bomb damage occurred in the area. According to local legend, a reason why Rugby was not bombed substantially by the Germans during the war was because Unity Mitford, a close friend of Hitler was staying at Hillmorton.\nIn the postwar years Rugby became a centre of the national motorway network. Two of Britain's most important motorways, the M1 and M6, as well as the M45, run close to the town. Rugby expanded further, especially at Brownsover and Cawston where new housing estates were built.\nHowever, during the 1960s several of the railway lines which radiated from Rugby were closed as part of the Beeching axe. These included the once hugely important Midland Counties route to Leicester, the lines to Leamington and Peterborough, and the Great Central Line. Rugby Central Station was closed in 1969, leaving the town with only one station. As of 2006, only the West Coast Mainline still serves the town. During the 1990s the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal, located just four miles to the east of the town, opened with connections to continental Europe and beyond.\nFrom the 1950s, Rugby gained a substantial Afro-Caribbean community, and a sizable community from the Indian sub-continent, making Rugby a multi-cultural town. There is a small Hindu temple in Rugby; it was converted from two adjacent terrace houses.\n21st century.\nTwo major housing developments have rapidly increased the population of Rugby. The first called \"Cawston Grange\" was started in 2003 and vastly enlarged the then tiny hamlet of Cawston to the south-west of the town. Facilities there include a primary school, shops, and a community centre. Cawston is now connected to the rest of the town via Bilton. In conjunction with this the 3.7-mile Rugby Western Relief Road connecting Cawston with Newbold-on-Avon via New Bilton was completed in 2010. As of 2018 a second wave of development in the area was well underway.\nThe second major area of development was to the east of the town between Hillmorton and Crick. Located on the site of the former Rugby Radio Station, which was demolished in 2007, the new estate has been named Houlton and upon completion it is projected it will contain 6,200 houses. The first homeowners of phase one moved in during December 2017. There is currently a public restaurant/cafe, a village hall and a primary school, with other facilities planned.\nThe cattle market near the railway station was closed in May 2008. On the site were built houses, offices, a doctor's surgery, a small Tesco supermarket and a Travelodge hotel. The Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal was extended in 2011 and plans to extend it further are well in place."

        "text": "The Presidents Cup is the national Senior-level box lacrosse championship for the Canadian Lacrosse Association. The annual Championship awards a \"Gold\", \"Silver\", and \"Bronze\" placing. The skill levels have been adjusted in recent years; Senior \"B\" teams from across Canada now compete for the Presidents Cup (as before it was all Senior teams). Senior \"A\" is now represented by Ontario's Major Series Lacrosse and the Western Lacrosse Association (British Columbia), who compete for the Mann Cup.\nHistory.\nThere have been three trophies used for the Presidents Cup championships. The original trophy was known as the \"Castrol Oil Presidents Trophy\" and was awarded to teams from 1964 until 1971. \nIn 1972, a new trophy was donated as a replacement and the old Castrol Oil trophy retired. The second trophy was in use from 1972 until 1995 when it too was retired. While the original Castrol Oil trophy was donated to the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1979, the second trophy was put into storage and became forgotten. Its existence was completely unknown to the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame until the Canadian Lacrosse Association contacted the hall in late 2016 when it was found in their storage, which was donated to the lacrosse hall in February 2016. The original trophy underwent restoration work in 2015-2016 however the second trophy is still in need of some repair. \nThe current trophy was donated for use starting in 1996 and has the following inscription: \"Donated by the Iroquois Lacrosse Association and the '95 Presidents Cup winners, the Akwesasne Thunder, in honour and memory of the late Frank 'Tewisateni' Roundpoint, \"Grandfather of Lacrosse\", Akwesasne Mohawk Nation.\"\nThe first two years (1964-1965) of competition were essentially the result of provincial championship play in Ontario. The Hagerville Warriors won the Ontario Senior ‘B’ Championship in 1964 – however at some point they were later included in the list of Canadian national champions for Senior ‘B’ as the Ohsweken Warrriors even though 1965 was reported in the newspaper press at that time as the first year of a National Senior ‘B’ Championship in Canada. The following year the Fergus Thistles won the Ontario Senior ‘B’ Championship. Port Alberni Labatts won the British Columbia Senior ‘B’ Championship and arrangements were made for a National Championship series to be played – however it never took place. \n1965 saw the first true national competition between teams from different provinces when the Nanaimo Luckies and defending Fergus Thistles met in Nanaimo, British Columbia in a best of five series, which was swept 3-0 by Nanaimo and required a replay of the final 7 minutes and 15 seconds of the second game of the series after Fergus Thistles protested an officiating call."

        "title": "Mike Curtis (American football)",
        "text": "James Michael \"Mike\" Curtis (March 27, 1943 – April 20, 2020), nicknamed \"Mad Dog\" or \"The Animal,\" was an American professional football player for the Baltimore Colts, Seattle Seahawks, and Washington Redskins. He played a total of 14 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), running from 1965 to 1978.\nCurtis was a four-time Pro Bowler, named to the squad in 1968, 1970, 1971, and 1974. Although sacks were not official during the time he played, Curtis was a good blitzer, recording 22½ sacks, and pass defender, picking off 25 passes. He was named the AFC Defensive Player of the Year in 1970 by a panel of 101 sportswriters.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nMike Curtis was born March 27, 1943, in Rockville, Maryland. He attended Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville, where he played football, tipping the scales at 195 pounds and playing fullback as a junior in 1959.\nCollege career.\nCurtis was offered a number of athletic scholarships to play college football, ultimately deciding to accept the offer of Duke University, located in Durham, North Carolina. He later recalled that he had enormous trouble with the adjustment, unhappy and homesick, and nearly flunking out of school due to a failure to apply himself academically. Moreover, he was injured playing freshman football, hurting his knee and breaking a bone in his hand.\nA report card filled with three F grades, two Ds, and an A in physical education had an invigorating effect, Curtis noted in his 1972 memoir: \"It was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I realized then that the most important thing in my life was to graduate from college. Nothing else, including football, was important.\"\nCurtis declined to fill his spring schedule with easy physical education classes, as suggested by the Duke athletic department, instead taking classes that put him on a degree track and attending summer school after his freshman year. He changed his academic major from business to history to ease his path in the classroom.\nOn the football field, Curtis played both sides of the ball — fullback on offense and middle linebacker on defense.\nAlthough he suffered four knee injuries during the course of his college football career, Curtis finished his Duke career as a two-time All-Atlantic Coast Conference selection as well as an Academic All-American.\nProfessional career.\nCurtis was drafted in the first round of the 1965 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Colts, originally slated as fullback. He was also drafted in the third round of the 1965 AFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. Players had significant financial leverage in this period, with two teams competing for their services, and Curtis received a healthy two-year contract to play for the Colts. The deal paid him $15,000 for the 1965 season and $17,000 for 1966, plus a signing bonus of $22,000 — a total of $54,000 (about $535,000 in 2024) for two years.\nDuring his rookie season with the Colts, Curtis was listed third on the depth chart at fullback, playing behind Tony Lorick and Jerry Hill. He was moved to outside linebacker in 1966. After being named an All Pro in 1968 — a year in which the Colts led the NFL in scoring defense en route to winning the NFL Championship — he was moved to middle linebacker, for which he would be selected to the Pro Bowl for each of the next three years.\nCurtis, Ray May, and Hall of Famer Ted \"The Mad Stork\" Hendricks formed a potent linebacking corps from 1970 to 1973, helping the team to victory in January 1971 in Super Bowl V against the Dallas Cowboys. That 1970 season was one of Curtis' finest, in which he had five interceptions, including a key pick that set up the Colts' game-winning field goal in the championship game. \nCurtis was named the Colts' Most Valuable Player in 1974. He was a team captain for most of his Baltimore career. He was selected to the Pro Bowl four times between 1968 and 1974 — all years in which he wore the blue-and-white uniform of the Colts.\nCurtis' 1975 season was cut short on November 12 when he opted for surgery to repair cartilage in his left knee, which he had injured in a preseason game in early September. Despite the objections of head coach Ted Marchibroda, Curtis was left unprotected for the 1976 NFL Expansion Draft due to a personality conflict with general manager Joe Thomas. \"I heard indirectly that I was in the expansion draft because Joe Thomas hated my guts,\" he said. \"Thomas could have had a first-round draft choice or better for me if he had wanted it.\"\nCurtis was selected by the Seattle Seahawks on March 30, 1976. He started all 14 regular-season games during the Seahawks' inaugural campaign and was the team's first defensive captain. The Seahawks returned him to right outside linebacker for the season and Curtis responded like a professional, finishing the year second on the team in tackles, with 107.\nAfter being supplanted by Ken Geddes on the depth chart prior to the start of the 1977 season, he was waived by the Seahawks on September 6. He signed with the Washington Redskins three days later. He started 11 games in place of the injured Chris Hanburger in 1977, but only two of the 13 contests in which he played the following year. His intention to retire after the 1979 season was expedited before the campaign began when he was released by the Redskins on August 7.\nLife after football.\nCurtis married and had three children - two boys and a girl.\nA self-described \"loner\" who preferred his own company or that of his family, Curtis had a 44-acre farm near Leesburg, Virginia, purchased with his loser's share of the proceeds of Super Bowl III. He also owned a house in Rockville, Maryland, and invested a good part of his football income buying and selling real estate.\nDeath and legacy.\nCurtis struggled with memory loss late in life, a condition associated with damage due to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease caused by repeated head injuries.\nHe died peacefully, surrounded by loved ones on April 20, 2020, in St. Petersburg, Florida. His family donated his brain to the Brain Injury Research Institute for examination in association with their ongoing study of CTE.\nCurtis is remembered for his role as a losing member of the Colts team in Super Bowl III, still regarded as one of the greatest upsets in NFL history. During the 1971 season, still active with the Colts, Curtis wrote a memoir of his career to date, \"Keep Off My Turf.\" In it he stated that the New York Jets, who upset the Colts that day, were lucky:\n\"Our team was twice as good as the Jets. Twice as good. There wasn't any comparison between the two teams. If [Jimmy] Orr and [Tom] Mitchell had been able to catch those two passes for touchdowns early in the game, it would have been a romp. We've beaten them every time we've played them since. That says something. But it still can't erase that day in the Super Bowl.\"\nHe is also remembered more positively for his game-changing interception and return with little more than one minute left in Super Bowl V, setting up Colts kicker Jim O'Brien for the game-winning field goal.\nHis friend and teammate, Colts center Bill Curry recalled of Curtis: \"You really missed the thrill of getting to see a great NFL linebacker if you didn't see him play... It was like watching the guy with the muscularity of a defensive tackle who could run like a corner. It was incredible to see him run people down. How could he do that? But he did it every day.\""

        "title": "Transworld Skateboarding",
        "text": "Transworld Skateboarding (TWS) is an international magazine on skateboarding that was based in Carlsbad, California, United States. The publication also ran an accompanying website and video production company. In February 2019, the publishers of \"Transworld\" magazine, The Enthusiast Network, were purchased by American Media, Inc. In March 2019, the print edition of Transworld magazine was discontinued. It continues as a digital brand.\nA satellite edition, \"Transworld Skateboarding Japan\", is published in Japan.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\n\"Transworld Skateboarding\" was founded in 1983 to rival \"Thrasher\" magazine with a slogan of \"skate and create\" as opposed to \"skate and destroy\". It was intended as a more accessible alternative to \"Thrasher Magazine\". For example, a December 1982 \"Thrasher\" article, \"Skate and Destroy\", written by C. R. Stecyk III under the pen name \"Lowboy\", was criticized. A February 1983 advertisement for Independent Trucks featured a topless female model with the brand's decals displayed on her breasts.\nThe public release of \"Transworld Skateboarding\" occurred under the ownership of Peggy Cozens and Larry Balma, owner of the Tracker Trucks brand. Initially, the magazine's editorial teams were known collectively as the \"United Skate Front\", and Balma later spoke of the magazine’s beginnings as a reaction to \"Thrasher\", explaining in a 2003 \"Union-Tribune\" interview: \"They were pretty harsh, sex and drugs and using four-letter words and all that and in the early '80s, the sport started growing and [Thrasher] wasn't the best magazine for young kids\".\nThe first issue of \"TWS\" contained the article \"Skate and Create\". Its author, Peggy Cozens, noted, \"I have become increasingly concerned about a new skate attitude being pushed on skaters: Skate and Destroy\". She highlighted the positive and creative side of skating. The stance of the new magazine remained positive, to the extent that even \"Thrasher\" owner Fausto Vitello wrote, \"They were about Skate and Create; we were about Skate and Destroy.\"\nThe magazine recruited graphic designer David Carson into the position of art director in 1984, and he remained with \"TWS\" until 1988; he imbued the magazine with a distinctive look. Between 1984 and 1988, the magazine featured the photographic work of J. Grant Brittain and Spike Jonze, and editorial contributions from professional skateboarders such as Lance Mountain, Tony Hawk, Neil Blender, Steve Berra, Marty 'Jinx' Jimenez, Garry Scott Davis and Mark Gonzales.\nTime Warner ownership.\nIn 1997, the magazine was sold for 475 million to the Times Mirror in 2000.\nInternal tensions between magazine staff and AOL Time Warner started after a new publishers with no understanding of the company culture were sent to manage the publications at the Carlsbad office. Slowly the company starting firing long-serving employees and replacing them with new employees that fit their undefined corporate vision. The culmination of this was when internal tensions prompted the resignation of several key founding editorial members, such as J. Grant Britain, Dave Swift, and Atiba Jefferson—journalists who later launched \"The Skateboard Mag\" publication that was first published in April 2004. Jefferson, whose seminal mentor was Brittain, revealed in May 2012:\n\"So, in 2004, we were all working at Transworld with Dave Swift (photographer), Grant ... Brittain. I think I'd gotten to the point—you've done everything you kinda could. And, with that magazine being bought and sold that many times, and being corporate-owned, a lot of things had changed. Even when I started working at Transworld, it was just owned by the Balma's; it was independently owned. It was just different, it wasn't the same. There was a lot of things that became very corporate about it. And that was just-it is so hard to do with skating. There were so many things we couldn't justify. So we decided to break off and start out own magazine, \"The Skateboard Mag\", in 2004.\"\nJefferson's view was reinforced seven years earlier in an interview that Brittain participated in with the \"Union-Tribune\", whereby Jefferson's mentor stated, \"We did not like the whole corporate deal, not knowing what was in every issue ad-wise. It wasn't about skateboarding anymore.\"\nBonnier Group ownership.\nOn September 12, 2006, Time Warner announced the sale of Time4 Media, a company that consisted of a portfolio of eighteen print magazines that included the Transworld group of titles. The rationale for the sale was that Time Warner sought \"to focus our energy, resources and investment on our biggest and most profitable brands\". The eighteen Time4 Media properties were eventually sold for over US$200 million on January 25, 2007 to the Bonnier Group—a 200-year-old Swedish media and entertainment company with a net income of approximately US$20 million, an annual revenue of US$350 million, and businesses in twenty countries. The deal was finalized by March 1, 2007, and an internal memo from Time4 Media president Tom Beusse was published on the Internet, in which he stated:\nBonnier has adopted a decentralized approach in managing their 150 businesses because they believe in the potential and ability of individuals, and they are notorious for being very good to employees. They also understand vertical media brands and the value of their connection with passionate enthusiast audiences. Bonnier's acquisition of our businesses is excellent recognition of that value, as well as the quality of our brands and talent of our staff. Together we have the unique opportunity to build a new multi-platform media company on an incredible foundation.\nSince the departure of Dave Swift as editor of \"Transworld Skateboarding\" in 2004, the magazine and website is overseen by Skin Phillips (Editor-in-Chief) and is the largest skateboarding magazine in the world. As of March 2013, the magazine's editors are listed as Oliver Barton (Bartok), Blair Alley, Ben Kelly, Kevin Duffel, Joey Muellner (Shigeo), Chris Thiesson and Dave Chami. The magazine's headquarters in Carlsbad also houses an indoor skate park that is a \"5,000-square-foot 'plaza' complete with simulated brick banks and real concrete ledges\", and it is estimated that over 2,500 people attend the facility every year. In early 2013, the Bonnier International Magazines website revealed that a full page, four-color advertisement in the magazine can be purchased for US$22,271.\nIn the second decade of the 21st century, the magazine launched Transworld.tv, an online video platform that is described by the publication as a service that \"offers compelling and relevant selections of action sports clips, trailers, webisodes, and live webcasts through a single website viewable across multiple screens including mobile devices, personal computers, e-readers, and traditional television screens\".\nThe publication's 2013 media kit cites a readership total of 619,886, a monthly print circulation of 87,308, and a total annual brand audience total of 13,092,000. As of March 2, 2013, the magazine's Facebook fan page had received 448,102 \"likes\" and the 2013 media kit claimed 298,000 monthly website visitors, 58,000 Twitter followers, 82,000 Instagram followers, 75,000 viewers of its \"online on-demand video platform\" Transworld.tv and 20,394 subscribers to its YouTube channel.\nGrindMedia acquisition.\nAn official announcement was released on May 20, 2013, to mark the acquisition of Transworld media by the GrindMedia company that is owned by Source Interlink. The Bonnier Corporation's decision occurred after it divested of the Mountain Group, which includes \"Ski\", \"Skiing\" and \"Warren Miller\" titles and its Parenting Group. At the time of the acquisition, GrindMedia owned the forty-nine-year-old title \"Skateboarder Magazine\", which was transformed into a free digital publication, with a bimonthly print replica, in April 2013.\nFormer \"Skateboarder\" Editor-In-Chief Jaime Owens was announced as the new Editor-In-Chief of \"Transworld Skateboarding\" in October 2013. Owens got the job as it became open around the time that the production of \"Skateboarder\" magazine ceased in August 2012 and explained what \"Transworld Skateboarding\" means to him in an October 29, 2013, interview with the magazine: \"TWS‘ hallmark has always been amazing photography of the biggest names in skateboarding. Growing up with Transworld meant I was always seeing the best skateboarding being done by the best skaters shot by the best photographers. That documentation of skateboarding is unsurpassed.\"\nGrindMedia’s parent company, Source Interlink Media (SIM), published a press release in May 2014 to announce a rebranding to the new name: \"The Enthusiast Network\" (TEN). As part of the rebranding process, the GrindMedia umbrella brand became the \"TEN: Action/Outdoor\" brand and remained a part of the new TEN brand. The press release stated that TEN sought to transform into a \"Web-Led, Socially Amplified Media Model\" and TEN Chief Executive Officer Scott Dickey—who was hired in February 2014—explained: \"It is not up to us to decide how our consumers choose to interact with our brands ... Our job is to provide them with the content they want, where they want it, and when they want it. Our business model needs to reflect this new reality.\"\na360media Acquisition.\nIn February 2019, \"Transworld Skateboarding\" was acquired by a360media, formerly American Media.\nThe Arena Group Acquisition.\nIn 2022, The Arena Group acquired \"Transworld Skateboarding\".\nCharity work and causes.\nThe Bonnier Corporation associated the magazine with charities such as the Tony Hawk Foundation, Texas Skate Jam, Make-A-Wish, and Elemental Awareness, identifying the publication as a regular contributor to such programs.\nIn October 2012, the magazine featured and promoted the \"Free Fabes\" campaign, organized by the DGK skateboard company, on its website. The campaign sought to raise legal funds for former professional skateboarder, Fabian Alomar, who was arrested and detained earlier in the year for a non-violent drug possession charge.\nVideography.\nThe magazine has released a series of skateboarding videos (in chronological order):\n\"Transworld Skateboarding\" has also released a number of additional video projects:"

        "text": "George Washington Case (November 11, 1915 – January 23, 1989) was an American left and right fielder in Major League Baseball who played most of his career for the Washington Senators. Possibly the sport's fastest player between the 1920s and 1950s, he is the only player to lead the major leagues in stolen bases five consecutive times (–), and his six overall league titles tied Ty Cobb's American League record; that mark was later broken by Luis Aparicio. His 349 career steals ranked ninth in AL history at the end of his career, and were the most by any player from 1930 to 1960; his 321 steals with the Senators were the third most in Washington history.\nBorn in Trenton, New Jersey, Case attended Trenton Central High School and then the Peddie School in Hightstown, from which he graduated in 1936. He made his first appearance with the Senators in September , and in his rookie season batted .305. In 1939 he batted .302, led the Senators with 103 runs, and topped the league for the first time with 51 steals, also earning the first of four All-Star selections. In he posted career highs in runs (109), hits (192) and runs batted in (56) while recording 35 steals. After having 33 stolen bases and leading the AL in assists in , he hit a career-high .320 in , again scoring over 100 runs with 44 steals. In 1943 he won his fifth straight title with 61 stolen bases, equalling the highest total in the major leagues between 1921 and 1961; he also led the AL with 102 runs, with a personal best of 36 doubles and a .294 average, as the Senators enjoyed their first winning season since 1936, finishing second in the AL to the New York Yankees. saw him slip to a .250 average and only 63 runs, though he finished second to Snuffy Stirnweiss in the AL with 49 steals. saw him again finish second to Stirnweiss with 30 steals as he raised his average to .294; the Senators again finished second, only a game and a half behind the Detroit Tigers, and Case earned his last All-Star selection (though the game was cancelled due to war restrictions) and finished ninth in the MVP voting.\nIn December 1945, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Jeff Heath; in he won his last stolen base title with 28, though he only batted .225 with just 46 runs. During that season, new Indians owner Bill Veeck staged one of his famous promotions, matching Case against Jesse Owens in a 100-yard race which Owens won. In March Case was traded back to the Senators, and after hitting for a .150 average in 36 games he retired due to spinal problems which had plagued him throughout his career. Over his 11-year career he batted .282 with 785 runs, 1,415 hits, 21 home runs and 377 RBI in 1,226 games played. His 321 steals with the Senators placed him behind only Clyde Milan (495) and Sam Rice (346) in Washington history. He surpassed the .300 mark three times in the majors.\nIn retirement, Case opened a sporting goods store in Trenton, and also coached at Rutgers from 1950 to 1960, winning the school's only College World Series berth in his first year. He later coached for the expansion Senators from 1961–63, and for the Minnesota Twins (the relocated original Senators) in 1968; he also managed in the Pacific Coast League for two seasons in the 1960s. In 1969 he became a minor league instructor for the Yankees, and later had the same position with the Seattle Mariners. He died of emphysema at age 73 in Trenton."

In 1980 the Rhodesia cricket team was renamed as the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia cricket team, and in 1981 it adopted its current name of the Zimbabwe national cricket team.\nClub history.\nThe Rhodesian Cricket Union was formed in 1898 as the governing body of the game in the colony. Rhodesia competed in South Africa's Currie Cup championship from 1905, but its appearances were sporadic at first. Having lost their inaugural match to Transvaal by an innings and 170 runs, Rhodesia did not play in the Currie Cup again until 1929–30. They also played in 1931–32, winning four out of five matches, but losing the cup to Western Province under the points system then in use. The Rhodesian team then did not return until 1946–47, after which they at last played regularly. The Rhodesian team toured other areas of Africa. In 1951 they toured their northern neighbours East Africa.\nRhodesia was visited by a New Zealand team at the start of their tour of South Africa in October 1961. They played two three day first-class games against Rhodesia, the first in Bulawayo and the second in Sailsbury. Both matches ended in draws.\nA total of 242 cricketers represented Rhodesia with noted Rhodesian players including Denis Tomlinson, Chris Duckworth, Tony Pithey, David Pithey, Jackie du Preez, Joe Partridge, Godfrey Lawrence and Colin Bland. These were the only Rhodesian born cricketers to represent South Africa, together with Shropshire-born Percy Mansell and the South Africans Paul Winslow, Mike Procter, Peter Carlstein and Egyptian-born John Traicos but the team never won the Currie Cup. The team played in 1979–80 as \"Zimbabwe-Rhodesia\" and left the competition for good at the close of that season, after Zimbabwe officially became independent.\nRhodesian players were eligible to represent South Africa in Test cricket until the country became Zimbabwe.\nVenues.\nRhodesian venues included: "

This is the final book in the Magnakai series.\nGameplay.\nLone Wolf books rely on a combination of thought and luck. Certain statistics such as combat skill and endurance attributes are determined randomly before play (reading). The player is then allowed to choose which Magnakai disciplines or skills he or she possess. This number depends directly on how many books in the series have been completed (\"Magnakai rank\"). With each additional book completed, the player chooses one additional Magnakai discipline.\nThe final book in the Magnakai series further reveals the quirks of the Lone Wolf game system, including putting players who have not played through the previous books at a substantial disadvantage in terms of Magnakai skills and rank. Nonetheless, it is still possible to triumph.\nPlot.\nAfter his struggles in the plane of Daziarn, Lone Wolf finally recovers the last of the Lorestones and finds a Shadow Gate back to his home. Unfortunately, upon his return, he finds that considerable time has passed and that, in his absence, the Darklords have conquered much of Magnamund. Now with all of the Lorestones' wisdom absorbed within him, and the hopes of Sommerlund and all the free peoples of Magnamund on his shoulders, Lone Wolf must travel to the very heart of the Darklords' foul realm, to the infernal city of Helgedad, and confront Archlord Gnaag himself. The adventure culminates with a spectacular battle in Helgedad and the destruction of the Darklords' principal city."

It was the final ranking event of the 2001–02 snooker season. This was the 26th consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship had been held at the Crucible, marking the 25th anniversary of the first staging of the event at this venue. The championship was sponsored by cigarette manufacturer Embassy.\nPeter Ebdon won his only world title by defeating seven-time winner Stephen Hendry 18–17 in the final. Ebdon defeated Matthew Stevens 17–16 in the semi-finals, and Hendry defeated the defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan 17–13 to reach the final. This was Hendry's ninth and last appearance in a World Championship final. There were 65 century breaks during the tournament. The highest break of the tournament was by Stevens, who achieved 145 in his quarter-final match. Hendry made 16 centuries during the event, a record for any individual tournament, equalled by Mark Williams in 2022. A total prize fund of £1,615,770 was awarded at the event, the winner receiving £260,000\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is the official world championship of the game of professional snooker, organised by World Snooker. Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the sport was popular in the British Isles. In the modern era it has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nThe championship featured 32 professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single elimination format, each played over several . The 32 competitors in the main tournament were selected using a combination of the top players in the world snooker rankings and a pre-tournament qualification stage. Joe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, the final match being held in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held in the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The championship was sponsored by cigarette manufacturer Embassy.\nFormat.\nThe championship was held from 20 April and 6 May 2002 at the Crucible Theatre, the 26th consecutive year that the tournament was held at the venue. It was the ninth and last ranking event of the 2001–02 snooker season on the World Snooker Tour. There were 120 entrants from the tour, and the competition's main draw had 32 participants. Following a seven-round amateur qualifying tournament, a six-round knockout qualifying competition was held at the Manhattan Club, Harrogate, the Telford International Centre and the Newport Centre in Newport, Wales. This qualifying tournament produced the 16 qualifying players who progressed into the main draw to play the top 16 seeds.\nThe top 16 players in the latest world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. As defending champion, Ronnie O'Sullivan was seeded first for the event with world number one Mark Williams seeded second; the remaining seeds were allocated based on the players' world ranking positions. Matches in the first round of the main draw were played as best-of-19-frames. The number of frames needed to win a match increased to being the best-of-25 in the second round and quarter-finals, and best-of-33 in the semi-finals; the final match was played as best-of-35-frames.\nPrize fund.\nThe tournament featured a prize fund of £1,615,770 with the winner receiving £260,000 and bonuses for completing a maximum break. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played as the best-of-19 frames matches, held over two sessions. The defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan's opening match against Drew Henry was delayed for 25 minutes due to a problem with the scoreboard. The first six were shared, but from 3–3 O'Sullivan won six in a row to lead 9–3, and won the match at 10–5. Quinten Hann became the first Australian player to reach the second round since Eddie Charlton in 1989. Hann, a WEPF World Eightball Championship winner, had smashed the pack of reds open when breaking off in the sixth frame, from which Paul Hunter made a 77 break and took the frame. An uncommon shot, commentator Dennis Taylor described it as \"bordering on ungentlemanly conduct\". Hunter was 6–3 ahead after their first session, but Hann won the match 10–9. Seven-time winner Stephen Hendry recorded a break of 130 in frame three of his match with Shaun Murphy and led 6–3 at the end of their first session. He won the last frame with a break of 111 as he completed a 10–4 victory.&lt;ref name=\"White/Dale\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Bingham narrowly missed out on a maximum break during his match against Ken Doherty, failing to pot the . Doherty later won the match 10–8.\nJames Wattana won only one frame of his match against John Higgins. Higgins made breaks of 109, 136 and 116 in winning 10–1. Peter Ebdon led Michael Judge 5–4 at the end of their first session then took five frames in a row to win 10–4. Dominic Dale, who had been ill with food poisoning in the days before his match with Jimmy White, accused White of making a , pretended to go to sleep in his chair during the final frame, and after losing 2–10, snapped his own and threw it out of his dressing-room window. This match and the contest between Hunter and Hann which were being played simultaneously, were interrupted by a streaker wearing a Sven-Göran Eriksson mask.\nSecond round.\nThe second round featured matches played as the best-of-25 frames held over up to three sessions. O'Sullivan defeated Robert Milkins 13–2 in only two sessions. When the third session was scheduled to be played O'Sullivan visited a chiropractor. O'Sullivan said \"I've got an imbalance in my body and I find it hard to walk, among other things.\" Hann smashed the pack of reds on the break-off shot four times during his 3–13 loss to Stephen Lee. Lee commented after the match \"I don't know why Quinten [Hann] plays like that... perhaps he actually wants to go home early?\" Qualifier Anthony Davies trailed 2–6 after the first session, and won just one frame in the second session as he was defeated 3–13 by Hendry. Doherty won eight frames in a row to go from 3–7 behind to 11–7 ahead against Mark King. King forced the match to a decider, which was won by Doherty 13–12. Higgins notched up five century breaks and defeated Dott 13–2. Ebdon and Joe Perry shared the frames in their first session and tied 4–4. Ebdon won seven of the next eight frames to lead 11–5 after the second session, and later won 13–7.\nWhite played Matthew Stevens and lost 3–13 with a .&lt;ref name=\"White/Stevens\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighth and final frame in the first session, White had missed a on the , and as the returned towards him, hit it with such force that both balls were both forced off the table. He issued an apology before resuming play the following day. World number one Mark Williams was defeated 9–13 by world number 19 Anthony Hamilton. Hamilton had been defeated by Williams in the final of the China Open earlier in the season, despite being ahead by three frames. He commented that he had been \"shaking like a leaf\" in making his match winning break but that the previous match spurred him to victory. Williams commented that, despite being ranked number one in the world, his performances were not good enough: \"I'm sick with the way I performed. I don't enjoy playing that bad but I seem to play like that fairly often. I don't know what it is.\"\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played as best-of-25 frames matches, held over three sessions. During his second session match again Lee, O'Sullivan missed a shot on the , throwing his cue stick in the air in frustration. He was unable to catch it, damaging the table, which had to be fixed before the next session. With the scores tied at 10-10, O'Sullivan made breaks of 83, 102 and 113 to win the match 13–10. Stephen Hendry and Ken Doherty were tied after the first session, Hendry winning four frames in a row to lead 8–4, but Doherty won the next four to tie at 8–8. With the match also tied at 12-12, Hendry made a break of 91 to win 13–12. Post-match, Hendry commented: \"Ken and I always have brilliant matches, but this one was special\".\nJohn Higgins, who had only conceded three frames in his previous two matches, trailed 0–3 to Stevens in the quarter-finals. Higgins won four frames in a row, before Stevens tied the match at 4–4 in the first session. Stevens made the highest break of the championship, a 145 in frame 11, and held a four frame lead after the second session. Stevens won three of the next four frames to win 13–7 and reach his third successive semi-final. Ebdon reached the semi-finals for the second time, as he beat Hamilton 13–6. Ebdon commented that he preferred the longer frame matches and cited his physical condition as having prepared him well for the match.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played as best-of-33 frames matches, held over four sessions between 3 and 4 May. Before the match between O'Sullivan and Hendry, O'Sullivan made comments due to a dispute from their last meeting at the tournament, where Hendry accused O'Sullivan of playing a . He commented \"the most satisfying thing for me to send Stephen Hendry back home to Scotland\", and that \"there is not a lot of respect there at all\". He also made comments about Hendry's manager Ian Doyle, who was a previous manager to O'Sullivan. John Dee for \"the Daily Telegraph\" commented that O'Sullivan had \"blown hot and cold\" during interviews, and the comments surprised him. O'Sullivan experienced the Crucible curse as he lost 13–17 to Hendry. O'Sullivan had started the match with a break of 115 in the opening frame and led 5–3 at the end of the first session. In the second session, Hendry moved into a 9–7 lead, with breaks of 125, 122 and 124. The third session ended with the players tied at 12–12. In the final session Hendry took a 16–12 lead and went on to win 17–13.\nIn the other semi-final, Ebdon led Stevens 5–3 after the first session and then 9–7 after the second. It was all square after the third, at 12–12. Stevens moved within one frame of victory at 16–14. In frame 31, leading by 33 points, with 35 points remaining, Stevens lost position, and Ebdon cleared the table to win the frame. Ebdon made a 138 in the penultimate frame and won a deciding frame with a break of 55 to win the match 17–16. After the match, Ebdon commented that he \"can't believe he won\", and that he felt \"sorry\" for Stevens, because he knew \"how he feels right now\".\nFinal.\nThe final held between Ebdon and Hendry was played as a best-of-35 frames match over four sessions on 5 and 6 May. Ebdon (seeded seventh) and Hendry (fifth) had also competed in the 1996 final, Hendry winning 18–12 to gain his sixth world title. Over eight million viewers watched the 2002 final in the expectation of Hendry winning his eighth world title; many commentators also favoured Hendry to win the event again. The final was refereed by John Williams, his tenth final. Ebdon took the first four frames of the match to lead 4–0 at the first mid-session interval, but Hendry pulled back the next four frames to end the first session tied at 4–4. By the end of the second session, Ebdon was again four frames ahead at 10–6, and then took the first frame of the third session to lead 11–6, but Hendry fought back and levelled the score at 12–12 by the end of the third session.\nHendry made a strong start to the final session, taking the lead for the first time with breaks of 63, 55 and 38, to put him 14–12 ahead. Ebdon won the next two frames to draw level at 14–14, after Hendry missed a relatively simple red in the 28th frame. Hendry then compiled a break of 58 in frame 29, to lead 15–14, but Ebdon took three of the next four frames with breaks of 73, 111 and 85 to move ahead 17–16. Poised to win the championship, Ebdon was 52–27 up in frame 34 when he missed a straight pot on the black on its spot, allowing Hendry to clear the colours and level the match at 17–17.\nThis was the second time that Hendry had been taken to a deciding frame in the World Championship final, having also done so in 1994 when he defeated White 18–17. Hendry was the first to score in the decider, just seven points, before Ebdon compiled a break of 59. Then, with just three reds remaining on the table, Hendry potted the cue ball while attempting to play a snooker, giving Ebdon his chance to take the frame and win the match 18–17.\nWith his win, Ebdon received a cheque for £260,000 and moved up to third place in the end-of-season world rankings (behind O'Sullivan and Williams). In a post-match interview, he said \"It's what I have been working for and dreaming about for the last 17 years... I wasn't ready to win it six years ago, but I've improved as a player and as a person\". Hendry ultimately blamed his defeat on nerves and poor concentration, but also conceded that Ebdon was a stronger player than he had been in their previous world final encounter in 1996. This was Hendry's last appearance in a World Championship final, and he reached his last ranking final four years later at the 2006 UK Championship, where he again lost to Ebdon. \"The Guardian\"'s Sean Ingle described the final as \"one of the sporting highlights of the year.\"\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for each round. The numbers in parentheses beside some of the players are their seeding ranks. Players in bold denote match winners:\nQualifying.\nFollowing amateur pre-qualifying, seven rounds of qualifying were played at the Manhattan Club, Harrogate. After Harrogate there were a further five rounds of qualifying at Telford International Centre. The final qualifying round was held at Newport on 16 and 17 March 2002. Willie Thorne, in his 27th world championship, lost in the seventh round of amateur pre-qualifying to Stephen Croft. Thorne was the only entrant in the qualifiers to have played at the first Crucible finals in 1977. Three-times semi-finalist Tony Knowles lost 3–5 to Rob James in the third round. During her fifth-round defeat, Kelly Fisher became the first female player to compile a century break at the World Championship, making a 106.\nRound 1.\nThe first round of qualifying took place in Telford as best-of-19 frames matches.\nRound 2.\nThere were 32 players eliminated in the second round of qualifying. 1986 Champion Joe Johnson was 4–1 ahead of Ricky Walden but then lost a contact lens and, with impaired vision, ended the first session 4–5 behind. He went on to win 10–5.\nRound 3–6.\nThere were 16 players eliminated in each of rounds 3 to 6 of qualifying. Johnson experienced problems with his vision, as he had in the previous round, and retired from his third round match against Ryan Day when 1–5 behind. The final qualifying round saw John Parrott progress to the Crucible stage for the 19th consecutive year; six-times former champion Steve Davis failed to reach the Crucible for only the second time in 24 seasons. Murphy, ranked 169th and aged 19, was both the lowest-ranked and youngest player to reach the final stages in 2002.\nCentury breaks.\nThere were 68 century breaks in the main stages of the event, which was at the time a record total. It was equalled in 2007 and superseded in 2009. The highest break of the tournament was 145, made by Matthew Stevens during his quarter-final match against Higgins. Hendry's 16 century breaks made during the tournament bettered the previous record total of 14 set by John Higgins in 1998."

The Los Angeles Lakers team features Magic Johnson despite his not actually playing in the NBA during that season (he had announced his retirement early in the season, having never played a game in the 1991–92 season). Larry Bird, who played his last NBA game in 1992, also appears, as a member of the Boston Celtics.\nSequel.\nTecmo had received the NBA license again in 2009, and thereafter made NBA Unrivaled.

Players can play either exhibition, regular season, all-star, or playoff games. It was one of the first video games to feature individual hitting abilities for each pitcher.\nThe most valuable (hitting) player in the game is Howard Johnson of the New York Mets.

Bleacher Report rated Sports Talk Baseball as the twelfth best baseball video game of all time and referred to it as a \"gem.\"\nOther information.\nLive play-by-play commentary.\n\"Sports Talk Baseball\" featured Sega's sports talk speech synthesis for running commentary of each in-game play. It was their second game to feature this technology (\"\" being the first). In order to produce the running commentary, Sega contracted sports announcer Lon Simmons as well as the vocal reproduction company Electronic Speech Systems to record the unique phrases and play calls for the game. Being that several simple phrases had already been recorded in the previous game, much of \"Joe Montana II: Sports Talk Football's\" running commentary was reused for \"Sports Talk Baseball\".\nJapanese version.\nInstead of a running commentary, Super League '91 uses a constant soundtrack of Japanese drums during the game and a remix of the umpire voices to a techno tune at the main menu. There is no way to see any advanced statistics other than at the end of the game in the Japanese version (i.e., errors and hits). All the players are shown using hiragana with English letters being used only to show field position and the status of the player.\nSonic the Hedgehog cameo.\nIf the ball is hit far enough, a black-and-white picture of Sonic the Hedgehog appears on a billboard with his name below it can be seen."

        "text": "Robert Hue Wallace (born September 17, 1954) is an American former college football coach and athletics administrator. He served as head football coach at the University of North Alabama at 1988 to 1997 and again from 2012 to 2016, at Temple University from 1998 to 2005, and at the University of West Alabama from 2006 to 2010. Wallace led the North Alabama Lions to three consecutive NCAA Division II Football Championships, from 1993 to 1995. He was also the athletic director at West Alabama from 2018 to 2021.\nPlaying career.\nWallace was a multi-sport athlete at Callaway High School in Jackson, Mississippi, lettering three years each in football, basketball, baseball, and track. He also earned prep All-America honors before enrolling at Mississippi State University. After starting for three seasons as a defensive back at MSU under Bob Tyler, Wallace earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Physical Education in 1976 and stayed the following year to serve the Bulldogs as a graduate assistant coach.\nCoaching career.\nAssistant coaching career.\nWallace started his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Mississippi State University in 1976. The following season, he joined Hall of Fame coach Pat Dye's staff at East Carolina to coach defensive backs. He followed Dye to Wyoming and Auburn, before returning to his alma-mater Mississippi State as defensive coordinator. During his tenure at Auburn, Wallace was noted for recruiting standout running back Bo Jackson. In 1987, he coached defensive backs at Illinois.\nNorth Alabama.\nBobby Wallace's career as a head coach began in 1988 when he was named head coach at the University of North Alabama (UNA) in Florence, Alabama. He compiled a record of 82–36–1 in 10 seasons (1988–1997) at UNA, leading the Lions to three consecutive Division II national championships in 1993, 1994 and 1995. During those three seasons, the Lions recorded an overall record of 41–1, losing only to the eventual Division I-AA national champion Youngstown State in 1994. The 1995 UNA team was named the \"Best Team of the Quarter Century\" in Division II.\nWallace's UNA teams also won three consecutive Gulf South Conference championships (1993–1995), qualified for the Division II playoffs six times, and sent 12 players to the National Football League (NFL). In 1995, Lions linebacker Ronald McKinnon became the first and, as of 2016, only defensive player to win the Division II Harlon Hill Trophy. He resigned at UNA following the 1997 season to become the head coach at Temple University.\nTemple.\nWallace became the 23rd head coach at Temple University on December 7, 1997. He coached the Owls for eight seasons, compiling a record of 19–71. Although his first team at Temple finished 2–9, one of the wins became arguably one of the biggest upsets in college football history. On October 17, 1998, the 0–6 Owls traveled to Blacksburg, Virginia to play the Virginia Tech Hokies. The Owls overcame a 17–0 deficit and numerous injuries to upset the Hokies, 28–24. The win gave the Owls their first ever Big East road win, and their first win over a ranked opponent in 11 years. Two weeks later, the Owls won again in improbable fashion, this time overcoming a 20–0 deficit to defeat Pittsburgh.\nAlthough his teams were consistently good defensively, none of Wallace's eight Temple teams had winning records. The Owls were winless during his final season in 2005, and played as an NCAA Division I-A independent after losing their Big East affiliation. During his tenure at Temple, Wallace had 12 players selected All-Big East. He coached All-Americans Dan Klecko and Rian Wallace.\nWest Alabama.\nWallace was hired to be the head coach at West Alabama in March 2006. Wallace's first UWA team went 6-5, achieving the program's first winning season since 1992. In 2009 West Alabama went 8-5 and made the NCAA Division II playoffs for the first time since 1975. In 2010, he led the Tigers to a 7-4 record posting back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 1991-92. Wallace retired from UWA following the 2010 season. \nReturn to North Alabama.\nOn January 2, 2012, the University of North Alabama announced that Wallace would return as the Lions' ninth head football coach following the departure of Terry Bowden. On September 26, 2015, Wallace coached North Alabama to a school-record tying 109th career win over Florida Tech. On October 3, Wallace became the winningest head coach in program history notching his 110th win with a 34–12 victory over Valdosta State. In 2016 Wallace led the Lions to their fourth straight Gulf South Conference championship. It was the first time the feat had been accomplished in conference history. The Lions went on to play for the NCAA Division 2 National Championship where they were defeated by Northwest Missouri State Wallace retired following the 2016 season finishing his career with a 126–51–1 record at UNA and 171–152–1 overall."

He is a member of the YSU Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nOriginally signed by the Philadelphia Phillies on June 13, 1964, Allen began his professional career with the Miami Marlins of the Florida State League. He led the Carolina League with 100 RBI while playing for the Tidewater Tides in 1967. Prior to the 1970 season, he was traded to the New York Mets for a player to be named later. He was acquired by the Cardinals before the 1972 season.\nMajor leagues.\nAllen's major league career was very short as he played in just seven games in 1972 for the St. Louis Cardinals. He made his major league debut on August 11, 1972, and his final appearance on August 21, 1972. In five games at first base, Allen handled 30 out of 31 chances successfully for a .968 fielding percentage.\nAllen's best day as a major leaguer was on August 17, 1972 at San Diego Stadium, due in part to teammate Joe Torre. Torre was ejected from the game in the bottom of the eighth inning, and Allen came in as his replacement at first base. The next inning, he got his only major league hit, a home run against San Diego Padres right-hander Mike Corkins.\nLater life and legacy.\nAllen received his B.S. in General Studies on August 14, 2010 from Youngstown State University. He graduated 46 years and 195 days after scoring his last point for the Penguins, fulfilling a promise made to his mother to earn his college degree.\nAs of October 2006, with 358 home runs among them, the Allen brothers ranked # 11 in MLB brother combination home runs (out of more than 350 combinations all-time). Allen has also been inducted to the Reading Phillies Hall of Fame."

        "text": "Gregory Blakemoor Norton (born July 6, 1972) is an American former professional baseball corner infielder. He spent 13 years in Major League Baseball (MLB) with six teams from 1996 through 2009. Since his retirement as a player, he has worked in the minor league system of the Florida Marlins, served as a coach for Auburn University, and was the minor league hitting coordinator for the Boston Red Sox.\nEarly life.\nBorn in San Leandro, California, Norton attended the University of Oklahoma. In 1992, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star. Norton's father Jerry was arrested and later convicted of murder after the 1989 strangulation death of his wife. Jerry Norton was later sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.\nProfessional career.\nChicago White Sox.\nNorton made his major league debut on August 18, for the Chicago White Sox, entering the game against the Milwaukee Brewers in the eighth inning as a pinch-runner for designated hitter Harold Baines. He would score his first run three batters later on a two-out RBI single by left fielder Tony Phillips. Norton would get his first major league base hit the very next night against the Detroit Tigers, when he singled against reliever José Lima as a pinch-hitter. His most productive year in Chicago came in , when he hit .255 while recording 50 RBI and hitting 16 homers despite splitting playing time at first base with 3 other players (including slugger Frank Thomas).\nColorado Rockies.\nPlaying for the Colorado Rockies from the season until , Norton compiled a .252 batting average in 344 games played. Norton played four positions for the Rockies his first year with the team, including starting at first base for All-Star Todd Helton for the only five games Helton rested that year. In his final year with the Rockies, Norton led the majors in successful pinch hits and pinch-hit RBI. However, he was granted free agency at the end of the 2003 season.\nDetroit Tigers.\n was a forgettable year for Norton, as he split time with the Detroit Tigers and their minor-league team in Toledo. Tigers first baseman Carlos Peña led the team in home runs that year, leaving very little room for Norton. A knee inflammation also kept him on the disabled list for over a month. \nTampa Bay Devil Rays.\nOn January 11, , Norton signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He was brought up to the majors on April 26 when Jorge Cantú was placed on the disabled list. In Norton's first year as a D-Ray, he bested his season home run total (17) and started a career high 26 games in right field. He missed making the Opening Day roster while going under the knife to surgically repair his right knee. On Mother's Day, May 14, 2006, Norton was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn February 13, , Norton signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Seattle Mariners. He was purchased from the minors and added to the active roster on April 11, when Charlton Jimerson was designated for assignment. On April 30, Norton was designated for assignment despite batting .438 in 16 at-bats. \nAtlanta Braves.\nOn May 5, Norton was traded to the Atlanta Braves for cash considerations. In 2008, Norton led the major leagues in pinch hit home runs, with three. On December 19, 2008, Norton signed a one-year contract worth $800,000 to return to the Braves. In 2009, he collected only 11 hits in 76 at-bats with Atlanta.\nCoaching career.\nNorton began a coaching career within the Florida Marlins farm system in 2010, acting as hitting coach and then manager of the New Orleans Zephyrs. In July 2013, he was named hitting coach for the Auburn Tigers baseball program. Norton left his position in the Marlins organization to join coach Sunny Golloway at Auburn. In January 2016, Norton was hired by the Boston Red Sox to be the team's minor league hitting coordinator. The Red Sox declined to renew Norton's contract after the 2021 season.\nExternal links.\n, or Pura Pelota website"

It is published eight months per year, and operates a website, Tennis.com.\nHistory.\nThe magazine was established in May 1965, published out of Chicago with a regional focus. Asher Birnbaum of Skokie, IL was the founder, editor and publisher. The tennis boom of the 1970s resulted in a rapid expansion of the magazine, both in scope and circulation. In addition to top tennis stars, celebrities like Johnny Carson and Farrah Fawcett appeared on the cover. It was owned by Golf Digest / Tennis Magazine and sold to the New York Times Company.\nMiller Publishing bought the magazine in 1997 from The New York Times Company. It brought on two retired champions as part owners and contributors: first Chris Evert in 2000 then Pete Sampras in 2003.

        "text": " \nThe women's Rugby World Cup is the women's rugby union world championship which is organised by World Rugby. The first Rugby World Cup for women was held in 1991, but it was not until the 1998 tournament that the tournament received official backing from the International Rugby Board (IRB, now World Rugby); by 2009, the IRB had retroactively recognized the 1991 and 1994 tournaments and their champions. \nNormally, the tournament is held every four years; it was moved forward in 2017 so that the competition could be held in the year before the Commonwealth Games. The 2021 tournament was postponed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but still marketed as the 2021 Rugby World Cup.\nThree countries have won the women's Rugby World Cup since its establishment, with New Zealand having won the tournament a record six times.\nThe championship was previously branded as the Women's Rugby World Cup. As part of an effort to promote greater parity between the championship and its men's counterpart, the Rugby World Cup, World Rugby announced in 2019 that the women's championship would be marketed as the Rugby World Cup with no gender designation beginning in 2021.\nHistory.\n1990s.\nBefore the first Women's Rugby World Cup officially sanctioned by the International Rugby Board there had been three previous tournaments of a similar nature. The first of these was an event held in August 1990 in New Zealand. Though not considered a world cup, the tournament was referred to as the World Rugby Festival for Women. The competition included teams representing the United States, the Netherlands, Russia, and the hosts, New Zealand – who emerged as winners after defeating the United States in the final.\nThe first tournament referred to as the Women's Rugby World Cup was held in 1991 and hosted by Wales. Twelve countries were divided into four groups of three. The United States, against expectations, took the first championship with a 19–6 victory over England. In the Plate competition Canada prevailed over Spain 18–4. Following the first tournament, it was decided to move the tournament schedule to the year prior to the next men's world cup, therefore reducing the quadrennial cycle to just three years.\nThe next event was originally scheduled to take place in Amsterdam but ended up being moved to Scotland. Eleven countries competed in the tournament with the English meeting the United States in the final for the second time; however, in this instance England emerged as winners.\nThe 1998 tournament became the first women's world cup officially sanctioned by the International Rugby Board. Amsterdam, who were originally scheduled to host the previous world cup, hosted the largest ever tournament with all matches played at the new National Rugby Centre in the city's west end. The tournament also saw a record sixteen teams compete. New Zealand, who withdrew from the previous tournament, also competed. The final saw New Zealand defeat the United States and claim their first world cup title.\n2000–present.\nThe next event was taken to Spain in 2002. New Zealand won the title for the second time by defeating England 19–9 in the final.\nThe 2006 World Cup took place in Edmonton, Canada, and was the first major international rugby union tournament and women's world cup held in North America. New Zealand defeated England in the final to win their third successive world cup title.\nA record four countries expressed interest in hosting the 2010 World Cup. After considering bids from England, Germany, Kazakhstan and South Africa, the IRB announced that the 2010 event would take place in England. The tournament was staged in London, with the final played at the Twickenham Stoop.\nThe 2017 World Cup was hosted by the Irish Rugby Football Union, which governs the sport on an All-Ireland basis. Games were held in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland and in Belfast in Northern Ireland. The tournament was held one year earlier than usual in order to re-align the Women's Rugby World Cup's scheduling for greater synergy with the Summer Olympics (which added rugby sevens in 2016) one year prior, and Rugby World Cup Sevens held the following year. The tournament was to return to a four-year cycle afterward, with the 2021 Women's Rugby World Cup awarded to New Zealand. \nIn August 2019, World Rugby announced that in an effort to \"elevate the profile of the women's game\", the women's championship will be marketed under the \"Rugby World Cup\" branding, with no gender designation, beginning in 2021. World Rugby stated that the decision was intended to promote gender equality and \"[eliminate] any inherent or perceived bias\" towards men's events, with chairman Bill Beaumont explaining that it \"demonstrates our ongoing and unwavering commitment to advancing women in rugby both on and off the field in line with our ambitious strategic plan.\" World Rugby became the first major sports federation to rebrand its events in such a way.\nThe 2021 tournament in New Zealand was postponed by one year to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it will still be branded as the 2021 Rugby World Cup.\nFrom 2025 the competition finals will be expanded to 16 teams, from the 12 competing in 2021. On 12 May 2022, World Rugby announced that England, Australia and the United States would host the next three women's tournaments in 2025, 2029, and 2033 respectively. As part of a new strategy, Australia and the United States were also awarded the preceding men's tournaments in 2027 and 2031 respectively—marking the first time that the men's and women's Rugby World Cup will be held successively in the same host nation.\nResults.\nParticipating nations.\nQ = nation qualified for Final Tournament not yet played\nw = nation withdrew from (final) Tournament\ne = nation eliminated in qualifying stage and did not reach Final Tournament\n– = nation did not enter competition.\nThe following nations have participated in qualifying stages, but have never reached the Final Tournament:\ne = nation eliminated in qualifying stage and did not reach Final Tournament\nw = nation withdrew from qualifying stage\np = nation possibly eliminated in qualifying stage and will need to be successful in Repechage in order to reach Final Tournament\n– = nation did not enter qualifying stage competition.\nApart from the African region, the nations involved in the continental qualifying stages have not been announced as at 20 October 2019.\nFormat.\nThe format for the 2006 tournament split the 12 participating nations into four pools of three teams. Each nation played three games, after the completion of which a re-seeding process took place. Nations were moved into divisions dictated by their respective overall tournament ranking with the top teams proceeding to the knockout stages.\nThe 2010 event maintained the number of teams participating at twelve, with regional qualifying tournaments. The 2021 tournament retained the same format, but with the classification round replaced with quarter-finals, as with the men's Rugby World Cup. In 2025, the tournament will expand to 16 teams.\nMedia coverage.\nThe tournament has grown considerably in the past fifteen years although television audiences and event attendance still remain relatively low, especially in comparison to other women's world cup events. The final of the 2006 event in Canada was broadcast in a number of countries and streamed live via the internet.\nSky Sports broadcast 13 live matches from the 2010 Women's Rugby World Cup, including the semi-finals, the third and fourth place play-off match and the final. The pool matches shown included all of England's matches, while each of the home nations' featured live too. There were also highlights shown from all other matches during the pool stages.\nIn Ireland the Women's Rugby World Cup was broadcast by TG4 in 2014, the Irish language channel received praise for airing the tournament. TG4 provided coverage to all of the Irish matches as well as the final and semi-final.\nCertain matches in the 2017 WRWC knockout phases drew strong TV viewership in England and France, and were broadcast live in the United States.\nIn 2017, ITV started televising Women's Rugby Union World Cup matches on free-to-air TV for the first time in history, starting with the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup in Ireland."

        "title": "Winter swimming",
        "text": "Winter swimming is the activity of swimming during the winter season, typically in outdoor locations (open water swimming) or in unheated pools or lidos. In colder countries, it may be synonymous with ice swimming, when the water is frozen over. This requires either breaking the ice or entering where a spring prevents the formation of ice. It may also be simulated by a pool of water at , the temperature at which water freezes.\nIn Nordic countries of Europe as well in Eastern Europe (e.g. Ukraine, Russia, and Baltic countries), winter swimming is a traditional cultural element and part of religious celebrations like the Epiphany in Eastern Orthodoxy.\nCompetitions for winter swimming also exist. Many winter swimmers swim with standard swimsuits rather than with wetsuits or other thermal protection. Famous ice and winter swimmers include Lynne Cox and Lewis Gordon Pugh.\nAlso, many locations in North America and Europe hold polar bear plunges, commonly to celebrate New Year's Day, although participants are not expected to swim and generally most do not swim.\nInternational winter and ice swimming competitions take place around the world with two of the larger organizing bodies being the International Ice Swimming Association and the International Winter Swimming Association. Both organizations have similar competition guidelines including water temperatures typically below , a pool often cut out of frozen bodies of water, and swimmers limited to goggles, one standard bathing suit, and one latex or silicone cap - neoprene is not allowed.\nMaintaining the hole in the ice.\nOne way that the hole is maintained at regular ice swimming places is with a pump that forces the water to circulate under the hole, preventing ice from forming. Small ice-holes can also be kept open by keeping a lid/top over the hole to prevent ice forming.\nMost ice swimming places also use a specific heated \"carpet\" going from the locker rooms to the ice-hole, both to make walking to the hole more pleasant and for safety as otherwise the water dripping from returning swimmers would freeze and create a dangerously slippery surface to walk on.\nNational traditions.\nNorthern Europe.\nIn Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Russia and Sweden the ice swimming tradition has been connected with the sauna and Banya traditions. Unlike dousing, it is not seen as an ascetic or religious ritual, but a way to cool off rapidly after staying in a sauna and as a stress relief.\nIce swimming (\"avantouinti\") on its own is especially popular in Estonia and Finland. There is an Avantouinti Society, and swimming holes are also maintained by other groups such as the Finnish skiing association (Suomen Latu). The Finnish Sauna Society maintains an avanto for sauna goers.\nThere are many places to swim without sauna in Finland during winter. Helsinki has several places for avantouinti, with dressing rooms and sometimes with saunas. There is also a number of ice swimming and winter sauna locations around Tampere.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nIn New South Wales, the Bronte Splashers Winter Swimming Club claims to be the oldest Winter Swimming club in the world founded in 1921. It competes against Bondi Icebergs Winter Swimming Club, South Maroubra Dolphins Winter Swimming Club, Cronulla Polar Bears Winter Swimming Club, Maroubra Seals Winter Swimming Club, Coolangatta Surf Life Saving Club, Clovelly Eskimos Winter Swimming Club, Coogee Penguins Winter Swimming Club, Wollongong Whales and Cottesloe Crabs in the Winter Swimming Association of Australia Championships.\nIn Victoria, the Brighton Icebergers and the Shrinkäge swim group swim in Port Phillip Bay, the latter at Elwood Beach in Elwood\nWestern Europe.\nUnited Kingdom.\nFamous locations include the Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park, London, and Highgate Ponds in Hampstead. The largest fresh water pool in the UK is the Tooting Bec Lido in South West London which is home to the South London Swimming Club. The pool is in length, i.e. nearly twice as long as an Olympic pool. As the winter approaches and the water temperature drops then swimmers stay in for less and less time, swimming just one or two widths rather than several lengths. Races take place all year including on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.\nThe Middle Yeo Surf Life Saving Club hold the annual New Year's Day swim in Clevedon. It is usually held 20 minutes before high tide or if the times are not conducive to a large crowd the swim is held in Marine Lake. The Middle Yeo Surf Life Saving Club swim every weekend of the year and the forthcoming swim times are published in their alcove in Top Beach, Clevedon.\nThe Chester Frosties are an informal Facebook group of over 1,000 swimmers who swim all year around Cheshire, Lancashire, Wirral, Merseyside and North Wales. Local specialities include tidal bore and surge swimming on the River Dee.\nSheffield Outdoor Plungers are another informal Facebook group of 3,000 swimmers who swim in locations all over the Peak District and Sheffield area, and campaign for better access to waters.\nBelgium.\nThere are some clubs where people swim all year in a pool, a lake, or a river. Locations are Bruges, Boom, Deurne Dendermonde, Wachtebeek, Theux and Huy. The most famous race is across the Meuse each last Sunday of February since 1963.\nGermany.\nThe International Ice Swimming Association hosts an official ice swimming event at the Wöhrsee, a lake in Burghausen.\nSwitzerland.\nIn Geneva the yearly Coupe de Noël is an event organized in December since 1934. Around 2,500 participants, many of them dressed up, swim in Lake Geneva.\nThe Netherlands\nIn Scheveningen there is a yearly event known as the \"\" or New year's dive in English. In which people swim in the freezing North sea. Participants range in the thousands.\nCentral Europe.\nPoland.\nThe history of winter swimming (\"pływanie w zimie\", also \"morsowanie\", a loanword from Eastern European languages) in Poland dates back to at least 16th century, when Wojciech Oczko, the physician to the Kings Stephen Báthory and Sigismund III Vasa, published a treatise \"Cieplice\", which contained the information on the contemporary understanding of water-based therapies, including the indications and contraindications to swimming in cold temperatures.\nThe oldest registered association for winter swimming enthusiasts, the \"Gdański Klub Morsów\", was founded in 1975.\nEastern Europe and Russia.\nIn Russia ice swimming may have been practiced since pagan times. During the times of Moscovian Russia swimming in ice holes was a popular tradition. Records are dating the tradition back to as early as 1525. It was also an important court ceremony and a folk custom in Tsardom of Russia.\nIn Russia and other Eastern European countries where Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the prevalent religion ice swimming is connected with the celebration of the Epiphany. The Epiphany is observed on 19 January according to the Julian calendar of the Russian Orthodox Church. The day marks the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan. To celebrate this, holes are cut in the ice on rivers, lakes or other bodies of water, usually in the form of a Christian or Orthodox cross. Around midnight, believers submerge themselves three times in the water to honour the Holy Trinity, after a priest says a prayer.\nIce swimming on the Epiphany is relatively new. It was practised by only a few before the October Revolution of 1917 and occurred even less frequently in the time of the Soviet Union, when Christians were persecuted. However, the ritual became very popular in the 1990s since the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. In Moscow alone, 30,000 believers swam in ice holes in 37 fonts during the Epiphany of 2010. There is a popular belief that the practice erases a person's sins, but this is not endorsed by the Russian Orthodox Church. On the holiday in January 2020, 2 million people practised ice swimming in Russia for the baptism of Jesus.\nIce swimming is also practised during the entire winter by Walrus Clubs, whose members are called \"walruses\" (, \"morzhi\"). In other Eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, the Epiphany is celebrated on 6 January. There it is tradition for Orthodox priests to cast wooden crosses in the water, which are then retrieved by the believers. It is popularly believed that the person who finds the cross is freed from evil spirits. Other countries where this is done include Serbia and Montenegro.\nNorth America.\nThe members of Canadian and American \"polar bear clubs\" go outdoor bathing or swimming in the middle of winter. In some areas, it is unusual or ceremonial enough to attract press coverage. \"Polar bear plunges\" are conducted as fund-raisers for charity, notably the Special Olympics, however these events do not actually involve swimming, but rather running into the water and back out again. Cosmo Kramer briefly joins a New York polar bears club in the sitcom \"Seinfeld\".\nThe Russian immigrant professor Louis Sugarman of Little Falls, NY was the first American to become a famous ice swimmer in the 1890s. He attracted worldwide attention for his daily plunge in the Mohawk River, even when the thermometer hit , earning him the nickname \"the human polar bear\". \nThe oldest ice swimming club in the United States is the Coney Island Polar Bear Club of Coney Island, New York, founded in 1903 by Bernarr MacFadden. The club organizes an annual polar plunge on New Year's Day as well as regular swims in the Atlantic Ocean every Sunday from November to April.\nAsia.\nChina.\nThere are reportedly 141 winter swimming organisations across China with a membership of more than 200,000. The younger swimmers are under ten years of age and the older ones in their 80s. In Beijing, there are the winter swimming places such as Shichahai (什刹海), Yu Yuantan (玉渊潭) and Xihu swimming pool in Qinghua University, etc.\nIn Harbin, northern China, many ice swim in the Songhua River. Also Jinan is a place of annual winter swimming festival. The big event is swimming across Daming Lake about . In Taiyuan, where air temperature often goes below in winter, hundreds of men and women ice swim each day in the Fen River.\nIn Dalian, a coastal city in northeast China, hundreds of people swim in the sea in winter. Most people choose to go to the beach at noon. Some of them are concentrated in several beaches in the city, such as Fujiazhuang beach, Xinghai Square beach and Shicao beach. At Bangchuidao Island beach, there are also some swimmers who choose to go swimming in the sea before sunrise.\nJinan is also the site of annual Chinese national winter swimming festivals since 2014, as an international invitational festival (in 2019 attended by approx. 990 winter swimmers from 12 countries, still according Chinese rules) since 2016, and, from season 2019/2020, as the International Winter Swimming Association (IWSA) 3rd stage of World Cup already according to IWSA international rules. Besides competitions in swimming pool created in lake the main event and longest discipline of competitions is swimming 300 m (980 ft) from Huxin Island to the venue of the World Cup.\nJapan.\nIt is held on beaches and rivers, as a Shinto ritual, winter exercises, or as a local traditional event.\nThe one held on the Hojo Coast in Tateyama was originally held as a high school winter exercise, and has extend into a local event. Local junior high and high school students and men and women of all ages participate in this event.\nSagami River in Sagamihara and Senbonhama Beach in Numazu are also well known.\nHealth risks.\nWinter swimming can be dangerous to people who are not used to swimming in very cold water. After immersion in cold water the cold shock response will occur, causing an uncontrollable gasp for air. This is followed by hyperventilation, a longer period of more rapid breathing. The gasp for air can cause a person to ingest water, which leads to drowning. As blood in the limbs is cooled and returns to the heart, this can cause fibrillation and consequently cardiac arrest. The cold shock response and cardiac arrest are the most common causes of death related to cold water immersion.\nWinter swimming is not dangerous for healthy persons, but should be avoided by individuals with heart or respiratory diseases, high blood pressure and arrhythmia, as well as children and the elderly. Through conditioning, experienced winter swimmers have a greater resistance to effects of the cold shock response.\nHypothermia poses a smaller risk. According to Tucker and Dugas, it takes more than approximately 30 minutes even in water until the body temperature drops low enough for hypothermia to occur. Many people would probably be able to survive for almost an hour. There is no consensus on these figures however; according to different estimates a person can survive for 45 minutes in water, but exhaustion or unconsciousness is expected to occur within 15 minutes. Consuming alcohol before winter swimming should be avoided because it speeds the onset and progression of hypothermia.\nCare should be taken when winter swimming in swimming pools and seas near the polar regions. The chlorine added to water in swimming pools and the salt in seawater allow the water to remain liquid at sub-zero temperatures. Swimming in such water is significantly more challenging and dangerous. The experienced winter swimmer Lewis Gordon Pugh swam near the North Pole in water and suffered a frostbite injury in his fingers. It took him four months to regain sensation in his hands.\nHealth benefits.\nAlthough there are risks associated with the practice, scientific studies also provide some evidence for the following health benefits.\nWhen compared to a control group on the profile of mood states rating scale, winter swimmers experience less stress and fatigue and more vigor. They report to have a better memory function, better mood and feel more energetic, active and brisk. Swimmers who suffer from rheumatism, fibromyalgia or asthma report that winter swimming relieves pain.\nThere are indications that winter swimmers do not contract diseases as often as the general population. The incidence of infectious diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract is 40% lower among winter swimmers when compared to a control group. Short term exposure of the whole body to cold water produces oxidative stress, which makes winter swimmers develop improved antioxidative protection."

        "text": "Mike Archer (born July 26, 1953) is an American football coach and former player. From 1987 to 1990, Archer was the head football coach at Louisiana State University, where he compiled a record of 27–18–1. Archer has also served as an assistant coach at his alma mater University of Miami, the University of Virginia, and the University of Kentucky, the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL), and with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL).\nCoaching career.\nArcher came to Louisiana State University as an assistant coach in 1984 after being both a player and an assistant coach at the University of Miami. He replaced Bill Arnsparger as the LSU Tigers football head coach in 1987 when Arnsparger left to become the athletic director at the University of Florida. Archer was Arnsparger's defensive coordinator in 1985 and 1986, and was Arnsparger's hand-picked successor. When Archer took the LSU head coaching job, he was 34 years old, the youngest head coach in Division I-A football. Archer was chosen over a number of interviewed candidates, which reportedly included Steve Spurrier, Mike Shanahan, and Mack Brown. Arnsparger later hired Spurrier at head football coach at Florida.\nIn 1987, LSU finished the season ranked No. 5 in both major polls with a 10–1–1 record, blemished only by a tie against Ohio State and a loss to Alabama. The latter was all that kept the Tigers out of the 1988 Sugar Bowl; Auburn went instead. It was LSU's first 10-win season in more than 25 years. Archer's Tigers followed up with an 8–4 record and a share of the Southeastern Conference title in 1988. The 1988 season was famous for the \"Earthquake Game,\" a 7–6 victory over Auburn. While LSU and Auburn shared the conference title as a result, Auburn got the SEC's berth in the Sugar Bowl due to a higher poll ranking, and LSU lost in the Hall of Fame Bowl.\nAfter back-to-back losing seasons in 1989 and 1990, Archer was forced to resign. He lost four of his last five games in 1990, the lone win coming in the season finale against Tulane. Archer was replaced by Curley Hallman, previously the head coach at the University of Southern Mississippi.\nAfter leaving LSU, Archer remained in coaching, but strictly as a defensive assistant. In 1991, he became linebackers coach at Virginia. In 1993, he moved on to coach linebackers at Kentucky and was named assistant head coach there in 1995. Archer jumped to the NFL in 1996, where he served as linebackers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers for seven years. He returned to Kentucky as defensive coordinator in 2003. Archer resigned from his position at Kentucky on January 10, 2007, to accept the same job at NC State, where he was reunited with Tom O'Brien. Archer and O'Brien worked together at Virginia from 1991 to 1992. In 2014, Archer rejoined the staff at Virginia, where O'Brien was the associate head coach.\nIn May 2017, he became linebacker coach with the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL. He was promoted to defensive coordinator for the 2018 season. \nIn 2019, Archer joined former Argonauts head coach Marc Trestman at the Tampa Bay Vipers of the XFL."

He played baseball for the Louisville Cardinals from to . He was drafted in the 12th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft by the Colorado Rockies after his junior season at Louisville.\nAfter spending his first professional season with the Portland Rockies of the Northwest League, the right-hander moved up the organizational ladder, pitching for the Asheville Tourists in the South Atlantic League in , Salem in the Carolina League in , and California League's Visalia Oaks before jumping to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers in where he was 4–3 with a 3.03 ERA.\nIn an off-season trade, the Seattle Mariners acquired Green from the Rockies for pitcher Aaron Taylor, and Green flourished in the Mariners farm system, logging a Texas League-high 14 saves and posting a 2.96 ERA for the San Antonio Missions in before being promoted to the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers.\nHe completed the 2005 season in Tacoma and pitched in seven spring training games with the big league squad in Arizona before opening back in Tacoma. His spring training performance and 4–0 record and 1.38 ERA as the Rainiers' closer caught the eye of Mariners manager Mike Hargrove.\nGreen made it to the big leagues when the Seattle Mariners called him up on April 29, 2006, to replace reliever Julio Mateo. When Mateo was activated on May 20, it was thought that Green would return to Triple-A Tacoma, but the Mariners opted to instead send down pitcher Emiliano Fruto. He made his first Major League appearance on May 2 against the Minnesota Twins.\nGreen was a solid contributor out of the bullpen in 2007, logging 68 innings out of the bullpen with a 3.84 ERA in 64 games for the Mariners.\nIn , Green dominated before the All-Star break, with a 2.72 ERA, but after the All-Star break, Green had an 8.65 ERA. He would finish the season with a 4.67 ERA in a career high 79 innings.\nNew York Mets.\nOn December 10, 2008, Green was sent to the New York Mets as a part of a 12-player, 3-team trade that sent reliever J.J. Putz to New York.\nDespite hype for Green, he struggled in his first year and was eventually demoted to the Mets minor league, AAA affiliate. He would eventually make it back and provided the Mets with 79 relief appearances despite having an ERA of 4.52.\nIn early April 2010, Green was given the final bullpen spot but he was put on the DL with a broken rib. It was reported that Green has recovered from the injury but was still rehabilitating in the minors. Green returned to the Mets on September 6, 2010, as part of the Mets September callups.\nOn December 3, 2010, the Mets non-tendered Green, making him a free agent.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn December 22, 2010, Green signed a non-guaranteed one-year contract worth $875,000 with the Milwaukee Brewers. He was designated for assignment on May 17, 2011.\nTexas Rangers.\nGreen signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers on January 23, 2012. He also received an invitation to spring training. Green allowed 21 runs in 27.1 innings at the AAA level for the Rangers, he was subsequently released."

        "text": "In the sport of road cycling, a chain gang is a group of cyclists in a close knit formation usually of two parallel lines drafting behind the leader.\nThe formation comes from the fact that it is harder to cycle at the front of a group than in the shelter of another rider. The rider behind enjoys the slipstream of the rider in front. If one rider were to stay at the front all the time, they would tire and the whole group would slow down. If the lead is rotated, the effort is distributed across the group and the speed can be higher or the individual effort less.\nThis effect is very significant - up to a 40% reduction in effort for the slip-streaming riders while the lead rider also benefits from reduced drag (somewhat under 10%) due to the air not closing up after them.\nThe name \"chain gang\" is an allusion to the formation that riders adopt. The rider in the front of the group will take their share of the lead, then swing to the side and let the rest of the line come through, led by a new leader. The first rider then eases up and drops in behind the last rider in the line, staying in their slipstream until once again their turn comes to ride at the front.\nWhen there are enough riders, turns at the front can be so brief that there is a continuous flow up and down, in two lines, so that cyclists take on the role of links in a chain. For that reason: chain gang.\nThe technique is hard to perfect because it demands riders cycle close to the rider in front at speed, sometimes just centimetres from their tyre. It also demands trust in others in the group because, that close, no rider would be able to avoid hitting the one in front if the pace suddenly slowed. For that reason, the leading rider takes responsibility for taking the line through the smoothest path they can and at a constant speed. They should also indicate with hand gestures the upcoming bumps or obstacles on the road by pointing their finger in the corresponding direction the hazard is coming, in a manner that can be seen by the following rider, who is likely staring at their rear wheel. (Pointing their finger down on the left if they are about to closely pass by a pothole on this side, etc.) The following rider can then relay the information to the next and so on, creating a \"chain of information\" so the whole group is safe.\nThe technique is often used in training for races but it can be seen in races themselves, usually when a small group of riders gets ahead of the main field, or in team time-trials, where the chain-gang technique is paramount.\nChain gangs can also be referred to in the US as pace lines and in the UK as bit-and-bit, although this term is not in common use within the British cycling community."

After the NCAA became involved, US Lacrosse shifted its focus to supporting collegiate teams at NCAA schools that did not actually field varsity teams. This has eventually expanded to also include National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics schools, because the NAIA at that time did not recognize lacrosse as a sanctioned sport. \nThese programs were designated the US Lacrosse Men's Division Intercollegiate Associates (MDIA) and US Lacrosse Women's Division Intercollegiate Associates (WDIA). Over time, it was decided that the MDIA had become too complicated for US Lacrosse to administer and on August 24, 2006, the MDIA Board of Directors announced formation of a new organization called the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA) as its replacement. It was agreed that the MDIA would cease to exist, that the new MCLA would run its own national tournament and control its own budget, but still sit on US Lacrosse boards and committees. The WDIA in January 2011 was also reorganized and renamed the Women's Collegiate Lacrosse Associates (WCLA)."

        "title": "Norway men's national ice hockey team",
        "text": "The Norway men's national ice hockey team is the national ice hockey team from Norway that participates at the IIHF World Championships. The team is governed by the Norwegian Ice Hockey Association and is coached by Petter Thoresen.\nHistory.\nThe Norwegian Ice Hockey Association (NIHA) was founded in 1934 and, adopting the international rules and regulations of ice hockey, became a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation in 1935. Poor finances delayed the formation of a national team until 1937, and continued to hamper its development in the years prior to World War II. After missing out on the 1935 World Championships and 1936 Winter Olympics, the NIHF managed to raise enough funds to send a team to London for the 1937 World Championships. The national ice hockey team thus played its first game on 17 February 1937, losing 0–7 to Czechoslovakia, and was eliminated from the competition following a 2–13 loss to Switzerland. Norway also took part in the next tournament in 1938, but was unable to participate in 1939. Results remained meagre throughout the pre-war years; of the nine international fixtures contested between 1937 and 1940, the closest Norway came to winning was 3–4 in the first game against Sweden, on 20 January 1939.\nAfter the war, ice hockey in Norway accelerated as new teams formed and improvements in infrastructure were made. The opening of the Jordal Amfi in Oslo made Norway's facilities state of the art. Results began to improve on the international stage, though not before Norway had endured its worst defeat ever at the hands of Finland in 1947.\nThe period from 1949 to 1953 has been viewed as a \"golden age\" in the history of the national team, beginning with the maiden victory, a 2–0 win over Belgium at the 1949 World Championships. In 1951, the NIHF appointed Canadian Bud McEachern as head coach. McEachern brought a physical style which suited the players of the generation well, and at the 1951 World Championships, Norway defeated the United States and Great Britain to finish fourth overall. Norway's inaugural Olympic tournament, was as host nation of the 1952 Winter Olympics. In 1953, Norway was the first Western nation to play the Soviet Union, overshadowed by the death of Joseph Stalin shortly after the team's arrival in Moscow.\nNorway would continue during the 1950s to challenge the strongest national hockey teams. From the 1960s, the sport became more popular in the nation but national team achievements would decline as mild winters did not result in government support to construct artificial ice rinks to replace what had traditionally been relied on in the past due to weather conditions. NIHA president Tore Johannessen managed Norway at the 1962 Ice Hockey World Championships. After the 1965 World Championships, Norway was no longer allowed to compete at the highest level, and the NIHF resigned itself to competing at the top of Pool B instead. Qualifying for the Winter Olympics was still within reach, however, and Norway managed to do so in both 1964 and 1968.\nNorway would be relegated to Pool C after finishing in last place in Pool B of the 1972 World Championships. The NIHF was forced to revise its objectives; not to return to Pool A, but merely to survive in Pool B. The goal of qualifying for the Winter Olympics remained throughout this period, but after another stint in Pool C in 1975, the ice hockey tournament at the 1976 Winter Olympics went ahead without Norway's participation.\nIn the 1970s, the unwillingness of the government to support the sport with improved training facilities encouraged a growing reluctance among players to represent Norway internationally. This trend was finally reversed under the leadership of Georg Smefjell and Olav Dalsøren from 1978 to 1980. Smefjell and Dalsøren succeeded in reestablishing Norway competing internationally. At the 1979 World Championships, Norway finished fourth in Pool B and qualified for the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. There, the team showed encouraging signs for the future, despite losing heavily against the top tier nations and eventually coming away from the tournament with only a single point.\nThe appointment of Ronald Pettersson as head coach in 1980 heralded an era of Swedish influence on Norway's international ice hockey. For the next nine years, four Swedish coaches in a row took charge of a team that proved to be highly unstable. For Pettersson, the 1981 World Championships were a disappointment. Wins against Yugoslavia and Japan were barely enough to avoid relegation from Pool B. His successor, Arne Strömberg, experienced similar difficulties. At the 1982 World Championships, an otherwise strong performance was blighted by losses against newly promoted China and Austria.\nThe next Swedish import was Hans Westberg in 1982, whose unorthodox methods lead Norway to the 1984 Winter Olympics. Expectations ahead of the Olympic tournament were only partially met, the 3–3 draw against the United States being the most notable result. The following season, while initially promising, ended in catastrophe at the 1985 World Championships as Norway dropped out of Pool B for the third time.\nNorway stabilized itself in the lower half of Pool A in the 1990s, but the team was relegated again in 1997. After a spell with Swedish coach Leif Boork, Roy Johansen was hired in 2001. A new era of slow, but steady, growth began and Norway climbed thirteen places in the IIHF World Ranking during Johansen's reign, from a 21st place in 2004, to an 8th place in 2012. Johansen stepped down as head coach in 2016 and was replaced by Petter Thoresen.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2023 IIHF World Championship.\nHead coach: Tobias Johansson\nAll-time record.\nUpdated as of 22 April 2024.

Now, the ISSA is organized into seven District Associations within ISSA that schedule and administer regattas within their established regions:\nIndividual schools are also responsible for scheduling dual meets and team-racing events.\nAlthough there are over 350 high schools across the United States that field varsity sailing teams, relatively few of these schools own their own boats. Instead, most schools have established partnerships with community sailing organizations, colleges, or yacht clubs in order to gain access to a fleet of boats. Additionally, most high school sailing teams are involved with fundraising.\nMany high school sailors go on to participate in college sailing (governed by the Intercollegiate Sailing Association). Both college varsity teams (such as Yale University) and club teams (such as the Vanderbilt Sailing Club) recruit high school sailors.\nThe ISSA partners with Vanguard Sailboats to help sponsor its national regattas."

Fourteen teams contested the tournament: Australia, England, New Zealand, Samoa, Wales, Fiji, France, Papua New Guinea, Ireland, Scotland, Tonga, Cook Islands, Italy and the United States. The latter two were competing in the Rugby League World Cup for the first time.\nNew Zealand were the defending champions, having defeated Australia in 2008. Australia won the tournament, beating New Zealand 34–2 in the final to lift the trophy for the tenth time.\nIn terms of attendance, exposure and revenue, the 2013 tournament is considered the most successful Rugby League World Cup to date.\nOrganisation.\nBackground.\nThe Rugby League International Federation confirmed this competition as a part of its international program. The RLIF announced a five-year plan to build up to the 2013 World Cup with Four Nations tournaments held in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The competition was part of the UK's \"Golden Decade of Sport\".\n2013 was chosen as the year of the World Cup to avoid a clash with the London Olympics in 2012. After 2013, the Cup will be held on a quadrennial cycle.\nHost selection.\nIn addition to the United Kingdom, Australia announced its intention to bid for the hosting rights, despite hosting the previous World Cup in 2008. The Australian Rugby League had been preparing a rival bid due to the success of the 2008 event but the business plan presented by the Rugby Football League for the UK to be the host was accepted by the RLIF at a meeting in July 2009. The event formed part of what was being dubbed a 'Golden Decade' in British Sport.\nThe UK last hosted the World Cup in 2000, with the event generally being considered unsuccessful.\nThe then Prince of Wales, HRH Prince Charles welcomed representatives of all 14 nations and tournament organisers with a reception at Clarence House.\nQualification.\nThere were two qualifying pools for the remaining two World Cup places; a European and an Atlantic pool, with one side from each to qualify.\nThe European Qualifying group involved Italy, Lebanon, Russia and Serbia while the Atlantic Qualifying group involved Jamaica, South Africa and the USA. In the Atlantic Qualifiers the United States and Jamaica defeated South Africa in the opening rounds leaving the final match between the two to determine who qualified for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup. United States defeated Jamaica to qualify for their first ever Rugby League World Cup.\nTeams.\nThe competition featured fourteen teams, compared to ten in 2008. Originally around twenty teams were to be involved in qualification, but subsequently the total number of teams involved in the tournament was fixed at nineteen. Twelve nations automatically qualified; the ten nations that contested the previous World Cup, Wales as winners of the 2009 European Nations Cup and the Cook Islands as runners up in the 2009 Pacific Cup.\nMatch officials.\nRules and officiating panel: Daniel Anderson, Stuart Cummings and David Waite.\nPre-tournament matches.\nBefore the World Cup it was announced that USA would face France in Toulouse, Scotland would play Papua New Guinea at Featherstone, England would play Italy at Salford, New Zealand would play the Cook Islands in Doncaster and England Knights would play Samoa at Salford.\nVenues.\nThe games were played at various venues in England, Wales, Ireland, and France.\nThe Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was the host stadium for the opening ceremony and a double header featuring hosts England playing Australia and Wales taking on Italy. The decision to play England vs Australia in Cardiff to open the tournament drew criticism from some in the press who believed that the game should have been played in England where a higher attendance could be expected, or at least a full house which would have looked better than the almost half empty Millennium Stadium.\nHeadingley in Leeds, the Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington, the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham and the DW Stadium in Wigan hosted the quarter-finals. Both semi-finals were hosted at Wembley Stadium, with the final held at Old Trafford.\nMatch schedule.\nThe match schedule was announced on 22 March 2012. The Rugby League International Federation announced the kickoff times of the matches, with the opening kickoff to be held on 26 October in Cardiff, at 14:30 local time. The group stage matches will be played at 14:00, 14:30, 16:00, 16:30, 18:00, and 20:00 local time, with knockout stage matches at 13:00, 15:00, and 20:00 local time. The semi-finals will be played at 13:00 and 15:30 local time and the final, on 30 November 2013 at the Old Trafford stadium, at 14:30 local time.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony took place at the Millennium Stadium on 26 October. The ceremony saw 550 dancers perform, 500 amateur and 50 professional, including former players Martin Offiah and Gareth Thomas, both of whom are former Strictly Come Dancing contestants. The ceremony also featured live music and a light show. The ceremony preceded the opening matches of England versus Australia, versus Wales and Italy.\nGroup stage.\nThe draw, undertaken at the launch of the event in Manchester on 30 November 2010, involved four groups\nThe first two groups were made up of four teams whilst the other two groups feature three teams each. The quarter-final round was made up of the first three teams in the first two groups and the winners of each of the smaller groups. Group play involved a round robin in the larger groups, and a round robin in the smaller groups with an additional inter-group game for each team so all teams played three group games.\nKnockout stage.\nThe quarter-finals followed the group stage, with three teams from each of Groups A and B and one team from each of Groups C and D qualifying.\n\"All times listed below are in Greenwich Mean Time (UTC+0) for English and Welsh venues.\"\nAttendances.\nSeven grounds achieved sell-out crowds, with four setting stadium records.

        "title": "Oar (sport rowing)",
        "text": "In rowing, oars are used to propel the boat. Oars differ from paddles in that they use a fixed or sliding fulcrum, an oarlock or rowlock attached to the side of the boat, to transfer power from the handle to the blade, rather than using the athlete's shoulders or hands as the pivot-point as in canoeing and kayaking.\nWhen the rower uses one oar on one side, it is called \"sweep\" rowing that the single oar is called a \"sweep\" oar. When the rower uses two oars at the same time, one on each side, it is called sculling, and the two oars are called a pair of \"sculls\". Typical sculls are around 284 cm - 290 cm in length — sweep oars are 370 cm - 376 cm. A scull has a smaller blade area, as each rower wields a pair of them at any one time, operating each with one hand. Since the 1980s many oars have been adjustable in length.\nThe shaft of the oar ends with a thin flat surface 40 to 50 cm long and 25 cm wide, variously called the blade or spoon. Further along are the loom (or shaft), of the way up which is the sleeve (including a wearplate) and button (or collar), and at the very end the handle. The handle may revert to wooden or, particularly in the case of sculls and some 21st century models of sweep-oar blades have rubber, cellular foam, suede or for example wood veneer grips over glass fiber.\nThe part of the oar the rower holds while rowing is the handle which is longer for sweep blades as each is held using both hands, than for sculls which are held with one hand.\nThere are hundreds of different variations of oars in terms of size and manufacturer specifications. \"Macon\" or \"Cleaver\" blade shapes of carbon-fibre are the most common in modern-day rowing. Classic oars were made out of wood. Since the use of such synthetic materials, first mass-produced by the Dreissigacker brothers in 1975, the weight of an oar has come down from over 7 kg to less than 2.5 kg and 1.275-1.8 kg in the case of sculls. While rowing in the most common competitive boats, fine boats (racing shells), oars are since the early part of the 20th century supported by metal, fibreglass or carbon fibre frames attached to the side of the boat called riggers for extra leverage.\nBlade shapes.\nCleaver.\nThe most common shape now seen is the \"cleaver\" (also called \"hatchet\"), which is used almost universally. Cleaver blades are asymmetrical, with a somewhat rectangular shape resembling a meat cleaver, hence the name. The shaft of a cleaver blade connects to the blade offset to the top corner of the blade. The shape of the face and the offset connection is designed to maximize the surface area of the blade in contact with the water during the rowing stroke, while also minimizing the amount and depth of the shaft that is submerged and contributing to drag. As the cleaver blade is asymmetrical it may only be used on one side of the boat or the other. Technically, this is true of all oars, as the blade sits at a slight angle to the squared off surface on the sleeve. Thus, when the oar is allowed to rest, it is not parallel to the water surface. If used on the wrong side of the boat, the blade would dig into the water rather than skimming across its surface.\nCleaver blade designs were first developed by Dick and Pete Dreissigacker in 1991. They are now manufactured by most major rowing oar suppliers, including Concept2 and Croker.\nMacon.\nSome clubs use the older \"macon\" style blades (also called \"spoons\" or \"tulips\" or \"shovels\") for novice crews, usually to develop the basic technique of the rower without the extra complexity of a cleaver blade. A minority of coaches favor macons, but it has been generally accepted since their introduction in 1992 that cleavers give a speed advantage over macons under most conditions.\nMacon blades are symmetrical, with an elliptical shape and a ridgeline running down the center of the blade face. The blade is squared off at the end. Despite the blade being symmetrical, modern asymmetrical collars or aesthetic issues regarding decorative paint on the blade face may dictate which side of the boat the blade can be rowed on.\nMacon blades achieved prominence at the 1959 European Championship in Mâcon when they were used by the West German national team. West Germany won all the male sweep events that year, except the coxless four.\nSquare.\nBefore macons a longer, thinner shape was used, known as \"square\" or \"standard\" blades. Some rowers of traditional skiffs use them but macons or wider oars dominate in dinghy rowing. A few racing shell clubs/coaches keep some for training for technique in their learner boats.\nAt any given moment a propelling blade seen stationary, outboard of that point shifts water providing guaranteed drive (linear velocity), and inboard of it relative drag (radial velocity). Shorter, wider blades concentrate the former yet must be in a design not liable to snap. Thus the development from standard to macon to cleaver is a progression from long, thin blades to shorter, wider ones and more durable material. Each stage is a reduction in the solid-2D-profile, current and eddies that, at typical speeds, may work the wrong way and chiefly in a purely radial way in favour of pure lineal velocity."

        "title": "Duke lacrosse case",
        "text": "The Duke lacrosse case was a widely reported 2006 criminal case in Durham, North Carolina, United States, in which three members of the Duke University men's lacrosse team were falsely accused of rape. The three students were David Evans, Collin Finnerty, and Reade Seligmann. The accuser was Crystal Mangum, a student at North Carolina Central University who worked part-time as a strip tease dancer. She alleged that the rape occurred at a party hosted by the lacrosse team, held at the Durham residence of two of the team's captains, and where she had worked on March 13, 2006. \nInvestigation and resolution of the case sparked public discussion of racism, sexual violence, media bias, and due process on campuses. The former lead prosecutor, Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong, ultimately resigned in disgrace, and was disbarred and briefly imprisoned for violating ethics standards.\nOn April 11, 2007, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper dropped all charges, declaring the three lacrosse players \"innocent\" and victims of a \"tragic rush to accuse\". \nCooper described Nifong as a \"rogue prosecutor\"; the district attorney withdrew from the case in January 2007 after the North Carolina State Bar filed ethics charges against him. In June 2007, Nifong was disbarred for \"dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation\", making him the first prosecutor in North Carolina disbarred for trial conduct. Nifong served one day in jail for lying about sharing DNA tests (criminal contempt); he had not given results to the defense team. The lab director said it was a misunderstanding and Nifong claimed it was due to weak memory. \nWhile DNA analysis did not show evidence from any of the men she accused, Mangum continued to insist she was sexually assaulted that night. She was not charged for her allegations.\nCooper noted several inconsistencies between Mangum's accounts of the evening, and the alibis offered by Seligmann and Finnerty, which was supported by forensic evidence. The Durham Police Department was strongly criticized for violating their own policies by allowing Nifong to act as the \"de facto\" head of the investigation; using an unreliable suspect-only photo identification procedure with Mangum; pursuing the case despite vast discrepancies in notes taken by Investigator Benjamin Himan and Sgt. Mark Gottlieb; and distributing a poster that appeared to presume the suspects' guilt shortly after the allegations were made public. \nSeligmann, Finnerty, and Evans brought a civil lawsuit against Duke University, which was settled. The university paid approximately $20 million to each claimant. The claimants also sought further unspecified damages and called for criminal justice reform laws in a federal civil rights lawsuit filed against the City of Durham and its police department.\nTimeline of events.\nEvents at the house.\nIn March 2006, Crystal Mangum, a student at North Carolina Central University, had been working part-time as a stripper. She was divorced and supported two children. Although Mangum claimed that she had only recently taken up stripping, further investigating revealed that she had worked at strip clubs since at least 2002, during which time she was arrested for attempting to run over a police officer in a taxi she had stolen. The incident report stated that she had been lap dancing at a strip club that evening.\nOn March 13, 2006, the lacrosse team held a party at 610 North Buchanan Boulevard, a house owned by Duke University and used as the off-campus residence of the lacrosse team's captains. The team intended for the party to be compensation for having to remain on campus during spring break, due to their competition schedule, and alcohol was consumed. Several players were unaware that strippers had been hired, and only after their arrival were they asked to contribute to the strippers' fees.\nA team captain contacted Allure, an escort service, and requested two white strippers. However, the two women who had arrived, Mangum and Kim Mera Roberts (aka Kim Mera Pittman), were black and biracial (half-black/half-Asian), respectively. Before arriving at the party, Mangum, by her own admission, had consumed alcohol and Flexeril (a prescription muscle relaxant). Mangum and Roberts traveled to the party separately. Roberts drove herself and arrived first, and Mangum was later dropped off by a man.\nAccording to the team captains, while the strippers were dancing, a player asked if the women had any sex toys. Roberts responded by asking if the player's penis was too small. The player brandished a broomstick and suggested that she \"use this [as a sex toy]\". At this exchange, the women stopped their performance, and left the living room, shutting themselves in the main bathroom of the house. While the women were still in the bathroom, players Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty left the house. When the women eventually came out, Mangum began roaming around the yard, half-dressed and shouting.\nAccording to Mangum, the women were coaxed back into the house with an apology, at which point they were separated. She asserts that she was dragged into a bathroom and raped, beaten, and choked for a half hour. Later, police received a 9-1-1 call from a woman complaining that white men had gathered outside of the house where the party took place, had called her racial slurs, and threatened to sodomize her with a broomstick.\nSome of the party attendees expressed displeasure that the strippers had delivered a very short performance, despite being paid several hundred dollars apiece to perform. The team captain who had hired the strippers tried to convince the women to go back inside and complete the performance. Both women returned inside, but upon being approached by the player who had earlier brandished the broomstick, again refused to perform, and once again locked themselves in the bathroom. By this point, a number of the party guests had left. House residents, including player David Evans, asked the remaining guests to leave because they were concerned that the noise would cause neighbors to complain to police. When the strippers left the bathroom, and the house, for the second time, a resident locked the door so they (and the guests who had left the house) could not return.\nAround 1:00a.m., while attempting to leave the party, Mangum and Roberts called the partygoers \"short dick white boys\", and jeered about \"how he couldn't get it on his own and had to pay for it\". One player responded, \"We asked for whites, not niggers.\" Mangum and Roberts departed in Roberts's car. Roberts called 9-1-1 and reported that she had just come from 610 North Buchanan, and a \"white guy\" had yelled \"nigger\" at her from near the East Campus wall. The party ended shortly thereafter and everyone, including the residents, left the house. Police returned to the house later, as a result of Roberts' complaint, but did not receive an answer at the door; a neighbor confirmed that an earlier party had ended.\nAfter departure.\nAs Roberts drove away with Mangum, the two women began to argue. Roberts stopped the car and attempted to push Mangum out. When that failed, Roberts drove Mangum to a nearby Kroger supermarket, went inside, and told a female security guard that a woman was refusing to leave her car. The guard walked to the car and asked Mangum to leave, but Mangum remained in the vehicle. The guard later said she had not smelled alcohol on Mangum's breath, but thought she might have been under the influence of other drugs. At 1:22a.m., the guard called 9-1-1 to report that Mangum was refusing to leave a vehicle that did not belong to her. Police arrived, removed Mangum from the car, and questioned her.\nAs Mangum had no identification, would not talk to police, was having difficulty walking, and seemed severely impaired, police took her to Durham Center Access, a mental-health and substance-abuse facility, for involuntary commitment. During the admission process, she claimed that she had been raped prior to her arrival.\nMangum was transferred to Duke University Medical Center. Examination of her skin, arms, and legs revealed no swelling, no abnormalities, and three small cuts on her right knee and right heel. When asked, she specifically, and repeatedly, denied receiving any physical blows by hands. Further examination showed no tenderness in the back, chest, and neck. There was, however, diffuse swelling of her vagina. Mangum later claimed that she had performed using a vibrator, for a couple in a hotel room, shortly before the lacrosse team party. This activity, or a yeast infection, could have caused the swelling. Investigators did not note any other injuries in the rest of the report.\nMcFadyen e-mail.\nA couple of hours after the party ended, Ryan McFadyen, a member of the lacrosse team, sent an e-mail to other players saying that he planned to have some strippers over, kill them, and cut off their skin while wearing his Duke-issue spandex and ejaculating.\nThe e-mail began:\nTo whom it may concern, tomorrow night, after tonights show, ive decided to have some strippers over to edens 2c. all are welcome.. however there will be no nudity. I plan on killing the bitches as soon as the[y] walk in and proceding to cut their skin off while cumming in my duke issue spandex . . all in besides arch and tack [two of his teammates] please respond\nSome of the players suggested the e-mail was intended as humorous irony. Administrators asserted the e-mail was in imitation of Patrick Bateman, the protagonist in the Bret Easton Ellis novel \"American Psycho\", which was read and lectured upon in more than one Duke class, as evidenced by the e-mail responses from other players. One wrote, \"I'll bring the Phil Collins,\" a reference to the \"American Psycho\" book and film. Police released the McFadyen e-mail but refused to release the following e-mail exchanges, leaving the impression that the McFadyen e-mail was intended as a serious threat. McFadyen thereafter received a thousand death threats in one week.\nThe e-mail led many people to assume guilt on the part of the players. McFadyen was not charged with any crime, but he was temporarily suspended from Duke, with the university citing safety concerns. He was invited back to Duke to continue his studies later that summer.\nInvestigation and prosecution.\nArrests and investigation timeline.\nOn March 14, 2006, the day after the party, the Durham Police Department (DPD) began their investigation into the rape allegations by interviewing Mangum and searching 610 North Buchanan pursuant to a warrant. The three team captains who lived at the house, including Evans, voluntarily gave statements and DNA samples to police and offered to take lie detector tests. The police turned down the offer. \nThe DPD made their investigation public on March 15, when Sgt. Mark Gottlieb, the police supervisor, posted on a digital community bulletin board that they were investigating the rape of a young woman by three males at 610 North Buchanan on March 13, and asking anyone in the area who saw or heard anything unusual to contact Investigator Benjamin Himan.\nBetween March 16 and 21, police showed Mangum photo arrays in an attempt to have her identify her attackers. Each photo array contained photographs only of lacrosse team members. This did not follow the DPD's recommended policy of including photos of individuals not regarded as potential suspects (known as \"fillers\"). Mangum identified Seligmann as someone who attended the party, but not as an attacker, and did not identify Evans at all despite seeing his photo twice.\nOn March 27, Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong received his first briefing on the case from Gottlieb and Himan. Within a few hours of receiving the briefing, Nifong made his first public statement on the case. Over the following week, Nifong by his own estimate gave fifty to seventy interviews and devoted more than forty hours to reporters. After that he continued to make statements, albeit less frequently. Many of these statements concerned the team members' alleged failure or refusal to provide information to law enforcement authorities, their invocation of their constitutional rights, or consisted of Nifong's own opinions that a crime had occurred, that it was racially motivated, and that one or more lacrosse players were guilty.\nMangum was shown another photo array containing only photos of the 46 white lacrosse team members, including members who had not attended the party. There were no fillers included. The photos were shown to Mangum as a PowerPoint presentation, with each photo projected individually to her, rather than the pictures being arrayed together. For the first time, Mangum identified photos of Seligmann, Evans, and Finnerty as her attackers. She also identified at least one other photo as being a player who was present at the party; further investigation showed he had not been there.\nOn April 10, an attorney retained by one of the lacrosse players stated that time-stamped photographs existed which showed that Mangum was already injured when she arrived at the party, and was visibly impaired. Players' attorneys announced that DNA testing by the North Carolina state crime lab had failed to connect any members of the Duke men's lacrosse team to the alleged rape.\nSeligmann and Finnerty were arrested and indicted on April 18 on charges of first degree forcible rape, first degree sexual offense and kidnapping. The same day, search warrants were executed on Finnerty and Seligmann's dorm rooms. Seligmann reportedly told multiple teammates, \"I'm glad they picked me\", alluding to a solid alibi in the form of ATM records, photographs, cell phone records, an affidavit from a taxi driver, and a record of his DukeCard being swiped at his dorm.\nDNA Security Inc. (DSI), a private company engaged by Nifong to perform a second round of DNA testing, produced an incomplete report. It contained an analysis of DNA found on false fingernails discarded by Mangum in the bathroom trash bin, and concluded that 2% of the male population, including Evans, could not be excluded from a match with the fingernail DNA. DSI director Brian Meehan later testified that, pursuant to an agreement with Nifong, he had deliberately withheld information from the lab's report.\nOn May 15, 2006, former team captain and 2006 Duke graduate Evans was also indicted on charges of first-degree forcible rape, sexual offense and kidnapping. Just before turning himself in at the Durham County Detention Center, he publicly declared his innocence and his expectation of being cleared of the charges within weeks.\nCourt documents revealed that Roberts, in her initial statement, had said she was with Mangum the entire evening except for a period of less than five minutes. After hearing Mangum claim she was sexually assaulted, Roberts called those claims \"a crock\".\nOn December 22, 2006, Nifong dropped the rape charges against all three lacrosse players after Mangum told an investigator a different version of events and said she was no longer sure about some aspects of her original story. The kidnapping and sexual offense charges were still pending against all three players.\nOn December 28, 2006, the North Carolina bar filed ethics charges against Nifong over his conduct in the case, accusing him of making public statements that were prejudicial to the administration of justice and heightened public condemnation of the accused, and of engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. The 17-page document accused Nifong of violating four rules of professional conduct, listing more than 100 examples of statements he made to the media.\nOn January 12, 2007, Nifong sent a letter to North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper asking to be taken off the case. The following day, January 13, Cooper announced that his office would take over the case.\nOn January 24, 2007, the North Carolina State Bar filed a second round of ethics charges against Nifong for a systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion that was prejudicial to the administration of justice by his withheld DNA evidence to mislead the court.\nOn March 23, 2007, Justin Paul Caulfield, a legal analyst for the sports magazine \"Inside Lacrosse\", stated on Fox News that the charges against Evans, Finnerty, and Seligmann would soon be dropped. While the North Carolina Attorney General's Office first disputed the report, on April 11, 2007, it announced that it had dismissed all charges against the three lacrosse players. \nCooper also took the unusual step of declaring the accused players innocent. He announced that Mangum would not be prosecuted, stating that investigators and attorneys who had interviewed her thought \"she may actually believe the many different stories that she has been telling ... it's in the best interest of justice not to bring charges\".\nOn April 12, 2007, the attorney general, in declaring Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans innocent, described Nifong as a \"rogue prosecutor\".\nDNA tests.\nShortly after the party, the prosecution ordered 46 of the 47 lacrosse team members to provide DNA samples, although some members had not attended the event. The sole black member of the team was exempt because Mangum had stated that her attackers were white. On April 10, 2006, the district attorney announced that DNA testing by the state crime lab did not connect any of the 46 tested team members to the alleged rape.\nAfter the initial tests by the state crime lab, prosecutor Nifong sought the services of a private laboratory, DNA Security, Inc. (aka DSI) of Burlington, North Carolina, to conduct additional tests. DNA from multiple unidentified males had been found in forensic evidence from Mangum and upon the rape kit items that had been tested, but none matched any of the lacrosse players. Nifong falsely represented to the court and the public that DNA had been found only from a single male source, Mangum's boyfriend.\nIn a motion made on December 15, 2006, defense attorneys argued that the DNA analysis report written by DSI and provided to them by Nifong's office was incomplete, because it omitted information showing that none of the genetic material from several men found on Mangum matched any DNA sample from the lacrosse team. Brian Meehan, the director of DSI who wrote the misleading report, testified that his lab did not try to withhold information, but acknowledged that the decision not to release the full report violated the lab's policies. Meehan testified that after discussions with Nifong, he decided to withhold the names of the persons excluded by the DNA testing (all 46 tested members of the lacrosse team) to protect the privacy of players not implicated in the case. But two players (Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty) had already been indicted for rape more than three weeks prior to the release date of the report. Meehan was later fired in October 2007 based on his actions in this case.\nDNA was also taken from all surfaces of three of Mangum's false fingernails retrieved from the trash in the party house bathroom (widely but inaccurately reported as DNA taken only from the \"underside\" of a single fingernail). According to DNA Security, the fingernail DNA showed some characteristics similar to lacrosse player David Evans's DNA. However, the match was not conclusive, as 2% of the male population (including Evans) could not be excluded based on the sample. In addition, because Evans lived in the house, defense attorneys contended that any DNA present might have come from the tissue paper, cotton swabs, or other hygiene-related trash that had been in the garbage can along with the fingernail. This was confirmed later by Attorney General Cooper's investigation: \"to the extent that Evans's DNA could not be excluded, the SBI experts confirmed that the DNA could easily have been transferred to the fingernails from other materials in the trash can\".\nNifong contended that lack of DNA evidence is not unusual and that 75–80% of all sexual assault cases lack DNA evidence. Rape victims often delay reporting by days or weeks, inadvertently destroying DNA evidence. However, in this case, Mangum had a rape-kit exam administered only hours after the end of the party, so experts believed that it was unlikely that there ever had been DNA evidence implicating any player. \nNifong was tried for ethics violations on June 14, 2007. That day, the complete DNA findings were revealed during defense attorney Brad Bannon's testimony. According to conservative estimates, the lab had discovered at least two unidentified males' DNA in Mangum's pubic region; at least two unidentified males' DNA in her rectum; at least four to five unidentified males' DNA on her underpants; and at least one identified male's DNA in her vagina.\nCollin Finnerty previous incident.\nIn November 2005, Finnerty and two of his Chaminade High School lacrosse teammates were charged with misdemeanor simple assault in Washington, D.C., following an altercation with a Washington man outside a Georgetown bar. Finnerty was accused of threatening and taunting the man.\nAlthough the man alleged that Finnerty had pushed and threatened him, the man was punched by a third party (a friend of Finnerty), who admitted to the punch. Witnesses later testified that Finnerty had been hit in the head by a friend of the alleged victim. Although the man alleged that Finnerty and his companions had called him \"gay\" (among other derogatory names), the incident was not prosecuted as a hate crime. Finnerty was initially accepted into a diversion program for first offenders, allowing for the simple assault charge to be dismissed upon his completion of community service.\nBut, after Finnerty was charged in Durham, the Washington, D.C., prosecutor cancelled his diversion agreement and proceeded to trial on the assault charge. \nFinnerty was convicted and sentenced to six months' probation. Afterward, he was repeatedly threatened by Judge John H. Bayly, Jr. with confinement. Once after an anonymous blog post falsely accused him of violating an order that prohibited him from being in Georgetown; and again after he was absent from home and missed an obligatory curfew in order to be in Durham to work on his defense there. But he had cleared this absence with the judge. According to R. B. Parrish, this treatment was similar to attempts by the government to pressure witnesses to testify in a certain manner. On December 28, 2006, shortly after the Durham rape charges against Finnerty were dropped, Judge Bayly ended Finnerty's probation.\nIn January 2007, Finnerty's assault conviction was vacated (by an order signed by Bayly) and his record was cleared.\nDefense and media questioning.\nCredibility of Crystal Mangum as accuser.\nPossible intoxication and mental state.\nLawyers for the Duke lacrosse players have said that Mangum was intoxicated with alcohol and possibly other drugs on the night of the party. By the accuser's own admission to police, she had taken prescription Flexeril and drank \"one or two large-size beers\" before she went to the party.\nThe Attorney General's office later noted that Mangum had taken Ambien, methadone, Paxil, and amitriptyline, although when she began taking these medications is uncertain. She had a long history of mental problems and reportedly was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\nInconsistencies in Mangum's story.\nOver the course of the scandal, police reports, media investigations, and defense attorneys' motions and press conferences brought to light several key inconsistencies in Mangum's story.\nSome of the questions about her credibility were:\nOther credibility issues.\nThe Duke defense lawyers or media reports have indicated:\nDurham Police Department's actions.\nLawyers and media have questioned the methods of the photo identification process, and have argued that the police supervisor in the case, Sgt. Mark Gottlieb, has unfairly targeted Duke students in the past.\nPhoto identification.\nLawyers and media reports alike suggested the photo identification process was severely flawed. During the photo identifications, Mangum was told that she would be viewing Duke University lacrosse players who attended the party, and was asked if she remembered seeing them at the party and in what capacity. Defense attorneys claimed this was essentially a \"multiple-choice test in which there were no wrong answers\", while Duke law professor James Earl Coleman Jr. posits that \"[t]he officer was telling the witness that all are suspects, and say, in effect, 'Pick three.' It's so wrong.\"\nU.S. Department of Justice guidelines suggest including at least five non-suspect filler photos for each suspect included, as did the Durham Police Department's own General Order 4077, adopted in February 2006.\nRoss (the only player she identified as attending the party with 100% certainty during both procedures) provided police investigators with evidence that he was with his girlfriend at North Carolina State University before, during, and after the party through cell phone records and an affidavit from a witness. Another person whom the accuser had identified in April also provided police with evidence that he did not attend the party at all. In regards to Seligmann's identification, Mangum's confidence increased from 70% in March to 100% in April. Gary Wells—an Iowa State University professor and expert on police identification procedures—has asserted that memory does not improve with time.\nAccording to the transcript of the photo identification released on \"The Abrams Report\", Mangum also stated that David Evans had a mustache on the night of the attack. Evans's lawyer stated that his client has never had a mustache and that photos as well as eyewitness testimony would reveal that Evans has never had a mustache.\nAccusations of intimidation tactics.\nDefense lawyers suggested police used intimidation tactics on witnesses. On May 11, Moezeldin Elmostafa, an immigrant taxi driver who signed a sworn statement about Seligmann's whereabouts that defense lawyers say provides a solid alibi, was arrested on a 2½-year-old shoplifting charge. Arresting officers first asked if he had anything new to say about the lacrosse case. When he refused to alter his testimony, he was taken into custody. An arrest and conviction would have destroyed his chance for citizenship and could have led to his deportation. Elmostafa was subsequently tried on the shoplifting charge and acquitted, after a grainy security tape proved that a security guard who was the prosecution's chief witness had \"misremembered\" events.\nPolice also arrested Mangum's former husband, Kenneth McNeil; her boyfriend, Matthew Murchison; and another friend, with the disposition of their own separate cases entirely in the hands of District Attorney Nifong. The daughter of Durham's police chief was arrested on an old warrant, and the chief himself remained absent from duty and invisible to the press for most of the case.\nSupervisor.\n\"The News &amp; Observer\" suggested that the supervisor of the lacrosse investigation, Sgt. Mark Gottlieb, had unfairly targeted Duke students in the past, putting some of his investigational tactics into question. Gottlieb has made a disproportionate number of arrests of Duke students for misdemeanor violations, such as carrying an open container of alcohol. Normally, these violations earn offenders a pink ticket similar to a traffic ticket.\nFrom May 2005 to February 2006, when Sgt. Gottlieb was a patrol officer in District 2, he made 28 total arrests. Twenty of those arrests were Duke students, and at least 15 were handcuffed and taken to jail. This is in stark contrast to the other two officers on duty in the same district during that same 10-month period. They made 64 total arrests, only two of which were Duke students. Similarly, \"The News &amp; Observer\" charges that Gottlieb treated non-students very differently. For example, he wrote up a young man for illegally carrying a concealed .45-caliber handgun and possession of marijuana (crimes far more severe than the Duke students who were taken to jail committed), but did not take him to jail. Residents complimented Gottlieb for dealing fairly with loud parties and disorderly conduct by students.\nDuke's student newspaper, \"The Chronicle\", depicted other examples of violence and dishonesty from Sgt. Gottlieb. It published that one student threw a party at his rental home off-East Campus before a Rolling Stones concert in October 2005. The morning after the concert, at 3:00 a.m., Sgt. Gottlieb led a raid on the home with nine other officers while the students were half asleep. It reported that one student was dragged out of bed and then dragged down the stairs, that all seven housemates were put in handcuffs, arrested, and taken into custody for violating a noise ordinance and open container of alcohol violations. Sgt. Gottlieb reportedly told one student, an American citizen of Serbian descent, that he could be deported. Other stories include the throwing of a 130-pound male against his car for an open container of alcohol violation, refusing the ID of a student because he was international, searching through a purse without a warrant, refusing to tell a student her rights, and accusations of perjury.\nProsecutor Nifong's actions.\nPossible political motivation.\nAt the time the rape allegations were made in March 2006, Mike Nifong was in the midst of a difficult Democratic primary election campaign to keep his position as Durham County District Attorney, facing strong opposition. It was understood that if Nifong lost the primary, he would very likely lose his job. Some commentators have opined that Nifong's prosecution of the Duke lacrosse players and his many statements to the media were driven by his political strategy to attract African-American voters. The primary was held on May 6, 2006, and Nifong won by a slim margin of 883 votes. Results showed Nifong won the primary on the basis of strong support from the black community. Nifong went on to win the general election in November 2006, although by a lower margin than usual for Democratic candidates in Durham County at that time.\nProsecution's chief investigator.\nNifong hired Linwood E. Wilson as his chief investigator. During Wilson's private detective career, at least seven formal inquiries into his conduct were performed. In 1997, Wilson was reprimanded by the state commission. After his appeal of the decision was rejected, he allowed his detective license to expire. In response to criticism, Wilson stated that no one had ever questioned his integrity. On June 25, 2007, shortly after Nifong's disbarment and removal from office, it was reported that Nifong's replacement, interim district attorney Jim Hardin Jr., fired Wilson from his post.\nWider effects.\nEffects on Duke faculty.\nMike Pressler, the coach of the lacrosse team, received threatening e-mails and hate calls, had castigating signs placed on his property, and was the frequent victim of vandalism in the aftermath of the accusations. On April 5, 2006, he resigned (later revealed to have been forced) shortly after the McFadyen e-mail became public. Through his lawyer, he stated that his resignation was not an admission of wrongdoing on his part. On the same day, Richard H. Brodhead, president of Duke University, suspended the remainder of the lacrosse season.\nOther Duke faculty members (sometimes referred to as the Group of 88 or the \"Gang of 88\") have been criticized for their \"Social Disaster\" letter as well as individual comments and reactions which created a perception of prejudgment.\nEffect on Duke students.\nShortly after the party, the University's president warned in a school-wide e-mail of threats of gang violence against Duke students. Other Duke students claimed they had been threatened. Mobs protested outside the house that had been the site of the party, banging pots and pans at early hours of the morning.\nPhotographs of lacrosse team members had been posted prominently around Durham and on the Duke University campus with accompanying captions requesting that they come forward with information about the incident.\nMedia policies regarding identity revelation of accusers and accused.\nFox News was the sole national television news outlet to reveal Mangum's photo following the dismissal of the case, although MSNBC and \"60 Minutes\" revealed her name. Several major broadcasters did not publish Mangum's name at any point, including ABC, PBS, CNN, and NBC.\nPublication of Mangum's identity.\nPartially obscured photos of Mangum at the party were broadcast by \"The Abrams Report\" on cable news channel MSNBC and by local television affiliate NBC 17 WNCN in North Carolina. On April 21, 2006, outspoken talk-radio host Tom Leykis disclosed Mangum's name during his nationally syndicated talk-radio program. Leykis has disclosed identities of accusers of sexual assault in the past. On May 15, 2006, MSNBC host Tucker Carlson disclosed Mangum's first name only on his show, \"Tucker\". Court records presented by the defense revealed Mangum's name.\nOn April 11, 2007, several other mainstream media sources revealed or used Mangum's name and/or picture after the attorney general dropped all the charges and declared the players innocent. These sources include: CBS, \"The News &amp; Observer\", WRAL, all The McClatchy Company's newspapers (which includes 24 newspapers across the country), Fox News, \"The Charlotte Observer\", the \"New York Post\", Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" (airdate April 12, 2007) and MSNBC.\nEffect on community relations.\nThe allegations have inflamed already strained relations between Duke University and its host city of Durham, with members of the Duke lacrosse team being vilified in the press and defamed on and off campus. On May 1, 2006, the New Black Panthers held a protest outside Duke University. The case drew national attention and highlighted racial tensions within the Durham area.\nJesse Jackson and Rainbow/PUSH involvement.\nIn 2006, Jesse Jackson promised the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition would pay the college tuition for Mangum. Jackson said the tuition offer would still be good even if Mangum had fabricated her story.\nAftermath.\nMike Nifong.\nOn June 16, 2007, the North Carolina State Bar ordered Nifong disbarred after the bar's three-member disciplinary panel unanimously found him guilty of fraud, dishonesty, deceit or misrepresentation; of making false statements of material fact before a judge; of making false statements of material fact before bar investigators, and of lying about withholding exculpatory DNA evidence.\nFollowing the state bar's announcement, Nifong submitted a letter of resignation from his post as Durham County district attorney, that would have become effective in July 2007. However, on June 18, Durham Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson ordered that Nifong be immediately removed from office.\nOn August 31, 2007, Nifong was held in criminal contempt of court for knowingly making false statements to the court during the criminal proceedings. Durham Superior Court Judge W. Osmond Smith III sentenced Nifong to one day in jail, which he subsequently served.\nCrystal Mangum.\nOn December 15, 2006, it was reported that Mangum was pregnant and the judge in the case ordered a paternity test.\nIn May 2008, Mangum graduated from North Carolina Central University with a degree in police psychology.\nOn August 22, 2008, a press release announced the planned publication in October 2008 of a memoir by Mangum, \"The Last Dance for Grace: The Crystal Mangum Story\".\nThe press release indicated the book \"can't and doesn't deal with the complex legal aspects of the case\" but that \"the muddling of facts about Crystal's life, along with North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper's desire to settle the dispute over open file discovery, swallowed the case whole\". Defense attorney Joseph Cheshire responded to the news by saying that if the book was truthful, \"I think it would be fabulous, and I don't think anybody would think badly about her in any way, shape or form\", but that if the memoir did not acknowledge the falsity of her allegations against the players, that he would advise them to initiate civil action against her. Her book was published later that year. In it, she continued to contend that she had been raped at the party and that the dropping of the case was politically motivated. The book outlined her earlier life, including a claim that she was first raped at the age of 14.\nIn November 2013, she was found guilty of second-degree murder after she stabbed boyfriend Reginald Daye, who died 10 days after. She argued that she acted in self-defense, fearing that Daye would kill her. She was sentenced to 14 to 18 years in prison.\nReade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty, and David Evans.\nOn June 18, 2007, Duke University announced that it had reached a settlement with Seligmann, Finnerty and Evans. No details of the settlement were disclosed.\nDuke reportedly agreed to pay $60 million to the three accused (with each player receiving $20 million) subject to confidentiality requirements. Seligmann's attorney told the \"New York Daily News\" that the settlement was \"nowhere near that much money\".\nSeligmann enrolled as a student at Brown University in the fall of 2007, and was an important part of Brown reaching the 2009 NCAA lacrosse tournament as well as a number 10 national ranking. He became an active fundraiser and supporter for the Innocence Project. He graduated from Brown in 2010 and from Emory University School of Law in 2013. He has stated that his experience during the Duke lacrosse case motivated him to attend law school and pursue a legal career.\nFinnerty enrolled at Loyola College in Maryland, leading the team in scoring as the Greyhounds qualified for the 2010 NCAA lacrosse tournament. Finnerty graduated from Loyola in May 2010.\nDavid Evans, who had already graduated from Duke before being charged, received an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in May 2012.\nDuke men's lacrosse team.\nIn January 2007, lacrosse team member Kyle Dowd filed a lawsuit against Duke University and against a visiting associate professor and member of the Group of 88, Kim Curtis, claiming he and another teammate were given failing grades on their final paper as a form of retaliation after the scandal broke. The case was settled with the terms undisclosed except that Dowd's grade was altered to a P (for \"Pass\").\nProfessor Houston Baker, who continued to accuse Dowd and the others of being \"hooligans\" and \"rapists\", called Dowd's mother \"the mother of a farm animal\" after she e-mailed him. Duke Provost Peter Lange responded to Baker, criticizing Baker for prejudging the team based on race and gender, citing this as a classic tactic of racism.\nDuke's athletic director at the time, Joe Alleva, who forced lacrosse coach Mike Pressler's resignation, faced criticism for his handling of this case. In 2008, Alleva announced he was leaving Duke for the athletic director position at Louisiana State University. The lacrosse team, reinstated for the 2007 season, reached the NCAA Finals as the #1 seed. The Blue Devils lost to the Johns Hopkins University Blue Jays in the championship, 12–11.\nIn May 2007, Duke requested that the NCAA restore a year's eligibility to the players on the 2006 men's team, part of whose season was canceled. The NCAA granted the team's request for another year of eligibility, which applies to the 33 members of the 2006 team who were underclassmen in 2006 and who remained at Duke in 2007. Four of the seniors from 2006 attended graduate school at Duke in 2007 and played for the team. In 2010, the final year in which the team included fifth-year seniors (freshmen in 2006), Duke won the NCAA Lacrosse Championship beating Notre Dame, 6–5 in overtime, to give the school its first lacrosse championship.\nOn June 7, 2007, it was announced that lacrosse coach Mike Pressler and Duke had reached a financial settlement. Pressler was later hired as coach by Division II (now Division I) Bryant University in Rhode Island. In October 2007, Pressler filed suit seeking to undo the settlement and hold a trial on his wrongful termination claim on the grounds that Duke spokesman John Burness had made disparaging comments about him. After Duke failed in an attempt to have the case dismissed, the matter was settled in 2010 with Duke apologizing in a press release but refusing to comment regarding any compensation to Pressler.\nDuke University.\nOn September 29, 2007, Duke President Brodhead, speaking at a two-day conference at Duke Law School on the practice and ethics of trying cases in the media, apologized for \"causing the families to feel abandoned when they most needed support.\"\nOn July 12, 2010, Duke demolished the house where the party had taken place, 610 North Buchanan Boulevard, after it had sat unoccupied for the four years following the Duke lacrosse case.\nSgt. Mark Gottlieb.\nIn July 2014, Sgt. Mark Gottlieb committed suicide in DeKalb County, Georgia, where he had worked as a paramedic.\nLawsuits filed by players.\nOn September 7, 2007, it was reported that the three accused players (Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans), who had already settled with Duke University, planned to file a lawsuit for violations of their civil rights against the city of Durham and several city employees, unless the city agreed to a settlement including payment of $30 million over five years and the passage of new criminal justice reform laws. The city's liability insurance covers up to $5 million.\nLawyers cited three main areas of vulnerability for the city:\nDurham declined the settlement offer and on October 5, 2007, the three accused players filed a federal lawsuit alleging a broad conspiracy to frame them. Named in the suit were Nifong, the lab that handled the DNA work, the city of Durham, the city's former police chief, the deputy police chief, the two police detectives who handled the case and five other police department employees. The players were seeking unspecified damages, and also wanted to place the Durham Police Department under court supervision for 10 years, claiming the actions of the police department posed \"a substantial risk of irreparable injury to other persons in the City of Durham\". According to the suit, Nifong engineered the conspiracy to help him win support for his election bid. Nifong reportedly told his campaign manager that the case would provide \"'millions of dollars' in free advertising\".\nOn January 15, 2008, the city of Durham filed a motion to remove itself as a defendant, arguing it had no responsibility for Nifong's actions. On the same day, Nifong filed for bankruptcy. On May 27, 2008, Judge William L. Stocks lifted the stay from Nifong's bankruptcy filing and ruled that the plaintiffs' lawsuit could go forward.\nOn May 16, 2014, the three accused lacrosse players and the City of Durham settled their long-running lawsuit. Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans agreed to dismiss their lawsuit and received no monetary compensation whatsoever. The city agreed to make a $50,000 grant to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.\nLawsuit filed by non-accused players and their families.\nOn February 21, 2008, the families of 38 of the lacrosse team's 47 members who were not accused filed a 225-page lawsuit against Duke University, the Duke University Hospital, the city of Durham, and various officials of each organization for multiple claims of harassment, deprivation of civil rights, breach of contract and other claims.\nA Duke University spokesperson responded that \"we have now seen the lawsuit and as we said before, if these plaintiffs have a complaint, it is with Mr. Nifong. Their legal strategy – attacking Duke – is misdirected and without merit. To help these families move on, Duke offered to cover the cost of any attorneys' fees or other out-of-pocket expenses, but they rejected this offer. We will vigorously defend the university against these claims.\" The city never released an official response to the suit. The lawsuit against the university was settled out of court in 2013. Neither side would discuss the details of the settlement.\nESPN documentary: \"Fantastic Lies\".\nThe 2016 documentary film \"Fantastic Lies\", which centered around the case and its aftermath, was part of ESPN's \"30 for 30\" film series. It premiered on March 13, 2016, 10 years to the day after the lacrosse players hosted the house party where Mangum claimed she was raped.\nAmong the journalists invited to contribute was ESPN college basketball analyst and Duke graduate Jay Bilas, who in his other capacity as a practicing attorney later wrote a letter to the university administration criticizing their handling of the entire situation and describing president Brodhead as \"incapable of effectively leading Duke into the future.\" Crystal Mangum was approached by the film crew to tell her side of the story and agreed to do so, but prison officials would not allow her to be filmed. None of the players involved in the case appeared in the film, but Reade Seligmann's parents and Colin Finnerty’s father did."

        "title": "Almendares (baseball)",
        "text": "The Almendares B.B.C., also known as the Alacranes del Almendares, was one of the oldest and most distinguished baseball teams in the old Cuban League, which existed from 1878 to 1961. Almendares represented the Almendares District on the outskirts of the old city of Havana—when the league was founded it was still considered a suburban area, but later became a district within the enlarged city. Almendares was one of the most successful franchises in the Cuban League. In their early history they were known by their colors as the Blues; later they adopted the name of \"Alacranes\" (Spanish: \"Scorpions\"). Throughout their existence they had a famous rivalry with the Habana baseball club.\nAlmendares won 24 Cuban League championships (the first during the 1893–94 season and the last and in 1958–59) and two Caribbean Series (in 1949 and 1959).\nHistory.\nBaseball in Cuba was more than a sport; it became part of Cuba’s national identity. As baseball grew in the United States, its popularity also grew in Cuba. Cubans living in the U.S. learned and loved baseball, and realized it would be important for their country to have this sport for national unity. For Cubans, baseball offered the possibility of national integration of all Cubans, of all classes, black and white, young and old, men and women. Baseball also offered the Cubans something new to do, a new source of membership, an opportunity participate in something that was perceived to be distinctly Cuban. Cuba had successful baseball teams and players, which tended to unify the country. The Cuban people took great pride in their success in baseball.\nAfter a period of intramural play, professional teams were established. The Cuban League was founded in 1878, two years after the birth of the National League in the U.S. The original three professional clubs were the Habana, Matanzas, and Almendares. Teams were named for their areas. \nAlmendares won its first championship in 1893–94, carried by pitching ace Juan Manuel Pastoriza, the first of many good club pitchers. One thing that made the Almendares Baseball Club so successful is that it built its team around pitching rather than hitting. Almendares had many successful pitchers, including José Méndez and Adolfo Luque.\nAlmendares was the first Cuban team to play against a United States team, an 1881 game in Cuba, against the Bitter Hops Baseball Club. Throughout its existence Almendares had a rivalry with Habana. This rivalry started at the beginning of professional league play and lasted until the end. The club even had its own newspaper and magazine, called \"El Almendarista\". These publications grew in popularity almost as fast as new teams started. In 1886 baseball in Cuba was drawing record crowds. A championship game between Habana and Almendares had more than 6,000 fans attending. \nBaseball was absent in Cuba from 1895 to 1897 due to the Cuban War of Independence, but it resumed immediately after the War of ended, when professional teams including the Almendares resumed play. After the War, public attendance to baseball games increased, to over 5,000 weekly at Havana games.\nProfessional baseball clubs were not always racially integrated in Cuba. US racial barriers were first broken in Cuba in 1900, after which Cuban teams had access to the best Cuban players as well as those from the Negro league. Almendares was able to stay competitive the longest without acquiring players from the United States. Integrated baseball in Cuba served as a transition to integrated baseball in the US. In 1961 with Fulgencio Batista out of power and Fidel Castro taking over, professional baseball was abolished and replaced by the amateur Cuban baseball system.\nBaseball was not only important as entertainment; it also was important to Cuban culture. Among the most notable of the successes of Cuban baseball was the elimination of racial discrimination in Cuban baseball and the provision of expanded opportunities to play and watch the game throughout the island. Through good times and bad, baseball persisted as a source of national identity and collective unity.\nAlmendares played in the Almendares Park I from the team's inception until 1918, the park was located in Havana's Almendares district in what is now the Parque de La Pera, an urban park. For the 1918–19 season, Almendares moved to the Almendares Park II, a few blocks away from the ballpark's original location, in what is now the National Omnibus Terminal of Havana. In 1946, the club moved to the larger Estadio del Cerro."

        "title": "Grip (gymnastics)",
        "text": "Grips are devices that are worn on the hands of artistic gymnasts when performing on various apparatus. They are worn by female gymnasts on the uneven bars, and by male gymnasts on the high bar and still rings; it is rare to wear them on the parallel bars. Grips are used to enhance the gymnast's grip on the apparatus and to reduce friction, which can cause painful blisters and \"rips\", in which outer layers of skin separate and tear away from the hand.\nGrips are optional and are not used by all gymnasts. Some athletes substitute sports tape or gauze for grips, while others use bare hands. Most gymnasts apply powdered chalk (typically magnesium carbonate) to their grips, or to their hands if not using grips so that they do not slip.\nConstruction.\nA grip consists of a wide strip of leather joined to a wrist strap. The leather strip, which covers and protects the palm of the hand, is approximately five centimeters wide and has finger holes at one end. On properly fitted grips, the finger holes will be positioned at the first knuckles of the inserted fingers.\nSome types of grips, known as \"dowel grips\", incorporate a leather-covered dowel rod or pipe to create a linear bump on the outer face of the grip. This bump, in conjunction with the bar, forms a detent that serves to leverage the gymnast's grip, thus reducing the hand pressure needed to maintain a hold on the apparatus.\nThe wrist strap is used to secure the grip to the gymnast's hand and to transfer body weight from the fingers to the wrist. The grip is enhanced when the dowel rests on the apparatus, pulling the leather tight, and transferring some of the load to the wrist, reducing the grip required during the most dynamic elements. The leather portion of the grip encircles the wrist and is then locked in place with either velcro or buckles. Gymnasts typically wear soft material, such as cloth wristbands, under the wrist straps to prevent skin chafing. Some brands of grips include soft, removable pads that fit under the wrist straps.\nTypes of grips.\nMost competitive gymnasts wear dowel grips. On the high bar, men use grips that have three finger holes and a small dowel, whereas grips used on the still rings have a larger dowel and two finger holes. Grips used on the parallel bars (Very uncommon) have two finger holes and a small dowel. Women's grips have two finger holes and resemble men's ring grips with a smaller dowel.\nSome gymnasts do not use grips because they prefer to have their hands in close touch with the bar. Svetlana Khorkina of Russia, the Olympic gold medalist on bars in 1996 and 2000, did not wear them, and several Chinese gymnasts do not either.\nGymnasts at lower competition levels and those participating in recreational gymnastics typically use grips without dowel rods. Such grips provide no mechanical advantage for gripping the bar; they are used primarily to minimize friction injuries. These grips are usually less expensive and are made of thinner leather."

        "title": "Carlos Ruiz (baseball)",
        "text": "Carlos Joaquín Ruiz (born January 22, 1979), nicknamed \"Chooch\", is a Panamanian former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Seattle Mariners. Ruiz stands tall, and weighs . He bats and throws right-handed.\nAs a seven-year-old, Ruiz resolved to play in the big leagues after both his father and grandmother died within two weeks of each other. He made his way through the Phillies farm system from until , playing at each level of Minor League Baseball (MiLB). Ruiz soon fulfilled his childhood dream, making his MLB debut with the 2006 Phillies. He battled adversity in his progression through the system, including feeling homesick, a position change, and the language barrier (he spoke Spanish, while most teammates and team officials spoke English).\nRuiz spent his first full season in MLB with the Philadelphia Phillies in and remained there until he left the Mariners, electing free agency after the season. In , for his strong postseason performance, including a walk-off hit, during the Phillies playoff run that concluded with victory in the 2008 World Series, he earned the nickname \"Señor Octubre\" (Mr. October). Despite being one of the quietest players on the team, Ruiz was subsequently called the \"heart and soul\" of the Phillies, serving as a constant source of encouragement and rebuke alike to his teammates. Over the following seasons, he was a part of the core group of players that led the Phillies to five consecutive playoff appearances, from 2007 until 2011.\nRuiz had his best season in 2012, holding a batting average of over .300, earning his first appearance in the All-Star Game, and finishing in the top 30 of the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting. In 2013, he began the season with a 25-game suspension for using Adderall, and subsequently spent time on the disabled list, ultimately playing in fewer than 100 games for the first time in his MLB career.\nRuiz is the only player in the history of the NL to catch four no-hitters, and one of only two catchers in all of MLB to do so (the other being Jason Varitek).\nEarly life.\nRuiz grew up in David, Chiriquí, Panama, and was the oldest of three sons. His father was a police officer and his mother was an elementary school teacher. When he was seven years old, his father Joaquin was patrolling in his police jeep when a tire blew out, causing the vehicle to flip, throwing Joaquin into a ditch, and then crushing him when it fell on top of him. Just weeks before, his grandmother died of cancer. As a result, Ruiz became \"the new father\", starting work shortly thereafter as a laborer on a coffee farm to supplement the family income, and by age 10 was earning about per day. He also promised his widowed mother that he would make it to Major League Baseball to support the family. Subsequently, he began attending college to earn a degree in physical education, but dropped out shortly after he began to attend the Phillies baseball academy.\nRuiz's upbringing contributed to his approach to the game. His mother insisted that he excel academically, and would not allow him to play baseball unless he did well in school. Baseball was his first love, and he was responsible for organizing the community's games:\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nIn 1998, Ruiz followed his dream of playing professional baseball first by attending the Phillies Baseball Academy in La Vega, Dominican Republic, where he played catcher for the first time, moving from his initial position of second base. Though he was ready to quit because \"he looked and felt like a 10-year-old among the tall, athletic prospects surrounding him\", his uncle convinced him in a phone conversation to stick with it. The Phillies signed him as an amateur free agent on December 4, 1998, for , and he made his professional debut in 1999 with the Dominican Summer League (DSL) team DSL Phillies, with whom he compiled a .305 batting average, 4 home runs, and 35 runs batted in (RBIs) in 60 games. Prior to the 2000 season, Ruiz met Mick Billmeyer, the Phillies' minor league catching coordinator, who served as his mentor. Billmeyer sought to learn Spanish while Ruiz sought to learn English, and the two bonded as Billmeyer helped mold Ruiz into an eventual top prospect and ultimately a starting catcher. In 2000, he came to America, progressing to play in the Gulf Coast League (GCL) for the GCL Phillies, and hitting .277 in 38 games. He earned another promotion in 2001, playing for the Lakewood BlueClaws of Class A Minor League Baseball. In 2001, his performance was similar in quality to his first two seasons, and he was promoted to the Clearwater Threshers of Class A-Advanced, with whom he played over parts of the next two seasons. He struggled at the plate in 2002, compiling just a .213 batting average in 92 games, but hit .315 in 15 games in 2003, and that year earned another promotion.\nIn 2004, Ruiz spent the entire season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, posting a .284 batting average and hitting 17 home runs, the latter of which was second among catchers in the Eastern League. In addition to his strong offensive numbers, he threw out 25 of 76 attempted base stealers (32.9%). Off the field, it was in 2004 that Ruiz first gained the original form of his nickname \"Chooch\". Though a quiet individual, Ruiz frequently muttered \"chucha\" (a strong curse word in Panama) under his breath, and teammate Anderson Machado thus began to address Ruiz as \"chucha\", which was later shortened to \"Chooch\", and the nickname's usage snowballed from there. His strong performance earned him another promotion in 2005 when he played for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, and posted a better batting average but fewer home runs than in Reading: .300, 4 home runs, 40 RBIs in 100 games. Before the 2006 season, he played for his native Panama in the first World Baseball Classic. His final season in the minor leagues was 2006. During 100 games, he hit .307 with 16 home runs and 69 RBIs, earning International League all-star accolades. He moved back and forth between Triple-A and the major league Phillies all year long, making his MLB debut on May 6, 2006.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\n2006.\nRuiz was first brought up to the major league level when Phillies' starting catcher Mike Lieberthal went on the DL in May 2006, and Ruiz debuted on May 6. When Lieberthal returned, Ruiz was sent back to the minors. When Lieberthal went once again on the DL in June, the Phillies used Sal Fasano and Chris Coste rather than recalling Ruiz. He was recalled on July 4, when he hit his first major league home run off San Diego Padres' pitcher Clay Hensley. He was optioned back to the minor leagues once more before his recall on August 31—essentially a September callup. Overall, with the big league club, he hit .261 with 3 home runs and 10 RBIs.\n2007.\nRuiz permanently joined the Phillies' roster on opening day 2007, after eight seasons in the minor leagues. He ultimately \"grabbed hold of the top job [as starting catcher] and never let go\". The Phillies signed Rod Barajas before the season because of concerns about Ruiz's ability to catch, hit, and generally hold up over a full season at the major league level, as seasons there are longer than in the minor leagues. During the season, he honed his confidence and earned the trust of the Phillies' pitching staff, including veteran Jamie Moyer, who commented, \"I see a real assuredness to his body language. He's not cocky or brash. He just seems very confident in what's going on.\" On June 26, Ruiz stole home on the front end of a double steal in an 11–4 home win over the Cincinnati Reds, becoming the first Phillie to steal home since Scott Rolen in 1997. He eventually played 115 games over the season, and from then on was the Phillies' regular starting catcher. Statistically, he committed only two errors, which tied for second-best among MLB catchers with at least 100 games played. He had 27 multi-hit games, hit 6 home runs and 51 RBIs with a .259 batting average. At the conclusion of the season, he was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team.\n2008.\nRuiz entered the 2008 season focused predominantly on defense, specifically helping the pitcher:\nRuiz struggled to hit consistently throughout the season, specifically in the first half; from the beginning of the year until July 11, he hit .206 with 2 home runs and 20 RBIs. Nevertheless, due to his rapport with the pitching staff (pitchers' earned run average when throwing to him was 3.56, the best for any catcher in the National League), and a vote of confidence from manager Charlie Manuel, he was secure in his position. In late July, he had a multi-hit game against the New York Mets, which may have helped him break out of his slump. Ultimately, during the regular season, he hit .219 with 4 home runs and 31 RBIs.\nDespite his struggles at the plate during the regular season, Ruiz was an integral part of the Phillies' postseason success. After the Phillies clinched the 2008 National League Championship Series, he commented that the glory of winning a crucial baseball game that clinched the series, which he had witnessed while growing up in Panama on television, \"happened to me\", noting the aura of the moment, and that it culminated and validated the hard work he had put in over the years. Subsequently, in game 3 of the 2008 World Series, Ruiz tapped a ground ball up the third-base line for a walk-off infield single, the first in MLB history. Ruiz noted, \"I heard them cheering. And that's when I knew, 'Okay it's over' ... I'll take a win.\" The Phillies eventually won the World Series for the first time since 1980, doing so in five games, the last of which began on October 27 and ended on October 29 after it was suspended part-way through due to rain. For his performance in the playoffs, he earned the nickname \"Señor Octubre\" (Mr. October in Spanish).\n2009.\nInitially, Ruiz elected not to play in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, but after receiving a call from Martín Torrijos, the President of Panama, he agreed to play for the Panamanian team. Early in the season, he suffered a muscle strain in his right oblique, which lost him playing time while on the disabled list. Also early in the season, there was debate as to who should be the Phillies starting catcher, Ruiz or Chris Coste. Rob Neyer summarized the debate and ultimately endorsed Ruiz when he wrote, \nUltimately, Ruiz was the regular starter. He finished the season on a hot streak; over the last 24 games, he hit .355 with 9 doubles, 1 home run, 11 RBIs, and .446 on-base percentage (OBP). In late September, he missed a week of games with inflammation in his left wrist. Despite his missed time, he started 100 games and set career highs in home runs (9) and base on balls (47), as well as posting a .255 batting average and 43 RBIs. Moreover, he walked more times than he struck out, a rare feat among modern major league hitters. In the postseason, he led the team with a .341 batting average, and recorded a .491 OBP, having reached base in each of the Phillies' 15 games, which perpetuated the usage of his nickname \"Señor Octubre\". Marcus Hayes of the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" wrote that Ruiz is \"... the Phillies' Senor Octubre, a No. 8 hitter who hits like John Buck in the regular season, then turns into Johnny Bench come autumn.\"\n2010.\nIn 2010, Ruiz had a season filled with \"indelible moments\". He was catcher for Roy Halladay's perfect game on May 29, 2010, against the Florida Marlins and Halladay's no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds in the first game of the National League Divisional Series on October 6, 2010, the first time a catcher had caught two no-hitters in one season since 1972. On May 4, he hit a walk-off home run, the second of his career, to lead the Phillies over the St. Louis Cardinals. Ruiz spent time on the DL in late June and early July with a concussion, but according to manager Charlie Manuel returned with a more efficient swing that allowed him to hit better against power pitchers. He led the team with a .302 batting average and a .400 on-base percentage. Both statistics also led National League catchers, and he even received a few votes for NL most valuable player. During the 2010 postseason, he did not perform as well as in past years—in nine games, he hit .192 with two home runs and four RBIs. Fans voted Ruiz the \"X-Factor Player of the Year\" in MLB's This Year in Baseball Awards. He also received the Pride of Philadelphia Award from the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame. Halladay called Ruiz a \"rock\" behind the plate, and presented him with a replica of his Cy Young Award.\n2011.\nRuiz returned for the Phillies' 2011 season as their everyday starting catcher, and started 113 games, of which the Phillies won 70 (.619 winning percentage). In May, he spent time on the DL with inflammation in his lower back. Over the Phillies' final 36 games, he posted a .342 batting average. Overall, he finished with the best catcher's ERA in the major leagues (3.06), a .283 batting average, 6 home runs, and 40 RBIs. His batting average was second on the team trailing only Hunter Pence.\n2012.\nRuiz began the 2012 season strongly, and throughout the season was a bright spot on an otherwise disappointing team. Through June 27, he led the Major Leagues with a .364 average. This contributed to a stellar first half of the season earned him his first placement on the National League All-Star team. He was a reserve, though some analysts, including ESPN's John Kruk, felt his numbers warranted a starting nod, which ultimately went to the San Francisco Giants' Buster Posey through the fan voting. Shortly after the announcement that he was an all-star, a piece in \"The Philadelphia Daily News\" entitled \"The evolution of Carlos Ruiz\" summarized his career: \"Ruiz, though, was never a major prospect. He was a reserve catcher before he was a starting catcher. He was a bottom-of-the-order hitter before he was a middle-of-the-order hitter. And now, for the first time in his career, Carlos Ruiz is an All-Star.\" After the all-star break, he spent over a month on the disabled list with plantar fasciitis, hindering his statistical totals, which at the time of his injury were among the best in the National League. He led all NL catchers in doubles, en route to posting a .325 batting average with 16 home runs and 68 RBIs, all of which were career highs. He finished 28th in MVP voting, the third consecutive season he had received votes.\n2013.\nOn November 27, 2012, Ruiz was suspended for 25 games without pay by the MLB for testing positive for an amphetamine called Adderall. The suspension of Ruiz was effective at the start of the 2013 season. Adderall is a drug prescribed for treating ADHD, described as a \"central nervous system stimulant used to increase the attention span and decrease distractibility.\" He made his 2013 season debut on April 28 against the New York Mets at Citi Field. On May 20, he was placed on the DL with a Grade 2 strained hamstring. He came back with a four-hit game, which tied his career high, against the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 18, and hit .288 over the final two months of the season, commensurate with his past performance.\nIn the 2013 season, Ruiz compiled a .268 batting average, five home runs, and 37 RBIs in 92 games, his lowest major league total since 2006. After the season, Ruiz became a free agent. He re-signed on November 21, 2013, to a three-year contract worth plus a club option for a fourth season, giving the Phillies have an option to bring Ruiz back for a fourth season, at their discretion. Though one writer suggested his 2013 year might just have been an \"aberration\", most thought the Phillies overpaid to keep Ruiz, who turned 35 during the subsequent offseason.\n2014.\nBefore the 2014 season, he received an exemption from MLB to use Adderall, an exemption given to nine percent of MLB players despite only four percent of the American population diagnosed with the condition. After a slow start, Ruiz earned NL player of the week accolades in late April after he hit .500 during a Phillies' road trip. He sustained a concussion on June 26 that forced him to go on the disabled list; he began a rehabilitation assignment on July 17 with the Clearwater Threshers. On September 1, Ruiz was behind the plate for the combined no-hitter thrown by Cole Hamels, Jake Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon in a 7–0 victory over the Atlanta Braves. In 2014, Ruiz played 110 games batting .252 with six home runs and 31 RBI, and overall, had \"a fine season ... [that] shouldn't get lost amid the many negatives.\" On October 1, 2014, Ruiz underwent a minor arthroscopic shoulder surgery.\n2015.\nCognizant of his increasing age and the wear catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping to keep him fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop a feel and rapport with each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects of his game, particularly those at which he previously excelled, including framing pitches – in 2015, \"Baseball Prospectus\" ranked him worst in the league at doing so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Phillies traded Ruiz to the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 25, 2016, with cash considerations, for A. J. Ellis, Tommy Bergjans, and a player to be named later. The player to be named later turned out to be Joey Curletta. He backed up Yasmani Grandal with the Dodgers in September, appearing in 14 games and hitting .278. He was also two for four as a pinch hitter, with a two-run home run in the 2016 National League Division Series.\nSeattle Mariners.\nFollowing the 2016 season, Ruiz was traded to the Mariners for pitcher Vidal Nuño. In a game against the Minnesota Twins, Ruiz pitched in the 8th inning, giving up one run and striking out Kennys Vargas for Ruiz's first career strikeout. On a July 7 game against the Oakland Athletics, while in the bullpen, he caught Nelson Cruz's 300th home run. On November 2, 2017, Ruiz elected free agency.\nPlayer profile.\nBatting.\nOffensively, Ruiz developed from a \"bottom-of-the-order hitter\", to a patient hitter inclined to work the count, and finally to a hitter with solid gap-to-gap power. Ruiz has strong plate discipline that helps him draw walks and avoid strikeouts; he has almost as many walks as strikeouts over the course of his career, a rarity in the modern era of baseball. However, as his career progressed and he hit more towards the middle of the lineup, he has taken a more aggressive approach at the plate, and consequently he has struck out more often, but his home run totals have also increased. In 2014, his versatility and production at the plate encouraged his manager, Ryne Sandberg, to utilize him in various spots ranging from second through seventh in the batting order. At the prime of his career, he was among the best hitting catchers in MLB. Entering 2014, Ruiz had stolen only 16 bases over his first eight seasons; he had never been particularly fast, which initially caused his conversion from infielder to catcher, but because of his \"hustle\" on the basepaths, he won the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association Heart and Hustle Award in 2012.\nCatching.\nWhen catching, Ruiz seeks to become \"one\" with the day's pitcher; he takes their successes and failures personally, refusing to blame pitchers, and accepts equal responsibility. Phillies pitchers trust Ruiz and his ability to call games, and this ability's improvement has coincided with his increased proficiency in English. Cole Hamels attributes Ruiz's prowess in calling games to astute preparation, commenting,\nRuiz realizes the importance of his role with the Phillies, opining, \"It's the catcher's job to bring energy and happiness to the game.\" Ruiz has a good throwing arm that has improved over the years; over the course of his career he has thrown out 29% of attempted base stealers, which is exactly the average percentage of baserunners thrown out by catchers.\nPlaying style.\nA \"Sports Illustrated\" piece featuring Ruiz published in July 2011 encapsulated Ruiz's role as \"heart and soul\" of the team:\nHe is a favorite among Phillies fans, and crossed \"a cultural moat that Hispanic players often can't\" to endear himself to not only the fan base, but also his teammates. Before games, he humorously imitates teammates to help keep the team loose and relaxed, furthering his role as a leader. Overall, Ruiz \"is a man who refuses to conceal his emotions\", positive or negative, and serves as a constant source of encouragement and rebuke alike to his teammates.\nNo-Hitters caught.\nIn 2015, Ruiz tied Jason Varitek for the major-league record of most no-hitters caught, with four. Ruiz was also the first catcher since 1972 to catch two no-hitters in the same season and the first to catch a perfect game and a no-hitter in the same season. The no-hitters caught by Ruiz all came during his tenure with the Phillies:"

        "text": "The 1990 World Snooker Championship (also referred to as the 1990 Embassy World Snooker Championship for the purposes of sponsorship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place between 13 and 29 April 1990 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. It was the ninth and final world ranking tournament of the 1989–90 snooker season following the European Open. Featuring a total prize fund of £620,000, the winner received £120,000; and was sponsored by cigarette manufacturer Embassy.\nThe defending champion was Steve Davis, who won the previous year's final 18–3 over John Parrott. Davis reached the semi-finals of the event, where he was defeated 14-16 by Jimmy White. White contested the final against Stephen Hendry who defeated Parrott in the other semi-final 16–11. Hendry led 9–7 after the first day's play and won the first four frames of the second day to lead 13–7, before White reduced the gap to four frames. At 16–12, Hendry compiled breaks of 81 and 71 to win the match 18–12, claiming his first world title. In so doing, he became the youngest-ever world champion at the age of 21 years and 106 days. There was a total of 18 century breaks made during the tournament, the highest of which being a 140 made by Parrott.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual professional snooker tournament organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the cue sport was popular in the British Isles. However, in the modern era, which started in 1969 when the World Championship reverted to a knockout format, it has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nJoe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, hosted by the Billiards Association and Control Council, the final match being held at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The 1990 championship featured 32 professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single-elimination format, each match played over several . These competitors in the main tournament were selected using a combination of the top players in the snooker world rankings and the winners of a pre-tournament qualification stage. The top 16 players in the world rankings automatically qualified for the event, the remaining 16 players coming through the qualification rounds.\nPrize fund.\nThe winner of the event received £120,000 from a total prize fund of £620,000.The breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below: \nTournament summary.\nFinal.\nHendry led 9–7 after the first day. On the second day, he won the first four frames, making a break of 104 in the second, with White failing to pot a ball in three of them. From 7–13, White took the 21st frame with a break of 82, and added the following frame to reduce his deficit to 9–13. In the 23rd frame, White led by 63 points before Hendry produced a clearance of 72 to win on the black ball. The session finished with Hendry 14–10 ahead after White won the session's last frame with breaks of 51 and 45. The first three frames of the fourth session were completed in 27 minutes, and included a 108 clearance by Hendry. White took the following frame, before breaks of 71 and 81 secured a first world championship title for Hendry. He became the youngest-ever world champion at the age of 21 years and 106 days, overtaking Alex Higgins, who had won the 1972 World Snooker Championship a few days before his 23rd birthday.\nHendry commented after his win that \"I was determined to win and confident that I could do it. I was glad I was able to keep my concentration and cope with the pressure. All through the match I was nervous. My stomach was churning tonight.\" White said that he was disappointed with the standard of his own safety play during the match, and added \"I'm a little bit sick but I can honestly say I enjoyed the game. In a way I'm pleased for Stephen. He's a great kid and he puts in enough work to be world champion. He played tremendous snooker. You could count his misses on one hand.\" Hendry went on to win six more world titles, including further victories over White in the 1992, 1993 and 1994 finals.\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for each round. The numbers in parentheses beside some of the players are their seeding ranks (each championship has 16 seeds and 16 qualifiers).\nQualifying.\nPlayers in bold denote match winners.\nCentury breaks.\nThere were 18 century breaks in the championship.

Gymnast's scores in these performances counted for all of the events, except the separate \"team exercise with portable apparatus\" event (also known as \"group exercise with hand apparatus\" event), which was a group rhythmic exercises similar to the \"group competition\" event in rhythmic gymnastics. Scores of gymnasts from incomplete teams counted only for individual events.\nThe scoring in the team competition was different from the one at the previous Olympics, its principle became the same, as for men's events: five best scores constituted the team's score for the routine; these scores constituted the overall team's totals."

Nine rowers from six nations competed. The host nation, Great Britain, earned the top two spots with Harry Blackstaffe taking gold and Alexander McCulloch silver. It was the first victory in the event for Great Britain, which had taken bronze in 1900. The two bronze medals went to semifinalists Bernhard von Gaza of Germany and Károly Levitzky of Hungary, both nations making their debut in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nFor the first time, there was a strong international field. The Diamond Challenge Sculls winners competing were Lou Scholes of Great Britain (1904), Harry Blackstaffe of Great Britain (1906), and Alexander McCulloch of Canada (1908). Great Britain had another strong sculler in London for the Games in Frederick Septimus Kelly (1902, 1903, and 1905 Diamond champion), but he had retired from sculling and competed in the eight instead; only two of the British rowers would have been able to compete under the 1908 national limits in any case. Prominent American sculler Frank Greer, the reigning Olympic champion, did not compete.\nBelgium, Canada, Germany, Hungary, and Italy each made their debut in the event.

It covers the disciplines of road, track, mountain bike, cyclo-cross, and BMX across all ages and ability levels. In 2015, USAC had a membership of 61,631 individual members.\nUSA Cycling is associated with the UCI or, Union Cyclist Internationale, which governs international cycling, and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC). The organization is also a member of the continental body Confederacion Panamericana de Ciclismo (COPACI). USA Cycling also organizes the USA Cycling Pro Road Tour, the top road cycling series for men and women in the United States.\nHistory.\nThe Amateur Bicycle League of America was organized in 1920 and incorporated in New York in 1921. In 1975, the name was changed to the United States Cycling Federation. In 1995, USA Cycling, Inc. was incorporated in Colorado, and in 1995, the two corporations merged, with USA Cycling serving as the umbrella corporation. The National Off Road Bicycle Association, once an independent governing body of mountain bike racing in the US, is now the mountain bike racing division of USA Cycling (USAC).\nThe office of USA Cycling, Inc. remained on the United States Olympic Training Center campus near downtown Colorado Springs until March 2009. Thanks to the generous support of Nor’wood Development group and the El Pomar Foundation combined with the collective efforts of the City of Colorado Springs and several local organizations, including the Colorado Springs Economic Development Corporation, and the Colorado Springs Sports Corporation, the national governing body was able to secure office space on the city's north side. USA Cycling's new headquarters now consists of a 26,000-square-foot building on nearly two acres of land near I-25 on the northwest side of Colorado Springs.\nIn September 2023, the US Center for SafeSport permanently banned Kevin ‘Scott’ Morris, a former contractor and director for the USA CRITS series, from participation in activities and competitions with USA Cycling, for “criminal disposition - involving a minor” and “criminal disposition - sexual misconduct”.\nOrganization.\nUSA Cycling is the official governing body for all disciplines of competitive cycling in the United States, including road, track, mountain bike, BMX, and cyclo-cross. The organization has a two-part mission: To achieve sustained success in international cycling competition and to grow competitive cycling in America.\nThe mountain bike racing division of USA Cycling was formerly known as NORBA, the National Off Road Bicycle Association.\nAs a membership-based organization, USA Cycling comprises 2,700 clubs and teams as of 2013; and nearly 70,000 licensees which include officials, coaches, mechanics, and competitive cyclists of all ages and abilities across all five disciplines of the sport.\nLocal associations.\nIn an effort to grow the sport domestically, USA Cycling supports grass-roots initiatives through its 31 local associations (LA). Each year, USA Cycling reinvests much of its membership dollars back into these local programs, having distributed over $3.8 million since 2003.\nLocal and national events.\nEach year, USA Cycling sanctions over 2,900 events across the U.S. Additionally, the organization administers eight national-level calendars and manages 18 national championship events for all ages and skill levels in several disciplines: road, track, mountain bike, cyclo-cross, BMX and para-cycling.\nA decade of growth.\nUSA Cycling has seen steady growth over the last decade as participation in cycling has continued to grow across the nation and within the organization. The organization's 69,771 licensees in 2010 represent a 63% increase from the 42,724 licensees in 2002. In 2013, the number of licenses grew to over 75,000.\nUSA Cycling maintains development programs for men and women in all disciplines of competitive cycling, providing a structured pathway to the top tier of the sport. In 2010, over a hundred individual riders took part in USA Cycling's National Development Program, gaining valuable race experience through 2,600 fully supported race days.\nRegional and national development camps.\nServing as entry points into USA Cycling's National Development Program pathway, the Regional and National Development Camps aim to identify talent and, in some cases, name riders to USA Cycling rosters for major international competitions.\nInternational race camps.\nUSA Cycling takes dozens of juniors on international racing trips each year. These riders gain race experience at the world's top junior events, including Junior Paris-Roubaix and the Tour de L’Abitibi, where major wins were made in 2013.\nEuropean resident programs.\nNearly 200 American cyclists live and train out of USA Cycling's houses in Belgium, Italy, and Germany each season. This allows them to be fully immersed in European race culture—a necessary element for advancing to the top tier of professional cycling.\nRacing levels.\nUSA Cycling racing levels are called categories, sometimes referred to as \"cats\". The lowest category for road, track, and cyclocross racing is 5 for men and women. The lowest category for mountain bike racing is 3 for both sexes. Decreasing categories represent higher ability levels with category 1 being the immediate step below professional level.\nAdvancement.\nAdvancement to higher categories is based on experience, as shown below."

        "text": "Thomas P. Brown Jr. (September 26, 1922 – October 27, 2011) was one of the top amateur tennis players in the world in the 1940s and a consistent winner in veterans' and seniors' competitions. He was the son of Thomas P. Brown, a newspaper correspondent, later public relations director for a railroad, and Hilda Jane Fisher, who became a schoolteacher when Tom was a boy. Though born in Washington, D.C., Tom was considered a San Franciscan all his life, having been brought west by his parents (both Californians) at the age of two.\nBiography.\nTom Brown Jr. got his start playing tennis at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park where on weekends his parents played, and Tom tagged along. He quickly became intrigued with the sport, was soon beating his parents and winning citywide children's championships. He was captain of the tennis teams at both Lowell High School and the University of California-Berkeley.\nFor one for whom tennis was never the main event in life, he had a successful record in the sport, before devoting himself to a law practice and raising a family. At his best he had wins over top players of his era. As Private First Class Brown won the singles title of the prestigious Pacific Coast Championships in October 1945, the second oldest tennis tournament in the U.S. Brown won it four times, twice in singles, twice in doubles. Then, fresh out of the Army after World War II, he reached the 1946 Wimbledon semifinals, in which he led that year's eventual champion, France's Yvon Petra, by two sets before losing.\nIn demand as a doubles partner among the world's best, both men and women, Brown, with Jack Kramer, won the 1946 Wimbledon doubles against Australia's Geoff Brown and Dinny Pails. He also won its mixed doubles, teamed with Louise Brough, against Dorothy (Dodo) Bundy and Geoff Brown. The same year, at the French, he played the mixed finals with \"Dodo\" and reached the semis of the singles (losing to Jaroslav Drobny). At the U.S. Nationals, he reached the singles finals by defeating Fred Kovaleski, Tom Falkenburg, Bitsy Grant, Herbie Flam, Frank Parker and Gardnar Mulloy, then he was defeated by Kramer.\nAt the Australian championships in 1947, Brown beat Adrian Quist, then lost to Dinny Pails in the semifinals. In the Wimbledon singles in 1947, Brown beat defending champion Petra and future champion Budge Patty, then lost easily to Kramer in the final. At the French (held after Wimbledon for the last time), he lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Jozsef Asboth, and he was in the doubles finals with Billy Sidwell of Australia.\nIn 1948 at Wimbledon, he teamed with Gardnar Mulloy, losing the doubles final to the Australian duo John Bromwich and Frank Sedgman. Brown also took the U.S. mixed doubles title with his favorite partner, Louise Brough.\nIt was 16 years before he gave Wimbledon another shot. In both 1964 and 1965. he was put out in the second round of the singles; in 1965 by John Newcombe who, several years later, became a three-time Wimbledon champion. He played doubles those years with (respectively) Hugh Stewart and Gene Scott. Both were first-round losses.\nKramer wrote in his 1979 autobiography \"The Game, My 40 Years in Tennis\" that Brown \"was known as 'The Frisco Flailer' (we had nicknames like that in those days), and he was strong off the ground with an excellent running forehand, but he was always my pigeon.\" Kramer was the only player who \"owned\" Brown, beating him nine straight matches without the loss of a set.\nBrown was also on three U.S. Davis Cup teams, and in 1950, against Australia, playing his second challenge round singles, he won the U.S.'s only point in five hard-fought sets, defeating Ken McGregor, who became the 1951 Wimbledon singles finalist and the 1952 Australian singles champion. \nBrown had a lifelong passion for travel, a wanderlust he said he acquired as a two-year-old when he and his mother took a train ride out west from Washington, D.C. to Merced, California to join his father. The family then settled in San Francisco. During his law-practice years, whenever he got the chance to travel to a tennis tournament he took it, and well into his 30s, he was beating the world's top amateur competition. During and well beyond his active playing career, Brown was ranked in the U.S. top 10 eight times between 1946 and 1958, reaching as high as No. 3 in 1946. He was ranked World No. 7 for 1946 by Pierre Gillou and for 1947 by both John Olliff and Harry Hopman.\nAt ages 47 and 48, Brown won the National Men's 45-and-over hard court singles. He also took the U.S. National doubles 45-and-over three times, once with Art Larsen and twice with Tony Trabert. Upon retirement from his law practice, he fully embraced senior tennis, and at the age of 65 in 1987, won the USTA National Grand Slam in the 65-and-over singles, triumphing on hard, clay, grass and indoor surfaces, an almost unique accomplishment in the annals of U.S. veterans’ tennis. In 1988, the International Tennis Federation named him Outstanding Veterans Player in the world.\nBrown won numerous national titles as a senior player: 24 singles and 11 doubles, pairing with Bobby Riggs three times and Fred Kovaleski eight times. Brown's last national title was in 1998. In 2007 he published his memoirs titled \"As Tom Goes By\".\nTom Brown died in Castro Valley, California on October 27, 2011, aged 89."

        "text": "Ronald Dean Robinson (born March 24, 1962) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. A right-hander, he played all or part of nine seasons in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds (1984–90) and the Milwaukee Brewers (1990–92). Robinson is married to high school sweetheart Becky Robinson. They have three children, Ronnie, Ryan and Megan.\nEarly career.\nRobinson was drafted by the Reds out of Woodlake High School in Woodlake, California, with their first-round pick (19th overall) in the 1980 amateur draft. He spent the next four years moving through the Reds' farm system before making his major league debut on August 14, 1984.\nMajor league career.\nReds.\nAlthough he had been almost exclusively a starting pitcher in the minor leagues, his first major league appearance came as a relief pitcher, pitching the final two innings of a game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Four days later, he made his first major league start against the Chicago Cubs, but he recorded just one out while giving up seven runs. However, only one run was earned, as the Reds infield made three errors—two by shortstop Tom Foley -- behind him.\nAfter being sent back to the bullpen for several games, Robinson got another chance at starting on September 2 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. This time, he was much more successful, as he recorded a complete game, giving up just seven hits to gain his first major league win, 7–1. He threw seven shutout innings in his next start, but left with the game still scoreless and did not get the win as the Reds won 1–0. He started three more games, finishing the season with a record of 1–2.\nRobinson started the 1985 season back in the minor leagues with the Triple-A Denver Zephyrs. He was recalled in mid-May, and worked the rest of the season as a swingman, starting 12 games and relieving in 21.\nIn 1986, Robinson, who was nicknamed \"The True Creature\" by then-Reds manager Pete Rose, worked solely in relief, appearing in 70 games, going 10–3 with a 3.24 earned run average (ERA) and 14 saves. In 1987, he returned to the swingman role.\nOne of Robinson's most memorable starts came on May 2, 1988, when he came within one strike of throwing a perfect game against the Montreal Expos. With a single, Montreal's Wallace Johnson broke up what would have been the first perfect game in Reds history. According to teammate Tom Browning, Robinson was pitching with pain in his elbow so severe that he could not pick up a ball from the ground without squatting down to pick it up. Browning would throw the Reds' first perfect game four months later.\nRobinson missed large chunks of both 1988 and 1989 due to injuries. After starting the 1990 season 2–2 with a 4.88 ERA in six games, the Reds traded him along with Bob Sebra to the Brewers for Glenn Braggs and Billy Bates on June 9, 1990. The trade helped propel the Reds to win the 1990 World Series.\nBrewers.\nThe season also wound up being a good one for Robinson, at least statistically. Between his stints with the Reds and the Brewers, Robinson set career highs in wins and innings pitched, while recording seven of his eight career complete games, including his only two major league shutouts. Overall, Robinson went 14–7 with a 3.26 ERA.\nIn 1991, Robinson started the third game of the season on April 11, pitching 4.1 innings, but in the process he suffered an elbow injury that cost him the rest of the season. He tried to come back in 1992, but pitched in just eight games for the Brewers before being forced to retire at age 30.\nCareer overview.\nRobinson posted a career win–loss record of 48–39 with a 3.63 ERA and 19 saves in 232 games, 102 starts and 800 innings pitched."

        "text": "Boxing has been contested at every Summer Olympic Games since its introduction to the program at the 1904 Summer Olympics, except for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, because Swedish law banned the sport at the time. The 2008 Summer Olympics were the final games with boxing as a male only event. Since the 2012 Summer Olympics, women's boxing is part of the program.\nHistory.\nBoxing made its first appearance at the 1904 Summer Olympics as a men's event. Due to few competitors at the time, only North American boxers competed for this edition. Since the 1908 Olympics, boxing has been contested at every Summer Olympic Games besides the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, because Swedish law banned the martial arts at the time.\nUntil 1948, losing semi-finalists competed in a match for a bronze medal. However, in 1950 the International Boxing Association (IBA) decided to discontinue the bronze medal match as the short time interval between the semi-finals and the third-place match allowed limited time for competitors to recover. In 1970, the IBA proposed for both losing semi-finalists to receive a bronze medals, which was accepted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and implemented since the 1972 Summer Olympics. Losing semi-finalists from 1952 to 1968 were also retroactively awarded bronze medals after initially only receiving Olympic diplomas.\nAt the 2012 Summer Olympics, women's boxing events were added to the programme for the first time.\nIn 2016, the IBA allowed professional boxers to compete in Olympic events, previously being limited to amateur or state-funded boxers, for the first time.\nEvents.\nThe boxing competition is organized as a set of tournaments, one for each weight class. The number of weight classes has changed over the years (currently 7 for men and 6 for women), and the definition of each class has changed several times, as shown in the following table. Until 1936, weights were measured in pounds, and from 1948 onwards, weights were measured in kilograms.\nOn March 23, 2013, the International Boxing Association instituted significant changes to the format. The World Series of Boxing, AIBA's pro team league which started in 2010, already enabled team members to retain 2012 Olympic eligibility. The newer AIBA Pro Boxing Tournament, consisting of boxers who sign 5-year contracts with AIBA and compete on pro cards leading up to the tournament, also provides a pathway for new pros to retain their Olympic eligibility and retain ties with national committees.\nFrom the 2016 Summer Olympics, male athletes no longer have to wear protective headgear in competition, due to a ruling by the AIBA and the IOC that it contributes to greater concussion risk. Female athletes will continue to wear the headgear, due to \"lack of data\" on the effectiveness of it on women. Also from 2016 onwards, the \"10-point must\" scoring system was used.\nMedal table.\nThe following table is ranked by the number of golds, then silvers, then bronzes. Until 1948, losing semi-finalists held a bronze medal playoff; since 1952, both losing semi-finalists have received bronze medals."

Rugby union in Belgium is administered by the Belgian Rugby Federation.\nHistory.\nThe Belgium rugby team played their first match on 13 March 1932 against the Netherlands. They contested annual games against the Netherlands for half a decade starting in 1932. They drew the 1932 game, but lost subsequent matches during the 1930s.

They managed to obtain a draw in the 1960s against Portugal. In the 1970s they won the majority of their games, as well as playing a broader range of European nations. This trend continued throughout the 1980s. Belgium had a six-game winning streak in the late 1980s. They began playing more games against their regular European opponents as they entered the 1990s.

        "text": "The men's individual all-around, also known as the \"heptathlon\", was one of two gymnastics events on the Gymnastics at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme. As suggested by the alternate name, the competition included seven events with the scores summed to give a final score. Each nation could enter up to 20 gymnasts, with France and Great Britain each entering the maximum. A total of 97 gymnasts from 12 nations competed. The event was won by Alberto Braglia of Italy, the nation's first medal in the men's individual all-around. Silver went to Walter Tysall of Great Britain, the first medal for the nation as well. France's Louis Ségura earned bronze.\nUnlike in 1904, the results for the individual all-around were \"not\" used for the men's team event in 1908.\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nOne of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1904 Games returned: silver medalist Wilhelm Weber of Germany. The reigning (1907) World Champion was Josef Čada of Bohemia.\nCanada, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Turkey each made their debut in the event. Germany made its third appearance, the only nation to have competed at all editions of the event to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe events were:\nWith the exception of rope climbing, each competitor had a maximum of 2 minutes in each event (with a one-point penalty for exceeding the limit). Horizontal bars were set at heights of 250 cm and 220 cm; parallel bars were set at heights of 160 cm and 148 cm; rings were adjustable in 10 cm increments from 180 cm to 250 cm. The rope, which was 5 cm in diameter, had a top mark at 720 cm and marks below that every 45 cm down to 180 cm.\nOther than for rope climbing, each gymnast performed one \"voluntary\" exercise on each apparatus, with a maximum score of 24 points from each of the 3 judges. Thus, there was a maximum of 72 points per exercise or 432 points from the six non-rope climbing exercises. Points were awarded for \"(a) successful performance of exercise attempted; (b) difficulty and combination of movements; (c) style and sequence; (d) variety of movements.\"\nThe rope climbing competition required gymnasts to climb hand-over-hand, with legs together and clear of the rope. Gymnasts had to climb in continuous motion; the judging ended when motion ceased to be continuous. The gymnast earned point for every 18 inches climbed.\nResults.\nThe Official Report gives the places and scores of the first 19. A full list of results was printed in a French journal in August 1908, but was not discovered until March 2020."

Along with coach Brian Smith, Deakin helped revolutionise the club's image ahead of the inaugural Super League season. As a result, crowds at Odsal Stadium rose sharply; the club's average crowd was over 10,000 in 1996, and by the end of the club's second season in Super League in 1997, the average attendance was over 15,000.\nFollowing this success, Saracens owner Nigel Wray lured him to Watford, where he delivered five-figure crowds for Premiership club Saracens, including the then record 19,000 crowd at Saracens Watford home.\nHis love of Rugby League proved too great, however, and he leapt at the chance to take over at Warrington Wolves. However, he felt there were those at Wilderspool who did not share his vision, and after securing the Community Stadium (now renamed Halliwell Jones Stadium), he left.\nAfter a short tenure he bought into the vision of Sale Sharks' owner Brian Kennedy and started the processes which eventually led to Sale Sharks crowds of over 10,000, and the Guinness Premiership victory in 2006.

        "text": "The general classification in the Giro d'Italia is the most important classification of the Giro d'Italia, which determines who is the overall winner. It is therefore considered more important than secondary classifications as the points classification or the mountains classification.\nSince 1931, the leader of the general classification is identified by a pink jersey ( ). Prior to that year and since the creation of the race, no colour was used to distinguish the winner at the top of the classification. The first rider to wear the maglia rosa was Learco Guerra following the first stage of the 1931 Giro d'Italia. The first jersey was entirely pink and made from wool. It had a roll-neck collar and front pockets. As Italy was under Fascist Party rule there was a gray shield stitched onto the shirt, a symbol for the party. This initial jersey and many of the first pink jerseys were designed by Vittore Gianni who had created jerseys for AC Milan and Juventus. Castelli has made the pink jerseys from 1981 to being worn by Miguel Indurain last in 1992. In 2018 they resigned a four agreement to be the sponsor if the jersey again. Since 2000, the pink jersey has been altered between years from being exclusively solid pink, like in 2006 there was a bike pattern on the jersey in a darker shade of pink. To celebrate the 2009 Giro d'Italia which was on the 100th anniversary of the race's beginning in 1909, the jersey had side panels displaying the Italian colors of green, white, and red and was designed by Dolce and Gabbana. Other designers that have designed a maglia rosa include Paul Smith and Fergus Niland, the latter of which made all the classification jerseys have a shamrock pattern while the 2014 race raced throughout Ireland.\nIn the first editions of the Giro d'Italia, a points system was used for the calculation of the general classification, but since 1914 a time system is used. All stage results are added together, taking into account time bonuses for high finishes and intermediate sprints, and time penalties for breaking the rules.\nThe color pink was chosen because \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\", the sports newspaper that created the Giro, was printed on pink paper. In comparison, the leader of the general classification in the Tour de France is awarded a yellow jersey, which originally corresponds with the yellow newsprint of \"L'Auto\", the newspaper that created the Tour de France."

        "text": "The Thailand national cricket team is the team that represents Thailand in international cricket. The team is organised by the Cricket Association of Thailand, which has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2005, having been an affiliate member between 1995 and 2005. Almost all of Thailand's matches have come against other Asian teams, including in several Asian Cricket Council tournaments.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nCricket was introduced to Thailand by the children of elite Thai families who learnt the game during education in England. They founded the Bangkok City Cricket Club in 1890, and the side played its first game in November of that year. An invitation to come to the city was sent to the Singapore Cricket Club, but it was turned down due to the fear of a cholera epidemic.\nCricket in the Thai community failed to develop however, and by the early-1900s the game was confined almost entirely to expatriate residents. The Royal Bangkok Sports Club began to play cricket in 1905 and they were instrumental in arranging the first international in January 1909, when Siam beat the Straits Settlements by an innings in Singapore. Siam won the return match in Bangkok the following year, and the Straits Settlements won the third and final match in December 1911.\nCricket remained a recreational activity, with a national side not surfacing again until 1990. Various sides came to play the Royal Bangkok Sports Club in the 1960s and 1970s, including Worcestershire in 1965 and the MCC in 1970. This encouraged the development of more cricket facilities.\nModern era.\nOne player based in Thailand in the late-1980s and early-1990s was Ronald Endley, who worked for Volvo and persuaded the company to offer a trophy for a match against Hong Kong. This match was played in January 1990 and took the form of a two-day match, which was drawn. It became a one-day match in 1991, and 1992 saw Malaysia join in for a tri-series. The tournament was superseded by the Tuanku Ja'afar Cup, which involved all three teams along with Singapore.\nThe early-1990s were one of the most successful periods for Thai cricket, but tight ICC player eligibility rules came into force when they became an ICC affiliate member in 1995, which led to them being forced to field weaker teams. This coincided with financial problems, causing Thailand to pull out of tournaments. In contrast, the early part of the 21st century has seen youth cricket take priority in addition to much more being done to promote the game beyond the expatriate population.\nIn August 2017, Thailand won the bronze medal in the 50-over tournament in cricket at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. They placed fourth in the 20-over tournament, losing to Indonesia. \n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC granted full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. All Twenty20 matches played between Thailand and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 are a full T20I. \nThailand played their first T20I on 24 June against Malaysia during the 2019 Malaysia Tri-Nation Series.\nTournament history.\nACC Trophy.\nACC Trophy Challenge\nThailand hosted the 2009, 2010 and 2012 ACC Trophy Challenge, the second tier of the limited-overs competition for non-Test-playing ACC members.\nThailand has not participated in the ACC Premier League.\nCurrent squad.\nThis lists all the players who were named in the most recent squad. \nUpdated as of 16 February 2024.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Thailand\n\"Last updated 1 May 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2584.

It is administered by the Zambia Cricket Union, which became an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2003. The team made its international debut in 1930, during the country's colonial period as Northern Rhodesia.\nRegular matches against other East African sides began in the 1950s, and Zambia contributed players to the combined East African cricket team that was an ICC member in its own right for much of the remainder of the 20th century (later transformed into the East and Central Africa Cricket Conference).\nFrom the late 1990s onward, Zambia has been a regular participant in ICC Africa tournaments, although it has generally played in the lower divisions. The team has been promoted into the World Cricket League structure only once, placing fourth at the 2010 Division Eight tournament.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Zambia and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 were eligible to have full T20I status. ICC terminated Zambia's membership due to \"continued non-compliance\" to amend multiple breaches of the ICC's Membership Criteria in 2021 ICC AGM.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nThen Northern Rhodesia, cricket was introduced into Zambia from neighbouring Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia), in the early 1900s. With the number of the British settlers relatively low compared to Southern Rhodesia, cricket was slow to develop.\nDespite the slow rate of development, the MCC travelled to Livingstone in December 1930 during their tour of South Africa, easily beating Northern Rhodesia by 9 wickets in their first international. By the late 1930s, cricket in Northern Rhodesia was being integrated with cricket in Southern Rhodesia, though it was rare to see players from the North playing for Rhodesia.\nFirst formal organisation.\nAfter World War II, cricket was more formally organised with the formation of the Northern Rhodesia Cricket Union, and in 1948 an annual series of matches was begun against Southern Rhodesia. This lasted only until 1954 as the Southern Rhodesia side were much too strong to make any sort of decent contest. The North won only once, in 1952. One match was drawn and the other five all went the way of the South.\nWith the formation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1954, cricket was fully integrated with Southern Rhodesia but investment was concentrated around Harare and Bulawayo, meaning that cricket began to decline in the country. Nevertheless, a team was still organised to play Australia in October 1957 to start off the Australians tour of South Africa. Australia scored 302/6 declared in their innings and Richie Benaud took 9/16 as the home team were dismissed for 85 in their first innings, but they managed to hold out for a draw in the two-day match.\nNo further matches were played by Northern Rhodesia, but Rhodesia did play two first-class matches at Ek Park, Kitwe in 1962, one against an International XI and one against a Commonwealth XI.\nZambia starts play.\nWith Zambia gaining independence in 1964, cricket began a resurgence. Whereas previously representative cricket had been confined to the white population due to Rhodesian cricket's links with apartheid South Africa, this separation meant the non-white population was now allowed to take part.\nThe Zambian Cricket Union was formed almost immediately and multi-racial cricket began. Zambia took part in East African regional tournaments with Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda in 1968, playing their first match as Zambia against Kenya in Nairobi in September 1968. For instance, the 1975 Quadrangular was played in Kampala, sadly with rain spoiling much of the schedule, the scorecard from Zambia v Kenya 1975 and the Zambian team photograph from that tour to Uganda.\nThe 1970s were the most successful period for Zambian cricket, as the country became a favoured destination for English sides. Gloucestershire toured in 1971, Glamorgan in 1972, the MCC in 1974 and Warwickshire in 1977. \nHowever, in the early 1980s the government began to invest less money in sport and with athletics and soccer being of more interest, cricket was a lower priority. A combined Minor Counties side toured in 1982, but this was the last match played by the national side until the mid-1990s, though some Zambian players played as part of the East African cricket team and East and Central African cricket team.\nModern era.\nBy the mid-1990s, cricket was confined almost entirely to Lusaka, but the national side returned to play in the African Cricket Association Championships in 1994. Zambia took part in the Africa Cup in 2002, beating Namibia and Tanzania and the Zambian Cricket Union became an associate member of the ICC in 2003, enabling the national side to take part in ICC tournaments for the first time.\nZambia hosted the African Cricket Association Championship in 2004, the tournament being part of the qualification process for the 2005 ICC Trophy in Ireland. Zambia finished third behind Namibia and Uganda, qualifying them for the repêchage tournament. This tournament took place in Kuala Lumpur in February 2005 and Zambia finished eighth and last after losing to Italy in the seventh place play-off.\nZambia finished fourth in the World Cricket League Africa Region Division Two tournament in 2006, beating only Nigeria and did better in the same tournament in 2008 when they finished third behind Botswana and Nigeria. In 2010, they went better once again, winning the tournament. This then granted them entry into the 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Eight.\nRecords.\nOne-day.\nBelow is a record of international matches played in the one-day format by Zambia between 2004 and 2017.\nNotable players.\nThe following players played for Northern Rhodesia/Zambia and also played representative cricket including first-class, List A cricket or minor counties:"

        "title": "Ralph Young (baseball)",
        "text": "Ralph Stuart Young (September 19, 1888 – January 24, 1965), commonly known as \"Pep\", was an American professional baseball player and coach.\nA native of Philadelphia, Young played nine seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), principally as a second baseman, from 1913 to 1922, including nine seasons in Major League Baseball with the New York Yankees in 1913, the Detroit Tigers from 1915 to 1921, and the Philadelphia Athletics in 1922. He threw right-handed and batted as a switch hitter. Over the course of Young's big league career, he appeared in 1,022 games, 993 as a second baseman, and compiled a .247 batting average. Fueled by a disciplined batting eye, Young's on-base percentage was nearly 100 points higher at .339. He collected 495 bases on balls and struck out only 235 times in 4,342 plate appearances. Young was also known as one of the best defensive second baseman in the American League (AL) during his playing career until a back injury in 1921 led to erratic throwing.\nAfter Young's playing career ended, he served as a college baseball coach in Philadelphia for the Temple Owls baseball team from 1932 to 1942 and for the Saint Joseph's Hawks baseball team from 1948 to 1955. In 19 seasons as a head coach, Young compiled a 158–154 win–loss record.\nEarly years.\nYoung was born in 1888 in Philadelphia. His father operated a grocery store in Philadelphia. He attended Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland. \nProfessional baseball.\nMinor leagues.\nYoung began playing professional baseball in 1910 and 1911 with the Scranton Miners. He continued to play in the minor leagues with the Steubenville Stubs in 1911 and the Harrisburg Senators in 1911 and 1912. In 1912, he drew attention after he compiled a .308 batting average in 357 at bats, scored 79 runs, stole 31 bases, and in 80 games at shortstop garnered 284 assists and 165 putouts with a .941 fielding percentage.\nWhile playing in the minors, he earned the nickname \"Pep\". According to a 1913 newspaper account: \"He is the sort of player much sought by the big leaguers. One who is on his toes all the time, chock full of life and ginger. It was his great display of energy in the minors that earned him the nickname of 'Pep.'\" Former major league shortstop and manager Arthur Irwin called Young as promising a young shortstop as he ever saw.\nNew York Yankees.\nIn January 1913, Young signed with the New York Yankees. He appeared in his first major league game on April 10, 1913. He appeared in only seven games for the Yankees, all as the team's starting shortstop, compiled a .067 batting average in 15 at bats, and committed five errors. Roger Peckinpaugh won the job as the Yankees' regular shortstop, and on April 27, 1913, the Yankees released Young to the Sacramento Sacts of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). \nSacramento Sacts.\nYoung appeared in 160 games for Sacramento in 1913. His father was opposed to Young choosing baseball as a career and offered him a fifty percent stake in the family grocery store if Young would give up baseball at the end of the 1913 season. Young announced his retirement, but changed his mind and returned to Sacramento in 1914. He appeared in 199 games in 1914, and his batting average rose to .275. In September 1914, pitcher John Birdie Williams said of Young: \"Pep Young is the best infielder on the coast today. He is a wonderful fielder, a great base runner, a fine man to get passes, and he used to be a fairly good hitter. . . . The best description I can give is that he is a second Donie Bush, and you know what that means.\"\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn August 12, 1914, Young was sold by Sacramento to the Detroit Tigers on the condition he would finish the 1914 season with Sacramento. Young remained as the Tigers' starting second baseman for seven seasons from 1915 to 1921.\nDuring his first year with the Tigers, Young received daily, one-on-one batting instruction from the team's center fielder, Ty Cobb. During the 1915 Tigers season, the club compiled a 100–54 for the second highest winning percentage (.649) in franchise history. Young appeared in 123 games for the 1915 Tigers, including 113 as the team's starting second baseman. He only managed to compile a .243 batting average in 1915, but he demonstrated a sharp batting eye and drew 53 bases on balls to boost his on-base percentage to .339. He led the American League's second basemen with 32 errors, but showed promise in also ranking highly among the league second basemen with 371 assists (fourth), a 5.46 range factor per nine innings (fourth), 233 putouts (fifth), 44 double plays turned (fifth), and a .950 fielding percentage (fifth).\nThroughout his career, Young's offensive contributions were fueled by his discipline as a batter and an ability to collect bases on balls and avoid striking out. At five feet, five inches, Young's small stature assisted in allowing for a correspondingly small strike zone. In 1916, he drew 62 bases on balls for a .342 on-base percentage. In 1918, he actually drew nearly as many walks (54) as hits (56) and struck out only 17 times in 368 plate appearances. Over the course of his career, Young collected 495 bases on balls and struck out only 254 times in 4,341 plate appearances.\nWhether due to the tutelage of Ty Cobb or the arrival of the live-ball era, Young's offensive numbers jumped dramatically in 1920. That year, he had a batting average of .291 (up from .211 the prior year) and an on-base percentage of .406. He had a career highs with 173 hits and 85 walks, with only 30 strikeouts in 705 plate appearances.\nYoung saw his offensive numbers climb further in 1921, as he hit for a career high .299 batting average and a .406 on-base percentage. The 1921 season saw remarkable hitting throughout the Detroit lineup. The 1921 Tigers still hold the American League record for highest single season team batting average at .316. Of the starting position players, only Young and shortstop Donie Bush, who was traded to the Washington Senators in August, failed to break the .300 mark, and Young only missed by one point. But true to the adage that \"good pitching beats good hitting\", the 1921 Tigers lacked strong pitching and finished in sixth place, 27 games behind the Yankees, despite averaging 5.7 runs per game.\nDespite his abilities as a contact hitter, Young's greatest contribution came in his fielding. In eight seasons as a second baseman (1915–1922), Young proved to be a talented fielder. In 1919, Young's range factor rating of 5.70 was 51 points higher than the league average for second basemen. He collected season highs of 405 putouts (1920), 449 assists (1917), and 55 double plays (1916). His 449 assists was tops among American League second basemen in 1917, though he also led the league's second basemen in errors in 1915 and 1918. For his career, he collected 2,411 putouts, 3,009 assists, and 359 double plays.\nYoung was also involved in three triple plays as a second baseman, including one of the most unusual double plays in history. On May 18, 1921, in a game against the Boston Red Sox at home in Detroit, Young started a 4–4–6 double play (i.e., second basemen makes two outs and third basemen makes the final out) – one of only three such plays in MLB history.\nAfter years of reliable defensive play, Young began to have problems with the accuracy of his throws in 1921. One writer noted: \"His arm suddenly went wrong, and try as he might he couldn't make the short toss to first base with any degree of accuracy. Time after time he would make a sensational stop only to follow it with a weird throw to the cushion. His whip seemed to become paralyzed momentarily with the result that batsmen were getting \"lifes\" with what should have been certain outs. Young's trouble was mental, as he could throw with great speed, but no accuracy.\"\nYoung's erratic throwing led to his removal from the lineup in the latter part of the 1921 season. During the off-season, Young stated than an x-ray had revealed that he had been playing with a \"dislocated vertebrae\" for which he was undergoing treatment in Philadelphia.\nPhiladelphia Athletics.\nOn April 3, 1922, the Tigers placed Young on waivers. Ty Cobb said at the time that he doubted whether Young would regain his old form. On April 7, he was claimed off waivers by Connie Mack and the Philadelphia Athletics. This gave Young the opportunity to play for his home town team. Young appeared in 125 games for the 1922 Athletics, including 116 games as the team's starting second baseman. Young's arrival required the Athletics' second baseman, Jimmy Dykes, to move to third base for the 1922 season. Young compiled a .223 batting average and .309 on-base percentage in 1923. Young spent only one season with the Athletics, appearing in his last major league game on September 29, 1922. \nOn February 7, 1923, Young was given an unconditional release by the Athletics. At the time of his release, one writer noted it marked \"the passing of one of the smartest men in the game,\" an individual who \"played 'heads up' baseball, and in his prime was considered one of the best second sackers in the majors.\"\nMinor leagues.\nIn February 1923, Young was offered a contract by the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He declined the offer and retired from professional baseball. He reportedly signed a contract in March 1923 with a club in Chester, Pennsylvania. In a game played on June 30, 1923, Young had five hits for Chester, matching the hit total of the entire opposing team. He was reportedly \"instrumental\" in helping Chester win a pennant in 1923.\nCollege coaching career.\nAfter his career as a professional baseball player, Young coached college baseball in his hometown of Philadelphia. On March 1, 1932, he was hired as the head coach of the Temple Owls baseball team. He remained the head coach at Temple for 11 seasons from 1932 to 1942. He compiled a 110–85 record at Temple. In November 1942, Young was granted a leave of absence from Temple to serve for the duration of World War II as an associate inspector of engineering machinery at a war plant. \nOn March 23, 1948, Young was hired as the head coach of the Saint Joseph's Hawks baseball team. He coached at Saint Joseph's from 1948 to 1955. He compiled a 48–69 record in eight years at Saint Joseph's. He was inducted into the Saint Joseph's University Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000.\nLater years.\nIn January 1965, Young died in Philadelphia after a brief illness at age 76. He was survived by his wife and a daughter."

        "text": "The men's sabre was one of four fencing events on the Fencing at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme. The top two places were won by Hungarian fencers, who also took the gold medal in the team sabre event. Jenő Fuchs took the gold medal and Béla Zulawszky the silver. Bronze went to Bohemian Vilém Goppold von Lobsdorf. There were 76 competitors from 11 nations. Each nation could enter up to 12 fencers. \nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. The 1900 gold medalist, Georges de la Falaise of France, returned after not competing in 1904.\nBelgium, Bohemia, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and South Africa each made their debut in the men's sabre. Austria made its third appearance in the event, most of any nation, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was held over four rounds. In each round, each pool held a round-robin, with bouts to 3 touches. European sabre rules at the time used a target area of the whole body, in contrast to above-the-waist target area provided for by the American rules of the time, used in the 1904 Games, and which became standard after World War I. Barrages were used as necessary to determine the advancing fencers.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe first round was conducted in round-robin format, to three touches. Pool sizes ranged from 4 to 8 fencers. The three contestants who had lost the fewest bouts advanced.\nPool B.\nThe three-way tie for the two remaining places resulted in the British fencer being eliminated.\nPool C.\nRenaud lost both his playoff matches, eliminating him and allowing Grade and Jack to advance.\nPool D.\nThe playoff resulted in two losses for Lichtenfels.\nPool E.\nThe fifth pool was small, with only 4 fencers. This meant only one, Langevin, was eliminated.\nPool F.\nPetri defeated van Tomme in the playoff for third place after having lost to the Belgian in the main pool.\nPool G.\nBadman defeated van Minden again in the playoff for third place.\nPool J.\nThe tenth pool was the largest, at fully twice the size of the fifth. Five of the eight fencers were eliminated. The Bohemian fencer, von Lobsdorf, defeated each of his seven opponents for a decisive first place in the pool. There was no match between Sarzano and Stohr.\nPool L.\nChapuis was eliminated in the three-way playoff for second and third.\nPool M.\nThe final pool was one of the larger pools, with 7 fencers.\nQuarterfinals.\nThere were eight second round pools, ranging in size from 4 to 5.\nQuarterfinal 1.\nNotley's pair of victories in the playoff gave him second in the pool, allowing him to advance.\nQuarterfinal 7.\nDoorman, who had lost to Petri in the main pool, defeated the German in the playoff for second place.\nSemifinals.\nThere were two semifinals, each of 8 fencers. The top 4 in each advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 2.\nFour fencers tied at 5-2 records, all advancing to the finals. Ceccherini gave up after his first four bouts, giving Tóth, van der Voodt, and Doorman wins by walkover.\nFinal.\nFuchs and de Lobsdorf did not finish within the time limit, resulting in a loss for both of them. The playoff match for the gold medal was won by Fuchs, with the one-touch bout decided by a parry and riposte to his fellow Hungarian's head."

        "title": "Northern cricket frog",
        "text": "The northern cricket frog (Acris crepitans) is a species of small hylid frog native to the United States and northeastern Mexico. These frogs are majorly in grey, green, and brown color with blotching patterns. Many have a brown or orange stripe down the center of their back and a triangular marking on the top of their head. Despite being members of the tree frog family, they are not arboreal. These frogs prefer habitats near the edges of slow-moving bodies of water, and in close proximity to shelter items, like rocks. It has two recognized subspecies, \"A. c. crepitans\" and \"A. c. paludicola\".\nDescription.\nThe northern cricket frog is one of the three smallest vertebrates in North America, ranging from long. They have a prominent blunt snot. Its dorsal coloration varies widely, and includes greys, greens, and browns, often in irregular blotching patterns. The dorsal stripes vary in brightness and hue and are not present until metamorphosis occurs. One New York biologist has identified six distinct color morphs and four pattern morphs, and several intergrades between these. Typically there is dark banding on the legs and a white bar from the eye to the base of the foreleg. The skin has a bumpy texture. It is very similar to the southern cricket frog, \"Acris gryllus\", found in the US Southeastern Coastal Plain, but with some overlap along the Fall Line. The southern cricket frog has longer legs, with less webbing on the hind feet, and a more pointed snout, though northern cricket frogs have been observed with snouts indistinguishable from those of the southern species, and the markings on the back of the thigh are typically more sharply defined than that of the northern cricket frog, though biologists have recorded northern cricket frogs in the northern fringes of their range with extremely sharp posterior leg stripes. Northern cricket frogs do not have toe pads. This frog is active throughout most of the year, with activity significantly decreasing during December and resuming around mid-March.\nHabitat and distribution.\nCricket frogs prefer the edges of slow-moving, permanent bodies of water. They prefer open, shallow waters with an abundance of aquatic vegetation. Adults live in temperate environments while tadpoles live in shallow freshwater habitats with varying temperatures. Large groups of them can often be found together along the muddy banks of shallow streams, especially during pre-migratory clustering. The northern cricket frog has been observed to hibernate upland, often at considerable distances from water. Given their small size and their large surface to volume ratio, it comes as no surprise that this species utilize microhabitats. There are various factors that influence microhabitat site selection for this species: temperature, proximity to water, shelter accessibility, etc.\nConservation.\nFrogs such as \"A. crepitans\" are important as an indicator of wetland health and general environmental quality in the areas they inhabit.\nSpeciation.\nThe genus \"Acris\" is composed of two species: \"A. crepitans\" and \"A. gryllus\".\nNorthern vs. southern cricket frog.\nThe southern cricket frog has longer legs, with less webbing on the hind feet, and a more pointed snout, though northern cricket frogs have been observed with snouts indistinguishable from those of the southern species, and the markings on the back of the thigh are typically more sharply defined than that of the northern cricket frog, though biologists have recorded northern cricket frogs in the northern fringes of their range with extremely sharp posterior leg stripes. Compared to its southern counterpart, \"A. Crepitans\" is a stronger swimmer due to having more complete webbing on its feet. Additionally, it is less likely to hop on the water surface than the southern cricket frog. Northern cricket frogs in Mississippi live in open mud flats, call far from shore, and quickly dive into water when disturbed. Southern cricket frogs inhabit low vegetation near shores, call near shore, and escape into vegetation, and quickly return to land when forced into water.\nDiet.\nThe diet of Northern cricket frogs is strongly correlated with what is abundant and available. The most abundant above-ground invertebrates are dipterans, homopterans and spiders. Cricket frogs consume more ground-dwelling prey but such prey account for less volume of food consumed. Bigger frogs consume prey of longer length: less ants, springtails, mites and more leafhoppers, damselflies, butterflies, moths, grasshoppers, crickets. Cricket frogs generally feed little on aquatic species. A study of 279 \"A. crepitan\" stomach contents showed that ground prey composed of 45.6% of prey and 20.7% of the stomach volume, above ground prey composed of 33% prey and 38.7% volume, and aquatic prey composed of 3.2% prey and 5.0% volume, with the remaining being unidentified prey and non-prey items.\nMating.\nBreeding generally occurs from late spring through the summer (May through August). The males call from emergent vegetation with a high-pitched, short, pebble-like call which is repeated at an increasing rate. If there are many males in one particular area, they will modify their calls to increase their chances of getting a mate.\nThe sound suggests pebbles being clicked together, much like a cricket, hence the name. These click-like pulses are combined to form calls, and calls are repeated in call groups. Calls increase in the number of pulses and note duration from beginning to end of a call group.\nOne egg is laid at a time, generally attached to a piece of vegetation. The 14 millimeters (0.55 in) tadpoles hatch in only a few days, and undergo metamorphosis in early fall. Maturity is usually reached in less than a year.\nProduction of male calls.\nAlmost all male frogs have a unique call with the purpose of attracting mates. These calls are defined by unique acoustic characteristics in order to attract female frogs of the same species. In frogs, auditory sounds are produced as a result of the interaction between the structure of the larynx (otherwise known as the voice box), vocal tract, and cartilages that control the flow of air out of lungs. Sound is produced when air hits the vocal cords, causing them to vibrate. The frequency of sound is dictated by the pressure of airflow through the larynx, as well as characteristics of vocal cords such as size and mass. Movements of various muscles in the throat and abdomen can create a pulsing sound.\nUsing snout vent length as an indicator of body size, researchers found that a longer snout vent length corresponded to a lower frequency call and lower pulse rate as well as fewer pulses in general. The production of lower frequency sounds can be attributed to the slower movements of larger physiological structures. High frequency calls were observed to have a shorter duration and faster pulse rate. Other findings of this study on \"Acris crepitans\" male calling, which perhaps offers insight into frog calling in general, include relationships between physical anatomy and auditory characteristics. A larger middle ear volume corresponded to a longer call duration, and the number of pulses in the calls showed a significant negative relationship with arytenoid cartilage, vocal cord and constrictor muscle volumes. The pulse rate is also correlated with vocal cord, basal cartilage and constrictor muscle volumes, but not with arytenoid cartilage or dilator muscle volumes.\nInterestingly, northern cricket frog calls resemble calls of the \"Bufo\" genus even though two types of frogs are not closely phylogenetically related. Thus, the vocal mechanisms of the two frogs are assumed to operate the same way.\nVariation in male calling.\nThe calls at the beginning of a call group have been found to vary independently of calls from the middle and end of the call group. Researchers have found that nearest neighbor distance, measured through the sound-pressure level of nearby calls, exert the biggest effect on variation in male calling. Additionally, calling behavior significantly changes during aggressive encounters.\nFemale preference of male calls.\nThe amphibian papilla and basilar papilla of Northern cricket frog ears are tuned, or sensitive, to different frequencies; the Amphibian papilla is more sensitive to lower frequencies, while the basilar papilla is more sensitive to higher frequencies. Both papilla are more sensitive to frequencies of conspecific calls rather than to the frequencies of the calls of other species. Frogs of the same species generally prefer local calls, which are calls of other frogs located geographically close. One study demonstrated that the basilar papilla tuning is different among Northern cricket frog females from three different populations (Bastrop, Austin, Indiana), with Bastrop frogs having the highest tuning and Austin frogs having the lowest. Further tests demonstrated that some populations showed a preference to local rather than foreign calls, while other populations preferred foreign calls, and some with no preference. However, if there is a preference for call type, females generally prefer lower frequency calls. There appears to be a reasonable explanation for such a preference, since larger males produce lower frequency calls. Attraction to larger males is beneficial since larger males fertilize more females eggs. More specifically larger females are more sensitive to and prefer lower frequencies, while smaller females prefer higher frequencies.\nMale mating tactics.\nSubordinate males that have recently matured and cannot effectively compete with dominant male display patterns use alternative mating tactics, such as satellite behavior. The satellite tactic is intercepting and mating with females going toward other calling males. Interestingly, the frequency of this tactic is not related to the size of males.\nOther hylid species such as \"H. cinerea\" switch from calling to satellite in proximity of other strong-calling males. A study observed much fewer \"A. crepitans\" switching tactics, which can be explained by the overall lower occurrence of satellite males, less risk of predation, or lower mating success rate for satellite males of this species.\nBiological reproductive patterns.\nThe lipid stores of both males and females are lower during the breeding season than in non-breeding periods (pre-breeding, post-breeding, post-hibernation). Observation of dissected stomachs of males indicate that feeding is minimal or non-existent during the breeding season. Since feeding is reduced, males metabolize more lipids during this period. Lower lipid stores in females can be explained by an increase in ovarian size during the breeding season.\nPredators.\nNorthern cricket frogs are preyed upon by a number of species, including birds, fish, and other frogs. To escape predators, they are capable of leaping up to 3 feet in a single jump and are excellent swimmers. It has been found that not only temperature, but hydration also has an effect on how far these frogs can jump. Being hydrated at a higher temperature is thought to allow them to jump farther and higher.\nPhysiology.\nSun compass orientation.\nMany animals can navigate using the sun as a compass in combination with an internal clock providing a sense of time, which is known as sun compass orientation. Other orientation cues used by cricket frogs include the moon and stars. \"Acris crepitans\" and \"A. gryllus\", both cricket frogs, have been observed to show similar orienting mechanisms, namely the Y-axis concept. The Y-axis is a reference axis established by land and water. Frogs require information about shore position, direct view of a celestial cue, and sense of time in order for the successful use of Y-axis type of orientation during the day.\nSex determination.\nNumerous environmental factors have been associated with sex determination in amphibians, including temperature, pH, and presence of foreign chemicals that affect the gonads. A study observing Northern cricket frogs in environments contaminated with organochlorides concluded that sites contaminated with point polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) were significantly related to sex-ratio reversal: contaminated sites had more males compared to control ponds, suggesting that organochlorines can influence cricket frog sexual differentiation. For example, the same study had shown that in certain parts of Illinois that are more industrialized and had organochlorine peptides there was a larger proportion of intersex frogs. In the case of Illinois, this was in the northeast. However, more environmentally friendly regions, like southern Illinois, had a more diverse frog population.\nImmunology vs. reproduction.\nMetabolic resources are allocated to different physiological systems. The amount of allocation may vary with changing external conditions and thus internal demands. Much research has been conducted to demonstrate the balance of resources between immunity and reproduction, including that of \"Acris crepitans\". Male northern cricket frogs were collected at the peak of the breeding season and injected with sheep blood cells to elicit an immune response. Researchers found that spermatic cyst diameter, germinal epithelium depth, and gonadosomatic index were smaller in the injected males compared to males injected with saline (control) as well as their noninjected counterparts. This suggests that sperm production decreases under immunological stress. More generally and importantly, these results demonstrate that resource investment in reproduction decreases as more resources must be allocated to the immune system under immunologically-challenging conditions.\nThermoregulation.\nNorthern cricket frogs are diurnal and generally active much of the year, except in midwinter in northern areas when the water is frozen. They are freeze resistant so during winter months, they stay underground near the surface to resist freezing. Individuals can increase the concentration of body fluids to lower their freezing points, making them resistant to supercooling and flashpoint freezing.\nMorphology.\n\"Acris crepitans\" are morphologically unique among hylids because of their unusually small size, as well as their bumpy skin that is not really seen in the family of Hylidae. A snout vent length of 20mm marks sexual maturity. Females are slightly larger than males and can reach a maximum snout vent length of 38mm. The northern cricket frog's overall small size and limited skull ossification suggests miniaturization of this species. Miniaturization, or the evolution of a smaller body size, due to changes in anatomy, physiology, life history, and behavior over time. For this species, the necessity to rapidly attain sexual maturity could explain its miniaturization; frogs grow 12 to 26 mm within a few months in preparation for the breeding season.\nThe cranial cartilages of these frogs are very mineralized with calcium, which reinforce cartilage as frogs develop into adulthood. These frogs possess small, thin, and long nasals, which is consistent with its being a small anuran. The nasals take a triangle-like shape. Other skeletal abnormalities of \"A. crepitans\" include lateral asymmetry in development of vomerine teeth and parasphenoid alae as well as tumor-like growth on the femur.\nSeveral hypotheses have been presented in an attempt to explain the observed abnormalities in this frog: small skeletal malformations are normally present at a high rate in this species, stress caused by habitat fragmentation, or there is environmental contamination."

        "title": "1969 World Snooker Championship",
        "text": "The 1969 World Snooker Championship (also known as the Player's No.6 World Snooker Championship for sponsorship reasons) was a professional snooker tournament. It was the first World Snooker Championship in a knock-out format since 1957, following a series of challenge matches from 1964 to 1968. John Spencer won the title, defeating Gary Owen by achieving a winning margin at 37 to 24 in the final. Spencer had earlier eliminated defending champion John Pulman from the competition, in the quarter-finals.\nThere were eight players who entered the championship, including four competition debutants. The quarter-finals and semi-finals were staged at several venues in England from 18 November 1968 until 22 February 1969, and the final was held at Victoria Hall in London from 17 to 22 March 1969. As champion, Spencer received £1,300 from the total prize fund of £3,500. The 1969 championship is regarded as the first of the modern snooker era.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first professional snooker championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis in the final. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until 1935, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship. Davis also won the title each year until 1940, when the contest was cancelled during World War II, and again when the championship resumed in 1946, accumulating a total of 15 titles before retiring from the event.\nIn 1952, the, following a dispute between the Professional Billiards Players' Association (PBPA) and the BACC about the distribution of income from the world championship, the PBPA members established an alternative competition known as the World Professional Match-play Championship, the editions of which are now recognised as world championships, whilst only Horace Lindrum and Clark McConachy entered for the BACC's 1952 World Snooker Championship. The World Professional Match-play Championship continued until 1957, after which there were no world championship matches until professional Rex Williams gained agreement from the BACC that the world championship would be staged on a challenge basis, with defending champion Pulman featuring in the first match. Pulman retained the title in several challenges from 1964 to 1968. Pulman had been touring snooker clubs as promotional work for the tobacco brand John Player, and the company had sponsored his 1968 match against Eddie Charlton. The good attendances for the championship match led to John Player deciding to sponsor the 1969 World Snooker Championship as a knock-out format tournament, using their \"Players No. 6\" brand. The total prize fund was £3,500, , including £1,300 for the champion. The 1969 championship is regarded as the first of the modern snooker era.\nTournament summary.\nThe closing date for players to enter the championship was 30 June 1968. There were eight entrants: four of whom had played professionally in the 1950s and four championship debutants. The new players were John Spencer, Ray Reardon, Gary Owen, and Bernard Bennett. Defending champion Pulman was drawn to meet Spencer, who had recently defeated him 14–17 in a non-title challenge match.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe first match, played from 18 to 22 November 1968 at the Wryton Stadium in Bolton, saw the end of Pulman's reign as champion, when he was defeated by Spencer. Spencer took a 4–0 lead, and ended the first 4–2 ahead. Spencer compiled a 110 in the 18th , on his way to establishing a 13–5 lead at the end of the second day. Spencer led 24–18 after the final afternoon session and clinched the match by winning the first frame in the evening with what was reported in \"The Times\" as a \"magnificent 97 break\".\nOwen faced Jackie Rea at the Hippodrome, Stratford-upon-Avon, from 25 to 28 November 1968. The players each won three frames in the first afternoon session. Rea took the first in the evening, before Owen claimed five consecutive frames to end the first day 8–4 ahead. On the second afternoon, the players again won three frames apiece, with Owen compiling a 68 break that turned out to be the highest break of the match. Rea took the first three frames of the evening session, to move to 10–11, then Owen won two of the next three for a 13–11 overnight lead. Owen increased his lead by winning four of the six frames on the third afternoon, and maintained it by adding three of the six evening frames, leading 20–16 going into the last day.\nThe match between Williams and Bennett was played from 25 to 28 November 1968 at the Marland Hall in Southampton. Williams took all six frames in the first session, and achieved a winning margin at 25–4. Williams compiled a 107 break in the third frame of the fourth session, and, after were played, finished 38–11 ahead.\nThe fourth quarter-final, between Fred Davis and Reardon, was not played until January 1969 because Reardon was touring South Africa. The match was played at the Tunstall British Legion, Stoke-on-Trent, from 20 to 24 January. The match featured lengthy tactical exchanges between the players, resulting in some of the longest sessions ever to take place in world championship history to that point. No player was ahead by more than two frames until Reardon took the 27th frame to lead 15–12, after which Davis won six successive frames to leave Reardon three frames behind at 15–18. Later, having been three frames down with six to play, Davis levelled the match at 24–24. Davis won in the after a break of 52 and some smaller scoring visits, with Reardon conceding the frame at 64 points behind with one remaining. The highest break of the match was 89, scored by Reardon.\nSemi-finals.\nThe two youngest players to have entered the tournament, Spencer, aged 33, and Williams, aged 35, contested the first semi-final, held at the Co-op Hall, Bolton, from 10 to 15 February. Spencer took a 9–0 lead, and was 11–1 ahead after the first day. Williams won the first two frames of the third day, and, after Spencer had taken the 15th frame, Williams added the 16th frame on a . The second day finished with Spencer leading 19–5, and the score was 29–7 after he won ten of the twelve frames on day three. Spencer achieved a winning margin at 37–12, and finished at 55–18 after dead frames were played.\nThe second semi final, between Owen and Davis, was held at the Wilstanton Miners Club, Stoke-on-Trent, from 17 to 22 February. Owen took a four frame lead at the start of the match. Davis won the fifth and sixth frames, before Owen claimed the last three frames of the afternoon session followed by all six frames in the evening session for an 11–2 lead. After winning the third session 4–3 and the fourth session 5–2, Owen's lead at the end of the second day was 19–7. Taking ten of thirteen frames on day three, Owen extended his advantage to 29–10. The fourth day saw Davis reduce the deficit to twelve frames, at 20–32. On day five, the afternoon session ended with Owen 36–23 ahead, and, after Davis has made a break of 83 in the 60th frame, Owen achieved a winning margin at 37–24. After dead frames, Owen finished 45–28 ahead.\nFinal.\nThe final was held at Victoria Hall, London, from 17 to 22 March. Spencer took a 6–2 lead, before Owen levelled the match at 6–6, having made the first day's highest break of 80 in the 9th frame. The \"Birmingham Daily Post\" correspondent praised the players for bringing a \"refreshing new look to the game, with bold attacking play, wonderful potting, and a sprinkling of good-sized breaks\". On the second day, both players missed easy , sharing the first two frames for 7–7 before Spencer won the next four frames to lead 11–7 by the interval, after which he added four of the subsequent six frames to increase his advantage to six frames at 15–9. The third day's play, which featured only two breaks of 50 or more, was described in the \"Coventry Evening Telegraph\" as \"undistinguished\", and ended with Spencer still six frames ahead, at 21–15. On day 4, Owen won four of the afternoon session's six frames to close to 19–23. In the evening session, Spencer claimed the first three frames, and finished the day six frames ahead again at 27–21. Owen only won three of the twelve frames on the fifth day, leaving Spencer one frame from victory at 36–24. Owen's brother Marcus Owen, a former English Amateur Championship winner, commented that \"Gary's cueing is all over the place. Every time he plays a forcing shot, his whole body is moving.\" Spencer took the first frame on the final day to claim victory by achieving a winning margin of 37–24. The remaining 12 dead frames were played, with Spencer finishing 46–27 ahead. With this he became the first player to win the World Championship at his first attempt since Joe Davis at the inaugural championship in 1927. Owen compiled a 100 break, the highest of the match, in the 66th frame after the title had been decided.\nSnooker historian Clive Everton commented that although Spencer only recorded a small number of breaks above 60, \"in every other respect, the new champion's display was a revelation. His long potting, his prodigious screw shots even when cue-ball and object-ball were seven or eight feet apart, his uninhibited use of side, his bright attacking style, even the mere fact that here was a bright new face, made Spencer's win a memorable one.\"\nMain draw.\nMatch results are shown below.

        "title": "Corey Hart (baseball)",
        "text": "Jon Corey Hart (born March 24, 1982) is an American former professional baseball right fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers from 2004 through 2013, the Seattle Mariners in 2014 and the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2015. Hart was a two-time MLB All-Star, and also participated in the MLB Home Run Derby.\nHigh school career.\nPrior to being drafted in the 11th round of the 2000 MLB Draft, Hart played for the Greenwood High School Gators in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Hart also played basketball for four years for the Gators for Coach Jason Couch. On the diamond, he played nearly every position, routinely in the middle infield and even pitching in relief for Coach Chris Decker. Hart's jersey is retired by Greenwood and hangs from the rafters in the school's gymnasium.\nHart played American Legion Baseball and was named the program's Graduate of the Year for 2011.\nMinor league career.\nHart started his career in 2000 with the Rookie League Ogden Raptors, primarily playing at first base. He moved up to the single-A High Desert Mavericks and then the double-A Huntsville Stars by the season; defensive problems caused Hart to be moved to the outfield. Playing there, he moved up to the Class AAA Indianapolis Indians by 2004.\nIn 2005, Hart batted .308 with 17 home runs and 69 RBIs in 113 games for the triple-A Nashville Sounds. While there, Hart played alongside future major league teammates Prince Fielder and J. J. Hardy. He also had 31 stolen bases, a relatively unusual feat for a player as tall as the Hart. Hart continued to play in both the minor and major leagues through 2006, and was regarded as one of Milwaukee's top prospects.\nMajor league career.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nHart made his MLB debut with the Brewers on May 25, 2004. Hart's next appearance in the majors was Sunday, August 14, 2005, when he hit his first career MLB home run, a three-run blast against the Cincinnati Reds into the Upper Deck at Miller Park. Hart played 87 games for the major league club in 2006 and was with the Brewers for the entire 2007 season, mainly seeing action in right-field. Hart also led off for the Brewers for almost half of the 2007 season when second baseman Rickie Weeks was on the disabled list. May 29, 2010 Hart hit his first major league grand slam. In that game against the Mets he had two home runs.\nDuring spring training prior to the 2007 season, Hart, who stands at , recorded the fastest 60 yard dash of any player on the Brewers roster.\nDuring the 2007 season, Hart had a 22-game hitting streak which was finally snapped in a July 7 game against the Washington Nationals, as Hart went 0–4 with a walk. In 2007, Hart became the first Brewer since 2003 to steal 20 bases and hit 20 home runs in a single season. As of September 2011, he and Ryan Braun were the only two Brewers to have two 20-steals/20-homers seasons in their careers.\nIn 2008, Hart was selected as an outfielder to the National League team at the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, which took place on July 15 at Yankee Stadium. He was voted in by the fans as a final vote in which he beat out David Wright of the Mets as well as Pat Burrell of the Phillies, Aaron Rowand of the Giants, and Carlos Lee of the Astros (a former Brewer himself). On August 30, 2008, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Hart became the first player in Brewers history to have back to back 20–20 seasons. Hart reached base on an error 14 times in 2008, more than any other batter in the NL.\nIn July 2010, Hart was voted by his peers to not only play in the All-Star Game in Anaheim, but also was selected by MLB officials to participate in the Home Run Derby. Hart had a breakout season in 2010 statistically. As the regular Brewers right fielder, he posted a career best 31 home runs, 102 RBIs, and a .283 batting average. Along with Ryan Braun, Prince Fielder, Rickie Weeks, and Casey McGehee, the Brewers had one of the best top five slots in MLB.\nOn May 23, 2011, Hart tied the Brewers records for home runs in a game with three and RBIs with seven. Hart had another productive regular season with the Brewers in 2011, posting 26 home runs, and 63 RBIs with a .285 batting average, .386 OBP, and .866 OPS. Hart's drop in home runs and RBIs is a result of missing the first month of the season with an injury, and being moved to bat first in the order in July, limiting the number of RBI chances he had. Hart remained first in the batting order in the playoffs due to his success in the slot during the regular season.\nHart started the 2012 season as the Brewers regular right fielder, but injuries to Brewers first basemen Mat Gamel and Travis Ishikawa resulted in Hart becoming the Brewers regular first baseman, where he ended up having a successful season, recording a .995 fielding percentage playing in over 100 games at first base. He had a productive offensive season with the Brewers in 2012, batting .270 with 30 home runs and 83 RBIs.\nHart had surgery on his left knee in January 2013, and missed the entire 2013 season.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn December 11, 2013, Hart agreed to a one-year, $6 million contract with the Seattle Mariners. The deal contained up to $7 million in incentives. He was designated for assignment on September 29, 2014.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates signed Hart to a one-year, $2.5 million contract on December 19, 2014.\nHart finished his professional baseball career in 2015.\nRetirement with the Milwaukee Brewers.\nOn June 27, 2017, it was announced that Hart would officially retire from Major League Baseball as a Milwaukee Brewer after being honored at Miller Park on June 30 with a plaque on the park's Wall of Honor. A two-time All-Star, Hart spent nine of his 11 Major League seasons with the Brewers, batting .276 with 154 home runs, 508 RBI and 83 stolen bases in 945 games. He had five 20-home-run seasons in Milwaukee, tied with four others for third-most in franchise history. Among the 38 players who have collected at least 2,000 plate appearances in a Brewers uniform, his .491 slugging percentage ranks sixth all-time.\nCareer statistics.\nIn 1048 games over 11 seasons, Hart compiled a .271 batting average (1009-for-3729) with 549 runs, 221 doubles, 33 triples, 162 home runs, 538 RBI, 85 stolen bases, 286 walks, .329 on-base percentage and .478 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .988 fielding percentage playing all three outfield positions and first base. In the postseason, in 14 playoff games, Hart batted .241 (13-for-54) with 6 runs, 2 home runs and 5 RBI.\nPersonal life.\nHart returns home to Bowling Green whenever possible and is active with local charities. Corey is the son of Johnnie and the late Donna Hart and has two sisters, Tabitha (older) and Ali (younger). He has said that he would be either a teacher or coach if he were not a baseball player.\nHart is a Christian."

        "text": "William Joseph (born September 3, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes before being selected by the New York Giants in the first round of the 2003 NFL draft. He finished his NFL career with the Oakland Raiders.\nEarly years.\nA Haitian American, Joseph attended Edison High School and was Florida Class 6A Second-team All-State and First-team All-Dade County as a defensive end, recorded 109 tackles, 17 sacks, 12 tackles for loss, six fumbles caused and four fumbles recovered as a senior. As a junior, he totaled 90 tackles and 11 sacks.\nCollege career.\nJoseph started every game (51 including bowl games) of his Miami career.

        "title": "List of people banned from Major League Baseball",
        "text": "A ban from Major League Baseball is a form of punishment levied by the Office of the Commissioner of Major League Baseball (MLB) against a player, manager, executive, or other person connected with the league as a denunciation of some action that person committed that violated or tarnished the integrity of the game. A banned person is forbidden from employment with MLB or its affiliated minor leagues, and is forbidden from other professional involvement with MLB such as acting as a sports agent for an MLB player. Since 1991, all banned people–whether living or deceased–have been barred from induction to the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nMajor League Baseball has maintained an official list of \"permanently ineligible\" people since Kenesaw Mountain Landis was installed as the first Commissioner of Baseball in 1920. Although the majority of banned persons were banned after the establishment of the Commissioner's office, some were formally banned prior to that time while a few others were informally \"blacklisted\" by the Major League clubs. Most persons who have been banned (including many who have been reinstated) were banned due to association with gambling or otherwise conspiring to fix the outcomes of games; others have been banned for a multitude of reasons including illegal activities off the field, violating some term of their playing contract, or making disparaging remarks that brought the game into disrepute.\nHistory.\nPrior to 1920, players were banned by the decision of a committee. There were 14 players banned from 1865 to 1920; of those, 12 were banned for association with gambling or attempting to fix games, one was banned for violating the reserve clause, and one was banned for making disparaging remarks.\nIn 1920, team owners established the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball, ostensibly to keep the players in line and out of corruption's way. Kenesaw Mountain Landis, a federal judge, was the owners' ideal candidate for the job. He demanded nearly unlimited power over every person in organized baseball down to the batboys, including the authority to ban people from the game. The owners, reeling from the fallout of the Black Sox Scandal, agreed.\nLandis banned many players and various others, often for seemingly small offenses, and at times almost indiscriminately. In his 24 years as commissioner, Landis banned more people than all of his successors combined. The last person banned by Landis to remain alive was William D. Cox, who died at 79 years old in 1989.\nAs of 2021, no one has died while still ineligible after being banned by one of Landis' successors. In 1991, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum voted to bar banned players from induction. The oldest living person on the ineligible list is Pete Rose, who is years old as of . Rose's banishment remains among the most bitterly debated of any imposed after Landis' tenure. While Rose eventually admitted to betting on his team (which under the rules then and now in force are grounds for permanent ineligibility), his supporters argue that a lifetime ban is unjust due to a lack of conclusive evidence that his gambling directly affected the outcome of any games, and also due to modern society's more relaxed attitude towards gambling.\nBy the 21st century, the use of performance enhancing drugs had replaced the possible influence of gambling as the greatest perceived threat to the integrity of the game. Subsequently, both the Commissioner of Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association came under intense pressure from fans, owners, current and former players, team officials, and the United States Congress to take decisive action against PED use in baseball. In 2005, as a result of the findings of the Mitchell Report, the owners and the MLBPA reached a new Basic Agreement which stipulated that multiple violations of the overhauled Major League Baseball drug policy would result in a lifetime ban.\nPunishment.\nProhibited.\nA person who has been banned from Major League Baseball is barred from:\nTerms such as \"lifetime ban\" and \"permanent ban\" are misnomers, as a banned person may be reinstated (i.e., have the ban removed) whether by the decision of the Commissioner of Major League Baseball or (in the case of players banned since the establishment of the Major League Baseball Players Association) following an appeal by the MLBPA on behalf of a banned player to an independent arbitrator empowered to hear and adjudicate such appeals. Furthermore, in the case of Hall of Fame induction, bans have typically extended beyond a person's lifetime.\nNon-prohibited.\nAmong the activities that a banned person is not precluded from participating (as of 2016) in include:\nList of banned people.\nPre-1920.\nThese players were banned from baseball prior to the creation of the office of Commissioner of Baseball.\nUnofficial-turned-official bans.\nThese players were unofficially banned from baseball before the creation of the office of Commissioner of Baseball. They later had their bans made official by baseball's first Commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis.\nBanned under Commissioner Landis.\nLandis banned a total of nineteen people during his tenure, more than all of his successors combined. Of the nineteen, two were re-instated by Landis, one was re-instated by a successor and sixteen remain banned. As a condition of accepting the Commissioner's post, Landis demanded and got nearly unlimited power to sanction every person employed in the major leagues, from owners to batboys. In practice, Landis only meted out punishment for serious off-field transgressions he believed were a threat to the image and/or integrity of the game. Disciplinary action for the on-field behavior of players, coaches and managers remained the responsibility of the respective league presidents, as it had been prior to the creation of the Commissioner's office.\nBanned under Commissioner Kuhn.\nAfter Landis died in 1944, there was a long lull before the next banishment. During the tenures of Commissioners Happy Chandler (1945–1951), Ford Frick (1951–1965), Spike Eckert (1965–1968), Bowie Kuhn (1969–1984) and Peter Ueberroth (1984–1989), only three players (or former players) were banned for life.\nAll three were banned by Kuhn, and all three were later reinstated. By the time of Kuhn's tenure, players had organized the Major League Baseball Players Association and negotiated the first Basic Agreement with the owners. Among other things the Agreement provided, for the first time, an independent process through which active players could appeal disciplinary decisions (up to and including lifetime bans) by League presidents or the Commissioner. As of , no such process exists for personnel who are not members of the MLBPA.\nBanned under Commissioner Giamatti.\nA.

        "title": "2015 Cricket World Cup",
        "text": "The 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup was the 11th Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand from 14 February to 29 March 2015, and was won by Australia, defeating New Zealand by 7 wickets in the final. This was the second time the tournament was held in Australia and New Zealand, the first having been the 1992 Cricket World Cup. India were the defending champions having won the previous edition in 2011, but they were eliminated by eventual champions Australia in the semi-finals.\nThe tournament consisted of 14 teams, which were split into two pools of seven, with each team playing every other team in their pool once. The top four teams from each pool progressed to the knockout stage, which consisted of quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final.\nThe final was between the co-hosts Australia and New Zealand. Australia won by seven wickets, to win their fifth Cricket World Cup.\nThe total attendance was 1,016,420, with an average of 21,175 per game. The final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground had a crowd of 93,013, a record one-day cricket crowd for Australia In India, the largest television rating was for the Australia–India semi-final, 15% of television-viewing households.\nHost selection.\nBids.\nThe ICC announced the hosts for the previous World Cup, the 2011 competition, on 30 April 2006. Australia and New Zealand had also bid for the tournament and a successful Australian bid for the 2011 World Cup would have seen a 50–50 split in games, with the final still up for negotiation. The Trans-Tasman bid, Beyond Boundaries, was the only bid for 2011 delivered to the ICC headquarters at Dubai before 1 March deadline. Considerable merits of the bid included the superior venues and infrastructure, and the total support of the Australian and New Zealand governments on tax and custom issues during the tournament, according to Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland. The New Zealand government had also assured that the Zimbabwean team would be allowed to take part in the tournament after political discussions about whether their team would be allowed to tour Zimbabwe in 2005.\nICC President Ehsan Mani said that the extra time required by the Asian bloc to hand over its bid had harmed the four-nation bid. However, when it came to the voting, the Asians won by seven votes to four; according to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), it was the vote of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) that turned the matter. It was reported in Pakistani newspaper \"Dawn\" that the Asian countries promised to hold fundraising events for West Indian cricket during the 2007 Cricket World Cup, which may have influenced the vote. However, I.S. Bindra, chairman of the monitoring committee of the Asian bid, denied that, saying that it was their promise of extra profits of US$400 million that swung the vote their way.\nThe ICC was so impressed by the efficiency of the Trans-Tasman bid that they decided to award the next World Cup, to be held in 2015, to them.\nAustralia and New Zealand last jointly hosted the Cricket World Cup in 1992.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured 14 teams, the same number as the 2011 World Cup, giving associate and affiliate member nations a chance to participate.\nThe format was the same as the 2011 edition: 14 teams take part in the initial stages, divided into two groups of seven; the seven teams play each other once before the top four teams from each group qualify for the quarter-finals.\nOn 29 January 2015, ICC reinstated the use of the Super Over for Cricket World Cup Final match if the match finished as a tie.\nQualification.\nPer ICC regulations, the 10 ICC full member nations qualify for the tournament automatically. Immediately after the 2011 World Cup, it was decided that the next tournament would be reduced to only feature the 10 full members. This was met with heavy criticism from a number of associate nations, especially from the Ireland cricket team, who had performed well in 2007 and 2011, including victories over Pakistan and England, both full member nations. Following support shown by the ICC Cricket Committee for a qualification process, the ICC reversed their decision in June 2011 and decided that 14 teams would participate in the 2015 World Cup, including four associate or affiliate member nations.\nAt the ICC Chief Executives' Committee meeting in September 2011, the ICC decided on a new qualifying format. The top two teams of the 2011–13 ICC World Cricket League Championship qualify directly. The remaining six teams join the third and fourth-placed teams of 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two and the top two teams of 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three in a 10-team World Cup Qualifier to decide the remaining two places.\nOn 9 July 2013, as a result of a tied match against the Netherlands, Ireland became the first country to qualify for the 2015 World Cup. On 4 October 2013, Afghanistan qualified for their first Cricket World Cup after beating Kenya to finish in second place behind Ireland.\nScotland defeated the United Arab Emirates in the final of the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier and both teams qualified for the last two spots in the 2015 Cricket World Cup.\nPreparations.\nLocal organising committee.\nIn preparation for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, the organising committee of the tournament was finalised. John Harnden was named chief executive, James Strong as chairman, and Ralph Waters was named as the deputy chairman.\nAllocation of matches.\nWhen Australia and New Zealand bid for the 2011 Cricket World Cup in 2006, they said that it will see a 50–50 split in games. Finally, it was decided on 30 July 2013 that Australia would host 26 matches, while New Zealand got a share of 23 matches in the tournament. There was a tense battle between Melbourne and Sydney to host the final. On 30 July 2013, it was announced that Melbourne would host the final, with Sydney and Auckland hosting the semi-finals.\nVisas.\nIt was announced that spectators travelling to World Cup matches in New Zealand who would otherwise not be entitled to a visa waiver, would be able to enter New Zealand if they held an Australian visitor visa. This was a special Trans-Tasman Visa Arrangement for the 2015 Cricket World Cup.\nMedia and promotion.\nThe World Cup has grown as a media event with each tournament. The International Cricket Council has sold the rights for broadcasting of the 2015 Cricket World Cup for US$2 billion to ESPN Star Sports and Star Sports. According to Strong, the Local Organising Committee (LOC) wants to make the tournament the most fan-friendly event of its kind and take cricket to a wide range of communities throughout Australia and New Zealand.\nSachin Tendulkar was named by the ICC as the World Cup Ambassador for the second time, after filling the role at the 2011 Cricket World Cup.\nTickets for India v Pakistan in Adelaide reportedly sold out within 12 minutes of going on sale. The match received an average television audience in India of 14.8% of TV-equipped households. The semi-final, Australia–India, had a higher average rating in India, 15.0%, but no 2015 match surpassed the 2011 Final among Indian viewers. The 2015 World Cup came at a time of declining viewing figures for cricket in India. Broadcaster Star Sports claimed that its coverage reached 635 million viewers in India. An ICC-commissioned report claimed that the tournament was watched by over 1.5billion people.\nBroadcasting rights.\nThe following networks broadcast the tournament:\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremonies were held separately in Christchurch, New Zealand and Melbourne, Australia, on 12 February 2015, two days before the first two matches.\nPrize money.\nThe International Cricket Council declared a total prize money pool of $10 million for the tournament, which was 20 percent more than the 2011 edition. The prize money was distributed according to the performance of the team as follows:\nThis means that if the winner had remained undefeated throughout the group stage of the tournament, they would have won a total of $4,245,000 (winner's prize plus $45,000 for each group stage win), while a team eliminated in the group stage without any wins would have gotten $35,000.\nVenues.\nEach venue hosted 3 pool stage matches. The quarter-finals were in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Wellington, the semi-finals were played in Auckland and Sydney, and the final was played in Melbourne. Altogether there were 49 matches in 14 venues, with Australia hosting 26 games and New Zealand hosting 23 games.\nUmpires.\nThe umpire selection panel selected 20 umpires to officiate at the World Cup: five each from Australia and England, five from Asia, two each from New Zealand and South Africa and one from the West Indies.\nSquads.\nThe teams, after initially naming a provisional 30-member squad, were required to finalise a 15-member squad for the tournament on or before 7 January 2015.\nWarm-up matches.\nFourteen non-ODI warm-up matches were played from 8 to 13 February.\nGroup stage.\nA total of 42 matches were played throughout the group stage of the tournament. The top four teams from each pool qualified for the quarter-finals. In the event that two or more teams are tied on points after six matches the team with the most wins was to be ranked higher. If tied teams also had the same number of wins then they had to be ranked according to net run rate.\nKnockout stage.\nWhile the dates and venues were fixed, which match-up they host was subject to change to accommodate the host countries should they qualify. Both hosts qualified for the quarter-finals; Australia played the match on 20 March in Adelaide, and New Zealand played the match on 21 March in Wellington. Since Sri Lanka, the next highest ranked team, progressed to the quarter-finals, they played in Sydney. If England had advanced, as they were the third-highest ranked team, they would have played in Melbourne. As England failed to qualify for the quarter-finals, Bangladesh took their place. The teams from each pool was paired based on the A1 v B4, A2 v B3, A3 v B2, A4 v B1 format.\nNew Zealand's semi-final against South Africa was played on 24 March in Auckland while Australia's semi-final against India was played on 26 March in Sydney. Both the host nations qualified for the final, where Australia defeated New Zealand by 7 wickets."

        "text": "A butt is an archery shooting field, with mounds of earth used for the targets. The name originally referred to the targets themselves, but over time came to mean the platforms that held the targets as well. For instance \"Othello,\" V, ii, 267 mentions \"Here is my journey's end, here is my butt\". In medieval times, it was compulsory for all yeomen in England to learn archery; see for example , passed in the third year of Henry VIII's reign.\nSeveral English towns have districts called \"The Butts\", but they may not always take their names from archery. The Middle English word \"butt\" referred to an abutting strip of land, and is often associated with medieval field systems. An example is Newington Butts in south London where contrary to popular belief, the 1955 \"Survey of London\" published by London County Council could find no historical reference to archery butts. It concluded that the name probably derived from the triangle of land between the roads, as the word \"butts\" is used elsewhere in Surrey to refer to odd corners or ends of land.\nShooting butt.\nThe word is also used today for the earthwork mounds on, or before, which targets are mounted on a rifle range, with the purpose of stopping the flight of bullets beyond the range.\nA butt can also be an earthen bank, usually a horseshoe shape and often lined with sandbags, corrugated metal, or drystone walling, from which sportsmen can take cover, hide, and shoot at game birds. Shooting butts are usually positioned in lines or in small groups of two or three, about 80-100 meters apart."

It's just crazy to see how someone like Junior Seau took his own life over -- God knows what he was really struggling and dealing with. But you have to believe it came from the game of football. I want to get out before the game makes me get out, where I can get out on my own terms, and I can limit the amount of stress and negative impact that the game would leave on me. I played under a guy, Mike Munchak in Tennessee, and I used to watch him as he was running around the practice field for a half hour before practice, and I'd see the way he'd run,\" Bell said. \"He played 13 seasons, he played all 13 seasons with no cartilage in his knees. And I thought to myself, I don't want to look like that. I don't want to be at the point where I'm jeopardizing my true health for money pretty much. For money and for celebrity.\""

        "title": "Mark Davis (snooker player)",
        "text": "Mark Davis (born 12 August 1972) is an English professional snooker player from St Leonards in Sussex. He became professional in 1991, and for many years was considered something of a journeyman; however, he vastly improved his game in the late 2000s, and as a result in 2012 made his debut in the top 16. The highlights of his career so far have been winning the Benson &amp; Hedges Championship in 2002 (earning him an appearance at the Masters), and the six-red snooker world championships three times (in 2009, 2012 and 2013). Davis reached his first ranking event final in 2018, losing to Stuart Bingham in the final of the English Open.\nCareer.\nDavis made his debut in the main draw of the World Championship in 1994, losing in the first round to Terry Griffiths. In the following year he won his first match at the Crucible, beating Ken Doherty in the first round before being knocked out by Peter Ebdon in the second. Davis came close to losing his Main Tour status in the late 1990s, but recovered in the early 2000s to return to the top 48. Reaching the quarter-finals of the 2001 Regal Scottish tournament, his second career quarter-final, was the main catalyst for this. His success in reaching the 2008 World Championship came after two poor seasons, leaving him at No. 58 in the rankings. He opened the 2008/2009 season strongly by qualifying for the Northern Ireland Trophy and defeating local hope Joe Swail 5–4 in the first round, before beating Ding Junhui 5–4 in the last 32 in one of the best wins of his career. He was beaten 5–2 in the last 16 by Ali Carter. He followed this up by also qualifying for the Bahrain and UK Championships, though in the latter he was forced to pull out early in his last-32 match against Joe Perry, due to a stomach upset. He exceeded his 2007/2008 ranking points total after only five of the eight events of the 2008/2009 season. Davis won the Six-Red World Championship in 2009. In 2010, he reached the second round of the World Championship for the first time in 15 years by defeating sixth seed Ryan Day.\nHe also qualified for the 2010 Shanghai Masters event where he reached the last-eight beating Marco Fu and Stephen Maguire on the way before surrendering a 4–1 lead against Jamie Burnett and going out 5–4. However, his strong performances continued and took him to a career-high ranking of 18.\n2011/2012 season.\nDavis qualified for all but two of the ranking events in the 2011–12 season.&lt;ref name=\"2011/12\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He could only advance beyond the first round in the Australian Goldfields Open, where he lost 3–5 to Mark Selby in the last 16. Davis played in all 12 of the minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events during the season, reaching the final of Event 4, where he lost to Selby 0–4. This result was a large contributory factor to Davis finishing 16th on the PTC Order of Merit, inside the top 24 who made the Finals. At the Finals he beat Tom Ford, before losing to Stephen Maguire in the last 16. Davis' season came to an end when he suffered a heavy 2–10 loss, while feeling unwell, in the World Championship to Ali Carter. He finished the season ranked world number 19, with the elite top 16 places still eluding him.\n2012/2013 season.\nDavis started the 2012–13 season very successfully by reaching the first ranking event semi-final of his 21-year professional career at the Wuxi Classic. His run included wins over local favourite Ding Junhui, Jamie Burnett and Graeme Dott to set up a last 4 clash with Stuart Bingham who had won the previous week's Asian PTC. He trailed 0–4 at the mid-session interval, before coming back to play inspired snooker to lead 5–4 in the best of 11 frames match. However, Bingham then levelled the contest before compiling a 134 break to win the decider and end Davis' hopes of a first ranking final. At the Six-red World Championship he claimed the title by defeating Shaun Murphy 8–4 in the final. The winner's cheque of £40,000 is the biggest of his career to date. In the Australian Goldfields Open Davis saw off Jack Lisowski (5–2), home favourite Neil Robertson (5–1) and Martin Gould (5–2), to reach his second successive ranking semi-final.&lt;ref name=\"2012/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There he played close friend Barry Hawkins and was beaten 4–6.\nAt the UK Championship he beat Cao Yupeng 6–1 in the first round and led three-time champion John Higgins 5–2 in the second round, before withstanding a fightback from Higgins which included a 147, to win a decider. Davis saw off Matthew Stevens 6–4 in the quarter-finals, however his lack of experience on the big stage showed in his semi-final against Mark Selby, as he was beaten 4–9.\nDavis qualified for the 2013 Masters tournament thanks to his form earning him a place in the top 16. At his first outing in the tournament for 13 years he faced world number nine Mark Allen in the first round and lost 2–6. This began a dip in form for Davis as he lost in the qualifying round of the Welsh Open, the first round of both the World Open and Players Tour Championship Finals and in the second round of the China Open. However, he was still ranked 16 in the world at the cut-off for the 2013 World Championship, but was forced to qualify due to world number 28 and reigning champion Ronnie O'Sullivan deciding to defend his title after taking a year away from professional snooker. O'Sullivan was therefore the number one seed, meaning Davis dropped out of the top 16 who were guaranteed a spot in the event. Davis beat Liang Wenbo 10–6 in qualifying. He faced four-time champion John Higgins in the first round and claimed the best win of his career by winning 10–6 and played Stuart Bingham in the last 16. The match proved to be very tight, but from 10 to 10 Bingham pulled away to win 13–10 with Davis saying afterwards that he had done well to win 10 frames such was his disappointment at the way he had performed. However, he finished the season inside the top 16 for the very first time, at world number 13.\n2013/2014 season.\nDavis reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Goldfields Open but lost 5–3 to Mark Selby.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAt the 2013 Six-red World Championship he defended his title by defeating Neil Robertson 8–4 in the final. Only a week later he won his next tournament, the General Cup in Hong Kong, beating Robertson again in the final, this time by 7–2. A second ranking event quarter-final of the year came at the Shanghai Masters with comfortable 5–2 and 5–1 victories over Ali Carter and John Higgins. However, he then squandered a 4–2 lead over Xiao Guodong to be beaten 5–4. At the Masters he forced a decider in the first round against Mark Selby, having been 4–0 down but lost the 55-minute final frame to be defeated 6–5. In the quarter-finals of the German Masters, Davis lost in an extremely close match with Rod Lawler 5–4. Davis was an automatic qualifier for the World Championship for the first time in his career this season and said before the event that his minimum goal was to win through to the quarter-finals, but he was beaten 10–5 in the first round by Dominic Dale. Davis hung on to his top 16 ranking at the end of the season as he was the world number 16.\n2014/2015 season.\nDavis began his season at the Australian Goldfields Open, with his quarter-final match against Stuart Bingham containing ten breaks above 50 in the nine frames played, which Davis edged 5–4. In Davis' fourth ranking event semi-final he lost 6–2 to home favourite Neil Robertson. His second quarter-final in a ranking event of the year came at the UK Championship, but he was defeated 6–1 by Judd Trump. He followed that up with a semi-final showing at the minor-ranking Lisbon Open where he was whitewashed 4–0 by Stephen Maguire.&lt;ref name=\"2014/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was beaten 3–2 by Stuart Bingham in the final of the non-ranking Championship League.\nDavis' consistent season continued as he restricted John Higgins to just 38 points to thrash him 4–0 in reaching the last eight of the Indian Open, but he lost 4–2 against Thepchaiya Un-Nooh. Davis progressed through to his fourth ranking quarter-final of the season, the most in a single season of his career, at the PTC Grand Final by eliminating Neil Robertson 4–1. He was unable to play in the semi-finals however, as Bingham knocked him out 4–1. Davis earned a 4–0 early advantage over Ding Junhui at the World Championship and won the first session 5–3. However, he went on to be beaten 10–7.\n2015/2016 season.\nDavis' first quarter-final of the 2015–16 season came at the Shanghai Masters, courtesy of 5–1 and 5–3 wins over Michael White and Shaun Murphy, but he was beaten 5–1 by Mark Allen. He lost in the third round of the UK Championship 6–4 to Stephen Maguire.&lt;ref name=\"2015/16\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Davis claimed the World Seniors Championship, his first televised title in the UK, by seeing off Darren Morgan in the final. He failed to qualify for the World Championship for the first time since 2011 after losing 10–5 to Zhang Anda.\n2016/2017 season.\nDavis lost 4–1 to Mark Selby in the quarter-finals of the Paul Hunter Classic. At the European Masters he beat Shaun Murphy 4–1 and Liang Wenbo 4–3 to reach another quarter-final and was defeated 4–1 by Ronnie O'Sullivan. His third quarter-final of the year came at the Scottish Open after he squeezed past Mark Williams 4–3, but he was heavily beaten 5–1 by Marco Fu.&lt;ref name=\"2016/17\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Davis knocked out Ronnie O'Sullivan 4–3 in the second round of the Welsh Open after being 3–0 down and then made the event's high break of 144 as he eliminated Fergal O'Brien 4–2. Davis lost 4–3 to Scott Donaldson in the fourth round.

        "text": "The 1974 World Snooker Championship (also known as 1974 Park Drive World Snooker Championship for sponsorship reasons) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 16 to 25 April 1974 at the Belle Vue in Manchester, England. It was the 1974 edition of the World Snooker Championship, established in 1927. The 1974 tournament was promoted by Snooker Promotions, and sponsored by tobacco brand Park Drive. The event attracted 31 entrants and carried a prize fund of £10,000. Seven qualifying matches were held; the seven winners of these joined the other 17 players in the main tournament.\nRay Reardon won the title by defeating Graham Miles 22–12 in the final. It was Reardon's third World Championship win, after his first in 1970; he was the defending champion from 1973 World Snooker Championship. He went on to win a further three titles, the last of them in 1978. There were five century breaks during the competition, the highest of which was 131 by Miles. A plate competition was held, for losers in the first and second rounds of the main tournament. John Spencer defeated John Pulman 15–5 in the plate competition final, and recorded six century breaks during his four matches.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first professional snooker championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until 1935, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship.\nIn 1952, the, following a dispute between the Professional Billiards Players' Association (PBPA) and the BACC about the distribution of income from the world championship, the PBPA members established an alternative competition known as the World Professional Match-play Championship, the editions of which are now recognised as world championships, whilst only two players entered for the BACC's 1952 World Snooker Championship. The World Professional Match-play Championship continued until 1957, after which there were no world championship matches until professional Rex Williams gained agreement from the BACC that the world championship would be staged on a challenge basis, with defending champion Pulman featuring in the first match. Pulman retained the title in several challenges from 1964 to 1968. \nThe 1969 championship, when the tournament reverted to a knockout format, is regarded as the first of the modern snooker era, and was won by John Spencer. From 1972, the championship was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), which was the renamed PBPA. The defending champion was Ray Reardon, who defeated Eddie Charlton 38–32 in the 1973 final. \nFormat.\nThe 1974 competition was promoted by Snooker Promotions, a company established by Peter West and Patrick Nally. The tournament was sponsored by tobacco brand Park Drive, with £10,000 prize money. This was the last time that Park Drive sponsored the event and there was no sponsor the following year. The venue was Belle Vue, Manchester. There were 31 entrants. A qualifying round was held on 11 April, and the main tournament was held from 16 to 25 April 1974, initially with concurrent play across eight different snooker tables, and two per day. The seven qualifiers and nine other players contested the first round matches, with winners from those matches each then meeting one of the eight players who had been exempted to the second round.\nPrize fund.\nThe winner of the event received £2,000 from a total prize fund of £10,000. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below.\nTournament summary.\nQualifying.\nA qualifying round was held on 11 April, with seven matches played as the best-of-15 frames; a seven-frame session followed by an eight-frame session. Former champion John Pulman whitewashed Jack Karnehm 8–0.

Warren Simpson, feeling ill from the effects of his diabetes, won seven consecutive frames from 1–3 against Jack Rea to progress.\nA report in \"Snooker Scene\" magazine described the general standard of play in the qualifying round as \"disappointing\".\nFirst round.\nThe first round matches were played as the best-of-15 frames on 16 April across two sessions - seven frames in the afternoon session and eight frames in the evening. Simpson discharged himself from hospital, where he had spent several days due to influenza, one hour before his match against Bernard Bennett, and lost 2–8.

Charlton took the next four frames to draw level, but Dunning won the next two and progressed to the quarter-finals.\nSpencer, affected by influenza, was two frames behind Mans, 6–8, after two sessions.

The first two days both featured two seven-frame sessions. The sixth session was not required as the match was completed during the fifth session.

Reardon secured victory at 22–12. Reardon said \"I don't feel that I played any better than mediocre in the final, but this is because Graham never put me under pressure. I don't feel the elation that I felt at winning last year.\" It was Reardon's third world snooker championship win, after his first in 1970. He went on to win a further three titles, the last of them in 1978.\nMain draw.\nResults for the tournament are shown below.

His 6–3 semi-final win over the Welsh veteran Mark Bennett (who had knocked out several of the game's big names – including Chris Small, Peter Ebdon, Steve Davis and Tony Drago en route to the semi-final stage) did see him take out that tournament's in-form player.

The event was won by the French team, who also swept the medals in the individual épée event. Each nation could enter a team of up to 8 fencers, with 4 fencers chosen for each match.\nCompetition format.\nThe tournament used a variant of the Bergvall system, holding a single elimination bracket for the gold medal with a repechage ending in a match for silver and bronze.

        "text": "The 1972 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament that took place between March 1971 and 26 February 1972, as an edition of the World Snooker Championship. The final was played at Selly Park British Legion from 21 to 26 February. Alex Higgins won his first world title, defeating defending champion John Spencer 37–31 in the final. Higgins also made the highest known of the tournament, 133. In all, he won six matches to secure the title, including a 31–30 victory over Rex Williams in the semi-final after Williams had missed an attempt to a . Higgins became the first qualifier to win the World Championship, and, aged 22, the youngest champion until Stephen Hendry in 1990. Higgins's win led to increased interest in snooker from the media and sponsors. \nThe tournament ran from March 1971 to February 1972, with matches at various venues. Spectators at the final were seated on wooden boards placed atop beer barrels. On the first evening of the final, the was conducted with reduced light provided by a mobile generator, as the normal power supply was interrupted due to the miners' strike.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first professional snooker championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis in the final. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until 1935, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship.\nIn 1952, following a dispute between the Professional Billiards Players' Association (PBPA) and the BACC about the distribution of income from the world championship, the PBPA members established an alternative competition known as the World Professional Match-play Championship, the editions of which are now recognised as world championships, while only Horace Lindrum and Clark McConachy entered for the BACC's 1952 World Snooker Championship. The World Professional Match-play Championship continued until 1957, after which there were no world championship matches until professional Rex Williams gained agreement from the BACC that the world championship would be staged on a challenge basis, with defending champion Pulman featuring in the first match. Pulman retained the title in several challenges from 1964 to 1968. Pulman had been touring snooker clubs as promotional work for the tobacco brand John Player, and the company had sponsored his 1968 match against Eddie Charlton. The good attendances for the championship match led to John Player deciding to sponsor the 1969 World Snooker Championship as a knock-out format tournament, using their \"Players No. 6\" brand. The 1969 championship is regarded as the first of the modern snooker era, and was won by John Spencer, who defeated Gary Owen 37–24 in the final.\nThe 1972 championship was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, which was the renamed PBPA. The draw for players entering the competition was made in February 1971. There was an entry fee of £100 per player, with the intention that the winner would receive 60% of the combined entry fees, and the runner-up 40%, with gate receipts after expenses also going to players. There was no sponsor for the tournament, and the prize money was by arrangement with individual promoters; The defending champion was Spencer, who had won the 1971 World Snooker Championship (which was actually held in 1970) in Australia. The tournament ran from March 1971 to February 1972.\nTournament summary.\nQualifying and first round.\nThe qualifying competition contained eight players of which two qualifiers joined other entrants in the competition proper. Those in the qualifying section included Alex Higgins, and four former amateur champions, Ron Gross, Maurice Parkin, Pat Houlihan and Geoff Thompson. In the first qualifying round, over 21 frames, two matches were played at the Brentham Club, Ealing. John Dunning led Houlihan 9-5 but won only by a single frame, 11-10. Higgins compiled a 103 break in the seventh frame against Gross, and reached a winning score at 11–4. It ended 16–5 after . Graham Miles eliminated Bernard Bennett at the Castle Club, Southampton, and made a 115 break in the 21st frame, making it 15–6. Parkin won in a against Thompson at Barnsley Conservative Club.\nIn the second qualifying round, playing at Ecclesfield Ex-Servicemen's Club, Sheffield, Higgins took ten consecutive frames while defeating Parkin 11–3. Dunning eliminated Miles 11–5 at the Selly Park British Legion.\nThere were two matches played in the first round of the main competition. Higgins eliminated Jackie Rea 19–11 at the Ecclesfield Ex-Servicemen's Club. He compiled a 103 break in the third session and a 133 during the fourth session. Rea complimented Higgins on the performance, saying that \"He does everything wrong. And yet he knocks such a lot in\". John Pulman took a 6–2 lead against Dunning, and went on to win 19–7. Fred Davis was due to play Kingsley Kennerley, but proceeded by walkover when Kennerley withdrew due to illness.\nQuarter-finals and semi-finals.\nSpencer eliminated Davis 31–21. Williams defeated the 1970 champion Reardon 25–23 in a match held across five different venues in Scotland. Reardon trailed 20–22 before winning the following three frames, after which Williams won three frames in succession to secure victory. Owen was expected to face Taylor, but withdrew after emigrating to Australia. His place in the draw was given to Charlton by the WPBSA. Charlton, who arrived from Australia on the first morning of his match against Taylor, won 31–25. Pulman took a 2–0 lead against Higgins, but was 2–3 behind before finishing their first day the odd frame ahead at 4–3. Higgins led 12–8 after the second day, and 19–14 at the close of day three. The penultimate day ended with Higgins 28–19 up, and although Pulman won the first two frames on the concluding day, Higgins secured victory at 31–23.\nSpencer had embarked on a tour of Canada between the quarter-finals and semi-finals. He won 37–32 against Charlton, in the semi-final played at the Co-op Hall, Bolton, from 10 to 14 January. The players agreed on a £750 side bet to be paid by the losing player to the winner.\nWilliams took nine consecutive frames to establish a 12–6 lead against Higgins. Higgins next took the lead at 26–25. The match went to a deciding frame, and Williams was 28 points to 14 ahead when he missed an attempt to pot a blue ball from its spot into a middle pocket. Higgins compiled a break of 32, and then, following some safety play, potted the green ball to clinch victory. Williams later commented \"That blue could have changed the direction of both our careers.\"\nOn the day before the start of the Championship final, Spencer and Higgins contested the final of the Spring Park Drive 2000 event, which Spencer won 4–3.\nFinal.\nThe final was played at the Selly Park British Legion, Birmingham, from 21 to 26 February, refereed by Jim Thorpe. Historian Dominic Sandbrook wrote in 2019 that the tournament had been \"organized in conditions of laughable amateurishness\" and that the final was played under \"risibly ramshackle conditions\". Spectators at the final were seated on wooden boards placed atop beer barrels. There was a miners' strike in progress at the same time as the final, and on the first evening of play, without normal power, the session was conducted with reduced light provided by a mobile generator.\nBefore the match started, Spencer was generally expected to win. The first session finished with the players tied at 3–3. In the eighth frame, Higgins made a break of 35, but Spencer then compiled a 101 break to take the frame. The first day ended with the score 6–6. Spencer made his second century break of the match, 109, in the 16th frame, and the third session concluded with the players again level, at 9–9, while the fourth session saw Spencer go 13–11 ahead. Day three closed with the score 18–18 at the half-way point of the match, and the players were still tied, now at 21–21, following the next session. Higgins then won six consecutive frames to make it 27–21. On day five, Spencer was stuck in a lift due to a power cut, and the match started ten minutes late. Higgins took the first frame of the ninth session, but lost four of the next five, leaving him 29–25 ahead. Both players won three frames in the tenth session. On the last day, Higgins clinched the 61st frame with a break of 40. Spencer then produced his third century break of the match, 123, in the 62nd frame, and added the next two frames to his tally with breaks over 50 in each. Higgins made a break of 82 in the 66th frame, which left him leading at 35–31. He took the opening frame of the concluding session by 62 points to 38, then compiled breaks of 94 and 46 to win the last frame he needed by 140 points to 0 to secure a 37–31 victory. Spencer made three century breaks during the final, while the highest break by Higgins was the 94 in the decisive frame. The trophy was presented to Higgins by Pulman.\nHiggins, who was required to win two qualifying matches to reach the tournament proper, became the first qualifier to win the world snooker championship. The win made him the youngest champion, at the age of , until Stephen Hendry won the title in 1990. He received £480 prize money for the match, while Spencer received £320, in addition to their earnings from previous rounds. Higgins also received 6,000 cigarettes from the sponsors. The final attracted little press attention; the match report in \"The Times\" ran to only 90 words. Shortly afterwards, however, there was increasing interest, particularly in Higgins, from news media. In March he was the subject of a profile in \"The Sunday People\", and a documentary titled \"Hurricane Higgins\" was broadcast on ITV in September 1972.\nGordon Burn described Higgins's play on the Thursday evening of the final, during which Higgins won all six frames, as \"snooker which, in its insolence, its exuberance, its confidence and its danger, few of those present have ever seen before\". Journalist Donald Trelford wrote of Higgins that \"This thin, pale, hollow-cheeked ex-jockey was something new to the game, cutting through its genteel pretensions like a swordsman.\" Snooker historian Clive Everton told Trelford that after Higgins's victory, \"snooker was never the same again\". Promotions company West and Nally, believing that the emergence of Higgins represented a commercial opportunity, organised a further Park Drive 2000 event. Park Drive sponsored the 1973 World Snooker Championship providing £8,000 in prize money. The 1973 Championship was staged as fortnight-long event rather than a much longer tournament like the 1972 Championship had been, and for the first time, part of the final was televised by the BBC.\nMain draw.\nResults are shown below.

        "text": "Reaper is a restored historic Fifie herring drifter which is registered by the National Historic Ships Committee as part of the National Historic Fleet of the UK, and currently operates as a museum ship.\nHistory.\nBuilt by J. &amp; G. Forbes of Sandhaven in 1901, she is 21 metres long and of carvel construction, using larch planking on larch and oak frames. First registered at Fraserburgh in 1902, she operated initially as a sailing lugger with a main dipping lug sail and a mizzen standing lug sail. There would have been a crew of around eight to work the nets which were set at dusk and hauled in at dawn. Once the haul was complete, a swift return to port would ensure the best prices for the earliest-sold catches.\n\"Reaper\" later spent many years in Shetland fishing for herring in the summer and she was fitted with an engine between the Wars. During World War II she was requisitioned by the Admiralty and served in the southeast of England, often being used as a barrage balloon mooring. After the war, she resumed fishing in Shetland and continued until 1957. She holds the record catch for Shetland of 233 cran (almost 250,000 herrings).\nFrom 1959 she served the local council as a general purpose cargo boat until the introduction of the roll on-roll off ferries when she was retired from service.\n\"Reaper\" today.\n\"Reaper\" was purchased by the Scottish Fisheries Museum in Anstruther, Fife in 1975 and restored to her traditional sailing configuration as a two-masted sailing lugger, much as she would have appeared when first going to sea in 1902. Renamed \"Reaper FR958\", she is one of the last authentic survivors of this type of vessel, once plentiful on the east coast of Scotland.\nListed as part of the National Historic Fleet, she sails regularly in the summer months. When not sailing, the boat is berthed in Anstruther harbour opposite the fisheries museum. In 2003 she visited 14 ports around Britain, attracting 24,000 visitors. In 2005 she visited 12 ports around Britain, including a visit to the Festival of the Sea in Portsmouth, and attracted 20,000 visitors.\nIn 2001, with seven people aboard, she was the centre of an emergency off the coast of northeast England when she began to take on water due to the failure of a bilge pump. A rescue helicopter was scrambled from RAF Boulmer in Northumberland. A lifeboat dispatched from Amble transferred a new pump and escorted her to harbour for repairs.\nIn August 2016 she was blown over and partially submerged in unseasonably strong winds while docked at Johnshaven Harbor in Aberdeenshire.\nMedia.\n\"Reaper\" was portrayed in an episode of the 2010 BBC TV series Boats that Built Britain."

        "text": "The 1981 World Snooker Championship (officially the 1981 Embassy World Snooker Championship) was a ranking professional snooker tournament which took place from 7 April to 20 April 1981 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The tournament was the 1981 edition of the World Snooker Championship, and was the fifth consecutive world championship to take place at the Crucible Theatre since 1977. It was sanctioned by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. The total prize fund for the tournament was £75,000, of which £20,000 went to the winner.\nQualifying rounds for the tournament took place from 23 March to 4 April 1981 at two locations — Redwood Lodge Country Club, near Bristol, and at Romiley Forum, near Stockport. The main stage of the tournament featured 24 players: the top 16 players from the snooker world rankings and another eight players from the qualifying rounds. Jimmy White, Tony Knowles and Dave Martin were debutants at the main stage. The defending champion and top seed in the tournament was Cliff Thorburn, who had defeated Alex Higgins 18–16 in the 1980 final.\nThorburn lost by 10 to 16 to Steve Davis in the semi-finals. In the other semi-final, Doug Mountjoy defeated second seed Ray Reardon 16–10. Davis went on to achieve the first of his six world titles, taking a 6–0 lead in the final and winning four consecutive frames at the end of the match to win 18–12. There were 13 century breaks made during the tournament, including a new championship record break of 145 by Mountjoy. The cigarette manufacturer Embassy sponsored the tournament, which received daily coverage on BBC television.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is the official world championship of the game of snooker. The first world championship final took place in 1927 at Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England. Joe Davis won the inaugural title. Each year since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England.\nThe 1981 tournament brought together 24 professional snooker players, selected through a mix of the snooker world rankings and a pre-tournament qualification competition. Seedings were based on players' performances in the previous three editions of the world championship. The draw for the event took place on 5 January 1981, in West Bromwich. There were a total of eight qualifying groups, each with one winner meeting a player seeded into the first round, followed by the eight winners of the first-round matches meeting one of eight new players seeded into the second round. Despite not winning any major tournament since the 1978 World Snooker Championship, Ray Reardon was the bookmakers' favourite to win at the time of the draw with bets priced at 3–1. Steve Davis was the second-favourite and priced at 5–1, followed by Terry Griffiths and Alex Higgins both priced at 6–1, and defending champion Cliff Thorburn, who had defeated Higgins 18–16 in the 1980 final, at 10–1. Bookmakers assessed Doug Mountjoy's odds of winning as 20–1. By the time the main event started on 7 April, Davis — who during the season had won his first professional title at the 1980 UK Championship, as well as the 1980 Classic, 1981 Yamaha Organs Trophy and 1981 English Professional Championship — had become the bookmakers' favourite to win, at 7–2.\nMike Watterson promoted the championship tournament, with the authority of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). It was broadcast in the United Kingdom on the BBC, with over 80 hours of programming scheduled. Cigarette company Embassy sponsored the event.\nPrize money allocation.\nThe breakdown of prize money for the 1981 tournament is shown below:\nTournament rounds.\nQualifying.\nQualifying matches took place from 23 March to 4 April, and were held at two locations — Redwood Lodge Country Club, near Bristol, and at Romiley Forum, near Stockport. All qualifying matches were scheduled in best-of-17 format with the first player to win nine progressing to the next round. Former champion John Pulman lost 2–9 to Dave Martin, who was accepted by the WPBSA as a professional only a few days before entries closed. Chris Ross — who experienced a nervous breakdown in his first year playing professionally after winning the 1976 English Amateur Championship — found that his was unsteady, and he was unable to control his properly, resulting in his conceding the match to opponent Tony Knowles when 0–7 behind.\nFirst round.\nThe first-round matches took place from 7 to 10 April and were played as best-of-19 frames. Jimmy White, who turned professional after winning the 1980 World Amateur Championship, made his World Snooker Championship debut at the tournament, as did Tony Knowles and Dave Martin.\nSteve Davis made the first century break of the tournament, 119, in the fifth frame of his match against White, while building a 4–2 lead by the end of their first . He compiled another century, 102, in their second session, and led 8–4 by the end of that session. In the last session, White closed the gap to one frame, but from 9–8 ahead, Davis won the next and prevailed 10–8. Knowles constructed a 101 in his match against Graham Miles, but lost the match after being tied at 6–6 and 8–8. In the seventeenth frame, at one frame behind, Knowles played a forceful shot on the , to get a position on the final . He failed to pot the black, which would have left Miles unable to win the frame without Knowles conceding penalty points. Miles won that frame, then took the next to win 10–8.\nDavid Taylor, the 1968 World Amateur Champion, won the first three frames against Cliff Wilson, the 1978 World Amateur Champion, but then lost the next four. Taylor finished the first session 5–4 ahead and went on to defeat Wilson 10–6. Tony Meo was 4–2 ahead, then later 4–5 behind and 7–5 ahead of John Virgo, before securing his progression to the next round 10–6. Meo made a break of 134 during the match. From 5–4, Kirk Stevens won the next five frames to defeat John Dunning 10–4. Doug Mountjoy was a frame ahead of Willie Thorne at 5–4, and extended his lead to 9–4 before winning 10–6. Bill Werbeniuk eliminated Martin 10–4.\nRay Edmonds, twice World Amateur Champion, had never recorded a victory against John Spencer in a significant match and had lost to him twice in the final of the English Amateur Championship, in 1965 and 1966. Edmonds led 5–4 after the first session of their match but then found himself 5–7 behind as Spencer won three consecutive frames. Edmonds equalised the score at 7–7, before Spencer drew ahead again to lead 9–7. Edmonds, aided by fluking a , won the next two frames to force the match to go to a deciding frame. Jack Karnehm, a snooker commentator and author, later suggested that Spencer was able to win the last frame, in which he made a break of 38, because he had the ability to handle pressure better than Edmonds did.\nSecond round.\nThe second-round matches took place from 10 to 14 April and were played as best-of-25 frames.\nSteve Davis led 6–2 against Alex Higgins after their first session, but in the second session Davis lost five of the eight frames and made only one break over 30. By the end of the session, Davis led by two frames, 9–7. In the third session, Higgins made a break of 47 in the first frame, but Davis responded with a 45 break and won the frame to move into a three-frame lead rather than having only a one-frame advantage, saying afterwards that his 45 was \"the most important break [he had] made for months.\" Higgins won the second frame of the session before Davis won the third with a break of 71. Davis then took the next two frames for a 13–9 victory. Doug Mountjoy took the first four frames, then lost the next four, against Eddie Charlton. Mountjoy went on to lead 9–6, and won 13–7 to reach his first world championship quarter-final since 1977.\nGraham Miles only gained a single frame in each of the two sessions against defending champion Cliff Thorburn. He lost the first session 1–7 and the match 2–13. Eight-time former world snooker champion Fred Davis, who was also the reigning world billiards champion, also lost his first session 1–7, and was eliminated 3–13 by David Taylor. Terry Griffiths and Tony Meo finished their first session all-square at 4–4, but Griffiths added nine of the next eleven frames to his tally, and won 13–6.\nDennis Taylor went from 9–11 against Kirk Stevens to progress to the next round with a 13–11 scoreline; he compiled breaks of 135 and 133 during the match. Stevens had been unable to use the practice table at the venue before the match because it was being used to record a programme for a television broadcast. According to Karnehm, Stevens was \"frustrated and bitterly hot-tempered when he came out for the second session... his pots missed by fractions, his safety shots would unluckily stay in the open, his judgement was becoming erratic.\" Bill Werbeniuk led Perrie Mans 6–2 after their first session, and went on to win 13–5. Former champions Ray Reardon and John Spencer were level at 11–11, with Reardon then winning 13–11.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe tournament's quarter-final matches took place from 10 to 12 April and were played as best-of-25 frames. Steve Davis and Terry Griffiths shared the first eight frames, finishing their first session 4–4. After that, Davis pulled ahead to 9–5, Griffiths compiled a break of 100 in the first frame of the third session, making the scoreline 6–9. The players then won alternate frames until Davis took the match 13–9. Snooker historian Clive Everton later wrote that \"strongly as the opposition resisted, Davis never really looked like being broken\". David Taylor, who had lost to Cliff Thorburn in the semi-finals in 1980, won two of the first three frames in their quarter-final. Taylor took a lead of 4–3, but Thorburn then had the better of the second session, establishing a 10–6 advantage. He eliminated Taylor 13–6. Doug Mountjoy was 5–3 ahead of Dennis Taylor, before falling 5–6 behind, and defeated Taylor 13–8. The highest break of the match was 100, by Thorburn in the 15th frame. Ray Reardon defeated Bill Werbeniuk 13–8, to reach his first semi-final since 1978, and compiled a 112 break in the 16th frame.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-final matches took place from 17 to 18 April and were played as best-of-31 frames. Doug Mountjoy made a new record world snooker championship break of 145 in the 12th frame against Ray Reardon, pocketing blacks after all reds except the eighth, when he potted the . Mountjoy won the match 16–10. Everton's analysis was that whilst in previous matches between the players Reardon had been able to prevail due to his superior tactics, by 1981 Mountjoy's tactical capacity had improved greatly, and his break-building was better than Reardon's.\nThe second semi-final match, which was played between Davis and Thorburn, was described by Karnehm as the best of the 1981 World Championship. Two weeks before the tournament, Thorburn lost 0–6 to Davis in a challenge match in Romford, Davis's home area. According to Karnehm, Thorburn \"was still seething at this result and the remarks of the gloating Romford fans in their own stronghold.\" According to Karnehm, the players barely acknowledged each other's presence in the first session of the semi-final. Davis went 4–3 ahead of Thorburn after the first session, extending his lead to 6–4 after the break, but went 6–8 behind as Thorburn won four frames in succession, scoring 347 points across these frames to Davis's 35. It was level at 9–9, before Davis won 16–10. In the 22nd frame, Davis was ahead with a score of 80–23 with only the pink and black remaining, leaving Thorburn no realistic chance of winning the frame. However, when Davis offered Thorburn a handshake, the acceptance of which would have been an acknowledgement by Thorburn that the frame was lost, Thorburn declined, started to aim for the pink, and \"in an elaborate mockery of the Steve Davis habit, went over to his chair, [and] took a minute sip of water.\" Thorburn later apologised for this behaviour to Davis and, on television, to the public. In his autobiography, \"Playing for Keeps\" (1987), Thorburn wrote that in the third session he had been distracted by Davis's supporters in the arena whistling when he was playing, and that he was frustrated that Davis did nothing to stop this.\nFinal.\nThe final was played across four sessions on 19 and 20 April as a best-of-35 frames match. It was the first world professional snooker championship final for both players, Steve Davis and Doug Mountjoy. Mountjoy led 40–0 in points in the first frame, but Davis made a break of 59 to win the frame. Davis went on to take all of the first six frames, making breaks of 52, 49, 56, and 40. In the eighth frame, Davis was 49–48 ahead with only the last three balls left on the table. The black ball was very close to the , with the blue ball nearby. The two players had a total of 37 turns playing whilst three were left, before the frame was abandoned and restarted due to the stalemate. Mountjoy won the restarted frame with a break of 76 – which was the highest of the first session. Mountjoy won the last frame of the first session, leaving Davis 6–3 ahead.\nIn the second session, Davis won the first frame, then Mountjoy the next two, and Davis took the following one, leaving Davis 8–5 ahead at the mid-session interval. Mountjoy compiled a break of 129, his fourth century of the event, in frame 14, and a couple of frames later, Davis fluked the blue to win the 17th. Mountjoy won the last frame of the second session to finish 8–10 behind.\nOn the second day of the final, Davis compiled a break of 83 to win the first frame and took the next frame, making it 12–8. Mountjoy then won two consecutive frames to halve Davis's lead. He subsequently won two of the session's last four frames to leave Davis 14–12 ahead of the fourth and final session. Mountjoy led by 46 points in the 24th frame before Davis made a break of 55 to win it. Davis made a break of 84 in the first frame of the fourth session, followed by a break of 119 in the second, and won the next two frames to defeat Mountjoy 18–12. After his win, Davis's manager Barry Hearn ran excitedly into the arena, lifting Davis in celebration. In a post-match interview, Mountjoy said of Davis, \"He's the player to beat from now on. The top players are all on a par, but he is a black better.\"\nIt was the first of a total of six World Snooker Championship wins for Davis as he dominated the sport in the 1980s, the last of them in 1989. In 1982, the number of players in the main tournament increased to 32; the level of public interest in the 1981 tournament was high enough for the BBC to decide to increase its television coverage to 17 days, the full duration of the championship, in 1982.\nMain draw.\nThe tournament ladder and results are shown below. The numbers in brackets to the right of players' names indicate the top 16 seeds, whilst match winners are noted by bold type.\nFinal.\nThe final was played as a best-of-35 frames match at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, on 19 and 20 April 1981, refereed by John Williams. Two sessions were held each day. Davis won the match by 18 frames to 12. Both players compiled one century break during the final; Mountjoy compiled a 129, and Davis made a 119. Davis had a further eight breaks of fifty or more, against two by Mountjoy.\nQualifying matches.\nThe results from the qualifying competition are shown below with match winners shown in bold type.\nQualifying matches were held at Redwood Lodge Country Club, near Bristol, and at Romiley Forum, Stockport.\nCentury breaks.\nThere were 13 century breaks during the championship, equalling the record from 1979. Mountjoy set a World Championship record by compiling a 145 break, surpassing the 142 breaks by Rex Williams in 1965 and Bill Werbeniuk in 1979. Mountjoy earned a £5,000 bonus for his achievement, and his record stood until the 1983 tournament, when Thorburn compiled a maximum break."

        "text": "The 1980 World Snooker Championship, officially known as the 1980 Embassy World Snooker Championship for sponsorship reasons, was a ranking professional snooker tournament that took place from 22 April to 5 May 1980 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The tournament was the 1980 edition of the World Snooker Championship and was the fourth consecutive world championship to take place at the Crucible Theatre since 1977. It was authorised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. The total prize fund for the tournament was £60,000, of which £15,000 went to the winner.\nThere were 53 entrants to the competition, although four later withdrew. Qualifying rounds for the tournament took place at Romiley Forum, Stockport, from 5 to 18 April 1980; at the Redwood Lodge Country Club, Bristol, from 11 to 16 April; and at Sheffield Snooker Centre from 12 to 17 April. The main stage of the tournament featured 24 players: the top 16 players from the snooker world rankings and another eight players from the qualifying rounds. Ray Edmonds, Jim Meadowcroft, Tony Meo, Cliff Wilson and Jim Wych made their Crucible debuts. The defending champion and top seed in the tournament was Terry Griffiths, who had defeated Dennis Taylor 24–16 in the 1979 final.\nGriffiths lost in his first match, by 10 to 13 against Steve Davis. Canadian Cliff Thorburn met the 1972 champion Alex Higgins from Northern Ireland in the final, which was a best-of-35-frames match. Thorburn won the match 18–16 to become the first world champion from outside the United Kingdom in the sport's modern era. There were 11 century breaks compiled during the championship, the highest of which was 136, achieved by both Kirk Stevens and Steve Davis. The cigarette manufacturer Embassy sponsored the tournament. It received 70 hours of television coverage by the BBC in the United Kingdom, attracting 14.5 million viewers for the conclusion of the final. Coverage of the final was interrupted by the broadcast of live coverage of the Iranian Embassy Siege, which caused numerous viewers to complain to the broadcaster.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is the preeminent tournament in professional snooker. Joe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, organised by the Billiards Association and Control Council, the final match being held at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England. Staged annually until 1940, the tournament was put on hiatus during World War II and went into decline in the post-war era; the 1952 World Snooker Championship was contested by only two players and was replaced by the World Professional Match-play Championship, which was also discontinued in 1957. The title was contested on an occasional challenge basis until 1969, when the World Championship reverted to a knockout tournament format. Staged annually since then, the tournament moved in 1977 to the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, which remains the venue for the tournament as of 2023. The 1980 event, organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), was the fourth edition of the World Championship to be staged at the Crucible.\nThe 1980 championship featured 24 professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single-elimination format, each match played over several . The number of participants who played at the Crucible was increased from 16 in 1979. The competitors in the main tournament were selected using a combination of the top players in the world rankings, which were based on performances at the three preceding editions of the world championship, and the winners of a pre-tournament qualification stage. In all, 53 players entered the championship, but four later withdrew. The top eight seeded players were placed in round two of the draw. The next eight seeds were placed in round one, each to meet a player that emerged from the qualifying competition. At the start of the main event, defending champion Terry Griffiths and six-time champion Ray Reardon were joint bookmakers' favourites, both priced at 3–1, with Alex Higgins the third-favourite priced at 7–1.\nThe duration of the event, which had been 13 days in each of the three previous years, was increased to 14 days, with the semi-finals being reduced to best-of-31 frames (from best-of-37 in 1979) and the final to the best-of-35 frames (from best-of-47 in 1979). There had been a third place playoff in 1978 and 1979, but this was not continued in 1980. The competition was promoted by Mike Watterson and received 70 hours of television coverage by the BBC in the United Kingdom, attracting 14.5 million viewers for the conclusion of the final. The tournament was a ranking event and was sponsored by cigarette company Embassy.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below: \nTournament summary.\nQualifying.\nQualifying matches took place across three venues: at Romiley Forum, Stockport, from 5 April to 18 April 1980; at the Redwood Lodge Country Club, Bristol, from 11 April to 16 April; and at Sheffield Snooker Centre from 12 April to 17 April 1980. The qualifying rounds produced eight players who progressed to the main event, where they met the 16 invited seeded players.\nThe 1957 runner-up Jackie Rea defeated Bernard Bennett 9–1 before being eliminated 1–9 by Willie Thorne. Thorne was on course to make a maximum break in the first frame but missed a after eleven and ten blacks. Steve Davis qualified after defeating Chris Ross 9–3 and Paddy Morgan 9–0. Kingsley Kennerley, in his first competitive match since 1974, lost 2–9 to Mike Hallett. Pat Houlihan, playing without his contact lenses due to conjunctivitis, compiled the only century break of the qualifying rounds—108—during a 9–6 victory over Joe Johnson; however he lost 1–9 in his following match to Tony Meo. Jim Wych progressed to the main event with a 9–7 win against Rex Williams, the world champion of English billiards.\nFirst round.\nThe first round took place between 22 and 25 April, each match played over either two or three scheduled sessions as the best of 19 frames. Meo, Wych, Cliff Wilson, Ray Edmonds, and Jim Meadowcroft made their Crucible debuts. Steve Davis led Patsy Fagan 6–3 after their first session and won 10–6. Fagan had led 2–0 but, from 5–6, lost four of the following five frames. Meo was 5–4 ahead of Higgins after their first session and, at 9–8, was a frame away from winning before Higgins took the last two frames with breaks of 77 and 62 to progress. Kirk Stevens compiled a break of 136 in the third frame against Graham Miles, missing the final black that would have made it an all-time championship record 143. After leading Miles 6–0 then 9–3 after the first two sessions, Stevens won 10–3. John Virgo won all six frames of his first session against Meadowcroft, with Meadowcroft winning two of the first three frames in the second session before being eliminated 2–10.\nWilson, the reigning World Amateur Snooker Champion, won the first frame against Doug Mountjoy on the black as part of a 66 clearance and took a 4–1 lead before finishing the first session at 5–4. Wilson then lost six of the last seven frames, resulting in a 6–10 loss. Mountjoy recorded a break of 104 in the fourteenth frame. Wych won 10–5 against former champion John Pulman after leading 5–4. This was Pulman's final appearance at the World Championship. Edmonds had replaced his the night before the match; playing with the unfamiliar tip, he lost the first four frames, then went 2–7 behind David Taylor before losing 3–10. Thorne, having led 3–1, took a 5–4 lead over Bill Werbeniuk with a 97 break in the ninth frame. He led in the match until Werbeniuk, who compiled a break of 101 in the thirteenth frame, made it 7–7. The contest went to a which Werbeniuk won 84–8 with breaks of 39 and 36.\nSecond round.\nThe second round, which took place between 24 and 29 April, was played as best-of-25-frames matches spread over three sessions. Defending champion Griffiths lost the first seven frames against Steve Davis and ended the first session trailing 1–7. Davis won the opening frame of the second session to extend his lead to 8–1, and had a seven frame lead again at 10–3, before Griffiths won three frames to end the session 6–10 behind. In the third session, Griffiths won the first four frames to level at 10–10, with Davis then winning the next three to secure a 13–10 victory, which included a 116 break in the 22nd frame. The failure of first-time world snooker champions to defend their title has become known as the \"Crucible curse\".\nHiggins won six of the eight frames in each of the first two sessions against Perrie Mans and eliminated Mans 13–6. Despite leading 4–1 after making breaks of 95 and 108 in consecutive frames, former champion John Spencer lost in his first match for the third consecutive year, 8–13 to Stevens. Virgo took an early lead of 4–1 against Eddie Charlton, with their first session finishing 4–4. At 11–10 ahead, Virgo missed a pot on the , and Charlton then levelled the match 11–11. The match went to a deciding frame, where Charlton made a break of 33, and Virgo missed a black that allowed Charlton back in to win 13–12. The report in \"Snooker Scene\" characterised the match as one where the \"famed tenacity\" of Charlton overcame the \"brittle, edgy side of Virgo's temperament\".\nCliff Thorburn finished the first session against Mountjoy 3–5 behind. In the evening, Thorburn played cards and drank alcohol with friends until 5:00 am, resuming the match by winning the first five frames in succession and going on to win 13–10. From 10–10 Thorburn won two frames on the and one on the black. The match featured a 69-minute 18th frame, including 21 minutes for the brown ball to be potted, and a 123 break in the 19th frame by Mountjoy, The previous year's runner-up Dennis Taylor was eliminated by Wych, who won the first three frames, and, after Taylor had equalised, took the seventh frame on a . The pair were level again at 8–8 before Wych won 13–10. Ray Reardon had session-end leads of 5–3 and 11–5 against Werbeniuk, and won 13–6. Fred Davis compiled a 106 break, the highest of the match, but lost 5–13 to David Taylor.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played as best-of-25-frames matches over three sessions on 29 and 30 April. Davis compiled a 136 break in the third frame against Higgins. In the eighth frame, Higgins was on course to achieve a maximum break, when he became the first player in the history of the world championship to pot black balls after each of the fifteen red balls during a break. After running out of position on the fifteenth black, he managed to pot the , but failed in an attempt to then the . The pair finished their first session tied at 4–4. In the second session, the players were level at 7–7 before Higgins won the next two frames to carry a 9–7 lead into the last session, in which he won the match 13–9. It was the first time that Higgins had reached the semi-finals since 1976.\nHaving lost the first two frames to Wych, Thorburn built a 5–3 lead at the end of their first session and, after having led 9–3 and 10–6, progressed 13–6. With Stevens's \"all-out attacking\" play featuring \"brilliant\" potting, according to snooker historian Clive Everton, he was 5–3 and 10–6 in front of Charlton after the first and second sessions, and won 13–7, becoming the youngest-ever world championship semi-finalist, aged 21. Reardon had three breaks over 40 in the first frame against Taylor and won three of the next four for 4–1 before losing the next two and then finishing the first session 5–3 up. He extended his lead to 7–3, but Taylor then won six successive frames leaving Reardon 7–9 behind at the start of the last session. Taylor added a frame, but Reardon tied at 10–10 by winning the next three. From 11 to 11, Reardon missed several shots as Taylor won 13–11 for what \"Snooker Scene\" described in their match report as \"the best win of his career\".\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals took place between 1 and 3 May as best-of-31-frames matches played over four sessions. Stevens led 5–2 against Higgins after winning four frames in a row from 1–2. Their second session finished at 7–7. Stevens made a number of mistakes during the third session, including missing a black from its spot when he was 8–9 behind and the session ended with him 9–13 in arrears. Higgins won the first frame of the fourth session. Stevens successfully potted a number of long-distance shots in taking the next two frames. He then won the 26th frame on the black to make it 12–14. Although Higgins appeared tense, he won the 27th frame on the pink and went on to secure a 16–13 victory.\nThorburn was 5–3 ahead of Taylor after their first session and, having won eight consecutive frames to lead 10–3, was 11–4 up at the end of the second session. Thorburn extended his lead to 15–7 by the end of the third session, then won 16–7 with a break of 114 in the 23rd frame.\nFinal.\nThe final, between Canadian Cliff Thorburn and Alex Higgins from Northern Ireland, took place on 4 and 5 May, as a best-of-35 frames match scheduled for four sessions. Higgins and Thorburn had an ongoing rivalry during their playing careers and were perceived as adversaries. Thorburn became the first player to reach a second final at the Crucible; he lost to Spencer in the first final played at the Crucible, in 1977. After Thorburn won the first frame, Higgins won the next five. Thorburn won the seventh to make it 5–2, with Higgins complaining after the frame that Thorburn had been standing in his line of sight, a claim that author and sports statistician Ian Morrison called \"unfounded\". Higgins led 6–3 at the end of the first session, extending this to 9–5 before Thorburn levelled the match at 9–9. Writing in \"The Times\", Sydney Friskin described the match to this point as a contrast of styles: \"the shrewd cumulative processes of Thorburn against the explosive break-building of Higgins\". He also noted that each player had accused the other of distracting them during the match. Thorburn won the 19th and 20th frames, with Higgins taking the following two to level at 11–11. Thorburn went ahead at 12–11 and 13–12, with Higgins then levelling the match both times, with the third session ending 13–13. In the final session, Higgins won the first frame; Thorburn then won the next two before Higgins equalised at 15–15. Thorburn led 16–15 and missed a brown ball that let Higgins in to make it 16–16. With a break of 119, Thorburn moved within a frame of victory at 17–16. In the 34th frame, leading 45–9 in points, he laid a for Higgins, and made a 51 break after that to win the title.\nThe BBC's television coverage of the final had been interrupted by the broadcast of live coverage of the Iranian Embassy Siege, which caused numerous viewers to complain to the broadcaster. The conclusion of the final was watched by 14.5 million television viewers. Thorburn is generally regarded as the first player from outside Britain to win the world championship, with Horace Lindrum's victory in the 1952 World Snooker Championship usually being disregarded. After the match, Higgins said of Thorburn, \"he's a grinder\", and the nickname \"The Grinder\" was subsequently associated with Thorburn, seen as apt for his slow, determined style of play. Higgins also posed for pictures with a cake decorated with icing reading \"World Champion 1980\" that his wife Lynne had brought for him. In the snooker world rankings 1980/1981, based on the results at the three world championships from 1978 to 1980, Thorburn was ranked second (behind Reardon) and Higgins was placed fourth. Higgins won a second world championship in 1982, and Thorburn made the World Championship's first maximum break in 1983.\nMain draw.\nThe results for the tournament are shown below.

As a member of the inaugural Mariners team, McMillan, a shortstop, went hitless in five at-bats. The majority of his career was spent in the minor leagues. After he was drafted out of Jacksonville University by the Cleveland Indians during the 1973 Major League Baseball Draft, McMillan made his professional debut that year with the Double-A San Antonio Brewers.\nOver his minor league career, McMillan played with the Double-A San Antonio Brewers (1973), Triple-A Oklahoma City 89ers (1973–75), the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens (1976), the Triple-A Iowa Oaks (1976), the Triple-A New Orleans Pelicans (1977), the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings (1977), the Triple-A San Jose Missions (1977), and the Double-A Buffalo Bisons (1978). In 711 minor league career games, McMillan batted .252 with 591 hits, 74 doubles, 24 triples, and 10 home runs.\nEarly life.\nMcMillan was born on September 13, 1951, in Richmond, Virginia. He attended Jacksonville University from 1970 to 1973, where he played college baseball for the Dolphins under head coach Barry Myers. McMillan played shortstop on the school's baseball team. In the winter of 1972, McMillan played with the United States national baseball team during the Amateur World Series in Managua, Nicaragua. During the series, he batted .308 with 20 hits, 15 runs, five doubles and six stolen bases. The U.S. team went on to place second. McMillan was the only member of the U.S. team to win All-World honors. After the 1972 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star. During his senior season, McMillan batted .305 with 57 hits, four home runs, and 28 stolen bases. He set a school record for career stolen bases with 141, almost doubling the previous record. During the second round of the 1973 Major League Baseball Draft, McMillan was drafted by the Cleveland Indians.\nProfessional career.\n1973–76 seasons.\nAfter being drafted by the Cleveland Indians in 1973, McMillan made his professional baseball debut that season in the Indians minor league organization, playing with the Double-A San Antonio Brewers of the Texas League.

At the time of his debut, he became the first attendee of Jacksonville University to make an MLB debut. His offensive debut would come on September 21, against the Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium. In five at-bats, McMillan went hitless. It would prove to be his final MLB game. Defensively during his two games with the Mariners, McMillan played shortstop, committing no errors, while making one assist and two putouts.\nLater career.\nIn 1978, McMillan played the entire season in the minor leagues with the San Jose Missions, who were the Seattle Mariners Triple-A affiliate at the time. With the Missions, McMillan batted .256 with 38 runs scored, 83 hits, 13 doubles, three triples, one home run, 27 RBIs, and 21 stolen bases.

He was traded along with Enrique Romo and Rick Jones from the Mariners to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Mario Mendoza, Odell Jones and Rafael Vásquez at the Winter Meetings on December 5, 1978. McMillan's final season in professional baseball came in 1979, as a member of the Pirates' Double-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons.
