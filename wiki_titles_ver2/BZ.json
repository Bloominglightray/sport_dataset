He played in 149 NHL games with the New York Islanders, Boston Bruins, and Buffalo Sabres. In 2017, Taylor was named the head coach of the Rochester Americans in the American Hockey League, the affiliate of the Buffalo Sabres. In 2019, he was recalled by the Sabres as an assistant coach on an interim basis and returned to the Americans in late November, staying until June 2020.\nPlaying career.\nTaylor had an impressive junior career with the London Knights, ending his tenure with the team as their all-time points leader with 378 (later surpassed by Corey Perry with 380 points) and was drafted by the New York Islanders in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft (2nd round, 27th overall) He then played for the Islanders, Boston Bruins, and Buffalo Sabres in the National Hockey League, but was frequently sent between the NHL and the minor leagues before going overseas with the Frankfurt Lions of Germany's Deutsche Eishockey Liga before the 2006–07 season.\nOn July 16, 2009, Taylor agreed to a two-year contract with the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League, a team he had played for from 1999 to 2006 while he was signed to their NHL affiliate, the Buffalo Sabres.\nCoaching career.\nOn August 31, 2011, the Rochester Americans announced that Taylor had been hired as their development coach for the 2011–12 season.

The 100 metre freestyle race was the first of the swimming events. Six swimmers entered the race: the two competitors from Austria-Hungary finished first and second, though there is no record of the places of the other four competitors. \nAlfréd Hajós of Hungary beat Otto Herschmann of Austria by half a metre in a close contest, with the other swimmers far behind. While the Hungarian flag was hoisted, the band began to play the Austrian anthem (Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser) until the Hungarian sang the Hungarian anthem (Himnusz).\nBackground.\nThis was the first appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nAlfréd Hajós was the 1895 European champion.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition involved a single race, with all swimmers competing at the same time. The swimmers were taken out by ship into the bay, where they would swim toward shore. Buoys marked the starting line, hollow pumpkins (which tended to move) marked the course, and a red flag marked the finish line.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in metres) prior to the 1896 Summer Olympics.\nThe following record was established during the competition:\nSchedule.\nThe 100 metres freestyle was the first of the swimming events."

        "title": "Rugby union in Ireland",
        "text": "Rugby union () is a popular team sport on the island of Ireland, organised on an all-Ireland basis, including players and teams from both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Its governing body, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), was founded in 1879, making it the third oldest rugby union in the world after the RFU (England) and the SRU (Scotland).\nThe Ireland national team is currently third in the World Rugby Rankings, and has won the Six Nations Championship (and its predecessor competitions) fifteen times, including four Grand Slams, the most recent being a Grand Slam in 2023..Ireland has appeared at every men's Rugby World Cup but never advanced beyond the quarter-final.\nIreland has four professional teams, organised by the four provincial unions that make up the IRFU, Leinster, Munster, Ulster and Connacht, who compete in the United Rugby Championship, the European Rugby Champions Cup and the EPCR Challenge Cup. Munster are the reigning champions of the 2022–23 United Rugby Championship, while Leinster are the most successful side historically. Irish provinces have had considerable success in European competition, with seven European Rugby Champions Cups and one Challenge Cup win. \nAt the local level, fifty club sides compete in the five divisions of the All-Ireland League, of which Terenure College RFC are the current champions.\nThe Ireland women's rugby union team compete in the Women's Six Nations, WXV and the women's Rugby World Cup, while women's teams from Ireland compete in the women's inter-provincial rugby championship and the cross-border 'Celtic Challenge' competition with sides from Scotland and Wales.\nGoverning body.\nThe Irish Rugby Football union was formed in 1879, after the merger of the Irish Football Union, which controlled rugby in Leinster, Munster and parts of Ulster, and the Northern Football Union of Ireland, which controlled in the game in the Belfast area. As part of this amalgamation, the IRFU established three provincial branches to run the game in Leinster, Munster and Ulster; a fourth branch was founded for Connacht in 1885. The IRFU was a founding member of the International Rugby Board (now called World Rugby) in 1986. Despite the partition of Ireland in 1921, the IRFU continues to run the game on an all-island basis.\nInternational rugby.\nThe Ireland national team represents the whole Island of Ireland, selecting players from both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Its first international match was a 7-0 defeat by England in 1875.\nSince 1995 the Ireland national team has been fully professional. They play their home games at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. They compete in the annual Six Nations Championship, the four-yearly Rugby World Cup, and various mid-year and autumn international matches.\nThe national team has won several Triple Crowns and three Grand Slams and is able to play at a competitive level with the world's rugby giants, having beaten all including New Zealand in the last five years.\nDevelopment teams.\nAs with all top-tier rugby nations, and many lower-tier countries, Ireland field an \"A\" national side, a second-level national selection primarily intended to develop younger talent for possible future duty on the senior national team. Since February 2010, the IRFU have rebranded the A side as Ireland Wolfhounds. The Wolfhounds generally play \"A\" teams of the other major European powers and senior sides of lower-tier nations. Ireland also field an occasional development team, Emerging Ireland, used to try out promising young players. The Ireland national under-20 rugby union team competes in the annual Six Nations Under 20s Championship and World Rugby U20 Championship tournaments. The Ireland national schoolboy rugby union team competes in the Rugby Europe Under-18 Championship.\nIQ Rugby (formerly the Irish Exiles) is a development programme to identify potential Ireland players from the Irish diaspora.\nIreland Sevens.\nThe Ireland national rugby sevens team competes in the World Rugby Sevens Series and the Rugby World Cup Sevens. Unlike the national team, sevens players are not selected from the provincial teams, although some go on to play for the provincial teams.\nIreland Women.\nThe Irish Women's Rugby Football Union (IWRFU) was founded in 1991, and the Ireland women's national rugby union team made their international debut in 1993. The IWRFU became affiliated to the IRFU in 2001, and was incorporated into the IRFU in 2008. The Ireland women's team have competed in the Women's Rugby World Cup since its second edition in 1994, and the Women's Six Nations Championship (and its predecessor competitions) since 1996. Ireland hosted the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup, and lost to Wales 17–27 in the eighth place play off.\nProvincial rugby.\nThe four branches of the IRFU each organise a provincial team: Leinster, based at the RDS Arena in Dublin; Munster, based at Thomond Park in Limerick; Ulster, based at Ravenhill in Belfast; and Connacht, based at the Sportsgrounds in Galway. In the amateur era, they were representative teams, selected from the best club players in the province, and competed in the annual IRFU Interprovincial Championship, as well as playing against international touring teams. After rugby union was declared open to professionalism in 1995, they were developed into professional teams.\nToday, they compete in the United Rugby Championship (URC) alongside teams from Scotland, Wales, Italy and South Africa, and the European Rugby Champions Cup and EPCR Challenge Cup, which also include teams from France and England. All four provinces have been champions of the URC (or its predecessor competitions), Leinster eight times, most recently in 2021; Munster four times, most recently in 2023; Ulster once in 2006; and Connacht once in 2016. Leinster have won the Champions Cup four times, most recently in 2018; Munster twice, most recently in 2008; and Ulster once in 1999. Leinster have won the Challenge Cup once, in 2012.\nTo encourage the development of Irish talent, the provinces are allowed only three non-Irish-qualified players in their squads. Each province has an academy programme to develop young players from local schools and clubs to professional level. Regular internationals are signed on central contracts to the IRFU, meaning that they, and not the provinces, control when the players play and when they rest.\nEach province also has a women's team which competes in the annual IRFU Women's Interprovincial Series.\nClub rugby.\nSince 1990, the top club sides in Ireland have competed in the All-Ireland League. It originally featured nineteen clubs in two divisions, and currently has fifty clubs in five divisions, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B and 2C, with promotion and relegation between them. The bottom team in Division 2C is relegated to their province's Junior League. Playoffs are held between the winners of the four provincial Junior Leagues to decide who will replace them. The Bateman Cup is played for annually by the winners of the provincial Senior Cups. The Women's All-Ireland League was founded in 1992 has one division containing nine clubs. The provincial branches each organise a pyramid of league and cup competitions for both men's and women's teams. \nSchools rugby.\nEach province has a senior schools' tournament: the Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup; the Munster Schools Rugby Senior Cup; the Ulster Schools' Cup; and the Connacht Schools Rugby Senior Cup; and an under-15 tournament: the Leinster Schools Junior Cup; the Munster Schools Junior Cup; the Ulster Medallion Shield; and the Connacht Schools Junior Cup.\nDemographics.\nPlaying numbers.\nThe last report on the number of players playing rugby union conducted by World Rugby in 2019 showed 79,000 registered players (ie those registered with clubs, including the 21,000 adult players) and an overall total of 196,000, incorporating women’ players, schools, sevens etc.\nStadiums and attendance.\nThe professional era and the advent of the competitions now known as United Rugby Championship and the European Rugby Champions Cup have seen rugby union become a major spectator sport in Ireland. European Cup games are generally well supported in all the provinces, with sellouts the norm and massive crowds in Dublin's Lansdowne Road for quarterfinal and semifinal matches. Ulster, Munster and Leinster have all won the Heineken Cup. In the past Ulster led the then-Celtic League attendances for 3 years in the row and Connacht, Munster and Leinster's crowds have grown year on year and with the later two setting new world records for province/club attendance.\nMunster extensively renovated and expanded their traditional home of Thomond Park in a project that was completed in 2008. The Royal Dublin Society expanded their RDS Arena in the same time period, which prompted Leinster to make it their primary home while they were planning to expand their own traditional ground at Donnybrook. After the Donnybrook plans fell through, Leinster chose to remain at the RDS and in 2023 Leinster embarked on renovation plans to increase the capacity of the arena. Connacht completed ground expansion and renovation works in time for the 2011/2012 season with the construction of the Clan Terrace. And in 2014, Ulster completed the complete reconstruction of Ravenhill Stadium into a modern 18,000 capacity stadium. Munster are currently in the process of construing a new stand at their secondary home of Musgrave Park.\nBefore the opening of Aviva Stadium, Ireland international games sold out against all but the weakest opposition, and with the team playing at Croke Park during the reconstruction of Lansdowne Road, attendances regularly topped 80,000. However, the Aviva saw disappointing attendance during its first Tests in 2010, with no match selling out; media reports indicated that this was largely due to an IRFU ticketing strategy that made little sense in an uncertain economy. More recent Tests have seen crowds much closer to capacity, including sellouts or near-sellouts for all of Ireland's Six Nations home fixtures.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nRugby clubs started to appear in Ireland in the mid-19th century. Dublin University Football Club was in existence by 1855, giving it a strong claim to being the world's oldest extant football club of any code. Other early clubs still in existence include Wanderers (founded 1869), Queen's University (1869), Lansdowne (1873), Dungannon (1873) and University College Cork (1874). Ballinasloe, founded in 1875, merged with Athlone in 1994 to form Buccaneers; North of Ireland, founded in 1868, merged with Collegians in 1999 to form Belfast Harlequins. \nThe Irish Football Union was founded to govern the game in Leinster, Munster and parts of Ulster in December 1874. The Northern Football Union of Ireland was founded in January 1875, and controlled the game in the Belfast area The two unions amalgamated to form the IRFU in 1879, but not before the first interprovincial match, between Ulster and Leinster, and Ireland's first international match against England, both in 1875. Ireland played their home games at Lansdowne Road in Dublin from 1878. The earliest competitions include the Ulster Schools' Cup, first held in 1876, and the Dublin Hospitals Rugby Cup, first held in 1881.\nThe amateur era.\nClub rugby.\nThe Leinster Challenge Cup, later known as the Leinster Senior Cup, was first played in 1882, won by Dublin University. Senior Cup competitions followed in the other provinces: the Ulster Senior Cup was first won by North of Ireland in 1885; the Munster Senior Cup was first won by Bandon in 1886; and the Connacht Senior Cup was first won by Galway Town in 1896. Ulster was the first province to establish a provincial league, the Ulster Senior League, first won by Queen's in 1891. The Munster Senior League followed, first won by Garryowen in 1903; the Connacht Senior League was first won by Galwegians in 1926; the Leinster Senior League was not founded until 1971, and was first won by St. Mary's College in 1972. The All-Ireland League, featuring clubs from all four provinces, was founded in 1990, and was first won by Cork Constitution.\nProvincial rugby.\nThe IRFU Interprovincial Championship, between the provincial representative teams of Ulster, Leinster, Munster and Connacht, was first played in 1946, with Ulster being the first champions.\nInternational rugby.\nThe Home Nations Championship, ancestor of today's Six Nations Championship, was first played in 1883, between the Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales national teams. It became the Five Nations Championship in 1910 with the addition of France. Ireland first won the competition in 1926, jointly with Scotland. Their first outright win, and Grand Slam, came in 1948.\nThe Rugby World Cup was first held in 1987; Ireland were knocked out by Australia in the quarter-finals. In the 1991 Rugby World Cup, they again went out to Australia in the quarter-finals. In the final World Cup of the amateur era in 1995 they were knocked out in the quarter-finals once more, this time by France.\nIreland's most capped players of the amateur era include North of Ireland centre Mike Gibson (69), Ballymena lock Willie John McBride (63), Blackrock flanker Fergus Slattery (61), Dungannon lock Paddy Johns (59), and Old Wesley prop Philip Orr (58). Dublin University centre Brendan Mullin is Ireland's top try scorer of the amateur era with 17; Dolphin centre Michael Kiernan is top points scorer with 308.\nThe professional era.\nOn 26 August 1995, rugby union was declared open to professionalism by the International Rugby Board. The IRFU had been opposed to this, and rugby in Ireland was poorly prepared for professionalism. Amid fears that Irish players could be signed up by English clubs, they began by offering contracts to international players.\nProvincial rugby.\nThe Heineken Cup, now known as the European Rugby Champions Cup, was launched the same year. Ireland was given three places, and rather than enter clubs, the IRFU entered three of the four provincial teams, Munster, Ulster and Leinster. This led to the development of the provincial sides as professional teams, starting with match fees, and later contracts for provincial players. Ulster won the competition in 1999. Munster have won it twice, in 2006 and 2008, and Leinster four times, in 2009, 2011, 2012 (defeating Ulster), and 2018. In addition, Leinster won the European Challenge Cup in 2013 after having parachuted in from that season's Heineken Cup. \nThe Celtic League, featuring all four Irish provinces alongside teams from Scotland and Wales, was launched in 2001. The IRFU Interprovincial Championship was discontinued. The League expanded to a 22-match schedule in 2003, and for the first time the Irish provinces could operate as full-time professional teams, with players only rarely able to play for their clubs. The competition was renamed the Pro12 in 2011 with the addition of two teams from Italy; the Pro14 in 2017 with the addition of two teams from South Africa; and the United Rugby Championship in 2021 with the incorporation of four South African teams. Irish provinces have won the competition fourteen times in 22 seasons, and all four provinces have won it at least once. Leinster won the league in 2002, 2008, 2013, 2014 and 2018; Munster won in 2003, 2009, 2011 and 2023; Ulster won it in 2006; and Connacht won it in 2016.\nInternational rugby.\nThe Five Nations became the Six Nations Championship in 2000 with the addition of Italy. Ireland's first win of the professional era came with a Grand Slam in 2009. They won it again in 2014, 2015, 2018 and 2023 (the last two also being Grand Slams). They went out in the quarter-finals of the World Cup in 1999 (to Argentina); 2003 (to France); at the group stage in 2007; and in the quarter-finals in 2011 (to Wales), 2015 (to Argentina), and 2019 (to New Zealand). After a victorious tour of New Zealand in 2022, Ireland go into the 2023 Rugby World Cup as one of the favourites.\nThe old Lansdowne Road stadium was demolished in 2007, and the new Aviva Stadium, built on the same site, opened in 2010. In the meantime, home internationals were played at the Gaelic Athletic Association's stadium, Croke Park.\nIreland's most-capped players of the professional era include Leinster centre Brian O'Driscoll (133), Munster out-half Ronan O'Gara (128), Leinster prop Cian Healy (125), Ulster hooker Rory Best (123) and Leinster out-half Johnny Sexton (116). O'Driscoll is Ireland's record try scorer with 46; Sexton is their leading points scorer with 1095.\nIrish society and politics.\nAlthough rugby has traditionally been associated with the more anglophile elements of Irish society, it has not been without its following in the nationalist and republican communities. For example, the longest serving taoiseach, Éamon de Valera was a former player, and lifetime fan of the game. At the age of sixteen, De Valera won a scholarship to Blackrock College, County Dublin. It was at Blackrock College that de Valera began playing rugby. Later during his tenure at Rockwell College, he joined the school's rugby team where he played fullback on the first team, which reached the final of the Munster Senior Cup. De Valera was a close friend of the Ryan brothers at Rockwell who played on Ireland's Triple Crown-winning team in 1899. De Valera remained a lifelong devotee of rugby, attending numerous international matches up to and towards the end of his life despite near blindness.\nOther notable politicians, from very different backgrounds, who have played rugby for Ireland include Tyrone Howe (a former Unionist Party councillor), Trevor Ringland (a Unionist Parliamentary candidate) and Dick Spring (former Tánaiste and Labour Party TD).\nNowadays, rugby is played by both nationalists and unionists. Historically, it tended to be popular with different social groups in different parts of Ireland, although generally speaking it is regarded as a middle-class sport in Ireland and further afield. In Limerick city, it is enjoyed across the social spectrum, while in Leinster and Cork City it remains very much a middle-class game. Rugby traditionally isn't as prevalent in Connacht, although it is less defined there by social class. In Northern Ireland it is traditionally played in mainly-middle-class Protestant grammar schools. The changing climate in Northern Ireland politics has altered this perceived tradition with the introduction of rugby into an increasing number of Roman Catholic grammar and secondary schools which were previously exclusively associated with Gaelic games.\nRugby and the GAA.\nDuring the late 19th century, in response to the perceived encroachment of English sports, including rugby, Irish nationalist Michael Cusack set up the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). Rule 42 of the GAA's Official Guide prohibited the playing of non-Gaelic games in GAA stadiums, including rugby until it was lifted in 2007. However, the rule was relaxed while Lansdowne Road was being redeveloped, and rugby was played in Croke Park including a match between Leinster and Munster that broke the club rugby attendance record; see List of non-Gaelic games played in Croke Park for exceptions to this rule.\nThe first game to take place under the relaxed Rule 42 took place on 11 February 2007. It was a Six Nations Championship rugby match between Ireland and France which Ireland lost 17–20. The following match against England generated some controversy, since it involved the playing of God Save the Queen at a ground where British soldiers had killed fourteen spectators on Bloody Sunday, 1920. There was a small protest by Republican Sinn Féin outside the ground which included a man holding a sign saying \"No to foreign games\" while ironically wearing a Celtic FC tracksuit.\nA Heinkeen Cup semi-final was played in Croke Park on 2 May 2009, when Leinster defeated Munster 25–6. The attendance of 82,208 set a new world record attendance for a club rugby union game."

        "title": "Wayne Morgan (basketball)",
        "text": "Wayne Morgan (born October 7, 1950) was the Iowa State University men's basketball coach from 2003 to 2006. He was Iowa State University's first African-American head basketball coach.\nCareer.\nMorgan was a coach at Syracuse under Jim Boeheim until 1996. He coached at Long Beach State for six seasons before accepting the head coaching position at Iowa State. In three years at Iowa State, Morgan had a combined record of 55-39, marking his record fourth to Larry Eustachy (72-26, two NCAA tournament appearances, one Elite eight appearance), Tim Floyd (69-29, twice second round of NCAA tourney), and Fred Hoiberg (62-39, two round of 32 NCAA tournament appearances) in the history of Iowa State University basketball coaches finishing their third year. During this time his team went to the NIT semifinals and the second round of the NCAA tournament, where they were overpowered by the eventual national champions, North Carolina. Morgan's third year, struggling to rebuild the four and five positions, was less spectacular, finishing with a 16-14 record overall. He was fired by athletic director Jamie Pollard in March 2006 due to an emerging scandal in which Iowa State University allegedly paid a third party, D1 Scheduling, money which was linked to a cash-for-recruits program. Investigations by NCAA, conferences and schools found no wrongdoing. Morgan was replaced by Greg McDermott, a native Iowan, and head coach of the University of Northern Iowa.\nHis up-tempo style of basketball generated doubt across the state but produced a memorable first season that featured a team which was playing its best basketball late in the season. ISU recorded 20 wins in Morgan's rookie season, tying for the ninth-best win total in school history. The 20 wins produced by Morgan, which is the second-best win total for an ISU coach in his first season at the helm, was just one of several highlights in his inaugural season.\nThe Cyclones were virtually unbeatable at home, going 17-1 in Hilton Coliseum. The 17 home wins was the second-highest home win tally in school history and the 94.4 percent home winning percentage is the fifth-best clip in the ISU annals. Three of ISU's 17 home wins were against teams that advanced to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen (Xavier, Kansas, Texas) and two were against instate rivals Iowa and Drake, helping ISU win its second consecutive mythical state championship. Morgan paced ISU to a NIT appearance, the school's 14th postseason bid in the last 21 years. The Cyclones caught fire in the NIT, defeating Georgia, Florida State and Marquette, earning a trip to New York City in the semifinals at Madison Square Garden.\nOne of Morgan's star players in his first season was Curtis Stinson, a fellow New Yorker who he recruited to ISU in his first season as an assistant with the Cyclones. Stinson was one of the best freshman in all of college basketball, earning Big 12 Freshman of the Year honors and first-team Freshman All-America accolades by Basketball Times. Stinson and Jackson Vroman both earned third-team all-Big 12 honors in Morgan's first year. Vroman led the league in rebounding, becoming the first Cyclone to top the conference in boards since 1980. Morgan helped Vroman develop into one of the best centers in the nation in his final season with the Cyclones. His improvement enabled him get drafted in the second round of the 2004 NBA Draft as the No. 31 pick.\nMorgan was tabbed as Iowa State University's 17th men's basketball coach May 14, 2003. He spent his first season in Ames as an assistant at Iowa State, joining the ISU basketball staff in July 2002. As an assistant on the 2002-03 Cyclone staff, Morgan helped ISU to an NIT berth, as ISU finished 17-14, tying for the 13th-best win total in school history. A top-notch recruiter, he was instrumental in helping the Cyclones sign a nationally ranked recruiting class in 2003 and 2004.\nMorgan was involved in 12 NCAA Tournaments, seven regular-season conference titles, four NIT appearances and tutored nineteen players who have gone on to NBA careers. He spent six years as head coach at Long Beach State, where he compiled a 91-84 overall mark and a 55-39 record in the Big West Conference before he was fired. Morgan coached three teams that finished first or second in the Big West Western Division. His 1999-2000 squad was 24-6 overall and 15-1 in the Big West en route to winning the conference championship. The 1999-2000 team was one of the best in LBSU history, qualifying for the National Invitation Tournament. It compiled the third-longest winning streak in school history (15 games), tied for the third-most wins in 49er history. Morgan is also a 2008 inductee into the Westchester Community College Hall of fame as well as a 2018 inductee into the Brooklyn USA Basketball Hall of Fame.\nFrom 2009-2013, Morgan was an assistant coach at Hofstra University.\nHe is the author of two DVDs: \"Wayne Morgan: Mastering the 2-3 zone defense\"; and \"Wayne Morgan: The Philosophy of changing defenses and the 2-3 zone.\" Both feature his mastery of the 2-3 zone, much of what he learned as an assistant to Coach Jim Boeheim of Syracuse between 1984 and 1996."

        "text": "The 2006 ICC Champions Trophy was a One Day International cricket tournament held in India from 7 October to 5 November 2006. It was the fifth edition of the ICC Champions Trophy (previously known as the ICC Knock-out). The tournament venue was not confirmed until mid-2005 when the Indian government agreed that tournament revenues would be free from tax (the 2002 tournament had been due to be held in India, but was switched to Sri Lanka when an exemption from tax in India was not granted). Australia won the tournament, their first Champions Trophy victory. They were the only team to get one loss in the tournament, as all other teams lost at least two matches. West Indies, their final opponents, beat Australia in the group stage but were bowled out for 138 in the final and lost by eight wickets on the Duckworth–Lewis method. West Indies opening batsman Chris Gayle was named Player of the Tournament.\nEnglish writer Tim de Lisle said the tournament \"had been fun\" because \"it had been unpredictable.\" The unpredictability was in part shown by the fact that no Asian side qualified for the semi-final, for the first time in a major ICC tournament since the 1975 World Cup. De Lisle also claimed that \"the pitches\" had been the \"tournament's secret,\" saying that they were \"sporting and quixotic\" and \"quite untypical of both one-day cricket and the subcontinent.\" His views were echoed by panelists in a roundtable discussion organized by ESPNcricinfo, \"who hoped that the tournament would not be a one-off in a batsman-dominated game,\" according to news site rediff.com. The tournament recorded five of the 10 lowest team totals in the tournament's history, and totals of 80 (for West Indies v Sri Lanka) and 89 (for Pakistan v South Africa) were the lowest recorded in matches involving the top eight ranked One-day International sides of the world.\nQualifying.\nThe Ten full member teams competed in the tournament and were seeded according to the ICC ODI Championship standings on 1 April 2006.Bangladesh became the last team to qualify, claiming tenth place ahead of Kenya on 23 March 2006. The first six teams on the ICC ODI table (Australia, South Africa, Pakistan, New Zealand, India, and England) qualified automatically; the next four teams (Sri Lanka, the defending champions West Indies, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh) played a pre-tournament round-robin qualifying round from 7 to 14 October to determine which two teams will proceed to play in the main round.\nTournament structure.\nTwo teams from the qualifying round, plus the other six teams, played in a group stage, split into two groups of four in a round-robin competition, played from 15 to 29 October.\nThe top two teams from each group qualified for the semi-finals played on 1 November and 2 November. The final was played on 5 November.\nVenues.\nMatches in the preliminary round and the group round were played in the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium in Mohali, Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad, the Sawai Man Singh Stadium in Jaipur, and the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai. The matches in Mumbai were the first One Day Internationals at Brabourne Stadium for 11 years.\nThe semi-finals were played in Mohali and Jaipur. The final was played in Mumbai.\nUmpires and match referees.\nThree match referees and eight umpires were named for the tournament. Of the ten umpires on the ICC elite panel, neither Darrell Hair, who was not nominated due to security concerns, nor Billy Doctrove was employed for the tournament. Those were two umpires calling Pakistan for ball tampering in August. An ICC spokesman said, \"this didn't mean Billy Doctrove is a bad umpire,\" and that there was \"nothing sinister\" about the decision.\nThe eight umpires for the tournament were:\nThe three match referees for the tournament were Mike Procter, Jeff Crowe, and Ranjan Madugalle.\nQualifying round.\nWest Indies and Sri Lanka had qualified with a game to spare, and their match only determined their position on the ICC ODI Championship table as well as group opposition in the main stage.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup stage.\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nTournament statistics.\nStatistics include performances in preliminary round matches.\nRecords.\nRecords broken during the tournament:\nOff the field issues.\nThe BCCI, Indian cricket's governing body, made efforts to ensure that this is the last ICC Champions Trophy. They stated that it was a \"financial burden\" for host nations and that the ICC should host only one international tournament, the World Cup. However, in April, BCCI president Sharad Pawar said that he would \"respect the decision\" if the ICC unanimously agreed to keep the Champions Trophy on the calendar.\nAfter the bombings in Mumbai in July 2006, there were concerns raised about the security of players, but no team decided to withdraw on these grounds.\nHerschelle Gibbs returned to India for the first time in six years; he had refused to tour the country following the match-fixing scandal on the tour of India in 2000, over fears he might be arrested. He eventually agreed to a questioning session with the Delhi police, incriminating several more people in the scandal.\nPakistan's team composition frequently changed; the original captain Inzamam-ul-Haq was suspended following his decision to forfeit the fourth Test of Pakistan's match against England over an umpiring decision. Younis Khan was instated as captain, withdrew himself, then was appointed for the job again. On 16 October, the day before their first match, Pakistan fast bowlers Mohammad Asif and Shoaib Akhtar were sent home following a positive A sample of a drugs test.\nAward ceremony controversy.\nDuring the Award ceremony after the finals, Ricky Ponting tapped the shoulders of BCCI President Sharad Pawar and rudely gestured him to hand over the trophy. Soon after the trophy was handed over, Damien Martyn nudged Sharad Pawar off the stage, eager to relish the moment and to pose for the waiting photographers. Former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar who was also present on the stage, later disclosed that one of the Australian team members referred to Pawar as \"Hiya Buddy.\"\nAlthough Pawar tried to play down the incident by stating that \"it wasn't intentional,\" some cricketers, including the usually diplomatic Sachin Tendulkar and Nikhil Chopra reacted strongly to this. In Mumbai, a section of NCP workers took to the streets demanding an apology from the Australian cricket team. Chaggan Bhujbal, a NCP leader, said, \"This is an insult to a senior leader. We will make a formal complaint to the Australian embassy.\" \nThe BCCI, however, decided not to complain to Cricket Australia officially. However, the issue soon got resolved when Ricky Ponting tended his apology to Pawar."

        "title": "2002 ICC Champions Trophy",
        "text": "The 2002 ICC Champions Trophy was a cricket tournament held in Sri Lanka in 2002. It marked the third edition of the ICC Champions Trophy, with the previous two tournaments being known as the ICC Knock Out Tournaments. Originally scheduled to be held in India, the tournament was moved to Sri Lanka when India did not grant an exemption from tax, as needed. The tournament consisted of fifteen matches, including two semi-finals and a final match. This event was notable as it marked the first time that teams from all member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC) visited Sri Lanka to participate in a cricket tournament.\nTwelve teams participated in the tournament: the ten Test-playing nations, along with Kenya, who held full One Day International (ODI) status, and the Netherlands, who were the winners of the 2001 ICC Trophy. The teams were divided into four pools, each consisting of three teams. In the pool stage, each team played the other two teams in its pool once. The top team from each pool advanced to the semi-finals.\nIn the first semi-final, Australia was defeated by Sri Lanka, while India emerged victorious over South Africa in the second semi-final. However, the final match between India and Sri Lanka was affected by rain and had to be abandoned on two occasions, resulting in no result being declared.\nVirender Sehwag emerged as the highest run-scorer of the tournament, while Muttiah Muralitharan claimed the title of highest wicket-taker.\nQualification.\nTwelve teams participated in the tournament: the ten Test-playing nations, along with Kenya, who held full One Day International (ODI) status, and the Netherlands, who were the winners of the 2001 ICC Trophy.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize money for the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy was $1 million, and in addition, the 12 teams received $165,000 each for taking part in the tournament. The winning team of the tournament collected $525,000: $100,000 for winning both of its Pool matches, $125,000 for winning semi-final and $300,000 for winning the final.\nVenues.\nAll the matches were played in Colombo at two grounds: R. Premadasa Stadium and Sinhalese Sports Club Ground.\nTournament structure.\nUnlike the previous two editions of the Champions Trophy which had a direct knockout format, this edition had a format in which teams were divided into pools instead and the first-placed teams of the respective pools at the end of pool stage would qualify to the knockout stage. The 12 teams—10 Test playing nations (plus Kenya and Netherlands)—were divided into four pools of three teams each, with every team playing two matches. Australia, Bangladesh and New Zealand were placed in Pool 1 whereas England, India and Zimbabwe were allotted Pool 2. Kenya, South Africa and West Indies were put together in Pool 3, and Netherlands, Pakistan and Sri Lanka played each other in Pool 4. The semi finals were played between the winners of Pool 2 and the winners of Pool 3, and Pool 1 and Pool 4.\nPool matches.\nThe first match of the tournament was played between Sri Lanka and Pakistan on 12 September 2002. Sri Lanka won the match by eight wickets with Sanath Jayasuriya scoring his thirteenth ODI century. He reached 8,000 runs in ODI during his innings. Sri Lanka reached into the semi-finals by winning their next match against the Netherlands by 202 runs. Australia, from the Pool 1, qualified for the semi-finals after defeating Bangladesh by nine wickets at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, Colombo. In their first Pool match, Australia had defeated New Zealand by 164 runs. They played Sri Lanka in the second semi-final of the tournament.\nSouth Africa, who had defeated the West Indies in their opening match, made their place into the semi-finals from Pool 3 by winning over Kenya. They defeated Kenya by 176 runs with man of the match Herschelle Gibbs scoring 116 runs. The fourth semi-finalist of the tournament was India, who defeated Zimbabwe and England in the Pool matches. Virender Sehwag scored 126 runs against England. India faced South Africa in the first semi-final of the tournament.\nKnockout matches.\nSemifinals.\nAustralia, India, South Africa, and Sri Lanka topped their respective Pools by winning their Pool matches and qualified for the semi-finals. In the first semi-final India faced South Africa and in the second semi-final Australia played against the hosts Sri Lanka.\nSemifinal 1.\nThe first semi-final was played between India and South Africa on 25 September 2002 at the R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo. India batted first and scored 261 runs for nine wickets in 50 overs. Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid scored 62, 59 and 49 runs respectively. South African fast bowler Shaun Pollock took three wickets for 43 runs. Chasing the target of 262, South Africa collapsed after reaching 192 runs for one wicket with Herschelle Gibbs scoring 116 and Jacques Kallis 97 runs in 37 overs. Gibbs could not continue his inning due to heat exhaustion. Sehwag got three wickets for 25 runs, and was given the man of the match award for his performance. India won the match by 10 runs and qualified for the final of the tournament.\nSemifinal 2.\nThe second semi-final was played between Sri Lanka and Australia on 27 September 2002 at the same ground. Australia batted first and scored 162 runs all out. Tail-ender Shane Warne scored 36 runs followed by Adam Gilchrist and Damien Martyn scoring 31 and 28 runs respectively. Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan took three wickets for 26 runs. Aravinda de Silva, who was awarded Man of the Match, conceded only 16 runs in 10 overs and took Matthew Hayden's wicket. Sri Lanka, in their innings, reached the target of 163 runs in 40 overs losing only three wickets. Opener Marvan Atapattu scored 51 runs followed by wicketkeeper-batsman Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya scoring 48 and 42 runs respectively. Glenn McGrath took two wickets for 41 runs in 10 overs.\nFinal.\nThe 2002 ICC Champions Trophy Final was played on 29 and 30 September 2002 at the R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo. On 29 September, Sri Lanka scored 244 runs including Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara scoring fifties, and Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh took three wickets for 27 in 10 overs. In reply, India started their batting and scored 14 runs without any loss in two overs before the match was abandoned due to heavy rain; the match was finished in no result. It was decided that the new match would be played on the reserve day.\nOn the reserve day the Sri Lankans again batted first, scoring 222 runs including Mahela Jayawardene and Russel Arnold scoring 77 and 56 runs respectively, and Indian Zaheer Khan took three wickets for 44 runs. India scored 38 runs in 8.4 overs and the match was abandoned due to rain without result. According to ICC rules, an ODI match is only official after 25 overs bowled to the side batting second. A Man of the Series award was not made.\nCriticism.\nThe International Cricket Council's (ICC) rule for One Day International (ODI) cricket at that time, \"a minimum of 25 overs have to be bowled to the side batting second to constitute a match\", was criticized by former Indian cricketers. Former Indian wicket-keeper Farokh Engineer rejected the rule saying that it \"doesn't make any sense\". Another former Test cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar said that the ICC \"should look at that rule straight away and change it\", and the \"obvious thing is to continue from where they left off\".\nTournament statistics.\nIndian opener Virender Sehwag was the highest run-scorer of the tournament. He scored 271 runs from four innings at the average of over 90, including a century and a fifty. His highest score was 126 runs against England. Followed by Sri Lankan captain Sanath Jayasuriya who scored 254 runs. Herschelle Gibbs of South Africa scored two centuries in the tournament. He also had the highest average of 120 from three innings. Zimbabwean Andy Flower's score of 145 against India was the highest individual score in a match.\nSri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was the most successful bowler of the tournament. He took ten wickets in three innings, while his best bowling figures were four wickets for 15 runs against the Netherlands at the R. Premadasa Stadium. The only five-wicket haul of the tournament was taken by Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath. He took five wickets for 37 runs against New Zealand at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground.\nZimbabwean Alistair Campbell took five catches in two matches, and Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara had the most dismissals with seven—five catches and two stumpings."

        "title": "Flèche (fencing)",
        "text": "The flèche is an aggressive attacking technique in fencing, used with foil and épée.\nBackground.\nIn a flèche, a fencer transfers their weight onto their front foot and starts to extend the arm. The rear leg initiates the attack, but the ball of the leading foot provides the explosive impulse that is needed to drive the fencer toward the opponent. Continuing to bring the weapon, arm, and front shoulder forward, the fencer picks up their back foot, crossing their front leg, and landing it in front of the other foot - as if taking an exaggerated walking stride. It is at this point, when the back foot lands and just after that arm has become fully extended, that the hit should be made. In foil, the attack is considered over when the back foot lands, and the opponent can seize right-of-way by initiating an attack. \nAfter attempting the hit, the fencer continues to move forward, running past their opponent, to avoid the riposte if he or she was parried, or a counterattack. If the fencer moves past as quickly as possible, the opponent generally only has one chance to hit the fleching fencer as they pass. Rules prevent body contact with the opponent in foil. Infraction of the rule may result in a warning, awarding a touch to the opponent, and/or expulsion from the competition. In épée, contact merely results in a stopping of play without penalty, unless it was done with jostling, brutality, or to avoid being hit.\nThe flèche involves speed and an element of surprise. The flèche is absolutely not a charge down the piste at an opponent at distance. The flèche utilizes timing, not distance, so the distance shouldn't be greater than a step-lunge.\nThe flèche is only used in foil and épée. In sabre, it is forbidden for the back foot to pass in front of the front foot, outlawing the flèche.\nThe flèche is not allowed in some types of tournaments, especially in high school fencing. For example, the flèche is forbidden in New Jersey interscholastic fencing.\nHistory.\nThe term \"flèche\" is a French term meaning \"arrow,\" referring to the surprising style of the attack. Under FIE rules it is illegal for a sabreur to cross his or her legs, making the flèche illegal. Sabreurs can instead use a \"flunge\" — a portmanteau of \"flying\" and \"lunge\" — where a lunge (generally cutting to head) is made with a leap to give speed and close the extra distance."

        "text": "The 2017 World Baseball Classic (WBC) was an international professional baseball competition, composed of 16 competing nations, held from March 6 to 22, 2017. It was the fourth iteration of the World Baseball Classic. The first-round hosts were Seoul, Tokyo, Miami, and Zapopan. The second-round hosts were Tokyo and San Diego, and the championship round was played in Los Angeles.\nTwelve of the sixteen competing nations qualified based on their performance during the first round of the 2013 tournament; the remaining four nations were the winners of four qualification tournaments that took place in February, March, and September 2016. Two of the four qualifiers, Colombia and Israel, made their first appearance in the WBC, and both have secured their positions for the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\nThe Netherlands, Japan, Puerto Rico, and the United States advanced to the championship round. Defending champion Dominican Republic was eliminated in the second round. The United States defeated Puerto Rico to win the championship game, 8–0. Marcus Stroman was named tournament MVP. He made three starts for the U.S. and posted a 2.35 ERA in 15 total innings, including 6 shutout innings in the championship game.\nQualification.\nThe top three teams from each pool of the first round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic automatically qualified.\nFormat.\nThe first and second rounds of the tournament were played in round-robin format, with each team playing each other team in their pool once, as was the case in 2006. However, in an effort to reduce the likelihood that a team would be eliminated on statistical tiebreakers, the tournament schedule allowed for a seventh game at each pool-play site.\nIn either of the latter cases, the statistics used to rank the tied teams were:\nVenues.\nSix stadiums were used during the main tournament:\nFirst round.\nPool A.\nPool A of the First Round of the 2017 World Baseball Classic was held at Gocheok Sky Dome, Seoul, South Korea from March 6 to 10, 2017, between Team Israel, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan. Pool A was a round-robin tournament. Prior to the start of the tournament, ESPN considered Team Israel, ranked 41st in the world, to be the biggest underdog in the tournament, referring to them as the \"Jamaican bobsled team of the WBC\".\nTeam Israel (3–0) and Team Netherlands (2–1) qualified for the second round, in Japan. Israel became the first baseball team to go undefeated in the first round of the WBC's main draw after entering the main draw by winning in a qualifying round. In what NBC reported was thought to be the tallest batter-pitcher matchup in baseball history, the Dutch team's Loek van Mil walked Israel's Nate Freiman. Israel's catcher, Ryan Lavarnway, was named Pool A MVP, after going 5-for-9 (.556/.692/.889), with four walks, a home run, and three RBIs.\nPool B.\nTwo-time champion Japan concluded Pool B with a 3–0 record. Cuba defeated Australia to advance to the second round. In the first round, after batting .364, Japanese outfielder Yoshitomo Tsutsugoh was named the Pool B MVP.\nPool C.\nAfter falling behind 5–0 in the sixth inning, Dominican Republic rallied to defeat the U.S. 7–5 in their second game. On the last day of the pool, Colombia tied their game against Dominican Republic 3–3 in the eighth on a Jorge Alfaro home run, and had a chance to win in the ninth inning, but Oscar Mercado was called out at home trying to score on a sacrifice fly. The game continued into extra innings, where Dominican Republic scored 7 runs in the 11th to win and finish the pool undefeated. The U.S. then took an early lead on Canada, winning 8–0 to claim the second berth in San Diego. Manny Machado of the Dominican Republic was named MVP for the first-round Pool C bracket of the WBC, after batting .357.\nPool D.\nWhile Puerto Rico cruised in all three of its games, the fight for the other three places was extremely tight. Italy scored 5 runs in the bottom of the 9th inning to shock Mexico in the first game, then lost an extra-inning slugfest against Venezuela. In the final game, Mexico defeated Venezuela in another slugfest and thought they had scored enough runs to advance on tiebreakers, though this turned out not to be the case.\nThe first tiebreaker criterion is fewest runs allowed per defensive inning played (RA/IPD) in the games among the tied teams. Although Mexico allowed the fewest runs in those games (19, to Italy's 20, and Venezuela's 21), Mexico played fewer defensive innings (17, while the other two teams had 19) and thus had the highest average RA/IPD (1.117, to Italy's 1.053 and Venezuela's 1.105). This occurred for two reasons: the Italy-Venezuela game went 10 innings, and Mexico was the road team while losing to Italy. In fact, the Mexico-Italy game did go into the bottom of the 9th, in which Italy scored runs that were charged against Mexico but Mexico failed to record an out. There was confusion during and after the Mexico-Venezuela game, with an initial calculation showing that Mexico had advanced. Mexico filed a formal protest of its elimination, but the protest was denied.\nAs specified in the rules, Mexico was eliminated by the tiebreaker calculation and a tiebreaker game was played between Italy and Venezuela, which Venezuela won with a 9th-inning rally.\nAccording to the rules as announced at the time, Mexico's last-place finish would have required it to participate in a qualifying tournament in order to re-qualify for the 2021 World Baseball Classic. However, MLB announced in 2020 that the field of teams for the 2021 WBC would be expanded, with all 2017 WBC participants qualifying automatically and four new teams coming from qualifying tournaments.\nSecond round.\nPool E.\nUndefeated Japan (3–0) and the Netherlands (2–1) advanced to the semi-final round, as Israel (1–2) came in third, and Cuba (0–3) fourth.\nPool F.\nPool F started with Puerto Rico handing the Dominican Republic its first loss since the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Puerto Rico ended Pool F still undefeated and Venezuela was eliminated, going 0–3. The final game of the pool was a rematch between the United States and Dominican Republic to advance to the championship round. The DR took an early 2–0 lead in the first inning, but the United States came back to win 6–3 to eliminate the defending champions.\nFinal standings.\nThe final standings were calculated by the WBSC for inclusion in the WBSC Men's Baseball World Rankings system.\nIn the final standings, ties were to be broken in the following order of priority:\nWhen the 2017 WBC was played, it was assumed that the field for the following 2021 WBC would remain 16 teams. Under the qualification format in use at the time, the bottom four finishers from 2017 (Canada, China, Mexico, and Chinese Taipei) would've been forced to re-qualify for 2021. However, in January 2020, MLB announced it was expanding the field for the 2021 WBC from 16 teams to 20 and that all 16 participants from 2017 would receive automatic bids for 2021, thus sparing the bottom four nations from relegation to the qualifiers.\nAwards.\n2017 All-World Baseball Classic team.\n\"Source:\" \nAttendance.\n973,699 (avg. 24,342; pct. 72.3%)\nFirst round.\n508,830 (avg. 20,353; pct. 74.3%)\nSecond round.\n354,977 (avg. 29,581; pct. 72.0%)\nChampionship round.\n109,892 (avg. 36,631; pct. 65.4%)"

        "title": "Controversies at the 2006 World Baseball Classic",
        "text": "There were a number of controversies surrounding the 2006 World Baseball Classic.\nFormat.\nIn the Classic, the Korean team played in and won every game they played in Pool A. They advanced to round two, again winning all three games to secure a place in the semifinals. However, in the semifinals, the Korean team lost to the Japanese team, who they had beaten twice previously. \nJapan, despite winning the tournament, finished with a 5-3 (.625) overall record that was actually only tied with Cuba for the fourth best among tournament teams, ranking behind Korea (6-1, .857), the Dominican Republic (5-2, .714), and Puerto Rico (4-2, .667).\nThere was also no third place game. In addition, some felt the groupings were unevenly balanced.\nBob Davidson.\nSacrifice fly appeal, Japan vs. United States.\nIn the top of the eighth inning of the second-round game between Japan and United States, a Japanese run was nullified when the umpiring crew ruled that Tsuyoshi Nishioka, who was on third base, left the base before USA left fielder Randy Winn caught the ball. Although the second-base umpire declared that the Japanese runner had tagged-up properly and was safe, home-plate umpire Bob Davidson met with the other umpires and ruled that the runner had left early. The third-base umpire had gone into left field to watch the catch and was not in any position to make a call.\nSlow-motion video replays (which baseball umpires do not have access to) appeared to show Nishioka's foot on the bag when the catch is made, but his movement before the catch may have confused the home-plate umpire, as the runner's upper body appeared to begin moving before his foot left the bag. Baseball etiquette states that the home plate umpire should make the final call on tag-up plays. Therefore, the call stood and the U.S. ended up winning the game by one run in the bottom of the ninth inning. Japanese manager Sadaharu Oh called the ruling \"a pity\" and stated that he had never seen a call overturned in that manner before.\nFor a few moments after the call was decided, it looked as if the Japanese team might not return to the field, thus forfeit the game. Ultimately they took the field and the game resumed.\nThe play eventually had no effect on the final result of the tournament, as the United States were eliminated in that same round while Japan went on to win the entire tournament.\nHome Run off foul pole, Mexico vs. United States.\nIn the bottom of the third inning of the second-round game between Mexico and the United States, Mexican hitter Mario Valenzuela batted a ball into right field that bounced off the yellow foul pole (later proven by the yellow paint mark on the baseball), and back onto the field. By rule, the hit was a home run. First base umpire Bob Davidson, though, ruled that the ball remained in play and credited Valenzuela with a double, the strident protests of Mexican manager Paquin Estrada notwithstanding. Valenzuela would score later this inning on a Jorge Cantu single. Mexico went on to win the game, 2–1.\nChinese Taipei.\nThe Chinese Taipei baseball team was originally listed as \"Taiwan\" and bearing the flag of the Republic of China, but following pressure from the People's Republic of China, the listing was later changed to Chinese Taipei and bearing the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag.\nAdditionally, at the website of the WBC, the introduction of the Chinese Taipei team is a completely different article from the Chinese translation. The original article that the Chinese translation was based on was removed, and the Chinese version changed \"Taiwan\" to \"Chinese Taipei\" during the process of translation. The official TV commercial contains neither ROC flags.\nHowever, MLB has given Chinese Taipei a sympathetic ear on occasion, such as the recap of its 12–3 win over China.\nDrug Testing.\nMyung Hwan Park, a pitcher for the Korean team, was disqualified from the WBC after testing positive for the use of an illegal substance. Venezuelan pitcher Freddy García tested positive for marijuana.\nCuba.\nPlayer eligibility.\nThe Cuban National Team announced it would not allow players who had defected to the United States to play in the major leagues to play on their team, eliminating big names such as Orlando Hernández, José Contreras, Danys Baez, and Rafael Palmeiro. One former defector, Orlando's half-brother Liván Hernández, expressed interest in pitching for Puerto Rico because he owns a house there and the rules allow players to compete for a nation based on permanent residency.\nConflict with the United States government.\nOn December 14, it was also reported that the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control denied the Cuban National Team a license to play due to the continuing U.S. embargo against Cuba, the embargo being in place to prevent Cuba from making a profit at the expense of the United States.\nAfterward, Cuban President Fidel Castro announced publicly that any profit made by Cuba in the Classic would be donated to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Major League Baseball's commissioner's office and the MLBPA both resubmitted Cuba's application soon after the announcement. However, after the tournament, the government refused to allow the donation.\nIn response to the possible exclusion of Cuba, the Puerto Rican Baseball Federation stated that it did not plan to hold games if Cuba was not allowed to participate.\nOn January 6, 2006, the International Baseball Federation (IBAF), baseball's world governing body, also threatened to withdraw its sanctioning of the World Baseball Classic unless the Bush administration allowed Cuba to compete. A withdrawal would have dealt a crippling blow to the tournament, affecting many of the teams involved.\nThe entire issue came to resolution, however, on January 20, 2006, when the U.S. Treasury Department issued a license to Cuba. Department spokeswoman Molly Millerwise announced that by \"working closely with World Baseball Inc. and the State Department, we were able to reach a licensable agreement that upholds both the legal scope and the spirit of the sanctions...This agreement ensures that no funding will make its way into the hands of the Castro regime.\".\nIn-game protests.\nThe Miami Herald reported that in the March 9, 2006 game between Cuba and the Netherlands, Jose Garcia Pino, a Cuban exile living in San Juan held up a sign saying, \"Abajo Fidel\" (Down with Fidel). The sign was clearly seen on the international feed which was carried in Cuba. He was confronted in the stands by four Cuban delegates. One of them, Angel Iglesias, vice-president of Cuba's National Institute of Sports, rushed to confront the man.\nAfter this incident, the Cuban Baseball Federation made a deal with World Baseball Classic organizers to ban political signs from the stands. During the second game of Pool 2 play between Cuba and the Dominican Republic, a group of fans caused a scuffle at Hiram Bithorn Stadium, spelling \"Abajo Fidel\" with the letters on their shirts.\nThe fans also had a small sign with the same message about the Cuban president, as did an airplane pulling a sign that appeared over the ballpark.\nOther spectators chanted \"Fuera! (Take them out!)\" and security guards took the sign away and asked the fans with the anti-Castro message to change shirts or leave the ballpark. The anti-Castro fans wore two shirts to hide the letters when they entered the stadium, and they put their second shirts back on after an inning-long confrontation in the fifth.\nCuba refused to attend the post-game news conference for the second time in the tournament. Cuba also did not speak to journalists after the game between Cuba and the Netherlands."

        "title": "Trestles (surfing)",
        "text": "Trestles is a collection of surfing spots between northern San Onofre State Beach in San Diego County and southern San Clemente in Orange County in California. Trestles consists of, from north to south, Upper Trestles (Uppers), Lower Trestles (Lowers), and Middle Trestles (Middles). North of Upper Trestles is the surf spot called Cottons. South of Middles is the surf spot called The Church.\n Middles gets its name because it was a middle area between Trestles (both Uppers and Lowers breaks) and The Church (sometimes just called \"Church\". It is named after Trestles Bridge, a wooden trestle bridge that surfers must walk under to reach the beach, replaced in 2012 by a concrete viaduct.\nLower Trestles consistently has the best waves of the group. For many years there was an WSL World Tour surfing competition held at Lowers every year, as well as the NSSA Nationals. Uppers is less consistent, but it has the potential to be a good wave with a long ride. North of Uppers is Cotton's Point, the location of former President Richard Nixon's home, \"La Casa Pacifica\", aka \"The Western White House\", and the associated surfing spot of Cottons.\nAccess and amenities.\nTrestles has two major access points:\nPlant and animal life.\nTrestles park is home to a variety of plant and animal life. The most common plant is the coastal sage scrub, which is native to the coast of California and thrives in the area's Mediterranean climate. Trestles park is also home to quite a lot of animal life, including California brown pelicans. These animals used to be endangered species, but the populations recovered so well that the species was removed from the endangered species list in 2009. During times of heavy rains, there is usually a river delta flowing into the ocean where there are often tadpoles.\nOne plant which grows right out of the sand is the beach evening primrose. Each plants creates a large mat of roots and foliage which is an extremely important aspect of the ecosystem as other plants are able to grow from the stable surface this plants provides. The primrose can be identified by its bright yellow, four petaled flowers which open in the morning, and turn reddish as evening progresses. The primrose has unique medical benefits as well. These flowers aid in the treatment of sore throat and eye diseases.\nSeasonal stream.\nDuring periods of strong rain, Trestles has a stream that runs through its center and empties into the ocean. Usually, the stream flows during the winter and spring, the seasons with the most rain in Southern California. The stream does not contain much marine life as it dries up without a steady water source. The stream creates a small pool which contains mainly tadpoles. When the stream dries up above ground, an underground water flow still exits into the ocean, just not through a river delta.\nTrestles has experienced problems with littering. Many visitors leave trash in the dried stream bed. When the stream flows, it brings the waste into the ocean and onto the beach. Trestles has numerous signs reminding visitors to dispose of waste properly.\nToll road controversy.\nThe California Transportation Corridor Agency (TCA) has sought to construct a 16-mile long six-lanes wide toll highway (graded for eight lanes) through San Onofre State Beach/Park and a habitat reserve in Orange County, joining the San Diego Freeway at Trestles.\nThe Toll Road, which is one of several routes that could be constructed to extend California State Route 241, is favored by several business groups and public officials from Orange County as a way to ease future traffic congestion. The particular Toll Road route through San Onofre is opposed by more than two dozen members of California's congressional delegation in Washington, D.C., thirty-eight California legislators including former California United States Senator Barbara Boxer, Surfrider Foundation, Defenders of Wildlife, The Sierra Club, The Natural Resources Defense Council, the California State Parks Foundation, the California State Park and Recreation Commission the Native American United Coalition to Protect Panhe, The City Project, the Save San Onofre Coalition, and Save Trestles, among others. Opposition is based upon the damage to the environment that would result from construction and operation of the Toll Road, the loss of park camping and recreational areas, the loss/damage to a site sacred to Native Americans, and studies that show that traffic congestion would actually increase on the San Diego Freeway if the toll road is built through San Onofre Beach. A survey of Orange County voters revealed that while 52% favored a connection in some capacity, 66% opposed the proposed route that would take the Toll Road through San Onofre State Park.\nOn February 6, 2008, the California Coastal Commission denied a Coastal Permit for the route of the proposed 241 Toll Road that would have cut through San Onofre and the Reserve, saying that of the eight possible routes considered, the one sought by the TCA was the most environmentally damaging. Had a permit been granted, it would have been the first toll road to run through a California state park. On December 18, 2008, The Department of Commerce announced that it would uphold the California Coastal Commission's ruling that found the TCA's proposed extension of the 241 Toll Road inconsistent with the California Coastal Act. The Department of Commerce noted in a release that at least one reasonable alternative to the project existed, and that the project was not necessary in the interest of national security. On May 22, 2013, environmentalists filed a new lawsuit to stop the building of the Toll Road in segments, a tactic they say is an illegitimate end-run around by the TCA after the Toll Road was defeated in 2008.\nPanhe is the site of an ancient Acjachemen village in the San Mateo campground area of San Onofre State Beach, straddling the San Diego-Orange county border off Cristianitos Road near Trestles. It remains a sacred, ceremonial, cultural, and burial site for the Acjachemen people. Many Acjachemen people trace their lineage back to Panhe. It is the site of the first baptism in California, and in 1769, the first close contact between Spanish explorers, Catholic missionaries, and the Acjachemen people. The Acjachemen people built the mission at San Juan Capistrano.\nThe advocacy group Save Panhe and San Onofre State Beach state that not only is Panhe one of the most historically significant sacred sites of the Acjachemen people, but that Panhe is also important to all Californians and Americans."

        "text": "Robert A. Snyder (February 6, 1913 – January 4, 2001) was an American football player and coach who spent more than three decades in the sport, including his most prominent position as head coach of the National Football League (NFL)'s Los Angeles Rams.\nCollege career.\nA native of Toledo, Ohio, Snyder played three years of football at Ohio University, seeing action on both sides of the ball. During that trio of seasons that began in 1933, Snyder was off the field for just four minutes, winning small college All-America honors as a senior.\nProfessional career.\nHe moved on to the fledgling second version of the American Football League in 1936, where he played for the Pittsburgh Americans before shifting to the NFL the following year with the Cleveland Rams. Playing quarterback (as well as serving as the team's placekicker) for two seasons, Snyder finished the 1938 NFL season with 631 yards passing, while also showing excellent speed and mobility.\nOn February 13, 1939, Snyder was traded to the Chicago Bears and used as running back. After contributing throughout the campaign, he suffered a deep personal tragedy when his two-week-old son, Robert Calvin, died on November 30.\nWhen he returned the next year, Snyder played exclusively at quarterback (and continuing as a kicker), but had the misfortune of playing on the same team as future Hall of Fame signal caller Sid Luckman. That frustration was soothed somewhat when the Bears went on to capture the 1940 NFL Championship with the biggest rout in the league's postseason history, defeating the Washington Redskins, 73–0.\nAfter another season of play resulted in another championship for the Bears, with Snyder kicking three field goals in the 37–9 championship game victory, Snyder retired to become the University of Notre Dame's freshman football coach on July 10, 1942. His main focus was instruction in his area of expertise, the T-Formation, and his work undoubtedly proved to be successful when two quarterbacks under his tutelage, Angelo Bertelli and Johnny Lujack, went on to win the Heisman Trophy.\nSnyder returned to the playing field with one more season with the Bears in 1943, notching a trio of league kicking records with 39 conversions, while also connecting on all 12 of his field goal attempts. During the November 14 contest against the New York Giants, Snyder scored on eight conversions during the Bears' high-scoring effort. After the season ended with another Bears' championship, he spent one year contributing to the war effort, serving as personnel manager of the Thompson Aircraft plant in his hometown of Toledo. A back injury suffered during his playing days had prevented Snyder from serving in the armed services. During this stretch, he also coached Libbey High School, his alma mater, to an Ohio state title.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1945, Snyder joined the Rams as an assistant coach, and played a major role in helping rookie quarterback Bob Waterfield win Most Valuable Player accolades. Under bitterly cold conditions on December 16, the Rams won the NFL title with a 15–14 decision over the Redskins. Just weeks later, Ram owner Dan Reeves shifted the franchise to Los Angeles, with Snyder spending the following season in the same capacity.\nAfter Rams head coach Adam Walsh resigned at the conclusion of the 1946 NFL season, Snyder was named head coach on January 20, 1947, and immediately became the league's youngest head coach. Winning three of the first four games of the regular season, Snyder watched the Rams collapse at midseason with a four-game losing streak to finish with a 6–6 mark. The pressures of that season followed him into the next, causing him to resign on September 3, 1948, citing an ulcer condition.\nDespite that stress, Snyder would stay away from coaching for less than a month before accepting an assistant post with the USC Trojans. On January 28, 1949, he left that position for an assistant coaching spot with the Green Bay Packers under Curly Lambeau, but again remained only a year before heading home to become head football coach at the University of Toledo.\nSnyder made a bit of history by naming Dick Huston as freshman coach, the first African-American mentor to ever work for a non-black college. Despite being back among family, Snyder left the school after finishing 4–5 during the 1950 season, and did not resurface until 1953 when he was named head coach of the Canadian Football League's Calgary Stampeders.\nThat foray would again only span one season before he was dismissed. The aftermath of his departure was ugly as Snyder claimed in February 1954 that players were taking the amphetamine benzedrine to keep up their stamina during the season, a charge that was roundly denied by the league. In August of that year, Snyder spent one season as an assistant at Villanova University, then returned to the NFL for two years with the Pittsburgh Steelers before moving back for one year to the college level as a West Virginia University assistant.\nSnyder watched his coaching career wind down during the 1960s, working at the minor league football level, beginning with a stint with the Toledo Tornadoes of the United Football League. On September 19, 1965, he was named head coach of the Wheeling Ironmen of the Continental Football League, lasting until his resignation on November 22, 1967. The following year, he became head coach of the league's Indianapolis Capitols, but resigned on February 4, 1969, to enter private business in Toledo.\nDeath.\nSnyder died in 2001 at a Toledo rehabilitation center after complications from diabetes."

        "text": "The men's 200 metre freestyle event at the 1976 Summer Olympics took place on July 19 at the Olympic Pool, Montreal. There were 55 competitors from 33 nations, with each nation having up to three swimmers. The medals were swept the United States, the only time there has been a medal sweep in the men's 200 metre freestyle (nations were later limited to two swimmers, making sweeps impossible). Bruce Furniss took gold, John Naber silver, and Jim Montgomery bronze. It was the second consecutive and third overall victory by an American swimmer.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the 200 metre freestyle event. It was first contested in 1900. It would be contested a second time, though at 220 yards, in 1904. After that, the event did not return until 1968; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games.\nTwo of the 8 finalists from the 1972 Games returned: bronze medalist Werner Lampe and sixth-place finisher Klaus Steinbach, both of West Germany. Reigning Olympic champion Mark Spitz had retired at the age of 22 after winning 7 gold medals in 1972. The American team was still strong, however. Jim Montgomery had won the inaugural 1973 World Aquatics Championships. Tim Shaw, the 1975 World Champion who had broken Spitz's world record, did not swim in this event after finishing 5th in the U.S. trials (he competed in longer races in 1976). The 1975 runner-up, Bruce Furniss, however, had broken Shaw's record three times and was a favourite in this event. Montgomery and Furniss were joined by backstroke specialist John Naber.\nThe Bahamas, Bulgaria, Greece, Indonesia, Ireland, Monaco, Nicaragua, Panama, Portugal, Spain, Tunisia, and the Virgin Islands each made their debut in the event. Australia and the United States made their fifth appearance each, the only two nations to have competed in all prior editions of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats, final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 8 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nThe standing world and Olympic records prior to this competition were as follows. Clark's Olympic record was set as the first leg in the 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay final.\nMaking the final in the 1976 event required at least matching the Olympic record, with seven men coming in under that time and an eighth equaling it. Andrey Bogdanov held a new record briefly, swimming 1:52.71 in the second heat. Klaus Steinbach dropped more than a full second off that time in the next heat, though, with a time of 1:51.41. The fourth, fifth, and sixth heats saw four men swim between Bogdanov's and Steinbach's times. Bruce Furniss, swimming in the eighth heat, cut almost half a second off Steinbach's record, coming in at 1:50.93.\nThat record would not stand long; four men beat it in the final. Only one of those men came in under the world record however: Furniss bettered his own world and Olympic records with 1:50.29 to win gold."

He was a five time Pro Bowler in 1977 to 1979, 1983 and 1985.\nCollege career.\nWright began his college career at Arizona State University but would later transfer to San José State. He started at cornerback in each of his two years at San José State, finishing his career there with 3 interceptions. He also excelled in track and field, winning two letters. His accomplishments included recording a long jump distance of 25 feet, 7 inches that still ranks in the top five in school history and running the 100 in 9.6 seconds. Following his senior year, Wright played in the 1974 East-West Shrine Game and the 1974 Senior Bowl. He was later inducted into the San José State University Hall of Fame.\nNFL career.\nWright was drafted by the Broncos with the 17th overall pick in the 1975 NFL draft. He broke into the lineup quickly, starting 11 games as a rookie and intercepting 2 passes while also recovering a fumble.\n1977 would be his breakout season as he intercepted 3 passes for 128 yards and a touchdown and helped lead the Broncos to Super Bowl XII. He was named a First-team All-Pro by the Associated Press in both 1978 and 1979. During the '79 season, he returned a fumble 82 yards for a touchdown. In 1980 and 1981, he was named Second-team All-Conference by UPI. In addition to his cover skills, Wright was also one of the best run supporting cornerbacks of his era. His feats eventually earned him the nickname \"Lou-dini.\"\nArguably, Wright had the best season of his career in 1983, intercepting a career-high 6 passes and being named First-team All-Pro by Newspaper Enterprise Association. In 1984, he recorded the second fumble return for a touchdown of his career and was named First-Team All-Pro by Pro Football Weekly and The Sporting News.\nIn 1985, he intercepted 5 passes and was named First-team All-Conference by UPI. In a week 11 game against the San Diego Chargers, Wright recorded the fourth and final touchdown of his career, returning a blocked field goal 60 yards for the winning score in overtime of the 30-24 Broncos victory. 1986 would be Wright's final season in the NFL and he intercepted 3 passes in helping lead the Broncos to Super Bowl XXI.\nIn his NFL career, he finished with 26 interceptions for 360 yards and 1 touchdown. He also recovered 11 fumbles and returned two for touchdowns. He was inducted to the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame in 1993. He was name to the National Football League 1970s All-Decade Team but he is one of only four defensive players on the list to not be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nThe Professional Football Researchers Association named Wright to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2016.\nCoaching career.\nWright is now a teacher and assistant football coach at Gateway High School in Aurora, Colorado."

        "title": "Baseball Reliquary",
        "text": "The Baseball Reliquary is a nonprofit educational organization \"dedicated to fostering an appreciation of American art and culture through the context of baseball history and to exploring the national pastime’s unparalleled creative possibilities.\" The Reliquary was founded in 1996 in Monrovia, California, and since 2015 has been located at Whittier College in Whittier, California. The organization is funded in part by a grant from the Los Angeles County Department of Arts and Culture. Since 1999, the Reliquary has maintained an “alternate hall-of-fame” called the Shrine of the Eternals.\nHistory and mission.\nThe Baseball Reliquary is a nonprofit educational institution that is \"dedicated to fostering an appreciation of American art and culture through the context of baseball history and to exploring the national pastime’s unparalleled creative possibilities.\" The Reliquary was founded in 1996 by Terry Cannon, a creative artist and assistant school librarian who describes himself as “meek and mild-mannered [on the outside] … a rabble-rouser and non-conformist [at heart].” In its early years, the Reliquary had no physical home; instead it collaborated with local institutions including public and university libraries and the Jackie Robinson Center.\nIn January 2015, the Reliquary found a permanent home for its collections and events with the opening of the Institute for Baseball Studies at Whittier College in Whittier, California. Housed on the third floor of the College’s Mendenhall building, the Institute is open to students and the public for research and viewing of the Reliquary’s growing collection.\nAwards and exhibitions.\nBeginning in 1999, the Reliquary created a hall-of-fame style historical commemoration of baseball notables called the Shrine of the Eternals. Rather than focusing on statistical accomplishments as does the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, the Shrine “seek[s] out aspects of this history that have been overlooked or have not been explored in depth as well as players and others in baseball who have had unconventional careers.” The Reliquary and its Shrine have been described as “a haven for legends like Marvin Miller and Spaceman Lee, umpires like Emmett Ashford and Pam Postema … mostly renegades who did not meet the precise standards of the [National] Baseball Hall of Fame.” Some view the Shrine of the Eternals as a more welcome recognition of their contributions to baseball than even the Hall of Fame.\nIn 2013, documentary filmmaker Jon Leonoudakis released a 69-minute film about the Reliquary titled \"Not Exactly Cooperstown\". The film premiered at the 8th Annual Baseball Film Festival at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown on September 29, 2013. The film was also featured at the St. Louis International Film Festival in November 2014.\nIn 2001, the Reliquary began recognizing “distinguished service by a baseball fan” with the Hilda Award, named for famed Brooklyn Dodgers fan Hilda Chester. In 2002, the Tony Salin Memorial Award was established “to honor individuals for their work in preserving baseball history.” Each of these honors is awarded annually.\nThe Reliquary organizes and presents artistic and historical exhibitions relating to baseball each year. Throughout its history, the Reliquary has held exhibitions on varied topics relating to the cultural impact of baseball, including:\nAward recipients.\nShrine of the Eternals.\nSince 1999, members of the Baseball Reliquary have elected individuals to their \"Shrine of the Eternals.\" The Shrine is similar in concept to the annual elections held at the Baseball Hall of Fame, but differs philosophically in that statistical accomplishment is not a criterion for election. Rather, the Shrine’s annual ballot is composed of individualsfrom the obscure to the well knownwho have altered the baseball world in ways that supersede statistics. The definition of \"individuals\" is not restricted to humans; the 2017 induction class included the \"Peanuts\" character Charlie Brown. The Baseball Reliquary lists the criteria for election to the Shrine of the Eternals as:\nMembers of the Reliquary receive a ballot of 50 candidates for the Shrine, and the top three vote-getters by percentage are installed. Balloting is conducted annually, except for a pause around the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 2019 balloting, there were more than 300 voting members.\nInductees (through the class of 2020):\nIn December 2023, the organization announced a nomination process and timeline for its class of 2024.\nHilda Award.\nNamed in memory of legendary Brooklyn Dodgers baseball fan Hilda Chester (1897–1978), the Hilda Award recognizes distinguished service by a baseball fan. The award is an old cowbell, Hilda Chester’s signature noisemaker. The Hilda is awarded annually, on the Shrine of the Eternals induction day.\nRecipients (as of 2019):\nTony Salin Memorial Award.\nIn 2002, the Reliquary established the Tony Salin Memorial Award, named after baseball historian and researcher Tony Salin (1952–2001), to honor individuals for their work in preserving baseball history.\nRecipients (as of 2019):"

        "title": "AAU Junior Olympic Games",
        "text": "The AAU Junior Olympic Games are the pinnacle competitions held annually by the US Amateur Athletic Union.\nOverview.\nThe AAU Junior Olympic Games are known as the largest national multi-sport event for youth in the United States. It has become the showcase event of the AAU Sports Program. Recent hosts include Des Moines, Iowa; Greensboro, North Carolina; Hampton Roads, Virginia; Houston, Texas; and Detroit, Michigan in 2017.\nThe AAU is one of the largest, non-profit, volunteer sports organizations in the country. As a multi-sport organization, AAU is dedicated exclusively to the promotion and development of amateur sports and physical fitness programs. The AAU philosophy of “Sports for All, Forever” is shared by over 500,000 members and 60,000 volunteers nationwide. Over 34 sports are offered in the 57 AAU Districts. Programs offered by the AAU include AAU Sports Program, AAU Junior Olympic Games, AAU James E. Sullivan Memorial Award, and the AAU Complete Athlete Program.\nThe AAU was founded in 1888 to establish standards and uniformity in amateur sports. During its early years, the AAU served as a leader in international sports representing the United States in the international sports federations. The AAU worked closely with the Olympic movement to prepare athletes for the Olympic games. After the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 and the establishment of the United States Olympic Committee, the AAU has focused its efforts on providing sports programs for participants of all ages beginning at the grassroots level.\nHistory.\nThe AAU Junior Olympic Games originated from 'telegraphic' state track and field competitions. National Champions were determined through telephone and/or mail entries instead of head-to-head competition. In 1949, the AAU conducted its first 'live' national meet in Cleveland, Ohio – giving birth to the AAU Youth Sports Program. Because of the success of the national track and field head-to-head competition, AAU leaders solicited support from the business and corporate sectors. The Chevrolet Division of General Motors Corporation and the Quaker Oats Company assisted the AAU in their vision of the number of youngsters that could be helped.\nAs the popularity of the AAU Youth Sports Program increased, the AAU leaders decided to conduct two national championships simultaneously. The idea came to fruition when Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey proclaimed the first AAU Junior Olympic Games open on August 21, 1967, in downtown Washington, D.C., at the Departmental Auditorium on Constitution Avenue. Five hundred twenty-three athletes competed in the inaugural AAU Junior Olympic Games that year. National champions were determined in swimming and track and field. Eighteen AAU records in swimming and three in track and field were established.\nSince its beginning in Washington, D.C., the AAU Junior Olympic Games have been conducted in 19 states and 30 cities across the United States. The state of Tennessee leads the way with six AAU Junior Olympic Games to its credit. \"There's nothing junior about it\" has become the theme of the AAU Junior Olympic Games while growing to over 16,000 participants in over 20 sports. The Game's popularity has exploded to now represent all 50 states and several United States territories.\nSports currently held.\nThe following is a list of sports that currently take place at the Junior Olympic Games.\nSports previously held.\nPreviously, a version of floor hockey whose rules were codified by Canada's Sam Jacks during the Great Depression in Toronto, Ontario, was a part of the games. In 1947, Jacks became the head coach of the Canadian Floor Hockey Team which competed in the AAU Junior Olympic Games in the USA where the Canadian team finished in third place. Two years later in 1949, the AAU conducted its first 'live' national meet in Cleveland, Ohio, giving birth to the AAU Youth Sports Program. Today the floor game is no longer a part of the Junior Games, but influenced the creation of a floor hockey variant which now exists as a part of the Special Olympics. Jacks would eventually go on to create the winter sport of ringette in 1963.\nBodybuilding.\nBodybuilding was considered an appropriate sport to be judged in the AAU due to its focus and \"good moral values to athletic youth.\" It is divided into four classes: Teen (ages 14–18), Collegiate (19-28), Women's, and Men's Natural. As of 2011, there has been no notice of how the sport's admission to the event line-up will be viewed by audiences.\nBecause the sport is not \"athletic\" in its competitive sense, contestants will have to do the following: do a posing routine with including the required poses in three stages (preliminary, solo, and final posedown), and they will have to submit a video essay on the sport and its effects on their lives, including nutrition, exercise, and the bodybuilding lifestyle.\nIt is important to note that the Teen Bodybuilding event will take place at a local high school to promote the sport among the youth and popularize it with worried parents.\nBodybuilders will be judged on the following: overall mass, symmetry, aesthetic presentation, posing routine, submitted video essay, and inquiry. Any contestant found to be using illegal substances will be automatically disqualified, without opportunity to qualify in future AAU events."

After that season he headed back to Switzerland, where he played, three season at HC Lugano, nine seasons for SC Bern and another four years at HC Fribourg-Gottéron. Because he started playing hockey as a child in Switzerland, he could join teams in Switzerland as a non-import player without having Swiss citizenship.\nDubé retired following the 2014-15 season and was named sports director of Swiss NLA side HC Fribourg-Gottéron in March 2015."

        "text": "The Penn Quakers men's basketball team is the college basketball program representing the University of Pennsylvania. As the twentieth-winningest men's basketball program of all-time, the team from Penn had its greatest success from 1966 to 2007, a period of over 40 years. Penn plays in the Ivy League in NCAA Division I.\nPrior to the formation of the Ivy League in 1956 Penn was a member of the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League (EIBL) from 1903 through 1955. Penn won 13 EIBL regular season championships (1906, 1908, 1916, 1918, 1920, 1921, 1928, 1929, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1945, 1953). Penn was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion for the 1919–20 and 1920–21 seasons by the Helms Athletic Foundation and for the 1919–20 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\nPenn has appeared in one Final Four, in 1979. Penn and Princeton are tied for the most Ivy League regular season championships with 26 each. Their main Ivy League rivalry is with Princeton, whom they used to always play as the last regular season game. Combining the EIL and Ivy Championships Penn leads with 39 championships; Princeton 32; Columbia 14; Yale 13; Dartmouth 12; Cornell 8; Harvard 6; and Brown 1.\nThe last NCAA tournament victory for the Quakers came on March 17, 1994, at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York. The No. 11 Quakers defeated the No. 6 Nebraska Cornhuskers, 90–80, in the first round. The Quakers then fell in the second round to No. 3 Florida on March 19 as the Gators prevailed, 70–58.\nNotable seasons.\n1979 Final Four.\nOne of Penn's most memorable seasons came in 1978–79 when the Quakers advanced to the NCAA tournament Final Four. Player Tony Price led the Quakers, who stunned the nation with victories over Iona, North Carolina, , and St. John's to advance to the Final Four. The Quakers faced Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson and Michigan State in the national semifinals in Salt Lake City, Utah, but were met with defeat, 101–67. They are the last Ivy League team to advance to the Final Four and Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament as of 2023.\nOthers.\nOther notable Penn teams include the team led by guards Matt Maloney and Jerome Allen during the mid-1990s and the nationally ranked teams of the early 1970s led by Dave Wohl, Steve Bilsky, Corky Calhoun and Bob Morse. Penn's 1970–71 team completed an undefeated regular season (26–0) and advanced to the Eastern Regional Final in the NCAA tournament, losing there to a Villanova team it had defeated during the regular season. Villanova lost to UCLA in the national championship game, but was later found to be using an ineligible player, Howard Porter.\nRivalries.\nThe Quakers, a member of the Philadelphia Big 5, have long-standing rivalries with a multitude of institutions such as Temple University, La Salle University, Saint Joseph's University, and Villanova University. Another rival is Drexel University, which is a member of the City 6. Penn’s traditional rival in the Ivy League is Princeton.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Quakers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 24 times. Their combined record is 13–26.\nNIT results.\nThe Quakers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) one time. Their record is 0–1.\nCBI results.\nThe Quakers have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) one time.

        "text": "This is a list in alphabetical order of cricketers who have played for Middlesex County Cricket Club in top-class matches since the club was formally constituted in February 1864. Like the Middlesex county teams formed by earlier organisations from the early 18th century, the county club has always held first-class status.\nIt has also run a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963;, as well as a top-class Twenty20 team since the inauguration of the Twenty20 Cup in 2003. These are three separate categories.\nThe details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a Middlesex player and then his name is given as it usually appears on match scorecards. Note that many players represented other top-class teams besides Middlesex and some players such as Nick Compton left the county but later returned. Current players are shown as active to the latest season in which they played for the club.\nThe list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team; and players whose first team appearances were in minor matches only.\nPlayers who represented the county before 1864 are included if they also played for the county club but excluded if not. All players known to have represented the county before the formation of the county club are included in List of Middlesex county cricketers to 1863."

It stands on the north side of Merton Street in central Oxford, England, and forms part of Merton College.\nThere has been a tennis court in Oxford since 1450 and one at the Merton Street site since c. 1494, according to one source. Alternatively, according to another source, Oxford has had a court since 1595 and one at this site when it was rebuilt in 1798. The Merton Street court, being early, has somewhat non-standard dimensions, and in particular an unusually flat tambour (a buttress used as part of the court). \nIt is the smallest court in England and the second oldest."

        "text": "Jason William Wood (born December 16, 1969) is an American former professional baseball player. He played all or parts of five seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) as an infielder, primarily used at first base. \nAmateur career.\nWood attended McLane High School and then Fresno State University. Originally, Wood was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 56th round (1,333rd overall) of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Opting not to sign with the Blue Jays, he was then drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 39th round (1,009th overall) in the 1990 Major League Baseball draft, but decided to continue at Fresno State. Finally, after being drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the 11th round (308th overall) of the 1991 Major League Baseball draft, he signed.\nProfessional career.\nOakland Athletics.\nWood, who had fair power, started off his professional career by playing in the minor leagues for seven seasons from 1991 to 1997. In 1994, he was a Southern League All-Star. He had a breakout minor league season in 1997 when he played for the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers. That year, he played in 130 games, batted .321 with 19 home runs and 87 RBI. His 1997 minor league season included helping the Trappers win the Pacific Coast League championship. He was released on October 17 the same year, but re-signed with the Athletics organization ten days later on October 27.\nIn 1998, Wood made the Athletics' Opening Day roster. He made his major league debut at the age of 28 against the Boston Red Sox on April 1, 1998, as a defensive replacement. About a week into the season, he was sent down to Triple-A.\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn July 18, 1998, he was sent to the Detroit Tigers as the player to be named later in the deal that sent Bip Roberts to the Athletics on June 23, 1998. Once acquired, he was sent to Triple-A to play with the Toledo Mud Hens. He was recalled in September by the big league club when rosters expanded. On September 9, 1998, he made his first career start against the Chicago White Sox as the designated hitter. He collected his first career hit, which was a single against Jim Parque. Overall, he played in a total of 13 games and batted .333 (8–24) with 1 home run in 1998.\nIn 1999, Wood bounced around between the minors and majors in the Tigers organization. He played in 27 games at the major league level and batted just .159 (7–44) with 1 home run. Following the season, he was released on October 15.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn November 17, 1999, he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He played for the Triple-A Nashville Sounds for the whole 2000 season. He just batted .237 with 7 home runs in 88 games. He returned to the Pirates organization for the 2001 season. He played for the Sounds for the entire season again and his performance was not much better than the previous season. He was released following the 2001 season.\nFlorida Marlins.\nWood signed a contract with the Florida Marlins on March 8, 2002. He played for the Triple-A Calgary Cannons for the entire 2002 season. Despite playing in 121 games in which he batted .315 (144–457) with 15 home runs, 70 RBI and making the Pacific Coast League postseason All-Star team, he did not join the major league club at all throughout the year, even in September when rosters expanded. From 2003 to 2005, Wood played the entire seasons in the Marlins organization with the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes. He batted .296 in 2003, .245 in 2004, and .301 in 2005.\nIn 2006, Wood once again began the season with the Albuquerque Isotopes. He played with the Isotopes for the entire 2006 minor league season. He batted .288 (127–441) with 11 home runs and 77 RBI in 123 games. The Marlins purchased his contract on September 5 following the conclusion of the minor league season. Wood had returned to the major leagues after a six-year absence. On September 9, against the Philadelphia Phillies, he recorded his first major league hit since 1999 when he was with the Detroit Tigers. Overall in the majors in 2006, Wood played in 12 games, mainly as a pinch hitter. He batted .462 (6–13).\nWood was released by the Marlins following the 2006 season, but re-signed with them on January 4, 2007. He had signed a minor league contract that included an invitation to spring training. In spring training, he finished strong, batting .378 (17–45) with 2 home runs in 22 games. This prompted the Marlins to purchase his contract on April 1, 2007, before the regular season began. The Marlins had purchased Wood's contract despite him being a 37-year-old player with barely any major league experience (52 games in parts of 3 different seasons in 16 professional seasons). Wood stayed on the active roster for the whole 2007 season and was mainly used as a pinch hitter. Wood played in 98 games in 2007 and batted .239 with 3 home runs.\nOn April 5, 2008, Wood was designated for assignment by the Marlins to open a roster spot for the recently re-acquired Wes Helms. He spent the rest of the season, his final as a professional, back with the Isotopes.\nPitching.\nWood pitched a total of three innings in his professional career. Two came in 1996 while in the minor leagues. On June 29, 2007, Wood pitched one inning of perfect relief in a 12–3 loss to the Atlanta Braves.\nCoaching career.\nOn October 31, 2008, Wood was announced as the hitting instructor for the Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, however, he was named the hitting coach for Bakersfield Blaze of the Class A-Advanced California League in the Texas Rangers organization on December 29, 2008, and served in that role through the 2010 season. He served as the manager of the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League from 2011 through the 2013 season. He was the manager of the Frisco RoughRiders of the Double-A Texas League for the 2014 season. He served as the manager of the Round Rock Express of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League from 2015 through the 2018 season. In 2019, he became the manager of the Nashville Sounds of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, when they became a Rangers affiliate prior to that season. Wood was released by Texas following the 2019 season.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League)"

Kara was sitting courtside, doing commentary for a Connecticut radio station. The Sun Devils got to within eight at one point in the second half, but Moore and Montgomery combined for eight consecutive points to stretch the lead to 16. ASU would not get within double digits again.\nFinal Four.\nTwo very different games in terms of Final Four experience. In the first game, Oklahoma is in only its second Final Four (the first in 2002) and Louisville is making its first ever Final Four.\nOnly four coaches in NCAA history have multiple NCAA championships, and two of them, Tara VanDerveer and Geno Auriemma, coach the second game.\nLouisville versus Oklahoma.\nLouisville plays the role of newcomer to the Final Four by missing its first 13 shots. Over seven minutes into the game, Louisville has taken their second full timeout, has yet to hit a basket, and is losing 16–2. Louisville shook off the opening jitters and began scoring. Just after the final media timeout of the first half, two Angel McCoughtry free throws would cut the lead to six, but Oklahoma would outscore Louisville 10–4 to take a twelve-point lead into the half.\nThe second half would open up almost a mirror image of the first half. Louisville outscored Oklahoma 15–1 to take their first lead. Oklahoma did not get a basket until more than seven minutes had elapsed. The game would stay close from then on, with never more than a six-point margin by either team. With 18 seconds left in the game Courtney Paris would hit a basket to bring the margin to one. After Candyce Bingham hit one of two free throws, Nyeshia Stevenson took a three-point shot with two seconds left in the game. Her shot rimmed out, and Louisville hung on to win 61–59.\nStanford versus Connecticut.\nConnecticut entered the game having won its last 37 games, but their opponent Stanford was the last team to have beaten them. Just over nine minutes into the game, Stanford led 14–13. Jayne Appel scored ten of Stanford's 14 points, and assisted on one of the other two baskets. Then Renee Montgomery scored nine of UConn's next eleven points and assisted on the other basket in the stretch. Maya Moore added five points, part of an 18–4 run to bring the score to 31–18. Connecticut entered the halftime break with a 13-point lead, one more than they had had the last time they had played a Final Four game in St. Louis: a 2001 game in which, despite the large halftime lead, Notre Dame went to win the game and the Championship.\nThis time was different however. Connecticut scored the first eleven points of the second half, to double up Stanford 48–24. Connecticut led by at least 20 until the last five minutes and won 81–64. Jayne Appel matched Renee Montgomery for high scoring honors with 26, but Connecticut also got 24 from Maya Moore.\nChampionship game – Louisville versus Connecticut.\nLouisville would meet Connecticut for the third time in the season, but it would be the first ever all Big East Championship game. UConn prevailed in the first meeting by 28 points, and won by 39 in the Big East Tournament Championship game.\nAngel McCoughtry tried to change the outcome this time, scoring eleven of Louisville's first 15 points, and assisting on two others, to take a 15–13 lead just over eight minutes into the game. UConn began feeding Tina Charles, who helped pull them to a 14-point lead 39–24, at halftime.\nTina would end the game with 25 points, 19 rebounds, and a trophy for the Most Outstanding Player of the Tournament. Connecticut hit 50% of their field goal tries, holding Louisville to just under 31%.\nConnecticut won 76–54, winning its sixth National Championship, and completing its third perfect season. They would win every game by double digits for the first time in NCAA history.\nBrackets.\nResults to date\nRecord by conference.\nNineteen conferences went 0-1: America East, Atlantic Sun Conference, Big Sky Conference, Big South Conference, Big West Conference, Conference USA, Horizon League, Ivy League, MAAC, MEAC, Missouri Valley Conference, Northeast Conference, Ohio Valley Conference, Patriot League, Southern Conference, Southland, Sun Belt Conference, SWAC, and WAC"

        "text": "The 2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 65 teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that determined the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball national champion for the 2008–09 season. The 71st annual edition of the tournament began on March 17, 2009, and concluded with the championship game on April 6 at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan.\nThe University of North Carolina defeated Michigan State to become the champion. It was the Tar Heels 5th title, and 2nd under Roy Williams. The 2009 tournament was the first time the Final Four had a minimum seating capacity of 70,000, and by having most of the tournament in the February Sweeps of the Nielsen Ratings due to the digital television transition in the United States on June 12, 2009, this was the last NCAA basketball tournament, in all three divisions, to air on analog television.\nPrior to the start of the tournament, the top ranked team was Louisville in both the AP Top 25 and the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Polls, followed by North Carolina, Memphis, and Pittsburgh. Only the Tar Heels of North Carolina were the regional winners and played in the Final Four. The Tar Heels completed one of the most dominant runs in the tournament's history by winning each of their games by at least twelve points.\nFor the first time since seeding began, all #1–#3 seeds made it into the Sweet 16, and for the third consecutive time, all #1 seeds made the Elite Eight.\nFour schools made their NCAA tournament debut, all respective conference champions: Binghamton (America East), Morgan State (MEAC), Stephen F. Austin (Southland), and North Dakota State (Summit), a school in its first season of Division I eligibility.\nTournament procedure.\nSixty-five teams were selected for the tournament. Thirty of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments. The automatic bid of the Ivy League, which does not conduct a postseason tournament, went to Cornell, its regular season champion. The remaining 34 teams were granted \"at-large\" bids by the NCAA Selection Committee.\nTwo teams play an opening-round game, popularly called the \"play-in game\". The winner of that game advances to the main draw of the tournament as a 16 seed and plays a top seed in one of the regionals. The 2009 game was played on Tuesday, March 17, at the University of Dayton Arena in Dayton, Ohio, as it has since its inception in 2001.\nAll 64 teams were seeded 1 to 16 within their regions; the winner of the play-in game automatically received a 16 seed. The Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 65. SEC commissioner Michael Slive served his last year as chairman of the committee.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 2009 tournament:\nOpening Round\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and Finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nQualifying teams.\nAutomatic bids.\nThe following teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2009 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's tournament (except for the Ivy League, whose regular-season champion received the automatic bid).\nListed by region and seeding.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBracket.\nResults to date \nAll times in U.S. ET.\nOpening Round Game – Dayton, Ohio.\nWinner advanced to Midwest Regional vs. (1) Louisville.\nGame summaries.\nMidwest Region.\nGoran Suton of Michigan State was the Midwest regional most outstanding player. He was joined by Spartan teammates Kalin Lucas and Travis Walton, Louisville's Earl Clark and Kansas's Cole Aldrich on the NCAA tournament All-Midwest Regional team.\nFirst round.\nTo play the top-seeded Louisville Cardinals in the first round, Morehead State defeated Alabama State 58–43, with the Eagles keeping the Hornets without a lead the entire game. This marked the first time either team had played in the tournament in five years; the Eagles had not played since 1984. Morehead State fell to Louisville 74–54, the 100th time a 1 seed beat a 16 seed in the tournament since seeding began. However, the Eagles managed to keep the game close until halftime, when Louisville led by only 2 points. In the second half, the Cardinals began to apply their signature fullcourt pressure, forcing turnovers and outscoring Morehead State 22–6 at the beginning of the half. Leon Buchanan's 17 points for the Eagles were not enough to upset Louisville, whose top scorers, Samardo Samuels and Terrence Williams, scored a combined 28 points. Morehead State has not beaten Louisville in 52 years until 2011.\nIn two overtimes, the Siena Saints beat the Ohio State Buckeyes 74–72. Ohio State had the advantage of playing an hour from their campus, and received 25 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists from Evan Turner. The Saints made 6 out of 23 3-pointers and had 22 turnovers. Accordingly, Siena trailed for most of the game, but scored the last four points in regulation to force overtime. At the end of the first overtime, Siena's Ronald Moore drained his first 3-pointer to force a second overtime. With 3.9 seconds left in that overtime, he hit a second three from the same location to give the Saints a late 2-point lead. In an attempt to send the game into a third overtime, Turner shot a 15-footer immediately afterwards, but he missed it. This was Siena's fifth appearance in the tournament, after beating Vanderbilt University in 2008 as a 13 seed.\nThe Arizona-Utah matchup was not as close. The Fifth-seeded Utah Utes were upset by the twelfth-seeded Arizona Wildcats, one of the last teams to make it in the tournament and a questionable entry, by a score of 84–71. The Utes closed the lead to two with roughly five minutes left in the game, but the Wildcats' answer was a 10–1 run. Utah's Luke Nevill committed two fouls less than four minutes into the game and scored only 12 points. Nic Wise of Arizona, meanwhile, led the team with 29 points, with 21 in the second half. Tyler Kepkay led the Utes with a team 19 points in his embarking performance.\nThe Cleveland State-Wake Forest game was an even larger upset. In their second bid in the tournament, the Cleveland State Vikings shocked the Wake Forest Demon Deacons 84–69. This 15-point win ties for third-greatest victory margin for a 13 seed over a 4 seed. Wake Forest, once ranked first in the country, had 16 turnovers in the matchup, compared to six for the Vikings. James Johnson of the Demon Deacons scored 22 points, although this could not compensate for a substandard offense. Their scoring leader, Jeff Teague, finished with 10 points, half his average. For these reasons, Wake Forest never obtained a lead, while Cleveland State sank three consecutive 3-pointers in the early minutes of the game.\nFor the first time in 19 years, Dayton advanced to the second round of the tournament with a win over West Virginia 68–60. This also ended West Virginia's first-round winning streak, which had lasted since 1992. Chris Wright led the Dayton Flyers with 27 points, a career high, while also chalking up 10 rebounds. Charles Little also aided the Flyers with 18 points. Darryl Bryant, who led West Virginia with 21 points, shot two consecutive three-pointers to bring Dayton's lead to 48–47 with 11:02 minutes left in the game. However, that was the closest the Mountaineers had to a lead outside the beginning of the game.\nIn their first eligible year, North Dakota State appeared in the tournament, facing defending champion Kansas. The three-seeded Kansas Jayhawks staved off the fourteenth-seeded Bison's upset bid with an 84–74 victory. Ben Woodside shined with 37 points for the Bison, his sixth game of the season with at least 30 points. However, Sherron Collins and Cole Aldrich proved too much for North Dakota State, accounting for 65 percent of the Jayhawks' points with 32 and 23 respectively.\nThe tenth-seeded USC Trojans demolished the seventh-seeded Boston College Eagles by a score of 72–55, helped by Taj Gibson's 10-for-10 shooting from the field, tied for the second-best NCAA tournament field-goal shooting performance in history. He led the team with 24 points and recorded six rebounds, five assists, and three blocks. Dwight Lewis also added 20 points for the Trojans. After leading 34–30 at halftime, the Eagles scored just a single field goal during one 13-minute stretch, as part of a 23.1 shooting percentage in the second half.\nRobert Morris, the region's 15 seed, was blown away by second-seeded Michigan State 77–62. The game was tied with 4:44 left in the first half, but then the Colonials went almost 20 minutes without scoring a single point. The Spartans took advantage of this for a 21–0 run that sealed the game in their favor. The Colonials' Jeremy Chappell was the only team member to score double-digit points with 11, and he also led the team with six rebounds, two steals, and three blocks. Raymar Morgan was the Spartans' leading scorer with 16 points.\nSecond round.\nNinth-seeded Siena faced top seed Louisville, with the Cardinals emerging victorious 79–72. Taking advantage of Louisville's 19 turnovers, the Saints came back from a 12-point deficit with 17:21 left in the game to snatch the lead around the 9-minute mark. Edwin Ubiles broke through Louisville's full-court pressure and added 24 points for Siena. Terrence Williams, known as one of the most relaxed players on the Cardinals roster, saved his team by grabbing rebounds and making 3s. He led the team with 24 points, 15 rebounds, two steals, and four assists. Earl Clark also helped the Cardinals' cause with 12 points and 12 rebounds.\nIn a 12 vs. 13 seed Cinderella matchup, Arizona handily defeated Cleveland State. The Wildcats' zone defense puzzled Cleveland State, and their fast breaks sealed the game. The smallest deficit the Vikings faced was 48–44 about midway through the second half, though the Wildcats then went on a 13–2 run led by Nic Wise's five consecutive points. His 21 points led the team's four double-digit scorers. Arizona was excellent behind the free-throw line, finishing 24 for 28.\nCole Aldrich's triple-double with 13 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocked shots paved the way for a third-seeded Kansas win over 11 seed Dayton. This was only the sixth triple-double in NCAA tournament history. With 43 points, Dayton scored the fewest points they had all season, compared to Kansas's 60. Despite their small point total, the Flyers shot 72 times, its most all season, amounting to a 22.2 shooting percentage. The Jayhawks were also not having one of their better offensive games, with Sherron Collins being an exception; he made 25 points. This marked the third straight Sweet Sixteen appearance for Kansas.\nPlaying the tenth-seeded USC Trojans, second-seeded Michigan State utilized Travis Walton's career-high 18 points for a 74–69 win. Normally known as a defensive player and averaging 4.9 points per game, Walton shot 8 for 13 from the field. His team out-rebounded USC 33 to 23, and USC made only one three-point play. Star Trojan Taj Gibson was in foul trouble throughout much of the game, and yet his teammates rallied for 14 lead changes and 16 ties. Dwight Lewis, who gave a 19-point performance overall, scored six consecutive points for USC for a late tie. The Spartans only earned a victory after the Trojans missed their last nine shots. With the win, Michigan State has made it to the Sweet 16 eight times of the last 12 years, more than any other team except Duke.\nRegional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen).\nLouisville, the region's top seed, routed twelfth-seeded Arizona 103–64. In NCAA tournament history, this was Louisville's largest win and Arizona's largest loss. It was no surprise, given the Cardinals' 57.6 field goal percentage and their 48% shooting behind the arc. Their fullcourt pressure forced 15 turnovers on the Wildcats the entire game, including nine in the first half. Earl Clark led the Cardinals with 19 points, whose ballhandling garnered 29 assists. This was the most lopsided Sweet 16 victory since 1972.\nThe Michigan State-Kansas matchup was much more intense. After overcoming a 13-point first half deficit, the Spartans won 67–62. They shot 16 of 17 from the foul line, and on their only miss they rebounded the ball and gave Raymar Morgan the only points of the night on a dunk. Such rallies in the second half narrowed the deficit and occasionally took the lead, although the Jayhawks responded and were up by 2 with 2 minutes left in the game. They were helped by Sherron Collins and Cole Aldrich's combined 37 points. However, Kalin Lucas of the Spartans, who had scored 11 points in the first 39 minutes of the game, made seven straight points with 48 seconds left. Goran Suton also added nine rebounds, five steals, and a season-high 20 points for Michigan State.\nRegional final (Elite Eight).\nMichigan State defeated overall number one seed Louisville, 64–52, to advance to their fifth Final Four since 1999. Michigan State held Louisville to their second lowest point total of the season with their man-to-man defense keeping them out of sync all game. Center Goran Suton had 19 points and Durrel Summers had 12 in the rout. Earl Clark had 19 for Louisville.\nWest Region.\nA. J. Price was named MVP of the West Regional. He was joined by teammate Kemba Walker, Missouri's DeMarre Carroll and J. T. Tiller and Memphis' Tyreke Evans on the NCAA West All-regional team.\nFirst round.\nForward Quincy Pondexter scored 23 points to lead his Washington Huskies to a first round 71–58 win over Mississippi State Bulldogs in the West Regional. Only Barry Stewart put up double digit points (14) for the Bulldogs.\nSecond round.\nPac-10 champions Washington Huskies scored 46 points in the second half, but it was not enough to beat the Purdue Boilermakers in the second round of West Regional, falling short by two points (76–74). Leaders for Purdue were JaJuan Johnson with 22 points and Keaton Grant with 12 rebounds. Isaiah Thomas with 24 points and Jon Brockman with 18 rebounds led the Huskies.\nRegional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen).\nConnecticut faced Purdue at University of Phoenix Stadium in a West Regional semifinal. It was UConn who took full advantage of many Purdue mistakes and, even though Robbie Hummel was able to shoot quite well scoring 17 points, it was Hasheem Thabeet and the Huskies who pulled away for a 72–60 win to move onto the regional finals.\nIn the nightcap of the sweet sixteen matchups, two sets of Tigers met, pitting Missouri against Memphis in a matchup that saw teams with similar fast-paced styles meet. Missouri was able to pull away with a 27–7 run that gave them a 64–40 lead. Though Memphis attempted to claw back into the game through Tyreke Evans' 33 points, it was JT Tiller, DeMarre Carroll, and Leo Lyons that moved on to meet UConn in the regional final along with the rest of their Missouri Tigers.\nRegional final (Elite Eight).\nKemba Walker came off the UConn bench to spark them to a victory over the 3 seeded Missouri Tigers.\nEast Region.\nScottie Reynolds was named Regional most outstanding player. He was joined by teammates Dwayne Anderson and Dante Cunningham, Panthers Sam Young and DeJuan Blair on the NCAA East All-Regional team.\nFirst round.\nUCLA Bruins' Alfred Aboya scored two free-throw points with 48 seconds remaining in the game to help UCLA get by VCU in the first round at the East Regional in Philadelphia's Wachovia Center with Maynor's potential game winning jumper bouncing off the rim at the buzzer. Top scorers in the game were Eric Maynor (21) for VCU and Josh Shipp (16) for UCLA.\nVillanova Wildcats, playing at home against an American University team that featured 5 seniors, fell behind early as American hit a barrage of 3 pointers. However, in the 2nd half, Villanova was able to take advantage of 20 free throws in the final 13 minutes of the game to win against American.\nNo. 12 seed Wisconsin upset #5 seed Florida St. 61–59 in OT. Down 31–19 at the half, the Badgers' Jason Bohannon made a three-point jumper to give Wisconsin the lead with 45 seconds left in regulation. Trevon Hughes fouled Toney Douglas, who made two free throws to send the game into over-time. In over-time, the Badgers trailed by one with just seconds left when Hughes made a twisting shot from the lane over two defenders to put the Badgers ahead 60–59. Hughes was also fouled on the shot, and made the resulting free throw to make the score 61–59. Florida State had just enough time to run a full court in-bounds play but, the pass was deflected at half court thus securing the Badger victory.\nSecond round.\nBy six Wildcats scoring double-digit points, Villanova ended UCLA's hope of going to the Final Four for the fourth time in a row. Dante Cunningham had 18 points; Reggie Redding and Corey Fisher had 13; Corey Stokes put up 12; eleven points came from Scottie Reynolds and ten points were put up by Dwayne Anderson for the winning team. Josh Shipp had 18 points and Alfred Aboya had 8 rebounds for UCLA.\nRegional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen).\nVillanova (#3) upset Duke (#2), 77–54, to advance to the Regional Championship game to face Pittsburgh (#1). The Wildcats, who were ahead by 3 at half-time, were led in scoring by Scottie Reynolds (16), Dante Cunningham (14) and Reggie Redding (11).\nRegional final (Elite Eight).\nNumber one seed Pittsburgh was upset by the Villanova Wildcats, 78–76 in the East Regional Finals, denying the Panthers a chance for a first national championship in men's basketball. With five seconds remaining, Levance Fields, who was fouled by Corey Fisher, shot two free-throws to tie the game for Pitt. But Scottie Reynolds' one-second jumper was good to give Villanova an upset victory. Pitt's Sam Young scored 28 points and DeJuan Blair had 20 points. Dwayne Anderson was top scorer for the Wildcats with 17 points.\nSouth Region.\nTy Lawson was the South regional MVP and he was joined on the All-regional team by teammates Danny Green and Tyler Hansbrough as well as Blake Griffin and Syracuse's Jonny Flynn.\nFirst round.\nWKU advanced to the second round for a second consecutive year as a 12 seed, beating 5th seeded Illinois. 10th seeded Michigan upset 7th seeded Clemson 62–59 in its first tournament win since 1998. It was Michigan's first tournament appearance in 11 years after the school was rocked with sanctions and punishments from the Chris Webber scandal in the mid-2000s.\nFinal Four.\nAll final four teams in the tournament had won at least one national championship. Entering the tournament, North Carolina had the most, with four (1957, 1982, 1993, 2005); Connecticut had two; (1999, 2004); Michigan State also had two; (1979, 2000), and Villanova won one; (1985).\nThe Spartans had home court advantage by playing in their home state. Six teams have played the Final Four in their home states, but only four of them won. UCLA (1968, 1972, 1975) and North Carolina State (1974) won the national title, but Duke (1994) and Purdue (1980) lost in the Final Four. The biggest advantage came in 1968 and 1972 when UCLA played the championship game at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, which is a short distance from Pauley Pavilion, their home court since 1965.\nMichigan State vs. Connecticut.\nMichigan State, with 7 minutes to play, finally took hold of the game and defeated the number one seed Connecticut to advance to the championship game against North Carolina. The Spartans started the game with a 7-point run, but the Huskies came back to take a lead in the first half. Michigan State took it back and was leading by two at the half. Connecticut had the lead twice early in the second period. Michigan State, led by guard Kalin Lucas with 21 points and forward Raymar Morgan with 18 points, was just too much at the end for the Huskies. Scoring for Connecticut was shared by Jeff Adrien (13), Stanley Robinson (15), Hasheem Thabeet (17) and A.J. Price (15).\nVillanova vs. North Carolina.\nAfter the first five minutes, North Carolina used an 11-point run to end Villanova's hope for a national championship and put the Tar Heels into the championship game for a chance to win their fifth title in nine trips. Ty Lawson produced 22 points, followed by Wayne Ellington with 20 points and Tyler Hansbrough with 18 points. Hansbrough, the sixth-leading scorer in tournament history, pulled down 11 rebounds. For Roy Williams, who coached North Carolina to a national championship in 2005, it is back to the title game again.\nChampionship game – Michigan State vs. North Carolina.\nThis 71st title game featured #1 seed North Carolina, which had a 4–4 record in the finals, versus #2 seed Michigan State, which had a 2–0 record going into the game. It was also a matchup featuring future Hall of Fame coach Tom Izzo, who guided Michigan State to the championship in 2000 and 5 trips to the Final Four, against current Hall of Famer Roy Williams, who won the title in 2005 and reached 7 Final Fours.\nTo celebrate the 30th anniversary of the 1979 national title game between Michigan State Spartans and the Sycamores of Indiana State, Hall of Fame players Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson and Larry Bird, who had played against each other, presented the game ball at the 2009 NCAA national championship game Monday night.\nThe game was a rematch of \"BasketBowl II\", of 2008's ACC-Big Ten Challenge, won by the Tar Heels 98–63. That game was also played at Ford Field.\nNorth Carolina, with a first bucket from Deon Thompson, took off and ran to a 21-point lead at the 10-minute mark. The lead grew to 24 with less than 5 minutes remaining in the first half, with most points coming from Wayne Ellington (15). The Spartans were behind 34–55 at the half, a tournament record lead for the Tar Heels. Goran Suton had the most points for Michigan State.\nIn the second half, Michigan State made a comeback to within 13 points of North Carolina with 4:56 to go in the game, but was unable to overcome the record 21 turnovers. Roy Williams and his Tar Heels defeated the Spartans 89–72 to take home his second trophy for the university. Ty Lawson set a record with 8 steals.\nRecord by conference.\nThe America East, Atlantic Sun, Big Sky, Big South, Big West, CAA, Ivy, MAC, MEAC, MVC, NEC, Patriot, Southland, SoCon, SWAC, Summit, and WAC conferences all went 0–1.\nThe columns R32, S16, E8, F4, and CG respectively stand for the Round of 32, Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight, Final Four, and championship Game.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nOnce again, except for the play-in game, which was telecast on ESPN, CBS and CBS College Sports Network served as broadcasters on television for the tournament. The only change from past years at the Final Four was that Jim Nantz worked with Clark Kellogg in the color commentary position instead of Billy Packer, who left CBS in July 2008.\nFor the play-in game in Dayton, ESPN had Brent Musburger, Steve Lavin and Erin Andrews working as the announcers.\nSome CBS affiliates put additional game broadcasts on digital subchannels, or, as in the following two instances, on other stations:\nRadio.\nWestwood One was once again the radio home for the tournament.\nInternational broadcasters.\nYahoo! Sports and NCAA.com also broadcast the entire tournament live for free on the internet."

        "title": "Daytona 500 Experience",
        "text": "The Daytona 500 Experience, formerly known as Daytona USA, was an interactive motorsports attraction and museum located at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Intrinsically linked to the Daytona 500, the museum primarily focused on exhibits related to NASCAR. The attraction also included exhibits related to the Daytona 200 motorcycle race, the 24 Hours of Daytona, as well as the Daytona Beach &amp; Road Course.\nThe attraction opened in 1996. In 2005, the site was one of the finalists to host the NASCAR Hall of Fame. After losing the hall of fame bid, due to high operating costs and low attendance, parent company International Speedway Corporation announced on November 6, 2010 that the attraction would no longer be open to the public but would be available only for private functions.\nAfter being closed to the public for four years, it was announced in 2014 that the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America would relocate to the site. The new expanded and refurbished museum opened in February 2017.\nHistory.\nThrough 1995, Daytona International Speedway featured a modest two-story visitors’ center outside of the oval's fourth turn. The first floor of the visitors' center housed the ticket office and a small sampling of racing memorabilia; the second floor was home to a wall of photographs of previous Daytona 500 winners. The Speedway also offered track tours on open-air trams.\nIn mid- to late-1995, the visitors center was closed and a new destination-style, interactive museum was designed to take its place. The attraction opened in July 1996 during the 1996 Pepsi 400 using the name Daytona USA. (It should not be confused with the arcade game of the same name, though the game is featured in the attraction's arcade.) The attraction was awarded the Themed Entertainment Association's Thea Award of Outstanding Achievement in September 1997.\nThe attraction was expanded by in July 2001. The renovation added two motion simulators: an IWERKS motion simulator ride called \"Daytona Dream Laps\" and the full-motion simulator \"Acceleration Alley\". A third simulator, \"Toyota Tundra's Thunder Road\", was added in 2003. Daytona USA celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2006 by adding the \"Daytona 500 Champion's Walk of Fame\" to the walkway in front of the building. On July 1, 2007, Daytona USA was renamed the Daytona 500 Experience.\nExhibits.\nThe attraction boasted several exhibit areas, simulators and interactive displays. Some of these remain active for private functions, however the IMAX presentation will no longer be shown.\nThe Champion's Walk of Fame, a Hollywood-esque concrete walk paying homage to winners of the Daytona 500 since the attraction opened in 1996, is just outside the building, as are statues of NASCAR great Dale Earnhardt and NASCAR founder Bill France Jr. and his wife Anne. Also on display inside the attraction are the NASCAR championship trophy and the Harley J. Earl Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the Daytona 500.\nThe Daytona 500 Experience also once housed an arcade that featured many racing-themed arcade games, one of which was Sega's wildly popular \"Daytona USA\", with which the attraction formerly shared its name with.\nThe Daytona 500 Experience also hosted fan forums during race time and was home to the Richard Petty Driving Experience from April through October. During Bike Week and Biketoberfest, the Daytona 500 Experience was transformed into \"D5X\", an air conditioned haven for bikers featuring live bands, food and motorcycle exhibits.\nThe two different speedway tours that the attraction featured are still offered by the speedway with some modifications: the 30-minute general admission tour and a new, 60-minute All-Access tour that is available to the public for a higher fee and covers more ground.\nDaytona 500 connection.\nSince 1997, the winning car from the Daytona 500 is impounded and displayed for the next twelve months at the Daytona 500 Experience. It is a popular but controversial display, and a highlight exhibit of the museum.\nAll winners are contractually required to surrender their winning car and all its parts, in uncleaned, complete, and unaltered condition, as explicitly specified on the race entry form. This practice is often criticized by participants because it prevents the team from driving the car (clearly a successful chassis) in the other races during the season. They argued it potentially put them at a competitive disadvantage during the rest of the NASCAR season, most notably at the other restrictor plate races. Only twice since this display arrangement was adopted in 1997 was the winner of the Daytona 500 able to take a different car, as required, and gone on to win the next restrictor plate race (Talladega): Jeff Gordon in 2005 and Jimmie Johnson in 2006. By the time the car is returned, approximately 364 days after the victory, it is usually considered obsolete and a write-off.\nThe morning after the race the winning car is inducted into the museum during the Champion's Breakfast ceremony. In some years, the driver's helmet, driving suit, or other race-used paraphernalia are also included for display. The driver also has the honor of unveiling the logo for next year's Daytona 500."

        "text": "The men's 25 kilometres was one of three cycling events, all track cycling, on the Cycling at the 1900 Summer Olympics programme that were open to all amateurs, had more than one nation participating and no handicapping. It was held on 15 September. Ten cyclists competed. Four had already competed in the sprint event. The result of the race proved Louis Bastien of France to be the top long-distance cyclist present, while Lloyd Hildebrand finished in second and Auguste Daumain in third. One of the contestants, Louis Trousselier, would go on to win the 1905 Tour de France. Prizes were awarded to the top four finishers: art objects valued at 400 francs (for first place), 300 francs (for second), 200 francs (third), and 100 francs (fourth).\nBackground.\nFrom 1896 to 1924 (excluding 1912, when no track events were held), the track cycling programme included events at a variety of distances that changed from Games to Games and ranged from the -mile to the 100 kilometres (and, even longer, the unique 12 hours race in 1896 that saw finishers exceed 300 kilometres). The 25 kilometres was held only in 1900. Louis Bastien was the favorite, having won the 100 kilometres world championship, with John Henry Lake (the sprint bronze medalist) and Lloyd Hildebrand also expected to do well.\nCompetition format.\nAs the name suggests, the race was 25 kilometres in length. The track was 500 metres in length, so there were 50 laps. A single race was held.\nResults.\nBastien took the lead early. Lake and Hildebrand were close behind, until Lake dropped out. Bertrand was 3 laps behind."

Eight fencers took part, with the preliminary fencing involving a round-robin held in two groups. The first group was Pierrakos-Mavromichalis, Delaborde, Callot, and Poulos. The second was Komninos-Miliotis, Balakakis, Gravelotte, and Vouros. The two fencers that were undefeated in their groups faced each other in the final for gold and silver medals, while Pierrakos-Mavromichalis and Vouros were awarded third place. Vouros's second win came from a forfeit by Komninos-Miliotis.\nBackground.\nThis was the first appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event).\nCompetition format.\nThe event featured a pool-play semifinals round followed by a single final. Each bout was to three touches. Standard foil rules were used, including that touches had to be made with the tip of the foil, the target area was limited to the torso, and priority determined the winner of double touches. One unusual rule was that the president could award a touch for an off-target strike if the defender had improperly obscured the target area. The pool round consisted of two pools of four fencers each, with each pool fencing a round-robin. The winner of each pool advanced to the final, which was a single bout between the two fencers.\nSchedule.\nThe fencing began at 10 a.m. on the second day of events.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nSemifinal A.\nThe Official Report has de Laborde losing to Poulos, 3–1, but other sources indicate de Laborde won 3–2. The latter is shown below.\nSemifinal B.\nThe match between Vouros and Komninos-Miliotis was forfeited by Komninos-Miliotis, sometimes credited as a 3–0 win for Vouros.\nFinal.\nIn the final, the two undefeated Frenchmen faced each other. Gravelotte won in a close bout.\nFinal classification.\nThe IOC website provides a full classification of the eight fencers. De Laborde is placed above Komninos-Miliotis, apparently due to Komninos-Miliotis not starting his bout against Vouros. It is unclear why Balakakis is placed above Poulos, who had a better touches for record."

It was the only event at the Games for professional athletes and was held immediately after the amateur event on 7 April. It consisted of a single match, between Leonidas Pyrgos of Greece and Joanni Perronet of France. Pyrgos won the match, 3–1, to become the first Greek champion in the modern Olympics.\nBackground.\nThis was the first appearance of the event, which was held only once more. Fencing masters were an exception to the amateurs-only nature of the early Olympics. Masters fencing was held as an Olympic event in 1896 (men's foil only) and 1900 (all three weapons for men, as well as a special event in épée that pitted the top professionals against the top amateurs). By 1904, only amateur events were conducted.\nCompetition format.\nWith only two fencers, the competition consisted of a single bout. The bout was to three touches.

Sabre rules were used, except that the target area was the entire body (rather than being limited to above the waist). The competition consisted of a single pool round of five fencers, with the pool fencing a round-robin. Thus, a total of ten matches were held and each fencer faced every other fencer.\nSchedule.\nThe sabre was held in the morning of the fourth day of events..\nResults.\nThe competition began before the king and crown prince arrived to watch; when they arrived after two rounds of fencing, the officials restarted the competition. Before the restart, Schmal had beaten Georgiadis and Nielsen; after the restart, he lost to both men.\nGeorgiadis was undefeated and thus won the gold medal. Karakalos had lost only to Georgiadis, while Nielsen had lost to those two and no others. Schmal's only victory was over Iatridis, who lost all four of his matches."

        "text": "Kingston Rowing Club (KRC) is a rowing club in England founded in 1858 and a member club of British Rowing.\nThe club is located on the River Thames at Kingston upon Thames, downstream and north-east of Kingston Bridge and Kingston Railway Bridge. On a long wide stretch, its rowers and scullers have the final and the second longest section of the weir-controlled river. Kingston have produced a significant list of international level oarsmen and oarswomen throughout its history and has won events at the British Rowing Championships and Henley Royal Regatta through the years.\nKingston Rowing Club is the supporting club for Kingston Regatta which is held above Kingston Bridge. Kingston organises Kingston Head of the River Race which is a warm-up for the national Head of the River Race on the Championship Course on the following weekend.\nHistory.\nThe club started at Messenger's Boathouse, Kingston and was housed there for three years before moving upstream. From 1861 to 1935 the club was based above the bridges on Raven's Ait in Surbiton to the south. In 1935 the club moved downstream to premises known as the Albany Boathouse then moved to its purpose-built facilities in Canbury Gardens in 1968.\nFacilities.\nThe club is the racing shell rowing club in Kingston upon Thames, but also provides training boats for less competitive rowing. It is on the \"Kingston Reach\" which runs between Molesey Lock by Hampton Court down to Teddington Lock ; The reach is a long V-shaped stretch of the Thames and is the final and second longest section of the River Thames — the longest reach being Wallingford reach at in Oxfordshire.\nIt shares the long, wide stretch with three sailing clubs upstream and downstream, the Royal Canoe Club (and The Skiff Club), Walbrook Rowing Club (the rowing club of Teddington), and school clubs of Tiffin, Kingston Grammar, and Surbiton High schools.\nKingston Students Rowing Club.\nKingston Students Rowing Club (KSRC) was founded in 1972 as the Kingston Polytechnic Boat Club (KPBC). After 1992, Kingston Polytechnic was granted university status and the club changed its name to Kingston University Boat Club (KUBC).\nIn 2011, Kingston University Boat Club (KUBC) became Kingston Students Rowing Club (KSRC). KRC took over the training and coaching from Kingston University, maintain its fleet of boats and acquired its launches.

        "title": "Leinster Senior Cup (rugby union)",
        "text": "The Leinster Senior Cup is a major rugby competition in Ireland, involving all senior rugby clubs in Leinster, i.e., clubs from Leinster competing in the All-Ireland League. From 2006 until 2016 it was known as the Leinster Senior League Cup during the period when the Leinster Senior League had been discontinued, but reverted to its traditional name for the 2016–17 season upon the revival of the Senior League. From 2011 to 2016 only the top senior teams competed and those in the lower divisions of the All-Ireland League competed for the Leinster Senior League Shield.\nHistory.\nThe Inaugural Leinster Challenge Cup.\nThe Leinster Challenge Cup competition was founded in the 1881–82 season. A meeting of the Leinster Branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union took place at John Lawrence's Rooms (Sports Outfitters) at 63 Grafton Street on Monday 31 October 1881. The meeting was chaired by William Joshua Goulding, Hon. President I.R.F.U. (1880–81) and was attended by representatives of Dundalk, Dublin University, Kingstown, Lansdowne, Phoenix, Rathmines School, and Wanderers Football Clubs. During the meeting questions were posed and answers given about the proposed All-Ireland Challenge Cup competition. Arising from this discussion, W.O. Neville (Dundalk proposed, seconded by H. Morrell (Dublin University), that a Leinster Challenge Cup be established to advance and encourage rugby football in Leinster. The Leinster Challenge Cup would be open to all clubs in Leinster affiliated to the Union. The meeting decided that a circular should be sent to all Leinster clubs inviting their participation and subscriptions to the Cup Fund. A further meeting of the Leinster Branch I.R.F.U. took place on Friday 11 November 1881 to consider the rules, dates of matches, drawing of rounds and other competition details. At this meeting a Challenge Cup Committee was formed. The closing date for entries to the inaugural Leinster Challenge Cup was set for Wednesday 30 November.\nThe Challenge Cup Committee - C.B. Croker (Lansdowne), the first Hon. Treasurer of the Leinster Branch, G. Drought (Phoenix), F. Kennedy (Wanderers), first Hon. Secretary of the Leinster Branch, E.A. McCarthy (Kingstown), H. Morrell (Dublin University) and Richard M. Peter (Dundalk) - meet on Thursday 1 December to draw up the ties. The Committee decided on an entry fee of ten shillings per club, that all clubs entering the competition should guarantee a donation to the Cup Fund of at least two guineas, that all matches were to be played at Lansdowne Road, that the ground was to be engaged for several matches and that the proceeds of a 6d (six penny) gate were to be added to the Cup Fund. Clubs were allowed to nominate their own umpires. The Committee proposed to purchase, if possible, a Challenge Cup costing some £50. Through the press, the Committee encouraged \"lovers of the noble game\" to attend matches and to support the Cup Fund.\nThe names of the five clubs which had entered, each of whom had guaranteed to donate £5 to the Cup Fund, were placed in a hat and drawn as follows: Match A: Dublin University v Phoenix, on the Wanderers Club portion of the Lansdowne Road grounds; Match B: Wanderers v Kingstown, on the Lansdowne Club portion of the grounds; Match C: Lansdowne, a bye. The first round ties were played on Saturday 10 December 1891, k.o. 2.45 pm, with two forty minute halves. The winner of Match A would play Lansdowne on Saturday 25 February 1882 for a place in the final. The Winner of Match B was to get a bye to the final, which would be played on Saturday 25 March 1882. The reasons for the long interval between the first and second rounds were Christmas holidays which extended into January and the International matches on 31 January (Wales), 7 February (England) and 14 February (Scotland). In the event of a Wanderers v Lansdowne meeting in the second round, the club captains would toss for choice of ground at Lansdowne Road. In the event of a draw at any stage, the Cup Committee would fix a date for a second match to be played, so as not to alter the existing rules of the game.\nThe first round matches resulted in a win for Dublin University (5 goals, 2 tries) over Phoenix (nil) - a goal equals a converted try, while the Wanderers v. Kingstown match was a scoreless draw. The Wanderers v Kingstown tie was replayed on Thursday 23 February 1882. Kingstown won by a goal and a try to nil. The second round match between Dublin University v Lansdowne resulted in a win for Trinity by 2 goals (1 converted try, 1 dropped goal) and 2 tries to nil. On 18 March, \"in the presence of one of the largest attendances of spectators that has ever been seen on the ground\", the inaugural Leinster Challenge Cup Final between Dublin University v Kingstown was won by Trinity by one goal to nil and the title of the premier club of the province for the season. Both clubs were photographed before the match by Messrs Robinson of Grafton Street. The members of the winning team were presented with silver crosses. The reports on the match do not mention presentation of the Challenge Cup to the DUFC Captain. In celebration the Trinity students living in Botany Bay in College lit an enormous bonfire with a pyrotechnic display of fireworks. The Cup appears to have been first presented to the winning captain in 1883.\nLeinster Senior Cup.\nFrom 1882 through 1897 newspaper reports refer to this competition consistently as 'The Leinster Challenge Cup'. From 1898 through 2006, press reports refer to the competition as 'The Leinster Senior Cup'. How and why did this change in title come about? The change in reference title probably had more to do with semantics rather than any change(s) in the rules governing the competition. At a General Meeting of the Leinster Branch of the I.R.F.U. held in the Wicklow Hotel on 11 November 1888, a resolution was adopted to inaugurate a Leinster Junior Cup competition on the same basis as applied to the Leinster Challenge Cup. Following the Hon. Treasurer's report to the Annual General Meeting a month earlier, it had been proposed that the Leinster Branch purchase a 'Challenge Cup' for such competition. At the Leinster Branch A.G.M in October 1891, a motion that the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs be allowed to compete in the Leinster Junior Cup was rejected. Essentially the same motion returned the Leinster Branch AGM in October 1895, but was amended to refer the matter to a subcommittee to draft rules to govern the proposed competition under which the latter might be approved and discussion adjourned to the next General Meeting. At the reconvened meeting in November 1895, delegates were informed that the original motion had been withdrawn because of intense opposition. The meeting then reconstituted itself as a special meeting to consider a new resolution \"that a Cup be presented by the Leinster Branch for competition amongst Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis\". After much discussion and consideration of umpteen amendments and counter proposals, the final phrase of the original motion was amended to read \"amongst Junior Clubs and Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis\". This was passed unanimously. Thus the Leinster Branch I.R.F.U. from the 1886–87 season now had a Leinster Junior Cup, the winners of which received a Challenge Cup, a Junior League Cup for Junior Clubs and the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs, and a Leinster Challenge Cup, contested by Senior Clubs. Thus, to avoid confusion in reports of competitions, the Leinster Challenge Cup became referred to as the Leinster Senior Cup, the winners of which were presented with the original Challenge Cup.\nFrom 1940 to 1947 Old Belvedere completed the still unrivalled feat of winning the Leinster Senior Cup 7 consecutive times, narrowly losing their 8th consecutive final to Wanderers. This broke the next longest sequence of wins by Lansdowne from 1927 through 1931, who had broken the record of four consecutive wins by Dublin University from 1895 through 1898.\nLeinster Senior League Cup.\nIn recent times the competition declined in importance due to the introduction of the All-Ireland League in the 1990–91 season and the formation of a professional provincial team, Leinster, to compete in the Heineken Cup. Following the demise of the Leinster Senior League some time around 2006, the two competitions were combined as the Leinster Senior League Cup. From 2011-12 until 2015-16 senior teams from the lower divisions of the All-Ireland League have participated in the Leinster Senior League Shield instead of the League Cup. Thus competition inaugurated in 1882 continues to be contested by the strongest clubs in the province of Leinster. While the name of the competition has changed, the original Challenge Cup trophy is still presented.\nThe Leinster Senior League Cup competition has evolved over the past decade. In 2006-07 the top 8 teams of 20 in the league progressed to quarter-finals. From season 2007-08 through 2010-11 there were five Pools of four teams; within each Pool the teams played each other once. The winner of each Pool plus the best three runners-up from the five pools on points (and points scored for and against difference) qualified for the quarter-finals. In seasons 2011-12 and 2012-13 there were two Sections A and B, with the winners and runners-up in each section qualifying for the semi-finals. The winner of Section A played the Runner-up of Section B in the semi-final and \"vice versa\". In season 2013-14 the winners of the two Sections qualified directly for the final. In seasons 2014-15 and 2015-16 there were three Sections A, B and C; within each Section the clubs played each other once. The winner of each Section and the best runner-up on points (and points scored for and against difference) progressed to the semi-finals.\nLeinster Senior Cup.\nFrom 2016 to 2017, the Senior League was revived, and the Senior Cup reverted to a knock-out format.\nThe winners of the Leinster Senior League Cup compete with the other three provincial cup winners for the All-Ireland Cup.\nThe Challenge Cup trophy.\nThe report of the 1883 Leinster Challenge Cup final in the \"Irish Times\" contains a description of the Challenge Cup: \"The Cup, which is a solid silver, and is very massive, is in the Etruscan style. The body is elegantly ornamented in the highest style of the silversmith's art. On one side is a view of a football field and pavilion, showing a scrummage in full progress. On the top of the lid there is a beautifully modelled figure in correct football costume in the art of \"dropping\". The cup stands on a handsome ebony plinth, around which are slung on chains four massive silver shields on which to inscribe the names of the successful clubs. The work has been executed by Messrs Edmond Johnston of Grafton Street and is finished in the style for which the house has become so justly celebrated.\" Edmond Johnston achieved renown as a silversmith for two works in particular. He made the Liam MacCarthy All-Ireland Hurling Cup in 1921. He worked on the restoration of the Ardagh Chalice and was given permission to make replicas of it which were exhibited at the expositions in Chicago in 1893, Paris in 1900 and Glasgow in 1901. An EJ intertwined was his maker's mark."

        "text": "Thomas Robert Davis (born December 3, 1938) is an American former college men's basketball coach. He served as the head coach at Lafayette College, Boston College, Stanford University, the University of Iowa, and Drake University from 1971 to 2007.\nEarly life.\nA native of Ridgeway, Wisconsin, Davis attended the University of Wisconsin–Platteville, where he played on the basketball team as a point guard. He was interested in politics, and between his junior and senior years of college, held a congressional internship for Wisconsin state senator Alexander Wiley.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from UW–Platteville, at the age of 21, Davis took over as head coach at Milledgeville High School in Milledgeville, Illinois for the 1960–61 school year. He attempted to mimic the martinet coaching style of his own college mentor, John Barth, but concluded that \"You have to be yourself. What works for someone else isn't going to work for you just because it worked for him.\"\nFrom 1961 to 1966, Davis was head coach at Portage High School in Portage, Wisconsin. While there, he faced a dilemma in allotting playing time to his players, most of whom he believed were good enough to warrant it. Davis awarded playing time to all deserving players, which gave rise to his philosophy of constantly pressing and rotating players in an effort to wear down the opposing team.\nDavis earned a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In 1967, Frank Fellows took over as head coach at the University of Maryland, and hired Davis onto his staff. While serving as an assistant at Maryland, Davis earned his doctorate in history.\nLafayette College.\nDavis began his coaching career at Lafayette College in 1971. During his six-year tenure at the school, he posted a 116–44 record, advancing to the NIT in 1972 and 1975. Future Maryland head coach Gary Williams, who had played as a point guard under Davis at Maryland, served as one of his assistants at Lafayette.\nBoston College.\nIn 1977, Davis became the head coach at Boston College. The Eagles compiled a 100–47 record earning two trips to the NCAA Tournament and a trip to the NIT.\nStanford &amp; Iowa.\nHe would accept a position at Stanford University before taking over as the head coach at the University of Iowa in 1986. While at Iowa, he led the Hawkeyes to nine NCAA Tournaments, including a pair of Sweet Sixteen appearances as well as an Elite Eight. The Hawkeyes also made two NIT appearances. He is the winningest coach in the University of Iowa history.\nHis team was ranked number one during the 1986–87 season. The Hawkeyes won a school record thirty games before eventually being beaten in the Regional Final of the NCAA Tournament by UNLV 84–81.\nOn April 2, 1998, after Iowa lost in the first round of the NIT, Davis announced that he would resign after his contract would expire in the following season. Athletic director Bob Bowlsby notified Davis that he would not renew his contract. In Davis's final season, Iowa advanced to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1988.\nDrake University.\nDavis was named Drake University's 23rd head basketball coach on April 22, 2003. In four short seasons, Davis re-energized a Bulldog program that had not had a winning season since the 1985–86 season. He led Drake to a 17–15 record; including winning the Big Four Series, Drake Regency Challenge, and Sun Bowl Tournament.\nRetirement.\nOn March 21, 2007 Davis announced his retirement from college coaching. His son Keno Davis took over as head basketball coach at Drake University. Davis’ career included sixteen 20-win seasons, eighteen post season appearances, and he was named Associated Press National Coach of the Year in 1987. In 2008, he was inducted into the University of Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame for his success as a coach during his tenure there. He currently lives in the Iowa City area with his wife Shari."

There had been 59 delegates at the March 1860 annual meeting, and 55 at the next annual meeting that December (on a new baseball calendar), who thereby intended to play during the 1861 season that the war curtailed. Nine of 59 and eleven of 55 were from outside Greater New York."

        "text": "At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Brazil participated for the 18th time in the event. The country remained as the only national team to have participated in every installment of the FIFA World Cup.\nThe Brazilian team reached the quarter-finals, where they were defeated by France, finishing the tournament in the fifth place — for the fourth time in history after 1954, 1982 and 1986.\nQualifying.\nBrazil's qualifying for the event marked the first time in history in which a returning champion (the country had won the 2002 World Cup) had to play for a berth in the next World Cup — that had a direct effect in the organization of the 2006 World Cup: since the 1990 World Cup, the competition has had an opening match, which is played immediately after the Opening Ceremonies; until the last World Cup, this match was a privilege of the winner of the previous World Cup, who would play its first match as the first match of the given World Cup, against an opponent from its group, as decided by the official draw (in the 1990 World Cup, Argentina, winner of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, played Cameroon in the opening match; in 1994, Germany, winner of the 1990 World Cup, played Bolivia; in 1998, Brazil played Scotland and in 2002 France played Senegal). As of the 2006 World Cup, because of the change in the rules, with the last champion no longer having a secured berth in the competition, the opening match has become another privilege of the host nation (in the 2006 World Cup, Germany, as the host nation, played Costa Rica in the opening match). Despite being the returning champion, the Brazilian team debuted, against Croatia, only four days after the Opening Ceremonies and the opening match.\nThe national team qualified with more ease than in previous years. For the 1994 World Cup, Brazil only qualified in the very last match, against Uruguay, where a defeat would have meant missing out on the tournament. For the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Brazil had four different managers, and was once in serious jeopardy of being left out of the event.\nThe Qualifying for the 2006 World Cup repeated the format installed for the previous Qualifying tournament, in 2000 and 2001 (for the 2002 World Cup): all ten South American countries played each other, in two-leg matches, with the top four teams qualifying automatically for the World Cup, whereas the fifth-best team would play the champion of Oceania, which was Australia, for a berth in the World Cup.\nBrazil finished first, winning the Qualifying tournament. The results were the following:\nThe final standings were the following:\nWorld Cup preparation.\nA month before the start of the competition, the Brazil national team took quarters in the small Swiss town of Weggis, at the Weggis Park Hotel. The objective was to get the team accustomed to Germany's climate while maintaining the focus on the competition. The preparation started on 22 May and ended on 4 June.\nDuring this time, the Brazilian team played two friendly matches. The first was on 28 May, against the under-20 team of the Brazilian club Fluminense, which was in Europe to play a tournament and took a detour to Switzerland to meet and play the national team; this match ended 13–1 in favour of the national team. The second match was played against the state team of the Swiss Lucerne. The match took place in Basel, at the St. Jakob Stadion and was won by the Brazilian team with a score of 8 goals to nul.\nFor this period in Switzerland, the Brazilian Football Confederation sold the rights to explore the presence of the national team to a Swiss events enterprise. In exchange for the declared amount of US$1.2 million, the Swiss company was allowed to sell tickets for the practice sessions — which were sold at €40 each, for about 5,000 people per session —, negotiate permissions for vending points to operate within the training facility and surrounding area — which were sold for about €2,000 plus 10% of the profit — and to organize and explore the friendly matches that the national team was to play during its preparation in Switzerland.\nOn 31 May, only 13 days away from the team's debut in the World Cup, defender Edmílson was cut from the squad due to a knee injury he had sustained during the practice session the day prior. São Paulo's Mineiro was called to take his place.\nUpon leaving Weggis, on 4 June the national team made a stop in Geneva on 5 June to play its last friendly match before arriving in Germany. There, the team played New Zealand at the Stade de Genève – refereed by Jerome Laperriere – defeating New Zealand 4–0.\nFinally, the team travelled to the German town of Königstein im Taunus, which invested the declared amount of €500,000 in order to prepare for receiving the Brazilian team.\nDraw.\nTraditionally, the host nation (in this case, Germany) is the first seed, being placed in Group A. On 6 December 2005, so as to prevent a possible match between Brazil and Germany before the final, FIFA placed the previous competition champion as the sixth seed, in Group F. The opponents of the Brazilian team in the first stage were, respectively, Croatia, Australia and Japan.\nHistory.\nRound Robin\nThe Brazilian team had never faced any of its first round opponents before in World Cups. But other matches, both official and friendly ones, have taken place. The history of those matches until, but not including, the 2006 World Cup is as follows:\nsource\nRound of 16\nPrior to their meeting in the Round of 16 of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Brazil and Ghana had played only one friendly match. Although this was officially a match between the two main teams, Brazil played it using its under-23 team (the so-called \"Olympic squad\"), as the match was a part of the preparation for the football competition of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games.\nsource\nQuarterfinal\nBoth the first and the last matches between Brazil and France prior to their 2006 World Cup quarterfinal encounter were friendly matches. The last one was a commemorative display for FIFA's centennial anniversary.\nSources:\nWorld Cup squad.\n\"Pld = matches played, YC = yellow cards, RC = red cards.\"\n1 Mineiro replaced Edmílson, who was cut due to a knee injury.\nMatches.\n\"All times local (UTC+2)\"\nRound robin.\nGroup F\nFirst Round\nBrazil vs Croatia\nTuesday, 13 June 2006\n21:00 - Olympiastadion, Berlin - Attendance: 72,000\nSecond Round\nBrazil vs. Australia\nSunday, 18 June 2006\n18:00 - FIFA World Cup Stadium Munich, Munich - Attendance: 66,000\nThird Round\nBrazil vs Japan\nThursday, 22 June 2006\n21:00 - FIFA World Cup Stadium Dortmund, Dortmund - Attendance: 65,000\nKnockout stage.\nRound of 16 – Brazil vs Ghana\nTuesday, 27 June 2006\n17:00 - FIFA WM-Stadion Dortmund, Dortmund - Attendance: 65,000\nQuarterfinal – Brazil vs France\nSaturday, 1 July 2006\n21:00 - FIFA WM-Stadion Frankfurt, Frankfurt - Attendance: 52,000\nBrazilians in other national teams.\nThe Brazilian participation in the World Cup was not restricted to the national football team. Many individuals were involved with other national teams, some as players, some as members of their teams' technical staff. Those playing for other national teams had acquired the respective country's citizenship, and according to FIFA's ruling, can never play for the Brazilian team in the future. Those were:"

        "title": "Rugby union in Spain",
        "text": "Rugby union is a growing team sport in Spain. As of 2019, there were 37,241 registered rugby union players in Spain, playing for 332 clubs in various divisions.\nThe sport's governing body in Spain, the Spanish Rugby Federation (Spanish: Federación Española de Rugby), was founded in 1923. It joined the International Rugby Board in 1988, and is also a member of Rugby Europe.\nThere are traditionally four main rugby playing regions in Spain: the capital Madrid, the city of Valladolid in the Old Castile region, the entire regions of Basque Country, and Catalonia, particularly in the north and also around Barcelona. Rugby has been emerging recently in Valencia and Andalucia as well, with clubs like Marbella or CAU Valencia providing several players to the national team.\nThe Spanish national team plays in the Rugby Europe Championship, a competition for second tier European rugby nations such as Georgia, Romania and Russia. Spain is ranked 18th in the world, and played at the 1999 Rugby World Cup. The national sevens team is now one of the 15 \"core teams\" that participate in each event of the annual World Rugby Sevens Series, having earned that status at the 2017 Hong Kong Sevens. Both men and women rugby sevens national teams qualified for the 2016 Olympic Games.\nHistory.\nRugby was first introduced into Spain before World War I. However, subsequent events such as the Spanish Civil War hindered its development.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest recorded game in Spain was in 1901, when an Englishman, Stuart Nicholson, resident in Bilbao,\nHowever, rugby lay largely dormant in the country until after the end of World War I, when rugby was reintroduced into Spain from the south of France, particularly Provence and the French Basque Country. In 1921, Baudilio Aleu Torres, a Catalan, who had been studying veterinary medicine in Toulouse, returned to his native Barcelona, and founded the Santboiana Club there. Santboiana's pitch was cleared by the players themselves, and according to Huw Richards, \"a tree was tolerated and used as a coat hanger, until it was uprooted after a few games.\"\nThe Spanish Rugby Federation, the governing body for rugby union in Spain, was founded in 1923.\nThe first game in Madrid was in the 1920s as well, when Biarritz and Tarbes played an exhibition match in front of 12,000 spectators. The score upset some of the fans, who protested by throwing cushions onto the pitch.\nA Spanish XV played France, including Yves du Manoir, in 1927, but it was organised by a rebel governing body, and so is not usually recognised as a proper international game.\nSpain's first \"recognised\" international was in 1929, against Italy, in Barcelona, at Montjuïc Stadium, as part of the 1929 Expo. The Spanish royal family attended and all of the players were Catalan. Spain won 9–0.\nPost-war period.\nIn 1960, a French priest, Father George Bernés, introduced the game in Valladolid, Castile and León, leading to the creation of two of that region's clubs: Cetransa El Salvador and Valladolid RAC.\nSpain's international record includes wins over Italy in 1977 and Romania in 1992 and 1994.\nWith the thawing of relations between the UK and Spain over the Gibraltar question, rugby union in Gibraltar has become more closely linked with its Spanish neighbours. When the border between Spain and Gibraltar reopened, after having been closed between 1968 and 1985, a number of games were played against sides from Seville and Madrid. Campo Gibraltar RFC now play in the Andalucian second division.\nIn 1989, the Spanish women's team played their first match, against France, losing 0-28. In 2000, they joined the Women's Six Nations, but in 2007, the tournament was altered so that Italy replaced Spain, in order to mirror the men's tournament.\nPresent day.\nIn more recent times, thanks to the influx of expatriates, a fifth \"region\" has opened up along the beach resorts on the Mediterranean coast, the Canary Islands and Balearics. In these areas, however, local people rarely participate, the exception being the Marbella Rugby club on the Costa Del Sol, whose members are an equal mix of expatriates from the UK, South America and locals. The success of this policy is displayed by the progress of their junior teams, recently reaching the final of the national club championships in 2010, thus giving them the title of second best side in the country in 2010 and then going on to win the club championship in May 2011, to become the best U16 club side in Spain. The Marbella players also make up the majority of the regional Andalucian team which participate at national level. A number of juniors from this region have been selected for regional as well as national teams. The Torrevieja rugby club on the Costa Blanca also has a similar composition of players. Beach rugby has become popular in many areas, as has rugby sevens. There are several rugby sevens tournaments in the country, including the Benidorm Sevens.\nIn recent years, Estadio Anoeta in the Basque Country has also been used for occasional Heineken Cup rugby union fixtures by nearby French-Basque club Biarritz Olympique (BO). In the 2009–10 Top 14 season, both Biarritz and fellow Basque club Bayonne will take one home match to the Anoeta. On 21 August, Bayonne will host Stade Français at the Anoeta, followed on 12 September by the Northern Basque derby between Biarritz and Bayonne, with BO as the home team. The stadium, which holds 32,076, was inaugurated in 1993.\nSpain continues to be popular with touring sides from Britain, Ireland and France, due to its climate and good transport links.\nIn playing standard, Spain occupies the second tier in Europe, along with Romania and Georgia.\nPopularity.\nThere are over 51,123 registered rugby union players in Spain, with more than 221 clubs across the country. Participation rates for rugby union jumped by 20% in the Madrid area during the two years following the national team's participation in their first ever Rugby World Cup in 1999. In addition, funding from the Spanish sports council has also been on the rise. Rugby union gets low media coverage, however, compared to more popular team sports such as association football and basketball.\nThere are pockets where rugby is particularly popular, such as the city of Valladolid in the Castile and León region, Sant Boi de Llobregat in Catalonia and Ordizia in the Basque country. The rugby club Biarritz Olympique, who come from the French Basque Country have played Heineken Cup matches at the 32,000-seat Estadio Anoeta in San Sebastián, Spain and attracted sell-out crowds.\nOn 4 November 2014, France's professional rugby union league announced that the 2015–16 Top 14 final would be held at the Camp Nou in Barcelona on 24 June 2016. The Top 14 final is traditionally held at the Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. However, the scheduling of the 2015 Rugby World Cup will cause the 2015–16 French season to be shifted by several weeks, in turn causing the Stade de France to be unavailable because it will be a major venue for UEFA Euro 2016. Holding the event in Barcelona may potentially boost the sport's popularity in that area.\nOn 17 April 2016, in what is considered by many a milestone in the increasing popularity of rugby in Spain, a crowd of 26,500 attended to the Copa del Rey de Rugby final at Estadio Nuevo José Zorrilla in Valladolid. This was the 6th time that this stadium was sold out since its inauguration in 1982, including football matches. Tickets were sold out days before the match and prices rose in the Internet touting. King Felipe VI of Spain and prominent politicians like Spanish Socialist Workers' Party leader Pedro Sánchez and vice president Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría attended the match.\nNational team.\nThe Spain national rugby union team represents the whole country and have been playing international rugby since the late 1920s. Their first match was in 1929 against Italy, which Spain won 9–0.\nSpain has thus far made one Rugby World Cup appearance, in 1999. They were grouped in Pool A, alongside South Africa, Scotland and Uruguay. South Africa and Scotland defeated Spain by 40 points, and they also lost to Uruguay, though it was a closer contest.\nCompetitions.\nThe Spanish rugby union league is divided into divisions. The top teams play in the División de Honor. In each division, a team plays all other teams twice, once at home and once away. The Spanish league teams compete in a domestic cup competition each year, called the Copa del Rey. The winners of the División de Honor de Rugby (Honor Division) play the winners of the Copa del Rey in the Supercopa de España de Rugby (Super Cup). The champion of the División de Honor earns a spot in the Challenge Cup Qualifying Competition.\nVocabulary.\nFrench rugby vocabulary has been a strong influence on that of Spain. There are, however, substantial differences between South American Spanish terms and those of Spain. In South America, a combination of Spanish and English position names is used, because rugby was introduced there directly from England after these countries became independent from Spain.\nNotable players.\nThe Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem played for the under-16 and under-18 squads and briefly for the senior national team. Bardem was originally a flanker, but became a prop, and has been quoted as saying, \"being a rugby player in Spain is akin to being a bullfighter in Japan.\" \nOther notable Spanish players include -"

        "title": "Billy Bates (baseball)",
        "text": "William Derrick Bates (born December 7, 1963) is an American former professional baseball second baseman and pinch runner who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers and the Cincinnati Reds. In 29 career games, Bates had a batting average of .125 with six hits, two runs batted in (RBI), 11 runs, and eight stolen bases. Though his defensive position was at second base, the Reds primarily used Bates as a pinch runner. After he scored the winning run in Game 2 of the 1990 World Series, Bates never played in MLB again.\nBorn in Houston, Bates attended the University of Texas and, in his freshman season, won the 1983 College World Series as a part of the Texas Longhorns baseball team. For the next two seasons, Bates was named to the College Baseball All-America Team, a team composed of the best collegiate baseball athletes in America. Drafted by Milwaukee in the fourth round of the 1985 MLB draft, he rose through the Brewers' farm system helping several of his minor league teams win their respective league titles. He made his MLB debut in 1989, after Milwaukee's starting second baseman Jim Gantner was injured. A trade in 1990 sent Bates to Cincinnati, where the Reds used him primarily as a pinch runner at the end of the regular season and into the postseason. Facing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series, Bates reached base on a pinch hit single against Dennis Eckersley and later scored the winning run in Game 2 as the Reds swept the Athletics four games to none. Following the World Series championship, the Reds re-signed Bates on a one-year contract, and he played for their Triple-A team. He spent the next year with the Chicago Cubs Triple-A affiliate, and last played exhibition baseball in 1995. After retiring, he worked as an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry in Houston.\nEarly life.\nWilliam Derrick Bates was born on December 7, 1963, in Houston, Texas. The son of a paint foreman, he was the youngest of seven siblings. He attended Aldine High School, where he played baseball as an infielder and pitcher, basketball as a guard, and American football as a running back. In his junior year, the Aldine Mustangs defeated the Dickinson High School Gators 34–7 to win the Region III football championship; in the game, Bates recorded 93 yards on 14 carries. In baseball, the Texas High School Coaches Association named Bates as an All-Star to their South Team in June 1982. According to Bates, as a senior, Sam Houston State University and \"several smaller schools\" recruited him for baseball. After his senior season, a scout for the Houston Astros stated Bates would never play major college baseball, and suggested he attend a junior college. When the Philadelphia Phillies selected him in the eighth round of the 1982 MLB draft, Bates became the second player ever to be drafted out of Aldine. Instead of signing a professional contract with the Phillies, who offered Bates $38,000 or $38,500 to sign with the team (equivalent to $102,000 or $103,000 in 2020), Bates chose to attend the University of Texas at Austin.\nCollegiate career.\nBates enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin, and started at second base in his first year. The 1983 Longhorns finished the regular season with a 61–14 win–loss record and were ranked as the number one team in the nation by \"Collegiate Baseball Magazine\". Though the College World Series (CWS) followed a double-elimination format, the Longhorns, who defeated the Mississippi State Bulldogs to represent the Central Regional in the CWS, remained undefeated and beat the Alabama Crimson Tide 4–3 to win the championship. After the series, Bates was named to the World Series All-Tournament team, composed of the best players from the series, and writers for \"Baseball America\" (\"BA\") named him to their honorary first-team Freshman All-America team. He finished the season with a .296 batting average for the Longhorns.\nDuring his sophomore season, Bates was named an American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) first-team All-American; with the accomplishment, Bates became the second Longhorn second baseman ever to make an All-American team, and the first since Pat Rigby in 1962. Texas finished with a 60–14 record and lost 3–1 to the Cal State Fullerton Titans in the final game of the 1984 CWS. Bates recorded 36 steals over the regular season and batted .272. His 62 walks and 74 games played both led the Longhorns. In 1985, Bates was a co-captain of the Texas team with David Denny, and was named a \"BA\" and an ABCA All-American with a .361 batting average as Texas finished at a 64–14 mark. In a June 1 CWS game against the Arizona Wildcats, Bates switched from hitting left to hitting right-handed in the middle of the game, and walked in the 7th inning and scored the game-tying run, and, in the 8th inning, hit a double that scored the go-ahead run. On June 5, in a game against the Miami Hurricanes, Bates hit two home runs, one from the right-hand side and one an inside-the-park home run from the left-hand side, as the Longhorns won 8–4; his two home runs tied a record for most home runs in a single CWS game. In a game against the Arkansas Razorbacks on June 8, Bates hit a triple in the bottom of the tenth inning and scored the winning run on a Doug Hodo single as the Longhorns defeated the Razorbacks 8–7. In the CWS finals, Texas lost twice against the Hurricanes, who advanced to the series from the loser's bracket, and lost the series. Over his career with the Longhorns, Bates batted .312 with a fielding percentage of .969.\nTexas head coach Cliff Gustafson called Bates the best second baseman who played under him up to and including 1985. In 1996, a panel of sixty coaches, Division I Baseball Committee chairs, and media who covered the CWS named Bates to their all-decade team for the 1980s. , Bates held the Texas Longhorns record for most career triples, with 20, most triples in a single season, with 13, and most runs scored in a single season, with 100. On June 3, the Milwaukee Brewers drafted Bates in the 4th round of the 1985 MLB draft. An anonymous scout outside the Brewers organization called Bates \"confusing\", and said \"if you just put the stats on, and forget he's , , he's done remarkable things. But we go on percentages.\"\nProfessional career.\nRise to the majors.\nBates began playing professionally for the Class A-Advanced Stockton Ports, a Brewers farm team which competed in the California League (CL). Though the Ports had seven future MLB pitchers on their roster, the team only had two future MLB position players: Bates and LaVel Freeman, who played in two games for the Brewers in 1989. Under manager Tom Gamboa, the Ports finished with an 82–63 record and reached the CL playoffs, which consisted of four teams playing in two best-of-five game series; the two winners advanced to play for the League championship. In the first series, the Ports defeated the Modesto A's, three games to one. In the championship, Stockton faced the Fresno Giants; with a 2–1 series lead, Stockton lost the final two games, and the Giants won the California League title. Bates batted .298, tied for fourth-best on the team, with 18 stolen bases in 59 games played.\nIn 1986, the Brewers promoted Bates to the Double-A El Paso Diablos. Bates' eight home runs and 75 runs batted in (RBI) became the highest of his career at any professional level. The Diablos finished the regular season with an 85–50 record as Bates led the club with 23 stolen bases but was caught stealing 10 times, also a team high. In the playoffs, the Diablos defeated the Jackson Mets four games to none to win the Texas League championship. Bates set a league record with three stolen bases in a single postseason game.\nBefore the 1987 season, Bates attempted to make the Brewers' Opening Day roster by playing in Milwaukee's spring training camp. A writer for the \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\" noted there was \"a lot of recent publicity\" around Bates, and another \"Journal Sentinel\" reporter said he \"impressed many with his play\". The Brewers sent Bates to their minor league camp in Peoria, Arizona, in March. He spent the entire season playing in Triple-A for the Denver Zephyrs of the American Association (AA) and played in 130 games, the second most on the Zephyrs to Brad Komminsk's 135. In a May 30 game against the Indianapolis Indians, Bates hit the game-winning single in the bottom of the 9th inning. He was named the AA's All-Star second baseman, and finished the season batting .316 with 51 stolen bases, second most in the AA to Gary Thurman of the Omaha Royals, who stole 58. His 117 runs scored also led a Denver club that won its final 11 games to finish 79–61, one game ahead of the Louisville Redbirds for the best record in the AA. In the league championship series, Denver lost to the Indians four games to one.\nBefore the 1988 season, a prediction in the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" stated that Bates might make the Brewers if Paul Molitor ended up as a third baseman or a designated hitter. In a Brewers' spring training game in early March, Bates committed two errors against the Chicago Cubs in the 11th inning, as the Cubs scored the winning run without recording a hit, but his 4th or 5th-inning single scored two runs. Bates was again cut from the MLB roster before the start of the 1988 season, as Milwaukee manager Tom Trebelhorn named Molitor as the Brewers' starting second baseman. Now in Triple-A, Bates had a five-RBI game against the Iowa Cubs on April 12 in a Zephyrs victory. In a June game against the Toledo Mud Hens, Bates hit a single and a double, with two walks and two runs scored, in a 5–1 Zephyrs win. Hindered throughout the season by a leg injury, Bates hit .258 with 29 stolen bases, a loss of 22 from a season ago, as the Zephyrs finished 72–62.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nAfter the 1988 season, the Brewers invited Bates to their spring training camp as a non-roster invitee as the 1989 season approached. Bates competed for a utility infielder position along with Gus Polidor, Edgar Díaz, and Juan Castillo, though Bates stated that he had played at shortstop and third base the previous year and Trebelhorn said he could contribute more in Triple-A. When 12-year Brewer second baseman Jim Gantner re-signed with the club, Bates was demoted to Denver, and the \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\" predicted that he would remain there due to his limited defensive versatility. Bates began the season with the Zephyrs and in July was named to the Triple-A All-Star Game. In a game against the New York Yankees on August 15, Gantner tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee and was placed on the disabled list. Bates was called up as his replacement, though Milwaukee's general manager Harry Dalton stated he would aim to acquire a second baseman with MLB experience for the spot.\nDalton said that Bates was expected to join Milwaukee by the start of the game on August 16, adding \"he won't be in the starting lineup, but he could play if necessary\". Bates made his MLB debut on August 17 as a part of a double switch against the Boston Red Sox: when Dan Plesac replaced Tony Fossas as the pitcher, Bates entered the game for Polidor. Wade Boggs hit a ground ball to Bates, but Bates committed an error that allowed Boggs to reach base and Dwight Evans to advance to third base. No runs were scored in the inning and the Brewers won 8–4. Bates made his first career start two days later, and his first MLB hit came on August 20 when he reached base on an infield single. After his hit, Bates stole second base, and scored on a single by Robin Yount. While he was running out a base hit on August 22, Bates slipped on wet grass and suffered a separated right shoulder. The Brewers placed him on the 15-day disabled list; as a replacement, Milwaukee acquired Ed Romero from the Atlanta Braves. Bates returned to the team for three more games in September before the end of the season. Over seven MLB games, he batted .214 with three hits, three runs, and two steals; in Triple-A, Bates batted .273 with a slugging percentage of .322.\nIn late March, Bates was listed as the starting second baseman on Milwaukee's depth chart for the 1990 MLB season, although Dale Sveum was competing for the spot as well. Bates started at second on Opening Day against the Chicago White Sox, and despite a 2–1 Brewers' loss, Bates' play was complimented by \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\" writer Michael Bauman. Facing the Red Sox on April 14, Bates hit his only MLB extra base hit, a double, in the eighth inning, but committed two errors on defense. He later scored the go-ahead run on a Gary Sheffield double in a 9–5 Milwaukee victory. His second and final MLB RBI occurred on April 18: Rob Deer scored on his single, after Bates entered the game in the 6th inning to replace Sveum, who had been hit by a pitch an inning earlier. By April 27 Bates was hitting .103 over 29 at bats, as Molitor came off the DL and was expected to take over at second: Seth Livingstone of \"The Telegraph\" called the switch \"merciful\". Four days later, Bates was demoted to Denver, where he was the team's all-time leader in steals.\nAfter batting .327 in 25 games with the Zephyrs, he was acquired along with Glenn Braggs by the Cincinnati Reds for Ron Robinson and Bob Sebra on June 9, 1990. Reds general manager Bob Quinn said he made the trade because, though \"we felt comfortable with our pitching staff, we didn't feel comfortable with the right-handed hitters off the bench\". Bates later stated he repeatedly asked the Brewers to trade him.\nCincinnati Reds.\nWhen he arrived with the Reds organization, Bates was assigned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds of the AA. In a play-in game to determine the leader of the AA Eastern division, and thus the team that qualified for the playoffs, the Sounds defeated the Buffalo Bisons when Chris Jones hit a double that scored Bates in the eighteenth inning. The Sounds lost the ensuing series against the Western-champion Omaha Royals three games to two; Bates' season was not over, as the Reds added him to their MLB roster. For the Sounds, Bates batted .280 with 12 stolen bases and no home runs over 73 games played. In his Cincinnati debut on September 11, Bates came into the game as a pinch runner and scored on a Billy Doran hit. Doran, a second baseman, was hospitalized with back pain and spasms on September 29. Doctors performed an operation on October 3, which would hold him out of postseason play as Cincinnati won the National League (NL) West. In a move that surprised Bates, who had prepared to return to his Houston residence after the Reds' last regular-season game, the club added him to their postseason roster. He finished the regular season with eight appearances for the Reds, the majority of which came as a pinch runner.\nIn the 1990 NL Championship Series, the Reds faced the Pittsburgh Pirates in a best-of-seven game series. In Game 1, with the Reds down 4–3 in the bottom of the ninth inning, manager Lou Piniella put Bates in the game as a pinch runner for Ron Oester on first base. Eric Davis, at second, tried to steal third, and Bates followed to second; while Davis was safe, Pirates catcher Mike LaValliere threw Bates out by three feet. The Reds failed to score that inning and lost the game. Bates' next postseason appearance came in Game 3, when he pinch ran for Joe Oliver and scored a run as the Reds won 6–3. Cincinnati ultimately defeated the Pirates and moved on to the World Series, where they would play the Oakland Athletics for the league championship.\nIn Game 1, the Reds defeated the Athletics 7–0. Bates did not play. In Game 2, after nine innings, the game remained tied, 4–4. Dennis Eckersley pitched for the Athletics for the bottom of the tenth, when Bates entered the game to pinch hit. Hitting coach Tony Pérez told him to \"put the ball in play\" and \"run like Hell\". Eckersley pitched Bates to an 0–2 ball–strike count when he hit the ball weakly to the third baseman and beat out an infield single; it was Bates' first hit against a right-handed pitcher in his MLB career. Chris Sabo advanced Bates to second on a single, and Oliver scored Bates on another single to win the game. Bates called the situation a \"dream come true\". The Reds defeated the Athletics four games to none and became World Series champions. Bates did not play in either of the last two games. As with all players on the World Series champion Reds, Bates received a World Series ring and visited the White House.\nLater career.\nIn January, Bates signed a one-year contract to stay with the Reds. In spring training, Cincinnati sent Bates to their minor league complex for reassignment to a team in the Reds' farm system. He started the season in Triple-A. Doran, still with a back injury, went on the DL in May, but Bates was not able to take his spot due to a back injury of his own. He played the entire 1991 season for the Sounds, where he batted .242 over 49 games with one stolen base out of three attempts, as the team finished with a 65–78 record. The Reds did not re-sign him. On May 7, 1992, Bates signed a contract with the Chicago Cubs and played for the Iowa Cubs, Chicago's Triple-A affiliate. Over 91 games played, he hit .241 with 62 hits and two stolen bases as Iowa finished 51–92. From 1992 to 1994, he worked for his father-in-law in a Houston pipe fabrication business. In February 1995, the Brewers invited Bates to their spring training camp as a possible replacement player due to the 1994–1995 MLB strike. When the strike ended, Bates returned to his wife and children in Houston instead of continuing his career elsewhere, citing physical reasons for his retirement. While playing in MLB, Bates stood at and weighed . He batted left-handed, and threw right-handed. In 29 career games, Bates had a batting average of .125 with six hits, two runs batted in (RBI), 11 runs, and eight stolen bases.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1984, Bates was on the preliminary roster for baseball at the Olympic games, but did not make its final roster. He was a physical education major at the University of Texas in 1985. His teammates taunted him about his height: in Bates' first Milwaukee spring training camp, players threw a cap on the ground and addressed it as if it were Bates. During the MLB off-season, he worked as a substitute school teacher in Houston. Before the 1990 World Series, Bates raced against an unchained cheetah in a promotional event for the Cincinnati Zoo at Riverfront Stadium. The premise of the event was to show that a cheetah could defeat a human (with a five-second head start) in a race. The cheetah was supposed to chase a toy, but about halfway through the race, Bates' hat fell off, and instead, it went after the hat; Bates won the race. In 1991, Bates participated in the University of Texas' Varsity–Alumni game, a game between varsity baseball players and alumni players. In 2000, the University of Texas inducted him into their Men's Athletics Hall of Honor. , Bates lived in Houston and worked for an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry."

He represented as a Wallaby in 6 Tests in 1961 and as a Kangaroo in 8 Tests from 1962.\nEarly life.\nCleary was born in Dover Heights, New South Wales and was educated at Waverley College. In 1943 having initially lived in Hardy street, his family moved to 17 Rodney Street, Dover Heights, where his father had built a new family home. At age 17, having set a number of schoolboy sprint records, he was offered a sporting scholarship to Stanford University, which he declined, with his sights set on representing Australia in athletics.\nRugby union.\nIn 1959 he joined the Randwick DRUFC and played in the club's 1960 winning first-grade premiership side. He was selected in the Australian national side for all three Tests of the 1961 series against Fiji and made further Wallaby appearances against France, and against the Springboks on the 1961 tour of South Africa.\nAthletics.\nAfter leaving rugby union, during his first year of rugby league with the South Sydney Rabbitohs, Cleary maintained his amateur status to enable his selection for the Commonwealth Games later that year. He represented Australia in athletics at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, placing third in the 100-yard sprint. He recorded 9.3 secs for the 100 yards during his athletic career.\nIn 1964 he beat the rugby league speedster Ken Irvine in a A£2,000 match race at Wentworth Park, and in 1966 he won the Australian professional 130m sprint race.\nRugby league.\nCleary joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1962 along with Jim Lisle his Wallaby three-quarter partner. Cleary was a Winger with the club throughout the 1960s playing in three premiership winning sides in\n1967, 1968 and 1970. Cleary finished his first grade career with the Rabbitoh's neighbouring club, the Eastern Suburbs Roosters, in 1971. This made him ideally suited to represent his future NSW State electoral district of Coogee, which sits close to the geographic border between the two clubs.\nHis international rugby league debut in the 1st Test against Great Britain in Sydney on 9 June 1962 saw Cleary become Australia's 29th dual-code international, following Arthur Summons and preceding Jim Lisle. He made Test appearances against New Zealand in 1963, 1965 and 1969; against France in 1964 and was selected for the 1963–64 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France during which he made one Test and twenty tour match appearances.\nTriple international.\nHe is one of only four Australian sportsmen to represent internationally in three different sports at the senior level (see also Dick Thornett and Snowy Baker).\nPolitics and community.\nCleary joined the Labor Party in 1965 and was the State member for Coogee in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1974 to 1991 and was the NSW Minister for Sport and Recreation and Tourism in the Wran Labor Government from 1981 to 1988. From 1986 to 1988 he was also the NSW Minister for Racing.\nHe was at one time or another the Chairman Sports House Advisory Committee, member North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club, member Coogee Surf Life Saving Club and a director South Sydney Leagues Club.\nIn the Queen's Birthday Honours list of 1992, Cleary was awarded an Officer of the Order of Australia for his service to the New South Wales Parliament, and in 2000 he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his achievements as a Kangaroo player. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1999.\nCleary was a wrestling commentator for World Championship Wrestling."

        "text": "The Opening Ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games was held on 15 March 2006 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The ceremony was conceived and produced by Jack Morton Worldwide\nDescription.\nCountdown.\nA 1930 Hamilton-1934 London-1938 Sydney-1950 Auckland-1954 Vancouver-1958 Cardiff-1962 Perth-1966 Kingston-1970 Edinburgh-1974 Christchurch-1978 Edmonton-1982 Brisbane-1986 Edinburgh-1990 Auckland-1994 Victoria-1998 Kuala Lumpur-2002 Manchester-2006 Melbourne countdown projection on the floor of the stage with song \"Salute\" is a song recorded by British girl group Little Mix for their second studio album of the same name was set to the melody of \"Countdown\" was instrumental by Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and label by Sony BMG Music Entertainment Australia as temporary stage on the playing ground of the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia lighting up with previous host cities.\nWelcome.\nAfter countdown and ceremony began with the flag of Australia (current host), England (previous host) and India (next host) were raised. Surf boats which represented each of the past 18 host cities were on the Yarra River as were flags of the participating countries. A W-class Melbourne tram with wings attached was lowered into the stadium. A performance followed based on a poem by Michael Leunig, involving a boy with a duck which was an artificial one at first, and koalas, (people dressed in koala 'suits'). At the end of the display, the boy came into the Stadium with a real white duck. The opening ceremony had many themes, including Melbourne's Wurundjeri Indigenous heritage and Melbourne's fickle weather. The role of the boy was performed by 12-year-old (almost 13) Sean Whitford, who had been selected from thousands of candidates. Australian rock band The Church played \"Under The Milky Way\" to accompany a performance by the Australian Ballet, with aerial work performed by students of the National Institute of Circus Arts (NICA).\nParade of nations.\nContrary to tradition, the nations did not enter the stadium in alphabetical order, but by regions of the Commonwealth. European nations entered the stadium first, followed by those from Africa, Asia, the Americas, the Caribbean and finally, Oceania. English athletes and officials entered the stadium first (as the host of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester) while the host nation, Australia entered last. The athletes entered with The Cat Empire playing a specially written musical 'set', tailoring music to specific regions.\nQueen's baton.\nThe final leg of the Queen's Baton Relay included the baton being handed to the 16 captains of the Australian Football League across the floating flags and fish along the Yarra River. After each of the captains had carried the baton, the last of the captains handed the baton to Ron Barassi, who walked on a semi submerged pontoon, giving the effect that he was walking on water (some commentators joked that the stunt \"proved what most of us suspected\"). Barassi then handed the baton to Herb Elliott.\nCGF flag hoist.\nThe Commonwealth Games Federation flag was then brought into the stadium by eight Young Australian of the Year recipients. The athlete's oath was taken by Adam Pine.\nQueen's birthday celebration.\nHarry White, a 13-year-old boy, who was youth ambassador, presented a message to Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. After a rather controversial furore before the start of the Games regarding the decision by the Organising Committee not to include \"God Save the Queen\" in the Opening Ceremony, a \"Happy Birthday\" medley was sung by Dame Kiri Te Kanawa in tribute of the Queen's 80th birthday (37 days hence), ending with eight bars from \"God Save the Queen\". Michael Fennel, the president of the Commonwealth Games Federation then spoke.\nQueen's baton handover.\nThe final bearers of the Queen's Baton were all former elite world-class athletes who had successfully competed at both the Olympic Games and Commonwealth Games. They were:\nOpening of the games.\nThe Queen then read the message of greeting which she had placed in the baton (366 days earlier on Commonwealth Day, 14 March 2005), declaring the games open.\nIn the end.\nAustralian singer Delta Goodrem sang \"Together We Are One\", the theme song for the 2006 games while many fireworks were ignited, within the stadium, on the backs on roller-bladers circling the singer, and fireworks were also ignited on the banks of the Yarra, as well as the floating pontoons, and Melbourne's larger skyscrapers.\nCeremony key team.\nThe ceremonies were produced by Jack Morton, Artistic Director and Executive Producer Andrew Walsh with Producers David Proctor (Opening Ceremony), Adam Charles (Closing Ceremony) and Keith Tucker (River).\nParade of Nations.\nIn a break of tradition the teams entered the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the opening ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games by regions, instead of by alphabetical order.\nLast host nation\n England - 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.\nEurope.\n Cyprus | Gibraltar | Guernsey | Isle of Man | Jersey | Malta | Northern Ireland | Scotland | Wales\nThen followed the African countries.\n Botswana | Cameroon | The Gambia | Ghana | Kenya | Lesotho | Malaŵi | Mauritius | Mozambique | Namibia | Nigeria | Seychelles | Sierra Leone | South Africa | Swaziland | Uganda | United Republic of Tanzania | Zambia\nAsia.\n Bangladesh | Brunei Darussalam | India | Malaysia | Maldives | Pakistan | Singapore | Sri Lanka\nAmerica.\n Belize | Bermuda | Canada | Falkland Islands | Guyana | St Helena\nCaribbean.\n Anguilla | Antigua and Barbuda | Bahamas | Barbados | British Virgin Islands | Cayman Islands | Dominica | Grenada | Jamaica | Montserrat | St Kitts &amp; Nevis | Saint Lucia | St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines | Trinidad &amp; Tobago | Turks &amp; Caicos\nOceania.\n Cook Islands | Fiji | Kiribati | Nauru | New Zealand | Niue Island | Norfolk Island | Papua New Guinea | Samoa | Solomon Islands | Tonga | Tuvalu | Vanuatu\nHost nation.\n Australia\nBroadcast.\nThe opening ceremony was broadcast in Australia on the Nine Network. It was one of the highest rating programs of 2006 with 3,561,000 viewers across the five metro areas.\nThe BBC showed coverage in the UK."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2007)",
        "text": "The 2007 Royal Rumble was the 20th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on January 28, 2007, at the AT&amp;T Center in San Antonio, Texas, and was the second Royal Rumble held in San Antonio after the 1997 event. This marked the first time that the ECW brand participated at the Royal Rumble, which became WWE's third brand in mid-2006. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2007 event, the winner received their choice to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship, SmackDown!'s World Heavyweight Championship, or the ECW World Championship at WrestleMania 23, marking the first time that three titles were an option.\nFive professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The main event was the 2007 Royal Rumble match, which featured wrestlers from all three brands. SmackDown!'s The Undertaker, the 30th entrant, won the match by last eliminating Raw's Shawn Michaels, the 23rd entrant. The primary match on the Raw brand was a Last Man Standing match for the WWE Championship between John Cena and Umaga. Cena won the match and retained the title after Umaga was unable to get to his feet before the referee counted to ten. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was Batista versus Mr. Kennedy for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Batista won by pinfall after executing a Batista Bomb. The featured match on the ECW brand was between Bobby Lashley and Test for the ECW World Championship, which Lashley won after Test was counted out.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2007 event was the 20th Royal Rumble and was scheduled to be held on January 28, 2007, at the AT&amp;T Center in San Antonio, Texas, and was the second Royal Rumble held in San Antonio after the 1997 event. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brands, which was the first Royal Rumble to include ECW, a relaunch of the former Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion that became WWE's third brand in May 2006.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2007, the winner could choose to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship, SmackDown!'s World Heavyweight Championship, or the ECW World Championship at WrestleMania 23. This marked the first time that the ECW World Championship was a choice for the winner of the match, subsequently marking the first time that the winner had a choice between three world championships.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised six matches, as well as one dark match, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", and \"ECW\".\nThe main feud heading into the Royal Rumble on Raw was between WWE Champion John Cena and Umaga. At the previous pay-per-view event, New Year's Revolution, Cena defeated Umaga to end his undefeated streak and retain the WWE Championship. The night after on \"Raw\", Armando Alejandro Estrada, Umaga's manager, asked for a rematch, which Cena agreed to. Later that night, during a match between Cena and The Great Khali, Umaga interfered and attacked Cena. The following week, the official contract signing for their rematch at the Royal Rumble took place. After it was announced that Estrada could choose the match type, Estrada chose the match to be a Last Man Standing match. Cena signed the contract and proceeded to attack both Umaga and Estrada. On the January 22 episode of \"Raw\", after Cena was eliminated from a Battle Royal, Umaga attacked Cena, and injured his spleen, which was portrayed as real as part of their storyline.\nThe predominant feud on the SmackDown! brand was between Batista and Mr. Kennedy, with the two battling over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the January 5 episode of \"SmackDown!\" a Beat the Clock Sprint began. Wrestlers competed in single matches, and the wrestler to win a match in the shortest amount of time would then become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at the Royal Rumble. Mr. Kennedy, who defeated Chris Benoit in nearly five minutes, had the shortest time at the end of the show. The following week, the Sprint continued. In the final match, between The Undertaker and The Miz, Kennedy interfered by pulling The Miz out of the ring. After performing the Tombstone piledriver on The Miz, The Undertaker went for the pin attempt. Time, however, ran out and Kennedy became the winner of the Sprint. The following week after on \"SmackDown!\", The Undertaker was put in a match with Kennedy, where if he won, he would be added to the title match at the Royal Rumble. During the match, after Kennedy attacked Batista, who was at ringside. Batista retaliated against Kennedy, causing The Undertaker to get disqualified. Thus, the match at the Royal Rumble remained a singles match between Batista and Kennedy.\nThe main feud on the ECW brand was between Bobby Lashley and Test, with the two feuding over the ECW Championship. Rob Van Dam won an online poll against Test and Sabu to earn a title shot on the January 2 episode of \"ECW\", which ended in no-contest. Van Dam was given another title match the next week. Test interfered in the match, and attacked both men. A Triple Threat match for the title occurred on the January 16 episode of \"ECW\" between Lashley, Van Dam, and Test. Lashley won, but was beaten down afterwards by Test. A title match between Lashley and Test was then made for the Royal Rumble. A week after that match was made, on the January 23 episode of \"ECW\", Lashley defeated Test in another title match.\nEvent.\nBefore the event went live on pay-per-view, JTG defeated Lance Cade in a dark match.\nPreliminary match.\nThe first match that aired was a tag team match between The Hardys (Matt and Jeff Hardy) and MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro). The match went back and forth until MNM took control by attacking Matt's injured jaw repeatedly. The Hardys gained the advantage briefly, but lost it when Nitro countered an aerial attack by Jeff. Jeff finally tagged Matt, who beat down both Mercury and Nitro. The finish came when Matt delivered a Twist of Fate and Jeff performed the Swanton Bomb on Nitro. Jeff then pinned Nitro for the victory.\nMain matches.\nThe second match was Bobby Lashley against Test for the ECW World Championship. Test used many illegal moves, and took control after driving Lashley's shoulder into the ringpost. He continued to attack the shoulder until Lashley fought back with several powerful moves. Test rolled out of the ring, allowing himself to be counted out. Lashley won, and retained his title. He came after Test, however, brought him back into the ring, and continued to beat him down.\nThe third match was between World Heavyweight Champion Batista and Mr. Kennedy for the World Heavyweight Championship. Batista gained an early advantage by overpowering Kennedy until Kennedy injured Batista's knee by using the steel steps. Kennedy continued to attack Batista's knees, and applied various submission holds that target the knee. Batista fought back, still favoring the knee, until Kennedy pushed Batista into the referee and hit a low blow. Kennedy had Batista pinned for over a three-count, but the match went on due to the referee being knocked out. Kennedy brought the referee conscious but Batista performed a lariat and a Batista Bomb to retain the title.\nIn the fourth match, Umaga faced John Cena for the WWE Championship in the Last Man Standing match. Umaga dominated Cena, gaining the advantage by using powerful moves, and attacking Cena's bandaged ribs. Cena tried to fight back using the steel steps, but Umaga quickly recovered, and continued the beat down. Cena managed to hit a low blow and delivered a bulldog onto the steel steps, a spin-out powerbomb onto the steel steps, and the Five Knuckle Shuffle all onto Umaga. Umaga regained control when Cena attempted an FU onto the steps, and collapsed, hitting his head on the steps. Cena avoided a running headbutt drop, and hit Umaga in the head with a television monitor. Umaga stood but missed a running splash through a broadcast table. Umaga got up again as his manager, Armando Alejandro Estrada, detached one of the turnbuckles for Umaga to use. Cena avoided the attack, executed an FU, and applied the STF on Umaga using the loose ring rope. Umaga failed to answer the referee's count of ten, and Cena retained the title.\nMain event match.\nThe final match was the Royal Rumble match. Kane, the tenth entrant, dominated the match upon entering, eliminating Tommy Dreamer and Sabu, by chokeslamming Sabu through a table Sabu had earlier set up. The Sandman, entering fifteen, used his signature Singapore Cane in the match before King Booker quickly eliminated him. Randy Orton and Edge worked together to eliminate the Hardys. After Booker was eliminated by Kane, he returned to the ring, eliminated Kane, and continued to beat him down. It took the combined effort of nine men to eliminate Viscera after Shawn Michaels performed a superkick on Viscera. The Great Khali, entering twenty-eighth, dominated upon entering the match, eliminating seven men quickly. The Great Khali tried to pose in front of the camera, but botched it by posing the wrong way. Shawn Michaels had to tell Khali which way to pose. The Undertaker entered last, who immediately fought with, and eliminated Khali, then Montel Vontavious Porter, leaving Edge, Orton, Michaels, and Undertaker as the final four. Orton executed an RKO on Michaels, causing him to roll out of the ring under the ropes and leaving Edge, Orton, and the Undertaker. Orton caught Edge trying to attack him, but the two soon reconciled, working together on The Undertaker. Michaels, outside the ring, came back in, eliminating both Orton and Edge. The remaining two exchanged attacks until the end, when The Undertaker chokeslammed Michaels, who retaliated with Sweet Chin Music. Michaels attempted another Sweet Chin Music but Undertaker avoided it, then eliminated Michaels to win the match. The Undertaker became the first competitor to win the Rumble match from #30 (what is considered to be the \"easiest\" spot to win from, despite no one having done so in any previous match).\nReception.\nThe AT&amp;T Center has hosted many different events that have a variety of seating maximums. A basketball event, which has a smaller set-up than a wrestling event, can hold a maximum of 18,797 fans. Due to the Royal Rumble's production, the maximum standard was lowered and the event drew 13,500 fans and received 491,000 pay-per-view buys. WWE made $15.8 million from pay-per-view revenues in their first quarter (which included the Royal Rumble, No Way Out, and WrestleMania) versus $17.1 million in 2006 for the same events, a $1.3 million difference. The 2006 Royal Rumble also resulted in 548,000 pay-per-view buys, 57,000 more than the 2007 Royal Rumble. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling sub website, Slam! Wrestling, rated the entire event 7.5 out of 10 points, due to the event not lasting its entire three hours and many mishaps that occurred during the Royal Rumble match, which they also rated a 7.5. The last man standing match between John Cena and Umaga was widely praised. The Royal Rumble 2007 was released on DVD on February 27, 2007 and was distributed by WWE. The DVD debuted on \"Billboard\"'s Top DVD sales chart at #3 on March 24, 2007. The DVD remained on the chart for 13 consecutive weeks until June 16, 2007 when its final rank was at #10.\nAftermath.\nThe shows following the Royal Rumble surrounded The Undertaker's choice of which champion to face at WrestleMania 23. The Undertaker appeared on all three brands, and stared down the champions. Finally, on the February 5 episode of \"Raw\", The Undertaker chose to face Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship, and hit him with a chokeslam, starting their rivalry. The Undertaker won the title at WrestleMania, improving his WrestleMania record to 15-0, and their feud continued until the May 11 episode of \"SmackDown!\", when The Undertaker lost the title to Edge, who cashed in the Money in the Bank, that he won from Mr. Kennedy, earlier that week on \"Raw\".\nAfter The Undertaker made his choice on February 5, Shawn Michaels, Edge, and Randy Orton all wanted to face Cena for his title at WrestleMania. A Triple Threat match was made between the three for the title shot, which Michaels won after pinning Orton. Cena successfully retained his title against Michaels at WrestleMania. They continued to feud over the title with the addition of Orton and Edge, but Cena remained champion. Soon after the Royal Rumble, Umaga and Bobby Lashley joined the feud between Mr. McMahon and Donald Trump in the \"Battle of the Billionaires\" as their representatives respectively for the Hair vs. Hair match at WrestleMania.\nHis Royal Rumble match marked the start of Mr. Kennedy's push to main-event status. He went on to face Bobby Lashley for the ECW World Championship at No Way Out, which he won via disqualification, thus failing to win the title. Kennedy won the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania, which gave him a world title shot at any time of his choosing for the year following. Kennedy sustained an injury at a house show, however, that would leave him sidelined for five to seven months, and was booked to lose his title shot to Edge on the May 7 episode of \"Raw\". Later results showed the injury to be much less severe, but Kennedy had already lost his title shot. He returned to mid-card status for the remainder of the year.\nThis was the last Royal Rumble ever to be in 4:3 format until January 2008 when it went to high definition."

        "title": "Minor ice hockey",
        "text": "Minor hockey is an umbrella term for amateur ice hockey which is played below the junior age level. Players are classified by age, with each age group playing in its own league. The rules, especially as it relates to body contact, vary from class to class. In North America, the rules are governed by the national bodies, Hockey Canada and USA Hockey, while local hockey associations administer players and leagues for their region. Many provinces and states organize regional and provincial championship tournaments, and the highest age groups in Canada and USA also participate in national championships.\nMinor hockey is not to be confused with minor league professional hockey.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, the age categories are designated by each provincial hockey governing body based on Hockey Canada's guidelines, and each category may have multiple tiers based on skill.\nIn November 2019, Hockey Canada announced that beginning in 2020 (officially taking effect in the 2020–21 season), it would refer to its age categories by their age limits (with \"midget\" being renamed \"U18\", for example) rather than by names. It stated that the new names would be more concise, while there had also been concerns over use of the term \"midget\" in this context—as the word is now considered a pejorative towards dwarfism.\nAge categories.\nTo qualify in a category, the player must be under the age limit as of December 31 of the current season.\nFinland.\nIn Finland, the Finnish Ice Hockey Association roughly categorizes minor hockey players to \"under school-ages\" and \"school-ages\". Children over 16 are considered as \"juniors\", although the youngest juniors are still at the school-age.\nStarting of season 2020-21 names of the minor and junior levels has been changed to represent the standards used in international competitions and other minor hockey leagues. New minor and junior hockey levels, reference to old level in parentheses:.\nFrance.\nIn France, hockey teams use the following levels:\nGermany.\nIn Germany, German Ice Hockey Federation designates the following levels:\nSweden.\nThe Swedish Ice Hockey Federation designates the following levels:\nSome levels (especially J18 and J20) are directly administered by the Swedish Ice Hockey Federation, while lower divisions of the Juniors and below are administered by the respective sub-federation in each landskap.\nSwitzerland.\nThe Swiss Ice Hockey Federation designates the following levels : using terms from the national languages of Switzerland. This has nevertheless evolve recently to U9, U11 so this has to be updated.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, USA Hockey designates the following levels:\nGirls hockey operates under their own age classifications, namely 10U, 12U, 14U, 16U and 19U.\nMany organizations and leagues that have larger numbers of registered players tend to delineate within the two-year window allowed for each age group. In these situations, teams composed entirely or primarily of players in their second year of eligibility are designated 'major' teams, while those with players in their 1st year of eligibility are designated \"minor\" teams. (For example, ten-year-olds would be \"squirt majors\" while nine-year-olds would be \"squirt minors\".) This is especially true in \"AAA\".\nSome leagues separate players six years old and younger into their own group, often referred to using names like \"Mini-Mites\", \"Mosquitoes\", or \"Microns.\"\nUSA Hockey designates four skill levels:\nAAU.\nThe Amateur Athletic Union has returned to licensing the sport of ice hockey.\nAAU began licensing scholastic ice hockey programs at the HS Varsity and JV classifications about 2009. Then during the 2011–2012 season the AAU began licensing junior and youth leagues as well. The Western States Hockey League (WSHL) moved their operations from USA Hockey into AAU and Hockey Michigan was formed, providing traditional full-ice playing opportunities at the 7U and 8U age classifications (aka mites) in the face of cross-ice mandates adopted by the USA Hockey district affiliate. During the 2012–2013 season, AAU junior and youth operations expanded rapidly and currently span coast to coast. More recently, AAU hockey has expanded their youth and Junior programs into Canada.\nToday, AAU is licensing playing opportunities at all youth age classifications, as well as scholastic, junior, collegiate and adult levels.\nAlthough some AAU clubs still use classification terms such as \"mites\" or \"midgets\", the official AAU youth designations indicate the age group with the format \"xU\", where \"x\" is the maximum age number and the \"U\" indicates \"and under\".\nOfficials.\nOfficials for youth hockey are often youth players themselves, calling games in lower levels than the one they participate in themselves. As with players who start out playing youth hockey, officials start their officiating career by officiating youth hockey, making it up through the ranks as their officiating skill increases. USA Hockey defines certain levels of their officials and so does Hockey Canada and the International Ice Hockey Federation.\nCurrently, many youth officials quit after a few games, mainly due to verbal abuse from parents, coaches and players. The other issue faced by young referees is a reluctance from older officials to give them more advanced games. In the US and Canada, news stories pop up from now and then that describes physical abuse on youth officials, in addition to verbal abuse. These problems were addressed in Hockey Canada's \"Relax, it's just a game\" campaign, which started in 2002.\nA youth official can usually move up the ladder to juniors after about 2 years of officiating, and after a few years move up to senior hockey. This is, as with players, different for each individual as their skill-curves are differently shaped.\nMany current and former officials feel that their officiating career has aided them in their professional life as well as being more comfortable with handling critical decisions and upset individuals."

        "text": "The Uttar Pradesh cricket team, formerly United Provinces Cricket Team, is a domestic cricket team which is based in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, run by the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association. The team competes in the first-class cricket tournament Ranji Trophy and limited-overs Vijay Hazare Trophy and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. They have won the Ranji Trophy in 2005–06 and have been runners-up on five occasions. Cricketers such as Suresh Raina, Mohammad Kaif, Piyush Chawla, Praveen Kumar, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav and Sudeep Tyagi have passed through Uttar Pradesh and gone on to represent India.\nCompetition history.\nThe team was formed in 1934 under the name of \"United Provinces\". The team's best performance in the Ranji Trophy in their early years came in 1939–40 when they finished as runners-up. In the 1950–51 season, the team's name was changed to \"Uttar Pradesh\".\nUttar Pradesh have not been strong in the Ranji Trophy cricket for any prolonged period in their history. Their only victory in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group was in the 2005–06 season. The Ranji Trophy win was one of the most spectacular comebacks in cricketing history, since at one point of time in the season Uttar Pradesh were on the brink of relegation.\nThey have finished runner-up twice before, once in 1997–98 against a strong Karnataka side, and once in 1977–78 against the same team under the captaincy of Mohammad Shahid and team manager was Karim Chishti, former captain Uttar Pradesh. They finished runners-up in the 2007–08 season, reprising a performance, similar to the one witnessed in the 2005–06 season, when they came back from the brink of relegation to win the championship. This time though, they lost to Delhi in the final.\nThis season's stellar performers were Mohammad Kaif, their captain who finished as the season's 3rd highest run-getter, medium pacer Sudeep Tyagi, season's 2nd highest wicket taker and Praveen Kumar who took 8 wickets in the Ranji Trophy final.\nTheir best performance in the Vijay Hazare Trophy came in 2004–05 when they were joint-winners with Tamil Nadu. In 2006 they won the Nissar Trophy, defeating Sialkot cricket team in Dharmasala. Their only appearance in the Irani Trophy came in the 2006–07 season in which they lost to the Rest of India team.\nNotable players.\nPlayers from Uttar Pradesh who have played Test cricket for India, along with year of Test debut:\nPlayers from Uttar Pradesh who have played ODI but not Test cricket for India, along with year of ODI debut :\nPlayers from Uttar Pradesh who have played T20I but not Test or ODI cricket for India, along with year of T20I debut :\nCurrent squad.\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\n\"Updated as on 19 February 2024\""

        "title": "Karnataka cricket team",
        "text": "Karnataka cricket team represents the Indian state of Karnataka in domestic cricket competitions. It has traditionally been one of the strongest teams in the domestic circuit and has produced many of Indian cricket team's iconic players. It was known as Mysore cricket team before the state of Mysore was officially renamed as Karnataka in 1973. It has won the Ranji Trophy eight times and has come second six times (including two runner-up positions for the earlier Mysore team). The team's home ground is the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. There was a major push in cricketing infrastructure in 2010s and as of now, grounds in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubballi are constantly used in Ranji Trophy, Vijay Hazare Trophy &amp; Karnataka Premier League\nCompetition history.\nKarnataka has produced some of the best cricketers from the southern part of India. There was a time during the late 90s when 8 out of 11 players were from Karnataka and from 1996 to 2001 there were about 4–5 players from Karnataka State consistently representing the Indian team.\nKarnataka has been the most dominant domestic cricket team of this decade(2010–19), winning 2 Ranji trophies, 2 Irani Cups, 4 Vijay Hazare trophies and 2 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy titles. This has been due to the emergence of a number of young players like K. L. Rahul, Manish Pandey, Karun Nair, Shreyas Gopal &amp; Krishnappa Gowtham in presence of established players like Vinay Kumar, Abhimanyu Mithun, Sreenath Aravind, Robin Uthappa &amp; C. M. Gautam\nIn the 90s, Karnataka was dominant along with Mumbai, winning the Ranji Trophies in the 1995/96, 1998/99 and the 1997/98 seasons, winning the finals against Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh respectively. This strong run in the Ranji Trophy was due to the emergence of players like Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath, Sunil Joshi, Venkatesh Prasad, Vijay Bharadwaj &amp; Dodda Ganesh all of whom went on to represent country.\nBefore that, the team of E.A.S. Prasanna, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Gundappa Viswanath, Roger Binny, Brijesh Patel, Raghuram Bhat &amp; Syed Kirmani led Karnataka to 3 Ranji titles (and 3 runners up title) in a span of 10 years between 1973 and 1982.\nIn the Irani Trophy, Karnataka has won six times and lost twice against the Rest of India team.\nThe team showed good performance in 2007–08 season. As international players had to move in and out of the squad due to their national duties, the team could not adjust well with the changes in a short period.\nA young Karnataka unit performed well in the 2009–10 season and made it to the finals comfortably. The finals took place at the picturesque Gangotri Glades in Mysuru, where Karnataka, backed by a charged full-house crowd, came up with a spirited performance but lost to Mumbai by just 6 runs. Manish Pandey was the highest scorer of the season with 882 runs from 9 matches.\nThe team emerged winners in the 2013–14 season under the captaincy of Vinay Kumar beating Maharashtra by 7 wickets in the finals played at Hyderabad. They went on to win the Irani Trophy (vs Rest of India) and Vijay Hazare Trophy (domestic ODI tournament) in the same season, thus completing a historic treble.\nKarnataka continued their dominance in 2014–15 season too. Firstly, they successfully defended the Vijay Hazare Trophy, winning their final against Punjab by 156 runs. They had a stupendous run in the Ranji Trophy too, and beat Tamil Nadu by an innings and 217 runs in the final at Mumbai to retain the trophy. Karun Nair scored 328, the highest ever individual score in a Ranji Trophy final (bettering Gul Mohammad's 319, scored in the 1946/47 season final). Vinay Kumar became the first captain to pick up a five-wicket haul and score a century in a Ranji final. In the Irani Trophy game that followed, they beat the Rest of India team by 246 runs and retained the trophy. By doing so, they not only repeated the historic treble of the previous season, but also became only the second domestic team (after Bombay) to bag back-to-back Irani Cups.\nKarnataka had a modest 2015–16 Ranji season, chalking up 2 wins, 1 loss and 5 draws in the league stage. They did not qualify for the knock-outs. Karnataka's only loss came against Maharashtra in their final league game, which ended an unbeaten streak of 37 first-class matches (20 wins, 17 draws) that stretched back to November 2012. Karnataka did not qualify for the knock-outs in the Vijay Hazare Trophy too, despite winning 4 of their 6 league games.\nIn the 2016–17 Ranji season, Karnataka had a good run until the quarter-finals, where they were beaten by Tamil Nadu in a low scoring game.\nKarnataka had a dominant run in the 2017–18 Ranji season, notching up 4 wins and 2 draws and topping Group A. They faced Mumbai in the quarter-finals and inflicted an innings defeat on them. However, they suffered a heart-breaking 5-run loss to Vidarbha in the semifinals and bowed out of the competition. Mayank Agarwal (1160 runs) and Krishnappa Gowtham (34 wickets) were the stand-out performers of the season.\nIn the 2018–19 domestic season, Karnataka won their maiden T20 title. They beat Maharashtra by 8 wickets in the final of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. They went on to defend their title in the 2019–20 season when they beat Tamil Nadu by 1 run in the finals.\nFamous players.\nPlayers from Karnataka who have played Test cricket for India, along with year of Test debut:\nPlayers from Karnataka who have played ODI but not Test cricket for India, along with year of ODI debut :\nPlayers from Karnataka who have played T20I but not ODI or Test cricket for India, along with year of T20I debut :\nCricketers who played a small portion of their first-class career for Karnataka, and played Test cricket for India, along with year of Test debut :\nOther notable Cricketers who played a considerable portion of their first-class career for Karnataka :\n† indicates inductees of KSCA Hall of Fame\nCurrent squad.\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\n\"Updated as on 22 March 2024\""

        "title": "1997 Major League Baseball expansion draft",
        "text": "On November 18, 1997, Major League Baseball (MLB) held an expansion draft to allow two expansion teams, the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, to build their rosters prior to debuting in the National League West and American League East divisions, respectively, in the 1998 MLB season. The draft took place in the Phoenix Civic Center in Phoenix, Arizona.\nBackground.\nFollowing the success of the 1993 expansion, which added the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins, MLB in 1994 set up an expansion committee to add two expansion teams. Tampa Bay and Phoenix were chosen for the two expansion franchises.\nProcedures.\nSimilar to the 1992 expansion draft, both expansion teams selected 35 players. The draft was divided into three rounds. Each team would select 14 players in round 1, 14 players in round 2, and 7 players in round 3. Tampa Bay general manager Chuck LaMar and Arizona general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. oversaw their teams' selections.\nThe Devil Rays and Diamondbacks could pick any player not on the protected lists of the 28 other teams, although no team could lose more than one player in a given round. The protected list for each team consisted of:\nAs with the 1992 expansion draft, the order was determined by a coin toss. The winner of the toss could choose either: (a) The first overall pick in the expansion draft or (b) allow the other team to pick first and receive both the second and third overall expansion draft picks and the right to pick first in the subsequent rounds of the expansion draft. Arizona won the toss and chose to select second.\nResults.\nThe Devil Rays reportedly considered trading the player they were to select first. They chose Tony Saunders from the Florida Marlins.\nNote, each noted All-Star player achieved that status in later season(s).\nPost-draft trades.\nOnce the draft was completed a number of trades were made. Teams had to wait until after the draft or risk losing their newly acquired players because they were not on their protected lists.\nAftermath.\nThe Diamondbacks intended to spend money. The day prior to the expansion draft, they signed Jay Bell to a $34 million contract across five years. Two weeks following the draft, the Diamondbacks traded Fryman and Martin to the Indians for Matt Williams.\nThe Devil Rays and Diamondbacks had differing results in their first years in MLB. Both teams altered their initial plans of developing youth; the Devil Rays acquired future Hall of Famer Wade Boggs and pitcher Wilson Alvarez along with sluggers Jose Canseco, Vinny Castilla, and Greg Vaughn while the Diamondbacks added Randy Johnson, Curt Schilling, Luis Gonzalez, Todd Stottlemyre, Steve Finley, Armando Reynoso, Greg Swindell, Tony Womack, Mark Grace, Reggie Sanders, Craig Counsell and Greg Colbrunn.\nWhile the Devil Rays consistently finished last in the AL East for the next decade, the Diamondbacks won the NL West title in , , and , and won the 2001 World Series."

Listed at 6' 2\", 190 lb., Williams batted and threw right handed. He was born in Radford, Virginia.\nWilliams was a two-time National League All-Star in and . In 2002, he finished third in the league with 46 saves. In his career, he posted a record of 32–54 with 144 saves and a 4.45 earned run average. When he was selected to the 2003 All-Star game, he set the record for being the pitcher with the highest ERA while making an All-Star team. He still remains the only pitcher to play in an All-Star game while having an ERA of over 6.00 during the same regular season.\nOne of Williams's most famous games was with the Phillies was on July 7, 1993, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was brought in as a reliever in the 14th inning, and pitched five shutout innings, gave up a single run in the top of the 20th inning, but subsequently won the game after the Phillies loaded the bases in the bottom of the inning and Lenny Dykstra hit a winning RBI double.\nOn September 24, 1996, after being hit by a ball in a previous inning, Williams threw a pitch inside to opposing pitcher Pedro Martínez of the Montreal Expos nearly hitting him, which led to Martínez charging after Williams and starting a bench-clearing brawl.\nWilliams grew up in Giles County in southwestern Virginia. Following his playing retirement, he returned to Giles County and has helped with many charities, being a big contributor to the Relay for Life cancer foundation in the community. Besides, the baseball field at Giles High School is named after him and his wife Melissa.\nWilliams played college baseball at Virginia Tech and in 2004 he was enshrined in the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame."

        "text": "James \"Hollywood\" Robinson (born August 31, 1970) is a former American professional basketball player, most notably in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is currently the head coach of the Vegas Ballers of TBL.\nRobinson, an undersized 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) shooting guard, attended the University of Alabama before being selected with the 21st overall pick in the 1993 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers.\nHigh school &amp; college.\nAs a high school star at Jackson, Mississippi's Murrah High School, Robinson played with another future NBA player, Lindsey Hunter.\nRobinson was named Mississippi Mr. Basketball &amp; was named a McDonald's All American in the same group that included such notable players as Kenny Anderson, Shaquille O'Neal, Jim Jackson, and Allan Houston. Robinson also won the All American slam dunk contest. He signed with Alabama, but was ineligible under the NCAA's Proposition 48 academic entrance guidelines. He redshirted, and after sitting out for a season he started play for the Crimson Tide in the 1991-92 season. As a redshirt freshman, Robinson came off the bench to average a team high 16.8 points per game, becoming the first freshman to lead the Tide in scoring since 1953.\nAs a junior at Alabama in 1992–93, Robinson led the Crimson Tide with 20.6 points per game, also tallying 4.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists per contest, and was named to the All-Southeastern Conference First Team. He set a school record by scoring 20 or more points in 12 straight games and became the first junior in Crimson Tide history to surpass 1,500 career points (he finished with 1,831). During his college career he played with two future NBA players, Latrell Sprewell and Robert Horry.\nRobinson's scoring average was the highest at Alabama since Buck Johnson's 20.7 in 1986. After such a stellar year, Robinson elected to pass up his senior season and enter the 1993 NBA draft.\nNBA.\nRobinson had an uneventful first professional season (58 games with 11 minutes per game), although he did compete in the NBA Slam Dunk Contest at the NBA All-Star Weekend, where he finished in last place (6th). He also has the distinction of being one of three Robinsons that the Portland Trail Blazers had on its roster in the 1995–96 NBA season, the others being Clifford Robinson and Rumeal Robinson. Robinson's importance in Portland increased from 1994–96, as Clyde Drexler was traded to Houston midway through 1994–95 and Terry Porter was often injured the following season. After that season, he was traded, along with Bill Curley and a conditional first-round pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves, for Isaiah Rider.\nAs a Timberwolf, Robinson achieved roughly the same averages than his final two Portland years, albeit in less playing time. Robinson did have a memorable December 30, 1996 game against the Cleveland Cavaliers in which he came off the bench to score 23 points in 10 minutes. In 1997–98, he signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Clippers, and posted similar numbers (almost 8 ppg in 84 games). Waived in March 1999, he would rejoin the Timberwolves, with little impact.\nMidway through 2000–01, after one season of absence, Robinson received a ten-day contract with the Orlando Magic, eventually his last NBA stint."

        "text": "Shawn William Barber (born January 14, 1975) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the fourth round of the 1998 NFL Draft. He played college football at Richmond.

He also earned all-district honors in basketball and lettered once in track. In addition, he also letter in baseball his senior year. He even dabbled in gymnastics in middle school.\nCollege career.\nBarber began his collegiate career at the University of Richmond as a safety but was moved to linebacker in his sophomore year. As a junior, Barber was an All-American honorable mention by the Associated Press and an all-Yankee Conference first-team selection. He recorded 94 total tackles (56 solo), six sacks, 13 tackles for a loss, and a forced fumble en route to becoming the Atlantic 10 Conference Defensive Player of the Year in 1997 as a senior.

        "title": "Trapeze (sailing)",
        "text": "In sailing, the trapeze is a wire that comes from a point high on the mast, usually where the shrouds are fixed, to a hook on the crew member's harness at approximately waist level. The position when extended on the trapeze is outside the hull, braced against it (or an extension of it outwards) with the soles of the feet, facing the masthead, and clipped on by a hook on the trapeze harness. This gives the crew member more leverage to keep the boat flat by allowing the crew member's centre of gravity to balance the force of the wind in the sails.\nAn additional benefit is the ability to \"walk\" along the gunwale to balance the boat's trim fore and aft. This is necessary to prevent racing catamarans such as the Tornado from digging the bow into the water, also called pitchpoling, and causing a nosedive and often a spectacular capsize.\nBoats may have only one trapeze, such as the 420 and the 29er, where only the crew uses the trapeze. Dinghies, such as the International 14 and the 49er, may have trapeze wires for both the skipper and the crew. The trapeze has several colloquial names such as \"the wire\" or simply \"the trap\".\nWhen a boat loses power in its sails, and heels to the windward side, the crew on the trapeze may get dipped in the water if they do not react in time.\nSome classes allow footloops on the gunwale to allow those on the trapeze to locate their feet with relative security. This helps to prevent the crew from swinging forward, sometimes round the forestay when the boat decelerates suddenly.\nRegulations.\nDue to safety concerns, the International Sailing Federation changed the rules in 2004 concerning trapeze harnesses, effective January 1, 2009: \"40.2 A trapeze or hiking harness shall have a device capable of quickly releasing the competitor from the boat at all times while in use.” However, the ISAF 2009–2013 Racing Rules of Sailing which took effect January 1, 2009 does not include this provision, so this rule change is postponed.\nQuick release harnesses are already widely in use, and make it possible for sailors to unhook themselves from the wire from all angles while it is under tension, thus decreasing the chance of getting trapped underwater or in dangerous conditions. The adoption of quick release harnesses has not been universal due to the reduced reliability of the moving parts; stories of such systems releasing unexpectedly have caused many to shun them in favour of traditional fixed hooks.\nHistory.\nThere are counterclaims for the origin of the device:\nOn balance it seems likely that Peter Scott developed Beecher Moore's \"Bell Rope\", which was satisfactory for river use, into the more seaworthy harness used on \"Thunder and Lightning\" in its 1938 Prince of Wales Cup success. The modern trapeze developed from there - in spite of some temporary official opposition."

        "text": "John Edward Wilson (June 14, 1929 – December 27, 2011) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and head coach. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Black Hawks, Toronto Maple Leafs, and New York Rangers between 1950 and 1962. With Detroit Wilson won the Stanley Cup four times. After his playing career he coached in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings, Detroit, the Colorado Rockies, and Pittsburgh Penguins between 1969 and 1980. He also coached the Michigan Stags/Baltimore Blades and Cleveland Crusaders of the World Hockey Association between 1974 and 1976, as well as the Canadian national team at the 1977 World Championship\nPlaying career.\nAfter three seasons with the Windsor Spitfires, Wilson signed his first professional contract with the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League in September 1949, but spent most of the 1949–50 season with their farm team, the Omaha Knights. He was called up by the Red Wings late in the season and helped them win the Stanley Cup. After spending most of the 1950–51 season in the minors, Wilson joined the Red Wings on a full-time basis midway through the 1951–52 season and went on to help them win three more Stanley Cups (1952, 1954, 1955).\nSoon after winning the Stanley Cup in 1955, Red Wings general manager Jack Adams traded Wilson to the Chicago Black Hawks as part of an eight-player swap. After two solid seasons in Chicago, he was reacquired by the Red Wings in the infamous Ted Lindsay trade and played two more seasons with the Red Wings before being traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1959. A year later, the Leafs sent Wilson to the New York Rangers, along with another player, for Eddie Shack. After two seasons with the Rangers, Wilson retired following the 1961–62 season.\nDuring his NHL career, Wilson scored 161 goals and 171 assists in 688 regular-season games and 27 points in 66 playoff games. He won the Stanley Cup four times with the Red Wings and appeared in two all-star games (1954, 1956). One of his most notable accomplishments was playing in 580 consecutive games between 1951 and 1960, making him the NHL's second \"iron man\".\nCoaching career.\nIn 1967, Wilson was hired as the head coach of the Springfield Kings of the American Hockey League, the minor league affiliate of the new Los Angeles Kings expansion team. Midway into his third season with Springfield, Wilson was promoted to interim head coach of the Los Angeles Kings after Hal Laycoe was fired following a dismal start to the season. However, Wilson was unable to turn the team around and returned to Springfield after the season was finished. He ended up leading Springfield to a Calder Cup title the very next season.\nAfter winning the Calder Cup in 1971, Wilson was hired by the Detroit Red Wings during the 1971–72 season as a midseason replacement. Despite having a winning record behind the Wings' bench, the team missed the playoffs two straight seasons and Wilson was let go. It would be 15 years before another Red Wings' coach would better Wilson's record.\nFrom there, he spent two years in the World Hockey Association, one with the Michigan Stags/Baltimore Blades (1974–75) and one with the Cleveland Crusaders (1975–76). He returned to the NHL, coaching one season with the Colorado Rockies (1976–77), and three with the Pittsburgh Penguins (1977–80), where he led the Penguins to two playoff appearances. Wilson returned to coach Springfield one more season and then retired from coaching in 1981.\nWilson was named coach of the Canadian national team that competed at the 1977 World Championship in Vienna. Canada, making an appearance at the event for the first time since 1969, finished fourth. The team was composed entirely of players whose teams had not qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs.\nPersonal.\nJohnny was the brother of Larry Wilson and uncle of Ron Wilson, both of whom played and coached in the NHL.\nWilson made his home in the Detroit area, together with his wife Pat, and was frequently seen at Red Wings home games. The couple has two children, a son, Kelly and a daughter, Tracy. Tracy A. Wilson, a former TV writer and show host, is currently writing a book - a true story that sent her on a journey into her father's life and led her to discover parts of her own as well. She also writes a blog called \"Tracy Wilson Writing Life\".\nOn December 27, 2011, Johnny died of pulmonary fibrosis at the age of 82. He had battled lung disease and colon cancer for several years."

        "text": "International Bowling Federation (IBF), formerly known as the Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs (FIQ) from 1952 to April 2014 and as World Bowling (WB) from April 2014 to November 2020, is the world governing body of nine-pin and ten-pin bowling. IBF was founded in 1952 in Hamburg, Germany by officials of the International Bowling Association (founded 1926) to foster worldwide interest in amateur ten-pin and nine-pin bowling, as well as international friendship by encouraging world and zone tournaments and other competition between bowlers of different countries. IBF has been recognized by the International Olympic Committee since 1979 as the governing body for bowling sports. Starting with five member federations in 1952, it grew to 141 in 2010.\nIBF has member federations located in all five Olympic regions. With more than 100 million participants, 10 million competitors and 250,000 bowling lanes, it is one of the largest and best organized sports in the world.\nHistory.\nThe foundation of IBF.\nThe first attempt to coordinate the sport of bowling at the world level by organizing world championships and by bringing uniformity through universal playing rules, was undertaken in 1926 by Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the US with the formation of the International Bowling Association (IBA).\nIn December 1951, the officials of the old IBA took initiative to invite delegates from all interested countries to come to Hamburg, West Germany on 27 January 1952 to discuss the status of bowling and the possible re-activation of the IBA.\nRepresentatives of the following countries attended the meeting in Hamburg, West Germany:\nThe unanimous decision of all present was to form a new international bowling federation. The first proposal was to make it a European federation, but it was pointed out that the US being a strong ten-pin country, may also want to affiliate. The new federation would be a worldwide international organisation with 4 different sections: One for Tenpin bowling and 3 for Ninepin bowling: Asphalt (later: Classic), Bohle and Schere.\nThe new organisation would be named as proposed by René Weiss from France, Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs (FIQ – International federation of Bowlers). Heinz Kropp from Germany was elected as its first President. Also Section Presidents were elected: for Tenpin Bowling – Hans Berger from Sweden; for the Asphalt Section – Leopold Hatzi from Austria; for the Bohle Section – Willi Stark from Germany; and for the Schere Section – Francois van Arkels from Belgium.\nAlthough Denmark was not present at the meeting, it had promised to attend and for this reason considered as a member and included among the countries practicing Bohle.\nAll federations were given the task to prepare for each respective section, playing rules as well as regulations for equipment and to circulate such information among the member federations for comments before the next ordinary meeting. Weiss and Hatzi were authorized to draft a proposal for a FIQ Constitution respecting the IOC regulations.\nEuropean and world Championships.\nThe first official IBF Championship was decided upon:\nThe ten-pin section was planning to conduct its 1st World Championships in Helsinki, Finland, in July 1952 during the Olympic Games. But because of Germany's disagreement based on the fact that three championships in the first year would be financially a heavy burden for the federation, it was decided that the Ten-pin Championships should be postponed to 1954.\nAfter the circulation of the minutes of that Conference, Austria wanted to add as a leading principle for the newly established FIQ, that the Chairmanship of the FIQ or of a Section is not given to a nation, but to a person who has been elected to the position. That person would also have the right to lead his/her own national federation. The FIQ received its first funds from the former IBA, which was eventually dissolved in March 1952.\nOne of the immediate tasks for the new leadership was to recruit more member federations. Either Ninepin or Tenpin could be found in:\nIt took some time, but in the first year Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Saarland and Spain accepted the invitation. Later, the German Democratic Republic (the former East Germany) and the Netherlands also accepted to be members.\nIn the first year (1952) there were also disappointments, because the 1st European Asphalt Championships had to be cancelled due to delayed preparations; they were moved to Zürich, Switzerland. The Championships for Schere, however, were held and were attended by participants from five countries.\nCongresses.\nThe first FIQ Congress was hosted by the German federation in November 1952 in Munich; eight member federations attended. During that meeting the first FIQ Constitution was adopted and it became the guideline and law for almost 20 years. Also a scale and method for charging annual membership fees was adopted. Also this lasted almost 20 years until the first raise of annual fees and a new scale were found necessary. Another decision adopted, which would be impossible to follow today, was that the official language for all Congress meetings was German. Rules, however, were to be printed also in English and French.\nThe last congresses in the history of the Federation Internationale des Quilleurs (FIQ) and World Tenpin Bowling Association (WTBA) were held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Tuesday, December 15, 2015, during which the merger of the two organizations into one entity, World Bowling.\nWorld Bowling has officially changed its name to the International Bowling Federation (IBF) and has vowed to properly act as the sport's global governing body.\nThe decision was made at the organization's Extraordinary Congress, which was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on the 2nd of November 2020.\nList of FIQ/World Bowling congresses:\nMembers.\n1953 brought six more member federations and in 1954 FIQ had 15 member federations in total. It took five more years (1959) to register the first non-European member federations: Mexico and Venezuela. These two countries had participated in 1958 in the World Tenpin Championships in Helsingborg, Sweden, as provisional members. The Constitution provided the Presidium the authority to grant new member federations provisional membership status, to be confirmed (or rejected) at the next regular congress.\nThe development of the membership looks as follows:\nDisciplines.\nIBF regulates two disciplines – tenpin and ninepin. The two organisations that administer these disciplines are the World Tenpin Bowling Association (WTBA) and the World Ninepin Bowling Association (WNBA). Both organizations were founded by WB (then FIQ) in 1973.\nWorld Tenpin Bowling Association (WTBA)\nWorld Ninepin Bowling Association (WNBA)"

The IFAF became a provisionary member of SportAccord in 2003, and became a full SportAccord member in 2005. The organization's head office is located in the French commune of La Courneuve, in the Île-de-France region.\nStructure and organization.\nThe IFAF recognizes in their respective areas the following branches and has 74 members as of September 2023:\nGovernance controversy and schism.\nFollowing the cancellation of the 2015 IFAF World Championship in Sweden for financial reasons, the event was moved to the United States. In February 2015 Tommy Wiking resigned as president of IFAF due to the cancellation of the event. During the 2015 meeting, Tommy Wiking was illegitimately put as president, and caused a schism. One group, in New York, elected Roope Norenen as interim president in September 2014, and Richard MacLean in 2015. The other group, based in Paris, recognized Tommy Wiking as president.\nIn September 2016, \"IFAF in Paris\" suspended six nations for not submitting players information for anti-doping, The suspended nations were the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Finland, and Denmark. A group of European federations wished for a reunification of the sport during a December 2016 meeting in Rome. In May 2017, after a split that created rival groupings of the International Federation of American Football, the IFAF grouping based in Paris stripped its recognition of USA Football, citing disputes over anti-doping enforcement. IFAF (Paris) instead recognized the United States Federation of American Football as the USA's governing body, and the USFAF organized a team to participate in the 2017 World Games, in which it won a bronze medal. The grouping of the IFAF based in New York continued to recognize USA Football and organized the 2017 Women's World Championships, which the USA won.\nIn March 2018, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) determined that the IFAF (NY) was the proper governing entity and voided all decisions of the other IFAF entity, including their decision to strip USA Football of its recognition. USA Football is currently the internationally recognized governing body for American football in the United States."

        "text": "The 14th IAAF World Championships in Athletics (Moscow 2013) () was an international athletics competition held in Moscow, Russia, from 10 to 18 August 2013. Initially, Russia won the most gold medals to top the table for the first time since 2001. It was also the first time ever the host nation took the top of the medal table. However, following the disqualification of Russian sprinter Antonina Krivoshapka for doping and after the redistribution of medals in the Women's 4 × 400 metres relay (as well as after series of other disqualifications of Russian athletes for doping offences), the United States moved to the top of the medal table with eight golds. In the overall medal count, the United States won 26 medals in total, followed by Kenya with 12. With 1,784 athletes from 203 countries it was the biggest single sports event of the year. The number of spectators for the evening sessions was 268,548 surpassing Daegu 2011.\nJamaica's Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce both won three gold medals in the men's and women's 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 × 100 metres relay respectively to become the most successful athletes at the event. This achievement also earned Bolt the title of being the most successful athlete in the history of the World Championships with eight gold and two silver medals. Prior to the competition, four sprinters were banned on doping charges.\nBidding process.\nWhen the seeking deadline passed on 1 December 2006, four candidate cities had confirmed their candidatures. These were: Barcelona (Spain), Brisbane (Australia), Moscow (Russia) and Gothenburg (Sweden). The IAAF announced Moscow the winning candidate at the IAAF Council Meeting in Mombasa on 27 March 2007.\nGothenburg backed out already in December, citing lack of financial support from the Swedish government. Barcelona had a record of hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics and the 1995 IAAF World Indoor Championships. It was chosen over Madrid and Valencia, which were at one point outlined as possible candidates. (Barcelona was later selected as the host for the 2010 European Athletics Championships).\nBrisbane simultaneously bid for 2011 and 2013 World Championships with the primary focus being on the 2011 event. Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre (ANZ Stadium) was the proposed venue. The venue had hosted the 1982 Commonwealth Games and 2001 Goodwill Games. It was also a failed bidder for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, which was eventually won by Berlin.\nIn the case of Moscow, Deputy Mayor Valery Vinogradov announced on 13 March 2006 that the city would bid for the 2011 Championships and suggested Luzhniki Stadium as venue. When the IAAF elected to decide the 2011 and 2013 events at the same meeting, Moscow added its name to the 2013 list. The city had hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics (also at the Luzhniki Stadium) and the 2006 IAAF World Indoor Championships.\nVenue.\nMain venue was Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow with a capacity of 78,360 spectators.\nEvent schedule.\nDay by day event schedule of the 2013 championships\nReference:\nEvent summary.\nThe championships featured 3 championship records, 22 world leadings, 2 area records, 48 national records but no world records. In addition to gold medals, individual winners received prize money of $60,000 where as members of winning relay teams received $20,000.\nMen.\nUsain Bolt of Jamaica moved to the top of the all-time World Championships medal table by winning three gold medals. He won the 100 metres, the 200 metres, and Jamaica won the 4 × 100 metre relay behind a strong anchor leg from Bolt who passed the United States' Justin Gatlin down the stretch. It was Bolt's second three gold performance at the World Championships. After the meet, his career total stood at 8 golds and 2 silvers, narrowly surpassing Carl Lewis' 8 golds, 1 silver, and 1 bronze. Trinidad and Tobago's Jehue Gordon edged America's Michael Tinsley by a hundredth of a second to win the 400-metre hurdles. It was the first gold for Trinidad and Tobago since 1997. Serbia's Emir Bekrić took bronze in national record time. Félix Sánchez, competing for the Dominican Republic, also made the final of the event, marking his seventh consecutive World Championship 400-metre hurdles final.\nGreat Britain's Mo Farah won the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres to become the second man in history to win both events at both the World Champions and the Olympics. The only man to do it before had been Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia. Stephen Kiprotich of Uganda became the first non-Kenyan to win the marathon at the World Championships since 2005. It was also Uganda's first men's title in the history of the event. Kiprotich became only the second man, after Gezahegne Abera, to follow an Olympic marathon gold medal with a world championship marathon gold medal. Ethiopians Lelisa Desisa and Tadese Tola took second and third respectively.\nIn the high jump, Bohdan Bondarenko set a Championship record of 2.41 (7'10.75\") en route to a gold medal in a highly competitive final. Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar took second and Derek Drouin set a Canadian national record while winning bronze.\nWomen.\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce became the first woman in World Championships history to sweep the sprint events when anchored Jamaica to gold in the 4×100-metre relay. Jamaica's time of 41.29 set a Championships record. Earlier in the meet, Fraser-Pryce won the 100 metres and the 200 metres. In the final of the 200 metres, Allyson Felix tore her right hamstring. A photo-finish gave Murielle Ahouré of the Ivory Coast the silver over Nigeria's Blessing Okagbare after both finished in the same time.\nGreat Britain's Christine Ohuruogu won the 400 metres in a national record time of 49.41. She came from behind to edge out defending champion Amantle Montsho of Botswana by 4 thousands of a second in a photo finish. Zuzana Hejnová won gold and set a Czech national record in the 400-metre hurdles. Eunice Sum of Kenya won her first major title, besting Olympic champion Mariya Savinova of Russia in the 800 metres.\nIn the 4×400 m relay, although the United States suffered a time-wasting exchange on the final leg, the Americans won by more than two seconds over Great Britain and France. The medal ceremony for the event took place at the 2017 IAAF World Championships in London upon the certification of results by the IAAF following the retroactive disqualification of first-place Russia when Antonina Krivoshapka was retroactively disqualified on a positive drug test in a 2017 retest of samples.\nRussia's Tatyana Lysenko set a World Championships record in the hammer throw en route to the gold. Caterine Ibargüen won Colombia's first ever World Championship gold by finishing first in the triple jump. Christina Obergföll of Germany won her first World Championships title in javelin.\nField.\nReference:\nStatistics.\nMedal table.\nA total of 47 sets of medals were distributed between 39 countries. Initially, host nation Russia topped the medal table with seven gold medals. However, after numerous disqualifications of Russians athletes for doping, the United States topped the medal table with eight golds. In the overall medal count, the United States won 26 medals in total, followed by Kenya with 12.\nPoints.\nThe IAAF placing table assigns eight points to the first place and so on to the eight finalists (except teams that do not start or are disqualified). 59 IAAF members received points.\n Host.\nParticipating nations.\n206 countries (or more accurately, IAAF members) participated with a total of 1974 athletes. The biggest delegation was the one of USA with 137 athletes. The number of athletes sent per nation is show in parentheses.\nReference:\nBroadcasting.\nAmerican coverage.\nIn the United States the IAAF sold exclusive rights to Universal Sports, a network associated with NBC Sports. Universal Sports can only be seen in about ten percent of the households in the American market. While NBC provided an hour and a half of coverage on weekend days, Universal Sports limited other distribution of the content, even online content requiring login with cable subscription user names. For those viewers without access to Universal Sports, nationwide coverage of the entire meet was generally limited to six hours of weekend coverage. The IAAF provided short YouTube highlight clips, a fraction of the online coverage they provided from Daegu two years earlier, instead promoting an internet radio feed and Twitter updates.\nControversies.\nThe introduction of a Russia federal law in June banning \"homosexual propaganda\" affected the championships hosted in Moscow. Western and international bodies had already condemned the move prior to the event, which was scheduled several months prior to the more prominent 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The IAAF deputy secretary general, Nick Davies, stated that the international nature of the competition might alter the country's perspective, but that the matter of gay rights would not be addressed by the championships, as long as its athletes were unaffected. Russian politician Vitaly Milonov had stated that the law would apply to athletes and tourists in the same way as Russian citizens. He also said those suggesting a boycott of the championships in protest of the laws were merely avoiding their competitors, saying \"sports competitions are a place where there can't be any politics\".\nSeveral athletes voiced their concerns over the issue of gay rights in Russia, but none boycotted the event. American runner Nick Symmonds, a supporter of the NOH8 Campaign for equal rights, said he would respect the host nation and its laws and would focus on sporting competition only in Moscow. However, he maintained his position as an advocate of gay rights and would silently dedicate his performance \"to my gay and lesbian friends back home\".\nTwo Swedish athletes, high jumper Emma Green Tregaro and sprinter Moa Hjelmer, attracted attention when they painted their nails in a rainbow pattern in support of gay rights and displayed the colours during the qualifying rounds. The IAAF notified the Swedish Athletics Federation that this gesture was in breach of rules on athlete conduct. The Swedish officials stood by Green Tregaro, but she relented under the pressure – in the high jump finals, she sported all red nails as a symbol of love. While watching the high jump finals, Paavo Arhinmäki, the Finnish Minister for Culture and Sport, waved a rainbow flag at the arena. Hjelmer had been eliminated in the first round of the 200 metres and did not compete again at the championships.\nRussia's Yelena Isinbayeva was a popular winner in the women's pole vault, but later drew controversy for her remarks criticizing Green Tregaro's nails. She said the protests were disrespectful towards the host nation and commented in English: \"We consider ourselves like normal, standard people, we just live boys with women, girls with boys...We have our law which everyone has to respect. When we go to different countries, we try to follow their rules.\" Following the negative reactions from other athletes and Western media she said that she had been misunderstood due to her grasp of English: \"What I wanted to say was that people should respect the laws of other countries particularly when they are guests. But let me make it clear I respect the views of my fellow athletes, and let me state in the strongest terms that I am opposed to any discrimination against gay people on the grounds of their sexuality (which is against the Olympic Charter).\"\nDuring the medal ceremony for the women's 4 × 400 metres relay images of Kseniya Ryzhova and Yuliya Gushchina sharing a kiss on the lips spread through social media and were interpreted as a protest against the anti-gay laws. Both Ryzhova and Gushchina denied any intention to make such a protest, rather they were simply happy with their athletic success, and stated that they were married to men. Although reports were principally focused on the pair, all four of the Russia relay runners briefly kissed each other on the podium. Ryzhova described her assumed connection to LGBT as insulting. The Russian Minister for Sport, Vitaly Mutko, said that Western media had overemphasised the issue, noting that same-sex relations are not illegal in Russia and sparser coverage of the issue in domestic media.\nAnti-doping.\nAt the championships the IAAF collected blood samples from all participating athletes, following the procedure introduced at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, in line with supporting its Athlete Biological Passport programme. This assisted the federation in detecting athlete's potential usage of banned substances, including steroids, human growth hormone, EPO and blood doping. In addition to the mandatory blood tests, the IAAF also conducted around 500 urine tests at the championships in three groups: all medallists were subjected to urine tests, those showing biological passport anomalies were targeted, and random urine tests were also applied. Continuing with procedures initiated at the 2005 edition, all urine tests were scheduled for long-term storage to allow retrospective testing in future. All athlete samples were processed at the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\nIn the months preceding the event around 40 Russian athletes received doping bans. The most prominent of these were Darya Pishchalnikova (discus runner-up at the 2012 Summer Olympics) and Olga Kuzenkova (former Olympic and world champion in the hammer throw). The Russian Athletics Federation president Valentin Balakhnichev defended the bans as proof of the increasing effectiveness of RUSADA (the Russian Anti-Doping Agency) which had been formed three years before. According to \"The New York Times\", Pishchalnikova was a whistleblower who sent the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) a December 2012 email detailing state-run doping programs in which Russian athletes had to participate; her ban by the Russian Athletics Federation was likely in retaliation.\nA month before the competition it was reported that the head of the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory, Grigory Rodchenkov, had been arrested on charges of drug distribution, but the case against him had been dropped. His sister was convicted of purchasing banned drugs with the intention to supply them to athletes. Former Russian coach Oleg Popov and 400 metres runner Valentin Kruglyakov stated that athletes were ordered to dope and paid officials to conceal their positive tests. The coach of the national athletics team, Valentin Maslakov, noted that Kruglyakov had tested positive for drugs and that Popov coached Lada Chernova, who had twice tested positive. He also stated that RUSADA and its labs were independent from the national sports federations. On 18 November 2015, WADA suspended laboratory of RUSADA – Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory, however the organization was not dissolved and tests are to be done by other independent labs.\nIn February 2016, two high-ranking directors of the organisation – Vyacheslav Sinyev and Nikita Kamayev – died. According to Sunday Times, Kamayev approached the news agency shortly before his death planning to publish a book on \"the true story of sport pharmacology and doping in Russia since 1987\".\nOutside of Russia, three of the world's top sprinters had positive tests during the buildup: Asafa Powell, Tyson Gay and Veronica Campbell Brown.\nThe drug testing results from the competition revealed several athletes had been using performance-enhancing drugs. The fifth-place finisher in the men's javelin, Roman Avramenko of Ukraine, tested positive for 4-Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone (a steroid), as did Turkmenistan's Yelena Ryabova (a competitor in the women's 200 m). Another 200 m runner, Yelyzaveta Bryzgina, also of Ukraine, was banned for the steroid drostanolone. Afghan 100 m runner Masoud Azizi had nandrolone in his sample. Two athletes in the walking events, Ayman Kozhakhmetova and Ebrahim Rahimian, failed their tests for EPO, as did Guatemala's marathon runner Jeremias Saloj.\nRussian doping scandal.\nMedia attention began growing in December 2014 when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The 335-page report, compiled following a nearly yearlong investigation by a commission led by former anti-doping agency President Dick Pound, urged the International Association of Athletics Federations to suspend Russia from competition, including the Olympics in Brazil. The report said Russia \"sabotaged\" the 2012 Olympics by allowing athletes who should have been banned for doping violations to compete in the London Games. It recommended the anti-doping agency impose lifetime suspensions for 10 Russian coaches and athletes, including women's 800-meters gold medalist Mariya Savinova. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported that they were unable to fully carry out their work and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents.\nAfter a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren. McLaren's investigation found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using a \"disappearing positive [test] methodology\" (DPM) from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\".\nAthlete desertion.\nOrlando Ortega, a Cuban athlete who competes in the 110 metres hurdles deserted his national delegation during the championships and did not return to Cuba at its conclusion. Ortega had received a six-month ban from the Cuban Athletics Federation earlier in the season for unspecified disciplinary reasons. Valentin Balakhnichev, the president of the Russian Athletics Federation, stated that he had had no contact from the athlete and in any case the federation was not looking to recruit him."

        "text": "The Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA) is a college athletic conference whose member schools compete in men's volleyball. Its member institutions are located in the Northeast United States.\nThe EIVA Tournament champion receives one of six automatic bids to the NCAA National Collegiate Men's Volleyball Championship. The other five automatic bids go to the two other traditional major volleyball conferences, the MIVA (Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association) and the MPSF (Mountain Pacific Sports Federation); the Big West Conference, which in the 2017–18 school year became the first Division I all-sports conference ever to sponsor men's volleyball; and two Division II conferences in Conference Carolinas and the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC). Before the 2014 tournament, the EIVA, MIVA, and MPSF received three of the four bids to the NCAA tournament, with the remaining entry being an at-large bid that was chosen from one of the three leagues by a committee of coaches from these leagues. The tournament expanded to six teams in 2014 when Conference Carolinas was given its automatic bid, seven in 2018 with the addition of the Big West champion, and eight in 2024 with the addition of the SIAC champion. The current lineup consists of the six conference champions and two at-large entries.\nPenn State won every conference championship from 1991 through 2017, with the exception of 1998 when Princeton captured the title and 2016 when George Mason won the title. Harvard and Princeton emerged on top in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The Nittany Lions are the only conference team to win the NCAA national championships, having captured the title in 1994 and 2008.\nAs of the current 2024 season (2023–24 school year), the EIVA consists of six schools: the University of Charleston (in West Virginia; not to be confused with the College of Charleston in South Carolina), George Mason University, Harvard University, the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Pennsylvania State University (Penn State or PSU) and Princeton University. All are Division I members except for D-II Charleston. The top four teams compete for the EIVA championship. The winner represents the conference in the NCAA Div. I/II national championships.\nThe most recent change to the EIVA membership came after the 2022 season. Sacred Heart University, St. Francis College (known athletically as St. Francis Brooklyn, from its New York City location), and Saint Francis University (in Pennsylvania) left to join the new men's volleyball league of their full-time home of the Northeast Conference (NEC). This left the EIVA with six members, the minimum needed to maintain its automatic NCAA tournament berth.\nThe next membership change will be Sacred Heart's return to the EIVA for the spring 2025 season after a two-season absence. The Pioneers' return coincides with the school's departure from the NEC to join the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.\nPreviously, from 2005-2006 to 2010-2011, the conference was divided into two divisions. The higher division was named the Tait Division and the lower division was named the Hay Division. The conference used a system of promotion and relegation whereby the last place team from the Tait Division went to the Hay for the following season and the highest ranked Hay Division team moved to the Tait. Prior to that, there was a second lower division (equal to Hay) named the Sweeney Division, but this was eliminated for the 2006 season. The two lower divisions were merged into one division at that time.\nOn April 28, 2012, Uvaldo Acosta (George Mason), Tom Hay (Springfield College), Ivan Marquez (Concordia [NY]), Bill Odeneal (SUNY New Paltz), Bob Sweeney (East Stroudsburg), and Tom Tait (Penn State) were inducted into the EIVA's inaugural Hall of Fame class during the 2012 EIVA Championship match at Penn State.\nMembers.\nAs of the 2023–24 school year, the EIVA has six member teams, five from the NCAA's Division I. The University of Charleston of Division II joined the conference for competition in 2016 after spending the 2015 season as an independent. The most recent change in membership was the departure of the three NEC members for their conference's new men's volleyball league; one of the three, St. Francis Brooklyn, had joined the EIVA only a year earlier. This will be followed in July 2024 by Sacred Heart's return to the EIVA.\nThrough the 2014 season, Division III Rutgers–Newark had been the EIVA's eighth member but spent its final years in the EIVA transitioning to Division III men's volleyball and left for the D-III Continental Volleyball Conference in 2015. Because Rutgers–Newark traditionally competed in the former University Division in men's volleyball before the NCAA created its current three-division setup in 1972, it had been allowed to award scholarships in that sport, making it one of only seven D-III schools then allowed to do so in any sport. As part of its D-III transition, it stopped awarding scholarships to new athletes in the 2011 season.\nConference arenas.\nFuture member in gray."

        "text": "The World Series of Pop Culture (also known as 2007 World Series of Pop Culture in season 2) was a VH1 game show tournament program sponsored by Alltel Wireless, based on Entertainment Weekly's Pop Culture Quiz. Sixteen teams, comprising three people each, compete to determine which team, collectively, knows the most about elements of popular culture. One of the teams each season (\"Almost Perfect Strangers\" in season 1, \"Almost Perfect Strangers 2.0\" in season 2) was made up of three qualifiers selected on the basis of a test over the internet; the three internet qualifiers had no other connection to each other.\nTapings for the first season took place in New York City from April 29–30, 2006 at the Ziegfeld Theatre. A wide range of topics are covered such as movies, music, TV and other miscellaneous pop culture. The top prize was $250,000. The show began on July 10, 2006, and the finale aired on Thursday, August 3, 2006. The hosts were Pat Kiernan and Lisa Guerrero.\nThe second season of the show premiered on July 9, 2007. Auditions for the second season were held in January and February, and the tapings took place on March 22 and 23 at the Grand Ballroom of the Manhattan Center. There were two online qualification tests that season which took place on February 14 and February 20. Kiernan returned as host, with season 1 competitors \"Cheetara\" (Erin Davidson, Katherine Gotsick, and Amber Tillett) replacing Guerrero as backstage interviewers.\nThe World Series of Pop Culture was not renewed for a third season in 2008.\nGameplay.\nEach show begins with a declaration of the rules:\nDuring each round, the category will be revealed. Categories could be as broad as \"Family TV\" or as specific as \"The Karate Kid.\" Once the category is revealed, the teams have to send a teammate to the microphone to play for that entire category. Unless only one player is left remaining, a player may not compete in two consecutive categories.\nThe chosen players each get one category per round, and each category contains six questions (three to each player). If a player cannot provide the right answer, his or her opponent gets the opportunity to steal. At the end of each category, the player who gets the fewest questions correct is eliminated from the game. Once a player attains enough points that the opponent cannot beat, the category ends at that point.\nIn the event of a tie, a tiebreaker question determines who remains in the competition and who gets knocked out. The tiebreaker question contains an even number of multiple answers. Both players give one answer in succession, starting with the player who answered first in the tied category, until one player gives an incorrect answer. When an incorrect answer is given, and if the score is still tied, the opposing player must give one more correct answer to win. If the opposing player already has more correct answers by virtue of going first, that player immediately wins the category.\nIf the tiebreaker ends unresolved, either with both players answering incorrectly or if all correct answers have been given, a new tiebreaker round begins, but the first player to answer is switched.\nThe first team to eliminate all three of their opponents wins and moves on to the next round.\nIn the first-season World Series of Pop Culture final, airing first on August 3, 2006 each category (namely \"Tom Cruise Movies\", \"TV Teen Dramas\", \"1990s Lyrics\", and \"Fictional Locales\") involved ten questions rather than the typical six. The second-season final featured six-question categories."

Of the 20 countries competing in the World Cup in 2011, there was only one change: Uruguay replaced Russia. This was the first World Cup with no new teams to the tournament.\nReigning champions New Zealand won the cup and defended their title by defeating Australia 34–17 in the final; South Africa defeated Argentina to take third place. This was the first Rugby World Cup where no Northern Hemisphere team got beyond the quarter-finals. New Zealand were the first team to retain their title and the first to win for a third time.\nThe highly contested match between Japan and South Africa on the opening weekend, in which Japan scored the winning try in the final minute, was widely considered the biggest upset in the history of rugby. Hosts England were eliminated at the pool stage, after defeats by Wales and Australia; this was the first time the knockout stage did not feature a host nation.\nHost selection.\nSubmission of interest.\nThe International Rugby Board (IRB) requested that any member unions wishing to host this tournament or the 2019 Rugby World Cup should indicate their interest by 15 August 2008. This would be purely to indicate interest; no details had to be provided at this stage. A record 10 unions indicated formal interest in hosting the 2015 and/or the 2019 events: Australia, England, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Russia, Scotland, South Africa and Wales. Argentina had been reported in early 2008 as having given preliminary consideration to bidding, but did not ultimately formally indicate an interest in bidding.\nOf the 10 nations that had expressed formal interest, many withdrew their candidacy in early 2009. Jamaica was the first to withdraw its candidacy. Russia withdrew in February 2009 to concentrate on bidding for the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens, Australia and Ireland withdrew in spring 2009 due to financial reasons. Scotland withdrew in April 2009 after they were unable to secure co-hosting partners for the tournament. Wales was the last nation to officially pull out after they failed to submit a bid by 8 May 2009, but Wales backed England's bid and some games were played at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.\nFinal bids.\nThe final nations that bid for the right to host the 2015 Rugby World Cup were England, Japan, South Africa and Italy. Four confirmed bids was a record number for the Rugby World Cup.\nOn 28 July 2009, the IRB confirmed that England would host the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and Japan would host the 2019 event, having voted 16–10 in favour of approving the recommendation from Rugby World Cup Ltd (RWCL) that England and Japan should be named hosts. RWCL chairman Bernard Lapasset revealed the result on 28 July 2009 at IRB headquarters.\nEngland.\nIn September 2007, \"The Guardian\" reported that the Rugby Football Union had decided to submit a bid. BBC News reported in February 2009 that the intent was for a solo bid from the RFU, but with the possibility of some matches being played in Scotland, Wales or Ireland. It was hoped that the 2015 World Cup would add to Britain's \"Decade of Sport\" (including the 2012 Summer Olympics, 2013 Rugby League World Cup and 2014 Commonwealth Games).\nIt was also claimed that the bid had a very strong chance of success due to the IRB's belief that the 2011 tournament might make a loss, therefore making it particularly important to ensure a profit, which was considered a strong point of England's proposed bid. The chief executive of the Rugby Football Union, Francis Baron, said that the tournament would target sales of 3 million tickets. England's package was projected to generate £300 million for the IRB – £220 million in commercial returns from broadcasting, sponsorship and merchandising, and the £80 million tournament fee.\nItaly.\nItaly stated its desire to host, and an Italian bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2015 or 2019 was confirmed on 20 July 2008. Italy declared that it wanted to host \"For the Enlargement of the Frontiers of Our Sport\". It was a slogan relevant to the then-current landscape of World Cup rugby, given that 2007 was the first time that the Rugby World Cup was hosted by a primarily non-English-speaking country.\nThe Italian bid offered the largest cities and stadiums in the country and promised a fast domestic train system. The Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) also included the importance of the population and the growth of rugby since Italy joined the Six Nations in 2000 as reasons for hosting a World Cup. Rugby had been growing increasingly popular in Italy in recent years, with improved crowds at international matches.\nThe Stadio Olimpico in Rome had been proposed as the venue to host the final and the first match of the tournament. Milan and Naples were included as the other large venues. The entire list was a selection of large stadiums spread across the country. Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, France was also included as the tenth proposed venue.\nJapan.\nThe Japan Rugby Football Union officially submitted its tender to the IRB in May 2009. Japan was seen as a favourite to host after finishing as runner-up in the bidding for the 2011 event. Japan was seen as having a lot to offer rugby's growth in Asia. Its population of 127 million, its large economy, and its ability to place rugby before a new Asian audience made it a front-runner for hosting rights. Furthermore, rugby in Japan had developed a following, and with 126,000 registered players, Japan had more players than some of the Six Nations. Japan's Top League was a showcase for Japanese rugby, and there was excitement about Japan's entry into the RWC. Japan's experience in co-hosting the 2002 FIFA World Cup was also seen as a boost, with Japan already possessing the necessary stadiums and infrastructure.\nSouth Africa.\nThe South African Rugby Union (SARU) had confirmed its intent to bid for the 2015 tournament, and in May 2009 South Africa delivered its application to the IRB. South Africa had previously made an unsuccessful bid to host the 2011 RWC. The strengths of a South African bid would be that it is in the same time zone as Europe, the wealthiest television market from a rugby perspective, that South Africa were the current World Cup holders, that they had successfully hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup, won the 2007 Rugby World Cup and that they were in the process of building large new stadiums for the then-upcoming 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nVenues.\nAfter England were appointed tournament hosts on 28 July 2009, the proposed stadia for the tournament were revealed. The final venues were confirmed, along with the tournament's schedule, on 2 May 2013. Twelve of the stadia were located in England, while the Millennium Stadium located in neighbour Wales was also to be used. In 2011, the IRB approved the use of the Millennium Stadium, despite being outside of the host country, due to its capacity and strategic location. Of the thirteen venues, two were dedicated rugby union grounds (Kingsholm Stadium and Sandy Park), two were national rugby stadia (Twickenham and the Millennium Stadium), two were multi-purpose stadia (Wembley Stadium and the Olympic Stadium), and the remainder were association football grounds.\nProposed venues that did not make the final selection were the Stadium of Light in Sunderland, Coventry's Ricoh Arena, St Mary's Stadium in Southampton, Pride Park Stadium in Derby, Anfield in Liverpool and Bristol's Ashton Gate. In April 2013, Old Trafford was withdrawn from consideration by its owners, Manchester United F.C., citing commitments to hosting rugby league and its Super League Grand Final and concerns about pitch degradation. The RWCL then approached neighbouring Manchester City about leasing their home stadium as a replacement. City agreed to let their stadium be used for the tournament but only for one match due to footballing commitments – down from the original three which were to be played at Old Trafford. Etihad Stadium, as it was known for football sponsorship purposes, would be called 'Manchester City Stadium' by organisers for the duration of the tournament.\nSource: \"The Telegraph\"\nTeam bases.\nThe 41 venues that acted as bases for the teams were announced on 26 August 2014. All prospective team bases were subject to a rigorous selection process, which included a programme of detailed site visits as well as liaison with the competing teams. Each team base included an outdoor and indoor training facility, a swimming pool, gym and hotel and would be used by the competing teams in the lead up to and during the World Cup.\nQualifying.\nOf the 20 teams competing at the 2015 World Cup, 12 of them qualified by finishing in the top three places in their pools in the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The other eight teams qualified through regional competition. As the host nation, England qualified automatically. The qualification process for the remaining teams incorporated existing regional competitions such as the European Nations Cup.\nQualified teams.\nTwenty teams played in the final tournament. They are listed below, along with their pre-tournament positions in the World Rugby Rankings. The list of teams was the same as in the 2003 tournament.\nDraw.\nSeedings for the pools of the 2015 World Cup were based on the teams' respective IRB Rankings. The draw, hosted by Will Greenwood, was conducted on 3 December 2012 in London, and used the World Rankings as of that day, just after the 2012 end-of-year rugby union internationals, which finished on 1 December 2012. The 12 automatic qualifiers from 2011 were allocated to their respective bands based on their rankings:\nThe remaining 8 qualifying places were allocated to Bands 4 and 5, based on previous World Cup playing strength;\nThis meant the 20 teams, qualified and qualifiers, were seeded thus:\nThe draw saw a representative randomly draw a ball from a pot, the first drawn ball goes to Pool A, the second Pool B, the third Pool C and the fourth Pool D. The draw began with Pot 5, drawn by All Blacks captain Richie McCaw, followed by Pot 4, drawn by RWC 2015 Ambassador and English women's international Maggie Alphonsi, then Pot 3, drawn by Mayor of London Boris Johnson, Pot 2, drawn by the then Chief Executive for RWC 2015 Debbie Jevans, and finally Pot 1, drawn by IRB chairman Bernard Lapasset.\nDraw criticism.\nThe timing of the draw drew criticism due to the long period between the draw occurring and the commencement of the tournament – three years. Indeed, by the time of the pool match between England and Wales on 26 September, pool A contained the 2nd, 3rd and 4th (Australia, England and Wales) ranked teams in the world. Following England's elimination at the pool stage after defeats by Australia and Wales, Wales coach Warren Gatland noted that \"Everyone is making a thing about the first home country to hold a World Cup to miss out on the quarter-finals, but the stupid thing, as we all know, is why was the World Cup draw done three years ago? That's just ridiculous as far as I am concerned. If they had followed the football model, then we wouldn't be in this position. There are other people outside this who need to have a look at themselves and why those decisions were made, and you have got to feel sorry for the people involved and who this has affected\". The chief executive of World Rugby Brett Gosper subsequently acknowledged criticisms, saying \"We’ll look at that next time to see if it's possible to make the draw closer to the tournament\".\nSquads.\nEach country was allowed a squad of 31 players for the tournament. These squads were to be submitted to World Rugby by a deadline of 31 August 2015. Once the squad was submitted, a player could be replaced if injured, but would not be allowed to return to the squad. There was also a stand-down period of 48 hours before the new player was allowed to take the field. Hence, a replacement player called into a squad on the eve of a game would not be permitted to play in that game.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony of the 2015 Rugby World Cup took place at Twickenham Stadium in London on 18 September 2015 at 19:20 (BST). The ceremony told the legend of how William Webb Ellis created the sport of rugby union, and featured the choir of Rugby School singing \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\", an anthem of rugby union in England. All the participating teams were represented by a former player in the ceremony; the host nation, England, was represented by World Cup-winning captain Martin Johnson. The ceremony was directed by Kim Gavin, who was also responsible for directing the closing ceremonies of both the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, who had an acting part previously in the ceremony, declared the tournament officially open, ending his speech with the words, \"We're ready. Game on.\" British Prime Minister David Cameron said on social media that the 2015 Rugby World Cup would be the best ever.\nPool stage.\nThe first round, or pool stage, saw the 20 teams divided into four pools of five teams, using the same format that was used in 2003, 2007, and 2011. Each pool was a single round-robin of ten games, in which each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same pool. Teams were awarded four points for a win, two points for a draw and none for a defeat. A team scoring four tries in one match scored a bonus point, as did a team that lost by fewer than eight points.\nThe teams finishing in the top two of each pool would advance to the quarter-finals. The top three teams of each pool received automatic qualification to the 2019 Rugby World Cup (Japan had already automatically qualified as hosts).\nIf two or more teams were tied on match points, the following tiebreakers would apply:\nIf three teams were tied on points, the above criteria would be used to decide first place in the Pool, and then the criteria would be used again (starting from criteria 1) to decide second place in the Pool.\nAwards.\nAt the 2015 World Rugby Awards, Japan's game-winning final try against South Africa was named the best match moment of the tournament. A dream team was named made up of the best performing players of the tournament.\n2015 Rugby World Cup dream team\nStatistics.\nThe tournament's top point scorer was Argentine fly-half Nicolás Sánchez, who scored 97 points. \nNew Zealand wing Julian Savea scored the most tries, eight, equalling the record for one tournament set by his compatriot Jonah Lomu and South African Bryan Habana.\nMatch officials.\nWorld Rugby named the following twelve referees, seven assistant referees and four television match officials to handle the pool stage games:\nMedia coverage.\nITV Sport was the UK and worldwide host broadcaster for the 2015 event, having signed a deal in 2011 to broadcast the 2011 and 2015 RWC tournaments. ITV won the rights after outbidding rivals including the BBC and Sky Sports. It showed every match from the tournament live in the UK on ITV or ITV4.\n1 Except British Indian Ocean Territory – Chagos Archipelago, Cape Verde, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mayotte, North Africa, Réunion, Somalia, South Sudan and Tristan da Cunha\n2 Except Belize\n3 Except Brazil and South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands\nVideo game.\nThe officially licensed \"Rugby World Cup 2015\" video game was released on 4 September 2015 on PC, PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. IGN rated the game 1.5/10, calling it \"unbearable to play\".\nTickets.\nTicket prices were announced in November 2013 with general sale applications launching in September 2014. Adult ticket prices started at £15 for pool matches and children's tickets were available from £7 at 41 of the 48 matches. Tickets for the final ranged from £150 to £715."

        "title": "Rugby union in England",
        "text": "Rugby union in England is one of the leading professional and recreational team sports. In 1871 the Rugby Football Union, the governing body for rugby union in England, was formed by 21 rugby clubs, and the first international match, which involved England, was played in Scotland. The England national team compete annually in the Six Nations Championship, and are former world champions after winning the 2003 Rugby World Cup. The top domestic men's club competition is Premiership Rugby, and English clubs also compete in international competitions such as the European Rugby Champions Cup. The top domestic women's competition is the Premier 15s.\nHistory.\nRugby School and foundation of early clubs.\nRugby in England is generally attributed to when William Webb Ellis \"who with a fine disregard for the rules as played in his time, first took the ball in his arms and ran with it\" in 1823 at the Rugby School, although modern scholars consider this story to be a myth. One of the earliest football clubs formed, some claim it to actually be the first, is the Guy's Hospital Football Club which was founded in 1843 in Guy's Hospital, Southwark, London. The club played an early version of rugby football and was formed by old boys of the Rugby School. Subsequent clubs established in this period include Dublin University Football Club in 1854 and the Blackheath Rugby Club in 1858.\nThe forming of the RFU.\nThe Football Association was formed at the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, on Lincoln's Inn Fields, London on 26 October 1863, with the intention to include the most acceptable points of play under the one heading of football. However, disagreements over what was being excluded led the Blackheath Club to withdraw from the association which was followed by a number of other clubs. In 1870, Richmond F.C. published an invitation in the newspapers which read \"Those who play the rugby-type game should meet to form a code of practice as various clubs play to rules which differ from others, which makes the game difficult to play\". In January of the following year, 21 clubs meet at the Pall Mall Restaurant and the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was founded.\nFirst international and the schism in rugby.\nOn 27 March 1871 the first ever international match took place, involving the England and Scotland. The Scottish side won the match, which was played at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. In 1884, England opted not to join the International Rugby Football Board which was formed by Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as they thought they should have greater representation on the board as they have the larger number of clubs.\nBy the late 19th century, the issue over broken time in rugby had become important, particularly in the North of England, where a larger working class played rugby compared to the south, thus their work and injuries they received whilst playing came into conflict with the rules of amateurism. With mounting pressure regarding player payments and veiled professionalism, on 29 August 1895 at a meeting at the George Hotel, Huddersfield, 21 clubs met to form the Northern Rugby Football Union and thus resigned from the RFU. The game of rugby league was formed from the disaffected clubs.\nDuring this period, rugby was played between counties similar to the system of first-class cricket in England now. In 1907, Cornwall won the county tournament and went on to represent Britain at Rugby union at the 1908 Summer Olympics.\nTwickenham and centenary celebrations.\nThe 1910 opening of the RFU's new home at Twickenham heralded a golden era for English rugby union. During the First World War, the Four Nations Championship became suspended in 1915 and it was not resumed until 1920. One hundred and thirty three international players were killed during the conflict. In 1923, a century of rugby was celebrated at the Rugby School, which saw an England and Wales XV play a Scottish-Irish team.\nWorld War II.\nFor duration of World War II the ban on rugby league players was temporarily lifted by the RFU. Many played in the eight rugby \"Internationals\" between England and Scotland which were played by Armed Services teams. The authorities also allowed the playing of two \"Rugby League vs. Rugby Union\" fixtures as fundraisers for the war effort (both matches were won by the rugby league teams playing rugby union). In 1958, long after the William Webb Ellis had become engraved as a legend in the history of rugby union, his grave was finally located by Ross McWhirter in the French town of Menton near the border with Monaco.\nFormation of leagues.\nThe RFU had long resisted leagues competitions, as it was thought that they would encourage player payments, thus most club matches were only organised friendlies, with competitions such as the County Cups and County Championship existing also. In 1972 the RFU sanctioned a knock-out competition, which was revamped in 2005 into a competition for top-tier English and Welsh sides now known as the LV= Cup. The league evolved over time since starting in 1987 when the Courage Leagues were formed, a league pyramid that had more than 1000 clubs playing in 108 leagues; each with promotion and relegation.\nProfessionalism.\nThe Heineken Cup was formed in 1995 as a competition for twelve European clubs and ran through to the 2013–14 season, after which it was replaced by the European Rugby Champions Cup. Both competitions involve sides from England, France, Wales, Ireland, Scotland and Italy. The century-old competition for the European rugby powers became the Six Nations Championship in 2000 with the addition of Italy.\nIn November 2008 a proposal was made and adopted by the RFU to create a fully professional second tier of club rugby, to be called the Championship. It replaced National Division One starting with the 2009–10 season.\nGoverning body.\nThe Rugby Football Union are the governing body for rugby union in England.\nCompetitions.\nPremiership.\nThe 11-team Premiership is the top level of competition; it is fully professional, but has a salary cap in place. The RFU Championship (formerly National Division One) and National League 1 (formerly National Division Two) are the next levels down. The Championship became fully professional in 2009–10 but many teams have since returned to semi-professional; League 1 is semi-professional. Below this there are many regional leagues. Attendances at club rugby in England have risen strongly since the sport went professional. Some clubs have good all seater grounds in the 10,001–25,000 capacity range; some have older grounds which are still partly terraced, and others play in council-owned joint-use stadia. Some clubs rent stadia from football clubs.\nHeineken Cup and European Rugby Champions Cup.\nFrom 1995 through to 2014, the top-level European club competition was the Heineken Cup, contested by the best teams from the Six Nations countries of England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. Through its history, it was viewed by some as the top prize in European rugby for club teams. In April 2014, after two years of negotiations, it was confirmed that the Heineken Cup would be replaced by the new European Rugby Champions Cup beginning in the 2014–15 season. The Champions Cup includes the top eight teams from the previous season's Premiership.\nAnglo-Welsh Cup and Premiership Rugby Cup.\nThe Anglo-Welsh Cup, known by several sponsored names during its history, was the successor to a tournament founded in the 1971–72 season as the RFU Club Competition. It was originally a national knock-out competition for English club teams, and went through several sponsored names in the next quarter-century. Starting in the 2005–06 season, it was changed into a competition for Premiership clubs plus the Welsh sides competing in the Celtic League, now Pro14. The EDF National Trophy was founded in 2005–06 as a new knock-out competition solely for English clubs, but Premiership sides do not take part. Through the 2013–14 season, the strongest Premiership teams took part in the Heineken Cup and the rest of the Premiership competed in the Amlin Challenge Cup. Since the 2014–15 season, the top Premiership sides compete in the Champions Cup, with the rest of the league involved in the new European Rugby Challenge Cup.\nFollowing the 2017–18 edition of the Anglo-Welsh Cup, the Welsh regions pulled out of the competition in favour of creating a dedicated U-23 competition for that country alone. Premiership Rugby, the company that operates the top English flight, then announced that it would launch the new Premiership Rugby Cup, featuring all 12 league members, effective with the 2018–19 season. The competition will also feature Championship teams in 2023–24.\nBritish and Irish Cup.\nThe British and Irish Cup was a competition founded in 2009–10 by all four Home Unions for lower-tier professional and semi-pro teams throughout Great Britain and Ireland. In the competition's third season it was expanded to 32 sides from its original 24; it featured all twelve teams from both the RFU Championship and the Welsh Premier Division (the level below Pro14), \"A\" sides from all four Irish provinces, and the top four sides from the Scottish Premiership. The 32 teams were divided into eight pools, each with a round-robin format. The pool winners then advance to knockout quarter-finals, followed by semi-finals and a final. For season 2013–14 the competition returned to 24 sides with the reduction of Welsh clubs from twelve to four. The final English team to have won are Ealing Trailfinders in 2018. In England the tournament was replaced by the Championship Cup.\nNational Schools Cup.\nThe National Schools Cup is the English school's rugby union cup competition. The cup and vase finals are held at Twickenham Stadium. Competitions are held at the U18 and U15 age group levels. At each age group there are four competitions, with stronger teams entering the cup and weaker teams in the vase, and first round losers of each entering the plate and bowl respectively.\nMiddlesex 7s.\nThe Middlesex 7s is the premier club-level rugby sevens event held in England (note, however, that international sides have taken part on occasion).\nLondon Sevens.\nNational men's sevens teams compete annually in the London Sevens at Twickenham, which has usually been the final event in each season's World Rugby Sevens Series since 2011–12, though it is not the final event in the current 2017–18 series.\nPremiership Derbies.\nThe following games are considered premiership derbies.\nThe North of England, in which Rugby league is dominant, does not have an established derby rivalry in the top tier; the two northern outposts of Sale Sharks and Newcastle Falcons represent the fifteen-man game in the region. In the past, Leeds Carnegie, Doncaster Knights and Rotherham Titans have contested Yorkshire derbies, while Liverpool St. Helens and Orrell R.F.C. have provided local Lancashire rivalries.\nPopularity.\nParticipation.\nAccording to World Rugby, England has 1,900 rugby union clubs; 6,060 referees; 362,319 pre-teen male players; 698,803 teen male players; 121,480 senior male players (total male players 1,182,602) as well as 11,000 senior female players.\nBut these statistics are somewhat unreliable. Sport England indicates that 170,200 people play rugby at least once a week.\nRugby union has often been considered, somewhat pejoratively, a 'posh' game. This may be historically linked to the split between Northern teams and the rest of the rugby fraternity over 'broken time payments', i.e. professionalism. This split led to the development of the separate sport of rugby league. The amateur ethos made it difficult for players who could not afford to take time off work to play away games or to go on tour - an integral part of the rugby tradition. Rugby union in many parts of England is associated with fee-paying independent schools such as Stonyhurst College or Sedbergh School who have historically provided many of the national players. It is also commonly played at Grammar schools, but Comprehensive schools in much of the country tended not to play the game, although this is no longer the case. Whilst rugby union was officially an amateur sport, many rugby union players came to play rugby league. In recent years this trend has reversed and some rugby league players have crossed codes to play union.\nDue to the split with most of the Yorkshire and Lancashire clubs, rugby union remained more popular in the South and the Midlands than the North of England, although this trend is now nowhere near as prevalent, with many teams in the North able to field four or five senior sides per week. The Newcastle Falcons and Sale Sharks are the only Northern teams in the Premiership, whereas Yorkshire Carnegie has also competed there previously.\nAlthough three of the teams in the Premiership have historic links with London, one of these has now moved to a neighbouring town, and only Harlequins and Saracens now play in the capital, respectively in the outer suburbs of Twickenham and Hendon (Saracens had also played in a neighbouring town before returning to London in early 2013). Historically, London was host to a number of high level professional 'exiles' clubs, notably London Scottish, London Welsh and most successfully London Irish, as well as to the defunct Wasps before its ill-fated moved north to the city of Coventry. At an amateur level, however, rugby remains very strong in the London area.\nAs of July 2022, transgender women are prohibited from playing contact rugby in women's competition; they remain eligible for male competition, in line with World Rugby rules. Transgender men may play in male competition, but have to carry out a risk assessment and sign a disclaimer, as their inclusion in the men's game as seen as more dangerous to themselves than to opponents. Both rules have provoked controversy in terms of trans inclusion, and women's safety.\nInterest in the population and viewing figures.\nEnglish rugby union receives extensive coverage from major media outlets. Currently BT Sport covers the majority of Gallager Premiership games, the BBC and ITV share coverage of the Six Nations, Sky covers England's June &amp; November internationals and ITV covers the Rugby World Cup. BT Sport and Sky Sports share coverage of the European club competitions.\nThe percentage of people declaring to be interested in rugby union in England has been fairly constant over the period 1996–2005, for which we have data. This proportion decreased slightly from 24% in 1995 to 18% before the 2003 Rugby World Cup, it jumped to 27% after England's victory over Australia in the World Cup final. In 2005, 23% of the population were declaring an interest in rugby union, placing this sport at the 6th place in England. To the question whether they watch rugby union on TV, 21% of sampled people answered positively in 2005, up two points relative to 1996 (19%). In this category, it places rugby union at the second place in England behind football. The viewing figures for the final of the Premiership indicate that 91,000 viewers watched the 2011 final on TV when it was broadcast on ESPN for the first time. In 2010, the final was watched by 225,000 viewers on Sky.\nIn terms of average attendance, the Aviva Premiership is the third best attended club competition in England behind the top two association football leagues, the Premier League and The Championship. The highest club attendances at Aviva Premiership matches are starting to become similar to some of the lower attended matches in football's Championship, with game attendances averaging 12,500 in 2011 compared with 17,400 in the football Championship.\nHistorically rugby union was a participatory sport rather than a spectator sport in England and attendances at club games were low. Leicester Tigers for example averaged less than a hundred spectators in the 1970s. However, attendances at Twickenham for the national team have always been very high. Games in the Six Nations Championship and Rugby World Cup have always been shown on network TV. Many people watch these games but don't follow club rugby, mainly due to the fact that the pay-TV Sky Sports owns the rights to the game broadcasts, and highlights are rarely shown on network television.\nResearch from 2003 stated that the majority of spectators are from the AB1 demographic group with a gender ratio of approximately 80% male and 20% female at live domestic professional matches. However, this is a general picture of the sport across the country as a whole and, in some parts of the country, the game has widespread grassroots support. This is particularly true of the West Country, especially in Cornwall and in the cities of Bristol, Bath and Gloucester, where the game is more popular without significant class differentiation. In the Midlands, the game competes with football and the larger clubs, such as Leicester Tigers, Northampton Saints and Coventry, have considerable fanbases and strong traditions.\nThe national team.\nThe England national team is currently the second best team in the history of the Six Nations Championship with three titles and one Grand Slam. When taking into account the Home Nations and Five Nations tournaments, England has more title and Grand Slams than any other nation. England contest the Calcutta Cup with Scotland and the Millennium Trophy with Ireland as part of the Six Nations Championship. They were World Champions from 2003 to 2007 and also made the finals of the 1991 and 2007 World Cups. World Rugby currently ranks England at 3rd out of 95 union-playing countries. They play their home games at Twickenham in Middlesex. \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" is a song associated with the national rugby union team even though it was originally sung by black slaves on the cotton fields in the south of the U.S.A. Every four years the British and Irish Lions go on tour with players from England as well as Ireland, Scotland and Wales."

        "title": "Types of tennis match",
        "text": "Traditionally, tennis is played between two people in a singles match, or two pairs in a doubles match. Tennis can also be played on different courts, including grass courts, clay courts, hard courts, and artificial grass courts.\nStandard types of match.\nSingles involves two players competing against each other, usually two men or two women, although games between a man and a woman may be played on an informal basis or as exhibitions. The game starts with one player serving the ball from the right side of the court behind the baseline. The other player must stand behind or close to the baseline on the left side of the court. The server then hits the ball over the net into the diagonally opposite service box. The receiver must let the ball bounce before hitting it back over the net. If the receiver hits the ball before one bounce or after two bounces then is called \"fault\". The game continues until one of the players fails to hit the ball over the net or hits it outside the boundaries off the court.\nDoubles is played by two teams of two players each, most often all-male or all-female. It utilizes a wider court than singles matches: it includes the area in the alley (tramlines, in British terminology), whereas singles does not. The two players on the receiving side change positions after each point played (one at the net and the other near the baseline, preparing to return serve). Most of the singles rules are applicable for doubles tennis, but there are few exceptions. First and foremost, the court side is wider. The boundaries are extended from side to side to the doubles sidelines. This includes the alleys between the singles and doubles sidelines on the court. The doubles tennis court boundaries are only in play after the ball is served. Players serve for one total game and then the serve rotates to the other team. Returners must stay on the same side of the court, known as the deuce side or ads side for the duration of the set as the server continuously switches sides after each point. \nMixed doubles is played the same as doubles, but with one man and one woman per team. This form of tennis is rare in the professional game because the men's and women's tours are organized separately (by the ATP and WTA, respectively). However, all four Grand Slam tournaments hold a mixed doubles competition, alongside the men's and women's doubles, featuring many of the same players. There is also an annual mixed tournament for national teams, the Hopman Cup, which includes mixed doubles matches. Additionally, there have been mixed doubles events at the Summer Olympics on various occasions (In 1900, from 1912 until 1920 and again since 2012).\nWhile players are gradually less competitive in singles by their late 20s and early 30s, they can still continue competitively in doubles and mixed doubles (as instanced by Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe, who won doubles titles in their 40s).\nOther types of match.\nCanadian doubles.\nWhen three players are available, modified rules can accommodate the mismatch so that the single player does not have to be significantly better than the double team. The single player hits into a doubles court while the side with two players hits into a singles court.\nAustralian doubles / American doubles.\nAn informal and unsanctioned form of tennis, this is played with similar rules to Canadian doubles, only in this version, players rotate court position after each game. As such, each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match, with the singles player always serving. Scoring styles vary, but one popular method is to assign a value of 2 points to each game, with the server taking both points by holding serve, and the doubles team each taking one if they break. Throughout the United Kingdom (particularly England) and Australia, this format is usually known as \"American doubles\", whereas in South Africa you would call it \"American singles\", or cut-throat tennis. It is also found in the Caribbean.\nWheelchair tennis.\nPlayed in both singles and doubles forms by people in wheelchairs. The main difference is that the ball may bounce twice before it is hit, the second bounce may even be outside the court. All four Grand Slam tournaments include wheelchair tennis.\nVisually impaired tennis.\nVisually impaired tennis (also known as blind tennis in Japan, its country of origin, and as sound tennis in some parts of the world) is competed in 4 types of classification where the B1 (blind) group requires players to wear a blindfold and utilizes special balls, which make a sound upon contact with the court. It usually uses a smaller court and a lower net than standard tennis; up to three bounces may be allowed before returning the ball. While sound tennis is not part of ITF, ATP, and WTA tournaments, an international tournament is held annually, and world rankings are published for male and female players with different degrees of disability.\nMini-tennis.\nThere is an evolution in tennis training that employs the use of low-compression balls and in some cases modified court sizes. Organizations around the world have begun to use lower compression balls and modified court sizes as a way to reach out to younger tennis players interested in tennis. The use of low-compression balls and modified court sizes is meant to ease the process into becoming a competitive or amateur tennis player. The low-compression balls are colored differently to indicate the level of compression. Young players and beginners are likely to find the game easier to learn because the balls do not bounce as high or travel as fast as \"normal\" balls. The modified smaller courts make covering the court, or reaching the opponent's shot, easier as well."

        "text": "Dennis Lee Rasmussen (born April 18, 1959) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the San Diego Padres (1983 and 1988–91), New York Yankees (1984–87), Cincinnati Reds (1987–88), Chicago Cubs (1992), and Kansas City Royals (1992–93 and 1995). He batted and threw left-handed.\nAmateur career.\nRasmussen was born in Los Angeles on April 18, 1959, and grew up in San Clemente, California. He nearly lost his left foot at the age of 14, when a speeding car knocked him from his bicycle on Labor Day in 1973, and the fall severed his foot, which was hanging by the Achilles tendon. An emergency room doctor said they would need to amputate, but an orthopedic surgeon was able to save the foot. As a result, he has no cartilage in his left ankle.\nRasmussen attended San Clemente High School. Six months after the injury, he recovered sufficiently to play in the final two games of the season for the junior varsity basketball team. After one year at San Clemente High School, his family moved to Boise, Idaho, and he attended Meridian High School in Meridian, Idaho, for two years. His family moved to Denver, Colorado, and he went to Bear Creek High School in Lakewood, Colorado, for his senior year. He was named All-State in baseball and basketball, and was a member of the doubles team that won the state tennis championship.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates selected Rasmussen in the 18th round of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft, but he did not sign with the Pirates. As he wanted to play college basketball, he enrolled at Creighton University, which offered him a scholarship to play for the Creighton Bluejays men's basketball team. The arrangement with Creighton also allowed him to play college baseball for the Creighton Bluejays baseball team. For the basketball team, he was a forward who played as the sixth man off the bench. For the baseball team, he had a 3–6 win–loss record and a 3.38 earned run average (ERA) with Creighton in his junior year, with 84 strikeouts, a school record, in innings pitched. He was named to the All-Missouri Valley Conference's First Team.\nProfessional career.\nThe California Angels selected Rasmussen in the first round, with the 17th overall selection, of the 1980 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Angels and made his professional debut with the Salinas Angels of the Class A California League. In 1981, he pitched for the Holyoke Millers of the Class AA Eastern League. He set a team record with 16 strikeouts on August 18. In 1981, Rasmussen pitched for the Spokane Indians of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL). He had a 11–8 record and 5.03 ERA with Spokane, and was second in the PCL with 162 strikeouts. After the 1982 season, the Angels sent Rasmussen to the New York Yankees as the player to be named later in the August 31 trade that sent Tommy John to the Angels. Rasmussen played for the Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League in 1983, leading the league with 13 wins and 187 strikeouts. The Yankees traded him to the San Diego Padres on September 12, 1983, with Edwin Rodríguez, to complete an earlier trade for John Montefusco. He made his major league debut with the Padres on September 16, and made his first start on October 1.\nOn March 30, 1984, the Padres traded Rasmussen and a player to be named later to the Yankees for Graig Nettles. He began the 1984 season with Columbus, and was promoted to the major leagues in May, earning his first major league win on May 23, his first major league start of the 1984 season. Rasmussen competed for the fifth spot in the Yankees' rotation in 1986. Though originally slated to start the season in Columbus, he was named to the Opening Day starting rotation after John was plagued by back spasms. In 1986, Rasmussen won 18 games. His batting average against of .217 was the second best in the American League. In 1987, Rasmussen had a 9–7 record and a 4.75 ERA with the Yankees before they traded him to the Cincinnati Reds for Bill Gullickson on August 27.\nRasmussen began the 1988 season pitching to a 2–6 record with a 5.75 ERA for Cincinnati. On June 8, the Reds traded Rasmussen to the Padres for Candy Sierra. He went 14–4 with a 2.55 ERA in 20 starts for the Padres, finishing the year with an overall 16–10 record and a 3.43 ERA. After the season, Rasmussen re-signed with the Padres on a two-year contract reportedly worth $1.3 million. In 1990, Rasmussen had a 11–15 record, but led the National League in home runs allowed with 28. He re-signed with the Padres for the 1991 season, receiving a $805,000 salary. He had a 6–13 record and a 3.74 ERA with San Diego in 1991.\nRasmussen signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles organization for the 1992 season, and was assigned to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He was 0–7 with a 5.67 ERA in nine starts for Rochester, and they released him on June 2. A few days later, the Chicago Cubs signed Rasmussen and assigned him to the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA American Association. The Cubs promoted him to the major leagues a week later, following an injury to Dave Smith, On July 13, the Cubs put Rasmussen on the disabled list due to tendinitis in his left shoulder, and they released him on July 21, having pitched five innings for the Cubs. The Kansas City Royals then signed Rasmussen and assigned him to the Omaha Royals of the American Association. They promoted him to the major leagues on September 10. On September 29, Rasmussen pitched a complete game one-hitter against the Angels.\nIn February 1994, Rasmussen signed a minor league contract worth $125,000 with the San Francisco Giants for the 1994 season. The Giants assigned him to the Phoenix Firebirds of the PCL. He was released on May 2 to make room for Tony Menéndez on the roster. He had a 4.20 ERA and led the team with 30 innings pitched at the time. He signed with the Royals on May 27, and was assigned to Omaha. He re-signed with the Royals for the 1995 season, and started the year with Omaha, pitching to a 6–3 record with a 2.89 ERA with Omaha before Kansas City promoted him to the major leagues on June 4. Rasmussen pitched in five games, to a 0–1 record and a 9.00 ERA, before the Royals designated him for assignment. He refused an assignment to Omaha, and was released on July 7. In 1996, he received no offers from major league teams, so he signed with the Rimini Baseball Club of the Italian Baseball League. He had a 2–1 record and a 2.30 ERA, but pulled a hamstring and returned to the United States to rehabilitate.\nCoaching career.\nWhile he was rehabilitating his pulled hamstring, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays hired Rasmussen to be their pitching coach for the Butte Copper Kings for the 1996 season. They assigned him to coach for the Charleston RiverDogs in 1997. In 1998, he was hired by the Boston Red Sox to be the pitching coach for the Lowell Spinners. Rasmussen stepped away from coaching professional baseball to spend more time with his family. He continued to coach in Little League Baseball.\nPersonal life.\nRasmussen's grandfather, Bill Brubaker, played in the major leagues with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1932-1940) and the Boston Braves (1943). Rasmussen resides in Trenton, Michigan, with his wife Renee (née Hayden). He operates Dairy Queen Grills in Trenton and Charlevoix."

        "title": "Steeplechase (horse racing)",
        "text": "A steeplechase is a distance horse race in which competitors are required to jump diverse fence and ditch obstacles. Steeplechasing is primarily conducted in Ireland (where it originated), Great Britain, Canada, United States, Australia, and France. The name is derived from early races in which orientation of the course was by reference to a church steeple, jumping fences and ditches and generally traversing the many intervening obstacles in the countryside.\nModern usage of the term \"steeplechase\" differs between countries. In Ireland and Great Britain, it refers only to races run over large, fixed obstacles, in contrast to \"hurdle\" races where the obstacles are much smaller. The collective term \"jump racing\" or \"National Hunt racing\" is used when referring to steeplechases and hurdle races collectively (although, properly speaking, National Hunt racing also includes some flat races). Elsewhere in the world, \"steeplechase\" is used to refer to any race that involves jumping obstacles.\nThe most famous steeplechase in the world is the Grand National run annually at Aintree Racecourse, in Liverpool, since its inception in 1836 (the official race was held three years later), which in 2014 offered a prize fund of £1 million.\nHistory.\nThe steeplechase originated in Ireland in the 18th century as an analogue to cross-country thoroughbred horse races which went from church steeple to church steeple, hence \"steeplechase\". The first steeplechase is said to have been the result of a wager in 1752 between Cornelius O'Callaghan and Edmund Blake, racing four miles (6.4 km) cross-country from St John's Church in Buttevant to St Mary's Church (Church of Ireland) in Doneraile, in Cork, Ireland. An account of the race was believed to have been in the library of the O'Briens of Dromoland Castle. Most of the earlier steeplechases were contested cross-country rather than on a track, and resembled English cross country as it exists today. The first recorded steeplechase over a prepared track with fences was run at Bedford in 1810, although a race had been run at Newmarket in 1794 over a mile (1600 m) with five-foot (1.5 m) bars every quarter mile (400 m). and the first recorded steeplechase of any kind in England took place in Leicestershire in 1792, when three horses raced the eight miles from Barkby Holt to Billesdon Coplow and back.\nThe first recorded hurdle race took place at Durdham Down near Bristol in 1821. There were 5 hurdles on the mile long course, and the race was run in three heats.\nThe first recognised English National Steeplechase took place on Monday 8 March 1830. The race, organised by Thomas Coleman of St Albans, was run from Bury Orchard, Harlington in Bedfordshire to the Obelisk in Wrest Park, Bedfordshire. The winner was Captain Macdowall on \"The Wonder\", owned by Lord Ranelagh, who won in a time of 16 minutes 25 seconds. Report of the event appeared in the May and July editions of \"Sporting Magazine\" in 1830.\nSteeplechasing by country.\nGreat Britain and Ireland.\nIn Great Britain and Ireland, \"steeplechase\" only refers to one branch of jump racing.\nCollectively, Great Britain and Ireland account for over 50% of all jump races worldwide, carding 4,800 races over fences in 2008. Jump racing in Great Britain and Ireland is officially known as National Hunt racing.\nFrance.\nFrench jump racing is similar to British and Irish National Hunt races, with a few notable differences. Hurdles are not collapsible, being more akin to small brush fences. Chases often have large fences called bullfinches, a large hedge up to tall that horses have to jump through rather than over. There are also a larger number of cross-country chases where horses have to jump up and down banks, gallop through water, jump over stone walls as well as jump normal chasing fences.\nUnlike in most countries where nearly all of the horses used for jump racing are thoroughbreds, many of the horses in French jump racing are AQPS (Autre Que Pur Sang), a breed of horse now known as \"French Chasers\" developed in France crossing thoroughbreds with saddle horses and other local breeds. These horses have competed and won the Grand National, the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Pardubice.\nAuteuil in Paris is the best known racecourse in France for French jump racing, with the biggest jumps, along with Pau. The Grand Steeple Grade I race is held at Auteuil in June.\nCzech Republic.\nThe Velká pardubická Steeplechase in Pardubice in the Czech Republic is the location of one of the longest steeplechase races in Europe. The first Velka Pardubice Steeplechase was held on 5 November 1874 and it has been hosted annually since.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, there are two forms of steeplechasing (or jumps racing): hurdle and timber.\nHurdle races occur almost always over the National fences, standardized plastic and steel fences that are 52 inches tall, with traditional natural fences of packed pine (Springdale Race Course in Camden, South Carolina) and live hedges (Montpelier, Virginia) in use on a few courses. National fences stand 52 inches tall at the highest point, but are mostly made of synthetic \"brush\" that can be brushed through (much like the synthetic fences now used in other countries). The hurdle horse is trained to jump in as much of a regular stride as possible. This allows the horse to maintain its speed upon landing. Since it is not always possible to meet a fence in stride, the horses are also schooled in how to jump out of stride. An out-of-stride jump can decrease a horse's speed drastically. Hurdle races are commonly run at distances of 2–3 miles (3–5 km). Hurdle races occur at steeplechase meets mainly in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast and on the turf courses of several racetracks – Saratoga, Colonial Downs, Penn National, Monmouth Park and others.\nTimber racing is conducted over solid and immovable wooden rail fences that, in the most extreme case, may reach five feet (1.5 m) high. The distances are longer, ranging from three to four miles (6 km), and the jumping effort required of the horse is much different. Because of the size of the fences and their solid and unyielding construction, a timber horse is trained to jump with an arc, unlike a hurdle racer. An important factor in success at timber racing is for the horse to land in stride, so that it can carry its speed forward on the flat part of the race course. This is harder than in hurdle races because the nature of the obstacle being jumped. If a horse hits a timber fence hard enough, it can bring it almost to a complete stop. Most notable US timber races include the Maryland Hunt Cup in Glyndon, Middleburg Spring Races in Middleburg and the Virginia Gold Cup in The Plains. Timber races currently are not held at any major US tracks (since the fences are not portable) but can be found at almost all steeplechase meets.\nAmerican jump racing happens in 11 states: Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and New York. The National Steeplechase Association is the official sanctioning body of American jump racing. \"Steeplechase Times\" newspaper covers the sport.\nThomas Hitchcock (1860–1941) is known as the father of American steeplechasing. In the late 1800s, he built a steeplechase training center on his property in Aiken, South Carolina and trained horses imported from England. No less important are the contributions by fellow Aiken seasonal resident F. Ambrose Clark. Clark held many important chases on his Brookville (Long Island) estate, Broad Hollow, in the 1920s and 1930s. Ford Conger Field was built by F. Ambrose Clark and is the site of the annual Aiken Steeplechase, a part of the Triple Crown in March. The first Steeplechase Meet in Aiken was held March 14, 1930 in Hitchcock Woods. In addition to the Aiken Steeplechase, South Carolina is also home to the Colonial Cup and the Carolina Cup, which is the largest event on the circuit. Both of these races are held in Camden, South Carolina.\nThe Virginia Gold Cup is also among the oldest steeplechase races in the United States, with its first running in 1922. Up until recently, the Gold Cup was a four-mile (6 km) long hurdle race. The length of this race prompted many jokes - such as the jockeys putting marbles in their mouth and spitting one out each lap to keep track of what lap they had completed. Since the Gold Cup moved to the present course, it has been changed into a timber race with a very large purse. Every first Saturday in May, more than 50,000 spectators gather at Great Meadow near The Plains, Virginia (45 miles (72 km) west of Washington, DC). The grass course with high timber fences is often referred to as the \"crown jewel of steeplechasing.\"\nTennessee State Historian Walter T. Durham's book \"Grasslands\" relates the history of the Southern Grasslands Hunt and Racing Foundation, a group that organized the first international steeplechase held on U.S. soil 80 years ago at Grassland Downs, a course located in Gallatin, TN between 1929 and 1932.\nIn addition to holding an inaugural race in 1930, two international steeplechases were held at Grasslands in 1930 and 1931. The winners were awarded a gold trophy designed by King Alfonso XIII of Spain.\nThe Iroquois Steeplechase event is held in Nashville, Tennessee. Beginning in 1941, with one year off during World War II, the race has been run continuously at Percy Warner Park on a course inspired by Marcellus Frost and designed by William duPont.\nThe Queens Cup Steeplechase is held annually on the last Saturday of April at Brooklandwood, a farm and estate in Mineral Springs, North Carolina, about from Charlotte.\nThe Breeders' Cup Grand National Steeplechase (formerly known as the American Grand National) is held each October at the Far Hills Races in Far Hills, New Jersey and draws about 50,000 spectators for a single day race-meet. It is the richest event in American steeplechasing with a purse of $500,000.\nDuring the 1940s and 50s, the Broad Hollow Steeplechase Handicap, the Brook National Steeplechase Handicap and the American Grand National were regarded as American steeplechasing's Triple Crown.\nKentucky Downs near Franklin, Kentucky (originally Dueling Grounds Race Course) was built in 1990 as a steeplechase track, with a kidney-shaped turf circuit. At its inception, the track offered some of the richest purses in the history of American steeplechase including a $750,000 race. The track has undergone numerous ownership changes, with steeplechase races playing an on-and-off role (mainly off) in the track's limited live race meets.\nThe Stoneybrook Steeplechase was initiated in Southern Pines, North Carolina on a private farm owned by Michael G. Walsh in 1949 and was held annually in the spring until 1996, with attendance near 20,000. It resumed as an annual spring event at the new Carolina Horse Park in 2001, but was discontinued after 2016.\nThe New York Turf Writers Cup is held each year at Saratoga Race Course, attracting the best steeplechasing horses in the U.S.\nAustralia.\nAustralia has a long history of jumps racing which was introduced by British settlers. In the late 20th century, the eastern states of Queensland and New South Wales shut down jumps racing, while Tasmania ceased jumps racing in April 2007 due to economic unfeasibility and a lack of entries.\nThe jumping season in Australia normally takes place from March until September. (some minor races are held either side of these months). Horses used for steeplechasing are primarily former flat racing horses, rather than horses specifically bred for jumping.\nThere is an emphasis on safety in Australia which has led to a reduction in the size of obstacles. As jumps races take place at flat racing meetings there is also a need for portable jumps. Most chasing occurs on steeple lanes but also includes parts of the main flat racing track. From Easter to May the major distance races occur: The Great Eastern Steeplechase is held on Easter Monday at Oakbank, South Australia drawing crowds of over 100,000, and the Grand Annual, which has the most fences of any steeplechase in the world, is held in May at Warrnambool, Victoria\nFrom the late 1800s to the 1930s the McGowan Family of Brooklyn Park South Australia, were leaders in steeplechase and hurdle racing events. Jack McGowan winning the ARC Grand National, the Oakbank Hurdle, the VRC Cup Hurdle and the Harry D Young Hurdle while his son John McGowan won a record 22 hurdle / steeplechase events in one season.\nEach state holds its own Grand National race: the most prestigious is the VRC Grand National at Flemington run in the winter. The jumping season culminates with the set-weights-and-penalties Hiskens Steeple run at Moonee Valley. The Hiskens is regarded as the Cox Plate of jumps racing.\nThe most famous Australian horse in the field was Crisp, who was narrowly beaten by the champion Red Rum in the 1973 English Grand National. Crisp subsequently beat Red Rum at set weights. Oju Chosan has won Japan's Nakayama Grand Jump five consecutive times.\nJumps racing was set to end in Victoria after the 2010 season. In September 2010, having satisfied a limit on the maximum number of deaths among starting horses, hurdle racing was granted a 3-year extension by Racing Victoria. A decision regarding steeplechase was postponed until October 2010 when a program for the 2011 season only was granted. Since 2012, both hurdle races and steeplechases have been approved by Racing Victoria.\nJapan.\nThe Nakayama Racecourse is Japan's premier steeplechase racetrack. The two most prestigious races are the Nakayama Daishogai (first held in 1934) and the Nakayama Grand Jump (held since 1999). Both races have prize money of about 140 million yen, similar to Aintree's Grand National.\nThe Hanshin Racecourse and the Kokura Racecourse also host graded steeplechase races.\nStatistics.\nNumber of jumping races by country in 2008.\nOpposition to jumps racing.\nAustralia.\nIn 2021, jumps racing in Australia was only run in Victoria and South Australia, though, contrary to common belief, only New South Wales had banned it. All six states and Australian Capital Territory have some history of jumps racing and the states that stopped conducting jumps racings were based on economic decisions. The NSW government officially shut down jumps racing in 1997 after a bill was put through linked with bird tethering, but by that stage there had not been regular jumps race meetings in NSW since World War II, when it was ceased due to the war efforts, except for a handful of exhibition events on an annual basis in the 1980s. \nOn October 1, 2021 it was announced that jumps racing will no longer be conducted in South Australia mainly due to the small number of South Australian jumps horses. There were plans to run the Great Eastern and Von Doussa Steeplechase as a flat race. However on 3rd March 2022 it was announced that would not happen. However, many jumps racing supporters attempted to keep jumps racing at Oakbank and that fight went into the South Australian court system. That resulted in an election in which the anti-jumps faction won, but debate surrounding that vote spilled into more legal action. Soon after, the South Australian government outlawed jumps racing in the state.\nJumps racing is opposed in Australia by groups including the animal rights organisations the RSPCA Australia,\nAnimals Australia,\nand Animal Liberation (South Australia),\nand by political parties such as The Greens.\nEventing.\nThe equestrian sport of eventing had a steeplechase phase, which was held in its CCI 3 Day event format. This phase is called cross country phase B when in the context of eventing. There was a roads and tracks phase, a steeplechase phase, a second, faster roads and track phase and finally the cross country jumps course. Now only the cross country jumps course remains (changes were due to space required for the additional courses and logistics). Unlike the racing form, which is far closer to the sport of hunting, the horses do not race each other over the course, but rather are required to come within a pre-set \"optimum time period.\" Penalty points are added to the competitor's score if they exceed or come in well under the optimum time. While phase B obstacles are similar to those found on actual steeplechase courses, the cross country obstacles for phase D are usually extremely varied, some being topped with brush as in steeplechasing, others being solid, others are into and out of water and others are over ditches. There are often combinations of several fences to test the horse's agility. The variety in obstacles is used to make the horse demonstrate agility, power, intelligence, and bravery. The long format was phased out at the FEI level between 2003 and 2008, but several countries continue to run long format events at the national level, including the US, Great Britain, and Canada."

        "title": "George Young (American football executive)",
        "text": "George Bernard Young (September 22, 1930 – December 8, 2001) was an American football player, coach, and executive. He served as the general manager of the New York Giants from 1979 to 1997. He was named NFL Executive of the Year five times.\nEarly life.\nYoung was born on September 22, 1930, in Baltimore, Maryland. Young grew up in Baltimore's 10th Ward (east Baltimore) in a tough Irish-Catholic neighborhood. He was an outstanding football player at Calvert Hall College, a Catholic high school then located in Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Bucknell University, where he was a starting defensive tackle for three seasons, team captain in 1951, and a member of the Phi Lambda Theta fraternity. He was named to the Little All-America first team and All-East first team in his senior year. Selected to play in the BlueGray game, he was selected by the Dallas Texans in the 1952 NFL draft.\nYoung then began a coaching career in the Baltimore area school system, briefly at Calvert Hall and then he took over the Baltimore City College football team. During a 15-year span, his teams won six Maryland Scholastic Association championships. Tom Gatewood, tight end, and John Sykes, running back, were two of Coach Young's City athletes who would make it to the NFL, Kurt Schmoke, quarterback, and Curt Anderson, linebacker, established themselves in the political realm. Young was especially proud of his years as an educator, during which he taught history and political science. During that time he also earned two master's degrees from Johns Hopkins University and Loyola College. In May 1987, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in humane letters from Western Maryland College.\nBefore being with the Giants.\nPrior to joining the Giants, Young was on the staffs of the Baltimore Colts (1968–1974), holding positions of scout, offensive line coach, director of player personnel, and offensive coordinator, and the Miami Dolphins (1975–1978), serving as director of personnel and pro scouting.\nNew York Giants.\nYoung signed a five‐year contract to become general manager of the New York Giants on February 14, 1979. He succeeded operations director Andy Robustelli, who had resigned 58 days earlier on December 18, 1978. His selection was a compromise between the team's co-owners Wellington Mara and his nephew Tim, both of whom had been feuding over the football operations since the late-1960s. Wellington's attempt to promote assistant director of football operations Terry Bledsoe and Tim's recommendation of hiring either Gil Brandt or Don Klosterman had only resulted in mutual disapproval.\nYoung joined a franchise which had failed to qualify for the postseason in its previous fifteen years. The drought was extended by the fallout over The Fumble the previous November which had been intensified by a fans revolt and cost Robustelli, head coach John McVay and offensive coordinator Bob Gibson their jobs. Wellington Mara had run the Giants' football operations himself since joining the organization in the 1930s, and continued to do so even after becoming part-owner of the team upon the death of his father, Tim, in 1958. He had ceded some of his authority to Robustelli in 1973, but continued to have the final say in football matters. The fallout from The Fumble, however, finally convinced the Maras of the need to modernize. They were thus more than willing to accede to Young's demand that he be given complete authority over the football side of the operation.\nIn building the Giants Young placed special emphasis on the NFL draft. From his inaugural draft in 1979 through the 1995 selection process, he succeeded in signing every player drafted over that span, and from those drafts, a total of 119 players made the club at one time or another. Instrumental in his reversal of the Giants’ fortunes was his drafting of standout players such as Phil Simms, Lawrence Taylor, Joe Morris, and Carl Banks, and selecting Bill Parcells as the club's head coach.\nSuccess.\nDuring Young's tenure, the Giants earned eight playoff berths, highlighted by victories in Super Bowls XXI and XXV, and compiled an overall record of 155-139-2. He was named NFL Executive of the Year a record five times: in 1984, 1986, 1990, 1993, and 1997. Young also served as chairman of the NFL's Competition Committee.\nDecline.\nDespite Young's success during the 1980s, that success would not continue into the 1990s. One of his first mistakes was his choice of a new head coach for the Giants after the May 1991 resignation of Bill Parcells. Young's selection of Ray Handley was not met with success as Handley won a total of 14 games in his two-year stint. Young—an opponent of free agency—seemed to lose his touch following the introduction of the free agency cycle following the 1992 regular season. He struggled to adapt to the system, along with the introduction of a salary cap in 1994; he signed several players to overvalued contracts while losing much of the Giants core talent to other franchises following free agency's inception.\nIn addition, Young's draft magic seemed to disappear. From 1991-1996, The Giants drafted six consecutive first round busts, although his later round selections during that time period would consist of several prominent, elite players, such as defensive tackle Keith Hamilton, defensive end Michael Strahan, cornerback Phillippi Sparks, linebacker Jessie Armstead, cornerback Jason Sehorn, fullback Charles Way, wide receiver Amani Toomer, and running back Tiki Barber. Young retired following the 1997 season, handing his duties over to assistant Ernie Accorsi.\nGeorge Young joined the National Football League as senior vice president of football operations on February 2, 1998, after serving 19 years as general manager of the New York Giants.\nYoung was a resident of Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.\nYoung died of a rare neurological disease on December 8, 2001, in Baltimore.\nHonors.\nThe George Young Award is presented annually by The National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum to the person, Jewish or non-Jewish, who \"has best exemplified the high ideals that George Young displayed\".\nOn January 15, 2020, Young was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame Centennial Class of 2020."

        "text": "The Guelph Royals name has been used for several hockey teams based in Guelph, Ontario. The most prominent was a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey Association from 1960 to 1963, that played home games at the Guelph Memorial Gardens. The junior Royals were affiliated with the NHL's New York Rangers. \nOther Guelph Royals teams played from 1908, and briefly in 1909 (6 games) in the Ontario Professional Hockey League, and also circa 1920s as Ontario Hockey Association senior teams. The Royals namesake is the City of Guelph's nickname as the \"Royal City.\"\nHistory.\nThe junior Guelph Royals arose when the Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters were sold in 1960, and the new ownership renamed the team. Emile Francis was head coach of the Royals for the 1960–61 OHA season and the 1961–62 OHA season.\nGuelph won the Hamilton Spectator Trophy during the 1960–61 OHA season, finishing 1st overall. The Royals' Rod Gilbert led the OHA in goals scored with 54, points scored with 103, and Jean Ratelle led the league in assists with 61. Gilbert won Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy with the most goals in the league, and was also awarded the Red Tilson Trophy as the most outstanding player. In the playoffs, the Royals lost in the league finals to the Toronto St. Michael's Majors, 4 games to 2 with a tie.\nMany players graduated from junior hockey after the 1960–61 OHA season, and the Royals did not recover their previous form. After two declining seasons the franchise was in financial trouble again. At the end of the 1962–63 OHA season, the team moved to nearby Kitchener, Ontario, becoming the Kitchener Rangers, taking the name of the NHL parent club.\nSome of the Guelph Royals players who graduated from the junior ranks played on the newly formed Senior OHA Guelph Regals team.\nNHL alumni.\nTwenty-one former Guelph Royals have played in the National Hockey League, and two have elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame; Rod Gilbert and Jean Ratelle.

        "title": "Spain national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Spain national rugby union team (Spanish: \" Selección de rugby de España\"), nicknamed Los Leones (\"The Lions\"), represents the Spanish Rugby Federation in men's international rugby union competitions. The team annually takes part in the European Nations Cup, the highest European rugby championship outside the Six Nations. The national side is ranked 20th in the world (as of 20 March 2023).\nRugby union in Spain dates back to 1901, although Spain did not play its first international until 1929, beating Italy 9–0 in Barcelona. Throughout the century, Spain mostly played against other European opponents such as France, Italy, Romania, West Germany, the Soviet Union, and Portugal. The team's greatest moment of success came in 1999, when Spain qualified for the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Despite being whitewashed, the team performed admirably in a group which included South Africa and Scotland.\nToday, Spain competes in the European Nations Cup against Georgia, Germany, Portugal, Romania, and Russia. Spain has never been crowned European champions, though has come close. The closest they've come to becoming European champions was in 2012, having beaten both Romania and Georgia and finishing second.\nHistory.\nEarly history and amateur era.\nThe exact starting point of rugby union in Spain is unknown; Catalan student Baldiri Aleu introduced the game from France to a mainstream Spanish audience in 1921, but the game might have been played on Spanish soil earlier. Through the 1920s, the game gradually gained popularity through universities in the country. The first Copa del Rey de Rugby was organized in 1926, and won by Barcelona. An unofficial Spanish XV played France, including Yves du Manoir, in 1927, but it was organised by a rebel governing body.\nSpain played their first \"officially recognised\" match in 1929, winning 9–0 over Italy in the Estadi Olímpic de Montjuïc. During the 1930s the Spanish rugby team played sporadically in the 1930s, playing against the national teams of Italy, Morocco, Germany, and Portugal. Due to the outbreak of World War II, rugby in much of Europe was suspended, and this included Spain. Rugby operations throughout Europe were continued in the 1950s; through this decade the Spanish struggled to the likes of West Germany, Italy and Romania. This pattern of consistency continued somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s; Spain traditionally struggled versus more established opponents such as Romania and Italy, but beat other neighboring sides such as Portugal and Morocco. However, while no official games were played between Spain and the Home Nations or the SANZAR, some Spanish sides traveled to play against various foreign sides.\nThe 1980s proved to be somewhat of a golden age for Spanish rugby; for the first time Spain played against non-FIRA competition, playing a test against both the Māori All Blacks as well as South American giants Argentina in November 1982, in Madrid. The Spanish were thrashed 66–3 to the Māori, but came close to upsetting Argentina, losing only 28 to 19. The Spanish also received Zimbabwe through various tests in the 80s. The Spanish recorded upsets, defeating Zimbabwe in Harare in 1984, winning 30–18.\nWorld Cup begins (1987–2009).\nEven more impressive, the Spanish swept a two-game tour in Zimbabwe, a team that had appeared in the 1987 Rugby World Cup, winning 28–16 and 14–9 in Bulawayo and Harare. Other notable results in this period included beating Uruguay 18–6, as well as giving scares to the sides of England and Scotland, and coming within 10 points of beating the Māori in 1988. By the end of the 80s, Spain was considered one of the best non-5 Nations teams in Europe, just barely behind Romania, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Spain officially joined the IRB in 1987, after not being invited for the 1987 Rugby World Cup, despite the USSR declining an invitation.\nThe 1990s provided a mixed fortune of both near misses and eventual success. In the 1991 qualifying rounds, Spain easily toppled its first group consisting of the Netherlands, Poland and Belgium, all games being played at home. However, Spain very narrowly missed on qualifying for the Rugby World Cup, losing 19–6 against Romania, finishing third behind Italy and Romania. In 1992, Spain finally beat Romania for the first time in 1992, winning 6–0. Spain again nearly beat Argentina that same year, only losing 43–34 in a shootout in Madrid.\n1995 began in similar fashion to the 1991 campaign, easily toppling the first group. However, Spain were unfortunately placed in a group with Wales, losing the key fixture 54–0, and again coming close, yet not close enough.\nSpain began their quest for 1999 Rugby World Cup qualification in Pool 3 of Round B of the European qualification. They won all four of their games in the round, finishing first in the group above Portugal. They, along with Portugal advanced to the next pool round with Scotland. They finished second and qualified for their first Rugby World Cup.\nFor the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Spain were in Pool A, along with Scotland, South Africa and Uruguay. Their first ever World Cup game was played against Uruguay, with Spain losing 27–15. They lost their subsequent pool games to Scotland and the Springboks by 40 points, both of which were played at Murrayfield. They failed to score a try in the tournament, the only team in the World to have qualified but not scored a try in the World cup.\nSpain began 2003 Rugby World Cup qualifying games in May 2002. Spain advanced to Round 3 after defeating Portugal. However, they lost to both Italy and Romania, and moved through to face Russia for a place in the repechage competition. Despite losing the first game in Madrid 3–36, and looking dead in the water, Spain pulled off a very unlikely victory, winning 38–22. Despite losing on aggregate, Spain went through the repechage due to Russia being disqualified for fielding ineligible players. They defeated Tunisia and moved on to face the United States. Spain lost 62–13 and 58–13, again missing out on the World Cup.\nFor the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Spain finished at the top of Pool A or Round 2 of the European qualification and advanced to Round 3 where they went into Pool A. Here they won all four fixtures to finish at the top and advance to the play-off. There they faced Germany, and although they lost the first game, they won the second and went through on a 42–28 aggregate and went into Round 4 where they defeated the Czech Republic to enter Round 5. However they lost out to Romania and Georgia in Pool B, ending their hopes of reaching the World Cup in France.\n2010–present.\nSpain missed the qualification for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand, this time struggling through their fixtures. They lost 8 of their 10 fixtures, beating only Germany those two times, and missed out on advancing to the next round of qualifying.\nSpain entered the top 20 in the IRB ranking in February 2013 for the first time following a 25–18 win over the higher ranked Georgia making headlines with semi-pro back Jack Rowland making a surprising call up, due to both fly-half and first team inside center pulling out with injury moments before the squad was announces. Rowland a last moment replacement scoring 12 out of the 25 points on his international debut. Surprising ranked Georgia first time in 29 years with a victory. Spain remained in the top 20 throughout the year, ending 2013 ranked 19th. Despite this, the 2015 campaign was similarly disastrous, winning only two of their games as well as two draws. This led to a restructure of the makeup and strategies of the FER. Spain has recently participated in the World Rugby Nations Cup and the 2014 IRB Tbilisi Cup.\nThe 2019 qualifying saw the team markedly improve; in 2017 they beat Germany, Russia and Belgium, and lost narrowly to Romania at home. The Spaniards started 2018 with great fortune, as they defeated Russia on their home soil for the first time since 2002, and defeated Romania for the first time since 2012. With both of these victories, Spain led their qualifying group and looked set for a possible qualification at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, but a controversial defeat at Belgium in the last round, and a heavy deduction of points because of fielding of ineligible players, ended their hopes.\nA similar outcome occurred in 2022 when the team initially qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup after wins over direct rivals Romania and Portugal but was later disqualified due to fielding a player who didn't meet the selection criteria. This second expulsion resulted in many veteran players abandoning the national team and the Spanish side struggled to get good results in the 2023 rugby championship campaign. With heavy defeats against Georgia and Portugal and a narrow home defeat to Romania.\nStrip.\nHistorically, Spain's kit reflected the colours of Spain; a red jersey with blue shorts deriving from the House of Bourbon. The current home kit consists of a red shirt with a triangular pattern and black on the waist sides, dark blue shorts and dark blue socks, while the away kit consists of a dark blue jersey, red waist sides, dark blue shorts and dark blue socks; previously, during the 1980s and 1990s, the Spanish team wore a yellow top as away kit.\nIn 2013, it was announced that O'Neills, one of Ireland's most notable sporting brands, would be providing the new kits for Spain. This partnership is expected to last for the rest of the decade. The team has been previously sponsored by Iberia, Orange and Renfe, and previous kit providers include Canterbury, Westport, Viator, Kondy Sport and Puma.\nCurrently, the kits are provided by Joma since 2016. Since 2017, Generali is the current sponsor.\nRecord.\nEuropean Nations Cup &amp; FIRA Trophy.\nNote: Green signifies promotion; red signifies relegation.

        "text": "Jimmy Wayne Kennedy (born November 15, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the St. Louis Rams 12th overall in the 2003 NFL draft. He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions. Kennedy was also a member of the Denver Broncos, Chicago Bears, Jacksonville Jaguars, Minnesota Vikings, and New York Giants. He won Super Bowl XLVI with the Giants against the New England Patriots.\nEarly years.\nKennedy attended Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, where he was a three-year starter on both offense and defense. Under Coach Tony DeMatteo, Kennedy earned All-American, All-city, All-conference, All-state, and team MVP honors. He also won a local High School Heisman trophy sponsored by the Downtown Athletic Club. In Kennedy's junior season, Roosevelt High was 12–0 and won the state championship. In his three years as a starter the team was 30–3. After his senior season of 1998 Kennedy played in the Governor's Bowl, in which the best prep players of New York played the best high school players in New Jersey.\nCollege career.\nA four-year starter at Penn State University, Kennedy was named the 2002 Big Ten Defensive Lineman-of-the-Year and was a two-time first-team All-Big Ten selection. A semi-finalist for the Lombardi Award, Kennedy finished his career with 213 tackles, 14 sacks, and 39 tackles-for-loss. He earned a Bachelor of Science in rehabilitation services in 2002.\nIn his freshman season, Kennedy played in 12 games, starting 6, and recorded 33 tackles and batted away 4 passes. In 2000, as a sophomore, Kennedy started all 11 games for Penn State and recorded 42 tackles and 6 sacks. As a junior, in 2001, he made 51 tackles and logged 1.5 sacks and was voted All-Big Ten for the first time.\nAs a senior in 2002, Kennedy was named a First-team All-American by \"The Sporting News\", and Walter Camp Football Foundation, \"The NFL Draft Report\", and third-team honors from the Associated Press. He recorded 87 tackles, 5.5 sacks and batted away 3 passes in 2002.\nProfessional career.\nSt. Louis Rams.\nThe 6'4\", 320 lb. defensive tackle was the first round pick (#12 overall) of the St. Louis Rams in the 2003 NFL Draft. On July 30, 2003, Kennedy signed a 5-year $9 million contract that included a $5 million signing bonus.\n With two defensive tackles, Ryan Pickett and Damione Lewis, taken in 2001, Kennedy played 13 games but did not make a start his rookie season, and made one tackle, one assist, and one pass batted.\nThe following year, Kennedy played in the final nine games of the season, starting 5 of them. During this time, he posted 16 tackles and one pass defensed. Kennedy started both postseason games where he registered nine tackles and one sack. On January 8, 2005, he recorded two tackles and one sack. He tracked down Matt Hasselbeck for a six-yard loss in the last minute of the fourth quarter of the Rams’ 27–20 win.\nBy 2005, Kennedy had earned a spot as the Rams' nose tackle, played in 15 games and started the first nine games of the season. With a chance to finally play, Kennedy made a respectable 33 tackles, 3 sacks, and one forced fumble. On September 18, 2005, he posted four tackles with two sacks on his former teammate Kurt Warner, along with first career forced fumble.\nIn 2006 Kennedy started all 16 games at nose tackle for the Rams for the first time in his career and recorded 39 tackles, one sack, one pass defensed, one forced fumble and two fumble recoveries\nDenver Broncos.\nKennedy was traded to the Denver Broncos on June 8, 2007, for a 6th round pick in the 2008 NFL draft. On September 1, 2007, the Broncos released him.\nChicago Bears.\nOn December 11, 2007 the Chicago Bears signed Kennedy and he played in the final three games of the 2007 season, making three tackles. The Bears declined to match the Jacksonville Jaguars's offer to Kennedy in the offseason.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nKennedy signed a one-year, $655,000 contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars on March 4, 2008. He played six games with the Jaguars, making 5 tackles and a sack before being waived mid-season on November 24, 2008.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nThe Minnesota Vikings signed Kennedy on December 3, 2008, to help fill the void created when Pro Bowl defensive tackles Pat Williams and Kevin Williams were suspended, but the NFL could not enforce their punishment after local judges stalled the matter indefinitely. He had a solid year as the backup in the 2009 season recording 3 sacks in limited playing time. He became a free agent at the conclusion of the 2008 and 2009 season, but was re-signed both years. On July 28, 2011, he was released.\nNew York Giants.\nThe New York Giants signed Kennedy on August 23, 2011. After recording four tackles in the first five weeks of the season, Kennedy was suspended four games for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs on October 11. He became a free agent after the season.\nPost-NFL life.\nKennedy was the subject of an article in \"The New York Times\" about racist practices at the banking firm JPMorgan Chase. In 2018, Kennedy attempted to deposit money earned from his football career at a local JPMorgan bank after talks with an employee who made a good impression on him, Ricardo Peters. Kennedy's ample wealth would have qualified him under normal circumstances as a \"private client\" who would qualify for a variety of perks. However, Peters, who is black, was fired from the bank for unclear and disputed reasons, and Kennedy's application buried. Kennedy recorded later conversations with the replacement employee at JPMorgan; in them, the new employee indicated that the regional manager was afraid of talking with a large black man like Kennedy, and that the coveted private client status was unlikely to come to Kennedy despite his large deposit. In addition, Ricardo Peters said that JPMorgan sometimes turned away black people with large savings; in one incident, Peters was directly discouraged by his boss from taking on as a client a black woman who had suddenly come into a large inheritance."

        "title": "World Series of Rock",
        "text": "The World Series of Rock was a recurring, day-long multi-act summer rock concert held at Cleveland Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio from 1974 through 1980. Belkin Productions staged these events, attracting popular hard rock bands and as many as 88,000 fans. FM rock radio station WMMS sponsored the concerts. Attendance was by general admission.\nThe World Series of Rock was known not only for its arena rock spectacle, but was also notorious for the rowdiness, rampant drug use and drunkenness of the crowd. As a result, concertgoers occasionally fell—or jumped—off the steep stadium upper deck onto the concrete seating area far below, causing serious injury. The Cleveland Free Clinic staffed aid stations in the stadium with physicians, nurses and other volunteers, and through 1977, made its treatment statistics public. From 1978, Belkin Productions conditioned its funding of the Free Clinic on the Clinic's nondisclosure of the number of Clinic staff on duty at the concerts, the nature of conditions treated, and quantity of patients treated.\nCleveland Stadium was the home field of the Cleveland Indians baseball team, so Belkin could only schedule stadium concerts for dates when the Indians were playing out of town. Stadium officials allowed seating on the playing field, which required fixing the turf before the Indians returned home. The fourth concert of 1975 was followed by heavy rain the next day, leaving the field in poor condition for the remainder of the season. Following the 1975 football season, groundskeepers completely resurfaced the field, and installed a drainage system, to repair damage from the rock concerts. The first concert of 1976 was scheduled for July 11 with Aerosmith, Todd Rundgren's Utopia, Jeff Beck (with the Jan Hammer Group) and Derringer. However, the concert was canceled after stadium officials refused to allow seating on the field to prevent damage to the new turf and Aerosmith would not play without fans on the field. No concerts took place at Cleveland Stadium in 1976 though Belkin resumed the series in 1977 after stadium groundskeepers employed a field-covering system consisting of plywood and outdoor carpeting.\nThe third concert of the 1978 season featuring Fleetwood Mac, originally scheduled for August 5, had to be canceled at the last minute due to a sudden illness suffered by Lindsey Buckingham. The rest of the band, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks, flew to Cleveland to hold a press conference to explain the cancellation. The concert was rescheduled for August 26, forcing the cancellation of the fourth World Series of Rock featuring Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, Todd Rundgren and Utopia, Blue Öyster Cult and the Cars that was originally scheduled for that date.\nViolence outside the stadium marred the July 28, 1979 concert. There were five shootings (including one fatality), dozens of robberies and numerous incidents of violence around the stadium in the early morning hours before the concert, where thousands of fans waited overnight. The next concert featuring Foreigner, Kansas, the Cars, the Tubes, David Johansen and Breathless was originally slated for Sunday, August 19, 1979. At the request of city officials, the concert was rescheduled to Saturday night at 8:00 pm for security reasons, but after receiving many complaints from parents about the late ending time, Belkin canceled the concert. Afterwards, Art Modell, the head of Stadium Corp., stated there would be no more World Series of Rock concerts held at the stadium.\nOne final World Series of Rock concert, headlined by Bob Seger, took place on July 19, 1980. The ticket price was $12.50 ().\nCleveland Stadium was demolished in 1996, and replaced with FirstEnergy Stadium built on the same site. County Stadium in Milwaukee, Wisconsin staged its own series of rock festivals, also called the World Series of Rock, in the early 1980s. Since then, \"World Series of Rock\" has become a generic term for multi-act concerts.\nConcert lineups.\nJune 23, 1974\nAugust 4, 1974\nAugust 31, 1974\nMay 31, 1975\nJune 14, 1975\nJuly 11, 1975\nAugust 23, 1975\nJune 5, 1977\nJune 25, 1977\nAugust 6, 1977\nJuly 1, 1978\nJuly 15, 1978\nAugust 26, 1978\nJuly 28, 1979\nJuly 19, 1980\nExternal links.\nMurray Saul and Shelly Stile of WMMS open a World Series of Rock show in 1975 , retrieved from www.youtube.com on August 10, 2008.\nAC/DC perform at World Series of Rock concert of July 28, 1979 , retrieved from www.youtube.com on March 29, 2009.\nBiography of Mike Belkin, principal of Belkin Productions.

        "text": "The T202 Baseball cards, also known as the Hassan Triple Folder were baseball cards manufactured and distributed by the American Tobacco Company in 1912. The cards were inserted into packs of \"Hassan Cork Tip Cigarettes\". Several characteristics make this vintage card a standout amongst other forms of tobacco advertising of the time and lend to its value as a highly sought-after collectible.\nThis set was a step further in comparison with another American Tobacco release, the T201 set of 1911, that had featured two players on the same card.\nOverview.\nThe cards were quite large in comparison to the T205 (1911) and T206 (1909 to 1911) cards from the same time period. The T202 was designed as a triptych or as it is referred to in the baseball card collecting hobby a triple folder. Each of the end panels displayed an individual player in color, while the center panel contained a black-and-white photo of \"live action\" baseball players. To insert the card into packs of cigarettes the two end panels were folded over the center panel. When the card is fully extended it measures 5\" wide by 2\" high.\nThe T202 set consisted of 132 total cards with numerous combinations of end panels and center panels. Prominent players of the time who appeared on the most end and center panel combinations were Christy Mathewson, who appeared on ten different cards all on end panels, and Ty Cobb, who appeared on a combination of over six different cards including end and center panels.\nCard backs include biographies for the players and a text describing the live-action scene on the middle. All of those text also featured a \"Hassan Cigarettes\" advertising below. Some of the players featured on the end panels also appeared on the middle action, but not always. Both leagues, American and National, also featured different card designs.\nValue.\nAccording to several recent sales on Ebay, the common T202 that is rated a PSA 5 or better will cost at least $200. Cards that have at least one Hall of Fame player highlighted in any of the three pictures, that are rated a PSA 5 or better will cost at least $250. Some Hall of Famers command higher prices than others, but Ty Cobb generally commands the most money. A Cobb in PSA 5 condition will cost at least $1500 as of 2019. There is an unusual rarity in this set, however. The Lord Catches His Man card, previously considered a common card worth around $100, has dramatically increased in price, due to the speculation that the center picture of the card may be Shoeless Joe Jackson. The theory seems to be backed up by a photo taken in a newspaper from the same year the card came out. The photo and the card appear to match. If the center panel is, in fact, Shoeless Joe Jackson, it will most likely easily be the most valuable card in the set, as he does not appear in any other card."

        "title": "Cycling in the Netherlands",
        "text": "Cycling is the second-most common mode of transport in the Netherlands, with 36% of Dutch people listing the bicycle as their most frequent way of getting around on a typical day, as opposed to the car (45%) and public transport (11%). Cycling has a modal share of 27% of all trips (urban and rural) nationwide. In cities this is even higher, such as Amsterdam which has 38%, and Zwolle 46%. This high frequency of bicycle travel is enabled by excellent cycling infrastructure such as cycle paths, cycle tracks, protected intersections, ample bicycle parking and by making cycling routes shorter and more direct (and therefore usually quicker) than car routes.\nIn the countryside, a growing number of routes connect the Netherlands' villages, towns and cities: some of these paths are part of the Dutch National Cycle Network, a network of routes for bicycle tourism which reaches all corners of the nation.\nHistory.\nCycling became popular in the Netherlands a little later than it did in the United States and Britain, which experienced their bike booms in the 1880s, but by the 1890s the Dutch were already building dedicated paths for cyclists. By 1911, the Dutch owned more bicycles \"per capita\" than any other country in Europe.\nThe ownership and use of bicycles continued to increase and in 1940 there were around four million bicycles in a population of eight million. Half of these bicycles disappeared during the German occupation, but after the war the use of bicycles quickly returned to normal and continued at a high level until 1960 (annual distance covered by bicycle for each inhabitant: 1500 km). Then, much like it had in other developed nations, the privately owned motor car became more affordable and therefore more commonly in use and bicycles as a result less popular. That is: ownership still remained high, but use fell to around 800 km annually. Even so, the number of Dutch people cycling was very high compared to other European nations.\nThe trend away from the bicycle and towards motorised transport only began to decrease in the 1970s when Dutch people took to the streets to protest against the high number of child deaths on the roads: in some years over 500 children were killed in collisions with motor vehicles. This protest movement, initiated by Maartje van Putten (later an MEP), was known as the \"Stop de Kindermoord\" (\"Stop the Child Murder\").\n The success of this movement—along with other factors, such as the oil shortages of 1973–74 and the publication of the CROW Design Manual for Bicycle Traffic—turned government policy around. The country began to restrict urban motor vehicle use and direct its focus on growth towards other forms of transport, with the bicycle perceived as critical in making streets safer and towns and cities more people-friendly and livable.\nOverview.\nBesides the history and social movements, there is no single reason as to why cycling remains so popular in the Netherlands: many bicycle friendly factors reinforce each other:\nThese factors together far outweigh the negative factors of wet and windy weather, strong winds due to the flat terrain, and frequent bicycle thefts. Over a quarter of all journeys made in the Netherlands are by bicycle. Even the over 65 age group make nearly a quarter of their journeys by bicycle—though, among this age group, electric bikes are very popular. In some cities over half of all journeys are made by bicycle.\nBy 2012 cycling had grown tremendously in popularity. In Amsterdam alone, 490,000 cyclists took to the road to cycle 2 million kilometres every day, according to its city council statistics. This has caused some problems as, despite 35,000 kilometers of bicycle paths, the country's 18 million bicycles (1.3 per citizen old enough to ride) sometimes clog Dutch cities' busiest streets. This is being addressed by building even more bike lanes to tackle a problem many other cities in the world would envy—that of \"bicycle traffic congestion\". The Netherlands' busiest cycleway, Vredenburg in the city of Utrecht, sees some 32,000 cyclists on an average weekday, and up to 37,000 on peak days, rivalling the numbers claimed for the busiest cycleway in the world in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nIn 2011 cycling advocate David Hembrow argued that the Dutch make more cycle journeys between them than the American, British and Australian people added together, and with greater safety than cyclists in any of those countries.\nIn 2012, the Dutch \"Fietsersbond\" (Cyclists' Union) said that a quarter of all deadly crashes in the Netherlands involve cyclists. Research in 2013 showed that 60% of fatal cycling accidents took place at junctions and in two out of five of those accidents, cyclists were not given priority by the driver. From 2007 to 2012, the number of fatal accidents decreased in the Netherlands from 850 to 600, while the number of cycling fatalities remained roughly constant. In 2015, cycling deaths made up 30% of road deaths in the Netherlands, 185 out of 621.\nInfrastructure.\nMany roads have one or two separate cycleways alongside them, or cycle lanes marked on the road. On roads where adjacent bike paths or cycle tracks exist, the use of these facilities is compulsory, and cycling on the main carriageway is not permitted. Some 35,000 km of cycle-track has been physically segregated from motor traffic, equal to a quarter of the country's entire 140,000 km road network. On other roads and streets, bicycle and motor vehicles share the same road-space, but these are usually roads with a low speed limit. The surface quality of these bike lanes are good and the routing tends to be direct with gentle turns making it possible to cycle at good speeds for considerable distances. Cycleways come with their own sets of rules and systems—including traffic signals/lights, tunnels and lanes.\nTunnels and bridges may or may not be accessible for cycling; if pedal cycles are prohibited, there is usually a separate facility. For example, the Western Scheldt Tunnel is not accessible for pedestrians, cyclists or moped riders. They have to use the ferry at another location, or take the bus through the tunnel. Unlike the vast majority of bus services in the Netherlands, three services that cross this tunnel carry bicycles and mopeds. There is a fee for this service and reservation is recommended.\nPedestrians use the pavement where one is available, otherwise they use the same position on the road as the cyclists: on the cycleway or lane if available, otherwise on the road (but in the latter case pedestrians preferably walk on the left, while cyclists go on the right). Roads and tunnels accessible for cyclists are also accessible for pedestrians. Most pedestrian paths are available to cyclists who dismount and walk the bike.\nSeparate bike paths, parallel to the roadway.\nWhen enough space is available, larger roads are fitted with a parallel \"fietspad\" (bike path) that is physically separated—for example by means of a verge, hedge, or parking lane—from the roadway. In most cases, these bike paths are also physically separated from an adjacent footpath.\nWhere protected bike paths exist, their use is in most cases obligatory for cyclists. Mopeds, mofas and the like are allowed and obliged to use them when their maximum speed is no more than 25 km/h (with a blue license plate) (though this has become controversial). When the maximum speed is 45 km/h (yellow license plate), mopeds are only allowed to use the cycle paths if that is indicated (mostly outside of the built-up area). Motorists are not allowed on bike paths, and to enforce this the entry of cars is often made physically impossible by using obstacles. In any case, a single-directional bike path is usually too narrow for cars to travel on.\n\"Bi-directional bike paths\" on one side of the road are common in towns as well as in the countryside: they are divided into two lanes, similar to roads, by a dashed line. Occasionally bi-directional cycle ways exist on \"both sides\" of the road; this reduces the number of times cyclists have to cross the road.\nThe color of the pavement on a bike lane or path may vary, though red is the standard color to identify bike paths and on-road bike lanes in the Netherlands: either red asphalt or brickwork is used to visually distinguish cycle ways from car lanes and footpaths. Standard black asphalt is also commonly used and some older cycle paths are made of the square tiles commonly used for sidewalks.\nOn-road bike lanes.\nOn-road bike lanes in the Netherlands are marked by either a dashed line or a solid line: lanes marked by a dashed line may be used by motorists provided that they do not impede cyclists, while those marked with a solid line may not be used by motorists. Solid lines are interrupted on crossings to allow motorists to enter or leave the road. Car parking is never allowed in either type of lane.\nBike lanes are usually surfaced with red or black asphalt. The red colour has no legal meaning, it is there for visibility; the on-road bike lane is delineated by the solid or dashed line by which it is separated from the roadway.\nNational guidelines advise a minimum width of 1.25 m for cycle lanes.\nWhen a cycle lane is present on a road, cyclists are obliged to use it. Since 15 December 1999 mopeds are not allowed on cycle lanes.\n\" (cycle street).\nA \" (cycle street) is a road where bicycles are considered to be the primary and preferred form of transport and where cars and other motorised vehicles are allowed \"as guests\". Designs vary, but most examples incorporate red asphalt and have a speed limit of 30 km/h.\n' streets exist mostly in residential areas where low-traffic roads exist anyway. A ' was in most cases originally a road that had low-traffic volumes beforehand and was therefore easily converted. They are an important type of infrastructure which makes Dutch towns and cities safer for cyclists. They can also be used for \"route separation\" to enable cyclists to avoid busier roads and have direct routes into and through towns.\nThe unravelling of modes.\nIn Dutch towns and cities, many bike-only routes are not alongside the roadway, nor do they run close by and parallel to major car routes: rather, cycle routes are often completely separate from motor vehicle routes. In many cases, dedicated bike routes are far more direct than the local car routes are to common destinations, such as town centres. This complete separation of bicycle routes from motor vehicle routes is called the \"unravelling of modes\" and is an important feature of modern Dutch urban design and traffic management.\nFor instance, many Dutch towns and cities have a \"soft\" green core that is only accessible to cyclists and pedestrians. Therefore, while drivers wishing to cross the town may have to take a lengthy detour via a ring road, cyclists can take a direct route through the town centre.\nOther cycle routes work similarly. On a small scale, short sections of cycle path can provide a short cut between streets that cars cannot take, while on a larger scale entire streets are sometimes converted to cycle paths to provide more room for cyclists and discourage the use of motorized vehicles.\nFree-running cycle paths also exist for recreational purposes, in parks and in the countryside. These are usually bidirectional.\nCountryside.\nOn busy and important routes, cycling facilities in the countryside are similar to those in the cities. Cycle paths are made where possible, and cycle lanes otherwise. If the available space is too limited even for a cycle lane, for example when a road passes through a village, speed-reducing measures are usually taken to ensure that the difference in speed between cyclists and motorists is tolerable.\nHighways and \"provincial roads\" (main roads for which a province is responsible), are usually fitted with separate cycle paths. Motorways, on the other hand, rarely have cycling facilities associated with them. If a cycle path is bundled with a motorway it usually lies at a relatively large distance from the road, outside the traffic barriers and noise barriers.\nApart from these utility paths and lanes, many recreational paths are available in the countryside. Their pavement varies from gravel through asphalt. Crushed seashells are a popular variant.\n\"\" (Fast bike routes).\nA bicycle-only route intended for cycling longer distances for practical reasons such as commuting or for sport and exercise can either be called a ' (fast bike route) or a ' (cycle highway). Some characteristics of these cycling routes mentioned by governments (both national and local) and traffic experts are bi-directional paths with recommended uni-directional lane widths of 2 metres and minimum widths of 1.5 metres; very level and straight stretches (i.e. few ups and downs, curves or turns); the absence of traffic lights and level crossings with motorised traffic; and superior pavement quality.\nCycling interest groups and national and local governments advocate such routes as being a solution for the further reduction of vehicular traffic congestion: this is because, as cyclists can achieve higher average speeds on these routes than on the usual types of cycling infrastructure, so cyclists are better able to compete with the car for longer commutes on them.\n, cycle highways currently being constructed include one between Rotterdam and Delft, and one between Nijmegen and Arnhem (the RijnWaalpad). Most fast-cycling routes/cycle highway projects are not entirely purpose-built, but consist of upgrading existing infrastructure and adding missing links between them.\nRoundabouts.\nSome roundabouts have cyclist lanes around them, with signposts directing the cyclist to a destination. Traffic on roundabouts in the Netherlands usually has priority over entering traffic, and when a cycle lane is bundled with it this priority also applies to the cyclists. This means that cars have to give priority to bicycles both when entering and exiting the roundabout.\nOther roundabouts have separate cycle paths around them. Signs indicate whether the cycle path or the crossing road has priority. Many authorities give priority to the crossing roads, as this is thought to be safer. For fairness, others retain the priority that the cyclists would have had if they had not been using a separate cycle path (which they are obliged to use).\nA very busy roundabout in Eindhoven uses tunnels and an interior roundabout for cyclists to keep the two traffic streams completely apart.\nThe Hovenring.\nThe Hovenring is an architectural first for bicycle infrastructure. Opening on 29 June 2012, it is an elevated circular suspension bridge and bicycle-only roundabout built in between the localities of Eindhoven, Veldhoven and Meerhoven (thus the name, being Dutch for \"Ring of the 'Hovens'\") in the province of North Brabant. Built over a large and busy road intersection, where before its construction cyclists had to cross busy roads, it is the first suspended bicycle roundabout in the world.\nCrossing rivers and motorways.\nTo protect cyclists from motorised traffic when they need to cross motorways and other busy roads, dedicated cycling bridges and tunnels for cyclists are built. Such facilities are often shared with pedestrians.\nThe small waterways such as canals, which abound especially throughout western Holland, will often have dedicated bridges for cyclists or ones that they share with pedestrians. However, to cross large waterways, cycle paths are often situated alongside roads (for instance the Hollandse Brug) or sometimes railroads (for example the Nijmegen railway bridge). Long road tunnels are rarely open to cyclists.\nWhen roads and railroads are too far away, ferries often provide an alternative in the Netherlands. In many cases, ferries operate exclusively or primarily for cyclists and to a lesser extent for pedestrians.\nTraffic signals.\nBecause of their constant use, cycleways are complete with their own system of traffic signals. These are present at junctions, one set for motorised vehicles and a visually smaller set for cyclists. Sometimes this is similar to a pelican crossing, where the cyclists wait to cross the junction. These lights come in two forms—firstly the miniature version of the vehicle lights and secondly a regular sized signal with bicycle-shaped cutouts.\nIn many locations more direct cycle routes exist which bypass traffic signals, allowing cyclists to make more efficient journeys than motorists.\nOccasionally, cyclists are explicitly allowed to pass a red traffic light if they make a right turn on an intersection. They are also allowed to ignore a red light if they go through the top of a T junction on a cycle path, as there is never interaction between motorists and cyclists, and cyclists can negotiate easily with other cyclists and pedestrians.\nSignage.\nSignposts take on the form of road signs, with directions stating the distances to nearby cities and towns. Signposts come in two different forms: the common directional signpost which is a miniature version of the vehicle signs and padstool signs, mushroom-shaped direction posts. Padstools are used in the countryside where it is thought to blend in better with its surroundings. Sometimes it can be hard to notice in long grass.\nIn contrast to the signposts for traffic in general, which feature white lettering on a blue background, the signposts for cyclists have red or green lettering on a white background. Red is used for the usual route and green for more scenic routes where mopeds are not allowed. The mushroom-style signpost can also have black lettering on a white background (as it is obvious that it is not meant for motorists). A newer style of \"mushroom\" has red lettering.\nWhen a general (white on blue) signpost is not applicable for cyclists because it relies on a motorway, this is indicated with a small car sign or a motorway sign behind the name of the destination. In such cases, a separate signpost for cyclists is usually nearby.\nMost road signs for cyclists that are used in the Netherlands are universal. However, some are specific to the country and may even include some Dutch text, e.g. \"fietspad\" (cycle path), \"racer te gast\" (racers (road cyclists) are guests), \"(brom)fietsers oversteken\" (cyclists and moped riders must cross the road), \"uitgezonderd fietsers\" (except for cyclists) or \"rechtsaf fietsers vrij\" (turning right free for cyclists).\nThe numbered-node cycle network was first introduced in the Netherlands in 1999, and by 2014, the entire Netherlands was part to the network. The system is displacing more traditional national cycling route network signage (long, named routes, each individually signposted, called LF routes in the Netherlands). In 2017–2021, the Netherlands reduced its LF-routes, amalgamating some of them. The ways themselves remained part of the numbered-node network.\nParking.\nBy policy in the Netherlands, bicycle parking is supposed to be provided next to every shop. Bicycle stands are common around the Netherlands, an alternative to chaining the bike to a post. In most, the front wheel of the bicycle rests on the stand. As bike theft is very common in the Netherlands, cyclists are advised to lock their bicycle with a built-in lock and attach a chain from the bike frame to the stand.\nThere are many bicycle parking stations, particularly in city centres and at train stations, some of which hold many thousands of bicycles. Every railway station has a cycle parking attached, and most also offer guarded cycle parking for a nominal fee. Since the start of the 21st century, parking spaces for 450,000 bicycles were built and modernized at over 400 train stations, and Dutch railways organizations ProRail and NS are calling for expansion by another 250,000 by 2027. Already half of all Dutch train travellers cycle to the station, amounting to half a million cyclists daily. These types of bicycle parking stations also exist in other places around most cities, for example, there are 20 watched bicycle parking stations situated in the city of Groningen (population ≈198,000).\nMost city councils enforce the parking of bicycles in their jurisdictions by regularly removing any bicycles that are not placed in the bike stands. The locks are cut and for the owner to reclaim their bicycle they must pay a fine of around €25. Cyclist journeys are made more convenient by such actions as it prevents sidewalks being littered with bikes.\nBike rental.\nBikes for all ages are readily available for rent across the country and most large towns have bike shops with all the necessary equipment and repair services. All cities possess multiple bike stands, mainly at the supermarkets and other commonly used shops. Bikes should also come with a lock so as to keep the bike from being stolen. A national scheme, Cycleswap, supports small businesses privately renting bicycles out for short-term use.\n\"OV-fiets\".\n\"OV-fiets\" (literally: \"Public Transport bicycle\") is the name of a very large, nationwide bicycle rental / sharing system run by \"Nederlandse Spoorwegen\" aka \"NS\" (Dutch Railways)—by far the Netherlands' largest rail service operator. Almost 15,000 \"OV-fietsen\" are offered for rent at over 300 locations across the Netherlands; at many train stations, at bus or tram stops, in several city centres and at P+R car parks. When you arrive at a town's station by train, you can quickly rent an OV-fiets to cycle to your destination.\nThe \"OV-fiets\" program, which started on a small scale in 2003, has steadily grown in popularity, first registering 1 million rides in 2011, but Dutch Rail expected 3 million rides in 2017, up 25% from 2.4 million in 2016. However, this was even exceeded—the number came out at 3.2 million.\nIn recent years Dutch Rail expanded their rental fleet by around 1000 bicycles a year to keep up with demand. However, a surge in demand forced NS to rush order an extra 6000 bicycles in 2017. The company aimed to have 14,500 bicycles available by the end of 2017.\nMembership to the \"OV-fiets\" scheme is required, but as of 1 January 2017 only costs €0.01 per year, to verify identity and payment data. Bikes can be accessed using the normal NS public transport card—and 24-hour rental costs €3.85. Since the new policy is in place, the number of registered users has jumped from ≈200,000 to ≈500,000.\nThe nature of the \"OV-fiets\" bike sharing program differs somewhat from that of similar schemes in other countries, partly because of the already high bike ownership of the population. The Dutch system is highly integrated with the public transport network, so that people who cycle to the station in their place of origin can\ncontinue traveling by bike from the station of their destination.\nSwapfiets.\nSwapfiets is a bike rental service for residents of several European countries that, for a fixed monthly price, provides a bicycle and covers all repair costs.\nThe service started as a startup that rented refurbished bikes but has since developed an in-house design featuring a distinctive blue front tire.\nBicycle touring.\nFor bicycle touring, all Dutch cities can be accessed on the dedicated cycling routes. There are two main signage systems, the older named-route Dutch National Cycle Network—the \"LF-routes\"—and the numbered-node cycle network or network. There are also additional regional cycle paths. Some of the LF routes have been amalgamated and removed in 2017–2021, and may not be shown accurately on older maps; the former LF routes are now part of the network, which is displacing named long-distance routes in Belgium and the Netherlands. An average cyclist can typically expect to cover between 15 and 18 kilometres, on average, in an hour by bike throughout most areas of the Netherlands.\nPrint cycling maps are widely available and come in two forms:\nThere are also comprehensive digital maps and route planning tools in a variety of languages, available online or in downloadable apps. OpenStreetMap, a Wikipedia-style map, has extensive information on the numbered-node network, available as downloadable maps and datasets under the Open Database License.\nThough the LF-route network is the national cycling route network of the Netherlands, some of its routes extend into the neighbouring countries of Belgium and Germany; the LF1 even extends all the way down the North Sea coast to Boulogne-sur-Mer in France.\nThere is also a professional cycle-tour industry in the Netherlands, run by professional cycling-tour operators.\nTransporting bicycles.\nIt is possible to take bicycles on trains, aircraft and ferries. Buses, however, will only carry folded bicycles.\nTrains.\nBicycles may be carried on trains under certain conditions. Folding bicycles can be taken more easily than other types as regular bicycles must be placed in designated areas. Taking a folded bicycle inside a train is free, but for unfolded bicycles and regular ones a special ticket is required. , these tickets cost €7.50 per bicycle and are valid for a whole day. In all trains it is prohibited to carry normal size and (partly) unfolded bikes during peak hours, though this restriction does not apply in the summer in July and August when bikes can be carried for free at any time. All bicycles are allowed, even a recumbent or a tandem. However, it is prohibited to take a tricycle or a bicycle trailer on trains.\nTravellers are expected to place their bicycles in the designated areas: blue stickers on or near the doors indicate where they are.\nFerries.\nFerries are commonplace in the Netherlands for crossing both rivers and canals, including numerous foot ferries that operate especially for cyclists and foot passengers saving them from making long detours. There are ferries as well as to the islands in the North (Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog). It is important to know where ferries are and when they run.\nSome ferries (such as those to Texel,\nVlieland, Terschelling, Ameland\nand Schiermonnikoog) impose an extra charge for bicycles, while others (such as those across the IJ in Amsterdam) carry bicycles for free.\nBy air.\nIt is possible to take bicycles by air, but the airline's procedures must be followed to pack the bicycle and possibly dismantle it. There may also be extra fees as the bicycle will count as luggage. Again, travelling with a foldable bike is easier.\nThe \"Fietsstad\" (Bicycle city) awards.\nEvery few years, a jury from the Dutch \"Fietsersbond\" (Cyclists' Union) conducts the \"Fietsstad\" awards where a city is bestowed the honour of being a recognised \"Fietsstad\" (Bicycle City). The main criteria for winning is not which of the competing cities has the best overall cycling environment but rather which city is already great for cycling and has improved their cycling environment even further. Furthermore, in some years there is a unique \"theme\" that the jury use to decide the winner.\n the cities that have been elected \"Fietsstad\" are:"

Hall gained his 50th cap playing for Southland against Tasman on 16 September 2006. He still occasionally plays Number 8 for the Stags due to Jason Rutledge having recently cemented the hooker role for both the Stags and for the Highlanders in Super Rugby.\nIt was announced Hall would play his 2012 NPC rugby for the Northland Taniwha at the opposite end of the country.\nKnee reconstruction.\nHe was forced out of the 2010 Super 14 season with a knee injury sustained in the 2009 Ranfurly Shield Win against Canterbury. His knee was later reconstructed and along with a shoulder operation the rehabilitation process was expected to take up to nine months.\nWrights Bush revival.\nDuring his long injury period Hall will attempt to help re-establish the Wrights Bush Rugby Club where he played most of his junior rugby. They will enter a senior team for the first time since 1995 and he is expected to assist with the coaching duties.\nLater rugby career.\nHall played in his last NPC game for Southland on 10 October 2015 in a 39–20 loss against Canterbury at AMI Stadium coming off the bench as a substitute.

Although Freeman failed to equal the record of 27 home runs set by Ned Williamson in the season, his total is generally regarded as the greater achievement owing to the dimensions of Williamson's home ballpark of Lakeshore Park – Only two of the 27 homers batted by Williamson for the Chicago White Stockings were scored away from home. Freeman's tally was not surpassed until , when Babe Ruth belted 29 home runs for the Boston Red Sox.\nFollowing the season, the Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Spiders, Louisville Colonels and Washington Senators were all dropped by the National League, as a cost-cutting measure, reducing the number of teams to eight for the season; while Louisville would never sport another major-league level team, the other three cities received charter franchises in the rival American League in 1901 – after being abandoned by the AL in 1971, the National League would return to the nation's capital 106 years later.

In that match they made the highest successful run-chase in the final of the Ranji Trophy.\nIt is in the Elite Group of the Ranji Trophy although it has had very little success. There have, however, been many cricketers that have passed through its ranks and gone on to play for the Indian cricket team. It falls under the West Zone in the Duleep Trophy.\nHistory.\nGujarat's first appearance in a Ranji Trophy final came in the season of 1950–51, where it was facing Holkar in the Ranji Trophy Final. Holkar won the high-scoring match by 189 runs, the match featured a double century by Holkar's Chandu Sarwate and a fighting 152 by Gujarati off-spinner Jasu Patel (who averaged 21.70 in 87 innings).\nIn 2007–08, Gujarat won their maiden Ranji Trophy Plate League title by defeating Railways. Gujarat were in a lose-win situation and six and four and out they lost.\nIn the year 2010/11, Gujarat made a wonderful start to the Ranji Season. They went for a draw against Bengal and later on made an outright win against a strong Delhi Team but lost two consecutive matches against Madhya Pradesh and Baroda which ended their hope of entering Quarter Final Stage.\nThey drew a high scoring match against Tamil Nadu, which featured the comeback of Parthiv Patel (as he was busy in national duty) but lost the match against Haryana which forced them to go back at the Plate League.\nGujarat won the Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy in 2012–13 defeating Punjab in the final by four wickets with 13 deliveries to spare.\nGujarat's best appearance in a Ranji Trophy final came in the season of 2016–17, where it was facing Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy final in Indore. Parthiv Patel scored a precious century (143, 196b, 24 x 4s) and scripted a most memorable maiden Ranji Trophy victory at the Holkar Stadium.

        "text": "Deck tennis is a sport that is played by mariners on the decks of both cargo and passenger vessels. The sport is a hybrid between tennis and quoits, and is played with either the rubber disk or ring, or a similarly-sized rope ring. The sport has been standardized and formalized in several countries under names such as \"tennikoit\" or \"ring tennis\".\nAmerican sources from the 1930s and 1940s attribute the origin, or at least formal establishment of the game, to Cleve F. Schaffer. In 1981, Mariano Herrera and Alejandro Nougues from Argentina won the first and only Deck Tennis World Championship celebrated on the beach in Punta del Este, Uruguay.\nRules.\nMost games of deck tennis, unlike the official tennikoit form, are informal and without set rules or a governing body, so rules tend to vary. Usually it is played on a court roughly 40 to 50 feet (11 to 14 m) long and 15 to 20 feet (5 to 7 m) wide and may be played as either as singles or doubles. The midcourt net is usually the height, or higher than that of a tennis net. The goal of the game is to serve (throw) the ring into the opponent's court, and the opponent tries to catch it before it falls and immediately throw it back from the same position where it was caught, with a point being scored when the server managed to land a quoit on the opponent's side of the court.\nThe scoring system is commonly the same as regular tennis: Love, 15, 30, 40, Deuce, Advantage, Game. This is in contrast with tennikoit, where sets are played to 21 individual points, similar to badminton.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 1936 film \"Piccadilly Jim\", Robert Montgomery as \"Piccadilly Jim\" is depicted playing the game with his romantic rival in the film Ralph Forbes as \"Lord Frederick Priory\" on the deck of an ocean liner. \nIn Roald Dahl's autobiography, \"Boy: Tales of Childhood\" (1984), he describes a game of deck tennis that he played.

        "text": "The 52nd International 500 Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Thursday May 30, 1968. For the second year in a row, one of Andy Granatelli's STP Turbine-powered machines was leading late in the race, but once again, it failed within sight of victory.\nOn lap 174, Lloyd Ruby's engine misfired allowing Joe Leonard to take the lead in the Lotus 56 Turbine. Leonard, however, suffered a flameout on the lap 191 restart, and rolled to a silent and shocking halt. Bobby Unser in the venerable piston-powered Offenhauser, inherited the lead, and despite gear linkage trouble, won the first of his three Indy 500 victories (1968, 1975, 1981).\nThis was the final Indianapolis 500 to feature a front-engined car in the starting field. Of the 33 cars, 32 were rear-engined machines (including three turbines). Jim Hurtubise's entry, which dropped out after only nine laps, was the last front-engine car to race in the 500. This was also the first 500 won by a turbocharged engine.\nDuring the month, film crews were on hand to film various action shots and stock footage of the race proceedings to be used in the 1969 film \"Winning\", starring Paul Newman.\nWith of precipitation in the Indianapolis area in May, the 1968 race featured the wettest month on record for the Indy 500. Rain hampered practice and qualifying, but did not affect race day.\nThis was the most recent Indy 500 scheduled for Thursday; the Uniform Monday Holiday Act was implemented in 1971 and Memorial Day became a three-day weekend (Saturday–Monday) every year. A day previously avoided, Sunday became the scheduled race day beginning in 1974.\nRace schedule.\nTime trials was scheduled for four days, but for the first time under the current schedule format, qualifying was carried over into a fifth day. Most of Bump Day (May 26) was rained out, and the track closed due to darkness with the field not yet filled to 33 cars. A special session was held Monday in order to complete the field.\nPractice and time trials.\nThe 1968 Indianapolis 500 was the second and ultimately the final year of participation by the controversial STP Granatelli Turbine machines. For 1968, the Pratt &amp; Whitney turbine engine was installed in the Lotus 56 chassis, often known colloquially as the \"Wedge Turbine,\" and sometimes affectionately as the \"Doorstop.\" In a veiled effort to curtail the turbine's power output, USAC had imposed revised regulations regarding the maximum annulus inlet (reduced from 23.999 in² to 15.999 in²).\nAnother rule change dictated that cars were required to conduct three mandatory pit stops, up from two that were required from 1965 to 1967.\nMike Spence was fatally injured after a crash in turn one on May 7. A tire broke off his Lotus \"Wedge\" Turbine and struck him in the head. He died of his injuries a few hours after the accident after being taken to the hospital. Spence's death came one month after Jim Clark's at Hockenheim; Clark was scheduled to drive one of the Lotus Wedge Turbines at Indy.\nPole Day Time trials – Saturday May 18.\nGraham Hill, the 1966 winner in the #70 STP Turbine, was first to qualify and set a new qualifying record. Later, his STP Lotus 56 teammate Joe Leonard in #60 won the pole position with a four-lap average speed of .\nSecond Day time trials – Sunday May 19.\nRain kept cars off the track most of the day. Only two cars were able to make an attempt, and only one was run to completion. At 5:45 p.m., the track was finally opened for qualifications, and Jochen Rindt was the lone qualifier at , while Denny Hulme waved off as the 6 o'clock gun went off.\nAt the conclusion of the first weekend of time trials, the field was filled to 16 cars.\nThird Day time trials – Saturday May 25.\nSixteen cars made a total of 24 attempts, and filled the field to 26 cars. High winds kept some cars off the track, and speeds were down from the previous weekend. Many cars waved off, and Mel Kenyon, at , was the fastest of the day.\nAfter qualifying, Ronnie Bucknum's car was disqualified for being underweight.\nFourth day time trials – Sunday May 26.\nWith the field filled to 25 cars (eight spots open), rain kept the cars off the track until late in the day. The final scheduled day of time trials (\"Bump Day\") was almost a complete wash out. The traditional 6 o'clock closing time came and went, and the track was still wet. Track crews continued to work, and the track opened for practice at 6:55 p.m. After the mandatory 30-minute practice session, the track opened for time trials at 7:31 p.m.\nWith overcast skies and darkness looming, three cars made attempts. Bill Puterbaugh and Bill Cheesbourg completed runs, while Bobby Johns spun on his second warm up lap. At that time, officials deemed the conditions unsafe due to darkness, and postponed the remainder of qualifying until Monday morning.\nTime trials – Monday May 27.\nFor the first time since 1952, time trials were pushed into a fifth day. Officials ruled that all 25 cars that were in the starting field at 6 p.m. Sunday (May 26) were \"locked in\" and could not be bumped. In addition, all cars that were in line to qualify Sunday evening at 7:54 p.m. were eligible to make one qualifying attempt on Monday. Only cars that qualified after 6 p.m. on Sunday evening were subject to bumping (including Puterbaugh and Cheesbourg).\nRonnie Bucknum was reinstated to the field when it was determined that during his inspection, the scale used to weight the car was defective. With Bucknum's car back in the field, only seven spots were now available.\nThough rain hampered the day, the qualifying was successfully completed on Monday. A frantic session saw two crashes (Bob Hurt and Rick Muther). Eighteen cars took to the track to fill the seven open spots. Both Puterbaugh and Cheesebourg were bumped, and Mike Mosley was the fastest of the day. Jim Hurtubise qualified his front-engined Mallard for 30th starting position. It would be the final front-engined car to qualify for the Indy 500.\nRace Day.\nFirst half.\nAt the drop of the green flag, Joe Leonard in the #60 STP Turbine took the lead, with Bobby Unser in second and Roger McCluskey up to third at the end of lap one. A fast pace was set over the first 100 miles, with no yellow caution lights. Bobby Unser took the lead for the first time on lap 8, and led most of the first half.\nAfter only nine laps, Jim Hurtubise in the front-engined PepsiCo Frito-lay special had burned a piston, and was out, finishing 30th, the final front-engined \"roadster\" to race at lap at the 500. Also in the pits was Mario Andretti, who dropped out with a bad piston. Moments later, he hopped into the car of his teammate Larry Dickson, but that was also short-lived. That car also suffered a broken piston after 24 laps.\nOn lap 41, the caution flag flew for the first time. Al Unser Sr. made a routine pit stop, but a fire broke out in the turbocharger. He was able to return to the race, but after only one lap, he lost a wheel and hit the wall in turn one. Arnie Knepper and Gary Bettenhausen were also involved. After , defending champion A. J. Foyt was out with a blown engine.\nSecond half.\nOn lap 110, Graham Hill lost a wheel and smashed into the turn two wall, which brought out the second caution. It was the first of the three Granatelli Turbines to drop out of the race. On the restart, Bobby Unser took the lead, blowing by Joe Leonard, showing the traditional piston-powered engines were still a match for the powerful turbines.\nOn lap 127, Mel Kenyon and rookie Billy Vukovich II tangled in turn four. Both were able to re-enter the race, but Johnny Rutherford, while trying to slow down, was rear-ended by Jim McElreath. Mike Mosley also spun into the turn four grass trying to avoid the accident. Rutherford was out, but McElreath limped back to the pits where his crew repaired the nosecone.\nWhen Bobby Unser made his last pit stop on lap 166, his gearshift linkage was broken, and the car was stuck in high gear. As he slowly left his pit, struggling to accelerate back to racing speed, both Leonard and Ruby passed him. Leonard now led in the Turbine. Ruby was up to second, but moments later on lap 178, Ruby was back in the pits with a faulty ignition coil. His crew was able to replace the coil, but the six-minute pit stop dropped him out of contention for the win.\nWith 19 laps to go, Joe Leonard led, with Bobby Unser back up to second. Carl Williams crashed on the backstretch, triggering a fire which brought out the yellow light. Under the caution, Leonard led, with Bobby Unser second, and Dan Gurney in third. For a brief moment, a controversy started brewing as Art Pollard (teammate to Joe Leonard), who was a couple laps down, was not keeping up with the caution pace. As a result, Bobby Unser was stuck behind him, and losing track position to Leonard.\nFinish.\nAfter the cleanup, the green flag was given to the field at the start of lap 192. At that instant, both leader Joe Leonard and his teammate Art Pollard hesitated and instantly slowed with identical snapped fuel pump drive shafts. The turbine engines again failed in sight of the finish, stunning the racing fraternity. Bobby Unser swept by into the lead with Dan Gurney inheriting second place. With a nearly full-lap lead, Unser cruised over the final nine laps to win his first Indianapolis 500.\nCars using Goodyear tires swept the top four positions, and Goodyear won their second 500 in row. Officials allowed the top five cars to finish the full 500 miles, then flagged the rest of the field off the track. This would be the final 500 in which finishers were named to the prestigious Champion Spark Plug 100 mph Club. Unlike the 1967 race, the Turbine did not run away from the field in 1968. Bobby Unser led the most laps in the Offenhauser, but Joe Leonard spent most of the day on Unser's tail, in the top three. Graham Hill ran in the top five, but complained that he lacked speed down the long straights, and was running 4th when he wrecked. Art Pollard, in the third Turbine, spent most of the day in the top ten before the car quit, but was never really a factor for the win.\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer. Len Sutton served as \"driver expert\" for the third year. At the conclusion of the race, Lou Palmer reported from victory lane.\nPre-race coverage was 30 minutes. The entire on-air crew remained consistent from 1966 &amp; 1967. The broadcast was carried by over 900 affiliates including 761 in the United States, Armed Forces Network, the CBC, and reached New Zealand and Australia for the first time. The broadcast had an estimated 100 million listeners worldwide.\nCollins greeted numerous guests in the booth during the race. Among those who stopped by were Chuck Stevenson, Sam Hanks, J. C. Agajanian, former (and future) radio analyst Fred Agabashian, Duke Nalon, Pete DePaolo, Henry Banks, Tom Binford, Johnnie Parsons, and Johnny Boyd. Indiana Senator Vance Hartke visited the booth, escorting a delegation that included Secretary of Transportation Alan Boyd, FCC chairman Rosel H. Hyde, Utah Senator Frank Moss, and Jack Kauffmann (\"The Washington Star\"). Senator Birch Bayh also visited the booth, accompanied by his teenage son, future governor and future senator Evan Bayh, who was attending his first race. On the air, Evan correctly predicted Bobby Unser would win the race.\nTelevision.\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\". The broadcast was supposed to air on Saturday, June 8 but was postponed a week to Saturday June 15 due to the funeral that day of Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

        "title": "Mike Brown (American football executive)",
        "text": "Michael Brown (born August 10, 1935) is an American football executive who is the owner of the Cincinnati Bengals in the National Football League (NFL). The son of Bengals co-founder Paul Brown, he joined the Bengals upon their founding in 1968 and assumed ownership after his father's death in 1991. Before beginning his career as a football executive, he played quarterback at Dartmouth.\nEarly life.\nBrown is the only living son of Paul Brown. His brother, Pete, was the senior vice-president of Bengals' player personnel until his death in 2017. His older brother, Robin, died of cancer in 1978.\nBrown graduated from Dartmouth College in 1957, where he played quarterback for their football team, and from Harvard Law School in 1960. He played nine games for the Big Green in 1956. In an unusual meeting between future sports owners, eventual New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner hired him to a summer job as a deck hand for Kinsman Marine Transit Company.\nBrown eventually followed his father into football management. Paul Brown founded the Bengals, then an American Football League (AFL) team, in 1968. (This was several years after Paul Brown was dismissed as Cleveland Browns head coach in a well-publicized falling out with Art Modell.) He began his executive duties with the Bengals as assistant general manager. Along with personnel decisions, he was a spokesman for the team on issues of league rules and team policy.\nTaking over the team.\nBrown assumed ownership responsibilities upon his father's death in August 1991 and has remained in the ownership position since. His first significant move as owner was to fire popular coach Sam Wyche after the 1991 season (although he originally claimed that Wyche resigned). Days later, Brown hired Dave Shula to be head coach, making Shula (at the time) the second youngest NFL head coach in history and making Dave and Don Shula the first father-son to lead different NFL teams in the same year. Going into 1993, Brown sought to negotiate a new lease with Cincinnati to keep the Bengals in the city.\nConstruction of a new stadium deal.\nInitially, Brown rejected advances from other cities to discuss moving the team. By 1995, he argued that Riverfront Stadium's small seating capacity and lack of luxury boxes was hindering the Bengals' success.\nIn 1995, he announced that Cincinnati had breached its lease agreement when it was late by one week in paying $167,000 in concession receipts. He threatened to move the team to Baltimore if Cincinnati or Hamilton County would not fund a new stadium. The leverage of this threat proved successful as Cincinnati's City Council and the Hamilton County Commissioners opted to fund the new Paul Brown Stadium with a proposed county sales tax increase, which needed voter approval. (Modell eventually, and controversially, moved the Browns to Baltimore and renamed it to the Ravens, but a new Cleveland team resumed the Browns' history.) In 1996, Hamilton County voters passed a one-half percent sales tax increase to fund the building of a new facility for the Bengals \"and\" a second new facility for the Major League Baseball Cincinnati Reds. The Bengals filed suit against the county for the right to manage it in 2000. County commissioners agreed to let a Bengals' subsidiary run the stadium, and it opened later that year.\nIn 2007, Hamilton County Commissioner Todd Portune (a former Cincinnati City Council member, though not Commissioner at the time the parties executed the lease), filed a lawsuit in federal district court against the NFL, the Bengals and the other 31 NFL teams. Portune felt, among other things, that published revenues from 1995 to 1999 contradicted Brown's claims of financial distress. The Hamilton County Board of Commissioners eventually was substituted as the plaintiff in the case. Fans supporting Portune cited what they felt was the broken promise that the Bengals would \"be more competitive\" with a new stadium. The Bengals have had only eight winning seasons out of 22 since the stadium opened, with five of those seasons occurring from 2011 to 2015.\nRick Eckstein, co-author of \"Public Dollars, Private Stadiums,\" described the Hamilton County arrangement as \"the single most lopsided stadium deal since 1993\" and questioned Bob Bedinghaus' role with the team after having been County Commissioner when the deal was reached. A 2008 Forbes survey suggested the team's rankings in direct revenues had dropped since the stadium's construction (placing the team 21st in total value at the time at $941 million).\nThe organization's lease is due to expire in 2026. In 2020, Hamilton County and the Bengals agreed to split costs on an architectural needs assessment of the stadium.\nOn-the-field struggles.\nSince Brown became owner, the team has eight winning seasons out of 30, a winning percentage of .418 (199–278–4) in the regular season, and no playoff wins in seven appearances from 1991 to 2020. In 2008, the Bengals set a record for the most games needed under one specific owner to attain 100 wins (288). In 2010, the team set a record for the fewest games needed to lose 200 (both considering and not considering playoffs) under one specific owner (314).\nThe Bengals hold a number of distinctions for the time frame of Brown's ownership: It is the only team with three nine-game-or-more losing streaks. It also holds six of the twenty-five 0-6 starts (24%) and four of the thirteen 0-8 starts (31%) in that time. The Bengals have gone winless in October nine different times in twenty-two years under five different head coaches (Sam Wyche, the first under his ownership, was originally hired by his father).\nThe franchise's winless playoff record from 1991 to 2020 was the longest active drought in the four major North American sports. One of the few successful coaches during Brown's tenure was Marvin Lewis, who was his first to have winning seasons, playoff appearances, division titles, and an overall winning record at 131-129-3 (.504). All seven of the Bengals postseason appearances with Lewis, however, ended in first-round losses.\nZac Taylor, Lewis' successor, was the first head coach under Brown to win a playoff game, which he achieved in 2021. The team also won the franchise's first road playoff game and advanced to Super Bowl LVI, although they lost to the Los Angeles Rams.\nIn 2009, Yahoo sports ranked Brown as the second worst owner in the NFL. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Mike Brown as the 9th worst sports owner.\nPhilosophy.\nDuring Marvin Lewis' tenure as head coach, Brown began to cede more of the day-to-day control over football matters to a committee composed of Lewis, executive vice president Katie Blackburn (Brown's daughter), and several other members of the Brown family. This preceded a five-year run of playoff appearances (2011–2015).\nTolerance of off field conduct.\nIn the mid-to-late 2000s, the Bengals were involved in a series of disciplinary measures with a variety of players. In 2005, the Bengals drafted Chris Henry and Odell Thurman, each considered exceptionally talented but possible disciplinary hazards during their college careers. The following year, they were among nine Bengals players arrested for various offenses. Brown cut several \"problem players\" in 2008 including Henry and Thurman, but re-signed Henry later that year. This came after five arrests of Henry and Brown's statement earlier in the year that Henry's \"conduct could no longer be tolerated.\" One fan protested by purchasing an electronic billboard along the Cincinnati interstate reading \"CHRIS HENRY AGAIN? ARE YOU SERIOUS?\" Henry died during a domestic dispute on December 17, 2009. Commenting on his death, Brown defended his decision to re-sign Henry, noting that \"We knew him in a different way than his public persona.\" Posthumously, it was discovered that Henry was suffering from a progressive degenerative brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. According to a West Virginia University research study, the CTE may have contributed to Henry's troubled behavior and, ultimately, his death.\nLater in 2008, the Bengals signed running back Cedric Benson, whom the Chicago Bears had waived, in part, due to his off-field activities. In 2009, the team added Larry Johnson to provide depth for the position after the Kansas City Chiefs released him for \"detrimental conduct.\" Johnson had also experienced recent legal difficulties. Benson was among 2009's leading NFL rushers, while Johnson saw limited action.\nBrown also signed free agent Adam \"Pacman\" Jones during the 2010 offseason despite Jones' legal history while a member of the Tennessee Titans and Dallas Cowboys, including a season-long ban in 2007 due to a shooting in Las Vegas. He also signed undrafted free agent Vontaze Burfict in the 2012 offseason despite his legal history in college and high number of flagrant fouls while at Arizona State.\nIn recent years, Brown claims to have rethought this approach. Talking about the team's second appearance on \"Hard Knocks\", Brown stated, \"We have a different team now than we had a few years ago. We want the public to see them. We think they're good people. We think the public will be taken by them, will like them. It gives us a boost.\"\nBrown has commented that the league's current attitude towards discipline is a change from a past \"boys will be boys\" attitude. Brown's father welcomed tailback Stanley Wilson back to the Bengals in 1988 after two drug suspensions. Wilson relapsed the night before Super Bowl XXIII and his absence in short-yardage situations affected the Bengals' efforts in one of the tightest Super Bowl games in NFL history that Cincinnati ultimately lost.\nLoyalty issues.\nBrown is historically reluctant to fire personnel after multiple losing seasons. His first hire as head coach, David Shula, lost fifty games faster than any NFL coach in history (69 games); Shula was hired over Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Bill Cowher, presumably due to Brown seeing similarities with himself and Shula in the same manner that their respective fathers (Don Shula and Paul Brown) overshadow them in many aspects. Cowher would take the head coaching position with the rival Pittsburgh Steelers that same offseason and would go on to have a 22–9 career record against the Bengals, the most wins he would have against any team as a head coach, including an 8–1 record against Shula. Cowher also beat the Bengals in the 2006 wild card game as well and went on to win a Super Bowl title that year. Shula's successor, Bruce Coslet, resigned with a 21–39 record in 2000; Brown had yet to fire him.\nCincinnati's first winning seasons and postseason appearances during Brown's ownership came under head coach Marvin Lewis, who obtained a 131–122–3 regular season record with the team and helped the Bengals return to competitiveness. However, Brown was criticized for continuing to retain Lewis after the Bengals lost all seven of the playoff games they appeared in during Lewis' tenure. Following five consecutive opening-round postseason losses from 2011 to 2015, an NFL first, and back-to-back losing seasons in 2016 and 2017, Lewis received a two-year contract extension, which received harsh criticism from the media and fans. When Brown and Lewis mutually parted ways in 2018, Lewis' 16-year tenure became the most of an NFL head coach to not win a playoff game as well as the most playoff losses without a win in NFL history.\nBrown also values his family's connection with the franchise; evident in his choosing to name Paul Brown Stadium after his father rather than to sell corporate naming rights for it. Daughter Katie Blackburn is the executive president of the team and her husband Troy is a VP with additional family members among the front office staff. From 1994 to 2000, the Bengals paid out over $50 million to the Brown family members of Bengals staff in salaries.\nFormer Bengals receiver Cris Collinsworth argues Brown's loyalty played a role in a decision to not persuade Boomer Esiason out of retiring despite a productive 1997 season. Esiason became a color analyst on ABC's \"Monday Night Football\". Collinsworth suggested Brown \"thought he was doing the right thing by Boomer\" and did not want to cost him the \"MNF\" job. Collinsworth contrasted this attitude to other NFL owners, like the Dallas Cowboys' Jerry Jones, whom Collinsworth felt \"would have flown Boomer down to the Bahamas on his personal jet, offered to kiss his ring and signed him right there.\"\nScouting.\nBrown employs a very small scouting staff. A 2008 comparison between the Bengals' scouting department and five AFC teams with a .540+ winning percentage since 1991 showed the winning teams employing five or more scouts whereas the Bengals employed only one. Since then, the Bengals have added two additional scouts (Marvin Lewis originally claimed when hired that Brown assured him of a retooled scouting staff).\nEmphasis on the quarterback.\nBrown has publicized his belief that a \"bell cow\" quarterback is a necessity in turning a team into a winner. In a 1999 interview, he remarked \"If you don't have a productive quarterback, you won't go anywhere...I know it doesn't seem that simple, but it is.\" Comparing quarterbacks to other positions on a football team, Brown has said \"He's the hub of the wheel...like a queen on a chessboard. These other guys are like rooks or bishops or other pieces that are not quite as valuable. Some are more valuable than others. That's just a fact.\"\nBrown turned down then-Saints coach Mike Ditka's offer of nine draft picks for one in the 1999 NFL draft against then-coach Coslet's advice. Coslet wanted as many draft picks as possible to help the Bengals' defense. Instead, Brown overruled Coslet and selected University of Oregon quarterback Akili Smith. Smith only played 22 games in his NFL career and is generally regarded as a draft bust. Coslet later regretted that he \"didn't insist hard enough\" in trying to persuade Brown to accept the Saints' offer.\nBefore the 1992 Draft, press reports stressed the Bengals' need for either a cornerback or defensive lineman. Brown himself had been quoted the day before the draft as stating \"we would dearly love to get a top defensive lineman, they're at a premium, and it's less true of other positions.\" Instead, the Bengals selected Houston quarterback David Klingler. Then Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason and strong-safety David Fulcher both openly questioned the move the next day, arguing the team needed help on defense. Klingler later became regarded as a bust. Esiason has since revealed that he had actually demanded a trade at the end of the 1991 season, which may have influenced Brown to select Klingler (Esiason was traded to the New York Jets in 1993).\nBrown placed a great deal of responsibility on Carson Palmer, calling him the Bengals' \"lead dog\" and stating \"as he goes, we go.\" Palmer holds a number of team records and three Pro Bowl selections. The Bengals were 46-51 (.474) with Palmer as starter. Palmer threatened retirement from football if the Bengals did not trade him during the 2011 offseason. Brown insisted that he wouldn't \"reward\" Palmer's demands, arguing that Palmer made a commitment to the organization when he received a contract extension. Brown released Carson's younger brother, Jordan from the team on August 27, 2011. On October 18, 2011, the Bengals finally traded Carson to the Oakland Raiders for a 2012 first round draft pick and a conditional second round 2013 pick if Oakland made it to the AFC Championship game in 2011 or 2012 (which they did not). Palmer later said in the NFL Network documentary series A Football Life that after the 2010 season, he told Brown that the Bengals needed to modernize and hire a general manager and that he and Brown got into a heated argument over it. He said that Brown 'is a very, very, very stubborn man'.\nAndy Dalton was taken in the 2011 NFL Draft and became the first quarterback in franchise history to lead the team to the playoffs five years in a row, although the Bengals were eliminated in the first round each year. Dalton did not play in what became the fifth consecutive loss due to injury. After returning from injury, Dalton struggled mightily from 2016 to 2019 and was eventually cut after the 2019 season.\nThe Bengals drafted Joe Burrow with the first overall pick in the 2020 Draft. In 2021, Burrow led the Bengals to their first playoff win since 1990 and has led them to back-to-back AFC Championship Games in 2021 and 2022, a team first, and one Super Bowl berth.\n\"Carl Pickens Clause\".\nIn 1998, the Bengals cut punter Lee Johnson. Brown attempted to fine Johnson after cutting him for \"conduct detrimental to the team\" in relation to comments Johnson had made about the organization and the 1998 season. A reporter asked Johnson after a Bengals loss \"if you were a fan, would you have come here today?\" to which Johnson replied \"No, no way...why would you? You're saying (losing) is OK. I guess if you've got nothing else to do. I'd sell my tickets.\" This fine resulted in a dispute with the NFL players union, whose counsel remarked \"A fine is a disciplinary measure, you discipline someone to try and make sure they're a better employee in the future. How can you do that if you've fired them?\"\nIn 2000, the Bengals instituted a \"loyalty clause,\" which allows the Bengals to deny various bonuses to players depending on the remarks they make about the Bengals. The ability to enact such a clause appears justified under the collective bargaining agreement which states an NFL team can fine a player one week's salary and suspend him without pay for up to four weeks for any action the club considers detrimental to the team. Brown responded that the clause would only be enacted under extreme circumstances. He wrote an editorial for the \"Cincinnati Enquirer\", citing team cohesion as his main motivation for the clause.\nIt is often dubbed the \"Carl Pickens Clause,\" stemming from the 2000 offseason. Brown renewed Bruce Coslet's contract despite his 21–36 Bengals record. Pickens responded, \"I don't understand it. We're trying to win; we're trying to turn this thing around out there. And they bring (Coslet) back.\" Pickens finished his career with the Tennessee Titans.\nOver the years since the clause, Bengals players have commented on a negative atmosphere within the organization, notably Takeo Spikes, Jeff Blake, and Jon Kitna.\nThe most vocal critic of the Bengals since the clause was instituted was Corey Dillon. In 2001, after becoming the sixth player in NFL history to rush for 1,000 yards or more in five consecutive seasons, he remarked \"at the end of the season, what do I have to feel good about? Nothing at all. It's not cool.\" After a fifth losing season with the team in 2002, he remarked \"\"I'm tired of it, six years of this B.S. I ain't lying to you. I'm sick of this crap, period.\" Dillon demanded a trade at the end of the 2003 season after throwing most of his gear to the fans during the last home game of the season. He went on to win a Super Bowl with the New England Patriots in the following season.\nFrugality.\nIn 1994, agent Leigh Steinberg described Brown as \"in a lonely fight for economic rationality in the NFL\" and \"a Don Quixote-type figure pushing back the forces of salary madness.\" In the 2000s, Brown proved reluctant to finish free agent signings or trades. Warren Sapp (in 2004), Shaun Rogers (in 2008), and Johnathan Joseph (in 2011) being notable examples.\nAgent Drew Rosenhaus described it as a \"matter of hours\" before the Bengals would sign Sapp, only a day before the Raiders signed him. Sapp accused the Bengals of \"playing with the money\" on the original deal they offered him, deferring more money to incentives rather than in guarantees. The Associated Press reported a completed trade between Cincinnati and the Detroit Lions on February 29, 2008, for Rogers. However, the trade fell through and the next day, it was confirmed that the Lions instead traded Rogers to the Cleveland Browns.\nFormer Bengals players and beat writers have also remarked on other spendthrift aspects of the organization as compared to other NFL franchises, such as not supplying sports drinks and providing undersized towels or used equipment for the players.\nCriticism.\nOrganizers from MikeBrownSucks organized a boycott of a December 2001 regular season game and fans visiting this site as well as another site, SaveTheBengals.com, paid for planes to fly a banner in the Cincinnati area calling for Brown's resignation.\nWho Dey Revolution (WDR) has staged \"Project Mayhem\" since 2008 in an effort to persuade Brown to make changes to the Bengals. These steps ranged from calling the Bengals \"JERK line\" to report Brown's behavior as abusive to purchasing billboards displaying a request for a general manager to merchandise and ticket donations/boycotts and letter-writing campaigns. The website's purchase and distribution of 1000 urinal cakes at a Bengals' home game advertised Brown's lifetime regular season record of 98–186–1 to that point.\nWDR published a comic strip titled \"The Lost Generation\", presenting Mike Brown in a Charlie Brownesque caricature, presumably to correlate Brown's track record to the famous cartoon character's history of hard luck and failure.\n\"All My Bengals\" was a popular satirical radio skit, hosted by 700 WLW Radio personality Gary Burbank.\nDespite these protests, the Bengals have remained popular within Cincinnati. A November 21, 2010, game vs. the Buffalo Bills marked the first time since November 2003 that network affiliates and DirectTV were legally obliged to \"black out\" the Bengals game within a 75-mile radius of Paul Brown Stadium for lack of ticket sales. The remaining home games against the New Orleans Saints, Cleveland Browns, and San Diego Chargers were also blacked out. Prior to this, the team sold out 57 straight games, a club record.\nResponse.\nSeveral people cast Brown sympathetically in response to fan and media criticism. After a surprising upset of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2003, Marvin Lewis tearfully awarded the game ball to Brown and told his players \"he has put up with so much for you guys.\" Some former Bengals dismiss notions that Brown is unconcerned with winning. Boomer Esiason, now a CBS analyst, refers to Brown as a \"nice man\" who is simply over his head running the team. In 1998 interviews, Cris Collinsworth and Bengals radio analyst Dave Lapham also rejected notions that Brown did not care about winning. Collinsworth remarked \"I don't think anybody could be suffering more over this than Mike is.\"\nPersonal life.\nBrown is married. He has been considered reclusive as very little is known about his personal life. He has at least two children. His daughter, Katie Blackburn, serves as the Bengals' executive vice president. She is also the first woman to be a chief contract negotiator in the NFL.\nBrown has admitted to an affinity for Ohio State football players. His father Paul coached the Buckeyes to their first national championship in 1942.\nBrown's net worth was estimated at $2.1 billion by Forbes in 2022.\nPhilanthropy.\nIn 2008, Brown and the Bengals donated $250,000 to assist the Cincinnati Park Board in paying for Cincinnati Riverfront Park. He has contributed to a number of Republican campaigns, including several Presidential bids.\nIn 2017, Brown and his family received the Pillar Award for Community Service's Kent Clapp CEO Leadership Award. The award recognizes a top executive for his or her passion toward philanthropy and honors the late Kent Clapp, CEO of Medical Mutual, who died in a 2008 plane crash."

        "title": "West Coast Conference men's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The West Coast Conference men's basketball tournament is the annual concluding tournament for the NCAA college basketball in the West Coast Conference (WCC). The winner of the tournament each year is guaranteed a place in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament for that season. Through 2008, the tournament was played on a rotating basis at the home courts of member teams. The 2009 edition was the first played at a neutral site, namely Orleans Arena in Paradise, Nevada, just outside Las Vegas. The semifinals are broadcast nationally on ESPN2 and the championship is broadcast nationally on ESPN.\nThe tournament has used several formats in its history, though seeding in all formats has been based strictly on conference record (with tiebreakers used as needed). When the tournament began in 1987, when the conference had eight members, it used a standard single-elimination bracket that was reseeded after the first round so that the highest and lowest remaining seeds played one another in the semifinals. Beginning in 2003, the bottom four seeds played first-round games (5 vs. 8, 6 vs. 7), with the 3 and 4 seeds receiving byes to the quarterfinals and the top two seeds receiving byes to the semifinals. For the 2012 tournament, the first after the 2011 arrival of BYU in the WCC, this format was adjusted so that the 8 and 9 seeds played in the first round, with the winner joining the 5 through 7 seeds in the second round, and the top four seeds continuing to receive byes into the quarterfinals (3 and 4) or semifinals (1 and 2). In addition, reseeding was abolished, with the top seed automatically playing the winner of the quarterfinal game featuring the 4 seed and the 2 seed automatically playing the winner of the quarterfinal game featuring the 3 seed.\nBeginning in 2014, the WCC adopted a new format to incorporate a tenth team (Pacific). The new format is a traditional 10-team tournament. Seeds 1-6 received a bye into the quarterfinals while 7 played 10 and 8 played 9 in the first round. The second round featured the winner of the 7/10 match playing the 2-seed while the winner of the 8/9 match played the 1 seed. The 3 seed played the 6 seed and the 4 seed played the 5 seed. In 2014, the first-round games aired on BYUtv Sports. The afternoon quarterfinal games aired on BYUtv, and the evening quarterfinals were on ESPN2. One semifinal aired on ESPN and the other on ESPN2, and the championship game was carried by ESPN.\nFor 2019 and beyond, the tournament returned to a format similar to that used from 2003–2011, with slight changes to the terminology used for the rounds prior to the semifinals. The 7 through 10 seeds play in what is now called the \"opening round\", the 5 and 6 seeds start play in the \"second round\", and the 3 and 4 seeds start in the \"third round\". The top two seeds receive byes into the semifinals. According to media reports, the major impetus for this and other changes to WCC basketball was the potential loss of Gonzaga to the Mountain West Conference after the 2017–18 season, which in the end did not happen.\nResults by team.\nTeam win–loss records.\nAs of March 12, 2024.\nGonzaga–Saint Mary's men's basketball rivalry.\nThe Gonzaga–Saint Mary's men's basketball rivalry is an intra-West Coast Conference college basketball rivalry between the Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball team of Saint Mary's College of California in Moraga, California and the Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team of Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington. Many analysts and members of the media have touted the Gaels vs. Zags as one of the best, if not the best, college basketball rivalry on the West Coast, as both teams have been consistently two of the top three teams in the conference over the last 2 decades. Gonzaga and Saint Mary's have combined to win 26 out of the last 30 conference championship games, including each of the last 16. The two teams have met a total of 116 times dating back to 1955 and currently meet biannually as a part of WCC conference play, with the potential to play a third game in the WCC tournament and a fourth in the postseason. As of March 2022, they have met 20 times in the WCC Tournament but have never met in any postseason tournaments beyond the end of conference play. Saint Mary's has upset a number 1 ranked Zags squad twice – once in the 2019 WCC final as an unranked team and once in 2022 as #23 in Moraga. And in 2024 took down the Zags in the WCC Championship game by the score 69-60."

        "text": "Jack Parker (born March 11, 1945) is the former head coach of the Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey team. The 2012–13 hockey season was Parker's 40th and final season as head coach of the Terriers, and his 47th overall at the school as a player or coach.\nPlaying career.\nParker graduated from Catholic Memorial School in West Roxbury in 1964. He played for the Terriers from 1965 to 1968. The team was a combined 77–22–4 while Parker was a center for the team. Parker played on three Beanpot Championship teams and two teams which played in the NCAA tournament placing fourth in 1966 and second in 1967. Parker was captain of the team during his senior year on the team. Parker played against Boston College's former coach, Jerry York, while York was at BC and in high school.\nCoaching career.\nImmediately after graduating, Parker was named head coach at Medford High School. After only one year, he returned to BU as an assistant under his former college coach, Jack Kelley, and helped lead the Terriers to two consecutive national championships in 1971 and 1972. After Kelley left the program to become general manager and head coach of the New England Whalers, Parker was promoted to B-team coach under his predecessor, Leon Abbott.\nAbbott was abruptly fired on December 21, 1973 for withholding information about the eligibility of two Canadian players who had played junior hockey in their native country, even though a judge questioned the constitutionality of the rules allegedly violated. Parker was named his successor.\nParker was asked by USA Hockey about coaching the Olympic team for the 1980 Olympics. He declined the position, which opened the door for Herb Brooks to serve as coach.\nOn February 8, 1989, Parker was named Boston University's athletic director. He was going to step down as head coach at the end of the 1988–89 season, but on February 21, 1989, Parker announced he was relinquishing the AD's job to continue coaching.\nParker was named the NCAA Coach of the Year three times, the first after the 1974–75 season, again after the 1977–78 season and a third time after 2008-09. Parker was also named the Hockey East Coach of the Year after the 1985–86, 1991–92, 1999–2000, 2004–05 and 2005-06 seasons. On January 30, 2009, Parker claimed his 800th win in a 3-1 victory over Merrimack College. He was only the third coach to win 800 games, and the first to do so with one team. On April 11, 2009, Parker won his 30th NCAA tournament game and third team national title.\nParker retired at the end of the 2012-13 season. He finished with a record of 897–472–115. At the time of his retirement, he was the third-winningest coach in NCAA history, behind only Ron Mason and Jerry York. His 897 wins are far and away the most in BU history, and are more than four times the total of runner-up Harry Cleverly. He has had a hand in more than two-thirds of BU's all-time wins. Apart from his one year as Medford High's coach, he spent the first 48 years of his adult life at BU as a player, assistant coach and head coach.\nRetirement.\nOn March 11, 2013, Parker announced that the 2012–13 season would be his last, telling \"BU Today\", \"Forty years is a long time to be at the same institution in the same job. I think I’m a little long in the tooth. I don’t think I’ve had the focus I need to have. I haven’t lost a step, but I don’t want to lose a step.\" In 2014, Coach Parker's jersey number 6 was retired by the Terriers in a ceremony during a game against the University of New Hampshire.\nIn 2017, he was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nNotable players.\nA list of notable players whom Parker has coached:"

        "title": "Monday Night Baseball",
        "text": "Monday Night Baseball was an American live game telecast of Major League Baseball (MLB) that aired on Monday nights during the regular season.\nEarlier incarnations of \"Monday Night Baseball\" aired on NBC and then ABC in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThese games formerly aired weekly on ESPN. The game started at 7 p.m. ET, following \"SportsCenter\", and usually lasted around three hours leading up to an hour-long \"Baseball Tonight\". The program sometimes aired on ESPN2 rather than ESPN, often due to NBA playoff coverage in April and May, and preseason \"Monday Night Football\" coverage in August.\nBeginning with the 2022 Major League Baseball season, ESPN significantly reduced their MLB schedule, which included cutting their \"Monday Night Baseball\" games. Monday night games now occasionally air on Fox Sports 1 as part of their irregularly scheduled weeknight games, and on and MLB Network as part of their \"MLB Network Showcase\" package. \nHistory.\nThe NBC years (1966–1975).\n\"Monday Night Baseball\" was born on October 19, 1966, when NBC signed a three-year contract to televise the game. Under the deal, NBC paid roughly $6 million per year for the 25 \"Games of the Week\", $6.1 million for the 1967 World Series and 1967 All-Star Game, and $6.5 million for the 1968 World Series and 1968 All-Star Game. This brought the total value of the contract (which included three Monday night telecasts each season) up to $30.6 million.\nFrom 1972–1975 NBC televised Monday games under a contract worth $72 million. In 1973, NBC extended the Monday night telecasts to 15 straight (with a local blackout). September 1, 1975 saw NBC's last \"Monday Night Baseball\" game, in which the Montréal Expos beat the Philadelphia Phillies 6–5.\nCurt Gowdy called the Monday night games with Tony Kubek from 1972 to 1974, the pair being joined in 1973 and 1974 by various guest commentators from both in and out of the baseball world. Jim Simpson and Maury Wills called the secondary backup games. Joe Garagiola hosted NBC's pregame show, \"The Baseball World of Joe Garagiola\", and teamed with Gowdy to call the games in 1975.\nThe ABC years (1976–1988).\nABC would pick up the television rights for \"Monday Night Baseball\" games in the following year. Just like with \"Monday Night Football\", ABC brought in the concept of the three-man-booth (originally composed of Bob Prince, Bob Uecker, and Warner Wolf as the primary crew) to their baseball telecasts.\nRatings were typically poor for ABC's Monday night games, and by 1986, ABC only televised 13 \"Monday Night Baseball\" games. This was a fairly sharp contrast to the 18 games to that were scheduled in 1978. \"The Sporting News\" suggested that ABC paid Major League Baseball to not make them televise the regular season, opining that the network only wanted the sport for October anyway. For most of its time on ABC, the Monday night games were held on \"dead travel days\" when few games were scheduled. The team owners liked that arrangement, as the ABC games didn't compete against their stadium box offices and local telecasts. The network, on the other hand, found the arrangement far more complicated; ABC often had only one or two games to pick from for each telecast from a schedule designed by Major League Baseball. While trying to give all of the teams national exposure, ABC ended up with a surplus of games involving games between either small-market teams and/or teams with losing records.\nIn 1989, the final year of ABC's contract with Major League Baseball, ABC moved the baseball telecasts to Thursday nights in hopes of getting a leg up against NBC's \"The Cosby Show\". The network also aired some late-season games on Sunday afternoons.\nESPN (2006–2021).\nESPN occasionally carried Monday night games after signing television rights deals with MLB in 1990, though the main regular broadcasts were \"Sunday Night Baseball\" and the \"Wednesday Night Baseball\" doubleheader. The network began carrying Monday night games regularly as part of the eight-year television contract that ESPN signed in 2005, replacing the second Wednesday night game. Unlike \"Sunday Night Baseball\", the game was non-exclusive, meaning it would also be carried by the teams' local broadcasters, and telecasts were typically blacked out in the participating teams' markets.\nBecause ESPN broadcasts \"Monday Night Football\" beginning with pre-season games in mid-August, late season \"Monday Night Baseball\" games would either move to ESPN2 or ESPN would broadcast a doubleheader as part of \"Wednesday Night Baseball\". On some occasions, ESPN scheduled two games to air simultaneously, with one game airing on ESPN and the second on ESPN2. Both telecasts are branded with the \"Wednesday Night Baseball\" name, but one featured the Monday night announce team.\nIn 2021, ESPN agreed to a new contract with Major League Baseball through the 2028 season. However, the deal included only around 30 exclusive broadcasts, 25 of which would take place on \"Sunday Night Baseball\", thus ending regular Monday Night Baseball broadcasts."

He played college football at Penn State and he was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL Draft.\nShaw also played for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears and Tennessee Titans.\nCollege career.\nShaw was recruited out of Livonia Clarenceville High School as a running back. A three-star recruit, he decided to attend Penn State, spurning other scholarship offers from Big Ten schools such as Michigan and Michigan State. Shaw saw extensive playing time on special teams and began earning snaps on defense. He became a starter, playing alongside Bednarik Award winning linebackers Paul Posluszny and Dan Connor, on what many people consider the best Penn State linebacking corps of all time. Shaw was a 2006 Academic All-American.\nProfessional career.\nCarolina Panthers.\nIn the 2007 NFL Draft, Shaw was drafted in the 5th round by the Carolina Panthers.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nShaw was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars on November 26, 2008, and appeared in three games for the Jaguars that season. He spent the 2009 preseason in Jacksonville's camp before being released on September 5, 2009.\nChicago Bears.\nThe Chicago Bears signed Shaw on September 14, 2009 after opening-week injuries to linebackers Brian Urlacher and Pisa Tinoisamoa depleted their linebacking corps. He set a club record for special teams tackles with 30 after an 8 tackle performance with a forced fumble and recovery against the Detroit Lions (January 3, 2010). On January 27, 2010, \"USA Today\" announced that Shaw had made its All-Joe Team, honoring the NFL's unsung and underrated players.\nTennessee Titans.\nOn September 5, 2010, Shaw was claimed off waivers by the Tennessee Titans. He played in 48 games over three seasons for the Titans and was their special teams captain in 2011 and 2012. He was released during final cuts on August 31, 2013.\nPersonal life.\nShaw is a Christian. He has said that his faith is \"... the foundation of who I am.\" Shaw has gone on two mission trips to Costa Rica and two mission trips to Haiti.\nShaw is close friends with former tight end Kevin Boss. The two are represented by the same firm, XAM Sports, and were roommates while training in Florida prior to the 2007 NFL Draft. He attended Boss' July 4, 2009 wedding.\nShaw is reportedly a jigsaw puzzle enthusiast.\nALS.\nOn August 19, 2014, Shaw revealed in a video that he has ALS. He then dumped a bucket of ice water over himself as part of the Ice Bucket Challenge. He has since been heavily involved in efforts to advance ALS research through better funding, and raise awareness about ALS, using different platforms. He is considered to be a champion of the cause, and has impacted ALS communities throughout the country.\nOn March 19, 2015, Shaw addressed the Tennessee General Assembly, making a pitch that would declare the month of May as ALS Awareness Month in Tennessee. On April 18, 2015, Best Man Tim held a fundraising event during Penn State's Blue White weekend that included an Ice Bucket Challenge. Shaw attended the dedicated event where he signed autographs, posed for photographs, and enjoyed the support of hundreds of community members. A large amount of Penn State legends and lettermen supported the event, including the Paterno Family. Jay Paterno participated in Best Man Tim's Blue White weekend event.\nOn August 27, 2017, Shaw's high school renamed its football stadium after him. At halftime of a football game, the Clarenceville High School introduced the David B. McDowell Field at Shaw Stadium in honor of Shaw. That same year, Shaw's book titled \"Blitz Your Life: Stories From An NFL And ALS Warrior\" was released. Shaw has continued to help fundraise for ALS research, inspire others who are battling ALS, and make himself available wherever he can be helpful to others. In 2017, Shaw was invited to speak to the current Penn State football team he spoke about his challenges after his diagnosis and spoke about his time playing football at Penn State and his experience in the NFL. His speech resonated with head coach James Franklin who posted his speech on his Twitter account which gained national attention. On November 18, 2017 Shaw was the honorary captain for Penn State's game vs the Nebraska Cornhuskers. He was honored with a video tribute and standing ovation by fans along with both teams.\nIn 2019, Shaw participated in a \"Player's Tribune\" article about his journey with ALS, in which he encouraged his younger self and others to \"live your best life today and enjoy every little blessing.\"\nOn December 18, 2019, a documentary video was released on YouTube that covered Project Euphonia. Google teamed up with Dimitri Kenevsky to create an AI-powered live transcription application that was specifically trained to understand and transcribe Shaw’s impaired voice. Using hours of interviews as audio reference, a separate AI program was created to synthesize Shaw’s old voice. While still in beta, the hope is to some day give Shaw the ability to clearly communicate again."

        "text": "The Austrian Open is a men's professional golf tournament on the European Tour. It was founded in 1990, and was a European Tour event for seven straight years up to 1996, being held under a variety of names due to regular changes of title sponsor. The tournament dropped down to the Challenge Tour schedule between 1997 and 2005, with a sharp reduction in prize money, before returning to the main tour for the 2006 season. In 2012, it was announced that the Austrian shopping community Lyoness and its affiliated Greenfinity foundation would be the title sponsors for three seasons.\nThe 2018 event was the first professional tournament to use a shot clock on every shot. The official European Tour time allowances were used: a 50-second allowance for a “first to play approach shot (including a par three tee shot), chip or putt” and a 40-second allowance for a “tee shot on a par four or par five, or second or third to play approach shot, chip or putt”. Players that failed to play within these time limits incurred a one-shot penalty, which was added to their score for that hole. Players had two “time-extensions” in each round, each giving them an extra 40 seconds.\nSince 2010 the tournament has been held at the Diamond Country Club in Atzenbrugg, Lower Austria, 35 km west of Vienna.\nIn 2020, the tournament was a dual-ranking event with the Challenge Tour, due to a revamp of the European Tour's schedule because of COVID-19 pandemic."

He served as the head football coach at the University of North Dakota from 1978 to 1979 and at California State University, Fullerton from 1980 to 1992, compiling a career college football coaching record 74–96–1.\nEarly years.\nBorn and raised in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Murphy's father was a football coach. He was an all-state quarterback and shortstop in high school. He initially attended the University of Minnesota, then transferred to the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, and played college football as a quarterback for the UND Fighting Sioux from 1960 to 1962.\nCoaching.\nMurphy then moved into an assistant coaching position with the team, where he remained until 1977. Murphy later was the UND head coach in 1978 to 1979. The team went 15–7 in his two seasons, winning the North Central Conference and advancing to the Division II playoffs in 1979. He was succeeded at North Dakota by one of his assistants, Pat Behrns.\nIn 1980, Murphy became head coach at California State University, Fullerton in Orange County. He led the Titans for thirteen years and was their final coach; the program was discontinued after the 1992 season. The Titans won the Pacific Coast Athletic Association championships in 1983 and 1984. The 1984 team was ranked in the National Top 20 and finished 12-0.\nHis assistants included future National Football League (NFL) head coaches Steve Mariucci, Tom Cable, and Hue Jackson. Notable former players include Damon Allen, Mike Pringle, Bobby Kemp, Mark Collins, and James Thornton. In 1999, Murphy was inducted into both the University of North Dakota Hall of Fame, and was inducted to the Cal State Fullerton Athletics Hall of Fame in 2009.\nAfter Cal State Fullerton dropped its football program, Murphy served as head coach at Fullerton College from 1993 to 2007. He remained a consultant with the program until his death.\nDeath.\nMurphy died at age 72 in 2011 at USC Hospital in Los Angeles, four days after surgery for esophageal cancer. He had seemed to be recuperating from the surgery when he had a heart attack. He was survived by his daughter Aileen, her mother Christine McCarthy, his two adult sons, Tim and Mike, and his four grandchildren. Murphy's funeral service was held at St. Juliana’s Catholic Church. He was buried in Fullerton at Loma Vista Memorial Park."

        "title": "2006 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 2006 Rose Bowl Game, played on January 4, 2006, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, was an American college football bowl game that served as the BCS National Championship Game for the 2005 NCAA Division I-A football season. It featured the only two unbeaten teams of the season: the defending Rose Bowl champion and reigning Big 12 Conference champion Texas Longhorns played Pacific-10 Conference titleholders and two-time defending AP national champions, the USC Trojans. Texas would defeat USC (whose loss was later officially vacated) 41–38 to capture its fourth football championship in program history and first consensus national title since 1969.\nThe game was a back-and-forth contest; Texas's victory was not secured until the game's final nineteen seconds. Vince Young, the Texas quarterback, and Michael Huff, a Texas safety, were named the offensive and defensive Rose Bowl Players of the Game. ESPN named Young's fourth-down, game-winning touchdown run the fifth-highest rated play in college football history. The game is the highest-rated BCS game in TV history with 21.7% of households watching it, and is often considered the greatest Rose Bowl game of all time, as well as the greatest college football game ever played.\nTexas's Rose Bowl win was the 800th victory in school history and the Longhorns ended the season ranked third in Division I history in both wins and winning percentage (.7143). It was only the third time that the two top-ranked teams had faced each other in Rose Bowl history, with the 1963 Rose Bowl and 1969 Rose Bowl games being the others; these games also featured USC.\nThe 92nd-annual Rose Bowl Game was played, as it is every year, at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California, in the United States.\nThis was the final game ever called by longtime broadcaster Keith Jackson (as well as the final Rose Bowl to telecast under ABC Sports branding); the 2007 Rose Bowl would be an ESPN on ABC presentation. It was also the final time until the BCS National Championship Game for the 2009 Season that it was broadcast as an ESPN on ABC presentation. In addition, this was the last National Championship Game in the BCS era to be a nominal BCS bowl game (the National Championship and the four BCS bowls became separate events beginning with the 2006 season).\nThis was the first college football game to feature two Heisman Trophy winners in the same starting lineup. USC's quarterback Matt Leinart and running back Reggie Bush won the award in 2004 and 2005, respectively, although Bush later forfeited the award. While the NCAA normally only vacates victories, USC claims its Rose Bowl loss was later vacated from official NCAA records, along with its 12 wins from before the game, leaving an official 2005 regular season record of 0–0.\nPre-game buildup.\nUSC entered the game on a 34-game winning streak. It was the longest active streak in Division I-A. (Many of those wins have since been vacated following NCAA sanctions surrounding allegedly illegal benefits given to USC's Reggie Bush.) Texas brought the second-longest active streak, having won nineteen straight games and entered as the defending Rose Bowl champion, after defeating Michigan in the 2005 Rose Bowl. The teams' combined 53-game win streak was an NCAA record for teams playing each other. The game was also the first to pit against each other the teams ranked first and second in every iteration of the BCS standings. This was Texas's second trip to the Rose Bowl in two years (and second trip in the history of UT football).\nA few weeks before the game, USC's Reggie Bush won the Heisman Trophy (since vacated in 2010) ahead of second-place finisher Vince Young. Bush had the second-highest number of first place votes in Heisman history (behind O. J. Simpson) and the highest percentage of first-place votes, while Young had a record number of second-place votes. Bush's 933-point margin of victory was the 17th highest in Heisman voting history. The other finalist was USC's Matt Leinart, who had won the Heisman trophy in 2004. This meant that the Rose Bowl would mark the first time that two Heisman-trophy winners had ever played in the same backfield.\nThe 2006 Rose Bowl was, in the eyes of many, the most-anticipated matchup in college football history. Both teams were considered good enough to win the National Championship had they existed in different years instead of having to play each other. USC had been ranked No. 1 since the preseason and Texas had held the No. 2 spot that entire time. Before the game, some commentators postulated that the 2005 USC team was one of the greatest college football teams of all time. ESPN analysts were virtually unanimous in declaring the 2005 USC Trojans as having the best offense in college football history (though it did not lead the nation in points scored; Texas did). Mark May and Kirk Herbstreit declared that the 2005 USC Trojans were the second-best college football team of the past 50 years (May placed them behind only the 1995 Nebraska Cornhuskers; Herbstreit behind only the 2001 Miami Hurricanes). This led Texas fans to mockingly chant \"Best...Team...Ever\" during the post-game celebration. Stewart Mandel of \"Sports Illustrated\" later observed, \"ESPN spent the better part of Christmas season comparing that Trojans squad to some of the most acclaimed teams of all time only to find out that they weren’t even the best team that season.\" Lee Corso was one of the few ESPN analysts to predict a Texas win.\nGame summary.\nFirst quarter.\nUSC received the opening kickoff and managed just three yards against a Texas defense that was stout early in the game. Aaron Ross fumbled the ball on the ensuing punt return, committing the first of four Texas fumbles on the day (though it would only lose one), and the Trojans recovered. A 23-yard Leinart pass to senior fullback David Kirtman, who was hit hard by Cedric Griffin and forced to leave the game briefly (Kirtman finished the game with three catches for 61 yards on the day), set up a four-yard touchdown run by running back LenDale White, a bruiser who out-rushed his speedy counterpart, Bush, on the day, gaining 124 yards on 20 carries. Kicker Mario Danelo's extra point gave USC a seven-point lead. The teams twice exchanged possessions to end the first quarter, as each defense held the opposing offense in check.\nSecond quarter.\nOn the second play of the second quarter, Reggie Bush exploded for 35 yards off a Leinart pass, reaching Texas's 18-yard line before attempting to lateral pass the ball to an uncovered teammate; Texas strong safety Michael Huff recovered the loose ball. The Pac-10 football-officiating coordinator later stated that Bush's pass was incorrectly officiated because it was an illegal forward pass, not a lateral, so the Trojans should have retained possession. Young drove his team 53 yards on the ensuing possession, twice hitting senior tight end David Thomas, who finished the day as Young's leading receiver, catching ten passes for 88 yards. The Trojans' defense tackled sophomore running back Ramonce Taylor five yards behind the line of scrimmage and forced a fumble that Young recovered for an additional five-yard loss. This forced a Texas field-goal attempt, which David Pino converted from 46 yards to cut Texas's deficit to four.\nOn USC's next possession, Leinart drove his team into Texas territory, this time to the 25-yard line, before throwing an interception to Texas free safety Michael Griffin, who appeared to be out of the play but ran halfway across the field before making a leaping catch and barely staying in-bounds in the end zone. The turnover ended a second Trojans' drive with USC in scoring position. On the following Texas drive, Young connected with wide receiver Limas Sweed, who caught eight balls for 65 yards on the day, for a key first down. Young then led his team with his legs, capping the drive by running 10 yards before throwing a lateral pass to open running back Selvin Young, who ran for 12 more for the touchdown. The lateral, made after Young's knee had touched the ground, was not reviewed because of issues with the replay equipment. The game continued with a failed extra-point attempt by Texas, which, not knowing of the equipment issues, appeared to rush the kick to get the play off before the prior play could be reviewed. The NCAA football-officiating coordinator later asserted that Young's knee had been down, and expressed confusion about how the call had been handled.\nA defensive stop on USC's next possession and a 15-yard punt return gave Texas the ball near midfield, and the Longhorns capitalized when Young found Thomas for 14 yards on one play, and Taylor running 30 yards for a touchdown on another. Pino's extra point extended the Longhorns' lead to 16–7. On the next drive, Leinart threw a pass intended for Reggie Bush that was grabbed by Texas linebacker/safety Drew Kelson. But Kelson landed on his back after catching the pass and the ball popped out. The pass was ruled incomplete; equipment issues again prevented a review. USC's drive continued with a Leinart pass to wide receiver Dwayne Jarrett, the top Trojan receiver of the day with ten catches totaling 121 yards, a quarterback keeper of 14 yards, and a Bush 12-yard run took the Trojans to the Texas 13-yard line with 40 seconds to play in the half. But two sacks by defensive tackle Frank Okam pushed USC back 13 yards and forced the Trojans to use two timeouts. Consequently, Danelo's 43-yard field goal allowed USC three points, and the half ended with Texas still ahead, 16–10.\nThird quarter.\nThe Trojan defense came back strong from the halftime break and forced a punt on the Longhorns' opening drive of the third quarter. During the following USC drive, Leinart hit Jarrett for three passes totaling 35 yards, and White added the final 17 yards over two carries, capping the seven-play, 62-yard drive with a three-yard touchdown run. It was his second of the game, and it put the Trojans ahead, 17–16.\nBehind the running of Jamaal Charles, who finished the game with five carries for 34 yards, and Young, who ran 19 times for 200 yards, Texas quickly answered. Young scored the first of his three rushing touchdowns from 14 yards out, and Pino's successful extra-point attempt moved the Longhorns ahead, 23–17.\nThe lead changed hands once more with 4:07 to play in the third quarter, as Leinart hit tight end Dominique Byrd for two of his four catches and 21 of his 32 yards in the next drive and set up the next score. Although USC had been stopped on a fourth-and-short attempt earlier in the game, it decided to gamble again on fourth-and-one from the 12, and this time White muscled it all the way to the end zone to record his third rushing touchdown of the game and the 57th of his career. The achievement set a USC record.\nThe Longhorns reached Trojan territory on the ensuing drive, with Young's 45-yard run constituting most of the work, but ultimately the Trojans forced a field-goal attempt from USC's 14-yard line, and, on the first play of the fourth quarter, Pino missed a 31-yard kick that would have put his team ahead by two.\nFourth quarter.\nBehind Leinart's precise throwing (despite one interception, Leinart finished the day with otherwise stellar numbers, completing 29-of-40 passes for 365 yards and one touchdown), the Trojans drove 80 yards over nine plays in 3:36. Bush scored his only touchdown of the game on a 26-yard run to end the drive. (Bush finished the game with 95 yards on just six catches and gained 82 yards on 13 carries; he also averaged 20.2 yards on five punt returns.)\nThe Longhorns’ next possession began with an apparent reception and fumble by Jamaal Charles. The error would have given USC the ball on the Texas 40, but replay officials ruled the catch incomplete. Two Vince Young completions to wide receiver Billy Pittman, who caught four passes for 53 yards on the day, helped the Longhorns drive to USC's 17-yard line on the next possession. When Young fumbled on third down, Texas settled for a 34-yard field goal that brought the Longhorns to within five, 31–26.\nOn the ensuing possession, the Trojans gained 48 yards with a 33-yard Leinart pass to Kirtman and a 15-yard roughing-the-passer penalty. This set up a 22-yard toss from Leinart to Jarrett – a play that saw Texas cornerback Tarrel Brown get injured while trying to tackle Jarrett at the goal line. Brown and a teammate collided as Jarrett stretched the ball over the goal line, and the successful extra-point attempt gave USC its biggest lead of the game, 38–26.\nAs Texas took the ball trailing by two scores with just 6:42 to play, Young accounted for all 69 yards of a Longhorns scoring drive that took just 2:39 to complete, rushing for 25 (including a 17-yard touchdown run) and completing five passes for the rest of the necessary yardage. (For the game, Young completed 75 percent of his passes – 30-of-40 – for 267 yards, with no passing touchdowns and no interceptions.) Pino's extra point again brought Texas to within five with 3:58 to play.\nThough the Longhorns' defense yielded one first down on the subsequent USC drive, it held the Trojans, who turned to LenDale White on a third down at midfield only to see him lose the ball and have it recovered by wide receiver Steve Smith just two yards short of a first down. A Texas timeout stopped the clock with 2:13 to play. Then, in what proved the most pivotal coaching decision of the game, Trojans coach Pete Carroll elected to give his #2-ranked offense (behind only Texas), which had averaged 582.2 yards and 50.0 points per game on the year, an opportunity to convert fourth down and two at the Texas 45-yard line. But the Texas defense, which had failed to stop this same play three times, held White to a one-yard gain. The result was a turnover on downs at the Longhorns' 44-yard line with 2:09 to play.\nDuring its final drive, Texas faced third-and-12. Texas converted for a first down at USC's 46-yard line after a completed pass for seven yards and a Trojans face-mask penalty. From there, Young rushed once for seven yards between two passes for 26 yards to little-used wide receiver Brian Carter, moving the ball to the USC 14-yard line. Facing fourth-and-five from the nine-yard line, Young received the shotgun snap and found his receivers covered. Young bolted towards the right sideline and received a critical block from Justin Blalock and won a footrace to the end zone. That score, Young's third rushing touchdown of the game, gave the Longhorns a one-point lead with 19 seconds left to play. When Texas lined up for a two-point conversion, USC used its last time out. Young successfully reached the end zone on the ensuing play, giving his team a 41–38 lead. Leinart took the ball with only 16 seconds left and no timeouts. He drove the Trojans to the Texas 43-yard line when time expired. The loss was only the second of Leinart's college career, and the first Rose Bowl loss for USC since the 1989 game.\nAnalysis and aftermath.\nVince Young was named the Rose Bowl's MVP for the second time in as many years (the first time being the 2005 Rose Bowl). He is only the fourth player in Rose Bowl history (and the only player from the Big 12 Conference) to accomplish this feat. USC head coach Pete Carroll regarded Young's performance as \"the greatest he's ever seen by any one guy\".\nThough USC converted on 57 percent of third downs (to only 27 percent for the Longhorns), it was unable to gain two yards on a 4th down try late in the 4th quarter when doing so might have ensured a Trojan victory. T\nhe Trojans did not have Heisman winner Bush on the field for the 4th down play; LenDale White received the handoff and was stuffed by the Longhorn defense. The Trojans also hurt themselves with two turnovers in Texas territory early in the game. Mack Brown, previously maligned for his inability to win big games, thus ended the fourth-longest winning streak in Division I-A history – and the longest since a 35-game streak by Toledo ended in 1971 – and, behind Young, who accounted for 839 yards of total offense in his two Rose Bowl appearances, won the first national title for Texas since 1970. Young accounted for 467 yards in the championship game, which stands as the best performance ever in a BCS Championship game. By winning, Texas assured itself a first-place ranking in the \"USA Today\" coaches' poll, and its achievement was confirmed when AP polling sportswriters unanimously voted Texas number one on January 5, 2006; USC finished a unanimous second in each poll. On January 11, 2006, Young was awarded the Manning Award, given annually to the nation's top quarterback. Unlike any other major college football award, the Manning is based partly on bowl results.\nFour players from the game went on to become top-ten picks in the 2006 NFL Draft: Reggie Bush (2nd overall, New Orleans), Vince Young (3rd overall, Tennessee), Michael Huff (7th overall, Oakland), and Matt Leinart (10th overall, Arizona). Taitusi Lutui, Fred Matua, LenDale White, David Kirtman, Winston Justice, Cedric Griffin, David Thomas, Frostee Rucker, Dominique Byrd, Darnell Bing, Jonathan Scott, LaJuan Ramsey, and Rodrique Wright were drafted in the next six rounds. This was longtime ABC Sports announcer Keith Jackson's last game, and was also the last college football game aired on ABC under the ABC Sports name, as ABC's sports division began going by the name of corporate sibling ESPN on ABC in September 2006.\nThe victory, Texas' 800th of all time, gave UT its fourth national championship in football. Since the game, the media, coaches, and other commentators have heaped praise upon the Texas team, Vince Young, and the Rose Bowl performance. For instance, Sports Illustrated called the game \"perhaps the most stunning bowl performance ever\". Both the Rose Bowl win as well as the Longhorns' overall season have both been cited as standing among the greatest performances in college football history by publications such as \"College Football News\", the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\", \"Scout.com\", and \"Sports Illustrated\". The Longhorns and the Trojans were together awarded the 2006 ESPY Award by ESPN for the \"Best Game\" in any sport. In December 2006, both Sports Illustrated and Time Magazine picked the game as the Best Sports Moment in 2006. Voters on Yahoo Sports also voted it as the Sports Story of the Year for both college football and overall, edging out 12 other stories in the overall voting and receiving 13,931 votes out of 65,641.\nIn the days that followed the Longhorns' victory, the Trinity River in Dallas mysteriously turned a \"burnt orange\" color. Authorities said that it may have been caused by someone dumping dye into the river.\nThe game received the highest Nielsen ratings for the Rose Bowl since the 1986 Rose Bowl between UCLA and Iowa. In 2007, ESPN compiled a list of the top 100 plays in college football history; Vince Young's game-winning touchdown in the 2006 Rose Bowl ranked number 5.\nThe 2006 Rose Bowl Game and its unreviewed, controversial officiants' rulings have been cited as a key reason the NCAA Football Rules Committee added a coach's challenge the following season. Ironically, USC opted to go without instant replay for its game against Notre Dame that season, and won on the final play when Reggie Bush illegally shoved Matt Leinart over the goal line.\nOn June 10, 2010, USC was forced to vacate its loss from this game in addition to all its 2005 wins and 2 wins in the 2004 season after an NCAA investigation into the football program (and men's basketball program) declared Reggie Bush retroactively ineligible. All official NCAA records show the Trojans as having a 0–0 record during the 2005 season.\nThis would be the last time USC and Texas met in a football game until 2017, which USC won in overtime 27–24. The two teams met again in 2018 in Texas as the second game of a home-and-home series between the two schools. Texas won 37–14 with USC failing to score any points after the first quarter and was the first time USC officially lost to Texas."

        "title": "Weber Cup",
        "text": "The Weber Cup, named after professional ten-pin bowler Dick Weber, is a men's ten-pin bowling competition between Team Europe and Team USA, wherein teams compete over three days in a series of single, double and team (baker) matches.\nFrom 2007 onward, the competition plays 33 matches, and the first team to receive 17 points wins the tournament.\nHistory and background.\nThe Weber Cup is the annual Europe vs United States ten-pin bowling championships and is currently broadcast live from start to finish on Sky Sports in the UK and on many other international channels around the world. It usually takes place in October every year.\nFor the first seven events, from 2000 to 2006, 35 matches were played. Each match is worth one point, and the first team to obtain 18 points wins the tournament. \nAll matches are played in a single lane arena, constructed for the event, with banked spectators on both sides. \n2003.\nIn 2003, missing their captain Tim Mack, and up against some vociferous Northern support, Team USA was never in contention as the Europeans went into the lead early on day one and never relinquished it.\nAfter three barren years of total United States domination, Team Europe finally overcame the odds in November 2003, to lift the hallowed Weber Cup for the first time. It was a total triumph for captain Tomas Leandersson, who led from the front for all three days, putting in a sterling performance that saw his side over the line.\n2004.\nFollowing Europe's recent success in golf's Ryder Cup earlier in the year, it was the ten-pin bowlers’ turn as they defeated their American counterparts in what was ultimately a one-sided battle at the Altrincham Leisure Centre.\nThe final score line of 18–11 was a fair reflection as Team Europe pulled away on the final day after the Americans kept them pinned back to a one-point lead at 11–10 after two days of play.\n2005.\nIn 2005, the Europeans staged a dramatic comeback after falling 14-16 behind. In front of a packed audience and live TV cameras, they won the first 4 singles games in the final session of play and took the title for the third successive year, 18–16. As in the previous year, Team Europe captain, Tomas Leandersson won the decisive point with a win over Team USA's Tony Manna Jr.\n2006.\nIn the closest tournament to date; Team USA won on the final evening of the contest, by 18–17.\nAfter the first day's play, Team USA led 4-2 and Europe's Paul Moor bowled the first perfect game in the Weber Cup to start the competition against Jason Couch. The only other European win in the first session came from Tomas Leandersson against Chris Barnes. Tommy Jones defeated Mika Koivuniemi, Tim Mack beat Tore Torgersen, Bill Hoffman triumphed over Jens Nickel and the Baker system game was won by Team USA.\nAfter day two Team USA led with what looked like an unassailable 12–6 lead. Europe took the final day's first session 5–0 to get back into contention at 11–12, before leading 14-13 going into the final evening session.\nBoth teams were tied 17-17 going into the final decisive baker system game, at one point Team Europe led by over 30 pins, with Mack and Hoffman failing to strike. The game became close (11 pins) and then in the ninth frame Tore Torgersen left a difficult split and missed, giving Tommy Jones the opportunity to step up and seal the victory for the Americans, and he duly obliged.\n2007.\nThe 2007 Weber Cup, was again a close affair, with Team USA running out eventual winners 17–15, coming back from 14 to 10 before the start of the final session.\nOn day one, in the fifth match, Tommy Jones rolled the second ever perfect game in the tournament's history, against Team Europe captain Tomas Leandersson, and at close of play, the scores were tied at 4 matches apiece.\nDay two was a day for the Americans, who won the Session 4–2 to take a 7–5 lead. Consolation for Team Europe came with the final Baker match, which they duly won. In the evening session, Team Europe fought back, to bring the scores back level at 9-9, again winning the final Baker match.\nTeam Europe started day three in blistering form, winning 5 of the 6 matches to take what looked like an unassailable 14–10 lead going into the final evening session, however Team USA had other ideas, and won seven of the eight games in the final session, with only Paul Moor for Team Europe winning his singles match against Team USA's captain Tim Mack.\nThis win extended Team USA's overall lead to 5–3 in the series.\n2008.\nThe 2008 Weber Cup took place once again at the Barnsley Metrodome, from 3 to 5 October 2008.\nBoth teams had familiar line-ups, which featured several Weber Cup veterans, including Tore Torgersen (Norway) for Team Europe, and Tim Mack for Team USA, who again captained his side.\nTorgersen was joined by Paul Moor (England), who was playing in his fourth Weber Cup. Finland's Mika Koivuniemi and Osku Palermaa also returned, and making his debut in the competition was Dominic Barrett from England. Palermaa was given the captaincy for Team Europe for the first time, taking over from Sweden's Tomas Leandersson.\nTeam USA featured four stars of the PBA tour, with Chris Barnes, Tommy Jones and Jason Couch returning for more Weber Cup action. They were joined by Pete Weber, who made his first appearance in the tournament named after his late father, legendary PBA star Dick Weber. \nTeam Europe (L-R)\nTeam USA (L-R)\nBefore the tournament, the overall score stood at 5–3 in favour of Team USA, so the Europeans were hoping for a win to prevent the gap extending further, however Team USA continued the trend of 3 consecutive wins, to make it 3 wins on the trot once more, just as they did in the first 3 tournaments. Team USA ultimately won 17–13, the largest margin of victory for 5 years. The winning point was won on the final baker team game.\nThe first session on Friday evening was shared, with both team winning three points each, and on the Saturday afternoon, Team Europe took the lead 7–5, before collapsing 5–1 in the evening session to trail 10-8 after the end of day two. Things did not improve for the Europeans on the Sunday, and they continued to trail 14-10 after the afternoon session. The final session started brightly for Team Europe, as they won the first two points, however a strong team effort from the Americans thwarted any comeback as they won three of the last four points, including the final baker team game, to claim victory once more.\n2009.\nA close-fought contest between the two teams, with the debut of Martin Laarsen into the European team, team Europe started to pull away from the USA towards the end. Tommy Jones completed his hat-trick of 300 games with three in three years at the Weber Cup\n2010.\nThe contest was full of drama with a baker game consisting of a European victory 156 - 154, one of the lowest scores in Weber Cup history. The teams were formed up of four players on each team meaning the dropping of Martin Larsen from Europe and Jason Couch for the USA. The tournament was won by the Europeans, captained once again by Osku Palermaa"

        "text": "David Leadbetter (born 27 June 1952) is a leading golf instructor, originally from Worthing in Sussex, England.\nCareer.\nLeadbetter began his career on the European and Southern African tours, but had little success as a player. Having an interest in the techniques, mechanics and psychology of the sport, he soon moved into instruction and came to wide notice in the 1980s when he rebuilt the swing of Nick Faldo, who then went on to win six major championships.\nLeadbetter now runs an international chain of golf academies headquartered at the ChampionsGate Golf Club in Davenport, Florida, U.S. which has 36 holes designed by Greg Norman. There are also branches elsewhere in North America and in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Since launching the first Leadbetter Golf Academy over 30 years ago, David has coached players to 26 Major Championship titles and over 150 individual worldwide tournament victories. Seven of those players have even held first place in the Official World Golf Ranking.\nLeadbetter himself concentrates on teaching tour professionals and on instructing other coaches in his methods, who then teach his ideas at his academies. Apart from Faldo his students include Nick Price, Charles Howell III, Michelle Wie, Lydia Ko and Byeong Hun An. Pros who formerly worked with Leadbetter included: Nick Faldo (1984–1998), Greg Norman (1997), and Ernie Els (1990–2008). He was ranked second to Butch Harmon on the 2005-2006 edition of \"Golf Digest's\" list of the \"50 Greatest Teachers\" in the United States.\nThroughout his career, Leadbetter has also written eight books about golf swings. He has also overseen the development of various golf training media, products and services, including the SwingSetter, SwingSetter Pro and a number of A Swing approved training aids released with the book. His books have sold two million copies making him one of the best-selling golf instruction authors in the world.\nTrained champions.\nThe following golfers whom Leadbetter coached went on to win the following tournaments:\nCriticism of Tiger Woods.\nIn February 1997, it was reported that Leadbetter criticized famous American golfer Tiger Woods, saying \"Right now, Tiger is a one-dimensional player who swings full on practically every shot...Another thing that will prevent Tiger from winning a major is pressure. There’s a big difference between winning at Las Vegas and winning at Augusta… He has to pay his dues.\" - - Tiger went on to win the Masters 2 months later by twelve strokes. More than two decades later, in December 2017, he questioned the hunger of the top male pros due to the money involved in golf now and also the media frenzy that follows Tiger Woods everywhere.\nVideo games.\nLeadbetter appeared in the 1992 video game \"David Leadbetter's Greens\", a MS-DOS port of \"MicroProse Golf\". He also appeared in the Wii-exclusive \"My Personal Golf Trainer\", released in the fall of 2010. \"Trainer\" is distinguished from other golf games on the platform by requiring the use of the Wii MotionPlus, while also supporting the Wii Balance Board, taking complete advantage of the Wii's motion controls and accessories to provide authentic golf training.\nPersonal life.\nLeadbetter and his wife, Kelly (an LPGA Tour professional), their sons Andy and James and their daughter Hally, live in Sarasota, Florida. He is also an endorser/spokesman for SAP, Callaway, Rolex, and Golf Pride grips."

He and Morris Lukowich were the two players protected by the Jets from the dispersal draft, showing the faith the team had in his abilities. However, the cold weather in Winnipeg exacerbated a chronic asthma condition and he requested a trade after a season there. The asthma condition ultimately forced him into retirement at the age of 25 after briefly also playing for the St. Louis Blues.\nPost hockey.\nAfter retiring from professional hockey, Campbell became involved in harness racing and found success as a stable owner.

        "title": "Mystic River Rugby Club",
        "text": "The Mystic River Rugby Club, sometimes called Boston Mystic, is a New England Rugby Football Union (NERFU) club, founded in 1974, located in Malden, Massachusetts, and Melrose, Massachusetts, who field teams in Division 1 American Rugby Premiership and Division 2 Rugby Union in the United States and are the current 2018 USA Rugby D1 National Champions.\nTheir home field is located at Pine Banks Park. Their primary sponsor is Coors Light.\nHistory.\nThe early years (1970s).\nThe Mystic River Rugby Club was founded in 1974 by 32 members of the Boston Rugby Club, who in true revolutionary spirit, took a great step forward in exercising their independence. These men had long since functioned as a ‘club within a club’ and had developed a distinct style of play both on and off the field. These members were experienced rugby players and immediately the Mystics established a schedule within the first division of New England. They soon became a sought after fixture by teams from all over based on a reputation for hard, fast rugby and an aggressive “joie de vie”.\nThe club evolved throughout the 1970s with the influx of younger players and Tours to Wales and the former Soviet Union highlighted these years. In 1978, the Mystics became the first American rugby team to be invited to play rugby in the Soviet Union. In the early 1980s the club saw a major turnover, a somewhat generational change, when several new players were attracted from local colleges. Old Boys rugby began to take shape and several of the original Mystics began playing a schedule of \"over 30s\" rugby. In 1986 the Mystics returned to Malden, Massachusetts, where they were originally incorporated in 1976.\nThe 1990s: The birth of a dynasty.\nWith several of the club's players regularly representing New England and the East Coast in representative side play, the Mystics were committed to championship level rugby. Their reputation earned them respect overseas as well, with touring sides, such as the Glamorgan County RFC, seeking a challenge at top level rugby.\nIn 1989, Mystic River defeated their parent club Boston to win the first of seven straight New England championships.\nThey would go on to win the Northeast Championship that same year. In 1992 the Mystic finished second in the US, losing to the Old Blues from California in the National Finals. The Mystics had established themselves as a force within the national rugby community.\nThe 2000s.\nIn 2000 and 2001, Mystic River competed in the short lived Major League Rugby (a former amateur club competition not to be confused with the current professional Major League Rugby competition). Set up in the manner of the European Rugby Champions Cup, the MLR was designed to provide an additional competition structure for top division teams outside of their usual geographical unions and complement their USA Rugby competition schedule, however, it was never sanctioned by USA Rugby and the Mystics returned to competing solely in USA Rugby competition in the fall of 2001.\nThe 2007 season saw the Mystics win their first New England title after twelve years, moving on to take the Northeast Championship in 2008 and a spot in the National Division 1 Sweet 16. In their 2009–2010 season, Mystic River again took both the New England and Northeast Championships, making it through to the quarter-final round of the USA Rugby DI National Championship Series as well as making their first ever appearance in the National Sweet 16 in 7s competition. 2010 also marked the expansion of the Mystic River Youth Rugby Program and the addition of the U-19 Mystic Eagles, who saw success in both 15s and 7s tournaments in their inaugural season.\n2014 merger with Middlesex.\nIn 2014, Mystic River merged with cross-town rivals, the Middlesex Barbarians, in an effort to develop the game of rugby in the area. While the details of the merger allowed the forty-year-old rugby club to retain their name, Middlesex coach Josh Smith took over head coaching duties for the combined club, with former Eagle prop Jake Sprague as forwards coach, and Glen Mannering directing the backs, with the club now competing in both Division 1 and Division 2.\nAs the 2014–2015 season came to a close, the newly formed Mystics went undefeated at the top of the Division 1 table going into the playoffs. Post season wins against White Plains RFC and Kansas City earned them their first trip to the USA Rugby D1 Final Four tournament since 1992, while in D2 the Mystic Barbarians took the NERFU D2 Championship against division rival New Haven, eventually losing to New York Rugby Club in the USA Rugby D2 Round of 16 beginning a new era for Mystic Rugby.\nThe Mystics also saw success in 7s, qualifying for the 2015 USA Rugby Club 7s (USARC7) Championship Series for the second time in club history, losing in the Semifinal round to eventual tournament winners Seattle Saracens, but coming away with the bronze medal.\nAmerican Rugby Premiership (2015—present).\nBeginning in the 2015–2016 season, Mystic River became a \"de facto\" member of the American Rugby Premiership (ARP), joining Life Running Eagles and fellow Atlantic North D1 clubs Boston RFC, NYAC, Old Blue and the Boston Irish Wolfhounds in the reformatted elite competition.\nThough officially a member of the Atlantic North Division 1 Conference, the Mystics competed in the ARP and played all teams but Life. They finished their regular season with a record of 6 wins and 2 losses in their inaugural year in the elite competition, automatically securing a berth in the USA Rugby Championships quarter-final round as the number two seed in the Atlantic North Conference. A win over the Midwest Conference's number one seeded team would put the Mystics in the Final Four for the second year in a row, against ARP rivals Old Blue. In the final match of the Eastern Championship Series, a 10–5 win put Mystic River in the Division 1 National Championship for the first time since 1992. The Mystics would go to play the Western Conference Champions, the Austin Blacks in the USA Rugby Emirates Airline Club Men's Division I National Championship. After a hard-fought match, Mystic River won their first ever National Title by a score of 45–33.\nAt the beginning of the 2016–2017 season Mystic River became a full member of the ARP, making it through to the Eastern Division finals. However, they were knocked out by NYAC 14–24. The following season the Mystics were able shock the favored Norfolk Blues 36–22 to set up a revenge match with their New York rivals, beating NYAC 26—25 and earning a trip to the 2018 national championship game. In the final match, Mystic River were able to stay ahead of their Western conference counterparts, Belmont Shore RFC and win their second national title by a score of 25–24.\nBoston Mystics and Major League Rugby.\nMystic River, which was called Boston Mystic or Mystics in some press releases, were scheduled for several 2018 exhibition games in Major League Rugby (MLR). Though they were merely exhibition, these matches were the first taste of the MLR professional era in the New England market. In late 2018, the New England Free Jacks were announced as a 2020 expansion team in MLR and Mystic River subsequently became a main source of talent for the initial Free Jacks roster including head coach Josh Smith. For the Free Jacks' first exhibition match against Ontario in October 2018, there were 15 former Mystic River players on their roster, including coaches Smith and Kareem Afifi.\nNational / representative players.\nUSA Eagles.\nThis is a list of players who currently or have at one time played for the Mystics and have represented their country with the United States national rugby union team, also known as the Eagles, in rugby fifteens or sevens. Not represented in this list are the many Mystics who have been named to the Eagles' player pools or Junior sides over the years. For Rugby sevens players, (*) denotes tournament appearances such as World Rugby Sevens Series.\nAll-Americans (USA U-20/U-23).\nBelow is a list of players who have received Rugby All-American honors. The Collegiate All-Americans rugby team is considered the USA's U23 national team, while the Junior All-Americans are the USA's U20 national team.\nOther Nations / Provinces.\nThis is a list of Mystic River players who have represented other nations in rugby union fifteens or sevens, unless otherwise indicated. Players marked with a \"♦\" represented other nations in rugby league.\nU19/Youth rugby.\nMystic River founded their Youth Rugby program in 2005. It was originally aimed more at introducing local children in the surrounding community to the sport of rugby, via American Flag Rugby (AFL) and later USA Rugby's newly developed \"Rookie Rugby\", a non-contact flag variant of the sport for younger children. In 2010, the Mystics expanded the program to include competitive U-17 and U-19 teams. Both levels saw immediate success, quickly becoming perennial contenders and medalists in such competitions as the Bay State Games.\nThe Mystics also field a Collegiate Select Side which selects stand out local collegiate rugby talent and plays teams both in the United States and abroad. In 2015, several former members of the Mystic Youth program would go on to receive collegiate All Conference honors.\nAfter an undefeated season in 2017, the Mystic River U19 7s team accepted an invitation to the National High School Invitational 7s tournament held in Minneapolis, MN, marking the first time any Mystic youth program was invited to play in a national championship. The Mystics continued their undefeated record throughout the tournament and claimed their first ever national championship title."

        "title": "2008 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 2008 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament involved 64 teams playing in a single-elimination tournament to determine the 2007–08 national champion of women's NCAA Division I college basketball. It commenced on March 22, 2008, and concluded when the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers defeated the Stanford University Cardinal 64–48 on April 8, 2008, at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida.\nNotable events.\nThe preliminary rounds largely followed the seeding, with every number one and number two seed advancing to the regional finals. In the Greensboro and Oklahoma City Regionals, the top seeds Connecticut and Tennessee won respectively to head to the Final Four. Connecticut had to beat Big East rival Rutgers to make the advance. Tennessee' Candace Parker was injured in the game against Texas A&amp;M and had to leave twice, and be fitted with a sleeve to stabilize her shoulder. She still scored 26 points in a game which was won by only eight.\nIn the other two regionals, the two seeds prevailed. In the New Orleans Regional, LSU beat North Carolina to reach the Final Four for the fifth consecutive time, tying a record set by Connecticut between 2000 and 2004. In the Spokane Regional, Stanford beat the top seed Maryland to go to their first Final Four since 1997, but one that would be the first of a five-year string of consecutive Final Four appearances.\nConnecticut and Stanford met in one semifinal. They had played each other earlier in the season at the Paradise Jam held in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands in November. The Huskies had won that game 66–54, but the team had been at full strength. Subsequent to that game Mel Thomas and Kalana Greene both starters, had season ending injuries. Connecticut cut a Stanford lead to a single point, 47–46 when Candice Wiggins hit two three-pointers to start a 10–0 run. Wiggins would go on to score 25 points in the game and would be named the Women's Basketball Coaches Association national player of the year. The Cardinal went on to win the game, and advance to the national championship.\nThe game between SEC foes Tennessee and LSU didn't win style points, and was described by the New York Times as \"one of the ugliest games played this or any season\". Tennessee led early opening up a ten-point lead at 37–27, but LSU responded with a 10–0 run to tie the game. With seconds left in the game LSU hit two free throws to take a one-point lead. Tennessee inbounded the ball to Candace Parker who passed it inside to Nicky Anosike, but her shot was deflected to Alexis Hornbuckle, who had missed seven of her field goal attempts. With under one second remaining, Hornhuckle caught the deflection and hit the winning basket. The Lady Vols won 47–46, as the two teams combined scores set an NCAA record for the fewest points scored in a semifinal game.\nLSU fell to 0–5 in the Women's Final Four. Combined with the 0–6 mark of the men's team, LSU's 0-11 all-time combined Final Four mark was the worst for schools which have made multiple appearances in both the men's and women's Final Fours. LSU's women ended this drought by defeating Virginia Tech in the 2023 national semifinals.\nAfter the drama of a one-point game in the semifinal, the final game was anticlimactic. The Lady Vols pulled out to a 30–19 lead, and the Stanford Cardinal were unable to close the gap. The win gave Tennessee their second consecutive national championship and a career total of 982 wins, the most of any coach in basketball, men's or women's, along with eight national championships for coach Pat Summitt.\nSubregionals.\nOnce again, the system was the same as the Division I men's basketball tournament, with the exception that only 64 teams received bids, and there was no play-in game. Automatic bids were secured by 31 conference champions and 33 at-large bids.\nThe subregionals, which once again used the \"pod system\", keeping most teams at or close to the home cities, were held from March 22 to March 25 at these locations:\nThis was the fourth and final year that eight sites hosted subregional games. The committee, in September 2007, voted to return to the 16-site format for the early rounds starting with the 2009 tournament.\nRegionals.\nThe regions (once again named after the host cities, a practice begun in 2005) were held from March 29 to April 1 in the following regions:\nThe regional winners advanced to the Final Four, held April 6 and 8, 2008 at the Tampa Bay Times Forum, in Tampa, Florida, hosted by the University of South Florida. USF and the Tampa Bay Times Forum also hosted a first and second round Men's Tournament subregional on March 21 and 23. Also, akin to the men's tournament, at the regional sites, the NCAA installed floors that were custom made for the first time.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 2008 NCAA Tournament. Thirty-one conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 2008 NCAA tournament. Of these thirty-one automatic bids, a total of 30 teams receive automatic bids for winning their conference tournament championship. The Ivy League does not hold a tournament, so its regular season champion receives the automatic bid. Because Cornell, Dartmouth, and Harvard finished in a tie for first place, Ivy League rules called for a two-game stepladder playoff. Dartmouth defeated Harvard in the first game and went on to face Cornell for the automatic bid, which Cornell won 64–47.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nThirty-three additional teams were selected to complete the sixty-four invitations.\nBids by conference.\nThirty-one conferences earned an automatic bid. In twenty-two cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Thirty-three additional at-large teams were selected from nine of the conferences.\nBids by state.\nThe sixty-four teams came from thirty states, plus Washington, D.C. Texas had the most teams with six bids. Twenty states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nBracket.\nData source\n\"NOTE: All initials used are the same in the official NCAA Bracket in External Links listed below.\"\nFinal Four – St. Pete Times Forum, Tampa, Florida.\n\"Initials: GRE-Greensboro; SPO-Spokane; NOR-New Orleans; OKC-Oklahoma City.\"\nRecord by conference.\nNineteen conferences — Atlantic Sun Conference, Big Sky Conference, Big South Conference, Big West Conference, Horizon League, Ivy League, MAC, MEAC, Missouri Valley Conference, Northeast Conference, Ohio Valley Conference, Patriot League, Southern Conference, Southland, SWAC, Sun Belt Conference, Summit League, WAC and West Coast Conference — went 0–1."

Whilst the game tends to be annoyingly accurate on higher settings, just persuade a friend to play to even up the challenge.\" \"The Times\" also gave the game a score of four stars out of five and said that \"Rugby, with its elaborate set-pieces and impenetrable laws, is a hard game to render on computer, but this is an extremely good try.\" \"The A.V. Club\" gave the PS2 and Xbox versions a B, saying that the game \"isn't as pretty as the bigger EA Sports games, but it isn't as larded down with excess crap, either; just lots of teams, lots of tournaments, and what we'll assume are famous players in a good tough sport.\""

He led the team in scoring his sophomore year with 19.4 points per game. His junior year, the Blue Devils went undefeated, won the state championship, and were named national champions. He was named to both all-state and All-America teams, while leading the team in assists. Douglas nearly led the team to another undefeated season his senior year. The team finally lost the 1982 semifinal game, after a then-state record 64-game winning streak. The team ended up with a third-place trophy, Douglas's third top-four state finish in his four years.

        "text": "Peter Jackson (22 September 1930, in Birmingham – , in Solihull) was an rugby union international who played on the wing for Coventry and Warwickshire for many years.\nHe earned the nickname 'Nijinsky' after the Russian ballet dancer. He was devastating when he had the ball to hand and could sidestep or outpace a defender with equal facility.\nHe scored three tries in the 1957 Five Nations Championship and helped England to their first Grand Slam since the Twenties. In 1958 against at Twickenham, he demonstrated his mastery of the feint to score a dazzling match-winning try. He was capped twenty times in all for England.\nHe then amazed the All Blacks on the 1959 Lions tour, scoring 16 tries in 14 games, including four test matches. He was described by one journalist as 'the zaniest runner of all time'.\nPeter Jackson suffered a stroke in the early months of 2003, was hospitalised and would suffer another stroke in the summer of 2003. He died in hospital in March 2004."

        "text": "The men's 200 metre backstroke event for the 1976 Summer Olympics was held in Montreal. The event took place on 24 July. There were 33 competitors from 23 nations, with each nation having up to 3 swimmers. The event was won by John Naber of the United States in world-record time; he was the first person to swim the event in under 2 minutes (1:59.19). It was Naber's fifth medal (fourth gold) of the Games: completing a double in the backstroke events as well as golds in the medley relay and the 4×200 free relay, along with a silver in the 200 free. It was the second American victory and second American medal sweep in the men's 200 metre backstroke, after 1968; of the 12 medals from 1968 through 1976, 10 were won by Americans and the other two (both gold) by Roland Matthes. Peter Rocca (silver) and Dan Harrigan (bronze) were the other two Americans, along with Naber, to reach the podium in 1976. The rules changed in 1984 to limit nations to two swimmers each, preventing further sweeps.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nOne of the 8 finalists from the 1972 Games returned: seventh-place finisher Zoltán Verrasztó of Hungary. Two-time reigning Olympic champion, world champion, and world record holder from 1970 to a month before the Games Roland Matthes of East Germany was entered in the event but did not start. The favourite was John Naber of the United States, who had broken Matthes' world record at the U.S. Olympic trials as well as beating Matthes in the 100 metre backstroke event five days earlier. Matthes had won the inaugural World Championship in 1973, with Verrasztó second and Naber third; Verrasztó was the World Champion in 1975.\nBulgaria, Poland, and Portugal each made their debut in the event. The Netherlands made its fifth appearance, the only nation to have competed at each appearance of the event to that point (Italy did not compete in the event for the first time).\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats and final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 5 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used backstroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1964 Summer Olympics.\nThe heats saw two swimmers break the Olympic record: Dan Harrigan in heat 2, with 2:02.25, then John Naber in heat 5 with 2:02.01. In the final, Naber broke the world record and the 2-minute barrier, swimming 1:59.19. Peter Rocca, in second-place, was also under the previous world record time.\nResults.\nFinal.\nNaber set a strong pace to start, hitting the 50-metre turn at 27.73—already a full second ahead of Rocca and Harrigan. Naber's second turn, at 100 metres, came at 57.45 (which would have been 5th place in the 100 metre final) and pushed his lead further. In the final 50 metres, Rocca closed the lead somewhat; he finished with what would have been a new world record except that he was still 1.36 seconds behind Naber."

He was the head coach of the DePaul Blue Demons from 1984 to 1997 and the Asheville Altitude in the NBA Development League (NBADL) from 2001 to 2005 before they moved to become the Tulsa 66ers, where he coached from 2006 to 2008. With Asheville, he became the only coach to win back-to-back league championships. He then coached Fort Wayne Mad Ants in the NBADL. He is currently the circuit's all-time leader in victories (226) and losses (237). He provided color commentary on radio broadcasts of Northwestern University men's basketball games on WGN-AM in Chicago.\nDePaul Blue Demons.\nAs a player, Meyer was captain of the . He was drafted in the 18th round of the 1971 NBA draft by the Buffalo Braves. Meyer was an assistant coach at DePaul for eleven seasons under his father, Ray Meyer. Ray Meyer coached DePaul from 1942 to 1984, winning 724 games and leading the Blue Demons to winning records in 37 of his 42 seasons, including seven NCAA men's basketball tournament appearances in his last nine seasons. When Ray Meyer retired in 1984, Joey Meyer was promoted to head coach.\nJoey Meyer led DePaul to seven NCAA Tournament appearances in his first eight seasons, including back-to-back Sweet Sixteen appearances in his second and third seasons. In the 1986 tournament, #12-seeded DePaul—led by freshman guard Rod Strickland (14.1 ppg season average) and junior Dallas Comegys (13.8 ppg) – upset #5-seeded Virginia and #4-seeded Oklahoma in the East regional before losing to top-seeded Duke 74–67. In 1987, the Blue Demons—again led by Comegys (17.5 ppg) and Strickland (16.3 ppg) – finished the regular season 26–2 and received a #3 seed in the Midwest regional of the 1987 tournament. They defeated #14-seeded Louisiana Tech and #6-seeded St. John's before losing to #10-seeded LSU. Meyer was honored as the Chevrolet Coach of the Year in 1987. Besides seven NCAA tournament appearances, Meyer led the Blue Demons to three appearances in the National Invitation Tournament.\nIn both 1988 and 1989, DePaul reached the second round of the NCAA tournament, but they were on a downward trajectory. In 1992, the Blue Demons were co-champions of the newly formed Great Midwest Conference but made their last NCAA tournament appearance under Meyer. An 11–18 finish in 1996 which was the first losing season since 1971 was followed by a 13-game losing streak to end a program-worst 3–23 in 1997. Meyer was fired on April 28, 1997, and replaced by Pat Kennedy months later on June 12.\nAmerican Basketball Association.\nMeyer began his professional basketball head coaching career with the Chicago Skyliners of the American Basketball Association, leading them to a 29–11 record and the Western Conference championship in 2000–01. After defeating the Indiana Legends 119–105 on April 12, 2001 and the Kansas City Knights 106–105 on April 13, the Skyliners lost the championship game to the Detroit Dogs 107–91 on April 14.\nNBA Development League.\nIn 2001, he joined the NBA D-League with the Asheville Altitude, winning back-to-back league championships in 2004 and 2005; After the franchise moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma to become the Tulsa 66ers, following its second title, Meyer continued to coach the team until the end of the 2007–08 campaign.\nMeyer was named the head coach of the Fort Wayne Mad Ants on June 3, 2009. During his first two seasons with the Mad Ants, the ballclub went 22–28 in 2009–10 and 24–26 in 2010–11. The team's 5–10 start to the 2011–12 campaign led to his dismissal on January 6, 2012. Meyer later worked as a basketball broadcaster for WGN-AM and as a scout for the Los Angeles Clippers.\nMeyer's son, Brian, was an NBA scout with the Chicago Bulls.\nPersonal life.\nDeath.\nMeyer died on December 29, 2023, at the age of 74. A funeral service was held at the St. Vincent de Paul Church and Meyer was laid to rest in the All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, IL on January 4, 2024."

        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle event at the 1976 Summer Olympics took place between July 24 and 25. This was the first time in history that the 100m freestyle was swum under 50 seconds. There were 41 competitors from 27 nations. Nations had been limited to three swimmers each since the 1924 Games (except in 1960, when the limit was two). The event was won by Jim Montgomery of the United States, the nation's second consecutive and tenth overall victory in the men's 100 metre freestyle (most of any nation). His countryman Jack Babashoff took silver. Peter Nocke's bronze was the first medal for West Germany in the event, though the United Team of Germany had won a bronze in 1964 (by West German Hans-Joachim Klein).\nBackground.\nThis was the 17th appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nThree of the eight finalists from the 1972 Games returned: bronze medalist Vladimir Bure of the Soviet Union, seventh-place finisher Michel Rousseau of France, and eighth-place finisher Klaus Steinbach of West Germany. Reigning gold medalist Mark Spitz had retired after the 1972 Games at the age of 22. The new American favorite was Jim Montgomery, who had set the world record at the 1975 AAU championships. His main challenger would have been Jonty Skinner, but apartheid South Africa was banned from the Olympics. Montgomery had finished third at the 1975 world championships behind Andy Coan (not competing in Montreal) and Bure.\nBulgaria, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and the Virgin Islands each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 17th appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a three-round (heats, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952, though with 2 semifinals. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 6 heats, with between 6 and 8 swimmers each. The top 16 swimmers advanced to the semifinals. There were 2 semifinals of 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of two lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nJim Montgomery broke the world record in the first semifinal, posting a 50.39 second time. In the final, he was the first swimmer to break the 50-second barrier, winning in 49.99 seconds for the new world record."

In the 1975–76 season, Orr was named National Coach of the Year.\nEarly life and playing career.\nOrr was born in Taylorville, Illinois or Yale, Kansas and grew up in Taylorville during the Great Depression. Orr attended Taylorville High School under coach Dolph Stanley and in his senior year (1944) led the \"Tornadoes\" to a state championship and a 45–0 record, the first team to ever finish a season undefeated in the Illinois High School Association's history. In 2007, Orr was voted one of the \"100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament,\" recognizing his superior performance in his appearance in the tournament. After high school Orr went to the University of Illinois and was the youngest freshman to compete in three sports. After joining the United States Navy for the end of World War II, Orr returned to the college game at Beloit College. This reunited him with his high school coach Dolph Stanley, who had come to Beloit College as athletic director, head basketball and football coach.\nOrr was initially drafted in 1948 BAA draft by the Minneapolis Lakers of the Basketball Association of America, the precursor to the NBA. Orr did not play for the Lakers, and was again drafted the next year in the 2nd round by the St. Louis Bombers. In 1950, Orr played 21 games for the Bombers before moving to the Waterloo Hawks for 13 more games.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1951, Orr was named as head coach at Dubuque Senior High School in Dubuque, Iowa, holding the position until 1959. In 1959, Orr joined the collegiate ranks, becoming an assistant coach at Wisconsin.\nUMass.\nOrr attained his first collegiate head coaching position in 1963 at UMass, where he guided the team to 15–9 record in 1963–64.\nMichigan.\nAfter three seasons at UMass, Orr moved to the University of Michigan in 1967, serving as an assistant under head coach Dave Strack for one season.\nIn 1968 Orr was named head coach at Michigan, a position he would hold for 12 seasons. His 1973–74 team made it to the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament and Orr was named Big Ten Coach of the Year. In 1976, Michigan was the NCAA tournament runner-up (to the undefeated Indiana Hoosiers) and Orr was named National Coach of the Year. His 209 wins were the most in Michigan history until John Beilein passed him in 2017.\nIowa State.\nOrr left Michigan to become the head coach of the Iowa State Cyclones in 1980, a program that had only one postseason appearance of any sort in school history, when it went to the Final Four in 1944. Orr would go on lead the team to six NCAA Tournaments in 14 seasons. The surprise move to Iowa State in 1980 came about when the Iowa State athletic director called to inquire about Orr's assistant, Bill Frieder. When Orr learned how much Iowa State was willing to pay Frieder, Orr negotiated the job for himself. Iowa State initially paid Orr $45,000 annually compared to his $33,665 salary at Michigan. Frieder then would succeed Orr at Michigan. In Orr's fourth season in Ames, Orr led the Cyclones to the 1984 NIT–only the second postseason appearance of any sort in school history. The following season, he led the Cyclones to their first NCAA Tournament berth in 40 years. The following season, Orr's Cyclones reached the Sweet Sixteen of the 1986 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament with a second round victory over the number five ranked team in the nation, Michigan. Orr claims this was the greatest victory of his career. Orr led Iowa State to four more NCAA tournament berths before retiring from Iowa State in 1994. He remains the winningest coach in Iowa State history with 218 wins.\nHilton Coliseum.\nOrr's Iowa State teams won 76.7% of their games at Hilton Coliseum. Under Orr, attendance numbers more than doubled from the 6,000 fan average that preceded his arrival. The school band would play the theme from The Tonight Show as Orr entered the arena floor before each game and Orr would give a fist pump to the Iowa State crowd. Orr coached Iowa State to 20 victories over teams ranked in the top 25 at Hilton, with writers coining the term “Hilton Magic.” \nCurrently at Hilton Coliseum, Iowa State donors have access to \"Johnny's\", a sports bar themed space on the east side of Hilton Coliseum. There are multiple flat-screen TVs as well as food served before the game and snacks served at halftime. Alcoholic beverages are served at the bars. A statue of Johnny Orr sits at the entrance along with cases full of memorabilia from his tenure at Iowa State.\nDeath.\nOrr died on December 30, 2013, at the age of 86 at Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines. Orr suffered from complications from a head injury from a fall at home.\nAwards and honors.\nTaylorville High School Hall of Fame (athlete) \n1969 – Beloit College Hall of Fame (athlete) \n1973 – National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Hall Of Fame (Athlete) \n1973 – Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame \n1973–1974 – Big Ten Coach of the Year\n1975–1976 – National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) National Coach of the Year \n1992 – Dubuque Senior High School Hall of Fame \n2001 – Iowa State University Hall of Fame \n2004 – Des Moines Register Hall of Fame \n2011 – Statue erected in Hilton Coliseum\n2011– University of Michigan Hall of Honor\nCareer statistics.\nPlaying career.\nNBA.\nSource"

        "text": "Darts were a nine-piece British doo-wop revival band that achieved chart success in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The London-based band had a number of UK top 20 hits including three successive number twos with revivals of early US rock and roll, R&amp;B and original songs.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1976, by Den Hegarty along with Griff Fender (real name: Ian Collier), Rita Ray (real name: Lydia Sowa) and Horatio Hornblower (real name: Nigel Trubridge), all former members of the band Rocky Sharpe and the Razors (pre-Rocky Sharpe and the Replays). Joining the band was Iain \"Thump\" Thomson, George Currie and John Dummer, all ex-members of the John Dummer's Blues Band. The line-up was completed by William \"Hammy\" Howell and ex-Mickey Jupp singer Bob Fish. They built up a large following playing clubs and universities, although their break came after they appeared on Charlie Gillett's show on BBC Radio London in October 1976. This secured the band a recording contract with Magnet Records, where they were teamed up with record producer Tommy Boyce who had previously produced The Monkees.\nCovering 1950s rock and roll hits, they scored their first UK hit in November 1977 with a medley of \"Daddy Cool\" (originally the b side of the single 'Silhouettes', a US 1955 hit for The Rays) and Little Richard's 1957 hit \"The Girl Can't Help It\". More cover versions followed in 1978 with \"Come Back My Love\" (originally recorded by US R&amp;B group The Wrens in 1955), and \"The Boy from New York City\" (originally a US hit for The Ad Libs in 1965). Their next single of 1978 was an original song \"It's Raining\" written by band member Griff Fender (real name Ian Collier).\n\"Come Back My Love\", \"The Boy from New York City\" and \"It's Raining\" all reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart.\nFollowing \"It's Raining\" in September 1978, Hegarty left the band to tend to his terminally ill father, and he was replaced by the American singer, Kenny Andrews. Their final hit of 1978 was \"Don't Let It Fade Away\" (written by Currie). \"Get It\" (written by Trubridge), followed in early 1979 and they also covered Gene Chandler's US 1962 hit \"Duke of Earl\", produced by former Wizzard frontman Roy Wood. This was their last UK top 10 hit, their only other sizeable hit coming in 1980 with a cover of The Four Seasons \"Let's Hang On!\". During the year, the line-up changed with Currie, Fish and Dummer leaving the band. Duncan Kerr (guitar) and Keith Gotheridge (drums), both formerly with Plummet Airlines joined, and ex-Mud guitarist Rob Davis briefly joined the band, before moving into songwriting and production work. Another later member was Mike Deacon (ex-Suzi Quatro band) on keyboards. By the end of 1980, their hits had dried up and in 1983 they began to do theatre work appearing and being musical directors of the theatre production of \"Yakety Yak\".\nIn 1979, Hegarty became a television presenter, first with the Newcastle upon Tyne-based \"Alright Now\", and later as part of the team fronting the children's programme \"Tiswas\". In 1985, Fender and Ray managed and produced the UK \"a cappella\" female group The Mint Juleps who scored two minor UK chart entries with \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" (originally by Neil Young) in 1986 and \"Every Kinda People\" (originally by Robert Palmer) in 1987.\nThe band remains in the Top 500 selling list according to the \"Guinness Book of British Hit Singles\".\nThe band reformed in 2006 for occasional appearances. On 21 August 2021 founding member Bob Fish died from an undisclosed illness aged 72."

He was signed by the Washington Redskins as an undrafted free agent in 2001. He played college football at Penn State.\nWatson also played for the Cincinnati Bengals.\nEarly years.\nWatson attended Harrisburg High School in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and was a letterman in football, basketball, and track. In football, he was a prep All-American and an Associated Press all-state pick in 1995. In his senior season, he ran for 1,495 yards and 23 touchdowns. After his senior football season, he participated in the 1996 Big 33 game.\nCollege career.\nWatson was a multi-purpose player at Penn State, playing tailback, wide receiver and kick returner. He was part of the Penn State's infamous \"running back by committee\" during his senior season, sharing carries with future NFLers Larry Johnson, Omar Easy, and Eric McCoo. He holds two Penn State records: career kickoff returns (67) and career kickoff yardage (1,506 yards). His record for single-season kickoff yardage (522 yards) was broken in 2007 by A. J. Wallace with 581 yards.\nProfessional career.\nWashington Redskins.\nWatson signed with the Washington Redskins in 2001 as rookie free agent, making the active roster, but not playing in a regular season game, and ended the season on the practice squad. In 2002, he played in all 16 games for the Redskins, mostly in relief of injured Stephen Davis, finishing second on the team in rushing with 116 carries for 534 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He spent the 2003 preseason with Washington, but was released in final roster cuts on August 31.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nWatson then signed with the Cincinnati Bengals as a free agent on September 30, 2004 and played in eight games, mostly on special teams that season.\nBy the 2004 season, Watson had found his niche as an effective 3rd-down threat. He led Bengals running backs in receiving with 24 catches for 162 yards. His lone touchdown that season was quarterback Carson Palmer's first career touchdown pass on September 12 versus the New York Jets. Watson suffered a season-ending biceps injury in the 2005 season opener and was placed on injured reserve for the remainder of the season. He signed a one-year contract with the Bengals during the 2006 offseason and extended his contract three more years in March 2007.\nWatson saw significant playing time in 2007 due to injuries to starters Rudi Johnson and Kenny Irons. Watson led the NFL in rushing, week 7 versus the New York Jets, with three touchdowns and 130 yards on 31 carries.\nIn 2008, Watson saw action in the Bengals' first three regular season games, rushing seven times for 32 yards and catching two passes for three yards. He was inactive during Week 4 against the Cleveland Browns. The following week, the Bengals released Watson on October 4 to make room for wide receiver Chris Henry, who was coming off suspension.

        "text": "The MIAA Division 1A Boys' Ice Hockey Tournament, commonly referred to as the Super Eight, is an annual boys' high school ice hockey tournament held by the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) to determine the top boys' team in the state.\nThe tournament's future is in jeopardy. The Tournament Management Committee voted to not accept any Division 1A tournament proposals until at least the 2025–26 academic year. If the MIAA Board of Directors votes to side with the TMC, then no Division 1A boys' ice hockey tournament would be held until 2026 at the earliest. The Ice Hockey Committee will appeal the decision.\nHistory.\nThe Super Eight is a double-elimination tournament that has determined the high school state champion since the inaugural 1991 tournament. The tournament features 10 teams. The selection committee seeds the teams 1 to 10. The tournament begins with two play-in games culminating with the finals played at TD Garden. The games leading up to the finals have been scheduled at neutral sites, including Tsongas Center, Chelmsford Forum, and other rinks in the state. The tournament is the basis for the creation of the Division 1A baseball tournament, which was established in 2014, to crown a state champion.\nOn March 12, 2020, the MIAA announced that the state finals games across all divisions scheduled for that weekend would be canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, Arlington and Pope Francis were both declared co-champions for the first time in the Super Eight tournament. The MIAA did not sponsor winter tournaments in 2021, thus no Super Eight was held.\nOn April 16, 2021, the MIAA Tournament Management Committee voted to accept the Blue Ribbon Committee's proposal that they will “not consider any applications for a 1A Tournament until July 1, 2025, to ensure MIAA sport committees can support their applications with four years of data under the new statewide tournament structure starting in the fall 2021 season.” The Blue Ribbon Committee cited \"consistency, equity, and Title IX compliance across all sports\" as the reasoning. The MIAA Division 1A Boys' Ice Hockey Tournament along with the Division 1A baseball tournament cannot return until the 2025–26 academic year if the committee votes to approve. The TMC believes that the 4-year gap will allow sports committees to gather substantial data with the new statewide tournament to better support their future proposals for a Division 1A tournament. However, the Board of Directors must approve the TMC vote before it becomes official.\nOn April 29, the MIAA Ice Hockey Committee announced that they will appeal the decision made by the TMC.\nTournaments.\n1991.\n^ Tournament Champion\n1992.\n^ Tournament Champion\n1993.\n^ Tournament Champion\n1994.\n^ Tournament Champion\n1995.\n^ Tournament Champion\n1996.\n^ Tournament Champion\n1997.\n^ Tournament Champion\n1998.\n^ Tournament Champion\n1999.\n^ Tournament Champion\n2000.\n^ Tournament Champion\n2001.\n^ Tournament Champion\n2002.\n^ Tournament Champion\n2003.\n^ Tournament Champion\n2004.\n^ Tournament Champion\n2005.\n^ Tournament Champion\n2006.\n^ Tournament Champion\n2007.\nThe ten teams to qualify for the 2007 Super Eight tournament are listed below.\n2008.\nThe ten teams to qualify for the 2008 Super Eight tournament are listed below.\n2009.\nThe ten teams to qualify for the 2009 Super Eight tournament are listed below.\n2010.\nThe ten teams to qualify for the 2010 Super Eight tournament are listed below.\n2011.\nThe ten teams to qualify for the 2011 Super Eight tournament are listed below.\n2012.\nThe ten teams to qualify for the 2012 Super Eight tournament are listed below.\n2013.\nThe ten teams to qualify for the 2013 Super Eight tournament are listed below.\n2014.\nThe ten teams to qualify for the 2014 Super Eight tournament are listed below.\n2015.\nThe ten teams to qualify for the 2015 Super Eight tournament are listed below.\n2016.\nThe ten teams to qualify for the 2016 Super Eight tournament are listed below."

        "text": "The Opening Ceremony of the 1982 Commonwealth Games was held on 30 September 1982 at the QEII Stadium in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nThe ceremony was directed by Ric Birch. The chairman for the XII Commonwealth Games was Sir Edward Williams, KBE, KCMG. Sir Edward was later decorated Australian of the Year for 1982.\nDescription.\nThe opening ceremony was held during a fine and sunny, but extremely windy and somewhat cool, afternoon. The starting of the Opening Ceremony was signaled with a kookaburra's call, followed by the traditional cry of \"cooeee\". Already on the field were two Commonwealth Games logos. After the announcement welcoming the audience to the opening ceremony, thousands of high school students dressed in red, white, or blue came running onto the field. Some of the children carried fabric placards while others picked up coloured boards once they were on the field. While the Opening Prelude / Commonwealth Games Song was performed by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra and the Sydney Philharmonia Choir), the children formed the Australian flag.\nAs this was breaking up, marching girls, wearing white and blue, green and black, or red and white, came along the athletics track from the right. From the left, came Surf Lifesavers bearing a variety of flags. The following music was played:\nThe high school students then formed red and blue circles, outlined in white, surrounded by a blue square. Again, on either side they formed the Commonwealth Games logo. The circles broke up to form a stylised map of Australia again surrounded by a blue square representing the sea. The map was the source of controversy as it omitted Tasmania.\nThe centre of the map was now filled with young people in the native costumes of the many different nationalities which make up Australia. While \"I Still Call Australia Home\" was playing, these young people stood in rows, holding hands, and swaying to represent waves on the sea.\nThe dances within the map included an ethnic folk dance medley of some of the countries from which some Australian people came. The dances were;\nAs the dancers ran out of the stadium Matilda the games' mascot entered and performed a lap of honour. Matilda was represented in both the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Games by a \"winking\" Matilda — a gigantic-size 13-metre (42 feet 8 inches) high mechanical kangaroo built around a forklift truck. As she travelled around the athletics track, she winked several times at the crowd, including a personal wink at the Duke of Edinburgh who was representing the Crown at the Ceremony.\nOnce her lap was completed, her pouch opened and children representing joey kangaroos ran out towards small trampolines which had been set up in the centre of the stadium. As they bounced, Rolf Harris, standing on the tray of a small truck wearing a sky blue leisure suit and with his trademark wobble board, performed a special version of \"Tie Me Kangaroo Down\" which included the added lyrics:\nAs the trampolines were moved out, Rolf Harris sang a slow-paced version of the song \"Waltzing Matilda\". Many of the crowd joined in during the chorus of the song. The children, meanwhile, had formed the Commonwealth Games logo in the centre of a blue circle. When the song finished, 50,000 red, white, and blue balloons were released. This was touted by Geraldine Doogue who was co-presenting the ABC's coverage of the event, as \"the largest balloon display ever\". Geraldine added that it had taken \"120 people ... five hours and 100 cylinders of helium and balloon gas to blow 'em up.\" The school children then left the field.\nAt approximately 3:35 pm, the Parade of Nations, which was estimated to run for 45 minutes, commenced, led by the athletes from Canada, which had hosted the previous games, with Australia's athletes coming in last. When the team from the Falkland Islands entered the stadium, they received an enormous cheer from the crowd because of the recently fought Falklands War.\nThe Commonwealth Games Ceremonial flag was brought into the stadium and raised. The Athlete's Oath was taken by Tracey Wickham.\nThe final runner in the Queen's Baton Relay was Raelene Boyle, who handed the baton to the Duke of Edinburgh. The Duke read out the message which Elizabeth II had sent in the Queen's Baton, officially opening the Games (the Duke opened the Games because the Queen was unable to arrive in Australia in time to attend the Opening Ceremony).\nBecause the Opening Ceremony was held during daylight hours, there were no fireworks to accompany the ceremony. However, doves, as well as the colourful balloons of red, white and blue, were released. There were also supposed to be parachute jumpers, with parachutes of red, white and blue, taking part during the display at the opening ceremony, with the parachute jumpers landing within the stylised map of Australia within the stadium, but it was too risky, because of the extreme wind conditions, to have this segment as the strong wind might have blown the parachute jumpers off course if they had jumped (the parachute jumpers appeared during the Closing Ceremony, instead).\nThe Queen, who arrived in Brisbane during the Games, presented some of the medals, including presenting the gold medal to Australian swimmer Tracey Wickham. The Queen also closed the Games.\nMatilda legacy following the Games.\nThe massive Matilda prop from the opening ceremony was relocated to Wet'n'Wild Water World, a water park in the Gold Coast hinterland. Matilda was dismantled for maintenance in 2007 but never reassembled. It was relocated and assembled at a Matilda fuel station at Kybong in 2011."

He was a two-time Pro Bowl selection in 1976 and 1977. In 128 career games, he totaled 393 receptions, 6,400 receiving yards, and 50 touchdowns.\nCollege career.\nWhite played at Grambling from 1972 to 1975, playing on the same team as future NFL quarterback and Super Bowl XXII MVP Doug Williams during his final two seasons. He was a first-team All-Southwestern Athletic Conference selection in 1973 and 1975. As a senior, White caught 37 passes for 802 yards and 17 touchdowns.\nPlaying career.\nWhite started each game of his rookie season of 1976, serving as both receiver and kick returner on occasion. In his first game against the New Orleans Saints on September 12, he caught three passes for 71 yards, with one of the catches going for a touchdown thrown by Fran Tarkenton. On November 7 against the Detroit Lions, he caught seven passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns. It would be the only time he had a 200-yard receiving game in his career and it currently stands as the team record for yards in a game. He closed out the season with a three-touchdown game against the Miami Dolphins. In total, he caught 51 passes for 906 yards for ten touchdowns. The Vikings, a perennial contender, were the hosts for a postseason run with White aboard for the ride. In the Divisional Round against Washington, he caught four passes for 64 yards, with two of them being for touchdowns as the Vikings rolled to a 35–20 victory. He was the starting receiver in the NFC Championship Game against Los Angeles, but he did not record a catch in the victory that saw them advance to Super Bowl XI. Playing the Oakland Raiders at the Rose Bowl, the Vikings did not lead at any point. During a 3rd down pass, White was trying to catch a pass from Tarkenton with DB Skip Thomas meeting him in the middle as safety Jack Tatum delivered a rough hit on White that knocked his helmet off. White left the game for a bit but returned to finish as the leading receiver for the Vikings, catching five passes for 77 yards with a touchdown to go with four kick returns for 79 yards in the 32–14 loss. White was named a Pro Bowler and awarded the Offensive Rookie of the Year Award, the second Viking to win the award.\nThe following season saw him catch 41 passes for 760 yards with nine touchdowns, which was good enough for a second (and last) Pro Bowl selection. In the playoffs, White didn't catch a pass in the Divisional Round versus Los Angeles that saw them play Dallas for the NFC Championship. White caught three passes for 46 yards with a kick return for 37 yards, but the Vikings lost 23–6. White, along with Randy Moss and Justin Jefferson, are the only wide receivers to make the Pro Bowl in their first two seasons with the Vikings. His third season (the first under the 16-game structure and also the last with Tarkenton as quarterback) saw him catch 53 passes for nine touchdowns on 741 yards. In the playoffs versus the Rams, he recorded no catches in the 34–10 loss. White played in 15 games for 1979 and caught 42 passes for 715 yards with four touchdowns as the Vikings (under newly installed starter Tommy Kramer) missed the playoffs for the first time in White's career. He caught 53 passes in 1980 for 887 yards with five touchdowns as the Vikings sneaked into the playoffs. Playing Philadelphia in the Divisional Round, White started the scoring off with a 30-yard reception for a touchdown. The Vikings had a halftime lead, but the Eagles eventually prevailed 31–16, with White catching only one further pass in the game. In the 1981 season, White had career highs in receptions and receiving yards, catching 66 passes for 1,001 yards that resulted in 3 touchdowns. In the strike-shortened 1982 season, he caught 29 passes for 503 yards and five touchdowns in six games. The Vikings reached the playoffs again and played in the Wild Card versus Atlanta. White caught a 36-yard pass (one of only two on the day) from Kramer to give the Vikings a 10–7 lead in the second quarter as the Vikings eventually won 30–24. White caught one pass in the ensuing Divisional Round loss against Washington, which was his last playoff appearance. In his next two seasons, he played less frequently, scoring five touchdowns combined. He closed out 1984 as just one of 44 players with 50 career receiving touchdowns. In his final season in 1985, he did not start a single game and caught eight total passes on the year.\nAfter retirement.\nAfter receiving an invitation to join the coaching staff at Grambling State from his old teammate Doug Williams, who became GSU's head coach in 1998, White worked as a receivers coach (1998-2003 and 2007–2009) and offensive coordinator (2004-2006). During that time Grambling won six Western Division titles and five SWAC championships. White was inducted into the SWAC Hall of Fame in 2004."

        "title": "Mark Murphy (American football executive)",
        "text": "Mark Hodge Murphy (born July 13, 1955) is an American football executive and former player who is the president and chief executive officer (CEO) for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). Murphy, a safety, went undrafted in the 1977 NFL draft after playing college football at Colgate University. He was signed by the Washington Redskins, where he played for eight seasons from 1977 to 1984. With the Redskins, Murphy won Super Bowl XVII, played in another Super Bowl and led the NFL in interceptions in 1983, the year he was named to his only Pro Bowl and received his only First Team All-Pro honor. During his last few years in the NFL he received a Master of Business Administration from American University and then, after his career ended in 1984, a Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown University in 1988. After his playing career, he worked for the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) and then as a trial lawyer for the United States Department of Justice. In 1992, he was hired as the athletic director of his alma mater Colgate University. In 2003, he moved to Northwestern University to serve as their athletic director, a position he held until 2007.\nIn December 2007, Murphy was announced as the next president and CEO of the Green Bay Packers, succeeding John Jones as president and Bob Harlan as CEO. He officially took over both positions in January 2008. During his tenure, the Packers have been highly successful on the field. Murphy's hiring coincided with quarterback Brett Favre leaving the team and Aaron Rodgers taking over. The Packers won Super Bowl XLV in 2011, made the playoffs eight straight seasons from 2009 to 2016, and Rodgers won four MVP awards. Murphy has only hired one new head coach and one new general manager in his tenure: Matt LaFleur and Brian Gutekunst, respectively. Off the field, Murphy oversaw two separate stock sales in 2011 and 2021 (the Packers are a publicly-owned, non-profit corporation) that funded two renovations of Lambeau Field. He also led the effort to purchase land adjacent to Lambeau Field and redevelop it into the Titletown District, a mixed-use development that supports tourism and provides year-around activities to local residents. In 2022, Murphy announced his intention to retire in 2025 when he turns 70 years old.\nEarly life.\nMark Murphy was born on July 13, 1955, in Fulton, New York and graduated from Clarence High School. At Clarence, Murphy was an all-star in three sports: baseball, basketball and football. His senior year, he was ranked 10th academically out of a class of 357 people. He also became the first person in school history to receive a \"white letter, as the outstanding performer in his sport, for all three [sports]\". During his last year of high school, he \"was named the best all-around athlete in western New York\".\nCollege.\nAfter high school, Murphy attended Colgate University where he received his bachelors degree in economics. While at Colgate, he played college football and baseball. Halfway through his freshman year, he became a starting defensive back. During his junior year, he led his team in interceptions and tackles, while helping Colgate to a record of 8–2. That year, he was named to the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Division I football all-star squad. During his college football career, he intercepted over 10 passes and was respected enough that opposing teams often did not throw the ball in his direction. \nMurphy completed post-graduate work from two universities. In 1983, while playing full-time in the NFL, he completed his Master of Business Administration from American University. Then, in 1988, he received his Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown University.\nNFL playing career.\nAfter deciding to focus on football, Murphy ended up going undrafted in the 1977 NFL draft. He signed shortly thereafter with the Washington Redskins as an undrafted free agent, primarily to serve on Special teams. In his first two seasons, Murphy played in 30 games, but did not start and did not record any defensive statistics (tackles were not officially recorded until 2001). He excelled on special teams as a rookie, including blocking a punt in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys. He did return three kick-offs for a total of 44 yards in his first season and caught one pass for 13 yards in his second. Murphy became a starter in his third season, beginning a run of four straight seasons where he started every game as the Redskins' starting safety. From 1979 to 1983, Murphy recorded 27 interceptions, six fumble recoveries and one forced fumble during the regular season. He added an additional interception and a fumble recovery in the playoffs. Over his career, Murphy played in 109 regular season games and 8 playoff games, all for the Redskins and the last four seasons under hall of fame head coach Joe Gibbs.\nMurphy was co-captain of the 1982 Washington Redskins team that won Super Bowl XVII during the 1982 strike-shortened NFL season. During the second half of the Super Bowl, Murphy recorded a critical interception that helped prevent the Miami Dolphins from opening up a larger lead. The Redskins ultimately scored 17 straight points to secure the victory. The 1983 NFL season was Murphy's finest of his career, though, as he led the NFL in interceptions with nine. The Redskins went on to play in their second consecutive Super Bowl, although they lost 38–9 to the Los Angeles Raiders. Murphy was named to the 1984 Pro Bowl and received first-team All-Pro honors. Murphy's last season with the Redskins was the 1984 NFL season, where he missed nine games due to a knee injury. At the end of the season, he was released by the team after contract negotiations became divisive. In 1984, Murphy won the \"Miller Man of the Year\" for his off-field work in the community.\nDuring his time with the Redskins, Murphy was the team's representative to the NFLPA. In this position, he became very active in the strike that shortened the 1982 NFL season. Many, including Murphy, felt that his prominent role in the players' strike led to his eventual release by the Redskins. In recognition of his achievements with the Redskins, he was named as one of the team's 70 Greatest players in history. He also is part of the organization's 50th Anniversary Team.\nProfessional career.\nNFL Players Association.\nAfter retiring from the NFL, he was hired by the NFLPA in 1985 as an assistant executive director. During his three years at the NFLPA, he worked on a player counseling program, drug testing, and collective bargaining and developed the agent certification system. By 1986, he had been promoted to vice president of the NFLPA. After his playing career and tenure with the NFLPA, Murphy was selected to serve on the Commissioner's Player Advisory Committee in 1994 and NFL Youth Football Committee in 2002.\nLawyer.\nMurphy worked for the Street Law Clinic in 1988, where he received an award for developing a program educating inmates on the law. He then was hired as a trial attorney for the United States Department of Justice from 1989 to 1992.\nAthletic director.\nMurphy returned to his alma mater, Colgate, in 1992 to serve as the university's athletic director. He held that position for 11 years until 2003. During his tenure, the football program had a complete turnaround. In 1995, the team went 0–11; the year after Murphy left, the team made the championship game. During his time, the team, which did not offer athletic scholarships, made the playoffs three straight years. The university also saw sustained success in other sports, including basketball, volleyball, softball, and ice hockey.\nIn 2003, Murphy left Colgate to take a position as the athletic director for Northwestern University. He held that position for four years until 2007. During his tenure, Murphy led a program with 19 sports, a $40 million budget and 160 employees. The sports program was highly successful, with eight national championships by individual athletes and three team titles. The football team saw increased success, winning two bowl games under Murphy, after only four in the university's history beforehand. Student-athletes at Northwestern were tied for the best graduation success rate in the country in 2007, Murphy's last year in charge of the program. In 2023, Murphy was named as a defendant in two lawsuits by former football players related to a hazing scandal that occurred during his tenure as athletic director.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nIn December 2006, Bob Harlan, the Packers president since 1989 announced his intention to retire. After a selection process was finalized, John Jones, the Packers senior vice president, chief operating officer and Harlan's handpicked successor was announced as the tenth president of the Packers. Harlan retained the CEO position for a year while Jones served as president, with both representing the Packers at NFL owner meetings that year. However, just days before he was due to take over, the Packers announced he was taking an indefinite leave of absence due to health reasons and concerns about performance in his role. Harlan stayed on as CEO and began another selection process. On December 3, 2007, the Packers announced Murphy as the organization's next president. Murphy officially began his tenure in January 2008, at the conclusion of the 2007 NFL season. The Packers had just come off and shortly thereafter, quarterback Brett Favre announced his retirement. However, similar to past seasons where Favre contemplated retirement, he took back his retirement announcement and expressed his intention to play in the 2008 NFL season. Ultimately, Favre requested an unconditional release from the Packers so he could play for another team. Murphy met with Favre in July 2008 to discuss a $20 million marketing agreement where Favre would work with the Packers but not as a player. Favre was reinstated into the NFL in August 2008 and planned to report to the Packers training camp. However, Favre and the team agreed that it was time for Favre to move to another team and he was ultimately traded to the New York Jets a few days later. Years later, Favre took responsibility for retiring too soon and credited Murphy with helping to restore his relationship with the Packers, which culminated with Favre being invited back to Lambeau Field to have his number retired by the Packers.\nFavre's successor at quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, completed his first season as a starter with a losing record of 6–10. However, his solid play impressed the team enough that he was signed to a six year, $65 million extension. Rodgers continued to improve and lead the team to success, with the 2009 season beginning a string of eight straight playoff berths. The Packers lost in the opening round of the 2009–10 playoffs, however the next year they made the playoffs as the sixth seed in the National Football Conference (NFC) and won Super Bowl XLIV. This victory likely made Murphy the first person to win a Super Bowl both as a player and as a team's chief executive. In 2011, Murphy was put on the NFL's bargaining committee to help negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. When negotiations failed, Murphy and other team owners locked the players out for four months. The lockout ended in July 2011 when a new agreement was reached. The next season, in 2012, Murphy and the other team owners failed to come to an agreement with the NFL referees, leading to the 2012 NFL referee lockout. An agreement with the referees was only reached after outrage from the infamous Fail Mary game between the Packers and Seattle Seahawks, where replacement officials were widely panned for their controversial decisions at the end of the game.\nOff the field, Murphy advocated for another stock offering to fund a $143 million expansion of Lambeau Field, which would add over 6,700 additional seats, better audio/video equipment and new entrance gates. The stock offering was authorized and began in 2011, running into 2012. The funds from the new 268,000 shares that were sold, as well as seat license fees, funded the renovation, which was complete in 2013. Almost immediately after the completion of the renovation, the Packers announced a second phase, paid entirely by the Packers. This renovation reconfigured the atrium, moved the Packers Pro Shop, relocated the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame and provided space for a new restaurant. Additional features included reconfigured outdoor spaces, new escalators and new player training facilities. In August 2015, Murphy and the Packers announced plans for a new Titletown District adjacent to Lambeau Field. This mixed-use development would provide new commercial space, residential housing, retail and public space. The Packers had been slowly purchasing property adjacent to Lambeau Field with the intention of developing it to provide additional year-round revenue streams and activation of the area during the off-season. Titletown District opened in 2017, with additional phases of development progressing in the subsequent years.\nThe 2017 season saw the Packers' consecutive playoff appearance streak end. After three consecutive losses dropped the Packers to 4–7–1 in the 2018 season, Murphy fired head coach Mike McCarthy and named Joe Philbin interim coach. After the conclusion of the season, Murphy hired Matt LaFleur to be the Packers' 15th head coach. Later in the year, General manager Ted Thompson announced that he would resign the position of general manager and step back into a special advisor role. Murphy promoted Brian Gutekunst, who was the Packers' director of player personnel, to the vacant general manager position. In addition to this hire, Murphy changed the way that the general manager and head coach report to the president. Instead of the previous linear reporting structure, Murphy had the head coach, the general manager and the executive vice president and director of football operations (who was Russ Ball at the time) all report directly to him. Although initially there was concern that this change would cause dysfunction, LaFleur helped lead the Packers to three consecutive seasons of 13 wins with Rodgers winning his third and fourth MVP awards in LaFleur's first two seasons. However, the Packers lost in the playoffs all three seasons, losing two consecutive NFC Championship Games and then in the .\nDuring this time period, the COVID-19 pandemic began and had major impacts on the NFL. The largest impact to the Packers was the playing of home games at Lambeau Field without any fans. All preseason and international games were cancelled, as well as the 2021 Pro Bowl. Murphy announced that for the first time the Packers would host the annual shareholder meeting fully virtual. Murphy also advocated for the ability for players to opt out of the season without impacting their contracts, a rule that was ultimately implemented. Additional safety measures included enhanced testing, expanded rosters and changes to how soon players could return off of injured reserve. Many of these mitigation measures continued into the 2021 NFL season, although fans were able to return to Lambeau Field with some mask requirements and other health mitigation measures. In 2021, Murphy announced the team's sixth stock sale. Approximately 190,000 new shares were sold, raising about $64 million to help fund improvements to the Lambeau Field concourse, new video boards and other infrastructure projects.\nMurphy found himself in a similar situation with Rodgers as he had been in 15 years prior with Favre. For a couple seasons, Rodgers began publicly discussing retirement, his future with the Packers and the possibility of ending his career with another team. This was exacerbated when the Packers selected quarterback Jordan Love with their first-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft. After the draft, the Packers publicly committed to Rodgers as the team's starting quarterback in the near future, however Rodgers felt the selection indicated the Packers were focused on their long-term future. After the 2021 season, Rodgers again contemplated moving on from the Packers. However, in March 2022, Murphy signed Rodgers to a large contract extension and publicly committed to him being the starting quarterback moving forward. However, the Packers had a poor 2022 season, with Rodgers having one of his worst statistical seasons as the Packers' starting quarterback. The Packers were 8–8 going into the last game of the season, with a win guaranteeing a playoff berth. However the Packers lost to the Detroit Lions, bringing their record down to 8–9 and thus missing the playoffs. After a couple months of contemplating his future, Rodgers announced his intention to play in the 2023 NFL season, noting his desire to play for the New York Jets. Just as he did in 2008, Murphy traded his star quarterback to the Jets and publicly supported the successor, in this case Love, as the Packers' new starting quarterback.\nIn July 2022, Murphy announced that he would retire on July 13, 2025, as that would be the day he turns 70. In May 2023, Murphy announced that for the first time the Packers would host the 2025 NFL draft. Murphy and the Packers had been working for years to bring the draft to Green Bay, with it likely occurring right before Murphy retires. As of 2023, the Packers have made the playoffs 11 times, reached the NFC Championship Game five times and won one Super Bowl during Murphy's tenure. The Packers' record since he became president is 156–93–2 during the regular season and 11–10 in the playoffs. Murphy noted that in his remaining years as president he would like to see Lambeau Field renovations completed, the Titletown District built out and continued on-field success.\nPersonal life.\nMurphy married his wife Laurie, who was also a Colgate graduate, and they have four children together. They are active in numerous local organizations, including multiple schools, churches and youth sports leagues. Financially, the Murphys have donated to organizations like the Milwaukee Public Schools Foundation, We All Rise Green Bay, Urban Triage and Maroon Calabash. Murphy also pledged to donate $250,000 to \"causes in Wisconsin that support social justice and racial equality\" following the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests. In 2023, Murphy and his wife purchased the Maxwell Braes Golf Course in Door County, Wisconsin, with the goal of preserving it and preventing it from being developed into housing."

        "title": "2005 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 2005 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament began on March 19, 2005, and concluded on April 5, 2005, when Baylor was crowned as the new national champion. The Final Four was held for the first (and last) time at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana on April 3 and 5, 2005, and was hosted by Butler University and the Horizon League. Future Final Fours will be held every five years in Indianapolis, the NCAA's home city, will be played at Lucas Oil Stadium, one block south of the Indiana Convention Center, where the RCA Dome is located. Baylor, coached by Kim Mulkey-Robertson, defeated Michigan State, coached by Joanne P. McCallie, 84–62 in the championship game. Baylor's Sophia Young was named Most Outstanding Player. For the first time, taking a page from the Men's Tournament, the regionals were named after the city they were played in, rather than the geographical location (East, Mideast, Midwest and West), and the \"pod\" system adopted by the Men's Tournament was used.\nNotable events.\nIn three of the four regions, the number one seed in the region advanced to the Final Four. In the Chattanooga Regional, 13th seeded Liberty upset both Penn State and DePaul to advance to the regional semifinal, but there encountered the top seed LSU, who won and went on to defeat Duke to advance to the Final Four in Indianapolis.\nIn the Philadelphia Regional, Tennessee faced Purdue in the second round. The victory represented the 880th win for coach Pat Summitt, moving her beyond Dean Smith 879 career victories, to claim the top spot in college basketball career victories. Rutgers upset Ohio State to advance to the regional final, but top seeded Tennessee won to advance. In the Kansas City Regional, top seeded Michigan State defeated the 2 seed Stanford to advance. The single exception was in the Tempe Regional, where second seeded Baylor upset North Carolina to earn a spot at the Final Four.\nIn one semifinal, Baylor faced LSU. Five years earlier, Baylor had won just seven games against twenty losses, and had never been to an NCAA Tournament. Then they hired Kim Mulkey, who coached the team to an NCAA berth in her first year, and now was coaching a team in the Final Four. However, thirteen minutes into the game, LSU led 24–9. The two teams had played before, in the opening regular season game for Baylor. In that game the Lady Bears found themselves down by 19 points at halftime. They almost closed the gap, but ended up with a one-point loss. This time, they found themselves down again by a large margin. Mulkey called a timeout, and the team responded with six straight points. Not long after, a three-pointer cut the lead to six, and they continued to chip away, reaching the halftime with the score tied at 28. After the break, LSU retook the lead, and were up by four points with just over eight minutes to play, but would go scoreless for five minutes. Baylor retook the lead, and held on to win 68–57 to advance to the championship game.\nIn the second semifinal, Tennessee faced Michigan State, who were playing in their first Final Four. The Lady Vols had a six-point lead at halftime, but extended the lead to 16 points with fourteen and a half minutes to go. Although the crowd had watched Baylor recover from a 15-point deficit earlier in the evening, that had occurred with 28 minutes to play. This time, the deficit was 16 and just over 14 minutes left. The Spartans cut into the lead, and with a minute to go had tied the game. At that point Kristin Haynie, who had only scored two points in the game, stole the ball and ran almost the length of the floor to score a layup and take the lead. Tennessee then missed three shots and Michigan State scored the final points of the game to tie the record for the largest comeback in NCAA Tournament history.\nThe final matched up two nontraditional names in women's basketball. Michigan State had never before advanced beyond the second round, and Baylor had but once, and was only in their fourth NCAA tournament ever. Baylor opened up a 19-point lead early, but no lead seemed safe after 15 point and 16 point comebacks in the semifinals. The lead ballooned to 23, then Michigan State attempted a comeback, but the Lady Bears were too strong, and went on to win their first national championship 84–62.\nLocations.\nSo as to decrease the number of games played on a competing team's home court, the subregionals were held at eight locations, rather than 16, for the first time. Furthermore, following the lead of the men's tournament in recent years, the 2005 women's tournament used the \"pod system\", keeping most teams at or close to the home cities, and were held from March 19 to 22 at these locations:\nThe regionals were held from March 24 to 27 in the following regions. The regionals, for the first time, were named after the city they were played in instead of a direction (East, South, Midwest, West).\nThe regional winners advanced to the Final Four, held on April 3 and 5, 2005 at the RCA Dome, in Indianapolis, Indiana, hosted by both Butler University and the Horizon League.\nQualifying teams - automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 2005 NCAA Tournament. Thirty-one conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 2005 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams - at-large.\nThirty-three additional teams were selected to complete the sixty-four invitations.\nBids by conference.\nThirty-one conferences earned an automatic bid. In twenty-one cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Thirty-three additional at-large teams were selected from ten of the conferences.\nBids by state.\nThe sixty-four teams came from thirty-one states, plus Washington, D.C. Texas had the most teams with seven bids. Nineteen states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nBrackets.\nData source\nRecord by conference.\nNineteen conferences went 0-1: America East, Atlantic Sun Conference\nBig Sky Conference, Big West Conference, Colonial, Horizon League, Ivy League, MAAC, MAC,\nSummit League, MEAC, Missouri Valley Conference, Northeast Conference,\nOhio Valley Conference, Patriot League, Southern Conference, Southland, SWAC, and West Coast Conference"

        "text": "The men's 10 kilometres was one of the five track cycling races on the Cycling at the 1896 Summer Olympics programme. It was held on 11 April and comprised 30 laps of the track. The 1896 Games was the only time that the 10 kilometres track race was part of the cycling program at an Olympic Games. Six cyclists from four nations competed. The event was won by Paul Masson of France, the second of his three victories that day (he had previously won the sprint and would shortly afterwards win the track time trial). His countryman Léon Flameng finished second, while Austrian Adolf Schmal was third.\nBackground.\nFrom 1896 to 1924 (excluding 1912, when no track events were held), the track cycling programme included events at a variety of distances that changed from Games to Games and ranged from the -mile to the 100 kilometres (and, even longer, the unique 12 hours race in 1896 that saw finishers exceed 300 kilometres). The 10 kilometres was held only in 1896. As with many of the 1896 cycling races, the French team was clearly favored as the strongest cyclists present.\nCompetition format.\nAs the name suggests, the race was 10 kilometres in length. The track was one-third of a kilometre in length, so the cyclists had to complete 30 laps. No pacemakers were allowed. The six cyclists started together.\nSchedule.\nThe exact time of the event is not known; the cycling events began shortly after 2 p.m. and the 10 kilometres was the second event, after the sprint. The day was very cold.\nResults.\nSix competitors entered the third cycling race. The two Frenchmen that had raced in the 2 kilometre sprint race finished in the top two positions in the 10 kilometres, with the finish coming down to a sprint won by Masson. Adolf Schmal of Austria finished third. Rosemeyer of Germany finished this race in fourth place. The two Greek cyclists collided two-thirds of the way through the race. Kolettis returned to the race for a while before quitting at the 7 km mark due to his injuries from the crash; it is not clear if Konstantinidis finished."

However, one of the two Frenchmen (Paul Masson) did not start the race and instead served as pacemaker for the other (Léon Flameng).\nCompetition format.\nAs the name suggests, the race was 100 kilometres in length. The track was one-third of a kilometre in length, so the cyclists had to complete 300 laps. Pacemakers were allowed in the event, though only Flameng and the Greeks had pacemakers. The nine cyclists started together in a mass start.\nSchedule.\nThe exact time of the event is not known. The day was very cold with a bitter wind that was not significantly affected by the low walls around the velodrome.\nResults.\nNine cyclists started the race, but only two finished it. During the race Georgios Kolettis's bike broke down. Léon Flameng stopped and waited for Georgio's bike to be repaired before continuing to race. Flameng had fallen midway through the race but continued on to win the gold medal. Kolettis of Greece had completed 289 laps at that point, and finished fairly soon after Flameng. While competing, Flameng raced with the French flag wrapped about his leg."

August von Gödrich of Germany took second, while Edward Battell finished third.\nBackground.\nThis was the first appearance of the event, which would not be held again until 1936 (though has been held at every Summer Olympics since then). It was an event of particular interest to the Greek hosts, as it followed the course of the marathon won by Spyridon Louis. Seven cyclists entered the event, including the German August von Gödrich, the British Edward Battell, and five Greeks. Battell, who worked at the British Embassy, almost did not get to compete; \"[s]ome British officials attempted to prevent him from entering the Olympic cycling events on the grounds that his job disqualified him as a gentleman, and thus he could not be an amateur.\"\nCompetition format.\nThe race was on a course that covered 87 kilometres, running from Athens to Marathon and back. At the turn-around point, the cyclists had to \"sign a document in the presence of an official, verifying that they had arrived there.\" The finish was at the velodrome. Officials were stationed all along the road.\nResults.\nKonstantinidis led from the start until after the turn at Marathon. His bicycle broke down on the return journey, allowing Battel time to pass him before he was able to get another bicycle and continue. Both Konstantinidis and Battel fell again before finishing, with Battel's fall being severe enough to drop him from first place to third as both Konstantinidis and Gödrich passed him."

        "text": "The men's sprint was one of the three cycling events, all track cycling, now regarded as \"Olympic\" on the Cycling at the 1900 Summer Olympics programme. It was held on 11 September and 13 September. The sprint, a 2000-metre race with 1000-metre heats, was conducted in four rounds. 69 of the 72 cyclists competed in the sprint, including cyclists from all six competing nations. The event was won by Albert Taillandier of France (the nation's second consecutive victory in the men's sprint), with his countryman Fernand Sanz in second place. John Henry Lake of the United States won the nation's first cycling medal with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the second appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. None of the cyclists from 1896 returned. Two of the three top sprinters in 1900 were French and competed: Ferdinand Vasserot and Albert Taillandier. (The third, Alphonse Didier-Nauts of Belgium, did not compete). An American, John Henry Lake, however, had finished second in the world championships to Didier-Nauts and was the most significant non-French competitor in the field.\nBelgium, Bohemia, Italy, and the United States each made their debut in the men's sprint. France and Germany made their second appearance, having previously competed in 1896.\nCompetition format.\nUnlike modern sprint events (which use a flying 200 metre time trial to cut down and seed the field, followed by one-on-one matches), the 1900 sprint used very large initial heats of up to eight cyclists each before smaller quarterfinals, semifinals, and final with three cyclists in each race. For the first round, the top three cyclists in each heat advanced; in the quarterfinals and semifinals, only the fastest man moved on. The distance for each race was 1 kilometre.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nLloyd Hildebrand set the initial record of 15.4 seconds in the first heat. Adolphe Cayron improved on that in the second heat, to 14.2 seconds. John Henry Lake dropped the record to 14.0 seconds in heat 6. Antonio Restelli finished the first round with a 13.6 second time in the ninth heat. Lake responded with 13.2 seconds in the first quarterfinal, only to see Restelli go 13.0 seconds in the fourth. Albert Taillandier dropped below that to 12.6 seconds in the next quarterfinal, a time that held through the rest of the 1900 Games.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe first round was held on 11 September. It began at 9 a.m. The top three cyclists in each of the 9 heats advanced to the quarterfinals.\nHeat 1.\nStratta was a wheel behind Hildebrand, with Vasserot very close after that.\nHeat 2.\nCoindre was a wheel behind Cayron; Daumain was not close.\nHeat 3.\nSanz was a half-length behind Gottron.\nHeat 5.\nDavis was a length behind Maisonnave.\nHeat 7.\nDohis was a wheel behind Taillandier, with Germain a close third.\nHeat 9.\nWick and Hubault fell and did not finish.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe quarterfinals were also held on the first day of competition, 11 September. They began at 2 p.m. Only the winning cyclist of each of the 9 quarterfinals advanced to the semifinals.\nQuarterfinal 1.\nStratta was three lengths behind Lake.\nQuarterfinal 2.\nBullier was two lengths behind Sanz.\nQuarterfinal 3.\nDuill was a wheel behind Coindre.\nQuarterfinal 4.\nHildebrand was a wheel behind Restelli.\nQuarterfinal 5.\nVincent was two lengths behind Taillandier.\nQuarterfinal 6.\nIn a very close race, Brusoni was a quarter-wheel behind Mallet.\nQuarterfinal 7.\nPonscarme was three lengths behind Maisonnave.\nQuarterfinal 8.\nDohis was a half length behind Vasserot.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were conducted on 13 September. The top cyclist in each of the three semifinals advanced to the final, guaranteeing himself a medal.\nSemifinal 1.\nLake had defeated Vasserot previously in 1900, at the world championships where the two had placed second and third to Léon Didier-Nauts. Lake won again in this match, with Vasserot a short length behind.\nSemifinal 2.\nRestelli was a half wheel behind Sanz.\nFinal.\nThe final was held on the same day as the semifinals, 13 September."

        "text": "The Australian Basketball Association (ABA) was a semi-professional basketball competition in Australia. The competition had five leagues under its banner during the 2000s operating as conferences: South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL), Queensland Basketball League (QBL), Central Australian Basketball League (Central ABL), Big V and Waratah League. The ABA's roots can be traced back as far as 1965 and operated under many different names and structures until 2008.\nHistory.\nIn 1965, the South Eastern Conference (SEC) was established. The SEC continued until 1971 when the Australian Club Championships gained pre-eminence. The Australian Club Championships ceased operations after 1980 due to the rise of Australia's first truly national competition, the National Basketball League (NBL).\nIn 1981, the SEC was reborn as the South Eastern Basketball League (SEBL). The competition was known as SEBL for seven seasons until being officially known as the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) from 1988 to 1991.\nIn 1994, the merger with the Queensland Basketball League (QBL) saw the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) grow to three conferences: North, South and East. In 1998, the CBA saw further expansion with the inclusion of a Central Conference from South Australia.\nThe CBA was restructured as the Australian Basketball Association (ABA) in 1999, and over the next two years, the Big V from Victoria (2000) and the Waratah League from New South Wales (2001) joined the ABA.\nStarting in 2002, the champions of each of the six conferences and a number of wildcard entries competed at the annual ABA National Finals. A brand change saw the Australian Club Championships (ACC) operate as the national finals series in 2007 and 2008.\nThe ABA and ACC was abandoned following the 2008 season, resulting in the SEABL, QBL, Central ABL, Big V and Waratah League continuing on as independent leagues."

        "title": "Grip (sport fencing)",
        "text": "In fencing, the grip is the part of the weapon which is gripped by the fencer's hand.\nThere are two types of grips commonly used today in competitive foil and épée: French, which is a straight grip with a pommel at the end of it, and the orthopedic or pistol grip. Virtually all high level foil fencers use a pistol grip; in épée, both types are used. Both kinds of grip optimize hitting with the point of the sword (a 'thrust'), which is the only way to score a touch with a foil or épée.\nThere are a number of grips which are no longer common or are currently illegal in competitive fencing. The Italian grip is legal but is not used commonly. A number of grips which combine a French grip pommel with pistol grip style prongs are illegal for competition. The rationale for these grips being illegal is that they would allow both the extended reach of the French and the added strength of the pistol grip.\nSabre, which is the only fencing weapon that allows \"cutting\" with the edge of the blade, has only one kind of grip, because of the way the blade is handled. Sabre grips are generally made of plastic, rubber over metal or plastic, wood, or leather wrapped over wood.\nFrench grip.\nThe French grip is straight or slightly contoured to the curve of the hand. It reached its modern form in the late nineteenth century. The French grip allows the fencer to \"post\", holding the grip towards the pommel, instead of holding the weapon near the bell guard. This gives the fencer a longer reach while reducing the power of beats and parries, and allows for an expanded repertoire of counterattacks and remises of attacks.\nA French grip may be bent or canted somewhat where the blade meets the grip, and it may be bent somewhat along its length. The grip may not be bent or canted so far as to take the pommel outside the cylinder formed by the bell guard.\nA substantial number of épéeists at all levels use French grips while posting to allow for longer reach. Posting is not a technique seen in competitive foil, as it decreases one's ability to parry successfully, and thus increases an opponent's chance of a successful hit or remise. As a result, the use of the French grip in competitive foil is extremely rare.\nPistol grip.\nA pistol grip is any grip with a special shape or protrusion intended to aid in holding the weapon. To be legal a pistol grip must fix the hand in one position, and the fencer's thumb must fall within 2 cm of the bell guard when the weapon is gripped.\nIn competitive fencing pistol grips are nearly universally preferred in foil, and are used by a large percentage of épée fencers because they allow stronger blade movements.\nTypes of pistol grips.\nWhile individual manufacturers have variations in shape, pistol grips can be classed into a few broad types:\nIllegal or little-used variations.\nA number of grip variations are either no longer used or are no longer legal to use in competitive fencing.\nThe Italian grip is legal but is not commonly used in modern fencing. Some view it as a transitional step on the path to the pistol grip, but in fact it is derived from the rapier grip and basically unchanged since the 18th century, predating the modern sport of fencing.\nThe names of illegal grips are applied inconsistently and have some overlap with uncommon but legal grips. Rules organizations usually do not list names of grips as legal or not, but rather list general characteristics. In general, aside from the Italian grip, if a grip has both prongs to assist the fencer's grip and also a French grip pommel it is not legal to use for competitive fencing."

        "text": "The 2004 Pro Bowl was the NFL's all-star game for the 2003 season. The game was played on February 8, 2004, at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii. The final score was NFC 55, AFC 52, the most points scored in a Pro Bowl game until 2024. Marc Bulger of the St. Louis Rams was the game's MVP.\nGame summary.\nThe AFC's first play set the tone for what would become a high-scoring affair. Tennessee Titans quarterback Steve McNair faked a handoff to running back Jamal Lewis before throwing to Chad Johnson for a 90-yard touchdown pass, the third-longest scoring play in Pro Bowl history. After the NFC got the ball back, they were forced to punt after a three-and-out. However, the punt by Todd Sauerbrun was blocked, and Ed Reed of the Ravens recovered it and ran it into the end zone, giving the AFC a 14–0 lead early on. The NFC responded with a touchdown by Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander, and Jeff Wilkins kicked a field goal to bring the NFC to within four. After Mike Vanderjagt kicked a field goal of his own, the score at the end of the first quarter was 17–10 AFC. Peyton Manning came on for the AFC at the second quarter, and hit Colts teammate Marvin Harrison with a 50-yard strike, as well as another touchdown pass to Tony Gonzalez. Wilkins kicked another field goal for the NFC, and the halftime score was 31–13 in favor of the AFC.\nThe AFC continued to add onto their lead with a Jamal Lewis touchdown, putting the score at 38–13. However, Marc Bulger, who had taken over at NFC quarterback from Daunte Culpepper, threw two quick touchdown passes to Torry Holt and Keenan McCardell, to bring the score to 38–27 at the end of three. Once again, the AFC struck quickly at the start of a quarter, when Trent Green hit Clinton Portis with a 22-yard touchdown pass. With less than 14 minutes remaining in the game, the score was 45–27.\nBulger quickly threw a scoring pass to tight end Alge Crumpler, and a short time later hit Alexander with another touchdown pass. Although the two-point conversion attempt after Alexander's touchdown failed, the score was still 45–40 with just over five minutes to play. Just after that, Dré Bly picked off Manning and returned the interception for a touchdown, giving the NFC the lead for the first time in the game. Counting the successful two-point conversion after Bly's touchdown, the NFC had scored 18 points in 8 minutes. Alexander scored another rushing touchdown with three and a half minutes remaining to add to the NFC's lead. Manning, however, responded with a touchdown pass to Hines Ward, and the AFC was down by three. Safety Brock Marion picked off Bulger in the end zone and ran it back to the AFC's 22-yard line. Manning had 1:15 left on the clock and no timeouts. After two passes to his favorite target, Harrison, as well as another to Ward, the AFC found itself on the NFC's 21-yard line. Kris Jenkins sacked Manning to send the AFC back, though, and with six seconds left, Vanderjagt, who hadn't missed a kick (field goal or extra point) all season, was wide right on a 51-yard attempt.\nThe game set several records. Ironically, the AFC's total of 31 points in the first half was a Pro Bowl record, but wouldn't last the game, as the NFC responded by putting up 42 points in the second half.\nNFC roster.\nSpecial teams.\nNotes:"

        "title": "Split (gymnastics)",
        "text": "A split (commonly referred to as splits or the splits) is a physical position in which the legs are in line with each other and extended in opposite directions. Splits are commonly performed in various athletic activities, including dance, figure skating, gymnastics, contortionism, synchronized swimming, cheerleading, martial arts, aerial arts and yoga as exercise, where a front split is named Hanumanasana and a side split is named Samakonasana. A person who has assumed a split position is said to be \"in a split\", or \"doing the splits\", or \"doing a split\" (this form is especially encountered in the Eastern United States).\nWhen executing a split, the lines defined by the inner thighs of the legs form an angle of approximately 180 degrees. This large angle significantly stretches, and thus demonstrates excellent flexibility of, the hamstring and iliopsoas muscles. Consequently, splits are often used as a stretching exercise to warm up and enhance the flexibility of leg muscles. A split that goes beyond 180° is called an oversplit.\nVariations.\nThere are two general forms of splits:\nThere are many variations of form and performance of splits, including:\nProblems.\nA common problem encountered during a side split is pain in the hip joints. Usually, the reason for this is that the split is being performed improperly (the pelvis may need to be tilted forward). Another common problem encountered during splits (both front and side) is pain in the knees.\nPopular culture.\nMany people lack the flexibility required to execute a split and thus regard splits to be uncomfortable or even painful. Because of this widespread view, splits appear in slapstick comedy, schadenfreude, and other forms of entertainment."

        "text": "Professional matches.\nAt its December 1868 meeting the NABBP permitted professional clubs for the first time. There had been no professional clubs outside the Association, and no brand new professional clubs were established for 1869. Rather, the entire first-year effect of the change was that twelve existing members declared professional status. All of them had fielded at least regionally strong teams in 1868 and most if not all had compensated at least some of their players. (Some compensation of players continued in the amateur field.)\nThe Cincinnati Red Stockings were first to sign an all-salary team, ten men for eight months. From the west, the strongest team in Cleveland also joined the pro field. From the eastern corridor there were ten including all of the one-time champions and claimants.\nCincinnati was unbeatable. Otherwise the record of professional matches (see table) is remarkable for its balance, relative to the records of the stronger teams during the amateur era and to most of the following pro seasons.\nThe Irvingtons did not travel, or win; after July they played only two matches with the Mutuals (four in all). Forest City of Cleveland did not travel far, only to Cincinnati and upstate New York. Those two did not face each other or any of the three teams standing just above them. That imbalance, typical of the time, contributed to the losing records of all five. Weaker teams were weaker gate attractions with less incentive and almost always less ability to travel.\nThe Irvingtons disbanded and the Keystones returned to amateur ranks, but all the others remained in the professional field for 1870. Indeed, all but Cincinnati remained in operation at least to 1872.\nAmateur clubs.\nThe amateur ranks during 1869 probably included some clubs who compensated their players by traditional methods such as division of the gate receipts (as Spalding said of Rockford by the end of the decade). Four of the amateurs would \"go pro\" in 1870, including the Forest City of Rockford, Illinois, with some success.\nThe professional field was relatively strong in 1869 and its weaker teams did not play many games. The Forest Citys did not beat any pro teams, but they played only four matches with Cincinnati, losing three by twenty runs and one by merely 14–15 on July 24. (They traveled no further than Detroit and Ohio while eastern pros also traveled no further than Ohio, home of their westernmost rivals. Even so, the Forest Citys of Rockford and Cleveland did not get together.)\nThe Stars of Brooklyn, led by pitcher Candy Cummings, won 2 of 7 matches with pro teams, beating the Mutuals 26–12 on June 19 and the visiting Olympics of Washington 49–11 on July 19. They lost five to the Mutuals and Atlantics by only 28 runs, total margin. Harvard college won 1 of 6 against pros, beating the powerful Athletics of Philadelphia 35–21 on July 9; the next day they lost a close one to the much weaker Keystones. Against amateurs Star won fourteen with one defeat; Harvard won thirteen with one draw. Next season they would win six each against the slightly larger pro field.\nLowell of Boston, listed among the major teams by Bill Ryczek, played three fairly close game against the pros, losing 21–26 to the Mutuals, 9–29 to undefeated Red Stockings, and 33–38 to the Eckfords.\nPastime of Baltimore won 2 of 9 against pro teams, including 1 of 4 local matches Maryland and one with the Troy Haymakers. The Olympics, Mutuals, Athletics, and Keystones beat them four teams by only 32 runs, total margin. Resolute of Elizabeth, New Jersey beat Irvington 16–15 and lost twice to the Eckfords.\nTheir records against pro teams:\nThese six amateur teams barely faced each other on the field: Lowell lost six to its local rival Harvard and one to Star (July 5, the Fourth being a Sunday that year). Harvard toured for ten days but played only the professional Eckfords in New York City.\nBirths.\nDecember.\nDate of birth missing "

        "text": "Joseph Melton Oliver (born July 24, 1965) is an American former professional baseball catcher. During a 19-year professional playing career, Oliver played parts of 13 seasons in MLB for seven different teams during 1989–2001, and was a member of the World Series-winning 1990 Cincinnati Reds. He later managed in Minor League Baseball for the Boston Red Sox organization from 2014 through 2020, and in collegiate summer baseball in 2021 and 2022. As a player, Oliver was listed at and ; he batted and threw right-handed.\nEarly life and amateur career.\nOliver was born in Memphis, Tennessee.\nOliver attended Boone High School in Orlando where he was teammates with Ron Karkovice. In 1983, he was selected as the catcher on the ABCA/Rawlings High School All-America Second Team only one year after Karkovice was named the catcher on the First Team. He was inducted into Boone's hall of fame in 2004.\nPlaying career.\nDrafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the second round of the 1983 MLB amateur draft, Oliver would make his Major League Baseball debut with Cincinnati on July 15, , and appear in his final game on October 6, . A relative rarity, in both his first and last at bats in those games, he got hits. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Oliver was a member of the Reds team that defeated the Oakland Athletics in the 1990 World Series. He drove in Billy Bates from second base in Game 2 of that series with a hit off Dennis Eckersley to win the game and propel the Reds to the title.\nOliver had a 13-season Major League career with the Reds, Milwaukee Brewers, Detroit Tigers, Seattle Mariners, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. In 1,076 games played—769 of them with the Reds—he amassed 831 hits, with 174 doubles and three triples to accompany his 102 career home runs. In , he led National League catchers in games caught, putouts and range factor. He was the NL player of the week August 16, 1992. He also led NL backstops in fielding percentage in 1990.\nManaging career.\nOn January 31, 2014, ESPN reported via his agent, Burton Rocks, that Oliver returned from a 13-year absence from professional baseball to manage the Lowell Spinners, the Red Sox' Short-Season Class A affiliate in the New York–Penn League. Oliver took over from Bruce Crabbe, who joined the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox in a coaching capacity.\nIn two seasons at Lowell (2014–2015), Oliver led the Spinners to a 74–77 (.490) record; he was promoted to manager of the Class A-Advanced Salem Red Sox of the Carolina League for 2016 during the off-season. During his first season in Salem, his club posted the Carolina League's best record (87–52, .626), but the team fell in the opening round of the playoffs to the eventual league champions, the Myrtle Beach Pelicans, two games to one. Oliver remained with Salem through the 2018 season. Oliver's overall managerial record for the 2014–2018 period was 297–270 (.524).\nOliver was promoted to manager of the Portland Sea Dogs of the Double-A Eastern League for 2019; the team played to a 62–77 record. He was named to return as manager for 2020, but the season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, following MLB's realignment of the minor leagues, which resulted in a reduced number of teams, Oliver was not included in Boston's minor league managerial assignments.\nIn March 2021, it was announced that Oliver would manage the newly formed Bluefield Ridge Runners, a collegiate summer team in the Appalachian League.\nOliver was the manager of the Frederick Keys in the MLB Draft League for the 2022 season.\nPersonal life.\nIn the 1990s, Oliver was an early investor in Stix Baseball, a baseball bat manufacturer which was eventually bought by Easton.\nOliver resides in Orlando, Florida, and until 2014 coached the varsity baseball team at Bishop Moore Catholic High School. He and his wife, Kim, have four children: Dejai, Karrah, Gavin, and Lauryl."

Allen, a student of basketball founder James Naismith, organized a nationwide protest which ultimately resulted in the dribble remaining part of the game.\nIn 1939, the NABC held the first national basketball tournament in Evanston, Illinois at the Northwestern Fieldhouse. Oregon defeated Ohio State for the first tournament championship. The next year, the NABC asked the NCAA to take over the administration of the tournament. In exchange, the NCAA provided complimentary tickets for NABC members to the Finals and placed an NABC member on its Tournament Committee.\nNABC initiatives include establishing the original Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, the format of today's NCAA basketball tournament, and the College Basketball Experience and National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame at the Sprint Center arena in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. This facility was completed on October 10, 2007.\nAll-District.\nNABC annually names its All-District Teams, which honors the top Division I players in each district.

        "text": "The Belgian Open is a men's golf tournament which has been played intermittently from 1910 to 2000. All editions since 1978 have been part of the European Tour. After not having been played since 2000, it returned in 2018 as the Belgian Knockout, hosted by PietersProductions, along with its co-founder, Belgian professional golfer Thomas Pieters. With a prize pool set at €1 million, 144 professional golfers start the competition with 36 holes of stroke play, followed by 9-hole match play for the top 64 finishers from the stroke play rounds.\nHistory.\nThe first ever Belgian Open was played at the Royal Golf Club of Belgium, featuring 36 holes. It was not until 1928 that the competition format expanded to 72 holes. The first edition of the tournament was won by Arnaud Massy, the only Frenchman to win a major championship. Other distinguished champions included Walter Hagen, Henry Cotton, José María Olazábal, Nick Faldo and Lee Westwood. Belgium's most successful 20th century golfer, Flory Van Donck, won his home open five times between 1939 and 1956.\nIn 2018, PietersProductions took over the organisation of the Belgian Open. After an absence of 18 years, they brought the Belgian Open back to the European Tour. The Belgian Open was reintroduced under the name Belgian Knockout.\nThe first edition of the Belgian Knockout, which was the 53rd edition of the Belgian Open, took place from 17 to 20 May 2018 at Rinkven International Golf Club, Schilde, Antwerp. In the final, the Spaniard Adrián Otaegui won against Frenchman Benjamin Hébert after four match days. David Drysdale took third place after winning against James Heath.\nIn 2021, it was announced that the tournament would make a return in 2022 and would revert to a stroke play event. It was sponsored by Soudal, and renamed as the Soudal Open.\nFormat in 2018 and 2019.\nThere are two rounds of stroke-play on the first two days. The top 64 and ties are credited with prize money and are declared to have advanced under Tour rules. However, in case of a tie for 64th place, there is a playoff if players are tied for 64th place to determine who advances to the knockout stages. Players eliminated in the playoff earn 65th place prize money and are credited with making the cut (\"MDF\").\nIn the knock-out stage there are six rounds, each match being over nine holes of stroke-play. Players are seeded based on their position after 36 holes. On the first day of knockout there are three rounds. Half the players use the front nine holes, the other half use the back nine. If the two players are tied after 9 holes there is a sudden-death playoff. There is also a 3rd/4th place playoff. Placings for those who didn't reach the semi-finals are decided firstly by the knockout round reached and, for those who lost in the same round, on their score in the opening 36 holes.\nTwo major changes will be implemented in 2019 for the event. In order to remove a potential advantage/disadvantage that may happen with some groups, the 144 players are now grouped in two sections of 72 players each. One section plays on the first morning and the second afternoon, the other on the first afternoon and second morning. The top 32 players qualify from each section, each section having a separate playoff if required. The second change applies to the first knockout round. The top 16 players will earn an advantage headed to the first knockout round. If their first-round match is tied after nine holes, they automatically advance.\nWinners.\nIn 1957 Hunt (137) beat Rees (145) by 8 strokes in a 36-hole playoff. In 1935 Branch (145) beat Van Donck (149) by 4 strokes in a 36-hole playoff. In 1912 Duncan (70) beat Ray (71) and Ball (78) in an 18-hole playoff, played the same evening."

        "text": "The North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's ice hockey team (formerly The North Dakota Fighting Sioux) is the college ice hockey team at the Grand Forks campus of the University of North Dakota. They are members of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC) and compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I ice hockey. North Dakota is widely regarded as a premier college hockey school and has one of the most storied programs in NCAA history. UND has made over 30 appearances in the NCAA tournament, appeared in the Frozen Four 22 times, and has won 8 NCAA Division I Championships. The program has also achieved 15 WCHA Regular season Championships, 5 NCHC Regular season Championships, and 12 Conference Tournament championships. The school's former nickname was the Fighting Sioux, which had a lengthy and controversial tenure before ultimately being retired by the university in 2012 due to pressure from the NCAA. The official school nickname is now the Fighting Hawks, a name that was chosen by the university on November 18, 2015.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nVarsity ice hockey at the University of North Dakota began in 1946 with John Jamieson as the first coach. The 1946–47 season was the first winning season in UND history with a record of 7 wins, 6 losses, and 0 ties. UND joined Michigan Tech, Colorado College, University of Denver, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and University of Minnesota as founding members of the Midwest Collegiate Hockey League (MCHL) in 1951. In the program's first season in league play UND finished with a record of 13–11–1. After two seasons the MCHL became the Western Intercollegiate Hockey League (WIHL) and later in 1959 became the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. Artificial ice was installed in UND's Winter Sports Building, commonly known as \"The Barn\", in 1953.\nBob May became the 5th coach in UND history for the 1957–58 season and led the team to the 1957–58 WIHL Regular season Championship. UND also received a bid to the 1958 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey tournament. The team advanced to the championship game with a 9–1 win over Harvard in the semi-final round. UND fell in their first championship and post season tournament appearance to University of Denver 2–6. Following the 1957–58 season the WIHL broke up, after Michigan, Michigan State, Michigan Tech, and Minnesota left the conference following a dispute over recruiting practices. Despite not violating the WIHL or the NCAA's rules of the period, the four exiting schools accused Denver, North Dakota and Colorado College of breaking a gentlemen's agreement by recruiting overage Canadians.\nThorndycraft era.\nWithout a conference UND competed as an independent Division I team for the 1958–59 season. Barry Thorndycraft took over for May as head coach and continued the winning tradition established in the previous season. UND again reached the NCAA tournament for the second straight season and again advanced to the championship with a 4–3 overtime win over St. Lawrence. UND beat former WIHL member Michigan State with another 4–3 overtime victory to win the university's first ice hockey national championship. UND ended with a record of 20–10–1 on the season. 1959 marked the official founding of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) and after three seasons in the WCHA UND returned to the national stage for the 1963 NCAA tournament held in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts at the McHugh Forum. North Dakota blew away the hometown Boston College Eagles 8–2 and won the school's second ice hockey championship with a 6–5 win over rival Denver. The team finished with a record of 22–7–3 and coach Thorndycraft was named WCHA Coach of the Year for 1962–63.\nPeters, Selman, Bjorkman years.\nThorndycraft left the program in 1964 and under new coach R.H. \"Bob\" Peters, UND won the MacNaughton Cup for the WCHA regular season championship in 1964–65. The team advanced to the 1965 NCAA tournament but lost 3–4 in the semi-final round to Boston College. Bill Selman became coach in 1966 and led the team to their third MacNaughton Cup in history and a spot in the 1967 NCAA tournament. UND's run ended with a loss to Cornell 0–1 but Selman received the 1966–67 WCHA Coach of the Year award. The following season UND received an at-large bid to the 1968 NCAA tournament. North Dakota beat Cornell 4–1 in a rematch of the 1967 semi-final game. UND advanced to the National Championship game for the first time since winning it 5 seasons earlier in 1963. UND again found themselves in the National Championship game matched up with conference rival Denver, North Dakota would fall to the Pioneers 0–4. Rube Bjorkman became the 9th coach in program history after previously serving as head coach at the University of New Hampshire. Over the 10 seasons as coach UND finished with two winning seasons, one in his first season as UND coach in 1968–69 and a second in 1971–72. During his tenure as UND coach Bjorkman compiled a record of 149–186–11.\nGasparini era.\nJohn \"Gino\" Gasparini was hired in 1978, Gasparini played for UND from 1964 to 1967 before a short stint in the International Hockey League then returning to UND under Bjorkman as an assistant coach. Gasparini's impact was immediate and UND finished the regular season winning the MacNaughton Cup and advancing to the 1979 NCAA tournament. North Dakota picked up a 4–2 victory of Dartmouth in the semi-final round but fell in the national championship game to Minnesota 3–4. North Dakota finished the season with a record of 30–11–1, the program's first 30-win season, as well as Gasparini being named WCHA Coach of the Year. The 30 wins of the 1978–79 season was eclipsed the following season when North Dakota picked up 31 wins and the programs third National Championship with a 5–2 win over Northern Michigan. North Dakota returned to the NCAA tournament in 1984. North Dakota swept Rensselaer two games to none in the quarter-final round but fell 1–2 in overtime to Minnesota-Duluth\nThe 1986–87 season UND swept through the WCHA winning the MacNaughton Cup and WCHA Final Five Tournament. UND advanced to the 1987 NCAA tournament sweeping St. Lawrence in two games by a combined score of 9–4 and advancing to the Championship with a 5–2 win over Harvard. North Dakota won their fifth NCAA Division I National Championship when UND defeated Michigan State Spartans in front of a Spartan crowd in Detroit, Michigan on March 28, 1987. The team would make the NCAA tournament one more time with Gasparini behind the bench in 1990 but fell in the regional round of the expanded NCAA tournament when the team lost to Boston University two games to one in the best of three series.\nBlais era.\nAfter four quiet years, Dean Blais took over as head coach of North Dakota after John \"Gino\" Gasparini in 1994. In his third season as head coach, Blais led UND to the program's eighth MacNaughton Cup for WCHA regular season champions and fifth Broadmoor Trophy for WCHA playoff champions. UND advanced to the Frozen Four after a 6–2 victory over Cornell in the quarterfinal round. UND then advanced to the National Championship with a 6–2 win over Colorado College. Under Blais, UND won 6–4 over Boston University to win the school's Six National Championship. That same season Blais was named recipient of the Spencer Penrose Award for Division I College Coach of the Year.\nNorth Dakota returned to the NCAA tournament in 1998 and 1999 but were plagued with early-round exits. In the 1999–2000 season, after again winning the WCHA Tournament, UND advanced through the 2000 NCAA tournament to the Championship against Boston College, looking for its first NCAA title since 1949. BC had a 2–1 lead entering the third period, but UND responded with three goals, with two by Lee Goren. Goren tied the game, assisted on Jason Ulmer's game-winning goal, and then scored into an empty Eagles net in the last minute of play to secure the game. It marked North Dakota's seventh national title overall and second since 1997, and was also the third time in three years that BC came up short in the Frozen Four. Boston College got its revenge over UND the following season when the two teams again faced each other in the National Championship. BC won its first national title since 1949 by defeating North Dakota, 3–2, in overtime on a goal scored by sophomore forward Krys Kolanos just 4:43 into OT.\nIn 2001, the team moved into the new $100 million, 11,500-seat Ralph Engelstad Arena, replacing the aging 6,000-seat Old Ralph Engelstad Arena that served as the home for UND hockey since 1972. After missing the NCAA post-season tournament in 2002, UND returned in 2003. North Dakota fell to Ferris State 2–5 in the opening round of the West Regionals. And in the 2004 NCAA tournament, UND shut out Holy Cross 3–0 before getting shut out 0–1 in the West Regional Final to Denver.\nHakstol era.\nOn July 9, 2004, Dave Hakstol was announced as the 15th coach in program history, replacing Dean Blais who left UND when he was named associate coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets. Blais served as UND head coach for 10 seasons and placed first among active coaches with a record of 262–115–13 and a .733 winning percentage. With Hakstol behind the bench, UND continued their winning tradition that was prevalent under Blais. UND won 4–3 in overtime vs. Maine on October 8, 2004, to give Hakstol his first win as head coach. UND received an at-large bid to the 2005 NCAA tournament and found themselves in the Championship against long-time rival University of Denver. DU freshman goaltender Peter Mannino backstopped an offensive attack that included a 2-goal game by DU forward Paul Stastny to hand UND a 1–4 loss.\nNorth Dakota made and advanced in the next three NCAA tournaments but came up with third-place finishes in the Frozen Four, losing to Boston College three seasons in a row. In 2006 losing 5–6 to the Eagles, in 2007 falling 4–6, and in 2008 losing 1–6. Despite the third consecutive loss to BC in the Frozen Four, the seasons ended on high notes in 2006–07 when sophomore forward Ryan Duncan became the second UND player to win the Hobey Baker Award and the first in 20 seasons after Tony Hrkac in 1986–87. The 2007–08 season was only the second time in UND Hockey history that North Dakota had two finalists for the Hobey Baker Award when junior forward T. J. Oshie and senior goalie Jean-Philippe Lamoureux; the other time in 2004 when Zach Parise, Brandon Bochenski were nominated.\nIn March 2009 UND won a WCHA-leading 14th league championship with a 2–1 win at Wisconsin. The team advanced to the 2009 NCAA tournament but fell in the Northeast Region semifinal to New Hampshire, 5–6 in overtime, after UNH's Thomas Fortney scored with :00.1 remaining in regulation to force OT and UNH's Josh LaBlanc scored 45 seconds into overtime. UND capped off the 2009–10 regular season and won the 2010 WCHA Men's Ice Hockey tournament to receive an automatic bid to the 2010 NCAA tournament. UND fell in the Northeast Regional semifinals to Yale 2–3 after The Bulldogs scored 3 goals in a span of 4:57 during the second period and Yale goaltender Ryan Rondeau stopped 34 UND shots.\nIn March 2011 UND captured its WCHA-leading 15th league championship with an 11–2 win at Michigan Tech. The team advanced as the #1 seed into the 2011 WCHA tournament by beating #12 seed Michigan Tech (8–0, 3–1). UND advanced to the 2011 WCHA Final Five to play Colorado College in the WCHA semi-final and won with a late 3rd period goal by Matt Frattin to advance them to the WCHA Championship. UND then faced rival Denver for the Broadmoor Trophy. Denver took to the early lead 1–0 at 5:06 of the first period, UND rallied at 2:32 of the second period and struck again at 8:18 of the second period. Denver tied it up at 17:47 of the third period to force the game into overtime. Frattin scored the game winner at 5:11 of the second overtime to claim North Dakota's 2nd as many seasons and 9th Broadmoor Trophy overall for UND. The team advanced to the 2011 NCAA tournament Midwest Regional in Green Bay, Wisconsin. At the Midwest Regional, UND faced off first against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), where they shut out the Engineers, 6–0, advancing to play WCHA rival Denver for the second straight weekend. UND defeated the Pioneers of Denver 6–1 in the Midwest Regional Final to advance to their fifth Frozen Four in 8 seasons under Dave Hakstol. In the NCAA Frozen Four, UND saw their highly anticipated season come to an end with a 0–2 shutout to the Michigan Wolverines.\nIn March 2012, UND captured its 10th Broadmoor Trophy with a 4–0 victory over rival Denver. With this victory, UND made history by being the first team in WCHA history to capture the Broadmoor three straight years (2010, 2011, 2012); this is the second time UND has won the tournament from a play in game and also holds a 13-game unbeaten streak in the WCHA tournament and an 8-game WCHA Final Five unbeaten streak. UND lost to rival Minnesota in the NCAA tournament.\nHakstol left the team in May 2015 to take the head coaching job with the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League, becoming the first college coach to jump to an NHL head coaching position since Herb Brooks was hired by the Minnesota North Stars in 1987.\nNational Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC).\nOn July 14, 2011, College Hockey Inc. announced the formation of a new hockey league, the National Collegiate Hockey Conference, which would begin play in the 2013–14 season. The league's six charter members were North Dakota, Colorado College, Denver, Miami (OH), Minnesota–Duluth, and Nebraska-Omaha. All were WCHA members except for CCHA member Miami. Two months after the announcement of the new league, the NCHC added a sixth WCHA member, St. Cloud State, and another CCHA member, Western Michigan. The NCHC has had no membership changes since starting play. The new league was made after the Big Ten Conference decided to sponsor hockey. This change caused widespread backlash due to the break-up of old rivalries that included Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.\nBerry Era (2015–present).\nAfter Dave Hakstol obtained the head coaching job in Philadelphia, Brad Berry received a promotion to Head Coach on May 18, 2015. In his first year, he managed a decisive 34–6–4 record, building a line known as the CBS line (Caggiula, Boeser, Schmaltz).\nIn 2016, North Dakota once again won the NCHC Regular season Championship, but were defeated in the NCHC Tournament. UND finished the regular season as the #3 ranked team in the country and qualified for the NCAA tournament. For the third consecutive season, UND advanced to the 2016 Frozen Four, defeating Northeastern, and Michigan to get there. Following a dramatic 4–2 win over Denver, North Dakota had reached the Championship where they defeated Quinnipiac 5–1. This was their first championship since 2000, and their eighth overall. Only Michigan and Denver have more championships with nine.\n2017 was an up and down year that resulted in the program's 15th consecutive postseason berth. North Dakota lost in double overtime against Boston University in the NCAA tournament, after having a goal disallowed in the first overtime due to an offsides review.\nIn 2018, inconsistency again plagued the North Dakota hockey team. Plenty of streaks ending, most notably the run of postseason NCAA national tournament appearances. North Dakota's streak of 20 wins in a season came to an end. It resulted in missing the postseason for the first time since the 2001–2002 season.\n2019 was another inconsistent year for North Dakota. It resulted in the team finishing 5th in the 8th place NCHC standings. This snapped a streak dating back to the 2002–03 season in which North Dakota hosted and ultimately advanced in their conference tournament. Their season ended with a sweep to the hands of Denver in the first round of the NCHC playoffs.\n2020 was a return to national prominence for UND. The team accomplished many feats that few North Dakota teams did before. The team won a series at rivals Denver for the first time in years by virtue of a win and a tie and swept both games against Minnesota at 3M arena at Mariucci for only the 2nd time in the previous 40-year history of games in Minneapolis. The team achieved a #1 ranking in both national polls and was PairWise #1 during the regular season for the first time since 2017. The team went on to win the Penrose Cup as regular season champions in the NCHC.\n2020 Post-season Cancellation Due to COVID-19.\nIn March 2020, before College hockey playoffs began, the NCAA cancelled the remainder of all college sports 2020 spring season. The team was due to host Colorado College for a first round series for the start of the postseason, however, the NCHC tournament was canceled due to the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Very soon after, the NCAA tournament was canceled leaving the season over for North Dakota. North Dakota set a home record at 18–1, the best in UND hockey history with a win percentage of .947. UND finished the year ranked #1 in the Pairwise with a record of 26–5–4.\n2021-Present.\nIn 2021, as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it was determined to play only league games in the NCHC. The first ten games of league play would start in a \"pod\" in Omaha at Baxter Arena in a three-week period to maximize opportunity to play all games in a controlled situation. North Dakota finished the pod in first in the NCHC and continued to roll into the rest of the regular season and captured their second straight Penrose Cup as regular season champions of the NCHC. The postseason tournament, instead of being played in St. Paul at the Xcel Energy Center due to restrictions from COVID-19, was selected to be played at UND's Ralph Engelstad Arena. North Dakota won the NCHC postseason tournament for the first time in their history making them the first NCHC team to win both the regular season and postseason titles in the same year. UND's promising season ended in heartbreaking fashion in the NCAA regional final round with a loss to rival Minnesota-Duluth in 5 overtimes, making it the longest game in NCAA postseason history.\n2022 brought continued success in the regular season for North Dakota. They captured the Penrose Cup for a third consecutive season. They entered the postseason playing host to Colorado College in the first round of the NCHC playoffs and swept the Tigers. A loss at the Frozen Faceoff to Western Michigan ended their NCHC tournament. They would be selected to play in the NCAA tournament but lose in the first round to Notre Dame ending their season.\n2023 was a disappointment to the high expectations coming into the season. Inconsistencies in their play in the early part of the year plagued their season despite playing better towards the end of the year. The team would finish tied for 5th in the NCHC standings, and ultimately bowed out in the semifinals of the NCHC tournament. The team would not be selected for participation in the NCAA tournament, which is the 3rd time in 8 years under Brad Berry they have not qualified.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nHistoric record.\nAs of March 16, 2024\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of North Dakota alumni who have played on an Olympic team.\nUND Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the men's ice hockey program who were elected into the UND Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nFighting Hawks in the NHL.\nWHA.\nTwo players also were members of WHA teams.\nSource:\nAwards and honors.\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nHobey Baker Award\nSpencer Penrose Award\nMike Richter Award\nNCAA Division I Ice Hockey Scoring Champion\nLowes' Senior CLASS Award\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nWCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nOutstanding Student-Athlete of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nFreshman/Rookie of the Year\nSophomore of the Year\nDefensive Player of the Year\nMost Valuable Player in tournament\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-WCHA\nSecond Team All-WCHA\nThird Team All-WCHA\nAll-WCHA Rookie Team\nNCHC.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nGoaltender of the Year\nForward of the Year\nDefensive Forward of the Year\nDefensive Defenseman of the Year\nScholar-Athlete of the Year\nSportsmanship Award\nHerb Brooks Coach of the Year\nFrozen Faceoff MVP\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-NCHC\nSecond Team All-NCHC\nNCHC All-Rookie Team\nProgram records.\nSeason.\nPlayers\nTeam\nGame.\nPlayer\nTeam\nPeriod.\nPlayer\nTeam\nStreaks.\nPlayer\nTeam"

        "title": "Brazil v Poland (1938 FIFA World Cup)",
        "text": "Brazil v Poland was a football match held during the 1938 FIFA World Cup in France and still remembered by many Polish fans as Poland's first ever FIFA World Cup match. It is also Brazil's highest-scoring match in a FIFA World Cup tournament. The match held the record for highest-scoring World Cup match until 1954, when Austria beat Switzerland 7–5. \nThe teams.\nBrazil.\nAll of the players called up by Adhemar Pimenta traveled to France:\nOut of those, Batatais, Walter, Machado, Argemiro, Lopes, Perácio, Romeu Pellicciari, Hércules and Zezé Procópio had never played any matches for the national team before.\nPoland.\nTo Strasbourg, France, where Poland was going to play its first game versus Brazil (5 June 1938), Kałuża and Spoida took 15 players:\nOn the roster, there were two athletes who had never before played for Poland - midfielder Stanisław Baran and goalkeeper Walter Brom (who was then 17 years and 4 months old - up to this day Brom is the youngest goalkeeper on FIFA's World Cup list of participants).\nIn Poland, on stand-by reserve, seven players stayed behind. Those were:\nPreparations.\nBrazil.\nBy 1930s, Brazil was not yet regarded as the world's top team. The team had participated in the two first World Cups, but with lackluster performances and preparations marred by behind-the-scenes infighting: In 1930, the São Paulo football federation fell out with CBD and refused to provide any of its players to the national team, and the Brazilian team, composed solely of players from Rio de Janeiro clubs, was eliminated in the group stage after a loss to Yugoslavia. In 1934, the country's football was undergoing a schism between professionals and amateurs, with CBD on the amateurs' side, and as a result, the squad was composed of Botafogo (the only team of significance that remained amateur) players supplemented with players from professional teams hired by CBD to play on the World Cup. The team once again fell on the first stage, losing to Spain by 3-1. \nHowever, the preparation for 1938 had been calm and free of internal disputes, and the team had qualified to the tournament by default after its opponent, Argentina, withdrew from the qualification. so, Brazil, coming for the first time with maximum strength, was believed to be a very good, high quality team. The Brazilians later proved it - after defeating Sweden (4-2) they finished the 1938 tournament in 3rd place. It was this performance that gained them their reputation and marked the beginning of Brazil as a new football power.\nAs the shirts of both teams at the time were white, Brazil played with its improvised training uniform, without embroidered shields and in a different shade of blue than the shorts. It was the first time that Brazil wore blue in an official match, which would only be repeated in the 1958 final.\nPoland.\nThe Polish team, on its end, had played its qualification matches against Yugoslavia. After winning by 4-0 in Warsaw, they lost the return match in Belgrade by 1-0 and advanced on goal difference.\nInteresting is the fact that the Polish team was gathered together just a week before the game. This was due to the Polish Football League games - coaches of the teams did not want their best players to leave their sides earlier because in the 1930s, like majority of world's athletes then, most Polish athletes were amateurs - they had to work on a daily basis. Thus, the training camp in Wągrowiec (near Poznań) lasted for a week only - just enough for some players to get acquainted with each other. A few days before the game, the Poles got into the train and went to Strasbourg.\nThe team that was called up to the Cup was largely the same as the one that had played in the qualification, with only keeper Adolf Krzyk and striker Jerzy Wostal absent from the final list. by then, relatively few players still remained from the team that had reached fourth place in the 1936 Olympics.\nUnder these circumstances, the Polish team, which had never before advanced to such a level, was expected to lose the game against the South Americans. Thus, the defeat was not a sensation. However, all fans were surprised at the style with which the Poles played its lone game of the tournament - white-reds got to the extra time, only then losing 5-6.\nOriginally, the game was supposed to take place in Toulouse, in southern France. Polish officials, however, issued a complaint stating that the sweltering heat there would be helpful for the Brazilians, who are used to such weather. The game's location was moved to Strasbourg, but not because of the complaint. There were numerous, last moment corrections before the whole tournament. This was due to complications after the withdrawal of Austria, which after the Anschluss was incorporated into Germany.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nAt exactly 17:00, Swedish referee Ivan Eklind blew his whistle for the first time. Strasbourg's Stade de la Meinau was filled with some 15,000 fans, including a several thousand group of Poles - mostly immigrants, who worked in coal mines in northern France. Brazilian fans were not numerous, and the French were mostly rooting for exotic team from South America.\nBack in those days, teams were mainly concentrated on attack. So it is not surprising that in Kałuża's lineup there were as many as five forwards (Piec, Wilimowski, Wodarz, Piątek and Scherfke). Midfielders were Góra, Nyc and Dytko, and the defenders - only Szczepaniak (captain) and Gałecki. In the goal there was Madejski. Brazil also played with the same scheme, with Batatais on the goal, Domingos da Guia and Machado on the defence, Zezé Procópio, Martim and Affonsinho as midfielders, and as forwards, Lopes, Romeu, Leônidas, Perácio and Hércules.\nIt must be mentioned that in 1938, football regulations did not allow any replacements. As Poland lost the game vs. Brazil (5–6), which meant going back home, only the 11 players mentioned above were given the chance to appear on the field. Out of the 22 Brazilian players called up, only Niginho wouldn't have the opportunity to play on the following matches.\nLittle is known about the first goal, which Brazil's Leônidas (also known as Black Diamond-Diamante Negro) scored in 18th minute. There was no description of it in Polish press, Polish participants of the game did not remember it, either. However, it was reported that five minutes later, Ernst Wilimowski dribbled past three defenders and Brazilian keeper Batatais. The latter managed to push the Pole to the ground, which meant a penalty kick; it was scored in the 23rd minute by Scherfke, who aimed at the right corner of the goal. This was the first, historical goal of the Poland national team at a FIFA World Cup.\nSecond half.\nAfter the first half, the Brazilians were winning 3–1 (goals by Leonidas, Romeu and Peracio) and the Poles were mainly in defense. Halftime was the turning point. First of all, Kałuża yelled loudly at his players, then it started to rain. South Americans were having problems on wet, slippery turf, while Wilimowski started his show. In 53rd and then 59th minute, Poland's top-scorer twice beat Batatais, after individual performances, which were described in the press as “circus-like”. So, in 59th minute the score was 3–3.\nSoon afterwards, the rain stopped. It was a boost for the Brazilians, who in 71st minute scored (by Peracio). However, a minute before time Wilimowski scored his third goal, which meant extra time.\nExtra time.\nAfter a short break, the Brazilians attacked the Polish goal. Two goals by Leonidas (in 93rd and 104th minutes) settled the game for good. Poles, led by amazing Wilimowski, fought back - in the 118th minute he slotted the ball in. During the last minutes, Brazil was desperately defending the result. Even though Wodarz, on a free kick, was close, and then Nyc's shot hit a crossbar, Poland lost 5–6.\nLeonidas' goal at 93\" was scored without him wearing the right boot, which tore and was left off his foot in the swampy pitch. The goal was given though, as Brazil played the match with black socks and thus (also due to all the mud which covered the pitch resulting of the rain beforehand), the lack of a boot went undetected by the referee.\nAftermath.\nThe match has some cultural significance in both countries.\nFor Brazil, they went on to win the third place match, after losing to the Italians in the semi-finals. The 3rd place occupation by Brazil was seen to be Brazil's greatest football achievement by the time, and helped boosting football's popularity in the country. It was the 1938 edition that Brazil started to rise to become a football superpower, although it took them 20 years to finally win their first World Cup, against the hosts, which was surprisingly the home country of the referee who officiated the match between Brazil and Poland in 1938.\nIt was Poland's first and only World Cup match in the Interwar period. Poland was later invaded by Nazi Germany and Soviet Union a year later, and Poland suffered significant destruction of its sporting developments, including football. Following the end of World War II, the Polish People's Republic was established under Stalin's control. Thus, Polish football did not make any major impact until their return in 1974, where the Poles surprised the whole tournament by achieving third place, by taking vengeance on the Brazilians in their final match. Polish golden generation by then, was born.\nBrazil and Poland would meet each other three more times in the FIFA World Cup (1-0 for Poland in 1974, 3-1 to Brazil in 1978 and 4-0 for Brazil in 1986)."

        "text": "William C. (Bill) Bridges (April 4, 1939 – September 25, 2015) was an American basketball player who earned an NBA championship and multiple NBA All-Star honors. Bridges played 13 seasons in the NBA for various teams, including the St. Louis / Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Golden State Warriors.\nEarly years.\nBorn on April 4, 1939, Bridges grew up in Hobbs, New Mexico. He attended Hobbs High School and played for the Hobbs Eagles and legendary high school basketball coach Ralph Tasker. Bridges led Hobbs High School to New Mexico state high school basketball championships in 1956 and 1957. \nCollege career.\nBridges enrolled at the University of Kansas for the 1957–1958 school year as a non-scholarship \"walk-on\".\nWith freshmen ineligible for varsity competition until 1972, Bridges competed effectively in practice sessions during his 'redshirt' season against fellow Jayhawk Wilt Chamberlain who was playing his second and final season at Kansas. Bridges' performance in practices in the 1957-1958 season earned him a scholarship for his remaining three years.\nDuring his subsequent three seasons of competition 1958-1959, 1959-1960, and 1960-1961 for the Kansas Jayhawks, Bridges averaged 13.2 points and 13.9 rebounds per game.\nBridges was chosen All-Big Eight all three seasons, and was an honorable mention All-American in 1961.\nProfessional playing career.\nAfter graduation from Kansas in 1961, Bridges was drafted by the Chicago Packers (currently Washington Wizards) with the 32nd pick in the 3rd round of the 1961 NBA draft.\nInstead of signing with the Packers, Bridges played for the Kansas City Steers of the American Basketball League prior to entering the NBA. Bridges led the ABL in rebounding during both seasons he played for the Steers and led the league in scoring during his second season. He set the ABL single-game scoring record with 55 points on December 9, 1962. The league folded at the end of 1962, and the Steers were declared ABL champions.\nBridges then entered the National Basketball Association and spent 13 seasons (1962–1975) as a member of the St. Louis/Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Golden State Warriors.\nBridges won an NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors in 1975 and was elected to three NBA All-Star teams in 1967, 1968, and 1970.\nThough undersized at 6'6\" for his position as a power forward, Bridges was an elite rebounder and averaged a double-double (11.9 points, 11.9 rebounds) over the course of his NBA career.\nBridges' tally of 11,054 career rebounds is ranked 30th in the history of the NBA.\nBridges is one of four players (Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and Willis Reed were the others) to record more than 35 rebounds in an NBA playoff game. Bridges, then playing for the Atlanta Hawks, tallied 36 rebounds in Game 2 of the 1971 Eastern Conference Semifinals versus the New York Knicks.\nBridges' league-leading 366 personal fouls during the 1967–68 season was, at the time, an NBA record.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter retirement from the NBA in 1975, Bridges became an environmental consultant based in Santa Monica, California.\nBridges died in Los Angeles, California at the age of 76 following a battle with cancer.\nAwards.\nStarting in 1962, in what Bridges called his greatest honor, the University of Kansas basketball program named its yearly post-season individual rebounding award the \"Bill Bridges Rebounding Award\".\nIn 2002, at a ceremony during a game at Allen Field House, Bridges was honored as the first Jayhawk to record 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds in a career.\nIn 2004, the University of Kansas retired Bridges' jersey at a ceremony in Allen Field House.\nIn 2014, Bridges was inducted into the New Mexico Sports Hall of Fame.\nIn 2016, Bridges was inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame."

The game's simulation engine was written from scratch by the two lead programmers. The game featured video clips of Chris Berman and play-by-play audio from Dan Patrick.\nLittle Caesars Enterprises, Inc. got involved with the development of the game, seeing marketing synergy between baseball fans and pizza eaters. A large promotion was rolled out by the pizza chain to coincide with the game's launch, including point-of-purchase material at 4,500 stores; a mail-in offer for an ESPN \"Best of Sports\" videotape; and print advertising. The director of marketing for Sony called what Little Caesars received \"a new method to reach families and men, 18-34, in a nontraditional, nonintrusive way.\" The stadium walls in-game featured large Little Caesars advertising.\nThe PC version was one of the early games to be made available solely on CD-ROM. In addition to the single game, season and playoff modes, there is also a Home Run Derby mode that evaluates the player's final score from ballerina (with a 0% accuracy rate) to hall of famer (with an accuracy rate of 95%-100%) depending on the number of home runs successfully completed.\nIt was the first in a series of ESPN-themed sports games. The next to be released was \"ESPN Sunday Night NFL\".\nCritical reception.\n\"ESPN Baseball Tonight\" received mostly negative reviews. Reviewing the Genesis version, \"GamePro\" said it \"offers great graphics and sound, but it falls way too short in fun. ... If you're a die-hard baseball fan or a beginner, steer clear of this cart. It'll only frustrate you.\"\nIn \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine, columnist Bob Strauss said that the design of the PC version was \"appealing enough\", but that it plunked players down into \"shoddiest baseball simulation\" he'd seen, with \"pixelated generic-looking players; awkward, superfluous voice commentary; digitalized computer-generated and chroma-keyed or CSO technology-wise videos and a static interface that makes live baseball seem like the invasion of Normandy.\" He strongly preferred \"HardBall! '95\" instead. Other reviews complained of its size. It weighed in at 54 MB on the PC (a very large file for early 1995 – 23 MB of it comprised the video clips of Berman). The \"Library Journal\" review simply said, \"We strongly recommend a new storage algorithm for this one!\""

The game got around this by using the city names of each team with matching colors, and using terms \"A League\", \"N League\", and \"The Series\". Notably, MLB teams representing a state are referred to by a city in that state instead, for instance, The Florida Marlins are referred to as Miami in the game. (Coincidentally, the team would later rename themselves the Miami Marlins in 2012.) Players are allowed to play a single game (with the default teams being Philadelphia at Toronto, the 1993 league champs), a full season based on the 1994 schedule (with wins and losses recorded by password in the SNES version, battery back-up for Genesis), playoffs, and a World Series. Though the full season mode is based on the 1994 schedule, it does not include the new (and current) three divisions/wild card format introduced for the 1994 season; instead it uses the old two division (per league) format.\nCouched in what the packaging billed as \"huge arcade style graphics,\" games could be played on either natural or artificial grass (depending on the home team) during day or night. The game also featured scoreboard animations for double and triple plays, home runs, grand slams, pitching changes, pinch hitters, and sometimes strike outs.\nThe SNES version is the first ever baseball video game to include the Atlanta Braves' distinctive Tomahawk Chop theme song, which is advertised on the back of the game box.\nThe game's cover features Brent Gates of the Oakland Athletics and Billy Hatcher of the Boston Red Sox.\nThe Japanese version of \"Fighting Baseball\" did not have the MLBPA license and used modified player names and statistics.\nReception.\nOn release, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored the Super Famicom version of the game a 20 out of 40. \"GamePro\" praised the easy controls, digitized voices, and the ability to control the ball after it leaves the pitcher's hand, but criticized the lack of real teams and the so-so graphics. They summarized it as an enjoyable game that falls short of ranking among the best in the genre.\nThe Japanese version of Fighting Baseball, which did not have the MLBPA license, achieved fame on the Internet in 2017 when the programmer-created rosters went viral. The game's players include examples of Engrish and included names such as 'Sleve McDichael' and 'Bobson Dugnutt’, many of which are based on combining actual MLB and NHL player names."

The best two teams from each tournament then compete in the European Champion Cup \"Final Four\", with the winner receiving the European Champion Cup.\nBetween 2013 and 2015, the \"Final Four\" format was replaced with a best-of-three series between the winners of each tournament. In the 2015 tournament, six teams competed in the Paris group, while six other teams competed in Rotterdam. The best two teams then competed in the \"Final Four\" in Italy, in a best-of-three series, for the championship.\nIn early 2024, WBSC Europe announced a restructuring of its European club competitions, with the top tier Baseball European Champions Cup now being played in a full-season format at each team's venues, instead of a tournament hosted in one location. The inaugural tournament under the new format will feature only 4 teams from Germany and Czech Republic, with expansion planned for the future. The lower-tier competitions are keeping their tournament structure, with promotion and relegation for its federations."

        "text": "Catholic University Cardinals rowing teams represent the Catholic University Cardinals in men's and women's intercollegiate rowing.\nHistory.\nClub (1990–2018).\nThe program was founded as a club called The Catholic University of America Rowing Association (CUARA) and competed in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the American Collegiate Rowing Association.\nThe club was established at the beginning of the spring semester 1990 by Laurie McGuane, an architecture major from Denver who transferred to Catholic University of America after her freshman year at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. Disappointed that CUA did not have a rowing club, she decided to start one. In January 1990, the Crew Club was granted official club status by the university.\nThe spring semester of 1990 was devoted to organizing the club, starting fund-raising, and making contacts with the Washington, D.C. rowing network. The first coaches were Glenn Harchar and Bob Shuttleworth, who both coached for Capital Rowing Club at Thompson’s.\nThe following year (1991–92), with Laurie McGuane still president, Gregory Rubbo VP, Chris McBride \"purser,\" and Meg Murphy, secretary, Glenn continued to serve as coach of the novice women, Ed McCormick coached our men, and Bill our varsity women. In the spring semester, Doug Sanders, who was a grad student in physics at CUA, became the coach of all our crews.\nIn 1992-93, Joe Creed started coaching. In the 1996-97 season, the Women’s Novice Eight, stroked by Rosanna Brunelli, became the first crew in CUARA history to win a gold medal. They won the Bill Braxton Regatta, beating Temple, Delaware, and UConn.\nIn the fall of 2002, John and Bridgette Dziedzic joined as assistant coaches and became head coaches of the men's and women's teams, respectively, after Joe Creed resigned. The team had a rebuilding year.\nThe 2004 Spring Season was the most successful year, to date, for the team. The Men's Four, including Alan Van Epps, Matt Starr, Brian Flynn, Mark Freibott, and James Hood, had a strong showing, winning gold at Occoquan Sprints and the St. Mary's Seahawks Regatta. The Varsity Lightweight Women's Four (Catherine Mancusi, Stephanie Callaghan, Erin Curry, Jackie Racicot, and Lindsay Capidulupo) won three medals (gold at Knecht Cup and St. Mary's Seahawks Sprint and bronze at the Mid-Atlantic Championship Regatta and a second-place finish at the Occoquan Sprints).\nIn 2008 the team was in decline due to lack of interest by the student body and a lack of commitment by members of the team. The team fell under the direction of James Augone, as Coaches John and Bridgette Dziedzic resigned after six years to start their family. Coach Augone formerly rowed at Iona College in New Rochelle, New York.\nIn the 2011-2012 rowing season, Sally O'Connor took over as head coach and in March 2012 Ryan Gillis became the new president. The team is showing promise under the new leadership and in the fall of 2012 posted a respectable finish at the Bill Braxton Regatta taking 2nd in the Men's Novice 4+ only to Temple University. The winter season was seen to have played out nicely for the once again thriving team. After the generous support of Catholic U and various other contributors the team was able to purchase an Empacher 8+ from the US Rowing National Team. Preparations were made to make way for the return of the once annual Capitol Crew Classic Regatta, which, according to University records, was last hosted by The Catholic University of America Rowing Association in 2005 with a total of 13 collegiate level teams in attendance.\nVarsity Program (since 2018).\nIn 2018, the club transitioned into men's and women's varsity programs. Katie O'Driscoll was hired to lead the transition and take the helm of the Division III varsity programs. Catholic University subsequently joined the Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference (MARC), with the men's team also participating in the Intercollegiate Rowing Association The Cardinals first appearance at the Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference (MARC) Championships was 2019. In 2022, Catholic University Men's Rowing participated in the Men's Coxed Four event at the Intercollegiate Rowing Association National Championships, finishing sixth in the fourth level final.\nMid-Atlantic Rowing Conference Championships.\nNo event was held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

She was one of five children; she had two brothers and two sisters. Crawford became interested in basketball when she was only in fifth grade. She learned many of the fundamentals of the game from her brother Robert.\nShe learned enough about the game and was skilled enough to be invited onto the senior team in high school while only a freshman in Van Buren, AR. Crawford and the Van Buren Pointerettes won a state championship in her sophomore, junior and senior season. She was the team captain for the Pointerettes and was selected All-State and All-District all 3 years. She was inducted into the VBHS Hall of Honor in 2000.\nCollege and AAU.\nCrawford attended Clarendon Junior College on a basketball scholarship. She graduated two years later, after helping Clarendon advance to the quarterfinals of the AAU national tournament in 1957. Her performance earned her AAU All-America honors.\nCrawford was offered a scholarship to Wayland Baptist University, one of the basketball powerhouses of the era, but chose to go to Nashville Business College, where Nera White, one of the outstanding players of the era, played. Crawford originally was enrolled in the school's business program, but dropped that and worked as a supervisor in the mail room. As an AAU team, the players did not have to be enrolled as students.\nOver the next twelve seasons, the Nashville team would win the National AAU Championship ten times, and Crawford was named to the All-America team in every year. In 1962, the Nashville team was especially dominant, winning every game in the post-season tournament by at least 14 points, and winning the championship game over Wayland 63–35. She would go on to win the MVP of the 1963 and 1964 AAU National Tournaments.\nCrawford played with Nera White for on the Nashville team for eleven years. Crawford noted, \"We knew almost what each other was going to do. We didn't have to look or aim. A lot of times, in a fast break, I'd just throw it down to Nera, she'd just throw it down to me.\"\nUSA Basketball.\nWith the US National team, Crawford won the World Championship in 1957, and the 1959 and 1963 Pan American Games. The World Championship game was against the USSR, the first time the USA had faced the USSR in a major competition. The USA came into the final with a single loss to Czechoslovakia, while the USSR was undefeated. The USA team was down by three points at the half, but came back in the second half to win the championship 51–48. Crawford scored a game high 27 points in the championship game against Brazil."

It originally was a farm. In 1893, John Tuohy sold the land to his son William who saw it as the perfect opportunity to build a golf course. The resort, including grand hotel, 12 cottages, and 18-hole golf course, drew many people from Milwaukee, Waukesha, and even Chicago. When the course first opened, it was only 25 cents to play 18 holes, but William was known for letting people golf for free if they didn't have enough money.\nIn 1920, William's daughter died making it painful for him to stay at the resort. He left for one year and upon his return he ordered that the hotel be sold and moved. After neglecting the resort, he began to focus on improving and updating the course. A. G. Spalding was asked to design the first two holes on the course, but William wanted the other holes to be shaped by the land. When the depression struck, the resort was forced to cut the golf course down to 9 holes, which it has stayed ever since.\nAfter the death of William in 1939, his widow (Kitty) operated the resort with the aid of her son (Brian William Tuohy), daughter (Mary Tuohy Ryan), and granddaughter (Mary Ann Ryan). The latter three, and a second, non-resident son (Raymond Tuohy) inherited the property on the death of Kitty in the 1950s. Mary Ann was the mother of the present owner, Michael Bolan.\nPresent Day.\nEagle Springs Golf Resort is currently owned by a fifth generation Tuohy, Michael Bolan. The golf course contains nine of the twelve original cottages which are rented out during the summer months. The second hole was named the ninth best par 3 hole in the state of Wisconsin in 2011"

The five newcomers were Union of Morrisania, now in New York City; Tri-Mountain of Boston; Riverside of Portsmouth, Ohio, near Cincinnati; Forest City of Rockford, Illinois, near Chicago; and Chicago or the Chicago White Stockings, the only brand new club. Union was a founding member from the 1857 convention and Forest City had been one of the strongest amateurs remaining in 1869.\nThe records of the teams in professional matches, ranked by wins (see table), reveal three groups of five with sharp outlines. A big group of thirteen and a little of group of two are equally clear, considering the numbers of defeats, pro matches, and all matches (not shown), and are supported by the subsequent history.\nThe two more ambitious newcomers played only a few pro matches and never returned to the professional field. Mighty Cincinnati and venerable Union also shut down after this season. All the others joined the new professional association established that winter (NAPBBP), seven as founding members and four in 1872 or 1873.\nThe Mutuals, Athletics, and Chicago White Stockings survived to found the National League in 1875/76.\nAmateur clubs.\nFour amateur teams defeated professionals more than once and two of them demonstrated that they were as strong as middling pros. Harvard college fielded its strongest team, which toured nationally in the summer and won 6 of 16 against professional teams all season. Star of Brooklyn, featuring Hall of Fame pitcher Candy Cummings, won 6 of 13 against pros.\nPastime of Baltimore won 4 of 24 including 1 of 4 with the Troy Haymakers, 1 of 2 with Olympic, and 2 of 5 with Maryland. The Pastimes lost badly to Harvard and won one of three close matches with the Stars. Resolute of Elizabeth, New Jersey won 2 of 8, both at the expense of venerable Eckford; the Resolutes remained in operation until a failed venture into the professional field in 1873.\nBill Ryczek lists Lowell of Boston and the Keystone of Philadelphia (pro in 1869) among the major teams. They did not defeat any professionals but showed strength comparable to Pastime, Resolute, and the weaker pros.\nConsidering the professionals in three groups of five ranked by wins in pro matches (see table), the stronger pros won 37 of 41 against the six amateur teams covered here; the middling pros won 13 of 18; the weaker pros won 6 of 15.\nHere are the records of those amateurs against the pros.\nOne of the elite professional teams, the Athletics of Philadelphia won eight matches with Harvard, Lowell, Keystone, and Pastime, with 20 to 34 runs scored and 11- to 22-run margins. The average score was about 25 to 10.\nThree amateur clubs of 1870 would later enter the all-professional National Association for one season each: Kekionga of Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1871; Mansfield of Middletown, Connecticut in 1872; Resolute of Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1873.\nHarvard continued to field strong amateur teams, but amateurs would not again hold their own with middling pros. The Stars won a championship in 1871 under the new all-amateur Association (NAABBP), before Candy Cummings joined the pros in 1872."

        "title": "George Wood (baseball)",
        "text": "George Albert Wood (November 9, 1858 – April 4, 1924), also known as \"Dandy\" Wood, was a British North America-born professional baseball player and manager whose career spanned from 1878 to 1896. He played 13 seasons of Major League Baseball, primarily as an outfielder, for the Worcester Ruby Legs (1880), Detroit Wolverines (1881–85), Philadelphia Quakers (1886–89), Philadelphia Athletics (1890–91), Baltimore Orioles (1889, 1892), and Cincinnati Reds (1892). In 1891, he served as both a player and the manager of the Athletics.\nEarly years.\nWood was born in Pownal, Prince Edward Island, British North America, in 1858. He was the son of Joseph A. Wood and Mary Ann Jenkins and is believed to be the first major league player from Prince Edward Island, and one of only three in major league history, along with Henry Oxley and Vern Handrahan. Wood moved with his family to East Boston as a child in 1867.\nProfessional baseball career.\nWorcester.\nWood began his professional baseball career in 1878 and 1879 playing for teams in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Manchester, New Hampshire. His batting average in 1879 was .368. In December 1879, he travelled to Havana as the left fielder of the first American team to play a Cuban all-star team.\nIn 1880, the Worcester baseball club became known as the Worcester Ruby Legs and was admitted to the National League. Wood made his major league debut with Worcester on May 1, 1880. On May 7, 1880, he initiated a triple play. Wood appeared in 81 of 83 games in Worcester's inaugural major league season, with 80 of those games being as an outfielder. Playing against National League competition, Wood's batting average dropped from .368 in 1879 to .245 in 1880. Wood played well defensively, however, and his .887 fielding percentage was the fifth highest among all of the league's outfielders.\nIntegrated baseball.\nWood also participated in an early integrated baseball game. The Chicago Tribune reported on the game as follows: \"A very singular contest took place at New Orleans‚ La.‚ on April 4‚ 1880‚ when five Northern professionals succeeded in defeating the colored professional nine of that city by a score of 17 to 3.\" According to the account reported 14 months later in the Chicago Tribune of July 1881‚ Tim Keefe pitched‚ Charlie Bennett caught‚ John Sullivan played first base‚ while Wood and George Creamer \"were entrusted with the onerous task of filling the other six positions.\"\nDetroit.\nIn 1881, the National League admitted a new club in Detroit, Michigan, which became known as the Detroit Wolverines. Frank Bancroft, who had been Wood's manager in Worcester, was hired as the manager of the new club, and Wood quickly agreed to join Bancroft in Detroit. Wood joined the Wolverines for their inaugural season in 1881 and remained a starter for the club through the 1885 season.\nOn May 2, 1881, Wood hit a triple, scored a run, and turned a double play in the first major league baseball game ever played in Detroit. By the end of the 1881 season, Wood ranked among the National League leaders with nine triples (3rd), 29 extra base hits (8th), 142 total bases (9th), 100 hits (10th), and a .421 slugging percentage (10th). The following year, in 1882, Wood was the National League's home run champion with seven home runs and ranked second in the league with 12 triples. He also led the league's outfielders with eight double plays turned from the outfield and ranked fifth among the league's outfielders with an .884 fielding percentage. Wood's eight double plays in 1882 tied Ned Hanlon for the major league record.\nWood had the best season of his career in 1883. That year, he compiled a .302 batting average with 26 doubles, 11 triples, five home runs, and 47 RBIs. He also showed range in the outfield and led the league's outfielders with 226 outfield putouts. Applying the sabermetric measure of Wins Above Replacement (WAR), Wood's performance in 1883 rated a 3.3, the highest of his career. He continued to have strong seasons in 1884 and 1885 with WAR ratings of 2.1 and 2.4. He would rate above a 2.0 WAR rating only one other time in his career—a 2.8 rating in 1891. On June 12, 1885, Wood became the third player in National League history (and the eighth in any major league) to hit for the cycle.\nPhiladelphia.\nIn November 1885, Wood was returned to the control of the National League and was claimed in January 1886 by the Philadelphia Quakers. Wood played four seasons for the Quakers from 1886 to 1889, compiling a .262 batting average with 80 doubles, 44 triples, 29 home runs, 220 RBIs and 65 stolen bases. Wood was released by the Quakers on September 24, 1889, and appeared in three games for the Baltimore Orioles in the final week of the season. On opening day in 1887, he hit the first home run at the new Philadelphia ball park dubbed the Baker Bowl.\nDuring the winter after the 1888 season, Wood was part of the All-America baseball team that travelled around the world playing a series of games against the Chicago White Stockings. The teams played games in Hawaii, New Zealand, Australia, Ceylon, Egypt, Italy, France, England, and Ireland and met with President Benjamin Harrison at the White House when they returned to the United States in April 1889.\nIn 1890, Wood jumped to the Players' League, playing for the Philadelphia Athletics. Wood compiled a .289 batting average with 20 doubles, 14 triples, nine home runs, 102 RBIs, and 20 stolen bases in the Players' League. He also led the league with 35 outfield assists.\nThe Players' League disbanded after the 1890 season, but the Philadelphia club was admitted to the American Association. Wood stayed with the club and also served as the team's manager in 1891. He led the team to 67–55 record and batted for a career high .309 average, eighth best in the league. He was also among the league's leaders with 14 triples, (8th), 242 times on base (8th), and a .399 on-base percentage (9th).\nBaltimore and Cincinnati.\nThe 1892 season was Wood's last in the major leagues. He played parts of the season for both the Baltimore Orioles (21 games) and the Cincinnati Reds (30 games).\nLater years.\nAfter his playing career was over, Wood served as an umpire for a time. He died in 1924 at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, at age 65. He has been posthumously inducted into the PEI Sports Hall of Fame (2009) and the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame (2011).\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "title": "Bill Foster (basketball, born 1929)",
        "text": "William Edwin Foster (August 19, 1929 – January 7, 2016) was the head men's basketball coach at Rutgers University, University of Utah, Duke University, University of South Carolina, and Northwestern University. He is best known for guiding Duke to the NCAA championship game in 1978, and that year he was named national Coach of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Foster was inducted into the Rutgers Basketball Hall of Fame and was the first NCAA coach to guide four teams to 20-win seasons (Rutgers, Utah, Duke, and South Carolina). Foster was a graduate of Elizabethtown College.\nEarly life.\nFoster was born in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania, in 1929 and grew up in Norwood, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. After serving in the U.S. Air Force, he graduated from Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, in 1954 with a bachelor of science degree.\nCoaching career.\nFoster began his coaching career at Philadelphia-area high schools in the 1950s. One of his students in a typing class at Abington Senior High School was the daughter of Harry Litwack, the longtime basketball coach at Temple University. Foster and Litwack became friends and business partners, and for about 25 years they operated a popular summer basketball camp in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains.\nIn 1960, Foster was hired as the head coach at Bloomsburg State College (now Bloomsburg University), an NCAA Division II school in eastern Pennsylvania, where he compiled a 45–11 record over three years.\nRutgers.\nFoster's Division I career began in 1963 at Rutgers where he led the Scarlet Knights to an overall record of 120–75 (.615) in eight seasons. In the 1966–67 season, the Scarlet Knights finished with a record of 22–7 and was invited to the National Invitation Tournament, the first time the school had qualified for postseason play.\nUtah.\nAfter the 1971 season, Foster took the head coaching job at the University of Utah, replacing legendary Utah basketball coach Jack Gardner. Though his stay with the Utes was short, just three seasons (1971–1974), he led the Utes to a 43–39 (.524) record. He also guided the Utes to the 1974 NIT Championship game, where they finished as runner-up to Purdue. Finishing with a 22–8 record, Foster accepted the head coach position at Duke.\nDuke.\nBill Foster's greatest success as a head coach would come at Duke, taking over a struggling program with a proud history that was searching for stability and strong leadership. Duke was one of only eight schools at that time to have hit the 1,000-victory plateau and had once seen Final Fours and conference championships. \"I knew Duke from the [Vic] Bubas years when they were great, and I thought they could be great again, should be great again. I was a little shocked when they offered me the job, it just seemed like a great place to coach.\" Foster once said.\nFoster's first season of 1974–75 saw few highlights, but there was one. In the 1970s, the four North Carolina member schools of the Atlantic Coast Conference participated in a tournament called \"The Big Four Tournament\". Duke, taking on eighth-ranked rival North Carolina pulled off a shocker in upsetting the Tar Heels 99–96 in overtime. Foster began to slowly rebuild the program, bringing in one future great player a year. First, it was future All-American Jim Spanarkel in 1975, then future Duke great Mike Gminski in 1976. Those two joined senior prolific scorer Tate Armstrong for the 1976–77 season. The Devils started out 12–3 that year with wins over 15th-ranked NC State and later at 15th ranked Tennessee. But, it would not last. In a game at Virginia, Tate Armstrong suffered a broken wrist and was lost for the season. The young Blue Devils, full of potential but still a fragile unit, would never recover but the next year would produce a season that would nearly stun the college basketball world.\nIn addition to talented returnees Spanarkel and Gminski, Foster added Indiana transfer Bob Bender who was on the Hoosiers' legendary undefeated 1976 NCAA championship team and stunned everyone by getting a verbal commitment from one of the top players in America, Gene Banks. Joining Banks were two good players in Kenny Dennard and John Harrell from nearby North Carolina Central. The 1977–78 Duke Blue Devils begin to gain steam after a mid-January 92–84 win over second-ranked North Carolina. Duke would win 15 of their final 19 games, en route to a 27–7 season, a final ranking of seventh, their first ACC Tournament title since 1966, and a trip to the NCAA Final Four. It looked like the ride would end in the national semifinals, as Duke would be facing a 6th-ranked Notre Dame team in the semi-final that fielded eight future NBA players. But Duke scored the upset 90–86, setting up a title matchup with powerhouse Kentucky. Duke fought admirably, but Kentucky was too experienced and had the weight of the world on their shoulders from fans back in the bluegrass who wanted that long-awaited title. Still, despite the loss the future looked tremendous for Duke. The 1977–78 Blue Devils are the subject of John Feinstein's 1989 book \"Forever's Team\".\nThe 1978–79 season saw Duke start the season as the No. 1-ranked team in the nation. The Devils dispatched 14th-ranked North Carolina to win the Big Four Tournament for the first time, but chemistry issues and bad luck with injuries would not recapture the magic of 1978. Duke shared the ACC regular season title, but illness and injury derailed both their ACC tournament and NCAA tournament hopes as Duke finished 22–8 and 11th in the AP poll. Duke had another solid season in 1979–80, defeating second-ranked Kentucky in an early-season matchup and winning another Big Four Tournament over 6th ranked North Carolina 86–74. Duke would assume the nation's No. 1 ranking for several weeks and start out 12–0 on the year. But an injury to valuable forward Kenny Dennard sent the team into an up-and-down league season. After Dennard returned, Duke regrouped and won the 1980 ACC tournament, finished 14th in the AP poll, tallied a 24–9 season, advancing to the Elite Eight after an upset of Kentucky in the sweet 16 in Rupp Arena.\nFoster guided Duke to a 113–64 (.638) record from 1974 to 1980. He was named ACC Coach of the Year in 1978 and led Duke to two ACC men's basketball tournament titles, two Big Four titles, an ACC regular season title in 1979, and an appearance in the 1978 NCAA Final Four, where they finished NCAA runner-up. While Foster is overlooked in the wake of the achievements of Duke coaches Mike Krzyzewski and Vic Bubas, the Foster era returned Duke to national prominence and paved the way for Krzyzewski's success.\nHe was one of two men's basketball head coaches named Bill Foster in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) from 1975 to 1980. The other was at Clemson University. Neither were related to each other. Nicknames were used to differentiate the two, with the Blue Devils coach referred to as Duke Foster and the other as Clem Foster. Upon leaving the ACC for his next coaching assignment, Duke Foster became Chicken Foster.\nSouth Carolina.\nFoster left Duke after six seasons to become the head coach at the University of South Carolina, succeeding legendary coach Frank McGuire. In December 1983, Foster's health became an issue when he suffered what doctors called a \"moderate heart attack.\" He became ill late in a game against Purdue, which South Carolina won, 59–53, and later collapsed in the dressing room. Although he would recover, he was never quite the same as a coach and would eventually resign in 1986 after a losing season. In 1987, the NCAA placed the program on two years' probation for rules violations that occurred during Foster's tenure.\nNorthwestern.\nIn April 1986 Foster was named head coach at Northwestern University, where he would finish his coaching career. He compiled a winning nonconference record, including victories over regional rivals Marquette, DePaul and Loyola of Chicago. However, like his predecessors, he wasn't able to compete with the Big Ten's powerhouse programs for top talent. His Wildcats only won 13 games in Big Ten play, and finished last in the conference in six of his seven seasons.\nA highlight of Foster's tenure was a nationally televised upset of defending national champion Indiana in 1988. But the program was decimated in 1990 when four of Northwestern's more talented players transferred out of the program, including Rex Walters, who left for Kansas (and was later a first-round pick in the 1993 NBA draft).\nThe next season, Northwestern went winless in the Big Ten (0–18) and 5–23 overall. But two freshman starters on that 1990–91 squad, point guard Patrick Baldwin and forward-center Kevin Rankin, would go on to lead the Wildcats to the 1994 NIT as seniors.\nThat 1993–94 team, however, was not coached by Foster. When Northwestern athletic director Bruce Corrie resigned in April 1993, Foster stepped aside as men's basketball coach and became interim athletic director. After Ricky Byrdsong was hired as his successor as coach, Foster continued as interim athletic director until the end of August. In January 1994, Rick Taylor was hired as the school's permanent athletic director.\nLater career.\nUpon leaving Northwestern, Foster became associate commissioner and director of basketball operations for the now-defunct Southwest Conference. He later worked as a consultant with the Western Athletic Conference and the Big 12 Conference. He was a longtime member of the board of trustees of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., serving as chairman from 1996 to 1998.\nFoster was the author of four books, including \"Upward Mobility in Coaching Basketball\" and \"Filling Seats=Dollars.\" He died on January 7, 2016, in Chicago."

        "text": "Randy Thomas (born January 19, 1976) is a former American football guard. He was drafted by the New York Jets in the second round of the 1999 NFL Draft. He played college football at Mississippi State.\nThomas was also a member of the Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins.\nEarly years.\nThomas did not start playing football until he was talked into it from some of his closest friends in the tenth grade at Tri Cities High School. He gained special recognition form in the state of Georgia as a tight end. Thomas also lettered in basketball, playing both forward and center, and played baseball on the prep level, where he was a pitcher.\nCollege career.\nPrior to his career at Mississippi State, Thomas was an All-America, All-State &amp; all-Region selection as a two-year starter at \"tight\" guard at Copiah-Lincoln Community College. He was rated the best JUCO lineman in the state by the Jackson Clarion-Ledger and the fifth-best player overall. He helped Copiah-Lincoln to a 15–5 record during his junior college career, including 8-2 his freshman campaign. Thomas started every game in his two years at Mississippi State after transferring from junior college. He quickly established himself as one of the Bulldogs’ top offensive linemen. Earned 1st-team all-Southeastern Conference honors and was also an SEC Academic Honor Roll recipient. He started all 12 games at RG, led the team with 90 knockdowns as he showed excellent consistency for an offense that gained 3870 yards.\nOn October 4, 2016, Thomas was named to the 2016 SEC Football Legends Class.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Jets.\nThomas was drafted in the second round of the 1999 NFL Draft by the New York Jets.\nHe started all 16 games during his rookie season in 1999 and helped Curtis Martin rush for a team-record 1,464 yards and achieve six 100-yard rushing games. He also kept the Jets sack-free for four games. In 2000, he started all 16 games at right guard and did not miss one snap during the entire season. He played a key role on an offensive line that tied Indianapolis Colts for fewest sacks allowed during the regular season (20) and helped the Jets offense become one of the most dangerous in the NFL, averaging 337.2 yards per game (12th best in the NFL). The passing offense, which averaged 245.3 yards per game, was sixth best in the league. The offensive line shut out opposing defenses five times in the sack category, the best mark in the league. Thomas played and started 13 games for the New York Jets in 2001, missing three games due to an ankle injury. He helped the squad finish with 2,054 (128.4 avg.) rushing yards, good for fourth in the NFL and second in the AFC. He assisted the team to rush for 125 yards or more in eight contests and helped the team average four yards or more in ten games. Thomas helped allow the team to top the 300 total yard mark seven times during the season and assisted in the offense not allowing a sack in five contests. Thomas was the starting right guard for the New York Jets for all 16 games of the 2002 season, clearing the path for Curtis Martin's 1,094 rushing yards on the year. He made his 50th career start, in week five against Kansas City and helped open holes for Martin's 119 yards on the ground. Thomas also helped pave the way for the teams 180 yards rushing and a 41–0 win over the Colts in the AFC wild card game.\nWashington Redskins.\nThomas came to the Redskins for the 2003 season, where he solidified the right guard position and teamed with right tackle Jon Jansen to form a formidable right side of the offensive line for the Redskins offense. Thomas along with John Hall, Laveranues Coles, and Chad Morton were officially nicknamed \"The Jetskins,\" a nickname given to them for all leaving the New York Jets and signing with the Washington Redskins the same year in 2003. Starting all 16 games in 2003, he blocked well for a group of Redskin running backs led by Trung Canidate's 600 rushing yards and was solid in pass protection for Patrick Ramsey and Tim Hasselbeck. He earned a nod as a Pro Bowl third alternate for his efforts. In 2004, he started 15 games at right guard, missing one game due to a severe hamstring injury and helping Clinton Portis rush for 1,315 yards that season.\nOn September 20, 2009, Thomas suffered a severe triceps injury in a game against the St. Louis Rams, tearing the muscle completely off the bone. He was released on March 4, 2010.\nMiami Dolphins.\nThomas signed with the Dolphins on August 18, 2010. He was released on August 25, after re-injuring his arm.\nPersonal.\nDuring the 2004 offseason, Thomas opened up a Rib joint in suburban Atlanta called RT's. The restaurant specializes in southern-style barbecue ribs.\nAlso Thomas took on world-ranked professional eater Sonya Thomas (no relation) and was defeated in a shrimp eating contest."

This is because the level of competition is higher than in the Olympics, where only two teams from the Americas traditionally were permitted to qualify. Cuba has dominated the tournament since its inception. Cubans field their strongest players, while the Americans sent college players, as the schedule does not allow MLB players to participate. In 2013, a women's tournament was added to the program, effective with the 2015 Games. A total of seven men and five women's teams competed in each tournament respectively. In 2019, the women's tournament was not held, while the men's tournament shrank to 8 teams."

        "title": "Ed Hearn (baseball)",
        "text": "Edward John Hearn (born August 23, 1960) is an American professional baseball catcher who played for the New York Mets and Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball from 1986 to 1988. He won the 1986 World Series with the Mets.\nMinor leagues.\nHearn was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the fourth round of the 1978 Major League Baseball Draft after attending Fort Pierce Central High School. After four seasons in their organization in which he failed to reach higher than the double A level, he was released by the Phillies on January 7, 1983. However, he was soon signed as a minor league free agent by the New York Mets.\nHearn spent most of with the Single-A Lynchburg Mets before being promoted to Double-A Jackson, batting .274 with five home runs and 49 runs batted in between the two clubs. In , he led the Jackson Mets with a .312 batting average and tied for second with eleven home runs. He earned his promotion to Triple-A in , spending the whole season with the International League's Tidewater Tides.\nNew York Mets.\nHearn began the season in Tidewater when Barry Lyons won the back-up catcher job out of spring training. Manager Davey Johnson, however, reversed that decision in early May, and Hearn made his major league debut with the Mets on May 17 against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. He went two for three with a single and a double off Bob Welch, and caught Greg Brock, who had stolen a base off him in the third inning, stealing in the seventh.\nWhile Hearn was on the Mets' World Series roster, he was the only player to not make a post-season appearance, as the backup to future Hall of Famer Gary Carter during the teams' 1986 season. He appeared in the team's 1986 music video \"Let's Go Mets Go\".\nCone trade.\nOn March 27, 1987, the Mets traded Hearn, reliever Rick Anderson, and minor league pitcher Mauro Gozzo to the Kansas City Royals for pitcher David Cone and minor league outfielder Chris Jelic. In retrospect, with the all-star career of Cone and the journeyman careers of Hearn, Anderson and Gozzo, this trade is often listed as one of the most lop-sided in major league history.\nHearn was on the opening day roster, and was slated to be the Royals' starting catcher in 1987, until a serious shoulder injury ended his season only nine games into it. After rehabbing his injury, Hearn spent the start of the 1988 season playing in the Florida State League before returning to the Royals. However, he only saw action in 7 more games, and for his career, Hearn only appeared in thirteen games over two seasons for the Royals, batting .257 with no home runs and four runs batted in.\nHearn spent the next four seasons attempting to get back with the majors while toiling away at AA and AAA in the Royals' and Cleveland Indians' organizations. Following 17 games with Cleveland's AAA team, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, Hearn retired from baseball.\nPersonal life.\nExpecting to spend his retirement selling insurance in Overland Park, Kansas, in 1992 Hearn was diagnosed with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Hearn immediately underwent a kidney transplant and was required to take several types of medication on a daily basis. Due to the debilitating effects of the disease, and mood swings caused by the medication, in 1993 Hearn almost committed suicide, but was able to fight his way past it through faith and a chance request for him to give a motivational seminar. Finding a renewed strength, Hearn struggled on despite being treated for skin cancer twice, undergoing two more kidney transplants, and being diagnosed with sleep apnea (requiring mechanical assistance to breathe while sleeping) - all of which forces him to take more than fifty types of medication on a daily basis. \nHearn currently works as a motivational speaker. In 2001, Hearn was awarded the prestigious Certified Speaking Profession designation from the National Speakers Association. He is the first and only professional athlete to receive this designation (only 8% of speakers throughout the world have received this distinguished honor).\nHearn also operates a charity: the Bottom of the Ninth Foundation, which is a mentorship program for children.\nHearn has written an autobiography entitled \"Conquering Life’s Curves – Baseball, Battles &amp; Beyond\". He resides in Shawnee, Kansas with his wife, Trish and son, Cody."

        "text": "Canada has participated in every Commonwealth Games since the first ever British Empire Games held in Hamilton, Ontario in 1930, one of only six countries to have done so. The others are Australia, England, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales.\nHistory.\nNewfoundland competed separately at the 1930 and 1934 Games (although not winning any medals), but since 1950 has competed as part of Canada.\nThe Canadian team won 54 medals in the first (1930) Games, and 51 gold medals at Edinburgh (1986). Canada's biggest total medal tally was 129 medals in Victoria (1994).\nCanada came third in the medal count at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne after Australia and England, and is third on the all-time medal tally of Commonwealth Games, with an overall total of 1318 medals (413 Gold, 443 Silver and 462 Bronze). Canada was top of the medal tally once, at the 1978 games at Edmonton.\nCanada has hosted the games four times. The first Games were at Hamilton, Ontario in 1930. Vancouver hosted the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games notable for the famous \"miracle mile\" (four-minute mile) between Roger Bannister of England and John Landy of Australia at Empire Stadium. Edmonton was the first city to host the Commonwealth Games under that name in 1978, and Victoria, British Columbia hosted the Games in 1994.\nMontreal was set to host the games in 1942 but they were cancelled due to the Second World War. Canada was offered to host them in 1950 but declined.\nHamilton applied to host the 2010 Commonwealth Games but lost to the Delhi bid. Halifax, Nova Scotia withdrew its bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\nThe Commonwealth Games Association in Canada, known as Commonwealth Sport Canada (CSC) is responsible for organizing the Canadian team participating in the Commonwealth Games.\nSee also.\nCanadian medals by Game :"

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2006 season began on January 6, 2007. The postseason tournament concluded with the Indianapolis Colts defeating the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI, 29–17, on February 4, at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\nSchedule.\nUnder the new U.S. television broadcast contracts that took effect starting this season, NBC replaced ABC as the network televising the first two Wild Card playoff games. Fox then televised the rest of the NFC games. CBS broadcast the rest of the AFC playoff games and Super Bowl XLI.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 6, 2007.\nAFC: Indianapolis Colts 23, Kansas City Chiefs 8.\nDespite quarterback Peyton Manning's three interceptions, the Indianapolis Colts out-gained the Kansas City Chiefs in total yards, 435–126, and first downs, 23–8. Indianapolis's defense forced three turnovers, four sacks, and prevented Kansas City from gaining a single first down until late in the third quarter. The game was never in question despite Manning's turnovers as Indianapolis dominated Kansas City from start to finish to earn a trip to Baltimore.\nThe Colts opened up the scoring on their first drive of the game with Adam Vinatieri's 48-yard field goal. The next time they had the ball, they drove 68 yards to the Kansas City 2-yard line, but had to settle for another Vinatieri field goal to give them a 6–0 lead. After another Kansas City punt, Chiefs cornerback Ty Law intercepted a pass from Manning and returned it 43 yards to the Colts 9-yard line. But Kansas City failed to get the ball into the end zone with three rushing attempts and came up empty when Lawrence Tynes' 23-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright. After another interception thrown by Manning and another Kansas City punt, the Colts increased their lead to 9–0 by driving 33 yards and scoring on Vinatieri's 50-yard field goal on the last play of the first half. The Chiefs ended the half with 16 total yards and no first downs. This was the first time in the modern era (post AFL–NFL merger) and the first time since 1960 that an NFL team had been held without an offensive first down in the first half of a playoff game.\nOn the Colts' opening possession of the second half, Manning threw his third interception of the game (and his second to Law), but the Chiefs could not take advantage of the turnover and had to punt. Indianapolis then drove 89 yards in 12 plays and scored with Joseph Addai's 6-yard touchdown run, giving them a 16–0 lead.\nKansas City got their first first down of the game on their ensuing possession, driving 60 yards in eight plays. Trent Green finished the drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Gonzalez, and then completed a pass to tight end Kris Wilson for a successful two-point conversion to cut their deficit to within one touchdown, 16–8. However, the Colts increased their lead to 23–8 on a 71-yard, 9-play drive ending with Reggie Wayne's 5-yard touchdown reception. Indianapolis's defense forced three turnovers on the Chiefs' last three drives to clinch the victory.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Colts, with Indianapolis winning both times in Kansas City, the most recent being 38–31 in the 2003 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 21, Dallas Cowboys 20.\nDallas Cowboys' quarterback Tony Romo, a four-year veteran who earned the starting job and made the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career during the regular season, botched the hold on a potential game-winning field goal with 1:19 left in the fourth quarter, allowing the Seattle Seahawks to escape with a victory.\nTaking advantage of Dallas kicker Martín Gramática's opening kickoff, which went out-of-bounds and gave Seattle the ball at their own 40, the Seahawks marched down the field on their opening drive and scored with Josh Brown's 23-yard field goal. Dallas was forced to punt on their ensuing possession, but Cowboys cornerback Anthony Henry intercepted Seattle's next pass and returned it to the Seahawks 43-yard line, setting up Gramatica's 50-yard field goal to tie the game.\nEarly in the second quarter, Seattle drove 54 yards and retook the lead with Brown's second field goal of the game. After an exchange of punts, the Cowboys took the lead. Aided by Jason Witten's 32-yard reception, Dallas drove 76 yards in ten plays and scored on Romo's 12-yard touchdown pass to Patrick Crayton with only 11 seconds left in the half, giving the Cowboys a 10–6 lead. In the third quarter, Seattle drove 62 yards in 12 plays, featuring two fourth-down conversions by running back Shaun Alexander, and scored with Matt Hasselbeck's 15-yard touchdown pass to Jerramy Stevens, giving them a 13–10 lead. However, Dallas promptly took the lead right back after Miles Austin returned the ensuing kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown.\nEarly in the final quarter, Dallas safety Roy Williams intercepted a pass from Hasselbeck at the Cowboys 43-yard line. Eight plays later, Gramatica kicked a 29-yard field goal to increase his team's lead to 20–13. On Seattle's ensuing drive, a pass interference penalty on Dallas's Terence Newman gave them a first down on the 1-yard line. But Seattle failed to get into the end zone with their next four plays, turning the ball over on downs at the 2-yard line. On the first Dallas play after the turnover, Cowboys receiver Terry Glenn caught a short pass, but then lost a fumble. The ball was recovered by Seattle in the end zone for a touchdown, but after a Dallas challenge the referee ruled the play a safety, cutting the score to 20–15 and giving the ball back to the Seahawks at around the 50-yard line after the ensuing free kick and return. Four plays later, Hasselbeck's 37-yard touchdown pass to Stevens gave Seattle a 21–20 lead. The Seahawks attempted a two-point conversion to give themselves a three-point lead, but Hasselbeck's pass failed.\nDallas took the ensuing kickoff and marched down to the Seahawks' 8-yard line. On third down and 7 from there, Witten caught a pass that was initially ruled a first down on the 1-yard line, but after an instant-replay challenge, officials ruled Witten had been tackled at the 2-yard line, bringing up fourth down. With 1:19 left in the game, Gramatica lined up to attempt a 19-yard field goal, but Romo dropped the ball while setting it up for a hold. Romo picked up the fumble and ran with it, trying for either a touchdown or a first down, but he was tackled at the 2-yard line by safety Jordan Babineaux, turning the ball over on downs and allowing Seattle to run the clock down to eight seconds before punting back to Dallas. On the last play of the game, Romo's Hail Mary pass fell incomplete in the end zone.\n\"I know how hard everyone in that locker room worked to get themselves in position to win that game today and for it to end like that, and for me to be the cause is very tough to swallow right now\", Romo said after the game. \"I take responsibility for messing up at the end there. That's my fault. I cost the Dallas Cowboys a playoff win, and it's going to sit with me a long time. I don't know if I have ever felt this low.\"\nThis was the final game in the Hall of Fame coaching career of Bill Parcells, who resigned his position with the Cowboys two weeks later. Parcells would later take a front office position with the Miami Dolphins but never returned to the sidelines.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Cowboys and Seahawks.\nSunday, January 7, 2007.\nAFC: New England Patriots 37, New York Jets 16.\nTom Brady completed 22 out of 34 passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns, while New England Patriots running backs Corey Dillon, Laurence Maroney, and Kevin Faulk combined for 145 rushing yards in a win over the New York Jets. Receiver Jabar Gaffney, who caught only 11 passes during the season, finished his first career playoff game with eight catches for 104 yards.\nNew England took the opening kickoff and drove down the field, with Gaffney catching three passes for 34 yards on a 65 yard-drive that ended with Dillon's 11-yard touchdown run. Later in the quarter, Hank Poteat recovered a fumble from Dillon on the Patriots 15-yard line, setting up Mike Nugent's 28-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3. On their first possession of the second quarter, the Jets took a 10–7 lead after receiver Jerricho Cotchery (who finished with 100 receiving yards and 19 rushing yards) caught a pass from Chad Pennington and took it 77 yards for a touchdown. However, New England countered with Stephen Gostkowski's 20-yard field goal on their next drive to tie the game. Then, after forcing the Jets to punt, the Patriots marched to New York's 1-yard line. On third down with 11 seconds remaining in the half and no timeouts left, Brady took the snap, faked a handoff to Dillon, and then hit tight end Daniel Graham in the back of the end zone for a touchdown to give them a 17–10 halftime lead.\nNugent kicked a field goal on the Jets' opening drive of the second half, but New England responded with another field goal from Gostkowski to retake their 7-point lead. On the Jets' ensuing possession, linebacker Rosevelt Colvin deflected a lateral from Pennington behind the line of scrimmage. Most of the players on both teams (including Colvin) thought the lateral was an incomplete forward pass and the play was over, but New England's Vince Wilfork realized the play was still ongoing and recovered the fumble. After picking up the ball, Wilfork ran 31 yards to the Jets 15-yard line before being tackled by Cotchery, setting up Gostkowski's third field goal to make the score 23–13.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Nugent kicked his third field goal to cut New York's deficit back to within a touchdown, 23–16. However, the Patriots responded with a 13-play, 63-yard drive that took 6:23 off the clock and ended with Brady's 7-yard touchdown pass to Faulk. Then on the first play of the Jets' ensuing drive, Asante Samuel put the game away by intercepting Pennington's pass and returning it 36 yards for a touchdown.\nThis remains the Patriots' most recent victory on Wildcard Weekend.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Jets and Patriots, with New England winning the prior meeting 26–14 in the 1985 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nNFC: Philadelphia Eagles 23, New York Giants 20.\nPhiladelphia built up a 20–10 fourth quarter lead and thwarted a late Giants comeback attempt, winning on a 38-yard field goal by David Akers on the last play of the game.\nNew York took the opening kickoff and scored quickly, driving 67 yards in seven plays and scoring with Eli Manning's 17-yard touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress only 3:12 into the game. All of the remaining drives of the first quarter ended in punts, but early in the second quarter, Eagles running back Brian Westbrook's 49-yard touchdown run tied the game at seven. Two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Philadelphia cornerback Sheldon Brown intercepted a pass from Manning and returned it to the Giants 37-yard line, setting up a 19-yard field goal by Akers to take a 10–7 lead. On New York's ensuing possession, a 41-yard run by halfback Tiki Barber sparked a 78-yard drive capped by Jay Feely's 20-yard field goal to tie the game with 4:45 left in the half. Philadelphia responded, with quarterback Jeff Garcia leading the Eagles down the field 80 yards in ten plays and finishing it off with a 28-yard touchdown pass to Donté Stallworth, giving his team a 17–10 halftime lead.\nTwo penalties by the Eagles in the second half allowed the Giants to stay close. Late in the third quarter, an illegal block-in-the-back by rookie Tank Daniels nullified Westbrook's second touchdown of the game, which came on a 65-yard punt return. The Eagles still managed to score on their drive with a 48-yard field goal by Akers, increasing their lead to 20–10. The second penalty, a 47-yard pass interference call against Brown, came on the Giants' next possession giving the Giants offense the ball at the Philadelphia 14. The Eagles' defense dug in and forced the Giants to settle for Feely's second field goal of the game from 24 yards out, leaving the Giants down only one touchdown early in the fourth quarter.\nLater in the quarter, the Giants drove to the Eagles 23-yard line. Two false starts and a holding penalty pushed them back to the 43, but Manning overcame the situation by completing three passes to Burress; the first went for 18 yards and the second for 14 and a first down, before the third, an 11-yard strike, found Burress in the end zone for his second touchdown of the game that tied the score with 5:04 to play. Philadelphia responded by driving 46 yards in ten plays, including a first down rush by Westbrook, allowing the Eagles to take the clock all the way down to three seconds before calling on Akers to kick a 38-yard field goal as time expired.\nIn the final game of his career, Barber rushed for a career postseason high 137 yards and caught two passes for 15 yards. Westbrook rushed for 141 yards and a touchdown and caught two passes for 12 yards.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Giants and Eagles. New York won both prior meetings, with the most recent coming in the 2000 NFC Divisional playoffs and ended with a 20–10 final.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 13, 2007.\nAFC: Indianapolis Colts 15, Baltimore Ravens 6.\nAdam Vinatieri's five field goals boosted the Colts to victory over the Ravens in the first NFL playoff game without a touchdown since the .\nIndianapolis forced the Ravens to punt on their opening possession, and Terrence Wilkins gave them good field position with a 21-yard return to their 46-yard line. The Colts subsequently drove to Baltimore's 5-yard line where Vinatieri kicked a field goal to give them a 3–0 lead. On the second play of the Ravens' next drive, Indianapolis linebacker Gary Brackett recovered a fumble from tight end Todd Heap at the Baltimore 31-yard line, setting up another Vinatieri field goal to make the score 6–0.\nLater in the quarter, Cory Ross' 18-yard punt return gave the Ravens a first down on the Colts' 42-yard line. Six plays later, Matt Stover kicked a 40-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter to cut their deficit to 6–3. Two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Baltimore safety Ed Reed intercepted a pass from Peyton Manning at the Ravens' 45-yard line. Baltimore subsequently moved to the ball to the Colts' 4-yard line, but then gave it back when Steve McNair's third-down pass was intercepted by Antoine Bethea. Following the turnover, the Colts marched 63 yards in 13 plays and scored with Vinatieri's third field goal, which hit the cross bar and bounced through the uprights, to give them a 9–3 halftime lead.\nIndianapolis took the second half kickoff and drove 54 yards, featuring a 27-yard catch by tight end Dallas Clark. Vinatieri finished the drive with a 48-yard field goal to increase their lead to 12–3. After an exchange of punts, the Ravens cut the score to 12–6 by driving 62 yards and scoring on a 51-yard field goal from Stover. Then, on the third play of the Colts' ensuing possession, Reed recorded his second interception from Manning, giving his team a first down on their 39-yard line. However, just like his previous pick, the Ravens could not take advantage of the turnover. Five plays later, McNair's pass was intercepted by Nick Harper.\nAfter each team punted once, the Colts put the game away with a 47-yard drive that took 7:16 off the clock and included three successful third down conversions. Vinatieri finished the drive with his fifth field goal, giving Indianapolis a 15–6 lead with only 23 seconds left in regulation. Colts defensive end Robert Mathis then sealed the victory by forcing and recovering a fumble from McNair on the Ravens' final play.\nThe game had added significance to many Baltimore fans, due to the circumstances of the Colts' departure from Baltimore 23 years earlier. The Indianapolis Colts advanced to their second AFC Championship Game in four years. It was the third consecutive playoff defeat for the Ravens.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Colts and Ravens.\nNFC: New Orleans Saints 27, Philadelphia Eagles 24.\nThe Saints gained 208 rushing yards and 435 total yards, both postseason franchise records, along with 158 return yards on special teams en route to a 27–24 victory over the Eagles, allowing them to advance to the conference championship game for the first time in the team's 40-year history.\nIn the first quarter, a 28-yard run from New Orleans' Deuce McAllister set up a 33-yard field goal from John Carney to open up the scoring. Later in the quarter, two big plays from the Saints, a 25-yard run by Reggie Bush and a 35-yard reception by Devery Henderson, set up Carney's second field goal 15 seconds into the second quarter, making the score 6–0.\nThree plays after the kickoff, Eagles quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 75-yard touchdown pass to Donté Stallworth to give his team a 7–6 lead. The Saints responded with a 78-yard drive, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown run by Bush to retake the lead at 13–7. However, the Eagles stormed right back, driving 80 yards in 11 plays. On third down and goal, running back Brian Westbrook took a handoff and jumped over top of the defensive line and fell into the end zone for a touchdown, giving them a 14–13 lead with 50 seconds left in the half. New Orleans returner Michael Lewis returned the kickoff 25 yards to their 35-yard line. With two seconds left, quarterback Drew Brees threw a Hail Mary pass to the end zone. Wide receiver Marques Colston initially caught the ball, but it squirted out of his arms as he fell to the ground, and was ruled an incompletion.\nPhiladelphia took the second-half kickoff and scored in just three plays with a 62-yard touchdown romp from Westbrook, increasing their lead to 21–13. However, Lewis returned their kickoff 36 yards to the 37-yard line, where the Saints drove 63 yards in 8 plays, the longest a 29-yard completion from Brees to tight end Billy Miller. McAllister finished the possession with a 5-yard touchdown run, making the score 21–20. Then after forcing a punt, New Orleans drove to the Eagles' 29-yard line. After two penalties (a holding call against the Saints and an illegal contact call against the Eagles), McAllister rushed for 25 yards and followed it up with an 11-yard touchdown reception, giving the Saints a 27–21 lead.\nWith less than a minute left in the third quarter, Philadelphia safety Reno Mahe's 25-yard punt return sparked a 9-play, 66-yard drive featuring a 24-yard completion from Garcia to Reggie Brown. David Akers completed the drive with a 24-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to three points with 11:07 left on the clock. After an exchange of punts, the Saints drove from their 29 to the Eagles 35-yard line with 3:24 left in the game. New Orleans was in great position to take more time off the clock and increase their lead, but Bush fumbled a high pitch from Brees and Philadelphia's Darren Howard recovered the ball, giving his team a chance to drive for a tying field goal. However, the Eagles were unable to get a first down. They appeared to convert a fourth and 10 to Hank Baskett, but the loud crowd noise had muted the whistles of a false start by guard Scott Young, originally a backup to injured starter Shawn Andrews. After that, they chose to punt the ball back with 1:57 left. The Saints then clinched the victory by keeping possession of the ball for the rest of the game.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Eagles and Saints. Philadelphia won the only prior meeting 36–20 in the 1992 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nSunday, January 14, 2007.\nNFC: Chicago Bears 27, Seattle Seahawks 24 (OT).\nRobbie Gould's 49-yard field goal in overtime propelled the Bears over the Seahawks and to their first NFC Championship Game since the 1988 season. This was also their first playoff win since 1994.\nChicago started the game with a 12-play, 70-yard possession, featuring a 37-yard completion from Rex Grossman to Rashied Davis. Running back Thomas Jones capped off the drive with a 9-yard touchdown run. Seahawks receiver Nate Burleson gave his team great field position with a 41-yard kickoff return to the 47-yard line, but the Bears forced Seattle to punt after three plays. Then, after forcing Chicago to punt, Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck tied the score with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Burleson on the first play of the second quarter. However, Grossman threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, giving his team a 14–7 lead.\nLater in the quarter, Grossman lost a fumble while being sacked by Julian Peterson, and Seattle's Chuck Darby recovered the ball at the Bears' 26-yard line. Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander subsequently took the ball into the end zone with four running plays, the last one a 4-yard touchdown run to tie the game. Seattle decided to squib kick the ensuing kickoff to prevent a long return, but Bears tight end Gabe Reid gave Chicago good field position with a 20-yard return to the 43-yard line. After the two-minute warning, Grossman completed a 21-yard pass to Muhsin Muhammad and followed it up with an 18-yard completion to Rashied Davis, advancing the ball to the 7-yard line. Following a timeout, Jones scored his second rushing touchdown, giving the Bears a 21–14 halftime lead.\nOn the opening drive of the third quarter, Josh Brown's 54-yard field goal cut the Seahawks deficit to 21–17. Then, after the Bears were forced to punt, receiver Deion Branch caught two passes for 33 yards on a 7-play, 51-yard drive that ended with Alexander's second touchdown on a 13-yard run, making the score 24–21. Chicago responded by advancing the ball to the Seahawks 10-yard line, but cornerback Pete Hunter ended the drive by intercepting a pass intended for Muhammad. However, Ricky Manning intercepted Hasselbeck's next pass and returned it to the 32-yard line. Chicago ended up getting pushed back to the 36 and decided to punt rather than risk a 54-yard field goal attempt.\nIn the fourth quarter, Chicago lost a scoring opportunity when Devin Hester's 63-yard punt return touchdown was nullified by an illegal block penalty on Manning. Instead, they ended up driving 48 yards and scoring with Gould's 41-yard field goal to tie the game. Seattle responded with a drive to Chicago's 46-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs when Alexander was tackled for a 1-yard loss by Lance Briggs on fourth and 1 with under two minutes left in regulation. However, Chicago was unable to get a first down and had to punt. Seattle then drove to the Bears 45-yard line, but Tank Johnson sacked Hasselbeck for a 9-yard loss with less than 30 seconds left in regulation, and the game ended up going into overtime.\nSeattle won the coin toss, but had to punt after three plays. On the punt, Chicago defender Israel Idonije broke through the offensive line and attempted to block the kick. He didn't quite make it there in time, but he forced Ryan Plackemeier to rush his punt, which ended up going just 18 yards to the Chicago 36-yard line. Two plays later, a 30-yard reception by Davis set up Gould's game-winning 49-yard field goal.\nThe game was later featured in an episode of NFL Greatest Games called \"A Wild One In The Windy City!\".\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Bears.\nAFC: New England Patriots 24, San Diego Chargers 21.\nIn the final game of the divisional playoffs, the New England Patriots faced the San Diego Chargers, who were unbeaten at home in the regular season. The Chargers' roster included league MVP running back LaDainian Tomlinson, who broke several league records, nine Pro Bowlers, and five All-Pro players. However, four Chargers turnovers, three of which were converted into Patriots scoring drives, helped lead to a Chargers loss. San Diego lost despite outgaining the Patriots in rushing yards, 148–51 and total yards, 352–327, while also intercepting three passes from Tom Brady.\nIn the first quarter, after San Diego coach Marty Schottenheimer opted to go for it on fourth and 11 instead of attempting a 47-yard field goal, quarterback Philip Rivers lost a fumble while being sacked by Mike Vrabel, setting up Stephen Gostkowski's 51-yard field goal with 40 seconds left in the quarter. In the second quarter, Chargers receiver Eric Parker's 13-yard punt return set up a 48-yard scoring drive that ended with Tomlinson's 2-yard touchdown run, giving his team a 7–3 lead. Then, on the Patriots' next drive, linebacker Donnie Edwards intercepted a pass from Brady and returned it to the 41-yard line. But the Chargers ended up punting after Rivers was sacked on third down by Artrell Hawkins. Later in the quarter, Tomlinson rushed twice for 13 yards and took a screen pass 58 yards to the Patriots' 6-yard line, setting up a 6-yard touchdown run by Michael Turner with 2:04 left in the half. New England responded with a 72-yard scoring drive, with receiver Jabar Gaffney catching four passes for 46 yards, including a 7-yard touchdown reception with six seconds left in the half, cutting their deficit to 14–10.\nIn the second half, Brady threw his second interception of the game. But once again, the Chargers were forced to punt after Rivers was sacked on third down. Mike Scifres' 36-yard punt pinned New England back at their own 2-yard line, and San Diego subsequently forced a punt, but Parker muffed the kick and New England's David Thomas recovered the fumble at the Chargers' 31-yard line. New England's drive seemed to stall after Brady fumbled on third and 13. Patriots' offensive tackle Matt Light recovered it and Chargers safety Drayton Florence drew a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for taunting Patriots tight end Daniel Graham. The drive continued and Gostkowski eventually kicked a 34-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 14–13. Then, on San Diego's next drive, linebacker Rosevelt Colvin intercepted a pass from Rivers at the New England 36-yard line. The Patriots then drove to the Chargers 41-yard line, but were halted there and had to punt. After the punt, Rivers completed two passes to tight end Antonio Gates for 31 yards and a 31-yard pass to Vincent Jackson, setting up Tomlinson's second rushing touchdown to give the Chargers an 8-point lead, 21–13.\nNew England responded by driving to San Diego's 41-yard line. On a fourth-down conversion attempt, Brady's pass was intercepted by Marlon McCree, but Troy Brown stripped the ball, and receiver Reche Caldwell recovered it. Schottenheimer unsuccessfully challenged the play and lost a timeout. Four plays later, Brady threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Caldwell. On the next play, running back Kevin Faulk took a direct snap and scored the two-point conversion, tying the game. Then, after forcing a punt, Brady completed a 19-yard pass to Graham. Two plays later, Caldwell caught a 49-yard strike down the right sideline to set up Gostkowski's third field goal to give them a 24–21 lead with only 1:10 left in the fourth quarter. With no timeouts left, San Diego drove to the Patriots 36-yard line on their final possession, but Nate Kaeding's 53-yard field goal attempt fell short with three seconds remaining in the game.\nOne month later, Schottenheimer was fired by San Diego, ending his 21-year coaching career. His 14–2 season with the Chargers was his best regular season record ever, and he is the only coach in NFL history to be fired after racking up 14 wins.\nThis was the Patriots last road playoff victory until the 2018 AFC Championship Game in Kansas City.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Patriots and Chargers, with San Diego winning the prior meeting 51–10 in the 1963 AFL Championship Game.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 21, 2007.\nNFC: Chicago Bears 39, New Orleans Saints 14.\nAlthough the Saints outgained the Bears in total yards, 375–335, their four turnovers (three fumbles and one interception) contributed to a Bears victory.\nOn the opening drive of the game, Saints receiver Devery Henderson caught a 40-yard pass at the Bears' 32-yard line. But three plays later, Bears defensive end Israel Idonije sacked quarterback Drew Brees on the 36-yard line, and the Saints decided to punt rather than attempt a 54-yard field goal.\nWith 5:28 remaining in the first quarter, Bears cornerback Nathan Vasher recovered a fumble from Marques Colston and returned it 14 yards to the Saints' 36-yard line. Several plays later, Robbie Gould kicked a 19-yard field goal to give the Bears a 3–0 lead. Then, Chicago's Danieal Manning recovered a fumble from Michael Lewis on the ensuing kickoff, setting up Gould's second field goal to increase the lead to 6–0. New Orleans was forced to punt on their next possession, and Devin Hester gave his team good field position with a 10-yard return to the Saints' 49-yard line. Two plays later, tight end Desmond Clark's 30-yard reception moved the ball to the 19. Once again, New Orleans kept Chicago's offense out of the end zone, but Gould kicked his third field goal to give the Bears a 9–0 lead. Then, after forcing another punt, Chicago stormed down the field on a drive in which running back Thomas Jones carried the ball on eight consecutive plays, gaining 69 yards and finishing it off with a 2-yard touchdown run. This time, New Orleans managed to respond, with Brees completing five passes for 73 yards on their ensuing possession, the last one a 13-yard touchdown pass to Colston, to cut their deficit to 16–7 by halftime.\nTwo plays after forcing a punt from Chicago on the opening drive of the second half, running back Reggie Bush caught a pass from Brees and took it 88 yards for a touchdown to cut the deficit to two points. Then after forcing another punt, New Orleans drove to the Bears' 29-yard line. But this time, they failed to score, as Brees threw three incompletions and Billy Cundiff missed a 47-yard field goal attempt.\nAfter the ensuing kickoff, Brad Maynard's 51-yard punt gave the Saints the ball at their own 5-yard line. Two plays later, Brees committed an intentional grounding penalty in the end zone, resulting in a safety. Two possessions later, Chicago stormed 85 yards in five plays, with quarterback Rex Grossman completing four consecutive passes for 73 yards, the last one a 33-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian, increasing their lead to 25–14.\nThe next time the Bears had the ball, they scored another touchdown with a 12-yard run by Cedric Benson on a drive that was set up after Brees lost a fumble while being sacked by Adewale Ogunleye. Then, on New Orleans' next drive, Brees was intercepted by Vasher. After the ensuing possession, Maynard's 46-yard punt pinned the Saints at their own 8-yard line, and the Saints could only reach their own 30 before turning the ball over on downs. Five plays later, Jones closed out the scoring with a 15-yard touchdown run, making the final score 39–14.\nIn addition, Bush became the fifth Heisman Trophy winner to play in a conference championship game the year after winning the trophy. Mike Garrett, who also went to the University of Southern California, did so with the Chiefs in 1966 (technically it was the AFL title game since the league didn't merge until 1970), Tony Dorsett did with the Cowboys in 1977, Earl Campbell did with the Houston Oilers in 1978 and Ron Dayne did with the Giants in 2000. Campbell and Bush are the only two of those to not advance to the Super Bowl in that season. (Bush has since vacated the Heisman Trophy due to ineligibility during the 2005 NCAA football season.)\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Saints and Bears. Chicago won the previous meeting 16–6 in the 1990 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nAFC: Indianapolis Colts 38, New England Patriots 34.\nThe Colts gained 455 offensive yards, 32 first downs, and managed to overcome a 21–3 deficit to the Patriots to earn their first trip to the Super Bowl since the 1970 NFL season. Their 18-point comeback was the largest ever in an NFL conference championship game (since tied by the Cincinnati Bengals in the 2021 AFC Championship game), and tied the record for the fourth largest NFL postseason comeback. The Colts' win came after the Patriots had eliminated the Colts from the playoffs twice in the previous three seasons.\nMidway through the first quarter, the Patriots drove 71 yards to the Colts' 4-yard line, featuring a 35-yard run by Corey Dillon. On third down, running back Laurence Maroney fumbled a handoff, but the ball rolled into the end zone where Patriots guard Logan Mankins recovered it for a touchdown. The Colts responded by driving 56 yards and scoring with Adam Vinatieri's 42-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3. On their ensuing drive, the Patriots drove to a fourth down on the Colts' 34-yard line. Rather than attempt a 52-yard field goal, New England decided to go for it and Tom Brady completed a 27-yard pass to Troy Brown. On the next play, Dillon scored on a 7-yard touchdown run. Then, two plays after the ensuing kickoff, cornerback Asante Samuel intercepted a pass from Peyton Manning and returned it 39 yards for a touchdown, giving New England a 21–3 lead. Later in the quarter, Indianapolis drove 80 yards in 15 plays, with Vinatieri finishing the drive with a 26-yard field goal, cutting the score to 21–6 with 11 seconds left in the half.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, the Colts drove 79 yards in 15 plays and scored with a 1-yard run by Manning. Then, after forcing a punt, a 25-yard reception by Dallas Clark and a 19-yard run by Dominic Rhodes moved the ball to the Patriots' 32-yard line. Following a pass interference penalty on Ellis Hobbs in the end zone, Manning threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to defensive tackle Dan Klecko, who had lined up at the fullback position on the play. Then, receiver Marvin Harrison caught a 2-point conversion pass to tie the game at 21.\nHobbs returned the ensuing kickoff 80 yards to the Colts' 21-yard line. Four plays later, Brady threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to receiver Jabar Gaffney, who made a leaping catch in the back of the end zone. Although he landed out of bounds, officials ruled that he was pushed out while in the air, and the Patriots took a 28–21 lead. Rhodes started out the Colts' next drive with two receptions for 23 yards and a 9-yard run. Then, Clark caught a 23-yard pass at the 9-yard line. Three plays later, Rhodes fumbled the ball at the 1-yard line, but Colts center Jeff Saturday recovered it in the end zone for a touchdown to tie the game. Mankins and Saturday's touchdowns marked the first time in NFL playoff history in which more than one offensive lineman scored a touchdown in the same game.\nAfter an exchange of punts, New England kicker Stephen Gostkowski made a 28-yard field goal to give them a three-point lead. The Colts responded with a 36-yard field goal by Vinatieri, set up by Clark's 52-yard reception, to tie the game at 31. Hobbs returned Vinatieri's kickoff 41 yards to the Patriots' 46-yard line. Then, Brady completed a 25-yard pass to tight end Daniel Graham. Indianapolis managed to halt the drive at their 25-yard line, but Gostkowski kicked a 43-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 34–31 lead with 3:49 left in the game. New England's defense subsequently forced a punt, but the Patriots ended up punting back to the Colts after running only a minute off the clock.\nManning started off the drive with three nonconsecutive completions for 58 yards, with a roughing-the-passer penalty on the third play adding another 12, moving the ball 70 yards in a span of 19 seconds and bringing up a first down at the Patriots' 11-yard line. Three plays later, Joseph Addai's 3-yard touchdown run gave the Colts their first lead of the game with only one minute remaining. Brady responded by leading his team to the Colts' 45-yard line. But cornerback Marlin Jackson intercepted Brady's next pass with 17 seconds left, ending the game, and sending the Colts to their third Super Bowl in team history (first as the Indianapolis Colts).\nThe Colts were the first #3 seed since the NFL expanded the playoffs in 1990 to host a conference championship game and the first overall since the Washington Redskins did so in 1987. It was also the first time since said season where a team hosted a championship game after playing a road game in the divisional round, and was also the first conference championship game in which neither team had the first round bye and had to play three rounds to get to the Super Bowl.\nHobbs set a Patriots franchise record with 220 kickoff return yards, the second highest total in NFL postseason history.\nThe game was featured as one of the \"NFL's Greatest Games\" as Peyton's Revenge. For the Patriots, it was their last road playoff loss until the 2013 AFC Championship Game at Denver (whom Manning had joined after leaving Indianapolis).\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Patriots and Colts. New England won the previous two meetings in consecutive years, with New England's most recent victory by a score of 20–3 in the 2004 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nSuper Bowl XLI: Indianapolis Colts 29, Chicago Bears 17.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Colts and Bears."

        "title": "Mike Anderson (basketball, born 1959)",
        "text": "Michael Andre Anderson (born December 12, 1959) is an American basketball coach, most recently the head coach of the St. John's Red Storm. He came to St. John's after previously serving as head coach at UAB, Missouri and Arkansas. He also served as an assistant/associate head coach under Nolan Richardson at Arkansas for 17 years. Over his 20 seasons as a head coach, Anderson has compiled a 414–235 record, 11 20-win campaigns, 9 NCAA Tournament appearances, two Sweet 16 berths and a run to the 2009 Elite Eight. Anderson is one of just 3 current Division I head coaches with 15+ years of experience and no losing seasons, along with Mark Few and Tom Izzo.\nPlaying career.\nAnderson was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, where he attended Jackson-Olin High School in the Ensley-Pratt City neighborhood, leading the Mustangs to the semifinals of the Alabama state basketball tournament and averaging 19 points per game in his junior and senior years and winning all-state honors. Anderson moved on to Jefferson State Community College in Birmingham, where he was spotted by an opposing coach named Nolan Richardson. When Richardson was offered the coaching job at the University of Tulsa, he quickly offered Anderson a scholarship. In Anderson's two years with the Golden Hurricane he averaged 12 points a game, and the team won an NIT title and gained an NCAA tournament berth.\nCoaching career.\nAssistant positions.\nAfter graduating in 1982, Anderson went into substitute teaching while looking for a coaching job. Richardson brought him on to the University of Tulsa's staff as a volunteer assistant. When Richardson moved on to the University of Arkansas, he brought Anderson along as an assistant for a 17-year stint, the last five as assistant head coach. During that time, the Razorbacks won three Southwest Conference championships, two Southeastern Conference titles, three appearances in the Final Four, a national championship in 1994 and a second-place finish in 1995. When Richardson was fired, Anderson took over for the remainder of the 2001–02 season as interim head coach.\nUAB.\nIn 2002, Anderson returned to his hometown of Birmingham to take over the program at UAB, which was coming off a 13–17 season and had only one NCAA appearance since 1995. Anderson quickly turned the program around, leading the team to 22 wins and a National Invitation Tournament Quarterfinals appearance. Anderson then led the Blazers to three straight appearances in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. In 2004, the Blazers advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by virtue of a 76–75 upset victory over the University of Kentucky, the tournament's overall #1 seed. UAB ended the season ranked 23rd in the USA Today coaches' poll. Anderson was named Conference USA Coach of the Year, and is the only coach in UAB history to take the Blazers to the post season every year of his tenure.\nMissouri.\nFirst two seasons (2006–2008).\nAnderson was then hired in 2006 to take over the mess at the University of Missouri, rehabilitating a program that was under investigation under Quin Snyder. Anderson's first team, a collection of transfers and raw talent, went 18–12 but missed out on post-season play after a loss to Baylor in the Big 12 Tournament. His 2007–08 campaign saw the inclusion of his nephew DeMarre Carroll, a transfer from Vanderbilt, but also was hit by scandal, as a group of players (the \"Athena Five\", so named for where the incident took place) were arrested for a fight in a Columbia nightclub. That incident marked the second disciplinary issue of the season for Anderson's team. Before the season, starting forward Kalen Grimes had been dismissed from the team after being arrested for hitting a man with the butt of a shotgun. The Tigers finished 16–16, losing in the Big 12 Tourney to Nebraska and missing out on post-season play.\nThird season (2008–09).\nAnderson's third season at Mizzou in 2008–09 brought with it many questions: How well would he be able to blend his seven new players (five freshman and two transfers) with the remaining Tigers from the previous season including the only two remaining players from the Quin Snyder era? After failing to reach the post season his first two seasons would Mike Anderson be able to lead his Tigers to an NIT or NCAA post season tournament? Missouri was picked to finish 7th in the Big 12 by the coaches. The Tigers season got off to a great start with a 9–1 record including wins over USC and Cal and a close loss to a top 25 team (Xavier) in Puerto Rico. The Tigers finished their non-conference schedule with a record of 13–2. The team lost the conference opener but responded by winning eleven of their next twelve Big 12 games including a last-second win at Texas, which earned them a national ranking, and then a memorable win over their arch rival Kansas at home, where the Tigers climbed back from a 14-point halftime deficit to win the game after Zaire Taylor's game winning shot with 1.3 seconds remaining. Mike Anderson's 2008–09 Tiger team finished their last home game of the season by beating #5 Oklahoma on senior night. The Tigers went undefeated at home, winning 18 games. The Tigers then won the Big 12 Conference tournament by defeating Texas Tech, Oklahoma State and Baylor (Mar. 14) on successive nights. Victories over Cornell, Marquette and Memphis pushed the Tigers into the Elite 8, where top-seeded UConn ended Missouri's run with an 82–75 win.\nAnderson was also one of ten finalists for the 2008–09 Henry Iba Award. The other 9 finalists were John Calipari, Memphis; Bill Self (eventual winner), Kansas; Jamie Dixon, Pittsburgh; Mike Montgomery, California; Stew Morrill, Utah State; Matt Painter, Purdue; Oliver Purnell, Clemson, and Brad Stevens, Butler.\nOn March 31, 2009, Anderson signed a 7-year extension at Missouri, passing up an offer from the University of Georgia. The extension increased Anderson's base salary to $1.6 million and up to $2.2 million with incentives. The offer Anderson reportedly turned down from Georgia was worth more than $2 million a year. Anderson also turned down a $3 million a year offer to coach the University of Oregon during the summer of 2010.\nFinal two seasons (2009–2011).\nAnderson's teams went 23–11 and finished fifth in the conference in both of his final two seasons with Missouri. The Tigers made the NCAA tournament both years but never finished above third place in conference during his tenure. This three-year span was the first time the team had made three or more consecutive trips to the NCAA tournament since 2003. That same three-year span is the first time the Tigers had won more than 20 games three years in a row since 1980–1983.\nLeaving Missouri.\nDuring the final month of Anderson's tenure at the University of Missouri, his name became linked with the Arkansas opening because of John Pelphrey's increasingly unstable job status. On March 4, 2011, Anderson dismissed the rumors, telling Columbia Tribune sportswriter Steve Walentik he planned to stay at MU for \"a long time, retire here.\"\nOn March 14, Arkansas fired Pelphrey. Nine days later, Anderson accepted the head coaching position at Arkansas. The departure stunned Missouri fans, especially in light of Anderson's comments to the Tribune earlier in the month. According to MU guard Marcus Denmon, Anderson told him days before leaving that he would stay at MU and \"didn't plan on changing.\" Anderson did not hold a press conference after accepting the Arkansas job, but Denmon, forward Laurence Bowers and guard Kim English—three players recruited to Missouri by Anderson—expressed both disappointment and understanding of Anderson's decision.\nLater in the week, when Anderson held his introductory press conference at Arkansas, a reporter from KOMU traveled to Fayetteville to ask Anderson why he did not address fans or media in Columbia. Anderson denied that claim, citing a press release on Arkansas's official athletic website as the official \"good-bye.\" Fans at the press conference booed the reporter, but Anderson told the crowd the questions were \"legit,\" and that \"Columbia was great to Mike Anderson.\"\nMissouri eventually hired Frank Haith to succeed Anderson. In his first press conference, Haith said Anderson told him the new Missouri players would love him.\nArkansas.\nOn March 23, 2011, Anderson signed a seven-year contract with the University of Arkansas worth $2.2 million a year. On April 6, 2011, the University of Arkansas announced Anderson's entire coaching staff, which included Melvin Watkins. T.J. Cleveland, and Matt Zimmerman, would follow him from Missouri.\nFirst three seasons.\nAnderson meandered through his first two seasons back at the place he began his coaching career, finishing with winning records (18–14 and 19–13) but was unable to secure a spot in any postseason play, as they finished ninth and seventh in the Southeastern Conference standings.\nIn 2013–14, the Razorbacks returned to the postseason for the first time since 2008, earning a spot in the NIT. Improving its SEC Tournament seeding by two spots for the second straight year under Anderson, Arkansas finished fifth in the league standings at 10–8 while reaching the 20-win plateau (22–12) for the first time since the aforementioned 2007–08 campaign. Highlighting the 22-win season was the program's first-ever season sweep of SEC rival Kentucky and a 5–1 mark against teams that advanced to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament and NIT. The Arkansas faithful saw signs of the Nolan Richardson-era style of play that Anderson utilizes, as the Razorbacks led the SEC in scoring (80.1), assists (15.3), steals (8.4), and turnover margin (+5.5), figures that all ranked in the top 30 in the nation. Individual development was also critical to Arkansas’ improvement in 2013–14, as 6'10\" Bobby Portis became the sixth freshman in program history to earn All-SEC honors as a freshman, snagging a spot on the All-SEC second team, SEC All-Freshman squad and USBWA All-District VII team.\n2014–15 season.\nOn January 6, 2015, it was announced that Anderson had signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him with Arkansas through 2020. Anderson led Arkansas to the NCAA tournament in his fourth season, while making it to the finals of the SEC tournament in the process. The Razorbacks were given a No. 5 seed, their highest seed in the tournament since 1999, when Anderson was still an assistant under Richardson. The Razorbacks advanced to the round of 32 before losing to North Carolina. Portis was named SEC Player of the Year, and was drafted with the 22nd pick by the Chicago Bulls in the 2015 NBA draft. Swingman Michael Qualls declared for the draft, but sustained an injury and wasn't selected, instead signing a free agent deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder and Rashad Madden signed a D-League contract with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n2015–16 season.\nOn February 23, 2016, Anderson won his 100th game as the Arkansas coach and his 300th overall with an 85–65 victory over LSU. The Razorbacks finished the season 16–16, 9–9 in SEC play to finish in a tie for eighth place. They lost in the second round of the SEC tournament to Florida.\n2016–17 season.\nAnderson's sixth Razorback unit got off to the best start since he took over as coach. He signed three of the top six junior college players (Jaylen Barford, Daryl Macon, and Arlando Cook) in the off-season to load the Razorback roster up for a tournament run. With preseason SEC Player of the Year Moses Kingsley and sharpshooter Dusty Hannahs returning to lead the squad, the Razorbacks finished the regular season 23–8. Their 10–1 start bested his 9–2 starts in 2013–14 and 2014–15. The team won six SEC road games for only the third time in school history, joining the 1994 national champions and the 2015 team. They tied South Carolina for third in the league with a conference record of 12–6, and advanced to the finals of the SEC tournament, losing to Kentucky 82–65. The No. 8-seeded Razorbacks advanced to the NCAA tournament and defeated Seton Hall in their first game before falling to top-seeded and eventual national champion North Carolina in the second round, 72–65.\n2017–18 season.\nOn January 26, 2018, it was announced that Anderson had signed another two-year contract extension, keeping him under contract until 2022. The Razorbacks finished in a tie for fourth in the SEC, which sent a record eight teams to the NCAA tournament. Butler ended their season in the first round, 79–62.\n2018–19 season.\nAnderson had to start over in his eighth season with the Razorbacks, welcoming nine new players with Daniel Gafford the only returning player of note. The team finished in a tie for ninth in the SEC with Alabama, lost its opening SEC Tournament game to Florida and then went 1–1 in the NIT to close out the year.\nTermination.\nOn March 26, 2019, it was announced that Arkansas had dismissed Anderson as head coach, marking the end of 25 years of association with the University of Arkansas as both an assistant and head basketball coach. He was replaced by former Nevada head coach Eric Musselman.\nSt. John's.\nThe 59-year-old was named the head coach at St. John's University on April 19, 2019, replacing Chris Mullin.\nOn Feb. 16, 2021, Anderson won his 400th game as his Red Storm defeated Xavier. Anderson was named Big East Coach of the Year for the 2020–21 season. Anderson was given a 6-year extension as a result of his first two seasons at St. John's.\nTermination.\nSt. John’s fired men’s basketball Anderson on March 10, 2023, one day after his fourth season in charge ended with an overtime loss to No. 6 Marquette in the Big East Tournament quarterfinals. \nLawsuit.\nAnderson disputed the assertion that he was fired for cause and filed a notice of intent to arbitrate, seeking the guaranteed money that was owed to him under the terms of his contract as well as an additional $34.2 million in punitive damages, a total of $45.6 million. He alleges St. John's made the claim that it was firing him for cause in March 2023, only so the school could avoid paying his buyout and use the money to hire Rick Pitino, who was hired on March 20, 2023.\nPersonal life.\nAnderson and his wife, Marcheita, have four children: Darcheita, Michael Jr., Suney Alexander (Desmond Alexander) and Yvonne; and four grandchildren. Yvonne was a four-year letterwinner for the Texas Longhorns women's basketball team.\nNephew DeMarre Carroll was Missouri's leading scorer his senior year in 2008–09, played 11 seasons in the NBA and is currently an assistant coach for the Lakers."

        "text": "The Closing Ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games was held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 26 March 2006.\nPerformances.\nCountdown.\nThe ceremony began with a countdown at the screen starting at 17, footage from previous games appeared with Melbourne at the end complete with an image of fireworks with numbers between 17 and 1 being from previous games until 0 from currents games\nMusic of Australia.\nThe ceremony began with a fireworks show. This was followed by Grinspoon's Pat Davern suspended on the Great Southern Stand of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) playing a guitar (equipped with pyrotechnics which produced sparks) whilst being lowered onto the stadium ground, giving a rock concert feel to the closing ceremony. Grinspoon performed their hits \"Hard Act To Follow\" and \"Better Off Alone\". During the performance under 18 TAC Cup Australian rules football players, accompanied by several contemporary key figures of the sport entered through a banner, running out into formation. Ballerinas dressed in club colours followed.\nMelbourne musician Paul Kelly performed \"Leaps and Bounds\", while various costumed performers representing Melburnians entered the arena, in addition to a number of significant Melbourne landmark icons such as Flinders Street station, The Skipping Girl Vinegar Sign, St Kilda's Luna Park facade, the Royal Exhibition Building, the Melbourne Cup and the Victorian Arts Centre Spire.\nBen Lee then performed a tribute to Melbourne's multicultural nature, performing \"We're All in This Together\" while people (known on-site as \"Multis\") held photoboards of their ancestors from the many different nationalities of Melburnians and created a \"wall\" with them. (Note: not all the people were holding their own ancestors. Most were assigned random photos. Those who had submitted photos got to hold their own.) Nearing the end of Ben Lee's song, the \"Multis\" took out large red and yellow paper flowers, alluding to Lee's upcoming video for the song. During the song, girls dressed in pink costumes, reminiscent of a 1980-1990's videos Kylie Minogue music video danced with large sweetheart lollies. These girls were known on-site as the \"sweetheart girls\".\nThe Bodyrockers performed their hit \"I Like the Way (You Move)\" while the \"multis\" and \"sweetheart girls\" performed separate dances. Towards the end of the song, the multis moved from the front of the stage to the middle, flipping their boards over and revealing a giant moving version of Federation Square, also using the boards to create an audience wave (Mexican wave). They finished up, holding poses, as fireworks were set off around the MCG. Fireworks were alluded to during the ceremony, with small explosions taking place throughout the event.\nThe volunteers were then welcomed and thanked, with 14,000 being invited to the closing ceremony, while a poem was read out listing a few more of Melbourne's icons, such as the Esplanade Hotel, Graham Kennedy and Shane Warne. The volunteers were honoured as being an integral part of the games success.\nConfetti snow rained down on the stage, representing the fickle nature of Melbourne's weather, as Sarah Blasko performed a Neil Finn and Crowded House hit, \"Don't Dream It's Over\". Paul Kelly and the Stormwater Boys played \"Rally around the Drum\", before flag bearers for each country raised flags, in the same order of continental region that they had done in the opening ceremony, starting with England and finishing with Australia. An illuminated globe suspended in the centre was lowered with Australia, upside down, highlighted in red, and on top of the world. Melbourne City Council's Mayor, Lord Mayor John So was included in the proceedings, to rapturous applause of the crowd, who continued to cheer as his name was read out throughout the ceremony.\nThe Commonwealth Games Ceremonial Flag was lowered by workers representing the Emergency Services of Victoria to the backing of a Wurundjeri Indigenous traditional song performed by the Gondwana Voices, a national youth choir.\nWelcoming Delhi 2010.\nThe ceremony took a distinct change, in acknowledgment of the 2010 Commonwealth Games which will be held in Delhi. A short promotional video was displayed extolling the virtues of India. The stage was filled with the sights and sounds of the Bollywood film culture, with colour and dance predominant features. Several colourful performances were displayed, such as the lively bhangra by Rani Mukherjee and Saif Ali Khan as well as a dance by Aishwarya Rai, who is a Bollywood and Hollywood actress, a supermodel and Miss World 1994.\nThe 2010 Delhi Games mascot, Shera the Friendly Tiger paraded around the stage waving at the crowd, accompanied by the Miss Universe 2000, Lara Dutta and the Miss World 2000, Priyanka Chopra. Then the theme song was performed on stage. The song was sung by popular Indian singers Sonu Nigam, Shreya Ghoshal, Sunidhi Chauhan and Shiamak Davar. The latter is also a famous dance choreographer in India. The song, called \"Delhi Chalein\" invites everyone to the next Commonwealth Games in Delhi.\nDavid Dixon Award.\nThe David Dixon Award, for Best and Fairest, was awarded to Indian Commonwealth Games Team shooter, Samaresh Jung. As the Indian shooter had already returned to India, the award trophy was handed over to an Indian Olympic Association official as the representative.\nClosing of the games.\nPrince Edward, Earl of Wessex then officially closed the Games.\nConcluding performances.\nThe Boy and White Duck from the opening ceremony returned and the boy, who was holding the duck, went down a trapdoor at the centre of the stage and disappeared from sight, symbolizing the closing of the 2006 Games.\nCasey Donovan, the winner of the 2004 \"Australian Idol\", performed \"Better To Love\".\nMichael Klim then came on stage to respond on behalf of the athletes. He was interrupted, mid-sentence, by Barry Humphries (as Dame Edna Everage). Michael Klim's interrupted speech was never finished.\nDame Edna Everage read a message, and a poem and then sang a song in tribute to Melbourne, via video, while 1,000 so-called \"Commonwealth Dames\", wearing various costumes, some from the beginning of the show, performed on the circular stage, waving gladioli and dancing. During this, many fireworks were set off, finally ending in a large human formation in the shape of Dame Edna's trademark glasses.\nThe athletes danced and partied around the centre stage, many of them taking advantage of the informal procedures to take photos, and celebrate in the festivities. Then a select number of outer circle volunteers speared inwards to form a heart-shaped enclosure, while Melbourne's larger skyscrapers set fireworks alight - mirroring the opening ceremony. The floating fish of the Yarra River were illuminated one final time. The official goodbye was announced, and the ceremony ended.\nThe President of the Commonwealth Games Committee, Mike Fennell, declared to the crowd, \"Melbourne, you are simply the best!\"\nThe stage then cleared, with the volunteers surrounding the centre platform, with John Farnham singing his hit \"Age of Reason\", followed by a set of Farnham songs, finishing with his anthem song, \"You're the Voice\".\nA month after the ceremony, all the Melbourne performers received certificates of participation.\nMusic.\nFollowing were the songs that were played or performed at the closing ceremony."

        "title": "Spotting (climbing)",
        "text": "Spotting is a technique used in climbing, especially in bouldering, where the climbers are close to the ground and ropes are not normally used. The spotter stands below the climber, with arms raised or at the ready. If the climber falls, the spotter does not catch the climber, but redirects the climber's fall to land safely on a bouldering mat. At the very least the spotter ensures that the climber's head and back do not strike the ground directly. If the climber jumps down, the spotter can also help prevent stumbles and injuries on uneven ground. The spotter should stand with fingers together (known as \"using spoons\") to avoid broken fingers.\nA spotter should always be used for accident prevention. A climbing spotter will typically stand with arms held up with hands in a supporting position for more or less vertical climbs. If the climber falls, the spotter's hands lightly hold the climber's hips or lower back, near the climber's center of gravity. This allows the spotter to help guide the climber's fall effectively, helping keep the center of gravity over the feet. When on steeper, past vertical climbs, the spotter will hold the climber's arms out in a cradling position. If the climber falls, the spotter supports the upper and middle back, helping the climber land on his or her feet.\nA spotter may also be used to help accomplish new climbing moves. Often much of the energy in learning a new move is exerted in simply holding onto the rock. If a spotter puts even the slightest pressure on the climber's upper back or upward pressure on the hips during a move, this will often give the climber the extra relief needed to learn the move. Once the move is learned, it can usually be practised and mastered without the extra help.\nThe term \"spotting\" originated in 1930, when a new gymnastics coach at the University of Illinois, Hartley Price, painted diameter white circles on the gymnasium walls, calling them \"spots\". Seeing the \"spots\", gymnasts were supposed to think 'safety' and look for those who could assist them through one element or another."

        "text": "Richard Marlon Wood (born May 31, 1953) is an American former professional football played who was a linebacker for the New York Jets and Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the USC Trojans, earning All-American honors. Wood was the team captain and leading tackler of the Buccaneers' early teams, coached by John McKay. \nWood became a coach in the NFL, International leagues, college and in high school.\nHigh school career.\nWood played high school football for Thomas Jefferson High School in Elizabeth, New Jersey.\nCollege career.\nWood attended the University of Southern California as a student and football player. There he was a three-time All-American for the University of Southern California Trojans during the 1972-74 seasons. The Trojans football team won two National Championships during Wood's years there. He was a modest-sized player for an NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly NCAA Division I-A) linebacker, but made up for his lack of size with lightning speed, stamina, and hard-hitting tackles.\nHis trademark Batman \"band of black\" painted across his nose and around both eyes, as those eyes peered out from his helmet, was celebrated by his teammates, the sports press, and Trojan football fans, and they were a gesture to intimidate opponent's linemen and running backs.\nWood came to the varsity as a sophomore in 1972, and he not only led the undefeated Trojans in tackles, but also surpassed the total of his closest teammate by 30 tackles. He was given the responsibility of calling his team's defensive signals.\nWood had five interceptions, returning one for a touchdown and he deflected four other passes. For his efforts, he gained first-team All-American honors. In his junior year he once again led U.S.C. to a conference title and another trip to the Rose Bowl Game. He was a consensus All-American in 1973. In 1974, Wood was part of his second victorious Rose Bowl team and national championship team. He repeated as a consensus All-American honoree.

He also had trouble fitting into a Jets locker room atmosphere that he considered to be cold and unfriendly. A preseason trade to the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers reunited him with his former U.S.C. coach, John McKay, and placed him in a more favorable situation. With the Buccaneers, he became a key player on one of the league's best defensive units. After moving into the starting lineup during the 1976 season, he started 88 consecutive games before being replaced by Scot Brantley in 1982. He averaged 136 tackles per season as a starter, and his single-game high of 18 tackles remains tied as the team record. As of 2012, he ranks sixth all-time among Buccaneer defenders with 855 career tackles. His two defensive touchdowns in 1977, one of which occurred during the franchise's first victory, established a franchise record that stood until 1990. With Ronde Barber and Derrick Brooks, he is one of three Buccaneers to have scored on both a fumble and an interception return in the same season.

        "text": "The QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup, previously known as the International Masters and AMF Bowling World Cup, is an annual Ten-pin bowling championship sponsored by QubicaAMF Worldwide, and the largest in bowling in terms of number of participating nations. Each nation chooses one male and/or one female bowler to represent them in the tournament, and in the majority of cases, this is done by running a qualifying tournament, the winners of which (male and/or female) are chosen.\nHistory.\nThe Bowling World Cup was created by AMF's European Promotions Director at the time, Victor Kalman, and Gordon Caie, AMF's Promotions Manager in the UK at the time. Dublin, Ireland in 1965 hosted the first-ever Bowling World Cup, then called the International Masters. 20 bowlers, all men, participated. Lauri Ajanto became the first-ever winner of the BWC. Women first competed in 1972, the 8th edition of the AMF Bowling World Cup in Hamburg, West Germany where Irma Urrea became the first-ever woman to win the BWC.\n13 countries have participated in every Bowling World Cup since its inception: Australia, Belgium, England (as Great Britain from 1965 to 1995), Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and United States.\nAs of 2019, the Bowling World Cup has visited 42 different cities in 31 different countries.\nCurrently the men's champion is Francois Louw and the women's champion is Rebecca Whiting. On March 9, 2020, World Bowling and QubicaAMF announced a merger of the World Bowling Singles Championships and the QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup into one annual event, that will continue to be called the QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup from 2020 onwards. The 56th QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup was to be held in Salmiya, Kuwait at the Kuwait Bowling Sporting Club in November 2020, but was postponed to March 2021 and then further postponed to October 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and then canceled all together.\nFormat.\nQualifying Rounds\nKnockout Finals\nLane Pattern.\nFor the 2019 BWC, all games are bowled on one pattern, typically a 41 foot pattern unless lane topography at the host site dictates that the pattern be adjusted one foot less or one foot more.\nPrevious winners.\nSource:\nRecords.\nAppearances and Participation.\n1976, 1979–1980, 1982, 1985–1989, 1991–1996, 2009\n1982-1983, 1985, 1988, 1992, 1994-1996, 1998-2000, 2002–2006, 2008\n1979–1980, 1985, 1989, 1995, 2005, 2014\n1976, 1980, 1986, 1989, 1991–1993, 1995–1996\n1996–1998, 2000–2001, 2003–2004"

        "title": "USBC Masters",
        "text": "The USBC Masters is a championship ten-pin bowling event conducted by the United States Bowling Congress. The Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) began recognizing it as a title event in 1998, and it was designated one of the four majors in 2000. A PBA rule change in 2008 retroactively awarded a PBA title (and a major) to any Masters winners prior to 1998 who were PBA members at the time of the victory.\nHistory.\nThe tournament began in 1951 as the ABC Masters, conducted by the American Bowling Congress (ABC). The ABC merged with the WIBC and YABA to become the USBC in 2005, after which the tournament was renamed USBC Masters. The Masters began as an invitational event showcasing national and local bowling stars and has grown to become one of bowling's most prestigious events.\nWhile the event has evolved over the years, its trademark qualifying and double-elimination match play format has remained largely unchanged. All bowlers compete in 15 games of qualifying, with the top 63 qualifiers joining the previous year's champion in the double elimination match play bracket. (If the previous champion makes the top 63 or is unable to participate, the 64th-place qualifier is added.) All head-to-head matches consist of three games, highest total pinfall wins. First-time losers during the match play rounds are not eliminated, but are instead placed into an elimination bracket, where they must survive all subsequent three-game matches to have a chance at making the championship finals.\nHundreds of competitors turn out for the Masters each year (a full field of 360 entered the 2018 event) with their sights set on a prize fund that has recently been as high as $350,000, including a $50,000 top prize. The field, which now includes women, also features representatives from all 50 states and a handful of foreign countries.\nThe Masters is open to PBA members and any USBC member that meets average requirements. It is a part of the World Bowling Tour.\nAfter the Masters in January 2004, the tournament was moved to the fall, resulting in two Masters events during calendar year 2004. (The first was part of the 2003–04 PBA season, and the second was part of the 2004–05 season.) Then in 2008, the tournament was moved back to the spring, which is why there was no Masters during 2008.\nIn 2007, Carolyn Dorin-Ballard became the first woman to bowl a perfect game in the USBC Masters.\nDick Hoover, Billy Welu, Jason Belmonte, and Anthony Simonsen are the only 4 players to successfully defend a Masters title, however, Belmonte is the only player to win three times in a row.\nMike Aulby is the first player to have won the USBC Masters three times, but was eventually passed by Jason Belmonte. Belmonte is the only player to win three Masters in a row (2013, 2014 and 2015), and he won again in 2017 to become the only player to win four Masters titles. Prior to Belmonte's threepeat, the last player to successfully defend a Masters title was Billy Welu in 1964–65. The 1984 ABC Masters featured the 43rd and final PBA Tour title for Hall of Famer Earl Anthony. Ernie Schlegel is the oldest player to win the USBC Masters, capturing the 1996 event at age 53. In 2016, Anthony Simonsen, aged 19 years and 39 days, became the tournament's youngest winner, as well as the youngest to win a PBA major of any kind.\nCurrent Defending Champion.\n2024 Event.\nThe 2024 USBC Masters was held at Suncoast Bowling Center in Las Vegas, Nevada from March 24–29, with the televised stepladder final round on March 31. The tournament had a starting field of 465 bowlers, and a $457,500 prize fund with a $100,000 top prize.\nTop seed DeeRonn Booker, who went undefeated in match play, won his lone finals match against #2 seed Patrick Dombrowski, 217–177, for his first PBA Tour title and first major.\nPrize Pool:\nPast champions.\nNote: In May 2008, the PBA announced it was revising its all-time records to include PBA-era ABC Masters championships prior to 1998 as PBA titles (and majors), if the champion was a PBA member at the time."

        "title": "British Tenpin Bowling Association",
        "text": "The British Tenpin Bowling Association (BTBA) is the official governing body of ten-pin bowling in the United Kingdom, affiliated to Sport England.\nIt is the official sanctioning body, recognised by International Bowling Federation, the sport's world governing body, for all competitions, leagues and tournaments held in the UK, and is the organisation responsible for the protection, integrity and development of the sport. It also oversees coaching for tenpin bowling at all levels, and is the official awarding body for formal coaching qualifications. The BTBA had a monthly magazine to keep members up to date with the latest news in the sport but nowadays news can mainly be found on Facebook.\nHistory.\nThe first British tenpin bowling centre opened at Stamford Hill. The two principal American manufacturers of tenpin machinery - AMF and Brunswick - had expanded their operations to the UK when it became apparent that they had virtually saturated their home market in the US at the end of the 1950s. The American Bowling Congress (ABC) took an interest in this expansion and helped British bowlers to set up their own governing body.\nThe BTBA was formed on 26 May 1961. The General Secretary was Maurice Glazer, at that time a professional photographer in Dalston, East London. His shop became the first official residence of the Association. One of its original roles was to provide official recognition for newcomers to the fledgling sport of tenpin bowling as it grew in popularity across the UK.\nIt standardised rules and playing regulations, laid down guidelines and provided an independent governing body to which reference could be made in the event of disagreement.\nThe rule-book was copied almost verbatim from the ABC version. The annual membership subscription was five shillings), which at the prevailing exchange rate was the Sterling equivalent of the ABC's annual subscription of US$1. With about half-a-million members the ABC found this rate to provide them with adequate funds, but it was insufficient to run the BTBA, given that only a few thousand British bowlers were members.\nAuthority was delegated to each of the counties under the auspices of local area representatives. Some of the area representatives soon came into conflict with the bowling centre proprietors, for example insisting on costly re-surfacing of lanes, which they argued was unnecessary. The proprietors rebelled and set up their own rival organisation, the Tenpin Bowling Proprietors Association (TBPA), in 1967. An Annual General Meeting of the BTBA saw this conflict rise to a head and most of the governing council resigned, leaving Glazer to regroup and bring back all decisions to the BTBA head office. It took several years to achieve a rapprochement with the proprietors.\nGlazer continued to follow his instincts in what he believed to be the best interest of British bowlers, became President of FIQ and was awarded an MBE for his service to the sport.\nThe BTBA has continued to have a considerable impact on the sport, however in recent times has struggled to engage with the next generation of bowlers. As bowling transitions from \"sport\" to \"leisure\", and bowling centres remove restrictions like the need to wear Bowling Shoes, Bowling as a sport is in huge decline in the UK. A large percentage of bowling leagues did not return to the centres after the COVID pandemic.\nBritish Tenpin Bowling Coaching Association.\nThe 'British Tenpin Bowling Coaching Association (BTBCA) is a sub-section of the British Tenpin Bowling Association Although associated under the umbrella group of the BTBA, the BTBCA is run solely by a committee, elected by the members annually at the Annual General Meeting, subject to their good standing with the BTBA.\nThe BTBCA Chairman reports annually to the BTBA, through the BTBCA President (the BTBA Director of National Coaching currently Arthur J McDonnell MSc).\nBTBA Coaching Qualification.\nWithin the BTBCA there are 4 levels to the BTBA Coaching Qualification. These include:\nBTBCA Aim.\nAccording to the BTBCA website, the main aim of the BTBCA is to provide a contact point for all BTBA qualified Instructors and Coaches.\nThere is a two-day BTBA coaching course. The passing of this course gives a basis of knowledge from which to work, however, the only way in which people can develop their skills in coaching, is through practical experience. In gaining this experience, questions often arise, for which the answers are not immediately clear.\nMembers.\nCurrent members include the British Tenpin Bowling Coaching Association, Hollywood Bowl, and Tenpin (formerly Megabowl) chains."

It was first released in Australia on 22 March 2004, and on 24 May 2005 on Epitaph Records in the United States with a re-arranged track listing and one new song. The US version was released in Australia as a \"repackaged\" album in July 2004. In 2011 the album was voted #98 on Australian radio station Triple J's Hottest 100 Australian Albums of All Time (Industry List).\nThe album marked a transition point for the band, whose lineup had been stable for the first six years. Over the course of the recording sessions, bassist Andy Cassell and guitarist Paul Murphy quit, to be replaced by Patrick Matthews and Cameron Ellison–Elliott respectively, while Johnno Lattin also played bass on some tracks after Cassell's departure. \"All of a sudden everything's gone kind of haywire,\" songwriter and singer-guitarist Toby Martin said.\nMartin said the album added a strong folk flavour to the band's rock roots. He told the \"Herald Sun\": \"I've definitely been listening to more older stuff in the time leading up to recording this record—like Dylan and the Velvet Underground. I really like country and folk music, so I think it's always going to come through. Maybe this time it's come through in a more authentic way, rather than playing with a genre, just playing it because we like it. I think the guitar-picking stuff on this record mostly comes from Bob Dylan or Nick Drake and that sort of stuff, more folk kind of things.\"\nMusic videos were produced for the singles \"Skeleton Jar,\" \"Shadowland\" and \"Baby Body.\"\nTrack listing.\nAll songs by Youth Group."

        "title": "Greg Gagne (baseball)",
        "text": "Gregory Carpenter Gagne (; born November 12, 1961) is an American former shortstop in Major League Baseball. He played 10 seasons for the Minnesota Twins from 1983 to 1992, including both of the Twins' World Series championship teams in 1987 and 1991. He was considered one of the American League's best defensive shortstops during his time with Minnesota.\nPlaying career.\nGreg Gagne was drafted by the New York Yankees in the fifth round of the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft and spent the next three seasons in the Yankees' minor league system before being traded to the Twins on April 10, 1982, along with starting pitcher Paul Boris and reliever Ron Davis for the Twins starting shortstop, Roy Smalley. Gagne spent all of 1982 and all but 12 games of the 1983 and 1984 seasons in the minors before earning the starting shortstop job in 1985, after which Gagne became a fixture of the Twins' infield for the next eight seasons.\nOn October 4, 1986, during a Twins' home game at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, Gagne hit two inside-the-park home runs against the Chicago White Sox. Both home runs were hit off Chicago starting pitcher Floyd Bannister. The Twins also went on to win the game, 73.\nGagne was a fixture of the Twins drive to their second World Series appearance, and first World Series title, following the 1987 season. During the Twins march to their second World Series crown in four years, Gagne hit a game-winning, three-run homer in Game One of the 1991 World Series off Atlanta's Charlie Leibrandt. Gagne hit only .213 during the Twins two post-season drives. Despite this low batting average, Gagne hit five doubles and four home runs, along with knocking in 10 runs and scoring 12 times, to maximize those 18 hits.\nGagne left the Twins when his contract was up in the 1992 season; the team had put a great deal of resources into re-signing superstar Kirby Puckett (inking the star centerfielder to a then huge multi-year contract that would pay him $5.3 million in 1993) and with Gagne's replacement, Pat Meares, already on the Major League roster, did not offer Gagne the salary increase that he was looking for. Gagne then signed with the Kansas City Royals, agreeing to a 3-year, $10.6 million contract. Following three years with the Royals in which he put up similar numbers as he did with the Twins, he again entered free agency and signed a contract to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 1996 and 1997 seasons. Gagne retired from baseball following the end of the 1997 season.\nCareer statistics.\nIn 27 postseason games, including the 1987 and '91 World Series, Gagne batted .220 (22-for-100) with 14 runs, 4 home runs and 10 RBI.\nRetirement.\nDuring his tenure with the Twins, Gagne lived in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. He currently lives in Somerset, Massachusetts, and is the former head baseball coach at Bishop Feehan High School.\nGagne was a guest at the Metrodome farewell ceremony. During that day's game he sat in the broadcast booth with commentators Dick Bremer and Bert Blyleven for a half inning. On February 8, 2010, Gagne was elected to the Twins Hall of Fame and was inducted at Target Field on September 4, 2010."

        "title": "2007 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2007 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2006–07 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs defeated the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers in a 4–0 sweep. This was Cleveland's first trip to the NBA Finals in their franchise history and San Antonio's fourth. Tony Parker was named the series' MVP. The series was televised on ABC under the ESPN on ABC branding, and produced the lowest television ratings in NBA Finals history until 2020.\nThis series was the last sweep in the NBA Finals until 2018, which also involved the Cavaliers on the losing end.\nFormat.\nThe Finals were played using the 2-3-2 format, where the first two and last two games are held at the team with home court advantage. The NBA, after experimenting in the early years, restored this original format for the Finals in 1985. The other playoff series were played in the 2-2-1-1-1 format.\nThe best-of-seven series began on June 7, 2007, with the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs playing the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers. Because the San Antonio Spurs had a better regular season win–loss record, they had home court advantage.\nBackground.\nRegular season series.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers won both games in the regular season series: \nSan Antonio Spurs.\nThe previous season saw the San Antonio Spurs drop a heartbreaking seventh game at home to the rival Dallas Mavericks in the second round. As the new season began, the Spurs saw the Mavericks rolling through their regular season, on their way to a franchise best 67 win campaign. Meanwhile, the Spurs struggled through their season through January. With the main focus lying on Dallas and the Phoenix Suns, the Spurs found themselves flying under the radar. A late-season surge resulted in a 58–24 regular season record, good enough for third seed in the Western Conference.\nIn the playoffs, the Spurs met the Denver Nuggets and their duo of Allen Iverson and Carmelo Anthony. The Nuggets took game 1, but the Spurs reeled off 4 straight wins to take the series in five games. As San Antonio prepared to face off against the second seed Suns, the top-ranked Mavericks suffered a stunning first-round exit at the hands of the Golden State Warriors. With the Mavericks gone, the stakes of the Suns-Spurs series shot up dramatically, and it was a closely competitive and controversial series.\nThe Suns had homecourt advantage, but that did not last past game 1. In a hotly contested battle of Western Conference heavyweights, each team tried to deliver a knockout blow. The Spurs finally landed it, but by accident. With the game in the balance Tony Parker and Steve Nash collided head-to-head. A large gash opened along Nash's nose and the medical staff could not stop the bleeding. He was forced to sit out the final 45 seconds and watch the Spurs win, 111–106. Game 2 saw the Suns rebound and blow out the Spurs, 101–81. After this game, Suns center Amar'e Stoudemire called the Spurs a dirty team. Game 3 switched back to San Antonio and saw a return of physical play, with Manu Ginóbili receiving a bruised and bloodied eye and Bruce Bowen kneeing Nash in the groin. Tim Duncan led the Spurs to a 108–101 victory.\nGames 4 and 5 were the most controversial of the series. The Spurs, after being comfortably in control of game 4, saw their 11-point fourth-quarter lead dwindle away to a 2-point Suns lead. With 18 seconds left, Robert Horry bodychecked Nash into the scorers' table. Nash's teammates jumped to his defense; during the ensuing altercation, Stoudemire and Boris Diaw left the bench. Their action violated NBA rules, and league commissioner David Stern suspended both players for game 5. Horry was also suspended two games for his flagrant foul on Nash. In game 5, in Phoenix, the short-handed Suns jumped out early to a 16-point lead, but in a reversal of game 4, the Spurs came back in the final seconds and won the game 88–85, giving San Antonio a 3–2 series lead.\nThe Spurs won game 6 of the series 114–106 in San Antonio, sending them to their fifth Western Conference finals since 1999.\nSan Antonio went on to beat the Utah Jazz in five games to advance to the franchise's fourth NBA Finals.\nCleveland Cavaliers.\nIn the replay of the previous year's playoffs with the Cavaliers holding home court advantage against Washington Wizards, the Cavaliers swept the Wizards after the season-ending injuries of both Gilbert Arenas and Caron Butler. In the second round of the playoffs, the Cavaliers faced the New Jersey Nets. Again, the Cavaliers had home court advantage, and battled the Nets through 6 games before winning the series. The Cavaliers advanced to the conference finals for only the third time in franchise history, and faced a familiar foe: the Detroit Pistons, the number one seed in the Eastern Conference, with their home court advantage. This was the same Detroit team that knocked the Cavaliers out of the second round the previous year. Expectations were high after a 7-game series the previous year and the two teams did not disappoint.\nThe first two games were close and saw Cleveland fall by identical 79–76 scores. Down 0–2 in the series, the spotlight shifted back to Cleveland and LeBron James. Another hard-fought set ensued, with the Cavaliers taking the two games at home 88-82 and 91-87 respectively. Game 5 switched back to Detroit and produced one of the greatest moments in NBA history.\nWith 6:14 to go in regulation and his team clinging to a one-point 79–78 lead, James took over the game. He scored 11 of the final 12 points to end regulation tied 91-91. In the first overtime, James scored all nine of the Cavaliers' points, ending the period tied 100-100. In the second overtime, James again scored all nine of the team's points to win, 109-107. Thus, in the last 16:14 of play, James scored 29 of the Cavaliers' last 30 points, as well as all of their last 25 points.\nThe Cavaliers beat the Pistons at home in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals to earn the franchise's first trip to the NBA Finals. Cleveland became the third team in NBA history to win a best-of-seven conference finals series after trailing by 2 games.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers entered the 2007 Finals as newcomers. Game 1 was their first NBA Finals game in franchise history, and the first for each of its players (other than reserve point guard Eric Snow). However, the San Antonio Spurs had been to the Finals in three of the past eight seasons, winning a championship each time. With solid performances by Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginóbili, the Spurs won the series opener in convincing fashion, limiting LeBron James to 14 points on 4–16 shooting.\nGame 2.\nThe Spurs took a stranglehold on momentum in Game 2. The Spurs' big three overwhelmed the Cavs and the Spurs led by as many as 29 points in the third quarter. They dominated the game during the first 3 quarters and played show-time basketball. A furious 25–6 rally by Cleveland in the final quarter wasn't enough as the Spurs took a 2–0 lead in the series.\nGame 3.\nRookie Daniel Gibson started Game 3 in place of the injured Larry Hughes but scored a series-low 2 points on 1-10 shooting. As a team the Cavs shot only .367, but out-rebounded the Spurs 48–41. Zydrunas Ilgauskas had a 2006–07 season high 18 rebounds. On the game's final play, LeBron James missed a potential game-tying 29 foot 3-pointer.\nGame 3 was the lowest scoring Finals game since 1955, with Tim Duncan of the Spurs having his lowest scoring game in his NBA Finals career, with 14 points.\nGame 4.\nSan Antonio started out strong through the first three quarters, leading by as many as 11. Cleveland would stage a rally near the end of the third quarter and the first five minutes of the fourth, scoring 14 consecutive points to take its first second-half lead of the series. However, the Spurs would stage a 12–3 rally of their own to retake the lead and win the series in a 4–0 sweep.\nTwelve-year veteran Michael Finley was awarded the NBA championship game ball.\nBroadcasting.\nCoverage was produced by ESPN and televised on ABC in the United States, TSN in Canada, Sky Sports in the United Kingdom, Canal+ in France, Premiere in Germany, and more than 100 other broadcasters in over 200 countries.\nPlay-by-play announcer Mike Breen, analysts Mark Jackson &amp; former Rockets head-coach Jeff Van Gundy, and courtside reporters Michele Tafoya &amp; Stuart Scott provided commentary and analysis for the North American market. The radio coverage on ESPN Radio features play-by-play man Mike Tirico and color analysts Dr. Jack Ramsay and Hubie Brown.\nThis was the first of a record 15 NBA Finals assignments for the team of Breen, Jackson and Van Gundy. With the exception of the and Finals (Jackson was head coach of the Golden State Warriors during this period), the trio would call every NBA Finals until , including every one of LeBron James' NBA Finals appearances with the Cleveland Cavaliers. (In the 2022 NBA Finals, Mark Jones alongside Mark Jackson called Game 1 of the series with Breen and Van Gundy out due to COVID-19 protocols; Van Gundy returned in Game 2 followed by Breen in Game 3.)\nThe featured song, aired throughout the playoffs, was The Pussycat Dolls \"Right Now.\"\nAnother song featured in the 2007 NBA Finals series, \"It Ends Tonight\" by The All-American Rejects, was aired at the end of the pre-game promo for Game 4.\nRatings.\nAccording to ESPN, the NBA Finals series was a television bust in the United States. San Antonio's four-game sweep of Cleveland finished with a record-low 6.2 television rating and 11 share on ABC, Nielsen Media Research said on June 15, 2007.\nThat was down 27 percent from the 8.5/15 for Miami's six-game victory over Dallas from the previous year and 5 percent under the previous low, a 6.5/12 for San Antonio's six-game win over New Jersey in .\nSan Antonio's series-winning 83-82 victory on Thursday night got a 6.5/12, down 17 percent from the 7.8/14 for Game 4 in 2006.\nDespite having the lowest ratings of any NBA championship series, game two of the 2003 series between San Antonio and New Jersey remains the lowest-rated game of all time in the history of the NBA Finals.\nAftermath.\nThe Spurs won 56 games in the succeeding 2007–08 season, but relinquished the Southwest Division title to the New Orleans Hornets due to a tie-breaker. The Spurs had the last laugh, though, defeating the Hornets in seven games. But their chance of defending their title was denied by the Los Angeles Lakers in five games of the conference finals. After that, age and injury took its toll on the Spurs, as they proceeded to win only a single playoff series in three years (2010, vs. Dallas 4–2 of the first round), before getting upset by the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the 2011 NBA Playoffs despite finishing with 61 wins.\nThe Spurs then retooled their roster, after which they appeared in three consecutive conference finals, beginning in 2012, before making the NBA Finals in and against James and the Miami Heat. The Spurs split the two Finals meetings against the Heat.\nThe Cavaliers won 45 games in the 2007–08 season, despite early-season contract issues involving center Anderson Varejão and guard Sasha Pavlović, and a mid-season trade for Ben Wallace. They fell in the second round to the eventual NBA champions Boston Celtics in seven games, after a hard-fought duel involving LeBron James and Paul Pierce. The Cavaliers would earn the league's best record for the next two years (66 and 61 wins, respectively) and boast the NBA's MVP in James. However, they were unable to win it all, losing to the Orlando Magic in six games of the 2009 Eastern Conference Finals and the Celtics in six games of the 2010 Eastern Conference Semifinals (allowing the Lakers to win the Finals twice against the Magic and Celtics). The latter playoff defeat would cost head coach Mike Brown his job, though he was later re-hired (and fired again) in the 2013–14 NBA season. After that season, as a free agent, James left for the Miami Heat and helped them to four successive NBA Finals appearances, winning in and 2013, while the Cavaliers sunk to an Eastern Conference-low 19 wins in the 2010–11 NBA season, which included a 26-game losing streak.\nThe Cavaliers then appeared in the NBA draft lottery four consecutive times, earning the top pick in three of them. Those three top picks became Kyrie Irving (2011), Anthony Bennett (2013) and Andrew Wiggins (2014) (Bennett and Wiggins were later traded to Minnesota for Kevin Love). In July 2014, James announced his return to the Cavaliers after the hiring of coach David Blatt, and they reached the against the Atlanta Hawks with a 4–0 sweep before falling to the Golden State Warriors in the Finals 4–2. The following season, the Cavaliers returned to the Finals in a rematch against the Golden State Warriors and won the Finals over the Warriors 4–3 with LeBron James winning the Finals MVP."

        "text": "The 2008 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2007–08 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. A best-of-seven playoff series that was played from June 5 to 17, 2008, the series was contested between the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics and the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers. It was the 11th Finals meeting between the Lakers and the Celtics.\nLed by the \"Big 3\" of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen, and holding home court advantage, the Celtics defeated the Lakers, led by Pau Gasol and MVP Kobe Bryant, in six games. It was their first title in twenty-two years and their 17th title overall, a record that still stands today even when the Lakers tied this record in 2020. Pierce was named Finals MVP.\nRodd Houston narrated the Boston Celtics' championship season documentary on NBA Entertainment. The made-for-TV version of this documentary is narrated by Kevin Harlan.\nBackground.\nThe Celtics were making their first NBA Finals appearance since a six-game loss to the Lakers in 1987. Over the next 20 years the Celtics would suffer through several lean years, not making the playoffs in nine of those years. Following the dissolution of the team's original \"Big Three\" through the retirements of Larry Bird and Kevin McHale and the departure of Robert Parish, the Celtics suffered through several tragedies such as: the passing of Reggie Lewis in 1993; a franchise-worst 15-win 1996–97 season; the ill-fated hiring of head coach Rick Pitino; and the deaths of franchise patriarch Red Auerbach and former player Dennis Johnson, which culminated in a 24-win 2006–07 season, highlighted by a franchise-worst 18 straight losses.\nThe 2007 off-season saw Celtics GM Danny Ainge acquire Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett to join franchise star Paul Pierce. This new formation was widely regarded as the most talent the Boston Celtics team possessed since the duo of Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce graced the floor of the TD Garden in the early 2000s. The newly formed 'Big Three,' joined by second year point guard and future all star Rajon Rondo, led the Celtics to a dramatic 42-game turnaround, finishing with 66 wins. In the playoffs, the Celtics were pushed to the brink by the Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers, and despite not winning on the road, they managed to prevail in a pair of Game 7s on their home court. The Celtics would finally break their road woes in a six-game win against the perennial Eastern Conference powerhouse Detroit Pistons, earning their first finals berth since 1987.\nAfter losing to the Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals despite a talent-laden roster, Phil Jackson abruptly retired. Soon after the Lakers decided to rebuild by trading away Shaquille O'Neal to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler and Brian Grant. The 2004–05 season saw the Lakers miss the playoffs for only the fifth time in team history. Even though he had written a book called \"\", going as far as calling Kobe Bryant \"uncoachable\", Jackson returned to the Lakers for the 2005–06 season. Jackson and Bryant would patch their differences, but after a pair of first-round exits, Bryant demanded, but later retracted, a trade in the off-season.\nThe Lakers' 2007–08 season saw the team win 57 games, along the way adding Spanish forward Pau Gasol in mid-season while Andrew Bynum was recovering from a mid-season knee injury. The Lakers eliminated the Denver Nuggets 4–0, then the Utah Jazz 4–2 and then dethroned the erstwhile defending champion San Antonio Spurs 4–1 in the conference finals, making their 29th NBA Finals appearance.\nRegular season series.\nThe Boston Celtics won both games in the regular season series:\nSeries summary.\nNote: team in Bold won the game\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nPaul Pierce scored 15 points in the third quarter to give Boston the lead for good, and Kevin Garnett paced the Celtic attack with 24 points and 13 rebounds including a powerful two-handed putback dunk late in the game. Kobe Bryant had 24 points.\nPierce apparently injured his knee by falling awkwardly on Kendrick Perkins' leg, and was taken off the court in a wheelchair. Despite what Pierce's reaction suggested was a highly debilitating injury, he returned to action minutes later to raucous cheering from the crowd. Pierce admitted during coverage of the 2019 NBA Finals that he just had to use the bathroom. He soon hit two three-pointers on consecutive offensive possessions that gave Boston the lead for good and finished with 22 points. It was later dubbed by some as the \"Wheelchair Game\".\nThe Lakers, who had had home court advantage throughout the first three rounds and had not trailed a series in that same time, now had to do without both luxuries for the first time.\nGame 2.\nThe Lakers jumped out to an early 15–8 first quarter lead, but the Celtics answered with a 10–0 run at the start of the second quarter and ended the first half with a 54–42 lead.\nThe Celtics held a 24-point lead with less than eight minutes to go in the 4th quarter before the Lakers cut the lead to two points with 38.4 seconds to go with a 31–9 run. Paul Pierce and James Posey then closed out the game with two free throws each. The Lakers had a chance to cut into Boston's four-point lead with 14 seconds left, but the possession resulted in a shot by Saša Vujačić that was blocked by Pierce. Kobe Bryant finished the game with 30 points and 8 assists.\nLeon Powe, a second year bench player, scored 21 points on 6–7 shooting from the field and 9–13 from the line in 15 minutes of play, including back-to-back dunks in the last minute of the 3rd quarter. Over the course of the game, Leon Powe shot 13 free throws while the Lakers shot 10.\nDespite injuries suffered by Pierce (sprained knee) and Kendrick Perkins (high ankle sprain), both players started in Game 2 and appeared to be mostly unhampered by the injuries, especially Pierce who finished with 28 points.\nBoston finished the game 27-for-38 from the line, while the Lakers were 10-for-10. Some analysts viewed this as favorable treatment toward the Celtics, while others noted that a difference in playing styles may have led to the discrepancy, and that the actual foul discrepancy was only 28–21 in favor of Boston.\nGame 3.\nThe Lakers won game 3 on a strong shooting night from regular season MVP Kobe Bryant, who scored a series-high 36 points, leading the Lakers to their first win of the series and adding to their undefeated streak at home in the 2008 postseason. Saša Vujačić scored 20 points in 28 minutes, Paul Pierce had a poor shooting game, making only two of his 14 field goal attempts. Kevin Garnett also had trouble shooting, finishing with only 12 points. Ray Allen was the only member of Boston's Big Three that scored over 13 points, with 25.\nGame 4.\nThe Lakers jumped out to a 35–14 lead after the first quarter, which was the largest first-quarter lead in NBA Finals history. The Lakers held their ground for most of the third quarter, leading by as many as 24 points. However, the Celtics went on a 21–3 run to end the third quarter, closing the deficit to only two points (73–71). With 4:07 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Celtics took their first lead in the game when Celtics' reserve Eddie House made an jumper. With House's shot, the Celtics were in the lead for good. The Celtics' victory in Game 4 was the largest comeback in the NBA Finals since .\nThe Celtics bench outscored the Lakers bench 35–15, 29 of those points coming from House and James Posey. Kevin Garnett finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds in support of Allen (19) and Pierce (20).\nGame 5.\nAs in Game 4, the Lakers jumped out to an early lead, leading 43–24 with 11 minutes to play in the second quarter. And as in Game 4, the Celtics came back, taking a 62–60 lead behind the strong play of Paul Pierce.\nThe Lakers finally regained their composure, outscoring Boston 24–18 in the 3rd quarter. In previous games, the Lakers were outscored by Boston in the 3rd quarter (22–31 in Game 1, 19–29 in Game 2, 17–25 in Game 3, and 15–31 in Game 4) by a total of 43 points (73–116).\nThe Lakers built a 14-point lead in the 4th quarter, but the Celtics again came back with a 16–2 run to tie the game at 90. With less than one minute left in the game, the Celtics had the ball with the Lakers leading 97–95. Pierce beat Bryant off the drive, but Bryant knocked the ball out of Pierce's hands from behind. Lamar Odom picked up the loose ball and passed downcourt to Bryant for a breakaway dunk, giving the Lakers a 99–95 lead. The Lakers went on to win 103–98, sending the series back to Boston.\nKobe Bryant had 25 points, to go with five steals. Pau Gasol contributed 19 points, 13 rebounds and 6 assists, Odom 20 points and 11 rebounds. For Boston, Pierce had a memorable 38 point effort, but outside of Allen (16 points) and Garnett (13 points and 14 rebounds) did not receive enough support from his teammates to clinch the championship at Staples.\nAs for the odds stacked against the Lakers to come back from a 3–1 deficit, Jackson said, \"We're young enough and dumb enough to do this.\"\nGame 6.\nEntering Game 6, the Celtics set a record of most playoff games played in one season, with 26, breaking the previous record of 25 set by both the 1994 New York Knicks, whom Celtics Coach Doc Rivers played for, and the 2005 Detroit Pistons, both of whom lost in their respective finals in seven games (Knicks in , Pistons in ). However, for the 1994 Knicks, the first round was a best-of-five. Since the NBA Finals used the 2-3-2 format from 1985 until 2013, no team has ever won the last two games on the road.\nAfter a rocky first quarter, the Celtics dominated the rest of the game. Maintaining a lead of more than 25 points, the Celtics' Big Three performed phenomenally, while the whole team smothered the Lakers' offense with their tight defense. Boston dominated in numerous statistical categories, including rebounds (48–29, with a 14–2 disparity in offensive boards), turnovers (7–19), steals (18–4), assists (33–16) and blocks (4–0). Five Celtics finished in double figures. Ray Allen hit seven three-pointers to tie what was then the Finals record (which he subsequently broke during the 2010 NBA Finals against the Lakers during game two), Rajon Rondo had an all-around spectacular performance (21 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists, 6 steals), the Celtics only turned the ball over seven times and set a Finals record with 18 steals, and every Boston player who saw action scored.\nThe 39-point margin of victory was the largest ever in an NBA championship-clinching game, breaking the old record of 33, also set by the Celtics over the Lakers in Game Five of the 1965 NBA Finals, 129–96. This lead was close to the Finals point-spread record set in Game 3 in where a Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls team beat the Utah Jazz by 42 points, 96–54. The Celtics also improved their overall record against the Lakers to 9–2 in Finals meetings, beating them in the Finals for the first time since 1984.\nThis was the Celtics' 17th championship, their first since , extending their record for most NBA championships won by a single team. All this capped off the Celtics' best regular season (66–16) since their previous championship season in which they went 67–15. It was also a sense of relief, as the Celtics set an NBA record for most playoff games ever needed to win a championship, with 26, surpassing the previous record of 24 by the Lakers in .\nThe Celtics' win was also seen as an addition to the recent success of Boston-area sports teams, following the wins by the New England Patriots in Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, and XXXIX (2001, 2003 and 2004 seasons) and the Red Sox's World Series wins in (death of the Curse of the Bambino) and .\nThe Celtics won this series by winning Games 1, 2, 4, and 6; coincidentally, the last time the two teams met in , the Lakers won that series in identical fashion. It was also the same identical fashion when the Celtics won the NBA Finals in before this championship.\nBroadcasting.\nThe Finals, produced by ESPN, were aired on ABC in the United States for the sixth consecutive year. This was also Michele Tafoya's last Finals appearance as a sideline reporter due to her resignation shortly before the 2008–09 season. She was later succeeded by Doris Burke (2009–19), Rachel Nichols (2020), Malika Andrews (2021), and Lisa Salters (2022–present).\nAftermath.\nIn the 2008–09 season, the Celtics raced to a 27–2 start, the best through 29 games in NBA history, until that fateful finals rematch against the Lakers on Christmas Day ended a franchise-high 19-game winning streak. Then days after the All-Star Game, Kevin Garnett injured his right knee, and was lost for the season. The Celtics won 62 games, but the absence of Garnett affected the team as they were eliminated in seven games by the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.\nThe Lakers rebounded to win 65 games in the aforementioned season, then proceeded to win the NBA title in five games over the Dwight Howard-led Magic. Even though another mid-season injury to Andrew Bynum threatened their title drive, he did come back late in the season. The Lakers became the first team since the 1988–89 Pistons to win the NBA Finals after losing it in the previous year.\nBoth teams would eventually meet again in 2010 where the Lakers defeated the Celtics in seven games. More recently, the Lakers, led by LeBron James and Anthony Davis, won the NBA championship in 2020, while the Celtics, led by Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, reached the NBA Finals in 2022, losing to the Stephen Curry-led Golden State Warriors in six games."

        "title": "International Wheelchair Basketball Federation",
        "text": "The International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF) is the international governing body for the sport of Wheelchair Basketball. IWBF is recognized by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) as the sole competent authority in wheelchair basketball worldwide. International Basketball Federation (or FIBA) has recognized IWBF under Article 53 of its General Statutes.\nHistory.\nThe Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games, held in 1947, were the first games to be held and included only a handful of participants (26), and few events (shot put, javelin, club throw, and archery). The number of wheelchair events and participants grew quickly. Wheelchair netball was introduced in the 1948 Games. In 1952, a team from the Netherlands was invited to compete with the British team. This became the first International Stoke-Mandeville Games (ISMG), an event that has been held annually ever since. Wheelchair basketball, as we know it now, was first played at the 1956 International Stoke-Mandeville Games. The US \"Pan Am Jets\" team won the tournament.\nIn 1973, the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF) established the first Sub-section for wheelchair basketball. At that time ISMGF was the world governing body for all wheelchair sports. In 1989, ISMGF accepted the name International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF) for its former sub-section. With this step wheelchair basketball began its journey for full independence and in 1993 IWBF was established as the world body for wheelchair basketball with full responsibility for development of the sport. Over the next five years IWBF membership grew in size and the federation configured itself into 4 geographical zones.\nMembers.\nZones.\nIWBF studied several models before creating its current zone structure. Based on the number of National Organizations for Wheelchair Basketball (NOWB) with active programs at the national and international level it was decided that IWBF Americas and IWBF Europe could be the same as FIBA Americas and FIBA Europe. However, because of the limited number of countries with active programs in the rest of the world, IWBF chose to combine some regions to create better developmental and competitive opportunities within the zone. As a result, the last two zones of IWBF (2005) are IWBF Asia Oceania and IWBF Africa.\nBefore 2007 or 2005 Africa and west asian in one zone and east asia with oceania in one zone. \nMembers in May 2022:\nNational Members.\nAs of 2003, IWBF has 76 NOWB actively participating in wheelchair basketball throughout the world with this number increasing each year. As of 2021, IWBF has 95 NOWB actively participating in wheelchair basketball throughout the world with this number increasing each year. 98 in May 2022.\nExecutive Council.\nIWBF is governed by an Executive Council that is elected at the World Congress every four years. Philip Craven (Great Britain) who had served as Chairperson of the ISMGF wheelchair basketball Section since 1988 was elected in 1993 as the first President of IWBF.\nIn 2001, Brendan Hancock was elected to the position of President of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and retired as president of IWBF at the World Congress in 2002. Maureen Orchard (Canada) was elected as only the second president of IWBF at that same World Congress in Kitakyushu, Japan in 2002.\nClassification.\nIn order to make the competitions fair, each player receives a point in regard their physical ability called class, from 1.0 which is the lowest class with the maximum physical disability to the 4.5 which is highest class with the lowest physical disability.\nThe person who performs classification called classifier. Classifiers have Bronze, Silver and Gold badges according to their knowledge and experience. Recently the classification rules made changes and have only two levels, namely the national classifier, the zone classifier and the International Classifier. \nDon Perriman (Australia) is the current President of Classification Commission\nKenneth McKay (Great Britain) \nGold Classifier \nGholamhossein Shahrabadi (Iran) \nGold Classier\nToufic Allouch (Lebanon)\nWheelchair basketball national organizations around the world.\nWheelchair basketball national organizations have developed in a variety of ways. Most started out the same way as IWBF, as a sub-section of a national wheelchair sport organization. As IWBF matured so did many of its member organizations and now there are several models that IWBF embraces within its membership. In Mexico the wheelchair basketball organizations are a part of their National Paralympic Committee(NPC). Australia is part of the Australian Wheelchair Athletes Ltd., and others are under the umbrella of a National Disabled Federation such as Bahrain who are part of the Bahrain Disabled Sports Federation. In the Netherlands wheelchair basketball is fully integrated into the Nederlandse Basketball Bond and in Canada the Canadian Wheelchair Basketball Association is fully independent. In all cases where a member is part of a larger federation the IWBF only recognizes the part of that federation responsible for wheelchair basketball."

        "title": "German Open (golf)",
        "text": "The German Open was a men's golf tournament. It was first staged in 1911 when the winner was Harry Vardon. The following year the champion was another of the Great Triumvirate of late 19th and early 20th century British golfers, John Henry Taylor. The tournament was then not played again for over a decade. It was played each year from 1926 to 1939; Percy Alliss won five times in this era, Auguste Boyer four times and Henry Cotton three.\nHistory.\nAfter World War II the event was not revived until 1951. It was a European Tour event from the tour's first official season in 1972 until 1999. It was played on many different courses around Germany; the last two stagings on the European Tour were at Sporting Club Berlin. It first had a title sponsor in 1978 and there were several different sponsors over the following two decades. In the 1980s and 1990s Germany's greatest 20th century golfer Bernhard Langer equalled Percy Alliss's record of five wins. In 1999 the prize fund was €1,005,982, and despite its national open status the tournament was only the fourth richest European Tour event played in Germany that year, behind the German Masters, the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open TPC of Europe and the BMW International Open.\nAnnually, the lowest scoring amateur at the German Open received the coveted \"Haubenreich Trophy\", named in honor of the Haubenreich family. The Haubenreich family long-owned a German golf superstore in Stuttgart (Golfenreich), and is recognized for its tremendous contributions to German golf. The family can trace its roots back to a Teutonic Knight named Hans Haubenreich who is credited with orchestrating the Knights' victory over a Hun-related tribe at the Battle of Brestacre. Haubenreich claimed Brestacre for the Knights, and the family has upheld the Brest legacy ever since.\nSince the European Tour began in 1972, Langer is the only player to win the same event five times, excluding majors and World Golf Championships. Mark McNulty won the German Open four times; Seve Ballesteros, Nick Faldo and Miguel Ángel Jiménez won other events four times each.\nBaden-Baden Open Championship of Germany.\nIn 1911 the Baden-Baden golf club organised a 72-hole tournament which they called the \"Open Championship of Germany\". The German Golf Association, of which Baden-Baden was a member, objected to the use of name. Owing to the disagreement the Baden-Baden club withdrew from the German Golf Association. The Championship was played on 18 and 19 August with total prize money of £250. Harry Vardon, with rounds of 69 and 67, had a 6 stroke lead after the first day. Further rounds of 71 and 72 gave him a score of 279 and a 9 stroke victory. Vardon's total was reckoned to be the lowest in a 72-hole competition. All the players agreed that the event was to be considered \"the Open Championship of Germany\".\nThe event was staged again, on 20 and 21 August 1912, with prize money doubled to 10,000 marks (£500). The German Golf Association again objected to the use of the title but the prize money attracted most of the leading British professionals. In the first round Charles Mayo broke Vardon's course record with a 65 but J.H. Taylor led at the end of the day on 133. On the final day Taylor had rounds of 73 and 73 but was caught by Ted Ray. Ray had lost two balls in his first round of 75 but three excellent rounds brought him into the joint lead. A nine-hole playoff was arranged in the evening which Taylor won with an incredible score of 28 compared to Ray's 34. The prize money was the largest ever given for a tournament in Europe."

        "text": "Dave Stewart Simpson (born March 3, 1962) is a Canadian former ice hockey player, now executive director of the Business Families Centre at the Richard Ivey School of Business at the University of Western Ontario and known as David Simpson.\nHe played junior hockey for the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League, and recorded the best single season in team history when he recorded 155 points in 1981-82. He holds the record for most points by a rookie in a single game. In that year he also won the Red Tilson Trophy, Bobby Smith Trophy, William Hanley Trophy and the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy for his accomplishments in junior hockey, as well as being named the CHL Player of the Year. No other player in OHL history has won so many trophies in one season.\nHe was drafted in the third round (59th overall) of the 1980 NHL Entry Draft by NY Islanders. He played minor pro hockey in Indianapolis and Baltimore, but decided in 1984 that hockey was not for him and quit to concentrate on his schooling. He received a B.A. in 1985 from the University of Western Ontario, and an M.B.A. in 1988 from the Richard Ivey School of Business.\nHe is the older brother of former NHL player and assistant coach and current CBC hockey broadcaster Craig Simpson and MSG Plus sportscaster Christine Simpson. He is also the son of Canadian former Olympic athlete Marion Simpson.\nSimpson's nephew, Dillon Simpson, was drafted by the Edmonton Oilers."

        "text": "This is a list of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament Final Four participants. \nFinal Four by year.\nFrom the first tournament in 1939 to 1951, the National Semifinals were also considered the Regional Championships, with the National Championship was held separately a week later. During this period, the tournament was divided into the East and West Regions. From 1952 to 1955, the Regional Championships were held at four sites, with two designated for the East and two for the West. In 1956, the four regions were given unique names for the first time. \nFrom 1946 to 1981, a consolation game was conducted before the Championship for the losing teams of the National Semifinals; the winning team was awarded third place and the losing team was awarded fourth place. In 1982, the NCAA eliminated the game and the two losing teams of the semifinal games are considered tied for third place in the official record book.\nAt the conclusion of the championship game, one player is awarded the Most Outstanding Player award. Eleven times a player was awarded the MOP without being on the championship team. Five players have won the award twice, one player, Lew Alcindor, won the award three times.\nFinal Four appearances by school.\nSince 1939, 95 schools have appeared in the Final Four. Four additional schools, Minnesota, Saint Joseph's, UMass, and Western Kentucky, had their only appearance vacated. This table shows non-vacated Final Four appearances and victories by school; vacated records are shown in parentheses. The Third Place column is blank for schools whose Final Four appearances were before 1946 or after 1981.\nTeams appearing in consecutive Final Fours.\nEleven teams have appeared three or more times in the Final Four in consecutive tournaments. In the following table, National Champions are indicated by bold years, runners-up by underlined years, and third place by italics.\nFinal Four appearances by coach.\nSince 1939, 158 head coaches have appeared in the Final Four. Six additional coaches have had their only Final Four appearance vacated. This table shows non-vacated Final Four appearances and victories by coach; vacated records are shown in parentheses. The Third Place column is blank for coaches whose Final Four appearances were before 1946 or after 1981.\nCoaches still active in Division I are highlighted in green.\nMultiple Schools.\nFifteen coaches have non-vacated Final Four appearances with multiple schools. Of these, 14 have coached two schools and only one, Rick Pitino, has coached three schools. Two additional coaches appeared with multiple schools but had all appearances with one of those schools vacated. Larry Brown appeared with UCLA and Kansas but his only appearance with UCLA school were vacated. John Calipari appeared with UMass, Memphis, and Kentucky, but his only appearances at UMass and Memphis were vacated. Five coaches are still active, with Calipari, Huggins, Larrañaga, and Sampson coaching at a school they have already taken to the Final Four. Pitino is the only coach on this list currently active at a school he has not taken to the Final Four.\nCoaches who also played in the Final Four.\nSeven coaches have both played and coached in the Final Four. Hubert Davis at North Carolina and Dick Harp at Kansas did so at the same school. Bob Knight and Dean Smith are the only two coaches to win a championship as player and coach.\nFinal Four appearances by conference.\nThe following table shows Final Four appearance statistics based on teams' conference affiliations contemporaneous to their appearance. Therefore some schools are included across multiple conferences. Conferences are listed by their current or final name as found in the official NCAA record book.\nThere have been 26 unique conferences appearing in the Final Four, of which 19 are still in existence.\nFinal Fours with multiple schools from the same conference.\nThere have been 25 Final Fours with multiple teams from the same conference. In two of these Final Fours, one of the conference team's appearance was later vacated later by the NCAA. The Big Ten has achieved this nine times, with one appearance later vacated, tying them with the Atlantic Coast Conference for non-vacated multi-team Final Four appearances. The Big East is the only conference to have three teams in the Final Four, which was in 1985. \nTeams from the same conference have played against each other in nine National Semifinal games. Only three times have teams from the same conference played each other in the National Championship.\nFinal Four appearances by state.\nSchools from 38 states, including the District of Columbia, have appeared in the Final Four. An additional state, Minnesota, had its only appearance vacated. This table shows non-vacated Final Four appearances and victories by state; vacated records are shown in parentheses. The Third Place column is blank for states whose Final Four appearances were before 1946 or after 1981. Schools noted as vacated had all their Final Four appearances vacated. \n \nFinal Fours with multiple schools from the same state.\nEleven Final Fours have had two teams from the same state. North Carolina and Ohio both have three Final Fours with two teams, the most, and Kentucky is the only other state to do it more than once. Teams from the same state have played each other four times in a National Semifinal and teams from the same state have played each other twice in the National Championship, both times Cincinnati and Ohio State in 1960 and 1961.\nVacated appearances.\nThirteen Final Four appearances have been vacated by ten schools. Two of these schools won the Third Place Game and five schools were the National Runners Up. Only one school, the University of Louisville, has had its National Championship vacated.\nReferences.\nGeneral\n\"Men's Final Four 2023 Records Book\"(PDF).

        "title": "Nigeria national cricket team",
        "text": " \nThe Nigeria national cricket team is the men's team that represents the country of Nigeria in international cricket. Cricket has been played in Nigeria since the late 19th century, and the national team played their first match in 1904, when a team representing the Lagos Colony played the Gold Coast Colony. The Nigeria Cricket Association has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2002.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nCricket has been played in Nigeria since the late 19th century when the game was introduced by the British. Contacts between the administration in Lagos and their counterparts in Gold Coast (now Ghana) led to an international at Race Course (now Tafawa Balewa Square), Lagos on 25 May 1904, the Gold Coast winning by 22 runs.\nThe match became an annual fixture and for the first three matches was multi-racial. The fourth fixture in December 1906 was for Europeans only, and the African population started their own annual fixture in 1907. Internationals stopped for the First World War, and did not restart until the mid-1920s.\nBetween the two world wars, cricket began to become more formally organised in the country with two cricket associations for the Europeans and Africans being formed in 1932 and 1933 respectively. First-class cricketers from England began to appear in the annual matches against Gold Coast, and the 1939 match, the last before World War II ended in a 58 run win for Gold Coast.\nMatches resumed after the war with a five-day match in Lagos in 1947 which ended in a draw. The 1949 match went the way of the Gold Coast. As the number of Europeans working in the country reduced, the quality of the African players increased and cricket began to be organised on multi-racial lines in 1956.\nPost independence.\nFollowing Nigeria's independence in 1960, there was much interest in cricket. Annual matches against Sierra Leone and The Gambia began in 1964, and were evenly contested until the late 1970s, when football began to become more popular in the country. Cricket began a process of decline, and when Tanzania toured in 1974, Nigeria lost two of the three matches and drew the other. They also lost heavily to the MCC in 1976. Internal problems with both the Nigeria Cricket Association and in Nigeria itself led to a decline in standards, though Nigeria formed a majority of the players on the West Africa cricket team that became an ICC associate member in 1976.\nThe West Africa team took part in the ICC Trophy tournaments of 1982 and 1997 before withdrawing from the 2001 tournament in Ontario. Nigeria still continued to play on their own on occasion, though they sometimes withdrew from tournaments, as at the 1998 Africa Cricket Association Championship. The West African Cricket Conference ceased to exist in 2002, and Nigeria became an associate member of the ICC in their own right the same year.\nICC membership.\nNigeria's first tournament after becoming an ICC member on their own was the 2002 Africa Cup in Zambia. Nigeria finished fourth in their group after their only win of the tournament against Malawi. They finished 5th in the Africa Cricket Association Championships in 2004, their only win coming against last placed Tanzania, thus failing to qualify for the 2005 ICC Trophy.\nIn August 2006, Nigeria took part in Division Two of the World Cricket League Africa Region in Tanzania, finishing last. This originally relegated them to Division Three, though they are not playing in that tournament in 2008. They won the North West Africa Championship in 2007 and 2008.\nNigeria are played in Division Two of the World Cricket League Africa Region in 2008 and came second hence qualifying for 2009 ICC World Cricket League Division Seven. They came 3rd in the tournament thus remaining in the division .\nIn May 2011 Nigeria participated in the 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Seven in Botswana. Nigeria came second in tournament this qualifying for 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Six. Then the team went to South Africa in May 2011 to participate in 2011 ICC Africa Division Two (T20) en route to qualification of 2012 ICC World Twenty20. They won the tournament and qualified for 2011 ICC Africa Division One.\nIn August 2018, they were included in the 2018 Africa T20 Cup tournament.\n2018–present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Nigeria and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have the T20I status. Nigeria's first T20I match was against Kenya on 20 May 2019, after finishing second in the North-Western sub-region qualification group, advancing to the Regional Final of the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Africa Qualifier tournament.\nIn July 2019, the ICC suspended Zimbabwe Cricket, with the team barred from taking part in ICC events. As a result of their suspension, the ICC confirmed that Nigeria would replace them in the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament.\nGrounds.\nThe 2,000-capacity Tafawa Balewa Square Oval in Lagos is the largest cricket stadium in Nigeria.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Nigeria\n\"Last updated 18 March 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Nigeria\nMost T20I wickets for Nigeria\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2526.

        "title": "Cuban baseball league system",
        "text": "The Cuban baseball league system is not a single baseball league; rather it is a structure of leagues and series that are governed by the Baseball Federation of Cuba and culminate in national championships and the selection of the Cuba national baseball team. \nIn the Cuban National Series, players play for the provinces in which they reside, with each province in Cuba (plus Havana) represented by a team. Starting in 2023, the top six teams from the National Series qualify for the top-level winter Cuban Elite League.\nOrganization of Cuban national baseball system.\nCuban Elite League.\nCreated in 2022, the Elite League (, or LEB) took over the former winter schedule that had been dominated by the National Series since its foundation season. It runs from October to February with a similar schedule and format as the SNB formerly had, with the winner of the championship series after the postseason playoffs assuming the role as Cuban representative to the Caribbean Series. \nBeginning with the 2023-24 LEB season, the top six teams of the Cuban National Series now directly qualify for the regular season of the Elite League; those teams may draft players from the lower twelve CNS teams. Previously, the Cuban National Series employing relegation of the lower eight teams halfway through the season.\nCuban National Series.\nThe National Series (, or SNB) generally runs from March to July (beginning with the 2022 season) with a schedule of 98 games per team in the regular season. The series is then followed by three playoff rounds culminating in a championship. This series was originally played each winter since 1961-62 until the 2020–21 season, before being moved to the spring in 2022. There are 16 teams organized in a West League and an East League. The top four teams from each league advance to a playoff, with the winner crowned in the championship series. Two teams have dominated the National Series in recent years: Industriales and Santiago de Cuba. From 2014 to 2019, the SNB champion team advanced directly to the Caribbean Series proper.\nSuper Series/CNS 23Us.\nFor many years the Cuban Super Series, a summer league, usually played from May through July with a schedule of about 28 games. The series is followed by a playoff between the two top teams. Its teams are selected from the best players of the National Series. In turn, the Cuba national baseball team is selected from the players in the Super Series. Five regional teams competed:\nIn 2015 the Super Series was replaced by the 23U National Series on the behest of the BFC, but with a June to September season following the CNS season and with nearly the same teams as the National Series. As it name suggests, its rosters are made up of players aged below 23 and it serves as the minor league division of the National Series.\nHistory of the Cuban baseball league system.\nPrior to the Cuban Revolution, various professional, semiprofessional, industrial, and amateur baseball leagues and teams flourished in Cuba, including the professional Cuban League and the minor league Havana Sugar Kings.\nSince the Cuban Revolution, baseball continued to thrive as Cuba's national game. In February 1961 the government created the National Institute for Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER) and in March, after the close of the 1960–61 Cuban League season, it decreed the abolition of professional baseball and plans to hold a national amateur championship. Thus, the National Series was conceptualized to serve as the national league circuit. Opening Day for the new league was slated for fall 1961.\nThe first National Series season 1961–62, included four charter teams: Occidentales, Orientales, Habana, and Azucareros. The next season the number of teams had increased to six, and in 1967 to 12. The expansion of baseball to the provinces was accompanied by the construction of new stadiums in provincial capitals, bringing first-tier baseball to the provincial population. This expansion greatly enhanced the nationwide accessibility of top-flight baseball. The two new Havana-based teams, Industriales and Habana (renamed in the 1970s to Metropolitanos), were similar to the old professional Cuban League rivals, Almendares and Habana in that Industriales, like Almendares, wore blue, while Habana/Metropolitanos, like Habana, wore red. However, after Industriales went on to capture four consecutive championships from 1963 to 1966, they became known as the premier Cuban team. Metropolitanos after the '80s, on the other hand, was unable to be competitive and has failed to re-establish the rivalry; it is now considered a second-class team, where young players and fading veterans share playing time.\nSeveral individuals were important in the transition to post-revolutionary baseball. Gilberto Torres managed the early national team and conveyed his vast knowledge of the game to the new generation of amateur players. Natilla Jiménez managed several provincial teams and was pitching coach of the national team. Juan Vistuer, Asdrúbal Baró, and Pedro Chávez also were prominent transitional coaches and managers. Conrado Marrero (former pitcher with the Washington Senators) remained in Cuba where he was a pitching coach for several teams.\nThe Cuban baseball system is designed as much to develop the nation's athletic talents as to provide entertainment to the public. Children showing athletic promise are sent to sports academies for extensive competitive training and development, with the goal of developing the nation's athletes. Some players are able to make the municipal team and advance through the sport without training in the academies, but those players are exceptional. Although players are amateurs, elite players are subsidized and given special rewards. A problem confronting Cuba's top athletes, however, is the lack of opportunities to compete against the best players in the world.\nAn opportunity for competition against the world's best professional players was finally made available by the World Baseball Classic first held in March . In 2014, representation in the Caribbean Series, last made in 1960, was finally restored.\nSome other memorable events in the history of the Cuban national baseball system are the following:\nIn 2015, the Under-23 division of the Cuban National Series began its debut season, with its players being below 23 years of age, which replaced the Super Series officially.\nIn 2022, INDER and the BFC officially ended the long monopoly of the National Series as the sole national baseball circuit, beginning that year the Cuban Elite League was launched as the country's fall baseball circuit with the NS now moved to the spring, in competition with Major League Baseball and the Mexican League.\nEmigrants.\nA number of immigrants from Cuba (sometimes described as \"defectors\") have played for the major leagues. Immediately after the Cuban Revolution many of the former professional baseball players emigrated, but for the next 30 years relatively few left Cuba.\nSince 1991, however, a number of prominent Cuban baseball players have emigrated to complete in the MLB, the Mexican League, other Central American and Caribbean leagues and beginning in the 2000s, Nippon Professional Baseball. The 2023 World Baseball Classic national team was the first ever to feature international players either from Cuba or of Cuban ancenstry."

        "title": "Chain-link fencing",
        "text": "A chain-link fence (also referred to as wire netting, wire-mesh fence, chain-wire fence, cyclone fence, hurricane fence, or diamond-mesh fence) is a type of woven fence usually made from galvanized or linear low-density polyethylene-coated steel wire. The wires run vertically and are bent into a zigzag pattern so that each \"zig\" hooks with the wire immediately on one side and each \"zag\" with the wire immediately on the other. This forms the characteristic diamond pattern seen in this type of fence.\nDevelopment of chain-link fencing.\nIn the United Kingdom, the firm of Barnard, Bishop &amp; Barnards was established in Norwich to produce chain-link fencing by machine. The process was developed by Charles Barnard in 1844 based on cloth weaving machines (up until that time, Norwich had a long history of cloth manufacture).\nIn the mid-1890s, the American Chain Link Fence Company in Medford, Massachusetts, was the first company in the United States to patent an \"exclusive manufacturing process of continuous wire fabric\" thanks to a patent by founder Guy Mafera which he first used to make spring beds. While sources vary on when Mafera first patented the method of forming chain link fence, his brother, Frank J. Mafera, patented a method of \"forming wire fence fabric\" in 1930 which made chain link fence safe and practical for residential use, as it \"eliminate[d] each ragged selvage, particularly at the top of the fence, without sacrificing anything of the essential strength and rigidity, of the fence itself, thus to avoid danger of injury to hands or clothing.\" Frank J. Mafera first sold this type of fencing from his company the Barnyard Fence Company in Raymond, New Hampshire, and his brother sold and produced the fencing at the American Chain Link Fence Company in Medford. Mafera's patent was updated in 1952, but expired in 1969 and is now used in the production of most chain link fencing.\nSizes and uses.\nIn the United States, fencing usually comes in or rolls, which can be joined by \"unscrewing\" one of the end wires and then \"screwing\" it back in so that it hooks both pieces. Common heights include one-foot increments from to , and other heights including , , and although almost any height is possible. Mesh is commonly 9, 11, or wire gauge. Mesh length can also vary based on need, with the standard diamond size being .\nFor tennis courts and ballparks, the most popular height is . Tennis courts often use a diamond size of , as measured flat side to flat side, so that power hitters cannot lodge the ball in the fence.\nThe popularity of chain-link fence is from its relatively low cost and that the open weave does not obscure sunlight from either side of the fence. A chain-link fence can be made semi-opaque by using fence inserts in the mesh. Allowing ivy to grow up the fence and interweave itself is also popular.\nInstallation.\nThe installation of chain-link fence involves setting posts into the ground and attaching the fence to them. The posts may be steel tubing, timber or concrete and may be driven into the ground or set in concrete. End, corner or gate posts, commonly referred to as \"terminal posts\", must be set in concrete footing or otherwise anchored to prevent leaning under the tension of a stretched fence. Posts set between the terminal posts are called \"line posts\" and are set at intervals not to exceed 10 feet. The installer attaches the fence at one end, stretches it, and attaches at the other, easily removing the excess by \"unscrewing\" a wire. In many cases, the installer stretches a bottom tension wire, sometimes referred to as \"coil wire\", between terminal posts to help minimize the in and out movement that occurs at the bottom of the chain-link mesh between posts. Top horizontal rails are used on most chain-link fences, although not necessary if the terminal posts are braced correctly. A top tension wire may be used in this situation. Bottom rails may be added in lieu of bottom tension wires, and for taller fences, 10 feet or more, intermediate horizontal rails are often added. Finally, the installer ties the fence to the line posts and rails with steel or aluminum wire with a hook on one end called “fence ties”. The bottom tension wire should be secured to the line posts and the chain-link mesh \"hog ringed\" to the tension wire 2' on center.\nManufacturing.\nThe manufacturing of chain-link fencing is called weaving. A metal wire, often galvanized to reduce corrosion, is pulled along a rotating long and flat blade, thus creating a somewhat flattened spiral. The spiral continues to rotate past the blade and winds its way through the previous spiral that is already part of the fence. When the spiral reaches the far end of the fence, the spiral is cut near the blade. Next, the spiral is pressed flat, and the entire fence is moved up, ready for the next cycle. The end of every second spiral overlaps the end of every first spiral. The machine clamps both ends and gives them a few twists. This makes the links permanent.\nAn improved version of the weaving machine winds two wires around the blade at once to create a double helix. One of the spirals is woven through the last spiral that is already part of the fence. This improvement allows the process to advance twice as fast."

        "text": "The Tasman Rugby Union is the governing body for rugby union in Tasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere, a bay at the north end of the South Island in New Zealand. Headquartered in Nelson, TRU is New Zealand's newest provincial union, founded in 2006 with the amalgamation of the existing Marlborough and Nelson Bays sub unions.\nThe union's premier team is the Tasman Mako which compete in New Zealand's provincial rugby competition, the Bunnings NPC.\nClub rugby.\nThere are 22 clubs in the Tasman Union.\nHistory.\nWhen the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) reviewed the domestic competitions in 2005, a new 14 team premier division of competition was created, as the Air New Zealand Cup, taking the place of the National Provincial Championship (NPC).\nThe restructured domestic competition opened the door for the Nelson Bays and Marlborough Rugby Unions to form a relationship, forming one organisation in an attempt to be awarded a position in the new competition.\nEarly years: 2006 to 2010.\nA Tasman 15 played Canada 'A' on April 26, 2006 at Trafalgar Park. The Tasman side won by 40 points, the final score being 48 points to 8. The Mako were grouped in Pool A of the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup.\nIn their first ever match in the Air New Zealand Cup, the Mako earned a bonus point in a loss to the North Harbour team, losing 33 points to 27. They were defeated by Auckland the following week by 40 points. However, the Mako won their first match in round three, defeating Manawatu by 43 points to 0.\nTheir only other win of the season came at home against , with an impressive 56–15 win.\nDespite the season record of just 2 wins and 7 losses, the Mako showed the ability to compete and provided a platform to build for the future.\nTi'i Paulo captained the side.\nThe 2007 season was disappointing for the Mako, finishing the season with a record of 2 wins and 8 losses. Wins came against and , with close losses against and .\nEarly on in the 2008 season, the NZRU announced that Tasman and would be relegated from the competition at the end of the season, due to failing to meet a set of criteria including financial stability. With the axe hovering over them, the Mako produced their best season yet, silencing their critics.\nIn round 2 against , Tasman first five Miah Nikora nailed a stunning last minute drop goal to snatch a 14–16 victory and claim the Mako first scalp over a major union. This was followed with wins over , , and a draw against to see the Mako finish the season 7th on the ladder. Facing a strong side in the quarter-finals, the Mako lost 48–10. However, their strong season coupled with public pressure forced the NZRU to reverse its decision and announce that Tasman and would remain in the competition.\nThere were doubts as to whether Tasman would contest the 2009 Air New Zealand Cup, with funding issues and disagreement amongst its stakeholders on its future. However, these disputes were resolved and Tasman finished the 2009 season in 9th place with 6 wins and 7 losses, with their most memorable performance coming in round 9 against . Tasman won 12–8 in the most significant result of their short history. The Mako had come from the brink of extinction to topple the biggest union in the country.\n2010 was disappointing for the Mako, finishing the season in 12th place on the ladder with just 4 wins, failing to hold on to their mid table status achieved in the previous two seasons. However, the Mako managed to upset eventual champions and neighbours in round 4, with a famous 27–25 victory at Trafalgar Park.\nChampionship division: 2011 to 2013.\nIn 2011, the ITM Cup was restructured into two competitions, with the top 7 teams competing for the Premiership title and the next 7 teams competing for the Championship title. Each province played the other 6 teams in their own division once, plus 4 interdivisional matches.\nThe Tasman Mako played in the Championship for 2011. Despite taking just 2 wins and finishing in last spot for the season, the Mako were well received by their fans by playing a positive attacking brand of rugby that included 4 losses by 4 points or less. Upset victories were achieved against 21–19 in Napier, and (again) 30–28 in Nelson. Shane Christie and James Marshall were selected for the New Zealand sevens team that year.\n2012 was a good season for the Mako, recording a win over to start their season the Mako went on to win 5 out of their 10 round robin games and made the semi-final where they lost to 41-34.\nIn 2013 for the first time in their short history the Mako gained promotion to the Premiership division as they won the Championship playing 12 games in the season and coming away with 10 wins, including a 49-28 win over in the semi-final at Lansdowne Park and the victory which sent them to the Premiership which was a tight 26-25 win over at Trafalgar Park.\nPremiership division: 2014 to 2021.\nTasman was promoted to the ITM Cup Premiership division for the 2014 season.\nThe Mako had a very good first year in the Premiership in 2014, making it all the way to the Premiership final where they lost in a close contest 36-32 to at Yarrow Stadium. The Mako played 12 games in the 2014 season with 8 wins, 3 losses and a 16-16 draw against at Eden Park.\n2015 was again a solid year for the Mako, playing 11 games with 7 wins and 4 losses. The Mako made it to the semi-final but lost 44-24 against at Eden Park.\n2016 and 2017 were very similar years for the Mako, making the final in both seasons. The 2016 season saw the Mako play 12 games with 8 wins, 3 losses and a 27-27 draw against at North Harbour Stadium. While the 2017 season saw the Mako play 12 games, winning 7 and losing 5. Both years though saw the Mako go down to in the final, played at Christchurch Stadium both years, with the 2016 scoreline being 43-27 and the 2017 scoreline being 35-13. The team also went through a rebrand, changing the logo and team colours ahead of the 2016 season. The logo was later changed back after it received widespread criticism.\n2018 was again a very good year for the Mako, winning 9 out of 10 of their round robin fixtures - losing only to 36-10 at Eden Park. The team made the semi-finals but lost 16-21 to in a controversial game at Trafalgar Park. 20 of the Mako squad from the 2018 season would go on to earn Super Rugby contracts for the 2019 Super Rugby season. Ahead of the 2018 season, the team changed their name from the Tasman Makos to Tasman Mako, with 'Mako' being the correct plural of the Māori name.\nAfter just 14 seasons the Tasman Mako reached the pinnacle of New Zealand provincial rugby, winning the 2019 Mitre 10 Cup and doing it unbeaten. After going through the round robin with 10 wins from 10 games the Mako played at Lansdowne Park coming away with an 18-9 win in a game that went right down to the wire. The Mako then had their fourth crack at the Premiership title when they faced at Trafalgar Park and it was fourth time lucky as the Mako came away with the win 31-14.\nThe Mako became just the second team to win back to back premiership titles, winning the 2020 Mitre 10 Cup. Hit hard by injury and without many players from their 2019 heroics the Mako were not as dominant in 2020 with heavy losses in the regular season to (40-24), (31-10) and (0-29). The Mako finished second on the premiership standings and came up against in the semi-final at Trafalgar Park, coming away with the win 19-10. They qualified for their sixth final in eight years, coming up against at Eden Park. In what was a thrilling game the Mako came away with the win 12-13.\nTasman were unable to defend their premiership title in 2021, it was a great start to the season with wins over (14–27), (16–11) and (29–48) before the side suffered a first loss 22–39 at the hands of . The Mako bounced back thumping 51–14 before having a crack at the Ranfurly Shield against where they were again unsuccessful 34–22. The side then played a non competition match against in miserable conditions, coming away with the win 26–9. A third loss came against 24–20 in Christchurch meaning it was a must win game for the Mako in Round 10 against where they came away with an impressive 34–22 win. were favourites ahead of the semi-final in Napier after losing only 1 game in the regular season, Tasman came up big hanging on to win 27–33. Yet another final for the Mako and they had a chance to make it a three peat when they met in the final in Hamilton, the side conceded 2 intercept tries and because of this lost 23–20.\nCombined competition: 2022 to present.\n2022 was a season full of disappointment for the Mako with just 4 wins from 10 games, failing to make the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. The side was missing many key players with injury and All Blacks duties but still managed to drop many games they should have won. The best performance of the season came over (52-17).\nThe Mako bounced back in 2023 as they made the quarter finals before losing to , the most impressive wins came over (24-12), (58-19) and (18-29 in the regular season). Anton Segner had a stand out season and Alex Nankivell played his final season for the side after 81 appearances.\nRanfurly Shield.\nTasman has not held the Ranfurly Shield but Marlborough held the shield for six challenges in 1973.\nTasman have been involved in four Ranfurly Shield challenges since the union's inception in 2006. Tasman lost their first challenge 26–20 at the hands of Wellington in 2008, and their second challenge 49–40 to Taranaki in 2012. Their third challenge was against Hawke's Bay in 2021, where they were defeated 34–22.

Rugby Park is located on the corner of Elles Road and Tweed Street. \nThe ground has a regular season capacity of 18,000. It has a safe temporary seating maximum capacity of 20,000 (although it can accommodate up to 30,000 with pitch seating, large grass banks and concreted standing terraces). An agreement with the Invercargill City Council saw surplus land on the ground used to build the city's new Swimming Complex. The pitch was moved geographically towards the main stand, squared off to Rugby field dimensions (originally a quasi-cricket ground), with all weather seating installed. The Pitch itself was also weather proofed with a new high volume drainage system installed.\nThe ground was constructed specifically for rugby, and was opened in April 1908. The main stand was fully rebuilt in 2002 with better player facilities and corporate boxes. Floodlighting towers to full HDMI TV standards were also installed and a purpose build media towner on the terrace side for the Rugby World Cup. Temporary seating was added in 2010 for the 2010 ITM Cup this allowed a crowd of just on 20,000 to attend the first major defence of the Ranfurly Shield against Otago on 7 August, this seating remained in place until the Rugby World Cup games in 2011.\nRugby Park is now owned by the Invercargill City Council and managed by Invercargill Venue &amp; Events Management Ltd, the city council's venue management company.\nThe Highlanders play occasionally at Rugby Park drawing large crowds.
