        "title": "Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club",
        "text": "Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club is one of twenty minor county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Cambridgeshire including the Isle of Ely.\nThe original Cambridgeshire club, established in 1844, is classified as a first-class team from 1857 to 1871. The present club, founded in 1891, has always had minor status although it has played List A matches occasionally from 1964 until 2004 but is not classified as a List A team \"per se\".\nThe club is based at The Avenue Sports Club Ground, March, though they have played a number of matches at Fenner's, Cambridge University's ground, and occasionally play games there still. In recent years, matches have also been held at Wisbech and Saffron Walden (in northeastern Essex).\nEarliest cricket.\nCricket must have reached Cambridgeshire in the 17th century. The earliest reference to the game being played there is at Cambridge University in 1710.\nOutside the university, the earliest reference is a game in 1744 in the Isle of Ely, between the gentlemen of March and the gentlemen of Wisbeach, eleven of a side, for five pounds a man.\nOrigin of club.\nCambridge Town Club and Cambridgeshire were effectively the same team as the town club teams were representative of the county as a whole. The town club's earliest known match was against Cambridge University Cricket Club in 1819 and the county name was first used for the match against Surrey in 1857.\nThe town club was formed sometime before 1819 and eventually evolved into the original county club, which was formally established on 13 March 1844, playing under the name of \"Cambridge Town and County Club\". After 1847, the name reverted to Cambridge Town.\nClub history.\nThe county club did not play matches outside East Anglia until 1857 when it played Surrey. From 1857 until 1871, the county club was recognised as holding first-class status. The club itself was dissolved in 1869 (according to \"James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Companion\" of that year) but two matches arranged in 1869 and 1871 involved playing members of the former club and the team in both these games was called Cambridgeshire by \"Wisden\" and other sources.\nThe club played 39 first-class matches in all, winning thirteen, losing 21 and drawing five. The most successful season was 1864, when all 3 matches played were won. The regular home ground was Fenner's. Thomas Hayward made the most appearances, playing in 35 of the matches. He also made most runs, with 1,934 at 33.34, and scored two of the four centuries made for the county, both in 1861. He and Robert Carpenter put on 212 for the 3rd wicket against Surrey at The Oval in 1861, both scoring centuries. This was the highest partnership for the county. George Tarrant took the most wickets: 197 at 12.25, plus a further 22 wickets for which the runs conceded are not known. He had match figures of 15–56 against Kent at Chatham in 1862, including 8–16 in an innings. He also took 8–45 in an innings against Surrey at Fenner's the same year.\nAccording to Simon Wilde, in the early 1860s Carpenter and Hayward were rated as two of the three finest batsmen in England along with Richard Daft. Daft himself ranked Carpenter and Hayward as being equal, but George Parr reckoned Carpenter to be the better. Wilde's own estimation was that Carpenter was the best batsman in England from 1860 to 1866.\nThe present club was founded on 6 June 1891.\nCambridgeshire first took part in the Minor Counties Championship in the competition's fourth season, 1898, and has competed every season since with the exception of 1902 and 1920. The club was revived in 1921 with HB Hart as Secretary and HC Tebbutt as captain, despite the club's financial situation being precarious. War veteran Tebbutt had debuted in 1901, but this was his final season. He later became notorious for murdering his partner and three children before killing himself.\nIt has won the Minor Counties Championship once, in 1963. As Eastern Division champions in both 1987 and 1988, Cambridgeshire became the first minor county to compete in four consecutive cup finals, albeit without success. Cambridgeshire have, however, won the MCCA Knockout Trophy twice since its inception, in 1995 and 2003. It also won the Eastern Division of the Minor Counties Championship again in 1994, 2011 and 2013, losing the subsequent finals.\nCambridgeshire County Cricket Club also played 28 List A matches between 1964 and 2004 (the great majority against first-class counties and occasionally on Test grounds) with 103 players making one or more appearances.\nNotable players.\nThe following Cambridgeshire cricketers also made an impact on the first-class game:"

He played in the Phillies minor league system from 1990–1996, playing for the Martinsville Phillies (1990–1991), Batavia Clippers (1992), Spartanburg Phillies (1993), Clearwater Phillies (1993–1994), Reading Phillies (1994–1995), Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons (1995–1996).\nBennett made his major league debut in for the Phillies on September 24 against the Cincinnati Reds as a pinch hitter. He was signed as a free agent by the Boston Red Sox in season and spent the season with the Pawtucket Red Sox. He returned to the Phillies organization the following year as a minor league free agent. Played most of the season with Scranton before his contract was purchased by the Phillies in September. 1998 was his first full season in the majors and he stayed with the Phillies as a backup catcher to Mike Lieberthal until he was traded to the New York Mets for fellow catcher Todd Pratt on July 23, . Bennett played in one big league game for the Mets (going 1–1) before they traded him to the Colorado Rockies a month later. He stayed with the Rockies in , having over 200 at-bats in a season for the first time in his major league career. He then signed free agent deals with the San Diego Padres for (where he eclipsed the 300 at-bat mark for the first time and set a career-high in RBI, with 42), Milwaukee Brewers for , Washington Nationals for , and St. Louis Cardinals for .\nBennett came alive in late August 2006. He hit four home runs in the span of a week, including a walk-off grand slam against the Chicago Cubs on August 27, 2006. The four home runs equaled his career high of four home runs in a single season, which he did with the 2002 Colorado Rockies. He hit no other home runs that season. In an exhibition game on March 30, 2007, against the Memphis Redbirds, the Cardinals AAA Minor League affiliate, Bennett, with the game tied 2–2, hit grand slam in the top of the 8th inning, giving the Cardinals the victory. This led many fans to call him, \"Gary Grand Slam Bennett\".\nOn November 28, 2006, Bennett was re-signed by the Cardinals.\nOn November 2, , the Cardinals exercised their buy-out option on his contract.\nOn December 13, 2007, Bennett was named in the Mitchell Report, which detailed his illegal use of performance-enhancing substances such as human growth hormone.\nOn December 17, 2007, the Dodgers signed Bennett to a one-year deal to back up Russell Martin, the Dodgers' young All-Star catcher. After signing, Bennett publicly admitted that the Mitchell Report was accurate as far as he was concerned, stating, \"As far as the report is concerned to me, it's accurate. Obviously, it was a stupid decision. It was a mistake.\" Bennett's 2008 season was cut short, however, when he went on the disabled list in mid-May for plantar fasciitis. The ailment would keep Bennett on the disabled list the remainder of the season. Veteran backup Danny Ardoin took Bennett's spot in his absence as Martin's backup. Bennett finished the 2008 campaign with a disappointing .190 batting average with one home run and four RBI in only 10 games played. After the season the Dodgers bought out Bennett's option year, making him a free agent."

He played the majority of his career in the Australian National Basketball League (NBL), where he won a championship with the South East Melbourne Magic in 1992 and was a two-time NBL Most Valuable Player in 1993 and 2001. Rose was nicknamed \"Australia's Michael Jordan\" due to his clutch shooting and defensive abilities.\nCollege career.\nRose played collegiately for the George Mason Patriots from 1982 to 1986. During his senior season, he led the Patriots to their first National Invitational Tournament (NIT). Rose was a second-team All-ECAC South selection in 1985 and a first-team All-CAA selection in 1986. He ranks in the top 10 of points (9th), rebounds (9th), steals (3rd), blocks (6th), field goal percentage (4th), free throw percentage (8th) and free throws made (9th) in Patriots program history.\nProfessional career.\nRose played 2 games in the NBA for the Los Angeles Clippers in the 1988-89 season after signing a 10-day contract. He played just 3 minutes. He later played in the Philippine Basketball Association for the Purefoods Hotdogs in the 1990 Reinforced Conference and helped the team win their first ever championship despite getting injured in the final game. He began his NBL career in 1992 with the South-East Melbourne Magic, leading his team to the championship - which would prove to be his only one. The next year Rose would average 18.6 points, 7.5 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game on his way to the National Basketball League MVP.\nRose signed to play with the Adelaide 36ers for the 1994 NBL season under a new 36ers coach, former NCAA coach Mike Dunlap. Rose combined with Mark Davis, Mike McKay, Phil Smyth and Brett Maher to lead the team to the 1994 NBL Grand Final Series where they were defeated by the North Melbourne Giants in two games (Rose averaged 32 points for the series), as well as the 1995 Semi-Finals against the Perth Wildcats. During his time in Adelaide Rose won the club's 1994 and 1995 MVP awards and was selected to the 1995 NBL All-Star Game played at Adelaide's Clipsal Powerhouse, where he won the game MVP award.\nRose then signed for a three-year stint with the Canberra Cannons where he was selected to the All NBL First Team in both 1996 and 1997. He led the Cannons to the Semi Finals in 1996 and Elimination Finals in 1997 before just missing out on a play-off berth in 1998. He then signed with the struggling North Queensland team of the Townsville Crocodiles. Rose would turn the franchise around captaining them to the semi-finals and grand final in the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 seasons. Rose capped off his team's performance by winning his second league MVP award. However the Crocodiles would be defeated by the Wollongong Hawks in the deciding game three of the grand final series.\nAfter the 2005-06 season, at age 42, the Crocodiles decided not to renew Rose's contract. He then signed with North Queensland rivals the Cairns Taipans for the 2006-07 season before retiring at the end of the year having played in 472 NBL games."

A four-time Pro Bowler and three-time first-team All-Pro selection, Anderson played his first 12 seasons with the Bengals.\nThe 11 quarterback pressures Anderson allowed in were the fourth fewest pressures allowed by an offensive tackle in a season between 2006 and 2019. He was the first right tackle to be named a First-team All-Pro in three straight seasons since Dan Dierdorf, Ron Yary, and Rayfield Wright all did it in the 1970s, and the first right tackle to be named to the Pro Bowl in four straight seasons since Jackie Slater; no right tackle has accomplished those feats since Anderson.\nIn 2021, Willie Anderson was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.\nThat following year, he became a member of the Ring of Honor induction class of 2022 for the Bengals, joining Paul Brown, Anthony Muñoz, Ken Anderson and Ken Riley.\nAnderson has a son, Jair Hawkins-Anderson, who played college football at Georgia Tech.\nHe trains offensive linemen from high school to the NFL at the Willie Anderson Lineman Academy.\nCollege career.\nAnderson attended Auburn University, where he played for the Auburn Tigers football team from 1993 to 1995.

        "text": "Canoe sailing refers to the practice of fitting an Austronesian outrigger or Western canoe with sails.\nAustronesian sailing canoes.\nThe outrigger canoe was one of the key technological innovations of the Austronesian peoples. Although there is little archeological evidence due to perishable building materials, comparative reconstructions indicate that Austronesians already had the distinctive outrigger and crab claw sail technology from at least 2000 BCE. These boats (as well as derivative technologies like the catamaran) enabled them to colonize the islands of Southeast Asia and then later on to Madagascar, the Pacific Islands, and New Zealand.\nOutrigger canoes like the \"va'a\", \"paraw\", \"jukung\", \"vinta\", and \"proa\" are still used today by traditional fishermen and traders in most of Southeast Asia and Madagascar, and in parts of Oceania. They are constructed from traditional materials, though most incorporate motor engines instead of a sail.\nIn other regions like Hawaii, Tahiti, and New Zealand, outrigger canoes are generally restricted to sport sailing and racing. Modern sailing outrigger canoes are usually made from glass-reinforced and carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, with sails made from Dacron and Kevlar.\n\"Hōkūlea\" is a modern interpretation of a Polynesian voyaging canoe. It is made from modern materials such as fibreglass, plywood, resin glue, terylene sails and ropes with modern fittings and safety equipment. In contrast with smaller outrigger canoes meant to stay within sight of land, Hōkūleʻa and other double hulled canoes are large and capable seagoing vessels typically in excess of 40 feet in length. A wide array of these double hulled or voyaging canoe are documented in ethnohistoric sources which note a wide variety in size, hull shape, rigging style, and aesthetics. These large voyaging canoes are the main mechanism by which the wider Pacific Ocean was first peopled and in their modern capacity often serve as educational tools both preserving and communicating ancient voyaging techniques. While Hōkūleʻa is undoubtedly the most famous Austronesian sailing canoe, there are many other examples across the Pacific.\nModern sailing canoes.\nJohn MacGregor of Scotland is generally believed to have developed the first modern sailing canoes. During the 1860s, he had at least seven boats built that he called \"Rob Roys\" and sailed and paddled them in Europe, the Baltic and the Middle East. He also wrote a book which popularized the design and the concept: \"in walking you are bounded by every sea and river, and in a common sailing-boat you are bounded by every shallow and shore; whereas, ...a canoe [can] be paddled or sailed, or hauled, or carried over land or water\" (\"1000 Miles in the Rob Roy Canoe\").\nMacGregor founded the British Royal Canoe Club (RCC) in 1866.\nThe New York Canoe Club followed about six years later.\nThe American Canoe Association (ACA) was founded in 1880. In 1883, ACA Secretary Charles Neide and retired sea captain “Barnacle” Kendall paddled and sailed over three thousand miles from Lake George, New York to Pensacola, Florida.\nIn 1886 the ACA and the RCC held the first international canoe sailing regatta.\nIn 1991 American Howard Rice sailed and paddled a sailing canoe solo around Cape Horn, Chile considered historically to be the Mount Everest of sailing challenges. He was awarded a Certificate of Merit by the Chilean Navy and inducted into the Cape Horners Society.\nThere are several racing classes of sailing canoes: Cruising Class or 4 Meter, C Class or 5 Meter, International Decked Sailing Canoe, and the American Canoe Association Class."

        "title": "Free solo climbing",
        "text": "Free solo climbing, or free soloing, is a form of rock climbing where the climbers (or \"free soloists\") climb solo (or alone) without ropes or other protective equipment, using only their climbing shoes and their climbing chalk. Free soloing is the most dangerous form of climbing, and, unlike bouldering, free soloists climb above safe heights, where a fall can be fatal. Though many climbers have free soloed climbing grades they are very comfortable on, only a tiny group free solo regularly, and at grades closer to the limit of their abilities. \nSome climbers' profiles have been increased by free soloing (e.g. Alex Honnold and John Bachar), but some question the ethics of this, and whether the risks they are undertaking should be encouraged and commercially rewarded. \"Free solo\" was originally a term of climber slang, but after the popularity of the Oscar-winning film \"Free Solo\", Merriam-Webster officially added the word to their English dictionary in September 2019.\nIn addition to free soloing on single-pitch and multi-pitch–including the even longer big wall climbing that features in the \"Free Solo\" film–rock climbs, free soloing is performed in a wide range of climbing types including, ice climbing and mixed climbing (which feature in \"The Alpinist\" film), as well as setting speed climbing records on alpine climbing routes (i.e. a mixture of rock and ice climbing), which features in the \"Race to the Summit\" film.\nDescription.\nFree solo climbing (sometimes referred to as \"soloing\" in the UK, or \"third-classing\" in the US), is where the climber uses no climbing protection whatsoever (and as with all free climbing, no form of climbing aid is used either); they may only use their climbing shoes and climbing chalk to ascend a single-pitch, or a multi-pitch/big wall climbing route. Free solo climbing is a special form of free climbing but is different from the main forms of free climbing, sport climbing and traditional climbing, which use climbing protection for safety. In theory bouldering is also free solo climbing (i.e. it also uses no aid or protection) but is usually not referred to as such except in the case of Highball bouldering, where falls can be serious. The most committing forms of free soloing are on multi-pitch–and the even longer big wall–routes, where any retreat is very difficult.\nIn alpine climbing the term solo climbing–as distinct from \"free\" solo climbing–can be used where the solo climber carries a rope and some aid climbing equipment to overcome some of the most difficult sections. In addition, the term rope soloing is used for any solo climber who uses a rope and a form of self-locking device for continuous climbing protection on the route; this is also not considered as \"free\" solo climbing.\nMany early 20th-century rock climbers who began to free climb (i.e., avoiding any form of aid), were often practicing free solo climbing (or rope soloing), as the effectiveness of their climbing protection (usually a rope around their waist) was minimal. In the history of rock climbing, the first ascent of Napes Needle by W. P. Haskett Smith in June 1886 – an act that is widely considered to be the start of the \"sport\" of rock climbing – was effectively a free solo. Early leaders of free climbing such as Paul Preuss, were also strongly interested in free solo climbing as being ethically purer. The 1958 ascent by Don Whillans of \"Goliath\", one of the world's first-ever E4 6a routes, was effectively a free solo (with a rope around his waist). By the 1970s, when climbing protection was sufficiently developed to be effective, the discipline of free solo climbing began to stand apart.\nPublic view.\nMany climbers praise free soloing, while others have concerns regarding the danger and the message the ascents send to other climbers. Many companies have taken these views into account when working with free soloists. Clif Bar, the nutrition bar company with long ties to climbing, dropped the sponsorship of five climbers in 2014, citing the risks they take and stirring a debate about how much risk should be rewarded.\nHowever, The North Face and Red Bull have promoted free soloists and helped the free soloing community grow. In addition, Alex Honnold, a free soloist who was previously dropped by Clif Bar, was featured in the 2018 documentary \"Free Solo\", which was met with critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The director of \"Free Solo\", Jimmy Chin, talks in the film about the ethics of undertaking the documentary, and the effect that his film team and project could have had on the outcome.\nEven in the climbing community, free soloing is controversial. In 2022, when \"Climbing\" did a feature on free soloing, they caveated all articles with: \"This article is not an endorsement of the practice\", and emphasized that in their research amongst climbers, it was only practiced by a very small minority, with many telling \"Climbing\": \"I have in the past but not anymore\".\nNotable climbers.\nWhile many rock climbers have free soloed routes (single-pitch or big wall/multi-pitch), at climbing grades well below their ability, a very small minority have practiced free soloing regularly, and at grades closer to their overall limits. The most prominent of this smaller group are those who have broken new grade milestones in free solo climbing and gained a significant profile from their soloing:\nIn addition, several other free solo practitioners are considered historically notable in free solo climbing and include the following: Patrick Edlinger, Ron Fawcett, , Brad Gobright, Dan Goodwin, Colin Haley, Derek Hersey, Jimmy Jewell, John Long, Dave MacLeod, Dan Osman, Dean Potter, Paul Preuss, and Tobin Sorenson.\nFree soloing is less common amongst female rock climbers, however, as well as Catherine Destivelle, the following female climbers are historically notable free solo practitioners: Steph Davis and Brette Harrington, both of whom have free soloed single-pitch and big wall routes.\nClimber fatalities.\nA number of notable free solo practitioners have died while free soloing:\n\"Climbing\" magazine reported that a number of prominent free solo practitioners died in related or other extreme sports, including: Dan Osman (died at age 35 while rope jumping at Yosemite), Michael Reardon (died age 42 while rock climbing sea cliffs when he was carried out to sea by a rogue wave), Dean Potter (died age 43 while wingsuit flying when he crashed at Yosemite), Brad Gobright (died age 31 while abseiling at Potrero Chico), and Hansjorg Auer (died age 35 in an avalanche at Howse Peak).\nIn film.\nA number of notable films have been made focused on free solo climbing (both on rock and on ice) including: "

        "text": "Justin Matthew Miller (born February 14, 1984) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback and return specialist for six seasons in the National Football League (NFL).

        "title": "1969–70 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The NFL playoffs following the 1969 NFL season determined the league's representative in Super Bowl IV.\nThis was the last NFL playoff tournament before the AFL–NFL merger and the last awarding of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy to the NFL champion, which was introduced in 1934.\nTournament bracket.\nThe four-team postseason format was introduced for the season, when the NFL expanded to 16 teams and realigned into four division with four teams each.\nWithin each conference, the two division winners qualified for the playoffs. In the first round, the Capitol winner met the Century winner in the Eastern Conference game, while the Coastal and Central played for the Western Conference title. The winners of the two conference games advanced to the NFL Championship Game to compete for the NFL league title and the right to face the American Football League champion in Super Bowl IV. The losers of the conference championship games played in the Playoff Bowl, a third place game at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida; the Playoff Bowl of January 1970 was its tenth and final edition.\nPrior to , the playoff sites rotated and were known prior to the start of the season. In , the hosts were the Capitol and Central division winners for the conference championships (first round), and the Western Conference for the championship game. This gave home field advantage to the Central Division winner, the Minnesota Vikings (12–2), which had the league's best record. The previous year's playoff hosts were Century, Coastal, and Eastern, respectively, and 1967 was like 1969. All three playoff games in 1969 were hosted by the team with the better regular season record.\n&lt;br&gt;\nConference Championships.\nSaturday, December 27, 1969.\nWestern Conference: Minnesota Vikings 23, Los Angeles Rams 20.\nThree weeks prior to this game, the teams met in Los Angeles in a battle between the undefeated (11–0) Rams and the 10–1 Vikings. The Vikings won that game 20–13. The rematch was played in the cold and snow of Minnesota. Despite committing more turnovers (3 to 1) and only gaining 20 more total yards (275–255), the Vikings managed to edge out the Rams for their first postseason win in franchise history.\nIn the game in L.A., the Viking defense shut down the Rams' wide receivers and outside running game, so in this game, the Rams attacked the middle of the Viking defense and neutralized the Viking pass rush with short quick passes to the tight ends. The Rams defense held Minnesota's high powered offense in check, with the \"Fearsome Foursome\" defensive line harassing Viking QB Joe Kapp. Early on, the momentum seemed to be in LA's favor. Rams safety Richie Petitbon recovered a fumble from fullback Bill Brown that gave his team a first down on the Minnesota 45-yard line. On the next play, it appeared that the Vikings took a quick lead as Carl Eller intercepted a Roman Gabriel pass and returned for a touchdown but the score was nullified on an offside penalty on Alan Page. Taking advantage of their second chance, running back Larry Smith gained 19 yards on three carries, and Gabriel eventually finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Bob Klein. The Vikings quickly stormed back, with Kapp completing four consecutive passes on a 10-play, 75-yard drive. Three of the completions were to receiver Gene Washington for 49 total yards, including a 27-yard reception that gave the Vikings the ball on the Rams' 4-yard line. Dave Osborn ran for a touchdown on the next play, tying the score at 7 with a little over 3 minutes left in the first quarter.\nLA moved the ball effectively on their next drive, but it ended on a missed 38-yard field goal attempt by Bruce Gossett. The next time they got the ball, they did much better, taking up the majority of the second quarter, including a 13-yard run by Gabriel to convert a third down. Gossett finished the drive with a 20-yard field goal to put the Rams up 10–7 with 4:30 left before halftime. Following a punt, Gabriel led his team back for more points. This time he completed passes to tight end Billy Truax for gains of 18 and 16 yards before finishing the 13-play, 65-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Truax. The Rams went into halftime leading 17–7, having scored on three of their four first half possessions.\nIn the second half, Viking coach Bud Grant adjusted his defense to stop the Ram tight ends, and his \"Purple People Eaters\" continued to punish the Ram running game. They also got increasing pressure on Gabriel. On offense, Grant neutralized the Ram pass rush by having QB Kapp run the ball, either on designed plays like quarterback draws or roll outs, or by instructing him to take off and run at the first sign of pressure. Kapp began frustrating the Rams with runs; this threat caused their pass rush to be less aggressive.\nAfter forcing the Rams to punt for the first time in the game on the opening possession of the second half, Kapp completed a 41-yard pass to Washington on the LA 12-yard line. After a Rams penalty and a 5-yard run by Kapp, Osborn finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run that cut Minnesota's deficit to 17–14. However, Minnesota's comeback attempt suffered major setbacks over the next few drives against a punishing effort from the Rams defense. The next time the Vikings got the ball, they drove deep into Rams territory, only to have Kapp throw an interception to safety Ed Meador on the LA 4-yard line. Meador fumbled the ball during the return, but linebacker Jim Purnell recovered it. After an LA punt, Kapp was intercepted again, this time by Petitbon, who returned the ball 4 yards to the Vikings' 36. Once again, the Viking defense bent but didn't break, stopping the Rams inside the 10 yard line and making them settle for a 27-yard Gossett field goal. So instead of being down 24–14, it was only 20–14 going into the fourth quarter.\nKapp subsequently marched the Vikings 65 yards downfield, completing three passes for 40 yards and going the final 2 yards himself as Minnesota took its first lead of the game, 21–20, with 8:24 on the clock. Then the Viking defense took over. After their special teams unit tackled returner Ron Smith on the 12-yard line during the ensuing kickoff, Carl Eller sacked Gabriel in the end zone for a safety, giving the Vikings a 23–20 lead and the ball. But the Rams defense held, and 1969 NFL MVP Gabriel began to march the Rams down field in the last two minutes. As they crossed midfield, it appeared the Rams might get the tying field goal or winning touchdown, but a Gabriel pass was tipped and intercepted at the Viking 40-yard line by Alan Page with 30 seconds left, allowing his team to run out the clock and win.\nGabriel completed 22/30 passes for 150 yards and two touchdowns, with 1 interception, while also rushing for 26 yards. Larry Smith was the top rusher of the game with 11 carries for 60 yards, and he caught 6 passes for 36. Kapp completed 12/19 passes for 196 yards with 2 interceptions, while also rushing for 41 yards and a touchdown. Washington caught 4 passes for 90 yards.\nSunday, December 28, 1969.\nEastern Conference: Cleveland Browns 38, Dallas Cowboys 14.\nFor the second year in a row, Cleveland eliminated Dallas from the playoffs, this time outgaining them in total yards 344 to 217 and forcing 3 turnovers, without losing any themselves.\nUnlike the previous year's game which was a defensive struggle until the Browns put the game away in the fourth quarter, Cleveland dominated the first half, holding Dallas to just 17 plays and 39 total yards. They had to punt after taking the opening kickoff, but Don Cockroft's high short kick ended up bouncing off the leg of Dallas lineman Rayfield Wright and linebacker Bob Matheson recovered for the Browns on the Cowboys' 34-yard line. Cleveland then drove to their first score on a 2-yard touchdown run by Bo Scott. The Browns later increased their lead to 14–0 by driving 55 yards to score on Bill Nelsen's 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Milt Morin. Cockroft missed two field goal attempts, but just before the end of the half, Ron Widby's 27-yard punt gave the Browns the ball on the Cowboys' 34-yard line, setting up Cockroft's 29-yard field goal that gave Cleveland a 17–0 halftime lead.\nEarly in the third quarter, Browns linebacker Jim Houston intercepted Craig Morton's pass and returned it 35 yards to the Dallas 19, leading to Scott's second 2-yard touchdown run to make the score 24–0. This time Dallas was able to respond, driving 72 yards in 12 plays, including a 26-yard catch by tight end Pettis Norman, to score on Morton's 2-yard touchdown run.\nHowever, 24–7 was as close as the Cowboys would get. In the 4th quarter, a 39-yard burst by Browns running back Leroy Kelly (the longest gain of the day for either team) set up his 1-yard touchdown plunge to give the Browns a 31–7 lead. Dallas had a chance to score after a punt play when Cockroft bobbled a low snap from rookie center Chuck Reynolds and was tackled on the Browns' 22-yard line. But faced with 4th down from the 18 after 7 plays, Morton threw a short pass intended for Walt Garrison that was intercepted by rookie cornerback Walt Sumner, who took off for an 88-yard touchdown return.\nThe only notable thing remaining in the game would be the playoff debut of 27-year old rookie Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach. He got off to a shaky start, throwing an interception that was eliminated by a Browns holding penalty, but managed to lead the Cowboys to a touchdown, rushing three times for 22 yards and completing passes to Lance Rentzel for gains of 14 and 22 yards before finding him in the end zone for a 5-yard scoring pass.\nNelsen completed 18/27 passes for 219 yards and a touchdown. His top receiver was Paul Warfield, who caught 8 passes for 99 yards. Tight end Milt Morin caught 4 passes for 52 yards and a touchdown. Kelly had 66 rushing yards on 19 carries, 10 receiving yards, and a touchdown. Scott ran 11 times for 33 yards and 2 touchdowns and had 2 receptions for 39 yards. Morton was held to just 8/24 completions for 92 yards, with two interceptions that were both converted into Cleveland touchdowns. Playing in relief, Staubach completed 4/5 passes for 44 yards and a touchdown while also rushing 3 times for 22 yards.\nNFL Championship Game: Minnesota Vikings 27, Cleveland Browns 7.\nCleveland had lost the previous season's NFL title game 34–0, and this time fared little better. The Vikings dominated the game, racking up 381 yards without losing a single turnover, while Cleveland gained just 268 yards and turned the ball over three times.\nThe Vikings took a lead just four minutes into the first quarter, driving 70 yards for a touchdown in 8 plays. The key play of the drive was a pass from Joe Kapp to receiver Gene Washington that was nearly 5 yards short of the mark. Despite the short throw, Washington was able to come back and haul it in for a 33-yard gain to the Browns' 24-yard line. Two plays later, Dave Osborn's 12-yard run moved the ball to the 7. Then two plays after that, Bill Brown accidentally slipped and bumped into Kapp while moving up to take a handoff, but Kapp simply kept the ball himself and ran it 7 yards for a touchdown.\nThe situation never got any better for Cleveland. The next time Minnesota got the ball, Erich Barnes slipped while in one-on-one coverage with Washington, enabling him to catch a pass from Kapp and take off for a 75-yard touchdown completion. Near the end of the first quarter, Browns running back Leroy Kelly lost a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Wally Hilgenberg on the Cleveland 43. Kapp then completed a 12-yard pass to Washington before Fred Cox finished the drive with a 30-yard field goal, putting the Vikings up 17–0. Later in the second period, Hilgenberg snuffed out a Cleveland scoring threat by intercepting a pass from Bill Nelsen on the Vikings' 33-yard line. Minnesota subsequently drove 67 yards in 8 plays. Kapp started the drive with a pair of completions to John Henderson for 17 total yards, while Osborn broke off a 16-yard run and ended up finishing the drive with a 20-yard touchdown burst, giving the Vikings a 24–0 lead with 4:46 left in the first half. Cleveland responded with a drive to the Vikings' 17, but turned the ball over on downs when Nelsen overthrew receiver Gary Collins in the end zone on 4th and 3.\nThe third quarter was mostly uneventful, other than Cox's 32-yard field goal that gave Minnesota a 27–0 lead after an 11-play, 80-yard drive. The most noteworthy play was a 13-yard scramble by Kapp in which he plowed into 240-pound Browns linebacker Jim Houston so hard that Houston was knocked out of the game. In the 4th quarter, Cleveland finally got on the board when a diving 18-yard reception by Paul Warfield set up Nelsen's 3-yard touchdown pass to Collins. There were still 13 minutes on the clock at this point, but there would be no more scoring. The Vikings had a drive to the Cleveland 2-yard line, but decided to let the clock run out instead of going for another score.\nKapp completed just 7/13 passes, but threw for 169 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 57 yards and another score. Osborn rushed 18 times for 108 yards and a touchdown. Washington had 120 yards and a touchdown on just 3 receptions. Kelly was the Browns' top rusher with 80 yards, while also catching two passes for 17. Nelsen completed just 17 of 33 passes for 181 yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions."

        "text": "The NFL playoffs following the 1968 NFL season determined who would represent the league in Super Bowl III.\nTournament bracket.\nWithin each conference, the two division winners qualified for the playoffs. In the start round, the Capitol and Century division winners played in the Eastern Conference Game, while the Coastal and Central division winners were in the Western Conference game. The winners of the two conference games advanced to the NFL Championship Game to compete for the NFL league title and the right to face the American Football League champion in the Super Bowl. The losers of the conference championship games played in the Playoff Bowl, a third place game held at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida.\nPrior to , the playoff sites rotated and were known prior to the start of the season. In 1968, the hosts were the Century and Coastal division winners for the conference championships (first round), and the Eastern Conference for the championship game. This effectively gave home field advantage to the Century Division winner, the Cleveland Browns (10–4). The 1967 and 1969 playoff hosts were Capitol, Central, and Western, respectively.\nThe rotation system forced the 12–2 Cowboys, champions of the Capitol Division, to play at the 10–4 Browns in the Eastern Conference playoff. In the Western Conference, the 13–1 Colts hosted the 8–6 Vikings; the home teams won both games in the opening round.\nConference Championships.\nSaturday, December 21, 1968.\nEastern Conference: Cleveland Browns 31, Dallas Cowboys 20.\nDespite the game's high score, this was actually a defensive struggle as both teams took advantage of each other's turnovers throughout the game. However, Cleveland emerged triumphant, overcoming a 10–3 first half deficit with 21 unanswered points.\nEarly in the first quarter, Mike Howell intercepted a pass from Don Meredith (who was playing in his final game) and returned it 20 yards to set up Don Cockroft's 38-yard field goal. Dallas took the lead later on, when linebacker Chuck Howley forced a fumble while sacking Browns quarterback Bill Nelsen and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown.\nIn the second quarter, Dallas increased their lead to 10–3 when an interception by Cowboys linebacker Dave Edwards led to Mike Clark's 16-yard field goal. However, the Browns tied the game with a last minute drive at the end of the half, moving the ball 85 yards in 4 plays and scoring on Nelsen's 45-yard touchdown pass to running back Leroy Kelly.\nThe Browns broke the game open on the first play of the second half when linebacker Dale Lindsey intercepted Meredith's sideline pass intended for Bob Hayes and raced 27 yards to the end zone, giving Cleveland a 17–10 lead. Then on the third play after the ensuing kickoff, Meredith threw a pass that bounced out of the grasp of Lance Rentzel and was picked off by defensive back Ben Davis, who returned the ball 3 yards to the Cowboys' 35. On the next play, Kelly took a pitch to the right and ran 35 yards for a touchdown, increasing Cleveland's lead to 24–10.\nDallas coach Tom Landry eventually replaced Meredith with Craig Morton, who managed to lead the team to a 47-yard field goal by Clark with 3:24 left in the 3rd quarter. But 24–13 was as close as the score would get. On Cleveland's next drive, Nelsen's play action pass to Paul Warfield picked up 39 yards and a first down on the Dallas 11-yard line. Three plays later, Ernie Green's 2-yard touchdown run gave them an insurmountable 31–13 4th quarter lead. All that remained in the game would be Morton's meaningless 2-yard touchdown pass to fullback Walt Garrison with a minute left in regulation. The final 31 seconds would never be reached because the game had to be called off, as Cleveland fans spilled out on the field for an early victory celebration.\nNelsen completed 13 of 25 passes for 203 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Kelly rushed for 87 yards, caught two passes for 46 yards, and scored two touchdowns.\nSunday, December 22, 1968.\nWestern Conference: Baltimore Colts 24, Minnesota Vikings 14.\nBaltimore shut out the Vikings for the first three quarters and built a 21–0 lead to earn a trip to the NFL championship game.\nThe Colts got their first scoring chance early in the first quarter when defensive back Jerry Logan intercepted a pass from Vikings QB Joe Kapp and returned it 24 yards to the Minnesota 22. The Vikings defense managed to prevent a score when Earsell Mackbee recovered a fumble from running back Tom Matte, but after a punt, Colts quarterback Earl Morrall completed a 39-yard pass to Willie Richardson that gave the team a first down on the Vikings' 36-yard line. On the next play, Richardson made a leaping catch on the 3-yard line for a 33-yard gain. Minnesota managed to stuff two Colts rushing attempts, but on third down, Baltimore got on the board with Morrall's 3-yard touchdown pass to Tom Mitchell. This ended up being the only score of the half. The only other highlights would be an interception from each team, by Ed Sharockman and Bobby Boyd.\nColts kicker Lou Michaels missed a 33-yard field goal attempt early in the third quarter, but the Colts got the ball back with great field position at midfield after the Vikings punted. Then on the second play of the Colts' ensuing drive, Morrall threw a pass to tight end John Mackey, who broke ahead of linebacker Roy Winston, caught the ball and then raced past safeties Karl Kassulke and Paul Krause to score on a 49-yard touchdown completion, giving the Colts a 14–0 lead. Vikings returner Clint Jones gave his team a chance to get back in the game with a 35-yard kickoff return to the Colts' 42-yard line. However, on the second play of the possession, Bubba Smith plowed into Kapp as he was winding up to throw a pass, knocking the ball out of his hand and right into the arms of linebacker Mike Curtis, who returned the fumble 60 yards to the end zone.\nFaced with a 21–0 deficit in the 4th quarter, Minnesota drove 77 yards, aided by two catches by Gene Washington for 27 yards and a 33-yard pass interference penalty on Lenny Lyles that gave them a first and goal on the Baltimore 1-yard line. After that, Kapp threw a 1-yard touchdown toss to tight end Bill Martin. However, a 33-yard field goal by Michaels quickly snuffed out the Vikings' hopes of a miracle comeback. All they could do with the remaining time was make the final score 24–14 when Kapp finished off a 73-yard drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to running back Bill Brown with 4 seconds left on the clock.\nMorrall completed 13 of 22 passes for 280 yards and two touchdowns, with 1 interception. Richardson caught 6 passes for 148 yards, while Mackey had 3 receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown. Kapp finished the day 26 of 44 for 287 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions. He was also the game's leading rusher with 10 carries for 52 yards. Washington caught 5 passes for 95 yards.\nNFL Championship Game: Baltimore Colts 34, Cleveland Browns 0.\nBaltimore held Cleveland to just 173 total yards as they avenged their only regular season loss of the year, against the Browns, with a dominant shutout win. Cleveland crossed midfield only twice, just once in each half, and kicker Don Cockroft missed three field goal attempts.\nThings actually started out promising for Cleveland. Browns defensive back Ben Davis wiped out a scoring chance for Baltimore on their opening drive when he intercepted a pass from Earl Morrall on the Cleveland 14-yard line. The Browns then drove to the Colts' 35-yard line, with Bill Nelsen completing passes to Paul Warfield and Milt Morin for gains of 16 and 22 yards. However, Nelsen was dropped for a 7-yard loss on first down by Fred Miller and Ordell Braase. He managed to lead the team back to the 35 by the time they got to 4th down, but Cockroft's 42-yard field goal attempt was blocked by defensive tackle Bubba Smith. The Colts then took over and drove to a 3–0 lead on a 28-yard field goal by Lou Michaels.\nIn the second quarter, Baltimore completely took over the game. Colts running back Tom Matte scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Colts a 10–0 lead. Later on, the Colts seemed to blow a scoring chance when tight end John Mackey lost a fumble that was recovered by Erich Barnes and returned 9 yards to the Browns' 23. But on the next play, linebacker Mike Curtis intercepted a pass from Nelsen on the 33, leading to Matte's 12-yard touchdown run that gave Baltimore a 17–0 lead going into halftime.\nAfter halftime, Cleveland forced a punt and got the ball on their own 40, where they proceeded to drive to the Colts' 38. But once again their drive stalled and Cockroft missed a 50-yard field goal attempt. He got another chance as a result of a penalty on the play, but missed again from 45 yards on his next attempt. After an exchange of punts, Baltimore got the ball on the Cleveland 48 and drove to a 24–0 lead on Matte's third touchdown of the day. Meanwhile, Nelsen was benched and replaced by Frank Ryan, but this did nothing to improve Cleveland's misfortunes. On his first play, he fumbled the snap, and linebacker Don Shinnick recovered the ball on the Browns' 20-yard line, leading to Michaels' second field goal, giving Baltimore a 27–0 lead on the second play of the 4th quarter. Ryan completed just 2 of 6 pass attempts for the rest of the game, while Colts running back Timmy Brown scored the final points on a 4-yard touchdown run.\nMatte, an Ohio native and former quarterback at Ohio State, was the sole offensive star of the game, rushing for 88 yards and 3 touchdowns, while also catching 2 passes for 15 yards."

        "title": "1967–68 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The NFL playoffs following the 1967 NFL season culminated in the NFL championship game on New Year's Eve, and determined who would represent the league against the American Football League champions in Super Bowl II.\nWith 16 teams in the league in 1967, this was the first season that the NFL used a four-team playoff tournament. The four division winners advanced to the postseason, with the two division winners in each conference meeting in the first round (effectively being conference championship games). The championship game this year was the famous Ice Bowl, played in Green Bay on December 31.\nAlthough the Baltimore Colts (11–1–2) had tied for the best record in the league, they lost the new division tie-breaker (point differential in head-to-head games) to the Los Angeles Rams and were excluded from the postseason. The teams had tied in mid-October in Baltimore and the Colts entered the last game undefeated, but lost 34–10 to the Rams in Los Angeles on December 17. In previous seasons, unscheduled tiebreaker games were played (with head-to-head results disregarded); the last was just two years earlier.\nTournament bracket.\nWithin each conference, the two division winners qualified for the playoffs. In the first round, the Capitol Division winner met the Century Division winner in the Eastern Conference game, while the Coastal Division winner faced the Central Division winner in the Western Conference game. The conference champions advanced to the NFL Championship Game, whose winner played the American Football League champion in Super Bowl II at the Orange Bowl in Miami on January 14. The losers of the conference championship games met in the third place Playoff Bowl, also in Miami, on January 7.\nPrior to , the playoff sites rotated and were known prior to the start of the season. In 1967, the hosts were the Capitol and Central division winners for the conference championships (first round), and the Western Conference for the championship game, effectively giving home field advantage to the Central Division winner, the two-time defending NFL champion Green Bay Packers, who clinched their division title with three games remaining. The 1968 playoff hosts were Century, Coastal, and Eastern, respectively, and 1969 was like 1967.\nThe rotation system forced the Rams (11–1–2) to play at the Packers (9–4–1) in the Western Conference playoff. It had no effect in the Eastern Conference; Cleveland and Dallas were both 9–5, and the Cowboys defeated the Browns during the regular season. With the rotation system it was common for the host team to have an inferior record; it had occurred in four of the previous five NFL championship games (1962, 1964, 1965, 1966), with the home teams winning twice (1964, 1965).\n&lt;br&gt;\nConference Championships.\nSaturday, December 23, 1967.\nWestern Conference: Green Bay Packers 28, Los Angeles Rams 7.\nThe Rams came into the Western Conference Championship with all the momentum, possessing the NFL's best record, but having barely beaten the Packers two weeks earlier by a score of 27–24. In that game in Los Angeles, the Rams blew a 4th quarter lead, and needed a last-second touchdown set up by a blocked punt to pull out the game and keep their division title hopes alive, while the Packers had already clinched their division (and had home field in the playoffs) and were playing only for pride. In this postseason game, Green Bay would be playing for more than pride, as they were attempting win a third consecutive NFL title, unprecedented in the playoff era. The weather was expected to be cold and snowy; the snow held off but the temperature was . However, the field condition was poor, and the Rams had accused the Packers of over watering the field to slow down the devastating pass rush of the Rams' Fearsome Foursome, who sacked Starr six times in the game in L.A. For three weeks prior, the field at County Stadium was covered by a tarpaulin and thirty tons of hay.\nBy the end of the game, LA forced four turnovers, three fumble recoveries and an interception. But they were only able to convert one of them into a score, a first quarter fumble by Carroll Dale that was recovered by defensive back Chuck Lamson on the Rams' 46-yard line. This set up Roman Gabriel's 29-yard touchdown pass to Bernie Casey, giving the Rams a 7–0 lead. But this was all the Rams could do in the first half, as Green Bay's defense took over. Three times, they would drive into Green Bay territory, and each time they would fail to score. Lamson's interception of a Bart Starr pass resulted in nothing when Dave Robinson blocked Bruce Gossett's 24-yard field goal attempt. The Rams also lost the ball twice in Packers territory as a result of failed 4th down conversion attempts.\nIn the second quarter, Green Bay's Tom Brown returned a punt 39 yards to the Rams 46-yard line. On the next play, rookie Travis Williams raced 46 yards for Green Bay's first touchdown. Later on, Gossett's 46-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts, and Willie Wood returned the ball 44 yards to the Packers' 45. The Packers then drove 55 yards in 10 plays to score on Starr's 18-yard touchdown pass to Dale, giving the team a 14–7 lead going into halftime.\nLed by Jerry Kramer and Forrest Gregg, the Packers' offensive line neutralized the vaunted \"Fearsome Foursome\" of Los Angeles. Where they had thoroughly harassed Starr in the Rams' victory two weeks before, Starr was sacked only once in the playoff contest. The Packers defensive line took Gabriel down five times (3.5 of the sacks were by Henry Jordan) and pressured him into throwing inaccurate passes all day. Early in the third quarter, LA recovered another Green Bay fumble, giving them a first down on the Packers' 26-yard line. But this drive ended with no points when Gossett missed another field goal try, this one a 37-yard attempt. The Packers then drove 80 yards to go up 21–7 on Chuck Mercein's 6-yard touchdown run. In the 4th quarter, Starr's 48-yard completion to Dale set up the final score on a 3-yard touchdown run by Williams. This was the only NFL playoff game ever held at Milwaukee County Stadium.\nStarr completed 17 of 23 passes for 222 yards and a touchdown, with 1 interception, while also rushing for 8 yards. Dale caught 6 passes for 109 yards and a score. Williams rushed for 88 yards and two touchdowns, while also catching an 8-yard pass. Gabriel completed just 11 of 31 passes for 186 yards and a touchdown, with 1 interception. Casey caught 5 passes for 81 yards and a touchdown. Lamson had two fumble recoveries and an interception.\nSunday, December 24, 1967.\nEastern Conference: Dallas Cowboys 52, Cleveland Browns 14.\nLike the Dallas Cowboys, the wildly inconsistent Cleveland Browns underachieved themselves to a 9–5 record. The Browns featured one of the best running games in the league with Leroy Kelly, while the Cowboys had one of the best run defenses in the game. \"Dandy\" Don Meredith, the Cowboys quarterback, had been hampered by injuries all year, but Meredith was fully recovered for the contest with the Browns, completing 10 of his 12 pass attempts for 212 yards and 2 touchdowns.\nDallas scored on their opening drive, moving the ball 80 yards in 13 plays, including a 24-yard run by Don Perkins, to score on Meredith's 3-yard touchdown pass to running back Craig Baynham. Later in the first quarter, Cowboys receiver Bob Hayes returned a punt 64 yards before punter Gary Collins tackled him on the Browns' 13-yard line. Four plays later, Perkins crashed through the line for a 1-yard touchdown run on fourth down to give Dallas a 14–0 lead.\nIn the second quarter, Cleveland seemed ready to respond when Leroy Kelly took off for a 46-yard run to the Cowboys' 10-yard line. But after being forced into a 4th down situation, a bad snap spoiled Lou Groza's field goal attempt. Dallas took over on their own 10-yard line, and two plays later, Hayes raced past Browns cornerback Mike Howell, caught a pass from Meredith past midfield, and took it all the way to the end zone for an 86-yard touchdown reception. Following a punt, Dallas drove 52 yards in 9 plays to score on Danny Villanueva's 10-yard field goal, giving them a 24–0 lead. With time running out in the second quarter, Cleveland quarterback Frank Ryan put together a last second touchdown drive, completing a 15-yard pass to Kelly and two passes to tight end Milt Morin for gains of 10 and 12 yards (the 12-yard reception converted a 4th and 11 situation). With just 4 seconds left on the clock, Ryan cut the score to 24–7 with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Morin.\nStill any hopes of a comeback were quickly dashed in the second half, as Meredith completed a 36-yard pass to Hayes on the Browns' 4-yard line that set up Baynham's 1-yard touchdown run, putting the Cowboys up 31–7. Cleveland responded with a drive to midfield, but this was stopped cold when Kelly was stuffed for no gain on 4th and 1. The Browns managed to prevent a score when linebacker Dale Lindsey recovered a fumble from Lance Rentzel on the Browns' 18-yard line, but their offense ended up punting again, and Hayes returned it 68 yards to the Cleveland 2. Three plays later, Perkins' 1-yard touchdown made the score 38–7. Then it became 45–7 when Cornell Green intercepted Ryan's pass and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown.\nMeredith was replaced by Craig Morton for most of the fourth quarter, but Dallas still managed to put together another touchdown drive, moving the ball 57 yards to Baynham's 3rd touchdown of the game, this one on a 1-yard run. Meanwhile, all Cleveland could do was cut the final score to 52–14 when Ryan threw a 75-yard touchdown pass to Paul Warfield with 2:12 left in the game.\nHayes finished the game with five receptions for 144 yards and 3 punt returns for 141. His 141 punt return yards was an NFL playoff record until broken by Anthony Carter in the 1987 playoffs. His special teams effort would make a huge difference, as both teams were fairly even in yards gained (401 for Dallas, 322 for Cleveland) and turnovers (2 for Cleveland, 1 for Dallas) Perkins rushed for 74 yards and two touchdowns, while also catching a 4-yard pass. Ryan finished the game 14/30 for 194 yards, with two touchdowns and 1 interception. Kelly rushed for 96 yards and caught 4 passes for 39. Warfield caught 3 passes for 99 yards and a touchdown."

        "text": "Joe Gould (August 13, 1896 – April 21, 1950) was an American boxing manager best known for representing boxer James J. Braddock, dubbed \"The Cinderella Man,\" who in 1935 upset Max Baer to become the world heavyweight champion. He also managed lightweight contender Ray Miller from 1930–1933.\nCareer.\nGould met then 20-year-old amateur boxer James Braddock at Joe Jeanette's gym in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1925. With Gould as his manager, Braddock turned pro in 1926 and went 14-0-2 before losing his first fight. After a completely one-sided loss to defending Light Heavyweight champion Tommy Loughran in July 1929, Braddock's career fell into decline as he lost more than won. By 1933, unable to support his family as a boxer, Braddock worked as a longshoreman and went on public assistance.\nGould was instrumental in forging a phenomenal comeback for Braddock in June 1934 when Primo Carnera was scheduled to defend his Heavyweight title against Max Baer. The promoters needed an opponent for up and coming John “Corn” Griffin on the undercard. Gould pleaded for Braddock to be inserted as Griffin's opponent stating that Braddock needed money just to put food on the table for his children. They agreed to pay him $250 for a 6-rounder against Griffin which Braddock won in 3 rounds. Five months later Braddock decisively won a rematch against John Henry Lewis in 10 rounds followed by an easy 15-round decision against Art Lasky.\nBraddock was then slated to face Max Baer, the reigning heavyweight champion of the world. On June 13, 1935, at Madison Square Garden, the 10-to-1 underdog Braddock won the world heavyweight championship in one of the most stunning upsets in boxing history. On June 27, 1937, Braddock lost the title to Heavyweight contender Joe Louis. Seven months later, in the final fight of his career, he defeated Tommy Farr in Madison Square Garden.\nLater life.\nGould enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942, and became a first lieutenant. He was dismissed from the Army and sentenced to three years of hard labor after a court-martial in 1944 for conspiracy to accept bribes.\nGould died from leukemia on April 21, 1950.\nFictional portrayals.\nIn the 2005 film \"Cinderella Man\", Gould is portrayed by actor Paul Giamatti. The role earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor."

        "title": "Aaron Hill (baseball)",
        "text": "Aaron Walter Hill (born March 21, 1982) is an American former professional baseball second baseman. Hill played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays, Arizona Diamondbacks, Milwaukee Brewers, Boston Red Sox, and San Francisco Giants.\nThe Blue Jays selected Hill in the first round (13th overall) of the 2003 MLB draft and made his MLB debut with them in 2005. Hill was an All-Star in 2009. He is one of only five players in MLB history to hit for the cycle twice in one season. He won the Silver Slugger Award in both the National League and the American League, the first player to do so in MLB history.\nEarly life.\nAt age 15, Hill and friends were participating in a soccer tournament in Park City, Utah. While on their way to a round of golf, a college student narrowly missed Hill's car and slammed into his mother's car following behind him. Hill's mother, Vicki, was killed as a result.\nCollege career.\nHill was originally drafted by the Anaheim Angels in the seventh round (200th overall) of the 2000 MLB draft. Hill turned down the offer, opting to attend Louisiana State University and play for the varsity Tigers baseball team. While at LSU, Hill posted a career .335 batting average with 23 home runs and 150 RBIs. In 2001, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named a league all-star and the playoff MVP of Wareham's league championship team.\nProfessional career.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nHill was Toronto's first draft pick (13th overall) in the 2003 MLB draft, and he made his major league debut on May 20, 2005, against the Washington Nationals, after being called up from the minor leagues a day earlier as an injury replacement for Corey Koskie. Hill would finish the game 2-for-4, and he recorded an RBI triple off Nationals pitcher Claudio Vargas for his first career hit as the Blue Jays won, 6–1. Although he was brought up as a shortstop, Hill appeared as a third baseman, a designated hitter, and as a second baseman during the course of the season. He finished the 2005 season with a .274 batting average, .348 OBP, and 25 doubles in 361 at-bats. After the trade of Orlando Hudson to the Arizona Diamondbacks, Hill became the starting second baseman for the Blue Jays in 2006, but was moved back to shortstop mid-season after the demotion of Russ Adams. After experiencing defensive struggles at shortstop, he was then moved back to second base, with John McDonald taking over at shortstop.\nOn May 29, 2007, in a game at home against the New York Yankees with Andy Pettitte pitching, Hill became only the second player in Blue Jays history to accomplish a \"straight steal\" of home.\nHill won a Fielding Bible Award at second base for his fielding excellence in 2007.\nOn April 4, 2008, Hill agreed to a four-year, $12 million deal that included a club option that could have run through the 2014 season. The contract would have been worth as much as $38 million if Toronto kept Hill in the fold for all seven years of the deal.\nOn May 29, Hill suffered a Grade II concussion in a collision with teammate David Eckstein during a game against the Oakland Athletics. Hill missed the remainder of the season.\nHill returned from his concussion during spring training. On July 5, 2009, Hill was selected by managers and players to take part in the All-Star Game in St. Louis. Hill finished the 2009 season with 37 doubles, 36 home runs, 108 runs batted in, and a batting average of .286 in 158 games. After the season, Hill received the AL Comeback Player of the Year Award. He was voted the Blue Jays Player of the Year. He was also honored with his second Fielding Bible Award.\nPrior to the first game of the 2011 season, the Blue Jays announced that they had declined the three option years on Hill's contract. Hill was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 24, retroactive to April 20, with a strained hamstring.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn August 23, 2011, Hill and John McDonald were traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for second baseman Kelly Johnson. Hill hit his first home run as a Diamondback on August 28 against the San Diego Padres, a two-run shot to right field off starter Cory Luebke.\nIn Game 4 of the 2011 NLDS, Hill hit his first postseason home run. The Diamondbacks would, however, lose the division series to the Milwaukee Brewers in 5 games.\nAfter the 2011 season, the Diamondbacks resigned Hill to a two-year, $11 million contract extension.\nOn April 7, 2012, Hill, who got moved up in the order to the #2 spot, went 2-for-4 with 3 RBI and two home runs against the Giants in the first and second innings, both off of Madison Bumgarner. This came after going 0-for-4 on Opening Day while hitting eighth. The D-Backs went on to win 5–4.\nOn June 18, 2012, Hill hit for the cycle against the Seattle Mariners. On June 29, 2012, Hill again hit for the cycle against the Milwaukee Brewers, becoming the first player to hit for the cycle twice in one season since Babe Herman in 1931 for the Brooklyn Robins and the first modern-era player to do so in the same month (John Reilly hit cycles a week apart in 1883).\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn January 30, 2016, Hill was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers along with Chase Anderson, Isan Diaz, and cash considerations for Jean Segura and Tyler Wagner. On May 7, 2016, Hill had a career day at the plate hitting three home runs and driving in seven runs. His home runs included a game-tying home run in the eighth inning and a go-ahead grand slam in the tenth inning. Hill had only hit three home runs in his previous 82 games at the time.\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn July 7, 2016, the Brewers traded Hill to the Boston Red Sox for Aaron Wilkerson and Wendell Rijo.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn February 17, 2017, Hill signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. Through 80 plate appearances, Hill managed just a .132 batting average with a home run, 7 RBI, and a strikeout to walk ratio of 13/11. He was designated for assignment on June 24, and was released five days later."

He refereed only 19 games before becoming a linesman.\nAt the time of his retirement after the 1987 season, D'Amico was the last on-ice official active during the Original Six era. D'Amico's career included 1,689 regular season games, seven All-Star games, including the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87, and 247 Stanley Cup playoff games, including 52 Stanley Cup Finals. His last one was in 1987. He also worked the Canada Cup. In 1988, D'Amico was watching a Leafs game on TV at home when a linesman had to leave a game because of an injury. In response, D'Amico arrived at Maple Leaf Gardens and finished the game, marking his final on-ice performance as an NHL linesman.\nAfter retirement, he became a supervisor of officials for the NHL until his death in 2005. D'Amico was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1993.\nPersonal life.\nHis health problems started in September 2002 when he suffered a heart attack and underwent bypass surgery.

        "title": "List of basketball players who have scored 100 points in a single game",
        "text": "In basketball, points are the sum of the score accumulated through field goals (two or three points) and free throws (one point). It is a rare achievement for an individual player to score 100 points in a single game. What follows is an incomplete list of all of the verified occurrences of players scoring 100 points or more. Each individual instance of the accomplishment may have been achieved under varying circumstances, such as game length, opponent skill level and the league in which it occurred.\nInternationally, the highest single player total between national teams is 116 points, scored by the Philippines' Lou Salvador in May 1923 against China. It happened during the 1923 Far Eastern Games. The highest single game total in worldwide organized basketball history, irrespective of gender, age or competition level, is 272 points, scored by a 13-year-old boy named Mats Wermelin of Sweden. He recorded every single point in his team's 272–0 win on February 5, 1974, during a regional boys' tournament held in Stockholm. As an adult, Wermelin played as a guard for Hammarby IF, Järfälla and Stockholm Capitals. The highest total by a female basketball player worldwide is 136, scored by Anat Draigor of Israel. It happened on April 5, 2006, in a 158–41 win. Draigor was 46 years old playing in an Israel Division III League playoff game, which also makes her the oldest player in history to score 100 points. Only one player, other than the United States' Bevo Francis and Jack Taylor, has recorded multiple 100-point games in organized competition. Croatia's Marin Ferenčević scored 101 and 178 points in April and May 2006, respectively, during Under-14 Croatian League matches.\nIn the United States, 100-point games have occurred at least once at most levels of education. At the middle school level, 13-year-old 8th grader Bob Harrison scored all 139 of his team's points in a 139–8 win on February 3, 1941. In high school, there have been 24 verified occurrences, 19 by male players and 5 by female players. The first recorded instance was in 1913, when Herman Saygar of Culver High School (Indiana) scored 113 points against Winamac High School. The first female to score 100 points at the high school level was Denise Long of Union-Whitten High School (Iowa), who scored 111 points during a state playoff game in the spring of 1968 against Dows High School. That season, Long's senior year of 1967–68, she averaged a still-standing national record 68.2 points per game. Her single game total stood as the high school female record for 38 years until Epiphanny Prince scored 113 for Murry Bergtraum High School (New York) on February 2, 2006. The boys' high school record is 135 points, scored by Danny Heater on January 26, 1960. Playing for Burnsville High School (West Virginia) against Widen High School, Heater made 53 of 70 field goals and 29 of 41 free throws. His 135-point outburst is still the highest total for the high school level worldwide.\nAt the college level, there have been seven 100-point games, two of which were recorded by Clarence \"Bevo\" Francis of Rio Grande College and two by Jack Taylor of Grinnell College. Francis scored 116 points against Ashland College on January 9, 1953, but the opponent was not a four-year institution, so the total did not count as the official college record. One year later, on February 2, 1954, Francis scored 113 against Hillsdale College, which was the recognized highest total in United States college basketball history for 59 years; Grinnell's Taylor scored 138 points on November 20, 2012 to set the new all-time NCAA all-divisions mark. He again recorded 100+ points on November 17, 2013 when he scored 109 against Crossroads College. Frank Selvy of Furman University is the only player to score 100 points at the Division I level. Selvy recorded exactly 100 points on February 13, 1954—less than two weeks after Francis scored 113—against Newberry College. He scored his 99th and 100th points on a 40-foot shot as the final buzzer sounded.\nProfessionally, there have been a number of occurrences of 100-point games worldwide. It has only happened once in the United States, however. Wilt Chamberlain of the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia Warriors scored 100 points on March 2, 1962 against the New York Knicks during a game played at Hersheypark Arena in Hershey, Pennsylvania. He made 36-of-63 field goals and 28-of-32 free throws, the latter being a particularly unusual statistic considering Chamberlain was a 51.1% free throw shooter for his career.\nKey.\nMost of the players' exact statistics cannot be found, but whatever information was able to be verified is included. When a dash (—) appears in the three-point field goal statistic, it indicates that three-pointers had yet to be implemented and were therefore not an applicable statistic.\nUnited States.\nHigh school.\nSince 1913, 19 male and seven female players have scored 100 points or more in United States high school basketball games."

        "title": "Volley (tennis)",
        "text": "A volley in tennis is a shot in which the ball is struck before it bounces on the ground. Generally a player hits a volley while standing near the net, although it can be executed farther back, in the middle of the tennis court, or even near the baseline. The word derives from M. French \"volée\" meaning flight.\nThe primary objective of the volley is to go on the offensive and cut the amount of time for the opponent to react. Another advantage is that a player eliminates any possibility of a bad bounce from an uneven surface such as on some grass and clay courts. Also, if near the net, a volleyer has a wider choice of angles to hit into the opponent's court. However, quick reflexes and hand–eye coordination are required to execute this shot. The primary means of countering a volley are the passing shot and the lob.\nGenerally, a player who advances to the net in the serve and volley type of game will make the initial volley fairly near the service line. The player will then move closer to the net in hopes of making a put-away volley for a winning point. It is difficult to hit an effective volley in the area between the baseline and the service line, and consequently this is often called \"no man's land\".\nHitting a volley and variants.\nA regular volley is hit with a short backswing and a punching stroke. While standing at the net, a player usually has no time to take a long backswing. When the ball comes at less pace, though, the volleyer can take a longer backswing to impart more force on the ball, which is called a \"swing volley\". A player can also touch the ball lightly, so that the ball will fall just after the net. This is known as a \"drop volley\".\nAnother type of volley is the drive volley. This is hit with full backswing and follow through. Effectively this is a volley equivalent of a groundstroke and a very aggressive shot, giving your opponent less time, and can be used as a way to approach the net (approach shot).\nTo be effective and safe, a volley should be either (1) a drop volley that barely passes the net so the opposing player will not be able to get to it, or (2) a very sharply angled shot so that again the opponent will not be able to get to it, or (3) a hard shot that bounces very near both the opponent's baseline and the sideline and that serves as a set-up shot in anticipation of a weak return by the opponent. Any other volley will permit the opponent to get to the ball in plenty of time to make an aggressive return shot, either a lob or a passing shot.\nHalf volley.\nThis tennis shot is called a half volley given that the ball has not been intercepted before it bounced. The racquet contacts the ball almost at surface level. The lower the ball comes at the volleyer, the more difficult this shot becomes as it requires both adaptive thinking and quick reflexes. In such cases, it can be more advantageous to let the ball bounce and immediately hit the return on the rise rather than attempt to volley it. Some notable half volley experts included players such as: John McEnroe, Patrick Rafter, and Leander Paes."

        "text": "A hold (abbreviated HLD, H or HD) is awarded to a relief pitcher who meets the following three conditions:\nThe hold is not an official Major League Baseball statistic.\nDescription.\nUnlike saves, wins, and losses, more than one pitcher per team can earn a hold for a game, though it is not possible for a pitcher to receive more than one hold in a given game. A pitcher can receive a hold by protecting a lead even if that lead is lost by a later pitcher after his exit.\nThe hold was invented in by John Dewan and Mike O'Donnell to give a statistical measure of the effectiveness of the vast majority of relief pitchers who are afforded few opportunities to close a game. While middle relievers earn their share, holds are most often credited to setup pitchers.\nIn 1994, PA SportsTicker created an alternate definition for a hold, removing the requirement that a pitcher needs to make an out in order to record a hold. In 2009, STATS LLC purchased PA SportsTicker, and the alternate definition is no longer in use.\nWhile holds are not an official MLB statistic, they are increasingly visible in many box scores, including espn.com and MLB.com. Many fantasy baseball providers also include holds as an optional category that can be included in customized leagues.\nCareer leaders.\nThe career leaders are listed based on total holds according to MLB.com, which only records the statistic from 1999 onwards.\nBaseball statistics sites such as Baseball-Reference.com and The Baseball Cube credit holds to players in games played before 1999 based on the record of the game situation when the pitcher entered and left the game. However, the hold totals do not always agree from site to site, or with MLB.com from 1999 onward.\nThe following players who began their Major League careers before 1999 would be among the career leaders if MLB had recorded the statistic in games before the 1999 season. They are listed here with hold totals as calculated by Baseball-Reference.com.\n\"** as calculated by Baseball-reference.com to include years before 1999.\"\nSingle season record.\nThe single-season MLB record for holds is 41, established by Joel Peralta in 2013 pitching for the Tampa Bay Rays and equaled by Tony Watson in 2015 pitching for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

        "title": "Jack Walker (ice hockey)",
        "text": "John Phillip \"Jack\" Walker (November 29, 1888 – February 16, 1950) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who played for the Toronto Blueshirts, Seattle Metropolitans, Victoria Cougars, and Detroit Cougars. He played in all the big professional leagues at the time: the National Hockey Association (NHA), Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL), and National Hockey League (NHL).\nWalker won three Stanley Cups in his career: in 1914 with the Toronto Blueshirts, in 1917 with the Seattle Metropolitans, and in 1925 with the Victoria Cougars. Goaltender Harry \"Hap\" Holmes and forward Frank Foyston were his teammates on all three Stanley Cup winning teams. Walker is one of only 11 players in Stanley Cup history to win the Cup with three or more different teams.\nOutside of his three Stanley Cup victories Walker also appeared in four other instances where his team played for the Stanley Cup, either in challenge games or in Stanley Cup series: in 1911 with Port Arthur Lake City, in 1919 and 1920 with the Seattle Metropolitans, and in 1926 with the Victoria Cougars. In 1911, 1920 and 1926 he was on the losing side of either the challenge game or the series, and in 1919 the Stanley Cup series between the Seattle Metropolitans and the Montreal Canadiens was cancelled because of the Spanish flu pandemic.\nBiography.\nPort Arthur.\nBorn in Silver Mountain, Ontario Walker grew up in Port Arthur, Ontario (present day Thunder Bay), where his parents had lived since 1870. He played with the Port Arthur Lake City team in the New Ontario Hockey League (NOHL) from 1907–1912. On March 16, 1911, he and teammate Eddie Carpenter played for the Port Arthur Hockey Club against the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey Association (NHA) for the Stanley Cup. Carpenter and Walker each scored a goal, but the Port Arthur team lost 4-13 in front of 3,000 spectators at the Laurier Avenue Arena in Ottawa.\nImpressed by Walker's play in the Stanley Cup challenge game the Ottawa Senators tried to land him for the 1911–12 season, but Walker declined the offer as he thought Port Arthur had a strong enough team to again compete for the Stanley Cup. For the 1911–12 season future Hockey Hall of Fame members Harry Cameron and Frank Nighbor joined the Port Arthur team from Pembroke, Ontario, but after the team defeated the Saskatoon Wholesalers 12-6 (11-1, 1-5) in a qualifying two-game series on March 2 and 4, 1912 for a chance to challenge the National Hockey Association champions (Quebec Bulldogs) for the Stanley Cup, Port Arthur nonetheless turned down the opportunity because they felt they had practically no chance to defeat the NHA champions.\nToronto Blueshirts.\nDuring the 1912–13 season, Walker and Eddie Carpenter played for the Moncton Victorias of the Maritime Professional Hockey League (MaPHL), and Walker also played one initial game with the Toronto Blueshirts of the NHA. Walker had first signed a contract with the Toronto club for the 1912–13 NHA season, but jumped contract to Moncton along with Fred Doherty after only one game in the NHA for a higher salary in the Maritimes. In 1913–14 Walker became a full time member of the Toronto Blueshirts.\nBack in Toronto Walker helped the 1913–14 Toronto Blueshirts win the Stanley Cup by defeating the Montreal Canadiens. The two teams tied each other for first place in the NHA, and Toronto won the deciding playoffs 6-2 (0-2, 6-0) over two games on March 7 and 11. The Blueshirts then defeated the Victoria Aristocrats, champions of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), in three straight games 5-2, 6-5 and 2-1 between March 14 to 19.\nWalker played with the Toronto Blueshirts also in 1914–15, but prior to the 1915–16 season Lester and Frank Patrick, the men behind the PCHA, took advantage of a turbulent situation in the NHA when Major Frank Robinson, owner of the Blueshirts, was about to sell his team to join the military. The Patricks raided the Blueshirts and created a new PCHA team in the Seattle Metropolitans, stocking it with Walker, Eddie Carpenter, Harry \"Hap\" Holmes, Frank Foyston and Carol \"Cully\" Wilson.\nSeattle Metropolitans.\nIn his second season with the Metropolitans, in 1916–17, Walker helped the American team to a first place finish in the PCHA, in front of the Vancouver Millionaires, Portland Rosebuds and Spokane Canaries. In the following Stanley Cup finals the Metropolitans defeated the Montreal Canadiens of the NHA 3 games to 1 to claim the Stanley Cup, making it the first time an American team had won the coveted trophy.\nWorld War I had a big impact on the game, and prior to the 1917–18 season Walker and Eddie Carpenter were stuck in Port Arthur working on a dry dock. They had been given exemption from the war on the condition that they continued with their employment in the city, which held them out from rejoining the Metropolitans in the PCHA. Walker and Carpenter instead played with different Port Arthur teams in the NOHL.\nBack in the PCHA for the 1918–19 season Walker again helped the Metropolitans reach the Stanley Cup finals, a rematch against the Montreal Canadiens from two seasons prior. The 1919 series was a more even affair than the 1917 series but had to be cancelled with the teams tied at 2-2 in the best-of-five format due to the Spanish flu pandemic when several players on the Canadiens ended up sick in hospital. Joe Hall, a Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman on the Canadiens team, subsequently died of pneumonia, related to his influenza, in a hospital in Seattle on April 5, only four days after the series had been cancelled.\nIn 1919–20 Walker again helped the Metropolitans to the Stanley Cup finals, this time against the Ottawa Senators. The Senators, led offensively by Frank Nighbor, Walker's old teammate from Port Arthur during the 1911–12 season, won the series 3 games to 2 after a 6-1 decision in game five on April 1, 1920.\nVictoria Cougars.\nWalker played four more seasons with the Metropolitans, but when the team folded after the 1923–24 season Walker, along with his longtime teammates Hap Holmes and Frank Foyston, joined the Victoria Cougars in the Western Canada Hockey League for the 1924–25 season. The Cougars, led offensively by their Icelandic-Canadian star forward Frank Fredrickson, only finished third in the 1924–25 WCHL standings, but they succeeded in winning the following league playoffs (defeating both the Saskatoon Crescents and the Calgary Tigers) which gave them the opportunity to play NHL champion Montreal Canadiens for the Stanley Cup. Walker, who had a modest regular season offensively speaking with the Cougars, turned it on for the playoffs, scoring 4 goals during the WCHL playoffs and 4 goals in the Stanley Cup finals, helping the Cougars defeat the Canadiens 3 games to 1 while being matched against the Canadiens young star forward Howie Morenz. The 1925 Victoria Cougars were the last non-NHL team to win the Stanley Cup.\nIn 1926 the team was back in the Stanley Cup finals after winning the WHL playoffs, but the Montreal Maroons of the NHL were too difficult to overcome, winning the series 3 games to 1, with Montreal goaltender Clint Benedict recording three shutouts in the series.\nLater life.\nWhen the WHL folded after the 1925–26 season Walker moved along with the Victoria Cougars to Detroit and the NHL where the team became the Detroit Cougars. Walker, then aged 37, played two seasons with the Detroit Cougars in the NHL before he headed back to Seattle where he played three seasons with the Seattle Eskimos of the Pacific Coast Hockey League. During the 1931–32 and 1932–33 seasons Walker was a playing manager for the Hollywood Stars and the Oakland Sheiks respectively in the California Hockey League, a league where several other old PCHA stars such as Moose Johnson, Lloyd Cook and Fred \"Smokey\" Harris also played during their twilight years.\nAfter his playing career Walker stayed on the West Coast where he was active as an ice hockey coach. He finally settled down in Seattle where he died on February 16, 1950, at the age of 61.\nHe was inducted posthumously into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1960.\nPlaying style.\nDuring his hockey career Walker played mostly as a rover (the archaic seven man game forward position between defense and the centre forward) or, in the six man game against opponents from the NHA, as a winger. He was a good stick-handler and had much speed, something which both the \"Ottawa Journal\" and the \"Ottawa Citizen\" complimented him on after the Port Arthur Lake City aggregation played the Ottawa Senators for the Stanley Cup on March 16, 1911.\nWalker was a prominent two-way player who could make a difference at both ends of the rink, and he is often credited with introducing the hook check (a defensive technique in which the player sweeps or hooks his stick low to the ice in an effort to remove the puck from an opponent's stick) to the game of hockey. Walker's forward teammate on the 1911–12 Port Arthur Lake City team Frank Nighbor was another defensive specialist during the same era who excelled at both the poke check and the sweep check. In a 1960 interview with Bill Westwick of the \"Ottawa Journal\", Nighbor claimed he had learned his famous poke checking technique by watching Walker while the two players were teammates in Port Arthur.\nOne instance in which Walker used his hook check with great success was during the 1917 Stanley Cup Finals against the Montreal Canadiens. The Canadiens had won the first game of the best-of-five series 8 goals to 4, but in game two Walker used his hook check effectively on Didier Pitre, one of the star forwards on the Montreal team who had scored four goals in the first game, helping his team hold the Canadiens to only one goal in a 6–1 victory. The Seattle Metropolitans then won game three 4-1 and game four 9-1, becoming the first American team in history to win the Stanley Cup.\nWhether or not Walker came up with his hook checking technique by himself, or if he drew inspiration from contemporary players, is disputed. Both Joel Rochon and William \"Bud\" Saurel, two players from Fort William whom Walker played against in the NOHL, claimed to have originated the check. Rochon's claim was echoed by Fort William native Hockey Hall of Fame member Jack Adams who claimed Frank Nighbor must have learned his poke check after having played against Rochon and Fort William in the NOHL, something Nighbor himself denied. Harry Scott, a teammate of Walker with the 1912–13 Moncton Victorias and an opponent of him in the NOHL between 1907–1911, claimed that it was \"Bud\" Saurel who had taught Walker the check.\nIn an era that was known for a lot of on-ice violence Walker was known as a clean and gentlemanly player, which reflected not only in a comparatively low amount of penalty minutes but also in a comparatively low amount of serious injuries. One serious injury he did suffer happened during the 1921–22 season when he was hit over his already injured left hand in a game in Victoria on February 10 and blood-poisoning set in to the wound. He was taken to General Hospital in Vancouver where on February 13 he was operated on, and he later came back and finished the season.\nLester Patrick, the hockey mogul behind the PCHA and later a two-time Stanley Cup winning coach with the New York Rangers, had high praise for Walker, calling him \"one of the greatest players who ever lived\" in a 1950 \"Maclean's\" magazine interview, but he also stated that in comparison with contemporary players like Cyclone Taylor, Frank Nighbor, Howie Morenz, Eddie Shore, Moose Johnson, Ching Johnson and Frank Fredrickson, Walker, much like his Seattle Metropolitans teammate Frank Foyston, \"lacked color\" and \"no matter how brilliant he was, he didn't bring the crowd to their feet.\""

        "title": "Marty Walsh (ice hockey, born 1884)",
        "text": "Martin Joseph Walsh (October 16, 1884 – March 27, 1915) was a Canadian amateur, later professional, ice hockey player. Walsh played for the Ottawa Senators, winning three Stanley Cups in 1909, 1910 and 1911 and is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. He retired from ice hockey in 1912 and moved west to Edmonton to work. In 1914, Walsh contracted tuberculosis, succumbing to the disease in March 1915.\nEarly life.\nWalsh was born in Kingston, Ontario, the son of Michael and Catherine Walsh. Martin had an older sister Loretta and an older brother William. Walsh played junior hockey for the local Kingston Frontenacs. At seventeen, Walsh entered Queen's University.\nWalsh played hockey for the Queen's senior hockey team from 1902–1906, where he was a teammate of George Richardson, and the team won the intercollegiate title in 1904 and 1906. The 1906 squad challenged for the Stanley Cup in 1906 against the Ottawa Senators. Walsh scored four goals in the two games of the series which was won by Ottawa. Walsh also played rugby football for Queen's, and was a member of their 1905 intercollegiate championship team.\nProfessional career.\nWalsh turned professional for the 1906–07 season with the Canadian Soo of the International Professional Hockey League (IPHL), playing only seven games due to a fractured left ankle.\nWalsh was sought after by several clubs, including the Montreal Shamrocks and Montreal Wanderers, but he decided to sign with Ottawa. He joined the Ottawa Hockey Club in 1907 and played for the club for five seasons, winning Stanley Cups in 1909, 1910 and 1911. He was a high-scoring forward and in 1909, Marty scored 42 goals in 12 games, and in his career playoffs, he averaged over three points per game, an extraordinary feat. \nWhen the National Hockey Association was formed late in 1909, Renfrew attempted to sign Ottawa's star players including Walsh, but Walsh re-signed with Ottawa. When Walsh re-signed with Ottawa, players Fred Lake and Albert Kerr decided to turn down their Renfrew offers. Commenting on the financial aspects of the game in December 1909, Walsh stated that even though some player salaries could seem high-priced from an outside perspective, the game did not come without a sacrificial price of its own in the form of injuries:\nIn 1911, Walsh scored ten goals in a Stanley Cup challenge match against Port Arthur, second only to Frank McGee's 14 in one game. After the 1911 season, Bruce Stuart retired and Walsh was named captain of the team. Walsh played his last professional game with the Senators in 1912, finishing with 11 goals in 12 games for the 1911–12 season.\nWalsh was recognized for his talent in 1962 when he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nPlaying style.\nLike many other centre forwards during the earlier years of professional hockey, Marty Walsh had his strongest suit in close proximity to the opponent net, where he would often park himself for redirections or deflections. The Ottawa Citizen, in its January 26, 1911 issue, described a goal against the Montreal Canadiens on January 21 during the 1910–11 NHA season, where Walsh had positioned himself right in front of Georges Vézina for the game-winning goal in overtime, and the puck had caromed off of Walsh and into the net after first having left teammate Jack Darragh's stick. The newspaper pointed out that that was how Walsh got most of his goals, and that he usually wasn't a \"showy\" player.\nThe Ottawa Citizen from January 26, 1911 also pointed out that while Walsh couldn't skate like Cyclone Taylor, wasn't blessed with the beautiful foot work of Albert Kerr, and didn't show as spectacular as Bruce Ridpath, his absence was still dearly felt for the Ottawas when he was off the ice, and exemplified the claim with a 5-minute slashing penalty on Walsh during the January 21 game against the Montreal Canadiens, by which \"the Ottawa defence was demoralized, their attack seemed to melt to pieces, and before the Kingstonian's penalty had expired Canadiens had tied the score.\"\nWalsh's hovering around the opponent net earned him the nickname \"Stick-around\" Walsh from famous Montreal Victorias player Russell Bowie, but the January 26, 1911 issue of the Ottawa Citizen also claimed that \"Marty's checking back has re[s]cued the Ottawa defence from many a perilous position this winter. He is always there with the poke and jab when the rubber is dangerously near the peerless LeSueur.\"\nPost-career.\nIn 1912, Walsh left for Winnipeg with Dubbie Kerr to start a cattle ranch. Their plans changed when Kerr was lured out of retirement to play in the new Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). There were reports that the PCHA had signed Walsh as well, but he remained retired. In 1913, Walsh moved west to the Edmonton area, where he worked as a paymaster for the Grand Trunk Railway. While in Edmonton, he coached the Edmonton Eskimos team for two seasons. He guided the Eskimos to the 1913 Inter-City Hockey League title and an Allan Cup challenge.\nIn 1914, Walsh fell ill with tuberculosis. In February 1915, Walsh entered the Gravenhurst Sanitorium for treatment, but when admitted, the doctors estimated he had only a short time left to live. Walsh died on March 27, 1915. His remains were transported to Kingston for burial in St. Mary's Cemetery after a funeral at St. Mary's Cathedral. At his death, Walsh's only relative was his sister Loretta Keaney of Sudbury."

He was a member of the Toronto Granites team that won a gold medal for Canada in ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics. He was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962, and into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1998.\nEarly years.\nBorn in St. John's, Newfoundland, Watson also lived in England and Winnipeg, Manitoba before moving to Toronto at the age of 15. He played for the Whitby Athletics in the Ontario Hockey Association. He then played for St. Andrews College and was a first team all-star in 1915. Watson played for the Toronto Aura Lee before serving in the Canadian military during World War I.\nRoyal Flying Corps.\nHe enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps in 1917 and served in the First World War, becoming a fighter ace. He flew a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a to victory over an Albatros D.V on 25 January 1918, sharing the win with fellow Canadian Frank H. Taylor. By the time he scored his sixth and final win on 4 July, he had destroyed another enemy plane and sent four more down out of control.\nPlaying career.\nAfter the war, Watson joined the Toronto Dentals in a playoff series against the Hamilton Tigers, which the Tigers won. For the 1919–20 season, he joined the new Toronto Granites, the OHA team from the Toronto Granite Club. Led by Watson, the Granites won the Allan Cup in 1921–22 and 1922–23, with Watson named a first-team all-star in both seasons. They then represented Canada at the 1924 Winter Olympics, winning the ice hockey gold medal. At the Olympics, Watson scored 36 goals in five games as the Canadian team outscored the opposition 132-3 over six games. In one game against Switzerland, Watson scored 13 goals.\nHe turned down several lucrative offers to play professionally in the National Hockey League. Charlie Querrie, manager of the Toronto St. Patricks, offered Watson $10,000 to join his team for the 1924–25 season, but Watson declined. His Granites teammate Hooley Smith would have a 17-year NHL career, but Watson wanted to enter the business world and retired as a player in 1924.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1930, he became coach of the Toronto National Sea Fleas senior amateur team. During the 1931 playoff season, Watson refereed several OHA games. In December 1931, during his second season behind the bench for the Sea Fleas, Watson made a brief comeback as a player at the age of 33 after one of his players was unable to make a road trip. As coach, Watson guided the team to the Allan Cup in 1932.\nHonours.\nWatson was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962, and into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1998."

He was considered the top high school defenseman in Minnesota as a senior in 1977–78. He also attended the U.S. National Junior training camp in summer of 1978 and participated in the 1979 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships while playing at the University of Minnesota.\nRamsey was the youngest member of the U.S. team that upset the Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, in an event known as the Miracle on Ice. The American team, which went on to defeat Finland for the gold medal, was coached by Herb Brooks, who was Ramsey's coach at the University of Minnesota.\nProfessional.\nDrafted 11th overall by the Buffalo Sabres in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft, Ramsey would go on to play in the National Hockey League immediately after the Olympics. He had one of the most successful NHL careers of the 1980 U.S. Olympians, playing 14 seasons for the Sabres. Primarily known as an offensive defenseman as an amateur, he successfully adapted to the bigger and tougher NHL by becoming a stay-at-home defenseman in Buffalo. Highlights of his career with the Sabres include playing in the NHL All-Star Game four times (1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986) as well as being a member of the NHL All-Star team that played the Soviet national hockey team in Rendez-Vous '87. Ramsey also served as the Sabres' team captain from 1990 to 1992. He continued to play for Team USA during this time, participating in the 1982 Ice Hockey World Championships and the 1984 and 1987 Canada Cup tournaments.\nRamsey's old coach in Buffalo, Scotty Bowman, brought him to the Pittsburgh Penguins during the 1992–93 season to shore up the team's defensive corps as it made a run at a third straight Stanley Cup championship. However, the Penguins were upset in the second round by the New York Islanders. After another season in Pittsburgh, Ramsey signed with the Detroit Red Wings, who by now were also coached by Bowman, as a free agent. In April 1995, Ramsey became teammates with defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov when Detroit acquired the latter in a trade with the New Jersey Devils; Fetisov had played for the Soviets during the 1980 Olympics. That year, Ramsey played in his first Stanley Cup Finals series, but the Red Wings were swept by the Devils, who had Ramsey's 1980 Olympic teammate, Neal Broten, on their roster. The next season, the powerful Red Wings set a league record for most wins in a single season with 62, but were ousted in the Western Conference Finals by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche. Ramsey played only two games for Detroit in the 1996-97 season before retiring.\nPost-playing career.\nRamsey returned to Minnesota after finishing his NHL career where he ran a sporting goods store named \"Gold Medal Sports\" and played senior league hockey. He returned to the NHL in 1997 to serve as an assistant coach with the Buffalo Sabres, and in 2000 he took a similar position with the Minnesota Wild. He was with the Wild until June 2010.\nHe was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001.\nFamily.\nRamsey has three children: Hannah, Rachel and Jack. Hannah is a student at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. Rachel, who played hockey at Minnetonka High School, plays defense for the University of Minnesota.

        "title": "John Harrington (ice hockey)",
        "text": "John \"Bah\" Harrington (born May 24, 1957) is an American former ice hockey forward and is currently the head coach of the Minnesota State Mavericks women's ice hockey of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association.\nPlaying career.\nHarrington was a stand-out high school hockey athlete for Virginia High School in Minnesota's hockey-rich Iron Range under head coach Dave Hendrickson. After Harrington's senior season at Virginia, University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) assistant head coach Mike Sertich urged Harrington to try out for the hockey team. With Sertich's backing, Harrington won a walk-on spot on UMD's roster. He lettered for four seasons at UMD from 1975 to 1979.\nFollowing his collegiate playing career, Harrington was invited to try out for the 1979–80 US National team coached by the Minnesota Golden Gophers' Herb Brooks. Harrington made every cut and was placed on the Olympic roster for the 1980 Lake Placid games. The team went on to defeat the highly favored Soviet Union 4–3 in the first game of the Medal Round in an event named the \"Miracle on Ice\". The team defeated Finland 4–2 two days later to capture the Gold Medal for the US. Harrington is credited with an assist on Mike Eruzione's go-ahead game-winning goal against the USSR.\nUndrafted by the NHL, Harrington had a try-out with the Buffalo Sabres following the Olympics. The Sabres immediately assigned him to the Rochester Americans of the AHL, where he scored seven points in twelve games despite being a marked man. \"Some Canadian-born kids resent the fact that the Americans did so well in the Olympics and they're a bit jealous of them,\" claimed Buffalo defenseman Larry Playfair. In one game Harrington was struck in the face and needed six stitches to close a bloody gash on his chin. In another game against the Hershey Bears Harrington was attacked from behind by Lou Franceschetti and knocked unconscious for five minutes, lying in a pool of blood on the ice. He had to spend the night in a hospital with a concussion, fractured jaw, broken nose and four loosened teeth. Franceshetti was not penalized, insisting it was a \"clean\" check. \"My shoulder just connected with the back of his neck.\" \"If it was a clean check, how did I get it in the back of my head?\" asked Harrington. \"Lying in my hospital bed, I had all sorts of mixed emotions, especially when my teeth ached and my heart throbbed. I kept thinking of the cleaner game in Europe, that I could have gone to Switzerland to play hockey. Something like this can't help but discourage you. But this is the way it is in the pros and I'll make it one way or the other ... even if I have to face a few goofballs.\"\nHarrington played the 1980–81 season for Lugano in the Swiss league before returning to the US to play with the US National team from 1981–83 on a full-time basis. He was a member of the United States team at the 1981, 1982 and 1983 Ice Hockey World Championship tournaments. Between brief stints in the Central Hockey League, Harrington rejoined the national hockey team for the 1984 Winter Olympics.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing 1984, Harrington retired from playing and rejoined his college roots as an assistant coach under former Montreal Canadiens star Ralph Backstrom at the University of Denver. The highlight of Harrington's time at Denver was 1985-86 when Denver won a school record 34 games and advanced to the NCAA Frozen Four. In 1990 Harrington returned to Minnesota as an assistant coach for St. Cloud State University.\nFrom 1993-2008, Harrington was the head hockey coach at Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota. Harrington turned around a listless program at Saint John's. By his fourth season he had guided SJU to a school-record 26-6-1 mark, the school's first conference championship since 1950, the school's first conference playoff championship, the school's first NCAA tournament berth and an NCAA third-place victory. In 15 seasons at Saint John's he has a career record of 241-142-31 (.620). He has won five MIAC titles, four MIAC playoff championships and has advanced to the NCAA tournament five times. Harrington is the school leader in career wins. In addition to his coaching duties, Harrington was the assistant athletic director at Saint John's.\nIt was announced on March 31, 2008 that Harrington would step down as head coach at Saint John's to become head coach for HC Ambri-Piotta of the Swiss National League, his brief tenure lasting only until December 16. On January 19, 2009 Harrington signed a contract as head coach for Slovenia men's national ice hockey team, a position he held until December 12, 2010 when he was succeeded by Matjaž Kopitar. On May 11, 2009, Harrington signed a contract with HC Asiago, where he served as head coach until 2011.\nIn May 2015, after serving four years as an amateur scout for the NHL's Colorado Avalanche, Harrington was named the head coach of the Minnesota State Mavericks women's ice hockey of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA).\nIn the movies.\nAs part of the 1980 Olympic team, Harrington has been portrayed in movies twice, with the more recent being Disney's 2004 release \"Miracle\". Harrington is portrayed by Nate Miller, who played hockey at the University of Minnesota from 1997-2000.\nPrior to \"Miracle\", Harrington was portrayed by Bill Schreiner in the 1981 made-for-TV movie \"Miracle on Ice\".\nPersonal life.\nHarrington is married and has three children. He is the father of Chris Harrington, team captain and four-year letter winner on the Minnesota Golden Gopher hockey team from 2002–06 and currently a DEG Metro Stars defenseman.\n\"Bah\".\nAmong family, friends and those who knew him in his high school and college playing days, Harrington is known almost exclusively as \"Bah\". He earned the nickname from his older brother who was barely a year old when John was born. The brother couldn't enunciate the word baby and instead referred to his new sibling as \"bah.\" The name stuck. The rest of his siblings have nicknames too, including \"TP\", \"Tootie\", and \"Muggs.\""

        "title": "Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868",
        "text": "In 1868, a cricket team composed of Aboriginal Australians toured England between May and October of that year, being the first organised group of Australian sportspeople to travel overseas. It would be another ten years before an Australian cricket team classed as representative left the country.\nThe concept of an Aboriginal cricket team can be traced to pastoral stations in the Western District of Victoria, where, in the mid-1860s, the European owners introduced Aboriginal station hands to the sport. An Aboriginal XI was created with the assistance of Tom Wills, the captain of the Victorian cricket team and founder of Australian rules football, who acted as the side's captain-coach in the lead-up to and during an 1866–67 tour of Victoria and New South Wales. Several members of the team joined what became the Aboriginal XI that toured England under the captaincy of Englishman Charles Lawrence.\nInternational sporting contact was rare in that era. Previously, only three cricket teams had travelled abroad, all English, to the United States and Canada in 1859, and to Australia in 1861–62 and 1863–64.\nBackground.\nIn the Western District of Victoria, from the early 1860s onwards, cricket matches took place between Aboriginal Australians and European settlers at local pastoral properties, where many Aboriginal people were employed as station hands. The Aboriginal people were admired for their athletic skills and, in early 1866, a series of matches were staged with the intention of selecting the strongest possible Aboriginal XI. Thomas Gibson Hamilton of Bringalbert Station, near Edenhope, created a team which he coached. They played an exhibition match at Hamilton, which gained the attention of Tom Wills.\nThe resulting team was initially coached by local pastoralist William Hayman. Coaching duties were later turned over to Wills, captain of the Victoria cricket team and founder of Australian rules football, who spoke to the team in the Djab Wurrung language he had learnt as a child growing up in the Western District among the Djab Wurrung people. Wills' decision to join and help the team has been something of a puzzle given that, only five years earlier, he had survived the Cullin-la-ringo massacre in Queensland, in which his father and 18 other European colonists were murdered by local Aboriginal people. \"It was always a matter of wonder how Tom could be friendly with the blacks, considering that they murdered his father\", one sportswriter noted.\nOn Boxing Day 1866, in front of over 10,000 spectators, Wills captained the team against the Melbourne Cricket Club at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. \"Bell's Life in Victoria\" reported: \"Seldom has a match created more excitement in Melbourne than the one under notice, and never within our recollection has a match given rise to so much feeling on behalf of the spectators.\" \"The veteran Wills never captained an eleven who so thoroughly possessed the sympathies of the spectators,\" wrote a Melbourne correspondent for \"The Sydney Mail\". \"A dark skin suddenly became a passport to the good graces of Victorians.\" Although they lost to the MCC, the Aboriginal players were commended for their performance, and showed marked improvement on a subsequent tour of country Victoria.\nAn entrepreneur, Captain Gurnett, persuaded the team to travel to Sydney to begin a planned tour of the colonies and England. However, after their arrival in Sydney in February 1867, Gurnett embezzled some of the funds raised to finance the enterprise, leaving the team stranded. They were looked after by Charles Lawrence at his Manly Hotel, and he organised a number of games, completing a tour of New South Wales before returning to Victoria in May. Four players succumbed to the effects of illness: \"Sugar\" and \"Watty\" died on tour, while \"Jellico\" and \"Paddy\" died shortly afterward.\nTeam members.\nIn 1867, Charles Lawrence was contracted to captain-coach Australia's \"First Eleven\" that toured England in 1868. Lawrence played for Surrey in 1855, the all Ireland XI in 1862, and the all England XI in 1863. He was contracted to be the first professional cricket coach in New South Wales, and he first saw the indigenous team under the instructions of Tom Wills who played a match at the Albert Ground, Sydney. On this occasion there was some contract disagreement between the failed sponsor Gurnett and Wills, and the players were left in Sydney. Lawrence was instructed to look after the Aboriginal players. At this time Lawrence was a publican and billeted the players in his hotel in Manly until he could arrange some cricket matches to raise money to return the players to the Western District of Victoria. In 1867, he trained the players for two months at \"Lake Wallace\" in Edenhope in the Wimmera before selecting the below side to tour England in 1868.\nThe tour was financed by Sydney Lawyer George Graham. Along with his cousin George Smith (who had been Mayor of Sydney in 1859), and William Hayman, they all travelled to England for the tour.\nDuring June, \"King Cole\" died from tuberculosis and was buried in Victoria Park Cemetery in what is now Tower Hamlets in London. Sundown and Jim Crow went home in August due to ill-health.\nTour.\nThe team arrived in London on 13 May 1868 and were met with a degree of fascination – being the period of the evolutionary controversies following publication of Charles Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" in 1859. Reaction was mixed. \"The Times\" described the tourists as, \"a travestie upon cricketing at Lord's\", and, \"the conquered natives of a convict colony.\" \"The Daily Telegraph\" said of Australia that, \"nothing of interest comes from there except gold nuggets and black cricketers.\"\nThe first match was played on 25 May at The Oval in London, and attracted 20,000 spectators. Presumably many of the spectators attended out of curiosity, rather than merely to savour a cricket contest. \"The Times\" reported: \"Their hair and beards are long and wiry, their skins vary in shades of blackness, and most of them have broadly expanded nostrils. Having been brought up in the bush to agricultural pursuits under European settlers, they are perfectly civilised and are quite familiar with the English language.\"\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote: It is highly interesting and curious, to see mixed in a friendly game on the most historically Saxon part of our island, representatives of two races so far removed from each other as the modern Englishman and the Aboriginal Australian. Although several of them are native bushmen, and all are as black as night, these Indian fellows are to all intents and purposes, clothed and in their right minds.\nIn total, the Aboriginal team played 47 matches throughout England over a period of six months, winning 14, losing 14 and drawing 19, a good result that surprised many at the time. Their skills were said to range from individuals who were exceptional athletes down to two or three team members who hardly contributed at all. The outstanding player was Johnny Mullagh. He scored 1,698 runs and took 245 wickets. George Tarrant, an admired English fast bowler of the time, bowled to Mullagh during a lunch interval and later said, \"I have never bowled to a better batsman.\"\nIn addition to playing cricket, the Aboriginal players frequently put on exhibitions of boomerang and spear throwing at the conclusion of a match. Dick-a-Dick would also hold a narrow parrying shield and invite people to throw cricket balls at him, which he warded off with the shield. The Aboriginal team were narrowly beaten in a cricket-ball-throwing competition by an emerging English all-rounder of star quality, the 20-year-old W. G. Grace, who threw 118 yards.\nAftermath.\nThe team arrived back in Sydney in February 1869. They played a match against a military team the following month, then split up. Twopenny later moved to New South Wales and played for the colony against Victoria in 1870. Cuzens died of dysentery the following year. Mullagh was employed as a professional by the Melbourne Cricket Club and represented Victoria against the touring English team in 1879, top-scoring in the second innings.\nIn 1869 the Central Board for Aborigines ruled that it would be illegal to remove any Aboriginal person from the colony of Victoria without the approval of the government minister. That effectively curtailed the involvement of Aboriginal players in the game.\nWhen Mullagh died in August 1891, aged 50, he was generally believed to have been the last survivor of the team apart from Lawrence, who died in 1917. However, Red Cap is now believed to have died between 1891 and 1894, and Tarpot died in April 1900.\nLegacy.\nIn May 1988, a team of Aboriginal players, captained by John McGuire, toured England to mark the Australian Bicentenary, retracing the steps of the original tour. Ngadjuri man, Vince Copley, helped to organise the commemorative tour.\nIn 2002, Charles Lawrence's great-great-grandson, Ian Friend, along with historians and cricketers, including former Test captain Ian Chappell, successfully campaigned to have the Aboriginal XI recognised in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. Ian Friend and Jack Kennedy (descendant of Johnny Cuzens) both accepted the award on behalf of the team. Also that year, a documentary film about the team, titled \"A Fine Body of Gentlemen\", was broadcast by the ABC.\nAustralia sent men's and women's Aboriginal teams to England in June 2018, to mark the 150th anniversary of the tour.\nA play about the cricketers, \"Black Cockatoo\", written by Geoffrey Atherden and employing an all-Aboriginal cast, was staged at the 2020 Sydney Festival.\nIn January 2020, Len Pascoe encouraged singer/songwriter Matt Scullion to write a song about the tour, having been talking about it to Gamilaraay elder and retired cricketer Les Knox. Scullion wrote the song, \"1868\", and sang it at the second Twenty20 International at the Sydney Cricket Ground in early 2021, and planned to do so again at the Bradman Museum in April 2021."

        "title": "2005 Pro Bowl",
        "text": "The 2005 Pro Bowl was the NFL's all-star game for the 2004 season. The game was played February 13, 2005, at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii. The final score was AFC 38 – NFC 27. The most valuable player was Peyton Manning of the Colts. The game holds the record as the latest Pro Bowl played during the calendar year, and formerly the latest NFL game; this record was subsequently tied when Super Bowl LVI was played on February 13, 2022.\nGame summary.\nThe game started off slowly. The AFC was forced to punt away its first possession, and the NFC missed a field goal from 43 yards out. Two plays later, the AFC opened up scoring with a 62-yard pass from Peyton Manning to his Indianapolis Colts teammate, Marvin Harrison. The NFC drove back quickly, but Donovan McNabb's pass was intercepted by Joey Porter. Manning then hooked up with Hines Ward for a 41-yard score, and the AFC led 14–0. The NFC came back with a time consuming drive that spanned the end of the first quarter to the beginning of the second, and ended with a 12-yard run by Brian Westbrook to bring the NFC within 7. However, David Akers' attempted onside kick would prove costly, as Ward recovered the kick and returned it 39 yards for a score, the first ever kickoff return for a touchdown in Pro Bowl history. Daunte Culpepper attempted to bring the NFC back, but was intercepted by Takeo Spikes. That interception led to another Manning touchdown, this time a 12-yard pass to Antonio Gates which gave the AFC a comfortable 28–7 lead. The NFC once again came down the field, led by Culpepper, but the drive was not without problems. On the second play, Torry Holt caught a pass but was hit by Tory James, causing a fumble. John Lynch recovered the fumble for the AFC, but the play was negated after a penalty on Marcus Stroud. Akers ended up kicking a 33-yard field goal to bring the score to 28–10, which is how the first half ended.\nThe third quarter was all NFC, who started off the half by scoring within the first 3 minutes, when Michael Vick hit Holt with a 27-yard pass to make the score 28–17. They later picked off Tom Brady when Lito Sheppard intercepted a pass on the NFC 31. The drive ended when Vick ran it in from 3 yards out, making the score 28–24. Adam Vinatieri and Akers then traded field goals before LaDainian Tomlinson added a rushing touchdown to make the score 38–27. The NFC made one final drive late in the game, but Vick was intercepted (the third pick of the game for the AFC) by Nate Clements, and Drew Brees kneeled to end the game. Manning, whose 3 passing TDs led the AFC's offense, won the Most Valuable Player award while Vick was called the greatest of all time by the announcers.\nAFC roster.\nOffense.\n\"Source\"\nSpecial teams.\n\"Source\"\nNFC roster.\nSpecial teams.\n\"Source\"\nNotes:"

        "title": "Brian Burke (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Brian P. Burke (born June 30, 1955) is an American-Canadian ice hockey executive, currently the Executive Director of the Professional Women's Hockey League Players Association (PWHLPA). He previously worked in the NHL league office, including as the director of hockey operations, and worked as general manager of the Hartford Whalers, Vancouver Canucks, Anaheim Ducks—with whom he won the Stanley Cup in 2007—and Toronto Maple Leafs, as well as president of hockey operations for the Leafs, Calgary Flames, and Pittsburgh Penguins. Burke was general manager for the silver-medalist United States national team for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. He is a member of Rugby Canada's board of directors. Burke was inducted into the Rhode Island Hockey Hall of Fame in 2019.\nEarly life and playing career.\nBorn in Providence, Rhode Island, and raised in Edina, Minnesota, in a family of ten children. Burke graduated from Edina High School followed by Providence College in 1977 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. While attending Providence, he played for the Friars Division-I ice hockey team, where, during his senior year, he served as captain under coach Lou Lamoriello. He was also a teammate of Ron Wilson's there.\nIn 1977, Burke played seven games with the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League (AHL). He then signed with the Philadelphia Flyers in the off-season and proceeded to play one full year in the AHL with the Maine Mariners, winning a Calder Cup championship that year. After one year in the AHL, Burke attended Harvard Law School, where he graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1981. After graduating, Burke became an NHL player agent.\nExecutive career.\nEarly career.\nIn 1987, he was hired by Pat Quinn to be the director of hockey operations for the Vancouver Canucks. In the 1992–93 season, he left that job to become general manager of the Hartford Whalers. Burke stepped down after one year in Hartford, so he could join the NHL front office as executive vice president and director of hockey operations, under league commissioner Gary Bettman. In that role, he served as the league's chief disciplinarian.\nVancouver Canucks.\nIn 1998, he became general manager of the Vancouver Canucks. With the Canucks, he was credited with reviving the ailing franchise and increasing attendance, with the drafting and signing of several key players such as Daniel Sedin, Henrik Sedin and Ryan Kesler, as the team won a playoff series and captured a division title. Following the 2003–04 NHL season, Canucks ownership chose not to renew Burke's contract for the GM position. Burke then briefly worked as an analyst for NHL games on both CBC and TSN. Burke's total record with the Canucks was 219-181-68-24.\nCriticism.\nBrian Burke faced public criticism for his treatment of forward Peter Zezel. Zezel had requested he be traded to an East Coast team in order to be closer to Toronto where he could see and spend more time with his 5-year old niece who had terminal cancer. Instead, Burke sent Zezel out to the Anaheim Ducks, the NHL city furthest away from Toronto. As a result, Zezel retired from the NHL. Only after public and media outcry did Burke decide to buy out Zezel's contract.\nAnaheim Ducks.\nAs the 2004-05 NHL Lockout was coming to a close, Burke was announced as the next GM of the Anaheim Ducks. In his first year with the club, the Ducks made it all the way to the third round before falling to the Edmonton Oilers in the Western Conference Final. The following year, Burke won the Stanley Cup with the Anaheim Ducks in the 2006–07 NHL season. Burke stepped down as GM of the Anaheim Ducks on November 12, 2008. The Ducks management submitted papers to the NHL, releasing him from contractual commitment.\nToronto Maple Leafs.\nOn November 29, 2008, Burke was introduced as the president and general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, replacing interim general manager Cliff Fletcher. He became the 13th non-interim general manager of the club and the first to be American-born. He reportedly agreed to a six-year deal worth $3 million annually. Soon thereafter, on December 4, 2008, Burke offered Dave Nonis the position of senior vice president and director of hockey operations for the Maple Leafs; Nonis accepted, marking the third time he has held this post under Burke; he had done so previously in Anaheim and Vancouver.\nBurke attended the World Hockey Summit hosted in Toronto in 2010, and wanted NHL participation in the Winter Olympics to continue, but felt that teams should receive financial compensation while the NHL season was on hiatus during the Olympics. He proposed allowing the NHL oversee a world championship which had potential to a financially lucrative venture while league games were not being played.\nOn January 9, 2013, Burke was fired by the Leafs as president and general manager and given a role as senior advisor to MLSE's president and C.O.O. Tom Anselmi and the MLSE board of directors. The advisory role would not relate to hockey matters. Burke was fired principally by team director George A. Cope, who campaigned for the team's new ownership to make a change in team leadership. During Burke's tenure with the Leafs from November 2008 to January 2013, the team consistently failed to make the post-season and remained the only team in the League unable to do so following the 2004 lockout. With the Leafs, Burke amassed a record of 129-135-42.\nCriticism.\nDuring his time in Toronto, Burke was notably criticized for a controversial trade in 2009 with Boston, when he acquired sniper Phil Kessel for two first-round draft picks and a second-round selection. The Bruins used the picks to select star forward Tyler Seguin, Dougie Hamilton and Jared Knight.\nIn December 2011, Burke drew criticism in the media for his mid-season extension of head coach Ron Wilson, a longtime friend. \"Burke and Wilson were born a month apart, were college roommates and teammates on the Providence College Friars hockey team in Rhode Island in the 1970s and have been friends ever since. Despite Wilson's three consecutive losing seasons, Burke renewed Wilson's contract with a $2 million extension. News of the contract broke on social media site Twitter, where Wilson posted that \"This Xmas could be better if Santa stuffs a certain piece of paper in my stocking\" and \"'He came! He came!' [...] I got a new Red Ryder BB gun and a contract extension!\", to which Burke replied, \"Congratulations to Ron Wilson on his contract extension! Merry Christmas Ron!\" Later, Burke defended his decision in the media, stating \"This is a coach who's earned this, a coach who's earned this extension,\" and \"It's not charity. It's not a gift.\" However, Wilson was released with full pay three months later following mounting losses and jeers from fans. \"Every coach has a shelf life,\" Burke said. \"After the last home game, it would be cruel and unusual punishment to let Ron coach another game in the Air Canada Centre.\"\nCalgary Flames.\nOn September 5, 2013, Burke was named the president of hockey operations for the Calgary Flames. After firing Jay Feaster and John Weisbrod, Burke assumed the role of acting general manager during the search for a permanent GM. On April 28, 2014, Burke hired Brad Treliving as the GM of the Calgary Flames.\nAfter nearly five years on the job, Burke stepped back from his role as president of the Flames' hockey operations on April 27, 2018. \nPittsburgh Penguins.\nOn February 9, 2021, Burke was hired as the President of Hockey Operations for the Pittsburgh Penguins. On April 14, 2023, the Penguins announced that they had fired Burke after missing the playoffs for the first time since 2005–06, ending a 16 year playoff appearance streak for the organization.\nPWHLPA.\nOn August 29, 2023, Burke was named as the Executive Director of the Professional Women’s Hockey League Players Association, the player union for the newly formed Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL). At the inaugural PWHL draft on September 18, Burke stated it was \"the biggest day in the history of women's hockey\", and he went on to explain his optimism about the new league: \"For the first time, we've got one united league. Properly funded, properly staffed, properly backed up. It's the best chance women have had.\"\nBroadcasting career.\nFollowing his departure from the Calgary Flames, Burke joined Rogers Media as an ice hockey analyst during the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs in April 2018. He worked as a hockey analyst with Sportsnet and on \"Hockey Night in Canada\" until his hiring by the Pittsburgh Penguins in February 2021.\nIn October 2020, Burke in collaboration with Stephen Brunt released a memoir about Burke's life entitled “Burke’s Law”.\nPersonal life.\nBurke is of Irish descent through both parents, with roots in County Roscommon and County Mayo. A dual citizen of the United States and Canada, Burke has two daughters with ex-wife Jennifer Mather Burke, an anchor at CTV News Channel. One of his daughters Katie was married to baseball executive Jared Porter until 2014.\nBurke also has four children from a previous marriage, including Patrick, a former scout for the Philadelphia Flyers and as of 2015 a director in the NHL's Department of Player Safety. Burke is a strong supporter of gay rights and attended the 2009 Toronto Gay Pride Parade with his son Brendan Burke, who was gay.\nOn February 5, 2010, Brendan died at age 21 from injuries suffered in a car accident in Indiana.\nBrian Burke also participated in the 2010 and 2011 Toronto Gay Pride parades. On March 4, 2012, Burke and his son Patrick launched the You Can Play project in honor of Brendan, which is targeted at ending homophobia in sports.\nDefamation lawsuit filed against anonymous posters.\nOn April 26, 2013, Burke filed a lawsuit against 18 individuals who had anonymously posted on websites that the actual reason Burke was fired from the Maple Leafs was for allegedly having an affair with a female sportscaster and fathering her child. Burke said the claims were false and defamatory. He sued to seek court orders disclosing the names of those who posted the accusations.\nBurke was able to achieve a minor victory in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which ruled that anonymous defendants could be served notice of the proceedings through the private messaging on the message boards they had used to make the statements about Burke. , Burke and his legal team had tracked down the identities of several of the individuals and forced them to make retractions."

        "text": "James Bradley Mills (born January 19, 1957) is an American professional baseball player, coach, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as an infielder for the Montreal Expos from 1980 to 1983. He managed the Houston Astros from 2010 to 2012, and served as a coach in MLB for the Expos, Philadelphia Phillies, Boston Red Sox, and Cleveland Indians.\nEarly life.\nMills was educated at Exeter Union High School in Exeter, California, College of the Sequoias, and the University of Arizona, where he played college baseball for the Arizona Wildcats. He was drafted in the 17th round by the Montreal Expos.\nBaseball career.\nPlaying career.\nMills reached the major leagues in 1980 and had a .256 batting average with one home run and 12 runs batted in in 106 games played for the Expos (1980–83). He divided his time between Triple-A and the majors in each of those seasons, and sustained a right knee injury that ended his playing career at the age of 29. A full-time left-handed hitter and primarily a third baseman, he also saw time at first base and second base. In 1983, Mills was Nolan Ryan's 3,509th career strikeout victim, lifting Ryan past Walter Johnson as the all-time strikeout leader.\nPost-playing career.\nMills managed eleven seasons in the minors in the Cubs, Rockies and Dodgers organizations (1987–2002), and also served as an advance scout for the Cubs. Mills was Terry Francona's first-base coach with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1997–2000. In 2003, Mills served as the Montreal Expos bench coach. From 2004 to 2009, Mills was teamed again with Francona when he served as the bench coach for the Boston Red Sox.\nHouston Astros Manager.\nOn October 27, 2009, Mills was named manager of the Houston Astros, replacing interim manager Dave Clark; he was hired after Manny Acta declined (he elected to manage the Cleveland Indians).\nMills holds the dubious distinction of guiding the Astros to the franchise's first ever 100-loss season, which he did in 2011, the trend continued the following season. Mills was at the forefront of a team that saw former stars traded away from the team such as Lance Berkman and Carlos Lee that slashed payroll under $30 million. By the summer of 2012, rumors spread of a potential firing of Mills, whose team never rose above .500 after April. The team had new ownership during the year as Jim Crane purchased the team from previous owner Drayton McLane the previous fall. Mills was fired on August 18, 2012 along with hitting coach Mike Barnett and first base coach Bobby Meacham. He was succeeded on an interim basis by Oklahoma City RedHawks manager Tony DeFrancesco, as named by first-year general manager Jeff Luhnow. For his part, Mills stated that some of the responsibility was on his part for how the team did, not wanting to point the finger at anybody. The team would go on to finish the season with 100+ losses for the second consecutive year.\nCleveland Indians.\nOn October 31, 2012, Mills was hired as the third base coach of the Cleveland Indians, to work with Francona again. Mills was reassigned as the Indians bench coach in 2014. While coaching for the Boston Red Sox under Francona from 2004 to 2009 he was in the same position. On July 11, 2017, Mills managed the American League All-Star team while Francona dealt with a health issue.\nOn July 5, 2020, Mills announced he would be opting out of the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Indians subsequently announced on October 30, 2020 that Mills will not return as bench coach for the 2021 season, but would remain with the club in an undetermined role.\nManagerial record.\nNote: Interim while Terry Francona is out with issue\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "text": "David William Wallace (born September 7, 1947) is an American former professional baseball pitcher, pitching coach and front-office executive. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays. After his playing career he was a pitching coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Boston Red Sox, Houston Astros and Baltimore Orioles.\nPlaying career.\nAn all-around athlete at Sacred Heart High School of Waterbury, Connecticut, Wallace played baseball, basketball and football. Wallace had a Hall of Fame collegiate career at the University of New Haven, where he went 24–7 with a 2.18 earned run average and 311 strikeouts in his four-year career. He signed with the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent in 1970. A right-handed relief pitcher, Wallace posted a 47–31 record with 60 saves in 355 career minor league outings. In the Majors, he made 13 appearances for the Phillies (1973–74) and Toronto Blue Jays (1978) and went 0–1 with 12 strikeouts and a 7.84 ERA in 20 innings. He concluded his playing career with Triple-A Pawtucket (1979).\nCoaching career.\nAfter his retirement as a player, Wallace became a pitching coach in the Dodgers' organization for Class A Vero Beach (1981–82), Double-A San Antonio (1983) and Triple-A Albuquerque (1984–86). He also managed San Antonio for part of the 1983 season and put himself into four games as a pitcher in both 1984 and 1986 with the Dukes. He was then the Dodgers' minor league pitching coordinator from 1987 to 1994 until he replaced Ron Perranoski as the Dodgers' Major League pitching coach in 1995.\nAs a coach, Wallace is credited with helping develop the talents of pitchers Pedro Martínez, Ramón Martínez, Pedro Astacio, Darren Dreifort, Hideo Nomo, Chan Ho Park, Ismael Valdéz and John Wetteland. He was also credited by Orel Hershiser for his early success with the Dodgers in a \"Sports Illustrated\" article.\nWallace left the Dodgers after the 1998 season and became the pitching coach of the New York Mets from 1999 to 2000, under Bobby Valentine, including New York's 2000 National League championship club. But he and Valentine did not have a close working relationship, and Wallace resigned after the 2000 World Series to rejoin the Dodgers as senior vice president, baseball operations. He then served as an interim general manager of the Dodgers in 2001 after Kevin Malone was forced to resign at midseason.\nWallace left the Dodger front office to become the pitching coach for the Boston Red Sox on June 10, 2003, replacing Tony Cloninger, who at the time was (successfully) battling bladder cancer. Wallace then won a World Series ring with the Red Sox in 2004.\nIn February 2006, while driving to spring training, Wallace was hospitalized in Spartanburg, South Carolina, with intense pain in his right hip. Twelve years after having hip replacement surgery, Wallace discovered he was suffering from a severe infection in the replaced joint. He nearly died from the infection, and underwent immediate surgery. He had a second replacement surgery in June and was able to resume his duties with the Red Sox on August 8, 2006, through the end of the season, when he resigned.\nWallace was hired as the new pitching coach by the Houston Astros in 2007, but left that job in October 2007 when he was hired by the Seattle Mariners organization as a special assistant to the general manager. On January 13, 2009, he was named the Mariners minor league pitching coordinator. After completing the 2009 season in this position, Wallace was hired by the Atlanta Braves to serve in the same capacity for them. He briefly filled in as the Braves pitching coach in 2011 while Roger McDowell was on suspension.\nIn November 2013, he was named as the Baltimore Orioles pitching coach replacing interim coach Bill Castro. Wallace's retirement from the Orioles was announced at a press conference on October 6, 2016, however, Wallace immediately rejoined the Braves as a pitching consultant.\nIn April 2021, Wallace was named as a coach for the United States national baseball team, for the team's final efforts to qualify for baseball at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2021. The team qualified, with Wallace serving as the team's pitching coach for the Olympics. The team went on to win silver, falling to Japan in the gold-medal game.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League)\n \n \n "

        "title": "2006 FIFA World Cup qualification",
        "text": "The 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification competition was a series of tournaments organised by the six FIFA confederations. Each confederation – the AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), CONCACAF (North, Central America and Caribbean), CONMEBOL (South America), OFC (Oceania), and UEFA (Europe) – was allocated a certain number of the 32 places at the tournament. A total of 197 teams entered the qualification process for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In 2001 FIFA ended automatic qualification of the reigning champion, so that 2002 champions Brazil became first to participate in the qualifying tournament. The hosts (Germany) retained their automatic spot. \nThe original distribution of places between the six confederations called for Oceania to be given one full spot in the final 32; this idea was seen as virtually guaranteeing a place in the finals to Australia, by far the strongest footballing nation in the region. This decision was reconsidered in June 2003 and the previous distribution of places between Oceania and South America was restored.\nThe draw for five of the six qualification tournaments took place on 5 December 2003 in Frankfurt, whilst all of the members of the South American federation (CONMEBOL) competed in a single group. Qualification itself began in September 2003.\nQualified teams.\nThe following 32 teams qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup:\n1Includes 10 appearances by \"DFB\" representing West Germany between 1954 and 1990. Excludes 1 appearance by \"DVF\" representing East Germany between 1954 and 1990.\n3Includes appearances by pre-division Yugoslavia, as FIFA considers Serbia and Montenegro as a successor of a team.\n4Includes appearances by Czechoslovakia, as FIFA considers Czech Republic as a successor of a team.\nQualification process.\nA total of 197 teams entered the qualification process for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, competing for a total of 32 spots in the final tournament. Germany, as the host, qualified automatically, leaving 31 spots open for competition. \nStarting with these qualifiers, the defending champion (Brazil) was not granted automatic qualification for the first time. FIFA announced the decision in December 2001 at the draw for the 2002 Finals Tournament. The official reason was that the friendly matches to which previous champions were restricted provided inferior preparation to the competitive qualification matches others would have played. Media also noted that the change released an extra place for the contentious distribution of places by confederation.\nThe final distribution was as follows:\nThe distribution by confederation for the 2006 FIFA World Cup was:\nUEFA and CAF have a guaranteed number of places, whereas the number of qualifiers from other confederations is dependent on play-offs between AFC's fifth-placed team and CONMEBOL's fifth-placed team, and between CONCACAF's fourth-placed team and OFC's first-placed team. A draw determined the pairings between the four teams involved.\nTiebreakers.\nFor FIFA World Cup qualifying stages using a league format, the method used for separating teams level on points is the same for all Confederations. The rules for separating teams level on points are decided by FIFA and can be found in article 18 part 6d to 6g of the FIFA Regulations 2006 World Cup Germany\nIf teams are even on points at the end of group play, the tied teams will be ranked by:\nFor FIFA World Cup qualifying stages using a home-and-away knockout format, the team that has the higher aggregate score over the two legs progresses to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finish level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progresses. If away goals are also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time are played, divided into two fifteen-minutes halves. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team qualifies by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shoot-out.\nThis is a change from the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where total goal difference was the first tiebreaker.\nA total of 194 teams played at least one qualifying match. A total of 847 qualifying matches were played, and 2464 goals were scored (an average of 2.91 per match).\nConfederation qualification.\nAFC.\n44 Asian teams are affiliated with FIFA, but Cambodia, Philippines, Bhutan and Brunei decided not to take part, and Myanmar was banned from the competition, so a total of 39 teams took part, competing for 4.5 places in the World Cup.\nThe qualification was composed of three rounds. \nPlay-off for 5th place (fourth round).\n\"'Bahrain\" advanced to the AFC–CONCACAF play-off on the away goals rule.\nCAF.\nThe qualification was composed of two Rounds. 9 teams entered the competition directly on the second round: the 5 teams that qualified for the 2002 World Cup Finals (Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia) and the 4 highest-ranking teams in the June 25, 2003 FIFA world rankings (Congo DR, Ivory Coast, Egypt, and Morocco). The other 42 teams were paired 2-by-2 and played knock-out matches home-and-away. The 21 winners would advance to the second round.\nIn the second round, the 30 teams were divided in 5 groups of 6 teams each. Teams in each group would play against each other in a home-and-away basis. The team with most points in each group would qualify to the World Cup.\nThe competition also constituted the qualification competition for the 2006 African Nations Cup with the top three nations of each group qualifying (except for Egypt, which qualifies as the host nation, the fourth nation in Egypt's group qualifying in Egypt's place).\nThe African qualifying zone saw 4 out of 5 finals places going to World Cup debutants (Angola, Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana). Nigeria missed out on a fourth consecutive finals appearance while Cameroon did not reach their fifth consecutive finals.\nThe African zone also featured a group of death – Group 3 – which brought together Africa's most frequent World Cup qualifier Cameroon with the two eventual finalists of the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations: Egypt and the Ivory Coast.\nCONCACAF.\nThe qualification process was divided in three stages. In the first stage, the 34 teams were divided in 10 groups of three teams each and two groups of two teams each. Groups with three teams had two rounds, with the best ranked team according to FIFA in each group entering the competition in the second round. In each group, teams were paired 2-by-2 and played home-and-away matches.\nThe 12 winners of the first stage advanced to the second stage, where they were divided into three groups of four teams each. Teams in each group would play against each other home-and-away, and the two teams with most points in each group would advance to the final round.\nIn the third stage, the six teams were put in a single group, and played against each other home-and-away. The three teams with most points qualified to the World Cup. The fourth placed team advanced to the AFC–CONCACAF play-off against the winner of a play-off between third placed teams in the Third Round of Asia.\nCONMEBOL.\n10 teams took part, all in a single group. The rules were very simple: the teams would play against each other in a home-and-away basis, with the four teams with most points qualifying to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The fifth ranked team would have to play-off against the best team from Oceania, with the winner of this play-off also qualifying. For the first time, Brazil, the defending champion, was required to go through qualification and was not automatically qualified for the tournament.\nOFC.\n12 teams took part, competing for a place in the intercontinental play-off against the fifth-placed team from South America. The winner of this play-off qualified for the World Cup.\nFinal positions (second round).\nIn the Second round, the six teams were put in a single group, and played against each other once. The two teams with most points advanced to a play-off, and played against each other home and away. The winner of this play-off advanced to the intercontinental play-off.\nFinal round.\nAustralia and the Solomon Islands progressed to the final stage.\nUEFA.\nA total of 51 teams took part, divided in 8 groups (five groups of six teams each and three groups of seven teams each) competing for 13 places in the World Cup. Germany, the hosts, were already qualified, for a total of 14 European places in the tournament. The qualifying process started on 18 August 2004, over a month after the end of UEFA Euro 2004, and ended on 16 November 2005.\nThe teams in each group would play against each other in a home and away basis. The team with most points in each group would qualify to the World Cup. The runners up would be ranked. As some groups had seven teams and others had six, results against the seventh placed team were ignored. The two best ranked runners up would also qualify to the World Cup. The other six runners up were drawn into three home and away knock out matches, winners of those matches also qualifying.\nPlay-offs.\nPoland and Sweden qualified directly to the World Cup. The other teams had to play in the playoffs.\nA draw was held on 14 October 2005 at FIFA headquarters in Zürich to pair each team from Pot 1 with a team from Pot 2. A second draw at the same time and location determined the order of the fixtures.\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nThere were two scheduled inter-confederation playoffs to determine the final two qualification spots to the finals. The first legs were played on 12 November 2005, and the second legs were played on 16 November 2005.\nTop goalscorers.\nBelow are goalscorer lists for all confederations and the inter-confederation play-offs:"

        "title": "Bowling Green Assembly Plant",
        "text": "The Bowling Green Assembly Plant is a General Motors automobile factory in Bowling Green, Kentucky. It is a specialized plant assembling GM's Y-body sports cars, the Chevrolet Corvette and formerly the Cadillac XLR. It was first opened on June 1, 1981.\nBy 2023, the plant had produced approximately 1.1 million Corvettes. As of 2022, GM employed approximately 1,100 people in Bowling Green. \nHistory.\nThe first 300 Corvettes were hand built at a plant in Flint, Michigan in 1953. Production was moved the next year to a facility in St. Louis, Missouri and then finally ended up in 1981 at the Bowling Green Assembly Plant. General Motors opened the Bowling Green plant for production on June 1 that year, with most of the 900 Corvette workers from St. Louis transferring to the new plant. What was once an abandoned Chrysler industrial air-conditioning unit factory is now a 1.7 million square foot facility that employs almost one thousand people. The factory was built by the Chrysler Airtemp Division as the area provided the potential for skilled workers due to the high quality vocational training. In 1968, when plans for the factory were announced, Charles B. Gorey Jr., the vice president of the Chrysler Airtemp Division, announced that \"production will require workers skilled in machine trades and most employees will be men.\" After the factory was acquired from Chrysler, General Motors spent an estimated $130 million to refurbish the factory and install its own assembly line. Guided tours of the plant are available throughout the year on weekdays, three times a day.\nOn December 11, 2021, an EF-3 tornado damaged the roof and an entrance to the plant, briefly halting production. No employees were injured.\nWorkers.\nAs of 2022, GM employed approximately 1,100 people in Bowling Green. The plant's workers are unionized, belonging to the United Auto Workers Local 2164.\nInvestments.\nMany large investments have been made to keep the plant as updated and cutting edge as possible. As the Corvette improves throughout the years, the technology to create it has to be revamped as well. \nPerformance Build Center.\nThe performance build center allows engine aficionados to build their own specialty engines. With the relocation of the performance build center from Michigan to Bowling Green, it allows customers to be able to build and watch the production of their car now all in one location. The opening of this center in Bowling Green is adding 20 new or relocated jobs to the community as well.\nThe center is the source of all the hand assembled dry sump engines. These would be the 6.2L LS3 V8 engine of the grand sport coupe (manual transmission only), the 7.0L LS7 V8 Z06 engine, and the 6.2L supercharged LS9 engine for the ZR1.\nBody shop.\nThe new body shop now allows the aluminum frame to be produced in-house. The new shop also was designed to have the advancements to make the most complex frame design in Corvette's history. This new frame is 99 pounds lighter and 40% stiffer than the C6 frame. With the chassis being so strong, the C7 convertible will not need any additional structural reinforcements to the frame which is very rare.\nCommunity involvement.\nFeatures a wildlife habitat that is spread across 75 acres. The space also features a 42,000 pounds of ground-up ergonomic mats recycled from the plant for a picnic area. The land also features sunflowers that were planted by students and blue bird boxes that were made and installed by a local Boy Scout troop. The plant employs an environmental team that chooses appropriate plant species for the grounds.\nVehicles produced.\nAs of September, 2022:"

        "text": "The 2006 Rugby League Tri-Nations (also known as the Gillette Rugby League Tri-Nations due to sponsorship by Gillette) was the second Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament hosted by Australia and New Zealand. The tournament followed the same format as in 2004 and 2005, with each team meeting the other two teams twice, and the top two teams at the end of the group stages proceeding to the final. Australia was to run out winners in a tight final, winning in golden point extra time with Kangaroos captain Darren Lockyer scoring a try in the 87th minute.\nThe teams.\nAustralia.\nCoach: Ricky Stuart (Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks)\nGreat Britain.\nCoach: Brian Noble (Wigan Warriors)\nNew Zealand.\nCoach: Brian McClennan (Auckland Lions)\nVenues.\nThe games were played at the following venues in Australia and New Zealand. The tournament final was played in Sydney.\nTournament matches.\nDuring the first minutes of the match Australian forward Willie Mason punched Stuart Fielden, breaking his nose and sparking a brawl, and later took Sean Long out after kicking, leading with an elbow which left Long's head bloodied and bandaged for the rest of the match. He was later charged for his punch on Fielden and had to face a Rugby League International Federation disciplinary committee the following Monday, where he was fined AUD$5000 and suspended for one game. After almost thirty minutes the Australians opened the scoring when, defending within their own ten-metre line, their scrum-half back Ben Hornby intercepted a pass and ran twenty metres before giving the ball on to winger Greg Inglis to run the remaining seventy to the line and score under the posts. Lockyer converted the try so it was 6 - 0 in favour of the Kangaroos. A few minutes later Irish winger Brian Carney left the field with a hamstring injury and was replaced by Lee Gilmour. Then Great Britain struck back with scrum-half-back Sean Long dummying his way through the defence thirty-five metres from the line then passing back inside to fullback Paul Wellens to score. Long then converted the try, so the scores were level at 6 all at the break.\nOn the other side of half-time, the Lions scored after about two minutes from close range when forward Jamie Peacock barged his way through the defence and over the line. The video referee gave the try 'benefit of the doubt' and Sean Long's kick didn't miss, so the score was 12 - 6 in favour of Great Britain. The Australians hit back with another long range try, the ball being moved out to Inglis on the left wing to make a break down the sideline before passing back inside to five-eighth Darren Lockyer to finish the run to the line and touch down behind the uprights. Lockyer then converted, levelling the score at 12 - 12. About ten minutes later the British struck back when Lee Gilmour hit a gap twenty metres out and ran through to dive over beneath the sticks. Sean Long converted so the Lions regained the lead at 18 - 12. With just over ten minutes remaining Great Britain got an opportunity to put themselves in front by more than a converted try when they were awarded a penalty, but Long's kick missed. Shortly after he got a chance to make amends with a drop goal but missed. However, with less than five minutes remaining he helped seal the match when he kicked a loose pass fifteen metres from his own goal-line downfield and chased after it, regathering and running just over the half-way line before passing it James Roby in support who couldn't outrun Nathan Hindmarsh. From the play-the-ball twenty metres away from Australia's goal-line, the British moved the ball through the hands out to the other side of the field to winger Gareth Raynor who dived over in the corner. Long's conversion attempt struck the post and missed, but he later kicked a field goal in the final minutes to make it a 23 - 12 victory, Great Britain's first in Australia since their 1992 tour.\nThis was the last match to be played against Australia by Great Britain before they split into England, Wales and Scotland.\nFinal.\nEarly penalties for infringements in the ruck by the Kiwis, gave Australia an early two points from a Johnathan Thurston kick. The Kangaroos then mirrored this, conceding consecutive penalties that allowed Stacey Jones' goal a few minutes later to even the scores at 2 all. In the tenth minute Australia had the ball in the centre of the field and passed it out to Mark Gasnier who made a break down the right then passed to his winger Brent Tate to finish. Thurston's conversion was successful, so the home side led 8 - 2. Another penalty in the ruck in the twenty-first minute led to a minor scuffle and a goal from Thurston, extending the Kangaroos' lead to 10 - 2. Five minutes later New Zealand were ten metres into the Australians' half when Stacy Jones put a little chip kick over the heads of the Kangaroos for Brent Webb to run through and catch before drawing the defence and passing it on to Frank Pritchard who diver over untouched in the left corner. Jones missed the difficult conversion attempt, leaving the score 10 - 6 in favour of Australia. In the remaining ten minutes of play before half-time no more points were scored.\nAfter five minutes the Kiwis had made their way down to Australia's ten-metre line when they moved the ball through the hands out to the right where Nigel Vagana threw a short ball back inside for Iosia Soliola charging through to score. The scores were level at 10 - 10 and Stacy Jones' kick missed. A few minutes later Australia were given a penalty and Thurston kicked for goal, regaining his side's lead 12 - 10. In the sixty-ninth minute the Kiwis picked up a penalty in front of the posts and Jones kicked it this time, levelling the scores at 12 - 12. The Kangaroos then survived several raids on their try-line and two field goal attempts before a Cameron Smith 40-20 kick brought them up to New Zealand's end with two minutes remaining where Thurston missed a drop goal attempt as well. Jones had another shot in the final minute, and Australia nearly scored a miraculous fifty-metre try, but the match was destined for golden point extra time.\nThe first five-minute period of extra time featured a missed field goal attempt each from Lockyer, then Jones. The teams then changed ends and started again. After eighty-seven minutes of test football, Australia gained possession of the ball. Thurston then received it thirty-five metres from his own in-goal and dummied his way through the defensive line. After running fifty metres he passed back inside to Darren Lockyer in support who was ankle-tapped on his way to the try-line and stumbled over under the posts, giving Australia a 16-12 golden-point victory.\nAustralia's victory regained them the Tri-nations trophy which they had lost to New Zealand in the final of the 2005 series in England. Lockyer, who in 2006 captained Queensland to victory in the State of Origin, winning the Wally Lewis Medal for player of the series, captained the Brisbane Broncos to victory in the 2006 NRL Grand Final, then won his second Golden Boot Award for international player of the year, collected the trophy.\nThe New Zealand loss brought down the curtain on the test careers of captain Ruben Wiki, who retired as New Zealand's most capped international, as well as Stacey Jones and Nigel Vagana.\nNon-series matches.\nDuring the series, Great Britain and New Zealand played additional matches to maintain their level of fitness."

        "title": "Tennis scoring system",
        "text": "The tennis scoring system is a standard widespread method for scoring tennis matches, including pick-up games. Some tennis matches are played as part of a tournament, which may have various categories, such as singles and doubles. The great majority are organised as a single-elimination tournament, with competitors being eliminated after a single loss, and the overall winner being the last competitor without a loss. Optimally, such tournaments have a number of competitors equal to a power of two in order to fully fill out a single elimination bracket. In many professional and top-level amateur events, the brackets are seeded according to a recognised ranking system, in order to keep the best players in the field from facing each other until as late in the tournament as possible; additionally, if byes are necessary because of a less-than-full bracket, those byes in the first round are usually given to the highest-seeded competitors.\nA tennis match is composed of points, games, and sets. A set consists of a number of games (a minimum of six), which in turn each consist of points. A set is won by the first side to win six games, with a margin of at least two games over the other side (e.g. 6–3 or 7–5). If the set is tied at six games each, a tie-break is usually played to decide the set. A match is won when a player or a doubles team has won the majority of the prescribed number of sets. Matches employ either a best-of-three (first to two sets wins) or best-of-five (first to three sets wins) set format. The best-of-five set format is usually only used in the men's singles matches at Grand Slam tournaments.\nGame score.\nDescription.\nA game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first side to win at least four points and have a margin of two points or more over their opponent. Normally, the server's score is always called first and the receiver's score second. Score calling in tennis is unusual in that (except in tie-breaks) each point has a corresponding call that is different from its point value. The current point score is announced orally before each point by the umpire, or by the server if there is no umpire.\nFor instance, if the server has won three points so far in the game, and the non-server has won one, the score is \"40–15\".\nWhen both sides have won the same number of points within a given game—i.e., when each side has won one, or two, points—the score is described as \"15–all\" and \"30–all\", respectively. However, if each player has won three points, the score is called as \"deuce\", not \"40–all\". From that point on in the game, whenever the score is tied, it is described as \"deuce\" regardless of how many points have been played.\nHowever, if the score is called in French (for example at the French Open), the first occurrence of \"40–all\" in a single game may be called as such (\", \", or \"\"). Thereafter, \"deuce\" (\"\" in French) is used for all other occurrences when the score returns to \"40–all\" within the same game.\nIn standard play, scoring beyond a \"deuce\" score, in which the players have scored three points each, requires that one player must get two points ahead in order to win the game. This type of tennis scoring is known as \"advantage scoring\" (or \"ads\"). The side that wins the next point after deuce is said to have the advantage. If they lose the next point, the score is again deuce, since the score is tied. If the side with the advantage wins the next point, that side has won the game, since they have a lead of two points. When the server is the player with the advantage, the score may be called as \"advantage in\". When the server's opponent has the advantage, the score may be called as \"advantage out\". These phrases are sometimes shortened to \"ad in\" or \"van in\" (or \"my ad\") and \"ad out\" (or \"your ad\"). Alternatively, the players' names are used: in professional tournaments the umpire announces the score in this format (e.g., \"advantage Nadal\" or \"advantage Williams\").\nIn the USTA rule book (but not the ITF rules), there is the following comment: \"'Zero', 'one', 'two', and 'three' may be substituted for 'Love', '15', '30', and '40'. This is particularly appropriate for matches with an inexperienced player or in which one player does not understand English.\"\nFor tie-breaks, the calls are simply the number of points won by each player:\nHistory.\nThe origins of the 15, 30, and 40 scores are believed to be medieval French. The earliest reference is in a ballad by Charles D'Orleans in 1435 which refers to (\"forty-five\"), which gave rise to modern 40. In 1522, there is a sentence in Latin, \"we are winning 30, we are winning 45\". The first recorded theories about the origin of 15 were published in 1555 and 1579. However, the origins of this convention remain obscure.\nSome believe that clock faces were used to keep score on court, with a quarter move of the minute hand to indicate a score of 15, 30, and 45. When the hand moved to 60, the game was over. However, in order to ensure that the game could not be won by a one-point difference in players' scores, the idea of \"deuce\" was introduced. To make the score stay within the 60 ticks on the clock face, the 45 was changed to 40. Therefore, if both players had 40, the first player to score would receive ten, and that would move the clock to 50. If that player scored a second time in a row, they would be awarded another ten and the clock would move to 60, signifying the end of the game. However, if the player failed to score twice in a row, then the clock would move back to 40 to establish another \"deuce\".\nAlthough this suggestion might sound attractive, the first reference to tennis scoring (as mentioned above) is in the 15th century, and at that time clocks measured only the hours (1 to 12). It was not until about 1690, when the more accurate pendulum escapement was invented, that clocks regularly had minute hands. Therefore, the concept of tennis scores originating from the clock face could not have come from medieval times.\nHowever, the clock at the Wells Cathedral in England, which dates from 1386, had an inner dial with 60 minutes and a minute indicator and chimed every quarter hour. Likewise, the clock erected in 1389 at Rouen, France, chimed every fifteen minutes. By the end of the 14th century, the most advanced clocks would have marked minutes and chimed on the quarter hours. Clock faces like these would likely have been familiar to the English and French nobles by 1435 and 1522. It is not hard to imagine that they might have used a mock-up of a clock face to keep score, and that they would score by quarter hours since that is when the clocks chimed.\nAnother theory is that the scoring nomenclature came from the French game (a precursor to tennis which initially used the hand instead of a racket). was very popular before the French Revolution, with more than 1,000 courts in Paris alone. The traditional court was 90 feet (\"pieds du roi\") in length with 45 feet on each side. The server moved 15 feet closer after scoring, another 15 feet after scoring again, and an additional 10 feet by scoring a third time. (For reference: the French foot is 6.5% larger than the imperial foot.)\nThe use of \"love\" for zero probably derives from the phrase \"playing for love\", meaning \"without stakes being wagered, for nothing\". Another explanation is that it derives from the French expression for \"the egg\" () because an egg looks like the number zero. This is similar to the origin of the term \"duck\" in cricket, supposedly from \"duck's egg\", referring to a batsman who has been called out without scoring a run. Another possibility comes from the Dutch expression , which means to do something for praise, implying no monetary stakes. Another theory on the origins of the use of \"love\" comes from the notion that, at the start of any match, when scores are at zero, players still have \"love for each other\".\nAlternative (\"no-ad\") game scoring.\nA popular alternative to advantage scoring, nowadays used at exhibition matches as well as professional tournaments in doubles, is the \"no-advantage\" or \"no-ad\" scoring, created by James Van Alen in order to shorten match playing time. No-advantage scoring is a method in which the first player to reach four points wins the game in all circumstances. No-ad scoring eliminates the requirement that a player must win by two points after a tie. Therefore, if the game is tied at deuce, the next player to win a point wins the game. This method of scoring is used in most World TeamTennis matches. When this style of play is implemented, at deuce the receiver chooses from which side of the court he or she desires to return the serve. However, in no-ad mixed doubles play, each gender always serves to the same gender at game point and during the final point of tiebreaks.\nHandicap scoring.\nIn the early 20th century, it was common for tournaments to have handicap events alongside the main events. In handicap events, the lesser-skilled player is given a certain number of points in each game. This is done so that players of different skill levels can have a competitive match. These handicaps consisted of two numbers separated by a period: \"A.B\", where \"A\" is the player's starting score and \"B\" is the number of games where the player receives an extra point.\nFor example, a player with a handicap of \"15.2\" would start every game with a score of \"15\". In each series of six games, the player would also receive an extra point in two of the games. Therefore, they would start two out of every six games with \"30\" and the remaining four out of six games with \"15\".\nThese handicap ratings where a player receives points can be denoted with an \"R\" in front, where the \"R\" indicates the player is receiving points. It is also possible to have a handicap system where the player owes points due to being higher-skilled, in which case the same two-number system is also used. These owed handicaps are denoted with an \"O\" in front that is short for \"owed\".\nSet score.\nDescription.\nIn tennis, a set consists of a sequence of games played with alternating service and return roles. There are two types of set formats that require different types of scoring.\nAn \"advantage set\" is played until a player or team has won at least six games and that player or team has a two-game lead over their opponent(s). The set continues, without tiebreak(er), until a player or team wins the set by two games. Advantage sets are no longer played under the rules of the United States Tennis Association, nor in the Australian Open starting from 2019; and since 2022 for all other tournaments, including the French Open, the Fed Cup, and the Olympics. From 2019 to 2021, Wimbledon used a unique scoring system for the last set where the players continued to play after 6–all until a player earned a two-game lead (as in an advantage set); however, if the players reached 12–all, a seven-point tiebreaker was played to determine the winner. Mixed doubles at the Grand Slams (except for Wimbledon, which is a best-of-three sets format) have the third set replaced by a super tiebreak—sometimes referred to as a \"best-of-two\" format.\nA \"tie-break set\" is played with the same rules as the advantage set, except that when the score is tied at 6–6, a tie-break game (\"tiebreaker\") is played. Typically, the tiebreaker continues until one side has won seven points with a margin of two or more points. However, many tiebreakers are played with different tiebreak point requirements, such as 8 or 10 points. Often, a seven-point tiebreaker is played when the set score is tied at 6–6 to determine who wins the set. If the tiebreak score gets to 6–6, then whichever player to win the best of two points wins the set.\nUnlike games, set scores are counted in the ordinary manner (1, 2, 3, etc.), except that the state of having won zero games is called \"love\". The score is called at the end of each game, with the leading player's score first (e.g. \"\"A\" leads 3–2\"), or as \"\"X\"–all\". When a player wins a set, it is called as \"game and first set\", \"game and second set\", etc.\nIn doubles, service alternates between the teams. One player serves for an entire service game, with that player's partner serving for the entirety of the team's next service game. Players of the receiving team receive the serve on alternating points, with each player of the receiving team declaring which side of the court (deuce or ad side) they will receive serve on for the duration of the set. Teams alternate service games every game.\nComparison.\n\"Advantage sets\" sometimes continue much longer than \"tie-break sets\". The 2010 Wimbledon first-round match between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut, which is the longest professional tennis match in history, notably ended with Isner winning the fifth set by 70–68. The match lasted in total 11 hours and 5 minutes, with the fifth set alone lasting 8 hours, 11 minutes. \nNevertheless, even tie-break sets can last a long time. For instance, once players reach 6–6 set score and also reach 6–6 tiebreaker score, play must continue until one player has a two-point advantage, which can take a considerable time. Sets decided by tiebreakers, however, are typically significantly shorter than extended advantage sets.\nThe set is won by the first player (or team) to have won at least six games and at least two games more than his or her opponent. Traditionally, sets would be played until both these criteria had been met, with no maximum number of games. To shorten matches, James Van Alen created a tie-breaker system, which was widely introduced in the early 1970s. If the score reaches 6–5 (or 5–6), one further game is played. If the leading player wins this game, the set is won 7–5 (or 5–7). If the trailing player wins the game, the score is tied at 6–6 and a special tiebreaker game is played. The winner of the tiebreak wins the set by a score of 7–6 (or 6–7).\nSometimes, a tie-break set is not employed for the final set of a match, and an advantage set is used instead. In this case, the final, deciding set is played until one player or team has won two more games than the opponent. Of the major tennis championships, this only applies in the French Open. In the US Open, a tiebreak is played in the deciding set (fifth set for the men, third set for the women) at 6–all. In Wimbledon from 2019 to 2021, a tiebreak was played if the score reached 12–all in the final set. In the Australian Open, a \"first to 10\" tiebreak is played in the deciding set if it reaches 6–all. (When the tiebreak was first introduced at Wimbledon in 1971, it was invoked at 8–8 rather than 6–6.) The US Open formerly held \"Super Saturday\" where the two men's semi-finals were played along with the women's final on the second Saturday of the event; therefore a tie-break was more prudent where player rest and scheduling is more important.\nIn 2022—on behalf of the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open—the Grand Slam Board announced the joint decision to play a 10-point tie-break at all Grand Slams, to be played when the score reaches 6–all in the final set. Should the tiebreaker game deciding the match be tied at 9–all, whoever leads by two points afterwards wins.\nScoring a tiebreak game.\nAt a game score of 6–all, a set is often determined by one more game called a \"twelve-point tiebreaker\" (or just \"tiebreak\"). Only one more game is played to determine the winner of the set; the score of the resulting completed set is 7–6 or 6–7 (though it can be 6–all if a player retires before completion).\nPoints are counted using ordinary numbering. The set is won by the player who has scored at least seven points in the tiebreak and at least two points more than their opponent. For example, if the point score is 6–5 and the player with six points wins the next point, they win both the tiebreak (seven points to five) and the set (seven games to six). If the player with five points wins the point instead (for a score of 6–all), the tiebreak continues and cannot be won on the next point (7–6 or 6–7), since no player will be two points ahead. In the scoring of the set, sometimes the tiebreak points are shown as well as the game count (e.g., 7–610–8). Another way of listing the score of the tiebreak is to list only the loser's points. For example, if the set score is listed as 7–6(8), the tiebreak score was 10–8 (since the eight is the loser's score, and the winner must win by two points). Similarly, 7–6(3) means the tiebreak score was 7–3.\nThe player who would normally be serving after 6–6 is the one to serve first in the tiebreak, and the tiebreak is considered a service game for this player. The server begins his or her service from the deuce court and serves one point. Subsequently, the serve changes to the first server's opponent. Each player then serves two consecutive points for the remainder of the tiebreak. The first of each two-point sequence starts from the server's advantage court and the second starts from the deuce court. In this way, the sum of the scores is even when the server serves from the deuce court. After every six points, the players switch ends of the court; note that the side-changes during the tiebreak will occur in the middle of a server's two-point sequence. Following the tiebreak, the players switch ends of the court again, since the set score is always odd (13 games).\nAn alternative tie-break system called the \"Coman Tie-Break\" is sometimes used by the United States Tennis Association. Scoring is the same, but end changes take place after the first point and then after every four points. This approach allows the servers of doubles teams to continue serving from the same end of the court as during the body of the set. It also reduces the advantage the elements (e.g. wind and sun) could give playing the first six points of a seven-point tiebreak on one side of the court. Another tie-break system, called the \"super tiebreaker\", consists of one player reaching a total of 10 points. The player must win by two points so there is no limit to the highest number of points. A typically close score may look like 10–8.\nAt Wimbledon, a tie-break was not played in the final set until the score reaches 12–all. At the Australian Open, a tie-break was played in the final set at 6–all, but continued until one player had ten points, and was leading by two. The US Open used a conventional, \"first to seven\" tie-break at 6–all in the final set. The French Open was the only Grand Slam or professional tournament where a final-set tie-break was not played, and it was played as an advantage set until the 2022 edition. In March 2022, the French Open and all other Grand Slams adopted the “10-point tie-break” when the final set reaches 6–all.\nHistory of the tiebreak.\nThe tiebreaker—commonly shortened to just \"tiebreak\"—was invented by James Van Alen and unveiled in 1965 as an experiment at the pro tournament he sponsored at Newport Casino, Rhode Island, after an earlier, unsuccessful attempt to speed up the game by the use of his so-called \"Van Alen Streamlined Scoring System\" (VASSS). For two years before the Open Era, in 1955 and 1956, the United States Pro Championship in Cleveland, Ohio, was played by VASSS rules. The scoring was the same as that in table tennis, with sets played to 21 points and players alternating five services, with no second service. The rules were created partially to limit the effectiveness of the powerful service of the reigning professional champion, Pancho Gonzales. Even with the new rules, however, Gonzales beat Pancho Segura in the finals of both tournaments. Even though the 1955 match went to five sets, with Gonzales barely holding on to win the last one 21–19, it is reported to have taken 47 minutes to complete. The fans attending the matches preferred the traditional rules, however, and in 1957 the tournament reverted to the old method of scoring.\nVan Alen called his innovation a \"tiebreaker\", and he proposed two different versions: the \"best-five-of-nine-points\" tiebreaker and the \"best-seven-of-twelve-points\" tiebreaker.\nThe \"best-five-of-nine-point\" tiebreaker lasts a maximum of nine points, and awards victory in the set to whichever player or team first reaches five points, even if the other player or team already has four: the margin of victory can be a single point. Because this tiebreaker \"must\" end after a maximum of nine points, Van Alen also called it a \"sudden-death tiebreaker\" (if and when the score reaches 4–all, both players face simultaneous set point and match point). This type of tiebreaker had its Grand Slam debut at the 1970 US Open, where it was employed until 1974. It was also used for a while on the Virginia Slims circuit and in American college tennis. This format is still used at the World TeamTennis.\nThe \"best-seven-of-twelve-point\" tiebreaker lasts a minimum of seven points. This is the most familiar and widely used tiebreaker today. Because it ends as soon as either player or team reaches seven points and has a lead of at least two points, it can actually be over in as few as seven points. However, due to this required two-point margin, this tiebreaker can go \"beyond\" 12 points—sometimes well beyond. Because of this, Van Alen derisively likened it to a \"lingering death\", in contrast to the \"sudden-death tiebreaker\" that he recommended and preferred.\nThe impetus to use some kind of a tie-breaking procedure gained force after a monumental 1969 struggle at Wimbledon between Pancho Gonzales and Charlie Pasarell. This was a 5-set match that lasted 5 hours and 12 minutes, and took two days to complete. In the fifth set, the 41-year-old Gonzales won all seven match points Pasarell had against him, twice coming back from 0–40 deficits. The final score was 22–24, 1–6, 16–14, 6–3, 11–9 for Gonzales.\nThe tiebreaker gave tennis a definite \"finish line\".\nIn 1970, the US Open introduced the nine-point tiebreaker rule for all sets that reach 6–6, both in singles and in doubles. The 12-point tiebreaker format was introduced in 1975.\nIn 1971, Wimbledon put into effect a 12-point tiebreaker when the score in a set reached 8–8 in games unless the set was such that one of the players could achieve a match victory by winning it.\nIn 1979, Wimbledon changed their rules so that a (12-point) tiebreak would be played once any set except the final set reached 6–6 in games.\nIn 1989, the Davis Cup adopted the tie-break in all sets except for the final set, and then extended it to the final set starting in 2016.\nIn 2001, the Australian Open adopted the tiebreak at 6–6 in the final set in men's and women's doubles matches. The French Open followed in 2007.\nIn 2001, the Australian Open replaced the deciding third set of mixed doubles with an eighteen-point \"match tiebreak\" (first to ten points and win by two points wins the match). Despite some criticism of the change by fans and former pros, the US Open (from 2003) and the French Open (from 2007) have followed the Australian Open in using the same format for mixed doubles. Wimbledon continues to play a traditional best-of-three match.\nLikewise, the ATP Tour introduced a match tiebreak format for doubles tournaments in 2006. The WTA Tour adopted that rule in 2007.\nTie-break sets are now nearly universal in all levels of play, for all sets in a match; however, the tie-break is not a compulsory element in any set, and the actual formatting of sets and tie-breaks depends on the tournament director in tournaments, and, in private matches, on the players' agreement before play begins. Final set tie-breaks were adopted by the Australian Open in 2019, the French Open in 2022, Wimbledon in 2019, Fed Cup in 2019, Davis Cup in 2016, and the Olympics in 2016. The US Open had had it since the 1970s, and was the only major tournament to use a tiebreak in the final set for singles from 1970 to 2018. However, the Australian Open and French Open also use a final-set tiebreak in both men's and women's doubles.\nAfter criticism of two lengthy semifinals in the 2018 Men's singles, Wimbledon announced the 2019 Championships would use final-set tiebreaks if the score reached 12–12. The first was in the Men's doubles third round, with Henri Kontinen and John Peers defeating Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury.\nShortly following Wimbledon's final set tiebreak introduction announcement, the Australian Open also for their 2019 tournament introduced a \"super-tiebreak\" at 6–6 for both singles and doubles (but not mixed doubles) in the final set, replacing the previous format in which the final set would continue until one player was ahead by two games. The new format for the final set is similar to the \"12-point tiebreaker\", but with the winner being the first to ten points instead of seven (and they must still win by two points). Tennis Australia has called this a \"10-point tiebreak\". Prior to the 2022, the French Open remained the only grand slam tournament that did not use any form of a tie-break for singles in the final set. \nThis led to each of the four grand slam events having four different final-set scoring systems. This ended in March 2022, when the ATP, WTA, and ITF announced that final-set tiebreaks in all Grand Slams will have a 10-point tiebreak when the set reaches six games all (6–6). The IOC employed this format since the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021; however, the 13th game of every set has a 7-point tiebreaker.\nAlternative set scoring format.\nWhile traditional sets continue until a player wins at least six games by a margin of at least two games, there are some alternative set scoring formats.\nA common alternative set format is the eight or nine game pro set, which is played until one player wins eight or nine games (instead of six) with a margin of two games. The tie-break is therefore played at eight or nine games all. While this format is not used in modern professional matches or recognized by the ITF rules, it was supposedly used in early professional tours. It is commonly utilized in various amateur leagues and high school tennis as a shorter alternative to a best-of-three match, but longer than a traditional tie-break set. In addition, eight-game pro sets were used during doubles for all Division I college dual matches until the 2014–2015 season.\nAnother alternative set format is the \"short sets\", which is played until one player wins four games with a margin of two games. In this format, a tie-break is played at four games all. The ITF experimented with this format in low level Davis Cup matches, but the experiment was not continued. Nevertheless, this alternative remains as an acceptable alternative in the ITF rules of tennis.\nAnother alternative set format is seen in World TeamTennis, where the winner of a set is the first to win five games, and a 9-point tie-break is played at 4–4.\nAn alternative to Tennis Australia's Fast4 shorter scoring method is Thirty30 tennis, in which every game starts at 30–30. Thirty30 (T30) is a shortened format of tennis and can be described as the equivalent of the Twenty20 (T20) format of cricket. Sets are rather short: one set is generally played in 20 minutes.\nMatch score.\nDescription.\nThe winner is the side that wins more than half of the sets, and the match ends as soon as this is achieved. Men's matches may be the best of either three or five sets, while women's and mixed doubles matches are usually best of three sets.\nThe alternation of service between games continues throughout the match without regard to sets, but the ends are changed after each odd game within a set (including the last game). If, for example, the second set of a match ends with the score at 6–3, 1–6, the ends are changed as the last game played was the 7th (odd) game of the set and in spite of it being the 16th (even) game of the match. Even when a set ends with an odd game, ends are again changed after the first game of the following set. A tiebreaker game is treated as a single game for the purposes of this alternation. Since tiebreakers always result in a score of 7–6, there is always a court change after the tiebreaker. That change would occur in the next set. \nThe score of a complete match may be given simply by sets won, or with the scores in each set given separately. In either case, the match winner's score is stated first. For example: in the former, shorter form, a match might be listed as 3–1 (i.e. three sets to one). In the latter form, this same match might be further described as \"7–5, 6–7(4–7), 6–4, 7–6(8–6)\". (As noted above, an alternate form of writing the tiebreak score lists only the loser's score—e.g., \"7–6(6)\" for the fourth set in the example.) This match was won three sets to one, with the match loser winning the second set on a tiebreaker. The numbers in parentheses, normally included in printed scorelines but omitted when spoken, indicate the score of the tiebreaker game in a set. Here, the match winner lost the second-set tiebreaker 4–7 and won the fourth-set tiebreaker 8–6.\nTotal points won.\nBecause tennis is scored set by set and game by game, a player may lose a match despite winning the majority of points and/or games played.\nConsider a player who wins six games in each of two sets, all by a score of game–30. The winner has scored 4×12 = 48 points and the loser 2×12 = 24. Suppose also that the loser wins four games in each set, all by a score of game–love. The loser has scored 4×8 = 32 points and the winner zero in those games. The final score is a win by 6–4, 6–4; total points 48–56.\nAn example of this in actual practice was the record-breaking Isner–Mahut match in the Wimbledon first round, 22–24 June 2010. American John Isner beat Nicolas Mahut of France (6–4, 3–6, 6–7(7–9), 7–6(7–3), 70–68) despite Mahut winning a total of 502 points to Isner's 478.\nTotal games won.\nLikewise, a player may lose a match despite winning the majority of games played (or win a match despite losing the majority of games). Roger Federer won the 2009 Wimbledon final over Andy Roddick (5–7, 7–6(8–6), 7–6(7–5), 3–6, 16–14) despite Roddick's winning more games (39, versus Federer's 38). Roger Federer lost the 2019 Wimbledon final, despite winning more games (and points, in fact) than Novak Djokovic.\nAnnouncing the score.\nWhen playing a match, it is usually best to report each score out loud with one's opponent to avoid conflicts. During a game, the server has the responsibility to announce the game score before serving. This is done by announcing the server's score first. If, for example, the server loses the first three points of the service game, the server would say \"love–40\". This is to be done every time.\nAfter a set is complete, the server, before serving for the first game of the next set, announces the set scores so far completed in the match, stating their own scores first. If the server has won the first two sets and is beginning the third, the server would say, \"two–love, new set\". If the server had lost the first two sets, the server would say, \"love–two, new set\". After completing the match, either player, when asked the score, announces their own scores first.\nExample.\nAs an example, consider a match between Victoria Azarenka and Ana Ivanovic. Azarenka wins the first set 6–4, Ivanovic wins the next set 7–6 (winning the tiebreak 7–4), and Azarenka wins the final set 6–0.\nAt the end of each set, the umpire would announce the winner of each set:\nAt the completion of the match, the result would be announced as:\nThe result would be written as:\nThe score is always written and announced in respect to the winner of the match. The score of the tiebreak is not included in announcing the final result; it is simply said \"seven–six\" or \"six–seven\" regardless of the score in the tiebreak.\nIf a match ends prematurely due to one player retiring or being disqualified (defaulting), the partial score at that point is announced as the final score, with the remaining player as the nominal winner. For instance, the result in the final of the 2012 Aegon Championships was written and announced as follows:\nVariations and slang.\nDuring informal play of tennis, especially at tennis clubs in the U.S. (and other English-speaking countries), score announcements are frequently shortened with the use of abbreviations. For example, a score 15 is replaced with \"five\", or in some cases \"fif\". \"Love\" is often substituted to indicate \"zero\". Similarly, the scores of 30 and 40 may sometimes be spoken as \"three\" or \"four\" respectively. A score of 15–all may sometimes be announced as \"fives\". To further confuse score announcements, a score of 30–all (30–30) may often be called \"deuce\", and the following point referred to as \"ad in\" or \"ad out\" (or \"my ad\" or \"your ad\"), depending on which player (or team) won the point. The logic for this is that a 30–all score is \"effectively\" the same as deuce (40–40), in that one must win the next two points to win the game.\nScorecards.\nFor formal scorekeeping, the official scoring the match (e.g., the chair umpire) fills out a scorecard, either on paper or electronically. The scorecard allows the official to record details for each point, as well as rule violations and other match information. Standard markings for each point are:\nAn additional dot is marked in a score box to indicate a missed first serve fault."

        "text": "The European Rugby League (ERL) (previously Rugby League European Federation (RLEF)) is the umbrella body for nations playing the sport of rugby league football across Europe. In the absence of other continental federations, ERL also controls rugby league in North America the Middle East and Africa through its sub-branches Americas Rugby League and Middle East-Africa Rugby League.\nHistory.\nThe federation was founded January 2003 following an initiative between Richard Lewis, Executive Chairman of Great Britain's Rugby Football League (RFL) and his French counterpart Jean Paul Ferre of the French Rugby League Federation (FFR). The RLEF's first constitution was approved in January 2004 and the federation's first Board of Directors was elected. This first Board of Directors consisted of Jean Paul Ferre as Chairman and Richard Lewis as Deputy Chairman, with Nigel Wood and Nicolas Larrat being the other Board members. Representatives for Morocco, Italy, Serbia, Russia, Lebanon, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales attended. Russia became a full member of the RLEF, joining Britain and France, and the RLIF soon after.\nAt the time of its foundation, the RLEF placed a \"particular emphasis on generating development funding within each country\". Historically, much of the development work conducted in Europe had been funded by the RFL. Following the profitable 2008 World Cup, the RFL and RLEF prepared to bid for funds to enhance their activities.\n2004 saw the revival of the Rugby League European Championship, now ran by the RLEF.\nIn December 2009, Kevin Rudd, a former Scotland rugby league international, stepped down as Executive Officer of the RLEF after more than five years in the post. RLEF Chairman Richard Lewis stated that Rudd \"has done an outstanding job and created a platform, structure and competitions framework that can take us into the future\". Rudd was succeeded by Danny Kazandjian. Kazandjian had previously been a key figure in the establishment of rugby league in Lebanon and had led the RLEF's development drive in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions as Director of Development for the Euro-Med region.\nIn 2011, the RLEF introduced two sub-branches – Americas Rugby League and Middle East-Africa Rugby League – to further develop rugby league in those regions.\nIn 2021, The RLEF was renamed to the European Rugby League in line with the RLIF's renaming to the International Rugby League.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Rugby League banned Russia from all international rugby league competitions.\nERL board.\nCurrent board.\nFormer members: Chairperson: Maurice Watkins , Board Member: Blagoje Stoiljkovic \nMembership.\nCurrently eleven nations are full members of the federation; there are also fifteen affiliate members and nineteen official observers. Full members are entitled to a greater proportion of voting rights and to become members of the Rugby League International Federation.\nIn order to become an associate member, a nation must meet the following criteria:\nThe ERL stipulates that continued associate and full membership of the federation is subject to a check every two years to ensure that the minimum criteria are still being met."

        "title": "Alf Smith (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Alfred Edward Smith (June 3, 1873 in Ottawa, Ontario – August 21, 1953 in Ottawa, Ontario) was a Canadian amateur and professional ice hockey forward who played for the Ottawa Senators ( \"Silver Seven\") and Kenora Thistles. He had six younger brothers who played senior-level hockey in Ottawa: Daniel (b. 1876), Jack (b. 1878), Harry (b. 1883), Tommy (b. 1886), Billy (b. 1889) and George Smith (b. 1891). He was captain of the Ottawa Hockey Club and also coached the team.\nHe also played rugby football with the Ottawa Rough Riders, and, in 1902, won a championship with teammate in hockey as well Bouse Hutton.\nHockey career.\nAlf Smith began his hockey career playing for the Ottawa Hockey Club (Ottawa HC) of the AHAC in the 1890s. In 1897 he retired from the Ottawa HC. In 1898, he played for the Ottawa Capitals intermediate team, but did not finish the season because he was ruled to be ineligible. In 1896, Smith had accepted a $100 bonus for play with the Capitals lacrosse team. By 1898, the Amateur Athletic Association of Canada ruled that he was ineligible for play in amateur hockey. He would not play for several years, but did coach the Ottawa Hockey Club to the 1901 CAHL title.\nIn 1901–02, he returned to active play, as a professional, in the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League for Pittsburgh. The following year he returned to Canada to coach the Ottawa HC to their first Stanley Cup championship against the Montreal Victorias in 1903. In 1903–04 he became reinstated as an amateur and he returned to play, playing right wing on a line that featured \"One Eyed\" Frank McGee. As a player-coach, he would eventually lead the team to consecutive Stanley Cup victories in 1904, 1905, and 1906, the club by then known as the \"Silver Seven\".\nSmith was known as a rough player. In 1907 Smith and teammates Harry Smith and Charles Spittal were charged with assault after beating Montreal Wanderers players Hod Stuart, Ernie \"Moose\" Johnson and Cecil Blachford with their sticks. Harry Smith was acquitted while Spittal and Alf Smith were each fined $20.\nFor the 1906–07 season, McGee retired and his place on the top line was taken by Alf's brother Harry. At the conclusion of the 1907 ECAHA season, Smith moved west to play with the Stanley Cup champion Kenora Thistles, playing in the MPHL finals. He was also a player during their unsuccessful Stanley Cup challenge rematch versus the Montreal Wanderers, where his presence along with Harry Westwick caused the series to be played under protest. He played one final season with Ottawa in 1908, scoring 12 goals in 9 games.\nIn 1908–09, he had an eventful season. Lured back to Pittsburgh for the newly reformed Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, he was suspended from two teams for rough play. He returned to Ottawa and played with several former Silver Seven players on the Senators of the Federal League. He made time that season to coach the Ottawa Cliffsides to the first Allan Cup championship, only to lose it to Queen's University in a challenge. This was his final season of play.\nIn 1909–10, he resumed his coaching career with Renfrew, the so-called \"Millionaires\" of the new National Hockey Association (NHA). He returned to coach the Ottawa Hockey Club in 1913 and coached the team until 1917. Smith later coached and managed teams in Moncton, New Brunswick, and North Bay, Ontario.\nAlong with Harvey Pulford, Harry Westwick and Russell Bowie, Smith was one of the final active players who had played major senior hockey in the 19th century. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962.\nHe died in Ottawa on August 21, 1953.\nCareer stats.\nSource: "

        "title": "Jack Stewart (ice hockey)",
        "text": "John Sherratt \"Black Jack\" Stewart (May 6, 1917 – May 25, 1983) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played 12 National Hockey League (NHL) seasons for the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Black Hawks. He won two Stanley Cup championships with the Red Wings and was named to the post-season NHL All-Star team on five occasions: three times on the first team and twice on the second. Stewart also played in the first four NHL All-Star Games. After completing his NHL career as captain of the Black Hawks, he went on to coach numerous teams at various levels of hockey.\nStewart was regarded as the hardest hitting defenceman of his time, a reputation that earned him his nickname. His style of play routinely resulted in injuries and scars; he defied expectations by returning to the game after suffering a ruptured disc in his back and later a fractured skull. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1964, and is also honoured by the Manitoba Hockey and Sports Halls of Fame.\nPlaying career.\nStewart played junior hockey with the Portage Terriers of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League in 1935–36 and 1936–37, where he was discovered by a Winnipeg businessman who suggested that James Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings, sign him. He was sent to play his first season of professional hockey for the team's minor league affiliate, the Pittsburgh Hornets of the International-American Hockey League (IAHL). He recorded one assist in 48 games in the 1937–38 season.\nPartway through his second season with the Hornets, the Red Wings recalled Stewart as part of a bid to shake up their team which had been struggling. He appeared in 32 games in his NHL rookie season of 1938–39, and immediately established himself as a physical presence. He played in all 48 games for Detroit in 1939–40; his lone goal on the campaign was the first of his career. Stewart and the Red Wings reached the Stanley Cup Finals in both 1941 and 1942, but lost to the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs, respectively. In his fifth season, 1942–43, Stewart was named to the NHL first All-Star team on defence and helped lead the Red Wings to the NHL regular season title. Reaching the Cup Finals for the third consecutive season, Detroit defeated Boston to win the Stanley Cup. Stewart scored one goal, added two assists and had 35 penalty minutes in ten playoff games.\nStewart's NHL career was interrupted by the Second World War in 1943. He remained in Canada, serving as a Leading Aircraftman in the Royal Canadian Air Force and playing hockey for the Montreal RCAF and Winnipeg RCAF teams between 1943 and 1945. Upon his return to the NHL, Stewart was paired up with Bill Quackenbush on the Red Wings defence. He went on to earn four additional all-star selections: he was named to the second team in 1945–46 and 1946–47, and to the first team again in 1947–48 and 1948–49. Additionally, he played in the first four National Hockey League All-Star Games, held between 1947 and 1950. Not known for his offence, Stewart never scored more than five goals in a season, and his career high of 19 points was set in 1947–48. He won his second Stanley Cup with the Red Wings in 1950 as they defeated the New York Rangers in double overtime of the deciding seventh game.\nFollowing the championship, the Red Wings dealt Stewart to the Chicago Black Hawks as part of a nine-player trade that was, at the time, the largest in NHL history. Stewart, Harry Lumley, Al Dewsbury, Pete Babando and Don Morrison were sent to Chicago in exchange for Metro Prystai, Bob Goldham, Gaye Stewart and Jim Henry. The Black Hawks named Stewart team captain and assistant coach almost immediately.\nStewart missed the majority of the 1950–51 NHL season and his career was believed over after he suffered a serious spinal injury in a December 14, 1950, game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Doctors diagnosed his injury as a ruptured disc and urged him to retire. He was told following the injury that he was lucky he could still walk without a cane and not to risk further damage on the ice. Instead, Stewart had the disc removed and after completing what Black Hawks' team doctors described as a \"most remarkable\" recovery, he opted to continue his career and signed with Chicago for the 1951–52 season.\nEarly in the season, Stewart suffered a minor skull fracture after colliding with teammate Clare Martin, an injury that forced him out of the lineup for several weeks. Stewart spent two weeks in hospital, after which he announced his retirement, but he again shocked observers by returning to the ice. However, by mid February 1952, his injuries led Stewart to ask the Black Hawks for his release so that he could seek a minor league coaching position.\nCoaching career.\nStewart was considered as coach of the New Westminster Royals of the Pacific Coast Hockey League, but chose to take the reins of the senior A Chatham Maroons in the Ontario Hockey Association. He served as a player-coach, appearing in 45 games for the Maroons in 1952–53, where he scored two goals and 29 points while accumulating 129 penalty minutes. Stewart played the final games of his career in 1953–54, finishing with eight assists in 21 games.\nThe following seasons saw Stewart move between several teams as head coach. He left the Maroons to guide the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen in 1955–56, then the Windsor Bulldogs for two seasons between 1957 and 1959. At one point in 1957, he was rumoured to become the next coach of the Chicago Black Hawks, a job that went instead to Rudy Pilous. Stewart moved into the professional ranks in 1961, taking over as the coach of Chicago's Eastern Professional Hockey League affiliate, the Sault Thunderbirds. One year later, Stewart moved to the Pittsburgh Hornets, an American Hockey League affiliate of the Detroit Red Wings. After winning only 16 games in 1962–63, Stewart retired after he was dismissed by the Hornets.\nPlaying style.\nDuring his career, Stewart was regarded as one of the hardest bodycheckers in the National Hockey League. He also carried the heaviest stick in the league, explaining that \"I don't use it for scoring. I use it for breaking arms\". Stewart was known for his large grin when hitting opponents; teammate Ted Lindsay noted \"when he had that smile, it was time for the opposition to look out\". He led the league with 73 penalty minutes in 1945–46, and in the late 1940s, his rivalry with Milt Schmidt of the Boston Bruins was so intense that their physical interactions occasionally overshadowed the games themselves.\nStewart hated his nickname of \"Black Jack\", as he believed it made him out to be a dirty player. Hockey Hall of Fame defenceman King Clancy agreed he was not dirty, but stated he was the \"roughest son of a gun you'd ever want to meet.\" Stewart's style of play resulted in numerous injuries; he had dozens of scars and required over 200 stitches to close various cuts during his career. At one point he played a full season with a broken hand using a cast formed to hold his stick.\nOn the ice, Stewart showed good judgment as a defenceman and rarely took himself out of position to throw a hit. His coach in Detroit, Jack Adams, called Stewart \"one of the best blueliners in the game\", and claimed he was the best defenceman in Red Wings history. Regarded as a good skater, he was able to clear the puck out of his zone and rarely turned it over to the other team. Clare Martin said he was a \"defensive defenceman\" and that he \"didn't carry the puck too much ... His job was defence and everybody in the league knew it.\"\nA charter member of the Detroit Red Wings Hall of Fame in 1944, Stewart was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1964. He is also an honoured member of the Michigan Sports, Manitoba Hockey and Sports Halls of Fame. He was named to the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame's First All-Century Team in 2000.\nPersonal life.\nStewart was born May 6, 1917, in Pilot Mound, Manitoba, where he learned to play hockey on the community's outdoor rinks. He had three sisters. In the off-seasons, he returned to his family farm, work which was said to have given him the strength he displayed in the NHL. An avid sportsman, Stewart was an active curler during his playing career, and played softball in the summer. Though he was regarded on the ice as one of toughest players in the game, he was also quiet. He was known as \"Silent Jack\" by his teammates, allowing his actions to speak for him.\nUpon leaving hockey in 1963, he focused on a career in harness racing. Stewart's father built a track on the family farm and held a horse racing meet each year to entertain the residents of Pilot Mound. He also followed and assisted his father when the elder Stewart acted as a race judge at fairs held in Manitoba. Stewart was actively involved in the sport from the time he retired as a player. He worked as a race timer and held various judging roles during the summers. He was a judge with the Ontario Racing Commission for nearly 30 years where his reputation matched that of his playing days.\nStewart retired to Florida but returned to Michigan to undergo treatment for cancer. He died on May 6, 1983, at his home in Troy following a lengthy battle with the disease. A widower, he was survived by two children, son Barclay and daughter Jaqueline.\nIn 2010, the new Pilot Mound Arena was named The 'Black Jack Stewart Arena'."

        "text": "The New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL) is a 13-team collegiate summer baseball wooden bat league founded in 1993 and sanctioned by the NCAA and Major League Baseball. Each NECBL team plays an eight-week, 44-game schedule during June and July, with a playoff in early August. Like the Cape Cod Baseball League and other amateur leagues, the NECBL is a showcase for top college-level players, giving professional baseball scouts a chance to see prospective pros playing against each other. Along with the Cape Cod Baseball League, Northwoods League, and Coastal Plain League, it is considered one of the top summer leagues in the country and is a part of the National Alliance of College Summer Baseball. In 2019, the Collegiate Summer Baseball Register ranked the NECBL as the 2nd best collegiate summer baseball league, behind only the Cape Cod League.\nFounded in 1993, the NECBL began its direction under George Foster, former Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets All-Star and Major League Baseball home run leader, and Emmy Award-winning television producer/director Joseph Consentino. Play started in 1994 and today the NECBL plays in all six New England states. It recruits players attending U.S. colleges from New England, the other 44 states, and foreign countries, provided that they come from NCAA-sanctioned colleges or universities, are in good academic standing, have completed at least one year of athletic eligibility, and have at least one year of eligibility remaining.\nThe NECBL's current commissioner is Sean McGrath, former general manager of the North Adams SteepleCats. McGrath replaced Mario Tiani, who retired following the 2012 season.\nLeague structure.\nThe NECBL became a 13-team league in 2013 with the addition of teams in Rhode Island (Ocean State Waves), Massachusetts (Plymouth Pilgrims) and New York (Saratoga Brigade) (the league's first team to operate outside New England), but reverted to 12 teams after the Brigade folded. On October 30, 2015, the league announced that the Upper Valley Nighthawks would begin play in 2016 in Hartford, Vermont, bringing the league back to 13 teams. The Plymouth Pilgrims ceased operations after the 2018 season but were replaced by the Martha's Vineyard Sharks, a former member of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL). The New Bedford BaySox ceased after the 2019 season, replaced by the Bristol Blues, who also moved from the FCBL. The North Shore Navigators returned to the league in 2021 after nine years in the FCBL.\nSeason structure.\nIn the 2021 season, the league was divided into two seven-team divisions, the North Division and the South Division. During the regular season, teams played 44 regular-season games, solely against division opponents, because of COVID-19 travel concerns. Scheduled doubleheaders were seven-inning games.\nThe top four teams from each division qualified for the eight-team playoff bracket, in which teams played best-of-three series to determine the champion.\nFor 2022, the NECBL went to three divisions, with a single pair of games against each out-of-division team. The league retained the three-division format for the 2023 season.\nPast champions.\nIn the NECBL's history, the most successful team is the Newport Gulls, with seven league championships and twelve championship series appearances (including one championship appearance as the Cranston, Rhode Island-based Rhode Island Gulls). The Keene Swamp Bats are next with five league titles and the North Shore Navigators have four.\nAll-Star Game.\nThe All-Star Game usually takes place from mid- to late July. Prior to the game a Home Run Derby is held and, since the 2007 All-Star Game, a Special Skill Competition for Most Accurate Arm and Fastest Runner.\nNotable alumni.\nThe following former NECBL players have gone on to play in Major League Baseball. Former NECBL players have reached the major league rosters of all thirty MLB teams, the thirtieth team being the Philadelphia Phillies when, in September 2015, Brian Bogusevic debuted with the team.\nMedia.\nAll NECBL games are broadcast online through the NECBL Broadcast Network from Blueframe, with Pointstreak providing live stats for all games.\nOn May 14, 2010, the league signed an agreement with Pointstreak. Pointstreak provides \"real-time scoring, official statistics, and administration services\" to the NECBL. A highlight of Pointstreak's services is Game Live, a real-time statistics feature providing play-by-play for every NECBL game.\nIn 2020, the league announced that Blueframe would provide the official streaming service for the league."

He played all or parts of six seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Mets, Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros. He is best known for having lost 27 consecutive games in which he had a decision, setting an MLB record.\nCareer.\nYoung attended Furr High School in Houston, Texas, and the University of Houston, where he played college baseball and college football for the Houston Cougars. The New York Mets selected Young in the 38th round of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft. He worked his way up through their minor league system, making his major league debut as a relief pitcher on August 5, 1991.\nWhile with the Mets, from May 6, 1992, to July 24, 1993, he lost 27 consecutive decisions. This losing streak is the longest in MLB history, breaking the mark of 23 set by Cliff Curtis in 1910–11. During the losing streak, Young converted 12 straight save opportunities and threw consecutive scoreless innings while filling in for Mets closer John Franco. During the streak, Young was 0–14 as a starter and 0–13 as a reliever. The streak ended on July 28, 1993, when he earned his first win since April 19, 1992.\nOver roughly the same time period from April 14, 1992, to May 1, 1994, Young—as a Met and later a Cub—made 27 consecutive starts without a win. He made 13 quality starts among those 27, but his teams went 4–23 in those games. Before the 1994 season, the Mets traded Young and minor leaguer Ottis Smith to the Chicago Cubs for José Vizcaíno. He signed with the Houston Astros for the 1996 season. For his career, he finished with a record of 15 wins and 48 losses for a winning percentage of .238.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retiring, Young worked for eight years in a chemical plant. He also coached youth leagues and offered pitching lessons in Kingwood, Texas. He was the father of three.\nIn January 2017, Young revealed that he had been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. Doctors were unsure at the time if the tumor was malignant. He underwent chemotherapy and reported in February that the tumor had shrunk. On June 27, 2017, his ex-teammate, Lenny Harris, reported on social media that Young was in a coma. Later that day, Young died at the age of 51. He is buried in Forest Park Lawndale Cemetery in Houston."

        "title": "Mario Soto (baseball)",
        "text": "Mario Melvin Soto (born July 12, 1956) is a Dominican former pitcher, mostly as a starter, for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball (MLB) from through . He currently works in the Reds' front office.\nCareer.\nFor most of his career, the Dominican right-hander was essentially a two-pitch pitcher. He possessed a hard fastball (clocked in the low-to-mid 90s) and complemented it with a baffling circle changeup, both thrown from the three-quarters position. Soto's changeup was particularly effective against left-handed hitters. On occasion, Soto would also throw a slider, which he turned to more in the latter stage of his career. He less frequently threw a curveball.\nFrom to , Soto struck out 1,063 batters.\nOn May 12, , Soto came very close to throwing a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. However, with two out in the top of the ninth inning and the Reds up 1–0, outfielder George Hendrick spoiled the no-hitter with a game-tying solo home run. The Reds won the game for Soto in the bottom of the ninth, 2–1.\nIn , Soto finished second in voting for the National League's Cy Young Award. Philadelphia's John Denny was the winner. Statistically, 1983 and 1984 were Soto's best seasons. He compiled a 35–20 record with a 2.92 earned run average and he established himself as the ace of the Cincinnati Reds' rotation. However, the Reds finished with losing records in both seasons.\nIn a 12-season career, all for Cincinnati, he was 100–92 with a 3.47 ERA in 297 games, 224 of them starts. He had 72 career complete games and 13 shutouts. He allowed 1,395 hits, 667 earned runs, 657 bases on balls and struck out 1,449 batters in 1,730 innings pitched. He also earned four saves (all during the 1980 season).\nBy 1986, Soto's performance had rapidly deteriorated due to shoulder injury. On April 29, 1986, against the Montreal Expos, Soto became the 11th pitcher in major league history to surrender four home runs in an inning.\nControversy.\nOn May 27, 1984, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, third baseman Ron Cey hit what was originally ruled a home run down the left field line. Believing the ball had gone foul, Soto and Reds manager Vern Rapp disputed the call, and during the argument, Soto shoved third-base umpire Steve Rippley, who had made the call. After conferring, the umpires changed their decision and ruled it a foul ball, drawing a protest from the Cubs. However, for shoving Rippley, Soto was ejected, prompting him to charge the field. Cubs coach Don Zimmer stepped in front of Rippley to prevent Soto from attacking the umpire, only to himself be tackled by Soto and (inadvertently) catcher Brad Gulden, which triggered a 10-minute brawl. Four days later, National League president Chub Feeney suspended Mario Soto for five games.\nIn the second incident, on June 16, the Reds were playing the Atlanta Braves in Atlanta. Braves player Claudell Washington homered in the first inning off Soto. During Washington's second at-bat, Soto threw near Washington's chin and sent him to the ground, but Washington only stared at Soto. On Soto's first pitch of Washington's third at bat, Washington swung and let go of his bat in the direction of first base and walked toward the mound. Umpire Lanny Harris attempted to intervene, but Washington threw Harris to the ground as he lunged toward Soto. Soto punched Washington with the baseball in his hand, and both benches cleared. Reds catcher Dann Bilardello wrestled Washington to the ground and Soto threw the ball at Washington, but he struck Braves coach Joe Pignatano's shin instead. Soto was suspended five games and $5,000, and Washington received a three-game suspension and a $1,000 fine.\nLater years.\nIn 2001, Soto was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum. He has also worked with the team as a pitching coach, helping several Reds pitchers develop a change-up. He currently works in the Reds' front office. Soto is credited as the person who taught Edinson Vólquez and Johnny Cueto their change-ups, which have been go-to strikeout pitches in their careers."

        "text": "Ransom Joseph \"Randy\" Jackson (February 10, 1926 – March 20, 2019) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) player for the Chicago Cubs (1950–1955, 1959), Dodgers (1956–1958; two seasons in Brooklyn, one in Los Angeles), and Cleveland Indians (1958–1959). A book on Jackson’s career, \"Handsome Ransom Jackson: Accidental Big Leaguer\", was published in 2016. He died at his home on March 20, 2019.\nBefore Major League Baseball.\nAfter a year at the University of Arkansas, he transferred twice, and helped lead the football teams of Texas Christian University (1945) and the University of Texas at Austin (1946) to consecutive Cotton Bowl Classic appearances as a halfback. Playing baseball in college he hit .500, .438 and .400.\nMLB career.\nThe Chicago Cubs signed him in 1947. On 2 May 1950, the 24-year-old made his major-league debut. \"Handsome Ransom\" had four solid seasons at third base for the Cubs from 1951 to 1955.\nJackson followed up a slow rookie season (in which he had 111 at-bats over 34 games) with a solid second season, in which he hit .276 with 76 RBI and 16 home runs. He struggled again in his third major-league season, his average falling to .232, with 34 RBI and 9 home runs.\nJackson rebounded over the next three seasons, posting batting averages of .285 (1953), .273 (1954), and .265 (1955). His RBI (66, 67, and 70) and home run (19, 19, and 21) totals also rebounded. Nor did his defensive play lag behind: in 1955, Jackson led the National League (NL) in double plays.\nHis hitting and excellent play at third earned him consecutive trips to the All-Star Game in his last two seasons in Chicago. In the 1954 game he came off the bench behind starter Ray Jablonski of the St. Louis Cardinals, in an 11–9 loss to the American League (AL). The next season, 1955, he again came off the bench, in a 6–5 win for the National League, behind the Milwaukee Braves' Eddie Mathews.\nOn the strength of Jackson's five continuous seasons in Chicago, the Dodgers, looking for a replacement for their aging All-Star third baseman Jackie Robinson, traded Don Hoak, Russ Meyer and Walt Moryn to the Cubs for Jackson and Don Elston.\nJackson played off the bench behind Robinson in 1956. Despite having over 200 fewer plate appearances than in his previous year, he managed a .274 average with 8 home runs and 53 RBI. The Dodgers played in the famed \"subway Series\" against their hated cross-town rivals, the New York Yankees in the 1956 World Series, but Jackson had only three pinch-hit at-bats, going 0-for-3, with two strike-outs.\nThe following season (1957), Jackson suffered a major knee injury, ending his chances to become a star for the Dodgers. He played off the bench, not appearing in more than 64 games in a season for the rest of his career. He totaled only eight more home runs and 43 RBIs combined for the next three seasons."

        "title": "Hit and run (baseball)",
        "text": "A hit and run is a high risk, high reward offensive strategy used in baseball. It uses a stolen base attempt to try to place the defending infielders out of position for an attempted base hit.\nThe hit and run was introduced to baseball by Ned Hanlon, who was often referred to as \"The Father of Modern Baseball\", at the beginning of the 1894 season of the National League, as part of what came to be called \"inside baseball\". Hanlon was manager of the Baltimore Orioles at the time. His team developed the hit and run along with other tactics during spring training at Macon, Georgia. After its implementation in the season's series opener against the New York Giants, the opposing manager objected to its use; however, it was deemed acceptable.\nDescription.\nThe hit and run relies on the positioning of the defensive players in the infield. The first and third basemen normally stand near the foul lines, generally near the inside of their bases, set slightly back to allow more time to react to sharply hit balls. However, if the runner is on first, the first baseman stands closer to the base to prevent steals by means of pickoff attempts by the pitcher; consequently, such positioning produces a bigger gap between second and first basemen. The second baseman and shortstop stand on opposite sides of second base, covering the areas between first and second, and second and third, respectively. Second base itself is not directly covered, as the pitcher can field batted balls in this direction.\nIn normal play, if the ball is hit into the infield, one of the infielders will run toward the ball while another runs toward the base that is no longer covered. For instance, if the ball is hit toward the second baseman, he will run toward the ball while the shortstop runs to cover second base. This allows the fielding player to throw the ball to the player covering the base to attempt a put out.\nHowever, during a stolen base attempt, the normal gameplay and positioning is altered. In the typical case, a baserunner on first base will start running toward second, causing the middle infielders to move toward that base in order to tag the runner when the ball is thrown to them from the pitcher or catcher. This reaction places the infielders out of position for a hit ball, with gaps opening at midway points between first and second and second and third.\nThe hit and run takes advantage of this difference by having the baserunner attempt to steal as soon as the pitch is thrown; the batter then attempts to hit the ball into one of the resulting gaps in the infield defense.\nThe name \"hit and run\" is therefore a potential misnomer in that the chronological order of the offensive play is \"run and hit,\" with the runner beginning the steal attempt before the batter makes contact, although in a logical sense it is accurate in that the batter's swing occurs while the runner's steal attempt is ongoing, such that any contact (\"hit\") will occur simultaneously with (\"and\") the steal attempt (\"run\").\nIdeally, the ball will be hit into a gap and travel into the outfield, allowing the runners plenty of time to reach the bases. Even if the ball is hit toward a fielder's initial position before the fielder has had time to move away from it, however, the fielder may have turned to run toward the base in order to cover the baserunner. In normal play the fielders would face the batter, allowing them to react in any direction, but after they have turned toward the base this becomes much more difficult. Their momentum in this direction adds to this problem.\nThe hit and run also has defensive qualities. In normal play the baserunner would start toward second base when the ball was hit. If the defensive players react fast enough, they may be able to throw the ball to second and first before either runner has reached their base, resulting in a double play. In the case of the hit and run, the baserunner has a head start, increasing the baserunner's probability of reaching second base before the ball. This may force the fielders to attempt the out only at first, thereby advancing the runner. It may also allow the runner to advance more bases on a hit than he might otherwise due to that running head start. Although a line drive can easily turn into a double play, line drives are rare so the risk of being doubled off from a line drive is minimal.\nThe risk in the hit and run is that, if the batter fails to make contact with the ball, the runner is vulnerable to being thrown out at second base, which the official scorer will record as a caught stealing. The defensive team can improve its odds in this case by using a pitchout, having the pitcher throw the ball far outside the strike zone so the catcher can easily catch it and attempt to pick off the runner.\nThe batter may choose to take a swing at a bad pitch to make it harder for the catcher to handle the incoming pitch, or so the ball goes foul (in which case the runner is allowed to return to first, so the attempt protects the runner from being caught stealing). Either way, this can cause the batter to fall behind in the count, making it harder for him to get a hit. And if he does hit a bad pitch he really can't handle, it could result in poor contact leading directly to the batter being put out, so he may end up giving his at-bat away with no advantage to the offense.\nThe hit and run has the best chance to be successful when the batter is someone who does not frequently swing and miss, at a time when the count won't disadvantage a hitter if he takes a bad swing, with a runner fast enough to take second base even if the batter does swing and miss.\nOften the precise circumstance to call for a hit and run occurs with a two-balls, one-strike count on a hitter, as this situation may meet all of the above criteria, depending on who is at bat and who is on base, but it can occur at other times. An alert defense understands the probability that the offense will call the play at a specific moment, and thus it may choose to call for a pitchout at that moment to defend it. An alert offense, in turn, understands the probability of a forthcoming pitchout, and use the hit and run opportunity as a decoy, causing the pitchout to become another ball in the count in the hitter's favor, increasing his chances of reaching base by walk or hit.\nThe hit and run is a very old baseball strategy, dating back to the 19th-century game."

There was a meeting between Tait, his two agents and Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson, wherein Tait and his agents left. Shortly afterward Tait signed an offer sheet for five years.\nIn a 2002 game against the Cleveland Browns Tait was involved in an unusual play that helped his team win the game 40 to 39. With only a few seconds remaining and trailing by 2 points, Quarterback Trent Green was attempting to throw a Hail Mary pass but was flushed out of the passing pocket, with the game on the line and opposition players having grabbed him Green desperately lobbed the ball backwards where Tait happened to be standing. Tait caught the ball and proceeded to make a 36 yard rush upfield before being forced out of bounds. Ordinarily this would have been the end of the game but Dwayne Rudd had thrown his helmet off in a premature celebration, a defensive penalty that extended the game by one untimed down. Tait's run combined with the penalty yardage enabled Morten Andersen to attempt and make a 30 yard field goal for the win.\nAt the end of Tait's contract with the Chiefs the team put a transition tag on him. This gave the Chiefs a right of first refusal over an offer from other team but ultimately ended with Tait leaving the team.\nChicago Bears.\nTait signed with the Chicago Bears in 2004. His contract was for six years and $34 million. On February 21, 2009, Tait announced his retirement."

        "title": "Juan Pizarro (baseball)",
        "text": "Juan Ramón Pizarro a.k.a. \"Terín\" (February 7, 1937 – February 18, 2021) was a Puerto Rican Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. He played for 18 seasons on 9 teams, from 1957 through 1974. In 1964, he won 19 games (19–9) and pitched 4 shutouts for the Chicago White Sox. He was selected for the Major League All-Star Baseball game in 1963 and 1964.\nEarly years.\nPizarro (birth name:Juan Ramon Pizarro Cordova ) was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He began his baseball career in 1955 in Puerto Rico as a pitcher for the \"Cangrejeros de Santurce\". During the 1957–1958 Winter League of Puerto Rico of the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Baseball League), he played for the \"Criollos de Caguas\" and was selected as the Most Valuable Player of the season. From 1959 to 1960 he pitched for the last time in Puerto Rico for the \"Cangrejeros del Santurce\".\nMilwaukee Braves.\nPizarro signed with the Milwaukee Braves as an amateur free agent in 1956. After going 27–6 with a 2.06 earned run average in the minors, he made his major league debut on May 4, 1957, against the Pittsburgh Pirates at 20 years of age. He pitched seven strong innings, giving up only one run, however, the Braves managed only two hits off opposing pitcher Vern Law, and Pizarro lost his debut, 1–0. For the season, he went 5–6 with a 4.62 ERA. The Braves beat the New York Yankees in a seven-game World Series that year; Pizarro's only appearance came in Milwaukee's 12–3 loss in game three.\nHe split 1958 between Milwaukee and the triple A Wichita Braves, and was again included on the Braves' post-season roster as they faced the Yankees in the World Series for the second year in a row. This time the Yankees won the Series in seven games. Pizarro's only appearance again came in a loss in game five.\nPizarro remained with the Braves through 1960, compiling a 23–19 record and 3.93 ERA in Milwaukee. On December 15, 1960, he was traded with Joey Jay to the Cincinnati Reds for Roy McMillan, then immediately sent by the Reds with Cal McLish to the Chicago White Sox for Gene Freese.\nChicago White Sox.\nPizarro enjoyed his greatest success as a member of the White Sox. In 1961, despite being the youngest pitcher in the starting rotation, Pizarro emerged as the staff's ace, leading the Chisox with fourteen wins, 188 strikeouts and 194.2 innings pitched. He also made fourteen appearances out of the bullpen, and earned his first career save on August 27. He was given the opening day nod in 1962, and pitched a complete game 2–1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels. In 1963, he was named to the American League All-Star roster, and pitched a scoreless seventh inning during the All-Star Game.\nPizarro's best season was 1964, when he went 19–9 with a 2.56 ERA and four shutouts. Coincidentally, it was also his best season with the bat, as he batted .211 with a career high three home runs and career high 15 runs batted in.\nFrom there, things rapidly deteriorated for him. Injuries limited Pizarro to just eighteen starts in 1965. In 1966, he was used primarily in relief. Despite a respectable 8–6 record and 3.76 ERA in 34 appearances, he pitched only 88.2 innings. Following the season, he was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nJourneyman.\nThough he made nine starts for the 1967 Pirates, he was mainly a relief pitcher, earning a career high nine saves. He was limited to \"mop up duty\" by manager Larry Shepard in 1968. He appeared in twelve games with the Pirates prior to being placed on waivers; eleven were losses. The one win, Pizarro entered the game with the Pirates trailing, and earned the win himself.\nThe Boston Red Sox claimed Pizarro off waivers on June 27. He was used primarily as a starter in Boston, going 6–6 with six complete games as a starter. He also earned two saves for the Bosox. He was traded along with Ken Harrelson and Dick Ellsworth from the Red Sox to the Cleveland Indians for Sonny Siebert, Vicente Romo and Joe Azcue on April 19, . Toward the end of the season, he was placed on waivers and claimed by the Oakland Athletics.\nAfter beginning the 1970 season with Oakland's triple A affiliate, Pizarro was released and signed a minor league contract with the California Angels. He was 9–0 for the Hawaii Islanders when the Angels dealt him to the Chicago Cubs for Archie Reynolds.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn September 11, 1971, he shut out the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field. In his next start, he shutout Tom Seaver and the New York Mets 1–0 at Shea Stadium. The one run was a solo shot by Pizarro in the eighth inning. Seaver had won seven in a row at that point. His previous loss came on August 1, also courtesy of a complete game by Pizarro. It would be more than 40 years before another starting pitcher broke a scoreless tie by hitting a home run in the eighth inning or later: Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers did this, also in the eighth inning, on Opening Day 2013.\nFor the 1971 season, Pizarro went 7–6 with a 3.46 ERA. He was 4–5 with a 3.94 ERA in 1972. He spent most of the first half of the 1973 season assigned to the Cubs' triple A affiliate, the Wichita Aeros. After a blown save against the Atlanta Braves on June 17, Pizarro was placed on waivers. He was claimed by the Houston Astros on July 8.\nReturn to the post season.\nPizarro was 2–2 with a 6.56 ERA out of Houston's bullpen in 1973. He was released the following Spring, and rejoined the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates won the National League East by a game and a half over the St. Louis Cardinals, allowing Pizarro to return to the post season for the first time since 1958. His only appearance in the 1974 National League Championship Series came in the fourth game, which the Los Angeles Dodgers won to head to the 1974 World Series.\nDeath.\nPizarro died on February 18, 2021.\nLegacy.\nLooking at his entire professional career, Pizarro won more than 400 ballgames. His regular-season count is 392: 197 in the US (131 in the majors and 66 in the minors), plus 38 more in Mexico in his late 30s and 157 while playing winter ball in his homeland. His final record in Puerto Rico was 157–110, with a superb 2.51 ERA. Only Rubén Gómez had more wins (174, and he needed 29 seasons to do it). Pizarro pitched 2,403 innings, again second behind Gomez, and allowed just 1,980 hits. He is the PRWL's all-time leader in strikeouts (1,804) and shutouts (46), marks that will almost certainly never be challenged.\nPizarro was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Caribbean Confederation and the Puerto Rican Sports Hall of Fame.\nMajor-league career stats.\nPizarro had a .202 lifetime batting average (133–658) with 8 home runs, 72 runs scored and 66 RBIs.\nExternal links.\n, or Baseball Almanac"

        "text": "John Arlington Butterfield (August 1, 1919 – October 16, 2010) was a Canadian professional ice hockey administrator and the president of the American Hockey League, serving the longest tenure of any AHL executive (28 years, from 1966 to 1994). After his retirement as president, he served as the AHL's chairman of the board until his death and continued to oversee the creation of the annual regular-season schedules for the league. He was born in Regina, Saskatchewan.\nCareer.\nAfter leaving the University of Alberta and being wounded in action while serving as a Wellington bomber pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II, and before serving as a league official, Butterfield worked for his uncle Eddie Shore's New Haven Eagles and Springfield Indians teams as a public relations executive and trainer. He subsequently held management positions in the Pacific Coast Hockey League and the United States Hockey League before returning to the Indians, serving as a rink manager and trainer before rising to become the team's general manager. He was the general manager when the Indians won three consecutive Calder Cup championships in 1960, 1961 and 1962, a feat as yet unmatched in the AHL.\nUpon becoming AHL President in 1966, Butterfield was instrumental in establishing the AHL as the primary minor league for the National Hockey League through restructuring of the basic affiliation agreement with the NHL. This agreement would help the league survive when expansion and the World Hockey Association came into being, and Butterfield's acumen became respected enough so that his views were sought by the NHL Rules Committee. He was responsible for moving the league offices to the Springfield area, where they remain to this day.\nButterfield guided the AHL through the 1970s, helping the league survive several rounds of NHL expansion and the appearance and disappearance of the WHA.\nElected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1980 in the Builders' category, Butterfield twice won the James C. Hendy Memorial Award as the AHL's outstanding executive (1971, 1984) and the NHL's Lester Patrick Trophy in 1985 for service to hockey in the United States. He was further honored by having the award for the most valuable player in the AHL playoffs named after him in 1984 and being named as one of the inaugural members of the AHL's Hall of Fame in 2006. Butterfield was also the first recipient of the Thomas Ebright Memorial Award in 1998 for outstanding contributions to the AHL.\n\"The American Hockey League would not exist today were it not for the efforts of Jack Butterfield during his tenure as president. He is a hockey legend and his contributions will forever be honored by the AHL,\" according to then-AHL President David Andrews, commenting after Butterfield's death.\nButterfield remained active in the community in retirement, serving on the board of the Springfield Shriner’s Hospital and as vice-chairman of the local March of Dimes. He died in Springfield, Massachusetts, on October 16, 2010."

        "title": "Rugby union in Cornwall",
        "text": "Rugby union in Cornwall () is Cornwall's most popular spectator sport with a large following. The followers of the national side are dubbed Trelawny's Army. In 1991 and 1999 Cornwall won the County Championship final played at Twickenham Stadium, beating Yorkshire and Gloucestershire respectively to win the Cup. They had another strong spell in the 2010s, reaching seven of the eight finals contested between 2013 and 2022 (meeting either Cheshire or Lancashire on every occasion), winning four of them. \nCornish rugby has produced many fine players who have played at the international level, including Phil Vickery, Trevor Woodman and Graham Dawe (England), Stack Stevens (England and British and Irish Lions), Andy Reed (Scotland and the Lions), and many others.\nThe Cornish rugby team can also boast an Olympic silver medal: in 1908, they won the County Championship for the first time and the prize was to represent Great Britain at rugby in the 1908 Olympic Games. They lost to Australia 32–3 in the final, and remain the only county side to represent Great Britain at rugby in the Olympics.\nCRFU.\nThe Cornwall Rugby Football Union (CRFU) was formed in 1883. It is a union of 37 rugby union clubs which includes most rugby union clubs in Cornwall (St Columba and Torpoint RFC is a member of the Devon Rugby Football Union), the open-age Cornwall representative side and representative teams at various age groups. The CRFU are members of the Rugby Football Union (RFU), the governing body for rugby union in England. The CRFU organises three annual knockout cup competitions – the Cornwall Super Cup, Cornwall Cup and Cornwall Clubs Cup, with the Cornwall Cup stretching back to 1967. The Cornwall Super Cup is played between the Launceston and Redruth (doubling up as National League 2 South league games between the sides), the Cornwall Cup is for teams based between tiers 6 and 12 in the English league system and finally the Cornwall Clubs Cup is for teams in the regional Cornish leagues. The Cornwall Cup used to be the premier competition with the top sides such as the Cornish Pirates, Launceston, Mounts Bay and Redruth taking part but has been superseded in recent years by the Super Cup, itself downsized to just the two teams due to the demands of the modern game both in terms of fixture congestion and the increased physical toll on players. All cups are currently sponsored by Tribute Ales.\nHistory.\nThe Cornish rugby tradition has deep roots, stretching back before the game was even codified. A form of folk football, known as Cornish hurling was highly popular there, and is still played in two towns in Cornwall. It is possible that the former popularity of this game paved the way for the rugby code. Their rugby jerseys with gold and black hoops were introduced in 1885.\nCornish Rugby has had the honour to have played host to many international touring rugby teams over the years including New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand Māori, France, Romania, the USA, Canada, Japan and the Soviet Union.\nOne of the most important times of the year in a Cornish rugby fan's calendar is the County Championship. Like the 1900 games, three teams entered: Australasia (representing Australia and New Zealand), France, and Great Britain (which included the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). France pulled themselves from the event prior to the commencement of the tournament, being unable to field a representative team. Cornwall won the championship for the first time in 1908, when they played in front of 17,000 fans at Redruth. The game was against Durham, also known for its mining, this time coal not tin. Cornwall won the game 17–3, scoring 5 tries. The added incentive for the winner was the chance to represent Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics. The choice of Cornwall was controversial, as only three of their players had ever represented England, as well as the fact that Australia, who had been on a tour of the United Kingdom, had defeated them 18 points to five.\nTwo other countries entered the 1908 Summer Olympics, France and Australasia, the name of a combined team from Australia and New Zealand. France withdrew before the tournament which left Great Britain (Cornwall) playing Australasia. The final score was 32–3 to Australasia with Bert Solomon managing to score a try for Great Britain.\nAustralasia's team, the Wallabies, was already on tour in Britain, while the best Anglo-Welsh players were on tour in New Zealand at the time. Great Britain was therefore represented by the Cornwall county team, who were chosen by the RFU as an appropriate side after they defeated Durham in the 1907 English county championship.\nAs expected, Australasia defeated Great Britain, claiming the gold medal, the score being 32 points to three. The match at the White City Stadium was played under poor conditions, in fog and with a slippery field.\nCornwall reached the Championship final again in 1909, 1928, 1958, 1969 and 1989 but had to wait until 1991 before re-claiming the trophy. In a final that most Cornish fans will remember forever, Cornwall played Yorkshire at Twickenham in front of 54,000 fans, the majority of which were supporting Cornwall. In a game that had everything, Cornwall found themselves trailing at 16-3 down after 54 minutes, having been tricked when Yorkshire ran a penalty that the Cornish believed they had indicated to kick. Cornwall fought back to draw level at 16-16 after 80 minutes, and even missed the conversion that would have given them victory in normal time. The game then went into extra time when Cornwall managed to continue their scoring. The final score was 29–20 to Cornwall which sent the fans into a state of total elation. Richard Nanckivell's two tries were the inspiration that they could win and Tommy Bassett and Billy Peters put the icing on the cake in extra-time for Cornwall's first title since 1908. Cornwall managed to reach the final again in both 1992 and 1998, losing both, and it was not until 1999 when they met Gloucester in the final that Cornwall managed to win the Championship again.\nCornwall play most of their home games at Redruth R.F.C. and Camborne RFC but matches have also been played at Penzance &amp; Newlyn and Launceston.\nThe premier club side in Cornwall are the Cornish Pirates (recently renamed from Penzance &amp; Newlyn RFC) who play in the RFU Championship. They are hoping to increase their fanbase by appealing to Cornish nationalist sentiment to help them gain promotion to the Aviva Premiership. Launceston Rugby Club (\"The Cornish All Blacks\") have recently (2007 season) been promoted to the National Division One. Redruth R.F.C. (\"The Reds\") play in National Division Two and also get good support. Mount's Bay have this season 2007–08 began their campaign in National Division Three, South, leading the league for the entire season they are at season end promoted to National Division Two for the 2008/09 season. The other major Cornish club sides who play in the South West 1, 2 West, Western Counties West and Cornwall &amp; Devon leagues are Bude, Camborne, Falmouth, Hayle, Newquay Hornets Penryn, St Austell, St. Ives, Saltash, Truro and Wadebridge Camels.\nMotto.\nFethy Po Fyllel An Gwarry Ha Tra Nahen! (Cornish for \"Win or Lose, The Game and Nothing Else\" !)\n1908 Centenary celebration match.\nAs part of the centenary celebrations, the British Olympic Association arranged a match between Australia and the Barbarians which was held at Wembley Stadium on 3 December 2008. The Barbarian players, who normally wear their club socks, all wore black and gold socks to represent Cornwall, in a game which Australia won 11–8.\nCounty Championship finals.\nAs of 2022 Cornwall have won the Bill Beaumont Cup (County Championship) seven times: 1908, 1991, 1999, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2022.\nSince 1984 the finals have been played at Twickenham:\nAffiliated clubs.\nThere are currently 37 clubs affiliated with the union, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level.\nCornwall club competitions.\nThe Cornwall RFU currently runs the following competitions for clubs in Cornwall:"

Over the course of the summer, they played one Twenty20 International, a triangular ODI tournament with both Bangladesh and England, a one-day tournament with England, and five Test matches, the outcome of which would decide The Ashes. With Australia the top-ranked team in the World Test table, and England the second-ranked, this was the most eagerly anticipated Ashes series since the 1980s.\nWarm-up matches.\nAustralia won their first two warm-up games, a Twenty20 game against the PCA Masters XI at Arundel and a 50-over game against Leicestershire emphatically. However, the tide turned as they lost their next matches, firstly by 100 runs against England in a Twenty20 game, followed by a remarkable defeat to Somerset in a very high scoring match at Taunton.\nOne-day International series.\nThe first international matches scheduled were as part of the Natwest Series against England and Bangladesh. In their first match, Australia lost to Bangladesh by five wickets in the last over, perhaps the biggest upset in recent memory. Just before that game Andrew Symonds was dropped for disciplinary reasons. The following day, Australia lost their second match in a row to England, due mainly to Kevin Pietersen's late batting onslaught. However, Australia remained undefeated throughout the rest of the series to tie a thrilling final against England at Lord's.\nAustralia's next tournament was a three match Natwest Challenge One-day International tournament against England. Despite losing the first match, they bounced back to take the series 2–1. After a drawn three-day match against Leicestershire, the main part of the tour – the Tests against England for The Ashes – were about to start.\nThe Ashes Tests.\nWith all the hype preceding Australia's arrival in England, especially Glenn McGrath's assertion that Australia would win 5–0, many people expected a good, tight contest, although Australia's fans predicted a clear overall victory. English fans were quietly confident that their strong run – winning 15 and drawing two of their last 18 Test matches – would continue and they could at least stand up to Australia, having lost the last eight Ashes series.\nFirst Test.\nWhat followed surprised everyone – England's hostile pace bowling ripped through Australia in the first Test, reducing them to 190 all out. However, Australia replied in style by skittling England for 155, with only Pietersen – playing in his Test debut – able to resist. During this innings, McGrath took his 500th Test wicket. Australia then fared considerably better in their second innings to win the first Test by 239 runs.\nSecond Test.\nAfter another drawn three-day match, this time against Worcestershire, came a pivotal moment of the series. While warming up for the second Test at Edgbaston, McGrath injured his ankle stepping on a cricket ball and was unable to play in the Test. At the last moment, Michael Kasprowicz was included in the team, but Australia had lost their bowling spearhead.\nHaving won the toss, the Australian captain, Ricky Ponting, decided to bowl first on a pitch suited for batting. England batted quickly and aggressively, scoring over 400 runs on the first day. England finished with a 99 run lead after the first innings, and although the Australians put up a fighting tail-end batting display on the fourth day (they needed 107 runs with only two wickets in hand at the end of the third day), England held on to win by two runs – the closest runs victory in Ashes history.\nThird Test.\nThe third Test match was held at Old Trafford, and again England took a large first innings lead, the England innings notable for Shane Warne taking his 600th Test wicket and Michael Vaughan scoring the first century of the series. Glenn McGrath had also returned from injury, returning the Australian side to full strength. Due to rain delays, the Australian first innings did not finish until the fourth day.\nEngland then set about scoring quickly in their second innings (with the aim of declaring and bowling Australia out to win), setting Australia 423 to win with only a day and 10 overs remaining. Ricky Ponting batted for seven hours on the final day to score the first Australian century of the series, but was dismissed with only four overs left and Australia's last two batsmen facing them. Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath managed to hang on for those four overs to salvage a draw for Australia, with England unable to take the last wicket.\nAustralia then played a two-day match against Northants, a drawn match in which Australia opted for batting practice instead of trying to force the win.\nFourth Test.\nFor the second time in less than a month, Glenn McGrath was ruled out of a test due to injury – this time with elbow problems. Australia also dropped Jason Gillespie from their side after taking just three wickets so far in the series. In contrast, England remained with their original starting XI from the first Test. They carried on their first innings form with their best of the series (477 all out), before England's bowlers managed to swing the ball prodigiously to leave Australia at 99/5 and 175/9. Despite the best efforts of Brett Lee, Australia finished 259 runs behind England and were asked to follow-on – for the first time in 17 years. However, with the need to bowl for two innings in a row, Simon Jones, England's best swing bowler, started showing signs of injury and was taken to hospital for a scan on his ankle. Australia were then able to post a target for England to chase, but on a wearing pitch with Shane Warne getting large amounts of turn, England struggled in their pursuit of 129, winning by three wickets in the end.\nAustralia then played a two-day match against Essex, in which Essex reached 500 in the first day before declaring, while Australia reached 500 on the second day. The match finished in a high-scoring draw, as no team was able to dismiss the other twice.\nFifth Test.\nFor the first time in the series, England made a change to their side – Simon Jones' ankle injury meant that England needed to replace him. With England 2–1 up with one to play, Australia needed a victory to level the series (and thus retain the Ashes). With this in mind, England decided to call up Paul Collingwood, an all-rounder and England's best fielder, rather than a like-for-like bowler.\nEngland won the toss and elected to bat, reaching 373 in their first innings. Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer then batted through to the end of the second day, coming off for bad light before the scheduled close of play. With Australia needing to force the victory, many were surprised at this move.\nThe third day was also affected by rain and bad light, with only half of the scheduled overs being bowled. Australia again came off early for bad light, but as they were only 96 runs behind England and still had eight wickets in hand, they were possibly hoping to establish a significant lead and bowl England out cheaply.\nAn Australian collapse after lunch on the fourth day meant England were actually leading by six runs after the first innings. With Australia needing to dismiss England and score more runs than them, England merely had to bat for as long as possible, denying Australia the time needed to force victory. Thanks to Kevin Pietersen's maiden Test century on the fifth day, and Paul Collingwood batting patiently for 10 runs in 51 minutes in the second innings, Australia were left with a target of 342 runs with only 19 overs remaining in the day. With Steve Harmison opening the bowling for England, Australia were offered the light in the first over of their second innings and accepted, leaving Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden to remove the bails at 18:17 BST to signal a drawn match and the series victory for England.\nDuring the presentations, Pietersen was voted man of the match for his innings of 158, while Andrew Flintoff and Shane Warne received the \"Man of the Series\" awards, nominated by the opposing team coaches (Duncan Fletcher for England and John Buchanan for Australia). In addition, Flintoff was awarded the inaugural Compton–Miller Medal for the overall \"Man of the Series\", nominated by the two chairmen of selectors, David Graveney and Trevor Hohns.\nMatches.\nLimited-overs games.\nPCA Masters XI v Australians (9 June).\nThe Australians beat the PCA Masters XI by 8 wickets\nThe 2005 Ashes tour started with the Australians taking on a Professional Cricketers' Association XI at the picturesque ground at Arundel in a Twenty20 game. A crowd of 11,000 turned up to see the tourists win with one ball to spare, although in practice the result was always clear after an opening partnership of 131 between Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. The Aussies got an ideal start as Stephen Fleming edged Brett Lee's first delivery to the slips and the Masters XI were 0 for 1, having been put in to bat by Australia. Darren Maddy made 70 in 57 balls and Paul Collingwood (38) and Mark Ealham (39) also scored runs, but the rest of the team made little impression as the PCA Masters XI made 167 for 6. The Aussies lost only two wickets in making their target. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nLeicestershire v Australians (11 June).\nThe Australians beat Leicestershire by 95 runs\nThe Australians put in a strong performance at Grace Road, with Matthew Hayden making 107 off 96 balls, Damien Martyn 85 off 103 and Andrew Symonds 92 off 59 as they made a huge 321 for 4 off their 50 overs. 72 of their runs came off the final 5 overs. Leicestershire never threatened in reply, with Ottis Gibson, who came in at 8, the only man to make 50. Gibson had earlier taken two wickets for Leicestershire, who finished well short of the target on 226 for 8. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nEngland v Australia (13 June).\nEngland started cautiously in the only Twenty20 International against Australia at the Rose Bowl, only hitting six runs off the first two overs as they saw off the bowlers, but Geraint Jones then decided to have fun with Brett Lee. Hitting two boundaries off the next over, Lee was hit for 14, and England moved rapidly to 28 for no loss before Jones cut McGrath to deep third man, where Kasprowicz took a catch on the boundary – out for 19 with four fours. Marcus Trescothick hit a single to end the over, but England were happy enough with 29 for 1 after four overs. Lee's next over was, again, hit for 14, as Lee served up one wide and a no-ball to end with three overs for 31 as singles were taken off every ball. That prompted a bowling change, with Michael Kasprowicz coming on for Australia, and with good reward, as the penultimate ball of his over was caught by Symonds at midwicket – Andrew Flintoff out for 6. Kevin Pietersen managed to scamper a single, and after six overs, England were 50 for 2.\nWith Jason Gillespie coming on, England continued to take the singles, although the fielding restrictions were off and Australia could stop more of those. However, Michael Clarke at deep backward point handed England three runs in the seventh over with a misfield. Pietersen continued to dominate the Australian bowling, smashing a four and a two off Gillespie, as England took ten runs off the eighth over. Australia looked clueless – a rare sight – as they continued to give runs away through misfields, and Kevin Pietersen smashed his way to 33 not out off 16 balls – after 10 overs, England were 93 for 2, and looking to set a massive target.\nThe Australian captain Ricky Ponting brought on part-time spinner Michael Clarke to bowl the 11th over, and got immediate success, when Pietersen launched him to Matthew Hayden on the fifth ball, but England were still 101 for 3 after 11 overs. In the next over, the new batsman Michael Vaughan edged Andrew Symonds' ball to midwicket, and the pressure was suddenly on the English. With Trescothick out for 41 a bit later to an attempted sweep off Symonds, England were suddenly looking down a hole after a fine start, and Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood slowed the scoring, to see England 111 for 5 with six overs to play. However, a slog sweep from Collingwood to end the 15th over turned the match again, as it went away for six and England moved to 124 for 5. With Jason Gillespie being brought back, Collingwood led the charge, as England stole 17 runs off the 17th over and wrought control of the game again. Despite Andrew Strauss being bowled by Gillespie for 18, Collingwood hit another two boundaries towards the end of the over, to move onto 42 not out and the team score to 167 for 6. Vikram Solanki was out in the next over for 9, caught by Hussey off McGrath, and on the last ball, Collingwood was caught by for 46. Still, England would be pleased with 179 for 8, the highest score on the Rose Bowl in Twenty20 matches.\nAustralia started shakily, with Adam Gilchrist playing-and-missing and edging one shot over Andrew Strauss at third man, who miscued the path of the ball, as the Australians got eight off the first over bowled by Darren Gough. With Gilchrist finally taking one liberty too many, an easy catch was given, and Kevin Pietersen took it to remove arguably the most dangerous batsman in this format. On the next ball, Hayden was out, caught by Pietersen for 6. Symonds survived the next ball, but odds had improved for England, as the visitors were now 23 for 2. What followed was an Australian collapse – Michael Clarke went for a golden duck to Lewis, a slightly dubious decision, but that gave the English the needed momentum. Within the next four overs, Australia had lost four more wickets for eight runs, Symonds for 0, Hussey for 1, Ponting for 0, Martyn for 4, and despite a recovery from Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee, the required run rate ran away to 12 an over from the last 11 overs. Jon Lewis finished his spell with four wickets for 24 – a special international debut, even though it was only in a Twenty20 game. Despite a good recovery and a partnership of 36, Gillespie eventually holed out a catch to Marcus Trescothick off the hero of the match, Paul Collingwood, and England headed even further towards a victory. Eventually, McGrath was bowled by Harmison, ending the innings for 79 all out – exactly the same score that England succumbed to in the fourth innings chase against the Australians in the first Test of the last Ashes.\nSomerset v Australians (15 June).\nSomerset won by four wickets\nSomerset shocked everyone with a nail-biting win over Australia at Taunton, their first win over the Australians since 1977. Somerset were placed mid-table in the second division of the National League, and no one believed they should have any chance against an Australian team only missing Adam Gilchrist. And Australia backed that up with the bat – Matthew Hayden retired after a fun hit-out for 76, captain Ricky Ponting the same for 80, and Australia tonked 342 for 5.\nGraeme Smith and Sanath Jayasuriya, however, fought back for Somerset. The pair opened, and put on 197 for the first wicket in little over 20 overs – Smith smashing his way to a massive 68-ball hundred, ending with 108 with 17 fours and a six. Jayasuriya, not wishing to be worse, made a 77-ball ton – before getting out for 101 a bit later. The platform was set, however, and 24-year-old James Hildreth could steady the ship after Somerset had lost some wickets to part-time bowler Michael Hussey. Hildreth made 38 not out off 24 balls and saw them to a victory with 19 balls and four wickets to spare – more comfortable than the match looked for the most part. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nAustralia v Bangladesh (18 June).\nPerhaps, the biggest upset in the history of One Day Internationals, Mashrafe Mortaza shocked the Sophia Gardens crowd when he had Adam Gilchrist plumb on the second ball of the second ODI, taking the first Australian wicket without a run yet on the scoreboard – and it was to set the tone of the match. Most people would have expected Australia to swamp Bangladesh, especially after the 10-wicket defeat the Bangladeshi Tigers endured in the opening match with England, but a maiden from Mortaza gave them some hope, at least. Things looked to be going the right way for Australia when Matthew Hayden took a boundary off Tapash Baisya, but another maiden followed, and in the sixth over Ricky Ponting padded up to Tapash Baisya – resulting in an lbw decision given, and Australia were 9 for 2. Cautious batting from Hayden and Damien Martyn followed, but some expensive bowling from Baisya relinquished the initiative, as Australia recovered. They survived through 15 overs, Hayden being caught off a no-ball from Tapash, but in the 16th, he was bowled by Nazmul Hossain for 37 off an inside edge, just as Hayden were looking to get himself in. Some economical bowling from Mohammad Rafique who bowled ten overs for 31 runs, along with excellent bowling from Mortaza at the death, resulted in Australia finishing on 249 for 5, losing Martyn to Baisya for 77 and Clarke to the same man for 54. In fact, Michael Hussey with 31 not out off 21 balls and Simon Katich with 36 not out off 23 ensured that they got a competitive target.\nThat was not all, however. The chase began very sedately, only Tushar Imran looking to take runs as he smashed Brad Hogg about, but Hogg got his revenge when Tushar was out for 24, lofting to Katich. Earlier, Nafees Iqbal had gone for 8, and with Javed Omar out as the third man to fall, for 19 off 51 balls, it looked to be business as usual for Bangladesh. But this match had more tricks up its sleeve. Hogg and Clarke leaked runs like a drain, six wides were bowled, and Mohammad Ashraful showed another glimpse of why he's been called Bangladesh's finest batsman. As he made the second ODI hundred in the Bangladesh team's history, he forged a massive 130-run partnership with Habibul Bashar, and had a great two hours at the crease (although dropped on 54) – before picking out Jason Gillespie at long on to be out for exactly 100. Bangladesh still needed 23 runs off 17 balls, but Aftab Ahmed continued his fine form from the Oval match with England, as he first took a leg bye off Ashraful, then gave the strike to Rafique, who smashed a cover driven four before taking another leg bye. A four and a dot-ball finished a 10-run over, meaning that Bangladesh now needed only 13 off 12 balls. A good over from McGrath followed, as he conceded only six runs – including an edged four from Rafique. With the last over, Bangladesh needed seven runs, and Ahmed swung the first ball of the over to midwicket for six. Thus, it became a formality – Bangladesh won with four balls and five wickets to spare, almost convincing in today's cricket, and the result meant that the Aussies needed a victory over England at Bristol the following day to have any chance of winning the group stage.\nEngland v Australia (19 June).\nRicky Ponting chose to bat when he won the toss for the visiting Australian cricket team in an extremely tense and see-sawing match at The County Ground, Bristol. It looked like a great decision when Jon Lewis and Darren Gough were smashed about early on, as Australia made their way to 57 for 0 after 11 overs with Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden taking sixes off Lewis over midwicket. However, with the entrance of Steve Harmison, everything changed. In his third over – the 12th of the game, he removed Gilchrist with a bouncy ball that the batsman edged behind, then Ponting with a yorker that he didn't play at – resulting in lbw – then a dot ball, and then Martyn with a slog shot to Pietersen at third man. Australia tried to consolidate, but when Hayden tried to hit out off Harmison four overs later, Paul Collingwood jumped up to pick the ball out of the air with his right hand – a magnificent catch, and Australia had lost four wickets for six runs, reminiscent of their collapse in the Twenty20 match earlier on in the week.\nAustralia dug themselves out of the hole, however, Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey slowly accumulating to increase the rate. England clearly lacked a fifth bowler, opting instead for Vikram Solanki to bat down the order, so they used a combination of Michael Vaughan, Solanki and Collingwood to get through their ten required overs. That let Australia off the hook, with Clarke and Hussey adding 105, before Jon Lewis – who had been taken to the cleaners earlier on – dug out Michael Clarke with an inside edge onto the stumps, taking the fifth wicket of the game at just the right time. Shane Watson accumulated well with Hussey, however, hitting six an over as Lewis was smashed about again, but Harmison got his revenge by completing his first five-wicket haul in ODIs as Hussey was beaten by a slower ball – the first time Hussey had been dismissed in One Day Internationals, for a batting average of 229. Then, Andrew Flintoff was brought back, getting a splendid yorker in for Watson, who was out for 25 just as the Aussies were preparing to hit out – the score 220 for 7 after 44.1 overs. Jason Gillespie and Brad Hogg survived a couple of overs from Flintoff and Harmison – meaning that Harmison finished with five for 33 off ten overs. Towards the end, Australia built up again, before losing Gillespie to a top edge, but 244 for 8 with seven balls remaining still looked difficult for England to chase. Gough dug out Michael Kasprowicz with a yorker with two balls to spare, and four legbyes ended the innings to take Australia to 252 for 9.\nEngland started positively in reply, taking 39 off the first 34 legal deliveries (while Gillespie served up four wides and a no-ball in his first over), but Glenn McGrath took revenge by serving up a good yorker to have Marcus Trescothick bowled for 16. Two overs later, Andrew Strauss went in identical fashion, and Vaughan and Collingwood were forced to consolidate. They did, although in jerky fashion, Collingwood eventually falling to Kasprowicz and Flintoff mistiming a hit off Hogg to see England into a spot of bother at 119 for 4 after 27.2 overs, with Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen at the crease. Edges and runs followed, but when England lost Vaughan and Geraint Jones in quick succession, and were 93 short with only 74 deliveries left, it looked dark for England. Pietersen then upped the ante. Smashing runs to all corners, especially off Gillespie, he reached his fifty off 46 balls, and then took 19 more deliveries to bring up an additional 41 runs – although surviving an extremely close run-out decision near the 40th over. A level headed 7 not out from Lewis – making up somewhat for his bowling – ensured the English were home by three wickets and 15 deliveries – and the Australians had only managed two points from their first two matches, while England had gained 11.\nEngland v Australia (23 June).\nAustralia squared the ODI series by winning a game where England missed their captain Michael Vaughan due to injury. Marcus Trescothick, the stand-in captain, won the toss and decided to chase at the Riverside Ground, thus giving his own side the task of batting under floodlights. Chris Tremlett who had made an impressive debut against Bangladesh, struggled early on with his line and length, and the Australian openers Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist punished him for runs. In his fifth over, however, Tremlett got a breakthrough, Gilchrist mistiming a cut and Geraint Jones taking the catch behind. However, Ricky Ponting did not toss his wicket away early, leaving it to Hayden to hit the runs, and at the end of 15 overs the Australians were 73 for 1. Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison, the change bowlers, kept the pressure up on the batsmen, however, not letting too many runs away even though they bowled the occasional wide, and they could reap the rewards with two quick wickets, Ponting for 27 and Hayden for 39, and people began to remember the last ODI between the sides.\nHowever, this time there was no collapse. Two no-balls from Harmison followed, Andrew Symonds and Damien Martyn defended well, waiting for Harmison and Flintoff to be taken off and saved for the last overs. They were – and Australia were let off the hook. Symonds and Martyn paired up for 142 runs, taking runs off every bowler – even Flintoff and Harmison – and batted together for nearly 25 overs, with a partnership run-rate of nearly 6. The first four overs only yielded 13 runs, but when Harmison was taken off England lost the sting. Symonds was finally run out by the skipper Trescothick for 73, a hopeless attempt at taking a single, and Flintoff dug out Michael Hussey for 5 two overs later. Australia, however, made a highly competitive 266 for 5, and in the seaming conditions one would expect it to be enough.\nAs it turned out, it was. Brett Lee, opening the bowling for Australia, started off with a maiden over to Trescothick, and England struggled to get off the mark, being four for no wicket after three overs. Another maiden from Glenn McGrath followed, and then Andrew Strauss departed with an inside edge off Lee. In the next over, Trescothick was gone for a 15-ball duck, to an away-swinger from McGrath, and two balls later Paul Collingwood gave a massive inside-edge onto his stumps – England were six for three, and staring down the barrel.\nA rescue operation from Andrew Flintoff and Vikram Solanki followed, pairing up for 79 before Solanki was caught at midwicket off Brad Hogg. Then, Flintoff was nearly stumped off Hogg's bowling, only to give a catch at long on later on in the over for 44. With England at 94 for 5, they needed seven and a half runs an over, with Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones at the crease. However, even Pietersen could not save them this time, as he was caught in the deep off Symonds for 19, and the rest of the match just became a task to bat out 50 overs. Thanks to Darren Gough, who made 46 not out (ironically, the top score of the innings), and a level-headed 11 not out from Steve Harmison, England made that, but lost by 57 runs – thus also losing the bonus point.\nAustralia v Bangladesh (25 June).\nAustralia recorded a thumping 10-wicket win over Bangladesh to level their head-to-head record in the NatWest Series to 1–1. Under leaden skies at Old Trafford, Ricky Ponting made the wise decision and chose to bowl, and short-balls from Brett Lee immediately had the Bangladeshis worried. They survived six overs without loss before Javed Omar was trapped by an in-swinger for a 20-ball 3. Tushar Imran was next to fall to Lee, and many expected a procession to begin, but Shahriar Nafees and Mohammad Ashraful gave the crowd a treat with some special strokes. Ashraful had two top-edged sixes, as Lee was dispatched for 20 runs in the 11th over. By the drinks break after 15 overs, Bangladesh were 76 for 2, having added 53 from the last 39 balls. Ponting, however, brought on the spinners Brad Hogg and Andrew Symonds, who both got a fair amount of turn out of the Old Trafford pitch, and Symonds had Shahriar bowled for 47 with a yorker that he played late to. The next ball, he got the out-of-form captain Habibul Bashar, and the wickets began to tumble quickly. Symonds got five wickets for 18 runs, Hogg three for 29, Bangladesh collapsed from 137 for 6 (when Khaled Mashud was bowled by Hogg) to 139 all out in three overs, as Ashraful went for 58 and no one else really offering any resistance to the slow Australian bowlers.\nBangladesh had Adam Gilchrist in some trouble early on, especially through fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza, who had him beaten several times in the opening overs, but Matthew Hayden was imposing at the crease, punishing the inevitable bad balls from Nazmul Hossain who was taken off after three overs, having conceded 29 runs. However, no one could stop the rot, Hayden and Gilchrist taking runs at will after a while to see Australia to the target inside 20 overs. Australia thus closed the gap to England to three points, as the situation indicated by the ICC rankings before the series became more and more possible – that Bangladesh were to be whipping boys and England and Australia would go through.\nEngland v Australia (28 June).\nThe eighth match of the NatWest Series eventually became an anti-climax, but for large parts of the match it wasn't – despite the fact that both teams had qualified for the final before the last game. Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to send his openers in – and they took advantage. Darren Gough was innocuous, conceding 23 runs in his first two overs, prompting a bowling change in the fifth over, sending Steve Harmison on. Meanwhile, Simon Jones got some swing with the new ball – and, yet again in this series, Adam Gilchrist was caught behind off a swing bowler, out for 19. Shortly afterwards, Jones tried to throw the ball back at the wicketkeeper as Matthew Hayden pushed it back to him, but Jones hit Hayden with the balls, and a few words were exchanged – Paul Collingwood joining in the fray as well.\nHowever, the match got on, Jones and Harmison putting on the pressure and eventually having Hayden lbw on 14 – after he had failed to score from the last 11 deliveries. Damien Martyn then faced five dot-balls, and Jones served up a wicket maiden, and Australia were at 46 for 2 at the end of the tenth over. However, that was as good as it got for England. Andrew Flintoff dug out skipper Ricky Ponting for 34, but it mattered little, as Martyn and Andrew Symonds took advantage of the bowling. Michael Vaughan tried to put himself on, but Symonds smashed him over midwicket for six – the first of the match, displaying the despair. With some no-balls from Gough, and Simon Jones getting smashed early on, Australia were 220 for 4 after 42 overs, and looked on course for 300. However, the run-out of Symonds for 74 changed the course of the innings. Michael Clarke departed for three, a good catch by Geraint Jones behind the stumps, and Harmison then served up a wicket-maiden in the 46th over, of all things. With Brad Hogg and Jason Gillespie giving soft catches to Gough, that redeemed his figures somewhat, but he still conceded 70 runs. The last over from Flintoff was very good, however, conceding only three runs with yorkers directed at the feet of the batsmen, and Australia had to be content with 261 for 9.\nEngland's chase was interrupted once by rain, after three overs, when they were eight for 0, but coming back they were set 200 to win in 33 overs. That was never possible – rain started again after three more overs – and when Andrew Strauss fell the umpires decided that play was no longer possible, and a no-result was declared.\nAustralia v Bangladesh (30 June).\nThe last game of the round robin of the NatWest Series was, as expected, won by the Australians. However, it summed up the improvement Bangladesh had made over the tour of England. In the first international, they were rolled over meekly by a no-balling, rusty English side – twice. In the last, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie put the pressure on early, and with the aid of Shane Watson had them on the reels with 75 for 5. Yet, Bangladesh recovered to post 250 for 8, and were theoretically in with a chance for most of the game. Yet, they started very, very shakily. Javed Omar was dropped by Matthew Hayden in the third over, only to be out to Jason Gillespie in the next for an eight-ball duck – a disappointing end to a fine series for the Bangladeshi. Brett Lee had both Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful beaten with full deliveries, Bangladesh were 19 for three wickets down – an all too familiar position.\nA quickfire 30 from captain Habibul Bashar helped to take away some of the jitters, as Bashar took 16 runs off a Brett Lee over, but a bouncer from Shane Watson wasn't successfully evaded, and Adam Gilchrist could take the catch. Aftab Ahmed had to settle for 7, and it was down to the last two recognised batsmen – Shahriar Nafees, who had quietly moved his way to 25 not out, and wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud. However, the two put on an almost faultless partnership of 94, taking their time to consolidate. Shahriar eventually departed for 75, edging a short ball from Shane Watson to the wicket-keeper – the usual method of dismissal. However, their partnership had given Bangladesh hope, and Mohammad Rafique took advantage with a six off Watson. Despite two more wickets falling – Rafique and Khaled Mahmud (caught at mid-on on the last ball) – Bangladesh had recovered to 250 for 8, which could potentially be tricky to chase.\nMashrafe Mortaza was hit around for 12 in the first over, however, and the momentum swung towards Australia. Mortaza hit back by inducing an outside edge from Matthew Hayden to wicketkeeper Mashud for 1, and four balls later a ball from Mortaza hit captain Ricky Ponting on the pads – but too high to be given out. Gilchrist and Ponting paired up well, however, even though Gilchrist rode his luck with a few drives in the air, but in the tenth over he gave a somewhat dubious catch to slip Khaled Mahmud, and was gone for 45 – all while rain threatened to damage the match. However, the weather gradually improved, along with Australia's chances – after 15 overs, they were 83 for three, having lost Damien Martyn for 9, but only needed slightly less than five an over. However, economical bowling and riskless batting from Australia saw Bangladesh in with a chance again. Ponting and Michael Clarke let the run rate go to more than six an over, but Khaled Mahmud's bowling at the death to Andrew Symonds left a bit to be desired, as Australia could take the necessary runs and win by 11 balls and six wickets to spare. A Bangladeshi – Shahriar Nafees – got the Man of the Match award, possibly for his effort to keep the match exciting after Bangladesh had crumbled to 75 for 5.\nEngland v Australia (2 July).\nThe final of the NatWest Series ended in an anticlimax for the visitors, but throughout it gave entertainment to the crowd – despite being a relatively low-scoring game. It didn't look to be low-scoring early on, though, as Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden punished the England opening bowlers Darren Gough and Simon Jones to be 50 for 0 after 6.3 overs. Two balls later, Hayden went for one expansive stroke too many – driving to Ashley Giles at mid-off for 17. England captain Michael Vaughan brought his change bowlers on, first Andrew Flintoff for Jones (who had been taken for 29 runs in his first three overs) and then Steve Harmison.\nThose changes turned the match on its head. Instead of the Australian batsmen taking easy runs off the English bowlers, the English bowlers now tied down the batting, getting rewards in the form of wickets. Gilchrist gave a catch to Kevin Pietersen at short leg for 27, and when Harmison was brought on a couple of overs later, he immediately got a wicket – of Ricky Ponting for 7, and Australia were 71 for 3 after 12.1 overs. Damien Martyn and Andrew Symonds decided to retreat into their shell, as the English bowling turned from difficult to almost unhittable, Flintoff getting a touch on the off-stump of Symonds, but the bail didn't fall off, so he survived. However, the pair could only add 19 from 35 deliveries, before Harmison had Martyn caught behind with a ball that moved away from the batsman, off the waiting edge and into Geraint Jones' gloves.\nFollowing the dismissal of Martyn, Vaughan brought back Jones – realising that Australia were reluctant to hit runs and thus allowing Jones to get through his overs without causing as much damage as he did early on. In fact, he and Harmison were part of a remarkable streak – they served up 28 successive dot-balls to Symonds and Michael Clarke (who bowed under to the pressure and was hit on the pad, out lbw for a 19-ball two). However, Michael Hussey – facing his first ball at 93 for 5 after 25 overs – took control of Jones, and when Harmison was taken off, Australia were let off the hook.\nSymonds and Hussey batted out 15 overs, but Symonds struggled to hit runs and eventually smashed a drive to Andrew Strauss, who took a grateful catch, thus ending Symonds' innings for 29 – off 71 balls, a good innings in Test cricket but in ODI cricket virtually useless. Michael Vaughan then used a strange bowling change, keeping spinner Ashley Giles on for an over more than required and thus borrowing one from Andrew Flintoff who wasn't allowed to bowl a full ten. In the event, it mattered little. Flintoff had ample time to rip out Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, and, with Harmison taking care of Brad Hogg and Glenn McGrath committing batting suicide with a shot not exactly out of the textbook, Australia were all out for 196 – and England were comfortably in the drivers' seat.\nThat was before they got in to bat, however. England survived the first three overs, bowled by McGrath and Lee, without loss. From then on, however, the English lost wickets by the bucketful. England went from 11 for 0 to 19 for 4 in the space of four overs, as the bowlers put the pressure on immediately, and their entire top-order came and went for single-figure scores. Paul Collingwood and Andrew Flintoff survived for a couple more overs, before Flintoff edged McGrath to slip – the score 33 for 5, and England should see themselves lucky to bat out 50 overs – or even score 100 runs. Collingwood and Geraint Jones decided to wait, giving McGrath maiden overs (as he finished his first bowling spell with figures of 7–4–9–3), and despite the batsmen being rapped on the pads, they survived, even taking the occasional six off Jason Gillespie.\nAfter 25 overs, England were 65 for 5, but the Australian spinners didn't get too much out of the track. Dot-balls flourished, but the partnership kept in there, and a second six – from Jones off Hogg – showed their intent. After 35 overs, England were 113 for 5, and required a run a ball, with four overs of Lee and three of McGrath still to negotiate. However, England kept pushing, never letting the run-rate get above 7. Skipper Ponting showed some desperation when he brought Michael Hussey on with nine overs to spare, knowing that the spinners couldn't keep it tight, but got his reward in Hussey's second over when Collingwood was run out for 53 – off 116 balls.\nThen Geraint Jones smacked two fours off Hussey to end the over, meaning that England needed 39 off 36 balls. Five balls later, a miscued sweep off Hogg hit Geraint Jones on the pads – gone for 71 – and England only had three wickets to spare. Two more balls were delivered before that tally was cut down to two – Hussey bowled Simon Jones for a two-ball one, so with Gough and Giles in, England needed 35 off 29 balls. Despite taking the runs off Hussey, Brett Lee's 47th over only yielded a single, as his variations of length turned out to be just the thing. However, Ponting now needed another over from either Hussey, Hogg or Symonds – deciding to use Hussey, he was punished, as Giles hit twos to both the off and leg side, and a wide from Hussey resulting in a nine-run over. Lee then came back on, and with his short ball had Giles playing a definitely unorthodox stroke – a sliced edge over Gilchrist's head for four.\nSingles were taken to end the over, but McGrath was to bowl the last over of the game, with England still needing ten to win. Things got easier for England when McGrath overstepped with the first ball of the over, Gough making contact and running the single to cut the target by two – the no-ball for overstepping and the run single – and the no-ball meant McGrath still had to bowl six balls in the over. Giles then played and missed, before hitting a single, and then Gough drove the two next balls to cover for two. Suddenly, England only needed three off two – and were, incredibly, in a winning position again. But Gough's next shot was right back to McGrath, who took it up well and tossed it at the stumps, running out Gough and meaning that McGrath would bowl to Ashley Giles – and England still required three to win. The ball hit Giles' pads, ran away down the off side, and Giles and Harmison ran all they could to scamper two leg byes – and tie the game.\nEngland v Australia (7 July).\nEngland were lucky to win the toss and get a chance to bowl under cloudy skies at Headingley, as they beat Australia by nine wickets to take their second victory in five ODIs so far. Putting Australia in to bat, they didn't get immediate reward – as especially Darren Gough was smashed about by Adam Gilchrist, but the run rate at least stayed around four an over. And with Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff removing the openers in successive overs, things looked brighter for the English. Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn added 39 for the next wicket, but in 11 overs, all while the English captain Michael Vaughan set attacking fields according to the new power play rules.\nEngland all-rounder Paul Collingwood came on as third-change bowler, and used the helpful conditions to incite Ponting's demise, as Kevin Pietersen held a catch to dismiss the Australian captain for 14, and Collingwood continued to end with four wickets for 34 runs, as Australia slumped from 107 for 2 to 159 for 6 – all wickets courtesy of Collingwood. However, Michael Hussey showed his skills from number seven yet again, as he made a 52-ball 46 – while the ball was still moving around due to the cloud cover – and lifted Australia to 219 for 7.\nThe English reply was initially jittery. The pace of Brett Lee and accuracy of Glenn McGrath shook the English opening batsmen Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss. Trescothick, for example, was caught off a no-ball from Lee, but survived, as the openers lasted nearly 25 overs – before Strauss was caught behind off Brad Hogg for 41. By that time, however, the sun had come out, the ball didn't swing much in the air, and as Lee kept on bowling no-balls – seven in total – things simply wouldn't work out for Australia. Trescothick used 132 balls to bring up his century, skipper Michael Vaughan made a healthy contribution with 59 not out, and England brought up the winning total with four overs to spare.\nEngland v Australia (10 July).\nRicky Ponting, Australia's captain, had so far had a difficult series against the English. In five innings this summer, his highest score was 34, in the no-result at Edgbaston, and his batting average was a meagre 16.40. However, on a Lord's track that suited the batsmen, he was back into his old magnificent form, guiding Australia back on track to victory, and levelling the NatWest Challenge.\nIt started well for Australia, too. Including Michael Kasprowicz in the squad and gambling on winning the toss and subbing one of their bowlers off, they won it – and Kasprowicz got immediate reward. After the English openers had survived the opening overs of McGrath and Lee to be 25 for 0 after eight overs, Kasprowicz was brought on, and Strauss chopped an inside edge onto his own stumps. Nine balls and three runs later, captain Michael Vaughan was hit on the pads by an inswinging delivery from Glenn McGrath and was out for 1. Marcus Trescothick and Kevin Pietersen soon followed to the pavilion, and England were – yet again – staring down the barrel at 45 for 4.\nHowever, England weren't undone that easily. Waiting for Jason Gillespie, who had been conceding many runs all series, Andrew Flintoff and Paul Collingwood paired up for a calm 103 in a little over 20 overs, before Collingwood became Brett Lee's second victim of the day, luring Collingwood to attempt a cut shot off a fast, short ball and edging to keeper Adam Gilchrist. England's resistance didn't end, however, and despite Lee ripping out wickets – ending with five for 41 – the lower-order combined, eking out 30 from the last 21 balls to lift England to a somewhat defensible total of 223 for 8.\nAnd, when Andrew Flintoff was brought on as the fourth bowler to be used in six overs, and removed Gilchrist with his second ball of the day, things looked hopeful for England, but that was as good as it ever got. Ricky Ponting smashed 14 fours and a six on his way to 111, making a century off 105 balls, Michael Vaughan was forced to wait with the power play overs, Simon Katich, Damien Martyn and Andrew Symonds played well-paced innings, and England found themselves unable to contain the Australians. The end was always in sight, eventually coming with 34 balls remaining, Darren Gough bowling a no-ball – his third of the day – to gift the game to Australia. It was symptomatic of Gough's poor series, and he had Gilchrist bowled off a no-ball in the very first over. His bowling analysis for the game read 6.2–0–43–1.\nEngland v Australia (12 July).\nThis match was eerily similar to the one two days earlier – except that Jason Gillespie actually got rewards with the ball, and the batsman to play himself into form was Adam Gilchrist – however, both England and Australia picked batsmen as their supersubs, just like on 10 July. Australia won the toss, chose to field to gain an extra batsman, and had England on the rack.\nThe game was won in the first few overs. The pitch, as Surrey and Hampshire showed in a game played three days later, had a par score well in excess of 300. However, Glenn McGrath's first four overs were maidens, and his fifth over only failed to be because Jason Gillespie dropped a skier, much to the amusement of the crowd. With Brett Lee bowling well and picking up the early wicket of Marcus Trescothick for a duck, England were well behind on the run rate from the start.\nThey never recovered. Despite another skier being dropped, this time by Adam Gilchrist, and the crowd enjoying Gillespie dropping more catches whilst practising in the field, Australia's dominance and fine fielding on the ground saw more England wickets fall. In 27.5 overs, they only mustered 93 runs – for the loss of six wickets, with Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss, Andrew Flintoff, Paul Collingwood and Geraint Jones all out. A desperate situation meant England had to use their substitute, putting on Vikram Solanki for bowler Simon Jones – and Solanki helped save England to some respectability, along with Kevin Pietersen. Solanki made an unbeaten 53 and Pietersen 74 as England posted 228 for 7.\nOn a flat, unresponsive pitch, England's bowlers (now without the subbed-off Jones) were helpless. Gilchrist smashed an 81-ball ton, with an array of shots all around the ground, and eventually ended on 121 not out. Three of the English bowlers conceded more than six an over – Steve Harmison, with 81 runs off 9.5 overs, Darren Gough, with 37 off four, and Ashley Giles with 64 off 10. The two wickets the English got – Matthew Hayden caught behind for 31 and Ricky Ponting stumped for 44 – were largely pointless.\nIn all, it was a comprehensive victory for Australia, probably one of their easiest on the entire tour – possibly excluding the 19-over demolition of Bangladesh in game six of the group stage, with the biggest excitement being when the officials and players were presented to His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh in the break. The Duke was at the ground to officially open the new OCS stand at the Oval. He took the opportunity to lead the tributes to umpire David Shepherd, on his retirement from international umpiring. Former British Prime Minister Sir John Major and current Australian Prime Minister John Howard also sent tributes to Shepherd.\nScotland v Australians (18 August).\nMatch abandoned without a ball bowled\nA capacity crowd of 4,500 was at The Grange in Edinburgh to watch the local heroes of the Scottish cricket team face off with the world's highest-ranked team, Australia. The game was to be a highlight of the Scottish season, with the ground authorities reporting that they could have sold the tickets three times over. The BBC had won the rights to broadcast the match in Scotland, making it the first cricket match to be broadcast on the BBC since 1999.\nHowever, rain poured down steadily, although a buoyant crowd still queued to enter the ground. This weather first cut the match down to 20 overs and later started again to prevent any play whatsoever. Although Cricket Scotland had insured against rain to alleviate pecuniary disadvantage, the lack of a match represented a lost opportunity to help develop the game north of the English border. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nTwo-innings games.\nLeicestershire v Australians (15–17 July).\nMatch drawn\nAustralia were having difficulty choosing between an out-of-form Jason Gillespie (8 wickets at a bowling average of 50.37 in the ODIs) and an almost equally out-of-form Michael Kasprowicz (7 wickets at 34.29), and thus this match with Leicestershire was a fight between the two to keep the place in the Test team. But the two almost exclusively failed to take wickets, with only Brett Lee and Stuart MacGill taking more than two for the match. Lee opened the game by removing Darren Robinson lbw for a golden duck, and Leicestershire eventually subsided for 217 – Australian Chris Rogers top-scoring with 56, Lee taking four for 53. Australia then amassed 582 for 7 over the next day and a half, Justin Langer (115), Ricky Ponting (119) and Damien Martyn with an unbeaten 154 all making centuries. However, it was Rogers who was to make the highest score of the match, as he added with Robinson for 247 for the first wicket – and went on to make a career highest score of 209, right in front of the Australian selectors. When the fifth Leicestershire wicket fell with the Leicestershire score on 363, both teams agreed to a draw.\nWorcestershire v Australians (30 July – 1 August).\nMatch drawn\nThe first day only allowed one over of play, after Vikram Solanki sent Australia in to bat and Justin Langer hit a four off Kabir Ali. On the second day, Langer and Matthew Hayden accumulated 110 for the first wicket, and runs just kept flowing as the Australians made 402 in a day – Brad Haddin top-scoring with 94, Jason Gillespie making an unbeaten 53 including two sixes, while Nadeem Malik got the best bowling figures three wickets for 78. Ali, meanwhile, was punished, to end with 124 conceded runs in 20 overs.\nWorcestershire got off to a good start on the final day, Stephen Moore and Solanki making 85 for the fourth wicket after Jason Gillespie shook the top order early on. However, Michael Kasprowicz took four quick wickets as Worcestershire imploded from 133 for 3 to 151 for 9, while a bit of late order slogging from James Pipe and Malik sent the score to 187. Malik was last out, caught and bowled by Kasprowicz to complete the Australian's five-wicket haul and mark the end of the Worcestershire innings. Australian captain Ricky Ponting opted for batting practice, and the Australians made 168 for 2 before stumps, Ponting scoring an unbeaten 59 while Michael Clarke, who was promoted to opener, also repaired a first-innings failure, making 59 off 55 balls before being run out.\nNorthamptonshire v Australia (20–21 August).\nMatch drawn\nAustralia scored more than four times as many runs for each wicket as their hosts Northamptonshire at Northampton, yet the two-day time limit and Australia's hunger for batting practice ensured a draw. Northamptonshire won the toss, and put their guests in to bat, and Steffan Jones got two early breakthroughs as Australia were set back to 69 for 3 – Damien Martyn having spent only 14 minutes at the crease for his 26 – but Matthew Hayden and Michael Clarke spent good time in the middle making their centuries. The Australians declared on 374 for 6, and immediately dug into the Northamptonshire batsmen, who were effectively reduced to 48 for 5 when Tim Roberts retired hurt for 18. Glenn McGrath only bowled 11 overs, but used his time well, taking three for 24, while Shaun Tait and Brett Lee also got among the wickets with two each. Northamptonshire were bowled out for 169, and Australia opted to bat again, Simon Katich and Justin Langer both making half-centuries before the final day's play ended and the game was drawn. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nEssex v Australians (3–4 September).\nMatch drawn\nBoth sides surpassed 500 in their innings in this two-day match, which included four centuries and expensive bowling figures on either side – as Jason Gillespie was the most economical, with an analysis reading 22–3–80–0. Essex batted first at Chelmsford after winning the toss, and Will Jefferson added 140 for the first wicket with Alastair Cook before being bowled by Michael Kasprowicz. However, the second-wicket partnership was worth even more than the first. Cook slashed 33 fours and one six on his way to 214 – which would have been his highest first-class score if the match had had first class status – and added 270 with Ravi Bopara.\nAfter 105 overs, Essex declared with the score 502 for 4, giving Australia the turn to exploit bad bowling and a flat pitch. Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden added 213 for the first wicket, Hayden went on to make a 118-ball 150 before retiring, while Brad Hodge was allowed to top score with 166 from number 4, including a 161-run fifth-wicket partnership with Brad Haddin. For Essex, James Middlebrook got the best bowling figures with two for 110, including Adam Gilchrist for 8, as Australia finished the day's batting practice with the score 561 for 6."

        "text": "Michael Jeremy Bates (born 19 June 1962) is a British former professional tennis player. He was ranked UK number 1 in 1987 and from 1989 to 1994. He reached a career-high ATP world ranking of 54 from 17 April 1995 to 23 April 1995.\nDuring his career Bates won two Grand Slam mixed doubles titles, at Wimbledon in 1987 and the Australian Open in 1991, partnering his fellow British player Jo Durie. He also won one top-level singles title and three men's doubles titles on the professional circuit. After retiring as a player, Bates served as the captain of Britain's Davis Cup team from 2004 to 2006.\nCareer.\nBates turned professional in 1982. Partnering his fellow British player Jo Durie, he won the mixed doubles titles at Wimbledon in 1987, the first British doubles team to win the title for 51 years and the Australian Open in 1991, the first time a British doubles team has ever won the title. He was also a Men's Doubles runner-up at the Australian Open in 1988 (partnering Sweden's Peter Lundgren).\nAs a singles player, Bates reached the fourth round at Wimbledon twice – in 1992 and 1994 – losing on both occasions to France's Guy Forget. In the 1992 encounter, Bates held a match point against Forget in the fourth set, but failed to convert it and ended up losing in five sets 7–6, 4–6, 6–3, 6–7, 3–6, narrowly missing out on a place in the quarter-finals against John McEnroe. Bates was also the first ever opponent of Andre Agassi in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, in the first round of the 1986 US Open, with Bates winning in four sets against the 16-year-old wildcard Agassi.\nBates won one top-level singles title during his career – at Seoul in 1994 when he was aged 31, becoming the first British male to win an ATP tour title since 1977 (he was the oldest champion on the tour that season). He also won three men's doubles titles at Tel Aviv (1989), Queen's Club (1990), and Rotterdam (1994). He was the British national champion six times, and played in 20 Davis Cup ties for Britain, scoring 27 wins and 24 losses. His career-high rankings were World No. 54 in singles (in 1995) and World No. 25 in doubles (in 1991).\nPost-retirement activity.\nBates retired from the professional tour in 1996. Since leaving the tour, he has served as captain of Britain's Davis Cup team as well as playing in seniors' events. He quit as Head of Performance for the Lawn Tennis Association in January 2007. In September 2007, Bates was appointed Director of Tennis at the Sutton Tennis Academy (London, UK). He quit Sutton Tennis Academy in May 2010, and worked as a broadcaster and commentator for the BBC, Eurosport and Sky. He became the individual coach of former British Number 1 Anne Keothavong and continues to coach, including British player, Katie Boulter. He is also a motivational speaker on team building."

        "text": "John Calder Marshall (March 14, 1877 – August 7, 1965) was a Canadian ice hockey player. Marshall played for the Winnipeg Victorias, Montreal HC, Montreal Shamrocks, Montreal Wanderers, Toronto Pros and Toronto Blueshirts. Marshall was a member of six Stanley Cup championship teams for four clubs. He won his first Stanley Cup in 1901 with Winnipeg Victorias. He then joined the Montreal HC and won two more Cups in 1902 and 1903. He also won the Stanley Cup with Montreal Wanderers in 1907 and 1910. Marshall won his sixth and final Cup as a player-manager with the Toronto Blueshirts in 1914.\nMarshall was the first player to win six Stanley Cup titles. He was also the first player to win the Stanley Cup while playing for four clubs. His teammate on the 1914 Stanley Cup winning Toronto Blueshirts, goalie Hap Holmes, tied the record in 1925 while backstopping the Victoria Cougars to a Stanley Cup victory. Marshall was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1965.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Saint-Vallier, Quebec, south-east of Quebec City, Marshall moved to Montreal and played high school hockey for Pointe-Saint-Charles, starting in 1894. In 1898, he made the jump to senior level play when he moved out west and started play with the Winnipeg Hockey Club intermediates, and later with the Winnipeg Victorias. He played with the Victorias until 1901, winning the Stanley Cup in a challenge with the Montreal Shamrocks.\nAfter the season, he moved back home and joined the Montreal Hockey Club. As one of the \"Little Men of Iron\", the club won the Stanley Cup in 1902 and 1903. Along with several other players of the club, he left in 1903 to form the new Montreal Wanderers. He played two seasons with the Wanderers before he moved to Toronto. In 1905–06, he played with the new Toronto Professionals in exhibition play. In 1906, he returned to Montreal, and he played for the Montreal Montagnards in 1907, joining the Wanderers after the Montagnards disbanded. The Wanderers won the ECAHA title that season and successfully defended their Stanley Cup championship of 1906 in challenges.\nHowever, Marshall did not stay with the club beyond that season. He moved to the Montreal Shamrocks and played two seasons for the Shamrocks before returning to the Wanderers for the 1910 NHA season. He helped the Wanderers to another Stanley Cup win that season, the club's last in its history. He stayed with the organization until 1912, when he returned to Toronto to join the new Toronto Hockey Club team. After Bruce Ridpath retired as manager in 1913, Marshall took on the responsibility while continuing to play for the team. He would win another Stanley Cup with the Torontos in 1914. The following season was cut short due to appendicitis and he only played four games. In all, he played three seasons for the Torontos before he returned to the Wanderers in 1915 for two seasons, before retiring from hockey in 1917.\nMarshall died in Montreal on August 7, 1965, aged 88.\nPlaying style.\nJack Marshall was a strong all-round player, and over the course of his career he tried out almost every position the seven-man game had to offer. During his junior years in Pointe-Saint-Charles in Montreal, beginning in 1894, he started out as a goaltender. Although he was a right-handed shot he would later play on the left wing with the Winnipeg Victorias in the Manitoba Hockey Association, because the team lacked adequate enough left-handed options. With the Montreal Wanderers he first played as a centre forward, and in the second half of his career as a defenceman. He also played occasionally at right wing and as a rover.\nIn the January 21, 1901 issue of the Winnipeg Tribune Marshall was described as \"not a big man physically\" but \"solidly built, tough and enduring.\" The newspaper also remarked that he played \"a neat speedy and cool-headed game, very free from fouls or off-sides\" and that he \"is an excellent shot on goal and can supply the place of any man on the forward line who may get hurt.\"\nOutside of hockey Marshall was also prominent in basketball, and he also played soccer and rugby football."

        "text": "Patrick Joseph Alexander \"Paddy\" Moran (March 11, 1877 – January 14, 1966) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. Moran played all but one of his 16 seasons for the Quebec Hockey Club, from 1901 to 1917; in the 1909–10 season, Moran played for the All-Montreal HC and the Haileybury Comets. Moran was noted for protecting the area in front of his net by aggressively using his stick, and expectorating at opposing players while chewing tobacco. He won two Stanley Cups with Quebec in 1912 and 1913. Moran was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.\nEarly life.\nMoran began playing ice hockey at the age of 15, with a local Quebec team. At age 17, Moran changed schools as his school was one of the few in Quebec City not to have an ice hockey team. At the age of 19, Moran helped his new club, the Crescents, win the Intermediate Championship.\nPlaying career.\nMoran began his playing career with the Quebec Hockey Club in the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL). Over four seasons, Moran appeared in 30 games, winning 19 of them. For the 1905–06 season, the Quebec Hockey Club joined the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA). Over the next four years, Moran appeared in 38 games, but won only 11 of them, while his lowest goals-against average in a season during that span was 6.79. In the 1909–10 season, Moran joined the All-Montreal HC from the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) and as the league folded, he then joined the Haileybury Comets of the National Hockey Association (NHA). In his only season with the Comets, Moran posted a 3–8 record over 11 games, letting in 79 goals.\nFor the 1910–11 season, Moran rejoined Quebec. That year, Quebec finished last in the league, winning only four games, and letting in 97 goals against. In the 1911–12 season, Moran went 10–8 over 18 games, with a 4.26 goals-against average. They won the O'Brien Cup and the Stanley Cup after finishing with the best record in the league. In the Stanley Cup challenge against the Moncton Victorias of the Maritime Professional Hockey League (MPHL), Quebec won the first game 9–3, and the second game 8–0. Moran finished with a 1.50 goals-against average, while Jack McDonald and Joe Malone combined for 14 out of the 17 Quebec goals as Quebec won the Stanley Cup. During the 1911–12 season Moran was also manager Art Ross' goaltender of choice for the NHA All-Stars, a team which played a series of three games against the PCHA All-Stars in British Columbia, losing two games to one.\nThe next season, Moran went 16–4 in the regular season in 20 games, with one shutout and a 3.70 goals-against average. Quebec repeated as O'Brien Cup winners, and had a Stanley Cup challenge once more, playing against the Sydney Miners of the MPHL. Quebec repeated as champions, winning the three-game series 2–0. In the first game, Quebec won 14–3, as Malone scored nine goals, while in the second one, Quebec emerged with a slimmer margin of victory, winning 6–2.\nMoran finished his career with the Bulldogs, retiring after the NHA's last season. He played four more seasons, during which he played 69 games, winning 34 of them. Over his career, Moran's teams often had losing records, or they had a winning percentage barely over 50%. Some hockey legends often recall that he was the best goaltender of them all. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1958, with the help of Senator Chubby Power, once a teammate. He is still the earliest goaltender in HHOF, starting his senior hockey venture in 1901.\nPlaying style.\nMoran was a stand-up style goaltender. At and 180 lb (82 kg/12 st 12 lb), he was considered a big goaltender for his era. In Moran's era, goaltenders were not allowed to drop down to the ice to make saves, so his style suited him well. Moran was especially noted for his aggressive defense of the area in front of his net. He used his stick to slash opposing players within reach. Moran often chewed tobacco while on the ice, and another favorite tactic of his was to expectorate at opposing players. Moran's stick work was described as attempts to \"slash [other players'] heads off with lightning strokes of his blade\". Moran often wore oversized sweaters, claiming that they kept him warm in the cold arenas; however, he kept it unbuttoned, and often used it to catch shots.\nPost-retirement.\nMoran retired after the 1916–17 season, at the age of 39. He was proud to have built his own house with his ice hockey earnings, which cost CAN$4,000. In 1919, Moran became a custom house builder, and continued in this career for at least 35 years. In 1944 at age 66, Moran was interviewed about his playing days, along with contemporary goaltender Percy LeSueur, who is noted for his Stanley Cup wins in 1909 and 1911 with the Ottawa Senators. Later in his life, Moran became an avid follower of the Quebec Aces. He was inducted into the Quebec Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1958, Moran was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He died on January 14, 1966."

He was a member of the Tigers' 1924 WCHL championship and won the Stanley Cup with the Bruins in 1929. Oliver played nearly 600 games in a professional career that spanned 16 seasons and scored 217 goals. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1967.\nPlaying career.\nOliver grew up in Selkirk, Manitoba and played both junior and senior hockey with the Selkirk Fishermen. Oliver and the Fishermen won the Manitoba Senior Hockey League in 1919 and challenged the Hamilton Tigers for the Allan Cup. Oliver scored a goal in the second game, but the Fishermen lost the two-game series on total goals, 7–6. He left Selkirk for a professional career in Calgary in 1920. He played one season with the Calgary Canadians of the independent Big-4 League in 1919–20 then moved to the Calgary Tigers and the new Western Canada Hockey League. \nOliver quickly established himself as a star player in the WCHL, using his speed and shot to earn positions as a First-Team All-Star in both 1924 and 1925. He was a key member of the Tigers' team that won the 1923–24 WCHL championship, and lost to the Montreal Canadiens for the Stanley Cup.\nWhen the WCHL collapsed in 1926, Oliver's rights were bought by the Boston Bruins. His NHL career began on a line with Bill Carson and Percy Galbraith, and he led the Bruins in scoring each of his first three seasons with the team. Oliver scored four goals in a game versus Chicago on January 11, 1927, becoming the first Boston Bruin to attain that feat. He won the Stanley Cup with Boston in 1929 and remained with the organization for eight years. Oliver became the first Boston Bruin to score a playoff overtime goal when he notched the winner on March 20, 1930 versus the Montreal Maroons. The Bruins sold his rights to the New York Americans in 1934, and Oliver completed his career with three seasons in New York. Well regarded for his gentlemanly nature on the ice, Oliver was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1967, and is an honoured member of the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame.\nFollowing his career, Oliver returned to Selkirk, working first as an electrician, then moved to Winnipeg where he worked for the Weights and Measures Department of the Canadian Government. He died in 1985."

        "text": "William George \"The Western Wizard\" Hay (January 10, 1898 — July 13, 1975) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who played for the Regina Capitals and Portland Rosebuds of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) and the Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Red Wings in the National Hockey League (NHL) between 1921 and 1933. He was a top star on the Canadian prairies, named a WCHL All-Star four times in five seasons. He transferred to the NHL in 1926 when the Rosebuds were sold to the rival league and went on to score the first goal in the history of the Chicago Black Hawks. He retired in 1933 after several seasons with the Red Wings. Hay was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.\nEarly life.\nHay was born in Listowel, Ontario, but moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, at an early age. He and childhood friend Dick Irvin were teammates on the Winnipeg Monarchs when they played junior. On January 10, 1916, Hay enlisted with the 101st Battalion (Winnipeg Light Infantry) to serve in the First World War. He followed in the footsteps of his older brother Reginald \"Reg\" Hay (born 1890), who was also a hockey player and a member of the 1915 Winnipeg Monarchs senior team which had captured the Allan Cup as senior amateur champions of Canada. Before the Hay brothers both joined the military ranks they had played together on the Monarchs in the Division A of the Manitoba Hockey League during the 1915–16 season. Hay arrived in England in July 1916, and on September 2 that year was in France. At that time the 101st Battalion was broken up, and he transferred to the 17th Reserve Battalion and then the Canadian Army Service Corps. While overseas Hay contracted the Spanish flu, but returned to Canada by May 1919.\nPlaying career.\nReturning from the war, Hay settled in Regina, Saskatchewan and played two seasons with the Regina Victorias of the Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League between 1919 and 1921. He then joined the Regina Capitals and began his professional career in the WCHL. In four years in Regina, he was named a league First-Team All-Star three times. Hay remained with the team after it relocated to become the Portland Rosebuds in 1925, and was named an All-Star for the fourth time in 1925–26. When the league collapsed in 1926, the Rosebuds were sold in their entirety to the NHL and became the Chicago Black Hawks.\nHay joined the team in Chicago for the 1926–27 season, and on November 17, 1926, scored the first goal in the history of the Black Hawks. He completed the season in Chicago but was traded, along with Percy Traub, to the Detroit Cougars in exchange for $15,000 after its conclusion. Hay played his finest NHL season in 1927–28, leading the team in goals and points, and was named to an unofficial all-star team by the league's managers. He played seven seasons in the Detroit organization, and retired one game into the 1933–34 season to take over as the coach of their minor league team, the Detroit Olympics, whom he spent three years with before leaving the game.\nHe was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958, and has been honoured by the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. He was considered one of the best stickhandlers in the game during his time in the NHL.\nOff the ice.\nFollowing his hockey career, Hay worked in insurance until the outbreak of World War II. He served as a flight-lieutenant and instructor with the Royal Canadian Air Force until the conclusion of the war, after which he returned to his insurance business. He retired in 1965 and lived quietly until his death in Stratford, Ontario, ten years later."

        "text": "Charles Thomas Hooper (November 24, 1883 – March 23, 1960) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He played for the Kenora Thistles, Montreal Hockey Club, and Montreal Wanderers. Hooper was a Stanley Cup winner with the Thistles in 1907 and the Wanderers in 1908. Noted for his skating speed, checking and stick-handling ability, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963.\nPlaying career.\nHooper was born in the village of Rat Portage, later renamed Kenora, in north-western Ontario, Canada. He first played organized hockey for a local high school. The high school team was very talented, good enough to defeat Rat Portage's senior ice hockey team. In 1896, at the age of thirteen, Hooper joined the Rat Portage senior hockey team where he would play until 1908. During his years with the club, the Thistles won three league titles and challenged for the Stanley Cup three times, in 1903 and 1905 against Ottawa, and 1907 against the Montreal Wanderers. The team won the Cup in January 1907, in part due to Hooper's three goals in the second game of the two-game total-goals series. The team went on to defend the Stanley Cup as league champions but lost the title in March 1907 to the same Wanderers. Hooper missed the March series rematch due to a fractured collarbone.\nThe Thistles folded after one game in January 1908 and Hooper joined the Montreal Wanderers. He only played two season games with the Wanderers and two Stanley Cup challenge games before he got his release from the team. He had been moved to the cover-point defence position by the Wanderers from his career forward position and lost the starting job to Walter Smaill. He signed with the Montreal Hockey Club for the rest of the season, where he played rover. Hooper's play in the 1907–08 season was considered by hockey writers to not be up to the standard of his previous years due to his fitness. He retired after the season.\nAfter hockey, Hooper moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. He died in 1960 and is buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver."

        "text": "Joseph Thomas Borowski (born May 4, 1971) is a sports broadcaster for the Arizona Diamondbacks, as well as a former professional baseball right-handed relief pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the Baltimore Orioles, Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Florida Marlins, and Cleveland Indians.\nCareer.\nHigh school career.\nBorowski grew up in Bayonne, attended Marist High School and was an All-America selection in both football and baseball and a two-time All-State selection in both sports. He attended Rutgers University in New Jersey.\nMajor League Baseball career.\nBorowski was a 32nd round draft pick of the Chicago White Sox in 1989. In 2000, Borowski pitched in the Mexican League for the Monterrey Sultanes and in the Northern League.\nBefore his second year with the Chicago Cubs in 2002, Borowski had never appeared in more than 25 games, but when given a chance to appear frequently he did very well. Between his stints with the Yankees and Cubs, he worked as a fireman. In 2002, he went 4–4 with a 2.73 ERA in 73 games of relief. The next year, he was converted to the closer role for the Cubs and was exceptional, going 2–2 with a 2.63 ERA and recording 33 saves in 37 opportunities, helping the Cubs win their division and reach the NLCS before being eliminated by the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins. In 2004, Borowski suffered from a partial tear in his right rotator cuff which limited him to just 22 games, in which he struggled, going 2–4 with an 8.02 ERA and recording 9 saves in 11 opportunities. In 2005, Borowski broke his hand on a come-backer that went directly at him. He returned to the Cubs on May 20. He did not have his old closer job back, though, as Ryan Dempster had emerged as the club's new closer. On June 29, 2005, Borowski was released by the Cubs.\nBorowski was later in 2005 acquired by the Devil Rays, who use him as a set-up man to closer Danys Báez. While with the Devil Rays, Borowski got very hot, pitching a franchise record 21 scoreless innings, and is seen by many as the catalyst for the Devil Rays 2nd half turnaround, as his inspired performance helped stabilize the Rays' otherwise shaky bullpen. However, in his last 14 appearances he gave up 15 runs, and was designated for assignment by the Devil Rays in early December, and then released.\nDuring the 2006 season, Borowski pitched for the Florida Marlins and converted 36 out of 43 save opportunities. On December 6, 2006, Borowski signed a $4.25 million, one-year contract to pitch for the Cleveland Indians that included a club option for 2008. The signing of Borowski filled the vacant closer role for Cleveland.\nDuring the 2007 season, Borowski got off to a slow start as closer for the Indians, posting an earned run average of 13.50 in his first seven outings. His struggles were capped off after surrendering six runs to the New York Yankees on April 19, 2007, in the ninth inning after coming into the game with a 4-run lead. Borowski was not charged with a blown save in this outing, since a 3-run lead or smaller is required for a pitcher to earn the save. He led the American League with 45 saves, but had an of 5.07, which was the highest ever for a closer with 40 or more saves.\nOn November 6, 2007, the Indians exercised his $4 million club option, opting to bring him back in 2008. Had the team declined Borowski's option, he would have been paid a $250,000 buyout.\nIn 2008, Borowski got off to a bad start to the season. Putting up an 18.00 ERA with two blown saves through 5 appearances, he averaged a walk, 2 hits, and 2 runs per appearance. Following another dreadful appearance in which he gave up 3 runs in inning on April 14 the Indians put him on the 15-day DL with a strained triceps.\nBorowski was designated for assignment by the Indians on July 4, and released on July 10, 2008.\nOn February 24, 2009, Borowski announced his retirement.\nPersonal life.\nBorowski currently resides in Scottsdale, Arizona, with his wife Tatum and two sons Blaze and Ty. \nHe accepted an award in 2004 from the Polish American Police Association as a distinguished Polish-American.\nExternal links.\n, or Mexican League, or Retrosheet, or The Baseball Gauge, or Venezuela Winter League"

He is the youngest of the three lacrosse-playing Powell brothers (Ryan and Casey Powell).\nPowell is the only player to win the Jack Turnbull Award as the top attackman in Division I lacrosse four consecutive times. Powell was also a four-time finalist for the Tewaaraton Trophy, the collegiate player of the year award, and is one of two male players to win the award twice. He led Syracuse to two national championships and holds the school record for most career points. Syracuse retired his #22 jersey in 2023. He is widely considered one of the greatest lacrosse players of all time.\nPowell is now a singer/songwriter and tours both as a solo artist and as a member of his band The Black River. In 2022 Powell started a new band called The Echosound (formerly WADE).\nHigh school career.\nPowell attended Carthage Senior High School in Carthage, New York, where he was a high school All-American. He set the New York State high school records for most points in a season with 194 points in 2000, most points in a game with 15 points in 2000, and most assists in a season with 120 assists in 1999 and 115 in 2000.\nCollege career.\nPowell enrolled at Syracuse in the fall of 2000 as one of the most anticipated recruits in college lacrosse history. He wore the #22 Syracuse jersey, the same number previously worn by both of his older brothers (Casey and Ryan), and by lacrosse legends Gary Gait and Charlie Lockwood.\n2001 season.\nIn his freshman season, Michael Powell tallied 30 goals, 40 assists (70 points), and 69 groundballs while leading Syracuse to the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship title game against Princeton University. In the championship game, he scored an unassisted goal with just 16 seconds remaining in regulation to force overtime, but Syracuse lost to Princeton on a B.J. Prager goal with 41 seconds left in overtime. Powell became the first player in Syracuse lacrosse history to be named a First Team All-American as a freshman. He was also awarded the Jack Turnbull Award as the nation's top attackman, and was a finalist for the inaugural Tewaaraton Trophy.\n2002 season.\nIn 2002, Powell scored 42 goals and 42 assists en route to leading Syracuse to a national championship. With four goals and three assists in the championship game, he was named the NCAA Tournament's Most Outstanding Player and won his first Tewaaraton Trophy.\n2003 season.\nPowell missed the fall 2002 semester and fall practice at Syracuse but was able to regain academic eligibility before the 2003 lacrosse season. Scored 31 goals and 33 assists for 64 points. Despite the aggressive defenses that targeted him during the season, he helped lead Syracuse to the Final Four, of what would eventually be 22 consecutive Final Fours, an NCAA record. Syracuse fell to Johns Hopkins University 19–8 in the semifinals.\n2004 season.\nAs a senior, Powell led the Orangemen to their ninth NCAA championship. In the NCAA tournament, Syracuse defeated top-seeded Johns Hopkins in the semifinal round 15–9 and then beat second-seeded Navy in the championship game 14–13. On the season, Powell scored 89 points (47 goals, 42 assists), surpassing the Syracuse record shared by his two older brothers to become the all-time leading scorer at Syracuse with 307 points. That number ties him for 12th all-time in NCAA history. Powell was again selected as a First Team All-American, becoming just the sixth lacrosse player to earn that recognition four times, won his second Tewaaraton Trophy, and his first Enners Trophy as the most outstanding player in men's college lacrosse.\nProfessional career.\nFollowing his graduation, Powell surprised many in the lacrosse community when he chose not to play professional lacrosse for Major League Lacrosse (MLL) in the 2004 season. Instead, he pursued a career as a professional musician. Powell, along with his two older brothers, also signed an endorsement contract with lacrosse equipment manufacturer Brine, Corp., with Powell working out of Brine's west coast office. Casey and Ryan had previously been employed by Warrior Sports.\nIn 2005, Powell joined the MLL and was drafted by the Baltimore Bayhawks, where he and teammate Gary Gait led the Bayhawks to the league championship. Powell also played in the MLL All-Star Game, where he was selected as MVP. He sat out the 2006 MLL season. On March 21, 2007, Powell, along with Ben DeFelice and a 2008 conditional draft choice, was traded from the Baltimore Bayhawks to the Boston Cannons in exchange for Ryan Curtis and Conor Gill.\nPowell was a member of U.S. World Team in the 2006 World Lacrosse Championship, where he was the U.S.'s leading scorer and was selected to the All-World Team.

        "text": "William Bowen (1862 – 26 September 1925) was a Welsh international rugby union player who played club rugby for Swansea and was capped 13 times for Wales. Bowen captained Wales on one occasion.\nRugby career.\nBowen was first selected to play for Wales against England at the Rectory Field, Blackheath in 1886 under the captaincy of Charlie Newman. Although Wales lost the game, the press were generally positive of the Welsh play and pointed out the forwards for their strong play. Bowen was re-selected for the next game of the 1886 Home Nations Championship this time against Scotland at the Cardiff Arms Park.\nIn 1887 Bowen played in all three games of the 1887 Championship, including the draw with England at Llanelli's cricket ground and the win against Ireland at Birkenhead Park. The Scottish game was not a memorable match for Wales, with the Scottish players running in twelve tries without reply, including five for George Lindsay. Although Bowen missed the 1888 tournament he did play against the touring New Zealand Maoris.\nAfter playing all five games of the 1889 and 1990 Championships, Bowen was given the captaincy against England on 3 January 1891. Wales lost the game, and the captaincy was passed to Llanelli's William H. Thomas, though at the time the captaincy was normally chosen by the players before the match rather than by the selectors. Bowen's last game for Wales was against Scotland at Raeburn Place in another one sided win for the Scottish team.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "Henry Vernon Howell (December 28, 1932 – March 9, 2019) was a Canadian professional hockey player and longtime star for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He played in the NHL and then the World Hockey Association (WHA) between 1952 and 1976. After his playing career Howell briefly worked as a coach in both leagues, as well as the general manager of the Cleveland Barons in the NHL during the 1977–78 season. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1979.\nLife.\nHe was born in Hamilton, Ontario and died on March 9, 2019, at the age of 86. He attended GCVI (Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute), in Guelph, Ontario. Harry was a Westdale Secondary School Alumni. (see Westdale Secondary School). He also played hockey in Guelph.\nCareer.\nHowell joined the New York Rangers in 1952. In 1955 he was named captain, but gave up that position after two seasons, as he felt he played poorly those years.\nA stalwart, stay at home defenceman, in 1967 Howell was the last player in the pre-expansion era to win the Norris Trophy, and famously said that he was glad he won the trophy then, because Bobby Orr (who finished third that year) would \"own\" the Norris for some time to come; Orr would win the trophy for the next eight seasons. Howell's playing weight was 195 and he stood 6 foot 1 inches tall. He played seventeen years wearing number 3 for the Rangers. \nIn 1969 Howell was offered a front-office position with the Rangers if he retired, but he was interested in still playing, so was sold to the Oakland Seals. He played another eight years in professional hockey; two with Oakland/California Seals, three with the Los Angeles Kings, and one each with three World Hockey Association (WHA) teams: New York Golden Blades/Jersey Knights (1973–74 WHA season), San Diego Mariners (1974–75), and ending his playing career with the Calgary Cowboys (1975–76).\nHowell first moved into team management while still a player. After seven games with the New York Golden Blades, on November 21, 1973, Howell was elevated to player-coach when the team was moved and became the Jersey Knights for the remainder of the season. At the end of that season, the Knights moved and became the San Diego Mariners, with Howell still performing double duty as player-coach. Howell was strictly a player during his season with the Calgary Cowboys.\nHowell played 1,411 NHL games and 170 WHA games, scoring 101 goals and 360 assists for 461 points.\nHe was named a First Team All-Star in 1967, and played in All-Star Games in 1954, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1970. \nWhen he left the NHL, Howell had played more games as a defenseman than anyone else, and remains sixth in all time games played as a defenseman. He also holds the record for most games played for New York Rangers: 1,160.\nAfter retiring as a player, Howell became general manager of the Cleveland Barons for the 1977–78 NHL season. The Barons were in dire financial circumstances, and merged with the equally challenged Minnesota North Stars at the end of that season. Howell became head coach of the merged Minnesota North Stars for the 1977–78 season, but resigned after only 11 games.\nHowell was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1979.\nIn 1990, he won the Stanley Cup as a member of the Edmonton Oilers where he served as a scout. In 2000 he re-joined the Rangers as a scout, and worked in that role until retiring in 2004.\nHowell's #3, along with Andy Bathgate's #9, was retired by the New York Rangers on February 22, 2009.\nIn the 2009 book \"100 Ranger Greats\", the authors ranked Howell at No. 10 all-time of the 901 New York Rangers who had played during the team's first 82 seasons."

        "title": "1994–95 Major League Baseball strike",
        "text": "The 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike was the eighth and longest work stoppage in Major League Baseball (MLB) history, as well as the fourth in-season work stoppage in 22 years. The strike began on August 12, 1994, and resulted in the remainder of that season, including the postseason and the World Series, being canceled. This was the first time in ninety years, since 1904, that a World Series was not played. The strike was suspended on April 2, 1995, after 232 days, making it the longest such stoppage in MLB history and the longest work stoppage in major league professional sports at the time (breaking the record set by the 1981 strike, also in MLB). \nAs a result of the strike, a total of 948 games were canceled, and MLB became the first-ever major American professional sports league to lose an entire postseason due to a labor dispute. Due to the strike, both the 1994 and 1995 seasons were not played to a complete 162 games; the strike began after the teams had played at least 113 games in 1994. Each team played a total of 144 games in 1995.\nThis was the first time in North American professional sports that an entire postseason was canceled because of labor disputes; the second (and last to date) was the cancellation of the National Hockey League's 2005 Stanley Cup playoffs as a result of the entire 2004–05 season being canceled. Coincidentally, the NHL also experienced a labor dispute of their own in 1994.\nBackground.\nIn response to a worsening financial situation in baseball, the owners of Major League Baseball teams collectively proposed a salary cap to their players. Ownership claimed that small-market clubs would fall by the wayside unless teams agreed to share local broadcasting revenues (to increase equity among the teams) and enact a salary cap, a proposal that the players adamantly opposed. On January 18, 1994, the owners approved a new revenue-sharing plan keyed to a salary cap, which required the players' approval. The following day, the owners amended the Major League agreement by giving complete power to the commissioner on labor negotiations.\nThe dispute was played out with a backdrop of years of hostility and mistrust between the two sides. What arguably stood in the way of a compromise settlement was the absence of an official commissioner ever since the owners forced Fay Vincent to resign in September 1992. Vincent said the owners had colluded in the signing of free agents, which led to \"a $280 million theft\" by Bud Selig and Jerry Reinsdorf, which \"polluted labor relations in baseball\" and left Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, with \"no trust in Selig.\" On February 11, 1994, the owners greatly reduced the commissioner's power to act in \"the best interests of baseball.\"\nOwner representative Richard Ravitch officially unveiled the ownership proposal on June 14, 1994. The proposal would guarantee a record $1 billion in salary and benefits. But the ownership proposal also would have forced clubs to fit their payrolls into a more evenly based structure. Salary arbitration would have been eliminated, free agency would begin after four years rather than six, and owners would have retained the right to keep a four- or five-year player by matching his best offer. Owners claimed that their proposal would raise average salaries from $1.2 million in 1994 to $2.6 million by 2001.\nFehr rejected the offer from the owners on July 18. He believed a salary cap was simply a way for owners to clean up their own disparity problems with no benefit to the players.\nOn July 13, 1994, Fehr said if serious negotiations between the players and the owners did not begin soon, the players could go out on strike in September of that year, threatening the postseason. On December 31, 1993, Major League Baseball's collective bargaining agreement ran out with no new agreement yet signed.\nStrike.\nJune.\nAs negotiations continued to heat up, the owners decided to withhold $7.8 million that they were required to pay per previous agreement into the players' pension and benefit plans. The final straw came on June 23 when the Senate Judiciary Committee failed to approve an antitrust legislation by a vote of 10–7. According to Fehr, the action left the players with little choice but to strike. \"We felt in '94 we were pushed into it,\" he said. \"I still think that's a justified conclusion.\"\nJuly–August.\nOn July 28, the Players Association executive board set August 12, 1994, as a strike date. When that day came, the players went ahead with their threat to walk off the job. The last games of that baseball season were played on August 11, 1994.\nOn August 31, three-and-a-half hours of negotiations with federal mediators produced no progress in the strike, and no further talks were scheduled as the strike went into its 4th week. According to then-acting commissioner Bud Selig, September 9 was the tentative deadline for canceling the rest of the season if no agreement was reached between the owners and players. The MLBPA offered a counterproposal to ownership on September 8 calling for a two-percent tax on the 16 franchises with the highest payrolls to be divided among the other 12 clubs. Teams in both leagues would share 25% of all gate receipts under the MLBPA's plan. The owners responded by claiming that the measures wouldn't meet the cost.\nThe rest of the season, including the World Series, was called off by Selig on September 14. Selig acknowledged that the strike had torn an irreparable hole in the game's fabric. The move to cancel the rest of the season meant the loss of $580 million in ownership revenue and $230 million in player salaries. In 1994, the average MLB salary was an estimated $1.2 million.\nReaction.\nThe Montreal Expos' best season in their history was stopped by the strike. They had the best record in baseball, 74–40, and were six games ahead of the Atlanta Braves in the NL East despite having the second-lowest payroll in MLB. Most baseball writers considered the Expos to be World Series contenders. Coincidentally, the only time that the Expos actually made it to the postseason was in 1981, the last time that there was a significant players' strike in Major League Baseball. That season, Montreal qualified by winning the second half of the 1981 season.\nChicago White Sox star Frank Thomas, who wound up winning the American League's Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award for the second year in a row in 1994, said \"I've had a career year, but I'm not going to finish it.\" Tony Gwynn had a chance to be the first to finish a season over .400 since Ted Williams, as he was batting .394 at the time of the strike. The strike also cost Matt Williams of the San Francisco Giants a chance to beat Roger Maris' single season home run record. When the strike forced the cancellation of the remaining 47 games of the season, Williams had already hit 43 home runs, on pace to match Maris' single season record of 61 home runs. Cleveland Indians second baseman Carlos Baerga was unable to extend his record two-year streak of 20 home runs, 200 hits, and 100 RBI by a second baseman because of the strike. Seattle Mariners star Ken Griffey Jr., who led the American League with 40 home runs at the time of the strike, summed it up by saying, \"We picked a bad season to have a good year.\" Kevin Mitchell of the Cincinnati Reds, Julio Franco of the Chicago White Sox, and Shane Mack of the Minnesota Twins opted during the strike to play in Japan in 1995.\nBy the third day of the strike, Cleveland Indians owner Richard Jacobs directed that all souvenirs being sold at the Indians' gift shop carrying the words \"inaugural season at Jacobs Field\" be sold at half price.\nThe Colorado Rockies were completing their last season at Mile High Stadium with an attendance of 3,281,511 through 57 home games for an average of 57,570 per game. At that pace, the team would have had a good chance of drawing over 4.6 million fans in their 81 home games if the season had continued. This would have eclipsed the major league season attendance record of 4,483,350 fans set by the Rockies only the season before.\nOne of the few positive notes was that fans were spared from witnessing one of the worst division races in history. The Texas Rangers were leading the newly reformed AL West despite being 10 games under .500. The last-place California Angels were only games out despite having the second-worst record in the majors at 21 games under .500—on pace for 96 losses. In fact, the two last place teams in the other American League divisions (namely, the Detroit Tigers of the AL East and Milwaukee Brewers of the AL Central) had better records than the Rangers.\nThe National League's MVP award was given to Jeff Bagwell. His hand was broken by a pitch on August 10, just before the players' strike began; had the season continued, he would likely have missed the remainder of the year and might not have won the MVP. But because of the timing of his \"lucky break\", Bagwell became just the fourth player in National League history to win the award unanimously.\nThe strike also led to an absurdity. The Minnesota Twins traded Dave Winfield to the Cleveland Indians for a player to be named later. Since the strike led to the season being canceled, no further transactions could be made until it was settled. The Twins would officially be listed as having sold Winfield to the Indians, but the actual transaction was conducted much differently. Instead of the Indians buying the contract outright, team management went out for a meal with Twins management and the Indians paid the tab; this essentially meant that Winfield had been traded for dinner.\nArguably, the biggest storyline of the strike was the New York Yankees. In having the best record in the American League, which was also the second-best record in baseball, 70–43, and a game lead over the Baltimore Orioles in the AL East, the largest division lead of any division leader, the strike cost their captain, Don Mattingly, his best chance at his postseason debut in his 13-year career. The Yankees had not been in the postseason since 1981. Because the Yankees' prior postseason chances had also been cut short by a strike, news media reported on the parallels between the two Yankee teams (1981 and 1994), both of which had division leads taken away by strike actions. Mattingly would reach the playoffs for the first and only time in his playing career the following year, being defeated at the hands of the Seattle Mariners in the ALDS in five games.\nDecember.\nOn December 5, it was announced Richard Ravitch would step down as negotiator for the owners on December 31, 1994. Ravitch instead resigned on December 6, 1994. On December 14, labor talks headed by federal mediator William Usery broke down. The next day, the owners approved a salary cap plan by a vote of 25–3, but agreed to delay implementing it so that another round of talks with the players could be held. On December 23, with negotiations at a standstill, the owners unilaterally implemented a salary cap.\nJanuary 1995.\nOn January 4, 1995, five bills aimed at ending the baseball strike were introduced into Congress. The next day, Fehr declared all 895 unsigned Major League players to be free agents in response to unilateral contract changes made by the owners. On January 10, arbitrator Thomas Roberts awarded 11 players a total of almost $10 million as a result of collusion charges brought against the owners. On January 26, both players and owners were ordered by President Bill Clinton to resume bargaining and reach an agreement by February 6. Unfortunately, President Clinton's deadline came and went with no resolution of the strike. Just five days earlier, the owners agreed to revoke the salary cap and return to the old agreement.\nReplacement players.\nAfter the deadline passed with no compromises, the use of replacement players for spring training and regular season games was approved by baseball's executive council on January 13. Replacement players were reportedly guaranteed US$5,000 for reporting to spring training and another $5,000 if they made the Opening Day roster. Selig declared that, \"We are committed to playing the 1995 season and will do so with the best players willing to play.\"\nOn March 14, the players' union announced that it would not settle the strike if replacement players were used in regular season games, and if results were not voided. Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson was put on an involuntary leave of absence as he refused to manage replacement players.\nReplacement players created major issues for two American League teams. The Toronto Blue Jays could not play games with replacement players or umpires in Ontario, due to labour code amendments passed by the Ontario NDP that prohibited replacement workers. This was confirmed in a March 28, 1994, Ontario Labour Board hearing. Manager Cito Gaston and his coaching staff were sent to work with minor league players, and the team announced that games featuring replacement workers would be played at their spring training facility in Dunedin, Florida. The Baltimore Orioles, owned by prominent union lawyer Peter Angelos, announced they would also not be using replacement players. On March 20, Angelos's Orioles canceled the remainder of their spring training games. The next day, the Maryland House of Delegates approved legislation to bar teams playing at Camden Yards from using replacement players.\nOn March 26, the MLB announced that the 1995 season would be reduced from 162 games per team to 144 games per team as a result of the use of replacement players.\nTelevision deal collapses.\nFollowing the end of the 1993 season, CBS Sports lost the rights to broadcast baseball games on television. Production of nationally televised games was taken over by MLB itself, which sold the games as brokered programming to ABC and NBC as part of a joint venture that was referred to as The Baseball Network. Originally, the idea was for ABC and NBC to share a slate of games aired in prime time during the week, with the two networks alternating coverage of the All-Star Game and World Series and splitting the Division and League Championship Series between them. The agreement was to run for six seasons and end in 1999, with ABC and NBC airing the World Series and All-Star Game three times each; NBC would air the All-Star Game in even numbered years while ABC would do so in odd numbered years, and the network that did not air the All-Star Game would instead carry the World Series. \nThe strike, however, resulted in ABC losing out on two weeks of coverage and the World Series and NBC losing out on all of its allotted regular season games. MLB and the local NBC and ABC stations lost a combined $595 million in advertising revenue, and both networks announced that they would be opting out of the deal after the shortened 1995 season. Both networks would share coverage of the World Series that year, with ABC airing the odd numbered games and NBC the even numbered games.\nFox became the new broadcast partner for MLB in 1996, and has remained as such since. NBC did elect to retain some broadcast rights, however; it continued to air the All-Star Game in even numbered years and retained its rights to air the World Series in odd numbered years until Fox gained exclusive rights to national MLB broadcasts in 2001.\nStrike ends.\nOn March 28, 1995, the players voted to return to work if a U.S. District Court judge supported the National Labor Relations Board's unfair labor practices complaint against the owners (which was filed on March 27). By a vote of 27–3, owners supported the use of replacement players. The strike ended when Judge (and future Supreme Court Justice) Sonia Sotomayor of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction against the owners on March 31. On April 2, 1995, the day before the season was scheduled to start with the replacement players, the strike came to an official end at 232 days. Judge Sotomayor's decision received support from a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which denied the owners' request to stay the ruling.\nAs part of the terms of the injunction, the players and owners were to be bound to the terms of the expired collective bargaining agreement until a new one could be reached and the start of the season would be postponed three weeks, with teams playing an abbreviated 144-game season instead of a 162-game season.\nPost-strike.\n1995 season.\nDuring the first days of the 1995 season, some fans remained irate at both players and owners. Attendance at the games plummeted, as did television ratings, to a greater extent than during the last significant players strike in 1981.\nWhile a total of 50,010,016 fans had attended the 1,600 MLB regular season games played in 1994, averaging 31,256 per game, a total of 50,416,880 fans attended the 2,016 games of the 1995 MLB regular season, for an average attendance of just 25,008 per game. This represented a decline in average attendance of 20% from 1994 to 1995.\nA few of the fans who showed up demonstrated their frustration, and booed the players; the strike was seen as the worst work stoppage in sports history, leaving the game in crisis and some fans shaken and angry.\nAmong the major examples of fan protests:\nThe opening games were played with replacement umpires, the first time since Opening Day 1991 that replacement umpires were used.\nOn August 3, 1995, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a bill calling for the partial repeal of baseball's antitrust exemption to the full Senate. The vote was just 9–8. On August 9, George Nicolau, baseball's impartial arbitrator since 1986, was fired by Major League owners. On September 29, 1995, a three-judge panel in New York voted unanimously to uphold the injunction that brought the end to the strike in April 1995. The owners had appealed the injunction issued on March 31, but the panel said the Players Relations Committee had illegally attempted to eliminate free agency and salary arbitration.\nReplacement players on postseason teams.\nWhile replacement players from the 1995 spring training were allowed to play on postseason teams, these players were not allowed to have their names or likenesses on any commemorative merchandise; furthermore, they could not be featured in video games or tabletop games, and were instead replaced by placeholder players. The affected players include Shane Spencer of the 1998, 1999, and 2000 New York Yankees; Damian Miller of the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks; Brendan Donnelly of the 2002 Anaheim Angels; Kevin Millar of the 2004 Boston Red Sox; and Jamie Walker of the 2006 Detroit Tigers.\nLong-term impact.\nArguably the largest impact was to the Montreal Expos. The strike was considered to be start of the franchise's downfall in Montreal, eventually leading to them relocating to Washington, D.C., to become the current Washington Nationals. Not only did their dream season (the best record in MLB, six games ahead of the Atlanta Braves in the NL East) end abruptly, they were forced to lower payroll and sell off their four highest-paid stars (Marquis Grissom, Ken Hill, Larry Walker, and John Wetteland) in the span of less than a week in spring training. With the strike negatively affecting its fan base, the Expos would never recover from the incident. Despite respectable performances in 1996, 2002 and 2003, the team never came close to contending again; the team was purchased by Major League Baseball after the 2001 season, and would become the focus of contraction rumors until the team was moved to Washington, D.C., to become the Washington Nationals after the 2004 season. The franchise won its first World Series in 2019, as the Nationals.\nAfter the 1994–95 strike, players' strikes became less common, although major professional sports leagues have seen lockouts amidst labor disputes between owners and players' unions."

        "text": "Courtney Keith \"Bingo\" Allen (August 21, 1923 – February 4, 2014) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman and National Hockey League (NHL) head coach and general manager. He played 28 games in the NHL for the Detroit Red Wings during the 1953–54 and 1954–55 seasons. The rest of his career, which lasted from 1941 to 1957, was spent in various minor leagues. \nAfter his playing career, he turned to coaching and managing, first in the minor Western Hockey League before returning to the NHL in 1967 as the first coach and general manager of the Philadelphia Flyers. He coach the Flyers from 1967 to 1969, staying as general manager until 1983. He was the executive vice-president of the Philadelphia Flyers, a position he held from 1980 for the rest of his life.\nPlaying career.\nAllen played junior hockey for the Saskatoon Quakers in 1940–41, and then joined the Washington Eagles of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League for the 1941–42 season, followed by a year with the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League. During the Second World War, he played on the Saskatoon Navy hockey team, and then played the 1945–46 season in the Western Canada Senior Hockey League with the Saskatoon Elks.\nIn 1946, Allen joined the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League, for whom he played the next five seasons. The Indians moved to Syracuse in 1951, becoming the Warriors, and he was a steady presence in the line-up for the next two and a half seasons. In February 1954, Warriors owner Eddie Shore tried to assign Allen to the Springfield Indians of the Quebec Hockey League, but he (along with several other players) balked and he was suspended. He was sold to the Detroit Red Wings two weeks later. He played 10 games with Detroit in the 1953–54 season and appeared in the playoffs, getting his name engraved on the Stanley Cup. Allen played another 18 games for the Red Wings in 1954–55, which would be the end of his NHL playing career.\nHe spent most of the 1954–55 season in the Western Hockey League with the Edmonton Flyers—Detroit's farm team, whose roster included future Hockey Hall of Fame inductees Johnny Bucyk, Norm Ullman, Glenn Hall, Al Arbour, and player-coach Bud Poile. He then played one season with the Brandon Regals before being hired by the Seattle Americans as player-head coach in 1956. He retired as a player in 1957 to become a full-time coach.\nCoaching/management career.\nFrom 1956 to 1965, Allen was a head coach in the Western Hockey League with the Seattle Americans/Seattle Totems, with only one losing season in eight years. With the NHL expansion in 1967, Allen was hired as the first head coach of the Philadelphia Flyers, with his former coach and teammate Bud Poile as general manager. In their inaugural season, the Flyers finished first in their division with the best record among the six new teams. They fell to third place in their division in the 1968–69 NHL season, and Allen then became the Flyers' general manager while serving in the same capacity with the Quebec Aces at the same time. There, he would help construct the famed \"Broad Street Bullies\" that led the Flyers to consecutive Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975. He would also help start the AHL's Maine Mariners, one of the most successful franchises in that league's history.\nAllen was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a Builder in 1992. He was the executive vice-president of the Flyers.\nLife.\nHe was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.\nAllen was married to Joyce Webster for 65 years. Together they had a daughter, Traci, and two sons, Brad and Blake. Relocating from Seattle in the 1960s, he and his wife Joyce settled in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.\nDue to developing dementia in his later years, Allen lived in the care of an assisted living community, along with wife Joyce, in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. He died on February 4, 2014. He was 90-years-old."

He began playing minor hockey in Galt, Ontario, and was offered a chance to officiate games. Armstrong accepted and later earned his Ontario Hockey Association certification.\nCareer.\nArmstrong officiated his first National Hockey League game on November 17, 1957, when he was 24. In the game, which was between the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs, the two teams got into a brawl near the end of the game. Armstrong broke up a fight involving Fern Flaman, who later skated up to him with his arm dangling and proclaimed \"you broke my arm!\". However it turned out that Flaman was only kidding.\nDuring his career, he had only been seriously injured once and had never missed any games, which helped him gain the nickname \"ironman\". His one major injury came in 1971 when Philadelphia Flyers player Gary Dornhoefer fell along the boards, and knocked Armstrong up against the glass. Dornhoefer's stick cut Armstrong's hand and broke a bone, forcing him to wear a cast for three months. On October 16, 1973, Armstrong was honoured in a ceremony at the Detroit Olympia for officiating his 1,314th game, which broke the previous record set by George Hayes.\nIn total, Armstrong officiated a total of 1,744 games and retired in 1978. After retiring, he became a scout for the Montreal Canadiens. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as an official in 1991.\nPersonal life.\nArmstrong has two children, daughter Lezleigh and son, Doug Armstrong, who became general manager of the Dallas Stars. Following his tenure with Dallas, Doug became the executive vice president and general manager of the St. Louis Blues and won the Stanley Cup in 2019."

        "text": "Eric Shelton (born June 23, 1983) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the second round of the 2005 NFL draft. He played college football for the Louisville Cardinals.\nShelton has also been a member of the Washington Redskins.\nEarly years.\nShelton attended Bryan Station High School in Lexington, Kentucky, where he played both running back and linebacker and twice earned state Class 4A Player of the Year honors. He totaled 4,970 yards rushing with 59 touchdowns and 129 tackles with 11 sacks and 41 stops for losses during his career. Shelton was a First-team USA Today and Parade All-American and was also an All-State track performer who competed in the high hurdles, triple jump and 4x100 relay. It was in high school that he met his future wife Shamea. He was on Tom Lemming's Top 100 highschool recruits, ranked at #6 in the nation \nCollege career.\nFlorida State.\nShelton started his collegiate career at Florida State University, where he played one season as a true freshman for the Seminoles. He finished fourth on the team with 29 carries for 130 yards (4.5 avg.) but was disappointed with his playing time and decided to transfer to Louisville. As a result of NCAA transfer rules, however, he was forced to sit out the 2002 season.\nLouisville.\nShelton attended the University of Louisville, and in his junior year (in 2004) he led the Cardinals in rushing (938 yards) and touchdowns (20). His touchdown total tied the single season Louisville touchdown record (since broken by Michael Bush with 23 in 2005) and he also tied a Louisville record by rushing for five touchdowns in a game versus East Carolina University. He ranked sixth in the nation with 120 points. In 22 games with the Cardinals, he totaled 1,728 yards on 312 carries (5.5 avg) and had 30 touchdown runs. His 30 touchdowns rank third all time at Louisville despite his only playing two years there.\nProfessional career.\nCarolina Panthers.\nShelton was drafted in the second round (54th overall) of the 2005 NFL draft by the Carolina Panthers with a pick they obtained from the Seattle Seahawks. Shelton's NFL career got off to a rough start as he was placed on injured reserve at the beginning of the 2005 NFL season due to a broken foot. In the 2006 season, Shelton rushed for 23 yards on only eight carries, and was activated in only eight games. After a disappointing career with the Panthers he was released by them on September 1, 2007.\nWashington Redskins.\nOn January 9, 2008, the Washington Redskins signed Shelton to a future contract. He was waived/injured with a neck injury on July 30 and subsequently placed on injured reserve. He was released with an injury settlement on August 15.\nPersonal life.\nShelton and his wife Shamea had their wedding documented on episode six of the first season of \"My Big Fat Fabulous Wedding\", a show on WE, Women's Entertainment Network. The final cost for the Lexington, KY wedding was $270,000, funded by Shelton's endorsement money."

        "text": "The 1999 Australian Open was a tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia. It was the 87th edition of the Australian Open and was held from 18 through 31 January 1999. This was the first Grand Slam of the calendar year. Total attendance for the event reached 391,504.\nIn the singles competition, Petr Korda and Martina Hingis were the defending champions. Korda was unseeded at this tournament and was eliminated in the third round by American 15th seed Todd Martin. This loss resulted in him falling down the rankings from 20th to 76th. Later in July, Korda received a suspension from tennis by the ITF after testing positive for nandrolone at Wimbledon last year. Yevgeny Kafelnikov, on the other hand, ended up becoming the men's champion, defeating surprise finalist Swede Thomas Enqvist in four sets. With this win, Kafelnikov became the first Russian, male or female, to win an Australian Open title. In the women's singles, two-time defending champion Martina Hingis successfully defended her title, defeating another surprise finalist in Frenchwoman Amélie Mauresmo. This win allowed Hingis to join Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles as the only women to have won three consecutive Australian Open titles. Amélie Mauresmo would later become the World No. 1 in 2004, and despite being one of the top players of the early to mid-2000s, this would be her only Grand Slam final until the 2006 Australian Open, which she won.\nIn doubles, the defending champions were Jonas Björkman and Jacco Eltingh for the men's, Martina Hingis and Mirjana Lučić for the women's, and Venus Williams and Justin Gimelstob for the mixed. Eltingh did not participate at this year's Australian Open, leaving Björkman to team up with Australia's Pat Rafter. Rafter and Björkman later won the title, defeating the Indian first seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes in five sets. Hingis and Lučić also separated, with Hingis teaming up with Anna Kournikova and Lučić teaming up with Mary Pierce. Lučić and Pierce fell in the first round, but Hingis and Kournikova went on to win, by defeating first seeds Lindsay Davenport and Natasha Zvereva at the final. The mixed doubles competition saw Williams and Gimelstob not competing, and none of the seeds reaching past the second round. In the end, the South African team of Mariaan de Swardt and David Adams won, defeating Williams' sister Serena and her partner Max Mirnyi in the final.\nThe Juniors Competition saw the first ever junior double, with Kristian Pless and Virginie Razzano both winning their respective singles and doubles titles. Pless defeated Mikhail Youzhny in the singles before teaming up with Jürgen Melzer to defeat the Czech team of Ladislav Chramosta and Michal Navrátil in the doubles. Razzano defeated Katarína Bašternáková in the singles final and teamed up Eleni Daniilidou to defeat South Africans Natalie Grandin and Nicole Rencken in straight sets. The last time a boy won both the singles and doubles title at a Grand Slam was Roger Federer at the previous year's Wimbledon, while the last girl was Cara Black at the Wimbledon the year before. Julien Jeanpierre and Mirjana Lučić were the last players to win Australian Open Junior singles and doubles titles in the same year; in 1998 and 1997 respectively.\nEvents.\nSeniors.\nThere were five competitions open to professional tennis players. The Association of Tennis Professionals and Women's Tennis Association awarded ranking points in all events apart from the mixed doubles. The singles draws were contested by one hundred and twenty eight players, while sixty four teams partook in the doubles events, and thirty two teams lined up in the mixed doubles competition.\nMen's singles.\nWith World No. 1 Pete Sampras absent, along with World No. 2 and last year's finalist Marcelo Ríos, the No. 1 spot was thought to be up for grabs coming into this year's Australian Open.&lt;ref name=\"ATP Rankings For 2/1/1999\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Andre Agassi was considered the favourite, having won the 1995 Australian Open and having what was thought to be an easy path to the semifinals, Carlos Moyá being the only player considered to be a threat to him. Patrick Rafter was also considered a favourite, despite having in-form players Thomas Enqvist and Mark Philippoussis in his path. Àlex Corretja was another possibility to claim the No. 1 spot, being the World No. 3 and only a third round appearance to defend.\nWith Ríos' withdrawal, Àlex Corretja was the top seed at No. 2, with US Open champion Patrick Rafter, French Open champion Carlos Moyá and Andre Agassi following. Tim Henman, last year's semifinalist Karol Kučera, Greg Rusedski, Richard Krajicek and Yevgeny Kafelnikov made up the rest of the top 10 seeds. Despite being the defending champion, Petr Korda was not seeded as he was outside the Top 17.\nThe first round saw the first upset of the tournament, with Moyá falling to World No. 37 Nicolas Kiefer in four sets. 12th seed Albert Costa, 13th seed Cédric Pioline and 16th seed Thomas Johansson also fell in the first round. Corretja, 15th seed Todd Martin and Korda all survived five set encounters. The second round saw the end of Corretja's No. 1 dreams as went down in four sets to World No. 86 Christian Ruud. Rusedski was also the victim of an upset, falling to qualifier Paul Goldstein also in four sets. The third round saw further upsets, as Rafter fell in four sets to Enqvist, Henman went down to Swiss Marc Rosset in three, and Krajicek went down to Wayne Ferreira in five. The third round also saw the end of Korda, falling to Martin in five sets; and Kafelnikov survive an encounter with 1992 and 1993 champion Jim Courier, Courier having retired in the fourth set.\nThe fourth round saw Martin, Kafelnikov and Kučera being the only seeds to progress to the quarterfinals. 14th seed Mark Philippoussis fell to Enqvist, and Agassi was defeated by World No. 44 Vincent Spadea in four sets. Unseeded players Tommy Haas, Nicolás Lapentti and Marc Rosset also progressed. The quarterfinals saw the end of Martin, being defeated by Kafelnikov in three sets. It also saw Haas defeating Spadea, and Enqvist continuing his good form against Rosset. The quarterfinals also witnessed the end of Kučera, being defeated in a five-set contest against Lapentti. This meant that Sampras would not be forfeiting his No. 1 ranking as previously predicted.\nThe semifinals saw the final seed in the draw, Kafelnikov, progressing past Haas in three sets to reach his first Grand Slam final since 1996. His opponent was Enqvist, who also passed to the final in three sets, defeating Lapentti. The final saw Enqvist win the first set, before Kafelnikov came back to take the next three. Kafelnikov's ranking rose to No. 3 following this tournament, and he became the first Russian tennis player to win the Australian Open.\nChampionship match result\n Yevgeny Kafelnikov defeated Thomas Enqvist, 4–6, 6–0, 6–3, 7–6(7–1)\nWomen's singles.\nThe seeds of the 1999 Australian Open were led by the previous year's Grand Slam champions. US Open champion Lindsay Davenport was the first seed, Australian Open champion Martina Hingis came second, Wimbledon champion Jana Novotná was third and French Open champion Arantxa Sánchez Vicario was fourth. Following behind came Venus Williams, four-time Australian Open champion Monica Seles, 1995 Australian Open champion Mary Pierce, Patty Schnyder, last year's Australian Open finalist Conchita Martínez, and four-time Australian Open winner Steffi Graf. Dominique Van Roost, Anna Kournikova, Irina Spîrlea, Sandrine Testud, Natasha Zvereva and Amanda Coetzer were also seeded.\nThe first round of the women's singles saw every seed go through except for 13th seed Irina Spîrlea, who lost to former finalist and last year's semifinalist Anke Huber, 7–5, 6–4. There was a scare, however, for 5th seed Venus Williams, who dropped the first set to World No. 82 Croatian Silvija Talaja, 3–6, and was struggling through the third; at one point being two points away from defeat. However, in the end, she managed to survive, winning, 3–6, 6–3, 9–7. The second round was the setting for the first major upset of the tournament when 4th seed and two-time finalist Arantxa Sánchez Vicario fell easily to the World No. 24 Barbara Schett, 6–2, 6–2. 8th seed Patty Schnyder also fell in the second round to teenage Frenchwoman and World No. 29, Amélie Mauresmo, 6–7(1–7), 6–4, 6–3.\nThe third round saw 15th seed Natasha Zvereva fall to Chanda Rubin in three sets, last year's finalist and 9th seed Conchita Martínez go down in three sets to Émilie Loit in what was Loit's first Top 10 victory, and another major upset when 3rd seed Jana Novotná lost to Spaniard María Sánchez Lorenzo, 6–3, 6–0. 14th seed Sandrine Testud was almost the victim of another upset, but she saved two match points against her opponent Serena Williams and defeated her, 6–2, 2–6, 9–7. The third round also saw the end of home dreams, when Aussies Nicole Pratt and Jelena Dokić both fell to Amélie Mauresmo and Martina Hingis respectively. The fourth round saw an easy progression for the World No. 1 Lindsay Davenport over the last qualifier remaining, Canadian Maureen Drake. Fellow Americans Venus Williams and Monica Seles also had easy wins; as did Steffi Graf, Mary Pierce and Dominique Van Roost. Defending champion Martina Hingis lost the second set to Amanda Coetzer, but came back to easily take the third, 6–1. The final spot in the quarterfinals was decided by an all-French match between Émilie Loit and Amélie Mauresmo. Mauresmo won the first set without losing a game, and then went on to win the second set, 7–5, despite a valiant effort from Loit.\nThe quarterfinals saw Davenport easily defeat Williams, Hingis breeze through Pierce, and Seles coming back from 4–5 down in the first set to defeat Graf, 7–5, 6–1, which would be the last match in their rivalry which Seles won; and her only post-stabbing victory over Graf. Surprise quarterfinalist Mauresmo continued her momentum, causing another upset by defeating Van Roost in two sets. In the semifinals, Mauresmo went on to cause the biggest upset of the tournament, by defeating the World No. 1 Davenport in three sets, 4–6, 7–5, 7–5, despite Davenport leading 4–2 in the third set. On the other side, Martina Hingis reached her third consecutive Australian Open final, having defeating Monica Seles, 6–2, 6–4, and restricting Seles' Open Era record for an Australian Open winning streak made by a woman to 33. In the final, Hingis defeated Mauresmo in straight sets, 6–2, 6–3. With this win, Hingis joined Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles as the only women to have won three consecutive Australian Open titles.\nChampionship match result\n Martina Hingis defeated Amélie Mauresmo, 6–2, 6–3\nMen's doubles.\nLast year's double star and defending champion Jacco Eltingh retired at the end of the previous year, so his former partner Jonas Björkman teamed up with countryman Patrick Rafter as the fifth seed.\nThe other top seeds were \"Indian Express\" (Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes) at No. 1, the \"Woodies\" (Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde) at No. 2, Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor at No. 3, and Ellis Ferreira and Rick Leach at No. 4. Former Eltingh partner Paul Haarhuis teamed up with Patrick Galbraith to make the sixth seeded team. Frenchmen Olivier Delaître and Fabrice Santoro were No. 7; and Sébastien Lareau and Alex O'Brien came at No. 8.\nThe first round saw half of the No. 9 to No. 16 seeds fall; and Lareau and O'Brien joining them. Knowles and Nestor fell in the second round, and Delaître and Santoro went out in the third round. Apart from those casualties, however, all of the Top 8 made the quarterfinals. Also in the quarterfinals were Americans Richey Reneberg and Jonathan Stark, Gustavo Kuerten and Nicolás Lapentti; and tenth seeds Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Daniel Vacek.\nKuerten and Lapentti withdrew from the quarterfinals due to Lapentti's unexpected run to the semifinals of the singles competition. As such, Björkman and Rafter (who would've been their opponents) got an effective bye to the semifinals of the doubles. First seeds Bhupathi and Paes joined them, after triumphing over Reneberg and Stark; second seeds Woodbridge and Woodforde followed, defeating Kafelnikov and Vacek; and fourth seeds Ferreira and Leach also went through, defeating Galbraith and Haarhuis.\nBhupathi and Paes easily defeated Ferreira and Leach, 7–6(7–1), 6–3, 7–6(7–5) to end up in the final, where they were joined by Björkman and Rafter; who came back from two sets down to defeat the Woodies, 3–6, 4–6, 6–2, 6–2, 8–6. The final of the men's doubles ended up also going to five sets after Bhupathi and Paes won a very close tiebreaker in the fourth (12–10). However, Björkman and Rafter took out the fifth set 6–4 to claim Björkman's second and Rafter's only Grand Slam doubles title.\nChampionship match result\n Jonas Björkman / Patrick Rafter defeated Mahesh Bhupathi / Leander Paes, 6–3, 4–6, 6–4, 6–7(10–12), 6–4\nWomen's doubles.\nWith none of the teams present having won a Grand Slam doubles title together, the competition was wide open. Lindsay Davenport and Natasha Zvereva were the first seeds, having lost in the finals of all the Grand Slams last year. Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs followed them as the second seed, while last year's doubles star and defending champion Martina Hingis and her new doubles partner Anna Kournikova were the third seed. Veterans Larisa Neiland and Arantxa Sánchez Vicario teamed up to make the fourth seed, while Elena Likhovtseva and Ai Sugiyama came in at No. 5. Conchita Martínez and Patricia Tarabini; Mariaan de Swardt and Elena Tatarkova; and Irina Spîrlea and Caroline Vis were the rest of the top eight seeds. Hingis' former doubles partner and fellow defending champion Mirjana Lučić teamed up with Mary Pierce as the sixteenth seed.\nThe first round saw one major casualty in Martínez and Tarabini, who fell to wildcards Jelena Dokić and Åsa Carlsson. The first round also saw a quick end to Lučić and Pierce, who fell in straight sets to Christina Singer and Helena Vildová. The second round saw the fall of Likhovtseva and Sugiyama, and Spîrlea and Vis. The only major casualty of the third round was de Swardt and Tatarkova.\nAll the top three seeds made it to the semifinals, and they were joined by the up-and-coming Williams sisters, who defeated Neiland and Sánchez Vicario en route. Davenport and Zvereva defeated the Williams sisters to reach the final, in what is their fifth consecutive Grand Slam final; and Davenport's fourth consecutive Australian Open final in doubles. They were joined by Hingis and Kournikova, in what is also Hingis' fifth consecutive Grand Slam doubles final and Kournikova's first. Hingis and Kournikova triumphed in straight sets, 7–5, 6–3, to make Hingis' fifth doubles Grand Slam win and the fifth doubles Grand Slam defeat of Davenport and Zvereva.\nChampionship match result\n Martina Hingis / Anna Kournikova defeated Lindsay Davenport / Natasha Zvereva, 7–5, 6–3\nMixed doubles.\nThe seeds for the mixed doubles title were led by 1991 French Open finalists Caroline Vis and Paul Haarhuis. Anna Kournikova and Mark Knowles came second, while Rennae Stubbs and Jim Grabb and Mirjana Lučić and Mahesh Bhupathi followed.\nIn a massive surprise, all of the top three seeds fell in the first round, with No. 6 seeds Katrina Adams and Leander Paes and No. 8 seeds Lisa Raymond and Patrick Galbraith following. The second round saw no seeds progressing to the quarterfinals. Lučić and Bhupathi fell to Kimberly Po and Donald Johnson; No. 5 seeds Larisa Neiland and Rick Leach went down to Debbie Graham and Ellis Ferreira; while No. 7 seeds Elena Tatarkova and Cyril Suk were defeated by Mariaan de Swardt and David Adams.\nThe semifinals had Manon Bollegraf and Pablo Albano, who defeated Vis and Haarhuis earlier, draw against wildcards Serena Williams and Max Mirnyi, who defeated Stubbs and Grabb. The other side had Graham and Ferreira drawn against de Swardt and Adams. Williams and Mirnyi easily defeated Bollegraf and Albano in straight sets, while de Swardt and Adams came back from a set down to defeat Graham and Ferreira. In the final, de Swardt and Adams triumphed after losing the second set to take the decider in a close tiebreak.\nChampionship match result\n Mariaan de Swardt / David Adams defeated Serena Williams / Max Mirnyi, 6–4, 4–6, 7–6(7–5)\nJuniors.\nBoys' singles.\nDane Kristian Pless headed the seeds of the Boys' Singles, with Jarkko Nieminen, Ladislav Chramosta, Éric Prodon and Jaroslav Levinský made up the rest of the Top 5.\nAll the seeds passed the first round without severe difficulty. The first upsets came in the second round Chramosta fell to American Levar Harper-Griffith, and fellow seeds David Martin, Mark Hilton and Alex Bogomolov Jr. joining him.\nThe quarterfinals consisted off Pless, 8th seed Jean-Christophe Faurel, Harper-Griffith, Francesco Aldi (who upset 7th seed Andy Roddick en route), Levinský, Prodon, Simone Amorico (who upset 6th seed Jürgen Melzer) and Mikhail Youzhny (who defeated Nieminen). Pless defeated Faurel, Aldi defeated Harper-Griffith, and Youzhny defeated Amorico all in two sets, while Levinský took three sets involving a lengthy third set to defeat Prodon, 3–6, 6–0, 9–7.\nPless only dropped two games to defeat Aldi and advance to the final. His opponent was Youzhny, who defeated Levinský, 7–6, 7–5. Pless defeated Youzhny, 6–4, 6–3, to capture the Boys' Singles title.\nChampionship match result\n Kristian Pless defeated Mikhail Youzhny, 6–4, 6–3\nGirls' singles.\nThe field for this year's Girls' Singles was headed by Nadia Petrova, who despite being the first seed, had to go through the qualifying. Slovenia's Tina Hergold was seeded second, and Wynne Prakusya was third, despite also having to go through qualifying. Greek Eleni Daniilidou and American Ansley Cargill made the rest of the Top 5.\nThe first round saw a quick end to Cargill, winning only three games against Italian qualifier Flavia Pennetta. 7th seed Iveta Benešová also departed, along with 15th seed Györgyi Zsíros. Three further seeds were defeated in the second round: Czech 8th seed Dája Bedáňová, 11th seed Michelle Gerards, and 16th seed Aniela Mojzis.\nPetrova, Hergold and Daniilidou all made the quarterfinals. Prakusya was upset in three sets by New Zealand's 12th seed Leanne Baker. 13th Virginie Razzano also made it the quarterfinals, as did 9th seed Katarína Bašternáková by defeating American 8th seed Laura Granville en route. Unseeded players Hannah Collin and Roberta Vinci also made a quarterfinal appearance.\nPetrova and Hergold defeated Collin and Vinci to reach the semifinals in two sets. Bašternáková disposed of Baker in three to meet Hergold, while Razzano dropped the first set but won the next two to upset Daniilidou and meet Petrova. The semifinals saw Razzano stun Petrova by defeating the Russian in straight sets. Bašternáková was struggling against Hergold, but ended up winning in three sets to make a final appearance. Razzano ended up dominating Bašternáková in the final, only dropping two games to win.\nChampionship match result\n Virginie Razzano defeated Katarína Bašternáková, 6–1, 6–1\nBoys' doubles.\nAmericans Bo Hodge and David Martin were the first seeds. Czechs Ladislav Chramosta and Michal Navrátil came second, while Jürgen Melzer teamed up with the first seed in singles, Kristian Pless, as the third seeded team.\nThe first round saw an early exit to Hodge and Martin, falling to Canadians Philip Gubenco and Charles-Antoine Sévigny. South African fifth seeds Andrew McDade and Dirk Stegmann, Norwegian fifth seeds Stian Boretti and Jørgen Vestli, and American sixth seeds Simone Amorico and Alex Bogomolov Jr. also fell. The remaining seeds then proceeded through the quarterfinals without too much trouble.\nChramosta and Navrátil got a virtual bye through to the semifinals after their opponents, Maximilian Abel and Jaroslav Levinský, withdrew. Melzer and Pless passed easily to the semifinals, as did Italian fourth seeds Francesco Aldi and Stefano Mocci. Gubenco and Sévigny also advanced.\nMelzer and Pless fought off a three-set contest from their Canadian opponents to win, 6–2, 4–6, 6–2. The other semifinal match saw Chramosta and Navrátil recover from losing the first set in a tiebreak, to win the second in another tiebreak and the third in a bagel. The first set of the final also ended up being a tiebreak, which went to the Czechs. However, Melzer and Pless came back, only dropping three games, to take the next two sets and the championships.\nChampionship match result\n Jürgen Melzer / Kristian Pless defeated Ladislav Chramosta / Michal Navrátil, 6–7, 6–3, 6–0\nGirls' doubles.\nThe American team of Ansley Cargill and Lindsay Dawaf led the field, with Dája Bedáňová and Aniela Mojzis following as the second seeds, and Slovaks Katarína Bašternáková and Zuzana Kučová coming in third.\nThe first round witnessed the defeat of the fourth seeded Czechs Dominika Luzarová and Iveta Benešová, as well as the defeat of the sixth, seventh and eighth seeds. The second round saw one further upset, with Cargill and Dawaf falling to Eleni Daniilidou and Virginie Razzano. Despite winning the first set, 6–4, the Americans only won one game in the final two sets.\nBedáňová and Mojzis progressed through to the semifinals by defeating Aussies Monique Adamczak and Sarah Stone in three sets. No such success came, however, for Bašternáková and Kučová, as they fell in two sets to South African fifth seeds Natalie Grandin and Nicole Rencken. Daniilidou and Razzano also progressed, while the final spot in the semifinals was won by home hopes Melanie-Ann Clayton and Nicole Sewell.\nClayton and Sewell won the first set against Daniilidou and Razzano, but the Europeans prevailed, 3–6, 6–3, 6–4. The other semifinal match also went to three sets, but Grandin and Rencken ended up defeating Bedáňová and Mojzis, 6–4, 4–6, 6–4. The final was decisive, with Daniilidou and Razzano dominating Grandin and Rencken throughout, only dropping two games to win, 6–1, 6–1.\nChampionship match result\n Eleni Daniilidou / Virginie Razzano defeated Natalie Grandin / Nicole Rencken, 6–1, 6–1\nPrize money.\nTotal prize money for the event was A$11,008,700.\nExternal links.\n "

        "text": "Andy Kelly (born June 6, 1968) is a former American football quarterback in the Arena Football League (AFL). He played in the AFL for fifteen seasons for a total of eight different teams. He also played for two seasons for the Rhein Fire of the former World League of American Football (WLAF). He played college football at the University of Tennessee from 1988 to 1991.\nEarly years.\nKelly attended Rhea County High School in Evensville, Tennessee. As a member of the Golden Eagles high school football team, he won Gatorade All-America honors in football as a senior.\nCollege career.\nKelly was a successful collegiate quarterback at the University of Tennessee from 1988–1991 under head coach Johnny Majors. He took over as a starter for Sterling Henton in the 1989 SEC rivalry game against the Alabama Crimson Tide. He became part of Tennessee football lore as part of team that accomplished a 35–34 victory at Notre Dame, later dubbed as \"The Miracle at South Bend\". The Vols trailed at one point 31–7 before Kelly helped instrument a comeback to beat the Fighting Irish. He set numerous Tennessee and SEC passing records, most of them broken by his later successor at Tennessee, Peyton Manning.\nProfessional career.\nKelly's predominant professional football career was as an Arena Football League quarterback, playing some of his career with the New Orleans VooDoo, for whom he played for in 2005 and 2007, and which was the last team for which he actively appeared as a player. He previously played for the Charlotte Rage (1993, 1995–96), Nashville Kats (1997–2001), Dallas Desperados (2002), Detroit Fury (2003–2004), Kansas City Brigade (2006), and Utah Blaze (2006). At the end of the 2006 season, he held several all-time AFL career records, including touchdown passes (767), passing yards (39,948), pass attempts (5,827), pass completions (3,621), and interceptions (155).\nOn Friday, April 27, 2007, in a 72–57 home loss to their division-mate, the Georgia Force, Kelly joined Aaron Garcia, Clint Dolezel, and Sherdrick Bonner as the only quarterbacks in professional football history to throw for over 800 career touchdowns.\nOn December 6, 2007, Kelly was named the head coach of the proposed new All American Football League's Tennessee team. However, the league suspended operations March 12, 2008 (permanently, as things later developed, although only a delay was announced at the time), and Kelly signed with the Georgia Force two weeks later on March 26, 2008, but never actually participated in any games as an active player for the Force. Kelly retired as an Arena Football player following the 2008 season and currently serves as a commentator on Tennessee Volunteers football radio broadcasts.\nIn June 2013, Kelly was nominated for the Arena Football Hall of Fame.\nPersonal life.\nAfter his professional football career, Kelly became a full-time insurance agent for State Farm."

        "title": "Stephen Jones (rugby union)",
        "text": "Stephen Michael Jones (born 8 December 1977) is a Welsh rugby union coach and former player who played primarily at fly-half. He played more than 100 times for Wales and six times for the British &amp; Irish Lions.\nJones was the record cap holder for Wales until he was overtaken by Gethin Jenkins on 15 March 2014. With 970 international points, Jones is eighth in the List of leading rugby union test point scorers, and the second-highest Wales player on the list behind Neil Jenkins.\nAt the end of the 2012–13 season, Jones retired from playing professional rugby to take up a coaching position at London Wasps and in August 2015 he joined the Scarlets as backs coach.\nClub career.\nLlanelli RFC.\nJones was born in Aberystwyth. He joined Llanelli RFC in 1996, staying there until the 2003–04 season. He played his last Welsh club season for the Llanelli Scarlets, the Llanelli side in the Welsh regional setup introduced that year. In his Welsh top-level career, he made more than 200 appearances and scored almost 2,000 points.\nClermont Auvergne.\nIn 2004, he joined Clermont Auvergne, formerly known as Montferrand.\nHe had a successful club career with Clermont and he was chosen by French journalists as the fly-half of the season in his second year at the club.\nScarlets.\nAfter two years at Clermont he returned to play for the Scarlets in 2006. Back in Llanelli, Jones and the team had an excellent run in the Heineken Cup in 2007 and reached the semi-finals after wins home and away against Ulster and Toulouse, and a comfortable home victory against 2006 winners Munster in the quarter-finals. The Scarlets ultimately came unstuck against Leicester in the semi-final.\nJones ended speculation over his future by signing a new three-year contract with the Scarlets. He had been heavily linked with a move to French club Biarritz after triggering a clause in his contract allowing him to talk to other clubs.\nLondon Wasps.\nOn 11 April 2012, it was announced that Jones would be leaving the Scarlets for a second time to join London Wasps at the end of the 2011–12 season. He agreed to a two-year contract that could see him move into a coaching role at the end of his playing career. In February 2013, Jones announced that he would retire from playing a year early, at the end of the 2012–13 season, and move into coaching with Wasps.\nReturn to Scarlets.\nOn 12 January 2015, it was announced that Jones would be returning to Scarlets at the end of the 2014-15 season as backs coach.\nRepresentative career.\nWales.\nJones made his international debut for Wales in 1998 against South Africa.\nJones played a prominent role in Wales' Grand Slam triumph of 2005. As a fly-half, he scored the majority of the team's points, his best game being the victory in Paris, in which he scored 14 points including a drop goal and made a 60-metre break that led to Martyn Williams' first try. In the championship decider against Ireland at the Millennium Stadium, he scored another 16 points and steered Wales to their first Grand Slam for 27 years. He was later named fly-half of the championship for 2005.\nIn October 2006 head coach Gareth Jenkins named Jones as captain to lead Wales through to the 2007 World Cup. On his appointment of Jones, Jenkins said \"Stephen has all the attributes to make a magnificent captain of his country. He has the respect and regard of his players, leadership qualities that are evident for all to see and the talent and ability to lead from the front at game time\".\nJenkins had a change of heart however, as Jones was replaced by Gareth Thomas as captain for the tournament itself, as Jones was not assured of his place in the Welsh team due to the emergence of James Hook. In his eight outings as Wales captain, Jones led Wales to only one win with six defeats and one draw.\nIn the 2008 RBS Six Nations, Jones made four appearances in his second Grand Slam championship win with Wales. He scored seven conversions and 10 penalties, adding up to 44 points, despite starting the tournament as second choice to James Hook.\nIn the 2009 RBS Six Nations, Jones made five appearances in the competition with Wales. An improvement to the previous year's competition he proved to be the in-form player, cementing his place as the first-choice number 10 for Wales. Jones almost prevented Ireland from winning the Grand Slam in the last minute of the final game of the tournament, but his 50-yard penalty kick fell short.\nJones became the record cap holder for Wales on 26 September 2011 versus Namibia, overtaking the record of 100 caps set by Gareth Thomas.\nJones was selected as part of the 30-man Welsh squad for the Rugby World Cup 2011. He played his 103rd Test against France in the semi-final which Wales lost, coming off the bench to replace James Hook in the 45th minute. His 104th and final cap came in the third-place play-off match against Australia on 21 October 2011.\nIn May 2012, the Barbarians had hoped to select Jones for a match against Wales on 2 June, in which he would potentially play alongside his former half-back partner for the Scarlets and Wales, Dwayne Peel; however, both players were ruled out due to injury.\nBritish &amp; Irish Lions.\nHaving been part of the Wales team that won the 2005 Six Nations Championship Grand Slam with Wales, Jones was the in-form fly-half selected for the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. With four fly-halves in the squad, Jones was involved in just two of the tour matches, starting against the New Zealand Māori and replacing Jonny Wilkinson against Wellington. For the first Test, both Jones and Wilkinson were selected in the starting line-up ahead of Ronan O'Gara and Charlie Hodgson, with Jones at fly-half and Wilkinson at inside centre; however, Jones lost his place in the team for the second Test, with Wilkinson taking over at fly-half. Having lost both of the first two matches, Sir Clive Woodward restored Jones to the starting line-up for the dead rubber third Test, in which he scored 14 points as the Lions lost 38–19. Woodward's decision to select Wilkinson ahead of Jones was questioned by the media, many of whom doubted whether the English fly-half should even have been picked for the tour, having only recently recovered from a serious shoulder injury.\nOn 21 April 2009, Jones was named in the squad for the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa. During 2009, Jones cemented his place as Wales' first-choice number 10 and earned his place in the Lions squad. He started all three Tests and broke the Lions record for most points scored against South Africa in the second Test.\nPersonal life.\nJones and his wife Gwen have three sons together. At the 2014 National Eisteddfod in Llanelli, Jones was honoured by the Gorsedd of Bards for services to Wales.\nA Welsh speaker, Jones is one of several players to have been featured in the S4C series \"Rygbi a Mwy\"."

        "title": "2005 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2005 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2004–05 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs played the Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons for the title, with the Spurs holding home court advantage and the Pistons as defending champions. The series was played under a best-of-seven format (unlike the previous three rounds, the team with home court advantage hosted games one, two, six, and seven if all were necessary). It also marked the Pistons' first NBA Finals loss since 1988.\nThe Spurs won the series four games to three in the first NBA Finals to go to a Game 7 since 1994. The games were broadcast on ABC, with Al Michaels and Hubie Brown commentating. National radio coverage was provided by ESPN Radio through announcers Jim Durham and Dr. Jack Ramsay.\nBackground.\nThis series was not only the first matchup of the previous two NBA champions since the 1987 Finals (Lakers d. Celtics, 4–2), it was a match up of the two premier defensive teams of that era: from the 2002–03 season to the 2004–05 season, the Spurs and Pistons routinely finished in the top three in Points Allowed: in 2003, Detroit was #1 and San Antonio #3; in 2004, the teams finished in a tie for the #1 spot; in 2005, the Spurs were #1 and the Pistons were #2. The Spurs were considered more capable of playing at a faster pace, as evidenced by their convincing win against the high-scoring Phoenix Suns during the Western Conference finals. However, both teams performed exceptionally well when scoring over 100 points (Detroit was 22–3, San Antonio was 28–2).\nGoing into the 2005 Finals, the Spurs had won two championships (1999 and 2003), while Detroit had three (1989, 1990, and 2004). The 2004 Championship was considered a major upset by some sportswriters because of the Lakers' big name talent. Others saw the result as fully legitimate, pointing out that Detroit's defense outplayed the Lakers' offense. Further, the balanced Detroit offense proved especially difficult to deal with when Karl Malone's injured knee left the Lakers without a reliable presence to slow down the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace. Many thought that a contributing factor to the Lakers' loss was the well-publicized tension between superstars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.\nBoth the Spurs and the Pistons were ranked number two in their respective conferences, with the Phoenix Suns ranked number one in the West and the Miami Heat ranked number one in the East.\nSportswriters all across the country generally considered this one of the few \"too-close-to-call\" series to occur. Most picked the series to go to six or seven games.\nThe Spurs breezed through the playoffs with relative ease, compared to the Pistons. They defeated the Nuggets 4–1 to open the playoffs, winning four straight after losing the home opener. They then defeated the SuperSonics within six games the following series. Phoenix was expected by many to put up a challenge, but the Spurs won the series easily, four games to one.\nThe Pistons had a slightly tougher road back to the Finals. The opening round was a fairly easy five-game victory over Philadelphia. Next, the Pistons faced the Indiana Pacers, one of the NBA's most resilient teams. Indiana was expected by most experts to falter and miss the playoffs after the Pacers–Pistons brawl; however, led by retiring Pacers legend Reggie Miller, the Pacers still made the playoffs and unexpectedly won their first-round series against the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. The Pacers mounted a formidable challenge but after a Game Six loss, Reggie Miller's storied 18-year career was over. Detroit's next opponent was the East #1 seed Miami, led by Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O'Neal. After winning Game One, the Pistons fell 2-1 after three games and 3-2 after five games. By winning Game Six on their home court, the Pistons forced a Game Seven. In Game Seven, Detroit overcame the odds to beat the Heat at American Airlines Arena, and thus advanced to the NBA Finals for the second straight year.\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\nFeatures.\nThis was the first NBA Finals to have the sticker version of the Larry O'Brien Trophy adorn the center court (team logo still visible in the middle), with the NBA Finals wordmark logo on opposite ends of the court. This remained in effect until the 2009 NBA Finals; the position of the O'Brien trophy was modified for the 2007 NBA Finals.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nManu Ginóbili was the star of Game 1, turning in a virtuoso performance in the fourth quarter to lead the Spurs to victory. Ginobili scored 15 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to complement a huge game by Tim Duncan (24 points, 17 rebounds).\nGinobili, who in the previous summer led Argentina in points and assists en route to Olympic gold, took over in the final period. He scored eight points in a decisive 12–2 surge that gave the Spurs a 67–55 lead, then throttled a push by the Pistons with a swooping dunk, 3-pointer and running hook for an 81–67 advantage with less than two minutes to go.\nHaving been idle for a week, the Spurs opened the game in lackluster fashion – in the first eight minutes the Spurs trailed 19–7 – but were able to fight back and stabilize the game. It may have happened that Detroit's more recent play led to fourth quarter fatigue which enabled the Spurs' strong fourth quarter; in any case, the Spurs prevailed in the first contest.\nGame 2.\nThe resilient Detroit Pistons were expected to play a stronger Game 2 in response to their fourth-quarter letdown in Game 1. Exactly the opposite occurred. From the opening tip, Game 2 was all San Antonio as the Spurs got out to a quick lead and never looked back.\nThe Spurs took advantage of Detroit's uncharacteristic mistakes throughout the night, which included missing nine shots from inside four feet from the basket. While the Pistons went cold (0-6) from behind the three-point line, the Spurs made 11 3-pointers, including four each by Manu Ginóbili and Bruce Bowen, who did not score a point in Game 1. Ginobili again led the Spurs with a 27 points, while Tim Duncan finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds. Antonio McDyess was the high scorer for Detroit, scoring 15 points off the bench.\nThe 2–0 lead was a big advantage for San Antonio. In the history of the NBA, the team with home-court advantage started a series with a 2–0 lead 153 times. On just seven occasions, the trailing team rebounded to win the series.\nGame 3.\nIn NBA history, only two teams had ever won a Finals series after facing a 2–0 deficit—the Boston Celtics in the 1969 NBA Finals and the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1977 NBA Finals—however, just one year later the Miami Heat would accomplish this feat against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Finals.\nWith that task looming ahead, the Pistons responded in tremendous fashion. Chauncey Billups and Richard Hamilton combined for 44 points, while Ben Wallace (15 pts, 11 reb, 5 blk, 3 stl) together with Rasheed Wallace and Antonio McDyess harassed Tim Duncan into a 5–15 shooting night. The Pistons dominated the second half, outscoring the Spurs 55–37.\nThe Pistons became the first team to score more than 90 points in a Finals game against the Spurs during this game.\nGame 4.\nThe pattern of the first two games held up in games 3 and 4: home team wins big in the first one and even bigger in the second. And Game 4 was the most lopsided of all during the 2005 NBA Finals; the Pistons' 102 points were the only time either team reached triple digits in the series.\nSeven Pistons scored in double figures, especially efficient bench performances by Lindsey Hunter and Antonio McDyess. In 22 minutes, Hunter scored 17 points and dished out 5 assists; McDyess scored 13 and grabbed 7 rebounds in just 19 minutes.\nConversely, only three Spurs scored in double figures (Ginobili, Duncan, Parker), and among all Spurs attempting five or more field goals, only Tony Parker (6-13, 46.2% shooting) managed to surpass the 45% mark. Collectively, the Spurs shot 37% and committed 17 turnovers to the Pistons' NBA Finals-record four.\nHunter's and Billups' 17 points were the fewest to lead an NBA Finals game since George Yardley of the Fort Wayne Pistons led all scorers with 16 points in the fifth game of the 1955 NBA Finals.\nGame 5.\nWith the first four games of the 2005 Finals being blowouts by the home team, Game 5 was the close game everyone was waiting for, and it went down as one of the more memorable games in Finals history.\nThe game was closely contested by throughout the night as the lead changed 12 separate times, and the game was tied on 18 occasions. Regulation was not enough to settle this game, so the game went into overtime. The Pistons streaked out to a quick lead in the first few minutes of overtime, and seemed to have the game in hand. However, a missed layup by Chauncey Billups with Detroit ahead 95–93 with nine seconds left San Antonio with a chance. On the Spurs' next possession, Robert Horry inbounded the ball to Ginobili, who headed for the left corner and dished it right back to Horry. Rasheed Wallace had left Horry to double-team Ginobili, and Horry was left alone to sink the game-winning basket with 5.8 seconds remaining in the OT. Horry was already famous for nailing last-second shots in the playoffs, including Game Four of the 2002 Western Conference finals between the Lakers and Sacramento Kings.\nHorry went 5 for 6 from beyond the arc, including the game-winner, and scored 21 points coming off the bench. He hadn't scored a point until the final play of the 3rd quarter. He carried the team in the fourth quarter and overtime as his teammates struggled with the weight of a must-win game on the road against an accomplished adversary. In addition to the game-winning three-pointer, late in overtime Horry made a spectacular left-handed dunk while being fouled as the shot clock wound down.\nTim Duncan, despite struggling from the free-throw line, finished with 26 points and 19 rebounds for the Spurs. Chauncey Billups was the high scorer for the Pistons, finishing with a game-high 34 points in the losing effort.\nGame 6.\nGame 6 was a close game all along, and the lead kept fluctuating between the two teams. Again, the leading stars on both teams played big games. Detroit pulled away early in the fourth for an 80–73 lead with five minutes to go, but the Spurs continued to threaten them. Soon, it was back to a one-point game.\nThen, Rasheed Wallace planted a three-pointer to pull away, and even with a resilient game by the Spurs, the Pistons had clinched the victory.\nNevertheless, several Pistons free throws were necessary in the final moments of the game to put a win out of reach for the Spurs.\nRasheed Wallace had a big game to atone for the mistake he made for leaving Horry open in Game 5. Despite his mistake, Wallace was nonchalant about the play, even commenting incorrectly that he left Horry to guard Duncan.\nBillups and Prince again led the Pistons with steady, unwavering defense, which is the key, as it is often said, to victory. Although Duncan and Ginobili finished with 21 points each, neither was able to seriously threaten the strong Pistons defense enough to win the game. Detroit thus won its fifth consecutive game facing elimination. The Pistons became the first road team to force a Game 7 in the NBA Finals.\nGame 7.\nFor the first time in eleven years, the NBA Finals came down to a decisive Game 7. Momentum was on Detroit's side, but the Spurs had home-court advantage. The Pistons were looking to become the first team to ever win the last two games on the road after being down 3–2. NBA history was heavily in favor of the Spurs, who were looking to celebrate a title at the SBC Center for the second time in three years. NBA teams are 74–17 all-time at home in Game 7, and 9-0 when leading 3–2 going home.\nEntering this game, the Pistons tied the 1994 New York Knicks for most games played in a single postseason, with 25. The Boston Celtics broke this record during their championship season.\nLike the previous two games of the series, Game 7 was closely contested throughout, but the Spurs fell into a nine-point deficit with 7:45 left in the third quarter. Though Tim Duncan was for much of the series unable to shoot for a high percentage against Detroit's front line, he led the Spurs out of that nine-point hole. In the final 7:45 of the third quarter, Duncan scored 10 of the teams' 18 final third quarter points and the game was tied to start the fourth. Behind clutch plays from Tim Duncan and Manu Ginóbili, the Spurs took control of the fourth quarter to earn an 81–74 victory, clinching the franchise's third Larry O'Brien Trophy. For the game, Tim Duncan finished with a game high 25 points and 11 rebounds, while teammate Manu Ginóbili pitched in with 23 points. Richard Hamilton, with 15 points, was the high scorer for the Pistons, who fell just short of winning back-to-back championships.\nTim Duncan won his third NBA Finals MVP Award. Manu Ginóbili, Tony Parker, and Bruce Bowen each received their second championship ring, while Robert Horry became only the second player in NBA history (John Salley being the first) to play on championship teams for three different franchises. Sean Marks became the first New Zealander to win a championship ring.\nBroadcasting.\nThe games were broadcast exclusively on ABC in the US. The featured song, aired throughout the playoffs, was Rob Thomas' \"This Is How A Heart Breaks.\" Game 3 had a Nielsen rating percentage of only 7.2% of households and cumulating to a 7.1 average for the first three games, 32% lower than the average of the first three 2004 NBA Finals games. While all seven games were the top-rated shows of their nights, the average viewership of the 2005 Finals (11.5 million viewers, 7.6 rating/14 share) decreased from the average of the 2004 Finals (17.9 million, 11.5/20). The 2003 Finals averaged 9.8 million viewers and 6.5/12.\nThe 2005 Finals would be Michaels' last major NBA assignment with ABC, though he remained with the network until after Super Bowl XL in February 2006. Shortly after ABC's NFL TV contract ended, Michaels moved to NBC Sports to become the lead voice of Sunday Night Football. ABC's lead position was eventually filled by Mike Breen.\nAftermath.\nThe Spurs won a franchise-record 63 victories to clinch the top seed in the West in the 2005–06 NBA season. However, for the third time they were unable to win consecutive championships, bowing to their Texas rivals, the Dallas Mavericks, in Game 7 of the Conference semifinals. The Mavs would go on to lose in the 2006 NBA Finals. The Spurs went on to win the 2007 NBA Finals the following year, their fourth as a franchise, and won again in 2014.\n, this is the Pistons’ last appearance in the NBA Finals. Head coach Larry Brown sought and succeeded in buying out his contract as head coach after the season. He eventually ended up coaching for his hometown New York Knicks, but would only win 23 games in the one season. Brown eventually left after the season, and two years later Brown resurfaced, this time coaching the Charlotte Bobcats, where he would lead them to the playoffs in his second year.\nThe Pistons, guided by new coach Flip Saunders, won a franchise-record 64 games and seemed primed to regain the NBA title. However, Detroit fell in six games to the Miami Heat, who would go on and win the 2006 NBA title. Franchise centerpiece Ben Wallace abruptly left for the Chicago Bulls, yet the Pistons still made the conference finals the next two seasons, losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics, respectively. Finally, the remaining core of the team was dismantled at the start of the 2008-09 NBA season."

        "text": "The Singapore Open was a golf tournament in Singapore that was predominantly part of the Asian Tour schedule. The event was held at Sentosa Golf Club since 2005 and since 2017 had been part of the Open Qualifying Series, giving up to four non-exempt players entry into The Open Championship.\nThe Singapore Open was founded in 1961 and was one of the tournaments on the first season of the Far East Circuit (later the Asia Golf Circuit) the following year. It remained part of the Asia circuit until 1993 when it became a fixture on the Australasian Tour. After just 3 seasons, it left the Australasian Tour to join the fledgling Asian Tour for that tour's second season in 1996. The event was also co-sanctioned with the European Tour from 2009 to 2012, and with the Japan Golf Tour since 2016.\nHistory.\nThe Singapore Open was founded in 1961 and was staged annually until 2001, when it was won by Thaworn Wiratchant. Other winners in the years leading up to this included American Shaun Micheel in 1998, who went on to win the 2003 PGA Championship. Other notable winners of the event who went on to win majors, include Ángel Cabrera, Adam Scott and Sergio García.\nIn 2002 the event was cancelled because of lack of sponsorship. It was not revived until 2005, when sponsorship was secured from the Sentosa Leisure Group. The 2005 prize fund was $2 million, which made the Singapore Open by far the richest tournament exclusive to the Asian Tour that was not co-sanctioned by the European Tour, a status it retained until the European Tour first co-sanctioned the event in 2009. Asian Tour chief executive Louis Martin claimed when the revival of the tournament was announced, \"Competing for a prize purse of two million US dollars will give our playing membership a huge boost and elevate the Asian Tour to a new level.\" The 2005 event was played in September.\nThe 2006 Singapore Open offered a purse of US$3 million with a winner's share of US$475,000. In May 2006, it was announced that Barclays Bank would sponsor the event for five years from 2006 and that the prize fund will be increased to US$4 million in 2007 and US$5 million in 2008. In 2011, the purse was US$6,000,000. The 2013 edition was cancelled due to lack of sponsorship.\nAfter a three-year absence, the tournament returned in January 2016. The event was co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and Japan Golf Tour. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation also became the new title sponsor of the event. Song Young-han won the revived event, beating current world number one Jordan Spieth by one shot in the weather-delayed event.\nMatt Kuchar won the 2020 event, beating Justin Rose by three shots.\nThe tournament was not played in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nVenues.\nThe following venues have been used since the founding of the Singapore Open in 1961."

        "title": "Grip (tennis)",
        "text": "In tennis, a grip is a way of holding the racquet in order to hit shots during a match. The three most commonly used conventional grips are: the Continental (or \"Chopper\"), the Eastern and the Semi-Western. Most players change grips during a match depending on what shot they are hitting.\nThe octagonal handle.\nIn order to understand how to measure tennis grips size, it is important to know that the handle of a racquet always consists of 8 sides or, in other words, it has an octagonal shape. A square shape would hurt the hand, while a round shape would not give enough friction to gain a firm grip. The eight sides of the handle are called bevels. They can be numbered from 1 to 8 as follows. If the blade of the racquet is perpendicular to the ground, the bevel facing up is bevel #1. For the right-handed, rotating the racquet counter-clockwise (i.e. exposing to the ground more of the forehand hitting side) the next bevel facing up is bevel #2, and so on to identify all 8 bevels. Symmetrically, for the left-handed the bevel numbering is obtained rotating the racquet clockwise.\nThe grips.\nThe Continental Grip (Bevel #2).\nThis grip is known as \"the Shotgun\". This is due to its strange nature of attack and pressure on the ball. Whenever it is used, the grip must be applied firmly, near the shaft of the racket to properly produce enough effect. This will cause the racket to come explosively on the ball, like a shotgun. Hence, the name \"Shotgun\". The Continental grip is well-suited to slice shots, because it lends itself to positioning the racket face slightly upward. The name reflects its origins on the European continent at a time when grass courts were common and so balls did not bounce as high as on hard courts.\nThe Eastern forehand Grip (Bevel #3).\nThe Eastern forehand grip is primarily used for flatter groundstrokes. In order to execute a proper Eastern forehand grip, players need both index knuckle and heel pad to rest on bevel #3. An easy way to implement this is to place the palm flat against the strings and slide down to the handle and grab, in order to achieve an Eastern forehand. Advantages are this is one of the easiest grips for learning the forehand, easier (faster) to change to a Continental to do some volleying, or slice. The Eastern forehand grip became popular in the Eastern United States as grass courts were replaced by hard courts, causing balls to bounce higher. Notable players with this grip include Juan Martin Del Potro, Roger Federer and Steffi Graf.\nThe Semi-Western Forehand Grip (Bevel #4).\nThe Semi-Western grip is an \"advanced\" form that most players either change to on purpose or naturally find through practice. This grip closes the racket face more upon contact, allowing for more topspin but is still able to generate pace. This grip is the most popular on tour and is used by several greats, such as Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray.\nThe Western Forehand Grip (Bevel #5).\nThe Western grip is one of the more extreme forehand grips used to generate topspin. This grip closes the racket face more than semi-western and was originally used by Rafael Nadal growing up. This grip is great for maximizing margin and hitting deep, loopy balls. Notable players using this grip are Karen Khachanov and Kei Nishikori. Another variation, popularized by Novak Djokovic, is the 3/4 Western grip. For this grip, the knuckle is slightly on the Semi-Western bevel (4) and the heel pad more on the Western side.\nThe Hawaiian Forehand Grip (Bevel #6).\nThe Hawaiian grip is the most extreme forehand grip used to generate heavy topspin. Because of the extreme wrist position, it is not recommended to use because it may cause wrist pain and other joint problems. The nature of the grip is to generate topspin because of the closed racket face. This means that it is harder to drive through the ball, however, it is still possible. The most popular player to use this grip is Jack Sock.\nThe Two-Handed Forehand Grip (F: Bevel #2 + B: Bevel #7).\nThe basic Two-Handed Forehand grip, is obtained by holding the racquet in a regular Continental grip, then placing the left hand above holding it in a left-handed Eastern Forehand grip. This places the reference bevels of the two hands exactly opposite each other. Holding the racquet using two hands for the forehand is highly unusual, but some well-known top WTA players (e.g. Monica Seles, Hsieh Su-wei) have used it successfully. While it shortens the forehand reach and reduces maximum power, it offers unrivalled accuracy, which may more than compensate the former drawbacks. Also, combined with a two-handed backhand, it is almost impossible for the opponent to see which side (backhand or forehand) is hitting the ball. The sides often are equally accurate, and no grip change is required.\nThe Eastern Backhand Grip (Bevel #1).\nThe Eastern Backhand grip is obtained when placing the hand such that the base knuckle of the index finger and heel of the hand are right on bevel #1. This grip allows for significant spin and control. The opposite face of the racket is used compared to the Eastern forehand. For someone who uses a Western forehand grip, on the other hand, the same face of the racket as in the forehand is used to strike the ball; no need to change grips if the forehand is played with a Western grip.\nThe Semi-Western Backhand grip (Bevel #8).\nThe Semi-Western backhand grip is achieved by placing the hand such that the base knuckle of the index finger is right on bevel #8. Compared to the Continental grip, the blade has rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Although not as popular as the Eastern backhand grip, due to the naturally closed position of the racquet, the Semi-Western grip allows for even greater topspin and can still generate pace.\nThis is essentially equivalent to the Semi-Western forehand grip. The same face of the racquet as in the forehand is used to strike the ball. No need to change grips if the forehand is played with a Semi-Western grip.\nThe Semi-Western Two-Handed Backhand Grip (F: Bevel #2 + B: Bevel #6).\nThe basic Two-Handed Backhand grip is obtained by holding the racquet in a regular Continental grip, then placing the left hand above holding it in a left-handed Semi-Western Forehand grip. This places the reference bevels of the two hands exactly opposite each other. Holding the racquet using two hands for the backhand is very common, but there are many variations in the precise positioning of the two hands. This also varies between right- and left-handed players.\nA different face of the racquet than in the forehand is used to strike the ball.\nThe evolution of forehand grips.\nFor a number of years during the first two decades of the 20th century the small, frail player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a Western grip. Few top players used the Western grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the Western forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. With the changes in technology, the various grips have come to be used very differently from previously. First, the Continental grip is used primarily to serve and to volley, not to hit forehand shots, or a backhand slice. The eastern grip is still used, though far less than in the past, and is used to hit very flat shots. It is excellent to hit low passing shots. The most popular grip on the tour is the Semi-Western grip. It gives a nice mix of spin and pace on the forehand, and offers ease to transition to the backhand grip. Finally the Western grip (and its extreme variations), are some of the most radical grips used on the tour, mostly by clay-courters, and are used to create massive amounts of topspin.\nThe evolution of backhand grips.\nThe backhand can be executed with either one or both hands. three of the top 100 ranked women used a one-handed grip. Twenty-four of the top 100 ranked men used a one-handed grip, down from almost 50 a decade earlier.\nFor most of the 20th century the backhand was performed with one hand, using either a backhand Eastern or Continental grip. In modern tennis, there are a few professional players who use a Semi-western one-hand backhand. This shot is held in a similar manner to the Eastern forehand. It has much more topspin potential than the traditional Eastern one-hander. The Semi-western one-handed backhand grip makes it easier for a one-handed player to hit balls at shoulder height, but harder to hit low balls, and vice versa for the eastern one-handed backhand. The eastern one-handed backhand and its variants are used by most pros with strong single-handed backhand drives, like Gustavo Kuerten (now retired), especially Richard Gasquet among the men, and Justine Henin (now retired) among the women.\nThe two-handed backhand is most commonly used with the forehand hand holding the racquet with a Continental grip and the non-dominant hand holding the racquet with a Semi-western forehand grip. While this is by far the most common way to hit a two-handed backhand, there are players who use different ways of holding the racquet for a two-handed backhand.\nThe player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, Don Budge, had a very powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and 1940s that imparted topspin onto the ball. Ken Rosewall, a one-handed backhand, used a tremendously accurate slice backhand with underspin through the 1950s and 1960s. The one-handed backhand slice is often used in rallies as it is a comfortable shot. Andre Agassi in particular increased his use of the one-handed backhand and often hit an unreturnable dropshot with it.\nGrips used for serving.\nThe grip for the serve depends on the type of serve. At professional levels, the continental grip is used to hit all serves. Some players turn the grip more, towards the Eastern backhand grip (bevel #1), to maximize spin during a kick serve. \nTo impart slice onto a serve, the server tosses the ball a little to the right of their body (if they are right-handed) and cuts the ball diagonally to create side and topspin. For a right-hander, the slice serve curves to the left and down in the court. This pulls players out wide or jams them into their body to set up a high, put away ball.\nThere is also the kick serve, widely used for the second serve because of its great margin, ability to drop into the court, and for offsetting opponents because of its spin. For most, the topspin serve is hit by using a Continental forehand grip (bevel #2) and some use an Eastern backhand grip (bevel #1) to generate more spin. "

It was the 115th edition of the Wimbledon Championships, part of the 2001 ATP and WTA Tours, and it was the third Grand Slam tennis event of the year.\nThe tournament was the first in Wimbledon's 124-year history in which 32 players in the men's and women's draws were seeded, instead of the usual sixteen. This move was made to appease clay court players who were unhappy with the traditional seeding system, which favoured grass court results over those of other surfaces.\nPete Sampras was unsuccessful in his defence of the men's singles title, losing in the fourth round to 19-year-old Roger Federer, who was then relatively unknown. Goran Ivanišević won the title, defeating 2000 runner-up Pat Rafter in the final in five sets. Ivanišević had previously been runner-up three times (1992, 1994 and 1998), but had fallen to number 125 in the world by 2001 and had only entered the 2001 tournament after being granted a wild card. Venus Williams successfully defended the women's singles title, beating 19-year-old Justine Henin in the final in three sets. Henin became the first Belgian player to reach a Wimbledon final. Top seed Martina Hingis was beaten by Virginia Ruano Pascual in the first round.\nIt was originally scheduled to end on 8 July 2001, but the semifinal match between Ivanišević and Tim Henman was played on three separate days due to rain, and that was extended to 9 July, causing the women's singles and women's doubles championships moved to Day 13.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize money for 2001 championships was £8,525,280.

Badminton New Zealand did get more publicity, and there was sponsorship interest from condom companies. Following objections at a board meeting, the name was not adopted for formal use."

        "title": "Cumberland (rugby league team)",
        "text": "Cumberland, officially known as Central Cumberland, were a rugby league team in 1908 based in the region of Cumberland Plain in western Sydney. They were one of the nine original teams in the first New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) season, albeit admitted after the first round of matches had already been played. They are the shortest lived team in the history of first-grade rugby league in Australia after disbanding late that year. Statistically, they are the club with the poorest all-time record, only lasting eight games in their inaugural and only season.\nHistory.\nThe Cumberland area was dominated by rugby union as the main winter sport. The local Kings School took part in a regular competition of rugby union with other clubs Aallaroo, Calder House, Civil, Lyndhurst, Military, Newington, North Shore and Waratah. These teams in the area by 1900, were put under the banner of Western Suburbs Rugby Union.\nFormation.\nThe club was formed on the night of 21 April 1908 at Horse and Jockey Hotel, Homebush, the night after the first round of rugby league was being held in the NSWRL premiership. On that morning, Sydney newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\" advertised a meeting for that night to discuss the formation of rugby league club in the Cumberland area. The meeting was attended by annoyed members of the \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\" who were asked to form a rugby league club under the name \"Central Cumberland\". \nWhen the Western Suburbs formed their club, most of their players had come from \"Ashfield Rugby Union Club\", which was a second division team to the \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\". All but two of the first grade team of \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\" rejected offers from Western Suburbs. However, when Cumberland were looking for players, 23 of the 27 players present at the meeting signed with the club, most of which were rugby union players from the \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\".\nThe NSWRL were reluctant to admit a ninth team into the premiership and proposed they merge with nearby team Western Suburbs. However, the clubs involved declined so the NSWRL agreed to allowing the Cumberland team to a trial match against Eastern Suburbs. While Eastern Suburbs won the match 18–4, the NSWRL was convinced of that they could be competitive. As the NSWRL premiership had already begun, the NSWRL had to reformat the draw to include Cumberland, which meant increasing the number of teams from eight to nine. Cumberland did not have a home ground, like some of the other teams, and would play their games at the Agricultural Ground, Birchgrove Oval and Wentworth Park.\n1908 season.\nThe first match they played was against Souths on 9 May 1908 and despite the loss, the league praised the club over the 20,000 crowd that attended the game. Though the game, which Cumberland lost 23–2 was played as a curtain-raiser to an international match between Australia and New Zealand.\nBoth Cumberland and Western Suburbs had been winless to this point of the season and Cumberland had a score to settle with their rivals from \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\" who were with Western Suburbs rugby league club. Cumberland led 4–2 at half time, having two penalty goals kicked by Harry Bloomfield in the first half, however Western Suburbs goalkicker Jim Abercrombie kicked a penalty goal to equalise, after which George Cribb scored between the post and Bloomfield kicked the goal to make it 9–4. Abercrombie scored another penalty goal to make it 9–6, after which Bloomfield intercepted a pass, kicked the ball and regathered it to score which he also converted to win the match 14–6. Cumberland won its only game in the premiership season and ever.\nIn what turned out to be their final ever game, Cumberland were only able to field eleven out of the required thirteen players. The club ended up borrowing two players from the opposing team North Sydney to play for them, who were 'Paddy' Boland and Bert Odbert. They lost this game 45–0 and were awarded the wooden spoon for finishing on the bottom of the competition ladder.\nDemise.\nCumberland's dismal winning percentage and the inability to field a team led to their disbanding at the end of the season. After only playing eight first-grade matches and one trial match, Cumberland ceased to exist and passed into history. Seven of the Cumberland players moved to neighbours Western Suburbs, although only Harry Bloomfield, A. Halling and S. Jarvis played first-grade rugby league again.\nColours and crest.\nCumberland's neighbour club Western Suburbs had used black and white as their colours, which had been taken from Ashfield rugby club, a second grade rugby union team which supplied many of Western Suburbs players. Unlike other clubs, Western Suburbs did not take their colours from their district rugby union team, due to Ashfield's influence at the club. Cumberland thought of using the bottle green of the \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\"', as many of their team members were from there. However, the club believed that some would be unable to distinguish Western Suburbs and Cumberland if this approach was taken.\nThe club eventually chose the colours of the local Parramatta council, which were royal blue and gold, which were represented on their jersey in horizontal stripes, or hoops. The crest used these colours and was like many of the other crests of the 1908 season, a badge with a letter 'C', to represent the first letter of Cumberland. The badge was royal blue, while the letter gold. These colours were later used by the Parramatta Eels at their introduction in the NSWRL premiership in 1947, although there was no official affiliation between Cumberland and the later Parramatta team. The club's jersey was, like most other clubs, the colours in hoops around the jersey. These hoops of blue and gold were mixed with a white collar and black or grey shorts.\nPlayers.\nCumberland used twenty-four players in their eight matches:\nRepresentative players.\n\"Cumberland has no representative players\"\nRecords and statistics.\nIndividual records.\nHarry Bloomfield, statistically, is Cumberland's best player. Bloomfield, along with A. Halling, S. Jarvis, Thomas Lalor and F. O'Grady played all eight matches for Cumberland. Bloomfield played fullback and scored nineteen points for Cumberland which encompassed one try and eight goals throughout the season which was enough to warrant representation for New South Wales in an interstate match against Queensland. This included eleven points in one match, against Wests in their only win for the Season. E. Bellamy claims hold to most tries in a season, scoring two, one in the match against Glebe, the other against Eastern Suburbs.\nTeam honours.\nStatistically, Cumberland are the worst team in the history of first-grade rugby league in Australia. They only have won 12.5% of their games, lower than Annandale (18.3%), which is also a defunct team. They won the wooden spoon for being last on the table in the 1908 season. They had only one win which was 14–6 over Western Suburbs, and had their worst loss in their final game against Norths, 45–0. They lost six consecutive games from 9 May 1908 until 27 June 1908, a win, then a final loss. They scored an average 4.75 points each game whereas they had an average of 23.88 points scored against them."

        "title": "Annandale (rugby league team)",
        "text": "Annandale were an Australian rugby league football club which played in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership from 1910 to 1920. Based in Annandale, New South Wales and nicknamed \"The Dales\", the club's colours were red and gold.\nThe club was never able to finish higher than fifth in their eleven-year history and won just one match in their final three seasons. At the insistence of South Sydney this, combined with the industrialisation of the area led to their omission from the competition for further seasons at the end of 1920. All these events are often attributed to the fact that fewer players were eligible to play under the residency rules in place at the time (Glebe would also later fall victim, in part, to this phenomenon).\nHistory.\nAnnandale were initially a second grade feeder club for Glebe in the Metropolitan Rugby Union competition. Glebe would later join the NSWRL competition along with the Newtown, Balmain and South Sydney clubs. The Metropolitan Rugby Union board later expelled and banned the Annandale players who competed in the exhibition game which gave way to Annandale switching from rugby union to rugby league.\nAnnandale began their first season with a very poor start, losing their first four games straight which as it turned out sent them immediately out of the race for the premiership. They did, however, recover well and finished with five wins, one draw and eight losses. The first of these wins came in round 5 against a Western Suburbs side that had won just 3 out of 23 matches in their three-year history. At the end of the season, Annandale finished sixth out of the eight teams.\nThe 1911 season was arguably Annandale's most successful, managing to win five of their fourteen games, equalling their performance in the previous year. However, they were able to finish one place higher on the ladder, in fifth position.\nIn 1912 the club were able to claim an 8–5 win against Balmain in the second round of the season but followed this up with eleven losses in a row. In equal last position with Western Suburbs heading into the final round of the season, the two clubs by coincidence were scheduled to play their final match of the season against one another. Despite having lost to Western Suburbs in round seven, Annandale won the match 15–6, avoiding them claiming the wooden spoon.\nAs it turned out, the scenario for Annandale in the final rounds of the 1913 season were similar to those they experienced in 1912. They were again in equal last position with Western Suburbs with two rounds to play and up against one another in a match which would most likely decide who would finish last. Replicating their win from the previous season, Annandale took out the match 18–0. Although they lost their last match of the season narrowly to second-placed Newtown 10–8 whilst Western Suburbs won their own match, Annandale are deemed to have avoided the last place due to a superior points scoring difference despite finishing on equal competition points.\nThe club claimed just one draw from their first eleven games of the 1914 season, leaving them in last position and three points behind Western Suburbs. The two teams travelled to Goulburn, with Annandale needing to win to avoid receiving their first wooden spoon. In this match, however, Western Suburbs won 6–4, ensuring Annandale were to finish last. Although claiming an elusive win, their only one of the season, against three-time defending premiers Eastern Suburbs in the second last round of the season, their effort was futile as they took out their first wooden spoon.\nIn 1915 the club got three wins, including another one against Western Suburbs in the final match of the season, to finish two points clear of last-placed North Sydney and Western Suburbs. In 1916 they began the season poorly, winning just one of their first ten games and leaving them two points behind Western Suburbs in last position. They were then able to win three games in a row and ended up finishing seventh. The 1917 season was more of the same for the club, losing their first nine matches before claiming two draws in the next three weeks. In a match against equal last North Sydney in the second last round of the season, Annandale prevailed in a close match 3–2 meaning they were again able to narrowly avoid the wooden spoon.\nAnnandale were unable to win a game in 1918, scoring ten points or more just twice whilst conceding ten points or less on just two occasions. They won just one match in 1919, an important second-last round match against North Sydney which was to again decide who would finish in last position. This victory allowed them to finish seventh despite having won just the one match. In 1920 they once again failed to win a match and lost by less than 9 points on only one occasion.\nStatistics and records.\nOut of the 33 clubs that have contested in the premiership over the years, Annandale's performance is ranked as the second worst of all. Out of 153 games played, the club won 25, drew six and lost 122 for a winning percentage of 18.3%. As of 2016, only on seven occasions has a team failed to win a game in a season. Annandale achieved this twice, in 1918 and 1920.\nClub records.\nBiggest Win\nBiggest Loss\nMost Consecutive Wins\nMost Consecutive Losses\nRecord appearance holder\nRecord point scorer\nWooden Spoons"

        "title": "Goaltending (basketball)",
        "text": "Goaltending is a violation of the rules in the sport of basketball. It consists of certain forms of player interference with the ball while it is on its way to the basket. It is goaltending if a player touches the ball when it is (a) in downward flight; or (b) above the basket rim and within an imaginary cylinder projecting above the rim; or (c) already touching the rim; or (varying at certain levels of the sport) after it has touched the backboard and has a chance of going in the hoop. \nGoaltending in this context defines by exclusion what is considered a legal block of a field goal. In high school and NCAA basketball, goaltending is also called when a player interferes with a free throw at any time in its flight towards the basket.\nEffect.\nIf goaltending is called for interference with a field goal, the shooting team is awarded the points for the field goal as if it had been made. The team that commits the violation then inbounds the ball at its baseline, the same as if it had conceded a basket. In high school and NCAA basketball, if goaltending is called on a free throw, the shooting team is awarded one point, and a technical foul is called against the offending player. \nGoaltending is commonly confused with the related violation of basket interference (also called offensive goaltending) which occurs during an attempted field goal when a player touches the basket, the rim, or the ball when it is on the rim . Like goaltending, basket interference when committed by the defending team results in an award of points to the shooting team as if the attempted field goal had been made.\nFIBA rules allow a defender to block any shot that is over the rim and the ball is on its upward flight.\nThe prohibition against goaltending was adopted by the NCAA in 1944 (and later by the NBL) specifically because of George Mikan. Prior to the advent of the high-jumping 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) Mikan, goaltending was not addressed because it was thought physically impossible."

        "title": "Golden Tee Golf",
        "text": "Golden Tee Golf is a golf arcade game series by Incredible Technologies. Its signature feature is the use of a trackball to determine the power, direction and curve of the player's golf shot. Play modes include casual 18-hole golf, closest to the pin, and online tournaments. One of the longest running arcade game series, \"Golden Tee\" has maintained a large following and spawned a competitive tournament scene.\nHistory.\nThe \"Golden Tee\" series began as a project at Incredible Technologies to create a large scale golf simulator for sizable family entertainment centers. The idea was scrapped, but not before programmer Larry Hodgson had already written software to create virtual golf courses. Rather than discard his work, Hodgson retooled the concept to develop a golf game for regular arcade cabinets. He worked with co-designer Jim Zielinski, who initially rendered the courses using Deluxe Paint. Instead of a regular joystick and buttons for controls, they used a trackball, which Incredible Technologies had previously used for \"Capcom Bowling\".\nThe first \"Golden Tee\" was play-tested in a bar, a venue which would become the most popular location for \"Golden Tee\" cabinets. Released in 1989, the first iteration was sold exclusively as a kit that could be used to convert existing arcade machines to \"Golden Tee.\" It sold relatively well, but the series would find greater success with \"Golden Tee 3D\" several years later. The 1995 \"Peter Jacobson's Golden Tee 3D Golf\" (featuring Peter Jacobsen) was the first in the series to support online networked play. Rather than being networked to each other, the cabinets were all linked to a central computer which compared scores for tournament play. The first test tournament, held on 24 game cabinets in the Chicago area from November 24 to December 17, 1995, awarded real money to the winners, including a $1,000 grand prize. The first \"real world\" tournament was held mid-June to July 7, 1996, on 145 cabinets across six states, and was considered a major success. By the end of 1996, 1,250 cabinets were installed across 32 states. The tournament gave rise to a large competitive play scene for the franchise. Ryan Bourgeois has won the US national championship three times.\nSince \"Golden Tee 3D\", Incredible Technologies has released a new entry in the series to arcades every year. Versions of the game have also been published for the original PlayStation, Microsoft Windows, iOS and Android. A plug-n-play dedicated console version has also been released. On May 16, 2022, \"Golden Tee PGA Tour 2022\" was released. Later that year on October 24, \"Home Edition\" was released."

        "title": "Climbing galaxias",
        "text": "The climbing galaxias or kōaro (\"Galaxias brevipinnis\") is a fish of the family Galaxiidae found in Australia, New Zealand, and nearby islands. The name climbing galaxias is used in Australia, and koaro or kōaro in New Zealand. Further vernacular names include short-finned galaxias, broad-finned galaxias, Cox's mountain galaxias, and Pieman galaxias.\nAppearance.\nThe climbing galaxias is unlikely to be confused with the other diadromous whitebait species because of its shape. It is elongated and slender, shaped almost like a tube. The sides and back are covered in a variable pattern of golden blotches and bands that gleam and glitter in the sun, making the climbing galaxias an attractive fish.\nTheir maximum size is around 29 cm, but they commonly reach 16–18 cm.\nLifestyle.\nThese fish live a basically benthic lifestyle and in most respects behave like the common galaxias, a closely related galaxiid. They inhabit mainly clear streams, often deeply shaded and relatively fast-flowing, although they sometimes occur in lakes, particularly in Tasmania. Climbing galaxias also have the ability to penetrate well inland in many river systems, thus have a more widespread distribution than the other whitebait species.\nA major distinguishing feature of this species is its ability to climb up very steep surfaces such as waterfalls, wet rocks, and the sluices of dams using its broad and downward facing pectoral and pelvic fins. Even juveniles of the species are capable of climbing up and over the sides of buckets after being trapped in whitebait nets.\nClimbing ability is not unique among galaxias species, but it reaches its greatest expression in the climbing galaxias, which have special features that enhance their climbing abilities. The downward orientation of their fins and the strong, backward-facing ridges on the front part of their fins possibly contribute to this ability.\nClimbing galaxias once formed large populations in some lakes. It once roamed New Zealand's Lake Taupō in huge shoals and was caught in huge numbers by Maori people using specialised nets. Introduced rainbow trout has now virtually eradicated the species from Lake Taupō. Similarly, the introduction of brown trout eradicated a climbing galaxias population from Lake Tali Karng in Victoria, Australia (Cadwallader, 1996).\nLifecycle.\n\"G. brevipinnis\" eggs are believed to be washed downstream to the sea, where the young live for about six months before returning to fresh water as part of the large, mixed-species schools known as whitebait. They were once part of a commercial whitebait fishery in Tasmania, but now fishing for them has been restricted to recreational anglers with significant restrictions on allowable tackle and methods. Land-locked populations have a similar lifestyle except the young spend the first part of their lives in inland lakes and backwaters.\nDiet.\nThese fish are generalised carnivores of invertebrates, including aquatic and terrestrial insects, mayfly and caddisfly larvae, and amphipods.\nDistribution.\nTheir distribution extends to coastal streams in southeastern Australia from Adelaide and Kangaroo Island in South Australia, through coastal Victoria including Wilsons Promontory, Tasmania, Flinders and King Islands, and north along the New South Wales coast to around Sydney, as well as New Zealand including the Chatham, Auckland and Campbell Islands.\nTheir climbing ability enables them to inhabit headwaters of streams that introduced species, such as trout, cannot reach."

        "text": "In cricket, a bowling analysis (sometimes shortened to just analysis, especially in the phrase innings analysis, and also referred to as bowling figures) usually refers to a notation summarising a bowler's performance in terms of overs bowled, how many of those overs are maidens (i.e. with no runs conceded), total runs conceded and number of wickets taken. Bowling analyses are generally given for each innings in cricket scoreboards printed in \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", newspapers and so on, but they are also sometimes quoted for other periods of time, such as a single spell of bowling. Typically, the analysis is given in the following format: Overs – Maidens – Runs conceded – Wickets. \nIn some cases, overs and maidens are omitted from bowling figures, and are recorded showing 'Wickets/Runs'; for example, 7/15 by Glenn McGrath against Namibia shows he took his 7 wickets for 15 runs.\nSometimes, in limited overs cricket, the 'maidens' figure is replaced by the number of dot balls bowled.\nIn Test cricket, the best bowling analysis for a single innings is 10/53 by Jim Laker. The best bowling analysis in an ODI is 8/19 by Chaminda Vaas. The best bowling analysis in a Twenty20 International is 6/7 by Deepak Chahar. In first-class cricket, the best bowling analysis for a single innings is 10/10 by Hedley Verity."

        "title": "Grand Prix tennis circuit",
        "text": "The ITF Grand Prix Circuit was a professional tennis tour for male players that existed founded in 1970 as the ILTF Grand Prix Tennis Circuit it ran annually until 1989 when it and WCT Circuit were replaced by a single world wide ATP Tour.\nBackground.\nBefore the Open Era, popular professional tennis players, such as Suzanne Lenglen and Vincent Richards, were contracted to professional promoters. Amateur players were under the jurisdiction of their national (and international) federations. Later professional promoters, such as Bill Tilden and Jack Kramer, often convinced leading amateurs like Pancho Gonzales and Rod Laver to join their tours with promises of good prize money. But these successes led to financial difficulties when players were paid too much and falling attendances resulted in reduced takings.\nIn the early 1960s, the professional tour began to fall apart. It survived only because the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, having been unable to give prize money to its 1963 winner, received prize money from the First National Bank of Boston for its 1964 tournament. At the same time, the concept of \"shamateurism\" – amateur promoters paying players under the table to ensure they remained amateurs – had become apparent to Herman David, the chairman of the Wimbledon Championships.\nIn 1967, David announced that a professional tournament would be held at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club after the 1967 Wimbledon Championships. This tournament was televised by the BBC and built public support for professional tennis. In late 1967, the best of the amateur players turned professional, paving the way for the first open tournament. Some professionals were independent at this time, such as Lew Hoad, Luis Ayala, and Owen Davidson, but most of the best players came under contract to one of two professional tours:\nWhen the Open Era began in 1968, tournaments often found themselves deprived of NTL or WCT players. The first open tournament, the British Hard Court Championships at Bournemouth, was played without WCT players, as was that year's French Open. In 1970, NTL players did not play in the Australian Open because their organization did not receive a guarantee.\nFormation of the Grand Prix.\nThe manipulation of Grand Slam tournaments by professional promoters at the start of the Open Era led promoter Jack Kramer, the top male tennis player in the world in the 1940s and 1950s, to conceive of the Grand Prix in 1969. He described it as \"a series of tournaments with a money bonus pool that would be split up on the basis of a cumulative point system.\" This would encourage the best players to compete regularly in the series, so that they could share in the bonus at the end and qualify for the special championship tournament climaxing the year.\nWhen only a few contract players showed up for the 1970 French Open, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) approved Kramer's Grand Prix proposal. In April 1970, its president Ben Barnett announced the creation of the Grand Prix circuit, on an experimental basis during its first year.\nThe first World Championship Tennis tournament was held 20 January 1968 in Sydney, Australia. The first NTL tournament was held 18-21 March 1968 in São Paulo, Brazil. In July 1970, the WCT absorbed the NTL. In 1971, WCT ran a twenty-tournament circuit with the year-ending WCT Finals held in November. At the end of 1970, a panel of journalists had ranked the best players in the world. The best thirty-two men based on this ranking were invited to play the 1971 WCT circuit, which included Ilie Năstase, Stan Smith, Jan Kodeš, Željko Franulović, and Clark Graebner.\nThe Australian Open was part of the WCT circuit while the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open were Grand Prix events. The conflict between the ILTF (running the Grand Prix) and WCT was so strong that Rosewall, Gimeno, Laver, Emerson, and other WCT players boycotted the 1971 US Open. The third professional circuit that year was the U. S. Indoor Circuit run by Bill Riordan, the future manager of Jimmy Connors.\nIn July 1971, the ILTF voted to ban all WCT contract professionals from competing in ILTF tournaments and from using ILTF facilities from the beginning of 1972 onwards. The 1972 editions of the French Open and the Wimbledon Championships excluded all contract professional players. Then in April 1972, the ILTF and WCT agreed to divide the 1973 tour into a WCT circuit that ran from January through May and a Grand Prix circuit that ran for the rest of the year. The conflict between the ILTF and WCT led all tennis players to attend the 1972 US Open where they agreed to form their own syndicate, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), through the efforts of Jack Kramer, Donald Dell, and Cliff Drysdale.\nIn 1973, there were four rival professional circuits: the WCT circuit battled with the U. S. Indoor Circuit from January to April and the Grand Prix until July; both tours competed with the \"European Spring Circuit\" until June.\nIn that same year, the ATP created controversy by calling for a boycott of the 1973 Wimbledon Championships after one of its members, Niki Pilić, was suspended by the Yugoslav Tennis Federation for failing to play in a Davis Cup tie against New Zealand. The ATP boycott went ahead after negotiations failed, with only three members of the organisation – Roger Taylor, Ilie Năstase, and Ray Keldie – breaking the picket. They were later fined for this. The men's draws for that year were subsequently made up of second-string players, lucky losers, and older players such as Neale Fraser, who reached the final of the men's doubles with fellow Australian John Cooper. The draw also showcased future talents such as Björn Borg, Vijay Amritraj, Sandy Mayer, and John Lloyd amid record crowds.\nGovernance.\nThe governance of the Grand Prix was led by the Men's International Professional Tennis Council (MIPTC) from 1974 through 1989. (Its name was shortened to the Men's Tennis Council (MTC) in 1988.) The MIPTC's duties included imposing fines for violations of its Code of Conduct, drug testing, and administrating the Grand Prix circuit. It also moved the Australian Open from its December date – which had been adopted in 1977 so that it could be included in the Grand Prix points system – to January for the 1987 edition so that the Grand Prix Masters could be held in December from 1986 onwards. It failed, however, to prevent the number of tournaments on the Grand Prix circuit from growing, with 48 being held in 1974 compared to 75 in 1989.\nIntegration and the end.\nThe WCT and Grand Prix circuits were separate until 1978, when the Grand Prix circuit integrated the WCT circuit. In 1982, the WCT circuit split from the Grand Prix again and created a more complex WCT ranking, similar to the ATP ranking. The split was short-lived, however, and in 1985 the Grand Prix absorbed the four remaining WCT tournaments.\nDuring the 1988 US Open the ATP, led by then-World No. 1 Mats Wilander, staged an impromptu meeting known as the \"Parking Lot Press Conference\" during failed negotiations with the MTC over the organisation of the Grand Prix and key issues such as player fatigue. During this press conference, the ATP declared that it would be starting its own tour in 1990, meaning that the 1989 Grand Prix would effectively be its last. The final event of the Grand Prix was the Nabisco Masters Doubles held at the Royal Albert Hall 6-10 December 1989. Its last champions were Jim Grabb and Patrick McEnroe, who beat John Fitzgerald and Anders Järryd in the final.\nFormation of the ATP Tour.\nIn 1990, the Association of Tennis Professionals, led by Hamilton Jordan, replaced the MTC as the sole governing body of men's professional tennis and the ATP Tour was born. The nine most prestigious Grand Prix tournaments became known as the \"Championship Series Single Week\" from 1990 through 1995. In 1996, Mercedes began sponsoring these series of events, renamed as the \"Super 9\" until 1999. In 2000, they became known as the \"Tennis Masters Series\" until 2004, then the \"ATP Masters Series\" until 2009. They are now called the ATP Masters 1000 tournaments. Grand Prix tournaments below this level were originally called the Grand Prix Super Series. They were retained by the ATP and renamed as the \"Championship Series\". All remaining Grand Prix Tour events became part of the \"World Series\".\nGrand Prix tours and sponsors.\nBased on USLTA Tennis Yearbooks and Guides and World of Tennis yearbooks the history of sponsors is as follows:\nGrand Prix season-end rankings.\n\"NB: All rankings were calculated using the Grand Prix points system and do not necessarily reflect the ATP rankings at the same time.\"\n 1970\n 1971\n 1972\n 1973\n 1974\n 1975\n 1976\n 1977\n 1978\n 1979\n 1980\n 1981\n 1982\n 1983\n 1984\n 1985\n 1986\n 1987\n 1988\n 1989"

        "title": "Andy Phillips (baseball)",
        "text": "George Andrew Phillips (born April 6, 1977) is an American baseball coach and former infielder. He played college baseball at Alabama for coach Jim Wells from 1996 to 1999 and played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, New York Mets, and Cincinnati Reds. Phillips was raised in Demopolis, Alabama, where he played baseball for the Demopolis Academy Generals. Phillips was an All-American for the Tide.\nPlaying career.\nNew York Yankees.\nPhillips was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers as a shortstop in the 41st round of the draft as a high school senior and again by the New York Yankees in the 7th round of the 1999 draft as a college graduate of the University of Alabama. He signed with the Yankees, but did not reach the Major Leagues until a call-up session towards the end of the 2004 season; he made his Major League debut on September 14, 2004. In his first Major League AB, he hit a home run over the Green Monster in Fenway Park off Terry Adams of the Boston Red Sox. He became the 21st player in Major League history to hit a home run on the first pitch of his Major League career.\nAlso, in 2004, Phillips received the Yankees' Kevin Long \"Minor-League Player of the Year\" Award in a season where he led all Yankees minor leaguers in batting average (.321) and RBI (101), ranked second in home runs (30), and was voted the Most Valuable Player of the International League All Star Game after hitting a 10th inning walk-off home run. In , Phillips earned the James P. Dawson Award as the Yankees' most outstanding rookie during spring training.\nPhillips's time previous to at the Major League level had been limited to defensive replacement and late season call-up. In 2006, Phillips started the year as the primary backup at first base, behind Jason Giambi. This changed, however, when Gary Sheffield went on the disabled list. Primary designated hitter Bernie Williams took over the starting right field job, leaving the DH spot open. With Giambi's bad knees and his sub-par defense in the field, he became the primary DH. Phillips took over at first base and played well. This proved manager Joe Torre correct when he said all that Phillips needed was more at bats. He led the team with a .333 batting average in June and continued with his .333 average for the first 22 games of July. His average on July 26 was .300, with 30 hits in 100 at bats. Earlier, his light hitting triggered GM Brian Cashman to go out and trade for Craig Wilson of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Phillips was kept on the roster mostly because of his versatility to play second base or third base. Also, he could play first if Wilson was forced to play the outfield or catch.\nA family emergency (his mother Linda was hurt in a car crash) caused Phillips to miss much of his 2007 spring training with the Yankees. In the end, he only played in 15 games, saw 26 at bats, and had a .192 average. Due to his inability to make up for lost time and Josh Phelps's (Phillips opponent for a roster spot on the Yankees) outstanding performance (spring training stats include 3 home runs, 14 hits, a .667 slugging percentage, and .389 batting average), Phillips was passed over for a roster spot on the 2007 team. When informed of manager Joe Torre's decision to go with Phelps over Phillips, Phillips reportedly thanked Torre for the opportunity and asked if Phelps had been informed of the decision yet so he could congratulate him.\nPhillips was called up to the Yankees on June 19, 2007, after Phelps was designated for assignment. Throughout the 2007 season, Phillips became an important part of the team as a result of injuries to first baseman Jason Giambi and Doug Mientkiewicz. Due to these injuries, Phillips found himself used in the role of primary first baseman for the Yankees. He enjoyed great success through the months of July (hitting .320 with 16 RBI) and August (hitting .273 with 7 RBI). On September 2, while batting in the 5th inning against Devil Rays starter Jason Hammel, Phillips was hit on the wrist by a pitch. He would later leave the game and get an MRI and an X-Ray taken. It was announced on September 3 that Phillips had a fractured wrist and surgery would be required, needing 4–6 weeks, ending his season. Phillips was designated for assignment on December 3, 2007, to make room for Jose Molina. He cleared waivers on December 7, was offered an outright assignment to Triple-A Scranton, but declined the assignment and opted to become a free agent. In 2013, Andy appeared in the Old Timers Day game at Yankee Stadium.\nCincinnati Reds.\nOn January 4, 2008, Phillips signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. On March 28, after hitting .277 in 2008 spring training, he was reassigned to minor-league camp, and he began the season with the Reds' Triple-A affiliate, the Louisville Bats. On May 28, the Reds purchased his contract, and he was added to the active roster. On June 22, 2008, Phillips was designated for assignment to make room for Jeff Keppinger, who was coming off of the disabled list. Three days later, Phillips was claimed by the New York Mets and added to their 25-man roster. He was then designated for assignment by the Mets on July 1, 2008. He was reclaimed by the Cincinnati Reds off waivers on July 3.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn December 22, 2008, he signed to a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates, and was invited to Spring Training as a \"non-roster invitee\", the same status in which he was invited to Spring Training with the Reds in 2008. He played so well early in spring training that he was considered a lock to make the opening day roster, but a back injury sidelined him for three weeks, and he ended up assigned to Indianapolis instead.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn April 17, 2009, Phillips was traded to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for pitcher Michael Dubee, and assigned to the Charlotte Knights of the International League. He filed for free agency on June 15, 2009.\nNippon Professional Baseball.\nOn June 23, 2009, Phillips signed with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of Nippon Professional Baseball. Following the 2009 season, the Carp did not pick up Phillips' option for the 2010 season and he signed with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in January 2010.\nCoaching career.\nAlabama.\nOn December 22, 2010, Phillips was introduced as the Alabama Crimson Tide baseball team's hitting coach beginning in 2011."

        "title": "Pat Sullivan (American football)",
        "text": "Patrick Joseph Sullivan (January 18, 1950 – December 1, 2019) was an American professional football player and college coach. An All-America quarterback for the Auburn Tigers, he won the Heisman Trophy in 1971 and then played six seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Atlanta Falcons and Washington Redskins. Sullivan was a head football coach at Samford University, a position he held from 2007 to 2014. He was previously the head football coach at Texas Christian University (TCU) from 1992 to 1997 and the offensive coordinator at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) from 1999 to 2006. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1991.\nCollege career.\nBorn in Birmingham, Alabama, Sullivan began his athletic career as a three-sport star at Birmingham's John Carroll Catholic High School. Although a talented baseball and basketball player, he chose to play football for Auburn University where he would become the starting quarterback in 1969 under the tutelage of head coach Ralph Jordan. Over the next three seasons, the tall and Sullivan would break school and NCAA records for passing while leading the team to a 26–7 record. In 1970, he led the NCAA in total offense with 2,856 yards and set an NCAA record for most yards per play with 8.57. In his career, he was responsible for 72 touchdowns (54 passing/18 rushing) to tie the NCAA record. In his senior season, Sullivan completed 162 passes on 281 attempts for 2,012 yards and 20 touchdowns. This performance was enough to edge out Ed Marinaro for the 1971 Heisman Trophy. Also an excellent student, Sullivan was named an Academic All-American and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business administration in 1972. Sullivan finished his college career with 6,284 passing yards and 54 touchdowns, along with another 18 touchdowns on the ground. He was selected to play in the Senior Bowl, where he led the South to victory over the North and was given the game's Most Valuable Player award.\nProfessional career.\nAfter college, Sullivan had a six-season professional NFL football career. He was a second-round selection (40th overall pick) of the 1972 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. Sullivan played with the Falcons from 1972 to 1975. He played in 30 games. In 1974, Sullivan started three games for the Atlanta Falcons, losing all three. He completed 48 of 105 passes and one touchdown. In 1975, he threw for 3 touchdowns, completing 28 of 70 passes. He signed with the Washington Redskins as a free agent in 1976 but was cut before the start of the season. He signed with the Chicago Bears in March 1977 but was sold to the San Francisco 49ers in June, and then cut by the 49ers before the start of the 1977 season. Sullivan left football to enter private business in Birmingham, where he worked in insurance and as a tire company executive.\nCoaching career.\nSullivan spent five seasons doing radio color commentary for Auburn football games before joining the staff at Auburn in 1986 as quarterbacks coach under head coach Pat Dye. He worked with Auburn quarterbacks Jeff Burger, Reggie Slack, and Stan White during his six years at Auburn. During his time as an assistant Auburn won, or shared, three Southeastern Conference championships and had a four-game winning streak against archrival Alabama.\nOn January 2, 1992, Sullivan became the 27th head football coach of Texas Christian University. He inherited a team still reeling from probation imposed by the NCAA in 1986. Most seriously, the Frogs had been limited to 25 scholarships in 1987 and 1988. By the time Sullivan arrived in Fort Worth, the sanctions had taken their full effect; TCU would not have a full complement of scholarships until 1993.\nAfter two losing seasons, he led TCU to a 7–5 mark in 1994 to win a share of the Southwest Conference championship, the school's first SWC title since 1959. Following the 1994 season, prior to the Horned Frogs' appearance in the Independence Bowl versus Virginia, Sullivan agreed to become the head coach at Louisiana State University (LSU). However, LSU refused to pay the $400,000 buyout of Sullivan's TCU contract, and the Tigers hired Vanderbilt University coach Gerry DiNardo three days later.\nThe next season produced another winning record of 6–5 before TCU joined the Western Athletic Conference in 1996 and fell once again on hard times. Losing seasons in 1996 and 1997 resulted in Sullivan's resignation in October 1997 with an overall record of 24–42–1. However, he is best known for having recruited LaDainian Tomlinson to play at TCU.\nIn January 1999, Sullivan became the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach of UAB. He helped develop Darrell Hackney into the best quarterback in UAB history who was able to make it to the NFL as an undrafted free agent picked up by the Cleveland Browns. UAB's offense also featured wide receiver Roddy White, who later played for the Atlanta Falcons.\nAfter neck surgery in September 2003, Sullivan was diagnosed with throat cancer by Dr. William R. Carroll (squamous cell carcinoma) and began chemotherapy and radiation treatments in December. In April 2004, doctors told him he was clear of cancer, but he continued to be monitored for recurrence. Sullivan missed only one game coaching in the 2003 season due to treatment, but lost around 50 pounds over the course of his cancer treatment.\nOn December 1, 2006, Sullivan was named head coach at Samford University, replacing Bill Gray. In 2008, the Bulldogs joined the Southern Conference and won the championship in 2013. He resigned after the 2014 season, his eighth season as coach.\nPersonal life.\nSullivan was married to the former Jean Hicks of Birmingham and they had three children – Kim, and twins Kelly and Patrick, Jr.\nDeath.\nPat Sullivan died on December 1, 2019, after a long battle with cancer. On January 1, 2020, Auburn players wore \"7\" decals on the left side of their helmets during the Outback Bowl to commemorate Sullivan. \nSullivan is one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is caused by repeated hits to the head.\nHonors and awards.\nSullivan was selected to the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, class of 1981. In 1988, he was also a charter member of the Senior Bowl Hall of Fame. The football field house at Samford University was renamed in his honor. In 2016, Sullivan's High School Alma Mater renamed the John Carroll High School Football Field in honor of Pat Sullivan. "

        "text": "Mark Walsh (born 2 February 1965) is a former English professional darts player who competed in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) tournaments. He reached No. 6 in the PDC Order of Merit.\nWalsh reached his first major televised final in 2005, when he was beaten by Phil Taylor in the UK Open.\nEarly career.\nWalsh made his televised debut at the 2002 World Matchplay but suffered a 10-0 whitewash at the hands of John Part.\nHis World Championship debut came in 2004, but he lost 0-3 to Erik Clarys in his first match. He went out to Wayne Mardle 2-4 in 2005. He won his first match at the World Championship at his third attempt in 2006. He was seeded 12th for the event, and beat Warren Parry before losing 0-4 to Dennis Smith in the next round.\nLater career.\n2007-2010.\nHe had slipped to 16th in the world rankings for the 2007 World Championship, when he was surprisingly beaten by 19-year-old Dutch player Rico Vonck, thus continuing his poor run at the tournament. He started the year ranked 15th in the world, but had fallen to 32 by November, which put him in danger of failing to qualify for the 2008 World Championship. However, he reached the semi-final of the Ireland Open Classic in September, and won the non-ranked Gleneagle Irish Masters in early November, thus hinting at an upturn in form. He also reached the semi-finals of the PDC German Darts Championship.\nIn the 2008 PDC World Darts Championship, Walsh defeated Adrian Gray in the first round, setting up a second-round match with Taylor. Walsh led Taylor 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 before Taylor won six consecutive legs to beat him 4-3. Despite losing, Walsh stated that from suffering dartitis to pushing the greatest player in the world to the final set at the World Championship was a great victory in its own right.\nWalsh continued his good form, reaching three quarter finals including the Open Holland Masters and then reached the last 32 stage of the US Open and the UK Open. He followed up with a semi final showing in the PDPA Players Championship Las Vegas and then qualified for the 2008 Las Vegas Desert Classic the next day. He beat Bill Davis in the first round before losing to James Wade. He then reached the second round of the 2008 World Matchplay, defeating Colin Lloyd in the opening match of the tournament but lost to Kevin McDine. He reached the second round of the World Grand Prix, beating Steve Beaton in the first round before losing to Terry Jenkins. Walsh missed out on qualifying for the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts but bounced back to reach the semi-finals of the inaugural Championship League Darts, winning group eight and then placing second in the winners group, eventually losing to Mervyn King. He then reached the quarter-finals of the 2008 European Darts Championship and reached the final of the PDPA Players Championship Holland 2, losing to Wade.\nWalsh defeated Jamie Caven 3-2 in the first round of the 2009 PDC World Championship, narrowly missing out on a nine dart finish on the way. In the second round he lost 4-2 to King. On 17 January, Walsh hit a nine-dart finish in the Eddie Cox Memorial Players Championship in Gibraltar against Caven to win the deciding leg of their first round match. Having rolled over for four Players Championships, Walsh won £1,600 for the nine-darter.\nWalsh won his first PDC title in two years, when he won the Coventry Players Championship on 28 March 2009 beating Taylor 6-4 in the final. He added another title with his second career UK Open Regional in Derby, by winning the East Midlands region 6-5 over Raymond van Barneveld.\n2010 – present.\nWalsh was 12th seed for the 2010 World Championship, however he didn't get past the first round after losing 3-2 to former World Champion Mark Webster.\nWalsh qualified for the 2011 Grand Slam of Darts as the highest ranked player from the PDC Order of Merit not already invited. He progressed through Group A with victories over Tony O'Shea and Michael van Gerwen but finished second after losing to Scott Waites. He then defeated Group B winner Dean Winstanley 10-9 and former World Champion Ted Hankey 16-14 before losing out 11-16 to Gary Anderson.\nAt the 2012 World Championship he came from a set down to defeat Warren French, 3–1 in the first round. Walsh played Kevin Painter in the Last 32 and came back from 1–3 to level the match at 3–3. He couldn't keep his momentum going, however, as he lost the deciding set by 3 legs to 0 to exit the tournament 3–4. At the World Matchplay, Walsh beat Colin Osborne 10–8 in the first round, before being comprehensively beaten 4–13 by James Wade in the last 16. Despite winning the first set in his first round match against Robert Thornton at the World Grand Prix, he only took one more leg and lost 1–2. Walsh qualified from Group 8 of the Championship League with a 6–5 victory against Steve Beaton. However, he finished bottom of the eight man Winners Group, winning just one of his seven matches. Walsh was whitewashed 0–5 in his opening Group H game of the Grand Slam of Darts, but came back to defeat both Wayne Jones and Christian Kist 5–4. However, his heavy defeat and narrow wins meant that he failed to qualify for the knockout stage on leg difference. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Walsh was 23rd on the Order of Merit, inside the top 32 who qualified for the Players Championship Finals. He was beaten 1–6 by Thornton in the first round.\nWalsh reached the last 16 of the 2013 World Championship with wins over Darren Webster and Justin Pipe, but then lost to Wes Newton 1–4, having missed three darts to only trail 2–3. He lost 4–5 to Lee Palfreyman in the second round of the UK Open. He failed to qualify for the World Matchplay for the first time in his career and the World Grand Prix for the first time since 2007 due to falling out of the top 16 on the Order of Merit and not winning enough games through the PDC Pro Tour.\nIn October, Walsh reached the quarter-finals of a Pro Tour event for the first time in a year at the 11th Players Championship as he beat the likes of Andy Hamilton and Newton, before his run was ended with a 6–4 defeat against Robert Thornton. He lost 5–0 to Robert Thornton and 5–1 to Andy Hamilton at the Grand Slam of Darts, before a consolation 5–2 victory over Justin Pipe but Walsh was already resigned to finishing bottom of the group.\nAt the 2014 World Championship Walsh missed five darts to extend his first round match against Jarkko Komula into a final set as he lost 3–1. He dropped to world number 31 after the event concluded and was defeated 9–5 by Mark Webster in the third round of the UK Open. Walsh failed to advance beyond the last 32 of any event after this. He fell to world number 41 ahead of the 2015 World Championship, outside of the top 32 who automatically qualify and could not claim a place via any other route to break a streak of 11 consecutive appearances in the event. 2015 also marked the first UK Open not to feature Walsh (he had played in each one since its inception in 2003) after he failed to win enough matches to qualify. He did qualify for four European Tour events with two first round and two second round exits adding a total of £5,000 to his ranking.\nWalsh was 65th on the Order of Merit after the 2016 World Championship, just outside the top 64 who remain on tour and so entered Q School. Despite losing in the final round to Vincent Kamphuis on the last day, Walsh had done more than enough to win his place back right away as he topped the Q School Order of Merit. At the 10th Players Championship in July, Walsh reached his first quarter-final in over two years, but lost 6–1 to Andrew Gilding. This helped him qualify for the Finals and, in what was his PDC major event since February 2014, he was edged out 6–5 by Josh Payne in the opening round.\nSuccesses.\nHe has won six non-televised PDC titles: the Welsh Regional final of the UK Open in September 2005, the Gleneagle Irish Masters in November 2007, the Coventry Players Championship and the UK Open East Midlands Regional plus two more Players Championships in Barnsley beating Jamie Caven and in Germany beating Andy Hamilton 6–5.\n2020.\nAs of the 18th January he has not participated in any darts event."

        "title": "Point (tennis)",
        "text": "A point in tennis is the smallest subdivision of the match. A point can consist of a double fault by the server, in which case the point is automatically won by the receiver. In all other cases, a point begins when a legal serve is hit by the server to the receiver on the opposite side of the court, and continues until one side fails to legally return the ball to the opposite side. Whichever side fails to do so loses the point and their opponent wins it. \nIn the advantage scoring system, the first side to win four points by a two-point margin wins the game. To start a game, both sides begin at \"love\" (zero points). The first point won by a side is called \"15,\" the second point is \"30,\" and the third point is \"40.\" If both sides have won three points in a game (i.e., 40-40), the score is called \"deuce.\" From deuce, whichever side wins the following point is said to have \"advantage\" and can win the game by winning the next point (two-point margin). If the side with advantage loses the next point, the score returns to deuce, and play continues until one side wins two consecutive points from deuce, thereby winning the game. \nAlternatively, if no-advantage (no-ad) scoring is used, then the first side to win four points wins the game, without the requirement of a two-point margin. No-ad scoring means any one game will consist of a maximum of seven points, as opposed to advantage scoring which allows for a hypothetically infinite number of points per game. For this reason, no-ad scoring is used in some competition formats to ensure quicker matches.\nDuring a tiebreak game, each side's points are counted more simply as \"0, 1, 2, etc.\" rather than \"love, 15, 30, etc.\" used during other games. A standard tiebreak is won by the first side to win seven points by a two-point margin. Other variations (e.g., 10-point tiebreak) are sometimes used.\nPlay of a single point.\nThe players (or teams) stand on opposite sides of the net. One player is designated the server, and the opposing player (or, in doubles, one of the opposing players) is the receiver. The players (or teams) alternate serving with each game. From point-to-point within a game, the server alternates serving from the right and left sides of their court. The first point of a game is always served from the server's right side. At the start of each point, the server stands behind their baseline, anywhere between the center line and the sideline, and serves the ball at the service box diagonally opposite. The receiver may stand anywhere on their side of the net and prepare to return the serve.\nA legal serve is any serve which is not a \"fault.\" A fault occurs if the ball does not land in the appropriate service box on the receiver's side of the net. Service faults are also incurred for missing the ball, stepping on the baseline, center line, or sideline before striking the ball (foot fault), and walking or running while serving. Two consecutive faults (double fault) result in the receiver winning the point. The receiver must allow the serve to bounce once before returning it, or else the server automatically wins the point.\nIf the ball touches the net during an otherwise legal serve (\"let\" or \"net\" service), the serve is retaken without being counted as a fault. After the serve, if the ball touches the net during the point but lands safely on the opposite side, then play continues as normal without stopping.\nOnce a legal serve is made, the players then alternate returning the ball from their side of the court to the opponent's side. The point is lost by whichever player first:\nThe rules specifically \"allow\" certain actions, such as:\nThe lines are considered part of the court and so a ball is \"in\" the court if it touches \"any\" part of the relevant line, even if a majority of the ball bounces outside of the line. In an officiated match, it is the duty of line umpires to call a ball \"out\" if it bounces outside of the relevant line(s). The chair umpire may overrule the line umpire if they believe an in or out call is clearly incorrect. On clay courts, ball marks left on the court's surface may be visually inspected by the chair umpire after a disputed call. In unofficiated matches, players are responsible for making their own calls on their respective sides of the court, in which case the ethics of the game requires honesty and a willingness to give one's opponent the benefit of the doubt.\nInstant replay.\nComputer-assisted video tracking technology can determine the precise position of a ball at impact with a margin of error less than five millimeters.\nAccordingly, starting with the NASDAQ-100 Open in March 2006, most top-level professional tournaments allow systems such as Hawk-Eye to be used to settle disputed line calls. When this technology is in place, players are allowed a maximum of three incorrect challenges per set. If a set reaches six games-all, then each player is awarded one additional challenge for the tiebreak.\nThe use of instant replay technology remains uncommon on clay courts, where visual inspection of ball marks predominates.\nAlternative rules.\nIn American college tennis.\nAs of 1999, in NCAA tennis in the United States, a let service is not retaken and the point continues without stopping."

        "title": "UCI Road World Cup",
        "text": "The UCI Road World Cup was a season-long road cycling competition held from 1989 until 2004 and comprising ten one-day events.\nThe World Cup was made up of around ten one-day races chosen from the prestigious classics. An individual classification and a team classification were established. In the last editions, the first 25 in each round scored from 100 to 1 points. During these events, the provisional leader of the classification wore a distinctive jersey.\nHistory.\nThe competition was inaugurated in 1989, and replaced the Super Prestige Pernod International. In the first three years, the competition was sponsored by Perrier. The competition determined a winning individual, and a winning team.\nIn 1989, the classics making up the World Cup were: Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Amstel Gold Race, Wincanton Classic (Newcastle), Grand Prix of the Americas (Montreal), Clásica de San Sebastián, Züri-Metzgete, Grand Prix de la Liberation (Team Time Trial in Eindhoven), Paris-Tours, Giro di Lombardia. In 1990, a final individual time trial was added in Lunel. In 1991, this time trial was contested in Bergamo (event counting as both the Grand Prix des Nations and the Trofeo Baracchi).\nIn 1992, the Grand Prix de la Liberation disappeared from the World Cup events. The Grand Prix of the Americas becomes the Grand Prix Téléglobe (it will disappear from the World Cup events the following year). That same year, the final time trial was definitively replaced by the Grand Prix des Nations, contested in Palma de Mallorca . In 1993, the Grand Prix des Nations was contested at Lac de Madine. He will disappear from the World Cup events the following year. In 1994, the Wincanton Classic became the Leeds International Classic.\nIn 1995, a new event was added to the calendar: the Frankfurt Grand Prix. It will be its only year as a World Cup event, just like the Japan Cup in 1996.\nIn 1997, the Leeds International Classic became the Rochester Classic. The following year it was replaced by the HEW Cyclassics in Hamburg . From that year, the 10 classics making up the World Cup are therefore: Milan-San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris-Roubaix, Amstel Gold Race, Liège-Bastogne-Liège, Hamburg Hew Cyclassics, Clásica de San Sebastián, Züri-Metzgete, Paris-Tours, Giro di Lombardia.\nThe World Cup disappeared with the creation of the ProTour and the continental circuits in 2005.\nThe record number of wins was Paolo Bettini's three consecutive wins in 2002, 2003, and the last edition in 2004. Three riders won the competition twice: Maurizio Fondriest (1991 and 1993), Johan Museeuw (1995 and 1996) and Michele Bartoli (1997 and 1998).\nThe competition was run in parallel to the UCI Road World Rankings, which included all UCI sanctioned events. Both were replaced at the end of the 2004 season with the inauguration of the UCI ProTour and UCI Continental Circuits.\nPoints distribution.\nIndividual.\nPoints are awarded for the best riders in each race according to the following scale:\nFrom 1997, the rider in order to be taken into account in the final general classification, must participate in at least six of the 10 races.\nTeams.\nA ranking of the teams has also been set up. During each race, the places of the first three riders of each team are added together. The team with the lowest total receives 12 points in the team standings, the second team receives nine, the third team receives eight and so on until the tenth team scores a point.\nFrom 1997, the team in order to be taken into account in the final general classification, must participate in at least eight of the 10 races.\nRaces.\n\"The races with grey background existed but was not in the World Cup calendar for that year\"\nThe final time trial (1990-1993) was an invitation event. The invited riders are the single Cup race winners, the first 10 of the general classification before the last race, the first 10 in the World Ranking and the reigning World Champion. Generally some riders forfeit their right to start and some others in the high classification of World Cup are invited.\nJersey.\nAfter each race, the points gained for each rider were added to the current total. A special rainbow jersey was then presented to the leading rider in the overall ranking of the World Cup. He was obliged to wear this jersey in the further World Cup races as long as he held the lead in the overall standings. The jersey was issued for the first time in 1990 edition. It retained the same core design with minor modifications of logos and colors. Only in the first edition a grey-yellow jersey was awarded to the leader without the rainbow scheme."

Previously known as the \"Rugby League Imperial Board\", the \" International Rugby League Board\" and latterly the \"Rugby League International Federation\", the IRL is responsible for the \"Laws of the Game\", the development, organisation and governance of rugby leagues internationally, and for the sport's major international tournaments; most notably the Rugby League World Cup.\nThere are two regional associations affiliated to the IRL; the European Rugby League (ERL) and the Asia-Pacific Rugby League (APRL).\nHistory.\n1895–1926: Rugby league foundations.\nRugby league, which had started in England in 1895 and spread to Wales in 1907 and Australia and New Zealand in 1908, was introduced into France in 1934 after their rugby union side was banned from the International Rugby Board for both breaching amateur regulations and for constant foul play on the field.\n1927–1947: Imperial Rugby League Board.\nThe Imperial Rugby League Board was formed in 1927. The Rugby Football League's authority in the sport was supported by having a majority of the representatives on the Board. The RFL had three representatives while Australia and New Zealand each had one. According to Collins (2000), the imbalanced voting rights were a result of the RFL being the representative for the \"mother country\" and the other members being keen to demonstrate their loyalty to the Crown.\nIn 1935 the French Rugby League proposed the constitution of an international board for rugby league, but the Australians were not favourable, and the idea was abandoned for a while.\n1948–1997: International Rugby League Board.\nThe Board was formed on 25 January 1948 in Bordeaux, France at the impetus of the French, led by Paul Barrière. The Fédération Française de Rugby à XIII, New Zealand Rugby League and Britain's Rugby Football League met during the 1947–48 Kiwi tour of Europe and these three governing bodies agreed to form the International Rugby League Board (IRLB). At the meeting, it was decided that initially the RFL would oversee the sport's rules while the IRLB developed. The Australian Rugby League joined the IRLB some months later.\nOver the next few years the IRLB held meetings with the outcomes forming the Rugby League World Cup which made its début in 1954.\nIn the view of Harry Edgar, from the Board's establishment \"until his death in 1986, Bill Fallowfield was a dominant figure in its activities. Always a keen student of the rules of the game, [Fallowfield], like Australia's Tom Bellew in more recent times, strove to establish uniformity in the rules between all nations\".\nFormer RFL Chief Executive David Oxley, an attendee of International Board meetings for close to 20 years, confirmed that proceedings were not dominated by the Australians: \"Despite their dominance of the game on the field, the Aussies did not get everything their own way on the old Board because frequently the New Zealanders were at loggerheads with them. The Kiwis would vote against the Aussies, and France would vote with Great Britain, leaving Papua New Guinea as Australia's only guaranteed supporter.\"\nOxley reveals, \"a lot of the really positive things were initiated by the British - certainly on rule changes, and the move to actually expand the role of the Board.\" Oxley states: \"it was a British idea to introduce the levy on all Test match receipts to go into an international development fund. It was only 2 percent, but it did apply to television broadcast fees as well as gate receipts, so it built up into sizeable amounts, and it was that fund that paid for all we did in Russia, South Africa and the fine work done by Bob Abbott in the South Pacific, plus a significant part of the Student World Cup.\"\nOxley says that Kevin Humphries may have dominated for the Australians for a time but that was due to his personality. At that time the Board's role was mostly restricted to discussion of rule changes. Oxley states that it was the British who \"established the procedure that the Board should meet on a more regular basis - at least once a year - and should look at ways of helping the expansion of the game.\"\nAfter 1948, when only four sanctioned international teams being overseen by the IRLB and competing in annual competition, the IRLB grew to see twelve full member nations join the federation along with around thirty member nations and countless affiliates.\nIn 1954, the Rugby League World Cup, the first for either code of rugby, was formed at the instigation of the French.\nIn 1966, the International Board introduced a rule ending unlimited tackles and instead allowing the team in possession three play-the-balls followed by forming a scrum on the fourth tackle. This was increased to six tackles in 1972 and in 1983 the scrum was replaced by a handover.\nThe Australians had always been strong in supporting expansion of the game including places such as \"South Africa, America and Canada\". The Australians even took a lead role in aiding the game in France, in what might be considered the British sphere of influence, the ARL funded Tas Baitieri in a Development Officer position and they also provided coaching and player assistance and continued to have the Kangaroos tour France despite the costs.\nAfter the Australian Rugby League introduced the World Sevens in 1988, the International Board took a much more active part in worldwide developments. Harry Edgar states: \"Much of the successful participation in the 1995 World Cup came as a direct result of the ARL's World Sevens tournament\"; \"the game in Fiji was launched solely because of [the] World Sevens.\"\nSome nations were introduced to international rugby league through the British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA). The RFL would often feel embarrassment at meetings when they \"could claim to have done so little\" while BARLA was praised by other attendees.\nMaurice Lindsay has been credited with ensuring the 10-team 1995 World Cup was accompanied by an Emerging Nations tournament of seven teams, supporting international growth.\nThe 1995 World Cup was the \"swansong of the original Board\". With the Super League war started, the Board held what would be their last meeting immediately before that tournament, it ended \"acrimoniously\" as every member nation except Australia \"stated their intention to withdraw their membership\" and to establish the Super League International Board (SLIB) to govern Super League worldwide. The agreements that the former IRLB members signed with Super League had the effect of \"usurping\" the international board's control and diminishing the influence of its director-general, the Australian Rugby League's chairman, Ken Arthurson. The agreements removed international playing opposition for the Australian Rugby League's representative sides.\nThe SLIB gave its Pacific island members full voting rights in a display of its democratic values towards the game, although some were sceptical that the representatives of the powerful richer nations would allow themselves to be overruled. The Pacific island nations were only associate members of the IRLB with only the full members Australia, Great Britain, France, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea having a vote.\n1998–2019: Rugby League International Federation.\nIn 1998, the Super League International Board was disestablished and replaced by a new organisation, the Rugby League International Federation, as the \"Super League war\" ended in Australia and international rugby league reunited. The replacement saw worldwide governance of rugby league handed back to the sport's national governing bodies.\nThe meeting in Sydney at which it was agreed to form the RLIF was held at the request of the Australian and New Zealand Rugby Leagues. Britain was represented by the Rugby Football League, rather than Super League (Europe), the company formed by its leading clubs.\nJohn McDonald, chair of the Australian Rugby League, became chair of the RLIF. Maurice Lindsay, the chairman of the Super League International Board (SLIB), was bypassed after he had suggested that the SLIB, with him leading it, should carry on the governance of the international game. Lindsay's candidature was weak due to his role in the Super League war. The cessation of Super League operations in Australasia and the notice that had been given of the SLIB's intention to cease funding the sport in the Pacific islands, meant the SLIB could be left with only Britain left as a member. The French were happy to cut ties with SLIB and join the new Federation as, allegedly, \"they never saw a penny of the £1 million they believed they had been promised to sign up with Super League\".\nIn 1998, there was regret that rugby league had been so badly damaged, Harry Edgar, a rugby league writer, warned, \"there can be no place for politics or individuals seeking personal glorification\" as the \"international game picks up the pieces after three years of bitter fall-out\".\nThe RLIF's scheduling of competitions made shortly after its formation, specifically the timing of world cups, was criticised by Graham Clay, editor of Open Rugby magazine for opting for a four-yearly cycle beginning in 2002 that would mean rugby league facing strong competition from other major sporting events for corporate sponsorship. During the build-up to the 2008 World Cup, which had been timed to coincide with Australia's \"Centenary of Rugby League\" celebrations, it was stated and confirmed afterwards that the following tournament in the United Kingdom would be held in 2013 to avoid the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and that subsequent World Cups would be contested on a four-year cycle.\nThe absence of a formal schedule of international competition has been criticised as leaving the sport \"weak in international development, and in finances to help the game survive and grow outside the UK and Australia\". Some moves have been made to correct this though, with the RFL's Richard Lewis proposing a ten-year international plan in 2007.\nIn 2009 the member nations agreed that the RLIF should negotiate over sponsorship, licensing and broadcast rights for international rugby league rather than the member nations.\nAs of 2009, the RLIF imposed a levy of 10% on net gate receipts at all international matches, providing the International Federation with revenues. The RLIF makes grants to member nations to help foster the game but the effectiveness of these has been questioned.\nThe Pacific Rim nations of Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Samoa, Fiji and the Cook Islands united to form the Pacific Islands Rugby League Federation (PIRLF) in December 2009.\nHowever, PIRLF was not formally recognised by the RLIF, as consideration was being given to modernising the RLIF constitution and membership structure. The Wales Rugby League were granted full membership of the RLIF in 2010 at a meeting in Melbourne, Australia.\nAt a special general meeting held in Auckland, New Zealand, in November 2010, a new constitution was approved that gave New Zealand, Australia and England permanent seats on the RLIF board, with provision made for an additional seat each by May 2011 for the RLEF and a soon-to-be-formed Asia-Pacific Rugby League Confederation (APRLC), once RLEF and APRLC were granted Associate Membership status by the RLIF.\nThe APRLC was incorporated in April 2011 with member nations New Zealand, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Samoa, Fiji and the Cook Islands.\nScotland and Ireland were each granted full membership of the RLIF, and the RLEF and APRLC Associate Membership, at the annual general meeting held in Auckland, New Zealand, in May 2011. A new Chairman, Scott Carter was also elected, becoming the first Kiwi to hold the role. This prompted a walkout by the Rugby Football League's Richard Lewis who believed he should have succeeded Australia's Colin Love.\nSerbia and Lebanon were each granted full membership of the RLIF at the annual general meeting held in Manchester, England in May 2012. Ukraine, Russia and Jamaica were granted full membership in 2013.\nNigel Wood was elected as Chairman in 2014 following and oversaw reforms, including the appointment of the first full-time CEO, former England and Wales Cricket Board CEO David Collier. In February 2018, John Grant was appointed as the new Chairman of the RLIF\n2019–present: International Rugby League.\nOn 14 October 2019, the RLIF board voted to officially change its name to International Rugby League with the change taking effect the next day.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Rugby League and European Rugby League banned Russia from all international rugby league competitions.\nDuring the 2021 Rugby League World Cup, IRL chairman Troy Grant announced that he was pushing for a nines tournament to be introduced to the Summer Olympics by Brisbane 2032 as well as a wheelchair tournament to be introduced to the Paralympics.\nIn March 2024, the IRL downgraded Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Russia, and Scotland from full to affiliate members due to noncompliance with the full membership criteria; Russia remained suspended. Belgium, Denmark, Latvia, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad and Tobago were expelled due to inactivity. The federations of Argentina and Spain were admitted as observers.\nLaws of the game.\nThe laws of rugby league have been the responsibility of the RLIF since its formation in 1998. Before that the Rugby Football League and IRLB, after its inception in 1948, were the bodies that maintained the Laws.\nThe International Federation in conjunction with the nations governing bodies (mainly the Australian Rugby League, Fédération Française de Rugby à XIII, New Zealand Rugby League and the Rugby Football League) often meet on a semi-regular basis of up to four times per year to make changes or decide new rules; although all test playing nations have a say in the altering of the rules and laws of rugby league.\nInternational eligibility.\nThe RLIF reiterated in 2008 that a player may represent a country if it is the country of their parents or if that country has been the player's \"principal country of residence\" for three years up until the date of the player's selection. A player may also be selected for country that they have represented in international rugby league in any age level before the 1998 introduction of the RLIF's constitution, or a country which the player has represented in a senior international competition in any other sport.\nIn 2009, international qualification regulations were modified in response to dissatisfaction about players representing different nations too easily. Players who have represented one country in World Cup qualifiers would now \"not be permitted\" to play for a different one in the World Cup tournament. The rule change did not apply to players who had played for a country in a Test series or non-World Cup related tournament. Applications must still be made to the RLIF for those changes still permitted.\nThe rules were clarified in 2016 by introducing tiers which determine if and when a player can represent more than one country. The changes also increased the residence period from three years to five.\nCompetitions.\nInternational Rugby League overseas international tournaments. Competitions within one of the four confederations (Americas Rugby League, Asia-Pacific Rugby League, European Rugby League, and Middle East Africa Rugby League) are usually not overseen by the IRL.\nWorld Cup.\nThe IRL is in charge of the Rugby League World Cup, first held in 1954 in France and the first competition to be officially known as the \"Rugby World Cup\". Since then the World Cup has been held a total of 16 times, with the most recent Cup being held in England in 2021. The IRL also sanctioned and has overseen the Women's Rugby League World Cup since its inception in 2000. The tournament is held in conjunction with the men's tournament, but will be a separate event from 2028.\nFour Nations.\nThe IRL also runs the Four Nations series between the Big Three powers, England, Australia and New Zealand and a fourth nation from either Europe or the South Pacific depending on where the competition is being played, as the hosts are alternate between England and Oceania. The current winners are Australia who won the 2016 series in England.\nEmerging Nations Tournament.\nThe Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament is a tournament between affiliate members and nations with goals of growing the game of rugby league.\nFuture tournaments.\nThe RLIF plan to introduce a Continental Cup that would be played every four years to replace the Four Nations.\nRecognitions and awards.\nThe IRL presented several international awards annually, beginning in 2004 before the final edition in 2014.\nIn 2017, the Purchased the Golden Boot Award from League Publications Ltd..\nInternational rankings.\nThe IRL publishes and maintains the rankings of the men's national rugby league teams. The concept was first launched in January 2007 following in the footsteps of the European Rankings published by the Rugby League European Federation.\nThe rankings are calculated based on an average of points accumulated by each Nation over a three-year cycle. Under the structure, matches deemed of higher importance such as World Cup games, Tri-Nations and other major tournament finals draw more points than mid-season Tests and other internationals. For each match that a nation participates they are given a base level of points. This base level is affected upon the type of match and the status of the opponent.\nBonus points are given for teams that reach certain milestones deemed of significant international importance including reaching a tournament final or qualifying for an event such as a World Cup.\nFrom the total number of points that a nation will receive these points are then averaged to help give a more accurate view of the performance of a nation over the three-year cycle.\nNations which have played less than a certain number of matches deemed acceptable over a three-year cycle will be penalised under the current point structure."

He would help lead the team to two Stanley Cups. In 1909, he helped convince ice hockey executives to change two rules still in place today. The first was the change from a game consisting of two 30 minute halves to three 20 minute periods. He was also instrumental in the decision to discontinue the rover position. The number of players on the ice per team was dropped to six.\nNorthey formed the Canadian Arena Company and was instrumental in building Arena Gardens in Toronto, and owned Montreal Arena, which burned down in 1918. In 1924, Northey helped construct the famous Montreal Forum. From 1947 to 1956 he served as vice president with Montreal. He spent the 1956–57 season as President of the Montreal Canadiens. The Canadiens were sold to Molson Family in summer of 1957, and Northey retired from hockey. His name was engraved on the Stanley Cup three times in 1953, 1956, and 1957.\nNorthey was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947.\nPersonal life.\nOn November 25, 1922, Northey survived a serious traffic accident near Oakville, Ontario when three touring cars collided on the Hamilton highway, killing one man.\nOutside of ice hockey Northey was also involved in horse racing as a secretary-treasurer with the Jockey Club of Montreal."

        "title": "Shaun Rogers (American football)",
        "text": " Shaun Christopher O'Shea Rogers (born March 12, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Texas Longhorns. He was selected by the Detroit Lions in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft with the 61st overall pick. Rogers has also played for the Cleveland Browns and New Orleans Saints. Running back Adrian Peterson considered Rogers one of the hardest-hitting players in the NFL.\nEarly years.\nAt La Porte High School in La Porte, Texas, Rogers was a two-way tackle, and also lettered in basketball. He is known for his athleticism, ability to rush the quarterback, and also his ability to stop the run. He was also known to play running back near the goal line. He had 17 attempts for 135 yards. His nickname in the locker room was Chunks.\nCollege career.\nShaun Rogers played for the University of Texas, pairing with nose tackle Casey Hampton, and ranked third on the school's career-record list with 53 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He collected 199 tackles (108 solo) with 14 sacks and 54 pressures during his career. In 2000, he was named to the AP Honorable Mention All-Big 12 Team. That year, he played in nine games, starting six contests at right defensive tackle. He helped the Longhorns lead the nation in pass efficiency defense and rank seventh in total defense. He recorded 44 tackles (24 solos) with 3.5 sacks for minus 31 yards and 27 stops for losses of 56 yards. \nProfessional career.\n2001 NFL Draft.\nPrior to the draft, Rogers recorded a 5.3 sec 40-yard dash while weighing . Rogers was selected by the Detroit Lions in the second round (61st overall) in the 2001 NFL Draft.\nDetroit Lions.\nIn his rookie season, he recorded 90 tackles (68 solo), 3 sacks, 1 forced fumble, and 4 pass deflections in 16 starts. In 2002, Rogers finished with 48 tackles (26 solo), 2.5 sacks, and 2 pass deflections in 14 games. In 2003, he started in all 16 games and finished the season with 58 tackles (42 solo), 4 sacks, 1 forced fumble, and 5 pass deflections. His 2004 season was nearly identical to the previous one, as he again started in all 16 games and posted 68 tackles (48 solo), 4 sacks, and 5 pass deflections. He was selected as a Pro Bowl starter and was named an AP 2nd Team All-Pro. In 2005, Rogers recorded 39 tackles (29 solo), 5.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, and 2 pass deflections in 14 games and was selected as a Pro Bowl starter for the second straight year.\nOn October 18, 2006, Rogers was suspended four games for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. His agent has stated that Rogers' appetite suppressant medication was the reason for his positive test, but that appealing would not help the situation. Rogers played in only 6 games during the 2006 season and finished with 20 tackles (19 solo) and 3 sacks.\nOn November 4, 2007, Rogers intercepted a pass from Denver Broncos quarterback Patrick Ramsey and returned it 66 yards for a touchdown. Rogers recorded 39 tackles (26 solo), 7 sacks, 1 interception, and 3 pass deflection in 16 games during the 2007 season.\nCleveland Browns.\nOn February 29, 2008, Rogers was traded to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for Leigh Bodden and 2008 3rd round pick Andre Fluellen. The Browns ran a 3-4 defense, as opposed to the 4-3 defense Rogers played in for Detroit, and Rogers became the Browns' 3-4 nose tackle. In 2008, Rogers finished with 76 tackles (61 solo), 4.5 sacks, and 4 pass deflections in 16 games and was selected as a Pro Bowl reserve. On November 30, 2009, Rogers was placed on Injured Reserve due to a broken leg. He finished the 2009 season with 36 tackles (27 solo), 2 sacks, and 1 pass deflection. During the 2010 offseason, Rogers was involved in trade rumors, but the Browns ultimately decided to keep him and move him to 3-4 defensive end, which was believed to better suit his skills than the nose tackle position. On February 9, 2011, Rogers was released by the Browns.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn March 1, 2011, the Saints signed Rogers to a one-year contract worth $4 million. It has been reported that he was offered $6 million to play elsewhere, but ultimately decided to play for the Saints. After a disappointing 2011 campaign, the Saints elected to not resign Rogers.\nNew York Giants.\nOn April 26, 2012, the New York Giants signed Rogers to a contract. Due to a blood clot in his left calf, the team announced that Rogers would miss the entirety of the 2012-13 NFL season. However, after receiving a more encouraging second opinion on the injury, Giants coach Tom Coughlin maintained a \"ray of hope\" that Rogers could return before the season's end.\nOn August 31, 2012, Rogers was placed on season-ending injured reserve due to the clot. Then, the Giants re-signed Rogers on February 7, 2013.\nPersonal life.\nIn June 2007, Rogers was accused of sexually assaulting an exotic dancer. Charges were never filed due to lack of evidence.\nOn April 1, 2010, Rogers was arrested at Cleveland Hopkins Airport for having a loaded gun in his carry on luggage. The NFL fined Rodgers $400,000 for the incident."

It was released for the PlayStation 2 in North America on 12 November 2002 and Europe on 6 December 2002. The game was developed by The Code Monkeys and co-published by Fox Interactive and Electronic Arts. The story and dialogue were written by writers from \"The Simpsons\", with all character voices supplied by the cast. The game received generally negative reviews from critics.\nGameplay.\nSpringfield has been converted into a skate park for the Annual Skate Tour, full of skate-able objects and landmarks from the television series. Players are able to choose one of the nine characters available and compete for the grand prize. All of the characters' voices were recorded by the actual voice actors from \"The Simpsons\". Each character has over forty unique moves. Players can test their skills in either a two-player head-to-head skate off, or in one of the fast and furious modes: Freeskate, Skate Fest, Trick Contest, and a game of skateboard H-O-R-S-E, unlocking additional characters, locations, and skateboards. Players can also choose to learn all the skateboard moves and tricks before they begin the actual game in the Skillz School mode.\nDevelopment.\n\"The Simpsons Skateboarding\" was developed by The Code Monkeys and published by Electronic Arts (EA Games) under license from Fox Interactive.

There were no mention of a console in the advertisement and no gameplay details were revealed. In November 2001, EA representatives said they were not ready to comment on the product. On 16 May 2002, a few days before the E3 Media and Business Summit, they released their first piece of information about the game. All of the characters' voices were recorded by the actual voice actors from \"The Simpsons\".\nReception.\n\"The Simpsons Skateboarding\" received \"unfavorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was criticized for its chunky graphics, poorly recorded sound and music, lack of skateboarding tricks, and poor controls whilst the in-game dialogue were mixed.\nAndrew Reiner of \"Game Informer\" said: \"Never before have I seen a developer put forth such an effort to secure the Worst Game of the Year award. I'll even go as far to say that this may very well be the worst PlayStation 2 game on the market.\" Kevin Murphy of GameSpy said that \"\"The Simpsons Skateboarding\" should be a case study in bad game design.\""

        "title": "Cheetahs (rugby union)",
        "text": "The Cheetahs (known for sponsorship reasons as the Toyota Cheetahs), is a South African professional rugby union team based at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein. They have played Super Rugby between 2006 and 2017, then the Pro14 (now United Rugby Championship) from 2017 to 2020, and currently the EPCR Challenge Cup since 2022.\nThe franchise area encompasses the western half of the Free State province, the same as that of provincial Currie Cup side the . Between 2006 and 2015, the from the eastern half of the Free State province and from the Northern Cape province were Cheetahs franchise partners, but this ended prior to the 2016 Super Rugby season.\nThe Cheetahs was one of the two new franchises that entered the expanded Super 14 competition in 2006, the other being Australia's Western Force. The Central Union was awarded the fifth South African franchise over the SEC franchise in April 2005. In its first season the Cheetahs did surprisingly well, finishing tenth in the final standings, out of 14 sides. Prior to being accepted into the 2006 Super 14 season, the Cheetahs were represented as a part of the Cats. In addition, before the South African Rugby Union entered regionalised franchises into the competition, the Free State Cheetahs side competed in the 1997 Super 12 season.\nStrip.\nThe primary strip for the Toyota Cheetahs is an orange jersey with a white collar and white trim. Black shorts with orange socks and white trim. The colours are representative of the Free State Currie Cup side; orange and white (Free State Cheetahs). The alternative jersey is the same design, though it is a white jersey with an orange collar and orange trim. Black shorts with orange socks and white trim.\nHistory.\nPrior to South Africa entering franchises into the then Super 12, the domestic Currie Cup sides competed instead. The Free State Cheetahs, one of the sides that make up the current Central Cheetahs, competed in one Super 12 season in 1997. The Free State played 11 matches, winning 5 and losing 6. They placed 7th on the end of season standings.\nProposals by the Central Union franchise and the SEC (Southern and Eastern Cape) franchise were studied for the allocation of a fifth Super Rugby team licence. The Central Union emphasized points to the SARU such as that the region is second only to the Western Province in terms of producing players for the national side. The Central Union noted that they have a strong and stable fanbase that would be able to meet financial and administrative responsibilities and demands of a Super 14 rugby side.\nIn mid April 2005, the South African Rugby Union announced that the Central Unions franchise would be its fifth team for the expanded Super 14 competition that would begin in 2006. They were awarded the franchise ahead of the Southern and Eastern Cape (see Southern Spears). In the pre-season of their entrance to the new look Super 14 competition, the Cheetahs played both of the other new franchises, new Australian team; the Western Force and 2007 fellow South African team, the Southern Spears. The Cheetahs proved to be the strongest out of the new sides, demolishing the Spears 48 to nil and soundly defeating the Force in Perth. \nThe Cheetahs played their first game on 10 February, proving they are fighting fit, but were not good enough on the day for the South African Bulls, losing their first official match in Bloemfontein 18 points to 30. The Cheetahs won their first Super 14 game in week two, defeating the Sharks in a thrilling match seeing the Cheetahs win by a single point, 27 to 26. Entering round four of the 2006 season, the Cheetahs were facing the table leaders, the Hurricanes. In a surprise result, the Cheetahs beat the table leaders, thus winning their first home game and proving they deserve to be in the Super 14.\nThe Cheetahs finally broke their drought in overseas matches with an upset over the New South Wales Waratahs on 19 March 2011.\nFollowing SANZAAR's decision to reduce the number of teams for 2018, the South African Rugby Union announced that the Cheetahs would be one of the teams cut from the 2018 competition. Instead, the Cheetahs joined the previously Northern Hemisphere-exclusive Pro14 competition prior to the 2017–18 season.\nThe Cheetahs were unable to compete in the 2020–21 Pro14 due to COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions. Instead, the team played the Super Rugby Unlocked in late 2020 and the Preparation Series in early 2021. However, the Cheetahs were not invited into the Pro14 Rainbow Cup. The Pro14 was rebranded as the United Rugby Championship for the 2021–22, and the team was not selected to enter it.\nSince 2022, the Cheetahs play in the EPCR Challenge Cup as an invited team.\nStadia.\nThe Cheetahs' home stadium is the Free State Stadium, previously referred to as Vodacom Park for sponsorship purposes, located in Bloemfontein. The stadium had its capacity increased to 48,000 for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The stadium is the home of Free State rugby as it is also home to the Free State Cheetahs, a Currie Cup side which produces a large number of players for the Cheetahs franchise. A then-capacity crowd of 37,383 watched the Cheetahs in their first official Super 14 match against the Bulls on 10 February 2006.\nThe Cheetahs also previously played matches at Griquas Park in Kimberley, the home of the Griqualand West Rugby Union, and at North West Stadium in Welkom, the home of the Griffons Rugby Union.\nCurrent squad.\nThe Cheetahs squad for 2023–24 EPCR Challenge Cup is:\nRecords.\nPro14 records.\nThe Cheetahs' Pro14 records are as follows (updated 11 February 2018):\nSuper Rugby records.\nThe Cheetahs' Super Rugby records are as follows:"

The Series came under Vans' ownership in 1998. \nThe three venues of Haleiwa, Sunset, and Pipeline are the last three major events of the professional surfing season; the Pipe Masters being the final event of the World Surf League Championship Tour up until 2020 when it became the first event of the 2020-21 wraparound season in December 2020.\nIn 2020, under challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the series went fully digital. Surfers had from December 21, 2020, to January 15, 2021, to upload their two best video clips from each of the three venues. The women's division returned to Pipeline. The digital Vans Triple Crown of Surfing awarded individual location titles for Haleiwa, Sunset and Pipeline, as well as overall Vans Triple Crown champion titles to the top performing man and woman across all three locations, with a total prize purse of $200,000 split equally among men and women. There was also a digital Fan Vote title, for fan favorites, for the first time. The Pipeline event is not to be confused with the 2020 Pipeline Masters tournament that was held to start the 2020-21 wraparound season.\nThe events are: \nIn addition to individual event champions, the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing crowns an overall champion each year. This goes to the surfer who has performed best across all three competitions."

        "title": "Hong Kong Open (golf)",
        "text": "The Hong Kong Open is a golf tournament which is played on the Asian Tour, and formerly on the European Tour. It was founded in 1959 and in 1962 was one of the five tournaments that made up the inaugural Far East Circuit, later known as the Asia Golf Circuit. It remained part of the circuit until 1996, before joining the Asian Tour, then known as the Omega Tour, in 1997. It became co-sanctioned by the European Tour in 2001, as part of the 2002 season.\nThe Hong Kong Open was played in spring from its inception until 1994, but since 1995 has usually been played towards the end of the year, in November or December, and as a result has often fallen into the following year's European Tour season.\nSince taking its place on the European Tour the event has always been held at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Sheung Shui, New Territories. The Hong Kong Golf Association, Hong Kong PGA, and Chinese PGA receive a limited number of exemptions into the tournament for their members.\nHistory.\nIn 1958, Hong Kong Golf Club member Kim Hall wrote to Australian professional Eric Cremin to see if those players playing in the Philippine Open in 1959 would consider staying in the region to play in Hong Kong. Hall then approached Peter Plumley, secretary of \"South China Morning Post\", who was also a golfer. Plumley then persuaded his boss to sponsor 1,000 Australian pounds in prize money in the name of \"South China Morning Post\". Then, the first Hong Kong Open was launched in February 1959. According to Hong Kong Golf Club member Willie Woo, Kim Hall was very keen for the tournament and he talked a lot with Australian golfers, including Peter Thomson. Woo helped to get Taiwanese players through his connections.\nThe first tournament was hosted by Sir Robert Black, the then-Governor of Hong Kong. Around one thousand spectators joined the tournament. Taiwanese golfer Lu Liang-Huan won the inaugural edition of the tournament. The success of the Hong Kong Open prompted first Singapore in 1961, and then Malaysia and Japan in 1962, to introduce their own tournaments and bring about the setting up of the Far East Golf Circuit. The circuit further expanded into a regular ten-tournament tour, called the Asia Golf Circuit, that existed until the end of the twentieth century.\nDespite the SCMP's original agreement to maintain 1,000 pounds sponsorship of the Hong Kong Open, it was felt that prize money would need to be increased if the best players were to be attracted. To that end the 1963 event was jointly sponsored by the SCMP and British American Tobacco, with the purse being increased to 4,000 pounds as a result.\nDue to poor weather conditions during the 1966 event, the Hong Kong Golf Club lost HK$10,442 as the money put up by the sponsors was insufficient to cover expenses. As a result, the club decided that in future it could not undertake to assist financially in any way, but would continued provide the courses and the general facilities. The 1968 tournament was the first edition to be shown live on television. In 1969, the newly formed the Hong Kong Golf Association took up the task of organising the tournament. In 1971, the Hong Kong Open was on the verge of disappearing due to low spectator numbers and financial problems, but with the assistance of the Asia Pacific Golf Confederation, who were keen to retain the event on the Asia Golf Circuit, the tournament was saved.\nIn 1996, Hong Kong golfer Dominique Boulet finished fourth, the best result by a local golfer. In 2008, Florida-based Hong Kong amateur Shun Yat Hak became the youngest player ever to make the cut in a European Tour event, at 14 years and 304 days, eclipsing the record set by Sergio García at the Turespaña Open Mediterrania in 1995. At the other end of the age spectrum, Miguel Ángel Jiménez became the oldest golfer ever to win on the European Tour when he won in 2012 at age , and extended his record by defending his title in 2013 at age .\nIn 2013, organizers and potential sponsors raised concerns over the complex becoming enmeshed in a controversial redevelopment plan for Fan Ling. The tournament was played that year without a title sponsor.\nIn 2020, the Hong Kong Open organizers announced that the tournament would be postponed till 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions.\nIn March 2023, it was confirmed that the Hong Kong Open would return after a two-year hiatus as an Asian Tour event. The tournament would also gain International Series status.\nWinners.\nSource:"

        "text": "John Michael Carney (born April 20, 1964) is an American former professional football kicker who played in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals as an undrafted free agent in 1987.\nCarney was also a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, San Diego Chargers, New Orleans Saints, Los Angeles Rams, Jacksonville Jaguars, Kansas City Chiefs, and New York Giants. He was a Pro Bowl selection with the Chargers in 1994 and with the Giants in 2008. When he was released from the Saints' active roster in December 2009, Carney was third on the NFL career scoring list with a career total of 2,044 points. He was the last remaining player from the 1980s still active in professional football. He has also worked as a kicking consultant for the Saints.\nEarly years.\nCarney attended Cardinal Newman High School in West Palm Beach, Florida, and lettered in football. In football, he won All-State honors as a punter.\nCollege years.\nCarney attended the University of Notre Dame and played football for the Fighting Irish from 1984 to 1986. He was named to Notre Dame's all-time team by \"Sports Illustrated\".\nProfessional career.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nAfter going undrafted in the 1987 NFL Draft, Carney was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals as an undrafted free agent. He was released prior to the regular season and spent the year out of football.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nCarney played five games for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers between 1988 and 1989. He converted two of five field goal attempts and all six extra point attempts.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nCarney attended training camp with the San Diego Chargers in 1990, but did not make the final roster.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nCarney played one game for the Los Angeles Rams in 1990, but did not attempt a field goal or extra point. He was the last remaining active Los Angeles Ram, until the team moved back to Los Angeles from St. Louis in 2016.\nSan Diego Chargers (second stint).\nCarney was re-signed by the Chargers during the 1990 season, appearing in 12 games for the team and converting 19 of 21 field goal attempts. He played 11 seasons with the Chargers through the 2000 season, earning his first Pro Bowl selection in 1994 after going 34-for-38 (89.5 percent) on field goal attempts as the Chargers made it to the Super Bowl. To this day, he remains the Chargers' all-time leading scorer.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nCarney signed with the New Orleans Saints as a free agent prior to the 2001 season.\nOn December 21, 2003, the Saints were trailing the Jaguars 20–13 with 7 seconds left in regulation. Quarterback Aaron Brooks threw the ball in a hurry to Donte Stallworth. As time expired, the Saints continued to lateral the ball around until wide receiver Jerome Pathon eventually scored a touchdown in what became known as the River City Relay. Carney was sent out to kick the extra point to tie the game up and force overtime. Instead, Carney pushed the ball wide right and the Saints lost 19–20. The loss would eliminate the Saints from playoff contention.\nCarney kicked a game-winning field goal against the Carolina Panthers following Hurricane Katrina. He then appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" with quarterback Aaron Brooks on September 19, 2005, as the city celebrated this victory.\nOn April 5, 2007, Carney asked and was given permission to leave the Saints after their acquisition of kicker Olindo Mare.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nFollowing Week 1 of the 2007 NFL season, Carney signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars replacing injured placekicker Josh Scobee. Carney appeared in eight games for the Jaguars in Scobee's absence, converting nine of 11 field goal attempts and 20 of 21 extra point attempts. He was released on November 19 upon Scobee's return.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nOn November 26, 2007, the \"Kansas City Star\" reported that the Kansas City Chiefs would sign Carney after holding tryouts to replace Dave Rayner – making Carney the fourth placekicker to play for the Chiefs within a one-year period, following Lawrence Tynes, Justin Medlock and Rayner. Carney appeared in five games for the Chiefs, going 3-for-3 on field goal attempts and 7-for-7 on extra point attempts.\nNew York Giants.\nOn August 30, 2008, Carney signed with the New York Giants to fill in while Tynes recovered from a knee injury sustained in training camp. Although Tynes would eventually recover from his injury Carney continued to hold on to the starting position and Tynes was relegated to kickoff duties. At age 44, Carney was the oldest active NFL player during the 2008 season.\nAfter a near perfect season (35-for-38 on field goal attempts with two blocked), Carney was chosen as the starting kicker for the NFC for the 2009 Pro Bowl. Carney was not re-signed after his contract expired, leaving him a free agent entering the 2009 season.\nNew Orleans Saints (second stint).\nFollowing the announcement that New Orleans Saints placekicker Garrett Hartley would be suspended for the first four games of the 2009 season, Carney returned to New Orleans on August 15 on a one-year contract.\nWith his start on November 30, he became the sixth player in NFL history to reach 300 career games. Carney was waived on December 22, two weeks after Hartley regained the starting job.\nOn December 24, 2009, the Saints announced that Carney had been hired as a \"kicking consultant\", with responsibility for the snap and hold as well as working on kicking with his successor, Hartley. The appointment meant that Carney was ineligible to kick for any team for the rest of the 2009 season. Carney remained with the Saints in this capacity through the playoffs, and received credit for his role in preparing the comparatively inexperienced Hartley to make a number of critical kicks that helped the Saints win their first Super Bowl.\nCarney started the 2010 season without a team. However, after Hartley missed 3 out of 7 field goal attempts during the Saints' first 3 games, including a short kick in overtime that would have won a game against the Atlanta Falcons, the Saints re-signed Carney (while also retaining Hartley) on September 28, 2010. The signing made him the oldest active player in the NFL at the age of 46. On October 3, 2010, he kicked three field goals in a Saints win against the Carolina Panthers, and became the third oldest player to play in an NFL game (behind only George Blanda and Morten Andersen). On October 12, the Saints released Carney for the third time. Carney would not sign with another NFL team. He, along with George Blanda, is one of two players to play across 4 different decades.\nPersonal life.\nJohn has been married to Producer Holly Carney for 28 years. They share 3 children, Luke Carney, JD Carney and Keely Carney. Both JD and Keely attended John's alma mater The University of Notre Dame. John runs a pre-season kicking training camp in San Diego for professional kickers called \"The Launching Pad\".\nThe Carney family are devout Catholics."

        "title": "George Richardson (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Captain George Taylor Richardson (September 14, 1886 – February 9, 1916) was a Canadian ice hockey player, businessman and soldier. Richardson played hockey for Queen's University and the 14th Regiment of Kingston, and was considered one of the finest amateurs of his time. He is enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and is the namesake of the George Richardson Memorial Trophy. Richardson was part of a prominent business family that owned and operated a grain processing business in Kingston, Ontario. He joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in the First World War, and died in action in Belgium.\nPersonal life.\nRichardson was born and raised in Kingston, and graduated from Queen's with a bachelor of science degree in 1906. He was part of the prominent local Richardson family. His grandfather, James Richardson was the founder of James Richardson &amp; Sons. His uncle, Henry Westman Richardson, was a businessman and a Canadian senator. His sister, Agnes was the benefactor of the Agnes Etherington Art Centre. His brother, James Armstrong Richardson Sr. was a businessman, aviator, and chancellor of Queen's University from 1929 to 1939. His niece, Agnes Benidickson was the first female chancellor of Queen's University. His nephews, James Armstrong Richardson was Manitoba businessman, and Canadian federal cabinet minister; and George Taylor Richardson was a Manitoba businessman, and Order of Manitoba recipient. After graduating from university Richardson joined his family's grain-exporting firm.\nPlaying career.\nRichardson played for the Queen's University Golden Gaels from 1903 to 1906, when the team won the Intercollegiate Hockey Union in 1903, and the Canadian Intercollegiate championship in 1904, and 1906. He was known as a gentlemanly player, and an adept goal scorer. He scored five times against Princeton and Yale when Queen's won the 1903 North American collegiate title. The 1906 Queen's team challenged the Ottawa Hockey Club for the Stanley Cup. Richardson played left wing for the 14th Regiment of Kingston team from 1907 to 1909. The 1908 team won the Ontario Hockey Association title, and the J. Ross Robertson Cup, as Richardson scored seven goals in one game against Stratford. Richardson won the 1909 Allan Cup a year later. He then joined the Kingston Frontenacs as team president, when the juniors won the OHA title in 1911 and 1912. Richardson never pursued a professional hockey career, since he was wealthy enough from working in the family business.\nMilitary service.\nAfter graduating from Queen's Richardson had joined a local militia unit, and rose to become a Lieutenant with The Princess of Wales' Own Regiment. When the First World War was declared, he joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force on September 22, 1914, at CFB Valcartier. He was at the Western Front by February 1915.\nRichardson was promoted to captain as a result of being the sole survivor in the 2nd Battalion during the a battle near Saint-Julien in Langemark. Captain Richardson bought boots and gas masks for men under his command. He was killed in action February 9, 1916, resulting from being shot three times in the hips and abdomen, in a battle near Wulverghem. He is buried in the Bailleul Communal Cemetery Extension in Bailleul, Nord in grave 2027, also listed as plot 2, row B, grave 74.\nPosthumous honours.\nRichardson became a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour of the French Third Republic on March 19, 1916. Captain Richardson is listed on page 154, of the Canadian Book of Remembrance for the First World War. He bequeathed $15,000 to Queen's University for art and athletics, $5,000 for bathing facilities in Kingston, $30,000 to city charities, and $30,000 form a trust fund for the education of the children of the married men in his company, that were disabled or killed in battle. The George Taylor Richardson Memorial Fund was established to provide grants for the stimulation of the arts at Queen's University. Richardson Memorial Stadium at Queen's is named in his honour. From 1932 to 1971, The Eastern Canada junior hockey champion won the George Richardson Memorial Trophy, and advanced to the Memorial Cup. Richardson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950, and into the Kingston and District Sports Hall of Fame in 2015."

        "text": "Gordon William \"Doc\" Roberts (September 5, 1891 – September 2, 1966) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who played for the Ottawa Hockey Club and Montreal Wanderers of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Vancouver Millionaires and Seattle Metropolitans of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He was a member of the Ottawa team that defended the Stanley Cup in a 1910 challenge; Roberts scored seven goals in two games in his team's victory over the Edmonton Hockey Club. He moved to Montreal in 1910 where he was consistently among the NHA's leading scorers with the Wanderers while also studying medicine at McGill University.\nWhile in Montreal, Roberts attended McGill University, where he studied to become a physician. Following his graduation, he settled in British Columbia to begin his medical career. Continuing his hockey career, Roberts joined the Vancouver Millionaires where he was named a PCHA all-star at left wing and led the league in scoring with 43 goals in 1916–17. He retired from hockey in 1918 following a season in Seattle before Vancouver lured him back to the game one year later. Roberts left the sport again in 1920 and his medical career ultimately took him to Oakland, California where he practiced for over 40 years. He was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1971.\nPlaying career.\nRoberts participated in several sports in his youth. In addition to hockey, he played lacrosse and football. Roberts focused on hockey, however, and played for several teams in his hometown of Ottawa. He was the leading scorer of the Ottawa City Hockey League in 1908–09 as a member of the Emmitts Hockey Club with 19 goals in six games.\nWhen he turned professional in 1909 by joining the Ottawa Hockey Club, Roberts was one of the youngest players in his league at the age of 18 years. He scored three goals with the team in a single game in the short-lived Canadian Hockey Association before Ottawa jumped to the National Hockey Association (NHA) for the remainder of the season. In nine NHA games, Roberts recorded 13 goals. Ottawa was the defending Stanley Cup champions and, during the season, were challenged for the trophy by the Alberta champion Edmonton Hockey Club in January 1910. The \"Ottawa Citizen\" described Roberts as being the star of the first game. The paper praised his defensive checking in addition to his four goals scored in an 8–4 victory. He added three goals in the second game as Ottawa retained control of the Stanley Cup by a 21–11 aggregate score.\nHaving enrolled at McGill University to study medicine, Roberts moved to Montreal. He continued to play hockey and lacrosse but could not play football as McGill was unable to have him certified as an amateur. Also ineligible to play collegiate hockey, he joined the Montreal Wanderers for the 1910–11 NHA season. Roberts played only four NHA games that year, but thereafter was consistently one of the league's leading scorers. Following a pair of 16-goal seasons, Roberts finished second in league scoring with 31 goals in 1913–14 and with 29 in 1914–15. He was also named a league all-star in 1914.\nRoberts found it difficult to both study and play hockey, but praised the support of his classmates and the faculty in helping him earn his degree. He had to complete an extra year of schooling after failing his second year, but graduated from McGill in 1916. Following an 18-goal season in 1915–16, he left Montreal to take up practice in British Columbia. Roberts continued his hockey career and joined the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He led the PCHA in scoring with 43 goals – in 23 games – and was named a league all-star on left wing. His medical career took him to Seattle and as a result, he joined the Seattle Metropolitans for the 1917–18 PCHA season. He retired in 1918 to focus on his medical career in the Howe Sound region of British Columbia, but was lured back to the PCHA by the Millionaires for the 1919–20 season. He scored 16 goals in 22 games for Vancouver before permanently retiring from hockey.\nPlaying style.\nRoberts was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the greatest left wings in the sport's history. His wrist shot, one of the most fearsome of the pre-1927 era, became the stuff of legend across the country, in both the PCHA and NHA. Amongst the sporting press, he was often said to have had \"the hardest and most deceptive shot in hockey\" during the 1910s.\nRoberts was sometimes described as being the inventor of the \"curved shot\", preceding and outmatching players such as Harry Cameron, Babe Dye and Didier Pitre. Bernie Morris, and Hall of Famers Frank Foyston and Lester Patrick all attested to the unrivalled effectiveness and dramatic trajectory of Roberts’ shot. Clint Benedict, often considered the greatest goalie of the 1893–1926 era also gave praise to Roberts’ accuracy coupled with his ability to curve the puck.\nRoberts was noted for being able to get his shot off at very bad angles from close in, as well as drive it in from far outside the reach and typical positional range of defenceman.\nNotwithstanding his shooting prowess, Roberts was also well regarded for his stamina and skating ability, as well as being an above-average defensive checker. Despite being a physical player, Roberts (like his contemporary Frank Nighbor) was noted for his gentlemanly conduct on the ice – which he may have used to protect himself from retaliation. Montreal Canadiens bench boss George Kennedy told a story of a game against the Montreal Wanderers in which Didier Pitre was being tripped and butt-ended by the rugged Wanderers winger:\n...\"Kennedy screamed at Pitre, ‘Are you afraid of Roberts?’\n'No, sure not,’ was Pitre's surprised response.\n‘Well, why don't you hit him back?’ Kennedy snapped.\n‘How can I hit back?’ Pitre asked. ‘Roberts, he is very polite, very nice. Each time I fall, he helps me get up and apologizes and says it is an accident ... can I hit a man who is apologizing to me? No, never, it is not done...’'\nPersonal life.\nBorn September 5, 1891, and raised in Ottawa, Roberts was the youngest of ten children; he had eight brothers and a sister. His brother Laurie was also a doctor and athlete, while another brother, Eddie, fought and died in the First World War. Roberts returned east in 1922 where he did post-graduate studies in New York. The Ottawa Senators, then of the National Hockey League, attempted to bring him out of retirement again and Cornell University sought his services as a lacrosse coach. Roberts turned down both offers and chose to retain focus on his medical career; He moved to California where he taught for a time at Stanford University Hospital. By 1925, he settled in Oakland where he practiced as an obstetrician for over 40 years. Roberts also acted as a referee at California Hockey League games. Roberts died September 2, 1966, and in 1971 was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame."

        "text": "Nick Brown (born 3 September 1961) is a tennis coach and former professional tennis player from the United Kingdom.\nBrown won the British Under-21 championship in 1980 and the national senior singles championship three years later in 1983. After playing on the ATP tour in the early 1980s, but tiring of his financial situation, he left the tour in 1984 to devote his time to coaching in Belgium and France and then young British players at David Lloyd's club in London, including Tim Henman. Five years later, Brown came out of retirement to play in the Davis Cup.\nBrown caused a sensation at Wimbledon in 1991 when he was granted a wild card. Ranked No. 591 in the world at the time, he faced the 10th seed and previous year's semi-finalist Goran Ivanišević in the second round and beat him in four sets, to the delight of the British crowd. Brown became the first Briton to beat a seeded player at Wimbledon since John Lloyd beat Eliot Teltscher in 1985. Brown was one of only five British players to beat a player inside the top 15 in a slam since 1990 until Daniel Evans at the 2013 US Open. The other four were Jeremy Bates, Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski and Andy Murray. \nBrown eventually lost in the third round to France's Thierry Champion.\nBrown's career-high rankings were world No. 120 in singles and No. 25 in doubles.\nSince permanently retiring from competitive tennis, Brown has served as coach of Britain's Fed Cup team.\nIn 2010, Brown was the Polish Davis Cup and Olympic tennis coach.\nHe is now married to Nadia Macari-Brown and currently Coaching Cambridge University Junior National and International players (Coaching 34 National Champions) \nQualifications and Education \nLTA level 5 Master Performance Tennis Coach\nOlympic and Grand Slam International Tennis Coach\nPan American University, Edinburgh, Texas Scholarship \nCoaching Experience \nGB Fed Cup Captain 1999-2005\nPolish Olympic and Davis Cup Coach (7 years)\nHe has coached many international players including:\nIga Świątek (World Number 1)\nTim Henman \nElena Likhotseva \nAi Sugiyama\nLukasz Kubot (World Number 1 Doubles Player)\nCara Black \nMarcin Matkowski and Mariusz Fyrstenberg (World Number 3)"

        "title": "Kabul Golf Club",
        "text": "The Kabul Golf Club is a nine-hole golf course located near Qargha, around 7 miles from the center of Kabul, Afghanistan.\nOverview.\nThe greens at the Kabul Golf Club are actually brown to black due to their composition of a mixture of sand and oil (which keeps the sand from blowing). Plans for a modern irrigation system are moribund due to lack of funds.\nMainly affluent Afghans and foreigners frequent the course. The 2005 entrance fee for The Kabul Golf Club (http://www.kabulgolfclub.org) is 750 Afghani ($15 US Dollars) and a year membership is $300 (15,000 Afghani). The club is run by Mohammad Afzal Abdul (also called Mohammed Bashir), its director and golf pro, who worked as a caddy at the course as a young man before fleeing into exile in Pakistan. Business has dropped off since opening as international agency staffing has declined.\nHistory.\nOriginally six holes, the course opened in 1967 during the reign of Mohammed Zahir Shah, was closed in 1978, and reopened in 2004. During these three decades it has undergone several changes. It was relocated to its present site in 1973 after the king was overthrown in a coup d'état and completely closed following a 1978 communist coup. It was reopened in 1993 but closed again in 1996 when the Taliban regime banned sports. After the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the course was used as an area for military training in the removal of land mines. In the process of restoration to its present state, three Soviet tanks and a multiple rocket launcher were removed by a nonprofit agency.\nIn 2004 the Kabul Golf Club was reopened again. During the intervening seven years little has changed. Play on the golf course has been sporadic, and at the mercy of the local security situation. Beginning in 2011, a fund-raising effort has been underway with the goal of restoring the golf course and related facilities."

        "title": "High school boys ice hockey in Minnesota",
        "text": "Minnesota boys high school ice hockey is made up of multiple leagues and programs representing different associations. The two organizations associated with high school are the Minnesota State High School League and Minnesota Hockey. The Minnesota State High School League is a voluntary, nonprofit association of public and private schools with a history of service to Minnesota's high school youth since 1916. Minnesota Hockey, an affiliate of USA Hockey, is the governing body of youth and amateur hockey in Minnesota. Minnesota Hockey is governed by a board of directors and consists of approximately 140 community based associations who are formed into 12 districts.\nMinnesota State High School League.\nMinnesota Class AA and A High School Hockey.\nMinnesota Class AA and A High School Hockey programs are members of the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL). The league is made up of Varsity programs that are divided into two classes; AA and A. The classification is determined by enrollment, but schools have the option to both opt up or appeal, if they qualify, down in team sports every two years. Each class is further divided into eight sections. There are currently 144 varsity teams (72 AA and 72 A) competing for the state AA and A championships.\nMinnesota State High School League History.\nHigh school hockey players throughout Minnesota participate in a maximum of 25 contests, excluding the section tournaments and the Minnesota State Boys' High School Hockey Tournament. Teams currently play three 17-minute periods to comprise a game. The lengthened periods were adopted by the Minnesota State High School League in 2003.\nBoys hockey concludes their season with a four-day tournament in March that features sixteen teams competing for championships in both classes. From 1945 through 1991 the tournament consisted of a single class, eight-team tournament instead of the present-day two-class (AA and A) tournament. Private schools were not allowed to play in the Tournament until the 1974–75 season. In 1992–93, the tournament was composed of Tier I and II teams. This two-year experiment sent the top teams from each of the eight sections to the Tier I portion of the tournament and the remaining teams conducted a playoff to determine who would be included in the Tier II tournament. In 1994, the dual-class system was adopted and teams were placed into a class structure based on school enrollments.\nSince 1994, the MSHSL's process to determine section assignments for boys' hockey is based on school enrollments and activity classifications. The basic premise is to place the largest 64 schools into Class AA and the remaining high schools in Class A. Both Classes are then divided into 8 sections each. Teams are placed into their section assignments with geographic location as a primary consideration. High schools initially placed in Class A have the option to play at the Class AA level.\nBeginning with the 2007 state tournament, the top four teams in each class are seeded. Coaches of the participating schools vote to determine the seeded teams the Saturday before the state tournament. The four teams are then bracketed so that if the seeded teams advance, the top seed plays the fourth seed while the second and third seeds play each other. The quarterfinal opponents of the seeded teams are determined by a blind draw.\nDifferences Between Minnesota High School Hockey and USA Hockey-Affiliated High School Hockey.\nUnlike most US high school hockey programs, Minnesota high school hockey is not affiliated with USA Hockey. Minnesota offers various development programs and camps that further refine players' skills and expose them to a high level of coaching expertise.\nMinnesota State High School Hockey Tournament.\nBased on tournament attendance, hockey is the most popular high school sport in the state. Attendance has been strong throughout the years, with 38 tournaments eclipsing the 100,000+ barrier. In 2017 Prep45.com partnered with GrandStadium.TV to stream the state tournament to viewers in 37 countries and all 50 states. The Minnesota State High School Hockey Tournament is currently the largest state sports tournament in terms of viewing and attendance, beating Florida's State High School Football Tournament and Indiana's State High School Basketball Tournament.\nMinnesota Hockey.\nMinnesota Junior Gold High School League.\nSeveral Minnesota high schools field Junior Gold teams in addition to or as an alternative to high school Junior Varsity. There are currently 61 Junior Gold A and B teams throughout Minnesota. The league is governed by Minnesota Hockey and is affiliated with USA Hockey. Minnesota Junior Gold teams are eligible for the Chipotle-USA Hockey National Championships.\nMany Junior Gold players have made their high school team after playing a season or two of Junior Gold, and some Junior Gold players have gone onto play after high school in junior leagues such as the NAHL.\nIndependent Prep, USA 18U Tier 1 &amp; USA 18U AAA.\nMinnesota's independent high school ice hockey teams include Shattuck-St. Mary's (MN) Prep and NorthStar Christian Academy Knights Prep (MN) and the state's AAA teams include Shattuck-St. Mary's (MN) 18U AAA team.\nDevelopment Programs.\nMinnesota has development programs available for high school players looking for an elevated level of competition against top talent from across the state.\nUpper Midwest High School Elite League Hockey.\nThe Upper Midwest High School Elite League Hockey provides players with development and high-level exposure in the months leading up to the high school season. The league consists of seven Minnesota elite teams, including Minnesota Elite (TDS) 18U AAA, Minnesota Elite (Sanford) 18U AAA, Minnesota Elite (MapSouth) 18U AAA, Minnesota Elite (TCOrtho) 18U AAA, Minnesota Elite (SIT) 18U AAA, Minnesota Elite (Kowalskis) 18U AAA, Minnesota Elite (Magazine) 18U AAA, Shattuck-St. Mary's (MN) Prep, Team Wisconsin 18U AAA, and Team North Dakota 18U AAA. These teams participate in a highly competitive schedule, facing off against each other in showcase tournaments and regular-season games. The league provides an excellent platform for players to sharpen their skills, compete against top talent, and gain exposure to college and professional scouts.\n2023 - 24 National High School Hockey Rankings.\nAccording to MYHockey Rankings, Minnetonka High School is the number one ranked high school hockey team in the United States. The site ranked 2,125 high school teams for the 2023-24 season and 17 of the top 20 high school hockey teams are from Minnesota. Nine of the top 10 high school hockey teams are located in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area \nMyHockey Rankings also ranked Shattuck-St. Mary's (MN) Prep team as the top Prep / Independent team in the United States. Northstar Christian Academy (MN) was ranked #4.\nMaxPreps also releases high school ice hockey rankings. However, MaxPreps rankings are very inaccurate and unreliable. This has led to many within the sports community to question the company's algorithm and overall legitimacy. Information for several hundred ice hockey teams is either incomplete, inaccurate, or missing. A number of teams have had incorrect game results and schedules listed, which has led to the algorithm not being able to properly track a team's strength of schedule and quality wins against highly ranked opponents. The fact that the site relies on coaches' participation has only compounded the issue. If coaches from the country's top programs are not correcting or reporting these errors, it leads to further inaccuracies in the rankings. The lack of transparency from MaxPreps regarding their ranking formula has only confirmed the concerns about there being many flaws in their system.\nNotable alumni.\nList of notable alumni:"

        "title": "Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup",
        "text": "The Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup is the premier rugby union competition for secondary schools affiliated to the Leinster Branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), and was first held in 1887.\nAttendances are high for a schoolboy competition, with up to 25000 present at the final. This match traditionally took place on Saint Patrick's Day at Lansdowne Road. In 2008, the final was played at the Royal Dublin Society Grounds (RDS) after Donnybrook proved to be too small for the 2007 final, (Lansdowne Road was closed for redevelopment) and has been the home since. Since the move to the RDS and live television coverage , the attendance has decreased and is now typically 10,000 to 14,000.\nBlackrock College are the most successful school in the cup's history, having won 71 times, more than all other teams combined.\nHistory.\nThree schools have won the cup at their first attempt; Blackrock College in the competition's maiden year in 1887, Castleknock College who won the first of their eight Leinster titles at the first time of asking when they defeated Blackrock in the 1913 final and Clongowes Wood College who first won the cup in 1926. St. Fintan's High School and Temple Carrig School are the most recent 'new' schools to the competition, making their debuts in the 2016/17 and 2019/20 seasons respectively.\nTo date, only six schools have achieved the Senior and Junior Cup \"double\". These are Blackrock, who have achieved this feat 26 times (1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, 1935–36, 1942–43, 1945, 1948, 1953–54, 1956–57, 1962, 1964, 1981–82, 1986–87, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2013–14, 2018), St Michaels twice (2012 &amp; 2019), Newbridge (2020), Belvedere (2005), Terenure (1958) and Castleknock College (1920).\nEven more rare is to lose both the Senior and Junior Cup Finals in the same year. This outcome has been experienced by seven schools on 12 occasions. Terenure College leads with 4 (1957, 1964, 1969 &amp; 1987), followed by Belvedere College with 3 (1930, 1944 &amp; 1962), next St Michaels College (2010), St Mary's College (1943), Newbridge College (1939), Cistercian College Roscrea (1910) and Blackrock College (2017) with 1 each. It happened to Blackrock College for the first time in 2017.\nBlackrock College have only been defeated in successive finals on two occasions. In the 1920s they were runners up three times in a row, defeated by St Andrews in 1921 &amp; 1922 followed by Belvedere in 1923. The second occasion was in 1979 &amp; 1980 when they were defeated in successive finals by Terenure College.\nThe 91st Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final in 1977 was between Blackrock College and St Mary's College, and finished level at 12 points each at the end of normal time. Having played 70 minutes, the two sides now faced an additional 15 minutes extra time. Six minutes into extra time Blackrock got a try and conversion. Two further penalties in the second half of extra time sealed victory for Blackrock. The 1977 Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final was played on Sunday 20 March 1977 and not the normal St Patrick's Day. This decision was made to protect the Lansdowne Road pitch following poor weather prior to the Ireland v France Five Nations fixture on 19 March.\nIn September 1967, the then Minister for Education Donogh O'Malley introduced free secondary school education. Only very few rugby playing secondary schools opted to join the \"Free Education\" scheme. To date, only one of these non-fee paying schools has managed to win the Senior Cup. In 1983 and 1985, De La Salle Churchtown beat Castleknock College and Blackrock College.\nFour captains have gained the distinction of lifting the cup twice, Larry McMahon (Blackrock College, 1929 and 1930), Garret Gill (Blackrock College, 1962 and 1963), Jonny Mion (Blackrock College) in 1989 and 1990, Barry Gibney (Blackrock College) in 1995 and 1996.\nThe cup, and the schools who play for it, have a history of producing rugby players who have gone on to play for the Ireland national rugby union team. Players such as Denis Hickie, who captained his St. Mary's College team to win the cup in 1994, and Gordon D'Arcy have extensive Leinster Senior Cup records. The most international players produced have come from Blackrock College, with players such as Hugo MacNeill, Brendan Mullin, Brian O'Driscoll, Victor Costello, Shane Byrne, Bob Casey, Leo Cullen, Luke Fitzgerald, Ian Madigan, Jordi Murphy, Garry Ringrose and Joey Carbery.\nThe 2020 season could not be completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result the title was deemed shared for the first time by Clongowes Wood College and Newbridge College. It was also only the forth time that no Dublin based school qualified for the final, 1932 (Pres Bray V Newbridge), 1941 (Newbridge V Roscrea), 2011 (Clongowes V Roscrea).\nThe 2021 cup campaign did not take place due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2023 first round tie between Terenure College and Clongowes Wood College, Clongowes won 17-15 in a very tight game. However it emerged afterwards that Clongowes fielded an illegible player and the Schools committee ordered a replay. Clongowes also won the replay 20-19 with Terenure hitting the posts with a last minute penalty attempt.\nRoll of honour.\n1 Corrig School moved premises to Monkstown Park in 1950 and was renamed C.B.C. Monkstown.&lt;br&gt;\n2 Mountjoy School was amalgamated with other schools in 1972 to become Mount Temple Comprehensive School.&lt;br&gt;\n3 SCT Final not played due to Covid 19. Cup shared.&lt;br&gt;\n4 Rathmines school closed in 1899.&lt;br&gt;\nSponsorship and media coverage.\nThe competition was known for several years as the \"Coca-Cola Leinster Schools Senior Cup\" and in later years the \"Powerade Leinster Schools Senior Cup\" (Powerade is also owned by the Coca-Cola Company). In September 2013, Beauchamps Solicitors became the title sponsor for the Leinster Schools Senior Cup. For the duration of this partnership with Beauchamps, the Senior Cup was known as the \"Beauchamps Leinster Schools Senior Cup\".\nThe competition receives coverage in Ireland's broadsheets, in particular the \"Irish Independent\" and \"The Irish Times\". Both publish previews of each year's competition and provide match reports for each game played.\nThe competition's final on St Patrick's Day was previously broadcast on TG4, however, this was discontinued in the early 2000s. From 2005 onwards, however, Setanta Sports began coverage of school's rugby. This included the finals of all provincial finals and coverage of the Leinster Schools Junior Cup. The Leinster Senior Cup was most prominent, however, with coverage from every game played at Donnybrook and every round of the competition.\nFreeSports replaced Eir Sport as the competition broadcaster ahead of the 2019 competition where they will broadcast eight games live.\nLeinster School of the Year Award.\nIn 2008, Leinster Rugby instituted an award for overall performance of a school at every level of schools rugby. The award, \"Powerade Leinster Rugby School of the Year\", has been given at an annual Leinster awards ceremony.\nThe inaugural winners were C.B.C. Monkstown. They were followed in by Terenure College (2009), St Gerard's School (2010), Clongowes Wood College (2011), St. Michael's College (2012), (2019) and Blackrock College (2013), (2018). Gonzaga College (2017)\nTiers.\nSchools Senior Cup Rugby in Leinster is divided into 4 tiers in two sections, and each cup competition bears a name. These 'tiers', in ascending order, include: Section A Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup (effectively division 4), Section A Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup (effectively division 3), Section B Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup (effectively division 2), Section B Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup (effectively division 1).\nThe second tier competition, the Leinster School's Vinnie Murray Cup, is contested by secondary schools affiliated to the Leinster Branch of the IRFU. It is named in memory of Vincent Murray, a teacher in Clongowes Wood college who trained the rugby team and died in December 1999. Catholic University School were both 2022 and 2023 champions and St. Fintan's High School won the cup in 2024. With five wins, C.B.C. Monkstown has won the Vinnie Murray Cup the most times. Wesley College the second most with four wins. Catholic University School the third most with three wins. Gonzaga College, and St Gerard's School have won the trophy twice. Kilkenny College, Temple Carrig School and St. Fintan's High School have each won the cup once."

        "text": "Hamilton Livingstone \"Billy\" Gilmour (March 21, 1885 – March 13, 1959) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. A winger, Gilmour played for the Ottawa Hockey Club in the Canadian Amateur Hockey League. Two of his brothers, Suddy Gilmour and Dave Gilmour, also played with Ottawa. He was a member of five Ottawa Stanley Cup championship teams in 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906 and 1909. He also played competitively for the McGill Redmen and Montreal Victorias. He retired from competitive ice hockey in 1909, but returned to play two games for Ottawa in the 1915–16 season.\nPlaying career.\nAt 15, Gilmour played for the Ottawa Aberdeens in the Canadian Amateur Hockey League intermediate division. He played two seasons with the club and joined the Ottawa Hockey Club for the 1903 season, where he played with his brothers Suddy and Dave. He scored seven goals in six games and was a member of the Stanley Cup championship team that was nicknamed the \"Silver Seven\", after the silver nuggets the players were given after the Stanley Cup win by team manager Robert Taylor Shillington, who was a part-owner of a silver mine.\nLater in 1903, Gilmour moved to Montreal to attend McGill University, where he played college hockey, and joined Ottawa for some Stanley Cup challenge games, in the 1904 and 1905 seasons and a league game in 1906. After finishing McGill in 1907, Gilmour played one season with the Montreal Victorias, scoring five goals in ten games. He returned to Ottawa to join the now-professional Ottawa Hockey Club for the 1908-09 season, scoring nine goals in eleven games as Ottawa won the league and another Stanley Cup championship. In 1909, Gilmour moved to Montreal, married and stopped playing competitive hockey. Gilmour did play some exhibition games for the Ottawa New Edinburghs in 1911, and played two games with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey Association (NHA) in 1916.\nGilmour was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963.\nPersonal.\nBorn in 1885 in Ottawa, Gilmour was one of four sons of five children born to Mr. and Mrs. John Gilmour. The other children were Dave, Sutherland (Suddy), Ward and his sister Gilbert. The family business was lumber, and Gilmour's father was a partner in Gilmour and Highson Lumber. While playing ice hockey for Ottawa, Gilmour was studying engineering at McGill University of Montreal, and later worked as an engineer. At the start of the First World War Gilmour enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 1st Construction Battalion. He returned to Canada in 1919.\nGilmour married Merle Woods of Montreal and moved to Paris, France before returning to Canada in 1942 to reside in Mount Royal, Quebec, where he lived for the rest of his life.\nGilmour is buried at Beechwood Cemetery in Ottawa."

His parents are Georgina Hamilton and Russel Stevens, and. has 1 brother, Greg Stevens, as well as 2 half-sisters, Claire Roode and Sarah Stevens. He was educated at Kearsney Collegeand was very involved at school, including their very successful choir. He played his youth rugby in South Africa. He earned representative honours for Western Province, South African Universities and the Junior Springboks at Under 18 and Under 19 level, before deciding to move to England to pursue his university studies.\nRugby career.\nAt Bath University, he soon came to the attention of the local club and made his first appearances at the end of the 2002–03 season.\nHe went on to represent England Under-21s at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, held in Oxfordshire, impressing the first team coaches and winning a place on the summer tour to New Zealand and Australia. He made his first Test appearance as a replacement against the All Blacks before helping Bath to the top of the Premiership table in the 2003–04 season. Stevens was known for popping up in the back line during matches for Bath, and has quite a turn of pace for a front-rower.\nHe made his Six Nations debut in 2005 and a series of eye-catching displays led to his selection for the 2005 Lions tour to New Zealand. He played in six games for the unbeaten midweek team, but was unable to force his way into the Test side.\nA shoulder injury during the 2006 Six Nations would rule Stevens out for over a year, with his next international action coming in the second test of England's summer tour of South Africa in 2007. Stevens was then included in the England squad for the 2007 World Cup, starting three pool games and featuring in all others as a replacement – appearing in the final as a replacement for captain Phil Vickery.\nHe devoted much of his time out of the game to a coffee shop, Jika Jika, with friend and Bath team-mate Lee Mears.

Stevens confirmed in January 2010 that he would join Saracens and duly linked up with the English Premiership club at the start of 2011.\nHe made his debut for Saracens and went on to a central role as the Watford-based club claimed their first Premiership title with victory over Leicester in the final at Twickenham in May 2011. Two days later Stevens was recalled to the England setup with a place in the England Saxons squad for the Churchill Cup and the promise of a shot at securing a spot in Martin Johnson's Rugby World Cup squad.\nStevens finally made his return to the senior England side as he started England's first World Cup warm-up match against Wales at Twickenham, and he did enough to secure a place on the plane to New Zealand. Following an injury to first-choice loose-head Andrew Sheridan, Stevens took the No.1 jersey.\nStevens kept his place in the England set-up under Stuart Lancaster's leadership and played in all five of their matches during the 2012 Six Nations.\nIn the summer of 2012 Stevens opted to retire from Test rugby to spend more time with his young family. Even so, impressive performances for Saracens and the ability to play on both the tight and loose-head side of the scrums meant that he was a surprise inclusion in Warren Gatland's Lions squad for the tour to Australia, despite not having played international rugby for over a year.\nIn February 2014, it was revealed that Stevens would return to South Africa after the conclusion of the 2013–14 English Premiership season to join the in August of that year on a two-year deal.\nOn 18 June 2015, Stevens made his move to France to join with European champions Toulon in the Top 14 from the 2015–2016 season.

From 2017 – 2020 Stevens was the General Manager at one of South Africa's oldest and most beloved wine estates Boschendal. During his time at Boschendal, he created some of the estate's most popular attractions including The Tree House and the Friday Night Market as well as steering its flagship restaurant The Werf into South Africa's Top 20 Restaurants and winning the Eat Out Sustainability Award in 2018.\nFollowing the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Stevens left his position at Boschendal to pursue new property development projects in Cape Town and the wider Western Cape areas.

        "title": "American Basketball Association (2000–present)",
        "text": "The American Basketball Association (ABA) is an American semi-professional men's basketball minor league that was founded in 1999.\nABA teams are based in the United States, with one traveling team from Japan. The league previously had international teams based in Canada, China and Mexico. League management infamously maintains low requirements for franchise ownership, and hundreds of ABA teams have either folded or defected to rival leagues.\nThe league licenses its name and use of ABA trademarks from the National Basketball Association, which absorbed the American Basketball Association (1967–1976) during the ABA–NBA merger. The Women's American Basketball Association has operated as a sister league to the ABA since 2017.\nHistory.\nLaunch and suspension, 1999–2002.\nThe league was originally co-founded by Dick Tinkham and Joe Newman in 1999 as ABA 2000. Tinkham had previously co-founded the Indiana Pacers in the original American Basketball Association, and Newman had been an advertising executive for the Pacers. The National Basketball Association (NBA), owner of the ABA trademark after absorbing many of the original league's teams, sued Tinkham and Newman in December 1999. The lawsuit was unsuccessful since the NBA had failed to actively use the ABA trademark, and the new league entered an agreement with the NBA to license the name for $50,000.\nThe league began its inaugural 2000–01 season with eight teams: the Chicago Skyliners, Detroit Dogs, Indiana Legends, Kansas City Knights, Los Angeles Stars, Memphis Houn'Dawgs, San Diego Wildfire and Tampa Bay ThunderDawgs. Joe Newman founded the Indiana Legends to replace the Jacksonville Jackals, who were removed from the league after failing to secure a venue. Mark Hamister purchased the rights to a Buffalo franchise for $75,000, but was also unable to secure a venue. A proposed merger with the International Basketball League fell through in December 2000, which would have allowed the inaugural season to begin with additional teams.\nTo attract fans, the ABA encouraged its teams to fill rosters with former NBA players and past college basketball stars that had local ties. Former NBA champion and Florida native Darryl Dawkins was recruited as the first head coach of the Tampa Bay ThunderDawgs.\nThe 2001–02 ABA season saw only three teams return from the inaugural season, with the Chicago Skyliners, Los Angeles Stars, Memphis Houn'Dawgs, San Diego Wildfire and Tampa Bay ThunderDawgs replaced by the Kentucky Pro Cats, Las Vegas Slam, Phoenix Eclipse and Southern California Surf.\nJoe Newman folded the Indiana Legends after he was sued by eight former players in August 2002 for failing to pay their salaries. Newman had claimed $1 million in losses over two seasons of ownership.\nThe 2002–03 season was not played, as the league suspended operations for reorganization. Jim Clark, owner of the Kansas City Knights, was named league President and COO in November 2002.\nRestructuring and defections, 2003–2005.\nThe league resumed play with seven teams for the 2003–04 season. The returning Kansas City Knights were joined by the Fresno Heatwave, Jersey Squires, Las Vegas Rattlers, Juárez Gallos de Pelea, Long Beach Jam and Tijuana Dragons. Dennis Rodman brought national attention to the league when he signed with the Long Beach Jam, leading them to an ABA title in their first season.\nThe 2004–05 season saw franchise fees lowered from $50,000 to $10,000, and the bond requirement removed in order to attract new teams. Teams were subsequently organized into regional groups to facilitate interest and reduce travel costs, with 37 clubs competing that season in three divisions. The Arkansas RimRockers won the 2004–05 ABA title in their first year of play, but then left with the Long Beach Jam to join the rival NBA Development League.\nThe ABA welcomed the Beijing Aoshen Olympians beginning with the 2005–06 season, a club which had been banned from the Chinese Basketball League after refusing to allow star prospect Sun Yue to play for the Chinese national team. The Olympians played their home games in Maywood, California. CCTV-5 in China broadcast the team's games, where they were watched by an average of 15 million people.\nFollowing the 2005–06 season in which many teams failed to complete their full schedules and became insolvent, the Charlotte Krunk, Florida Pit Bulls, Indiana Alley Cats, Pittsburgh Xplosion, San Jose Skyrockets and SoCal Legends left to join the rival Continental Basketball Association.\nFailed coup and formation of PBL, 2006–2008.\nIn preparation for the league's initial public offering (ABKB), former NBA player John Salley was named league commissioner and Maryland Nighthawks owner Tom Doyle was named league COO in September 2006. Cost for new franchises was subsequently raised to $20,000 for the 2006–07 season. \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Alexander Wolff launched the Vermont Frost Heaves, regularly penning articles in the publication about his team's inaugural campaign.\nJohn Salley and Tom Doyle attempted a boardroom coup on behalf of shareholders, with ABA's Board of Directors voting to remove Joe Newman as CEO on January 31, 2007. Newman sued Salley and Doyle, leading to a settlement in which he kept his job and forced their resignations from the league.\nThe 2006–07 season concluded with the defending champion Rochester Razorsharks withdrawing from the league after they asked to reschedule a playoff game against the Wilmington Sea Dawgs, but were denied and told to forfeit. Following this incident, the Hammond Rollers, Jacksonville Jam, Maryland Nighthawks, Quad City Riverhawks and Wilmington Sea Dawgs joined the Razorsharks in forming the Premier Basketball League (PBL).\nFollowing the 2007–08 season, the reigning champion Vermont Frost Heaves left for the Premier Basketball League along with the Halifax Rainmen, Manchester Millrats and Quebec Kebs.\nQuentin Townsend, owner of the Atlanta Vision, was named league President and COO in April 2008. He was later removed from those positions after being arrested in November 2008 for defrauding investors in a scheme to acquire an NBA Development League franchise.\nCBA absorption and continued instability, 2008–2013.\nAt the start of the 2008–09 season, over 200 teams had folded since the league's inception.\nThe 2008–09 season saw the Southeast Texas Mustangs franchise join the league after leaving the struggling Continental Basketball Association. The ABA attempted interleague play with the four remaining CBA teams, but their league folded mid-season.\nNBA scouts stopped attending the league's games in January 2009, citing the amount of cancelled and forfeited contests.\nSeveral teams folded during the 2009–10 season, including the entire Pacific Northwest Division. The San Francisco Rumble forfeited their playoff game against the Southeast Texas Mavericks, as they could not afford to travel for the contest.\nGilas Pilipinas, the Philippine national basketball team, competed in a series of exhibitions against ABA teams including the Clayton Showtime, Los Angeles Slam, Riverside Rainmakers, San Diego Surf and the West Coast All-Stars. This April 2010 series was referred to as the ABA Friendship Games.\nDick Packer was named league President and COO in April 2010.\nAfter winning their second consecutive championship in 2010–11, the Southeast Texas Mavericks publicly opined that the ABA did not have adequate competition, and they left with intentions of joining the NBA Development League. However, their application to join the NBA Development League was denied, and the franchise sat out the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons. Consecutive titles were won by the Jacksonville Giants in their absence, with championship wins over the previously undefeated South Carolina Warriors in 2011–12 and North Dallas Vandals in 2012–13. The team returned to the ABA for 2013–14 as the Shreveport-Bossier Mavericks, going undefeated and winning the league title in a perfect season.\nManagement change and ESPN3 deal, 2014–2016.\nAt the conclusion of the 2013–14 season, over 350 franchises had folded since the league's inception.\nFormer Arizona Scorpions owner Ron Tilley replaced Joe Newman as league President and CEO following Newman's retirement in July 2014.\nThe league signed a two-year streaming deal with ESPN3 in August 2014 to broadcast regular season and playoff games beginning with the 2014–15 season.\nAfter completing a perfect season for the second time in 2014–15 and winning their fourth championship, the Shreveport-Bossier Mavericks left the ABA to join the Premier Basketball League.\nJoe Newman returned to the role of league President and CEO beginning with the 2015–16 season.\nThe Jacksonville Giants drew the league's all-time record crowd of 8,987 for their 100–93 victory over the previously unbeaten Chicago Steam at Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena on January 16, 2016. It had been reported the week prior that the Orlando Magic was considering adopting the Giants as their NBA Development League affiliate, although later in the year they instead moved their existing affiliate Erie BayHawks to Lakeland, Florida.\nWABA launch and addition of play-in tournament, 2017–present.\nA sister league, the Women's American Basketball Association (WABA), was launched in 2017. Garden State Warriors owner Marsha Blount was named the league's President and CEO.\nThe 2017–18 season saw franchise fees lowered to $2,500.\nLeague co-founder Dick Tinkham died of muscular dystrophy in October 2018.\nThe 2019–20 season was ended prematurely and the playoffs cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe undefeated Jacksonville Giants captured their seventh and final championship in 2020–21, concluding the team's first perfect season and third in ABA history. \nA play-in tournament was implemented beginning with the 2021–22 season to determine which teams would advance to the divisional round of the playoffs. \nFollowing elimination from the 2021–22 playoffs by the Steel City Yellow Jackets, the Jacksonville Giants ceased operations. The Steel City Yellow Jackets suspended operations after their elimination from the 2022–23 playoffs by the Burning River Buckets.\nThe Burning River Buckets and Indiana Lyons were declared co-champions of the 2022–23 season after storm damage rendered the venue for their championship game unplayable.\nRule changes.\nThe league employs a number of unconventional rules that are unique to the league:\nTeams.\n109 teams completed at least one game during the 2023–24 season.\nThe league's oldest surviving franchises are the Garden State Warriors (est. 2005), Georgia Gwizzlies (est. 2007), and Oceanside Surf (est. 2009).\nDefunct.\nFranchises that left the ABA but still compete elsewhere include the Detroit Panthers (Maximum Basketball League), Kitsap Admirals (Independent), Motor City Cruise (NBA G League), Newfoundland Rogues (Basketball Super League), and Shreveport Mavericks (The Basketball League).\nNotable alumni.\nPlayers.\nUSA:\nAsia:\nAfrica:\nAmericas:\nCanada\nEurope:\nOceania:\nCoaches.\nUSA:\nAsia:\nAmericas:"

Players take control one of several characters, each with their own unique caddy. The series is noted for its crude humor, particularly in regard to the characters, most of whom fall under an exaggerated archetype. These include a stripper, a hippie, a biker, and more. Unique to the series is the Composure Meter. As players do well, the player character's composure meter increases. The maximum distance rating for each club increases or decreases in relation to the player character's composure. This is designed to simulate frustration: the more shots missed, the more frustrated the player character gets and the worse they perform. In order to counteract this, the player character can beat or humiliate their caddy in some way, which raises the composure meter. Hitting a perfect shot results in the ball bursting into flames as it travels; the flames extinguishing when the turn is over. \"Outlaw Golf 2\" includes new courses and additional golfers and caddies.\nActor and comedian Steve Carell provides the commentator track for the original \"Outlaw Golf\", and comedian Dave Attell takes over announcing duties in \"Outlaw Golf 2\".\nReception.\n\"Outlaw Golf\".\nThe GameCube and Xbox versions of \"Outlaw Golf\" received \"average\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\"Outlaw Golf 2\".\nThe sequel received \"mixed or average reviews\" on both platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic."
