        "text": "Burghfield Sailing Club (Burghfield SC or BSC) is an inland sailing club located close to the town of Theale in Berkshire near Reading in the south of England. The club and lake are easily seen from the M4 motorway as the westbound lane approaches Junction 12. BSC was one of the first Clubs in the UK to be awarded RYA Champion Club status.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1956 as the AWRE SC (Atomic Weapons Research Establishment Sailing Club). The club was principally a sea cruising group with a few dinghy sailors. Having few dinghies and no sailing water, a deal was struck with Pangbourne College, so that members were able to sail in Pangbourne's Firefly dinghies on the Thames.\nIn 1957 the club became recognised by the RYA and established itself on a small lake in the hamlet of Pingewood in the parish of Burghfield.\nDuring the infamous winter of 1963 ice yachting took place and later in the year, Peter Hemment became the club's first National Champion winning in the Zenith class.\nDuring the mid – late 1960s inter club team racing became very popular with as many as 9 matches, home and away, being held a year.\nIn 1969 the club became one of the first in the country to hold a personal handicap regatta, the Cock o' Burghfield, with sponsorship being provided by the local Courage Brewery.\nIn 1972 the club became independent of the AWRE and became Burghfield Lake Sailing Club.\nIn March 1977 the club moved to the nearby, and very much larger, Theale Lagoon. The club subsequently dropped 'Lake' from its name. The name Burghfield is pronounced 'Bur Field'.\nThe club continued to thrive for many decades as one of the Thames Valley's leading clubs.\nIn 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the club invested in a new balcony and canopy which gives an extension to the indoor space with a fantastic view over the lake. You can typically expect to see 50 plus boats racing on a Sunday morning!\nSailing.\nBSC provides extensive racing across a range of dinghy classes. Classes include Lasers, RS400s, RS200s, RS Aero's, Solos, Blazes. Racing is held every weekend of the year on Sundays and Wednesday evenings during the summer. The Burghfield Icicle is held on Boxing Day. The club hosts many local, regional and national open events throughout the year.\nThere is a successful Oppie Club which trains youngsters to sail and race Optimists and a strong junior Topper fleet. Burghfield has an enviable record in developing junior and youth talent with sailors established in the various RYA squads and competing at the top level of junior and youth sailing.\nThursday evenings the Sailability group provides sailing for the club's disabled members.\nFor members not wishing to compete in the club racing there is the Saturday Admiral's Club providing social sailing.\nDuring the week when there are no organised sailing events the club is popular with windsurfers and Paddleboarders.\nSailing successes.\nMembers have been extremely successful nationally and internationally. In 1963 Peter Hemment became our first National Champion winning in the Zenith class. Crispin Read-Wilson won the Fireball World Championship in 1979 in the Netherlands. Ian and Chris Martin, have won the International 420 National Championships, the 29er National and European Championships and are currently campaigning a 49er on the Olympic Classes World Circuit.\nIan and Chris's cousin Alison Martin has also won championships in Optimists and 420s, including Bronze Medal at the World ISAF Youth Championships. Ally is currently campaigning as part of the GBR Match Race Girls team in the new Olympic Discipline of Women's Match Racing.\nMike Lyons who worked with Topper International in the development of the Blaze dinghy has won the class National Championships on many occasions. Andrew Leigh has won the Phantom National Championships. Graham Camm and Zoë Ballantine have won many National 12 National Championships. Steve Tylecote has won the Firefly National Championships and also skippered the World Team Racing Championships winning team.\nBurnham's Royal Corinthian Yacht Club hosts the Endeavour Trophy annually. This is a unique and historic dinghy event which is always hotly contested with entrants limited to reigning National Champions of the classes sailed in the UK, the winners are crowned 'Champion of Champions'. Burghfield members have twice won this event. Nick and Caroline Martin and in 2007, Steve Tylecote.\nAndrew Simpson Watersports.\nAndrew Simpson Watersports our Burghfield Sailing Club's training provider. They offer training to members, schools and\nyouth groups. They also provide training to members of the public. Their activities are dinghy \nsailing, windsurfing, stand up paddleboarding, improvised raft building and powerboating. Courses start for those 8 years upwards."

Mitchell's (D–ME) 20-month investigation into performance-enhancing drug use in Major League Baseball (MLB) released on December 13, 2007.Inclusion on the list does not necessarily mean the player was involved in illegal activity. In some instances, insufficient evidence was provided to draw a conclusion, and some players were mentioned in other contexts.\nThe Mitchell Report also stated that interviews were requested of five MLB players who had spoken out publicly on the steroid issue. Of these players, only one, Frank Thomas, was willing to be interviewed. The Mitchell Report stated that there was no evidence that any of these five had used performance-enhancing drugs. Curt Schilling, one of the four players who declined to interview with Mitchell, explained that he denied Mitchell's request because he \"would have nothing to offer\" Mitchell's investigation \"other than personal opinion and hypotheticals.\"\nJason Giambi was required to interview with Mitchell and his investigators by Commissioner Bud Selig under threat of discipline. This stemmed from Giambi's ongoing involvement with the BALCO investigation and statements he had given to the media.\nImplicated in the BALCO Scandal (9).\nMajor League players that were active at the time of the report are listed in bold italics.\nIdentified as clients of Kirk Radomski (53).\nMajor League players that were active at the time of the report are listed in bold italics. If a player responded to allegations after the release of the report, their response appears in the last column, \"Post-report player response\".\nMentioned in connection to Signature Pharmacy (16).\nEight current major league players and eight former major league players were mentioned in the media as purchasers of performance-enhancing drugs from Signature Pharmacy and several rejuvenation centers. Several online pharmacies (Signature Pharmacy being one of them), anti-aging clinics and doctors that have issued prescriptions for performance-enhancing drugs have been under investigation by federal and state authorities. Mitchell requested the 16 players interview with him, but only José Canseco accepted his offer.\nMajor League players that were active at the time of the report are listed in bold italics."

Grass surfers take the trucks off an old skateboard and find a mildly steep hill made up of dry grass, sand, moss, dirt or other surface that could be used to gain speed and control.\nIt is similar to grassboarding, a boarding sport born in the early 90s in Costa Rica.\nRisks.\nBecause this is done downhill on dry grass, dirt, etc. there is a significant lack of control.\nA potential risk is of hitting a buried rock. This could cause the board to come to a sudden deceleration, causing the surfer to fall off the board, possibly resulting in injury.\nParts.\nMost boards are just skateboard decks that are modified by taking the trucks and hardware off and in some cases covering the bottom in duct tape or polyurethane.\nIn other cases, actual surf boards have been used with varying results on steeper smooth surfaces such as sand. The pointed uncurved tip of these boards usually results in a leaping stop when the tip embeds itself at the base of the incline, and progression down the incline requires frequent shimmying.\nMethods.\nThe most popular method in grass surfing is to find an old skateboard deck and remove the trucks and other hardware. Next find a mildly steep hill of dry grass, gravel, dirt, sand, etc. While standing on the skateboard deck in a crouched position at the top of the hill, push yourself and gain speed, gradually assuming a more natural standing position.\nModifications.\nSome people cover the bottom of the boards in a sealant (usually polyurethane), while some may add furniture wax to the bottom of the board (such as the brand \"Pledge\", or something similar). Also, some people build homemade boards out of used items such as sleds, cardboard, etc."

Rookie of the Year was Patrick Carpentier. Mercedes-Benz won their first and only CART engine-manufacturer's title.\nAfter a settlement with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, CART relinquished its license of the \"IndyCar\" trademark for 1997 and beyond. As a result, the series was renamed for the first time since 1980. The \"CART\" term, which had been mostly eschewed since 1992, was brought back and embraced, a new logo was unveiled, and participants were encouraged to refer to the machines of the CART series as \"Champ Cars\". The revival of the historic term (and curtailing the use of the mostly generic term \"Indy cars\") helped to differentiate the machines from those of the rival Indy Racing League, and was part of a concerted and necessary effort to distance the series from the Indianapolis 500, to which it no longer had any link. This was also the last year of title sponsorship by PPG Industries, although the Driver's Championship continued to be known as the PPG Cup until 1999.

        "text": "William Curtis Carr III (November 29, 1945 – February 3, 2024) was an American college football player, coach, and athletics administrator. Carr was born in Gainesville, Florida, raised in Pensacola, Florida, and attended the University of Florida, where he was an All-American center for the Florida Gators football team in the mid-1960s. He was selected in the 4th round of the 1967 NFL/AFL Draft but first had to serve two years in the United States Army, after which he did not make a regular season NFL roster. Carr returned to UF as graduate assistant and assistant coach under head coach Doug Dickey in 1972 and, after earning his master's degree, joined the school's athletic administration in 1975. He became Florida's athletic director in 1979 at the age of 33, making him the youngest athletic director at a major university at the time. As head of UF's Athletic Association, Carr oversaw the construction of the Stephen C. O'Connell Center and a major addition to Florida Field while also presiding over major NCAA rules violations in the football program.\nCarr resigned in 1986 and went into private business for several years before serving as the athletic director at the University of Houston from 1993 until 1997, when he retired and established a college sports consulting firm. Carr died on February 3, 2024, at the age of 78.\nEarly life.\nCarr was born in Gainesville, Florida, the son of a Baptist minister. He grew up in Vero Beach and Pensacola, Florida. Carr attended Pensacola High School, and was a standout high school football player for the Pensacola Tigers. Following his senior season, he was recognized as a first-team all-state selection.\nCollege years.\nCarr accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, where he was the center for coach Ray Graves' Florida Gators football team from 1964 to 1966. Carr was a teammate and roommate of the Gators' Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Steve Spurrier for several years, and the two remained friends until Carr's death. Carr served as a team captain during his senior year and was named a first-team All-Southeastern Conference selection and a first-team All-American after the season. Carr concluded his college playing career in the 1967 Orange Bowl, which the Gators earned a 27–12 victory over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.\nCarr graduated from Florida with a bachelor's degree in Spanish in 1968, and was later inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great.\"\nProfessional football and military service.\nThe New Orleans Saints selected Carr in the fourth round (106th pick overall) of the 1967 NFL Draft. Carr signed with the Saints in , but had to fulfill his military service obligation before he could play. He served two years in the U.S. Army, mainly in South Korea, and upon returning to the Saints, he was released during the final roster cuts before the 1970 season.\nCoach, athletic director and consultant.\nCarr retired as a player and returned to the University of Florida in 1970 to serve as a football graduate assistant under head coach Doug Dickey while earning master's degrees in education and sports administration. After serving as a graduate assistant, assistant junior varsity coach, and academic advisor for parts of three academic years, he concluded that his \"heart wasn't in coaching\" and joined the UF athletic department's administrative staff as an assistant to athletic director Ray Graves in 1974. Carr was promoted to the position of assistant athletic director in 1976, and when Graves retired in 1979, Carr was promoted to replace him, making him the youngest Division I athletic director in the country at the time.\nWhile leading the University of Florida Athletic Association, Carr was credited with improving the athletic department's financial footing and sports facilities (including a major expansion of Florida Field and the construction of the O'Connell Center), setting the stage for future success and helping make possible the Gators' first conference football championship in 1984. However, he also oversaw a scandal which saw that football championship vacated for recruiting and other NCAA violations under head coach Charlie Pell. Carr resigned in 1986 and was succeeded by Bill Arnsparger.\nAfter leaving Florida, Carr served as the executive director of a youth advocacy group and a vice-president at Raycom Sports before returning to sports administration as the athletic director at the University of Houston from 1993 to 1997. After leaving Houston, Carr founded and led an intercollegiate athletics consulting group for several years before semi-retiring to serve as an executive coach in 2020."

The second-ranked and undefeated Michigan Wolverines of the Big Nine Conference routed the #8 USC Trojans, champions of the Pacific Coast Conference, 49–0.\nIt was the second year of the initial five-year agreement between the conferences to match their champions each New Year's Day in Pasadena. Michigan halfback Bob Chappuis was named the Player of the Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively.\nMichigan tied the record for the most points scored by a team in the Rose Bowl, first set by the 1901 Wolverines in the first Rose Bowl and later matched by USC in 2008. Oregon supplanted the record in 2015. Michigan also tied the game's record for largest margin of victory also set by the 1901 Michigan team that defeated Stanford by an identical 49–0 score. The record of seven PATs converted by Michigan kicker Jim Brieske remains unbroken, but was tied in 2008 by USC's David Buehler.\nThe game was aired by local station KTLA in the first telecast of a bowl game in the Greater Los Angeles Area. It was also the first time a U.S. motion picture newsreel was taken in color. In a special unofficial AP Poll five days after the game, Michigan replaced Notre Dame as the 1947 national champion by a vote of 226 to 119.\nTeams.\nUSC Trojans.\nIn October, USC tied Rice 7–7 and defeated #4 California 39–14 in Berkeley. The Trojans' rivalry matchup with defending PCC champion UCLA saw USC win 6–0. The game against Notre Dame had 104,953 on hand, the highest attendance for a football game in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, to see 7–0–1 Rose Bowl-bound USC fall to the 8–0 Fighting Irish, 38–7. USC dropped from third to eighth in the final AP Poll in early December, and Notre Dame did not play in a bowl.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nThe 1947 Wolverines, known as the \"Mad Magicians,\" won the Big Nine title on the strength of strong offense and defense. They shut out four opponents, including Ohio State, 21–0. Their close game was a 14–7 win at #11 Illinois, the reigning Big Nine and Rose Bowl champion.\nGame summary.\nBob Chappuis and Bump Elliott were the stars for the Wolverines. Jack Weisenburger scored three touchdowns. Nine Rose Bowl records were set.\nAftermath.\nThe final regular season AP Poll, taken before the bowls, had Notre Dame #1 (107 first place votes) and Michigan #2 (25 first place votes). Notre Dame did not play in a bowl game. After urging from \"Detroit Free Press\" sports editor Lyall Smith, the Associated Press conducted its first ever post-bowl poll; Michigan won that unofficial final poll, 266–119.\nThe Wolverines continued their winning streak through the next season, winning all nine games. Because of the no-repeat rule for the Rose Bowl, runner-up Northwestern represented the Big Nine in the 1949 Rose Bowl. Michigan's 1,788 passing yards in 1947 was a school record that stood for 32 years, until 1979.\nLegacy.\nIn Super Bowl LIV, the Kansas City Chiefs offense lined up for a 4th &amp; 1 conversion attempt during the first quarter. The offense attempted a running back direct snap, converting the run for a first down. After the game, Chiefs' offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy told the media he discovered the trick play from watching Michigan run the play on the goal line in the 1948 Rose Bowl, adding it to the team's repertoire. Kansas City went on to win the game. The play was even named shift right to Rose Bowl parade."

        "title": "History of English amateur cricket",
        "text": "Cricket, and hence English amateur cricket, probably began in England during the medieval period but the earliest known reference concerns the game being played c.1550 by children on a plot of land at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, Surrey. It is generally believed that cricket was originally a children's game as it is not until the beginning of the 17th century that reports can be found of adult participation.\nOriginally, all cricketers were amateurs in the literal sense of the word. Village cricket developed through the 17th century and teams typically comprised players who were all resident in the same village or parish. There is no evidence of professionalism before the English Civil War or during the Commonwealth but legal cases of the period have shown that cricket was played jointly by gentry and workers.\nAmateur and professional cricketers.\nIn the great upsurge of sport after the Restoration in 1660, cricket flourished because so many people had encountered it as children, especially at school. Although the sport was popular, its evolution into a major sport was accelerated by gambling because, along with horse racing and prizefighting, cricket soon attracted the attention of those who were seeking to make wagers.\nTo boost their chances of winning, some gamblers formed their own county-class teams such as Kent and Surrey who played each other in 1709. Patrons like Edwin Stead, the Duke of Richmond and Sir William Gage captained their teams and it was gentlemen like these, and the friends whom they invited to play, who began cricket's amateur tradition, while some players were paid a fee for taking part and this was the beginning of professionalism. Thus, a Sussex team of the 1720s might be captained by Richmond and include not only additional gentlemen like Gage but also professionals like Thomas Waymark; and this was the pattern of first-class English teams for a period of 300 years from the 1660s to the 1960s. Waymark, for example, was employed by the Duke of Richmond as a groom and this became a common arrangement between patron and professional. Later in the 18th century, professionals like Edward \"Lumpy\" Stevens and John Minshull were employed by their patrons as gardeners or gamekeepers. But in the longer term, the professional became an employee of his club and the beginnings of this trend could be observed in the 1770s when Hambledon paid match fees to its players.\nThe original Lord's was opened in 1787 and was intended to be the private preserve of a gentlemen's club which soon reconstituted itself as Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Only a gentleman could become a member but the club from its very beginning employed or contracted professionals. Lord's immediately began to stage major matches and these attracted the crowds that some members had originally sought to avoid. MCC teams soon adopted the now age-old formula of \"gentlemen\" and \"players\" in the same team.\nGrowth of cricket in the schools and universities.\nThere are few 17th century references to cricket being played at or in the vicinity of schools, but the sport was played by pupils at Eton College and Winchester College by the time of the Commonwealth. There is a reference to the game at St Paul's School, London about 1665 concerning John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who studied there.\nIn his \"Social History of English Cricket\", Derek Birley comments that school cricket was \"alive and well during the interregnum\" (1649–1660) and speculates that the game \"must have been known to every schoolboy in the south-east\" of England. However, he doubts that the sport at this time was part of any school's curriculum. Apart from Eton and Westminster School, all schools in the 17th century had local intakes and no class segregation. Therefore, the sons of rich and poor families played together.\nIn 1706, William Goldwin (1682–1747) published his \"Musae Juveniles\", which included a Latin poem called \"In Certamen Pilae\" (On a Ball Game). This has 95 lines and is about a rural cricket match. Goldwin himself attended Eton and then graduated to King's College, Cambridge in 1700. It is almost certain that he encountered cricket at both establishments. There is a reference to cricket at Cambridge University in 1710 while Samuel Johnson recorded that he played cricket at Oxford University in 1729. In 1760, the Reverend James Woodforde played for \"the Winchester against the Eaton (\"sic\")\" at Oxford.\nHorace Walpole entered Eton in 1726 and later wrote that \"playing cricket as well as thrashing bargemen was common\". The Sackville family which produced the Dukes of Dorset, most notably the 3rd Duke, sent its sons to Westminster, the 1st Duke studying there at the end of the 17th century; and it was through playing cricket at school that the game became a Sackville family tradition.\nThe spread of cricket to the northern counties by 1750 was partly due to \"its transmission by interested clergy, schoolmasters and others educated at southern boarding schools\". In the middle part of the 18th century, games involving teams of \"alumni\" became popular. These fixtures ranged from a team of Old Etonians playing the Gentlemen of England in 1751 to a game at the newly opened Lord's Old Ground in 1788 which was entitled \"Gentlemen Educated at Eton \"versus\" The Rest of the Schools\". The first school cricket match which has been recorded was in 1794 between Westminster School and Charterhouse School with pupils playing as City of London and City of Westminster at Lords Old Ground. Westminster School played its games at Tothill Fields, which was where Vincent Square now stands. It is known to have played matches against Eton in 1792 and 1796.\nBirley recorded that the \"sharpest rivalry\" in the middle to late 18th century was between old boys of Eton and Westminster, as these were the two oldest public schools. Notable cricketing patrons who attended those schools include the 3rd Duke of Dorset (Winchester), the 4th Earl of Tankerville and the 9th Earl of Winchilsea (both Eton). Their fellow patron Sir Horatio Mann attended Charterhouse School, an indication that cricket was gaining acceptance at many other schools. By 1800, it was firmly established in all public and most grammar schools.\nThe most important of these \"many other schools\" was Harrow, which would develop a great cricketing tradition during the 19th century and produce numerous quality players. Harrow had formerly been a grammar school but by the end of the 18th century it had become a public school. Cricket was welcomed at Harrow as elsewhere because it was seen as a useful method for keeping the boys occupied and out of mischief, this despite its strong gambling associations.\nAmateurism from 1805 to 1863.\nSchools cricket from 1805 to 1863.\nEton and Harrow definitely played each other in 1805 and there is evidence suggesting a game in 1804, perhaps sooner. The 1805 Eton v Harrow game at Lord's seems to have been organised by the boys themselves, not by the schools, and Lord Byron, who played for Harrow, is believed to have hired the venue. These two schools eventually developed a fierce rivalry that has become the schools cricket equivalent of Cambridge v Oxford or Yorkshire v Lancashire, but they did not meet again until 1818 (twice) and 1822; after that, the fixture has occurred annually except for 1829–1831, 1856 and in wartime. James Pycroft in \"The Cricket Field\" commented on the betting at the 1825 game but, by 1833, the match had become a social highlight and \"The Times\" noted \"upwards of thirty carriages containing ladies\". Also by this time, the main public schools had grouped themselves into an elite circle and all other schools were decidedly viewed as second class by comparison. The elite were Charterhouse, Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Westminster and Winchester.\nAmong prominent amateurs of the Napoleonic period, E. H. Budd was an Etonian and William Ward was a Wykehamist (i.e., a Winchester pupil). Other noted \"old boys\" were Edward Grimston, Charles Harenc, Charles Wordsworth (all Harrow), John Kirwan, Herbert Jenner (both Eton) and William Meyrick (Winchester).\nWard's old school of Winchester was the main challenger to Eton and Harrow. Harrow v Winchester was first played in 1825 and Eton v Winchester in 1826. Winchester won both of those games convincingly. H. S. Altham records that \"there was a great public school festival at Lord's until its demise in 1854\" which involved Eton, Harrow and Winchester. Meanwhile, of 234 \"blues\" awarded by Cambridge and Oxford from 1827 to 1854, 140 went to pupils of these three schools.\nAccording to Pycroft, Winchester had the best players in the 1820s and 1830s for, at Oxford, their former pupils challenged and defeated the rest of the university and they also won a match against the combined universities at Lord's. Six Wykehamists played in the inaugural varsity match in 1827 but the main participants in this were Charles Wordsworth of Harrow and Herbert Jenner of Eton. Charles Harenc of Harrow became the best amateur bowler of the 1830s. Notable Etonians of the time included Harvey Fellows and the fearsome pace bowler Walter Marcon.\nThe 1820s and 1830s saw the beginning of \"Muscular Christianity\" in the public schools. Dr Thomas Arnold at Rugby is often considered the \"founder\" of this movement but in terms of cricket it was at Winchester that the best effect was achieved, especially in their athletic approach to fielding. Although this was hyped as something new, there are plenty of references to outstanding athletic fielders in the 18th century such as Thomas Waymark, John Small, Tom Taylor and William Yalden.\nThe earliest references to cricket at Rugby School and Charterhouse date from the 1820s. Other schools that gained mention in the 19th century include Addiscombe Military Seminary, Cheltenham College, Clifton College, Malvern College, Marlborough College, Merchant Taylors' School, Repton School, Shrewsbury School, Tonbridge School, Uppingham School, Wellington and Whitgift School.\nGentlemen v. Players from 1806 to 1863.\nThe fixture that became the definitive expression of a cricketing class divide was first contested in 1806 when the two teams met twice. Even then, the amateurs realised they were at a real disadvantage and so their team in the inaugural match at Lord's included two of the greatest professional players, William Beldham and William Lambert as given men. Lambert made 57 out of 195 and, given the support he received from T. A. Smith, who scored 48, his contribution ensured that the Gentlemen won by an innings and 14 runs. The Gentlemen team was actually quite good as it also included Beauclerk, John Willes, Edward Bligh, George Leycester and Arthur Upton. In the second match, Beldham went back to the Players and only Lambert was a given man. Lambert again had an outstanding game and the Gentlemen won by 82 runs, though it was Beauclerk's first innings score of 58 from only 96 that was decisive.\nThe fixture was tried again in 1819 without much success and then, to quote Birley, it \"struggled on\". One of the least auspicious occasions was in 1821 when the Gentlemen \"gave up\" after they had scored only 60 and the Players had reached 270–6. Birley states that this was a Coronation Match to celebrate the accession of the much-maligned King George IV and that \"it was a suitably murky affair!\"\nIn 1822, the Gentlemen did manage to win on level terms thanks to their triumvirate of great batsmen: Beauclerk, Budd and Ward. Budd scored 69 out of 138 in the first innings; Beauclerk and Ward built an unbeaten partnership in the second to secure the six wicket win; and really the Players were rather let down by their batting. Having good batsmen and ordinary bowlers was to become a Gentlemen tendency. The Players on the other hand were usually strong in bowling and generally good in batting.\nFrom 1824 to 1837, the fixture was usually an odds match, the Gentlemen having as many as 18 in 1836. In two matches, the Players were handicapped by different stump lengths. In 1835, the Gents had Sam Redgate as a given man and he caused a stir by clean bowling Fuller Pilch twice for nought. In 1836, the great Alfred Mynn played for the Gents for the first time along with Alfred \"Dandy\" Lowth, another noted speed merchant even though he was still a 17-year-old Winchester school boy; his promising career was cut short due to failing eyesight.\nBy 1841, the fixture was in disrepute and MCC refused to organise it. It was only through the efforts of C. G. Taylor and the Hon. F. Ponsonby that the game could take place. They opened a subscription list to avert its collapse.\nUniversity cricket from 1827 to 1863.\nThe first University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford University took place at Lord's on 4 June 1827. The result was a draw. The captains were Charles Wordsworth (Oxford) and Herbert Jenner (Cambridge). It became an annual fixture in 1838.\nCambridge and Oxford were the only English universities until 1828, when the first college at London University was founded. Durham University was the fourth in 1832 and the first \"redbrick\" was Owens College at Manchester in 1851.\nAbout the early days of the two university clubs, H. S. Altham (himself an Oxford \"blue\") states that OUCC played on \"that part of Cowley Common that was called the Magdalen Ground, so-called because it had been appropriated by the Magdalen College Choir School, whose headmaster made it over\" (to OUCC). Cowley Common is in fact some distance from the university itself and so \"the cricketers used to enjoy a ride out across the fences!\" OUCC moved to The Parks, its present venue, in 1881.\nAltham says that CUCC began at a huge public area called Parker's Piece but then became tenants at Fenner's in 1846. The club secured the lease of Fenner's in 1873. Francis Fenner had been a bowler with the Cambridge Town Club (CTC) and had acquired his land in 1846, perhaps for the express purpose of leasing it to CUCC. CTC and the subsequent Cambridgeshire CCC also played on Parker's Piece.\nPlaying standards at the two university clubs were ordinary until the 1860s. Altham admits that many CUCC and OUCC players were selected for the Gentlemen but points out that this owed \"less to the strength of the universities than to the weakness of amateur cricket as a whole\".\nNoted CUCC players of the period include: C. G. Taylor; Robert Broughton, who was an outstanding cover point; George Boudier; Robert T. King, an all-rounder who had an outstanding season in 1849; Hon. F. Ponsonby; Joseph McCormick; Joseph Makinson, who played for Lancashire CCC; George Edward Cotterill; Herbert Marshall; Arthur Daniel; Hon. C. G. Lyttelton; Edward Sayres; John Kirwan; Edward Blore; Robert Lang.\nNoted OUCC players of the period include: Hon. Robert Grimston; Villiers Smith; Charles Coleridge; Reginald Hankey; Charlton Lane; the twins Arthur and Alfred Payne; Walter Fellows; Richard Mitchell, an outstanding batsman at Oxford who went on to greater things as coach at Eton in the 1870s; Alfred Lowth; George B. Lee; Henry Moberly; Charles Willis; Gerald Yonge; C. D. B. Marsham.\nThe All-England Eleven.\nIn the middle of the 19th century, William Clarke's All-England Eleven (AEE) was a highly successful all-professional venture which did much to popularise the game. The earliest overseas tours were also all-professional affairs. It was not long before amateurs became involved in the AEE."

        "title": "Skeleton Man (novel)",
        "text": "Skeleton Man is a crime novel by American writer Tony Hillerman, the seventeenth in the Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee Navajo Tribal Police series, first published in 2004. It was a New York Times best-seller\nA spectacular crash of two planes above the Grand Canyon in the 1950s killed all aboard, and filled the Canyon with everything that had once been on the two planes. The event alters long held stories of the tribes who live on the Canyon floor, and leaves a pregnant woman about to be married on her own, when her fiancé's family rejects her and her child. The child is grown, and seeks her father's remains, while the lawyer who gained financially by rejection of the child fights to hold on to his wealth. A couple of expensive diamonds bring Leaphorn, Chee and Manuelito into her story, where greed is contested against family support in the grandeur of the canyon.\nPlot summary.\nWhen two passenger airplanes collide over the Grand Canyon in the 1950s killing all aboard, John Clarke's body is lost, as is the briefcase of diamonds he had locked to his wrist. Scorning Mr. Clarke's pregnant fiancée, the Clarke family disclaims the out-of-wedlock daughter, Joanna Craig. When Clarke's father dies without heir shortly after the crash, the family fortune is entrusted to the estate's attorney, Dan Plymale, to create a charitable foundation. Mr. Plymale then proceeds to live well as executor of the foundation's funds, while Joanna Craig and her mother make their own way.\nDecades later, Billy Tuve, a Hopi, is arrested on suspicion of burglary and murder based on his presenting a rare diamond for pawn. Tuve's cousin, Cowboy Dashee solicits help from his friend Navajo Tribal Police Sergeant Jim Chee to clear Tuve's name. Retired Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn recalls that his old acquaintance Shorty McGinnis acquired a similar diamond many years ago from a man whose story matches Tuve's story. Then Louisa Bourebonette relates the stories she has heard from older Havasupais about the man with the diamonds living at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, and the flyers from a woman seeking her father's remains from that plane crash, which Leaphorn shares with Chee. Joanna Craig pays the bail for Billy Tuve, asking him to lead her to the place where he received the diamond. Though it will aid his case, Billy is reluctant because the place, the Salt Shrine, is sacred to his religion. Before Joanna can pick Billy up at his own home, Fred Sherman takes Billy away. Joanna trails them, and in a quick maneuver, takes Sherman's gun from him and shoots him in the chest. She and Billy proceed to the trail head on the south rim of the Grand Canyon. Billy takes her part way down, then disappears. Bradford Chandler, hired by Dan Plymale, learns Sherman will not meet him when a police officer answers Sherman's cell phone. Chandler goes on alone, arriving near the sacred spot. Chee, Dashee, and Bernadette Manuelito arrived earlier, looking both for the absent Billy and the man who long ago traded with Billy, a hermit wanting people to believe more in Massau’u, to resolve their feelings after the plane crash, with bodies raining down on them. Manuelito stays behind while Chee and Dashee each go a different way along the canyon bottom. She does not stay in one place, but walks and finds the slot (a cave but with an opening to sunlight way above) along the canyon wall where the man had lived, and his body, long dead of natural causes. She sees a human arm bone, and his array of the 70 remaining diamonds. She finds what Chee and Dashee sought.\nChandler, with his loaded pistol, meets Joanna in the canyon bottom. An uneasy pair, they follow Manuelito's tracks into the slot, where she is ready for the murderous Chandler. Chandler stores the seventy odd diamonds in his hiking socks. A \"male\" storm, one of high intensity rains, rises. Manuelito and Joanna Craig take shelter on a ledge, while Chandler leaves with his diamonds and is then carried out by the force of the instant river made by the rain. Chee finds the slot in time to see the corpse carried out by the torrent of water, followed by Chandler. He tries to save Chandler, but Chandler will not let go of the socks full of diamonds. The storm passes, and Chee runs to Manuelito. The three meet Dashee, whose ankle is injured, and return in the rescue helicopter. Joanna Craig has what she needed most, the remains of her father's arm, once chained to the container of diamonds. New DNA analysis methods show positively that he was her father, and she claims her true name of Clarke. She now has the basis to sue Plymale for her inheritance. Sherman was found in time by the local police, and survives. He will not admit that petite Joanna Craig shot him; instead he tells police he did it himself by accident. The two corpses were found, but not the diamonds, save for the one taken by Bernadette as evidence in favor of Billy Tuve. Billy Tuve is proved innocent of theft and murder.\nTitle.\nSkeleton man is an alternative name for the Hopi Death kachina, Massau'u. It is also what Chee said to describe the corpse of the shaman as it passed by him in the torrent of water from the slot that had been the shaman's home when alive. Joanna Craig sought the bones of her father, both to properly bury him and to show she was his daughter, using the DNA still present, nearly 50 years later.\nContinuity.\nIn conversations among the characters, references are made to stories in earlier novels. For example, Leaphorn and Shorty McGinnis make passing mention of Tso and the singer Margaret Cigaret, who were in the novel \"Listening Woman\". Jim Chee and Bernadette Manuelito were engaged to marry at the end of the prior novel, \"The Sinister Pig\", and they now make the final plans to marry. Chee recalls the two women he knew and loved before he fell in love with Bernadette Manuelito: Mary Landon (introduced in \"People of Darkness\") and Janet Pete (introduced in \"Skinwalkers\") who each pursued Chee, but would not consider living on the reservation for him. Bernadette Manuelito recalls the story told her of the way Chee handled the driver who made amends after killing a man while driving drunk, yet needed to stay out of jail to care for his grandson, part of the plot of \"Sacred Clowns\".\nNatural, cultural and historical references.\nGeographic, botanical, animal, historical, and cultural artifacts and events often play key roles in the Chee/Leaphorn series - either as direct plot elements, to explain character motivations or perspectives, or to illustrate cultural or \nreligious beliefs and practices. In \"Skeleton Man\" this includes:\nReviews.\nMarilyn Stasio writing in \"The New York Times\" observes:\nBut rather than solving the mystery in a conventional sense, to unravel these reworked myths reaffirms their power. In ignoring the beauty of the natural world to grasp for diamonds, the villains of this piece only confirm ancient Indian wisdom about greed. Even Leaphorn, not a spiritual man, unconsciously absorbs the Skeleton Man's lesson about immortality when he contemplates the \"empty dusty silence\" of a world in which many of his old friends have died and faces his own fear of death. No wonder Hillerman's stories never grow old. Like myths, they keep evolving with the telling.\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" finds this not so much a mystery as a story of suspense as the main characters converge in the treacherous landscape of the Grand Canyon:\nA brain-damaged Hopi holds the key to a fortune in diamonds, and even bigger stakes, in this treasure hunt.\nWhen he died nearly 50 years ago in a plane crash over the Grand Canyon, John Clarke had a case of diamonds chained to his left wrist and a pregnant fiancée waiting at the altar. Now, good-natured Billy Tuve has tried to pawn what looks like one of the Clarke diamonds for $20. Amid the usual jurisdictional scuffles among the Navajo Count Police, the Navajo Tribal Police, and the FBI, Billy’s placed under arrest for robbing and killing the diamond’s latest owner, Shorty McGinnis, who turns out to be very much alive. As retired Lt. Joe Leaphorn and active Sgt. Jim Chee of the NTP (\"The Sinister Pig\", 2003, etc.) sort out Billy’s and Shorty’s wild tales of how they acquired the diamonds, it becomes clear that three separate parties will be converging on the floor of the Grand Canyon. Chee and his own fiancée, Bernadette Manuelito, want to confirm Billy’s story; Joanna Craig wants to find her father’s missing left arm, whose DNA can prove she’s his rightful heir; and skip tracer Bradford Chandler, acting on behalf of John Clarke’s crooked executor Dan Plymale, wants to make sure she doesn’t. Adventures ensue.\nNo mystery this time, but considerable suspense in the race to bottom of one of the most spectacular and treacherous landscapes Hillerman’s ever explored.\n\"Publishers Weekly\" also notes the suspense of this sterling novel:\nThe \"School Library Journal\" finds this book, for high school readers and adults, to be a crackerjack addition to this series:\n\"Bookmarks Magazine\" finds this novel disappointing compared to others in the series, and not enough suspense:"

        "title": "King James VI Golf Club",
        "text": "King James VI Golf Club, located in Perth, Scotland, is a private golf course also open to visitors. The River Tay setting is notable as it is the country's only self-contained course on a river island. The Island course is only accessible by foot by a side-walk on the side of a train bridge crossing the River Tay.\nFounded in 1858 nearby at Perth's North Inch, then relocated to Moncreiffe Island in 1897, and a purpose-built course designed by 'Old' Tom Morris, the legendary winner of multiple British Open Championships.\nThe club is currently captained by Roger Gordon, with Allan Knox the resident professional.\nHistory.\nThe origins of golf in Perth are obscure, as they are for the rest of Scotland, but it is likely they date to the fifteenth century. National bans on golf and football, designed to promote the practise of archery, were made in 1458, 1471 and 1491. In 1502, the first recorded purchase of golf equipment, a set of golf clubs costing thirteen shillings, was made by king James IV from a bow-maker in Perth. \nThe club takes its name from the tradition that King James VI of Scotland (1566–1625), who was later crowned King James I of England and Ireland, had as a boy learned to play golf on Perth's Inches (\"inch\" from the Gaelic \"innse\" meaning island).\nGolf was played on both Inches to begin with, but players began to favour the North Inch, and by about 1850 no-one played golf on the South Inch.\nThe King James VI Golf Club was established in 1858. In 1860, what is believed to be the first inter-club golf match ever played took place when \"King Jimmy\" took on the Elie and Earlsferry Golf Club, which had also been founded in 1858. In 1884 a team from King James VI took part in the first inter-club golf match played in Ireland, against the Royal Belfast Club. King James members later set up some holes on a barren stretch of coastline near the village of Portrush, and were the first to play on what is now a world-famous links course.\nKing James VI shared the 10-hole North Inch course with various other local golf clubs until 1897, when it migrated to its current setting on Moncreiffe Island. The new course was laid out by the famous St Andrews professional, Old Tom Morris (1821–1908), a four-time winner of the British Open in the 1860s and prolific course designer. He was noted for incorporating natural features such as walls, burns and heather into his designs, and players of his new Island course had to contend with many mounds and banks as well as some trees and bunkers.\nIn March 1955 the old, wooden clubhouse was burned to the ground despite the heroic efforts of the local fire brigade to get fire-fighting equipment over to the site. This was a devastating blow, which destroyed many of the records and trophies from the early days of KJVI's history, to say nothing of valuable equipment belonging to individual members and the Club.\nThe present day club house occupies the same site.\nBrian Grieve is perhaps the club's most notable player. Brian joined the club in 1958, and has had a fantastic career in amateur golf. \nHis wins include:\nCourse layout and development.\nThe course has undergone a number of recent changes bringing the River Tay into play throughout the back 9.

Standing at 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), he played professionally in four different countries.\nBorn in Detroit, Michigan, on February 28, 1983, Gilbert attended the University at Buffalo, and in his senior year was part of the memorable Buffalo Bulls team that, led by fellow guard Turner Battle, went on an improbable run to the Mid-American Conference Championship, beating Western Michigan in the semi-finals at the Gund Arena in Cleveland. In the MAC final, the Bulls lost in overtime to Ohio University on a tip-in by Leon Williams with 0.5 seconds remaining, thus, the Bulls failed to clinch the automatic bid to the 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.\nGilbert, considered to be one of the best defenders to ever don a Bulls' jersey, averaged 7.6 points, 3.9 rebounds and 1.8 steals his senior season while also setting the school record for games played in a career (118).\nUpon graduating in 2005, he went on to sign a professional contract with German second division team FC Schalke. When interviewed after his signing, Gilbert said \"I am excited about the opportunity to play professionally, I knew that I would play overseas some day, I am just surprised that it happened so fast.\" In his one season in Germany, Gilbert averaged 18 points per game, while recording his season-high 33 points in a 92–79 home victory over Rhöndorf.\nFor the 2006–07 season, Gilbert made the move to England, where he signed for Paul James's Guildford Heat side, who were only in their second year of existence. A major coup for the side, Gilbert became a pivotal player in leading the club to its first ever BBL title. He averaged an impressive 16.9 points in 33.9 minutes per game.\nHe returned for a second season to lead the Heat into the ULEB Cup, the club's debut in European competition. He aided the team to their first trophy of the season, picking up the BBL Cup Winners' Cup after defeating Plymouth Raiders. In 2008, he signed for French team Boulazac Basket Dordogne but after one year returned to Britain to play under Coach James once again for the Worcester Wolves."

        "text": "Liu Chuang (, born 6 June 1990) is a Chinese former professional snooker player.\nEarly life.\nLiu grew up in Liaoning province in northeast China. Near his parents' house there was a snooker table and when he was 10 he played on it and liked it a lot. His father noticed his potential, and supported him as did the person who owned that table, who became his first coach.\nWhen he was 13, Liu travelled thousands of miles to play in southern China, where there were more professionals. There he improved and began to play competitive matches. In 2007, the chairman of the Asian Snooker Association saw his potential, and he gained a wild card in the China Open.\nCareer.\nJunior.\nIn 2005, Liu was a runner-up in a national junior tournament in China. In 2006, Liu reached the final of a senior national tournament.\nSenior.\nLiu first came to the attention of the snooker world when he was picked as a wildcard to enter the 2007 China Open. Liu was victorious over Andy Hicks, beating him 5–4. That set up a meeting with Liu's idol, Ronnie O'Sullivan; Liu lost the match 1–5.\nHe reached the quarter-finals of the 2007 Asian Snooker Championship, where he lost 4–5 to Yasin Merchant.\nIn the 2008 World Championship he qualified for the main stage, He beat Colin Mitchell 10–0, Lee Walker 10–9 Joe Delaney 10–5, David Gray 10–5, and then Dominic Dale 10–9 to become only the fourth 17-year-old player to qualify for the Crucible after Stephen Hendry, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Judd Trump. Liu was drawn to play O'Sullivan in the first round. Despite being 0–3 down, Liu came back in the first session and levelled at 4–4, before O'Sullivan eventually won the game 10–5. Liu was relegated from the Main Tour after the following season.\nOn 15 April 2010, he won the Asian Under 21 Snooker Championship, defeating Thanawat Thirapongpaiboon 10–5 in the final. With this he qualified for the 2010/2011 professional Main Tour.\n2011/2012 season.\nLiu began the season ranked world number 60, meaning he would need to win three qualifying matches to reach the main stage of the ranking event tournaments. He did not achieve this until the final and biggest tournament on the snooker calendar, the World Championship. He beat Rod Lawler 10–7, Jimmy White 10–8 and Jamie Cope 10–7 to reach the Crucible for the second time in his career. Liu was one of five Asian players to make it to the event, which was a new record. He played two-time world champion Mark Williams in the first round and was beaten 6–10, to finish the season ranked number 56, inside the top 64 who automatically retained their places for the 2012–13 season.\n2012/2013 season.\nThe 2012–13 season proved to be less successful for Liu as he failed to qualify for any of the ranking events. He played in seven of the ten minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events with his best finish coming in the last two European Tour tournaments, where he lost in the last 32 in both. He was ranked 72nd on the PTC Order of Merit. Liu's season ended when he lost in the second round of World Championship Qualifying 9–10 to Dechawat Poomjaeng, which saw him placed world number 54 in the rankings.\n2013/2014 season.\nLiu received first round entry into the UK Championship and Welsh Open as all 128 players on the snooker tour began at the venue stage. It was at these events where Liu won his only matches in ranking events this season. In the UK he beat Tony Drago 6–1, before losing 6–5 against Robert Milkins and at the Welsh he saw off Chen Zhe 4–2, but was then whitewashed 4–0 by Joe Perry.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nChuang reached two quarter-finals in Asian Tour events during the 2013–14 season, at the Yixing Open and Zhengzhou Open, losing 4–0 to Mark Selby and 4–2 to Liang Wenbo respectively. Chuang finished outside of the top 64 in the world rankings and would have been relegated from the tour; however, his placing of 12th on the Asian Order of Merit saw him earn a fresh two-year card for the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons by claiming the third of four spots available to non-qualified players.\n2014/2015 season.\nLiu entered the qualifying rounds of three ranking events this season and lost his first match in each. His only wins came at the Yixing Open where he beat Michael Tomlinson and Wang Heng, before losing 4–0 to Li Hang in the last 32. Liu has not played in an event since October 2014.\nChinese 8 Ball.\nLiu made it to the final of the 2016 World Chinese 8 Ball Masters and lost to Yang Fan 12–9. The match was a best of 25 race to 13, but the 110 minute time limit ran out."

        "title": "VCU Rams men's basketball",
        "text": "The VCU Rams men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball team that represents Virginia Commonwealth University. The Rams joined the Atlantic 10 Conference in the 2012–13 season after previously competing in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). In 2017, VCU was ranked the 40th most valuable men's basketball program in the country by \"The Wall Street Journal\". With a valuation of $56.9 million, VCU ranked second in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and second in the A-10 Conference. The team is coached by Ryan Odom.\nSince 1999, the team has played home basketball games at the E.J. Wade Arena at the Stuart C. Siegel Center in Richmond, Virginia on the university's Monroe Park campus. Virginia Commonwealth has made it to the NCAA Final Four once in its program's history, in 2011. Additionally, the Rams won the 2010 CBI tournament and have ten conference tournaments; three being in the Sun Belt Conference, five being in the Colonial Athletic Association, and two in the Atlantic 10 Conference. The Rams have also won twelve regular season championships; four from the Sun Belt, five from the CAA, and three in the Atlantic 10. The official student supporter group is known as the Rowdy Rams.\nThe team is known for its Final Four run in the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. While the team had made nine NCAA tournament appearances beforehand, never had the Rams made it beyond the second round of the tournament. In 2011, the Rams' journey to the Final Four began in one of the four opening round games, commonly called \"play-in\" games, intended to narrow the field from 68 to 64 teams. Thus, VCU became the first team to advance from the \"First Four\" to the Final Four.\nIn another NCAA tournament-first, VCU became the first team ever to forfeit a game in the NCAA tournament when their First Round game in the 2021 NCAA tournament was declared a no-contest due to several positive COVID-19 tests in the VCU program.\nVCU reached the NCAA tournament a state record seven consecutive times from 2011 to 2017.\nHistory.\nThe VCU Rams men's basketball program was founded in 1968, at the same time as the merger of the Richmond Professional Institute and the Medical College of Virginia. In the 1968–69 season as an independent team, the program played its first ever season. Coached by Benny Dees and assisted by Landy Watson and Vann Brackin for their first two seasons, Dees led the team to two winning records, before being replaced by Chuck Noe. It would take 10 more seasons before the Rams appeared in a postseason tournament, earning a berth into the 1978 National Invitation tournament being eliminated in the first round by the University of Detroit.\nUnder the coaching of J.D. Barnett, the Rams earned fourth berths into the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, each being their first four berths, the first coming in 1980. During Barnett's six years coaching the team, only twice did the Rams not win the Sun Belt Conference.\nThe Rams became the first team to sweep the best of 3 championship series in the CBI post-season tournament on their way to becoming the 2010 CBI Champions. It is the first post-season tournament championship, excluding conference tournaments, in the history of the program.\nThe Sun Belt Years.\nVCU received their first bid to the NCAA tournament in the 1979–1980 season with an 18–12 overall record and Sun Belt Conference tournament championship led by then first-year VCU Head Coach J.D. Barnett in VCU's first season in the Sun Belt. They entered the tournament as a No. 12 seed in the East Region and were eliminated in the first round by No. 5 Iowa.\nIt would not be long before the Rams returned to the tournament. The following year the Rams posted a 24–5 record on their way to the Sun Belt Conference regular season and Conference tournament championships. The Rams entered the tournament as the No. 5 seed in the East region and defeated No. 12 Long Island before being eliminated by No. 4 Tennessee in overtime in the second round 56–58.\nThe Rams would return to the tournament in 1983. The Rams, the No. 5 seed in the East region, defeated No. 12 seed La Salle in the first round and were eliminated in the second round by No. 4 seed Georgia 54–56. The Rams lost their second-round game by the same margin to No. 4 Tennessee in 1981. The 1984 tournament held similar results for the Rams squad. They entered the tournament as a No. 6 seed in the East Region and defeated No. 11 Northeastern before being eliminated by No. 3 Syracuse. The second-round losses in the NCAA tournament by VCU in 1981, 1983, and 1984 were to teams with first-round byes before the tournament expanded to 64 teams for the 1984–1985 season and byes were eliminated.\nIn the 1984–85 season the Rams once again made it to the newly expanded 1985 NCAA tournament. The Rams entered the tournament as the No. 2 seed in the West region, the highest seeding they have ever received in the tournament. The Rams defeated No. 15 Marshall in the first round, but unfortunately their luck had not changed in the second-round and they were upset by No. 7 Alabama 63–59.\nDuring his tenure, Head Coach J.D Barnett (1979–1985) led VCU and the Rams to five NCAA tournament appearances (1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1985) while capturing four Sun Belt regular season conference championships (1981, 1983, 1984, 1985) and three Sun Belt Conference tournament championships (1980, 1981, 1985). He was 132–48 overall and 59–19 in conference play during his time at VCU.\nThe Rams next stint in the post-season came under Head Coach Mike Pollio in the 1988 NIT Tournament where they would reach the quarter-finals before ultimately falling to UConn 60–69. The Rams posted wins over Marshall and Southern Mississippi in the first and second rounds, respectively.\nThe Rams remained in the Sun Belt Conference until 1991 when they joined the Metro Conference. VCU was left out of the 1995 merger of the Metro and Great Midwest Conference that created Conference USA. They instead joined the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) for the 1995–1996 season.\nThe CAA Days.\nIn their first season as members of the CAA, the Rams posted a 24–9 overall record, going 14–2 in conference play en route to the CAA regular season and conference tournament championships. The Rams earned the right to go dancing in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1985, but fell in the first round as the No. 12 seed in the Southeast region to No. 5 Mississippi State.\nJeff Capel era.\nThe VCU men's basketball team would return to prominence in the 2003–2004 season under then second-year Head Coach Jeff Capel. Following a 2nd place conference finish in his debut season, Capel led the Rams to a 23–8 overall record, going 14–4 in conference play and capturing the CAA regular season and conference tournament championships. In the 2004 NCAA tournament, the Rams were awarded the No. 13 seed in the East region and faced No. 4 Wake Forest in the first round. VCU led for much of the second half and had a chance to win towards the end despite the Wake Forest comeback, but ultimately fell 79–78.\nJeff Capel originally joined VCU as an assistant in 2001 and at the time of his promotion to the head coaching position in 2002 was the youngest head coach in Division I NCAA basketball at 27 years old. During his time as the head coach with VCU, Capel compiled a 79–41 record. In April 2006, Capel resigned as head coach to accept the same position with the University of Oklahoma Sooners. He was replaced by Anthony Grant, formerly an assistant and associate head coach for several years to Billy Donovan, including the 2006 NCAA champions, the University of Florida Gators.\nAnthony Grant era.\nIn his first year as head coach, Anthony Grant led the Rams to a school-record 28 wins. The Rams finished the season 28–7, also setting a school and CAA conference record with 16 wins in conference play. Grant, who also set a school record for most wins by a first-year head coach, was named the CAA Coach of the Year. The Rams were 16–2 in conference play and captured the CAA Regular season Championship before capturing the CAA Conference tournament Championship in thrilling fashion as Eric Maynor burst onto the national scene by scoring 9 points in the final 1:55 to bury the George Mason Patriots, finishing with 14 of his 20 points in the second half. Maynor also had 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals in the victory.\nThe Rams entered the 2007 NCAA tournament as the No. 11 seed in the West region and upset the No. 6 seed Duke Blue Devils 79–77 on a game-winning bucket from just beyond the free-throw line by Eric Maynor in the final seconds of the game.\nThe Rams good fortune did not continue into the next round, however, where they were eliminated by the No. 3 seed Pittsburgh Panthers. The Rams squad showed outstanding poise in the second-half by forcing overtime after trailing 26–41 at halftime. They would go on to lose by a score of 79–84.\nThe next year the Rams would win their second straight CAA regular season championship, posting a 24–8 overall record, 15–3 in conference play, but fall short in the conference tournament in a heartbreaking upset to William &amp; Mary in the semi-finals. The Rams missed an at-large bid for the NCAA tournament but instead received an invitation to play in the NIT. The Rams heartbreak continued as they were upset on their home court in the first round by old-time Sun Belt Conference rival, the UAB Blazers 80–77 as a late comeback fell just short.\nThe 2008–2009 season was another successful one for the VCU program. The Rams finished the season with a mark of 24–10 overall, going 14–4 in a hotly contested CAA and sealing the deal on a three-peat as CAA regular season champions for only the second time in CAA conference history and the second time in school history, the first coming during the Rams time in the Sun Belt Conference. The Rams would not fall short again and captured the CAA Conference tournament championship for the fourth time since joining the conference capped by a 71–50 rout of rival George Mason in the final. The 21-point margin is the largest margin of victory in a CAA Conference tournament Championship Game. Larry Sanders set CAA Conference tournament Championship Game records for the Rams with 20 rebounds and 7 blocks in the victory.\nSo once again, the Rams headed to the NCAA tournament as a No. 11 seed in the East region. The Rams were eliminated by the No. 6 seed UCLA Bruins in a hard-fought game 65–64.\nAnthony Grant posted an impressive 76–25 record in his three seasons as the head men's basketball coach at VCU. He was an outright dominating 52–10 versus CAA opponents, including conference tournaments, capturing three straight CAA Regular season Conference Championships and two CAA Conference tournament championships. He led VCU to two NCAA tournament berths and one NIT berth before departing the program to take over the head coaching position at the University of Alabama. Eric Maynor would go on to be drafted No. 20 in the 2009 NBA draft by the Utah Jazz.\nShaka Smart era.\nFrom 2009 to 2015, the Rams were led by Shaka Smart, who had been previously an assistant coach for the Florida Gators men's basketball team. Prior to Florida, Smart served as an assistant coach at Clemson, Akron and California (Pa.) and a director of operations at Dayton. During his introductory press conference, he promised that his teams would \"wreak havoc on our opponents [sic] psyche and their plan of attack.\" Smart's teams have employed a basketball philosophy nicknamed Havoc since that point.\nIn Smart's first year as the Rams head coach, the team posted a 27–9 record, going 11–7 in the CAA, finishing fifth in the conference. As fifth seeds, the Rams made it to the semi-finals of the 2010 CAA men's basketball tournament before falling to their conference rivals, Old Dominion, who would go on to win the CAA Championship. Despite reaching the semifinals of the CAA Tournament, the Rams did not earn a berth into either the NCAA or NIT tournaments. However, the Rams earned a berth into the 2010 College Basketball Invitational, where they would finish as the eventual champions, defeating Saint Louis 2–0 in the series final. Their sweep of Saint Louis made it the first time in CBI history a team won the best two-out-of-three championship series in two games. Additionally, it was VCU's first postseason tournament, other than the Sun Belt and CAA tournaments, that the program won.\nOn Selection Sunday 2011, the VCU Rams received an at-large bid to the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament to start off the newly created 68-team field. VCU found itself as one of the last teams in the tournament and was scheduled to play in the newly formed \"First Four\" against USC on March 16 for a spot as the 11th seed in the tournament. The inclusion of VCU in the tournament was widely criticized by pundits and the ESPN network, in particular Jay Bilas and Dick Vitale. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, dubbed by many as \"The First Four\", The Rams succeeded in knocking off USC by the score of 59–46. The Rams blew out Georgetown 74–56 in Chicago to reach the Round of 32 and followed this win up with a 94–76 rout of third-seeded Purdue to advance to VCU's first-ever Sweet Sixteen appearance. VCU then beat Florida State 72–71 in overtime on a last second shot by Bradford Burgess to advance to the school's first ever Elite Eight appearance.\nThe Rams upset the number one seeded Kansas Jayhawks 71–61 to reach the Final Four for the first time ever. VCU, the Southwest Regional champions played in the National Semifinal against the Southeast Region champion Butler Bulldogs, losing 70–62. The VCU Rams finished sixth in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll at the end of the season.&lt;ref name=\"Final 2011 USA Today/ESPN Top 25\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was the highest ranking in VCU's history and the highest ranking of any team from the CAA. The 2011 NCAA tournament run by VCU is regarded as one of the best Cinderella runs of all time. Their First Four appearance, combined with their run to the Final Four, gave VCU the distinction of being the first team to win five games in the men's NCAA tournament without reaching the championship game.\nThe Atlantic 10 Days.\nThe major conference realignment of the early 2010s eventually gave VCU the opportunity for a major basketball upgrade. After A10 mainstay Temple announced its departure for the Big East Conference and Charlotte announced it would return to Conference USA, the A10 reloaded by adding Butler and VCU. The move placed VCU in a conference that regularly collected NCAA at-large bids—the A10 had 20 teams earn at-large bids from 2000 through 2012, including three in the 2012 tournament. By comparison, the CAA had only four at-large bids in the same period (one of them being VCU's 2011 Final Four team).\nOn Sunday, March 15, 2015, VCU won its first Atlantic 10 conference tournament championship.\nOn April 2, 2015, Smart left VCU to go to the University of Texas.\nWill Wade era.\nAfter two seasons at Chattanooga, Will Wade returned to VCU to take the open head coaching position vacated by Shaka Smart. In his first season returning to VCU, Wade guided the team to their first ever A10 Conference regular season championship and a 25–11 overall record. VCU made it to the championship game of the A10 conference tournament for the 4th straight season, falling to St. Joseph's. The team won at least 24 games, VCU and Kansas are the only NCAA schools to reach that feat the last 10 seasons. The Rams also made their 6th straight NCAA tournament, one of only 8 teams in the country to do so. VCU made it to the round of 32 where they fell to Oklahoma 85–81. Wade finished second in voting for A10 coach of the year. Wade announced that he was leaving VCU after two years to accept the head coaching position at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.\nMike Rhoades era.\nOn March 21, 2017, VCU announced that the school had hired former associate head coach under Shaka Smart, Mike Rhoades, as the Rams' new head basketball coach. He was formerly the head coach at Rice University in Houston. He is the 12th coach in program history.\nOn March 29, 2023, Mike Rhoades announced he was accepting an offer to coach at Penn State following 6 seasons at VCU and 0 NCAA tournament wins. Hours after his announced departure all key VCU players declared for the transfer portal leaving VCU with just 5 active roster players.\nCoaches.\nIn the team's existence, the Rams have had 12 different head coaches. Benny Dees coached the team for the first two seasons of existence. During Dees' tenure, the team achieved winning records both seasons, but barely pulled ahead of .500, resulting in Dees being fired. The second coach, Chuck Noe, led the team for the next six seasons.\nFollowing Noe's departure as head coach in 1976, Dana Kirk became the third head coach in Rams basketball history. Kirk, formerly assistant to Denny Crum, was part of the University of Louisville team that reached the Final Four in 1976. In Kirk's second season with the team, he led them to a 24–5 record, and a berth into the National Invitational tournament, making it the first time the team reached any major tournament. Although the team was eliminated in the first round, the success of the program Kirk built continued into the following season. Kirk's success with the Rams resulted in him being hired as the head coach at Memphis State (now Memphis) in 1979.\nSubsequently, the Rams earned an invitation to play in the Sun Belt Conference and hired J. D. Barnett as their head coach. Barnett, who coached the team from 1979 through 1985, immediately brought NCAA success to the team, earning berths into the NCAA tournament five of the six seasons in his tenure, as well as being the four-time Sun Belt champions. Barnet's success eventually led to him being offered a contract to coach at Tulsa.\nMike Pollio became the fifth coach in Rams history. The head coach from 1985 until 1989, Pollio had a rather lackluster record with the team. During his four years as coach, Pollio had two seasons with losing records, the first in Rams history. During his four years, Pollio managed to get the team into the NIT quarterfinals.\nFacilities.\nThe Rams play at the E.J. Wade Arena, formerly Verizon Wireless Arena, the Stuart C. Siegel Center, located in the northwest corridor of the Monroe Park campus. University-owned, the Siegel Center broke ground for construction April 1996, and opened three years later, in May 1999. Since the 1999–00 season, the venue has been the home arena for the Rams, as well as the women's basketball team and volleyball team.\nPrior to the opening of the Siegel Center, the Rams spent a majority of their history playing their home basketball games in the Richmond Coliseum, which housed the team from 1971 until 1999. Prior to the Rams' long-term occupation of the Coliseum, the team played their home games in the Franklin Street Gym.\nPractice facility.\nA $25 million practice facility located on the north side of Marshall Street adjacent to the Siegel Center was completed in November 2015. Replacing the decades-old Franklin Street Gym, it houses the Men's and Women's basketball teams. The building's size is about and features courts, players' lounges, dining areas, coaches' offices, retail spaces, and a hall of fame.\nRivals.\nThe Rams have three major rivals: Old Dominion, George Mason and their long-standing crosstown rival University of Richmond.\nIn the 1970s, their first six games were decided at the buzzer. For the past 35 years, the two schools have competed annually in the Capital City Classic (formerly Black &amp; Blue Classic). The success of the two school's basketball programs was highlighted in the 2011 NCAA tournament, as Richmond and VCU respectively reached the Sweet Sixteen and Final Four.\nPlayers.\nHonored jerseys.\nVCU has honored six players by retiring their jerseys, although the numbers remained active:\nPlayers in the NBA.\n\"Source\"\nResults by season.\nMost recent:\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Rams have appeared in 19 NCAA tournaments.

They have a record of 1–5 against teams in the Top 5 during this span, the lone win coming against #2 Kansas during the 2011 NCAA tournament in which Kansas was a #1 seed. The Rams also hold a record of 5–4 against ranked teams at the Siegel Center since the arena first opened in 1999.\nBracketBuster games.\nFrom 2005 to 2012, VCU had participated in ESPN's BracketBusters series, in which the Rams would play against another team from a mid-major conference. VCU's record during this series was 5–3, going 3–1 at home. Scores in bold represent games in which VCU was the home team."

        "text": "The 1962 Rose Bowl, played on January 1, 1962, was the 48th Rose Bowl Game. The Minnesota Golden Gophers defeated the UCLA Bruins, 21–3.\nBig Ten Conference champion Ohio State declined the invitation to play in the Rose Bowl. Days after the conclusion of the regular season, the university's faculty council voted 28–25 against participation in the Rose Bowl. They were under no contractual obligation to accept the invitation following the demise of the Pacific Coast Conference after the 1958 season. Minnesota, the runner-up in the Big Ten, was then offered the \"at-large\" invitation, and accepted.\nMinnesota quarterback Sandy Stephens was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game. It was broadcast on the NBC television network and was the first national color television broadcast of a college football game.\nTeams.\nUniversity of Minnesota Golden Gophers.\nThe Gophers had gone to the Rose Bowl the previous year as the #1 team in the nation and lost to the Washington Huskies. In 1961, the Gophers actually finished in second place in Big Ten Conference play. Minnesota had a loss to Missouri, and a Big Ten loss to Wisconsin in their rivalry game. Ohio State was the Big Ten champion, but because of a faculty council decision to emphasize academics over athletics, the Buckeyes turned down the Rose Bowl berth. Ironically, Minnesota would not have received the Rose Bowl invitation if they had, in fact, been the 1961 Big Ten champion and the conference had a formal agreement with the Rose Bowl for the 1961 and 1962 games, since the Big Ten had a \"no-repeat\" rule in effect until 1972. The Gophers were led by Sandy Stephens, the first African American All-American quarterback. However, he was not the first African-American starting quarterback in a Rose Bowl (this distinction goes to Charles Fremont West of Washington &amp; Jefferson, forty years earlier in 1922).\nUCLA Bruins.\nIn the regular season, UCLA had lost at both Michigan and Ohio State earlier in the season. They also lost to Washington, but managed to beat USC during one of the few rainy games in the rivalry.\nGame summary.\nThe weather was sunny, and Minnesota wore their home maroon jerseys, with white helmets and white pants, while UCLA also wore their home powder blue uniforms with gold pants. Using the single wing offense, UCLA struggled against the Gophers, netting only one field goal to open the scoring in the first quarter. Minnesota had 21 first downs to UCLA's 8, and the Gophers held the Bruins to 107 total yards, while gaining 297 yards on 66 plays. Stephens rushed for 46 yards on 12 carries, including two rushing touchdowns, and was 7 for 11 in passing for 75 yards.\nAftermath.\nThis is Minnesota's only Rose Bowl win and its most recent appearance. Through the 2019 season, Minnesota has gone the longest in the Big Ten conference without playing in the Rose Bowl game. Sandy Stephens was named the Most Valuable player, and became the first African American to get the award.\nBoth head coaches in the game were University of Tennessee graduates who had played under legendary coach Robert Neyland.\nGame facts.\nAll-American defensive tackle Bobby Bell played in both the 1961 and 1962 Rose Bowls for the Gophers. He later played in two Super Bowls with the Kansas City Chiefs, I and IV, winning the latter in January 1970."

The school's team currently competes in the Horizon League at the NCAA Division I level. The Raiders won their only national championship in 1983 as an NCAA Division II school. They have made a total of four NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament appearances. The Raiders play their home games at the Nutter Center and are led by head coach Clint Sargent.\nHistory.\nWright State first sponsored men's basketball in 1970 under the direction of Coach John Ross. Players from the first team included Doug Meeks (Captain), Mark Beilinski, Jerry Butcher, Mark Donahue, Jerry Hecht, John Hildebrand, Chuck Horton, Jim Schellhase, Doug Taylor, Jim Thacker. Mike Zink. Paul Brown, and Gary Webb. Jim Thacker was named the MVP and Chuck Horton, Mark Donahue and John Hildebrand took the foul shooting honors. In 1983, Wright State won the Division II NCAA tournament.

His philosophy was up-tempo and high-scoring: \"Basketball is a spectator sport and we aim to entertain the people . . . We will not be robots on the basketball court. We intend to make WSU basketball an exciting sport for all concerned and form a lasting impression on our fans.\"\nAfter taking some lumps as a young team in 1976–77, by 1977–78 Jackson had his Raiders running hot again, but a losing streak at the end of the season and arguments with the athletic administration brought his tenure to an early end. Jackson's legacy at Wright State was laying a solid foundation that helped to launch the high-flying basketball years that followed.\nRalph Underhill era (1978–1996).\nRalph Underhill was the most successful coach in Wright State history, with a career total of 356 wins, including leading the team to an NCAA Division II National Championship in the 1982–83 season.\nIn 1999–2000 Israel Sheinfeld playing for the Raiders led the Midwestern Collegiate Conference in field goal percentage, at .543, and in rebounds per game, at 7.7. He was named to the 2000 All-MCC first team. In 2000–2001 he led the conference in two-point field goal percentage, at .595.\nPaul Biancardi era (2003–2005).\nOn April 8, 2003, Wright State announced that Paul Biancardi would be the new head coach. Before coaching Wright State, Biancardi was an assistant at St. Louis, Boston College and Ohio State where he coached under Jim O'Brien. Recognized nationally, Biancardi was named the No. 1 assistant coach in the country by Hoop Scoop Online. In his first season as coach, Wright State finished with a 14–14 record and finished 5th in the Horizon League Standings with a 10–6 conference record and lost to Loyola (IL) in the first round of the conference tournament. In the 2004–2005 season Wright State would finish with a 15–15 while finishing 6th in the conference standings with an 8–8 record. During the Horizon League tournament the Raiders would beat Butler in the first round but lost to Detroit in the second round. In 2005–2006, Wright State's final record was 13–15, with an 8–8 conference record they would finish 7th in the standings. The Raiders would once again have an early exit from the Horizon League tournament, losing to UIC in the first round. Despite never having a winning season in the three seasons that Biancardi coached at Wright State, it was his recruiting classes that would set the Raiders up for success in the future. Wright State and Biancardi agreed to part after the NCAA barred him from recruiting for violating rules while he was an assistant at Ohio State. Biancardi's final record at Wright State was 42–44.\nBrad Brownell era (2006–2009).\nBrad Brownell left his position with UNC-Wilmington to take over the head coaching duties at Wright State beginning in the 2006–2007 basketball season. In his first season, Wright State was the regular season Horizon League Champion, going 23–10 overall, and 13–3 in conference play. Their 3 losses were at Youngstown State, at Butler, and at Milwaukee. In an impressive season, Wright State only lost one home game all season, that was a 3-point loss to Bowling Green. In the Horizon League Championship game, Wright State edged Butler 60–55 at the Nutter Center, and secured an automatic bid in the NCAA tournament. They eventually earned a 14 seed, and lost in the first round to the Pittsburgh Panthers.\nThe next three seasons were not as successful for Brownell as his first. Wright State finished 3rd, 3rd, and 2nd respectfully over the 2007, 2008, and 2009 seasons. However, Brad did lead Wright State to 20-win seasons in each of his four years with the program. After the conclusion of the 2009–2010 season, Brad Brownell left Wright State to take the head coaching job at Clemson University.\nBrownell finished his coaching at Wright State officially 84–45 and 49–21 in conference play in 4 completed seasons. More impressively, Brownell finished 58–10 in home contests over his 4-year tenure.\nBilly Donlon era (2010–2016).\nBilly Donlon took over the Wright State Men's Basketball program in 2010 after the announcement that Brad Brownell would be leaving for Clemson. In the 2012–2013 season, after being projected to finish last in the league, Wright State finished 3rd in the Horizon League, and earned a first round bye in the Horizon League tournament. Wright State would beat Youngstown State in the second round of the tournament to advance to the conference semi-finals where they would play the defending Horizon League tournament champion Detroit. Miles Dixon hit a baseline jumper from behind the backboard as time expired, lifting Wright State into the Horizon League tournament championship game for the first time since the 2009–2010 season. The team went on to lose to Valparaiso in the Horizon League Championship game by 6 points. Wright State was invited to the College Basketball Invitational where they would make it to the semi-finals before losing to eventual tournament champion Tulsa. Billy Donlon also earned the Horizon League Coach of the Year award for Wright State's performance in the 2012–2013 season.\nOver his six seasons he accumulated an overall record 109–94 vs DI and non DI competition.\nScott Nagy era (2016–2024).\nFollowing the firing of Billy Donlon after the 2015–2016 season, Wright State hired then South Dakota State University head coach Scott Nagy to head their program. He is the highest paid coach in Raider history with an annual salary of $500k. In Nagy's first season the Raiders went 20–12 and 11–7 in league. The Raiders lost to NKU in the 4/5 match-up in the Horizon League Tournament. The Raiders chose not to participate in postseason play.\nIn his second season, Nagy's Raiders finished second in the Horizon League regular season (even though they swept #1 seed NKU) with a conference record of 14–4. The Raiders won the Horizon League Tournament and clinched their first NCAA tournament berth since 2007.\nHis Raiders teams continued to set the standard in the Horizon league reeling off 20 win seasons and returning to the NCAA tournament in 2022. However, his final two seasons were marked by inconsistent play, poor defense and multiple player defections. The frustration seemed to mount with each passing week, culminating with Nagy leaving for the head coaching job at Southern Illinois.\nRetired numbers.\nWright State has retired one jersey number in its history.\nFacilities.\nThe Wright State Raiders currently play their home games at the Ervin J. Nutter Center. Ervin J. Nutter, donated $1.5 million to Wright State University in 1986. Funds from both the state of Ohio and the university contributed an additional $8 million to construction efforts which began in 1988. Completed in 1990, Wright State would host the first event on December 1 where they would defeat Tennessee State 88–66.\nCoaches.\nThe Raiders have had 10 coaches. Current head coach Clint Sargent was hired in 2024. Scott Nagy was the head coach from 2016 to 2024. Billy Donlon was the head coach from 2010 to 2016 after Brad Brownell was announced as the new Clemson head coach. Brownell was the second coach to take Wright State to the NCAA tournament following the winningest coach in team history, Ralph Underhill. Underhill coached from 1978 to 1996 and accumulated 356 wins at Wright State and an NCAA DII national championship in the 1982–83 season.\nSeasons.\nWSU's records season by season during their Division II tenure.\nWSU's records season by season since joining Division I in 1987.\nRivalries.\nDayton.\nThe Wright State University and University of Dayton series is known as the Gem City Jam. The two universities are located in Dayton, Ohio, only 10 miles apart from each other. Although the two schools no longer compete head to head in men's basketball, they still compete against each other in other sports. The series currently favors Dayton at 5–3. The last meeting was held at the University of Dayton on December 13, 1997; Dayton won 94–63.\nNorthern Kentucky.\nThe Wright State and Northern Kentucky series began in 1972 where both schools would routinely compete against each other up until 1987 when Wright State moved to division 1.

        "text": " Mount Hood is an 18-hole golf club and park located in Melrose, Massachusetts. It was built in the 1930s on donated land as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration and once consisted of a ski area. Today, Mount Hood serves as a golf course and park, while sledding is popular in the winter.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nThe land that comprises Mount Hood was donated to the City of Melrose and developed as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration in the early 1930s. The original complex consisted of a nine-hole golf course, a clubhouse, Slayton Tower, a wooden toboggan track that ran from the clubhouse, over Stillman Road and down the first hole fairway, and a ski jump, credited as being the first of its kind in New England. Also built were two cabins: one for the Girl Scouts of the USA and one for the Boy Scouts of America.\nSlayton Tower was built to house a small Army outpost assigned to look out over the Atlantic Ocean for German U-boats during World War II. From the top, one can see the entire Revere Beach area and also part of Lynn Beach.\nWhen winter arrived, the park was used for various activities including skiing, sledding, and skating. In addition to the toboggan run and ski jump, there was also a rope tow to bring skiers and sledders from the bottom of the slope—officially named the Arthur L. Delaney Ski Slope—to the top. Skating on the first pond was also popular and the area was lit, allowing activities to continue into the night.\nCurrent conditions.\nSince the closing of the ski area, estimated to be around 1971, Mount Hood has functioned as both a park and a golf course. Its various hiking and biking trails offer a way to get away from the busy city life and the park also contains a tot lot for children. There are also several ponds where ice skating and fishing are allowed. Though the ski resort no longer exists, sledding is popular in the winter.\nThe size of Mount Hood golf course was increased from nine to eighteen holes and today it offers challenge and variety unique in the Boston area. In the midst of a wooded park, from the Zakim Bridge it boasts views of nearby Boston, Revere Beach and the wilderness. Notable of the course is that eight of the eighteen tees are elevated allowing high tee shots as well as views from Boston to New Hampshire."

        "text": "Robert L. Davis (February 13, 1908 – January 10, 1965) was an American football coach. He served as the head football coach at Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts—now known as Colorado State University—from 1947 to 1955. Davis was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah and played his collegiate football at the University of Utah under Ike Armstrong. Quarterback and team captain in 1929, Davis lead Utah to the conference championship, graduating in 1930. He coached at South Salt Lake City High School, Weber Junior College, and was an assistant coach at the University of Utah and the University of Denver before being named as the head coach of football at Colorado A&amp;M College on January 6, 1947.\nDavis utilized the T formation and veterans returning from World War II to turn around a 2–7 Aggies team in 1946 to an 8–2 team in 1948; placing second in the Skyline Conference. Upon turning the Aggies around in 1948, Colorado A&amp;M was invited to and played in the 1949 Raisin Bowl in Fresno, California against Occidental. Only losing 21–20 in the last minutes of the game, Davis' 1949 team went on to a 9–1 record and placed second again. Davis was a revolutionary coach utilizing classroom football along with practice and game films to help his players excel. Davis also played black athletes, such as Eddie Hanna, George Jones and Alex Burl, in a predominantly white school.\nSeveral of Davis' players went on to play in the National Football League (NFL), including Dale Dodrill, Thurman \"Fum\" McGraw, Jim David, Don Burroughs, Jack Christiansen, Alex Burl and Gary Glick. Three of his players were All-Americans; Thurman \"Fum\" Mcgraw (first team 1948, 1949), Harvey Achziger (first team 1952) and Gary Glick (second team 1955). Davis' 1955 team won the Skyline Conference championship, but following the season he resigned from coaching football to concentrate on his duties as athletic director, a post he had held since 1953. His departure began a four-decade downturn in the Rams' fortunes; he was the last coach to leave Fort Collins with a winning record until Sonny Lubick's tenure.\nDavis continued as athletic director when Colorado A&amp;M became Colorado State University in 1957 and is responsible for paving the way to construct Moby Arena and Hughes Stadium during the campus' rebirth. Davis died while serving as athletic director on January 10, 1965, following a lengthy illness."

It is often seen as being representative of Sussex as a county.\nCricket in Sussex saw a revival during the Regency period that coincided with the rise of Brighton as a fashionable resort. The club had been founded by 1790 when it was recorded playing in four minor matches against other town clubs. In 1791, the Prince of Wales Ground became a first-class venue when Sussex played Middlesex.\nBrighton played at the Prince of Wales Ground initially. As the towns of Brighton and Hove developed, the land was sold a few years later and the cricket club moved to a new site in Brighton at Temple Fields, which was where Montpelier Crescent is now. From July 1814, the club occupied the Royal New Ground (also known as Thomas Box's Ground), another Brighton venue, which was used for 49 major matches until September 1847 and was the county ground of Sussex CCC in its early years.\nThe Brighton club was often representative of Sussex as a county and it ultimately became one of the main interests in the formation of Sussex County Cricket Club in 1839.\nBrighton and Hove Cricket Club maintained close connections to Brighton Cricket Club prior to the later becoming Sussex County Cricket Club.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s up to the present day a number of cricket professionals having played for Brighton and Hove have gone on to play for Sussex, Middlesex, Surrey and other counties and countries most notably England, Pakistan and South Africa.\nThe brothers Wells Colin and Alan played for Brighton and Hove Cricket Club before Alan represented England against the West Indies and Colin (Sussex), also brothers Willows Alan represented Sussex and Roly Middlesex during the 1970s and 1980s both played for Brighton and Hove.

Peter Elliott stayed on the rail slightly off the lead through the first lap joined by Stephen Ole Marai on the outside and Tom McKean boxed on the inside. Through the penultimate turn, these three tried to move forward, Elliott moving outside to the shoulders of the lead pack, followed by Mara and McKean, but McKean was held inside. By the time they reached the backstretch, McKean tried again to run around Marai, this time he tripped over Marai, injuring himself, eventually falling out the back of the field. Konchellah caught Barbosa at the end of the straightaway and went into the lead. Elliott tried to follow, but Barbosa held him off through the turn. By the end of the turn, the three medalists had separated from the rest of the field, Lahbi the last to hold on. As Konchellah sprinted away to victory, Barbosa and Elliott both started sprinting for home in chase. Barbosa came off the turn a bit wide, leaving room for Elliott to slowly edge his way along the rail and ahead of Barbosa to take the silver."

He had previously been named as a first-team tackle on the East Coast Athletic Conference all-conference team in 1968, his senior season at Villanova. Moore went on to play for two seasons with the Packers. He tore an Achilles tendon in a win over the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1970 season, and had surgery shortly thereafter, putting him out for the season. After trying him on offense during training camp in 1971, the Packers traded him to the New England Patriots for linebacker John Bramlett in late July 1971. However, Moore was unable to play for the Patriots in 1971 due to injury. He was then released by the Patriots in June 1972.\nMoore's only known statistic is a single fumble recovery in the 1969 season. His son, Brandon Moore, later played offensive tackle for the New England Patriots from 1993 through 1995.\nThe 1969 Packers draft.\nMoore's selection is still remembered by Packers fans and observers as one of the most ill-fated in team history. Multiple writers have listed his selection as one of the most disappointing Packers draft picks of all time (though most do not make note of his career-ending injury). Packers' head coach Phil Bengtson overruled personnel director Pat Peppler, who had rated other players higher and who thought Moore would be available later in the draft. Vince Lombardi was still the Packers' general manager during the draft, but he was in negotiations to become head coach and general manager of the Washington Redskins, a deal which was finalized the next week. Peppler later said, \"Rich Moore was a disaster. Phil Bengtson fell in love with his size.\" Three players available when the Packers took Moore went on the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Roger Wehrli, Ted Hendricks and Charlie Joiner, and they also passed up other players who starred in the NFL for many years, such as Fred Dryer, Calvin Hill and Ed White. Other Packers selections in the 1969 draft were also weak. The Packers' next pick, second round choice Dave Bradley, played in only 16 games in a career that ended in 1972, and by 1974 not one 1969 Packers pick remained on the team. Only 9th round choice Dave Hampton was in the NFL at all by 1975, finishing his NFL career with the Falcons and Eagles in 1976."

The great Glen Gray fell dead.\"\nGray was born in Charlotteville, Ontario, Canada, and attended North Tonawanda High School, where he graduated in 1906. He was a quarterback and kicker on the football team where he played for coach Ben Hinkey. \"Glen Gray as I remember him was not the agile, hip-swiveling runner many people might imagine,\" Hinkey recalled. \"He had, I believe, a wonderful change of pace and an ability to stop short when travelling at top speed, and then sidestepping a tackler quickly. He was an awfully hard man to tackle, because his speed and stopping ability were so hard to judge.\"\nGray also starred on the track team, where he was a long jumper. He graduated in 1911. He was inducted in the Oberlin College Sports Hall of Fame in 1986."

He won 27 caps for Wales and was selected to play in the British Lions on two tours of Australia and New Zealand.\nAfter his rugby career Thomas became a successful business man. He died on 9 April 2012 in Burnham, Buckinghamshire.\nEarly and club career.\nBorn in Machen in 1929, Thomas went to school at Bassaleg Grammar and was chosen for the Welsh Secondary Schools rugby and cricket teams, before attending Caerleon Training College. After qualifying from college he became an instructor-lieutenant in the Royal Navy, playing for and captaining Devonport Services before playing for the Navy XV.\nHe joined Newport in 1946 and played against South Africa (1952), New Zealand (1954) and Australia (1957) for the club. A versatile player, Thomas found himself being moved between centre and wing and was chosen many times due to his ability as a utility back. He was also recognized as an accurate placekicker and was strong in the tackle, with a powerful hand-off. Thomas also represented Cornwall and Monmouthsire at county level, and played invitational matches for the Barbarians and Crawshays. In 1958 ha was a member of the 1958 touring Barbarian team that played in Africa, scoring a try and two conversions in the win over East Africa.\nHe also played cricket for Cornwall in the 1951 Minor Counties Championship, making four appearances.\nInternational career.\nThomas made his debut against France in 1949 in an away game at the Stade de Colombes, Paris, which Wales lost. The selectors kept faith with Thomas and he turned out for the next four Five Nations Tournament games, which saw Wales win the Grand Slam in 1950, the first time since 1911. Thomas was also part of the Wales Grand Slam team in 1952. In 1953 he was dropped from the squad as the selectors believed his play was becoming stale and was blamed for a bad pass in the game against England. In a 1954/55 pre-season club trial he broke a leg, however he was back playing for Newport the next season and a return to club form saw his return to the Welsh side. On 19 January 1957 he was awarded the captaincy of Wales against England, and again later in the season against Scotland.\nInternational matches played.\nWales\nBritish Lions"

The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues.

All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall.

        "title": "1966 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1966 Rose Bowl was the 52nd edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Saturday, January 1. The fifth-ranked UCLA Bruins of the AAWU (Pac-8) upset the undefeated and top-ranked Michigan State Spartans of the Big Ten Conference, 14–12. UCLA defensive back Bob Stiles, a junior college transfer, was named the Player of the Game.\nTeams.\nThe game was a rematch of the season opener in East Lansing that Michigan State won, 13–3. Unknown UCLA quarterback Gary Beban had a long touchdown pass play nullified by a penalty in that game. As it turned out, UCLA gave MSU one of its toughest games of the season in its home opener, a fact that was apparently forgotten when the 14-point odds came out favoring MSU for the Rose Bowl re-match. The two previous meetings also were won by Michigan State in January 1954 and 1956.\nMichigan State Spartans.\nMichigan State was undefeated and winner of the AFCA National Championship Trophy given to the team ranked #1 in the nation in early December, after the regular season, but before postseason bowl games. Regular season opponents Michigan (-51), Ohio State (-22), and Notre Dame (-12) each had negative yards rushing. Their key victory was a 32–7 win over Ohio State that ultimately decided the Big Ten Conference title as the Spartans finished one game ahead of the Buckeyes.\nThe Spartans featured future College Football Hall of Fame members split end Gene Washington, defensive end Charles \"Bubba\" Smith, roverback George \"Mickey\" Webster, and halfback Clint Jones. Webster is credited with creating the roverback position. In the first round of the 1967 NFL/AFL Draft, the first overall pick was Smith by the Baltimore Colts, the second was Jones by the Minnesota Vikings, the fifth was Webster by the Houston Oilers, and the eighth pick was Washington, also by the Minnesota Vikings. They were the first group of four African-American members of the college football hall of fame from the same class. Smith was a defensive end and Webster was a safety on Sports Illustrated's NCAA football all-century team in 1999. In the second round of the 1966 NFL Draft, Harold Lucas was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals.\nUCLA Bruins.\nUCLA lost the season opener at Michigan State 13–3, upset highly regarded Syracuse and Penn State, tied at Missouri 14–14, then won four straight. Going into the rivalry game against USC on November 20, UCLA was ranked seventh, with the conference championship and Rose Bowl were on the line. The sixth-ranked Trojans, led by Heisman trophy winner Mike Garrett led 16–6 until UCLA got a touchdown on a pass from Gary Beban to Dick Witcher with four minutes to play. After the two-point conversion made it 16–14, UCLA recovered an onside kick. Beban then hit Kurt Altenberg on a fifty-yard bomb and UCLA won, 20–16. \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Jim Murray did not like the Bruins chances.\nUCLA then faced Tennessee on December 4 in the new Liberty Bowl in Memphis, the native city of UCLA head coach Tommy Prothro. On the last play of a wild game, defensive back Bob Petrella intercepted a UCLA pass to save a 37–34 Volunteer win. Prothro was uncharacteristically upset. He criticized a pass interference penalty, a phantom holding call on end Byron Nelson that nullified a key UCLA play, claimed that the clock had been wrongly stopped twice on Tennessee's winning drive, and said that a dropped pass was a lateral and a fumble. He stated, \"For the first time in my life, I am ashamed to be a Southerner.\"\nThe 1965 team was nicknamed the \"Gutty little Bruins\" as the defensive line was small with John Richardson at , Steve Butler at , and defensive tackles Al Claman and Terry Donahue. By comparison, the Spartan defensive line included middle guard Harold Lucas who weighed and Bubba Smith who was and . Even Michigan State roverback Webster weighed as much as the heaviest UCLA defensive lineman at .\nGame summary.\nNew Year's Day was on Saturday in 1966, and the Pasadena weather was sunny and . Michigan State was a two-touchdown favorite, and the consensus #1 ranked team, but the undersized Bruins held their own through a scoreless first quarter – even after future Heisman Trophy and Maxwell Award winner Gary Beban ran 27 yards on the Bruins first play from scrimmage. Sophomore Beban surprised Michigan State's defense with a head fake quarterback off-guard run reminiscent of an old single-wing formation tailback off-tackle run play. Beban ran a similar play two years before at Sequoia High School where he was an All America candidate. At the time, he spoke of wanting to playing for Notre Dame but was disappointed that he didn't get a scholarship. UCLA end Byron Nelson stripped the ball from punt returner Don Japinga, co-captain of the Spartans, and center John Erquiaga of UCLA recovered at the Michigan State six-yard line. Beban carried the ball around left end on a quarterback keeper and was stopped at the one by Webster as the quarter ended.\nOn the first play of the second quarter, Beban took it in from one yard out on a quarterback sneak to give the Bruins a surprising lead over the stunned Spartans. Then Prothro went into his bag of tricks and called for an onside kick. Kicker Kurt Zimmerman executed it perfectly and linebacker Dallas Grider fell on the ball. Halfback Mel Farr ran for 21 yards to the Spartan 22. In preparation for the game, UCLA assistant coach Pepper Rodgers had designed a formation called shadow set, in which wide receivers Altenberg and Witcher lined up one behind the other . From the shadow set, Beban then called the pass play \"Michigan spread left post\", and threaded a pass between three Spartan defenders to Kurt Altenberg, who made a great catch that put UCLA on the one yard-line. Beban then scored on a short run to make it 14–0. Later in the second quarter, the Spartans drove deep into UCLA territory led by quarterback and co-captain Steve Juday. Their drive was stopped by a fumble during a quarterback scramble. Juday, even though untouched by any UCLA tackler, lost control of the football and UCLA co-captain and defensive end Jim Colletto recovered at the UCLA 19 . Another drive came up empty when just before the half, Dick Kenney, the Spartan barefoot kicker from Hawaii, missed a field goal from the 23-yard line.\nUCLA's undersized defense continued to play well in the third quarter, but the larger Spartans were beginning to wear them down and began picking up bigger and bigger chunks of yardage on the ground.\nWith just over six minutes remaining, Michigan State began a drive from their own 20-yard line. Juday passed to Gene Washington for 42 yards to the UCLA 38. They finally broke through for a touchdown when their large Samoan fullback Bob Apisa took a lateral from sophomore quarterback Jimmy Raye and scored on a 38-yard run. On the point after, Michigan State faked the kick and went for a two-point conversion. Pressured by UCLA defensive end Jerry Klein, Juday's pass failed and UCLA led 14–6. Michigan State got the ball back at the UCLA 49 after Bubba Smith partly blocked a punt by UCLA punter Larry Cox. The Spartans began to march down field in the waning moments, switching on this drive to a two-quarterback system. They alternated Juday and Raye with Daugherty sending in the plays. Three times in this final drive the Spartans went for it on fourth down and picked up the first down. A pass to fullback Eddie Cotton brought the ball to the one-yard line. With thirty-one seconds to play, Juday scored on a quarterback sneak. Trailing 14–12, Daughterty had the Spartans line up on the left hash mark for a two-point conversion attempt. On a play called \"option pitch\", Raye tossed the football to the sophomore Apisa who ran to the right, and as he turned the corner, it appeared he would fall into the end zone to tie the game. (This would not have resulted in overtime; tie games until the 1996 season) But Apisa was forced by Colletto to run parallel to the goal line. Then Apisa was slowed down by Grider. Finally, Stiles ran full speed and threw himself into Apisa. Although Apisa knocked Stiles unconscious, Stiles' sacrifice kept Apisa out of the end zone. The Spartans then tried an onside kick but UCLA recovered.\n\"We fell victim to the distractions,\" Juday later said at a 2015 reunion.\nAftermath.\nUntil the 1974 season, the final UPI Coaches' poll was taken after the regular season but before the bowl games, so Michigan State retained its top ranking in the UPI. The AP took its first-ever post-bowl vote this season. Earlier in the day, second-ranked Arkansas was upset by LSU in the Cotton Bowl. In the final major bowl that night, Alabama, ranked fourth with a record of 8–1–1 and led by quarterback Steve Sloan, handed undefeated and third-ranked Nebraska a 39–28 loss in the Orange Bowl. The Crimson Tide was voted first in the AP poll with Michigan State falling to second; UCLA ended up ranked fourth in AP, fifth in UPI.\nIn a 1995 vote of the greatest moments in Los Angeles sports history, Bob Stiles' stop of Bob Apisa on the goal line ranked #26. The defeat of USC in the rivalry game to get to the Rose Bowl ranked #35.\nIt was Prothro's second straight Rose Bowl, but also his last, as rival USC went to the next four. In 1966, the Trojans were voted in ahead of the Bruins despite UCLA's 14–7 win over USC. In 1967, a spectacular run by O. J. Simpson gave USC the bid and the national championship. In the 1969 game, a battle of undefeated teams, USC again prevailed, 14–12.\nKurt Altenberg died in 2005. The 1965 Bruins were honored as co-captains in 2015 on October 31 (against Cal), as part of the 50th anniversary celebration."

He appeared in two games for the Detroit Heralds in 1920 and in three games for the Detroit Tigers in 1921.\nMiller died in 1987 from injuries suffered in a fire at his home in Lansing, Michigan at the age of 97. He was inducted into the Michigan State Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005."

        "title": "Cricket in Pakistan",
        "text": "The history of cricket in Pakistan predates the creation of the country in 1947. The first international cricket match in what is now Pakistan today was held in Karachi on 22 November 1935 between Sindh and Australia (see Figure 1). The match was seen by 5,000 Karachiites. Cricket was introduced by the British during their colonial rule of British India, which covered the area now known as Pakistan. Cricket is the most popular sport in the country. The Pakistan Cricket Board controls all domestic cricket in Pakistan and the national teams. Pakistan is an official member of the International Cricket Council and the Asian Cricket Council. Regarded as one of the best and most passionate cricketing nations, Pakistan has won the Cricket World Cup in 1992, ICC T20 World Cup in 2009, the ICC Champions Trophy in 2017, the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2004 and 2006, the ACC Asia Cup in 2000 and 2012. Pakistan were runner ups in the 1999 Cricket World Cup and 2007 and 2022 T20 World Cups. Pakistan have also been runner ups in several Asia Cup editions.\nOrganisation and history.\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board governs all official domestic tournaments. Pakistan is also an official member of the International Cricket Council and the Asian Cricket Council. Almost all cities and villages in Pakistan have their own cricket teams and unofficial tournaments. Pakistani children start playing cricket at a young age.\nThe game is the most popular sport in the country with the tape ball variety of the game being the most common. A tape ball is a tennis ball wrapped in electrical tape and is used in playing backyard cricket. This modification of the tennis ball gives it greater weight, speed and distance while still being easier to play with than the conventional cricket ball. The variation was pioneered in Karachi, Pakistan and is credited with Pakistan's famous production of fast bowlers as children are brought up playing the game using a tape ball in which various skills are developed. The increasing popularity of the tape ball in informal, local cricket has transformed the way games are played in cricket-loving nations such as India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh but most famously Pakistan. Such has been the impact of \"tape ball\" that in recent years some companies have introduced tennis balls designed to act like cricket balls. These balls are quite popular in South Asia where tape ball cricket is one of the most popular forms of the sport.\nProfessional cricket has been played in Pakistan since its formation in 1947:\nInternational cricket.\nCricket is considered the most popular sport in Pakistan. After the partition of India in 1947 and the formation of Pakistan, Pakistan played its first official match in 1952 under the captaincy of Abdul Kardar against the republic of India in 1952 registering their first Test victory in Lucknow. Women's cricket developed later in Pakistan with the women's national team playing their first match in 1997.\nThe national cricket team of Pakistan is governed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) - a permanent member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Pakistan national teams regularly participate in international home and away series - with the major series being against arch-rival India. In addition, the Pakistan men's national team participates in the following major international tournaments:\nPakistan men's national team has had success on the international stage having a best international ranking of 1st in the Test, ODI and T20I cricket. In terms of tournament success:\nFrom 2009 to 2019 Pakistan was unable to host international matches in Pakistan after the terror attack on the touring Sri Lanka cricket team. This decade led to little or no international cricket taking place in Pakistan and Pakistan played its home series in the UAE (specifically Dubai and Abu Dhabi). As the security situation improved, in September 2019, international test cricket returned to Pakistan with the visit of Sri Lanka. By the end of 2022, almost all the leading Test playing nations had toured the country again. The 2023 ACC Asia Cup and the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy are scheduled to be held in Pakistan.\nThe Pakistan women's national cricket team has had moderate success on the international stage and is in development. However, the team is regularly ranked in the top 10 in the world. Thus far the women's national team has not won an ICC or ACC international tournament.\nDomestic cricket.\nThe structure of domestic cricket in Pakistan at the highest level has changed many times since 1947 with the latest restructure being in 2019. Previously domestic cricket operated with departmental, city and regional teams - a set up encouraged by Abdul Hafeez Kardar. Since 1947, the domestic first class cricket system has varied considerably per year with teams ranging from 7 to 26 and tournament matches operating under different formats (often changes occurred every year). With the advent of domestic List A and T20 forms of cricket in the 1970s and 2000s, there has been no consistent set up (as has been noted for first class cricket in Pakistan). Historically, school and club cricket has also suffered due to inconsistencies in top tier domestic cricket. The consistent changes in the domestic structure and the gradual introduction of departmental teams was encouraged as it provided permanent jobs to players. Matches were rarely televised due to lack of quality cricket and lack of interest in departmental cricket. This inconsistent system was widely criticised on the basis of low quality cricket and reduced competition.\nIn 2019, six regional teams were created on provincial lines. The teams would compete in the principal competitions in all three forms of the game: the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (First Class), Pakistan Cup (List A) and National T20 Cup (Domestic T20). The PCB's rationale in reducing the number of teams in domestic cricket was to concentrate talent in order to increase competition and improve the quality of cricket. The new structure also consisted of corresponding second XI, under-19, under-16 and under-13 competitions, and live television coverage of top level matches. The restructuring also reorganised district level cricket into a three tier bottom-up system, with 90 city cricket associations supervising school and club cricket at grassroots level, and inter-city tournaments providing a stepping-stone to the six elite regional teams. AFP Sport examines three areas where Babar Azam’s side is struggling The three tier bottom-up system can be summarised as follows\nThe six regional teams (operated by respective six cricket associations) ensure that the affairs of the associations at city level are regulated. They frame policies that will develop cricket at the grassroots, manage club cricket in collaboration with the 90 city associations and also oversee intra-city competitions. The teams are responsible for revenue generation through sponsorship, marketing and strategic collaborations with business conglomerates. Each of the six regional teams have a chief executive officer and a management committee that has been tasked with supervising all cricketing activities. These changes have been made by the PCB in order to decentralise the administrative body so that it can limit itself to a supervisory role by delegating responsibilities related to the development of the sport to the provincial associations. This tiered structure has been enshrined in the PCB constitution.\nAn nationwide inter-city franchise T20 tournament, the Pakistan Super League, was inaugurated in 2016. In 2021, a franchise T20 tournament based in Kashmir was launched, titled the Kashmir Premier League.\nRegional domestic tournaments.\nThe main regional domestic cricket tournaments in Pakistan for men are contested by six elite regional teams with the cricket season starting in October and concluding in March. Second XI teams of the six regional teams compete in parallel competitions, and there are age group pathway tournaments at national, regional and local level. The elite tournaments are:\nWomen's domestic cricket tournaments take place between four teams. The main elite tournaments are:\nFranchise tournaments.\nThe main franchise domestic T20 cricket tournaments in Pakistan are:\nCricket stadiums.\nPakistan is home to several cricket stadiums with the major/popular cricket stadiums (by province/territory) being as follows:\nSindh\nPunjab\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa\nBalochistan\nAzad Kashmir\nGilgit-Baltistan"

        "title": "1983 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1983 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game, played on January 1, 1983. It was the 69th Rose Bowl Game. The UCLA Bruins defeated the Michigan Wolverines by a score of 24–14, in a bowl rematch of a regular season game, also won by UCLA. Tom Ramsey, UCLA quarterback and Don Rogers, UCLA defensive back, were named the Players Of The Game. This was the first season that the UCLA Bruins played in the Rose Bowl stadium as their home stadium, where they were undefeated.\nThis was the second consecutive Rose Bowl win for the Pac-10, with eight wins in the last nine.\nTeams.\nThis game was the third meeting between the UCLA Bruins and the Michigan Wolverines in a 366-day span. They met on December 31, 1981, in the Bluebonnet Bowl. Michigan won that game 33–14, which was the first Big Ten/Pac-10 bowl meeting outside the Rose Bowl. As such, it was labeled the \"mini Rose Bowl.\"\nDuring the regular season on September 25, UCLA played the Wolverines at Michigan Stadium. Quarterback Steve Smith's six-yard run gave Michigan a 14–0 lead and after the Wolverines blocked a Bruin punt and took possession on the UCLA seven, Smith's five-yard pass to Anthony Carter made the score 21–0 with 12:57 remaining in the second quarter.\nThe Bruins scored two touchdowns and were behind 21–14 at the half in the game at Ann Arbor with one second left to play. The Bruin players headed for the locker room. They had to come back out because Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler had called a time-out with one second left. Ali Haji-Sheikh kicked a 47-yard field goal to increase Michigan's lead to 24–14. When UCLA coach Terry Donahue began to argue with the referees, Schembechler reportedly ran past and screamed, \"That's three more points, Terry!\" In the second half, the Bruins topped off their greatest point deficit comeback in their history. The Bruins put 17 more points in the second half, while allowing Michigan just one more field goal. An interception by Don Rogers on the second play of the second half gave the Bruins the ball on the Michigan 22-yard line for their first possession of the half. Quarterback Tom Ramsey connected on a six-yard touchdown pass to JoJo Townsell to make it 24–21. Another Michigan field goal pushed the UM advantage up to 27–21 with 4:32 remaining in the third quarter. Dokie Williams returned the ensuing kickoff 65 yards and the Bruins took it in from there on a two-yard run by Kevin Nelson. John Lee's extra point put the Bruins in the lead at 28–27 with 2:50 to play in the third quarter. UCLA won 31–27, overcoming a 21–0 deficit, in what stood as one of the greatest comebacks in Bruin football history until the 2005 Sun Bowl.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nMichigan started the season 1–2, losing 23–17 at Notre Dame, and losing at home to UCLA 31–27. The Wolverines did not lose again until the final regular season game, falling at rival Ohio State 24–14 after having already clinched the Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl berth.\nUCLA Bruins.\nThe Rose Bowl in Pasadena became UCLA's home stadium this season, after decades at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Head coach Terry Donahue made a promise that UCLA would end their season in the Rose Bowl game. UCLA opened with 4 straight wins, was tied by Arizona 24–24, then won another three games before a seemingly crushing loss at Washington 10–7. That game gave the Huskies the Pac-10 lead and inside track to the Rose Bowl. UCLA recovered to sneak by John Elway and Stanford 38–35, and went into their game with rival USC needing to beat the Trojans, have fifth-ranked Washington lose at struggling Washington State, AND #8 Arizona State lose at Arizona.\nOn November 20, the improbable happened. The Bruins beat the Trojans 20–19, when after USC scored a touchdown on the final play of the game, Karl Morgan sacked Scott Tinsley on the two-point conversion attempt to preserve the win. That same day, Washington was upset 24–20 by Washington State in Pullman. The story of the day that overshadowed these circumstances however, was The Play, with Cal defeating Stanford in the Big Game. One week later, Arizona knocked off Arizona State 28–18 and the Bruins were in the Rose Bowl.\nGame summary.\nUsing a balanced attack led by QB Tom Ramsey, UCLA took a 10–0 lead in the second quarter. In addition, a hard hit by UCLA defensive back Don Rogers separated Michigan QB Steve Smith's shoulder and knocked him out of the game. But backup David Hall got the Wolverines on the board in the third quarter, making the score 10–7. The key drive was early in the third quarter when Tom Ramsey completed seven straight passes, converted numerous 3rd downs, and led UCLA on a brilliant time-consuming drive that was capped by Danny Andrews' 9-yard touchdown run to make the score 17–7.\nIn the fourth quarter, UCLA got an interception inside the Michigan 20-yard line and scored again for an insurmountable 24–7 lead. Michigan got one last late touchdown for the final score of 24–14. UCLA played a nearly flawless game, with no turnovers and no penalties until taking an intentional delay of game penalty while running out the clock. In the post-game interview it was noted that UCLA was able to neutralize Anthony Carter. Terry Donahue remarked that the loss of Steve Smith was a contributing factor.\nAftermath.\nDon Rogers would set an interception record in next year's game, as UCLA repeated as champions. UCLA under Donahue and Michigan under Schembechler met once more, during the 1989 regular season at the Rose Bowl. On September 23, 1989, #5 ranked Michigan defeated #24 ranked UCLA 24–23. This was the first victory of a ten-game winning streak that propelled the Wolverines to the 1990 Rose Bowl."

        "title": "White-collar boxing",
        "text": "White-collar boxing is a form of boxing in which people in white-collar professions train to fight at special events. Most have had no prior boxing experience.\nEarly history.\nWhite-collar boxing has its beginnings at Gleason's Gym in New York City. Gym owner Bruce Silverglade began organizing informal fights between the white-collar workers of his clientele in the late 1980s, which later developed into regular monthly events. After developing into a regular monthly event, the sport came to prominence in the mid-1990s under the organization of boxing promoter Alan Lacey. Alan, along with business partners, went on to promote white-collar boxing in the United Kingdom. Other shows like Celebrity Fight Night went on to thrive in the UK. By 2004, over 65% of Gleason's Gym membership was from a white-collar background, compared to 10% in the early 1990s. The increase of membership from this demographic has been credited with maintaining the profitability of boxing gyms in the US and UK with large shows like WCB &amp; Ultra White Collar. \nEvent management consultant Alan Lacey, who co-promoted the Gary Stretch vs. Chris Eubank WBO middleweight championship bout in 1991, belatedly discovered boxing training at the age of 45. Captivated and motivated by the discipline over the following years, he started training under former European champion Jimmy McDonnell and alongside two-time Olympian and world title challenger Adrian Dodson, who having spent most of his youth at Gleason’s Gym in New York suggested Lacey fulfill his ambition to box, even at the age of 48, and arranged for him to visit Gleason's and box there. On the flight back to London, Lacey decided white-collar boxing could flourish in London. \nIn July 2000, one of the first notable white-collar boxing events, \"Capital Punishment\", in collaboration with Gleason's owner Bruce Silverglade, saw a team of Wall Street bankers fly to London to compete at Broadgate Arena in London, generating interest and media coverage. Lacey boxed twice on the night and subsequently devoted his time and energy to developing the sport exclusively since. Over 100 sold-out events have followed \"Capital Punishment\", including \"Celebrity Boxing\" on the BBC in 2003 featuring, among others, Les Dennis and Ricky Gervais, and raising more than £1.5 million for various charities. Lacey worked closely with various clubs to promote WCB forming the first White Collar Boxing shows in the UK. \nIn the Asia–Pacific region.\nThe many bouts in the Asia–Pacific region are usually contested under WWCBA \"(see below)\" sanctioning.\nGoverning bodies.\nIn 2001, Lacey and Bruce Silverglade co-founded the International White Collar Boxing Association (IWCBA), the first and to this day main advisory and sanctioning governing body in the field, designed to regulate the bouts with a focus on safety. The IWCBA uses the same weight divisions of professional boxing and awards a belt to the champions of each weight category. Matchmaking of non-title bouts is based on level of experience as much as actual weight. It also rigorously requires the presence of an experienced doctor, an anesthetist, and a paramedic unit at ringside as well as thorough medical checks. Over 1,500 bouts have been sanctioned by the IWCBA over the years, with zero injuries aside from bloody noses. IWBCA-sanctioned bouts are predominant in the UK and US.\nIn 2007, the World White Collar Boxing Association (WWCBA) was founded to London, UK, to regulate and promote the sport throughout the world, but is principally active in the Asia–Pacific region. The WWCBA provides a common platform in the form of rules and guidelines allowing boxers to become ranked nationally, regionally and globally and to contest for championship titles. In 2008 the WWCBA sanctioned 9 events throughout the world. The WWCBA works with other boxing authorities such as the amateur International Boxing Association (AIBA) to ensure strong standards.\nBouts.\nBouts are usually three 2-minute rounds (\"3×2\" format), unlike the longer three 3-minute rounds (3×3) in the Amateur Code for men and 4×2 format for women. The IWCBA bouts have traditionally been \"no decision\" draws (ties) in absence of a knock-out, while WWCBA ranking system requires a win–loss decision for all bouts.\nThe first large gala events included the Boodles Boxing Ball series attended by Prince Harry as well as the \"Hedge Fund Fight Nite\" raising over $200,000 for charity both is initially organized/staged by The Real Fight Club.\nIn 2005 a purely non-profit black-tie gala at the London Hilton organized by The David Adams Leukaemia Appeal Fund &amp; Mr King with more than 950 black-tie dinner guests raised over £100,000 for The Royal Marsden Hospital Cancer Campaign on the night. It was the largest event of its kind until 2013, see below.\nIn April 2009 a gala at Suntec Singapore Exhibition and Convention Centre staged by Vanda Promotions had more than 900 black-tie guests.\nOn Saturday, 18 July 2009, the Channel Island of Jersey held its first white-collar-boxing event. Nine fights were watched by over 600 paying, black-tied guests at the Hotel de France, raising around £15,000 for local charities.\nIn 2009, Ultra White Collar Boxing (UWCB) hosted their first event in Derby and soon became the largest company organising events in the UK. They hold events in over 110 towns and cities across the UK and have raised over £21,000,000 to date through Ultra Events for Cancer Research UK since they began fundraising in 2013. UWCB organise over 450 events a year with an average of 15,000 people taking part each year. In their 10 year history more than 50,000 people have taken part in UWCB events organised across the UK.\nOne of the newest names in the industry is Premier White Collar Boxing (PWCB). Hosting sold-out shows at glamorous venues, PWCB gives the boxers the opportunity to raise money for a charity of their choice. \nOn 13 October 2012, Neilson Boxing, a Swindon-based white-collar-boxing promoter, put on the largest show of its kind to date. A venue verified attendance of 1398 watched ten contests at the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon with the main event seeing Dave 'Bam Bam' Gregory retain his NP Heavyweight title against Rich 'The Tank' Loveday over three rounds. This was surpassed in March 2014 when a crowd of nearly 2,000 fight fans saw 'Sugar' Shawn Grant defeat ex-pro Phill Day to gain the Vacant Cruiserweight Title.\nOn 20 April 2013, Vanda Promotions (part of Vanda Sports Group) held its twenty-fourth event in Singapore making the series the longest consecutive white-collar boxing in the history of the sport. A verified attendance of 1,943 attended the black-tie event at the Raffles Convention Centre which brought total attendance over the five-year history of the events to 15,491. The event also saw Vanda move past the $2 million mark for funds raised for children's charities in Asia and for the continued funding of the Vanda Wing at Children's Surgical Centre in Cambodia. Vanda was also the recipient of the \"Promoter of the year award\" for the fourth consecutive year from the World White Collar Boxing Association (WWCBA).\nOn 3 February 2018, two British YouTubers, KSI and Joe Weller, fought at Copper Box Arena in London, England, where KSI defeated Weller by technical knockout. On YouTube, the KSI vs. Weller fight drew 21million views on fight night, and over 25million over the next several days, becoming the biggest white-collar boxing fight in history.\nKSI fought American YouTube personality Logan Paul in a white-collar boxing match on 25 August 2018. One judge scored in favour of KSI and two judges scored a draw, resulting in a majority draw. The fight has been labeled \"the largest event in YouTube history\" and \"the largest ever amateur boxing fight\".\nEquipment.\nSixteen-ounce gloves are standard in the white-collar-boxing ring in order to protect competitors from heavy blows and hand injuries. Some gyms permit 14 oz gloves as well for lighter weight classes and for female competitors. Moreover, headgear, groin protectors, and mouthguards are obligatory requirements inside the ring."

A right-handed batter and thrower, Johnson stood tall and weighed .\nOn perhaps the best day in his career, on June 19, 1977, against the A's, Johnson sang the National Anthem before the game, and followed up with two homers, the only White Sox hits on the day, as the Sox won 2-1.\nCoaching career.\nLamar's coaching career began in 1988, when he was hired by the Milwaukee Brewers as a minor league hitting instructor. He coached in Milwaukee's minor league system through 1994, serving as the hitting coach for their AAA affiliate, the Denver Zephyrs, in 1991 and 1992, and as manager of their highest A ball affiliate, the Stockton Ports, in 1993 and 1994.\nIn December 1994, Lamar Johnson was named by manager Phil Garner as the hitting coach for the Brewers big league club. After having scored only 547 runs in 1994, the club scored 740 runs in 1995, and then 894 runs in 1996, a franchise record. After the offense stagnated over the next two seasons, Johnson was fired by the Brewers in August 1998. But just three months later, the Kansas City Royals hired him to serve in the same capacity.\nWith the Royals, Johnson again had a remarkable amount of initial success. After having scored 714 runs in 1998, the team scored a club record 856 runs in 1999, and then broke that record again in 2000 by scoring 879 runs, which remains the franchise record today. Of Jermaine Dye, who emerged in those years as a star player, beat writer Joe Posnanski wrote \"Dye used to have a loopy swing. Now, thanks in part to hitting coach Lamar Johnson, the swing is as compact as a Honda.\" But Johnson was fired again nonetheless after the 2002 season, in which the Royals finished 11th in the American League in runs scored.\nIn 2003, Johnson served as hitting coach for the Seattle Mariners who, despite playing in a pitchers park, had one of the better offenses in the American League that season, winning 93 games. But Johnson was not retained in 2004 despite this, as the offense slumped over the last month of the season.\nSince 2005, he has worked in the Mets organization, first as a roving hitting instructor, then as minor league hitting coordinator. With Johnson overseeing the development of young hitters, the Mets farm system has produced enough talent that on April 26, 2011, the team fielded a starting lineup of all homegrown players for the first time since 1971. On May 26, 2014, Johnson was made the new hitting coach for the Mets, replacing Dave Hudgens. He served through the end of the season, then was reassigned as a minor league hitting instructor in the Mets' organization. He was replaced by former Yankees' coach Kevin Long for the 2015 season."

The rules specify the equipment used and its care and preparation, the layout of the playing field, the details of game play, and the expected behavior of the players.\nThe rules are also used by many amateur leagues, although in these cases, the monetary fines and other such stipulation are usually considered impractical and disregarded. \nHistory.\nStarting with the Knickerbocker Rules in 1845, and the National League Rules in 1877, the rules of baseball have evolved over time. The 2014 edition of the rulebook fills about 250 pages. After the 2014 season, the Playing Rules Committee reorganized and recodified the rules. However, through the 2017 edition, the rulebook also contains a listing in the 2014 format. The 2017 edition occupies 163 and 99 pages in the current and 2014 formats, respectively.\nChanges to the rules are decided by a committee. Although new rules are added, some rules which are obsolete have not been deleted.\nIn recent years the rules have also been posted online."

        "text": "The 2009 ICC Champions Trophy was a One Day International cricket tournament held in South Africa between 22 September and 5 October, at Wanderers Stadium and Centurion Park, both in the Gauteng province. Originally, the tournament was scheduled to be hosted by Pakistan in 2008, but due to security concerns it shifted to South Africa. It was the sixth ICC Champions Trophy, and was previously known as the ICC Knock-out. Two teams from two groups of four qualified for the semi-finals, and the final was staged in Centurion on 5 October. Australia successfully defended the title by beating New Zealand by six wickets in the final.\nHistory.\nThe Champions Trophy was the brainchild of Jagmohan Dalmiya, who was ICC president in the late 1990s. It had a dual aim of spreading the game to emerging nations and raising money for the ICC between World Cups, thus enabling it to pump more cash into those fledgling cricket countries. The first tournament, labelled as a mini World Cup, was staged in Dhaka in October 1998 and raised more than £10 million. The second, in Nairobi, was a commercial success, although the crowds stayed away. By the time the 2002 event was held – and there was disquiet as it was so close to the World Cup five months later – the idea of playing in developing nations had been ditched. As revenue generation was the main raison d'etre, it needed to be in one of the main countries, which allowed the format to be expanded. In 2004 the jamboree moved to England, and it became clear the format of group games led to too many meaningless games. By the time the 2006 tournament in India came into view, the event was under fire from some quarters, and at one time, there were hints that India might decline to take part in 2008.\nSchedule and location.\nThe tournament was originally scheduled to be held in Pakistan between 11 and 28 September 2008 in Lahore and Karachi. The ICC postponed the tournament due to security fears expressed by several participating countries; On 24 July 2008, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that the tournament would take place in Pakistan after all despite players from Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand raising concerns over touring the country. On 22 August 2008, South Africa announced that it would not take part in the Champions Trophy due to security concerns. Two days later, on 24 August 2008, after speculation that the tournament would be held elsewhere (England, Sri Lanka, or South Africa), the ICC announced that the tournament would be postponed until October 2009.\nAt its meeting in February 2009, the ICC board decided to move the tournament out of Pakistan on security concerns. At the time, Sri Lanka was the favoured alternate host. In March 2009, the ICC Chief Executives' Committee recommended to the ICC board that the tournament be held in South Africa as there were concerns that the weather in Sri Lanka during September and October could result in too many games being washed out. The ICC board ratified the recommendation, and the event took place in South Africa between 22 September and 5 October 2009.\nQualification.\nAs hosts, Pakistan was replaced by South Africa and qualified for the competition automatically; they were joined by the seven other highest-ranked teams in the ICC ODI Championship as of 1 August 2009.\nVenues.\nWanderers Stadium and Centurion Park, both in the Johannesburg area, were announced as venues for the tournament.\nRules and regulations.\nThe 2009 ICC Champions Trophy was contested by the top eight teams (previously 10) that had been seeded and divided into two groups. No associates nations participated in this tournament. Each team played every other team in its group once. Points were allocated for each match in accordance with the system described below which applied throughout the competition. Following the group stage, the top two teams from each group progressed to the semi-finals, where the winner of Group A played the runner up of Group B (in the 1st semi-final) and the winner of Group B played the runner up of Group A (in the 2nd semi-final). The winners of the semi-finals contested the final.\nGroup stage.\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

It was devised by British amateur golfer Peter McEvoy, a former victorious captain of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, and David Piggins, a sports venue owner and operator, assisted shortly afterwards by golf agency owner Andy Hiseman. McEvoy and Hiseman wrote the rules together in February 2007.\nIn PowerPlay Golf, players can choose to play to the 'easy' white flag or the more difficult black flag. If they score a birdie or better to the black flag, they earn double Stableford Points. Each golfer is compelled to take exactly three 'PowerPlays' in the first eight holes. They then have the option of a fourth 'PowerPlay' on the final hole. But if they get a net bogey or worse, they lose points from their total score.\nThe game was first played by 16 UK golf journalists at Playgolf Northwick Park Golf Course, London, on 6 February 2007. The format expanded its reach rapidly with a pilot scheme taking in 30 countries and over 400 golf courses by the end of 2010.\nPlayed by the English Golf Union Elite Squad in training sessions, first occasion in April 2007.\nDavid Kemp, a 3-handicap golfer from Guildford, Surrey, won the first ever National PowerPlay Golf Championships at Hampton Court Palace Golf Club, London, on 6 September 2007 — featured by \"Today's Golfer\" magazine.\nOn Thursday, 24 March 2011, PowerPlay Golf announced that Ken Schofield CBE, former European Tour Executive Director, had joined as Chairman. On the same day it also announced that Convers Sports Initiatives had acquired a controlling interest in PowerPlay Golf, and announced a press conference to be held at The Celtic Manor Resort, Newport, South Wales, on Wednesday, 13 April 2011 at 14:00 UK time.

The course and clubhouse are located on the original site of Roxboro Castle and grounds and boasts an 18-hole, mature, parkland layout. The design of the course evolved over a number of years with a major contribution in 1927 from Dr. Alister MacKenzie - who was the architect of Lahinch and Augusta National. The current layout measures 6500 yards in length and has a par of 72. \nLimerick has one of the largest memberships in the country with over 1300 members, and a long tradition in competitive golf in Ireland - having won 20 national titles. The club's most recent such win was the Irish Junior Cup in 2023. It was the first Irish club to win a European title at senior level when capturing the European Club Championship in 1980. It has played host to many championships over the years - including an exhibition match in the 1930s which included eleven-time major winner Walter Hagen and John Burke. It is now home to the Munster Mid-Amateur Championship.\nThe J. P. McManus Pro-Am, the biggest pro-am event of its kind in Europe, had its home at Limerick Golf Club from 1990, with the last staging in July 2000. The field included some of the biggest players in the game, such as Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara, and raised over €19,000,000 for local charities. Both of these players returned to Limerick Golf Club in 2001 and were conferred with Honorary Life Membership. Tiger Woods presented the flag from the 18th green of The 2000 Open Championship, held at St. Andrews, to the Club. This event grew too large for the Ballyclough course and moved to Adare Manor Hotel &amp; Golf Resort in 2005.\nA new clubhouse was constructed in 2007 and was officially opened by The Open Champion, Pádraig Harrington, in September of that year.\nThe club shares its name with a Limerick Golf Club located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, USA, which is a public facility."

By the early 1920s, he had become a referee for pro games played in the Ohio Valley, and in 1921 was banned from officiating games for the Ironton Tanks after admitting that he had watched them \"more closely\" than their opponents.\nBy the mid-1930s, Hamilton had become a college football referee for the Big Ten Conference."

        "title": "Glenn Roberts (basketball)",
        "text": "Glenn Roberts (October 25, 1912 – May 21, 1980) was an American National Basketball League player. In college basketball, Roberts was one of the first players to put the \"jump shot\" to practical use.\nOverview.\nGlenn Roberts' Pound, Virginia high school did not field a basketball team his first two high school years. Roberts’ team won the state championship his junior and senior years (1930 &amp; 31). The team record for 1930 was 28 wins and 2 losses with 1931 being 35 wins and 0 losses. Roberts was designated captain of the All-State team both years. Roberts played varsity ball 4 years (1931–35) at Emory &amp; Henry College scoring 2,013 points in 104 games for a per game average of 19.4 points in an era when team scores were seldom over 30 or 35 points per game. His scoring was a new record for that time and still stands for play prior to the 1937 revision of the center-jump rule which called for walking the ball back to the center-line after every basket made and with the clock still running. (It's been estimated that this used up 8 to 10 minutes per game.) Roberts scored 1,531 points against college opposition in 80 games and 482 points against pro and semi-pro teams in 24 games. Emory and Henry's overall team record was 90 wins and 14 losses. His scoring total and per-game average was featured in Ripleys’ \"Believe it or Not\" in 1936.\nOne significant reason for Glenn Roberts’ prolific scoring was his use of a jump-shot. Historian and writer Stephen Fox, in his book “Big Leagues,” contends, after exhaustive research, that Glenn Roberts was the very first college player to utilize a jump-shot to such a scoring advantage. It was an offensive weapon the opposition had never seen before.\nIn the 1930s there did not exist the well defined college conferences as today. Consequently, smaller schools like Emory &amp; Henry were as likely to play the largest of schools as well as the smaller ones. Emory &amp; Henry regularly played the University of Richmond, Virginia Tech, University of Tennessee, William &amp; Mary, East Tennessee State, George Washington, University of Virginia etc.\nA game against the much larger University of Richmond Spiders is significant. The only team to have an undefeated season, in the history of Virginia college basketball, was the 1934-35 Richmond team. Richmond's late coach, Malcolm (Mac) Pitt, in a letter to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, describes how Richmond, in its final game of the season, narrowly edged Emory and Henry with their defensive efforts being focused primarily on Roberts. Richmond defeated Emory and Henry, IN OVERTIME, on Richmond's home court in an era when officiating was far less than the high caliber profession it is today. The \"home court\" was generally considered a 4 or 5 point advantage for the home team.\nUpon graduating, Glenn Roberts received many professional offers from National Basketball League (NBL) and other professional teams, but opted for coaching basketball at Norton High in Norton, Virginia. He turned the program around and won the district championship in the two years he coached – 1936 and 1937 seasons. He was induced by the Firestone Non-Skids of the NBL to play for the 1938–39 season. The Firestone team had four All-Americans including Glenn Roberts – Art Bonniwell of Dartmouth and John Moir and Paul Nowak, both from Notre Dame. Firestone won the NBL Eastern Division championship with a 24 and 3 season record. They then won the NBL Championship by beating the Western Division champions (Oshkosh All-Stars) in a best of 5 series. Their .875 winning percentage for the regular season is the highest winning percentage in the history of the NBL and the NBA (National Basketball Association). Ironically, the standout player on the team was a non-collegian, \"Soup\" Cable, a local Akronite, who averaged 10 points with the other scoring being fairly evenly distributed in the 3 to 6 point range. Glen Roberts played little basketball in the two years after college, yet was able to make a significant contribution to the Firestone teams’ outstanding season. Roberts, knowing that basketball wasn't going to be his life's career, took advantage of a job opportunity with Firestone after the one spectacular season.\nGlenn Roberts and his six brothers (five of whom were Virginia high school all-state) fielded a team and dominated the Northeast Ohio industrial leagues during the early 1940s. Roberts and his brothers took a leave of absence from Firestone in January 1945 to sell war-bonds by barnstorming Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina and West Virginia where Glenn Roberts' name was still legend. Their opposition was colleges, pro and semi-pro teams. (On March 10, 1945, $50,000.00 was raised in a victory over Milligan College.) \nFive of the seven brothers were exempted from military service during the World War II years because their Firestone jobs were critical to the war effort. The other two did a tour of duty in the navy and army respectively.\nPlay with his brothers in the mid-1940s was the end of Glenn Roberts’ involvement with basketball with the exception of two years in the 1960s. He coached Clinch Valley College of the University of Virginia for two seasons – 1964 through 1966. The team record for the season prior to his arrival was 2 wins and 19 losses. Roberts’ record was 14 wins and 6 losses each of the two years he coached. Until Roberts’ college coaching debut the school had never known a winning season.\nJump shot.\n Basketball writers and historians have debated where, when and from whom the jump shot came. The consensus conclusion is that no one knows for sure. The first basketball \"jump\" shot could have been executed in 1918, or any year, by any John Doe in Any Town, U.S.A. The more important consideration is, who was the first in organized basketball to put to use a \"jump\" style shot with the result being “increased scoring” for that individual, assuming it was an asset to the team?\nIn college basketball, the undisputed first player(s) to put a jump shot to practical use, were Glenn Roberts of Emory and Henry College and John M Cooper of the University of Missouri. Again, noted historian and writer, Stephen Fox, in his 1994 book, “Big Leagues,” shows that Roberts and Cooper both used a jumper simultaneously in time (early 1930s) and yet totally independent of each other. Both shot a two handed jumper. The greatest difference between the two was their scoring averages. While Cooper's 11 plus point average was considered great in that era of low scoring games, it paled in comparison to Roberts’ 19 plus average.\nRoberts’ high school did not have an indoor gym and therefore had to practice on an outdoor dirt court. Often when the ground was too muddy for dribbling, the players would just pass to each other and shoot when someone was open. Roberts, even when guarded closely, started jumping in the air, with ball in hand, and released the ball at the apex of his jump.\nIt wasn't until a decade or so later that the \"jump shot\" started to become more widely used. Four players to be credited with popularizing the jumper in the mid-to-late 1940s were Bud Palmer, Belus Smawley, Kenny Sailors and Joe Fulks.\nBasketball observations.\n Glenn Roberts' high school and college scoring was considered by many nothing short of spectacular. Compared to today, record keeping in the 1930s was very lacking and it is therefore impossible to give an accurate accounting of his high school scoring totals. Testimony from former high school teammates, via letters submitted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, indicate that Roberts’ high school scoring was well in excess of a 20-point average. Many considered his college scoring as truly “unbelievable” as Ripleys’ \"Believe it or Not\" feature indicated. His 2,013 point total stood unmatched until 1949 when Loyola's Steve Lacey exceeded 2,000 points.\nThe closest that any college player, prior to 1935, had come to Glenn Roberts’ 19 plus per game average was “Hall of Fame” great and 1930 Montana State graduate, John \"Cat\" Thompson, with a 15 plus per game average. Nineteen of the 100 games Thompson's team played during his four years was against non-college opponents, with Montana State averaging 77 points per game and winning each game. (Example: Montana State beat Havre All-Stars 110 to 10). It is therefore obvious that Thompson averaged significantly less than 15 points against bona-fide college teams.\nGlenn Roberts' and Hank Luisetti's records.\nIn 1938, newspapers throughout the South announced that Stanford's great “Hall of Famer,\" Hank Luisetti, voted 2nd greatest player of the first half century, had broken Glenn Roberts’ scoring record. They stated that Luisetti had scored 1,596 points in four years as opposed to Roberts’ 1,531 points. What was overlooked by the press was the fact that 305 of Luisetti's points were scored in 15 games as a freshman against college freshmen and high school teams. It was also in his freshman year that Luisetti attained his highest average (20.3) of any of his four years at Stanford. Also, Hank Luisetti played in 95 games (compared to Roberts' 80 games) in accumulating his 1,596 points for an overall per game average of 16.8 points.\nIn a letter dated April 27, 1979 and addressed to Carroll Tate of the \"Coalfied Progress,\" Stanford University's “Sports Information Director,” Bob Rose, confirms that Luisetti's scoring total was 1,291 points in 80 games for a 16.1 per game average (sophomore, junior and senior years).\nGlenn Roberts played all 80 games against varsity college competition, including 18 games as a freshman. During his freshman year, Roberts scored 292 points for an average of 16.2 points per game.\nNote the following comparison chart summarizing Roberts’ and Luisetti's college statistics for games played against college teams.\n \nThere are several glaring similarities between Roberts’ and Luisetti's basketball careers. First, both used a revolutionary new shot that accounted for each players’ accelerated scoring – Roberts with a two-handed jump shot and Luisetti with a one-handed running shot. Secondly, the team records for Emory and Henry and Stanford were 68-12 during Roberts’ and Luisetti's 80 varsity games played against other colleges and universities. Thirdly, Roberts and Luisetti each scored fifty points in a game – Roberts against the \"House of David,\" a non-college team. (Roberts scored 38 points in a college game against Union College of Kentucky Luisetti's 50 point performance was against Duquesne University of Pennsylvania. Lastly, both Roberts and Luisetti enjoyed a limited post-college professional basketball career.\nLuisetti's rise to national prominence was generated by Stanford's good fortune in being invited by Ned Irish to play in Madison Square Garden. After barnstorming across the country playing to capacity crowds in big cities like Cleveland and Philadelphia, Stanford concluded their tour by playing Long Island University (LIU) on December 30, 1936. LIU had won 43 straight games, but was whipped by Stanford as Luisetti had a great night scoring 15 points.\nOne can only conjecture the result had Emory and Henry and Glenn Roberts been invited by Ned Irish to play in Madison Square Garden. Would the opposing teams have been able to adjust to and defend the unorthodox and likely never-before-seen two handed jump shot of Glenn Roberts? On the other hand, how well would Luisetti's exploits have been remembered had Stanford not made their cross-country trip culminating in the LIU game where he was in the cross-hairs of the powerful Northeast press. \nA comparison of Roberts’ and Luisetti's playing abilities is not the intent here, nor is it an attempt to detract from Luisetti's greatness. It is intended, rather, to use Luisetti's great accomplishments as a mirror for Glen Roberts’ individual basketball accomplishments.\nRecord keeping was also limited in college games of the 1930s and therefore records for field goal percentages, foul shooting percentages, assists etc. were non-existent.\nLetters from Emory and Henry teammates Sam Neal, Walter Fielder and Paul Mackey, on file at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, indicate that Roberts field goal percentage was well in excess of 50 per cent. They further state that he rarely missed a foul shot. They also attested to his strong defensive play.\nRoberts, in a 1975 interview with Abe Goldblatt for his book, \"The Great and the Near Great: A Century of Sports in Virginia,\" stated that he \"took every defensive assignment as a personal challenge to hold my opponent to as few points as possible.\"\nAlso, in a letter on file at the Basketball Hall of Fame, Firestone teammate Irv Terjesen testifies to Roberts' all around play.\nIf one is to believe the testimony of his college and professional teammates, Roberts was more than a prolific scorer, but an all around great player.\nBasketball Hall of Fame.\nThere are many people, especially Southerners, who think Glenn Roberts should be in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The game of basketball in the 1920s and 1930s did not enjoy the national focus of today. It was more provincial in focus and coverage. The only possible national focus was on what would be considered the basketball power structure of the day, the New England and New York City/New Jersey area.\nSupporting this is the fact that all players, from Glenn Roberts' era, inducted into the Hall of Fame are from the Northeast with a few from the Mid-West and, of course, Luisetti from California. As already pointed out, Luisetti had a chance to show his stuff in New York City.\nThe geography that Glenn Roberts covered during his college days was definitely void of national focus and attention. This fact does not, however, make Glenn Roberts exploits and contributions to the game any less real or significant. It would be presumptuous and erroneous to conclude that Glenn Roberts' caliber of play was inferior because he was never in the crosshairs of the powerful Northeast press. There is no player in the Hall of Fame from Roberts' era whose accomplishments come remotely close to Roberts' scoring achievements and all-around play.\nPersonal life.\nNo one knows for sure whether Glenn should be spelled with one or two n's; it's been done equally both ways throughout his life.\nTo say that Glenn Roberts and his six brothers were born to humble beginnings, would be an understatement. Few today could visualize sweeping snow out of every room the next morning after a snowfall. Probably no one can remember newspaper as their standard wall paper. It was not an easy life for Charlie and Orlena Roberts and their brood of seven boys.\nChildren in those agrarian days were viewed as workhands as soon as they were old enough for a hoe to fit their hands. The average summer day on South Fork, located five miles (8 km) from Pound, Virginia, began before dawn with breakfast followed by hoeing, mowing and whatever else was needed on their farm that produced corn, potatoes and the ancillary crops needed for food. A few cows, hogs and many chickens rounded out their food sources.\nEven though they could have been used full-time on the farm, Mommy Roberts vowed her boys were going to get an education even if they had to walk to school; and walk they did. Glenn Roberts started his five-mile (8 km) trek before daylight with lantern in hand, leaving the lantern on the same barn each morning. There was always time for basketball each day before and after school.\nGlenn graduated from Emory and Henry College in 1935, where he was in the social fraternity Beta Lambda Zeta. Rather than take one of the many offers to play professional basketball, Glenn opted to coach and teach at Norton High School for two years. Immediately after college he married Helen Joyce Keys and had three children, Glenn Jr., Mary Virginia and Larry Van.\nAfter playing one year of professional basketball with Firestone (1938–39), he went to work full-time for Firestone where he enjoyed a successful career, working his way up to being head of Firestone's \"Time Study\" Department. In 1963 he resigned from Firestone to join his son, Glenn Jr. in their new tire business in Norton, Virginia.\nAt the time of his death, this business and the eleven others in Southwest Virginia, Eastern Kentucky and East Tennessee had become the third largest Firestone dealer in the country and the largest consumer of Firestone retread rubber in the country.\nRoberts developed colon cancer in 1978 and succumbed to it in 1980."

The Cardinals offense started off their ensuing drive with three runs for 21 yards by Edgerrin James, and then took the lead over the Falcons with a 42-yard touchdown pass from Kurt Warner to Larry Fitzgerald on a flea flicker play.\nIn the second quarter, Ryan led Atlanta 80 yards to the Cardinals 12-yard line where Jason Elam finished the drive with a 30-yard field goal to cut the score to 7–3. But three plays after the kickoff, Warner threw a short pass to receiver Anquan Boldin, who caught the ball and cut away from Lawyer Milloy, taking off down the left sideline for a 71-yard touchdown reception to give his team a 14–3 lead.\nAtlanta responded with touchdowns on their next two drives to take the lead before halftime. First, Ryan threw for 67 yards on a 77-yard drive that ended with Turner's 7-yard touchdown run. Then, Chevis Jackson intercepted a pass from Warner on the Cardinals 23-yard line. Five plays later, Ryan threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Justin Peelle, giving Atlanta a 17–14 lead with 23 seconds left in the second quarter.\nHowever, Arizona would score 16 unanswered points in the second half. Three plays after the second half kickoff, Darnell Dockett burst up the middle on a running play, knocking the ball out of Ryan's hands before he could hand it off. Antrel Rolle (who was blitzing on the play) snagged the ball out of midair and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown. Then following two Atlanta punts and a missed 51-yard field goal by Neil Rackers, Arizona running back Tim Hightower finished a 76-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run, making the score 28–17. Early in the fourth quarter, the Cardinals increased their lead to 30–17 when defensive end Antonio Smith sacked Ryan in the end zone for a safety.\nWith 4:14 left in the game, Atlanta managed to get back within one touchdown with a 5-yard touchdown pass from Ryan to Roddy White. But with the aid of a key 24-yard reception by reserve tight end Stephen Spach (who caught only two passes for 15 yards during the season) on third down and 16, the Cardinals managed to run out the rest of the clock.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Falcons and Cardinals.\nAFC: San Diego Chargers 23, Indianapolis Colts 17 (OT).\nChargers running back Darren Sproles had 328 all-purpose yards (105 rushing, 45 receiving, 106 kickoff return yards, 72 yards on three punt returns), the third highest total in playoff history, and two touchdowns, including the game winning score in overtime.\nLate in the first quarter, three receptions by Colts receiver Anthony Gonzalez for 59 yards set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Joseph Addai, putting Indianapolis on the board. In the second quarter, an 18-yard punt return by Sproles gave the Chargers good field position on the Colts 44-yard line. A few plays later, Philip Rivers' 30-yard completion to tight end Antonio Gates set up a 1-yard touchdown run by LaDainian Tomlinson to tie the game. But two more receptions by Gonzalez, for gains of 20 and 11 yards, led to an Adam Vinatieri field goal.\nAfter an exchange of punts, Hunter Smith's 34-yard punt from his own 11-yard line gave San Diego the ball on the Colts 45. Five plays later, Sproles scored on a 9-yard touchdown run, giving his team a 14–10 halftime lead.\nMidway into the third quarter, Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning managed to hurry his offense onto the line of scrimmage for a play while San Diego's defense was making substitutions. As a result, receiver Reggie Wayne ran past cornerback Antonio Cromartie (who didn't even realize the play had started), caught a pass from Manning, and took off for a 72-yard touchdown catch, retaking the lead for the Colts at 17–14. This would be the last score from both teams until late in the fourth quarter. San Diego responded on their ensuing drive by moving the ball to the Colts 9-yard line. But Sproles fumbled the ball into the end zone while being tackled by Tim Jennings and defensive tackle Raheem Brock recovered it for a touchback.\nWith under three minutes left in the game, Mike Scifres's 52-yard punt pinned the Colts back at their own 1-yard line. The Colts managed to get away from their own end zone with their first two plays, but on third down and two, linebacker Tim Dobbins drove them back to the 1 by sacking Manning for an 8-yard loss. Sproles then returned the ensuing punt 26 yards to the Colts 38-yard line. Following two receptions by Gates for 22 yards and an 8-yard run by Sproles, Nate Kaeding's field goal tied the game with 31 seconds left, sending it into sudden death.\nIn overtime, the Chargers won the coin toss and drove for the winning score, aided by two key penalties against the Colts defense. First Sproles returned the kickoff 31 yards to his own 25-yard line, and two plays later he caught a 13-yard pass on third down and 11. Six plays later from the Indianapolis 40-yard line, Jennings was called for defensive holding while trying to cover Chris Chambers on a third down play, giving the Chargers a first down. On the next play, a 15-yard facemask penalty on Clint Session moved the ball to the 20. Sproles was tackled for a 2-yard loss on the next play, but after that he ran 22 yards for a game-winning touchdown to win the game for San Diego.\nThis would be the Chargers' last playoff win until the 2013 NFL playoffs &amp; last home playoff win for the Chargers in San Diego.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Colts and Chargers, and the second consecutive postseason meeting. Both teams have split the previous two meetings. San Diego won the previous meeting 28–24 in the 2007 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nSunday, January 4, 2009.\nAFC: Baltimore Ravens 27, Miami Dolphins 9.\nThe game featured a Dolphins offense which had an NFL-low 13 giveaways against a Ravens defense that led the league in takeaways with 34. The Ravens defense ended up triumphant, forcing five turnovers en route to victory.\nOn the game's opening drive, Baltimore fullback Le'Ron McClain fumbled which linebacker Joey Porter recovered and returned to midfield. Several plays later, Miami advanced to the Ravens 1-yard line, but was unable to get into the end zone with two consecutive plays and ended up settling for a Dan Carpenter field goal to take a 3–0 lead. Baltimore responded with a drive to the Dolphins 5-yard line, featuring a 31-yard reception by tight end Todd Heap and scored with Matt Stover's 23-yard field goal to tie the game.\nMidway through the second quarter, Ravens safety Ed Reed intercepted a pass from Chad Pennington and returned it 64 yards for a touchdown. Then after forcing a punt, Joe Flacco's 31-yard completion to Derrick Mason set up Stover's second field goal to give the Ravens a 13–3 halftime lead.\nMiami's misfortunes continued in the second half. On their first drive of the second half, Pennington threw his third interception of the game. Then after a punt, Dolphins running back Patrick Cobbs fumbled while being tackled by Marques Douglas and linebacker Terrell Suggs recovered it on Miami's 19-yard line. Three plays later, McClain scored on an 8-yard touchdown run to make it 20–3. The Dolphins responded with a drive to the Ravens 13-yard line, only to lose the ball on Pennington's fourth interception of the game, and his second to Reed.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Pennington's 45-yard completion to Davone Bess set up his 2-yard touchdown pass to Ronnie Brown, cutting the score to 20–9 after Frank Walker blocked the extra point attempt. But the Ravens defense shut out Miami for the rest of the game. Meanwhile, a 48-yard run by Willis McGahee set up a 5-yard touchdown by Flacco, making the final score 27–9.\nThis would be the Dolphins last playoff appearance until the 2016 NFL playoffs.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Ravens and Dolphins, with Baltimore winning the only prior meeting 20–3 in the 2001 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nNFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14.\nBrian Westbrook's 71-yard touchdown reception in the second half gave the Eagles a two-score lead they never relinquished. Philadelphia's special teams unit also played a key role in their victory, as David Akers kicked four field goals, while DeSean Jackson returned five punts for a franchise playoff record 106 yards.\nEarly in the first quarter, Jackson's 62-yard punt return set up a field goal from Akers. Then after a punt, Donovan McNabb's 27-yard completion to Correll Buckhalter set up a 51-yard field goal by Akers on the last play of the quarter, making it 6–0. But Minnesota took the lead on their next drive with a 40-yard touchdown run from Adrian Peterson.\nHowever, this turned out to be the only lead the Vikings would have for the entire game, and it would be short-lived. First, a 34-yard reception by Jackson set up Akers' third field goal. Then on Minnesota's next drive, cornerback Asante Samuel intercepted a pass from Tarvaris Jackson and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown, giving the Eagles a 16–7 lead.\nWith less than two minutes left in the first half, Peterson scored his second touchdown on a 3-yard run to cut the deficit to 16–14. But after a scoreless third quarter, Westbrook's 71-yard touchdown reception put the Eagles back up by nine points. Then with less than three minutes left in the game, a low snap by center Matt Birk in shotgun formation bounced off Tarvaris Jackson's foot and was recovered by Eagles defensive end Juqua Parker. Five plays later, Akers kicked his fourth field goal, this one from 45 yards, to put the game away.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Eagles and Vikings, with Philadelphia winning both prior meetings, including 27–14 in the 2004 NFC Divisional playoffs.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 10, 2009.\nAFC: Baltimore Ravens 13, Tennessee Titans 10.\nMatt Stover kicked a 43-yard field goal with 57 seconds remaining to send the Ravens into the AFC Championship Game at the expense of the Titans, as quarterback Joe Flacco became the first rookie quarterback to win two playoff games in a single postseason. Tennessee turned the ball over three times, which proved to be the difference between the two teams, as Baltimore never gave the ball away.\nThe Titans took the lead on their second drive of the game with Kerry Collins completing a 28-yard pass to rookie running back Chris Johnson and a 20-yarder to Justin Gage before Johnson finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run. But the Ravens answered back with Flacco's 48-yard touchdown pass to former Titan Derrick Mason.\nEarly in the second quarter, Tennessee drove to the Ravens 25-yard line, only to turn the ball over on downs due to a fumbled snap on a fourth down conversion attempt. Then after forcing a punt, their drive to the Ravens 32-yard line also ended with no points when a pass from Collins was picked off by former Titan Samari Rolle. Following another punt, the Titans moved the ball into scoring range for the third time in a row, this time driving to the Baltimore 22. But once again they came up empty after LenDale White's fumble was recovered by Ravens safety Jim Leonhard with 25 seconds left in the half.\nIn the second half, a 29-yard punt return by Leonhard and a 37-yard reception by Mark Clayton set up a Stover field goal to take a 10–7 lead. Meanwhile, the Titans failed to score again, as Rob Bironas missed a 51-yard field goal after Stover's field goal, and Ravens cornerback Fabian Washington forced and recovered a fumble from tight end Alge Crumpler on Baltimore's 1-yard line.\nHowever, the Ravens were unable to gain any yards with their ensuing drive and Tennessee got the ball back with great field position at the Ravens 42-yard line. This time, they managed to drive to the 10-yard line and score with a Bironas field goal to tie the game at 10.\nTwo plays after the ensuing kickoff, Baltimore faced third down and 2. On the next play, the play clock appeared to expire before the snap, but no penalty flag was thrown and Flacco ended up completing a 23-yard pass to Todd Heap. Five plays later, Stover's 43-yard field goal gave the Ravens a 13–10 lead with 53 seconds left. Baltimore's defense then sealed the victory by forcing Tennessee to turn the ball over on downs on their own 40-yard line. This would be the last playoff appearance for the Titans until the 2017 Season.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Ravens and Titans. Both teams split the prior two meetings with the victor winning on the road. Tennessee won the most recent meeting 20–17 in the 2003 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nNFC: Arizona Cardinals 33, Carolina Panthers 13.\nJake Delhomme was intercepted five times and lost a fumble as the Cardinals reached the NFC Championship Game for the first time in their history, winning for the first time in the Eastern Time Zone all season, and not only handing the Panthers their first home defeat of the season, but also handing them their first playoff home defeat. Delhomme, playing on his 34th birthday, became the first player to have five picks in the playoffs since Rich Gannon in Super Bowl XXXVII, with Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Gerald Hayes, Antrel Rolle, Ralph Brown, and Roderick Hood all hauling the ball in. Meanwhile, Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald set a franchise postseason record with 166 yards on eight receptions including a touchdown.\nPanthers receiver Mark Jones gave his team good field position on their first drive, returning the opening kickoff 39 yards to the Arizona 48-yard line. A few plays later a 31-yard burst from DeAngelo Williams set up a 9-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Stewart giving Carolina a 7–0 lead. But this would be short lived as the Cardinals would respond with 33 unanswered points.\nAfter an exchange of punts, Kurt Warner's 48-yard completion to Fitzgerald set up a 3-yard touchdown run by Tim Hightower. Then on the first play of the Panthers next drive, Cardinals defensive end Antonio Smith knocked the ball out of Delhomme's hand as he was about to throw and recovered it on the Carolina 13-yard line. One play later, Edgerrin James' 4-yard touchdown run gave Arizona a 14–7 lead.\nLater on, a 45-yard pass interference penalty on Rolle gave the Panthers the ball on the Arizona 13-yard line. But on the first play of the second quarter, Delhomme's pass was intercepted by Rodgers-Cromartie, who returned the ball 20 yards to the 20-yard line. Arizona then drove to the Panthers 31-yard line where Neil Rackers made a 49-yard field goal. Following a Carolina punt, two receptions by Fitzgerald for 42 yards set up another Rackers field goal. Then Hayes intercepted a pass from Delhomme, which led to another Arizona score, this one a 29-yard touchdown pass from Warner to Fitzgerald, making the score 27–7 by halftime.\nThe situation didn't get any better for the Panthers in the second half. Six minutes into the third quarter, Rolle's 46-yard interception return led to Rackers' third field goal. Then in the fourth quarter, Delhomme was intercepted on two consecutive drives. After the second one, the Cardinals executed 12 consecutive running plays with Hightower, gaining 48 yards and setting up Rackers' fourth field goal.\nCarolina managed to respond with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Delhomme to Steve Smith, but by then there were only 53 seconds left in the game.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Cardinals and Panthers.\nSunday, January 11, 2009.\nNFC: Philadelphia Eagles 23, New York Giants 11.\nIn what would turn out to be the final playoff game played at Giants Stadium, the Eagles defense forced three turnovers and only allowed the Giants to score three field goals despite five drives inside the Philadelphia 20-yard line. Meanwhile, Eagles kicker David Akers' three field goals gave him an NFL record 18 consecutive field goals in the postseason without a miss.\nNew York running back Ahmad Bradshaw returned the opening kickoff 65 yards, giving his team the ball on the Eagles 35-yard line. The Giants eventually drove to the 4-yard line, but ended up settling for a John Carney field goal to take a 3–0 lead. The Giants subsequently forced a punt, but on the first play of their next drive, Eli Manning's pass was intercepted by cornerback Asante Samuel and returned 25 yards to the Giants 2-yard line. A few plays later, quarterback Donovan McNabb gave his team a 7–3 lead with a 1-yard touchdown run.\nEarly in the second quarter, Jeff Feagles' 45-yard punt pinned the Eagles back at their own 5-yard line. One play later, McNabb committed an intentional grounding penalty in the end zone, giving New York a safety. Following the free kick, the Giants drove to the Philadelphia 28-yard line, but came up empty when Carney's 46-yard field goal attempt sailed wide right.\nWith just under four minutes left in the second quarter, Kevin Dockery intercepted a pass from McNabb on his own 20-yard line. Following a 25-yard run by Brandon Jacobs and Manning's 25-yard completion to tight end Kevin Boss, Carney kicked a 34-yard field goal to give New York a 1-point lead. But the Eagles responded with a 25-yard field goal from Akers as time expired in the half, making the score 10–8.\nEarly in the second half, New York defensive tackle Fred Robbins intercepted a pass from McNabb and returned it 17 yards to the Eagles 33-yard line, setting up Carney's third field goal to take an 11–10 lead. But McNabb led the Eagles back with four completions for 57 yards on their ensuing drive en route to a 35-yard field goal from Akers. After receiving the ensuing kickoff the Giants got a first down at the Philadelphia 30 thanks to a 34-yard over-the-shoulder catch by Domenik Hixon on third and 5. But the drive stalled and the Giants came up empty as Carney missed a second field goal try, this one from 47 yards. After the missed field goal, McNabb led the Eagles 63 yards in 10 plays and finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown pass to reserve tight end Brent Celek on the first play of the fourth quarter, giving the Eagles a 20–11 lead.\nThe Eagles defense then went on to dominate the fourth quarter, forcing two turnovers on downs, an interception and a fumble. Meanwhile, DeSean Jackson's 48-yard reception set up Akers' third field goal, making the final score 23–11, the first time in NFL history a game has ended with that score.\nFor the second straight year, the No. 1 seed in the NFC lost in the divisional round as the Cowboys lost to the Giants in the 2007 playoffs. The top seed had advanced to the NFC Championship Game every year from 1988 to 2006. The Eagles also became the third No. 6 seed to advance to the conference championship game and first in the NFC.\nThis was the final playoff game at Giants Stadium, and the Eagles' last playoff victory until their Super Bowl winning 2017 season.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Eagles and Giants. New York won two of the prior three meetings. Philadelphia won 23–20 in the most recent meeting in the 2006 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 35, San Diego Chargers 24.\nPittsburgh gained 342 yards, did not commit any turnovers, held the ball for 36:30, and scored a touchdown in every quarter to defeat the Chargers. Willie Parker led the Steelers offense with 147 rushing yards and two touchdowns.\nHowever, the Chargers took the opening kickoff and scored with Philip Rivers' 48-yard touchdown pass to Vincent Jackson just two minutes into the game. Pittsburgh responded with a drive to the San Diego 34-yard line. On fourth down, rather than risk a long field goal attempt, they faked attempting to gain a first down and ran a surprise pooch punt with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who kicked the ball 25 yards to the San Diego 9-yard line. Following a three-and-out, Steelers receiver Santonio Holmes returned Mike Scifres' punt 65 yards for a touchdown to tie the game.\nLate in the second quarter, Pittsburgh tried to fool the Chargers with another trick play, this one a fake punt with a direct snap to safety Ryan Clark. But the Chargers backup linebacker Antwan Applewhite tackled Clark for a 4-yard loss on the Steelers 44-yard line. Several plays later, Nate Kaeding's 42-yard field goal gave San Diego a 10–7 lead on the first play after the two-minute warning. But with less than one minute left, Roethlisberger's 41-yard completion to Hines Ward moved the ball to the Chargers 3-yard line. On the next play, Parker's 3-yard touchdown run gave the Steelers a 14–10 halftime lead.\nPittsburgh dominated the third quarter, starting it out with a 77-yard drive that ended with Roethlisberger's 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller. Meanwhile, their defense limited San Diego to just one play in the entire quarter, an interception by linebacker Larry Foote that negated a 63-yard kickoff return by Darren Sproles.\nIn the fourth quarter, San Diego managed to make a goal line stand, tackling fullback Carey Davis for no gain on fourth down and 1 on the Chargers 1-yard line. After taking over at their own 1-yard line, the Chargers appeared to escape the shadow of their own end zone when Rivers hit Jacob Hester with a pass for an 11-yard gain. But a 10-yard sack by LaMarr Woodley and two incompletions forced San Diego to punt from their own 2, and Holmes returned the ball six yards to the 49-yard line. One play later, a 44-yard pass interference penalty on Eric Weddle in the end zone moved the ball to the 1-yard line, and running back Gary Russell scored a 1-yard touchdown run on the next play, increasing Pittsburgh's lead to 28–10.\nRivers then led the Chargers 73 yards in 10 plays and finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown pass to Legedu Naanee. But the Steelers stormed right back, with Parker rushing five times for 53 yards and finishing the drive with a 16-yard touchdown run. Following an exchange of punts, Rivers threw a 62-yard touchdown pass to Sproles, cutting the score to 35–24, but by then there was less than two minutes left in the game.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Chargers and Steelers, with San Diego winning both prior meeting in Pittsburgh, the most recent being 17–13 in the 1994 AFC Championship Game.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 18, 2009.\nFor the first time since 1979, both #1 seeds failed to get to the conference championship round. Both #1 seeds had been defeated by #6 seeds in the divisional round, the first time that this has happened. The only other occurrence was two years later.\nNFC: Arizona Cardinals 32, Philadelphia Eagles 25.\nArizona built up an 18-point halftime lead, but had to fight off an Eagles comeback attempt to earn their first conference championship and Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Arizona also became the second team to make it to the Super Bowl with a 9–7 record, joining the 1979 Los Angeles Rams. Arizona also became the first #4 seed to host a conference championship game. Until the 2021 season, this was the last time that any team seeded below #2 has hosted a conference championship game.\nArizona took the opening kickoff and stormed down the field with a 9-play, 80-yard drive. Edgerrin James rushed four times for 33 yards on the drive, while Kurt Warner completed all four of his passes for 44 yards, the last one a 9-yard touchdown pass to Larry Fitzgerald. Philadelphia responded on their ensuing possession, starting it off with a 21-yard scramble by Donovan McNabb to the Arizona 39-yard line and finishing it with a 45-yard field goal by David Akers.\nFollowing a punt, McNabb threw an interception to Aaron Francisco, but DeSean Jackson forced Francisco to fumble the ball during the return and Eagles right tackle Jon Runyan recovered it. After the fumble, Philadelphia drove into scoring range, but they ended the drive with no points when Akers missed a 47-yard field goal attempt, ending his postseason record streak of consecutive field goals at 19. On the next play, Warner threw a 62-yard touchdown pass to Fitzgerald off of a double pass play, giving the Cardinals a 14–3 lead. It was the second time Arizona found pay-dirt on a trick play during the playoffs (after a flea flicker in the wild card game).\nTwo plays into the Eagles next drive, McNabb completed a 47-yard pass to Kevin Curtis on the Arizona 19-yard line. But Arizona halted the drive at the 15, forcing Philadelphia to settle for a 33-yard field goal from Akers. Then the Cardinals took the ensuing kickoff and stormed down the field for another score. First James rushed for 22 yards, then Tim Hightower ran for 5, and then Warner completed a 16-yard pass to J. J. Arrington at the Eagles 30-yard line. Following two more Warner completions for 22 yards, he finished the drive with his third touchdown pass to Fitzgerald, making the score 21–6.\nAfter a Philadelphia punt, Warner led the Cardinals down the field again for more points. Starting with 1:31 left in the half, an unnecessary roughness penalty on Quintin Demps moved the ball to the Arizona 36. Then Warner completed a pair of passes to Jerheme Urban and Fitzgerald for 32 yards. A sack by linebacker Trent Cole pushed them out of field goal range, but on the next play, Warner's 13-yard completion to Anquan Boldin set up a 49-yard field goal by Neil Rackers, making the score 24–6 at halftime.\nPhiladelphia's defense made a major improvement in the third quarter, limiting Arizona to nine rushing yards, one completion, and no first downs. Meanwhile, the Eagles cut the score to 24–13 with a 90-yard scoring drive. The Eagles converted three third downs on the drive, including McNabb's 50-yard completion to Curtis on third and 19, and finished it off with a 6-yard touchdown reception by tight end Brent Celek. The Eagles quickly forced a punt on Arizona's ensuing possession, and Jackson returned it 13 yards to the Philadelphia 39-yard line. Five plays later, McNabb's threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Celek. Rather than try to cut their deficit to three points, Philadelphia decided to kick the extra point, but Akers' kick was no good, keeping the score at 24–19. It was the first time Akers had missed an extra point all season.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Philadelphia took their first lead of the game with McNabb's 62-yard touchdown pass to Jackson, giving his team a 1-point lead after the two-point conversion attempt failed. But the Cardinals responded with a 14-play, 74-yard drive to retake the lead for good, featuring a 6-yard run by Hightower on fourth down and 1 on the Eagles 49-yard line. Warner completed all five of his passes for 56 yards on the drive and finished it off with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Hightower with less than three minutes left. Then his 2-point conversion pass to Ben Patrick made the score 32–25. Finally, the Cardinals defense sealed the victory by forcing a turnover on downs at the Arizona 47-yard line. By the time Philadelphia got the ball back, only 10 seconds remained. In a desperate lateral play, Darnell Dockett intercepted Jackson's throw, ending the game.\nFitzgerald finished the game with nine receptions for 152 yards and three touchdowns. This gave him an NFL postseason record 419 total receiving yards in his three playoff games. McNabb's 375 passing yards and Warner's 145.7 passer rating were each third-highest recorded in the NFC championship game as of 2009. Both teams combined for an NFC postseason record 823 yards.\nFor the second time in five years, an all-Pennsylvania Super Bowl was denied. The Steelers lost the 2004 AFC Championship Game to the New England Patriots, who went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX over the Eagles 24–21.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Eagles and Cardinals. Both teams split the prior two meetings. The most recent ended with Philadelphia defeating the then-Chicago Cardinals 7–0 in the 1948 NFL Championship Game.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 23, Baltimore Ravens 14.\nPittsburgh held the Ravens to 184 yards and forced five turnovers, including three in the last 3:13 of the game, en route to their seventh Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Baltimore became the third consecutive road team (Pittsburgh was the last to win it), and the 11th out of 19 since the 1990 season, to lose the AFC title game and thus unable to duplicate their success in 2000 as a wild card team advancing to the Super Bowl.\nOn the first drive of the game, Ben Roethlisberger's 45-yard completion to Hines Ward set up a 34-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the first quarter, Deshea Townsend intercepted a pass from Joe Flacco and returned it to the Ravens 35-yard line. A few plays later, Santonio Holmes appeared to catch a 23-yard pass on the 1, but it was overruled by a Baltimore replay challenge and they ended up settling for a 42-yard field goal to make the score 6–0. Later on, the Ravens got a scoring opportunity when linebacker Ray Lewis forced a fumble from Pittsburgh running back Willie Parker and safety Jim Leonhard recovered it on the Steelers 43-yard line. But Baltimore turned the ball over on downs after failing to convert a first down on third and fourth down and 1.\nPittsburgh increased their lead to 13–0 on the second play of the second quarter with Roethlisberger's 65-yard touchdown pass to Holmes. But after several punts, a 45-yard punt return from Leonhard gave the Ravens a first down on the Pittsburgh 17-yard line. Two plays later, Willis McGahee scored a 3-yard touchdown run. Following an exchange of punts, Holmes returned a punt 25 yards to midfield. But the Steelers blew two chances to score before halftime. First, receiver Limas Sweed dropped a wide open pass near the end zone and the team ended up punting. However, a roughing the punter penalty allowed the Steelers to retain possession. Heath Miller's 14-yard reception on the next play moved the ball to the Ravens 21-yard line with 23 seconds left in the half and no timeouts left. Pittsburgh decided to run a few more plays before attempting a field goal, but Mewelde Moore's 8-yard reception in the middle of the field took too much time off the clock, and Pittsburgh could not spike the ball before time in the half expired.\nMidway through the third quarter, Pittsburgh drove 51 yards and scored with Reed's third field goal of the game, making the score 16–7. But in the fourth quarter, the Ravens took advantage of another key special teams play when Mitch Berger's punt went just 21 yards to the Baltimore 42-yard line. Flacco then led the Ravens 58 yards, completing all four of his passes for 44 yards on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by McGahee, cutting their deficit to 16–14. Baltimore's defense subsequently forced a punt and got the ball back on their own 14-yard line with just over six minutes left in the game. But four plays later, safety Troy Polamalu intercepted a pass from Flacco, ran all the way across the field, and took off for a 40-yard touchdown return, making the score 23–14. Pittsburgh then put the game away by forcing two more turnovers on the Ravens next two drives. First, a hit by Ryan Clark on McGahee forced a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Lawrence Timmons; McGahee suffered a concussion and was removed from the field on a stretcher. Then after a punt, Tyrone Carter intercepted a pass from Flacco with less than a minute left in the game.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Ravens and Steelers. Pittsburgh won the only prior meeting 27–10 in the 2001 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nSuper Bowl XLIII: Pittsburgh Steelers 27, Arizona Cardinals 23.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Steelers and Cardinals."

        "title": "David Jones (ice hockey)",
        "text": "David Jones (born August 10, 1984) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger who played for the Colorado Avalanche, Calgary Flames, and Minnesota Wild in the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPlaying career.\nEarly years.\nWhile playing with the Coquitlam Express minor junior team of the British Columbia Hockey League, Jones was drafted in his first year of eligibly as the Colorado Avalanche's last pick in the ninth round of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, 288th overall. After being selected to the BCHL First All-Star team he committed to play collegiate hockey at Dartmouth College in the ECAC. In his third season with the Big Green in 2006–07, he led the team with 44 points becoming just the third player in Dartmouth history to be named Ivy League Player of the Year, while also earning a selection as a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award.\nColorado Avalanche.\nAfter completing his junior year with the Big Green, Jones decided against returning for his senior year, signing a two-year entry level contract with the Avalanche on May 21, 2007. He was initially assigned in his first professional season of 2007–08 to the American Hockey League (AHL) with affiliate the Lake Erie Monsters before being recalled by the Avalanche on December 20, 2007. He made his debut the following night in a 4–3 victory over the New York Rangers on December 21, becoming the lowest selected Avalanche draft pick to play in the NHL. Highlighted by his skating speed despite a large frame, Jones scored 30 points in 45 games with the Monsters before his was again recalled for a third time and stayed with the Avalanche for the remainder of the season. On March 11, 2008, Jones scored his first career NHL goal in a 5–2 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers. He also tallied two assists and was named as the first star of the game.\nInjuries limited most of Jones' first full season in the NHL, and his third season with the Avalanche showed much promise. After scoring ten goals and six assists for 16 points in his 23rd game of the 2009–10 season, injury found Jones again on November 28, 2009, in a 3–2 shootout loss against the Minnesota Wild. He tangled up with Minnesota's Chuck Kobasew at center ice and landed hard with his knee in an awkward position just before teammate Paul Stastny tripped over him. He left the Pepsi Center with a torn anterior cruciate ligament and would miss the remainder of the regular season and playoffs.\nJones returned to complete his first full healthy season for the Avalanche in 2010–11, and despite losing a glimpse of his speed from his repaired ACL, he was rewarded with playing a career high 77 games and tied Matt Duchene for the team lead in goals with 27.\nGiven a one-year contract extension on June 29, 2011, Jones initially got off to a slow start in the 2011–12 season before responding with a strong second half to reach the 20 goal plateau for a second consecutive year, largely in part to establishing a partnership playing with longtime line-mate Stastny and the newly acquired Jamie McGinn to end the year. With the option of potentially exploring free-agency, Jones was instead signed to a four-year, $16 million contract keeping him with the team through the 2015–16 season, on June 7, 2012. In the first year of his new contract, during the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Jones struggled in compiling his worst professional season totals with only 3 goals and 9 points in 33 games.\nCalgary Flames.\nOn June 27, 2013, Jones' tenure with the Avalanche ended when he was traded along with Shane O'Brien to the Calgary Flames in exchange for Alex Tanguay and Cory Sarich.\nIn 2013-14, his first year with the Flames, Jones enjoyed modest success. He started out the year strong, scoring the Flames' first goal of the season (assisted by rookie Sean Monahan for his first NHL point) and recording four points in his first four games, but he was quickly injured and then injured again, missing 34 games over the course of the season. However, when in the lineup, Jones was generally effective, recording 9 goals and 8 assists for 17 points in 48 games.\nJones drastically improved in 2014-15 and started to finally live up to his $4 million salary. Though he missed some time early in the season after being injured in the season opener against the Edmonton Oilers, Jones returned firing at full cylinders. He enjoyed a three-game goal-scoring streak in November 2014 and recorded nine goals and twenty points in his first 41 games of the season. Jones ended up with 14 goals and 16 assists in 67 games, his best totals since the 2011–12 season, as the Flames qualified for the postseason for the first time since 2009.\nIn the playoffs, Jones found another gear, forming a thunderously effective line with Matt Stajan and Micheal Ferland. He scored his first career playoff goal in Game 1 of the Flames' quarter-final series against the Vancouver Canucks, tying the game at 1 midway through the third period. Jones also recorded three assists in the deciding sixth game of the series at the Scotiabank Saddledome, which the Flames won by a score of 7–4. Though the Flames lost in five games in the second round to the Anaheim Ducks, Jones finished the playoffs having recorded 2 goals and 3 assists in 11 games, along with 36 hits.\nIn the final year of his contract, Jones lost a step in 2015-16. He only recorded three points (all goals) in his first fifteen games of the season, but heated up somewhat entering the back-half of November. On November 17, 2015, Jones recorded his 100th career goal, the game-winner in a 3–2 game against the New Jersey Devils. On February 17, 2016, Jones recorded an odd goal against the Minnesota Wild. He received a drop-pass from Matt Stajan in the slot, and shot the puck towards the net; however, it deflected off a stick, off of the face of Wild defenseman Matt Dumba and into the net. The goal was Jones' last as a member of the Calgary Flames, as twelve days later, on February 29, 2016, he was traded at the deadline to the Minnesota Wild in exchange for goaltender Niklas Backstrom and a 6th-round pick (Matthew Phillips).\nMinnesota Wild.\nJones missed some time immediately after the trade with a work visa issue, but quickly was inserted into the Minnesota lineup on the top line alongside Mikael Granlund and Thomas Vanek in time for a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs on March 3, 2016. He scored his first goal with the team on March 5, a 3–2 shootout win over the Buffalo Sabres; however, he only scored one more goal in his remaining 14 regular season games with the Wild. In total, Jones scored 2 goals and 1 assist in 16 games with Minnesota, bringing his total to 11 goals and 7 assists for the 2015–16 season. The Wild qualified for the playoffs, and Jones recorded a single point (an assist) en route to a six-game defeat at the hands of the Dallas Stars.\nAnaheim Ducks and free agency.\nAn unrestricted free agent following the 2015–16 season from the Wild, Jones was not signed to an NHL deal in the offseason; instead, he settled for a professional tryout with the Anaheim Ducks, signed on September 23, 2016. He failed to make the team, however, and was released ten days later. Jones did not play professional hockey in 2016–17."

It was the final year of baseball's pre-expansion era, in which the teams that finished in first place in each league went directly to the World Series to face each other for the \"World Championship.\"\nThe playoff system was developed and debuted in ; with the addition of four expansion teams, both leagues were divided into two six-team divisions, with the winners competing in the League Championship Series.\nIt also featured the most dominant pitching year of the modern era, and was the first season for the Athletics in Oakland (having moved from Kansas City after the season).\nThe rookie minimum salary, $7,000 in 1967, was increased to $10,000 in 1968.\nThe Year of the Pitcher.\nIn Major League Baseball, the trend throughout the 1960s was of increased pitching dominance, caused by enforcing a larger strike zone (top of armpit to bottom of knee) beginning in 1963. The delicate balance of power between offense and defense reached its greatest tilt in favor of the pitcher by 1968.\nDuring what later became known as \"the year of the pitcher\", Bob Gibson of the Cardinals led the National League with 268 strikeouts, but also setting a modern earned run average record of 1.12 (a record regarded to be unbreakable today) and a still-standing World Series record of 17 strikeouts in Game 1, while their World Series opponent Denny McLain of the Detroit Tigers won 31 regular season games, the only player to reach the 30 win milestone since Dizzy Dean in 1934. His teammate Mickey Lolich won three complete games in the World Series, the last player to ever do so. Don Drysdale of the L.A. Dodgers pitched six consecutive shutout games in May and June, ending with scoreless innings – a record that stood until being beaten by Orel Hershiser in 1988. Juan Marichal of the San Francisco Giants led the National League with 26 wins and 30 complete games. Luis Tiant of the Cleveland Indians had the American League's lowest ERA at 1.60 and allowed an opponents batting average of only .168, a major league record (since broken by Pedro Martínez in ). He also led the AL with 9 shutouts. Both MVPs for that year were pitchers.\n339 shutouts were recorded in 1,619 regular-season games. The St. Louis Cardinals alone pitched 30 shutouts, the most in the majors. The 472 runs they allowed remains the lowest total ever recorded by any major league team in a 162-game season.\nRay Washburn of the Cardinals pitched a no-hitter against the Giants for a 2–0 victory on September 18 at Candlestick Park. The day before, Gaylord Perry pitched a no-hitter with a 1–0 Giants victory over the Cardinals. It was the first time in baseball history that no-hitters had been thrown in consecutive games and also that back-to-back no-hitters occurred in the same series.\nHitting was anemic. Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox had the lowest batting average of any league champion when his .301 was good enough for the American League batting title. The AL's collective slugging average of .339 remains the lowest since 1915 (when the game was still in the so-called dead-ball era), while the collective batting average of .230 is the all-time lowest. The Chicago White Sox scored only 463 runs during the regular season and were shut out a league-high 23 times. The shutout record was eclipsed in 1972 by the Texas Rangers, who were blanked 26 times in 154 games.\nAfter the season, the Rules Committee, seeking to restore balance, restored the pre-1963 strike zone and lowered the height of the pitching mound from . Four expansion teams joined the majors, and batting averages in returned to their historical averages; the large statistical advantage of pitching over batting in the major leagues during 1968 has not been seen since.\nPostseason.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nTelevision coverage.\nNBC was the exclusive national TV broadcaster of MLB, airing the weekend \"Game of the Week\", the All-Star Game, and the World Series."

Newhouser ended the season with an ERA of 1.81, a record of 25 wins and 9 losses, and 212 strikeouts. Both of them helped lead the Detroit Tigers to a World Series win, and Newhouser remarked that Eddie Mayo was the driving force behind the 1945 pennant chase and that Mayo was a \"take-charge kind of guy in our field.\"\nThe NL Most Valuable Player Award went to Chicago Cubs first baseman and outfielder Phil Cavarretta. He ended the season with an impressive batting average of .355 and an on-base-percentage of .455. The second-place finisher was Boston Braves player Tommy Holmes who finished the season with a batting average of .352 and an impressive slugging percentage of .577.\nHal Newhouser won the pitching Triple Crown in addition to the official AL MVP Award.

Given a cadetship with the paper, he reported on Australian rules football and cricket from 1925. In 1925, he wrote to Plum Warner, the editor of \"The Cricketer\" magazine, complaining about its poor coverage of Australian cricket. Warner invited him to become the periodical's Australian correspondent, and Robinson continued contributing to it until the early 1980s.\nIn 1930, Robinson was recruited to the editorial staff of a new daily paper, \"The Star\". Four years later, he accompanied the Australian team on its tour of England. Subsequently, he toured with the Australians in 1948, 1953, 1956 and 1961 (to England); and to South Africa in 1957–58 and the West Indies in 1954–55. He made a number of tours of India and Pakistan, writing for the \"Times of India\" and \"Sportsweek\" in Mumbai. After \"The Star\" closed he worked briefly in radio.\nInvited to join the staff of \"The Daily Telegraph\" by Sir Frank Packer, Robinson relocated to Sydney in 1939. He published his first cricket book, \"Between Wickets\", in 1946 after the manuscript was recommended to the William Collins publishing house by Neville Cardus. He retired as a full-time journalist in 1970 and published \"The Wildest Tests\" two years later. Awarded a Commonwealth Literary Fund fellowship and a grant from the Literature Board of the Council for the Arts, Robinson began work on his \"magnum opus\", a series of essays about Australia's cricket captains. Released in 1975, \"On Top Down Under\" won the English Cricket Society's literary award for 1976.\nIn his latter years, he suffered from poor health but he continued writing though he was legally blind. He was admitted to Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital after a fall at home. Complications followed and he died from an intestinal blockage on 6 July 1982, two days before his 77th birthday."

        "text": "William Ralph Cunningham (July 13, 1872 – September 1957) was an American football center for the University of Michigan, and the first All-American selection for the Michigan Wolverines football program.\nCunningham was born at Volant, Pennsylvania in July 1872. His father, Valentine Cunningham, was a native of Grove City, Pennsylvania.\nCunningham was a 5-foot, 9-inch, 180-pound native of Grove City, Pennsylvania who played center for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1897 to 1899. Chosen as an All-American in 1898, he was the first University of Michigan football player to be so honored. The 1898 Wolverines went 10-0 and won the Western Conference (now known as the Big Ten Conference) championship. The first great Michigan football team, the 1898 group outscored its opponents 205 to 26. They shut out Michigan Agricultural College (39-0) and Notre Dame (23-0) before traveling to Chicago for a final game against Amos Alonzo Stagg's University of Chicago team on November 24, 1898. Led by Cunningham, Michigan came out on top, 12–11, for its first Western Conference championship.\nA newspaper account described Michigan's victory this way: \"The western football championship goes to Michigan. On a field that was simply perfect for fast football, and before a crowd of 12,000 the maroons of Chicago went down before the maize and blue of Michigan today by a score of 12 to 11. . . . The Michigan line, in which big holes were torn by the light Northwestern team, was simply impregnable today, with the exception of about ten minutes in the second half, when the Chicago men pushed their opponents aside with an apparent ease.\"\nAnother article noted: \"Michigan, with the exception of one or two double passes, relied almost altogether on straight football, line bucking and runs around the end. Chicago, on the contrary, used trick plays throughout but the team work was of a high order, as shown by both teams.\"\nBased on his performance in the Chicago game, Stagg recommended Cunningham as an All-American. At that time, the All-American selections were made by Caspar Whitney, who preceded Walter Camp in that role. Michigan's 12–11 victory over Chicago in 1898 also served as the inspiration for Louis Elbel to write The Victors, Michigan's fight song. Elbel's lyric, \"Champions of the West,\" refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship for the first time in the school's history.\nCunningham's selection as an All-American in 1898 \"broke the unwritten tradition that All-Americans had to come from Yale, Harvard, Princeton or a few other Eastern schools.\" \nCunningham became a medical missionary in China. In a December 1921 passport applications, Cunningham identified himself as a physician with his permanent residence in Grove City, Pennsylvania. He stated that he had left the United States in October 1904, and returned in October 1912. He traveled to China again as a medical missionary in 1922.\nCunningham was the first in a long line of University of Michigan centers to be named All-American, including Germany Schulz, Ernie Vick, Jack Blott, Maynard Morrison, Chuck Bernard, David Molk, and Olusegun Oluwatimi.\nIn 1955, Cunningham was named to the all-time Medical All-American Team, composed of former All-American football players who later became doctors. The list was compiled and published by \"Spectrum,\" a medical journal. At that time, Cunningham was retired and living in Grove City, Pennsylvania. He died in 1957 at the age of 84.\nIn 2005, Cunningham was selected as one of the 100 greatest Michigan football players of all time by the \"Motown Sports Revival,\" ranking 30th on the all-time team."

        "text": "Robert Lanier Jackson (born February 16, 1940) is an American former football coach and college player who was a professional assistant coach in the National Football League (NFL) for 21 seasons, including three as an offensive coordinator. In his NFL tenure, Jackson coached five Pro Bowl running backs, including at least one in three of his five stops where he has tutored the running backs. The list consists of Pro Football Hall of Fame player Marshall Faulk (St. Louis Rams 2000–02), Stephen Davis (Washington Redskins 1999), Terry Allen (Washington Redskins 1996), Brian Mitchell (Washington Redskins, 1995), and Marion Butts (San Diego Chargers, 1990–91).\nEarly life.\nJackson was born and raised on a small rural farm in Forsyth, Georgia. He was raised by his parents Anice Rocquemore and Roy Henry Jackson, who was a veteran of World War I that was wounded in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.\nJackson's first experience with football would shape his life. In the 7th grade, he tried out for football and after the 3rd day, the football coach, in front of the team, stripped Jackson's uniform off him on the practice field and gave it to a bigger kid. Jackson was humiliated and worked on his running skills and tried out again in the 9th grade, soon becoming the starting running back.\nJackson attended and played high school football at Mary Persons High School. He later played college football at South Georgia College in 1958 under legendary Florida State University head coach Bobby Bowden and assistant coach Vince Gibson. In 1959, Bowden was offered the head football coaching job at Samford (then called Howard College) and Jackson followed Bowden to Birmingham, Alabama.\nFrom 1959 to 1962, Jackson was a starter on all sides of the Howard football team and was one of the last of the 60 Minute Men, football players who played the entire 60 minutes of the football game. On offense, he was the running back, on the defense as a defensive back, and was on the punt and kickoff return teams. While at Howard, Jackson was a two-time small college All-American running back. In numerous interviews, Bowden has said that Jackson was the best all around player that he ever coached. Over the course of his Howard career, Jackson had 287 rushing attempts for 2,084 yards, 27 touchdowns and 7.3 yards per carry - Samford University's all-time record for highest yards-per-carry - while the team went 31–6 and received bowl bids to the Textile Bowl and the Golden Isle Bowl.\nWhile at Howard College, Jackson met his wife Nancy Eleanor Howard. Nancy Howard was the reigning Howard College Beauty Queen at the time and when Jackson decided he wanted a date with her, Jackson and 4 other football players kidnapped Nancy Howard as she was walking with her boyfriend on campus. Nancy Howard was held until she agreed to go on a date with Jackson and has been with him ever since.\nAfter graduating from Howard College with a bachelor's degree physical education, Jackson went on to earn his master's degree in physical education from Peabody College, now a part of Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, Tennessee. From 1963 to 1964, Jackson coached football and track at Shades Valley High School in Homewood, Alabama.\nCollege coaching career.\nIn 1965, Jackson was brought on as a volunteer football coach under head coach Bill Peterson at Florida State University. In 1966, Jackson became the linebacker and defensive end coach and stayed with Coach Peterson thru the 1969 Season.

During his six years in Washington, the team produced a 1,000-yard running back three times, including Terry Allen (1995–96) and Stephen Davis (1999). Allen finished third in the NFC in rushing both times he reached the plateau, while Davis led the conference in that category in 1999. As a unit, the Redskins topped the 4.0-yard average per carry mark on four occasions.\nFrom 2000 to 2002, Jackson was the associate head coach, offensive coordinator, and running backs coach for the St. Louis Rams under head coach Mike Martz. In his three years as the offensive coordinator for the Greatest Show on Turf in St. Louis, the Rams led the NFL in total offense in 2000 and 2001 as they averaged 442.2 and 418.1 yards per game, respectively, in those two years. in 2000, the Rams offense scored 540 points, averaging 33.8 points per game.

He also led all NFC running backs in receptions all three years, as he averaged more than 81 catches a season over that stretch. The Rams' running game averaged more than 4.0 yards per attempt all three seasons.\nIn 2003, Jackson retired from the game and moved to his farm in Alabama. In 2007, Jackson was lured out of retirement by head coach Cam Cameron to coach the running backs for the Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins running backs averaged 4.0 yards per attempt for the season, and Ronnie Brown led the team with 5.1 yards per carry for the season. After the 2007 season, Jackson retired again to his Alabama farm, raising cattle and public speaking."

The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted once by mail to select from major league players retired less than 25 years, and elected no one. Meanwhile, the Old-Timers Committee, with jurisdiction over earlier players and other figures, did not meet. For the first time, except years without any election activity, there were no new Hall of Fame members.\nBBWAA election.\nThe 10-year members of the BBWAA had the authority to select any players active in 1925 or later, provided they had not been active in 1949. The year before, a 25-year moving boundary regarding player activity had been established which would remain in the years to come. Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall.\nA new rule had been added for the 1950 ballot. Writers could not vote for anyone currently wearing a baseball uniform, which included some qualified players who were now coaches on teams. This rule would be dropped after a few years.\nA total of 168 ballots were cast, with 1,481 individual votes for 100 specific candidates, an average of 8.82 per ballot; 126 votes were required for election. Once again, no candidate received 75% of the vote and the Hall of Fame would not elect any new players in 1950. Candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\":"

He was born in Indianapolis, Indiana.\nRiley was the starting quarterback and punt returner for most of the 1927 season at the University of Notre Dame. He is mostly remembered for his last game with the team—a controversial 7–6 victory against USC at Soldier Field in Chicago before the largest crowd ever to witness a football game at that time, estimated to be 120,000 in attendance.\nWhile clinging to the one-point lead late in the game, Riley fielded a USC punt at his own goal line and appeared to fumble it out of the end zone, which would have given the Trojans a safety and an 8–7 lead. But the play was ruled a muff, and therefore a touchback. Notre Dame would hang on for the win.\nIn 1930, Riley was hired by fellow Notre Dame alum Tom Lieb to be his assistant football coach at Loyola University of Los Angeles. One year later, Riley became the head football coach for the University of New Mexico and remained there for three years, posting a record of 7–13–3. He died on July 19, 1971."

        "text": "The Waterloo Jaycees Greater Waterloo Open Golf Classic is the oldest and largest golf tournament in the state of Iowa. It has been played annually since 1934, and celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2008. It is traditionally played over the course of third week/weekend in the month of July.\nThe tournament actually consists of five separate tournaments which are organized and run simultaneously by a volunteer committee of Waterloo Jaycees. The tournaments are played on the three public golf courses in Waterloo, Iowa.\nDon Narveson Memorial Youth Golf Clinic.\nThe Waterloo Open has become nearly a week-long event, and kicks off annually with the Don Narveson Memorial Youth Golf Clinic. The Youth Clinic takes place at South Hills Golf Course on Wednesday morning of the week of the event. Local youth interested in becoming more acquainted with the game of golf (as well as those who already play) can receive one-on-one interaction with golf professionals to refine their swing, receive putting instruction, and learn basic golf etiquette.\nPro-Am Tournament.\nThe tournament itself begins on Thursday morning, when the Pro-Am tournament begins at Irv Warren Memorial golf course. The Waterloo Open receives sponsorship from many local and national businesses, and these sponsors' generosity is repaid partially by being invited to play a round of golf with a professional golfer. Groups of 5 (one professional with 4 amateurs/sponsors) tee it up on either Thursday or Friday. \nThe professionals compete against each other for a special Pro-Am tournament purse. For those professionals who may not have played in the Waterloo Open before, the Pro-Am tournament serves as a practice round played on the course on which they will compete later that weekend in a competitive environment.\nThe amateur/sponsor groups also compete for nominal gift certificate prizes awarded to the best overall teams.\nAmateur tournament.\nThe Amateur and Senior Amateur tournaments begin on Friday the week of the event. The amateur field consists of 272 golfers, one half of which play at South Hills Golf Course on Friday, while the other one half play at Gates Park Golf Course. The groups switch courses on Saturday and play a second round of golf. After Saturday's round, the top 36 amateur golfers (and ties), along with the top 4 senior amateur golfers (and ties) make the cut and are invited to play a third championship round along with the professional golfers on Sunday at Irv Warren Golf Course. The amateur with the lowest combined 3-day score is the champion and receives a prize in the form of gift certificates redeemable at the local golf course pro shops.\nProfessional tournament.\nThe main events of the Waterloo Open are the Professional and Senior Professional golf tournaments. 192 professionals compete in a one-day qualifying \"shoot-out\" on Saturday at Irv Warren Golf Course. After Saturday's round, a cut is made and the top 60 golfers in the Open division, as well as the top 20 golfers in the senior division, play a second round on Sunday for the championship.\nBecause of the Waterloo Open's relatively large top prize compared to other tournaments of its size ($40,000 to the golfer who wins in 2008) and its reputation as one of the most well-run and hospitable tournaments among professional golfers, it attracts many up-and-coming young golfers from all over the country. Golfers who have competed in the Waterloo Open include current PGA professionals Zach Johnson, Woody Austin, Tom Lehman, and George McNeill."

In June, the International Cricket Council discussed Bangladesh's membership and they decided to wait for the MCC tour before allowing Bangladesh membership.\nThe MCC team.\nApart from Popplewell, whose first-class career was yet to begin, and Lofting, who never played first-class cricket, all the team had had first-class careers, of varying lengths, but only Barclay and Vernon were still playing.\nThe tour.\nThe MCC team arrived at Dhaka on December 27, 1976. On December 29, they left for Rajshahi for the first 2-day match against the North Zone. However, the main attraction of the tour was the three-day unofficial Test match at Dhaka against the Bangladesh national side, which drew a total attendance of some 90,000.\nNotes.\nRaquibul Hasan, one of the most respected cricketers in the country earned the distinction of leading the North Zone side.\nShamim Kabir led Bangladesh in the historic match at Dhaka. The other players were, Raquibul Hasan, Mainul Haque Mainu, Syed Ashraful Haque, Omar Khaled Rumy, SM Faruk, Shafiq-ul-Haq Hira (WK), Yousuf Babu, Daulatuzzaman, Dipu Roy Chowdhury &amp; Nazrul Kader Lintu.\nThe positive report of the MCC about the condition of Bangladesh cricket helped Bangladesh get associate membership of the International Cricket Council in July 1977. The interest created by the tour played a big part in the rise in popularity of cricket in Bangladesh through the 1980s."

Algonquin has the distinction of being one of the few clubs west of the Mississippi to occupy the same location for over a century.\nIn 1919, a fire destroyed a significant part of Algonquin’s clubhouse, and until a new clubhouse was completed in 1920, members used the McArdle home on Algonquin Lane.

Following his playing career, he was a high school football head coach in his native Hawaii.\nEarly years.\nBorn and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Francis attended Kamehameha Schools in Honolulu and starred in football and graduated in 1954.\nFrancis played college football in the Pacific Coast Conference at Oregon State College in Corvallis, where he was a left halfback from 1954 to 1957 for head coaches Kip Taylor and Tommy Prothro. As a junior in 1956, Francis led the Beavers to the Rose Bowl, where they lost to Iowa, 35–19. He rushed for 73 yards and contributed 207 yards of total offense in the losing effort.\nFrancis was named the team MVP for the 1956 and 1957 seasons. He won the Pop Warner Trophy as the outstanding senior player on the Pacific Coast, and the Hayward Award as the outstanding amateur athlete in the state of Oregon in 1957. Oregon State was Coast champion again with Oregon, whom they defeated in the Civil War but the PCC had a no-repeat clause for the Rose Bowl, so the Webfoots went instead.\nPlaying career.\nFrancis was selected in the fifth round of the 1958 NFL Draft, 51st overall, by the one of the top drafts by a team in NFL history; ahead of Francis, the Packers selected linebacker Dan Currie (3rd), fullback Jim Taylor (15th), linebacker Ray Nitschke (36th), and guard Jerry Kramer (39th).\nAs a rookie in 1958 under first-year head coach Ray \"Scooter\" McLean, Francis started one game as quarterback, the season finale, and played behind Babe Parilli and Bart Starr in the Packers' worst-ever season, finishing with a league low McLean's one-year contract was not renewed; he resigned days after the season and was succeeded in January 1959 by Vince Lombardi. Francis saw limited action that season, relieving starter Lamar McHan on November 1, then didn't play again, as Starr became the starter. Francis broke his left leg early in training camp in 1960, ending his season, then incurred a knee injury in an intrasquad game in 1961, and was waived.\nFrancis then played 1½ seasons in the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Montreal Alouettes in 1961 and 1962. He was sidelined most of 1961 and had off-season knee surgery.\nAfter football.\nUpon retiring from pro football, Francis returned to Corvallis and was an assistant at Oregon State under head coach Prothro in 1963 and 1964. He then returned to Hawaii to become a physical education teacher and football coach at Pearl City High School, and retired in 2001.\nPersonal life.\nFrancis married three times and fathered eleven children: nine sons and two daughters.\nA son, Jon Francis (b.1964), played running back for Colorado State in the WAC and Boise State in the Big Sky Conference. He was selected in the seventh round (184th overall) of the 1986 NFL draft by the New York Giants and played for the Los Angeles Rams in 1987. Another son, Ikaika Alama-Francis (b.1984), was a defensive end for the University of Hawaii and was selected in the second round (58th overall) of the 2007 NFL draft by the Detroit Lions. He played five seasons in the league, two with Detroit and three with the Miami Dolphins.\nDeath and honors.\nAfter an extended illness, Francis died at his Kaneohe home at age 76 in 2013.\nHe was elected to the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1981."

Their head coach was Roy Williams. The team played its home games in the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nSchedule and results.\nThe Tar Heels began the season ranked atop both major polls, and stayed there for the first two months of the season despite closer-than-expected games against Davidson and Clemson. They suffered their first loss of the season against Maryland on January 19. Three games later, point guard Ty Lawson twisted his ankle and missed most of February. Despite this, the Tar Heels didn't miss a beat, going 8–1 the rest of the way. They regained the top spot in the polls in late February and held it for the rest of the season. They clinched their 26th ACC regular season title by avenging their earlier loss to Duke in the last game of the season.\nIn the ACC Tournament held in Charlotte, the top-seeded Tar Heels defeated Florida State, Virginia Tech and Clemson to win their 17th conference tournament title. In so doing, they went into the NCAA Tournament with a 32–2 record—the most wins going into the tourney in school history.\nIn the NCAA Tournament, the Tar Heels were seeded first in the East Regional, and were also the overall top seed in the tournament. They routed Mount St. Mary's and Arkansas while playing just 30 minutes from campus at the RBC Center in Raleigh. They were no less dominant in the regional phase in Charlotte, scoring convincing wins over Washington State and Louisville to make their 17th trip to the Final Four, but in their national semifinal game, they lost to Kansas, who went on to win the national championship. Remarkably, the Tar Heels made the Final Four while not having to leave the state of North Carolina for a little over a month (a total of 10 games), and while notching two losses at the Smith Center—an arena where they have traditionally been all but unbeatable. They also set a school record for wins in a season, with 36. With Memphis having its 38-win 2007–08 season vacated by the NCAA, the 2007–08 Tar Heels' 36 wins are now the second-most in Division I history.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular Season\n!colspan=9| Las Vegas Invitational\n!colspan=9| \n!colspan=9| ACC tournament\n!colspan=9| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "This is a list of cricketers called for throwing in top-class cricket matches in Australia. In the sport of cricket, strict rules govern the method of bowling the ball. The rules relate to the bending of the arm at the elbow, the extent of which has always been open to interpretation by the umpires. More recently, the International Cricket Council has attempted to codify the maximum permissible flexing of the elbow as 15 degrees.\nWhen a player is found by the umpire to have delivered the ball contrary to those rules, the umpire will call a no-ball and he is said to have been called for throwing. Where public opinion is that a player's bowling action appears to be that he routinely throws, he is said to have a 'suspect' or an 'illegal' action, or more derogatorily, is said to be a 'chucker'. The issue is often highly emotive with accusers considering that deliveries with an illegal action are akin to cheating.\nOver the years, a number of players have been called in top-class matches – Test matches, One Day Internationals and domestic first-class matches – invariably creating controversy and occasionally destroying cricket careers. Often the player has been able to modify his action to appease his critics and the umpires, but more commonly, especially when the bowler has been called on more than one occasion, his career in international cricket is effectively ended."

        "title": "2007 Grand Slam of Darts",
        "text": "The 2007 PartyBets.com Grand Slam of Darts was the inaugural staging of the darts tournament, the Grand Slam of Darts, held by the Professional Darts Corporation. The tournament invited the best performing players from the PDC and its rival the British Darts Organisation. There had been two previous head-to-head matches between the champions of the two organisations and a few tournaments have also featured BDO v PDC clashes. This tournament was the first of its kind to be held in the United Kingdom.\nThe 2007 tournament was staged at the Wolverhampton Civic Hall, Wolverhampton, England from 17–25 November 2007. Phil Taylor won the title, beating Andy Hamilton 18–11 in the final. In one of the early group matches which may not have stood out at the time, John Part narrowly beat Mark Webster 5–4 and less than two months later the two players became the World Champions of their respective organisations.\nFormat.\nThe 32 players were split into eight groups of four players with the top two from each group qualifying for the last 16 knockout stages. Each player was therefore guaranteed three matches in the competition. Two points were awarded for a win. All group games were best of 9 legs, the second-round games were extended to best of 19 legs, the semi-finals best of 25 legs, and the final best of 35 legs.\nPrize money.\nPartyPoker.net increased the prize fund for the event from the original announcement of £250,000 to £300,000 making it the second richest tournament in 2007 – ahead of both the Premier League and the BDO World Championship.\nControversy.\nControversy hit the tournament in May when it was confirmed by the BDO that the Winmau World Masters had been moved from its original dates of 26–28 October to a new date of 16–18 November, clashing directly with the Grand Slam. This meant that players from the BDO were forced into a direct choice between competing at the Masters for valuable ranking points or taking their place at the Grand Slam for better prize money. BDO World Champion Martin Adams almost immediately confirmed that he would participate in the Masters, though he was the only BDO player to do so. Adams went out in the quarter-finals of the World Masters meaning his pay cheque of £1,250 was significantly less than the £4,000 he would have received simply for turning up at the Grand Slam. Adams also declined the chance to compete in 2008, even though the two tournaments did not clash as the Masters was moved to December.\nQualifiers.\nThe PDC Chairman Barry Hearn announced on 21 February 2007 that all major tournament finalists for the past two years from both the BDO and PDC will be invited to the event. Also World Championship semi-finalists from the same period would receive an invite.\nThe tournaments used for the qualifying criteria were the two World Championships, the World Matchplay, World Grand Prix and World Masters (2006 only), UK Open, Las Vegas Desert Classic, Premier League, World Series of Darts, International Darts League and the World Darts Trophy with the field set at 32 players.\nBDO players Gary Anderson, Mark Webster, Shaun Greatbatch, Niels de Ruiter, Phill Nixon and Scott Waites all accepted invites to the event leaving Martin Adams (the BDO World Champion) as the only player to have rejected the opportunity to play. He participated in the 2007 Winmau World Masters instead, losing at the quarter-final stage.\nDraws.\nGroup stages.\nAll matches race-to-5/best of 9.\nNB in Brackets: Number = Seeds; BDO = BDO Darts player; RQ = Ranking qualifier; Q = Qualifier&lt;br&gt;\nNB: P = Played; W = Won; L = Lost; LF = Legs for; LA = Legs against; +/- = Plus/minus record, in relation to legs; Average = 3-dart average; Pts = Points\nGroup A.\n17 November\n18 November\n19 November\nGroup B.\n17 November\n18 November\n19 November\nGroup C.\n17 November\n18 November\n19 November\nGroup D.\n17 November\n18 November\n19 November\nGroup E.\n17 November\n18 November\n20 November\nGroup F.\n17 November\n18 November\n20 November\nGroup G.\n17 November\n18 November\n20 November\nGroup H.\n17 November\n18 November\n20 November\nTelevision coverage.\nThe tournament was televised by ITV. The first afternoon session on 17 November, the Sunday afternoon session on 18 November, the semi-finals, and the final were all broadcast live on ITV1. The rest of the tournament was shown live on ITV4. It was ITV's first televised darts tournament since they ceased coverage of the Winmau World Masters in 1988 – although they did show the first Clash of Champions match between Phil Taylor and Raymond van Barneveld in 1999.\nThe ITV Sport team consisted of lead presenter Matt Smith, analysts Steve Beaton and Alan Warriner-Little, and commentators John Rawling from ITV Boxing, Stuart Pyke from Sky Sports and Nigel Pearson of talkSPORT."

        "text": "The Sri Lankan team on their way back home from Australia visited Dhaka in March 1985. It was a very short tour; there was just one three-day fixture, played under searing March heat. Nevertheless, for the local side specially, this match produced some important achievements.\nScores in brief.\nBatting first, Bangladesh scored 139 in the first innings. The newly appointed skipper Gazi Ashraf Lipu and Munir both scored 39. (Tariquzzaman Munir was at that time at the top of his form. Just days earlier he had scored the highest individual score in domestic cricket, 308 for Dhaka University in the semi-final of the National Cricket Championship against Dhaka District. There he had shared a partnership of 447 with Athar Ali Khan).\nFor Bangladesh the tail collapsed against the left-arm spin of the veteran Somachandra de Silva, who took 4/28.\nIn reply, the Lankan innings started disastrously as Amal Silva and Sidath Wettimuny both fell cheaply to medium pacer Jahangir Shah. The middle order however, repaired the damage and Sri Lanka eventually declared at 429/9. Ranjan Madugalle narrowly missed his hundred (95), Ravi Ratnayeke, better known as a fast bowler, blasted 79*. Jahangir Shah finished with 4/89.\nBangladesh batted in their 2nd innings and saved the match by scoring 152/6. Skipper Gazi Ashraf again led from the front, scoring a 45, and the veteran Raquibul Hasan proved his worth to the side with 32.\nImportance.\nThis game is significant in Bangladesh's cricket history for a number of reasons. First, the draw achieved was highly creditable. Specially, the memory of the disaster that Bangladesh had faced against Sri Lanka during the 1977–78 season was partly erased. Second, this was the first time Gazi Ashraf captained the national side. He was to remain captain until 1990. During this period Bangladesh cricket went through its most important changes.\nFinally, three youngsters, Minhajul Abedin, Athar Ali Khan and Gholam Nousher Prince, played for Bangladesh in this match. Although all of them failed to impress they all went on to play vital roles in later years."

At this point, the club considered merging with St Kilda, but this proposal was voted down by the members and instead the club moved onto the Harry Trott Oval, also located in Albert Park. Over the following decade, the club's finances waned and it was frustrated by the poor quality of the ground and a poor relationship with Parks Victoria; so, in 2005–06, the club relocated to the outer suburban Casey Fields, and it was renamed to reflect its new home.\nThe First XI has been Victoria's premier club on seven occasions: in the pre-district era 1872–73, 1878–79, 1888–89, 1891–92; and in the district era 1952–53, 1959–60 and 1967–68.\nThe club's team of the 20th century includes five players who captained Australia and three others who captained state teams:"

The season runs from September to April, which is in contrast to the majority of other major domestic rugby league competitions worldwide. The clubs play each other home and away then they enter into a play-off series culminating with a Grand Final. The competition is the continuation and first division of the French Rugby League Championship, which has been in existence since 1934.\nThe league is generally regarded as the third most important domestic championship in the world, behind Australia's National Rugby League and the United Kingdom's Super League, and ahead of the NZRL National Competition, PNGNRL, Balkan Super League and Rhino Cup.\nHistory.\nThe French Rugby League Championship began in 1934, the first one being the only one where it was won by the team finishing top of the table on points and not by a play-off series. \nThe Elite One Championship was founded in 2002 after the French Rugby League Championship was split into two divisions. The format stayed the same with teams playing each other home and away, before a play-off series would determine the Champions. The club finishing bottom would not be automatically relegated, it would be dependent on whether the club finishing top of Elite Two Championship either wanted to be promoted or their facilities were up to standard.\nResults.\nSource: \nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nUnlike, for instance, the BBC, France Television didn't offer any program to the French public about Rugby League. \nSport en France cover the Championship across their television platforms nationwide. Coverage includes the match of the week and one match from each week of the playoffs including the Grand Final.\nFrom 2020, some Elite 1 games are televised by a local channel ViàOccitanie; this is a free-to-air channel in the South of France but they are also available on the internet and via the triple play internet devices. Therefore, they offer, indirectly, free nationwide coverage of the domestic championship.\nPresently, French clubs have to fund the broadcast of their own games or to televise their own matches themselves via the social networks or YouTube.\nRadio.\nRadio Marseillette, a local Southern radio, has rugby league debate and news every Saturday from 10:00 to 12:00. They also have commentary on some Elite League games.\nPress.\nThe French national mainstream media barely follow the game. Very occasionally, some articles about the sport are published in newspapers such as Le Monde, Le Figaro or the national Sport newspaper L'Équipe.\nNevertheless, there is undoubtedly a French specificity: the Weekly Rugby Union magazine Midi Olympique has a one-page section devoted to Rugby League. However, only two local newspapers genuinely cover the game; L'Indépendant ( based in the South of France) and la Dépêche du Midi (based in the South west of the country).\nThe British Rugby League press cover this championship; for example magazines like Rugby Leaguer &amp; League Express offer a weekly report of the games. In Australia, the monthly publication Rugby League Review offer a few columns about the games as well."

        "text": "William Julius Coleman (March 8, 1869 – September 2, 1934) was an American college football player and coach, as well as a collegiate rower and track and field athlete. He was the first coach for the Kansas football team, when he served as a player-coach in 1890. He also competed on the KU rowing team, winning the 1 mile 2 man rowing competition along with Charles Orton Lasley in 1892 with a time of 6:04. Coleman was a track and field athlete at Kansas as well. He ran both the 100-yard dash and the mile, coming in second in the 100-yard dash and first in the mile with a time of 5 minutes and 19.5 seconds at the 1892 official KU Field Day.\nEarly life and playing career.\nColeman was born in 1869 in Kentucky to Leonidas William Coleman (July 20, 1842–1929) and Fena Coleman. At the age of one his family moved from Kentucky to rural Chase County, Kansas just outside Strong City where he went on to become an athletic star at Chase County high school in Cottonwood Falls, Kansas. After graduating from Chase County high school he attended the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas where he played football from 1890 through 1894. He was the starting center and lettered all five years he was at KU.\nFor several years during Coleman's time at Kansas, KU ran what was known as the Flying V formation on offense where the center, Will's position, is the point of the \"V\" leading the way for the ball carrier and other blockers and takes the brunt of the punishment from defensive players. This formation proved so dangerous and lead to so many severe injuries that it was later banned in both collegiate and pro football.\nCoaching career.\nColeman coached the Jayhawks in what is widely considered the first college football game played in the state of Kansas. He served as the first head coach for the Kansas football team, coaching for a single season in 1890 and tallying a mark of 1–2. The team actually went 2–1 on the field, but their last game against Baker University, which was initially won by KU with a score of 14 to 12, was awarded to Baker on a technicality.\nThe 1890 Kansas Jayhawks football team was not officially associated with the University of Kansas. Coleman was not an employee or a faculty member of the University of Kansas, but instead a KU student who played center on the football team. The first Jayhawks football coach recognized by the University of Kansas was faculty member Edwin Mortimer Hopkins, who helmed the team the next season in 1891.\nLater life and death.\nColeman his wife while attending KU. They later married in 1895 upon his graduation from the University of Kansas. They had one child, a daughter.\nWill's first job after college was as the superintendent of Haskell Indian Nations University, also located in Lawrence, Kansas. He held this job for more than 15 years before changing careers and becoming a traveling salesman in 1910. In 1918 he moved his family to Kansas City, Missouri until later moving to Mission, Kansas and then Overland Park, Kansas where he eventually died in 1934."

        "title": "Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents the University of Denver. They play at Magness Arena in Denver, Colorado. The Pioneers are a member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). Previously, they were members of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), from its creation in 1959 to the end of its men's hockey competition in 2013.\nThe Pioneers have won the most all-time NCAA National Hockey Championships with ten (1958, 1960, 1961, 1968, 1969, 2004, 2005, 2017, 2022, 2024). The Pioneers have won 15 regular season conference championships (13 WCHA, 2 NCHC) and 14 conference playoff championships (15 WCHA, 2 NCHC).\nAbout 75 Pioneers have gone on to play in the National Hockey League, including Keith Magnuson, Kevin Dineen, Matt Carle (2006 Hobey Baker Award winner), Paul Stastny and Will Butcher (2017 Hobey Baker Award winner).\nHistory.\nSource:\nEarly years.\nIn 1949 the DU Arena, a former WWII surplus drill hall from Idaho was reassembled in Denver with an ice plant, giving the university the ability to properly field an ice hockey team for the first time. Before the end of the year Vern Turner, the rink manager for the Broadmoor Ice Palace and a former semi-professional goaltender was hired as the team's first coach and the Pioneers hit the ice for their first game in December, losing to the University of Saskatchewan, 17–0. Denver would, unsurprisingly, lose its first 9 games before recording the first victory against Wyoming on January 27. The following season saw much improvement with the team as it finished with an 11–11–1 record and when Turner stepped down after the year it gave Neil Celley the opportunity to build the program. When Celley assumed the reins he was the youngest head coach in the history of college ice hockey at 24 and had won a national title with Michigan the year before, as a player. The team responded to Celley by raising their record to 18–6–1 and finishing tied for second in the inaugural MCHL standings. Unfortunately, Celley's old team was selected ahead of Denver for the NCAA tournament due to a better overall record. The Pioneers would continue to play well under Celley but their winning percentage dropped every year until 1956 when they finished just a hair above .500. Celley resigned after that season and turned the team over to ex-NHLer Murray Armstrong.\nArmstrong era.\nArmstrong came to DU and guaranteed an NCAA title within three years, and did it in his second year. The team, using Armstrong's coaching pipeline to ex-Junior players in Canada, took a year to get going, but by 1958 the DU team started firing on all cylinders. Denver won its first conference title (tying with North Dakota) and received the second western seed for its first NCAA tournament bid. Denver did not let the bright lights stun them as they rolled through the competition, winning both games 6–2 and taking their first NCAA National Title in Minneapolis. The next season, an argument between conference members over the recruitment of Canadian players who had played junior hockey, caused the WIHL to collapse and left Denver without a conference. Denver struggled to fill out its schedule and though DU finished with the best record of any western team (22–5–1) their competition was so paltry that the Pioneers were passed over in favor of North Dakota (who had taken three of four matches between them) for the NCAA tournament with Big Ten champion Michigan State receiving the other bid. After that disaster, all teams that had been in the WIHL restarted the conference under a new name (WCHA) and instituted a playoff among other reforms. Because the matter of recruitment was left unchanged, Denver was able to take full advantage and build their program into the dominant power for the duration of the decade.\nEarly 60s.\nDenver kicked off its first season in the WCHA by winning the regular season title and being WCHA tournament co-champions along with Michigan Tech. The WCHA had arranged its tournament to take advantage of the NCAA bid policy that would give automatic bids to tournament champions and because there was no rival western conference the WCHA could guarantee that both of its co-champions would make the frozen four. Denver won both of its NCAA games and captured the 1960 National Title. The Tournament MOP was split for the first time that year and while it was given to three separate players, none of them wore Denver sweaters. The Pioneers followed up their second championship by thoroughly dominating the competition in 1961. In what is typically ranked among the best seasons ever, the squad began with five victories before dropping a match to Michigan Tech on the road and then never lost another game. The '61 Pioneers scored 242 times in only 32 contests for a rate of just over 7.5 goals per game. Additionally, they allowed just 59 goals against in that time (1.84). While neither marks were records, the average scoring differential of +5.72 is still an NCAA record. Denver had the second-and third-leading scoring in the nation who were only topped by Phil Latreille scoring an all-time NCAA record of 80 goals in 21 games. Not only did the Pioneers post the first 30-win season in NCAA history but, by playing in every game, George Kirkwood set an NCAA record for wins in a season (30). Denver made sure they also did their damage when it counted the most; in the four playoff games they played (2 conference, 2 NCAA) the Pioneers won each by at least 5 goals and won all four matches by a total of 35–6. In the NCAA championship game against St. Lawrence, Denver surrendered the first goal but ended the night by scoring the final nine (an NCAA record) and won the game by 10 goals, 12-2 (also an NCAA record) and were one short of tying the NCAA record of 13 in the championship game. Denver tied the record by placing 5 players on the All-Tournament Team and set the record with 5 players on the All-WCHA First Team as well as the AHCA All-American Team and swept all 5 individual awards offered that year. Three of the players from that team eventually played in the NHL, a rare occurrence for NCAA teams at the time.\nAfter such unparalleled dominance, it was expected that Denver would decline the following year, especially with so many of the players graduating, but the team still finished 3rd in the WCHA. One year later they won both WCHA conference titles and again made the NCAA tournament. After dropping Clarkson in a relatively easy 6–2 semifinal match Denver faced off against North Dakota for a rematch of it first title in 1958. The Fighting Sioux scored three times before 8 minutes had elapsed and, while Denver responded with two quick goals, North Dakota tacked on two more in the first to finish with a 5–2 lead. When they added another 5 minutes into the second it looked as if they were going to walk to a national title but the Pioneers did npt quit and scored twice to cut the lead in half entering the third. North Dakota closed ranks and set up a wall in front of Rudy Unis in the final frame but still could not stop Denver from scoring, however, the Pioneers could only notch one goal and lost their first NCAA tournament game, 5–6. The team's streak of seven consecutive tournament wins from the start is still an NCAA record.\nDenver followed up that disappointment with a second-place finish despite playing only 10 games and a WCHA tournament championship over Michigan. In the NCAA tournament DU produced a very similar result to the year before by dropping their semifinal opponent easily, then allowing the team they defeated in the WCHA championship to score the first three goals. This time it was the Wolverines who would take the title and send the Pioneers home disappointed. The next season Denver finished with a record of 18–8–2, one of the best in the nation, but because they only played 12 conference games and won only 4 matches they finished 6th in the WCHA and were left out of the conference playoffs. The following season Denver increased their conference schedule to 20 games but because the WCHA added Minnesota–Duluth as a member, the conference tournament now included all 8 teams. Denver was given a regional matchup against the dismal Colorado College Tigers and took the game easily to give them a shot against arch-nemesis North Dakota for an entry to the NCAA tournament. Despite being the lower seed the game was played in Denver's home stadium due in part to a terrible blizzard that dropped more than two feet around Grand Forks. The home game may have given Denver just enough of an advantage and the Pioneers edged UND, 5–4 in overtime to return to the NCAA tournament. Once there Denver faced Clarkson for the third time in the semifinal but the Golden Knights were able to avenge their earlier losses and send DU to its first consolation game. Though they won the match the Pioneers and their fans were far from satisfied with the result. The following season Denver rose to 2nd in the conference but because the WCHA tournament was still arranged for regional matchups the Pioneers had to play top seed North Dakota in the second round and the Fighting Sioux were able to redeem themselves with a win.\nLate 60s.\nWhile many programs may have been happy with the results Denver achieved in '66 and '67 the Pioneers were decidedly nonplussed. When the team began 1968 season slowly, losing three out of their first five games, they were taken to task and responded by winning every remaining game except for a stretch in late December when they played four Olympic squads. Denver finished the season atop the WCHA and with the regional restrictions abolished they were able to take full advantage of their top seed and demolish their competition 27–7 in the three games. In the NCAA tournament Denver faced Boston College for the first time and swatted the Eagles away with a 4–1 victory despite sloppy play. The final brought North Dakota and DU together for a rubber match and the two teams fought a tough defensive battle through two periods before the floodgates opened and Denver scored four times in the final frame while Gerry Powers earned the first shutout in a championship game. The next season was much the same; after a slow start the Pioneers ran through most of their competition, finishing second in the WCHA and taking down much weaker opponents in the conference tournament to return to the NCAA playoff. For this 1969 championship they beat Harvard 9–2 in the opening match before facing Ken Dryden-led Cornell. The Pioneers did not have any problems scoring against the seemingly impregnable Big Red defense, building leads three times while the final one stuck and Denver won its fifth NCAA national title, 4–3.\nDynasty's end.\nDespite losing many players from the dual national title teams due to graduations Denver did not lose much footing and finished second in the WCHA but lost to new entry Wisconsin in the conference tournament. The next season, Denver finished second for the third straight year and were able to win another league co-championship and receive the top western seed. The Pioneers had to settle for a third place NCAA finish after losing only their second semifinal game in nine opportunities. The next season, Denver won both conference titles for the fifth time in their history but were stunned by a 2–7 loss to Cornell in the semifinal, the team's worst loss to a college team in over six years. As if their recent tournament collapses needed a concrete symbol, the DU Arena roof failed in 1972 and forced the team to play most of their remaining home games at the Denver Coliseum. While the Pioneers were able to overcome that difficulty and win the WCHA yet again and finish as the NCAA runner-up it was a battle off the ice that would eventually cost them dearly.\nThroughout the 1960s, the matter of recruiting Canadian major junior players was becoming an issue again, and by the 1970s, Minnesota coach John Mariucci was pushing the NCAA for change. Mariucci did not like his teenage American players, who grew up playing locally in Minnesota, playing against older Canadian players that Denver recruited, due to Denver's lack of local players to recruit. Minnesota even refused to schedule the Pioneers for years in the 1960s, which spurred the NCAA to support Minnesota's position. In 1974, the NCAA asked all schools that rostered major junior Canadian players to declare these students ineligible and in recompense, the current players would have their NCAA eligibility restored as a grandfathering ploy, with all future major junior players remaining ineligible. While most universities acceded to the NCAA demand, Denver did not. The school refused to call its own players 'cheaters', and ended up paying the price. The university had its trip to the 1973 tournament vacated and with its pipeline from Canada cut, the team began to falter in the standings. 1974–75 saw Denver post its first losing season since Armstrong's first year and while the team was slowly recovering, DU would not make another tournament appearance until long after his retirement in 1977.\nDecline.\nArmstrong's assistant Marshall Johnston took over and the team jumped up in the standings as the nation's top-ranked team, winning the WCHA regular season crown and breaking the school record for wins with 33 (albeit in 40 games) but DU was stopped in the WCHA second round by an upstart Colorado College team, after finding out that Denver's appeal to be eligible for the 1978 NCAA tournament was denied by the NCAA. After declining to 6th place the following season. Denver ended 1979–80 dead last in the WCHA and missed the playoffs entirely. The team rebounded the next season but afterwards, Johnston returned to the NHL and the program was given to a third-straight former pro, Ralph Backstrom. Backstrom's entry coincided with four WCHA members bolting for the CCHA leaving the conference with only 6 schools. The co-championship format was abolished and though Denver provided some glimpse of hope in Backstrom's first season, the team slipped towards the bottom of the division for three seasons. By the end of the 1984–85 season Denver had lost eight consecutive playoff games and was in danger of becoming an afterthought in the WCHA. The 1985–86 team provided a surprising start the following campaign, winning seven of their first eight-game en route to the WCHA regular season and playoff championships over Michigan Tech, Minnesota-Duluth and Minnesota, followed by a home NCAA 7–6 total goal series win over Cornell to make it to the Frozen Four. Denver played a school record 48 games that year, and won 34 contests (also a DU record) despite losing in the NCAA semifinal, 5–2 to Harvard in Providence. The stark turnaround garnered Backstrom the Spencer Penrose Award. The highlights were short-lived, however and over the succeeding four years Denver returned to being a middling team in the WCHA.\nBackstrom left in 1990 and was replaced by Frank Serratore. While he would later achieve a great deal of success with Air Force Serratore's time in Denver was the darkest period in the history of the program. In his first season, the Pioneers won only 6 games, losing a school record 30 of 38 matches. The following season brought only marginal improvements but when the team rose above .500 in 1992–93 it looked like Serratore's job may be saved, but after slipping back to 9th in the conference the year after he was out as coach and replaced by Wisconsin alumnus George Gwozdecky.\nGwozdecky era.\nWhen Denver hired Gwozdecky, they hoped they were getting the same coach that had won back-to-back CCHA Coach of the Year awards at Miami (Ohio). In his first season in 1995, he delivered by getting the Pioneers to win 10 more games than they had the year before, and jump from 9th in the conference, to a tie for second place and an NCAA win over New Hampshire. After a disappointing opening round loss in the WCHA playoffs the following year, Denver returned to the NCAA tournament in 1997 and beat a very strong Vermont squad in the first round. In 1999 the Pioneers were able to defeat a dominant North Dakota to take their first conference championship in thirteen years, but lost their first NCAA tournament game to Michigan in the first meeting between the two since the Wolverines left the WCHA. Denver stumbled over the next two years before winning their first WCHA regular season title under Gwozdecky, as well as a second conference championship. Unfortunately, the Pioneers found themselves pitted against Michigan in the first game, and lost to the Maize and Blue yet again. The Pioneers lost in the first round of the WCHA tournament each of the next two years, but their record in 2004 was good enough to snag the #2 seed despite the loss.\nBack-to-back titles.\nDU was able to defeat Gwozdecky's previous team, Miami, in a close game before advancing to face North Dakota in the West Regional Final. The top team in the nation held Denver off the scoresheet and out shot the Pioneers 23–13 in the opening two periods but the Fighting Sioux could not get the puck past Adam Berkhoel. The two teams remained scoreless until just 2:29 remained in regulation when Luke Fulghum deflected a puck into the net and sent the Pioneers into the Frozen Four for the first time in 18 years. Denver met Minnesota–Duluth in the semifinal and looked like were outmatched when the Bulldogs scored twice in the first five minutes of the game. Even when Denver cut the lead in half a second power play goal by 2004 Hobey Baker winner Junior Lessard followed soon thereafter. The Pioneers, however, were not deterred and came out firing in the third, tying the score in less than four minutes and adding another two goals before the period was half over. Duluth was so stunned by the comeback that they could only muster 6 shots in the period as Denver took the game to make their first national championship since their vacated appearance in 1973. With Maine as the only obstacle left in their path, Denver put up in front of Adam Berkhoel and allowed only 24 shots to reach their goalie, including none during a 6-on-3 power play advantage in the last minute and a half of the game. Berkhoel earned the shutout, making the lone goal from Gabe Gauthier in the first as the winner.\nAfter winning their first title in 35 years Denver raised their game, tying Colorado College for the WCHA crown and producing the #2 offense in the country. In the WCHA tournament, however, it was their defense that led the way. With rookie goaltender Peter Mannino standing on his head for two shutouts, the Pioneers allowed only two goals in four games, winning three one-goal games to take the conference championship. DU earned the #2 overall seed and had to survive a scare from Bemidji State in their first game. After allowing 3 to the much weaker Beavers, Glenn Fisher was benched in favor of Mannino for the remaining three games and the Pioneers cruised to the championship game with 4–2 and 6–2 wins. In the Final Denver met North Dakota for the fourth time, matching the record for championship meetings with Michigan and Colorado College. The two teams exchanged goals in the first but future NHLer Paul Stastny put the Pioneers into the lead with a power play marker just after the midpoint. With their season on the line North Dakota began an onslaught on the DU net, firing 23 shots in the third but Mannino was equal to the take and kept everything out. The Pioneers scored twice in the third to put the game away and take their seventh national championship.\nPlayoff disappointments.\nThe next season brought Denver its first Hobey Baker winner in Matt Carle but the team floundered in the first round of the WCHA tournament and this time their record was not good enough to get them into the championship. After another first round exit the following year Denver righted the ship and won the WCHA tournament in 2008. In the first round they found themselves facing conference rival Wisconsin, only the second time in NCAA history that two teams from the same conference met in the opening round. Despite being favored in the game the Pioneers were beaten 2–6 and sent home disappointed. The Pioneers would return to the tournament each of the next five seasons, but the results were much the same, losing in the first round four times and thoroughly dismissed by North Dakota in the 2011 regionals. Despite the regular season success the early playoff exits, coupled with a contract structure dispute, these results led Denver to fire their head coach in 2013, only 17 wins away from tying Murray Armstrong's program record.\nNew coach, new conference.\nGwozdecky's firing coincided with the founding of the NCHC, a power conference that was created due to Wisconsin and Minnesota leaving to restart the Big Ten hockey division. Denver was accompanied by all of its traditional rivals and began its tenure under Jim Montgomery but finishing 6th in the 8-team conference. Despite their lackluster start the Pioneers were provided with an opportunity by facing weaker-than-expected opposition in the final two games and were able to win the inaugural championship, as they had done with the WCHA 54 years earlier. The Pioneer's NCAA run was predictably short-lived but the team seemed to have found new life under Montgomery's watch which they demonstrated by increasing their win total in each of the next three years. In addition they won progressively more tournament games, reaching the Frozen Four in 2016 before winning the National Championship in 2017 along with getting their second Hobey Baker Award, this one going to Will Butcher. After the team won its second NCHC tournament title in 2018, Montgomery left to join the Dallas Stars as head coach. DU replaced Montgomery with his Denver assistant, 28-year-old David Carle. Carle took Denver to the 2019 Frozen Four in his rookie season, after first and second-round NCAA wins over Ohio State and American International, but the Pioneers fell in the Frozen Four semi-finals to Massachusetts, 4–3 in overtime in Buffalo, New York.\n9th National Championship.\nIn 2022, following wins against UMass Lowell and Minnesota Duluth, David Carle and the Denver Pioneers entered the Frozen Four for the 18th time in school history. In the semi-finals, Denver played the University of Michigan. Carter Savoie scored in overtime to secure a 3-2 victory, and advance the Pioneers to the National Championship game for their 12th time in program history. In the National Championship game, Denver failed to score until the third period against Minnesota State. However, Denver finally broke through adding 5 goals to clinch their 9th National Championship in program history.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nDenver/Colorado College rivalry.\nOf all the rivals that the Denver Pioneer's hockey program play against the most intense rivalry is that from Colorado College. Since Denver's hockey program started in 1949 the two schools have played at least four times a season. In the 1993–94 season a gold pan trophy was added as a reward for the winning team thus the rivalry has been dubbed the Battle for the Gold Pan.\nHead coaches.\nDavid Carle is the current head coach of Denver hockey, hired in May 2018.\nAwards and honors.\nHockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nHobey Baker Award\nSpencer Penrose Award\nTim Taylor Award\nMike Richter Award\nNCAA Division I Ice Hockey Scoring Champion\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nMCHL/WIHL/WCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nMost Valuable Player/Player of the Year\nDefensive Player of the Year\nGoaltender of the Year\nStudent-Athlete of the Year\nSophomore/Freshman/Rookie of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nMost Valuable Player in Tournament\nAll-Conference.\nFirst Team All-MCHL/WIHL/WCHA\nSecond Team All-MCHL/WIHL/WCHA\nThird Team All-WCHA\nWCHA All-Rookie Team\nNCHC.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nGoaltender of the Year\nForward of the Year\nDefenseman/Defensive Defenseman of the Year\nOffensive Defenseman of the Year\nScholar-Athlete of the Year\nTournament MVP\nAll-Conference.\nFirst Team All-NCHC\nSecond Team All-NCHC\nNCHC All-Rookie Team\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Denver hockey alumni who were a part of an Olympic team.\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nDenver Athletic Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the Denver men's ice hockey program who were elected into the Denver Athletic Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nPioneers in the NHL.\nActive players stats.\nNotes:\nWHA.\nSeveral players also were members of WHA teams.\nArenas.\nUniversity of Denver Arena (1948–1997).\nUniversity of Denver Arena (DU Arena) was a 5,237-seat multi-purpose arena on campus in Denver. In addition to serving as the Pioneers' home rink, it hosted several Frozen Fours. It was razed in 1997 to make room for the $75 million Magness Arena, (part of the Ritchie Center for Sports and Wellness) which opened in 1999.\nOriginally a U.S. Navy drill hall in northern Idaho, the structure was built in the early 1940s at Farragut Naval Training Station at Lake Pend Oreille. It was donated after World War II and reassembled on the DU campus in 1948–49 to house the new ice hockey program and served for nearly half a century.\nThe arena was refurbished in 1972–73 when the roof needed repairs, and 14 seven-ton steel trusses were added to shore up the roof. Additional patchwork renovations were added in the 1990s, prior to razing in 1997.\nThe best-known features of the arena were the steep bleacher balcony at the south end, and the 1970s rainbow painted on the north end wall. Famous hockey games held there include the NCAA ice hockey finals in 1961, 1964, and 1976.\nMagness Arena (1999–present).\nAlso on campus, Magness Arena is a 7,200-seat multi-purpose collegiate sports arena, built from 1997 to 1999. It is part of the Daniel L. Ritchie Center for Sports &amp; Wellness, DU's $84 million, sports complex, and is home to the Pioneers' ice hockey and basketball teams. The aging DU Arena and DU Fieldhouse were razed in 1997 to make way for the Ritchie Center, which includes Hamilton Gymnasium, utilized for less-attended basketball games.\nThe arena is named after cable television pioneer Bob Magness, who donated $10 million towards construction costs.\nOther arenas.\nWhen the DU Arena roof was being fixed between 1972 and 1973, the Pioneers played home games at the Denver Coliseum.\nWhen Magness Arena was under construction from 1997 to 1999, Denver played its home games at four different arenas along the Front Range: Denver Coliseum, McNichols Arena, Colorado Springs World Arena, and at the Air Force Academy's Cadet Ice Arena.\nDU has also played a 2012 home exhibition game at Denver's Pepsi Center against the University of British Columbia, and played a league game in 2023, a 2–0 win over rival Colorado College before over 17,000 fans (an indoor DU home record) in the same building, now known as Ball Arena.\nDenver's all-time record hockey crowd was the 2016 regular season outdoor NCHC game against Colorado College, called \"The Battle on Blake\" before over 35,000 fans at Denver's Coors Field baseball stadium, the most fans to ever see a home DU sporting event in Denver.\nDU's previous indoor record home crowd was the 1995 Denver Cup final at McNichols Arena, where Denver defeated Colorado College before over 16,000 fans."

Most of the clubs in the northern region of Belgium are governed by the Vlaamse Rugby Bond (VRB). The remaining clubs are governed by the Ligue Belge Francophone de Rugby (LBFR).\nRugby union in Belgium is also structured into four districts for competition purposes. These districts are; Brabant, Hainaut, Liège/Namur/Luxembourg, and Flanders.\nWithin these districts, there are also several leagues and divisions that are structured based on the skill level of the clubs.\nHistory.\nFor a long time, Belgian rugby's most high-profile personality was the former international referee, Teddy Lacroix, who became president of the union.\nRugby union in Belgium has not been popular historically, but due to its recent international successes, it is a quickly growing sport. As of the December 2007, more than half of the nearly seven thousand registered players are pre-teens or teenagers. In addition, there are currently forty-eight domestic clubs that compete against each other on various levels.\nNotable players.\nNotable Belgian rugby players include:\nNational team.\nThe national team, nicknamed the Black Devils (), has been competing in international tests since 1932.\n2006-08 European Nations Cup.\nThe national team competed in competition in the Second Division at the 2010-2012 European Nations Cup winning the division and securing promotion to Division 1A for the next season.\n¹ \"Results from Belgian view\""

        "text": "Bryan Douglas Anderson (born December 16, 1986) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago White Sox, and Oakland Athletics, and in international competition for the United States national baseball team.\nCareer.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nAnderson was born in Thousand Oaks, California, on December 16, 1986. He attended Simi Valley High School in Simi Valley, California. The Cardinals selected him in the fourth round (140th overall) of the June 2005 First-Year Player Draft.\nFollowing the draft, Anderson was assigned to big league camp and was one of the youngest non-roster invitees in the organization history. He was then assigned to the Johnson City Cardinals, the Cardinals's rookie league team in the Appalachian League. He played 51 games in 2005 for Johnson City and hit .331. In 2006, he began with the Single-A Quad Cities River Bandits in the Midwest League. He played the full year and batted .302. In 2007, he was advanced to the Springfield Cardinals, the Double-A affiliate in Missouri of the Texas League. He did very well and hit .298. He began 2008 in Springfield, hitting .388 with two homers and 14 RBIs in April. He was then promoted to the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds of Pacific Coast League (PCL). He spent 2009 in Memphis as well, and many argue he should have been given a spot on the big league roster.\nIn 2010, Anderson was a non-roster invitee to Cardinals spring training. On March 15 he was optioned to Memphis.\nIn April 2010, Anderson was recalled from Memphis when back up catcher Jason LaRue was placed on the 15-day disabled list. He made his Major League debut on April 15, 2010. He saw limited action, appearing in 4 games, and was reassigned to Memphis on April 27 when LaRue was reactivated.\nAnderson battled Tony Cruz during spring training for the backup catcher for the Major League Cardinals. He ended up starting the season at Triple-A Memphis, under trade speculation as he was a hot commodity and on many trade table talks, but remained in Memphis and was eventually called up to the big league club during the summer. Anderson went 3-for-12 in limited at-bats for St. Louis, while batting .255 in one hundred plate appearances for Memphis. In November, 2012 St. Louis cleared space on the 40-man off season roster by outrighting Anderson and two others back to Memphis. He subsequently elected to become a free agent, which allowed him to search for teams that could possible offer an immediate big league job.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn November 21, 2012, relatively early in the off season, Anderson signed a minor league deal with the Chicago White Sox. He was called up to the big leagues to serve as a split time catcher and at the end of the season was outrighted off the roster on October 4, 2013. He subsequently elected to become a free agent.\nCincinnati Reds.\nAnderson signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds in January 2014. He hit .320 with 10 homers during the season until he was traded to the Oakland A's after the trade deadline on August 24, 2014, for international money.\nOakland Athletics.\nThe Reds traded Anderson to the Oakland Athletics on August 24, 2014. After the trade he was assigned to Oakland and remained with the big league team for the rest of the season. He played the majority of the 2015 season with the Triple-A Nashville Sounds, but was called up to Oakland during the summer. He was outrighted back to Nashville after the season, and later elected free agency. He signed another minor league contract with the A's for 2016 and went to big league camp. He became a free agent on November 7, 2016.\nPersonal.\nBryan married his wife, Rachel, in 2014 and they have one daughter. Rachel is a former pediatric nurse from Cleveland, Ohio."

        "text": "The 2001 Major League Baseball draft, was held on June 5 and 6.\nBackground.\nOn June 1, 2001, Rolando Viera, a Cuban baseball pitcher who had recently left Cuba, attempted to enjoin Major League Baseball from including him in the 2001 draft so that he could instead sign as a free agent. Viera, represented by attorney Alan Gura and agent Joe Kehoskie, claimed that the MLB draft was discriminatory because it had different signing rules for Cubans than for other foreign players. On June 4, federal judge James D. Whittemore ruled that whatever financial loss Viera suffered from being subject to the draft did not satisfy the federal injunction requirement of irreparable harm. Viera was picked by the Boston Red Sox that same week in the seventh round of the draft.\nThe Minnesota Twins selected St. Paul, MN native Joe Mauer with the number one pick in the 2001 draft. The 18-year-old Mauer, a catcher from Cretin-Derham Hall High School in St. Paul, became the seventh Minnesotan to be selected in the first round and the first to be chosen number one overall. The back-stop was a member of the USA Junior National Team and won a gold medal at the world tournament in Taiwan in 1999. He was also a High School football standout as a quarterback and signed a letter of intent to play football at Florida State University before being drafted.\nRight-handed pitcher Mark Prior of the University of Southern California was selected by the Chicago Cubs with the second overall pick in the draft. Prior, who was previously selected in the supplemental first round of the 1998 draft by the Yankees, was the first college player chosen in the 2001 draft. Prior won numerous National Player of the Year awards after going 15–1 with a 1.69 ERA and 202 strikeouts to lead the Trojans to a College World Series berth in his junior year."

He was a representative player at both state and international levels and played in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition for Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, and the Balmain Tigers. Martin primarily played in the position.\nPlaying career.\nMartin was originally an Australian Rules footballer in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales but switched to rugby league with Wagga Wagga Kangaroos. He spent 1975–1976 playing for Barrow in English club football. He came to the notice of first-grade clubs in Australia when he represented Riverina in the 1976 Amco Cup competition.\nMartin débuted for Manly in 1978 and was selected for New South Wales as . In the same year he played in both the grand final, and the grand final replay win over Cronulla. Martin finished his début season as the NSWRL \"Rookie of the Year\". He was then selected to go on the 1978 Kangaroo tour, playing in eleven tour matches and one Test against France.\nMartin was selected to represent New South Wales as an interchange for the inaugural State of Origin game in 1980.\nAfter several positional changes at Manly, Martin moved to Balmain in an effort to consolidate his career at halfback but a series of shoulder injuries kept him from his previous form. In 1983–1984, Martin played for Leeds in England.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1986–1987, Martin captain-coached West Tamworth to two premierships but two shoulder dislocations forced his retirement as a player. Moving to the North Sydney Bears in 1990, Martin coached the club to the 1991 preliminary-final but they lost to the Canberra Raiders.\n1992 was a disappointing season for the Bears and Martin resigned at the end of the year, being succeeded by Peter Louis. An appointment as coach of Featherstone Rovers in England followed before Martin returned once more to Australia and took up the coaching position at the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1998 replacing the outgoing Ken Shine. His tenure at the club was brief. Martin was sacked after a disagreement over the disciplining of controversial five-eighth, Julian O'Neill, late in the season and handed the position over to Craig Coleman."

        "title": "New Norcia Cricket Team",
        "text": "The New Norcia Cricket Team was a team of indigenous Australian cricketers captained by a pastoralist, who played in Western Australia between about 1879 and 1906. The team was established by the Abbot of the New Norcia missionary settlement, Rosendo Salvado who was a regular cricket watcher and believed that the formation of the team was \"one more humanising and Christianising element\" in his mission to Aboriginal people.\n\"The Invincibles\".\nIn his 2014 book, \"The Invincibles\" author Bob Reece sets out to show that the Aboriginal cricketers themselves initiated the team rather than local pastoralist Henry Lefroy being responsible for its introduction at New Norcia. And that rather than cricket being held up as a civilising force, the men were successful through hard practice, close ties and upbringing in a cohesive and supportive village community over two decades. \nHistory.\nThe monastic township of New Norcia was established as a small missionary settlement by the Spanish Benedictines for the spiritual and welfare needs of local aboriginal people in 1847. It is about north-east of Perth—team members walked to Perth for their matches against the metropolitan teams.\nNew Norcia was within the Victoria Plains region north of Perth, an area dominated by the pioneering Lefroy family. A son, H.B. Lefroy had taken over his father's Walebing property in 1873 and regularly coached and captained the New Norcia team which initially played matches against teams from nearby Northam and York. Lefroy had a close association with a number of influential Perth men including J.C.H. James, a magistrate and cricket enthusiast who would become the inaugural president of the Western Australian Cricket Association in 1885. This association no doubt assisted in bringing the \"New Norcians\" as they were commonly known, to Perth and Fremantle in 1879 to help stimulate the local cricket scene. Henry Lefroy became Premier of Western Australia in 1917.\nPre-WACA.\nSeveral years before the establishment of the Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA) in 1885, the team appeared on the struggling local cricket scene, dominating the Perth and Fremantle metropolitan clubs. Teams from Perth and Fremantle had been playing regularly since their first match on the Old Recreation Ground in Wellington Square in November 1852. It was not until the mid-1880s that the cricket establishment managed to excise part of the so-called New Recreation Ground (today's Esplanade) for a dedicated cricket facility. A few years later, in 1889, the association finally secured a 999-year lease on the then swampy 14½ acre patch of land to house the WACA Ground.\nMedia attitudes.\nThe local press generally reported on the team patronisingly, particularly in the early 1879 tour matches, but with acknowledgement and a degree of admiration for their skills. In what was clearly a surprise result, in their first match with Fremantle it was reported that \"the poor despised blacks gained a victory by eight runs\". In later matches the \"noble savages\" were described as having \"remarkable agility and smartness\". In the next match in Perth the home side needed eight runs to win in the second innings, but \"owing to excellent fielding, six wickets fell for seven runs\". In the second innings of match against Fremantle in 1881, Fremantle began needing just 49 runs to win. Soon however, the Aboriginal team had removed Fremantle for 17 runs – \"the fielding was nearly perfect throughout. As catch after catch was taken, a perfect panic seemed to set in.\"\nA few weeks after the Perth and Fremantle matches, a team from the Metropolitan Cricket Club (which had merged with the Perth Cricket Club in March 1878 and ultimately became the nucleus of the WACA) travelled to New Norcia where they stayed at the Mission building overnight. The following day's match saw the visitors win by a narrow margin.\nThe players.\nThe \"New Norcians\" often entertained the crowds before and after matches with athletic demonstrations such as throwing and running. One player, Johnny Walley had outstanding throwing skills and demonstrated his talent at a Perth match by throwing a ball at a bell-topper hat, placed on the ground away and successfully demolishing the hat on the first throw. At Fremantle he hit a folded umbrella fixed into the ground at a distance of .\nThe star player however was all-rounder Johnny Blurton. Not usually the regular wicket-keeper, on one occasion he took the gloves and within a few minutes had effected a spectacular stumping. In 1881 \"The West Australian\" newspaper described him as \"the best all round cricketer\" in that team, \"and perhaps in the colony\". \"Not only was his defence first rate but he drove the ball well, and always full and fairly with the face of the bat, his wrist play being so strong that he can hit a ball farther than men twice his weight and strength\".\nOther noted players were Johnny Maher, an opening bowler and prolific wicket taker and Jackimarra, a left-handed bowler. As well as Blurton, noted batsmen within the team included Walley, Jackimarra and Yappo. In a February 1886 match against the fancied \"Metropolitans\", the \"New Norcians\" dismissed their opponents for 13 runs in their first innings. Maher took 6 wickets for 2 runs.\nThe team went into hiatus for several years, and was resurrected briefly in the early 1900s."

        "text": "Yale University women's ice hockey (YWIH) is an NCAA Division I varsity ice hockey program at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\nOne of the oldest varsity women's ice hockey programs in the country, Yale women's ice hockey dates back to 1975. Beginning as a club sport, the program gained varsity team status in 1977–78.\nYale competes in the ECAC Hockey League (ECACHL), along with Ivy League foes Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, Dartmouth and Brown. Both the Yale men's and women's ice-hockey teams play at Ingalls Rink, also known as \"The Whale\".\nCoaches.\nThe current head coach is Mark Bolding, who took over the helm in April 2019. He is the 11th head coach for Yale. In his first season with the team, the Bulldogs set a program record with 17 wins, including 13 conference wins, also a school record, beating the previous record set in 2004-2005. The season included a six-game winning streak, the longest in program history. Bolding came to the Bulldogs after serving as the head coach for the Norwich University women's ice hockey team.\nJoakim Flygh coached the Bulldogs from 2010 until 2019. In 2014-2015, the team tied the school's record for conference wins with 12, and finished with the second highest number of goals scored (93). Prior to taking on head coaching responsibilities at Yale, Flygh was an assistant coach at Harvard and University of Minnesota-Duluth. Flygh resigned as head coach in February 2019. \nHilary Witt was the head coach from 2002 to 2010. Witt was named ECAC Women's Coach of the Year in 2002–03, and became Yale's all-time leader in wins in 2005. The 2004–05 squad set the school record for overall wins (16) and conference wins (12), earning a trip to the ECAC semifinals for the first time. The 2007–08 team broke the school record for goals in a season with 96 and finished with the second-most wins in school history, 15.\nHistory.\nYale University created its women's ice hockey program in the fall of 1974, under coach John Ormiston, a former Yale varsity captain working in the development office, who volunteered to coach an enthusiastic group of mostly novice players. During its first year, the program had few games, mostly against high school teams. Its first recorded match was on December 9, 1975 versus Choate-Rosemary Hall. The Bulldogs prevailed by a 5–3 tally. Two years later, the Bulldogs hockey program would attain varsity status.\nLaurie Belliveau played for Yale from 1994 to 1998. In four years, she participated in 98 games. Statistically, she logged 5,809 minutes, recorded 4,262 saves, and registered a .911 save percentage while posting a 4.32 goals against average. She has averaged more than 43 saves per game. In 1994–95, Belliveau became the first freshman in any sport to earn Ivy League Player of the Year honors. During the season, she made an ECAC record 78 saves in a game. The opponent was the Providence Friars women's ice hockey program.\nIn 1998, Laurie Belliveau was one of two Ivy League players named first team All-Americans. This was the first time that Ivy League women's hockey players were bestowed such an honor. \nHillary Witt was hired as head coach for the 2002-2003 season, after working as the assistant coach for one season. The Bulldogs had a stand-out year in 2004-2005, with a program high 16 wins overall and 12 conference wins. The following year, they set the all-time record for goals scored. Witt left at the end of the 2009-2010 season.\nOn April 3, 2011, Yale player Mandi Schwartz succumbed to recurrent acute myeloid leukemia at age 23. She was a forward on Yale's women's hockey team and had a string of 73 consecutive games played. In her honor, the Yale Bulldogs introduced the Mandi Schwartz Award in April 2011. The annual award is given in acknowledgement of a Yale Bulldog player's courage, grit and determination. Aleca Hughes was named as the first winner. On what would have been her 24th birthday, the ECAC renamed its Student-Athlete of the Year Award in honor of Schwartz.\nYWIH participates in Bulldog PAWS, a program at Yale New Haven Hospital that teams children with brain tumors with one of the Yale Athletic Teams. In 2011, they adopted a nine-year-old girl, Giana, with a brain tumor; she went to all of their home games. Alyssa Zupon was instrumental in developing the partnership.\nThe Bulldogs broke the previous program record of wins and conference wins in the 2019-2020 season. They finished 17-15-0 over all, and 13-9-0 in conference play. They played perennial rival Harvard in the quarterfinals of the ECAC tournament. After an opening game loss, they won the second game in overtime. In the tie-breaker, they lost in triple overtime by a score of 3-2. \nIn July 2020, the Ivy League announced that league play would be suspended in Fall 2020 due to the 20202 coronavirus pandemic.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nAwards and honors.\nMandi Schwartz Scholar Athlete of the Year Award.\nAwarded by the ECAC Conference"

        "title": "The Australian Golf Club",
        "text": "The Australian Golf Club is a golf club located in Rosebery, a suburb of Sydney, Australia. Although it survived numerous course location changes, it is arguably the oldest golf club in Australia. To date the course has held 20 Australian Open events and most recently in 2017 the event was won by Australian Cameron Davis. The course has been rated the 9th best in the country.\nCourse.\nEarly history.\nThe Australian Golf Club was founded in 1882, which makes it the oldest golf club in Australia followed by Royal Melbourne Golf Club (founded 1891). However, The Australian did not have a golf course between the years of 1888 and 1895, which has led to debate as to which golf club is the oldest.\nThe club's first golf course was situated in Moore Park, a suburb of Sydney, but due to a new road the course had to be abandoned six years later in 1888. In 1895 a second, eleven-hole course was built in Waverley, which was used until 1898, when the club's lease expired. The course then moved to Botany, Sydney. It was this course that hosted the 1901 Australian Amateur Championship, and the first Australian Open in 1904.\nPresent day course.\nThe present day location of the course was inspected in 1903, while a year later plans were put forward for the new course by Carnegie Clark, Jock Hutchison and Gilbert Martin. In 1926 Alister MacKenzie, designer of courses such as Royal Melbourne Golf Club and Augusta National Golf Club, was asked to update holes on the course. Due to the popularity of the course, members approved a new layout in 1949 which supplied the club with two starting holes. In 1967 the proposal of a new road threatened the land on which the course was laid out on. As a result, a redesign by Sloane Morpeth was needed, which was completed in 1973. Between 1977 and 1980 Jack Nicklaus made significant alterations to the course, which included adding length and water hazards, which transformed the course into what it is today.\nPresent works are under way to improve the course, including the re-routing of a number of holes. The changes will create a more contemporary feel. The club has again commissioned Jack Nicklaus to design the changes, and the course is set to re-open in autumn of 2013.\nCourse scorecard.\nSource\nTournaments.\nThe Australian Golf Club has held 20 Australian Opens, with the most recent being from the 23–26 November 2017, which was won by Cameron Davis with a score of 11 under par. The various winners of Australian Opens at The Australian are as follows:\nThe Australian has also hosted 13 Australian Amateur Championships – the first in 1901, and the most recent in 2015."

        "title": "Cricket cap",
        "text": "A cricket cap is a type of soft cap, often made from felt, that is a traditional form of headwear for players of the game of cricket, regardless of age or sex. It is usually a tight-fitting skullcap, usually made of six or eight sections, with a small crescent shaped brim that points downwards over the brow to provide shade for the eyes. It is often, but not always, elasticised at the rear to hold it in place upon the wearer's head. Sometimes, rather than tight-fitting, the cricket cap comes in a baggy variety, that is always kept in place by elastic.\nDescription.\nThe style of cap is also often used as official headwear as part of school uniforms for boys from private schools, particularly in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth of Nations. Although not common in the modern period, the cricket cap used to be a fashionable form of headwear for people who were casually dressed, and not necessarily worn just for playing the game.\nCricket caps are usually, but not always multi-coloured in the colours of the cricket club or school for which the cap is designed to represent. Sometimes they are particularly elaborately patterned with different sections in different colours, or different coloured rings or hoops around them. At international level, the cap is traditionally made from a single colour. However, in recent years in particular, many cricket teams, particularly for limited overs cricket have opted to wear baseball caps, rather than traditional cricket caps, but the style is still quite popular for first-class cricket teams, as well as Test cricket sides.\nThe origins of the cricket cap are hard to discern, however prints showing the game being played in the eighteenth century, already depict players wearing a variety similar versions of the traditional cricket cap.\nPerhaps the most famous version of the cricket cap in the modern setting is the baggy green cricket cap of the Australian cricket team, for which the players and fans of Australia hold a degree of reverence. The cap is treated with a degree of mysticism, and players who have long careers often refuse to replace the original one they receive as they often feel the cap is a lucky talisman. This sometimes results in players who have long careers wearing their cricket caps in quite a tattered state. The Australian side has long worn their baggy cricket cap, rather than alternatives such as a sun hat, for the first session of each match as a symbol of team solidarity.\nOther usage.\nPlayers who represent international cricket sides are often presented with a cap ceremonially before their debut. This is called \"receiving their first cap\". The cap is numbered according to how many players have represented that side before them. For example, Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar was the 187th player to represent India at Test level, and was awarded cap number 187. It is also sometimes used to refer to the number of times a player has played. Tendulkar played 200 Tests for India, so therefore he is said to have received 200 caps. While an actual cap may not necessarily be presented on every occasion, ceremonial cap presentations are often made for milestone appearances such as a player's 50th or 100th Test, in addition to debuts.\nSome countries also award a domestic type generally known as a \"county cap\". The latter system is most commonly applied in English county cricket. Most counties do not automatically award caps to players on their first appearance; instead, they have to be \"earned\" through good performances. Indeed, one can play at the highest domestic level for several years, and have a quite significant career in first-class cricket, without ever winning a cap.\nRecords.\nThe world record for the number of caps in Test cricket is held by Sachin Tendulkar of India, who has, over the course of a 24-year career, collected 200. Tendulkar also holds the record for One Day Internationals, with 463 caps."

Born in Jasper, Florida, he attended high school at the Paxon School for Advanced Studies in Jacksonville. Bryant threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nCareer.\nBryant's 14-year professional playing career, which included 892 games played in the minor leagues and 59 games at the MLB level, began in the Detroit Tigers' organization in 1960. He spent six seasons there until late 1965, when he was purchased by the Chicago Cubs. He began his MLB career with the Cubs in 1966, then later played for the 1969–70 Houston Astros. In the Majors, Bryant batted .220 with 24 hits, one home run and 13 runs batted in, and caught Don Wilson's second career no-hitter on May 1, 1969, against the Cincinnati Reds. Bryant's only big-league home run, a two-run blast, came two days later off Bobby Bolin of the San Francisco Giants, the winning blow in an eventual 4–3 Houston victory.\nBryant was acquired by the Boston Red Sox in December 1970 and became a playing coach for their Triple-A affiliate, the Pawtucket Red Sox, in 1973. The following year, Pawtucket manager Darrell Johnson was promoted to Boston as field boss, and brought Bryant with him as bullpen coach. Bryant coached under Johnson in Boston (1974–76) — serving on the 1975 American League championship team — and with the Seattle Mariners (1977–80) before leaving the game.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet\n "

He won three Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys of the NFL and one national championship at the University of Miami. He also was a member of the Washington Federals in the United States Football League (USFL). He played college football at Dickinson College.\nEarly years.\nHoffman attended York Suburban Senior High School, where he competed in football and baseball. He accepted a football scholarship from Dickinson College, where he played quarterback, running back, wide receiver, placekicker and punter. As a senior, he received All-Mid-Atlantic Conference honors at punter. He was also a member of the Raven's Claw Secret Society.\nIn 1983, he punted for the Washington Federals of the United States Football League in 3 games before being cut. He also went to training camp with the Washington Redskins in 1981 and 1983, the Seattle Seahawks in 1984 and the New Orleans Saints in 1985.\nCoaching career.\nMiami Hurricanes.\nIn 1985, he began his coaching career at the University of Miami as the kicking coach. He was a part of the 1987 National Championship team under head coach Jimmy Johnson. He tutored future NFL punter Jeff Feagles.\nHe also spent two springs in Italy as offensive coordinator of the Bellusco Seahawks in 1987 and the Rho Blacknights in 1988. In the fall of 1988, he coached at Miami Sunset Senior High School.\nDallas Cowboys.\nIn 1989, he followed head coach Jimmy Johnson and joined the Dallas Cowboys as the kicking coach. In 1990, he added quality control duties to his responsibilities, coordinating offensive and defensive scouting of future opponents, while providing internal analysis of the team's own tendencies.\nIn the 1990s, the Cowboys organization felt they could find placekickers and punters through free agency, without the need of paying a premium and adversely impacting the salary cap, so they allowed talented and productive players to leave, instead of signing them into long-term contracts. In 16 seasons, he was entrusted with helping to find and develop young talent. He scouted and coached seven rookie or first-year free agent kickers, that included Ken Willis, Lin Elliott, Chris Boniol, Richie Cunningham, Tim Seder, Jon Hilbert and Billy Cundiff. He also signed and coached 5 rookie or first-year free agent punters, that included John Jett, Micah Knorr, Filip Filipovic, Toby Gowin and Mat McBriar. His specialists established 15 separate club records.\nHe won three Super Bowl titles with the Cowboys. His contract was not renewed at the end of the 2004 season.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nHoffman took a year off from coaching in 2005, during which he acted as a consultant for several NFL teams and ran his own business. In 2006, Hoffman served as assistant special teams coach under special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis and head coach Jim Mora.\nMiami Dolphins.\nIn 2007, Hoffman was hired as assistant special teams coach for the Miami Dolphins. He worked under first-year head coach Cam Cameron and special teams coordinator Keith Armstrong. He contributed to kicker Jay Feely setting the single-season franchise record for field goal percentage at 91.3. He also instructed rookie punter Brandon Fields.\nIn 2008, he was one of only two coaches initially retained after Cameron's firing by Tony Sparano. He helped to develop rookie free agent kicker Dan Carpenter, who went on to make 21-of-25 field goals (84.0%), including a Dolphins rookie record 14 straight.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nIn 2009, Hoffman was hired by the Kansas City Chiefs to be the special teams coach for the first time in his career. In his first year, the special teams units improved significantly. He contributed to rookie Ryan Succop becoming an NFL starter and tying for the highest field goal percentage (86.2%) by an NFL rookie since 1970. Punter Dustin Colquitt set a new single-season team net punting average (40.8).\nOakland Raiders.\nOn February 3, 2012, Hoffman was hired as special teams coordinator of the Oakland Raiders by new head coach Dennis Allen. In his lone season with the team, placekicker Sebastian Janikowski achieved a 91.2% field goal percentage and was 25-for-25 inside of 50 yards for the first time in his career. He was relieved of his duties at the end of the season.\nTennessee Titans.\nOn February 18, 2013, Hoffman was hired as an assistant special teams coach for the Tennessee Titans. On October 3, 2016, he was promoted to special teams coordinator after Bobby April was relieved of his duties.

        "text": "Originally titled the \"Tournament East-West football game,\" the second of what is now known as the Rose Bowl Game was played on January 1, 1916. The Rose Bowl game has been played annually since this game.\nThe first game, the 1902 Tournament East-West football game, was so lopsided that for the next 13 years, the Tournament of Roses officials ran chariot races, ostrich races, and other various events instead of football. But, on New Year's Day 1916, football returned to stay as undefeated Washington State College defeated Brown University in this first annual Tournament of Roses football game.\nTournament Park.\nBefore the Rose Bowl stadium was built for the 1923 game, the Rose Bowl was played in Pasadena's Tournament Park, approximately from the current stadium. It is best known for being the site of the first edition in 1902, and the second to eighth (1916 to 1922) before the current stadium opened in the fall of 1922. Its capacity at the time was 43,000.\nTeams.\nWashington State had an undefeated season. They won 28–3 over Oregon, 29–0 over Oregon State, 41–0 over Idaho, 27–7 over Montana, 17–0 over Whitman and 48–0 over Gonzaga.\nBrown lost 7–0 to Amherst, 6–0 to Syracuse, and 16–7 to Harvard. They had a scoreless tie with Trinity. Brown outscored its opponents 167–32 that year, beating Rhode Island 38–0, Williams 33–0, Vermont 46–0, Yale 3-0 and Carlisle 39–3. Brown was chosen as the Eastern representative with a 5–3–1 record.\nThe Tournament of Roses committee were responsible for selecting and inviting the teams. Brown's victories over Yale and Carlisle were deciding factors for inviting Brown to participate.\nGame summary.\nFritz Pollard became the first African-American to play in the Rose Bowl Game. He was limited to 47 yards in 13 carries during the game. Wallace Wade played on the line. The game was played in a cold quagmire of mud from several days of rain.\nAftermath.\nCoach William Henry \"Lone Star\" Dietz and his Washington State squad served as extras in the football film \"Tom Brown of Harvard\" each morning and then practiced for the bowl game in the afternoon. They were paid $100 for the movie work.\nThe Tournament of Roses organization continues to have a college football game to this day as part of the New Year's Day celebrations.\nThe Western and Northern universities permitted minority players, a situation that would eventually lead to the Pacific Coast Conference - Big Nine conference agreement for the 1947 Rose Bowl. Most Southern universities were still segregated until the 1960s. None of the Southeastern Conference schools had an African American athlete until 1966. The Cotton Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Sugar Bowl would not be integrated until 1948, 1955, and 1956 respectively.\nCarl Dietz, the Washington State fullback, was named the Most Valuable Player of the game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively. Later, Pollard was the first Black player named to the Walter Camp All-America team and became the first Black NFL head coach.\nThe official 2007 NCAA Division I football records book lists the attendance at 7,000. Washington State listed at 10,000 in its media guide.\nThe quarterback of the Washington State University team, Thomas Arthur Durham, later had a successful Naval career."

        "title": "2008 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 2008 Giro d'Italia was the 91st running of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It began in Palermo on 10 May and ended in Milan on 1 June. Twenty-two teams entered the race, which was won by Spaniard Alberto Contador of the cycling team. Second and third respectively were Italians Riccardo Riccò and Marzio Bruseghin.\nContador first took the race lead after the second mountain stage, to Marmolada, by finishing nearly fifteen minutes ahead of previous race leader Gabriele Bosisio. The race's overall classification had been headed for several days beforehand by Giovanni Visconti, who participated in a breakaway in the sixth stage which won him sufficient time to hold the race leader's pink jersey for more than a week. In the race's final week, Contador faced stern challenges from Riccò and defending Giro champion Danilo Di Luca. Though Contador did not win any stage, his performances were consistently strong enough to remain ahead through to the conclusion of the race.\nTeam appeared to perform quite well in the race, coming away with four stage wins and victory in the mountains classification and the Trofeo Fast Team. In August 2008, mountains classification winner Emanuele Sella was announced to have tested positive for methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (better known as Mircera, an erythropoietin derivative) at an out-of-competition control held by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). He subsequently admitted his doping, and named teammate Matteo Priamo as his supplier. Both riders were subsequently suspended. Though as of April 2010 no definitive positive results have come to light from samples taken during the Giro, retesting of those samples has reportedly revealed six to seven presumptive positives for Mircera. Riccò, who tested positive for the drug at the 2008 Tour de France, is among those suspected of having given positive tests in the Giro, as is Sella.\nTeams.\nTwenty-two teams participated in the 2008 Giro. These included 16 UCI ProTour teams, and six UCI Professional Continental teams. Of the 18 ProTour teams, the two left out were and . Two other ProTour teams, and , were left off the first list of teams announced by RCS Sport, the organizers of the Giro. This list also included a further Professional Continental team, , which was later excluded. Astana and Team High Road were both later added, with Astana's invitation coming just six days before the event began.\nThe 22 teams who took part in the race were: \nRace previews and favorites.\nThe 2008 Giro featured an assortment of contenders for the overall victory. Defending champion Danilo Di Luca had faced potential bans which would have kept him out of the race, after investigations into his involvement with the Oil for Drugs scandal and an irregular doping test given after stage 17 of the 2007 Giro d'Italia, either of which could have resulted in a two-year suspension. Though he was suspended for three months because of Oil for Drugs, he was cleared by the Italian National Olympic Committee of any wrongdoing in the 2007 Giro, and was thus permitted to start.\nThe late invitation of to the race provided three potential contenders: 2007 Tour de France winner Alberto Contador, third-place finisher from that race Levi Leipheimer, and Andreas Klöden. One analysis of pre-race favorites considered Klöden to be the strongest of them, while another considered Contador to be the race's biggest favorite after his wins at the recently run Vuelta al País Vasco and Vuelta a Castilla y León. Both Di Luca and Contador had strong domestiques (support riders) by their sides, with Di Luca joined by two-time Giro d'Italia champion Paolo Savoldelli, Gabriele Bosisio, and Alessandro Spezialetti, and Contador by Leipheimer and Klöden. Other riders named as overall contenders included Denis Menchov, Gilberto Simoni, Vincenzo Nibali, Riccardo Riccò, Mauricio Soler, Marzio Bruseghin, Emanuele Sella, Evgeni Petrov, Franco Pellizotti, and Juan Manuel Gárate. Unibet.com's odds-on favorite was Klöden. 2004 Giro d'Italia winner Damiano Cunego chose to skip the race to better prepare for the Tour de France, adding to speculation that this would be the first Giro since 1996 to feature a non-Italian winner.\nSix stages were classified as flat and likely to be contested by sprinters. Italian sprinter Alessandro Petacchi, who had notably won nine stages in the 2004 race, did not plan to enter this Giro because of bouts with influenza and bronchitis which hindered his training. He was later suspended from the sport, and his contract with Team Milram terminated, as a result of his controversial doping case from the 2007 Giro. Sprinters identified as being favorites in the bunch finishes that the Giro would offer included Alexandre Usov, Dimitry Muravyev, Enrico Gasparotto, Maximiliano Richeze, Robert Förster, Mark Cavendish, André Greipel, Daniele Bennati, Paolo Bettini, Graeme Brown, Robbie McEwen, Julian Dean, Erik Zabel, and Alberto Loddo. Richeze was withdrawn by his team the day before the race began after a positive doping test, though he would later be cleared of any wrongdoing. His name remained on the start list, and he was not replaced, meaning entered the race with only eight riders instead of the customary nine.\nRoute and stages.\nThe race began for the second year in succession with a team time trial on one of Italy's islands, in this case Sicily (in 2007 it had been Sardinia). The route contained only four stages that were officially deemed mountain stages, but several of the seven intermediate stages contained selective climbs. The Giro had four time trials, three of which were individual and one a team event. Six stages were classified as flat.\nThe sixth stage was originally scheduled to be in length, but it was shortened the day before it was to be run. This decision was made because many riders in the race had become upset over the lengths of transfers from the end of one stage to the beginning of the next and that this afforded them little rest to prepare for such long stages. The Circuito del Gargano was eliminated.\nOf the four official mountain stages, three ended with climbs: stage 14 to Alpe di Pampeago, stage 15 to Passo Fedaia, and stage 19 to Presolana. Stage 20 earned its mountain designation by way of the Passo di Gavia and the Passo del Mortirolo, respectively the highest point reached and the steepest climb of this year's Giro. Two other stages had summit arrivals, stage 7 to Pescocostanzo and the demanding stage 16 climbing time trial to Plan de Corones, the summit of which the Giro had never before visited. It was hoped that the number of time trials, including one on the race's last day, would keep the race hotly contested to the end.\nRace overview.\nThe Giro started with a team time trial in Sicily. There was pre-race speculation that this stage would result in an American rider wearing the pink jersey for the first time in twenty years, as , , and were among the biggest favorites to win and all had strong American time trialists on their squads. The victory went to , which put their team leader, American Christian Vande Velde, in the first pink jersey. With a hilly stage ahead on day two of the Giro, Vande Velde's race lead was far from secure. He lost it to Franco Pellizotti, who finished sufficiently ahead of Vande Velde on the stage to take a lead of a single second in the overall classification. Pellizotti retained the race lead for the next three days, as those stages were flat and were contested by sprinters, with the overall favorites finishing together with the peloton in each.\nThe sixth stage was shortened from its original length of to . This was still the race's second-longest stage, and it featured a breakaway which shook up the race standings. Eleven riders finished nearly twelve minutes in front of the peloton, and reigning Italian national road race champion Giovanni Visconti assumed the race lead, by a margin of less than one second over fellow breakaway member Matthias Russ. Russ had begun the stage 13 seconds ahead of Visconti in the overall classification, but with Visconti gaining seven seconds on Russ at the finish line and six in bonification on the stage's intermediate sprint, the young Italian became the next to wear the pink jersey. Visconti and his team ably defended the jersey for nine days, keeping it through the hilly seventh and eighth stages, as well as in the individual time trial in stage 11 and in three flat stages. Visconti eventually lost the lead on stage 14, the Giro's first stage categorized as high mountain, as he finished more than eighteen minutes behind stage winner Emanuele Sella. The race lead passed to Gabriele Bosisio after that stage, but he was unable to hold it the next day, finishing fifteen minutes behind Sella, again the stage winner. It was on this stage that Alberto Contador took the lead that he would never relinquish.\nContador faced repeated challenges from Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They were separated by less than a minute after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among the three of them was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.\nEmanuele Sella of won three stages in the race's final week and took a convincing victory in the mountains classification, leading it for the entire race. His subsequent positive tests and confessions to the use of performance-enhancing drugs outside the Giro cast serious doubt on the legitimacy of these results, however. Daniele Bennati was nearly as dominant in winning the points classification, taking three stage wins and six other top-ten finishes. He led the classification after every stage except the second and eighth, which were both won by Riccò, who thereby gained the mauve jersey for one day on two separate occasions. Though Riccò was never able to take the overall race lead, he was the winner of the youth classification, taking the white jersey from Visconti when he lost the overall lead and holding it through the conclusion of the race. That jersey had also previously passed over the shoulders of Chris Anker Sørensen and Morris Possoni.\nFive teams repeated as stage winners. Four individual riders won multiple stages. In addition to Sella's three victories in the final week, the riders who won more than once were Riccardo Riccò in stages 2 and 8, Daniele Bennati in stages 3, 9, and 12, and Mark Cavendish in stages 4 and 13. also won multiple stages, with Pavel Brutt in stage 5 and Vasil Kiryienka in stage 19, after both figured into early morning breakaway groups.\n, , , , and all won one stage apiece. won the opening team time trial, rider Marzio Bruseghin won the Giro's first individual time trial, rider Gabriele Bosisio won stage 7 from a morning escape, 's Alessandro Bertolini took stage 11 from a breakaway, and veteran Jens Voigt was the winner of stage 18.\nSuccess was achieved by only a handful of teams, meaning that other teams did not achieve much in the race. Though they nearly took the race lead with Matthias Russ in stage 6, had just two riders finish the race, and were never otherwise close to a notable result. had only four riders finish the race. Two other ProTour teams, and , similarly failed to be at all competitive in the Giro. None of them would return to the Giro in 2009; Gerolsteiner folded in 2008 after being unable to locate a new sponsor while , , and all made it known that they did not wish to participate and were thus declined invitations.\nDoping.\nSeveral notable riders in the Giro were announced to have tested positive for banned performance-enhancing drugs after the race concluded. Prominent amongst them was rider Emanuele Sella, a triple stage winner, winner of the mountains classification, and a key rider to 's victory in the teams classification. It was announced on 5 August that Sella had tested positive for Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, better known as Mircera, a third-generation form of the banned blood booster erythropoietin. At the time the Giro was run, the test for Mircera was still in development. An out-of-competition control was taken on 23 July, just days after positives from the 2008 Tour de France had come to light, and samples were sent to labs in Paris for analysis. UCI President Pat McQuaid said that Sella had been targeted in the control and that \"[i]t wasn't rocket science\" to conclude that Sella's performances in the Giro could have been artificially enhanced.\nSella confessed his doping to the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) and named teammate Matteo Priamo, also a stage winner in this Giro, as his supplier. Though Priamo never tested positive for anything, and though the Italian National Anti-Doping tribunal originally exonerated him, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled, upon appeal by CONI, that he should be suspended for four years.\nRiccardo Riccò, a double stage winner and the best young rider, tested positive for Mircera during the Tour de France, and was subsequently expelled with his team . This control was taken just days before the one at which Sella gave his positive. Since it took place during the Tour de France, Riccò's results from that race have been removed, but the results for Sella, Priamo, and Riccò all still stand as no positive tests from controls taken during the Giro have come to light. Riccò claims to have only taken the drug before the Tour, but there has been speculation that his performances in the Giro were not legitimate. Sella has similarly confessed to taking the drug while not confessing to have used it during the Giro.\nAfter repeated positives over the summer, including tests from Leonardo Piepoli and Bernhard Kohl at the Tour de France, and Davide Rebellin and Stefan Schumacher from the 2008 Olympic Games, the UCI has sought to have samples taken during the Giro retested. In October 2009, it was announced that six to seven riders from this Giro had presumptive positives, while further untestable doping involving ozone was also suspected. In total, 82 samples were retested, and the presumptive positives have been compared to values stored at an anti-doping lab in Lausanne, Switzerland. The identities of those riders who tested positive have not yet been revealed. It is believed that Rebellin and Sella are among the riders to have presumptive positives.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2008 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point less per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, some points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized, either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the \"Cima Coppi\"), which in 2008 was the Passo di Gavia in Stage 20, afforded still more points than the other first-category climbs.\nThe fourth was the young rider classification which awarded a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1983 were eligible.\nThere were also two classifications for teams. The first is the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage are added, and the team with the lowest time is leading team. The Trofeo Super Team is a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications were awarded during the Giro, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour. Each mass start stage had one intermediate sprint, awarding points to the Expo Milano 2015 classification. These sprints gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the Expo Milano 2015 classification. This award was known in previous years as the Intergiro, and was previously time-based, awarding a blue jersey. rider Fortunato Baliani won this classification.\nAdditional minor classifications included the combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Mountains classification winner Emanuele Sella took this award. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were only awarded to the top three finishers in each stage. Like the overall points classification, it was ' Daniele Bennati who won this. Also, the \"Trofeo Fuga Cervelo\" rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stays clear. Along with the Expo Milano 2015, Fortunato Baliani also finished first in this classification. Additionally, teams were on occasion given penalty points for technical infringements. avoided any penalties, and so was the winner of the Fair Play classification."

        "title": "Tony Franklin (American football coach)",
        "text": "Tony Franklin (born August 29, 1957) is an American football coach, most recently serving as the offensive coordinator for the Army Black Knights sprint football team. Previously, he held the same position with the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders of Conference USA after making a move from the same position with the California Golden Bears. He announced his retirement from MTSU soon after the new year in 2021, following the completion of a challenging 2020 season.\nFranklin was previously the quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator of the Auburn University football team, before being fired from that position on October 8, 2008.\nWhile he was a coach at Kentucky, quarterbacks Dusty Bonner and Jared Lorenzen each led the SEC in passing.\nWhile a running back in college at Murray State in 1977, Franklin was a teammate of fellow future coach Bud Foster, who later came to prominence as the Virginia Tech defensive coordinator.\nCoaching career.\nFranklin began his career as a high school coach in 1979, including a stint at Calloway County High School where he coached Mr. Football in Kentucky, Pookie Jones, who went to play at Kentucky. Franklin continued coaching in the high school ranks at other schools, including perennial state championship contender Mayfield High School, winning two state titles. He was the head football coach for one year at Mercer County Senior High School before he was hired by Hal Mumme in 1997 to coach running backs at Kentucky.\nKentucky.\nAfter Mike Leach was hired away by Oklahoma, Franklin was named offensive coordinator for the 2000 season and led the Wildcats to the nation's 2nd best passing offense, as well as the nation's 11th best team in total offense (445 yards per game). He helped lead the Wildcats to their first back-to-back bowl appearances in 15 years and their first New Year's bowl game appearance in 50 seasons. During his tenure at Kentucky, Franklin was named one of the top 10 recruiters in the South.\nIn 2003, Franklin was chosen as general manager and head coach of the expansion franchise Lexington Horsemen of the National Indoor Football League, successfully leading the team to the playoffs in their inaugural season. The team led the Atlantic Division in scoring, averaging 53.1 points per game.\nTroy.\nIn 2006, Franklin was hired by Larry Blakeney to serve as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Troy University. In his first season at Troy, Franklin turned the teams stuttering offense around from the last placed offensive unit in the Sun Belt Conference prior to his arrival, to leading the league in passing and ranking second in overall offense. This remarkable turnaround helped the Trojans earn their first Sun Belt Conference title as well as the school's first bowl win, with a victory in the New Orleans Bowl. Prior to Franklin's arrival, Troy hadn't ranked better than 109th nationally in total offense in the previous four seasons. In 2007, the Trojans ranked 16th nationally in total offense (453 yards per game) and 25th nationally in scoring offense (34 points per game), helping the team win back to back Sun Belt Conference titles.\nAuburn.\nAfter spending two seasons with the Trojans, Franklin was hired on December 12, 2007, by Tommy Tuberville to serve as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Auburn University. Franklin implemented his new spread offense with only 8 days of practice, prior to the 2007 Chick-fil-A Bowl. The new system proved quite effective as Auburn bested their season average in all offensive categories, posting 423 yards of offense (233 passing / 190 rushing), had 24 first downs and ran an 11-year high 93 offensive plays, all despite playing against the #6 defense in the nation.\nThe Tigers' offense was much less impressive at the start of the 2008 season. Auburn started the season with a somewhat disappointing 4–2 record, losing to LSU and Vanderbilt and having close calls against two struggling teams in Mississippi State and Tennessee. After the first six games, Auburn ranked 104th in total offense out of all FBS teams.\nOn Wednesday, October 8, 2008, Auburn head coach Tuberville fired Franklin, citing a lack of offensive production from Franklin's spread offense, and noting Auburn's diminishing rank in most of the offensive categories in the FBS.\nMiddle Tennessee.\nOn February 5, 2009, Franklin was hired to fill the vacant position of offensive coordinator at Middle Tennessee State University. He replaced G.A. Mangus, who left MTSU to become the quarterbacks coach at South Carolina under his college coach Steve Spurrier.\nUnder Franklin's tutelage, the Blue Raiders offense improved from 7th in the conference in scoring before his arrival (and 84th in the nation) to 2nd in the conference his first season (and 23rd in the nation). Despite a losing record the year prior, MTSU finished the regular season with a 9–3 record including a win over the Maryland from the Atlantic Coast Conference (the lone conference loss came at Troy). The press characterized the year as redemption for Franklin after the difficulties at Auburn the prior year. Franklin's offense helped the Blue Raiders finish with 10 wins (after beating Southern Mississippi 42–32 in the New Orleans Bowl), the program's best record since it entered the Bowl Subdivision (Division I-A) in 1999, with the offense averaging over 420 yards per game. Franklin's 2009 unit set MTSU records in total yards, passing yards, and total points. Quarterback Dwight Dasher finished the season ranked 7th in the nation in total offense, threw for a school record 23 TD passes, and was named the SBC Player of the Week three times.\nLouisiana Tech.\nOn February 17, 2010, Louisiana Tech head coach Sonny Dykes announced the hiring of Franklin as offensive coordinator. The two had previously worked together on Hal Mumme's staff at Kentucky. In their first season, LA Tech's record improved to 5–7 overall and 4–4 in the WAC, with the offense improving in several areas of the NCAA statistical ranks including passing offense (91st in 2009 to 62nd in 2010) and total offense (66th to 52nd) while the team's average offensive national rank improved from 65th in 2009 to 54th in 2010.\nThe 2011 team saw significant improvement, winning the program's first WAC football title since 2001. The Bulldogs finished the regular season 8–4 and were invited to play in the Poinsettia Bowl versus 15th ranked TCU. The regular season losses included a defeat in overtime at Mississippi State, 2-point loss at rival Southern Miss (finished season ranked #19 in Coaches Poll) and 1-point loss to Houston (finished season ranked #14 in Coaches Poll). Franklin's offense again made improvements, ranking 42nd nationally in scoring and 45th in passing.\nThe 2012 Bulldogs again saw remarkable offensive improvement. The team finished the regular season with the nation's top scoring offense (51.5 points per game) and led the conference in every offensive category including points, total yards, rushing yards and passing yards. The offense included a well-balanced attack with runningback Kenneth Dixon leading the country in scoring, quarterback Colby Cameron finishing 4th nationally in total offense, receiver Quinton Patton finishing 4th nationally in receiving yards per game.\nDespite having one of the most successful seasons in school history, it was reported on December 2 that the Bulldogs would not play in a bowl game. They were initially invited to the Independence Bowl but the school administration asked for more time to decide to see if other options opened up. No other bowl invited them and the Independence Bowl selected Ohio instead.\nCalifornia.\nOn December 5, 2012, it was announced that head coach Sonny Dykes would be leaving Louisiana Tech to take the position as the head football coach at the University of California, Berkeley. The first assistant to be hired by Dykes at Cal was Tony Franklin as offensive coordinator.\nThe 2013 Cal football team finished 1–11. Their only win came against Portland State (an FCS team), by a margin of only 7 points. Cal's 2013 season amounted to the single worst record in the history of a program that first started playing football in 1886. The team failed to score 18 or more points in one third of its games.\nThe 2014 season was a year for redemption for the Tony Franklin system at Cal. Franklin's offense drastically improved productivity, especially in the passing game. Cal ranked 10th nationally in passing yards, and 31st national in overall offense. The Bears showed marked improvement, going 5–7 and just missing bowl eligibility.\nIn 2015, Cal finished 8–5, including a 55–36 victory over Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl. That year was the junior year for quarterback Jared Goff, whom he coached to conference records in passing yards record (4,714) and touchdown passes (43) in one season.\nMiddle Tennessee State.\nDate Hired: January 22, 2016\nIn 2016 he tutored two first team all-conference picks (WR Richie James and RB I’Tavius Mathers) and a freshman All-American (Ty Lee)\n2016 offense produced a 1,000-yard rusher and a 1,000-yard receiver for the first time in school history\n2016 offense set single-season records in total offense, total yards/game, total yards/play, points scored, passing yards, pass attempts, pass completions, touchdown passes, total touchdowns, first downs and all-purpose yards\nCoordinated an offense that ranked second in C-USA and No. 8 in the country in total offense, averaging a school record 517.7 yards per game in 2016\nIn 2018, QB Brent Stockstill was named C-USA MVP\nUnder his tutelage, Brent Stockstill became the school's all-time leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns, and completions while WR Richie James ended his career as the all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards and touchdown catches\nIn 2019, Ty Lee became the school's all-time leading receiver and Asher O’Hara was just the second QB to rush for over 1,000 yards\nDate Resigned: January 1, 2021\nArmy Sprint Football.\nIn the 2022 season Franklin led the Black Nights to a league leading 42.5 Points Per Game and 453.8 Yards Per Game.\nInstruction.\nTony Franklin is well known for owning and operating The Tony Franklin System Seminar. His copyrighted offensive system has been implemented by over 351 high school and college programs in 44 states across the nation, grossing over $170,000 annually from his consulting services. Several college coaches including Sonny Dykes at Arizona, Chris Hatcher at Murray State and Ed Argast at Fordham consult with Franklin about their offenses. Pro Football Hall of Famer John Hannah says of the system \"If both teams have players who are equal in talent, this offense is impossible to stop\".\nAfter taking the offensive coordinator job at Auburn, Franklin was forced to sell the ownership of his football consulting business to partners because of a SEC rule prohibiting coaches from participating in a clinic not on the institution's premises. The system became known as The System Seminars . Since his departure from Auburn, he has again taken control of the business and gone back to the title \"The Tony Franklin System\".\nBesides his offensive consulting work, Franklin has written a pair of football related books. In 2001, Franklin authored a nationally acclaimed book titled \"Fourth Down and Life To Go\" (), which chronicled his experiences with coaching football in Kentucky. The book detailed the inner workings of the Kentucky football program and effectively blacklisted him from coaching from 2001 to 2005 until he was hired at Troy. He authored a second book in 2005 titled \"Victor's Victory\" (), which dealt with the sudden death of 15-year-old Hoover High School football player Victor Dionte Hill, who died from a cardiac arrest during one of Franklin's consulting sessions. The book urges schools and youth organizations to make automated external defibrillators universally available."

        "text": "Matthew James Andrew Cooper (born 10 October 1966) is a former New Zealand international rugby union player. He made his All Black test debut against Ireland on 6 June 1992, setting a then-world record of 23 points on test debut, with the last of his eight caps coming on 3 July 1994 against France.\nBorn in Gisborne on 10 October 1966, Cooper was educated at Napier Marist Brothers and St John's College Schools where he was a member of the 1st XV from 1982 to 1984. In 1984 he played for New Zealand secondary schools against Australia then toured with the team to Britain. He made his Hawke's Bay debut in 1985 as an 18-year-old.\nChosen to play for the Otago Highlanders in the inaugural Super 12 series in 1996, Cooper soon proved his value with a couple of match-winning performances and that form saw him called up for the All Black tour to South Africa. On his return, Cooper topped 1000 points for Waikato. He continued to represent Waikato until 1999 and with 1604 points holds the union's scoring record. He also appeared for Waikato Chiefs 1997–99.\nInternational career.\nCooper had already played for the All Blacks in a 'B' international on the tour to Japan in 1987 after some outstanding performances for Hawke's Bay, but he saw Waikato as providing the first division base on which he could further establish his game. Soon after linking up with the Hamilton Marist club he was in the Waikato squad where he played both at centre and at fullback and became goalkicker. \nHis solid performances and points scoring efforts for Waikato kept him to the forefront and eventually he was given his chance at international level against Ireland at Athletic Park, Wellington in 1992. His 23 points in his debut test was a record and on the strength of that showing he was chosen for the All Black tour to Australia and South Africa that same year.\nHe played against the British Lions in New Zealand in 1993 and went to Scotland and England later that year where he became firmly established in the All Black midfield and took over the goalkicking role with great success. However, injury ruled him out of the test against England. He returned to play two tests against France in 1994. After retirement, he became the CEO of Sports Waikato and in 2005 became a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit.\nHis elder brother Greg, a fullback, was an All Black in 1986 and 1992, winning seven caps. The brothers are of partial Croatian descent. Before the one country rule for qualifying came into effect for international rugby, Matthew Cooper took advantage of his dual qualification and represented Croatia against Italy in their 1999 Rugby World Cup qualification campaign, during New Zealand-born Anthony Sumic's reign as Croatian coach.\nIn the 2006 New Year Honours, Cooper was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby and sports administration."

It was also known as the \"Bee Hive Ground\" because of its proximity to the \"Bee Hive\" pub in Walworth.\nThe Montpelier club acted through one of its presidents, a Mr William Houghton of Brixton Hill, to obtain a suitable venue for the proposed Surrey county club. In 1845, Houghton obtained a lease from the Duchy of Cornwall of land in Kennington. The initial lease was for 31 years at £120 per annum. Whereas Lord's had formerly been a duckpond, The Oval had previously been a cabbage patch and market garden, requiring considerable work to convert the land. The original turf cost £300 and some 10,000 turfs from Tooting Common were laid in March 1845.\nSurrey County Cricket Club was founded on the evening of 22 August 1845 at the Horns Tavern in south London, where around 100 representatives of various cricket clubs in Surrey agreed a motion put by William Denison (the club's first Secretary), \"that a Surrey club be now formed\". A further meeting at the Tavern on 18 October 1845 formally constituted the club, appointed officers and began enrolling members. Seventy Montpelier members formed the nucleus of the new county club. The Honourable Fred Ponsonby, later the Earl of Bessborough, was the first vice-president."

        "title": "Cricket season",
        "text": "Top-class cricket is almost always played outdoors, on uncovered pitches, and rain prevents play, so the seasons in each country are geared to coincide with the driest months of the year. The hours of daylight and the temperature are also factors in some countries. For example, in England the winter days are too short and often too dark, and the temperature is too low, for playing cricket to be practical. Normally, cricket is played outdoors but in the UK, cricket is played indoors when the season is finished, see Indoor cricket (UK variant), NOT the 8-a-side game played in other parts of the World like Australia and South Africa.\nDesignation.\nWhen designating cricket seasons, the common convention is to use a single year for a northern hemisphere summer season, and a dashed pair of years to indicate a southern hemisphere summer. Hence, 1948 for the English summer season and 1948–49 for the Australian summer that followed some months later. In the tropics, the designation depends on when the cricket is played. One convention is to use a single year if the season begins in April to September, and a pair of years if the season begins in October to March.\nOff-Season.\nIn the United Kingdom, the cricket season starts mid-April and ends in September, whereas in Australia, the cricket season begins in October and ends in February or March."

He served as the head football coach at the University of Houston from 1948 to 1954, guiding the Cougars to a 37–32–2 record. Lee played his college career at Centenary College from 1930 to 1932 under Homer Norton. Among his college teammates was Lovette Hill, who later served as his colleague at Houston on his coaching staff and as head baseball coach for the school.\nAfter his college playing career, Lee served as head coach for several sports including football to Overton High School in Overton, Texas. He was paid $90 a month, taught five math classes, a history class, and coached for four sports without an assistant. In three seasons, his record was 28–3–2. Lee then moved into his first college coaching job as head coach for Kilgore College where he compiled a 57–10–5 record before entering the United States Navy. Upon leaving the armed services, he coached at the University of Tulsa under Buddy Brothers for two years.\nAt Houston, Lee was credited with improving the strength of the Cougars' schedules. This began during the 1949 season, when Houston played its first major opponent, William &amp; Mary. He led the Cougars to their first bowl game berth, to the 1952 Salad Bowl, and a Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) championship in 1952. During his first season, fewer than 100 season tickets were sold by the Cougars, but by 1952, over 10,000 were sold.\nAfter retiring from coaching, Lee moved to Freeport, Texas, and became a regular at Cougars home games. He died on December 12, 1995, at Plantation Health Care Center in Lake Jackson, Texas."

        "title": "1984 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1984 Rose Bowl game, played on Monday, January 2, was the 70th edition. The unranked UCLA Bruins upset the #4 Illinois Fighting Illini by a score of 45–9.\nRick Neuheisel, UCLA quarterback, was named the Player of the Game. He completed 22 of 32 passes for 298 yards and four touchdowns. Neuheisel, who later became UCLA's head coach, threw two touchdown passes to his eventual predecessor, Karl Dorrell. As New Year's Day fell on a Sunday in 1984, the game was played the following day.\nThis was the third consecutive Rose Bowl win for the Pac-10, with nine wins in the last ten.\nTeams.\nIllinois Fighting Illini.\nIllinois opened the 1983 season with a loss to Missouri. The Illini then swept through the rest of their games including defeats of #4 Iowa, a 17–13 win over #6 Ohio State, and a 16–6 win over #8 Michigan. They became the first team in Big Ten Conference history to defeat all nine of their conference opponents. This was the fourth appearance for the Illini in the Rose Bowl, with previous appearances in the 1947 Rose Bowl, 1952 Rose Bowl, and 1964 Rose Bowl. The Illini were 3–0 in Rose Bowl appearances.\nUCLA Bruins.\nThe Bruins had won the year before in 1983 Rose Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines. The Bruins had a 3–5 record in previous Rose Bowl games. This was the second season for the Bruins with the Rose Bowl stadium as their home stadium. UCLA opened the season with a loss at Georgia, a tie with Arizona State and then a 42–10 loss at #1-ranked Nebraska. Starting quarterback Rick Neuheisel was benched after the Nebraska loss in favor of Steve Bono. On October 1, the Bruins lost to BYU to start the season 0–3–1. Bono was injured during the BYU game, and Neuheisel came back to finish the season. The Bruins then won five straight Pacific-10 Conference games, including a defeat of #11 Washington. The Bruins then lost at Arizona. They came back to defeat USC 27–17. A win by Washington State over Washington in the Apple Cup game put UCLA in sole possession of first place in the Pac-10. UCLA became the only four-loss team to play in the Rose Bowl. This was the ninth appearance for UCLA in the Rose Bowl.\nGame summary.\nThe weather was sunny and 84 degrees. As the \"visiting team\", UCLA wore their white road jerseys with gold pants, and the Illinois Fighting Illini wore their navy blue home jerseys with orange pants. This was the first time UCLA wore its white jerseys in a Rose Bowl; in three previous appearances as the designated visiting team (1962 vs. Minnesota, 1966 vs. Michigan St., and 1976 vs. Ohio St.), the Bruins wore their home \"powder keg blue\" jerseys since they sufficiently contrasted with the Big Ten representative's jerseys.\nThe game was the second Rose Bowl meeting between the two schools. They met in the 1947 Rose Bowl following the Big Ten–Pacific Coast Conference agreement in 1947. This was the eighth overall meeting between the two schools with Illinois having a 5–2 edge since the first meeting in 1947. The game was played on a Monday due to the Rose Bowl tradition of not holding the Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl on a Sunday.\nQuarterback Neuheisel, and several other Bruins awoke with food poisoning that morning. Some UCLA players were unable to play, including starting defensive tackle David Randle, punter Kevin Buenafe and reserve defensive lineman Tory Pankopf. Bruin Coach Terry Donahue realized that Neuheisel was so sick that his presence on the team bus might psych out the rest of the team. Donahue put Neuheisel into a private car for the trip to the stadium.\nThe Bruins kicked off. Don Rogers, the 1983 Rose Bowl player of the game, intercepted a pass from Jack Trudeau on the third play of the game with only 43 seconds off the clock. At the end of the drive, John Lee attempted the field goal. It was blocked by Luke Sewall of the Illini, and was picked up by the Illini safety Craig Swoope. Swoope ran with the ball and fumbled, which was recovered by the Bruins. The first score by the Bruins came on the following drive. The first of four touchdown passes by Rick Neuheisel was to Paul Bergmann.\nThe Illini barely used their rushing game passing 79% of the time, and Trudeau threw 14 straight passes in the first half. They had the ball on the UCLA 28-yard line starting the second period. Trudeau threw two incomplete passes and a four-yard completion. Chris White kicked a 41-yard field goal to make the score 7–3 with 13:59 left in the half. Kevin Nelson completed the next score for the Bruins with a 28-yard run. Don Rogers got a second interception from Trudeau, which tied a Rose Bowl record. On the following drive Neuheisel finished off with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Karl Dorrell to take a 21–3 lead. On the Bruins next drive, Mike Young scored another touchdown from a Neuheisel pass.\nIn the second half, Neuheisel threw his record-setting fourth touchdown pass to Karl Dorrell to put the Bruins up 35–3. The Illini were still struggling to get the passing and ground game going and failed to convert on third down. Another Bruin field goal by John Lee put the Bruins up 38-3. After the field goal, the scoreboard read: Caltech 38, Illinois 3, which was then changed to Caltech 38 M.I.T 3. The Rose Bowl was able to cut the power to the scoreboard before it was able to read Caltech 2 Rose Bowl 0. The Rose Bowl officials could not get the scoreboard straightened out, so time and score were kept on the field spoken over the public address system. At this point, Illini coach Mike White was battling the clock. The Bruins allowed the Illini short passes and Thomas Rooks of the Illini would score. UCLA finished off with one more running touchdown to make the final score 45–9.\nAftermath.\nIllinois finished with 0 rushing yards on 17 carries. Jack Trudeau completed 23 passes on 39 attempts for 178 yards with three interceptions. Trudeau's three interceptions tied a Rose Bowl single-game record (set in the 1963 Rose Bowl) which still stands as of 2008. Rick Neuheisel completed 22 of 31 passes for 298 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions. Terry Donahue was later to state that the man-to-man pass coverage by the Illini was one of the reasons that they were able to be successful. Karl Dorrell in particular was able to beat Illinois freshman cornerback Keith Taylor. Rick Neuheisel's four touchdown passes tied the Rose Bowl record, set by Pete Beathard in 1963, and later tied by Chad Henne in the 2005 Rose Bowl. Don Rogers' two interceptions tied eight other individuals, and has been tied again by four more. Jack Trudeau would later go on to set an NCAA record of 215 pass attempts without an interception in the 1985 football season.\nThe loss by Illinois, plus a loss by the #2 ranked Texas Longhorns to the #4 ranked Georgia Bulldogs in the Cotton Bowl Classic 10-9, and a sloppy win for the #3 ranked Auburn Tigers over the #8 ranked Michigan Wolverines in the Sugar Bowl 9-7, paved the way for the #5 Miami Hurricanes, who defeated the #1 Nebraska Cornhuskers in the Orange Bowl, to win their first national championship.\nThe international broadcast of the Rose Bowl also helped introduce the world to the audience wave, as UCLA and Illinois fans kept the wave going around the Rose Bowl stadium.\nEventual Minnesota head coach Tim Brewster was the captain of the Fighting Illini. Rick Neuheisel would eventually become coach of the Washington Huskies and coach them to victory in the 2001 Rose Bowl, the first time a Rose Bowl MVP coached a Rose Bowl winning team. Neuheisel eventually became the coach of the UCLA Bruins, replacing Rose Bowl teammate Karl Dorrell.\nIt was the first time that an unranked team defeated a top five team in a bowl game. The only other time this has happened was in when Purdue won on an 80-yard drive led by Drew Brees with 1:25 left in the 1998 Alamo Bowl versus #4 ranked Kansas State. Drew Brees and Purdue would later meet the Washington Huskies coached by Rick Neuheisel in the 2001 Rose Bowl.\nOn June 27, 1986, Don Rogers died of a cocaine overdose at his mother's home, only eight days after Maryland basketball player Len Bias died also of a cocaine overdose.\nScoreboard prank.\nA prank played by students from the California Institute of Technology altered the scoreboard display, an incident reminiscent of the Great Rose Bowl Hoax of 1961. A pair of Caltech students evaded security at the Rose Bowl, gained access to the electronic system and installed a computer that could be remotely controlled to alter the display on the stadium's digital scoreboard. During the game, the students from Caltech remotely altered the scoreboard display to show the teams playing in the game as Caltech and M.I.T., in place of UCLA and Illinois. One of the prank's perpetrators had received approval from his Caltech professor for the prank, which earned him credit for the course \"Experimental Projects in Electrical Circuits\"."

        "text": "William L. Stewart (June 11, 1952 – May 21, 2012), nicknamed \"Stew\", was an American football coach. He was named interim head coach of the West Virginia Mountaineers after Rich Rodriguez left for Michigan in December 2007. After leading the Mountaineers to a 48–28 victory over the Oklahoma Sooners in the Fiesta Bowl, he was named the school's 32nd head football coach on January 3, 2008. Stewart resigned in the summer of 2011.\nHe was previously the head coach of Virginia Military Institute for three seasons.\nPlaying career.\nStewart was a 1975 education graduate of Fairmont State College, where he was a three-year letterman and team captain for the WVIAC champions in 1974.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nStewart's coaching career began at his alma mater of Fairmont State, where he was a student assistant coach for a season. He became an assistant coach at Sistersville High School in Sistersville, West Virginia, in 1975.\nIn 1977, he moved to Salem College, where he was an assistant football and head track coach for two seasons. In 1979, he was an assistant coach at the University of North Carolina. He was also assistant coach at Marshall University (1980), the College of William &amp; Mary (1981–1983), the United States Naval Academy (1984), North Carolina a second time (1985–1987), Arizona State University (1988–1989), and the United States Air Force Academy (1990–1993).\nVMI.\nIn 1994, Stewart assumed the head coaching position at Virginia Military Institute (VMI). In three years, he compiled an 8–25 record. Stewart gave current Pittsburgh Steelers' head coach Mike Tomlin his first job as an assistant at VMI in 1995. Tomlin returned the favor by vouching for Stewart with the West Virginia University administration.\nStewart resigned in 1996 after making a racially insensitive comment towards a player regarding his on-field behavior. After what he believed to be excessive celebration by one of his players following a play, he told him \"Don't let your actions give people reason to call you a n-----.\" Stewart was forced to resign and later sued VMI for money he thought he was owed. Stewart described the incident as \"an isolated incident\" that happened while he was \"trying to help the kid\", and has said he never uttered another slur since.\nCanadian Football League.\nStewart served as the offensive line coach for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League in 1998. His line blocked for Mike Pringle, the first 2,000-yard rusher in CFL history. In 1999, he moved on to be the offensive coordinator of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers where he coached two all-conference receivers and a one thousand-yard rusher.\nWest Virginia.\n2000–2007.\nHead coach Don Nehlen hired Stewart at WVU in January, 2000 as the quarterbacks coach. Stewart was retained by Rich Rodriguez when he became the head coach after the 2000 season. Stewart remained the quarterbacks coach and special teams coach until 2007 when he moved to coach the tight ends and served as associate head coach.\n2008 season.\nFollowing Rodriguez's departure to become the head coach at the University of Michigan on December 16, 2007; Stewart was named interim head coach of the Mountaineers for the 2008 Fiesta Bowl. In that game Stewart led the team to a 48–28 upset win over the #3 Oklahoma Sooners. During the press conference following the awards ceremony, Fiesta Bowl MVP and West Virginia quarterback Pat White said of Stewart, \"He needs that job. He deserves it, the head coaching job.\"\nWVU booster and co-owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks Ken Kendrick, however, was unhappy with the hiring of Stewart. Kendrick called Stewart \"overmatched\" and said that he was \"very concerned\" for the future of WVU football.\nOn January 3, 2008, a day after the Fiesta Bowl victory, Stewart was announced as West Virginia's 32nd head coach. Stewart agreed to a five-year contract for $800,000 a year, totaling a $4 million base salary. Stewart hired former Mountaineer assistant coaches and players Steve Dunlap, David Lockwood, and Doc Holliday, along with assistant coach Chris Beatty and Dave Johnson. Stewart was also able to keep defensive coordinator Jeff Casteel and defensive line coach Bill Kirelawich.\nOn February 6, 2008, Stewart's recruiting class signed 23 letters of intent. The class did not include running back Terence Kerns, from Hargrave Military Academy, who later signed. Hawaiian center Benji Kemoeatu signed later in March as well. Jerome Swinton, a cornerback from Florida, was called “The best football player we have...he’s probably the best football player we recruited,\" by Stewart. The 2008 class, led by 5-star offensive guard Josh Jenkins from Parkersburg, West Virginia, was ranked 37th by Scout.com and 44th by Rivals.com.\nWest Virginia opened up the 2008 season with a 48–21 victory over Villanova, in which Pat White threw for a career-high 5 touchdowns. However, the Mountaineers were then upset by East Carolina, 24–3. White was held under 100 yards passing and rushing, and running back Noel Devine was held under 100 yards rushing for the second consecutive game. The Mountaineers then traveled to Boulder, Colorado, where they were defeated by the Colorado Buffaloes, 17–14, in overtime. The loss was highlighted by a 23-yard field goal miss in overtime by senior kicker Pat McAfee that allowed Colorado to kick a field goal to win the game. Before conference play opened, the Mountaineers defeated Marshall, 27–3, to even their record at 2–2. Stewart followed up the victory with a 24–17 win over Rutgers, and then a 17–6 win over Syracuse to produce a 4–2 record. Next, the Mountaineers rebounded from being down 17–3 before halftime against the Auburn Tigers, to score 31 unanswered points on the way to a 34–17 victory in Morgantown. The Mountaineers then upset the #25 Connecticut Huskies 35–13 for the Mountaineers' first road victory of the season and to move them into the national polls for the first time since before the loss to Colorado (20 – AP, 23 – USA Today, 25 – BCS). However, they dropped out of the national rankings after a 26–23 overtime loss to Big East champion Cincinnati. After a 35–21 win over Louisville, the Mountaineers dropped the Backyard Brawl, 19–15, to #25 Pittsburgh. The Mountaineers finished out the regular season with a 13–7 victory over USF in a \"White-Out\" to honor Pat White. The team finished 9–4 in Stewart's inaugural season with a 31–30 victory over #25 North Carolina in the Meineke Car Care Bowl.\n2009 season.\nStewart and the coaching staff at WVU opened up the 2009 football season by signing the #23/#27 (Scout.com/Rivals.com) recruiting class, which included the #3 quarterback Eugene Smith, the #5 running back Tavon Austin, and the #8 receiver Logan Heastie. On the field, the Mountaineers had a perfect record at home, including a 19–16 upset of then-#8 Pittsburgh in the Backyard Brawl. However, the team's record away from home included three regular season losses (at Auburn, at South Florida, and at Cincinnati). The Mountaineers also lost in the Gator Bowl versus Florida State in Bobby Bowden's final game as head football coach of the Seminoles.\n2010 season.\nStewart coached West Virginia to a second-straight 9–3 regular season record and a share of the Big East title (although the BCS bid went to the University of Connecticut due to a tiebreaker edge). However, for the second consecutive season, the Mountaineers played poorly in their bowl game, suffering a 23–7 loss to NC State in the Champs Sports Bowl in Orlando, Florida on December 28. The game marked a season low for points scored by WVU and season highs for points allowed, turnovers, and margin of defeat. After the regular season ended, it was announced that Stewart would coach the team for the 2011 season, after which he would step down and take a position in the WVU Athletic Department. He would be succeeded as head coach by Dana Holgorsen, who would spend 2011 as the team's offensive coordinator.\n2011 coaching controversy.\nOn June 10, 2011, Stewart resigned and Holgorsen took over as head coach, effective immediately. The relationship between Stewart and Holgorsen had been strained from the beginning, and came to a head in late May when Colin Dunlap, a journalist with KDKA-FM in Pittsburgh, reported that Stewart had asked him while he was a reporter with the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\", and a reporter with \"The Charleston Gazette\" to dig up dirt about Holgorsen and smear his name in headlines for their respective papers. These calls were made in December before Holgorsen even came to West Virginia. While athletic director Oliver Luck was unable to fully substantiate the reporters' claims, he determined that Stewart had become too much of a distraction and forced Stewart's immediate resignation. WVU and Stewart subsequently negotiated a buyout of Stewart's contract. It was reported that Stewart was fired for \"conduct detrimental to the university,\" but was allowed to publicly save face by resigning.\nPersonal life and death.\nStewart was a native of New Martinsville, West Virginia. He married the former Karen Kacor on July 1, 1978. He had one son, Blaine. He was a Christian.\nStewart died on May 21, 2012, of an apparent heart attack. After collapsing while playing golf with former WVU athletic director Ed Pastilong at Stonewall Resort near Roanoke, West Virginia, he was taken to a nearby hospital in Weston, where he was pronounced dead."

Soviet Tamara Bykova was the defending champion and the woman Kostadinova replaced as world record holder, her Bulgarian teammate, Lyudmila Andonova was also a finalist, though she was untested following a 2-year doping suspension.\nBy 2.02m the rest of the competition had topped out, the last being Susanne Beyer clearing 1.99m, Bykova and Kostadinova still having a clean round. Jumping first, Bykova continued clean at 2.04m, but Kostadinova took three tries to stay alive in the competition, putting Bykova in the driver's seat. After Bykova missed a second time at 2.06m, Kostadinova cleared, taking the lead. Bykova passed to take a heroic attempt to equal the world record, 3 cm over her personal best, her only chance for the win. Bykova missed and the medals were settled.\nHaving nothing to gain from equalling her own world record, Kostadinova passed to . On her second attempt, she went over. Kostadinova's world record has stood since."

        "text": "James Noel (born 18 October 1982) is a British professional basketball player and professor of English literature. He played for the Wolverhampton Wolves and Plymouth Raiders in the British Basketball League (BBL).\nBorn in Catford, London, to a Jamaican mother, Noel was educated at the Masters College in California. The 6'7 power forward returned to England in 2006 to sign with rookie professional outfit Worcester Wolves in the BBL. Despite the Wolves' dismal season, where they ended with a 4–32 record and a last-place finish, Noel shone through as a revelation recruit. Averaging 26.48 minutes per game, Noel posted 8.57 points and 7.96 rebounds in his first season out of college.\nNoel finished seventh in the Floor Shooting percentages table, with a tally of 54.19%, which raised awareness amongst rival coaches in the league. Plymouth Raiders head coach Gary Stronach was the quickest to react and immediately signed him during the 2007 close-season. Although initially signed as a back-up forward to Raiders' 2007 MVP Gaylon Moore, Noel displayed his tough play and strong hustle whenever he got the chance and soon forced his way up the pecking-order on Raiders' deep bench.\nNoel is a published author. He was a contributing author to the 2003 anthology, \"Open My Eyes, Open My Soul: Celebrating Our Common Humanity\", co-created by Elodia Tate and Yolanda King, daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. He is also the author and creator of the \"Boris Basketball And Friends\", a series of children's books.\nNoel is a professor English literature at Los Medanos College in California."

        "text": "Anthony Martin (born 24 August 1980) is a British professional basketball player, who plays for the Newcastle Eagles in the British Basketball League.\nBiography.\nThe 6 ft tall point guard began his career with the BBL Championship winning Chester Jets team of the 2004/05 season, making his debut in a home match against Sheffield Sharks on 1 October 2004. He also helped the team to the Play-off final that season, eventually losing to Newcastle Eagles, 75–78.\nBy his second season, he had commanded a place in the starting five, and averaging an impressive 81% on free-throws and 55% from the floor, whilst also tallying 12.2points in 23.72 minutes-per-game. Sadly, Martin missed the 2006/07 season through injury, but after fully recovering was announced as a surprise signing for the Plymouth Raiders during the 2007 close season, ironically coming in as a replacement for long-term injured captain Gavin Love.\nHe quickly filled the void left by Love, and although faced some stiff competition from fellow new guard signing Brody Bishop and long-serving Raider Allister Gall, cemented his place in the first team. His blistering pace is the cornerstone of his game, and Raiders' head coach has claimed him to be the fastest player in the league, while other comparisons to NBA star Chris Paul have also been drawn.\nFor the start of the 09–10 season Anthony signed for Worcester Wolves however things did not seem to work out for him as part of new coach Chuck Evans' team. Upon being released from his contract (by mutual consent) coach Gary Stronach moved quickly to secure Anthony's return to the South West's premiere basketball club.\nOn 4 September 2012, Martin signed for Newcastle Eagles to provide competition in the Point Guard position to Damon Huffman.\nMartin last played on the BBL during the 2012–13 season."

        "title": "1942 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1942 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game played on Thursday, January 1, 1942. It was the 28th edition of the Rose Bowl Game. Originally scheduled for the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, it was moved to Durham, North Carolina, due to fears about an attack by the Japanese on the West Coast of the United States following the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The federal government prohibited large public gatherings on the West Coast for the duration of World War II; the first significant canceled event was the Rose Bowl Game scheduled for New Year's Day, 1942.\nThe Oregon State Beavers of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) defeated the host Duke Blue Devils of the Southern Conference 20–16 in Duke Stadium (now Wallace Wade Stadium) on the Duke University campus. Donald Durdan of Oregon State was named the Player of the Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively.\nThe 1942 game was the only Rose Bowl played outside of Pasadena until the 2021 Rose Bowl, which was moved to AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas due to restrictions in California during the COVID-19 pandemic that prohibited any spectators in the stands. Rose Bowl officials moved the game to Texas due to fewer restrictions there.\nTeams.\nOregon State.\nIn 1941, the Beavers football team won the Pacific Coast Conference and a berth in their first Rose Bowl. In 1940, Oregon State had finished 5–3–1 and third in the PCC, the Beavers' third consecutive third-place finish. They opened in 1941 with a last minute 13–7 loss at USC. A 9–6 win over Washington set OSC on the path to the conference championship. The Beavers next played the defending national champion and #2 Stanford Indians in California. The Indians were nicknamed the Wow Boys, because they implemented the seldom-used T-formation, forerunner to the modern football offense. Oregon State shut out Stanford, 10–0, snapping the Indians 13-game winning streak, but were shut out against eventual runner-up Washington State 7–0.\nThe Beavers then shut out Idaho, UCLA, California, and Montana in consecutive weekends, outscoring the four a combined 85–0. The regular season finale was the Civil War at rival Oregon, which had the Rose Bowl on the line for the Beavers, and a possible five-way tie for first place if the Oregon Ducks won; all five teams would have three losses. Oregon State would have the most conference wins and also the best overall record. The argument was moot as Oregon State defeated Oregon and Stanford lost at Cal, leaving the Beavers with two conference losses. The rest of the PCC had four teams with three losses and five teams with four conference losses. Oregon State compiled the 7–2 record despite only scoring 20 points twice, against Idaho and Montana. The Beavers' defense only gave up 33 points all year, less than four points per game. Oregon State was led by Lon Stiner; at age 38, he became the youngest head coach in Rose Bowl history.\nDuke.\nPacific Coast champion Oregon State was responsible for selecting and inviting the opposing team. Top-ranked Minnesota was the first choice, but the Western Conference (today's Big Ten Conference) did not permit their teams to play in bowl games until the 1946 agreement between the Big Nine and PCC. Duke was a logical second choice, but Coach Wallace Wade had rubbed a lot of Californians the wrong way due to his antics following his 7–3 loss in the 1939 Rose Bowl. The southern California media championed Missouri or Fordham. Oregon State responded by inviting Fordham, who they had beaten in their 1933 Ironmen year. Unknown to Oregon State, both Fordham and Missouri had received take-it-or-leave-it offers from the Sugar Bowl before their invite to the Rose Bowl, and each had accepted the offer. Unable to invite their three first choices, the Beavers settled on second-ranked and undefeated Duke, much to the chagrin of Southern California, which was announced on December 1, 1941. Duke's defense had not allowed more than 14 points all year. The Blue Devils were averaging a 30-point victory every time they took the field. In each game, the Blue Devils won by at least 13 points. The Blue Devils were on an 11-game winning streak, having gone since their 1939 Rose Bowl defeat.\nVenue change to Durham, North Carolina.\nWith the United States' entry into World War II following the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941, there was concern about a Japanese attack on the West Coast of the United States. Much discussion focused on the possibility of an attack where any crowds might gather. The Rose Parade and its estimated one million spectators, as well as the Rose Bowl with 90,000 spectators, were presumed to be ideal targets for the Japanese. On December 14, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, recommended that the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl festivities be canceled. By December 15, the Tournament of Roses committee decided to cancel the parade and game. Soon afterward, the government banned all large gatherings on the West Coast. This ruled out Bell Field, Oregon State's on-campus venue, as an alternative site for the game.\nOn December 16, Duke University invited the game and Oregon State to Duke's home stadium in Durham, North Carolina.\nAt the time, Duke Stadium was the second-largest in the South but its seating capacity was just 35,000. In order to accommodate the larger crowd expected for the Rose Bowl, bleachers were brought in from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Kenan Stadium and North Carolina State University's Riddick Stadium to seat an additional 20,000 people. All 56,000 tickets sold out to the game in three days. Bing Crosby reportedly bought 271 tickets. It is unclear whether Crosby attended the game. Although Duke generally reserved a small segregated block of tickets for African-Americans, Duke initially decided to not allow African-Americans to attend. After an article in Durham's African-American newspaper, the \"Carolina Times\", claimed that Duke would sell tickets to Japanese-Americans but not African-Americans, Duke reversed its decision and, despite the game already having officially sold out, released 140 tickets to African-American fans.\nOregon State's Beaver Express train left Corvallis with 31 players on December 19, just three days after Duke University invited Oregon State. Standing on the platform in Corvallis was Chiaki \"Jack\" Yoshihara. Yoshihara had immigrated to the United States of America at the age of three on the last ship allowed into the United States before the United States put a moratorium on Japanese immigration. By executive order, no Japanese-Americans were permitted to go more than from their homes. Multiple FBI agents informed Oregon State coach, Lon Stiner that no exception would be made for Yoshihara. Teammates, students, the acting Oregon State president, and the campus ROTC commandant protested the decision to no avail. Yoshihara, the Beavers' 32nd player, watched the Beaver Express leave Corvallis from the platform without him on it.\nIn Omaha, Nebraska, members of the University of Nebraska's N Club gave Stiner a good luck horseshoe. Three days after leaving Corvallis, the Beaver Express arrived in Chicago on December 22. The University of Chicago had dropped its football program after the 1939 season, so Oregon State used their Stagg Field. The train with the Beavers' equipment and uniforms did not arrive by practice time, so Oregon State players wore maroon warmups borrowed from the University of Chicago during kicking and passing drills. The equipment and uniform train arrived just in time for Martin Chaves, Bob Dethman, Donald Durdan, and Joe Day to dress in full pads for press pictures.\nOregon State left Chicago on December 22, and on the way to Durham, they stopped in Washington, D.C. for practice at Griffith Stadium, home of the Washington Redskins and Senators, and a tour of the nation's capital. The Beaver Express finally arrived in Durham on December 24, five days after leaving Corvallis.\nTo simulate Oregon State, Duke practiced against what Brian Curtis of \"Sports Illustrated\" later called \"the most talented scout team in the country.\" It included Duke graduate George McAfee of the Chicago Bears to simulate Oregon State's Donald Durdan, as well as Duke graduate Jap Davis and North Carolina State senior Dick Watts.\nOn New Year's Day in Pasadena, the Rose Bowl Court and Queen, all clad in regular street clothes, drove down a deserted Colorado Boulevard, and later to a reception at the Huntington Hotel.\nGame summary.\nDuke was expected to win by more than two touchdowns and went off as a 4–1 favorite. Some wondered why Oregon State would even make the trip. Before the game, the NBC announcer who called the game, Bill Stern, asserted that the Blue Devils could beat the Beavers by throwing 11 helmets on the field. The comment was heard by members of the Oregon State team at the hotel. After the game, George Zellick told reporters that the team was \"hopped up\" to win the game based on Stern's comment. The weather, also, seemed to favor the visitors. One Duke player claimed that there was more rain than he had ever seen. The Beavers' Gene Gray, looking up at the same sky, described the weather as \"misty.\" The temperature was a hair over at kickoff. The referee that was supposed to handle the opening coin flip was Lee Eisan. Eisan was the second-string quarterback for the 1928 California Golden Bears, who lost the Rose Bowl 7–8 to Georgia Tech after Roy \"Wrong Way\" Riegels ran 69 yards the wrong direction to set up the game-winning Georgia Tech safety. Eisan made a less often talked about blunder. In the third quarter, trailing 8–0, California ran an end around pass on fourth down. The end around sucked all of the Georgia Tech defenders in. Eisan used the misdirection to get behind the defenders and might have scored a touchdown but fell down and failed to make the catch. Eisan could not find a silver dollar in North Carolina, so he borrowed a 50-cent piece from Oregon State's Martin Chaves. The Blue Devils won the toss and elected to receive. Before kickoff, there was a moment of silence to honor those lost at Pearl Harbor 25 days before.\nOregon State's Norman Peters kicked the opening kickoff. Duke's Tommy Davis collected the ball at his own five-yard line. He was crushed by the Beavers' Lloyd Wickett and two other Beavers and fumbled. Oregon State recovered inside the Blue Devil 30. The Duke defense would hold. The teams traded possession most of the first quarter. On third-and-six at the Blue Devil 15, Oregon State's Donald Durdan went back to pass. With no receiver open, he pump faked and took off to his right with nothing in front of him but the end zone to put the Beavers up 7–0. In the second quarter, Duke would tie the score at seven with a four-yard run on a reverse by Steve Lach. Oregon State's ensuing drive resulted in an interception at the 46, which was returned to the Beaver 27. On third-and-nine, the Blue Devils had a wide open receiver behind the Beaver defense, but quarterback Tommy Prothro's pass was just beyond the receiver's outstretched fingertips and fell incomplete. Duke ultimately turned the ball over on downs. The Blue Devils would threaten again late in the first half after an Oregon State fumble gave Duke a first down at the Beaver 32. Two plays later, though, the Oregon State defense sacked Prothro, forcing a fumble which was recovered by the Beavers. As the half was coming to a close, Duke drove to the Oregon State 42. Two Prothro passes were dropped by Blue Devil receivers, but a third was caught at the Beaver 10 and advanced to the 5. However, Duke was unable to get a subsequent play off before halftime, and the teams entered the locker rooms tied 7–7.\nThe head coach for Oregon State, Lon Stiner, gave an impassioned halftime speech, which was interrupted by an inebriated fan looking to urinate in the Beaver locker room.\nOregon State took the second half kickoff. After a first down, the Beavers punted. Duke drove to the Beaver 28. On first down, the Blue Devils ran a double reverse and lost 12 yards. After an incomplete pass, the Oregon State defense forced another sack of Duke quarterback Prothro, which ended the threat. The Duke punt rolled out of bounds at the 15. The Beavers drove 73 yards to the Blue Devil 12 before getting pushed back to the Duke 15. Oregon State's 33-yard field goal attempt was no good. The Beavers' defense pushed the Blue Devils back to their own nine. On third down, Duke quick kicked, and the Beavers started their next drive at their own 46. The defenses, which played brilliantly for most of the game let down for the subsequent three-drive stretch. Oregon State retook the lead when Zellick scored on a 31-yard pass from Bob Dethman, set up by a 24-yard Gene Gray run. Duke would respond on the very next drive, getting 39 yards on a Lach reverse around left end before scoring on a one-yard run by Winston Siegfried three plays later. The Blue Devils' coach, Wallace Wade, who had won the 1926 Rose Bowl while at Alabama after a comeback against Washington, remarked to an assistant that, \"It looks like 1926 all over again.\" 1942 would play out differently than 1926. In the following drive, Bob Dethman found streaking reserve halfback, Gene Gray, on a 33-yard pass. The Duke safety would just miss making a play on the ball. Gray faked inside and went outside, which confused Moffatt Storer, the Blue Devil cornerback, so badly that he fell down. The Duke safety on the far side of the field took a good angle, but Gray was simply too fast and outran the safety the final 35 yards into the end zone. The 68-yard pass play was the longest in Rose Bowl history and would remain the longest pass play for more than 20 years. The extra point would be blocked, leaving the door open for a Duke comeback. The 20 points that Oregon State scored were the most scored on the Blue Devils since 1930, they year before Wade became head football coach. It was the most points scored against a Wade-coached team since 1928.\nThe 14 points that Duke scored were the most that the Oregon State's defense had given up all year. The Beaver defense seemed resolved to make sure the 20-points the offense had put up would stand up. Duke's offense would cross into Beaver territory three times in the fourth-quarter, but the Beavers would not break, intercepting Prothro twice and shutting out the Duke offense the rest of the way. After a Duke punt went out of bounds at the Oregon State three, the Beavers opted to quick kick. However, Durden mishandled the snap. Rather than attempting the punt, Durden tried to advance the ball out of the end zone, but Mike Karmazin caught Durden before Durden was able to do so for a safety. The Blue Devils ensuing drive ended on a fumble at the Beaver 29. What appeared to be a great Oregon State return was nullified by an inadvertent whistle. Duke's last drive began on its own 26. After a 28-yard completion that gave the Blue Devils a first down at the Beaver 46, Prothro hurled two passes toward the Beaver end zone, but both were broken up by Oregon State defenders, one inside the Beaver 10. On the final play of the game, the Beavers' Dethman (who had thrown two touchdown passes as OSU's quarterback) came up with a game-saving interception on defense, ending Prothro's and Duke's hopes of a comeback. The Beavers won 20–16.\nAftermath.\nDonald Durdan, who showed his all-around skill by rushing for 54 yards and a touchdown, passing, and punting, was named the game's most valuable player. Bob Dethman also distinguished himself by throwing for two touchdowns and coming up with the interception that ended the game. The 1942 Rose Bowl remains the only Beavers' Rose Bowl victory. It also remains the only time the two programs have played each other.\nHad Duke not appeared in the 1939 game, they would've been the only invitee to the Rose Bowl game to have never played in Pasadena.\nAlthough many others argue that Columbia's 1934 victory over Stanford was bigger, Sid Feder of the Associated Press labeled it the biggest upset in the Rose Bowl's early history.\nNavy's head coach Major Swede Larson attended the game. At halftime, he was heard to remark that Oregon State was the hardest-hitting team that Duke had played all year.\nReferee Lee Eisan, who borrowed a 50-cent piece from Oregon State's Martin Chaves to conduct the coin flip, made it back to Berkeley, California with Chaves' 50-cent piece in hand, upset that he had failed to return the coin.\nThe East–West Shrine Game has been played after every college football season since 1925. The game started in San Francisco, California and prior to 2006, would be played in the Bay Area every year, except for two years. The first year outside of the Bay Area was 1942. As a result of the prohibition against playing football in West Coast stadiums, the East–West Shrine Game was moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. The West's coach was Washington State's Billy Sewell. A little more than two months prior, Sewell and the Cougars had dealt the Beavers the Beavers' largest loss of the year, a 7–0 decision in Pullman, Washington. The Beaver Express left Durham and stopped in New Orleans for the game on January 3, 1942. The game ended in a 6–6 tie. Many were concerned that the East–West Shrine Game would be the last football game \"in a generation.\" On the way back to Corvallis, Oregon State was able to visit the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. By the time the Beaver Express arrived home, the team had traveled 7,384 miles, through 24 states.\nAfter the 1942 Allied victory in the Battle of Midway and the end of the Japanese offensives in the Pacific Theater during June 1942, it was deemed that the West Coast was no longer vulnerable to attack, and the Rose Bowl game continued on in the Rose Bowl Stadium.\nMost of the players would don military uniforms during 1942. Wallace Wade enlisted after the game ended and encouraged his players to follow suit. Of the 31 players on the Beaver Express, 29 would serve in World War II. Both teams lost halfbacks in the Pacific Theater in 1942, Walter Griffith of Duke and Everett Smith of Oregon State. Al Hoover of Duke lost his life on Peleliu in 1944 after diving on a grenade to save his fellow soldiers. The Blue Devils' Bob Nanni was killed at Iwo Jima.\nJack Yoshihara listened to the game on NBC radio. He tried to enlist but was repeatedly denied. Once Japanese-American internment camps began popping up in the Western United States, he sold his prized 1941 Chevrolet. He spent most of 1942 in an internment camp in Idaho.\nTommy Prothro, who was later the head coach of Oregon State and UCLA in successive Rose Bowls, played quarterback for the Blue Devils.\nProthro's backup, Charlie Haynes, and Oregon State left guard, Frank Parker (himself the starting quarterback on the 1940 Beaver team), were rifle platoon leaders in different companies, sailing from Africa to Italy in 1944, when the two recognized each other. In the fall, Parker found Haynes with a fist-sized wound in his chest during the Arno Valley Campaign. Haynes had been injured 17 hours before and believed that he was going to die. Parker saved Haynes' life by carrying him on his back to an abandoned farmhouse for medical attention.\nIn 1945, during the Battle of the Bulge, Oregon State right tackle, Stan Czech, shared some coffee and food with a fellow soldier who had not eaten in two days. Czech soon recognized the soldier as Duke coach, Wallace Wade. Czech was taken prisoner days later and interned at OFLAG XIII-B. He managed to escape but was recaptured the next day and interned at a prison deeper inside Germany. By the time he was freed, after nearly six months in captivity, Czech had lost .\nDuke Stadium, the site of the game, was later named Wallace Wade Stadium in honor of the Duke coach.\nOregon State's Gene Gray flew more than 30 bombing missions over Germany and continued to serve after the war. In 1948, his plane crashed after a flameout on takeoff in the jungles of Panama. He later likened his body to burnt steak. He had severe burns over most of his body and both his arms had to be amputated. Gray, whose arms hauled in the touchdown catch which proved the deciding margin, wound up with no arms at all.\nThe last surviving player who played in the game was Jim Smith, who played for Duke. Smith died in 2019 at age 98.\nAs of February 2017, the last surviving Oregon State player, who made the trip to Durham, is reserve halfback Andy Landforce, age 100. Landforce only had three carries in 1941 and did not play in the 1942 Rose Bowl game. Instead, Landforce worked as a spotter for Bill Stern as a part of Stern's national radio broadcast of the game."

        "title": "Chris Harris (basketball)",
        "text": "Christopher R. Harris (11 August 1933 - 2 October 2022) was a British sports broadcaster and professional basketball player. A 6'3\" shooting guard, he was the first player from the United Kingdom to compete in the American National Basketball Association (NBA), as well as the first undrafted foreign-born player to play in the league's history.\nEarly life.\nHarris moved from Southampton to New York City when he was young. For generations, cross-Atlantic shipping was the family trade, on both his mother's and father's side. Two of his uncles, Charles and Clifford Harris, were White Star Line crewmembers who went down on the \"Titanic\". The game of basketball was a mystery to his relatives. In a 2004 interview, Harris said, \"My folks didn't even know what basketball was. I remember as a kid, I had a little basket in my back yard on dirt, but they kept telling me to play soccer. I replied, 'Nope, I'm going to play basketball in the pros.' They were laughing at me but after a while they knew it was going to be basketball for me.\"\nCollege career.\nWhen Harris was 18, he received a basketball scholarship to the University of Dayton, where he became a teammate of Jim Paxson, Sr., father of future NBA players Jim and John. Due to the Korean War, freshmen were allowed to play on varsity teams in 1951, so Harris participated on a powerful Flyers team led by All-American Don Meineke, who would go on to become the NBA's first Rookie of the Year the following year. That Dayton squad went 28-5 in 1951-52 and advanced to the final game of the National Invitational Tournament at Madison Square Garden in New York City, considered at that time the national championship of college basketball. Dayton would lose to La Salle 75-64 on March 15, 1952. The Flyers had a disappointing 1952-53 season, finishing 16-13 and not advancing to the NIT. However, in the second-to-last game of that year, on March 1, 1953, Harris played every minute in Dayton's 71-65 victory over number-one ranked Seton Hall University, scoring the game's final point on a free throw. The loss was the first for Seton Hall in 28 games. The Flyers rebounded with a 25-7 record in 1953-54, led by Harris, All-America forward John Horan, seven-foot All-America center Bill Uhl, forward Jack Sallee and guard Don Donoher, who would later become University of Dayton head basketball coach from 1964-1989, assistant coach on the 1984 Gold Medal-winning men's basketball team at the Los Angeles Olympic Games, and a 2015 inductee into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. Dayton would advance to the NIT Quarterfinals that year, losing to Niagara 77-74 on March 8, 1954.\nAs he entered his senior year, Harris had earned a national reputation as an exceptional passer and one of the game's top defensive specialists. “He was very good at covering guards. He had a textbook stance, like a boxer’s stance. He could move his feet,” Donoher said. “He wasn’t lightning quick, but he could play up on an offensive player so tight. And he was the first Dayton player I remember who took charges. He was very clever at getting into position and taking a charge.”\nAfter finishing the regular season with a 21-3 record, Dayton was back in the NIT, beating St. Louis in the first round with Harris setting a Madison Square Garden record for assists with 13. In the Quarterfinals Dayton beat Maurice Stokes and St. Francis 79-73 in overtime and reached the NIT Finals again, losing to Sihugo Green and fourth-ranked Duquesne University 70-58 on March 19. 1955. It was the second time in his college career Harris would play in the national championship game, in his adopted hometown of New York City, and Dayton would compile a record of 94-29 in his four years there.\nProfessional career.\nAfter graduating from college, Harris spent one season in the NBA. He originally signed with the St. Louis Hawks, but after 15 games they traded him and Dick Ricketts to the Rochester Royals for Jack Coleman and Jack McMahon. In 41 total games with the Hawks and Royals, Harris averaged 2.5 points per game on 24.8% shooting and made $4,800. He decided to end his NBA career after that season, since his wife was pregnant and he was planning a new business.\nHarris developed a close friendship with Chuck Cooper of the Boston Celtics, the first black player drafted by the NBA. \"He was a huge jazz buff and I loved jazz music\", said Harris. \"I was a huge fan. So any time we’d got to the big towns, he’d go look for the jazz club and take me with him. We had a wonderful time. He was a gentleman.\"\nHarris had a chance to return to the NBA the following summer, after joining a group of Dayton alumni in an informal game against the Hawks. He played well enough that Hawks coach Alex Hannum asked him to be his fourth guard, but Harris declined. The Hawks would win the NBA championship that year.\nPost-playing career.\nHarris left the game to become a successful businessman, operating a chain of television and appliance stores and an advertising agency in the Dayton area. He later worked as a vice president for an insurance company. Harris also became one of the region's best-known broadcasters, providing play-by-play of University of Dayton basketball games as \"the Voice of the Flyers\" for WHIO Radio (CBS) from 1965 to 1981, including calling games that would feature his Flyer sons, Doug (1975–1979) and Ted (1981–1985). He also served as that station's sports director for many years. Harris and his wife, Barbara — 1953 winner of the Arthur Godfrey Talent Scouts — married in 1955 and had 10 children. Despite his short career in the League, he remained active in the National Basketball Retired Players Association.\nIn 2013, Harris was inducted into the University of Dayton Athletic Hall of Fame.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA.\nSource"

        "title": "Western Collegiate Lacrosse League",
        "text": "The Western Collegiate Lacrosse League (WCLL) is a conference that participates in the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA). The WCLL operates in California, Nevada, and Oregon and is split into two divisions, Division I and Division II. The conference is governed by an executive board and the teams that win the conference's divisional playoffs receive automatic bids to the MCLA National Tournament.\nHistory.\nCalifornia Lacrosse Association Era (1959–1979).\nThe roots of the WCLL go back to 1959 when the California Lacrosse Association (CLA) was created. This was a hybrid organization that included both college and men's club teams in Southern California. Similarly, the teams in Northern California participated in the Northern California Lacrosse Association (NCLA). The founding members of the CLA included Claremont, Los Angeles Lacrosse Club, Orange County Lacrosse Club, San Fernando Valley Lacrosse Club, OMBAC, San Marino Lacrosse Club and others.\nIn 1969, UCLA joined the league, followed by UCSB in 1970.\nIn 1976, the CLA expanded with the addition of Southern California.\nOn occasion the CLA Champion would face the NCLA Champion at the end of the season to determine a conference or \"California State Champion\". UCSB captured the final state championship played under this arrangement defeating their northern counterparts in 1978. In 1979, at the urging of CLA VP and San Diego State alum Mitch Fenton, a separate organization for the collegiate teams in both the CLA and NCLA was brainstormed.\nCalifornia Collegiate Lacrosse Association Era (1980–1982).\nThe union that would eventually become the WCLL was founded on Super Bowl Sunday, January 20, 1980, as the California Collegiate Lacrosse Association (CCLA). A select few gathered at the house of then UCLA Head Coach Mayer Davidson's house in West Los Angeles. Co-founders also included Stanford Head Coach Sam Sadtler, the Claremont Head Coach and Mitch Fenton. The original 9 members were: California, Claremont, San Diego State, Santa Clara, Southern California, Stanford, UC Davis, UCLA and UCSB. Fenton served as the first president of the association. In the inaugural championship, the UCSB Gauchos defeated the Stanford Cardinal. One year later, Whittier College joined the league. In 1982, the University of Arizona, Arizona State and Northern Arizona joined the CCLA. That same year the Stanford Cardinal took home the championship defeating UCLA at Stanford.\nWCLL Expansion Era (1982–2008).\nIn 1983, the CCLA renamed itself the Western Collegiate Lacrosse League. That same year Cal Poly SLO joined the conference. Arizona Head Coach and WCLL co-founder Mickey-Miles Felton, who was instrumental in the addition of the Arizona schools the year before, served as the league's first president. The WCLL Championship Trophy is named in his honor.\nIn 1985, Loyola Marymount University was admitted to the conference. In 1987, Chico State was admitted as a full member of the conference.\nIn 1988, the WCLL split into A and B divisions (later I and II). That same year Chapman University and San Jose State University joined the WCLL as Division II members. In 1989, Sonoma State joined the WCLL.\nIn 1997, the WCLL, was one of the charter conferences in the US Lacrosse Intercollegiate Associates (USLIA). Prior to the 2000 season, Whittier College departed joining the NCAA Division III as an independent. Following the 2002 season, Division II member Cal State San Marcos left the conference. Following the 2004 season, Division II member Cal State Hayward (now Cal State East Bay) left the conference.\nThe addition of the University of Nevada, Reno and St. Mary's College to the WCLL Division I at the annual conference meeting in 2004 lead to a massive realignment of the conference. The 20 Division I teams were split into 4 geographic divisions (North, Central, Los Angeles and South) for the 2005 season. In 2005, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and UC Santa Cruz joined the league, followed by Cal State Fullerton and the readmittance of San Jose State in 2006. That same year, the USLIA reorganized into the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA).\nDeparture of Southern Teams (2009).\nThe league grew into the largest MCLA conferences but saw big changes in 2009. The University of California, Merced joined the league for the 2009 season but the league lost its entire Central Division, made up of Chapman, UC Santa Barbara, Claremont, Loyola Marymount, USC, and UCLA; and lost the majority of its Southern Division, including: Arizona State, San Diego State, Arizona, San Diego, UC San Diego. The WCLL also lost six of ten Division II members, including: Biola, Cal Lutheran, Cal State Fullerton, Occidental, Pepperdine, UC Irvine, and UNLV. The departing teams formed the Southwestern Lacrosse Conference (SLC).\nModern Era (since 2009).\nAfter the departure of its southern teams, the WCLL entered a period which would see several teams join, only to cease operations shortly thereafter. This included UC Merced (2009-2012), Cal-State Monterey Bay (2013-2014), the University of San Francisco (2015-2016), and culminated in one of the league's oldest members, University of the Pacific, folding in 2017.\nIn 2014, Sierra Nevada College joined the conference, they would go on to win four back-to-back division II championships from 2015 to 2018. The team ultimately folded in 2022 after their school was sold to the University of Nevada at Reno, which closed all of its sports teams.\nIn 2020, UC Santa Barbara returned to the WCLL after 11 years (2009-2019) in the SLC. \nIn 2023, the WCLL expanded to include its first team from Oregon, Southern Oregon University, moving over from the Pacific Northwest Collegiate Lacrosse League (PNCLL). At the conclusion of the 2023 season, Dominican University announced that it would be departing the WCLL, joining the NCAA Division II as an independent in 2024.\nConference championship.\nDivision I.\nWhen the conference was formed in 1980, it was determined that the top team of the Northern Division would play the top team of the Southern Division at the end of the season to determine the conference champion. This changed in 1985 when the conference championship was turned into a four team tournament among the top two teams in each division. The 2005 season introduced two new divisions to the WCLL, the Central Division and the Los Angeles Division, each of whom would send their top two teams to tournament. After many teams left in 2009, the conference dissolved all of its divisions and changed the tournament to be among the conference's top four teams. In 2019, the conference reintroduced its North Division and South Division, the champions of which would receive a bye round in a six-team tournament."

        "title": "Bill Daley (American football)",
        "text": "William Edward Daley (September 16, 1919 – October 19, 2015) was an All-American fullback who played for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers from 1940 to 1942 and for the University of Michigan Wolverines in 1943. The Gophers were national champions in his freshman and sophomore years. \nHe enlisted in the United States Navy in 1943 and was assigned to the V-12 Navy College Training Program at the University of Michigan. He played football for the Wolverines in 1943 where he rushed for 817 yards in just six games before being reassigned by the Navy. Based on his performance in 1943, he was named a unanimous All-American and finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting. Daley has the unique status of having played in and won Little Brown Jug games for both Minnesota and Michigan, compiling a record of 4–0 in those contests. \nAfter active service in the Pacific Theater during World War II, Daley played professional football for three years in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) with the Brooklyn Dodgers (1946), the Miami Seahawks (1946), the Chicago Rockets (1947), and the New York Yankees (1948). He later was one of the radio announcers for Minnesota Golden Gophers football for ten years and for the Minnesota Vikings when they first arrived in Minnesota. \nBeginning in 1973, he owned and operated the Daley Illustration Gallery in downtown Minneapolis.\nEarly years.\nDaley was born and raised in Melrose, Minnesota. After graduating from high school in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Daley moved to Chicago, Illinois to pursue a career as a boxer. Daley attended DePaul University in Chicago, where he met a track and field coach who persuaded him to pursue football.\nUniversity of Minnesota.\nDaley enrolled at the University of Minnesota where he played football from 1940 to 1942. He played on two national championship teams at Minnesota in 1940 and 1941, and the Gophers narrowly missed a third national championship in 1942. The Gophers beat Michigan in the Little Brown Jug game all three years Daley played there. In 1940, the Gophers beat Tom Harmon's Wolverines 7–6. Harmon missed an extra point that cost Michigan the game.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nAfter the 1942 season, Daley enlisted in the United States Navy. Because of his college background, Daley was selected to attend a midshipman academy at Columbia University in New York City. He was ordered to report to the University of Michigan because it had a V-12 Navy College Training Program. He stayed in Ann Arbor for only six months while waiting for an opening in the program at Columbia. While in Ann Arbor, recruits were required to remain in good physical shape and were given two choices: either participate in Navy fitness classes or work out with the Michigan football team. Michigan's football coach Fritz Crisler took advantage of the opportunity and convinced Daley to play for his football team, as Daley had one year of eligibility remaining.\nHe played for Michigan in 1943 where he was the nation's fourth best ground gainer despite playing in only six games. Daley's speed and power helped the Wolverines tie Purdue for the Big Ten Conference title. Daley averaged 6.8 yards per carry and scored nine touchdowns. He carried the ball 120 times, rushed for 817 yards and added another 119 yards on six punt returns. In addition to his six touchdowns, he kicked three extra points, for a total of 57 points scored. His best game came on October 2, 1943, at Evanston, Illinois, as Michigan beat Northwestern, 21–7 win. In that game, Daley gained 216 yards and scored two touchdowns in 26 carries.\nIn his final college football game, he helped the Wolverines win back the Little Brown Jug that he had helped the Gophers secure from 1940 to 1942. He holds the distinction of being the only player to win Little Brown Jug games playing for both Minnesota and Michigan. Asked at the time about having the opportunity to battle for the Little Brown Jug from the other side of the fence, Daley denied having qualms about playing his former teammates: \"It will have to be just another game. I look at it just as though it were an intrasquad scrimmage. There won't be any qualms about how hard I hit my teammates or how hard they hit me.\" He did note, though, that he wanted his last college football game to be memorable: \"If this is going to be my last game, I'd really like it to be one I can remember.\"\nDaley later recalled the significance of the Little Brown Jug in the years he played: \"We were always told to never lose this game. Winning the Little Brown Jug was very important to us. Fortunately I was able to go 4-0 in Little Brown Jug games while playing for both teams.\" Daley recalled that it was strange playing against his former Gopher teammates in the 1943 Jug game: \"It was strange as I was playing against my teammates and friends, but I think it was the idea of winning the Little Brown Jug that motivated me. We beat Minnesota 49-6 and the Jug came to Michigan. It was a wild story.\" The Michigan victory snapped a nine-game losing streak to the Gophers. In addition to Daley, the 1943 Michigan team also benefited from the arrival of another wartime transfer, Pro Football Hall of Famer Elroy \"Crazy Legs\" Hirsch from Wisconsin. The press referred to Daley and Hirsch as \"a pair of 'lend-lease' satellites.\"\nHe was named an All-American by the Associated Press and Collier's/Grantland Rice, and he finished seventh in the Heisman Trophy voting. When Daley was named an All-American along with Otto Graham in the backfield, one reporter referred to Daley as \"Minnesota's gift to Michigan by way of the Navy V-12 class.\" The article noted that Daley was a speedster who could run 100 yards in 10 seconds. He gained 817 yards in just six games before being moved elsewhere by the Navy.\nThough he never planned to play for Michigan, Daley looked back on the opportunity as a stroke of luck. \"I was a lucky guy. I got to play for two great schools, but playing at Michigan was one of the greatest thrills I could have had. When I was at Michigan, I was the happiest guy in the world.\" Asked what it means to have played an important part in the football traditions at both Minnesota and Michigan, Daley said: \"It means a lot to me. Both programs have been so wonderful to me long after I played. I am a member of both Hall of Fames and that is very special.\" Daley said his one disappointment about his college football career was that he never played on a team that beat Notre Dame. In 1943 Michigan lost to Notre Dame, 35–12. Despite 135 yards on 24 carries by Daley (the most yards gained on Notre Dame by any back in 1943), Michigan suffered its only loss to Notre Dame. Said Daley, \"I wanted to beat them so bad, and I played one of the best games of my life, but it wasn't to be.\"\nMilitary service.\nAfter spending six months in Ann Arbor, Daley went on to Columbia University where he was a Regimental Commander for Columbia University's Naval unit. \nAfter graduating from midshipman school at Portsmouth, Virginia, Daley went to Florida for amphibious training. He was on his way to the Pacific Theater when the war ended in August 1945. He remained overseas for a time, and played in an Army-Navy football game in Shanghai, China.\nProfessional football.\nDaley was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers as the seventh overall selection of the 1943 NFL Draft, but he never played for the team.\nAfter the war, Daley signed a $30,000 contract to play professional football in the new All-America Football Conference. He played four seasons with the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Miami Seahawks the Chicago Rockets, and New York Yankees. Daley recalled that football players \"didn't get paid much during those days, but did it for the love of the game.\" In comparing college and professional football in the 1940s, Daley noted: \"I think most of us enjoyed the college days better.\" Daley's best season in professional football was 1947, when he played with Chicago. He played in 14 games for the Rockets and had 633 yards of total offense: 447 yards rushing (including a 52-yard run) in 121 carries; 116 yards receiving on 12 catches; and 70 yards passing with three completions in six passes.\nBroadcasting career.\nFollowing a career in professional football, Daley returned to the University of Minnesota and got his degree in education. He spent ten years in the broadcast booth for the Minnesota Golden Gophers with Dick Enroth and Ray Christensen. He also did a few years of color analysis on radio broadcasts of the Minnesota Vikings when the franchise began in the early 1960s.\nDaley Illustration Gallery.\nDaley had always been passionate about art, but according to Daley, he \"never had the talent to paint or draw at a high level.\" He became an art collector. In the early 1970s, Daley and his wife, Melba, opened their first studio. In approximately 1974, they then opened the Daly Illustration Art Gallery in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Minneapolis. From 1974 until his death, Daley has owned and operated Daley Illustration Gallery located in the Hyatt Regency Hotel, 1300 Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Daley Illustration Gallery has 500 original illustrations, making it one of the finest illustration painting collections in the world. In a 1993 interview, Daley said, \"Some people just come in to talk football, but don't know much about painting.\"\nDeath and legacy.\nDaley married his wife, Melba, in 1972. \nHe died on October 19, 2015, at the age of 96.\nIn 1983, A Century of All Americans chose Daley as one of the All Time Football Fullbacks. In 2005 Daley was selected as one of the 100 greatest Michigan football players of all time by the \"Motown Sports Revival,\" ranking 63rdt on the all-time team."

Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name.

        "text": "Shannon Walker (born in Kyogle, New South Wales), is an Indigenous Australian professional rugby union footballer who plays Sevens Rugby for Australia. He previously played Rugby League with the Gold Coast Titans of the National Rugby League. His position of choice is as at Fullback but he can play on the Wing\nCareer.\nBefore the NRL &amp; Queensland Cup success.\nShannon Walker grew up in the rural country town of Kyogle in a large family as one of eight children. Walker spent most of his adolescence growing up in his home town, with a move to Bundaberg, Queensland attending primary school at East Bundaberg SPS and representing the Bundaberg Primary Schoolboys Rep teams. Walker developed a passion for rugby league with the Kyogle Turkeys, playing for the club from the age of 5 and eventually playing first grade for the side at the age of 16. In 2006, a year after representing Kyogle in first grade, Walker moved north to the Gold Coast to further his professional league career. He enrolled with the renowned rugby league nursery Palm Beach Currumbin High School and in his first year with the college was selected for the 2006 Queensland Schoolboys team and 2006 Australian Schoolboys Tour of Britain and France, where in the Australians first match against Wales Walker was named man-of-the-match.\nThe following year in 2007 Walker began playing Colts rugby league for the Gold Coast Titans feeder club, the Tweed Heads Seagulls, where he shone at junior level and quickly elevated into playing in the Queensland Cup senior side. The Seagulls and Walker had a brilliant season as the club reached the Queensland Cup Grand-Final, where they defeated 2006 Premiers Redcliffe Dolphins 28-18 giving Walker an early taste of Premiership success. His performance through the season was duly recognized as he was awarded the 'Courier Mail Queensland Cup Player-of-the-Year Award' and Gold Coast Titans 'Young Player-of-the-Year'.\nGold Coast Titans.\nMany critics believe Walker's debut in the National Rugby League would most certainly be some time throughout the 2008 season. After his success in the Queensland Cup Walker headed the list of youngsters widely tipped to make an impact for the Titans and battle for an NRL debut. He further staked his claim for a Titans jersey when in the Gold Coasts first trial of 2008 against the Canberra Raiders, Walker scored in the highlight of the match showcasing his pace and footwork to beat the Raiders fullback on his way to the tryline. He made his debut for the Gold Coast Titans against the Canterbury Bulldogs on 16 May 2008. He was also believed to be fastest player in the NRL at the time.\nOn 8 May 2011 Walker announced he had signed a contract with ARU to join the Australian Sevens Squad.\nIn 2016, he was signed to a train and trial deal with the Gold Coast Titans and was named in one trial match against Parramatta Eels. He was also selected to play for Gold Coast Titans at the Inaugural Auckland Nines in 2016. However, as at April 2016, Walker is again playing with the Tweed Heads Seagulls in the Queensland Cup competition."

Formerly the player/manager of Merthyr RFC and head coach of Barry RFC.\nBefore becoming seriously involved in the world of rugby, Jonathan was a talented footballer who was scouted by many professional clubs before switching codes after an invite to play for his old school, Aberdare Boys Comprehensive, against a select XV. This game would include his future teammate, Dale McIntosh.\nSuch was his enthusiasm and drive in the game, he was offered a trial by the then Merthyr Tydfil RFC manager (He was also offered a bet by his uncle that if he \"dump-tackled\" McIntosh he would be financially rewarded and make a talking point in the game few would have anticipated). After two years at Merthyr, Bryant was offered a trial with Pontypridd along with Robert Sidoli, and he scored a try on his debut against Llanelli RFC.\nHe attained his only international cap as a replacement against Romania on 27 August 2003."

India is currently not ranked in the IIHF World Ranking and has not entered in any World Championship tournaments or at the Olympic Games, but they have only participated in the Challenge Cup of Asia, a regional tournament for lower-tier hockey nations in Asia.\nHistory.\nBackground of ice hockey in Ladakh.\nThe history of ice hockey in India dates back almost 100 years, when ice hockey was a favourite pastime for the British Raj in Shimla. The Shimla Ice Skating Club is still very active in promoting ice sports in India. In the early 1970s, the Ladakh Scouts, a battalion of the Indian Army posted in the high border regions, took up the game. The high Changthang Plateau's frozen streams and high altitude lakes make the region an ideal place to play ice hockey, and as a result, the game spread amongst the army. The game gained more widespread popularity exhibition matches began taking place in Leh in the winter. With little to do during the region's harsh winters, locals began to play on a small irrigation pond in Karzoo, Leh.\nIce hockey gear was not and is still not available to buy in Ladakh. The few locals who have contacts outside Ladakh have requested friends to get ice hockey skates. The Ladakh Scouts are well equipped as they get their gear through the army. The Jammu &amp; Kashmir department of tourism also had a full set of equipment, but was reluctant to spare any. The only place in India where ice sports equipment is readily available is Shimla, a small hill station in the northwestern part of India, where two Chinese brothers began making skates that are still used today.\nDue to the lack of accessible equipment, Ladakhis began to improvise, with the first teams obtaining ice skating blades from Shimla and nailing them to army ammunition boots. Roller skates and ground hockey sticks were also used. To create pucks, locals cut the thick, rubber heels of army boots into a rounded shape. Goalkeepers wore ground hockey pads but lacked helmets; neither helmets nor knee and elbow pads were used by other players. Despite injuries, due to this lack of protective gear, the game has continued to grow in popularity in the region.\nNational team.\nIndia made its international debut in 2009 at the IIHF Challenge Cup of Asia in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, finishing eighth and thus last. In their first game, they were shutout by Thailand 14–0. After two more losses, a 10–0 loss to Mongolia and a 10–1 loss to Malaysia, India, bottom of their group with a goal difference of minus 33, in which they again lost both games. First, they lost to Singapore 5–0, and finally lost to Macau 8–0 in the seventh place game. Two years later, they suffered their biggest international defeat to date at 2–39 against Kuwait at the 2011 IIHF Challenge Cup of Asia. On 21 March 2012, the national team notched its first international victory at the 2012 IIHF Challenge Cup of Asia, they defeated Macau 5–1. India has participated in the IIHF Challenge Cup of Asia from 2009 to 2018, with the exception of 2010. From 2014 to 2018, they played in Division I of the IIHF Challenge Cup of Asia. In 2017, India finished second of four teams in Division I tournament (seventh overall). First, they narrowly defeated Oman 3–2, then lost to Kuwait 8–5, and finally won 7–3 over Macau. India has not been active, nor played an official game against other national team, since 2018."

        "text": "The PGA Championship of Canada is a golf tournament organized by the PGA of Canada, an organization founded in 1911 at the Royal Ottawa Golf Club. It was first played in 1912 as the Canadian PGA Championship. It was a Nationwide Tour event from 2001 to 2005. Prior to that it was an event on the Canadian Tour. Stan Leonard holds the record with eight victories.\nBetween 1978 and 1983, the tournament was sponsored by Labatt's and titled as the Labatt's International Golf Classic with a prize fund of C$100,000. It attracted many of the leading PGA Tour players of the day, with multiple major champions Arnold Palmer, Lee Trevino (twice), Raymond Floyd and Lanny Wadkins lifting the trophy during those six years.\nIn 2011, the PGA Championship of Canada was reintroduced as a match play championship for the top 64 competitors on the PGA of Canada Player Rankings. The P.D. Ross Trophy was given to the winner in 1912, and is still used as the Championship's award today."

        "title": "Official (tennis)",
        "text": " In tennis, an official is a person who ensures that a match or tournament is conducted according to the International Tennis Federation Rules of Tennis and other competition regulations.\nAt the highest levels of the sport, a team of up to eleven officials may be on court at any given time. These officials are broken up into categories based on their responsibility during the match. Contrastingly, many tennis matches are conducted with no officials present directly on court.\nCertification.\nTennis officials are certified by their respective national associations. The ITF also certifies officials in the categories of the chair umpire, referee and a chief umpire. Each ITF certification or \"badge\" is broken into five certification levels. The first, green badge, is considered sufficient for officiating at the highest levels of tennis within the official's own nation and is not divided into categories (and is primarily used in Spanish- and French-speaking areas, where a national organization may not be present). The second, the white badge, is divided into three categories (chair, chief, and referee) but remains only a national certification. The following three, bronze (chair umpire only), silver, and gold badge are considered international certifications. These international officials are those seen at the highest levels of play like the Grand Slams, ATP and WTA Tours, and the Fed and Davis Cups.\nChair umpire.\nThe chair umpire is the final authority on all questions of fact during the match. Questions of fact include whether a ball was in, the calling of a service let or the calling of a foot-fault. In matches where line umpires are also assigned, the chair umpire has the right to overrule if a clear mistake has been made.\nThe chair umpire is often situated in a tall chair at the centre of the court, behind a net post. The players' benches are to either side of the chair. From this position, the chair umpire calls the score of the match to the players and spectators between points. At the conclusion of a point, game, or set, the chair umpire times the players to ensure they follow ITF regulations on pace of play. The chair umpire is responsible for completing a scorecard, the official historical record of the match.\nLine umpire.\nThe line umpire (or line judge) \"calls all shots relating to the assigned lines.\" Line umpires work on court as part of a team of between one and nine line umpires. Each line umpire is assigned to one line or, in the case of a short-handed crew, a position in a system. For example, a line umpire on the receiver's side may have to cover the center service line then, following the service, move to one of the sidelines.\nThe line umpire signals a ball out by making a verbal \"out\" call (\"fault\" for a serve) followed by the extension of the arm shoulder high in the direction the ball was out. A ball is signalled \"safe\" or \"good\" by holding both hands together knee-high in front of the body. A line umpire who is unable to call a shot (usually because a player obstructs their view) signals this by holding their hands beside their head, the upper side pointing in the same direction as the eyes; that call is then the chair umpire's responsibility. Line umpires are also responsible for calling foot faults. When baseline umpires are being used, they watch to see if the server touches any part of the baseline before the ball is struck. Center service line umpires are responsible for calling foot faults when the server steps over the imaginary extension of the centerline. Footfault calls are made with a verbal \"Footfault\" call followed by a vertical extension of the arm with the palm open.\nTo reduce staff due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, the 2020 US Open employed electronic line judges on most matches, excluding those held at Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium. At the 2021 Australian Open, all matches used electronic line judges for the first time in a Grand Slam event.\nOff-court officials.\nReferee.\nThe referee \"is the official who is responsible for assuring that the competition is fair and played under the ITF Rules of Tennis.\" The referee supervises all of the aspects of play at a tournament including the conduct of players, coaches, spectators, and administrative crew. The referee must be present whenever matches are being played.\nThe referee also \"is the final authority on all questions of tennis law...\" Any player may appeal the chair umpire's interpretation of tennis law to the tournament referee or deputy referee. In making the decision on an appeal the referee must consider the rulings of fact of the chair umpire, as well as statements of the players and line umpires. The referee's decision is final.\nThe referee is also responsible for making the tournament draw in accordance with competition regulations. The making of the draw includes determining seeds and placing players and byes. The referee must then work with tournament organizers to schedule matches. This process has been made much easier in recent years with the introduction of computer programs that complete draw sheets and schedules based on online player entries and court availability.\nDuring play of a tournament, the referee is the sole authority on the suspension of play due to weather and other concerns.\nThe referee is usually only seen on court during the administration of a medical timeout. Due to the complex regulations dictating medical timeouts the referee accompanies the medical trainer onto court. The referee is present to explain procedures and regulations to the player and trainer, and to time the timeout to ensure no extra time is given, as this would be construed as an unfair advantage.\nChief umpire.\nThe chief umpire of a tournament \"appoints and replaces or reassigns, when necessary, Chair Umpires, (and) Line Umpires...\" Chief umpires are used primarily in large professional tournaments and are responsible for the recruitment and hiring of officials for the tournament. During the tournament, the chief umpire assigns umpires to courts, subject to overrule by the referee. The chief umpire also collects scorecards from chair umpires at the conclusion of the match and thus may furnish the media with any factual information they may request."

        "title": "Steve Mason (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Steve Mason (born May 29, 1988) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. During his National Hockey League career, he played for the Columbus Blue Jackets, Philadelphia Flyers and Winnipeg Jets.\nHe was selected 69th overall in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by the Blue Jackets. Playing major junior in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), Mason spent three seasons with the London Knights and Kitchener Rangers. In the 2006–07 season, he was named OHL Goaltender of the Year. He joined the Blue Jackets in 2008–09 and won the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year.\nInternationally, he won a gold medal with Team Canada at the 2008 World Junior Championships while earning tournament MVP and Best Goaltender honours.\nPlaying career.\nMason grew up in Oakville, Ontario, playing mostly A hockey until his Bantam year, when he moved up to the AAA level with the Oakville Rangers of the OMHA's South Central AAA League. He was drafted after his minor midget season with Oakville by the London Knights of the OHL in the 11th round of the 2004 OHL Priority Selection.\nIn 2004–05, while attending Abbey Park High School, he led the Grimsby Peach Kings club to the OHA Jr.C. title in 2004–05 and in 2005–06 was assigned to the Petrolia Jets Jr.B. club when his playing time was limited with London. Despite this, Mason was selected by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the third round, 69th overall, in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. He started the 2007–08 season with the Blue Jackets, but was returned to London after being a healthy scratch for Columbus' first two games of the season. While competing for Team Canada at the 2008 World Junior Championships, he was traded by the Knights to the Kitchener Rangers on January 4, 2008, hours before the semi-final game.\nUpon returning from the World Junior Championships with a gold medal, Mason was briefly recalled by the Blue Jackets on an emergency basis in February, but did not appear in a game and was quickly returned. Mason suffered a knee injury towards the end of the regular season, but with the playoffs approaching, he tried to play through it for several weeks. After defeating the Plymouth Whalers in the first round, Mason was pulled out of the line-up and underwent arthroscopic knee surgery on April 18, forcing him to miss the remainder of the OHL playoffs, as well as the 2008 Memorial Cup. Kitchener won the OHL championship without Mason, but lost 4–1 in the Memorial Cup final against the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League (WHL).\nColumbus Blue Jackets.\nBefore his first professional season, Mason underwent an additional knee surgery in September, causing him to miss the first month of play in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Blue Jackets' minor league affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch. Shortly after recovering and joining the Crunch's line-up, Mason was called up by the Blue Jackets on November 4, 2008, in the absence of injured starter Pascal Leclaire. He made his NHL debut on November 5, starting against, and defeating, the Edmonton Oilers 5–4. He recorded his first NHL shutout several games later on November 22, making 15 saves in a 2–0 win against the Atlanta Thrashers.\nMason continued to start games upon Leclaire's return from injury and was named NHL Rookie of the Month for November after posting a 5–2–1 record, including three straight wins and two shutouts. In the midst of shutout streak, having not allowed a goal against the Philadelphia Flyers, Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks, he was named Rookie of the Month for a second-straight month in December. Along with Mason's three straight shutouts, he posted a 7–5–0 record, 1.41 goals against average (GAA) and .950 save percentage for the month. Chosen to play for the rookies at the 2009 NHL YoungStars Game, he opted, however, to skip the competition. It was later revealed on January 30, 2009, by Blue Jackets General Manager Scott Howson that Mason had been suffering from mononucleosis for the previous three-to-four weeks. After three more starts, on February 8, Mason was put on the injured reserve. He returned to the line-up on February 13 against the Detroit Red Wings in a 3–2 Columbus victory. Mason finished the season with a 33–20–7 record, 2.29 GAA and .916 save percentage. For his season's performances, he was awarded the 2009 Calder Memorial Trophy for rookie of the year honours, edging out Kris Versteeg of the Chicago Blackhawks and Bobby Ryan of the Anaheim Ducks in the process; as of 2023, he is the most recent goaltender to win the award. Additionally, on April 27, 2009, the NHL announced that Mason was nominated for the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goaltender, along with Tim Thomas of the Boston Bruins and Niklas Bäckström of the Minnesota Wild. Thomas was eventually awarded the trophy.\nThe next three seasons were a disappointment for Mason, however, as he was unable to duplicate the play of his rookie year, and the Blue Jackets failed to make another playoff appearance.\nPhiladelphia Flyers.\nMason was traded on April 3, 2013, to the Philadelphia Flyers for goaltender Michael Leighton and a 2015 third round draft pick. On April 8, Mason signed a one-year contract extension worth $1.5 million. Mason had four wins and two losses in Philadelphia and posted an impressive 1.90 GAA and a .944 save percentage, leading to speculation that Mason would replace Ilya Bryzgalov as the starter for Philadelphia. In the off-season, on June 25, 2013, Bryzgalov was bought-out by the Flyers, where the team subsequently signed goaltender Ray Emery, effectively promoting Mason to the starter's role. On November 12, 2013, Mason recorded his first shutout for Philadelphia against the Ottawa Senators in a 5–0 win. On January 18, 2014, Mason signed a three-year contract extension with the Flyers worth $12.3 million for an annual average of $4.1 million. Mason finished the 2013-14 season with a 33-18-7 record and a .917 save percentage, which was enough to bring the Flyers to the playoffs. In the playoffs, Mason started 4 games and played in 5, going 2-2 with a 1.97 GAA and a .939 save percentage, but the Flyers were eliminated by the New York Rangers in 7 games.\nWinnipeg Jets.\nOn July 1, 2017, Mason signed a two year deal with the Winnipeg Jets for $4.1 million per year. The plan was for Mason to split the time with young Connor Hellebuyck but his season was de-railed by two concussions\n and a serious knee injury. \nOn June 30, 2018, Mason was traded to the Montreal Canadiens along with forward Joel Armia and a few draft picks for the Canadiens sent him to waivers in order to buy out his contract. Mason's contract was not picked up by another team, thus making him an unrestricted free agent.\nAfter a lack of interest in the free agent market, Mason opted to retire from playing and return to his hometown of Oakville to serve as the Director of Goalie Development for the Oakville Rangers, a youth team in Oakville.\nInternational play.\nMason first competed for Team Canada at the under-20 level in the eight-game 2007 Super Series against Russia. He then led Team Canada to a gold medal at the 2008 IIHF World Junior Hockey Championships in Pardubice, Czech Republic. Prior to the semi-final game against Team USA, Mason was traded within the OHL from the London Knights to the Kitchener Rangers. After defeating Team Sweden 3–2 in overtime of the gold medal game, he was named as the player of the game, as he was in the semi-finals. Mason was undefeated in five games with a tournament-best .951 save percentage and 1.19 GAA. He was named to the tournament all-star team, received top goaltender honours, and was named tournament MVP.\nFollowing his rookie NHL season, Mason was named to Team Canada's summer orientation camp for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. He was not named to the final roster, but he was reported to have been designated an injury replacement, along with St. Louis Blues goaltender Chris Mason.\nAwards.\nJunior\nNHL\nInternational\nOther"

        "text": "The Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball team is the collegiate men's basketball program for the University of Tennessee–Knoxville. The Volunteers (commonly referred to as the \"Vols\") compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC).\nThe Volunteers play their home games in Thompson–Boling Arena, on a court nicknamed \"the Summitt\", after former Tennessee Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt. With a current capacity of 21,678 (formerly 24,535), Tennessee has consistently ranked in the top 15 in the nation in terms of volume of attendance, averaging 14,817 (60.39% capacity) attendance from 1988 through 2006, and averaging 17,194 (79.34% capacity) attendance from 2007 through 2018 after reducing seating capacity prior to the 2007 season. Historically, Tennessee ranks third in the SEC in all-time wins. Many notable players have played collegiately at Tennessee—players such as Bernard King, Dale Ellis, Allan Houston, Tobias Harris, and Grant Williams who all play(ed) in the NBA. Chris Lofton, Ron Slay, Tyler Smith, and John Fulkerson are also notable players who later played professionally in other leagues.\nThe Volunteers are currently coached by Rick Barnes, who was hired on March 31, 2015, to replace Donnie Tyndall.\nHistory.\nRay Mears era.\nBuilding the foundation: \"This is Big Orange Country!\".\nIn 1963, the University of Tennessee hired Ray Mears to become the head coach of the men's basketball program. The hiring of Mears, who was coming off an NCAA small college championship at Wittenberg University, ushered in the most sustained period of success in Tennessee men's basketball history.\nIn his first year, Mears's Volunteers improved from a 4–19 record in 1962 to 13–11, highlighted by two wins over the Kentucky Wildcats. Before Mears, Tennessee had only beaten the Wildcats twice in 39 meetings. Throughout his career, Mears gained notoriety throughout the SEC for frequently being a thorn in the powerhouse Kentucky's side. In an era where Kentucky was coached by future College Basketball Hall of Fame members Adolph Rupp and Joe B. Hall, winning 75% of their games, Mears recorded a 15–15 record against the Wildcats.\nLed by A. W. Davis, the Volunteers finished second in the SEC in each of the next two seasons and recorded 20 wins in 1965, reaching that mark for the first time in 17 years. This success and the resultant growing fan support led to the university's decision to expand the 7,500-seat Amory-Fieldhouse to 12,700 seats. It was renamed Stokely Athletic Center to honor William B. Stokely, whose donation funded the renovation.\nIn the expanded Stokely Center's inaugural season, the Volunteers captured the 1967 SEC championship and made the program's first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. Dubbed the \"Fearless Five,\" the 1967 team won road games against top conference teams Florida, Kentucky, and Mississippi State. The win over Mississippi State, coming in double-overtime on a pair of Bill Justus free throws, secured Tennessee's first SEC championship in 24 years and is referred to by some as the greatest basketball game in Tennessee history.\nFrom 1968 to 1973, Mears kept Tennessee among the top teams of the SEC, winning a second SEC championship in 1972 and finishing second in every year except 1970.\n\"The Ernie and Bernie Show\".\nIn 1974, Mears and his trusted assistant Stu Aberdeen were able to recruit New York City standout forward Ernie Grunfeld to Knoxville. In his freshman season, Grunfeld led the team in scoring, averaging 17.4 points per game, and received first-team All-SEC honors.\nThe following season, Grunfeld was joined by fellow New Yorker Bernard King. Known as \"The Ernie and Bernie Show,\" King and Grunfeld led the Volunteers to a 61–20 record over three years and an SEC championship in 1977. During their three years together, Tennessee posted a 5–1 record against Kentucky. The Volunteers reached the National Invitation Tournament in 1975 and the NCAA tournament in 1976 and 1977. King was named first-team All-American and SEC Player of the Year in 1975 and 1976, and then shared the honor with Grunfeld in 1977, with both being named SEC Co-Player of the Year.\nGrunfeld graduated from Tennessee in 1977 and King chose to forgo his senior year to enter the NBA draft. King was drafted 7th overall to the New Jersey Nets and Grunfeld went 11th overall to the Milwaukee Bucks. Both enjoyed long and illustrious NBA careers.\nPerhaps the biggest impact of the \"Ernie and Bernie\" show was how it changed the national perception of the Tennessee basketball program. This \"Double Trouble from Tennessee\" was featured in the February 1976 edition of \"Sports Illustrated\". In 2013, ESPN premiered a \"30 for 30\" documentary called \"Bernie and Ernie\" about the all-time great Volunteer basketball players.\nExit and legacy.\nFollowing the exit of his two biggest stars, Mears, who long struggled with depression, was not able to coach the team in 1978. Under the watch of interim coach Cliff Wettig, the Volunteers struggled to an 11–16 record, and Mears officially retired due to health reasons after the season.\nMears is remembered not only as the greatest coach in Tennessee men's basketball history, but also as a great entertainer and marketer. From the beginning of his time at Tennessee, Mears employed marketing tactics to get fans to games—from his patented and provocative orange blazer, to his introduction of the Pride of the Southland Band to basketball games, to his entertaining pre-game warmups that compared to the Harlem Globetrotters for creativity. At the beginning of his tenure, Mears declared, \"This is Big Orange Country,\" and this slogan has lived on long past his coaching years.\nDon DeVoe era.\nDon DeVoe was named Mears's successor and took over as head coach for the 1979 season. Despite the losing record in 1978, DeVoe inherited a roster centered on All-American center Reggie Johnson. DeVoe's 1979 Volunteers finished the regular season with a 21–12 record, beating Kentucky twice and earning a second-place finish in the SEC. The 1979 SEC tournament was the first held in 27 years, and the Volunteers reached the tournament finals, where they once again defeated Kentucky by a score of 75–69 to win their first SEC Tournament championship since 1943. With the tournament championship win, the Volunteers were invited back to the NCAA tournament, where they recorded the program's first NCAA tournament win with a defeat of Eastern Kentucky. Tennessee was eliminated in the second round with a loss to Notre Dame.\nDeVoe led Tennessee to the NCAA tournament each of the next five years, but none of his teams advanced past the second round. Through his first seven years at UT, DeVoe compiled an overall record of 143–79 (.644). The program's momentum under his direction eventually weakened, however, and the Volunteers were not invited to the NCAA tournament or the NIT in 1986 or 1987.\nEntering the 1989 season, DeVoe's 11th year at Tennessee, his teams had not reached the NCAA tournament or finished above 6th in the SEC since 1983. DeVoe led the Volunteers to a 19–11 record and a berth in the NCAA tournament. After an 84–68 loss to West Virginia in the first round, DeVoe resigned.\nThe growth of UT basketball under DeVoe is still seen today in the Vols' current home arena, Thompson–Boling Arena, which was built during his tenure. By the mid-1980s, the overflow crowds had grown too large for the 12,700-seat Stokley Athletic Center. In 1988, the Volunteers moved to the new $30 million Thompson–Boling Arena, which seated over 24,500 people—at the time, the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States. Sitting on the banks of the Tennessee River nearby historic Neyland Stadium, the arena has accommodated 21,678 people since a 2007 renovation.\nHouston, O'Neill, Green, and Peterson.\nIn 1990, Wade Houston, an Alcoa, Tennessee native and former assistant coach at Louisville, became the first African-American head coach in Tennessee and SEC history. Houston's son, Allan Houston, came to UT to play for his father and would become one of the most accomplished players in Tennessee history. With 2801 points, Allan Houston finished his career as Tennessee's all-time leading scorer and was named All-American in 1992 and 1993.\nHouston was fired after a 5–22 campaign in 1994, finishing the worst season in Tennessee history. None of his teams reached the NCAA tournament, and only two of his teams received invitations to the NIT, the two of which were also his only teams to finish with winning records. Houston finished with an overall record of 65–90 at Tennessee.\nHouston was replaced by Kevin O'Neill in 1995. O'Neill—an intense and somewhat high-strung sideline coach, but also a skilled recruiter—took over a program depleted in talent. He was able to sign talented players such as Brandon Wharton, Tony Harris, and Isiah Victor. O'Neill left Tennessee to become the head coach at Northwestern after the 1997 season.\nO'Neill was replaced by Oregon Ducks head coach Jerry Green. Green inherited a roster with significant young talent and was able to an immediate improvement in on-court success. His first Tennessee team produced a 20–9 overall record—a nine-win improvement over the 11–16 record of O'Neill's third and final UT team—and advanced to the 1998 NCAA tournament. In his second year, Green's Volunteers won the 1999 SEC East Division championship and defeated Kentucky twice in the same season for the first time since 1979, in what is generally regarded to be the best overall year in school athletics history. (The 1998 Tennessee Football team finished 13–0 and won the first-ever BCS National Championship. In women's basketball, Pat Summitt led the Lady Volunteers to a 39–0 NCAA championship season, the program's third consecutive national title.)\nThe 2000 Tennessee men's basketball team finished 26–7, repeating as SEC East champions, winning the Volunteers' first SEC championship since 1982, and setting a program record for most wins in a single season. In the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers advanced to the first Sweet Sixteen in school history, where they lost a close contest to North Carolina.\nGreen's Volunteers began the 2001 season with a 16–1 record, rising to No. 4 in the AP Poll. Beginning with a ten-point loss at Kentucky in mid-January, Tennessee then struggled to a 22–11 finish. Green's team advanced to the NCAA tournament—the fourth appearance in Green's four seasons—losing in the first round. Coupled with his multiple incidents with local media and Tennessee fans, this disappointing finish to the season led to Green's resignation.\nHe was replaced by Buzz Peterson, who failed to lead the program to an NCAA tournament berth in his four years as head coach. He was fired after the 2005 season, in which his team finished 14–17.\nBruce Pearl era.\nRevival in Big Orange Country.\nAfter taking Wisconsin–Milwaukee to a Sweet Sixteen in 2005, Bruce Pearl was hired as the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Pearl's assistants Tony Jones, Steve Forbes, Jacob Nichols, Jason Shay, and Ken Johnson were part of a staff that would help to lead the Volunteers to the NCAA tournament six years in a row.\n2005–06.\nPearl inherited a roster that had not experienced much winning, but showed promise with future NBA senior point guard C. J. Watson and All-SEC freshman team shooting guard Chris Lofton.\nPearl's coaching, which included playing an up-tempo style and pressing defense, led to immediate gains for Tennessee. In his first season, Pearl led the Volunteers to a 22–8 record, an SEC East Division championship, and a no. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Pearl's first team achieved some of the more memorable wins in program history, including two wins against the eventual national champion Florida Gators. Another memorable win came when Chris Lofton, who is a Kentucky native, led the Volunteers over Kentucky in Rupp Arena for the program's first win there since 1999.\n2006–07.\nPearl's 2006 recruiting class was ranked among the top ten in college basketball. Despite the influx of freshmen and their inexperience, the Volunteers were able to open with a 13–2 start to the season. All-American guard Chris Lofton was injured and missed a good portion of January and early February, during which time the Volunteers opened 3–5 in SEC play. After Lofton returned, Tennessee won 7 out of their last 8 regular season games. Given a no. 5 seed, the Volunteers returned to the Sweet Sixteen where they faced no. 1 seed Ohio State. Tennessee led 49–32 at halftime, but the eventual NCAA runner-up Buckeyes mounted a comeback to defeat the Volunteers by a score of 85–84.\nDuring the 2006–07 season, the Volunteers were ranked 4th nationally in attendance, with an average of 19,661 fans in Thompson–Boling Arena, which has a capacity of 21,758. This marked an increase in attendance of an average of 7,436 per game since Pearl arrived in March 2005.\n2007–08.\nPreseason expectations for the Volunteers were high entering the 2008 season. Chris Lofton was a preseason pick by some to win National Player of the Year, and he was joined by Tyler Smith, an All-Big Ten freshman transfer from Iowa. Senior guards JaJuan Smith and Jordan Howell, along with rising sophomores Wayne Chism and Ramar Smith, propelled the Volunteers to a preseason no. 7 ranking.\nThe team posted a record of 28–3 in the regular season. The season was highlighted by the rivalry matchup between Tennessee and Memphis. John Calipari's Tigers were undefeated and ranked no. 1 and the Volunteers were no. 2. In front the largest TV audience to date to ever watch a game on ESPN, the two teams remained evenly matched for thirty-nine minutes. The Volunteers trailed 61–60 with 30 seconds left before Tyler Smith made a jump-shot to give UT the lead. The Volunteers added three free throws and took the contest by a score of 66–62. The following Monday, Tennessee was ranked no. 1 in polls for the first time in school history.\nThe Volunteers finished the regular season as the outright SEC champions and the no. 1 seed for the SEC Tournament in Atlanta. The Volunteers won their first game to set up a semifinal matchup against Arkansas in the Georgia Dome. The night before the game, an EF2 tornado hit Downtown Atlanta, damaging the Georgia Dome and much of the surrounding area. Because of this, the tournament was nearly canceled but was ultimately moved to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum. The Razorbacks were able to upset the Volunteers, denying them a place in the final and a shot at their first SEC Tournament championship in 30 years.\nThe Volunteers received a no. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they lost to the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball. Despite the disappointing ending, the 2008 season is remembered as one of the best in program history.\n2008–09.\nReplacing Chris Lofton proved a difficult task in the 2009 season. Now led by Tyler Smith, the Volunteers finished with a 21–13 record. However, Tennessee claimed another SEC division championship. The Volunteers advanced to the SEC Tournament Championship in Tampa before losing to Mississippi State 64–61. The Volunteers lost their NCAA tournament first-round game to Oklahoma State.\n2009–10.\nEntering the regular season ranked in the top 10, the Volunteers started the season 10–2. On New Year's Day, players Melvin Goins, Cam Tatum, Brian Williams, and leading scorer Tyler Smith were arrested after a traffic stop when police found marijuana and an illegal firearm. The players were all suspended for multiple games and Tyler Smith was eventually dismissed from the team.\nAfter the suspensions, the Volunteers were left with only six scholarship players. The Volunteers defeated Charlotte and then hosted no. 1 Kansas the next game. In front of a sellout crowd, the undermanned Volunteers defeated the Jayhawks 76–68. Tennessee cemented its lead with a shot clock-beating three-point shot with under a minute left by local freshman walk-on Skylar McBee, who entered the rotation due to the suspensions.\nTennessee rode the momentum of the Kansas upset to a 23–7 regular season record. This included another upset of second-ranked Kentucky, which featured future NBA All-Stars John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins, as well as four other eventual NBA players. The Volunteers won 74–65 at home in front of a raucous crowd. The Wildcats were able to avenge the loss a week and half later in the SEC Tournament.\nAs a no. 6 seed in a bracket featuring overall top seed Kansas, the Volunteers defeated a Steve Fisher-coached San Diego State team with Kawhi Leonard in the first round. No. 14 seed Ohio upset the no. 3 seed Georgetown Hoyas, setting up a matchup between the Volunteers and the Bobcats in the following round. After winning 83–68, Tennessee advanced to Bruce Pearl's third Sweet Sixteen in five years.\nIn a rematch of the 2007 Sweet Sixteen, the Volunteers faced the Ohio State Buckeyes at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis. In a back and forth battle with the Evan Turner-led Buckeyes, Tennessee held a 76–73 lead with 13 seconds left. Turner missed a three-point shot, rebounded his own missed shot, and attempted a final three-point shot that was blocked by J. P. Prince, securing the Volunteers an appearance in the Elite Eight for the first time in program history.\nTennessee faced Michigan State in the Elite Eight. After a fast start, the Vols sputtered in the second half and Michigan State was able to keep the game close. Down by one point with 11 seconds left, Tennessee's Scotty Hopson was set to attempt two free throws. He made the first but missed the second. With the score tied, Michigan State advanced the ball and was fouled on a fast break. Raymar Morgan made one of two free throws, and Michigan State was able to defeat Tennessee one game short of the Final Four.\n2010–11.\nTennessee opened the 2010–11 season with success, winning the Preseason NIT and rising as high as no. 7 in the national polls. In mid-December, the NCAA announced an investigation into Bruce Pearl for his role in a possible recruiting violation. SEC Commissioner Mike Slive suspended Pearl for the first half of the SEC season. Tennessee faltered throughout the rest of the season to a 19–15 record. Tennessee appeared in the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive year under Pearl and faced Michigan in the opening round. The Volunteers were defeated 75–45 in what proved to be Pearl's last game.\nOn March 21, 2011, the week after the loss, the university announced the firing of Pearl, based on Pearl's misconduct of lying to the NCAA in the ongoing investigation. Pearl was eventually given a three-year show-cause penalty.\nCuonzo Martin and Donnie Tyndall.\nOn March 27, 2011, the University of Tennessee announced the hiring of Cuonzo Martin as the Volunteers' 18th head coach. Martin had spent the prior three seasons at Missouri State, where he compiled a record of 61–41. Martin was able to lead the Missouri State team from an 11–20 record and a last-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference to a 26–9 record and a first-place conference finish.\nMartin took over a depleted roster with low expectations. After the departure of Tobias Harris following his freshman season, the Volunteers were picked to finish near the bottom of the SEC in 2011–12. With the emergence of Jordan McRae and Jeronne Maymon, and the mid-season addition of Jarnell Stokes, Martin took a team that had lost their top three—and seven of their top ten—contributors from the previous season to a second-place finish in the SEC, largely because of their tough defense and lack of turnovers. With an outside chance at the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers lost their first SEC tournament game to Ole Miss, ending their NCAA chances. They played in the NIT before losing in the second round.\nIn 2012–13, the Volunteers started off slowly, posting an 11–10 record before finishing the regular season 8–1. UT was eliminated in the second round of the SEC Tournament and was left out of the NCAA tournament for the second straight year, finishing as one of the last teams out.\nExpectations were high heading into 2013–14 with a roster many felt could compete for a Sweet Sixteen appearance. However, the fans quickly grew vocally upset after another slow start of 16–11. A petition with thousands of signatures surfaced online for the firing of Cuonzo Martin and the re-hiring of Bruce Pearl, whose show-cause order was ending the next year. Whether the petition motivated the team or not, the Volunteers finished the season 5–1 and earned a place in the \"First Four\" round of the NCAA tournament. They defeated Iowa in the play-in game in Dayton, Ohio to move on to face the UMass Minutemen. Martin's Volunteers, who were the lower seed, were favored by many and easily defeated UMass. In one of the biggest upsets in tournament history, Mercer upset Duke, and the Volunteers went on to defeat Mercer to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Tennessee then played Michigan in Indianapolis. In front of one of the largest crowds to witness a Sweet Sixteen game, the Volunteers' comeback fell short and UT lost to Michigan by a score of 73–71.\nMartin resigned from Tennessee and accepted the coaching job at California on April 15, 2014. After a brief coaching search, Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart announced on April 21, 2014 that former Morehead State and Southern Mississippi head coach Donnie Tyndall would become the next head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers.\nTyndall inherited a roster that returned one contributing player from the previous year. Also, due to Jarnell Stokes's decision to enter the NBA draft and two other players transferring, Tyndall had to recruit and sign nearly one-third of the 2015 team's roster in less than a month. Under these circumstances, he led the 2015 team to a 16–16 record.\nAfter the season was over, Tennessee announced it was firing Tyndall with cause after it learned that he had lied to both UT and the NCAA about the severity of major NCAA violations that had occurred at Southern Miss. Hart said that he would have never hired Tyndall had the true extent of the violations been known. By this time, it was clear that Tyndall would face severe penalties for his role in the violations, including a suspension for part of the season. According to ESPN, Hart and other officials were still smarting from Pearl having to sit out the first half of conference play three years earlier, and were not willing to face the prospect of an equally lengthy suspension for Tyndall.\nRick Barnes era.\nWhile searching for its third basketball coach in four years, Tennessee sought to make a hire that would bring much-needed stability to the program. During the search process, news broke that Texas had fired their head coach of 17 years, Rick Barnes. Barnes, who had a prior connection to Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart, quickly surfaced as the frontrunner for the job.\nOn March 31, 2015, Barnes was named the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Barnes boasts the best record of any coach in school history, with an overall record of 604–314 from his previous tenures at Texas, Clemson, and Providence. Barnes is originally from nearby Hickory, North Carolina, and his wife, Candy, graduated from Tennessee in 1975. The Rick Barnes era began on a winning note as Tennessee defeated UNC Asheville, 82–78 in Barnes' debut game at UT.\nIn Barnes' third year as Tennessee's coach he completed quite the turnaround from the previous year's 16–16 (8–10) team, as his team would finish the regular season 26–9 (13–5) and capture a share of the SEC regular season title. This would be Tennessee's first regular season title since 2008 and tenth overall. Tennessee also reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Kentucky 77–72.\nIn 2019, Tennessee experienced their best season record wise under Barnes. The Volunteers would earn a record of 31–6 (15–3) including an 18-game win streak and a no.1 ranking in the polls for the first time since the 2007–08 season. The Volunteers again reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Auburn 84–64. The Volunteers proceeded to earn a #2 seed in the 2019 NCAA tournament, where they defeated Colgate 77–70 in the first round. Tennessee overcame a resurgent Iowa Hawkeyes team in the second round by a score of 83–77 in an overtime thriller. The Volunteers fell to Purdue in the Sweet Sixteen in overtime after a thrilling come-from-behind run led by Volunteer guard Admiral Schofield. Purdue's Ryan Cline kept the Boilermakers in the game late and after a controversial call on Lamonte Turner, the Vols lost. Junior forward Grant Williams captured the 2018–19 SEC player of the year award, his second consecutive year obtaining the honor.\nSeason–by–season results.\nSource\n \nFacilities.\nTennessee plays its home games in Thompson–Boling Arena, which was at one time the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States, with a seating capacity of 24,678 until its 2007 renovation. Named for the late B. Ray Thompson and former UT President Dr. Edward J. Boling, the arena regularly hosts women's volleyball matches, concerts, camps, conferences, and other special events throughout the year.\nThompson–Boling Arena opened during the 1987–88 season, with Tennessee defeating Marquette 82–56 before a crowd of 25,272. In its opening season, the Volunteers finished third nationally in attendance, with an average attendance of more than 20,000 fans per game. Much of the facility's storied history has centered on men's and women's basketball. In the last two decades, the Volunteers and Lady Volunteers have hosted record college basketball crowds, as well as WNBA and NCAA tournament basketball games. The Volunteers have ranked fourth in the nation in average home attendance for each of the past three seasons, including an average of 20,483 fans per game in 2008–09. Tennessee's 1989 men's game against Kentucky set the SEC regular-season record with a crowd of 25,610. The Lady Volunteers drew 24,597 fans for their 1998 game with Connecticut to establish a women's NCAA record, while a Celtics-Bullets game in 1988 attracted a then-NBA-record exhibition crowd of 23,611. The arena's largest basketball crowd since its capacity was reduced to 21,678 prior to the 2007–08 season came on January 7, 2009, when the Vols hosted Gonzaga in front of a sellout crowd of 22,326.\nUT hosted the NCAA tournament's South Regional Finals in 1994 and 1999 in the spacious facility, as well as the 1990 NCAA Southeast Region's first- and second-round games and the NCAA women's 1990 Final Four. The 1989 SEC Tournament was the first of what promised to be many postseason tournaments to be held in Thompson–Boling Arena. The riverfront arena has drawn rave reviews from teams, administrators, and media for its modern facilities needed for hosting major tournaments.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Volunteers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 26 times.

The Salukis compete in the NCAA Division 1, and they play their home games at Banterra Center. As of March 2024, former South Dakota State and Wright State coach, Scott Nagy, has become the newest head coach of the Southern Illinois basketball program.\nHistory.\nPrior to joining the NCAA, the Salukis competed in the NAIA men's basketball. Appearing five times, with a combined tournament record of 9 wins and 4 losses. Most notable tournament appearances came in 1945, in which the Salukis finished third, and then the following year in the 1946 tournament where the Salukis were NAIA national champions. The Salukis would not place again in the following three tournament appearances in 1947, 1948, 1960.\nIn 1967, SIU, led by guard Walt Frazier, who went on to be named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, won the National Invitation Tournament under coach Jack Hartman. At the time, the tournament was considered much more prestigious than it is today. The Salukis were members of the College Division (now Division II) and were therefore ineligible to compete for the NCAA Division I Tournament.\nIn 1977, future NBA player Mike Glenn led the Salukis to the NCAA Division I Tournament Sweet Sixteen.\nFrom 1993 to 1995, SIU advanced to three straight NCAA Division I Tournaments. Prior to that, the Salukis participated in the National Invitation Tournament for four consecutive years from 1989 to 1992.\nPart of the SIU Saluki men's basketball team's 2003 season was chronicled in MTV's \"True Life: I Am A College Baller\".\nThe Saluki men's basketball team garnered national attention by advancing to the Sweet Sixteen in 2002 and 2007.\nIn the 2006–2007 season, the Salukis, coached by Chris Lowery, reached their highest ranking in the AP Coaches Poll and the ESPN/USA Today Poll with a position of #11, before dropping to #14 after losing the MVC to Creighton prior to entering the NCAA tournament.\nAfter achieving success at SIU, former coaches Bruce Weber and Matt Painter accepted head coaching positions at schools in the Big Ten. Weber took over at Illinois in 2003 and Painter – an alumnus of and former basketball player at Purdue University – accepted the Boilermakers' offer to become top assistant and designated successor to Gene Keady in 2004, becoming head coach in March 2005.\nPrior to the 2018-2019 season, the Salukis became the first NCAA men's basketball team to win a completed game against the Cuban national team during a pre-season visit to the country.\nNine Salukis have gone on to play in the NBA:\nChico Vaughn - St. Louis Hawks (1963–66), Detroit Pistons (1966-67)&lt;br&gt;\nWalt Frazier - New York Knicks (1968–77), Cleveland Cavaliers (1978–80)&lt;br&gt;\nDick Garrett - Los Angeles Lakers (1970), Buffalo Braves (1971-73), New York Knicks (1974), Milwaukee Bucks (1974)&lt;br&gt;\nNate Hawthorne - Los Angeles Lakers (1974), Phoenix Suns (1975–76)&lt;br&gt;\nJoe C.

        "title": "Fairfield Stags men's lacrosse",
        "text": "The Fairfield Stags men's lacrosse team represents Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut and competes in the Colonial Athletic Association of NCAA Division I. The Stags have won eight regular season conference titles since 1996 and competed in the NCAA Division I men's lacrosse tournament in 2002 and 2005. The Stags play their home games at the new lacrosse-only Rafferty Stadium.\nHistory.\nAs a Jesuit university, Fairfield shares a unique historical connection to the discovery of modern-day lacrosse. Jesuit missionaries first witnessed the game of \"baggataway\" being played amongst Native Americans during the 17th century. According to histories of the game, it was Saint John de Brebeuf S.J., a French Jesuit missionary in Canada, who named the present-day version of the Indian game \"lacrosse\" because the stick used reminded him of a bishop's crosier, pronounced \"la crosse\" in French. Saint John de Brebeuf, S.J. is memorialized at Fairfield University with the #1 de Brebeuf Townhouse Unit named in his honor.\nDawn of the Stags.\nThe Fairfield Stags men's lacrosse program first began in 1973 as a club team. Future Fairfield University Athletic Hall of Famer Will Mraz was a founding member and the offensive leader of the inaugural club team. The first coach of the Fairfield University Lacrosse Club was Ken Gilstein, Cornell '70, who coached the team during the 1972, 1973, 1976 and 1977 seasons. It was led by standout players Bob Rupp, and John Hughes in the 70s and John Callegari, future Fairfield University Athletic Hall of Famer Hugh \"Skeets\" Coyle, Joe Sargent, Mike Hone, Kevin Kuryla and Rich MacDonough in the 80s, the club team established itself as amongst the best in New England. In 1987, the team had an undefeated 11-0 season and won the New England Club Championship.\nRed Stags rising.\nFairfield elevated the lacrosse program to NCAA Division I in 1993 with Tom McClelland at the helm. The Stags first victory as a varsity program came in its very first game with an 11-6 defeat of a visiting St. Joseph's team. In 1996, Ted Spencer took the helm and Fairfield became a founding member of an eight-team Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) lacrosse league. With Ted Spencer as coach, the team went undefeated in the first year of MAAC lacrosse league play followed by three consecutive league titles (1996, 1997 and 1998) and two ECAC tournament championships (1998 and 1999). In 2000, Fairfield became an independent program. In 2001, the university program joined the Great Western Lacrosse League (GWLL) paving the way for a new era in Stags lacrosse. Ted Spencer guided the Stags to great success on the national stage including two NCAA Tournament appearances (2002 and 2005), two Great Western Lacrosse League Championships (2002 and 2005), and developed 2 All-Americans (C. J. Kemp and Greg Downing) along with 21 All-New England selections and 8 Academic All-New England selections.\nNCAA Tournament time.\nIn 2002, the Stags finished in first place in the GWLL and received the league's automatic bid to the 2002 NCAA tournament. Making the program's first postseason visit, the Stags fell to UMass in the first round. At the conclusion of the season, the Stags were selected as the winner of the Joseph (Frenchy) Julien Memorial Award for Sportsmanship.\nThe 2005 season will go down as one of the greatest in Fairfield history with the Stags' finishing as the 15th ranked team in the nation. Not one for dramatics, the Stags won the Great Western Lacrosse League and earned a trip to the 2005 NCAA Tournament with a dramatic victory over then 12th ranked Denver in the last game of the season. In the 1st round of the 2005 NCAA Tournament, the Stags fell to eventual 2005 National Finalist, Duke.\nThe Stags first official season as a member of the ECAC Lacrosse League in 2006 proved a successful one with Stags posting a winning league record. Major victories included wins over Harvard and then 16th ranked Loyola. The victory over Loyola marked the program's first win over the Greyhounds and included the now infamous hidden ball goal.\nCopelan era.\nAndrew Copelan became the third head coach in the history of the program on August 25, 2008. On April 21, 2013, men's lacrosse set the school record for the defeat of the highest ranked opponent when the Stags upset the then no. 1 nationally ranked Denver Pioneers 9-8. The previous record was set on March 13, 2010, when the Stags upset the then no. 3 nationally ranked (and eventual 2010 NCAA tournament runner-up) Notre Dame Fighting Irish 10–8 while competing in the inaugural 'Beating Cancer With A Stick Classic' at The Kinkaid School in Houston, Texas. During the 2015 season, the Stags achieved a number of firsts in dedicating the program's new state-of-the-art lacrosse only Rafferty Stadium and winning the Regular Season Title during its inaugural season in the Colonial Athletic Association.\nStags in the MLL.\nTwelve Stags have been drafted by Major League Lacrosse and one by the National Lacrosse League. Peter Vlahakis is the leading face-off man in MLL history holding four MLL All-Time face-off records and was selected to the 2007 and 2008 MLL All-Star Game. Greg Downing was the sixth overall pick in the 2007 MLL Collegiate Draft and was selected to the 2008 MLL All-Star Game. The following Stag players were selected in the Major League Lacrosse draft:"

        "title": "Xavier Musketeers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Xavier Musketeers men's basketball team represents Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio. The school's team currently competes in the Big East Conference, and are coached by Sean Miller. Xavier has appeared in the NCAA tournament 29 times, 16 times in the 18 tournaments between 2001 and 2018. On March 11, 2018, Xavier earned its first ever No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Xavier is also a two-time winner of the NIT, with their most recent championship coming in 2022.\nXavier won four Atlantic 10 tournament championships (1998, 2002, 2004 and 2006). Xavier has won or shared 17 regular season conference championships, while winning 9 conference tournament championships. In addition, they have won one Big East Conference regular season title in 2018. They made the 2023 Big East Championship but lost to the Marquette Golden Eagles.\nXavier has been listed among the top-20 most valuable college basketball teams.\nHistory.\nThe first Xavier basketball game on record was February 20, 1920 at the Fenwick Club in Cincinnati. Coached by Joe Meyer, the Musketeers compiled a 94–52 record during Meyer's's 13-year run as head coach from 1920 to 1933. The Musketeer's success continued under second head coach Clem Crowe. During Crowe's 10 years as Xavier head coach, Xavier compiled a record of 96–78. Crowe's 96 wins as a head coach rank fourth all-time among Xavier head coaches.\nFollowing the 1942–43 season, play was suspended for the following two seasons because of World War II. In 1945, the program resumed under the leadership of head coach Ed Burns. In his one season as head coach, Burns compiled a record of 3–16.\nIn 1946, Burns was replaced by Lew Hirt. Under Hirt, the Musketeers first postseason appearance was in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) during the 1948 NAIA National Basketball tournament, the national tournament for small colleges. Xavier finished in 4th place, losing to Hamline University in the national third-place game, 58–59. 1948 was the only year Xavier appeared in the NAIA tournament.\nIn 1951, Hirt was replaced as head coach by Ned Wulk. Wulk guided the Musketeers to National Invitational Tournament appearances in 1956 and 1957. The 1956 appearance marked Xavier's first NIT win, an 84–80 victory over Saint Louis.\nAfter a loss to Bradley in the 1957 NIT, Wulk was replaced as head coach by Jim McCafferty. McCafferty led the Musketeers back to a third straight NIT in 1958. With wins over Niagara, Bradley, St. Bonaventure and Dayton, Xavier captured the NIT. According to most college basketball historians, the NIT was the elite post season tournament until the NCAA overtook it in the early 1960s. That was the first postseason championship won by any Ohio Division I school.\nIn 1961, McCafferty led Xavier to their first appearance in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. On March 14, 1961, Xavier fell to Morehead State at the Kentucky State Fairgrounds in Louisville, Kentucky.\nMcCafferty was replaced as head coach in 1963. He would be followed by Don Ruberg (1963–67), George Krajack (1967–71), Dick Campbell (1971–73) and Tay Baker (1973–79).\nIn 1979, Xavier was one of the charter members of the Midwestern City Conference (nicknamed the MCC or Midwestern City 6, and now known as the Horizon League), which also included Butler, Evansville, Loyola (Chicago), Oklahoma City, and Oral Roberts. That year also marked the hiring of head coach Bob Staak, who compiled an 88–86 record during his six seasons as head coach, including a return to both the NCAA Tournament and NIT.\nPete Gillen era.\n1985 once again marked considerable change for the program. In addition to the hiring of head coach Pete Gillen, the Midwestern City Conference altered its name slightly to the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, adding more teams including Detroit, Notre Dame (excluding men's basketball and football), Saint Louis, Marquette and Dayton. The MCC is the predecessor to the present-day Horizon League. Xavier was a member of the MCC from 1979 to 1995 and won eight regular season and six conference tournament championships.\nFrom 1985 to 1994, Gillen compiled a 202–75 record, including the program's first five wins in the NCAA Tournament. The Musketeers advanced to the NCAA Tournament in seven of Gillen's nine years at the helm. In 1990, Xavier beat Kansas State and future Big East colleagues Georgetown to advance to the program's first Sweet Sixteen.\nSkip Prosser era.\nSkip Prosser was hired in the spring of 1994 to replace departed head coach Pete Gillen. In his seven seasons as head coach, Prosser compiled a 148–65 record with four NCAA tournament appearances. Prosser's 148 wins are third all-time at Xavier. During his time at Xavier, Prosser continued to build on the momentum Gillen had created. Early in his tenure, Prosser added recruits Gary Lumpkin, Darnell Williams, Lenny Brown and James Posey. Those four players provided the core of Prosser's success during his time at Xavier. After missing the NCAA Tournament in both 1999 and 2000, Xavier returned to the tournament in 2001. Following a loss to Notre Dame in the tournament's first round, Prosser accepted the position of head coach at Wake Forest.\nThad Matta era.\nThad Matta left alma mater Butler to replace Skip Prosser as Xavier's head coach in 2001. Hired with only one year of head coaching experience, Matta inherited a talented core of players in David West, Lionel Chalmers, and Romain Sato. During his three years at the helm, Matta compiled a record of 78–23, with three straight NCAA tournament appearances and Xavier's first appearance in the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight. Matta won two Atlantic 10 regular-season championships in his first two years behind the play of National Player of the Year David West. Following Matta's second year, West was drafted in the first round of the 2003 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets. With West's departure, seniors Lionel Chalmers, Romain Sato and Anthony Myles became the team's cornerstone for the 2003–04 season. After a 10–9 start, Xavier closed the season by winning 16 of its last 18 games. \"The Run\", as it became known, left Xavier 3 points shy of making the program's first NCAA Final Four appearance.\nSean Miller era.\nThe summer following Xavier's first Elite Eight appearance, Matta was offered and accepted the position of head men's basketball coach at Ohio State. Xavier Athletic Director, Dawn Rogers, quickly promoted Xavier Associate Head Coach Sean Miller. From 2004 to 2009, Miller compiled a record of 120–47. Advancing to the NCAA Tournament in four of his five seasons as head coach, Miller led the Musketeers to another Elite Eight appearance in 2008 and a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 2009. During Miller's tenure as head coach, Xavier continued to shed the \"mid-major\" label and separate itself as one of the country's premier college basketball programs. Miller's NCAA Tournament success, aggressive non-conference scheduling and national recruiting allowed Xavier to be recognized with the likes of Memphis and Gonzaga as one of the premier basketball programs. After turning away interest from many programs, Sean Miller left Xavier to become the head basketball coach at Arizona.\nChris Mack era.\nOn April 15, 2009, Xavier's Athletic Director named Xavier Assistant Coach Chris Mack as the 17th head basketball coach in the program's history. A Cincinnati native and Xavier graduate, Mack compiled a record of 26–9 in his first year as head coach. Behind the play of 2010 NBA draft pick Jordan Crawford, Xavier advanced to the NCAA Tournament's Sweet Sixteen for a third straight season. Chris Mack, the 2009–10 Basketball Times Rookie Coach of the Year, was the first Xavier head coach to lead the Musketeers to the Sweet Sixteen in his first season at the helm. With a 14–2 record in Atlantic 10 play, Xavier also won a share of their fourth straight conference championship.\nFinishing with a 24–8 overall record including a 15–1 record in the A-10, Mack lead the Musketeers to a fifth consecutive A-10 title and another NCAA tournament berth in 2010–11.\nIn a 2011–12 season filled with highs and lows. The early season was marred by the Crosstown Shootout brawl in their yearly rivalry game against Cincinnati. The Musketeers had reached as high as #8 in the AP Poll before numerous suspensions from the Crosstown Shootout brawl lead to the team losing 5 of their next 6 games. Xavier rebounded from this ugly incident and reached Mack's second Sweet Sixteen.\nIn 2013, Xavier joined the newly reconstituted Big East Conference following Big East conference realignment. Xavier became one of the new members of the new 10-team Big East with the \"Catholic 7\" (DePaul, Georgetown, Marquette, Providence, Seton Hall, St. John's, and Villanova) plus Butler and Creighton. Xavier finished their first season in the Big East with a record of 21–13, 10–8 to finish Big East play in a tie for third place. They received a bid to the NCAA tournament, but lost in the First Round (First Four).\nThe 2014–15 season also saw a return to the Sweet Sixteen for the Musketeers. From 2008 to 2015, Xavier made five Sweet Sixteens, tied for third in the nation with Wisconsin over that span behind only Louisville and Michigan State. The 2015–16 team finished second in the Big East to Villanova, Xavier's highest finish in the Big East, and advanced to the Second Round of the NCAA tournament.\nIn 2017, Mack led Xavier to a 24–14 season and got the 11th seed in the West and advanced to the Elite Eight by defeating 6th seed Maryland, 3rd seed Florida State, and 2nd seed Arizona. In the Elite Eight they lost to Gonzaga.\nMack's 215 wins concluding the 2017–18 season placed him first in all-time wins in Xavier history.\nTravis Steele era.\nOn March 27, 2018, Mack was named the head coach at the University of Louisville. Four days after Mack left Xavier for Louisville, longtime Xavier assistant coach Travis Steele was named head coach of the Musketeers. Despite success against rival Cincinnati, Steele was criticized for his inability to lead the Musketeers to the NCAA Tournament. After missing the tournament for the fourth consecutive year, Steele was fired on March 16, 2022.\n2nd Sean Miller era.\nOnly three days after the firing of Travis Steele, Xavier hired former head coach Sean Miller as his replacement. During the period in between Steele’s exit and Miller’s full installation as head coach, Jonas Hayes served as interim. Hayes would lead the Musketeers to their second-ever NIT Championship.\nIn his first season back at Xavier, Miller led the team to a 27-10 record, earning a berth in the NCAA Tournament as a 3 seed, where they would be eliminated in the Sweet 16 by Texas.\nHome courts.\nCintas Center.\nXavier currently plays its home games at the Cintas Center, a 10,224 seat multi-purpose arena that opened in 2000. The Cintas Center is the fifth different home site in program history.\nAt Cintas Center, Xavier enjoys one of the nation's best home court advantages. As of April 2018 the Musketeers have compiled a 258–41 (an .863 winning percentage) record since moving to its on-campus home in 2000. Xavier enjoyed a 15–0 mark at home during the 2009–10, its only perfect record for a season at Cintas Center. During the 2017–2018 season, the Musketeers set a Cintas Center record with 17 home victories. The building was named the #3 \"Toughest Place to Play\" on EA Sports' NCAA Basketball '10. In August 2018 the NCAA named it as the 8th toughest home court in college basketball.\nThrough the 2018–2019 season, Cintas Center has hosted 3,011,308 fans for Xavier home games and the Musketeers have averaged 10,071 fans (better than 98% capacity) per game during that time. The 2017–2018 season marked the highest average attendance in Cintas Center history with an average 10,475 (over 102% capacity) Musketeer fans at each home game.\nCincinnati Gardens.\nThe Musketeers played their final season at Cincinnati Gardens in 1999–2000. Located 2 miles from the Xavier campus, the Gardens was the home court for the Xavier Musketeers since 1983–84 season.\nThe Xavier men's team played all of its regular season games off campus at the Cincinnati Gardens for 17 years, beginning with the 1983–84 season and ending with an NIT game against Marquette in the 1999–2000 season. The only exception was a game against Florida International that was played at Schmidt Fieldhouse on January 9, 1988.\nXavier compiled an impressive 215–25 (.896) record after moving to the Gardens in the 1983–84 season, including 14–1 in its final season.\nSchmidt Fieldhouse.\nPrior to moving to the Cincinnati Gardens in the 1983–84 season, Xavier called Schmidt Fieldhouse home. Located on the west side of the Xavier Campus, Xavier compiled an impressive 326–129 (.716) record at the Fieldhouse.\nUntil opening Cintas Center, the men's basketball team had only played one regular season game on campus since early in the 1983–84 season. Xavier scored a school-record point total in a 125–84 win over Florida International on Saturday, January 9, 1988.\nOther home courts.\nThe Musketeers have also used Riverfront Coliseum and the Fenwick Club.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Musketeers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 29 times.

James Hoff has also had a \"jersey\" retired in memory of all that he contributed to the school and basketball program. This was unveiled before a 2004 meeting with Creighton, where Hoff was vice president of university relations and President of the Creighton Foundation. Fr. Hoff died from cancer in 2004.\nBasketball and academics.\nNCAA academic progress rate.\nIn May 2010, the NCAA honored a school-record tying eight Xavier University athletic programs with Public Recognition Awards for academic excellence. The award is given to the top-ten percent of teams in each sport based on the NCAA Academic Progress Rate. The APR is a term-by-term progress for every student-athlete in Division I athletics. Out of the 65 teams to make the 2010 NCAA tournament Xavier had the 11th highest Academic Progress Rate.\nGraduation.\nSince 1986, Xavier has graduated every men's basketball player that has exhausted his eligibility.\nSister Rose Ann Fleming.\nDuring the 2010 NCAA tournament Xavier's Academic Advisor Sister Rose Ann Fleming garnered considerable national attention for the role she has played in the program's academic success.

        "title": "Steve Morrison (American football)",
        "text": "Steven Craig Morrison (born December 28, 1971) is a retired professional American football linebacker who played for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL) from 1995 to 1998. He is currently the associate head coach/linebackers coach at Bowling Green Falcons football. He previously served as the linebackers coach for the Eastern Michigan Eagles football team, on the coaching staff at Western Michigan, and as the linebackers coach at Syracuse Orange football. Prior to these professional experiences, he had excelled in college football as an All-Big Ten Conference inside linebacker from 1990 to 1994 for the Michigan Wolverines, whom he served as captain. In high school, he had been a \"Detroit Free Press\" first-team All-State (Michigan) and second-team All-Midwest selection in football and an All-American in lacrosse.\nAfter retiring from professional football as a player, he gained his first two years of coaching experience as the defensive coordinator for Michigan High School Athletic Association football champion Brother Rice High School (his high school alma mater). He then served as an assistant coach at the University of Michigan for three years. He then assumed a role as an assistant at Western Michigan University. At Western Michigan, he has served as the linebacker coach after spending a year as the defensive line coach. The 2009 Western Michigan Broncos season marked Morrison's fifth season on the team's staff, his fourth as linebacker coach and his second as defensive coordinator. He then went on to serve as the linebackers coach at Eastern Michigan and Syracuse. In 2019, he was hired as the associate head coach/ linebackers coach at Bowling Green State University. After the conclusion of the 2022 season, Morrison was promoted to defensive coordinator.\nEarly years.\nBarbara Morrison, Steve's mother, says Steve was read his last rites on the day of his birth because he had the same lung disease that Patrick Kennedy, the son of United States President John F. Kennedy, died from. He was then put in an incubator where his mother could not touch him for 12 months. Morrison wanted to be a linebacker because of the tenacity of the position. His favorite book was a book about Jack Lambert and Jack Ham and he grew up a Pittsburgh Steelers fan. He played soccer when he was a youth.\nHigh school.\nMorrison competed for Brother Rice High School of the Detroit, Michigan Catholic High School League. As a junior who played both fullback and linebacker, he was sidelined for the remainder of the season with a knee injury in his third game, but the team went 7–2 for the season despite his injury. As a senior, Morrison was part of a 1989 team that lost in the Class A semifinals 6–0 to Martin Luther King High School at Atwood Stadium. The team had been ranked as the number three high school team in the Metro Detroit Area by the \"Detroit Free Press\" in its pre-season poll. Morrison had been hailed as a blue chip athlete entering his senior season in the same pre-season summary. The team was 11–0 and the number one ranked area high school team prior to the loss. Once, Morrison executed an 82-yard punt during a high school game. During his senior season, his coach, Al Fracassa, was the \"Detroit Free Press\" Coach of the Year and Morrison was a First-Team All-Metro Detroit selection at linebacker. However, fellow fullback/linebacker two-way Detroit area player Jerome Bettis was the first team fullback. Both players earned first-team \"Detroit Free Press\" All-State honors. However, a poll of 14 experts selected Bettis first-team all-Midwest (Big Ten States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin because Penn State had not yet joined the conference), but only selected Morrison second-team all Midwest. In high school, Morrison was an All-American in lacrosse, along with Brother Rice and Michigan football teammate Gannon Dudlar. He was a Catholic High School League Hall of Fame athlete and was inducted in the 1995 Hall of Fame class that included Shawn Respert, among others.\nCollege.\nAfter attending Brother Rice High School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, his college decision eventually came down to a choice between Michigan and Michigan State University. He was part of a highly touted Michigan recruiting class that was ranked fourth in the nation and that included five of the top twelve players in the state and seven of the top twelve regional players. He spent five years at the University of Michigan where he anchored the defense as an inside linebacker. In 1990, he was the first true freshman to start on defense since 1987. In his 1991 debut for Michigan against the Boston College Eagles, he opposed former Brother Rice teammate Pete Mitchell, who was appearing in his first game. On Mitchell's first career catch, Morrison was warned for making a late hit against Mitchell. A total of seven Brother Rice alumni played in the game. He became a rare five-year varsity letter winner while wearing #36 for the Michigan Wolverines football program from 1990 to 1994, He was mentored by 1991 Butkus Award winner Erick Anderson. He helped the 1990 three-peat Big Ten Conference Champions defend their title for a total of five consecutive conference championships ending in 1992. The 1991 and 1992 teams went to the Rose Bowl. During the 1992 season, he replaced Anderson, who had led Michigan in tackles four consecutive seasons, as the defensive signal caller. He was named the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week after making 15 tackles against Purdue Boilermakers on October 31, 1992. He was named the 1992 winner of The Roger Zatkoff Award as the team's best linebacker.\nHe became team captain in 1994 for coach Gary Moeller. On a team that had two All-Americans (Ty Law and Remy Hamilton), he was one of six All-Big Ten players (Law, Hamilton, Tyrone Wheatley, Amani Toomer and Jason Horn) and a Butkus Award semifinalist. Morrison earned his bachelor's degree in sports management and communications in 1994 from Michigan.\nAt the time of his graduation, he ranked third in career tackles in school history, behind Anderson and Ron Simpkins. He has since been passed by Jarrett Irons and Sam Sword, and he stands fifth with 220 tackles. In terms of tackles and assists combined, Morrison once totaled 23 in a November 14, 1992 game against the Illinois Fighting Illini football team, which stands as a Michigan Football record for a game at Michigan Stadium. Morrison suffered compartmental syndrome in his calf, which necessitated surgical repair to stop internal bleeding, during his 1990 freshman season, for which he earned a medical redshirt season by the NCAA. As a sophomore (redshirt freshman), he sat out four games with a broken leg. In 1993, he missed the first seven games with a broken foot.\nProfessional career.\nNFL.\nHe was not drafted in the 1995 NFL draft, but signed with the Indianapolis Colts as a free agent after the draft. He played with the Colts from 1995 to 1998. He accumulated 2 quarterback sacks, 2 interceptions, and 4 fumble recoveries. Although the Colts best records during his tenure was 9–7 in both 1995 and 1996, the team made the playoffs twice and Morrison had a chance to play in an American Football Conference Championship game. During the 1995–1996 NFL playoffs, the Colts won two playoff games on the road under Ted Marchibroda to reach the championship game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Despite the playoff success, they changed coaches, as Lindy Infante took them back to the 1996–1997 NFL playoffs with a 9–7 record, only to fall in the wild card game to the Steelers again. Morrison started 31 games over the course of his career, including 29 regular season games. In 1997 and 1998, the team had losing seasons, although Morrison started more games as his career progressed. Morrison was signed by the Detroit Lions for the 1999 NFL season, but he was waived before the season started.\nEarly coaching experience.\nHe served as the defensive coordinator for his high school alma mater, Brother Rice Warriors, in 2000 and 2001. In 2000, they won the Michigan High School Athletic Association Division 2 football championship. He was a member of the coaching staff, when his high school coach Fracassa became the winningest coach in Michigan High School football history. From 2002 to 2004 he served in various capacities on the defensive coaching staff for the Michigan Wolverines. In 2002, he served as the video assistant. In 2003, he became a graduate assistant/outside linebackers coach.\nWestern Michigan (2005–2009).\nIn 2005, he took the Western Michigan defensive line coaching position on new head coach Bill Cubit's staff. That same year, Scott Shafer assumed the defensive coordinator position at Western Michigan, and Morrison served under him. Then, in 2006, Morrison assumed the linebacker coach position. The defense immediately produced results: #1 in the country in interceptions, #1 in sacks per game, and a Mid-American Conference record rushing yards per game defense. In addition to the team numbers he fostered Ameer Ismail, the nation's leader in quarterback sacks and tackles for a loss.\nOn March 12, 2008, after defensive coordinator Bill Miller left to be the Louisville Cardinals football linebacker coach, Western Michigan promoted Morrison to defensive coordinator, and he relinquished his recruiting coordinator role to tight ends coach Jake Moreland. He continued to serve as the linebackers coach in 2008. He converted the defensive scheme from a two-gap scheme to a one-gap scheme upon taking over as defensive coordinator. His coaching style is considered a compromise between styles of the previous coordinators: the highly enthusiastic Shafer style and the laid back Miller style. The 2008 Western Michigan Broncos football team compiled a 9–3 (6–2 conference) record earning them a trip to the 2008 Texas Bowl to face the Rice Owls. His defense ranked toward the middle of the MAC. Rice blew out Western Michigan by taking a 38–0 lead before allowing two late fourth quarter touchdowns for a 38–14 final score. On the eve of the Bowl game, the Broncos signed head coach Cubit to a five-year extension and there was no indication he intended to make any changes in his staff. Morrison's 2008 defense produced first-team All-MAC selection Louis Delmas, who appeared in the January 24, 2009 Senior Bowl and was the first safety chosen in the 2009 NFL Draft. After a disappointing 2009 Western Michigan season in which WMU ranked 102 out of 120 Division I teams, Morrison was fired and replaced by former Hofstra coach Dave Cohen.\nEastern Michigan (2010–2011).\nMorrison served as the linebackers coach for Eastern Michigan University under head coach Ron English and defensive coordinator Phil Snow. The 2010 Eagles posted a 2–10 record.\nSyracuse (2012–2013).\nIn January 2012, Steve Morrison joined the Syracuse Orangemen football team staff as the linebackers coach, reuniting with his former Western Michigan defensive coordinator, Scott Schafer, the defensive coordinator for the Syracuse Orangemen. He also joined former Michigan teammate Tyrone Wheatley on the coaching staff. In January 2013, Morrison left the team for \"personal reasons\".\nBowling Green (2019–).\nMorrison was hired by former Michigan teammate Scot Loeffler to be his associate head coach and linebackers coach for the Bowling Green Falcons football.\nFamily.\nIn college, Morrison's family hosted various teammates such as Todd Collins at Christmas time. This is part of a Michigan football tradition that when the team is playing late season Bowl games, the players from outside the Midwest spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day morning with local families. Morrison is married to former University of Michigan softball captain Mary Campana. The couple had their third child on May 23, 2007. They now have three sons: Alexander (8–29–01), Marco (11–18–04) and Roman (5–23–07)."

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1995 introduced a system of multiple classified ballots for consideration by the Veterans Committee. That group met in closed sessions as usual and selected four people:\nRichie Ashburn, Leon Day, William Hulbert, and Vic Willis. Day and Hulbert were named from the new ballots for Negro leagues and 19th century figures.\nThe Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail, per their usual process, to select from recent major league players; they elected Mike Schmidt. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 30, 1995.\nThe BBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1975 or later, but not after 1989; the ballot included candidates from the 1994 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1990. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted of 39 players; a total of 460 ballots were cast, with 345 votes required for election. A total of 2,829 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.15 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote (23 votes) will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The one candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The 14 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nThurman Munson was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly-eligible players included 24 All-Stars, eleven of whom were not included on the ballot, representing a total of 67 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 12-time All-Star Mike Schmidt, 8-time All-Star Jim Rice and 5-time All-Star Buddy Bell. The field included three MVPs (Schmidt, Rice and Willie Hernández) and one Cy Young Award winner (Hernández).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Luis Aguayo, Neil Allen, Tony Armas, Alan Ashby, Bruce Benedict, Mike Davis, Bob Dernier, Bo Díaz, Leon Durham, Tim Flannery, Damaso Garcia, Jerry Hairston, Sr., Glenn Hubbard, Lee Mazzilli, Keith Moreland, Dwayne Murphy, David Palmer, Shane Rawley, Craig Reynolds, Harry Spilman, Bob Stanley, Tim Stoddard, Steve Trout, Ron Washington, and Joel Youngblood.\nIn addition to Schmidt, Phillies broadcaster and former center fielder Richie Ashburn was inducted to the hall by the Veteran's Committee. Phillie fans were elated over the results, and came to Cooperstown that July in droves.\nThe Veterans Committee.\nThe Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to elect as many as two executives, managers, umpires, and older major league players—the categories considered in all its meetings since 1953. By a new arrangement it separately considered candidates from the Negro leagues and from the 19th century with authority to select one from each of those two special ballots.\nThe committee elected four people, the maximum number permitted:\ncenter fielder Richie Ashburn from the 1950s, pitcher Vic Willis from the 1900s, pitcher Leon Day from the Negro leagues, and from the 19th century William Hulbert, the founder and second president of the National League.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThere was no Spink Award to a baseball writer in 1995 (none voted at the December 1994 meeting at the BBWAA).\nFord C. Frick Award.\nBob Wolff\nreceived the Ford C. Frick Award honoring a baseball broadcaster."

In , when he was 23, he broke into the Major Leagues on May 8 with the New York Yankees. He was mainly a relief pitcher, although started two games (out of 22 pitched in all). He was 4-2 with a 3.97 ERA.\nThe next two years Murray spent with the Boston Red Sox On January 30, 1923, Murray was traded to the Red Sox with Camp Skinner and Norm McMillan for star pitcher Herb Pennock and $50,000. In , nearly half of the games he pitched in he started; however, he did worse than he did the year before, going 7-11 with a 4.91 earned run average. His seven wins that season were a career high, though.\nIn 1924, Murray went back to mainly relief pitching, and did even worse than he did the previous two years. He finished with a record of 2-9 and an earned run average of 6.72; he had one of the worst seasons out of all of the pitchers on the team.\nThat was the final year he played with the Red Sox. He did not play at all in , and went with the Washington Senators in 1926. He was converted to a starting pitcher, didn't pitch as much, but still had the second best season of his career (behind his rookie season). He finished at 6-3 with a mediocre 5.63 ERA. In twelve games pitched he only gave up one home run, very good for a pitcher.\nMurray pitched 1927 with the Senators as well. His amount of pitching time continued to decline, and it turned out that 1926 was his final season as a starting pitcher; 1927 was spent as a little-used relief man.\nMurray did not pitch at all for the next five years. He made a comeback with the Chicago White Sox in 1933, but only pitched two games. His final game was played May 1 of that year, and at age 34, that marked the end of his Major League career.\nMurray died on October 18, 1955, in Memphis, Tennessee.

He spent 3 seasons in the National Hockey League with the Vancouver Canucks between 1981 and 1984, and spent the majority of his career with Modo Hockey in the Swedish Elitserien. Many of his finest accomplishments came for Team Sweden in international play, as he helped his country to several medal finishes at both the Winter Olympics and World Championships during the 1980s.\nPlaying career.\nA skilled playmaking forward who was strong on both the powerplay and penalty kill, Molin broke into the Modo senior squad in 1974–75 at the age of 18. Over the next few seasons, he emerged as one of the club's top two-way players, culminating in his selection to play for Sweden at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. At the Olympics, he was one of Sweden's top players, scoring 7 points in 7 games to help the team to a bronze medal. After another strong season with Modo the following year, Molin was signed by the Vancouver Canucks in 1981 to try his luck in the NHL, joining former Modo teammates Thomas Gradin and Lars Lindgren who were already established at the club.\nFresh off representing Sweden in the 1981 Canada Cup, Molin had a strong rookie season in Vancouver in 1981–82, scoring 15 goals and 46 points in 72 games to finish 6th in club scoring. In the playoffs, he fared even better, notching 11 points in 17 games in helping the Canucks in their run to the Stanley Cup finals.\nMolin continued his solid play the following year, notching 12 goals and 39 points in 58 games. However, by 1983–84, he had become a fringe member of the squad and slumped to 6 goals and 13 points in only 42 appearances.\nHis NHL options at an end, Molin returned to Modo for 1984–85, and turned in the highest-scoring season of his Swedish league career, posting 57 points in just 32 games. He continued his strong play with the club for the next few seasons, and experienced another career highlight when he helped Sweden to a Gold Medal performance at the 1987 World Championships.

        "title": "1954 Milan High School basketball team",
        "text": "The 1954 Milan High School Indians won the Indiana High School Boys Basketball Tournament championship in 1954.\nWith an enrollment of only 161, Milan was the smallest school ever to win a single-class state basketball title in Indiana, beating the team from the much larger Muncie Central High School in a classic competition known as the Milan Miracle. The team and town are the inspiration for the 1986 film \"Hoosiers\". The team finished its regular season 19–2 and sported a 28–2 overall record.\nBackground.\nUnlike most states, Indiana held a single-class tournament in which all schools competed for the same championship in one of America's largest and most popular high school tournaments, until the separation into enrollment classes in 1997. Indiana still possessed a large rural population well into the 1950s and rural school consolidation was still in its infancy. As a result, most Indiana high schools of the era had what today are considered extremely small enrollments. Many of these small schools had realistic expectations of advancing several rounds into the tournament in that era, but they would almost inevitably fall in the regionals to urban schools from places such as South Bend, Evansville, Gary, Terre Haute, Muncie, Bloomington, Lafayette, Fort Wayne, Anderson and Indianapolis.\nCoach Marvin Wood had been hired two years earlier, at the age of 24, after a collegiate playing career at Butler University and a coaching stint in French Lick. His hiring was controversial, coming on the heels of Superintendent Willard Green's firing of coach Herman \"Snort\" Grinstead, who had ordered new uniforms without authorization. Wood's coaching style was the opposite of Grinstead's in many ways. He closed practice to outsiders, an act that removed one of the major forms of leisure time entertainment for the town's basketball-crazed population and angered many. He was impressed by the unusual scope of size and talent available in such a small school among the many boys trying out for the team, talent forged by a strong junior-high program. He taught them more patience than the run-and-gun Grinstead, culminating in a four-corner ball control offense he called the \"cat-and-mouse\".\nExpectations were higher in the 1952–1953 season. These were realized as the Indians won their first regional game in school history under questionable circumstances against Morton Memorial, an orphanage school outside of Knightstown. In that game, Morton Memorial held a nine-point lead late in the game, only to lose in double-overtime as Milan's fourth quarter comeback was aided when the timekeeper delayed restarting the clock by a few seconds on one occasion. Milan went on to shock the state by winning the 1953 regional title and sweeping the semi-state to advance to the final four, finally bowing out in a 56–37 semifinal blowout to the Bears of South Bend Central High School. The nucleus of that team returned for the 1953–54 season with expectations of tournament success unprecedented for such a small school.\nThe 1953–54 season.\nWith four starters returning from the semifinalists, Milan was considered a lock to win both the Ripley County tournament and the sectional. To prepare for the rigors of tournament play, Milan scheduled several games against larger, more prestigious schools, including a tournament at Frankfort, where they would suffer their first loss of the season, a 49–47 nail-biter against the hosts. Milan cruised through the rest of the schedule before suffering a late-season upset to Aurora, who were also coming into a successful period in their basketball history.\n1954 IHSAA Boys Basketball Tournament.\nAnticipating a run deep into the later rounds of the Indiana High School Athletic Association boys basketball tournament, Milan expected to easily take the sectional before facing a tough test in the regional and a possible rematch against Aurora.\nSectional at Versailles.\nMilan 83, Cross Plains 36\nMilan 57, Versailles 43\nMilan 44, Osgood 32\nRegional at Rushville.\nMilan 58, Rushville 34\nMilan 46, Aurora 38\nSemi-State at Butler Fieldhouse, Indianapolis.\nMilan 44, Montezuma 34\nMilan 65, Indianapolis Crispus Attucks 52\nState Finals at Butler Fieldhouse, Indianapolis.\nMilan 60, Terre Haute Gerstmeyer Tech 48\nMilan 32, Muncie Central 30\nThe Indiana High School Athletic Association broke a longstanding tradition and awarded the Trester Award for mental attitude, sportsmanship, and character to a member of the winning team, Bobby Plump.\nAftermath.\n40,000 people descended on Milan (population: 1,150) the next day as the team returned home from Indianapolis, lining State Road 101 for to congratulate the Indians.\nAs schools consolidated throughout Indiana, the days of small-town success gradually ended. Fewer than half of the 751 schools entered in the 1954 tournament exist today. With increased urbanization and suburbanization throughout the state, Indiana schools became much larger and the urban schools that had the most success in the tournament increased their domination of the tournament. No school with an enrollment less than five times that of Milan's ever won the tournament again under the one-class system that was replaced with a multi-class tournament in 1997. The smallest school to win the state tournament after Milan was Plymouth in 1982, led by future NBA star and coach Scott Skiles. Milan's enrollment is now over twice as large as it was in 1954.\nThirty-three years later, the film \"Hoosiers,\" a fictionalized account based on Milan's 1952–54 seasons, opened to positive reviews, renewing interest in the team and its legacy. The film combined game play from both the 1952–53 and 1953–54 seasons, merging the 1953 quarter-final opponent, the South Bend Bears, with the scoring pattern from the 1954 championship win against Muncie Central.\nThe 2010 run of Butler—a university team that to this day plays its home games in the same building that hosted Milan's historic victory—to the Final Four led to countless comparisons with both the 1954 Milan team and its cinematic alter ego of Hickory High. The Bulldogs stunned perennial power Michigan State 52–50 in the national semifinal to make it to the National Title Game, where they lost to Duke 61–59. (Butler forward Gordon Hayward narrowly missed a last-second half court shot that would have won the game, and the national championship, for Butler.) Appropriately, the Milan team, all but one of whom were alive at the time of the tournament, attended the Final Four (held just up the road at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis) as guests of Indiana governor Mitch Daniels."

        "text": "The Siena Saints men's basketball team (formerly the Siena Indians) represents Siena College in Loudonville, New York, United States. The NCAA Division I program competes in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and the annual Franciscan Cup.\nThe Saints are currently coached by Gerry McNamara. He replaced Carmen Maciariello who was fired on March 20, 2024 after 5 seasons.\nSiena plays its home games at the 14,500 all-seater MVP Arena in downtown Albany. Prior to joining a conference, Siena had success in the 1950s, winning the National Catholic Invitational Tournament in 1950 and finishing the 1950–51 season ranked 18th in the AP Poll. Since 1988, the team has appeared in six NCAA tournaments (1989, 1999, 2002, 2008, 2009 and 2010) and five National Invitation Tournaments (1988, 1991, 1994, 2000, and 2003). Siena has advanced to the Round of 32 three times in program history. In 1989 they defeated 3rd-seeded Stanford 80–78. In 2008 Siena beat 4th seeded Vanderbilt 83–62 and the following year they edged 8th seeded Ohio State 74–72 in double overtime.\nSiena has won six conference tournaments throughout program history. They won the 1989 title in the North Atlantic Conference, with a win over Boston University, famously played in front of no fans as a result of a measles outbreak. They have won five conference championships as a member of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. Their most recent championship came in 2020, when they won the MAAC regular season title, they were then awarded the conference's bid to the NCAA tournament when the MAAC tournament was cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2014 Siena competed in their first College Basketball Invitational tournament and won the championship defeating Stony Brook, Penn State, Illinois State and Fresno State two games to one in the best-of-three championship series. Siena's cumulative record in postseason play is 18–13 (4–6 NCAA, 9–5 NIT, 5–2 CBI). In 2020, the program was placed under a three-year probation by the NCAA over player benefit and coaching violations under head coach Jimmy Patsos.\nHistory.\n1989–2000.\nIn 1989, Siena stars Marc Brown and Steve McCoy led the school to a triumphant victory, an 80–78 win over third seeded Stanford in the NCAA Tournament. The 1993–1994 Saints finished 25–8 making all the way to the NIT final four at Madison Square Garden defeating such teams as Georgia Tech, Tulane, Bradley, and Kansas State. Siena's Doremus Bennerman capped his brilliant college career with a 51-point outburst against Kansas State, winning most outstanding player honors in the NIT.\nBrown (2,284) and Bennerman (2,109) are the only two men to score 2,000 points or more while at Siena.\nAfter coach Mike Deane (166–77 in 8 years at Siena) left to take the head coaching job at Marquette, Siena suffered through a terrible 22–59 three-year tenure under Bob Beyer, who was fired. Siena then hired Villanova assistant Paul Hewitt to resurrect the program. Hewitt did so leading the Saints to a 66–27 record during his three years, winning the MAAC tournament championship in 1999 and taking regular season crown in 2000. Hewitt would leave after the 1999–2000 season to take over at Georgia Tech.\n2000–04.\nLouis Orr coached the team for one season (20–11) before leaving for Seton Hall University. Siena then hired Rob Lanier, an assistant under Rick Barnes at University of Texas. In Lanier's first year Siena struggled through a brutal regular season going 12–18. However the team went on to win the MAAC championship on their home floor and become the first team since Bradley in 1955 to win an NCAA Tournament game with a losing record as they defeated Alcorn State 81–77 in the play in game. Siena would gain an NIT berth in 2003, going 21–11 and beating Big East member Providence along the way. They defeated Villanova and Western Michigan in the NIT before being eliminated by Alabama-Birmingham. Lanier's final two years brought much frustration among Siena fans. In 2003–04, Siena started off 3–0 only to lose their next 10 games and finish the season a disappointing 14–16. Lanier's final year saw an injury-plagued Siena team finish with a program worst 24 losses and he was fired after that season.\nCoach McCaffery.\n2005–06.\nFran McCaffery was hired to April 1, 2005 as the 14th coach in Siena history, the 8th at the Division 1 level. McCaffery inherited a team with only a handful of scholarship athletes because several players loyal to coach Lanier transferred to other programs, including Jack McClinton, who went on to earn first team all-ACC honors at the University of Miami. McCaffery's first recruit landed was Kenny Hasbrouck who would go on to score 1,918 points at Siena, earning MAAC Rookie of the Year, MAAC Player of the Year and Mid-Major Player of the Year honors along the way. Hasbrouck started all 128 of his games as a Saint and upon graduation became only the second Siena player to have his jersery retired.\nMcCaffery guided Siena to a 15–13 record despite being picked to finish last in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. Siena had memorable wins over cross-town rival Albany 82–74 in overtime, as well as an 82–76 triumph at eventual MAAC champion Iona. The Saints clinched a first round bye in the MAAC tournament with a thrilling 98–92 double overtime victory over Niagara on senior day. Siena's season ended with a heartbreaking 63–62 loss to St. Peter's in the MAAC quarterfinals.\n2006–07.\nThe Saints started slowly at 11–10 before winning 9 of 10 games to reach the MAAC championship game losing to Niagara 83–79. Siena finished at 20–12, winning 20 or more games for the fifth time in nine seasons. Once again Siena defeated Albany in another instant classic game 76–75 in double overtime. Siena was one of the youngest teams in the conference as five of their top eight players were underclassmen.\nFreshman Edwin Ubiles shared the Rookie of the Year award in the MAAC becoming the second player in as many years to win it for the Saints. Kenny Hasbrouck captured the honor in 2005–2006.\n2007–08.\nOn November 17 McCaffery guided Siena to a 79–67 win over #20 Stanford University in Albany, NY at the MVP Arena (formerly the Times Union Center). The victory was Siena's first over a ranked opponent since the 1989 NCAA tournament first round also against Stanford. Siena once again defeated Albany 75–71 for their sixth win in seven tries against the Great Danes since the series resumed. Siena dominated their Bracketbuster game against Boise State, another quality mid-major school. The Saints defeated Manhattan, Loyola College (MD), and Rider to win the MAAC tournament and clinch a bid in the NCAA Tournament.\nDuring Selection Sunday, the Saints received a #13 seed in the Midwest Region of the 2008 NCAA tournament. The Saints went on to upset the 4th seeded Vanderbilt Commodores in the first round of the tournament 83–62. The Saints were led by junior Kenny Hasbrouck who scored a team high 30 points. Senior guard Tay Fisher came off the bench to add 19 points on 6-for-6 shooting from 3-point range. The Saints never trailed in the contest and became the first MAAC team to advance since the 2004 tournament.\nIn the second round of the tournament, the Saints found themselves facing the #12 seed Villanova Wildcats on March 23, 2008. With 25 points from Scottie Reynolds and 20 points from Corey Stokes, the Wildcats cruised to an 84–72 victory over the Saints and Villanova advanced to the sweet sixteen.\nSiena was ranked 9th in the final mid-major poll on Collegeinsider.com.\n2008–09.\nSiena finished the 2008–09 season with a 23–7 regular season record. Quality wins from the Saints came in the opening game of the season against Boise State, who they beat by 30, an 18-point victory against Cornell (Ivy League Conference champions and a #14 seed in the 2008 NCAA tournament), and a 6-point victory against Northern Iowa (the Missouri Valley Conference Champions and a #12 seed) in the ESPN Bracketbusters game that wasn't as close as the score indicated. Siena finished a perfect 17–0 at MVP Arena.\nSiena's very tough non-conference schedule included losses to Tennessee (a #9 seed) by 14, Oklahoma State (a #8 seed) by 9, Pittsburgh (#1 seed) by 13, and Kansas (#3 seed) by 7. Siena's strong showings in these tough matchups earned Siena a well-deserved #9 seed. The Saints cruised through the MAAC Tournament to receive the automatic bid into the 2009 NCAA tournament for the second straight year. Siena was awarded a #9 seed in the Midwest region, where they drew #8 Ohio State in Dayton, Ohio. Siena defeated Ohio State 74–72 in a double overtime thriller with Ronald Moore making two late three point shots that earned fame for Bill Raftery’s “Onions, Double Order” call. Siena would go on to lose to the #1 seeded Louisville Cardinals in the second round 79–72 after taking a four-point lead with under 7 minutes left. They ended their season at 27–8.\nSiena finished #2 in the final mid-major poll behind only national powerhouse Gonzaga.\nSiena finished 28th in the final ESPN coaches poll the schools highest ever ranking. Siena also finished with an RPI of 19.\n2009–10.\nSiena entered the 2009-10 season with the highest expectations in program history. Another slow start put the Saints at 4–3 after a loss at Georgia Tech. Once again Siena made their move going 23–3 to capture their third straight MAAC championship and berth in the NCAA tournament. Siena defeated Fairfield 72–65 in the MAAC championship game in a heart-stopping finish in overtime after trailing by 13 points early in the second half. Alex Franklin was named MAAC tournament MVP in addition to winning the conference's player of the year award.\nSiena set a single season record for MAAC regular season wins (17). Despite dominating the MAAC (winning 44 of their last 47 conference games dating back to 2008) the Saints struggled in the second half losing road games to elite team such as Temple, Butler, Georgia Tech and Northern Iowa. Siena's late rally came up short against fourth seeded Purdue in a 72–64 loss in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Siena finished 27–7 the second straight season the school won 27 games.\nCoach Buonaguro.\n2010–13.\nLong time Siena assistant coach Mitch Buonaguro took over as head coach after McCaffery left for Iowa. The Saints struggled through a 13–18 season that ended with a 94–64 loss to Iona in the MAAC quarterfinals. Siena's marquee win was a 62–57 triumph over Georgia Tech at the MVP Arena.\nSiena finished 14–17 and 8–10 (6th in the MAAC). Despite a second straight losing season, Siena enjoyed a much more positive season after a struggling first year under Buonaguro. Because of injuries and NCAA ineligibility the Saints most of the season with only a 6-man rotation. Siena had solid wins over MAAC regular champion and NCAA tournament participant Iona (rallying from 20–2 down), Manhattan, Fairfield, Princeton and UAlbany. In the MAAC tournament, Siena beat Manhattan again 84–82 in overtime before falling to eventual tournament champion Loyola 70–60 in the MAAC semifinals. It was the 12th time in the last 15 seasons that Siena had at least made it to the conference semifinals.\nIn 2012–13 Siena struggled again and recorded three straight losing season for the first time since 1994–1997. The Saints finished the season at 8–24 and coach Mitch Buonaguro was fired.\nCoach Patsos.\n2013–18.\nOn April 3, 2013, Siena introduced Loyola coach Jimmy Patsos as the 16th head coach in Siena history. In his first year, Patsos guided the Saints to a 20–18 record (11–9 in MAAC conference play) and the program's first-ever postseason championship, winning the 2014 CBI tournament two games to one over Fresno State. The home portion of the three-game series was noteworthy; both games were played at the Alumni Recreation Center on the Siena campus as the MVP Arena was being used for another event.\nIn Summer 2015, it was announced that Siena would open up its 2015–16 season with away games against the defending Nation Champional Duke Blue Devils and the National runner-up Wisconsin Badgers. Although the odds were heavily in favor of Duke and Wisconsin winning these games, this announcement immediately created an enormous amount of hype around the Siena College campus and the MAAC Conference as a whole. This made the Saints the first Division 1 team to ever open the season against the defending National Champion and the National runner-up from the previous year.\nOn November 13, 2015, Siena played Duke at Cameroon Indoor Stadium, one of the most famous arenas in all of college basketball. The game was televised on ESPNU. Duke won the game by a score of 92–74.\nOn November 15, 2015, Siena traveled to Wisconsin to play the Badgers. Siena could not come back from a large first half deficit, as Wisconsin went on to win the game by a score of 92–65.\nSiena finished the season with a 21–13 record and third-place finish (13–7) in the MAAC. The Saints had quality wins over NIT participants Hofstra, St. Bonaventure and Bucknell as well as against crosstown rival UAlbany. Siena also defeated eventual MAAC champion Iona on the road 81–78. However, Siena lost to Iona 81–70 to end their MAAC tournament run in the semifinals. The Saints were invited to the CBI tournament where they lost to eventual runner-up Morehead State 84–80.\nOn April 13, 2018, Patsos resigned after 5 years at Siena, finishing with a 77–92 overall record with the Saints and following an internal investigation regarding financial troubles and abusive conduct within the program.\nPlayer benefits, coaching violations and sanctions.\nIn 2020 Siena vacated 46 wins from 2015 to 2018 under Patsos, was fined $5,000 by the NCAA, and was forced to remove stats for 28 players, in addition to being placed on probation for three years, as well as a show-cause order being placed on Patsos, after the NCAA found that Patsos provided impermissible benefits, including payments to players, while he was head coach of Siena. According to the NCAA investigation findings players were paid to athletes at least twice each academic year in the general ranges of $60 to $80 and $100 or more, in one instance Patsos allegedly provided a player with a small amount of cash during a meeting in the weight room that took place during the 2017–2018 season. The NCAA also found that Patsos also allowed a noncoaching staff member to engage in unallowed coaching activity, which caused the program to exceed NCAA limits on countable coaches and provided false or misleading information to the NCAA during the investigation about his involvement in the player benefits violation.\nCoach Christian.\n2018–19.\nOn May 2, 2018, Siena announced the hiring of Jamion Christian as the 17th head coach in the program's history. He came to Siena after 6 seasons as head coach of his alma mater Mount St. Mary's University. In his first season as head coach the Saints -who were picked to finish last in the preseason coaches poll- were able to post an 11–7 conference record and finish tied for 2nd in the regular season. Freshman Jalen Pickett was MAAC Rookie of the Week a record 11 times and Christian's squad set a new team record for three point field goals made in one season. They would receive the 5th seed in the MAAC Tournament and defeated unanimous preseason favorite Rider in the quarterfinals before falling to Iona in the semifinals. Christian's first season is widely regarded as the best ever for a Siena head coach in their first season, especially when considering expectations. On March 21, 2019, Christian announced he would leave Siena for the vacant head coaching position at George Washington.\nCoach Maciariello.\n2019–20.\nOn March 25, 2019, Carmen Maciariello was named the 18th head coach in Siena men's basketball history. \nIn Maciariello's first season, he led the Saints to a 2020 MAAC championship. Siena won the regular season title, finishing the season on a 10-game winning steak. After defeating Manhattan in the conference quarterfinals, the MAAC cancelled the tournament as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Saints were awarded their first NCAA tournament berth since 2010.\n2020–21.\nIn the 2020-21 season, shortened by COVID, the Saints only played MAAC games as nonconference games against Drexel and Towson were cancelled. Siena started off the regular season 6-0 but finished 6-4 for an overall and conference record of 12-4, good enough to secure the 1 seed in the 2021 MAAC Tournament at Jim Whelan Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, NJ. The Saints lost a 55-52 game against 9 seed and eventual MAAC champion Iona. Manny Camper won the MAAC Player of the Year award, making it two years in a row with the award being given to a Siena player (Jalen Pickett in 2020).\n2021–2022.\nIn the offseason, Siena lost their top three scorers from the previous season - Manny Camper went to the G-League, Jalen Pickett transferred to Penn State, and Jordan King transferred to Eastern Tennessee State. The Saints only had 3 returning players, while the rest of the roster was filled with transfers and freshmen. When the regular season started, Siena lost their first four games and 6 out of their first 8, including a loss to #23 St. Bonaventure in the Franciscan Cup. As conference play started, the Saints picked it up and finished with a 12-8 conference record which included impressive wins over MAAC regular season champions Iona at home and a sweep of eventual MAAC Tournament champions and Elite Eight appearers St. Peters. Siena earned the 3 seed in the 2022 MAAC Tournament but they fell 77-71 in the quarterfinals to 11 seed Quinnipiac. Siena ended the 2021-22 season with an overall record of 15-14.\n2022–23.\nSiena started off the 2022-23 season with wins at Holy Cross and over UAlbany in the return of the Albany Cup in a game where they trailed by nearly 20 points at the start of the second half. On November 24, Siena defeated Florida State 80-63 in the quarterfinals of the ESPN Events Invitational. The day after, they fell 62-74 to Ole Miss but bounced back to beat Seton Hall 60-55 in the 3rd place game. Later in the season, Siena defeated St. Bonaventure 76-70 to regain control of the Fransiscan Cup. Siena started conference play 9-2 including a 70-53 victory over eventual MAAC Champions Iona at MVP Arena, but the Saints lost 7 out of their last 9 and their last 5 games to finish with a conference record of 11-9, which was tied for 3rd in the MAAC (4 seed in the tournament due to tiebreaker). Siena fell in the MAAC quarterfinals for the 3rd year in a row with a 65-71 loss to 5 seed Niagara. Siena players Michael Eley (Rookie of the Year), Jackson Stormo (All-MAAC 2nd Team), and Javian McCollum (All-MAAC 3rd Team) received awards from the MAAC.\n2023–24.\nSiena went 4-28 the worst season the Saints have had in program history.\nSiena fired Maciariello after 5 seasons as head coach.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I.\nThe Saints have appeared in six NCAA Tournaments.

There were a total of 35 participating athletes, with three qualifying heats and the final held on 12 August 1983.\nSummary.\nOn a cold and rainy day, Tommy Ekblom sprinted off the line to take the early lead. Half a lap into the race he was almost 10 metres off the front absorbing the enthusiasm of the home crowd as the pack strung out behind him. Over the next two laps, Colin Reitz led the pack to pull back the lead as Ekblom's pace slowed on the second lap. Reitz was comfortable to wait on Ekblom's shoulder. Henry Marsh typically was off the back of the string, at times over 5 metres behind the last athlete. Ekblom continued to lead, the pack bunching up behind him with Marsh joining on the fifth lap but nobody moving past. Finally with a lap and a half to go, Mariano Scartezzini dared to go past, accelerating to take a couple of metres until Bogusław Mamiński went off in chase going into the bell, then the racing began. Wiggling through Reitz and Mamiński on the inside, Patriz Ilg pulled up to the challenging position with Marsh coming around the outside to join him. Before the final back stretch, Ilg went by and separated off the front. Mamiński squeezed inside of Marsh to take off in chase, only Marsh and Reitz still in contact. Picking up speed, Marsh passed Mamiński, then moving toward the outside he had room to pass Ilg on the outside going into the last barrier. Then Marsh hit the barrier. It didn't go down. Marsh did. Ilg was gone to victory. As Marsh tried to find his way to his feet, Mamiński, Reitz and Joseph Mahmoud went by to finish in that order.\nRecords.\nExisting records at the start of the event.\nSemi finals.\n&lt;br&gt;\nQualifying heats.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players and \nelected Reggie Jackson. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues; it selected no one. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 1, 1993.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1973 or later, but not after 1987; the ballot included candidates from the 1992 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1987. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 1993 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 5. The ballot consisted of 32 players; a total of 423 ballots were cast, with 318 votes required for election. A total of 2,437 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.76 per ballot—a record low up to this point, and the first BBWAA election to average fewer than 6 names per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The one candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in italics. The 11 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nThe newly-eligible players included 27 All-Stars, twelve of whom were not included on the ballot, representing a total of 78 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 14-time All-Star Reggie Jackson, 10-time All-Star Steve Garvey, 6-time All-Star Ron Cey and 5-time All-Star Cecil Cooper. The field included two MVPs (Jackson and Garvey) and one Rookie of the Year (Gary Matthews).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Len Barker, Dale Berra, Ray Burris, Dan Driessen, Mike Easler, Jamie Easterly, Mike Fischlin, George Frazier, Johnny Grubb, Moose Haas, Al Holland, Tom Hume, Clint Hurdle, Ruppert Jones, Lee Lacy, Ken Landreaux, Gary Lavelle, Johnnie LeMaster, Aurelio Lopez, Rick Manning, Charlie Moore, Jorge Orta, Tom Paciorek, Lenn Sakata, Joe Sambito, Bob Shirley, Roy Smalley, Sammy Stewart, U L Washington, and Rob Wilfong.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nLeonard Koppett (1923–2003) and Bus Saidt (1920–1989) received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring baseball writers. The awards were voted at the December 1992 meeting of the BBWAA, and included in the summer 1993 ceremonies."

        "title": "1902 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "Originally titled the \"Tournament East–West football game,\" what is now known as the Rose Bowl Game was first played on January 1, 1902, at Tournament Park in Pasadena, California, starting the tradition of New Year's Day bowl games.\nThe inaugural game featured Fielding H. Yost's dominating 1901 Michigan Wolverines football team, representing the East, who crushed a 3–1–2 team from Stanford University, representing the West, by a score of 49–0 after Stanford captain Ralph Fisher requested to quit with eight minutes remaining. Michigan finished the season 11–0 and was considered a national champion. Yost had been Stanford's coach the previous year.\nOrganization of the game.\nThe Tournament of Roses Parade began in 1890 as a New Year's Day tradition in the City of Pasadena. The city boosters were exploring a way to bring in tourism and money to the area. The Tournament of Roses Association president, James Wagner, guaranteed $3,500 to cover the expenses of bringing the football teams of the University of Michigan and Stanford University to Pasadena to play. The admission price was between 50 cents and a dollar to attend the game. An additional dollar would be charged to admit a family's horse and buggy to the grounds. The game was played in Tournament Park, where temporary stands were built. The officials were David Brown, referee (a graduate of Stanford and a former football manager); W. K. Peasley, umpire (a graduate of Williams); Phil Wilson, head linesman (a graduate of Stanford and former player) and C. G. Roe, linesman; Jack Sheehan (a graduate of Stanford) and H. K. Crafts, timers. The game kicked off at 2:30 p.m. sharp at the park on the corner of California Street and Wilson Avenue in Pasadena.\nTournament Park.\nBefore the Rose Bowl stadium was built for the 1923 Rose Bowl, games were played in Pasadena's Tournament Park, approximately three miles southeast of the current stadium. Tournament Park is now a private park maintained by the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. It was simply known as the \"town lot\" before being renamed Tournament Park in 1900.\nTeams.\nStanford had played the Olympic Club and the Reliance Athletic Club twice, beating and tying each. They beat Nevada State, 12–0, then lost to California in the 11th Big Game, 2–0.\nThe 1901 Michigan Wolverines football team was nicknamed the \"Point-a-Minute\" team when they came to Pasadena to play the game. The Wolverines had racked up 501 points while allowing their opponents no points at all. The 49 points they scored in the 1902 Rose Bowl game brought their season total to 550 to 0.\nAftermath.\nThe game was so lopsided that for the next 13 years, the Tournament of Roses officials ran chariot races, ostrich races, and other various events instead of football. But, on New Year's Day 1916 football returned to stay as Washington State University defeated Brown University in the first annual Tournament of Roses football game. At Stanford, rugby replaced football from the 1906 season through the 1917 season.\nIn record keeping, Neil Snow's five touchdowns are noted along with the \"modern\" Rose Bowl record of four touchdowns held by Eric Ball, Sam Cunningham, and Ron Dayne. Snow was named the Most Valuable Player of the game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively.\nThe initial attendance has varied according to different sources. The ESPN BCS article lists the attendance as 8,500. The Michigan football media guide and Michigan articles list the attendance as 8,000. The Official 2007 NCAA Division I football records book lists the attendance at 8,000.\nTournament Park would be the site for the second to eighth Rose Bowl Games from 1916 to 1922 before the Rose Bowl stadium opened for the 1923 Rose Bowl.\nAs of 2016, Stanford has appeared in the Rose Bowl 15 times, tied with Ohio State for third most, and Michigan has appeared 20 times, second most.\nStanford would make their next bowl appearance in 1925, the 1925 Rose Bowl. Michigan's next bowl game was in the 1948 Rose Bowl."

The one candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\".

The absence of a win or loss indicates a no decision. Wins or losses a pitcher received in relief appearances are not included here.\nThe leader for World Series starts in a career is Whitey Ford, with 22 between 1950 and 1964, all for the New York Yankees. Ford is the leader both in World Series wins by a starting pitcher, with 10, and World Series losses by a starting pitcher, with eight. Christy Mathewson is the career leader in World Series complete games, with 10 during 1905–1913, all for the New York Giants. While complete games were once common in the World Series (the first edition without a complete game was ) the most recent World Series complete game win was thrown by Johnny Cueto for the Kansas City Royals in , and the most recent World Series complete game loss was thrown by Tom Glavine for the Atlanta Braves in .\nThe record for the most innings pitched in a single World Series start is 14, held by Babe Ruth who won an extra innings complete game for the Boston Red Sox in the 1916 World Series. Facing 48 batters, Ruth allowed one run on six hits while walking three and striking out four. Several starting pitchers have been credited with zero innings pitched, by not recording an out, the most recent being Bob Welch for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1981 World Series. Welch faced only four batters, allowing three hits and a walk, and was charged with two runs; his team ultimately won the game."

        "text": "The Japan national American football team represents Japan in international American football competitions. The team is controlled by the Japan American Football Association, and has been one of the world's strongest international teams since it began participating regularly in international tournaments in the 1990s, and currently possesses the second most American Football World Cups (1999, 2003).\nJapan won the inaugural 1999 IFAF World Championship and won again in 2003. In 2007 they advanced to the final, losing to the United States 23–20 in overtime. In 2010 Japan beat Germany 24–14 in the inaugural Germany-Japan Bowl. In February 2011, Japan bested South Korea (76–0) to qualify for the 2011 IFAF World Championship.\n2014.\nPreparing for the qualification match for the 2015 IFAF World Championship, the JAFA scheduled an international friendly match against Germany on April 12, 2014 at Kawasaki Stadium in Kawasaki, Kanagawa. 85 players were initially chosen for the national team on March 11 which was whittled down to the required 45-men roster before April 12. Before a crowd of 1,889, Japan defeated Germany 38–0 in a strong defensive showing for the Japanese which limited Germany to only 135 yards of total offense, as well as causing four turnovers and two sacks, the latter of which was all in the second half. Before going against the Philippines, Japan made 5 changes in their roster, replacing WRs Ryoma Hagiyama and Naoki Maeda with Takeshi Akiyama and Junpei Yoshimoto, RB Keita Takanohashi with Takashi Miyako, LB Yuki Ikeda with Yoshiki Tanaka, and S Toshinari Masatani with Takeshi Miyake. Against a young Philippine team that was in its first year in the IFAF, the Japanese showed no quarter, scoring on every offensive possession as well as holding the Philippines to only 1st down en route to an 86–0 victory, the 2nd biggest win in the national team's history. \nWith the win, Japan, along with South Korea, (which defeated Kuwait in the other qualification match 69-7) qualified for the 2015 IFAF World Championship tournament in Canton, Ohio, United States.\n2015.\nDue to Canada dropping out of the tournament for personal team reasons, Japan was granted a bye on the scheduled match which was supposed to be on July 9 and in turn would play the winner of the Mexico-United States match on July 12. In their first match of the tournament, Japan, despite a strong defensive showing in the first half that included 2 interceptions and 29-yd field goal block, eventually lost to the United States 18–43. In their 2nd match, Japan defeated Mexico 35–7 with a strong effort on offense and defense. The win ensured the Japanese a rematch with the United States for the Gold Medal. Team Japan would lose to the United States 12–59 in what is the national team's largest loss in history. "

        "text": "This is an NCAA Division I men's basketball alignment history. NCAA Division I is the highest level of competition in the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the main governing body for U.S. college sports.\nFor its first half-century of existence, the NCAA, founded in 1906 as the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States and adopting its current name in 1910, was a single body for competitive purposes. It did not split into separate divisions for competition and governance purposes until 1956, when it established the University Division and College Division. In 1973, the University Division was renamed Division I, while the College Division was split into today's Divisions II and III. However, the NCAA now considers the 1947–48 season as the first in which an equivalent to today's Division I existed in basketball. This particular season was the first in which the Associated Press published college basketball rankings, with the news service choosing to publish separate rankings for what it called \"major colleges\" and \"small colleges\". The AP's \"major colleges\" of 1948 correspond directly to today's Division I, with \"small colleges\" corresponding to today's Divisions II and III.\nTeams in \"italics\" are no longer in Division I. Seasons are listed by the calendar year in which they end—for example, if a school's first Division I season was the 1991–92 school year, it will be listed as having begun in 1992.\nDates used reflect when the school first became eligible for NCAA-sponsored postseason play—either the NCAA tournament for men or women, the NIT since it was acquired by the NCAA in 2005, or the WBIT upon its launch in 2024. Note that it is possible for a school that is not eligible for NCAA postseason play to play in a tournament not operated by that organization. For example, South Dakota State's women's team, which was not eligible to compete in the NCAA tournament until 2009, played in the WNIT, which is not an NCAA-controlled tournament, in 2007 and 2008. Similarly, the Omaha men's team played in the 2014 CIT before becoming eligible for NCAA postseason play in 2016. The Tarleton State men's team played in the 2023 CBI and the 2024 CIT \nbefore becoming eligible for NCAA postseason play in 2025.\nSchool names listed here reflect those in current use, which may or may not reflect names used in an institution's earlier history."

        "text": "Francis Arthur \"Mother\" Dunn, (April 15, 1891 – February 1975) was an American football player as well as head football coach for at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. While coaching at Dickinson he also played professional football for the Canton Bulldogs. After coaching he served as a corporate attorney in the steel industry until he retired in 1969\nEarly life.\nDunn was born and raised in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania where attended the local schools. After high school, he chose to attend Dickinson College because the school had a law school. While at Dickinson he was member of many organizations including the Student Senate, Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, as well as serving as president of the Athletic Association. A well rounded student he also sang with the Glee Club and sat on the editorial board of the college yearbook. He is considered one of greatest all-round athletes in the Dickinson's history earning two letters for basketball and four letters in football. During his senior year at Dickinson he married and had a daughter.\nDunn received the nickname \"Mother\" while traveling for his first year of college. It was giving to him by two upperclassman that happen to run into the incoming freshman at the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania train station. After finding out his last name, they started calling him \"Mother,\" in reference to the Penn State All-American Center, William Thomas \"Mother\" Dunn.\nAfter he graduated in 1914 he was a teacher and coach at Elkins Park High School in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania. The following year, he returned to Dickinson and entered the School of Law.\nCollege athlete.\nDunn played fullback and halfback for the Dickinson College football team from 1910 to 1913. During his freshman year, he started every game and led the team in scoring with 25 points. The next year under new coach Simon F. Pauxtis, Dunn teamed up Hyman Goldstein in Dickinson backfield. The team finished with a record of 4–4. Dickinson started the season with a 17–0 loss to cross town rival Carlisle Indian Industrial School that featured Jim Thorpe and was coached by Pop Warner. Besides Carlisle, Dickinson faced off with National power University of Pennsylvania. Against Penn Dunn scored on a 35-yard interception but Dickinson lost by a score of 22–10. This was the most points that Dickinson had ever scored against Penn. In addition to their scheduled games, Dickinson and the Carlisle Indian Industrial School would play midweek scrimmages throughout the season. Dunn was elected captain of the 1912 team. The team started slow with losses to Penn and Carlisle but finished with a 4–4–1 record. The highlight of the season was a 0–0 tie against Swarthmore College on Thanksgiving Day. Dunn ran for 124 yards against a Swarthmore team that had beaten powers Penn, Navy and Lafayette. For the season Dunn led the team in scoring with 54 points on 9 touchdowns. In Dunn's last year playing for Dickinson, the Red and White finished with a record of 4–5 under new coach S. W. Harrington. During a game at Washington &amp; Jefferson, Dunn play was so impressed the opponent's fans they gave him a standing ovation when he left the game in the fourth quarter. He finished the season with five games in which he had over 100 yards in offence. When he finished playing football Dunn had numerous Dickinson College records including most points in one game (30), most points in a season (84), most yards rushing in a season (114 carries for 959 yards), along with most of the other rushing and scoring records.\nCollege coach.\nTo earn extra money while attending law school, Dunn took a part-time job as the head football coach for the Dickinson College. He held this position for the 1915 and 1917 seasons. The 1915 season did not do well for the Red and White. Due lack of talent and size the team finished with a record of 0–9–1. Seven of the eleven starters weighed less than 150 lbs. The team did not score in the first five-game and only scored 44 points total for the season. Dunn's team did manage a 0–0 tie with Western Maryland College in the first game of the season.\nFor the 1916 season Forrest Craver, who had been serving as an advisor to the team, returned as head coach but hired Dunn as his field coach. He also hired J. Reap, a former Villanova football player, to assist with the line. In addition the team talent got a boost when Dunn convinced Gus Welch, considered one of the best players at Carlisle Indian Industrial School, to join the team. The team finished with a 4–3–2 record. One of the ties was against Swarthmore College, a team that had beaten national powers Penn and Columbia. Dickinson came from behind when Welsh tied the game with five seconds remaining. Dunn returned as head coach for the 1917 season after Craver and took a coaching position at the Tome School in Port Deposit, Maryland. Due to World War I, few members of the 1917 team returned, many choosing to join the military. Dunn coached the 1917 squad to the first undefeated and untied season Dickinson history. His overall coaching record at Dickinson was 5–8–1.\nProfessional football player.\nAt the same time Dunn was coaching the Dickinson College football team, he was also earning money during law school by playing professional football for the Canton Bulldogs under Jim Thorpe. Thorpe was tipped off by a teammate, Gus Welch, that Dunn was planning on playing for the Bulldogs' arch rival, the Massillon Tigers. Upon hearing the news, Thorpe hired Dunn to play for the Bulldogs. During the season Dunn would board a train on Saturday night so he could arrive for the game on Sunday. The team would run through plays in the morning and play in the afternoon. Dunn was able to pick up the plays easily because they were based on Pop Warner's offence that Warner used when he coached Thorpe at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Dunn was quite familiar since Carlisle was a cross town rival that he played against numerous times.\nAfter football.\nAfter the 1917 season Dunn followed Forrest Craver and took a temporary coaching position the Tome School. He held this job until his bar exam was reviewed. While teaching at the Tome School, a father of one of the students approached Dunn to take a legal position at the Cambria Steel Company in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Dunn stayed with the company when it merged with Bethlehem Steel in 1923 and retired in 1969."

Primarily a relief pitcher, he stood tall and weighed 220 pounds (100 kg) in his playing days. He batted and threw right-handed.\nEarly years.\nBorn in New York City, Ferrick spent four years in an upstate New York seminary studying for the Roman Catholic priesthood while also a farmhand with the home team New York Giants. He left the seminary in to attend training camp with the Giants, but was released by the club due to an injured arm.\nHe spent the season with the Brooklyn Bushwicks, and pitched well enough to catch the eye of Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack.\nPhiladelphia A's.\nFerrick immediately shined upon his arrival in Philadelphia. He made his major league debut against the Boston Red Sox on April 19, , and pitched three scoreless innings in relief. When the first place Cleveland Indians came to Shibe Park on a five-game winning streak for a three-game set against the last place A's on May 18–20, Ferrick appeared in two of the three games. He earned his first major league win in game one of the set, stepping in for an injured Johnny Babich in the fifth inning, and only allowing one Cleveland base runner to reach second base. In the third game of the set, Ferrick closed the game with two perfect innings to allow his team to hold onto a 6–5 lead and sweep the series.\nHaving made four starts for the A's, he pitched his only career shutout on August 21 against the St. Louis Browns. In spite of this one performance, he began to sputter toward the end of the season, going 2–5 with a 6.36 earned run average in August and September. He was selected off waivers by the Indians with five games left in the season, but did not appear in any games for his new club. He finished the season with an 8–10 record and 3.77 ERA in 36 games for the A's.\nU.S. Navy.\nFerrick appeared in 31 games for the 1942 Indians, going 3–2 with a 1.99 ERA, which would have led the American League had he pitched more innings. That Christmas, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served as a Shipfitter, Third-Class at Naval Station Great Lakes in Lake County, Illinois. While serving in Hawaii in , he played baseball at Kāneʻohe Bay Naval Air Station, and starred in the 1944 Pacific Service World Series between the Navy and U.S. Army. In , Chief Petty Officer Ferrick participated in the Navy's Western Pacific Tour, playing for the fifth fleet team.\nReturn to MLB.\nWhen he returned to the Indians in , he made just nine appearances before being sold to the St. Louis Browns upon new owner Bill Veeck's dismantling of the club.\nOn August 4, 1946, Ferrick earned both of his first two wins with the Browns in a doubleheader with his former club, the Philadelphia Athletics. After the season, the Browns sold Ferrick to the Washington Senators for a $7500 waiver price. With his new club, he would lose both games of a doubleheader on August 20, . He went 3–12 with a 3.77 ERA over two seasons for a team that finished in seventh place, but was among the league leaders in saves (9 &amp; 10, respectively) both seasons he was in Washington. Following the season, he was traded back to the Browns with John Sullivan and $25,000 for Sam Dente.\nThough the Browns lost 101 games in , Ferrick pitched well out of the bullpen, and was the only pitcher on the squad with a winning record (6-4, 3.88 ERA in 50 games). At the trade deadline, he, Joe Ostrowski and Leo Thomas were traded to the New York Yankees for Jim Delsing, Don Johnson, Duane Pillette and Snuffy Stirnweiss plus $50,000.\nNew York Yankees.\nWith a winning ball club for the first time in his career, Ferrick helped the Yankees jumped from a margin of 4.5 games back of the Detroit Tigers to win the American League. He was 1–0 in five appearances against the Tigers, holding them scoreless over a total of 10.2 innings pitched. Overall, Ferrick went 8–4 with a 3.65 ERA and nine saves. He was called by manager Casey Stengel \"Our most important individual performer in our drive to the top.\" He made one appearance in the World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, pitching the final inning of game three to earn the win.\nFerrick started the season with the Yankees, but after poor pitching performances against the Tigers and Red Sox, he was packaged with Bob Porterfield and Fred Sanford, and sent to the Washington Senators for Bob Kuzava.\nCoaching &amp; scouting career.\nDespite the fact that Ferrick pitched respectably in his second go round with the Senators (6-3, 2.73 ERA over 2 seasons), he sought his release at the end of the season to take on a player/coach role with the Cleveland Indians' triple A affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians in , going 1–1 in 23 games. A season later, when Indianapolis manager Birdie Tebbetts was named manager of the Cincinnati Redlegs, he brought Ferrick along to serve as his pitching coach. He later served as pitching coach for the Philadelphia Phillies (), Detroit Tigers (–) and Kansas City Athletics (–).\nHe became chief scout of the A's from to . In , he joined the expansion Kansas City Royals as a \"special assignment scout with emphasis on pitching\", and scouted for the club for over twenty years before retiring.\nCareer stats.\nFerrick had exceptional control, allowing just 227 walks in 674 innings pitched, and uncorking just nine wild pitches over his nine-year career. The only batter he ever hit with a pitch was Chicago White Sox second baseman Cass Michaels in 1949.\nPersonal life.\nTom Ferrick died from heart failure at age 81 in Lima, Pennsylvania. His son, Tom Jr., is a former newspaper columnist for \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", and often recounted anecdotes of his father's playing career in his column. He also had another son and four daughters."

However, it took him until his sixth appearance (more than a year later) to score his first try, as he touched down against Connacht on 28 September 2007.\nOn 12 November 2013, Davies signed for French club Clermont Auvergne in the Top 14 on a two-year deal.\nOn 13 November 2015, Davies returned to Scarlets from Clermont Auvergne on a national dual contract with the Welsh Rugby Union.\nInternational career.\nWales.\nIn 2009, Davies received his first call-up to the Welsh senior team for their mid-year tour of North America. He made his international debut in the first game of the tour, starting at outside centre against Canada on 30 May 2009. He also played in the match against the United States, and scored two tries.\nFor this performance and his form for the Scarlets, Davies was one of four Scarlets included in Wales's 29-man squad for the 2009 Autumn internationals. After being named as an unused substitute for the New Zealand game on 7 November, Davies was again named on the bench against Samoa on 13 November, taking the place of the injured Tom Shanklin after 49 minutes. With Shanklin injured, Davies was picked to partner Jamie Roberts at inside centre against Argentina on 21 November. Although Wales won the match 33–16, it was an error from Davies that led to Argentina's only try; Davies attempted to kick the ball forward, but it cannoned off the legs of his opposite number, Martín Rodríguez, who gathered the ball and took it back in himself for the try. Nevertheless, Davies and Roberts formed a solid partnership in the middle of the field for the majority of the game, and Argentina were otherwise limited to penalty goals. Despite his error, Davies retained the number 12 jersey for the final match of the series against Australia, although an injury to winger Leigh Halfpenny within the first 30 minutes meant that Davies spent the majority of the game playing out of position on the right wing; Wales lost the match 33–12.\nOn 18 January 2010, Davies was named in the 35-man Wales squad for the 2010 Six Nations tournament. However, he was not named in the 22-man squad for any of Wales's five matches in the competition. He returned to the Wales team on their summer tour of New Zealand, coming on as a substitute for Jamie Roberts for the last 10 minutes of the first Test on 19 June. An injury to Andrew Bishop prior to the second Test the following weekend saw Davies and Roberts renew their centre partnership, though this time Davies occupied the outside position. Davies spearheaded one of Wales's best attacks of the game, but attempted to go solo for the goal line instead of offloading to one of three supporting runners with the line at their mercy.\nOn 21 October 2010, Davies was again named in the Wales squad for the Autumn international series, but he was preferred for each of the games by a combination of James Hook, Tom Shanklin and Andrew Bishop.\nFollowing a 2011 6-Nations series in which Davies returned as a starting centre, he was named in Wales's preliminary World Cup squad. Davies completed both infamous training camps in Spala, Poland and was subsequently named as one of four centres. He started in all three of the side's pre-tournament tests against England, home and away, and Argentina at home.\nDuring the 2011 World Cup Davies played a part in every Welsh game from the opening fixture against South Africa through to their third-place play-off defeat by Australia, forming a formidable centre partnership with Jamie Roberts.\nDavies returned to the Scarlets squad in time for their opening Heineken Cup pool game against Castres. Enjoying a successful 2011 with both region and country, Davies rose to international status through the ranks of quality Welsh centres.\nIn 2012 Davies was a member of the Wales team which won the Championship, achieving their third Grand Slam in eight tournaments.\nLions.\nDavies was selected to play for the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia. He was controversially selected in the third test ahead of Brian O'Driscoll in what would have been O'Driscoll's last appearance for the British &amp; Irish Lions. The Lions won the third test convincingly.\nDavies was again selected to play on the 2017 Lions tour of New Zealand. He was voted player of the series by his Lions team-mates.\nPlaying style.\nDavies has an all-round game including opportunistic try scoring, kicking and physical presence, but he is particularly valued for his defensive marshalling and protection of the 13 channel, including remaining linked with his defensive colleagues, and occasional spot-blitzing.\nPersonal life.\nDavies' brother James also plays rugby. Davies is married. Davies supports Manchester United and is a fan of Tom Brady.\nAwards.\nOn 5 August 2019, Davies was inducted into the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in Llanrwst. He will use the name \"Jon Cadno\" (), in reference to his nickname."

Following a leg injury to Steenberge, backup Bill Etter started the next two games, and then he too suffered a knee injury that ended his season. Cliff Brown then went into action in the second quarter against Miami, and led the team to a 17–0 victory. Brown started all of the remaining games in the season, losing only to USC and LSU.\nThe following year, sophomore Tom Clements started at quarterback, and Brown was the primary backup for both the 1972 and 1973 seasons. Brown's last touchdown at Notre Dame came in the final regular-season game of the 1973 national championship season—a 6-yard run at the end of a 44–0 rout of Miami. Brown was selected in the 17th round of the 1974 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles as a running back; he did not make the final roster.\nBrown died on December 10, 2012, at the age of 60."

        "title": "Tennis Canada",
        "text": "Tennis Canada is the national governing body of tennis within Canada. It works together with the provincial associations to organize tournaments and rules. They also oversee the Canada Davis Cup team and the Canada Fed Cup team. Tennis Canada was formed in 1890 and is a full member of the International Tennis Federation (ITF). Tennis Canada operates under the auspices of Sport Canada, and is a member of the Canadian Olympic Association. Tennis Canada’s event management team is directly responsible for all national and international competitions in Canada, including junior, senior and wheelchair championships.\nHistory.\nThe Canadian Lawn Tennis Association (CLTA) was formed on July 1, 1890, in Toronto, Ontario. Delegates were present from at least thirteen clubs: six Toronto tennis clubs, including the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club; two clubs from Montreal, Quebec; and clubs from London, Ottawa, St. Catharines, Peterboro, and Petrolea, all in Ontario. Charles Smith Hyman, who won the Canadian Championships (later known as the Canadian Open) singles title five times in the 1880s, was chosen as its first president and served three one-year terms (1890–1892). The CLTA began organizing the Canadian Championships at the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club, starting with the 1890 tournament. They adopted the rules of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, the club which hosts Wimbledon. Beginning in 1894, the CLTA began organizing a junior championship for boys 18 years old and under.\nIn the first quarter century of its existence, two men served lengthy terms as president of the CLTA: Henry Gordon MacKenzie for eight years (1893–1900), and A. C. McMaster for thirteen years (1904–1916). The International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) was formed in 1913, and the CLTA was invited to be a founding member but declined. In 1915, with many players fighting in World War I, the CLTA decided to suspend Canadian participation in the Davis Cup and also suspend the Canadian Championships. During the war, Canadian tournaments were suspended, except where \"the entire proceeds were devoted to the Red Cross or other patriotic funds\". In 1919, the CLTA resumed Canadian tournaments, but passed resolutions restricting Canadian players from competing \"in tournaments authorized by Germans, Austrians, Turks, or Bulgarians\" (i.e. Central Powers) and barring players from those nations from competing in Canadian tournaments. In 1920, Canada sought to return to Davis Cup play, but issued a late withdrawal citing an inability \"to secure players of Davis Cup calibre\".\nGarnett H. Meldrum was president of the CLTA for twelve years (1922–1933). Meldrum, who had previously been a founding member of the Ontario Lawn Tennis Association, boosted the international prestige of the Canadian Championships and began moving the tournament around Canada. The 1931 tournament, for example, was held in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1922, the CLTA began publishing a magazine, \"Canadian Lawn Tennis\"; the first issue included the complete rules governing Canadian tennis. By 1927, the CLTA had joined the ILTF. In 1928, Meldrum proposed that one junior boy from each province be sent to the Canadian Championships as a means of stimulating improvement in their game. At that time, there were 366 clubs and over 24,000 players affiliated with the CLTA. Robert N. Watt served as president for nine years (1937–1945), and later became the first Canadian president of the ILTF in 1957. In 1938, the CLTA formed a national player development commission.\nDuring World War II, the CLTA suspended participation in the Davis Cup and also suspended the Canadian Championships. As during the first world war, war-benefit tournaments were held in Canada.\nIn 1975, Josef Brabenec Sr. was named the first Canadian national tennis coach. During his tenure, he designed national junior development and national coaching certification programs. In 1976, the CLTA began renting a site on the grounds of York University in Toronto for one dollar per year, for the purpose of building a million-dollar five-court tennis centre, to be the home of the Canadian Open tournament.\nStructure.\nThe organizational membership is made up of ten provincial and two territorial associations: Tennis Alberta, Tennis BC, Tennis Manitoba, Tennis New Brunswick, Tennis Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, Tennis Nova Scotia, Ontario Tennis Association, Tennis Prince Edward Island, Tennis Quebec, Tennis Saskatchewan, Tennis Yukon, and Tennis Northwest Territories.\nAs of 2017, the Chair of the Board is Derrick Rowe, while the President and Chief Executive Officer is Michael S. Downey. Directors include Marc Bibeau, Jennifer Bishop, Jack Graham (emeritus), Richard Harris, Sébastien Leblanc, Stephen Mandel, Nadir Mohamed and Mike Tevlin.\nDevelopment.\nTennis Canada operates a junior national training program through three centers: at IGA Stadium in Montreal; at Aviva Centre in Toronto; and at the North Shore Winter Club in Vancouver.\nTournaments.\nTennis Canada owns and operates the Canadian Open (marketed as the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers since 2021), a joint men's and women's competition which attracts the top players in the world. For men, the Canadian Open is a Masters 1000 event on the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tour; for women, it is a WTA 1000 event on the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tour. In even-numbered years, the men's tournament is held in Montreal, while the women's tournament is held in Toronto, and vice versa in odd-numbered years.\nTennis Canada also owns and operates six ATP Challenger Tour tournaments in Drummondville, Winnipeg, Gatineau, Granby, Vancouver, and Calgary; and several lower-level ITF-sanctioned professional tournaments for men and women.\nAt the junior level, Tennis Canada operates eight junior national championships for Canadian juniors each year, including both indoor and outdoor events in four age categories: under-12, under-14, under-16, and under-18. They also host several ITF-sanctioned junior tournaments from Grade 1 to Grade 5 open to international players. The largest of these is the Grade 1 level Canadian Open Junior Tennis Championships held in Repentigny, Quebec.\nInternational tennis.\nTennis Canada is responsible for organizing Canadian teams for the Fed Cup, Davis Cup, Hopman Cup, the Olympics, and Paralympics.\nRogers rankings.\nTennis Canada, in partnership with the Provincial Tennis Associations, launched Rogers Rankings on January 1, 2009. This new and enhanced ranking system is based on the proven Elo rating system used for ranking chess players and has been developed and used with exceptional accuracy by the Quebec Tennis Federation for over twenty-five years. The Rogers Rankings allows all competitors to compare themselves to the nation’s top players. Similar systems have also been in use in Spain and France. The Rogers Rankings system awards points to players based on quality of wins (i.e. head-to-head results) versus rounds won in a tournament. The system generates accurate rankings due to its ability to evaluate the calibre of competing players. Based on this premise, the stronger player is expected to win while the weaker player is expected to lose. Players are ranked according to points accumulated in national, provincial and international tournaments sanctioned by the Tennis Canada ranking committee. Player points are used to compute a national and provincial ranking. To ensure accuracy, Tennis Canada and the PTAs began testing the system internally on January 1, 2008. The system was computerized in partnership between Tennis Canada and Computan, a development company that helped build ranking systems for many Canadian sports organizations."

        "title": "Maynard Morrison (American football)",
        "text": "Maynard Davis \"Doc\" Morrison (May 28, 1909 – June 2, 2006) was an All-American football fullback and center for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1929 to 1931. Michigan football coach Harry Kipke ranked Morrison as the finest linebacker he ever saw. \"No one ever got past him,\" Kipke said. In 1931, he was chosen by Grantland Rice and the NEA Service as a first-team All-American at center and helped lead Michigan to a Big Ten Conference championship.\n1929 season.\nAs a sophomore in 1929, Morrison was already a significant contributor at the fullback position. When Morrison finished his freshman year, he \"was rated the outstanding fullback prospect in Michigan history.\" In the fall of 1929, Morrison missed five games at the beginning of the season due to injury. Then, against Illinois, he was placed in the lineup at tackle and became \"the individual star of the Wolverines by a wide, handsome and undisputed margin.\" On defense, he was taken out of the line and played at defensive fullback, and when an Illinois back found a hole in the line, Grantland Rice wrote that “Morrison usually picked him up bodily and hurled him back into the breach in the wall.” And occasionally, \"he was content with merely smacking the ball carriers against the ground as they had never been smacked before.\" After the Illinois game, Coach Kipke said of Morrison, \"That boy will develop into the finest defensive back in Michigan’s history. His injured knee isn't entirely well, and when it is he will add more speed to his play.\"\nAt the end of the 1929 season, Coach Kipke touted Morrison as the best back to wear the Michigan uniform in 15 years: \"Coach Harry Kipke says Maynard Morrison . . . is the nearest approach to Johnny Maulbetsch the Wolverines have seen in the last 15 years. Morrison is a husky sophomore of more than 200 pounds and hits the line with all the force and power that made Maulbetsch famous as a line smasher. Morrison suffered early season injuries that kept him from play during the first month but he is expected to show his stuff in the closing games.\" He scored a touchdown in a 14–12 victory over Harvard, as he \"hurled his 210 pound bulk through the Crimson forward wall for a touchdown.\" After a scoreless tie with Iowa, the Associated Press reported that Morrison “was responsible for most of the Wolverine’s first downs.”\n1930 season.\nIn the summer of 1930, Coach Kipke reported that he had 15 varsity caliber backs but was lacking in talent in the line. Accordingly, Kipke reported he was considering moving Morrison to the center position. Again in early September, Kipke announced that “so great is the lack of linemen” that he proposed making a center of Morrison. However, before making the move, Kipke had to persuade Morrison's father. One newspaper account in 1930 reported: \"Maynard Morrison was a pretty good fullback last year at Michigan. Coach Harry Kipke though he saw great center possibilities in the young man from Royal Oak. But Morrison’s father wanted him to carry the ball. Kipke made the trip himself to Royal Oak to persuade Papa Morrison that Maynard would be better at flipping the ball than lugging it.\"\nAfter ten days of experimenting during fall practice, Kipke made the switch, moving Maynard from fullback to center.\nMorrison performed well at his new position in 1930, being praised by the AP for his “defensive genius.” At the end of the 1930 season, Morrison was named to All-Big Ten teams by the United Press and the NEA (Newspaper Enterprise Association) Service. One reporter noted that Morrison \"was just about everything a coach could ask for in a center.\"\n1931 season.\nIn 1931, Morrison started nine games for the 8–1–1 Wolverines team that tied for the Big Ten Conference championship. Morrison was selected as a first-team All-American in 1931 by Grantland Rice for Collier’s magazine and by the NEA Service All-America Board. The NEA Service All-America Board made their All-American selections based on more than 680 reports from coaches, writers and officials representing every section of the country where football was played. According to newspaper accounts reporting on Morrison being the consensus selection by the board members at the center position, it was noted that his \"great defensive ability gave him the call.\" Thomas Yarr of Notre Dame was named the first-team center by the Associated Press in 1931.\nIn announcing Morrison as its All-Big Ten team center, the Associated Press described him as \"Michigan’s 210 pound center from Royal Oak, Michigan,\" a player who was \"big, shifty and fast,\" and \"the key man of Michigan's defense.\" Football writer Merle Oliver called Morrison Michigan’s “diagnostician of enemy plays.”\nMorrison was part of a long line of All-American centers at Michigan, starting with William Cunningham and Germany Schulz followed by Ernie Vick, Jack Blott, Bob Brown, and Chuck Bernard.\nHonors and accolades.\nAmong the honors received by Morrison are the following:"

        "title": "Rugby union equipment",
        "text": "A traditional rugby union kit consists of a jersey and shorts, long rugby socks and boots with studs. The other main piece of equipment is the rugby ball.\nSome modest padding is allowed on the head, shoulders and collarbone, but it must be sufficiently light, thin and compressible to meet World Rugby standards. Players may wear a mouthguard to guard against concussion and potential chipping of the teeth.\nBall.\nThe ball used in rugby union is a prolate spheroid essentially elliptical in profile. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are manufactured of synthetic waterproof materials, and in a variety of colors and patterns.\nBoots.\nTraditionally, rugby boots were of a high cut above the ankle. Over the years, such boots have become less common, although many players still wear mid-cut boots, just below the ankle. Additional ankle support was seen as appropriate given the nature of the game, particularly the stresses of forward play and the amount of physical contact involved. Higher cut boots also provided some protection against knocks.\nModern boots are now more similar to football boots, with a low cut offering less ankle support but maximum flexibility with minimum weight. \nIt is essential for safety considerations, particularly in the scrum, that forwards wear boots with removable studs. The studs may be metal (aluminum) or plastic and must conform to Regulation 12 of World Rugby. This regulation dictates the permissible dimensions of the studs and also defines a standard for the hardness of the material. Backs would be advised, on most ground types, to wear boots with some form of a stud, to ensure adequate grip when changing direction.\nReferees are required to check all players' studs before a game and ensure that the studs conform to the laws and have no sharp edges. Any studs that are worn down so that the steel fixing is showing must be changed before the player is allowed to join in the game. The intent of the standard and these pre-match checks is to eliminate the potential for a stud to cause a cut if it comes into contact with a player's skin.\nGenerally, there are two types of stud pattern worn: the 8 stud or the 6 stud. The 8 stud is most often worn by the tight forwards (props, hooker and second row) to provide them with extra grip for scrummaging and mauling. The 6 stud is worn by backs as it allows for more agility and quicker movement around the field. Plastic \"blade\" studs, common in football, are an increasingly frequent choice among backs.\nGoalposts.\nRugby union uses H-shaped goalposts at each end of the playing field. The posts are 5.6 metres (18 ft) apart, and the crossbar is 3 metres (9.8 ft) from the ground.\nTraining equipment.\nSome specialist items of equipment are used for rugby training, including: \nTackle bags.\nThese are used during training and warmup in rugby union. Tackle bags are padded equipment which allows players to tackle without another player being involved. Tackle bags come in two forms: the rucking shield and the tackle bag. The rucking shield is held in the hand of a coach or fellow player and allows the tackler to drive against the person holding the shield safely. The tackle bag stands on the ground held loosely by another person, and allows the tackler to practice a full tackle.\nScrum machine.\nA scrum machine, or scrummaging machine, is a padded, weighty device against which a pack of rugby football forwards can practice scrummaging and rucking to improve the strength and skills of their players."
