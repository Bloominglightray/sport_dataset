It was organised by the International Kabaddi Federation and contested from 7 to 22 October 2016 in Ahmedabad, India. Twelve countries competed in the tournament.\nIndia won their 3rd World Cup by defeating Iran 38–29 in the final.\nParticipating countries.\nTwelve teams competed in the tournament. Pakistan was originally scheduled to participate in the tournament, but was removed due to increased tensions between India and Pakistan. The International Kabaddi Federation argued that it was \"not the right time to engage with Pakistan\". The Pakistani team criticized the move, arguing that it was comparable to holding a FIFA World Cup without Brazil.\nVenue.\nThe tournament was hosted at The Arena (currently known as The Arena by TransStadia, pending the sale of official naming rights), a newly constructed convertible stadium in Ahmedabad. In its standard configuration, it operates as an outdoor football pitch capable of seating 20,000. The venue utilizes technology licensed from the British firm StadiArena, which allows a portion of the field to be partitioned into a 4,000-seat indoor arena, which is used for the tournament. The venue is a public-private partnership with India's Department of Tourism\nMarketing.\nEmblem.\nThe official emblem of the tournament was unveiled on 14 September 2016 by Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Vijay Goel. It incorporates a stylized lion, representing the Asiatic lions of Girnar. The use of a lion symbolizes the \"ferocity of a Kabaddi defender and the agility of a raider\", while its striped mane represents the worldwide participation in the tournament.\nBroadcasting.\nStar Sports served as host broadcaster of the tournament. In a partnership with Voke, all matches were also streamed in 360-degree video with stereoscopic 3D options."

        "text": "The Pan American Gymnastics Union organizes Pan American Gymnastics Championships in different disciplines of gymnastics: men's and women's artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, acrobatic gymnastics, trampoline and tumbling, as well as aerobic gymnastics. The Pan American Gymnastics Championships are considered by the International Gymnastics Federation to be the official continental championships for the Americas (comprising North America, South America, Central America and the Caribbean). Pan American Championships have also been organized for the sport of aesthetic group gymnastics.\nHistory.\nArtistic gymnastics competitions have been contested in the Americas since 1946, at the fifth edition of the Central American and Caribbean Games. In 1951 , the sport was contested at the inaugural edition of the Pan American Games, and in 1957 the first edition of the South American championships in artistic gymnastics was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1964, the North American Championships in artistic gymnastics was contested for the first time. The meet would be staged until 1968, and in 1969 the competition changed its name to \"Copa de las Americas\" (Cup of the Americas) to allow South American nations to compete. At least one South American nation, Brazil, intended to compete, but eventually the event was attended only by North American nations.\nOnly in 1987, with the development and growth of gymnastics around the world, a tournament for junior gymnasts from the Americas was established with competitions in artistic and rhythmic gymnastics. The event was originally scheduled to take place in 1986, but was ultimately held from February 20 to 28, 1987, in Barquisimeto, Venezuela. It was the first international tournament held on a continental level in the Americas outside of the gymnastics events at the Pan American Games, and the first of its kind for junior gymnasts. A tournament for senior artistic and rhythmic gymnasts took place for the first time in 1989, named the \"Pan American Cup\". A second edition of the tournament was scheduled for four years later, in December 1993, in Maracaibo, Venezuela, with events in men's and women's artistic gymnastics.\nIn 1997, the title \"Pan American Cup\" was dropped in favor of \"Pan American Gymnastics Championships\". The title \"Pan American Cup\" would then be used to represent tournaments between clubs, instead of tournaments between national representatives. The 1997 Pan American Gymnastics Championships was held in Medellín, Colombia, and was attended by artistic and rhythmic gymnasts. In 1995, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) recognized aerobic gymnastics (then sport aerobics) as a new competitive gymnastics discipline. The first edition of the Pan American Aerobic Gymnastics Championships was held in Mérida, Venezuela, in 1999. \nThe FIG recognized two new gymnastics disciplines, acrobatic gymnastics, as well as trampoline and tumbling, in 1999. In 2004, the Pan American Trampoline and Tumbling Championships was organized for the first time in Tampa, United States. The first edition of the Pan American Acrobatic Gymnastics Championships was organized in 2015. In 2018, parkour was introduced by the FIG as a gymnastics discipline. To date, no Pan American Championships in parkour have been held.\nPan American championships also exist for the sport of aesthetic group gymnastics, a discipline not recognized by the FIG, organized, instead, by the International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (IFAGG). The first edition of the tournament was organized in 2017, in Mérida, Mexico.\nJunior editions.\nThe first edition of the Pan American Championships for youth and junior gymnasts was originally scheduled to take place in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, in 1986, but was ultimately postponed to February 1987."

        "text": "The 2016 Dubai World Cup was a horse race held at Meydan Racecourse on Saturday 26 March 2016. It was the 21st running of the Dubai World Cup. It was the second running of the race since the synthetic Tapeta surface was replaced by a dirt track.\nThe winner was California Chrome LLC's California Chrome, a five-year-old chestnut horse trained in the United States by Art Sherman and ridden by Victor Espinoza. California Chrome's victory was the first in the race for his jockey, trainer and owner.\nThe contenders.\nThe race attracted a strong North American challenge headed by the 2014 American Horse of the Year California Chrome, who had finished second in the race in 2015. The other runners from the United States were Keen Ice, Frosted (Wood Memorial Stakes, Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 2, second in the Belmont Stakes), Mshawish (Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap, Donn Handicap) and Hoppertunity (Clark Handicap). The United Arab Emirates was represented by Mubtaahij (UAE Derby), Special Fighter (Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 3) and Candy Boy (fourth in the 2015 race). The Japanese dirt specialist Hokku Tarumae ran in the race for the third time, whilst the other three runners were Vadamos from France, Gun Pit from Hong Kong and Teletext from Saudi Arabia.\nBetting is illegal in Dubai, but British bookmakers made California Chrome and Frosted the 15/8 joint favourites ahead of Mshawish (9/1), Special Fighter (10/1) and Keen Ice (12/1).\nThe race.\nFrankie Dettori sent Mshawish into the lead from the start and set the pace, with California Chrome (on the outside), Mubtaahij (on the rail) and Special Fighter close behind. There was little change in the order until the final turn although Frosted made progress to join the leading group. California Chrome overtook the tiring Mshawish early in the straight and quickly opened up a clear advantage. Mubtaahij, Special Fighter and Frosted maintained their positions without being able to quicken and Hoppertunity made rapid progress from the rear of the field. California Chrome crossed the finish line three and three-quarter lengths clear of Mubtaahij who was a neck in front of Hoppertunity whilst Special Fighter took fourth place just ahead of Frosted, Mshawish and Candy Boy. Keen Ice finished eighth ahead of Hokko Tarumae, with the other three runners tailed off. Impressively, California Chrome won despite his saddle slipping badly in deep stretch, which compromised Espinoza's ability to safely control his mount.\nWinner's details.\nFurther details of the winner, California Chrome"

Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It featured the East Regional Champion and defending national champion, overall #1 seed Duke versus the Southeast Regional Champion, #6-seeded Michigan. \nDuke defeated Fab Five-led Michigan 71-51 to become the sixth school to repeat as national champions and were the last to repeat until the Florida Gators in 2006 and 2007.\nThis marked the first of what is currently four consecutive losses in the national championship game for the Wolverines, as Michigan would lose in the championship game again in 1993, as well as in 2013 and 2018.\nGame summary.\nSource:\nMedia coverage.\nThe championship game was televised in the United States by CBS. Jim Nantz provided play-by-play, while Billy Packer provided color commentary.\nAftermath.\nMichigan would later vacate it’s appearance in both the 1992 and 1993 Final Four and their subsequent title games due to issues found with the eligibility of Chris Webber in the Ed Martin scandal. While the other members of the Fab Five were cleared of any wrongdoing, the group’s reputation was nonetheless tarnished by the scandal.\n1992 marked the start of a losing streak in the national championship game for the Wolverines. Michigan would lose in the championship game again in 1993, as well as in 2013 and 2018, which brought their record in the title game to 1-6, the worst record among teams that have previously won a championship.\nDuke would return to the national championship game in 1994, but they would fall to Arkansas. The Blue Devils would win their next championship in 2001 against Arizona."

Freshman Miles Bridges made a good first impression, totaling 33 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Freshman big man Nick Ward also performed well, scoring 19 points in 21 minutes of play. Cassius Winston, also a freshman, netted nine points and nine assists. Kenny Goins and Lourawls \"Tum Tum\" Nairn Jr. added eight points each. Freshamn Josh Langford did not play due to a hamstring issue. Izzo seemed disappointed with the team's first half defensive performance, calling on the lack of effort in defense and rebounding.\nOn November 2, 2016, the Spartans defeated Saginaw Valley State, ranked No. 4 in Division II, 87–77 in their final exhibition game. Miles Bridges again performed well, scoring 20 points with seven rebounds and four blocks. Cassius Winston added 18 points and six assists and Eron Harris had 14 points and nine rebounds. Matt McQuaid added 12 points and Nick Ward had six with three rebounds. Josh Langford did not play again due to his hamstring injury. Izzo was again disappointed with the teams inconsistency, praising their early defense, but disappointed as the Spartans allowed Saginaw Valley State to close the lead.\nRegular season.\nNon-conference regular season.\nThe Spartans faced a difficult non-conference schedule that included travel of over 13,000 miles and playing eight games in 22 days. The Spartans also faced four ranked teams in the non-conference schedule and lost all four games. In their first eight games, they played only two home games.\nNovember.\nThe Spartans traveled to Hawaii to face No. 10 Arizona on November 11 to open the regular season. The Spartans wore wear special black camo uniforms for the game. The Spartans started well, jumping out to an early 17–2 lead over the Wildcats. Miles Bridges made some spectacular dunks, played 37 minutes and led the Spartans in scoring with 21, but MSU struggled offensively after its good start allowing Arizona to take the lead at the half. However, after the struggles, the Spartans were able to tie the game with seven seconds remaining on a \"Tum Tum\" Nairn three-pointer. Arizona however took the ball down the court and hit a layup with a little over a second left to win the game 65–63. Izzo was frustrated with his team's play, especially foul troubles and commented that he \"played [Bridges] too much\". Michigan State struggled with foul trouble as Cassisus Winston, Eron Harris, Joshua Langford, and Nairn each had three.\nThe Spartans traveled to New York to play No. 2 Kentucky in the Champions Classic on November 16. The Spartans started well, leading for portions of the early minutes of the game, but the talented Wildcats soon took over and routed the Spartans 69–48. Bridges struggled immensely in the game, looking like a freshman as he turned the ball over nine times and scored only six points. Senior guard Eron Harris was pulled early from the game after not giving enough effort and only played 13 minutes. Kenny Goins led the Spartans with nine points and Bridges added 12 rebounds, but the Spartans were no match for Kentucky. Bridges apologized to Izzo following the game saying it wouldn't happen again. Izzo stated that he was \"a little embarrassed\" at the team's offensive play. The Spartans moved to 0–2 on the season, the first time they had started the season 0–2 since 2011 when they lost their first two games to No. 1 North Carolina and No. 6 Duke.\nMSU opened its home season on November 18 versus Mississippi Valley State. Looking to rebound from their early rough start, the Spartans struggled offensively early in the game. However, MSU took over quickly as Bridges dunked and shot the Spartans to a 48–23 lead at the half while scoring 21 points in the half. Bridges finished with 24 points, 11 rebounds, and six assists as MSU rolled over the Delta Devils, 100–53. Eron Harris added 19 points, Nick Ward had 18, and Matt McQuaid finished with 15 points. The Spartans moved to 1–2 on the season.\nTwo days later, the Spartans welcomed Florida Gulf Coast to the Breslin Center. This game was far from a laugher, however. Harris led the Spartans with 33 points, but missed two free throws in the waning seconds to give FGCU a chance to win. Florida Gulf Coast needed a basket with 1.6 seconds left to win it, but as the ball was in-bounded, the clock started early, before any player had touched it, resulting in the buzzer going off as Gulf Coast's Antravious Simmons attempted a last second shot. The play was reviewed, but the officials ruled that it could not be replayed, only that had Simmons' shot gone in, it would have counted despite the clock. Izzo lamented that his team looked soft as they were outrebounded 41–29. The 78–77 win put the Spartans at 2–2 on the season as they traveled to the Bahamas for the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament.\nIn the first game of the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament on November 23, the Spartans faced St. John's. Miles Bridges was again the star for the Spartans, scoring 22 points and adding 15 rebounds as the Spartans pulled away from the St. John's in the second half. Eron Harris added 14 points and \"Tum Tum\" Nairn tied his career high with 13 including a breakaway slam dunk and three three-pointers. The Spartans won 73–62 to advance to the tournament semifinals against Baylor. Izzo was still concerned with his team's play, stating that \"It's still not smooth for us. It may not be for a while.\"\nIn the semifinals the next day, the Spartans faced No. 20-ranked Baylor. The Spartans started well and played a good first half, leading 33–30. Izzo changed his starting lineup for the first time, moving Matt McQuaid to the bench and starting Josh Langford. McQuaid answered by hitting two early three-pointers, but in the second half, the Spartans appeared to tire. Baylor pulled away easily as the Spartans could not answer their inside game. The Bears won easily, 73–58, forcing the Spartans to the third place game against Wichita State. After the game, Izzo apologized to his team for the schedule. He said that the schedule allowed for little practice time and hurt his players' development.\nIn the third place game on November 24, Izzo again started Langford in place of McQuaid and the Spartans, for the second straight game, started well. At the half, the Spartans led by 10. The lead blossomed to as many as 18 in the second half as Bridges scored 21 and Harris added 13. However, the Shockers fought back to within a basket, but the Spartans hit free throws down the line to pull out the 77–72 victory. The win moved the Spartans to 4–3 on the season.\nFollowing the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, the Spartans fell from the top-25 rankings in both polls and would remain unranked the remainder of the season.\nOn November 29, the Spartans traveled to Cameron Indoor Stadium to take on No. 5-ranked Duke as part of the Big Ten–ACC Challenge. The Spartans played well for the majority of the game holding the lead on several occasions and were tied at the half. However, Duke's talent was too much and the Spartans fell 78–69. Izzo was encouraged by his team's play, \"I thought we played probably 33, (34) of good basketball against a good team, especially on the road.\" Michigan State's 18 turnovers were their undoing. Eron Harris had 14 points for MSU and Miles Bridges added 11 points and eight rebounds, but Izzo fell to 1–10 all time against Duke. Izzo added \"But make no mistake about it, we got better tonight. We got a lot better tonight.\"\nDecember.\nThe Spartans returned to East Lansing to play five straight home games to end the non-conference slate.\nOn December 1, Tom Izzo announced that Miles Bridges would miss \"as least a couple of weeks\" due an injured ankle. Izzo also announced that Ben Carter would not play this season and that Gavin Schilling was still some time away from being ready to play, if at all, this year.\nOn December 3, in their first game without Bridges, the Spartans struggled mightily with one-win Oral Roberts. Kyle Ahrens received the start in Bridges' place, but MSU started slow. Freshman Nick Ward carried the Spartans, scoring a career-high 24 and adding 10 rebounds. But, the Spartans struggled defensively with ORU's size and were outrebounded and outscored in the paint. Izzo was again disappointed in his team, \"Our energy level was not very good,\" Izzo said. \"Don’t be fooled by scoring…We did not play very smart.\" The Spartans were able to pull out the victory 80–76 thanks in part to Cassius Winston's nine assists and 15 points. The win moved the Spartans to 5–4 on the season.\nYoungstown State visited East Lansing on December 6 as the Spartans played their second game without Bridges. The other three freshmen led the way for the Spartans though as Joshua Langford scored a career-high 15 points, Nick Ward added 13 points, and Cassius Winston scored eight points and dished out nine assists. Izzo enjoyed the performance by the freshmen, especially Winston, saying, \"He took a big step tonight.\" The Spartans played well defensively as well and pulled away from the Penguins to win 77–57 and move to 6–4 on the season.\nOn December 10, Tennessee Tech visited Breslin to face the Spartans who were without Bridges for the third straight game, but were also without Matt McQuaid due to a head injury suffered in practice. The Spartans started well, led by Eron Harris who scored 20 points including five three-pointers to lead the Spartans to as big as an 18-point lead. MSU played sloppy at points, but still pulled out the win, 71–63, to move to 7–4 on the season.\nAfter eight days off for final exams, the Spartans welcomed Northeastern to East Lansing. MSU struggled from the start in their fourth game without Bridges. They trailed throughout the first half as Northeastern took advantage of their superior size. The Spartans regained the lead in the middle of the second half, led by Cassius Winston who finished with 21 points and 10 assists. However, Harris and many other Spartans struggled and Michigan State fell at home 71–63, falling to 7–5 with one non-conference game remaining. MSU struggled again from the free throw line and was shooting only 61% from the line on the season.\nIn the final non-conference foe of the season for the Spartans, Oakland, having lost to Northeastern the night before, visited the Breslin Center on December 21. Izzo again shook up the starting lineup as the Spartans were without Miles Bridges for a fifth straight game, starting three freshmen, Joshua Langford, Nick Ward, and Cassius Winston. Led by Ward's career-high 25 points, the Spartans were able to pull away from Oakland in the second half to win 77–65. Eron Harris added 15 points while Winston finished with nine points and eight assists. The win capped off a disappointing non-conference schedule with MSU at 8–5 on the season.\nBig Ten regular season.\nDecember.\nOn December 26, Tom Izzo announced that Miles Bridges was unlikely to play in the Big Ten opener versus Minnesota. He also announced that \"Tum Tum\" Nairn was also in a walking boot, but that he had not missed any practice time.\nOn December 27, the Spartans traveled to Minneapolis, Minnesota to open the Big Ten schedule against Minnesota. Without Bridges, Izzo started his three healthy freshman again. However, MSU shot the ball poorly in the first half and fell behind by as many as 15 points and trailed by 13 at the half. In the second half, the Spartans rallied behind Nick Ward's 22 points and 10 rebounds. Alvin Ellis III added a career-high 20 points as the Spartans and Gophers remained tied at the end of regulation. In overtime, \"Tum Tum\" Nairn hit his second three-pointer of the game to give him 13 points for the game, tying a career-high, but the Spartans still trailed by one with less than 20 seconds remaining. However, Ellis was fouled with 10.6 seconds remaining and made both free throws to give the Spartans a 75–74 lead. Minnesota's last second shot was wide and the Spartans completed the come-from-behind victory to move to 1–0 in conference and 9–5 on the season. Izzo was proud of his team after the game saying, \"We found a way to win a game with some toughness. This team hasn’t done that all year.”\nOn December 30, the Spartans returned to Breslin Center to face Northwestern, winners of nine in a row. MSU started out hot, leading by as many as 19 early in the first half. The Spartans kept up the pressure in the second half, but Northwestern twice narrowed the lead to four points. But, led by Ellis' 16 points, the Spartans were able to hold off the Wildcats, to win 61–52. Cassius Winston added 15 points and six assists while Nick Ward added 11 points and nine rebounds. The win moved MSU to 10–5 on the season and 2–0 in conference.\nJanuary.\nOn January 2, 2017, Tom Izzo announced that Miles Bridges would return to action on January 4 against Rutgers though he would not start.\nRutgers visited Breslin Center and started well, opening up an early 6–0 lead on the Spartans. But, the Spartans answered and Bridges, who did not start, scored on an alley-oop dunk 16 seconds after entering the game. Eron Harris led the way for the Spartans, scoring a Big-Ten-career-high of 24 points and the Spartans ran away with the game. Bridges again had a highlight-reel dunk on an alley-oop from Cassius Winston, who had eight assists, in the second half following his block of a Rutgers shot. Nick Ward added 15 points and Matt McQuaid added 12 for the Spartans in the 93–65 rout. The win was the fourth in a row for the Spartans as they moved to 11–5 on the season and 3–0 in conference. Bridges ended up with six points and six rebounds in 17 minutes after missing seven games.\nOn January 7, the Spartans started all four freshmen as they visited the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to take on Penn State. The Spartans started out slow again in the game which was technically a neutral site game as Penn State gave up a home game to play at the Palestra. Izzo said he was embarrassed by MSU's performance in the first half: \"We guarded nobody, played with no energy and I was totally frustrated with the way we played. … This was humiliating for me in this great city and great basketball venue and our players did not play and I did not have them ready to play. So the whole thing falls on me. I’m tired of explaining why I don’t see any light at the end of the tunnel. I see us getting better and the minute I say it we take that for granted.\" The Spartans, led by Nick Ward's 16 points, trailed by 12 at the half and were never able to even the score in the second half. As a result, the Spartans fell 72–63, falling to 11–6 overall and 3–1 in Big Ten play.\nFollowing the loss to Penn State, the Spartans returned home to face the newly ranked No. 24 Minnesota on January 11. The Gophers had not lost since losing to the Spartans in overtime to open the Big Ten schedule. The Spartans wore \"throwback\" uniforms that featured the school's first name, Michigan Agricultural College. Cassius Winston was the lone freshman who did not start the game as \"Tum Tum\" Nairn joined Eron Harris in the starting lineup. Miles Bridges and Nick Ward led the Spartans in the first half as MSU jumped up early on Minnesota and used a 15–0 stretch to end the first half with a 22-point lead. Minnesota was only able to muster 17 first half points as the Spartan defense clamped down. Bridges scored all of his game-high 16 points in the first half as he looked to be fully into the game. Minnesota was only able to get the lead under 20 three times in the second half as the Spartans cruised to a 65–47 victory. Ward scored nine points with eight rebounds in 13 minutes before fouling out. Joshua Langford added 13 points as the Spartans remained in first place in the Big Ten with a 4–1 record, 12–6 overall. The win marked Tom Izzo's 250th win in Big Ten play.\nLooking to stay in first place in Big Ten play, MSU headed to Columbus, Ohio to take on Ohio State who was 0–4 in Big Ten play. The Spartans started well, jumping to an early 12–5 lead over the Buckeyes. However, OSU responded with several runs in the first half to take a 36–33 lead at the half. In the second half, the teams traded leads, but MSU could not stop Ohio State and fell 72–67. Bridges led the Spartans with 24 points and nine rebounds, but turned the ball over six times. No other Spartan scored in double figures. Cassius Winston, one point and two assists in 11 minutes of play, and Nick Ward, nine points, four rebounds, and four fouls in 18 minutes, both struggled for the Spartans. The Spartans fell out of first place at 4–2 and 12–7 overall.\nAfter a week off, MSU returned to the road to face Indiana who had just learned they would be without star player OG Anunoby for the remainder of the season. Indiana started off extremely well, led by James Blackmon's 18 points in the first half. The Spartans struggled defensively as IU took the halftime lead, 44–30. Indiana kept the hot shooting going early in the second half pushing the lead to as many as 20. However, MSU, behind Eron Harris' 21 points and a play-making Cassius Winston, fought back to within four points with five minutes remaining with a 24–10 stretch over 10 minutes. The comeback was not enough as the Hoosiers were able to hold on for the 82–75 victory. The loss left MSU at 12–8 overall and 4–3 in the Big Ten.\nAs the Spartans returned home looking to avoid their third straight loss, No. 20 Purdue paid a visit to East Lansing. MSU played well, taking an eight-point lead near the end of the first half, but gave up the lead. However, Miles Bridges hit a layup as time expired to tie the game at 39 at halftime. MSU's small front line struggled mightily against a much bigger Purdue team and MSU had three players with two fouls at halftime. In the second half, Purdue's size proved be too much for the Spartans pulling away late in the game to win 84–73. Bridges set the MSU single-game record for scoring by a freshman with 33 points, but no other Spartan scored in double figures. Caleb Swanigan led the Boilermakers, scoring 25 and adding 17 rebounds. The Spartans were outrebounded in the game 36–23. The loss gave the Spartans their third straight leaving their record at 12–9 and 4–4 in conference.\nLooking to break out of a three-game losing streak, the Spartans welcomed rival Michigan to the Breslin Center. The teams exchanged runs and leads in the first half and MSU went to the break with a 32–28 lead. MSU played suffocating defense in the first and good defense in the second, holding Michigan to 26.9% from the three-point line in the game and 33.9% overall. Bridges again played well, though he didn't shoot well, as he totaled 15 points and 13 rebounds. Winston led the Spartans with 16 points including 10–11 from the free throw line. But, Matt McQuaid, who'd struggled most of the year, hit three big three-pointers and MSU made 73% of its free throws to pull out the tough 70–62 win. Ward added 13 points for the Spartans as they ended their three-game losing streak and moved to 13–9 overall and 5–4 in the Big Ten. The win marked MSU's fifth straight win over Michigan.\nFebruary.\nMSU next traveled to Lincoln, Nebraska on February 2 to attempt to end their road losing streak by facing Nebraska. Nebraska, winners of three straight against the Spartans, was coming off a come-from-behind win over Purdue who had defeated MSU the previous week. The Spartans' Kenny Goins started in place of Nick Ward even though both were suffering from the flu. Both Goins and Ward performed well, each scoring 10 points. Bridges, as usual, led the Spartans with 16 points as MSU's hot shooting behind the arc helped them pull away and lead by as many as 20 in the second half. Cassius Winston and Alvin Ellis combined to make five of six three-pointers (scoring 10 apiece), and Josh Langford hit his three shots from behind the arc to total 9 points as the Spartans made 11 of 18 three-pointers, shooting 64.7% from three. MSU's defense also did the job again, limiting Nebraska to 38.5% from the field as the Spartans won 72–61. The win was the first on the road for the Spartans since December 27. Izzo commented on the win, \"We're getting better but we’ve got a long way to go.” MSU moved to 14–9 overall and 6–4 in Big Ten play.\nOn February 7, the Spartans traveled for a rematch against Michigan in Ann Arbor. In what was perhaps a must-win for Michigan, the Wolverines left no doubt, blowing out the Spartans 86–57. MSU turned the ball over 21 times, 12 times in the first half, as Michigan used a 14–2 run to end the first half and take a 55–29 lead at the half. Things got no better for the Spartans in the second half as Michigan pushed the lead to as high as 30. Cassius Winston turned the ball over six times while Miles Bridges turned it over five times. Nick Ward was whistled for a technical for tripping a Michigan player during a dead ball as the Spartans fell apart. Bridges led the Spartans with 15 points and Ward added 13, but MSU's defense struggled allowing Michigan to shoot 75 percent from the field in the first half. The 29-point loss tied for the worst loss MSU has suffered to Michigan under Tom Izzo and moved the Spartans to 14–10 overall and 6–5 in the Big Ten.\nLooking to rebound from their embarrassing loss against Michigan, the Spartans welcomed Iowa, who had swept the Spartans the previous year, to the Breslin Center. MSU continued to struggle with turnovers, committing 12 turnovers in the first half. Miles Bridges led the Spartans, scoring 14 of his game-high 16 points in the first half, and kept MSU close as they trailed 32–31 at the half. In the second half, MSU's hot shooting and suffocating defense allowed the Spartans to pull away, leading by as many as 16. For the first time this season, all four MSU freshmen, Bridges, Joshua Langford, Nick Ward, and Cassius Winson, each scored in double figures. Bridges added 11 rebounds for his fifth double-double of the season. The Spartan defense held the Big Ten's leading scorer, Peter Jok, to 2-for-11 shooting and limited him to 13 points. The 77–66 win put MSU at 15–10 and 7–5 in sole possession of fifth place in the Big Ten.\nOn Valentine's Day, MSU welcomed Ohio State, who had beaten the Spartans a month earlier, to the Breslin Center. Senior Alvin Ellis III led the Spartans, scoring 15 straight points on five straight three-pointers in the first half, giving MSU the halftime lead 40–34. Ellis would add a sixth three-pointer in the second half to lead MSU for the game with 18 points. MSU stretched the lead to 12 early in the second half, before the Buckeyes fought back. Every time MSU attempted to take control of the game, OSU fought back. However, led by freshmen Miles Bridges' 14 points in the second half and a ferocious dunk by Joshua Langford, the Spartans were able to answer and hold on to their lead. Cassius Winston dished out nine assists and added eight points while Nick Ward added 15 points. The Spartans pulled out the must-win game, 74–65. The win, their fourth in five games, moved MSU closer to a near-certainty for the NCAA Tournament at 16–10, 8–5 in conference.\nMSU next took to the road to face Purdue again on February 18. As in the first game, MSU had no answer for Purdue's big men, Caleb Swanigan and Isaac Haas. The Spartans also struggled offensively and with fouls. Kenny Goins and Nick Ward, MSU's big men, fouled out early in the second half as Purdue rolled. To add insult to injury, Eron Harris was carted off the floor after what ended up being a season-ending knee injury with eight minutes remaining in the game. Miles Bridges led the Spartans again with 14 points, but 11 of those came in the second half when the game was already decided. Swanigan had 24 points and 15 rebounds for the Boilermakers and Haas added 18 points. The 80–63 loss dropped MSU to 8–6 in conference and 16–11 overall.\nIn their first game without Eron Harris, Nebraska visited the Breslin Center while Alvin Ellis started in Harris' spot. Both teams started slow and MSU led 28–26 before the Spartans went on a 21–5 run to end the half. The run included a Cassius Winston assist off the glass to Miles Bridges after a steal by Winston and a half-court shot by Winston as the half expired, putting MSU up 49–31. The rout continued in the second half as Michigan State pushed the lead to as much as 24 while Nebraska could not get within 14. Bridges and Nick Ward each had 20 points marking the first time since January 5, 1978, when Magic Johnson and Jay Vincent did it, that MSU had two freshmen score 20 points in a game. Josh Langford added 17 points, a career high, while Winston had nine assists and seven points. Together the Spartan freshmen combined for 64 points and 20 rebounds in the game. The 88–72 win put MSU at 9–6 in conference and in a fourth place tie with Northwestern and Minnesota, both of whom MSU owned the tiebreaker over. With three games remaining in the season, MSU's record stood at 17–11.\nOn Senior Day, the Spartans were looking to remove themselves from the NCAA Tournament bubble and continue their streak of NCAA Tournament appearances. MSU had a chance for a signature win as they welcomed No. 16 Wisconsin to East Lansing. An early lead gave MSU a jump as they led by as many as 13 in the first half. However, foul trouble to Nick Ward and Miles Bridges led to a big run by Wisconsin in the final few minutes of the half and put the Badgers within one at the half. MSU, however, countered in the second half and controlled the half led by Ward's 20 points and nine rebounds. Matt McQuaid contributed for the Spartans as well, scoring 15 points mostly on drives to the basket. Miles Bridges added 15 and Cassius Winston added 10 points and nine assists as the Spartans pulled away. In the waning seconds of the game with MSU comfortably ahead, Tom Izzo sent the injured Eron Harris on the court so that he could get his opportunity as a senior to kiss the Spartan logo on the court. Izzo had McQuaid travel with the ball with less than five seconds remaining so the crowd could cheer Harris on as he kissed the Spartan logo. The big win by MSU, 84–74, likely secured MSU's NCAA Tournament appearance with two regular season games remaining. The win put MSU at 18–11 and 10–6 and put them in a three-way tie for third place in the Big Ten with Minnesota and Maryland, over whom MSU held the tiebreakers.\nMarch.\nLooking to improve their NCAA Tournament position and remain off the bubble, the Spartans traveled to Champaign on March 1 to visit an Illinois team who was looking to get into the bubble discussion. MSU started well, but Illinois answered and took the half time lead. MSU kept it close in the second half, but trailed for most of it. Miles Bridges led the Spartans with 21 points and Alvin Ellis added 15 (13 of which came in the second half). MSU struggled inside as their lack of depth allowed Maverick Morgan to score 14 points, most over Kenny Goins. Illinois also hit 11 three-pointers as the Spartans turned the ball over 15 times. Still, MSU had a chance to tie it on two separate occasions, but a Bridges shot with less than 10 seconds remaining and Nairn's last second heave missed the mark and Spartans fell 73–70. The loss knocked the Spartans back into a fifth place tie at 10–7 in conference and left the NCAA Tournament streak still in question at 18–12.\nWith a chance to secure the No. 3 seed in the Big Ten tournament on March 3, Michigan State traveled to Maryland to end the regular season with a chance at a double bye in the Big Ten tournament. MSU played well in the first half, but foul trouble, three for Kenny Goins and two for Nick Ward, left their lead at only one at halftime. In the second half, Maryland led most of the way, but MSU turned to Nick Ward to keep it close. Ward's 22 points and career-high 16 rebounds left the Spartans tied with less than a 30 seconds remaining in the game. However, MSU went scoreless for the final 3:11 of the game and Ward could not handle Cassius Winston's pass for a layup to take the lead. Maryland's Melo Trimble hit a three-pointer with 1.1 seconds remaining to give Maryland the win and the No. 3 seed in the Big Ten tournament. Miles Bridges' 18 points and eight rebounds were not enough as MSU would have to wait to see where they would end up as a seed in the Big Ten tournament. The loss put MSU at 18–13 on the season and 10–8 in conference.\nFollowing action on the final day of the regular season, the Spartans received the No. 5 seed in the Big Ten tournament finishing in a tie for fifth place in Big Ten play.\nBig Ten tournament.\nAs the No. 5 seed in the Big Ten tournament, MSU was set to face Penn State in the second round on March 9, 2017. Looking to keep its streak of appearing in every Big Ten tournament quarterfinals round ever, MSU traveled to Washington, D.C. to take on the Nittany Lions. MSU jumped up quickly on Penn State with a 12–0 run in the first half and dominated the game. They held Penn State to 29 percent from the field and outrebounded them 44–29. Miles Bridges and Nick Ward each had 15 points and nine rebounds as they won easily 78–51. With the win, MSU moved to the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament to face Minnesota.\nHaving beaten Minnesota twice in the regular season, the Spartans looked to do it a third time, but Minnesota fought hard in the game. Led by Reggie Lynch's 16 points, the Golden Gophers were able to hold off the Spartans 63–58. MSU's freshmen struggled, according to Tom Izzo, and Cassius Winston played less than four minutes in the second half. Nick Ward, who scored 15 points and added 11 rebounds, only played 20 minutes. Miles Bridges scored 20 for the Spartans, but was only 2–11 from beyond the arc. With the loss, the Spartans had to wait to see their fate for the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA Tournament.\nThe Spartans received a No. 9 seed in the Midwest region of the NCAA Tournament. The bid marked the Spartans 20th consecutive trip to the tournament, the fourth-longest streak ever, and third-longest active streak. In the First Round against No. 8-seeded Miami, the Spartans fell behind early, trailing 10–0 and 17–5. However, MSU came alive, closing the first half on a 30–8 run to take a 12-point lead into halftime. MSU kept the play up in the second half moving the lead to as many as 23 over the Hurricanes. The freshmen led the way for the Spartans as Miles Bridges, Nick Ward, Joshua Langford, and Cassius Winston combined for 57 points, 19 rebounds, nine assists, and two turnovers. Ward had 19 points, Bridges 18, and Langford contributed 13 as the Spartans blew out the Hurricanes 78–58 to advance to the Second Round. Izzo called the last 30 minutes of play the best the Spartans had played all year.\nIn the Second Round, No. 1-seeded Kansas awaited the Spartans. MSU played hard and exchanged the lead with Jayhawks for most of the first half. In the second half, MSU still held strong, trailing by five points with seven minutes remaining. However, Kansas' experience took over as a close game turned into a 20-point win for the Jayhawks. Miles Bridges, in perhaps his final game as a Spartan, left the game early in the first half with a hip injury, but returned and scored 22 points to lead the Spartans. Nick Ward added 13 points, but suffered foul trouble that limited his effectiveness. The loss ended MSU's season with a 20–15 record.\nRoster.\nThe remaining scholarship was given to senior and former walk-on Matt Van Dyk.\n \n \nDepth chart.\nSource\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\nPlayer statistics.\nSource"

        "text": "The 2021 FIFA Futsal World Cup was the ninth edition of the FIFA Futsal World Cup, the quadrennial international futsal championship contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The tournament was held in Lithuania. It marked the first FIFA tournament ever hosted by Lithuania and the third Futsal World Cup hosted in Europe; the others being 1989 in the Netherlands and 1996 in Spain.\nThe tournament was originally scheduled to be held from 12 September to 4 October 2020 as the 2020 FIFA Futsal World Cup. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, FIFA announced on 3 April 2020 that a decision would be made whether the tournament would be postponed and rescheduled. On 12 May 2020, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held between 12 September and 3 October 2021, subject to further monitoring.\nIn the final, Portugal defeated the defending champions Argentina 2–1 to win their first World Cup title. They became the fourth team to win the competition, the second from Europe after Spain's triumphs in 2000 and 2004.\nHost selection.\nThe following countries bid for the tournament:\nThe eight bidders represent the highest ever for the FIFA Futsal World Cup. Since none of these countries have ever hosted the event before, the tournament will be heading to a new location, later shortlisted to four. The Czech Republic, Egypt, Georgia, the Netherlands and the United States expressed interest but eventually did not bid.\nThe host were originally to be appointed by December 2016, then delayed to December 2017. Costa Rica, Croatia, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates were later eliminated from contention.\nThe hosts were selected by the FIFA Council on 26 October 2018 in Kigali, Rwanda from the final four candidates: Iran, Japan, Lithuania and New Zealand. Lithuania was chosen over Iran, Japan and New Zealand as host for the 2020 edition.\nQualification.\nA total of 24 teams from six separate continental competitions qualified for the final tournament, in addition to hosts Lithuania. The slot allocation was approved by the FIFA Council on 10 June 2018.\nVenues.\nLithuania presented three cities – Vilnius (Avia Solutions Group Arena), Kaunas (Žalgiris Arena) and Klaipėda (Švyturys Arena) in their bid to host the event. During press conference on 22 November 2018 it was revealed that the Lithuanian Football Federation would like to expand number of host cities with up to 3 additional locations. Šiauliai (Šiauliai Arena), Panevėžys (Cido Arena) and Alytus (Alytus Arena) were named as additional candidates and are currently awaiting for a FIFA delegates inspection to determine their suitability. Further negotiations should resume in February 2019. An inspection was done on 10 May 2019 on all five potential host cities: Vilnius (Siemens Arena), Kaunas (Žalgiris Arena), Klaipėda (Švyturys Arena), Šiauliai (Šiauliai Arena) and Panevėžys (Cido Arena).\nThe final decision was made on 16 October 2019, it will be staged in three cities: Vilnius (Avia Solutions Group Arena), Kaunas (Žalgiris Arena) and Klaipėda (Švyturys Arena). Šiauliai (Šiauliai Arena) and Panevėžys (Cido Arena) were left out due to accommodation hotel concerns.\nMarketing.\nThe Emblem was launched on 17 January 2020 at the MO Museum in Vilnius.\nThe emblem highlights two of Lithuania's proudest features: its natural resources and technological expertise. The base of the emblem represents the country's lush, green landscape, decorated with oak leaves. A symbol of strength, the native oak has been venerated in Lithuania for centuries. Following the lines of the FIFA Futsal World Cup Trophy, oaks give way to farmland and meadows in the colours of the Lithuanian flag. The prominence given to the landscape highlights Lithuania's commitment to the preservation of its natural heritage.\nThe top half of the emblem is inspired by Lithuania's modern technological industries. Lasers shoot skywards towards a stylised futsal pitch as a reminder of the country's accomplishments in the science and high-tech industries.\nOn 21 September 2020, Ivartito, a stork (which is the national bird of Lithuania since 1973), was unveiled as the official mascot.\nDraw.\nThe official draw was held on 1 June 2021, 17:00 CEST (), at the FIFA headquarters in Zürich, Switzerland. The 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four teams. The hosts Lithuania were automatically seeded into Pot 1 and assigned to position A1, while the remaining teams were seeded into their respective pots based on their results in the last five FIFA Futsal World Cups (more recent tournaments weighted more heavily), with bonus points awarded to confederation champions. No group could contain more than one team from each confederation, except there would be one group with two UEFA teams due to there being seven UEFA teams in total.\nMatch officials.\nThe following officials were chosen for the tournament.\nSquads.\nEach team has to name a preliminary squad of a maximum of 25 players (3 of whom must be goalkeepers). From the preliminary squad, the team has to name a final squad of 14 players (two of whom must be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. Players in the final squad can be replaced by a player from the preliminary squad due to serious injury or illness up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.\nGroup stage.\nThe schedule of the competition was released on 30 April 2021.\nThe top two teams of each group and the four best third-placed teams advance to the round of 16.\nThe rankings of teams in each group are determined as follows:\nIf two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings are determined as follows:\nAll times are local, EEST ().\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match is level at the end of normal playing time, extra time shall be played (two periods of five minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by kicks from the penalty mark to determine the winner. However, for the third place match, if it is played directly before the final, no extra time shall be played and the winner shall be determined by kicks from the penalty mark.\nBracket.\nThe specific match-ups involving the third-placed teams depend on which four third-placed teams qualified for the round of 16:"

        "text": "Ivan Andy \"Ike\" Williams (April 23, 1902 – April 18, 1988) was an American gridiron football player of the 1920s. He played college football for Georgia Tech and later had a brief professional career.\nBiography.\nWilliams was born in 1902 in Marshall, Oklahoma, and attended Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. He played high school football with his brother, Orval, and Doug Wycoff—all three entered the Georgia School of Technology (Georgia Tech). Williams played for the Georgia Tech football team during the one-platoon system era, and was a three-time letterman (1923–1925). Williams was primarily a halfback during his sophomore and junior seasons; he was named to the 1923 College Football All-Southern Team by John Francis of the \"Courier Journal\" of Louisville, Kentucky. Williams played quarterback as a senior; he was also a placekicker. In the 1925 Georgia–Georgia Tech football rivalry game, a third-quarter field goal by Williams was the only scoring in the game, giving Georgia Tech a 3–0 victory.\nAt Georgia Tech, Williams was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and the Delta Sigma Pi honorary fraternity; he was selected vice-president of his sophomore class, president of his junior class, and vice-president of his senior class; he also was a member of the school's glee club.\nWilliams played professional football with the 1926 Newark Bears in the first American Football League (AFL), with several other former Georgia Tech players including Jimmy Brewster, Vaughan Connelly, and Wycoff. He later played for the 1929 Staten Island Stapletons of the National Football League (NFL). In his season with the Stapleton, he suffered a season-ending injury against the New York Giants.\nAt the time he registered for the draft, in February 1942, Williams was living in Wayne, Michigan, and was working for Ford Motor Company. In August 1942, he married Charlotte Bell Swingle of Urbana, Ohio. Williams went on to own and operate a seed company in Urbana, and served as president of the Ohio Seed Association. Williams died in 1988 at his residence in Kettering, Ohio; he was survived by his wife and two daughters."

        "text": "The Pegasus World Cup Invitational Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race whose first running was on January 28, 2017 at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach, Florida. It is run over the dirt at the distance of miles (9 furlongs) and is open to horses four years old and up. The Grade I rating was assumed from the Donn Handicap.\nWith a purse of $12 million for its inaugural running, the Pegasus World Cup surpassed the Dubai World Cup as the richest horse race in the world for the year 2017 &amp; 2018. The purse of the event rose to $16 million in 2018, but dropped to $9 million in 2019. The fourth running of the Pegasus World Cup in 2020 carried a $3 million purse. The entry fee structure has also changed over time, from $1 million in 2017 and 2018, to $500,000 in 2019 to free in 2020.\nHorses carry with a three-pound allowance for fillies and mares. Between 2017 and 2019, horses that ran without the use of the pre-race medication furosemide (more commonly known as Lasix) received an allowance of five pounds. Starting in 2020, the use of all race-day medications, including Lasix, is prohibited, which the Stronach Group heralded as a \"new era\" in North American thoroughbred racing.\nThe race is named for Pegasus, a Greek mythical horse, a 110-foot statue of which stands at Gulfstream Park.\nHistory.\nFrank Stronach first proposed the idea for the race during the Thoroughbred Owners Conference at Gulfstream in January 2016. His original proposal called for an annual -mile (10 furlong) race to be run at either Gulfstream or Santa Anita Park in mid to late January, which would not interfere with the Breeders' Cup or the Dubai World Cup. The timing also makes it possible for a horse to run one last race before retiring to stud, as the North American breeding season begins in mid-February. \"I think racing usually has a little lull this time of year – we have to wait for spring for something to happen\", said trainer Bob Baffert in January 2017. \"When I heard about the idea last year, I thought wow, American Pharoah probably would have been in there for one more try at it.\"\nThe Stronach Group officially announced plans for the race in May 2016, with the distance shortened to miles (9 furlongs). Under the original format, 12 shareholders each paid $1 million to purchase a position in the gate for a then unspecified horse. The shareholder then had the right to race, lease, contract or share a starter, or sell their place in the gate, and had the first right of refusal for subsequent races. Shareholders also had an equal share in the net income from the race. Each shareholder was permitted to pre-enter two horses. A pre-entered horse that did not draw into the Pegasus World Cup was eligible to compete in the newly created Poseidon Stakes, which was run under similar conditions but offered a $400,000 purse and required a $20,000 entry fee.\nThe second Pegasus World Cup in 2018 was contested for a higher purse of $16 million, with $1 million from each of the 12 starting positions and an additional $4 million contributed by the Stronach Group.\nWith the addition of a race on turf, the total prize money for the 2019 event was increased to $17 million. The purse for the original dirt race was reduced to $9 million, with the other $7 million in purse money was allocated to the new Pegasus World Cup Turf race (formerly the Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap), and another $1 million is available as bonus money should an owner win both races. The entry fee was reduced to $500,000, with 24 entries available — 12 in each of the dirt and turf races.\nIn 2019, the Stronach Group partnered with Xpressbet to host Pegasus World Cup Betting Championship with the total prize of $435,000.\nThe fourth Pegasus World Cup, to be run on 25 January 2020, will carry a purse of $3 million and require that horses be free of all race-day medications. There will no longer be entry or starting fees, as was the case with the previous runnings. 2% of all purse winnings will be donated to thoroughbred aftercare.\nRecords.\nSpeed Record\nMost Wins\nMost wins by a Jockey\nMost wins by a trainer\nMost wins by an owner"

It was originally slated to debut after Super Bowl XXI, which also aired on CBS, but was shelved due to player interviews taking up too much time and the network scheduling a primetime show immediately following said game.\nGame summary.\nSyracuse led, 73–72, with 28 seconds remaining, but Derrick Coleman missed the front end of a one-and-one, setting the stage for the game-winner from Keith Smart, who hit a jumper over Howard Triche with four seconds left. By the time Syracuse called timeout to set up a final play, there was one second remaining. A final desperation length-of-the-court pass was intercepted by Smart, who flung the ball into the stands, and the Hoosiers celebrated their national championship win."

        "text": "Jon Wright (born 10 August 1962) is an English former professional snooker player.\nCareer.\nJon Wright was born on 10 August 1962 in London. In 1984 he entered two WPBSA Pro Ticket events; he reached the final at Event One, losing 4–5 to David Roe, but won Event Two, defeating Roe 5–1. Wright twice represented England in the World Amateur Snooker Championship (1984 &amp; 1985), reaching the semi-final in 1984. During this period he was a regular winner on the lucrative Pro-Am circuit and was known as a prolific break builder.\nHe did not turn professional until 1986, but in his first season on the main tour, performed well, making a break of 123 - the highest of his career - in a 9–7 win over Martin Smith en route to the last-64 of the 1986 UK Championship. There, he lost 1–9 to the incumbent World Champion, Joe Johnson. \nIn the 1987 Classic, Wright recovered from 2–4 behind to beat Eugene Hughes 5–4 but, having reached the last 32, lost 1–5 to Stephen Hendry.\nAt the 1987 World Championship, he overcame Pat Houlihan, Paddy Browne, Mark Wildman and Cliff Wilson - whitewashing Wildman 10–0 - to qualify for the first round proper at the Crucible Theatre. Drawn against Alex Higgins, Wright led 4–2 but eventually succumbed 6–10. His results were sufficient for him to finish the season ranked 53rd.\nThe 1987/1988 season brought no real progress for Wright, as he lost in the last-64 in the International Open, the Grand Prix and the Classic, beaten by Tony Meo, Jimmy White and Tony Knowles respectively, although he came within one round of a second successive Crucible appearance, losing 4–10 to Hendry in qualifying for the World Championship.\nThe following season heralded a quarter-final appearance in a WPBSA non-ranking event, where Wright lost 3–5 to David Taylor, and progress to the last 32 in the 1988 Classic, where he followed victories over veterans Geoff Foulds and Rex Williams with a 2–5 defeat to young John Parrott.\nFollowing his first-round loss to Duncan Campbell in the 1989 World Snooker Championship, he slipped out of the top 64 in the rankings, finishing the season 67th. However, better form was to come in the 1990 Grand Prix, where he beat Eric Lawlor and Craig Edwards before losing 2–5, again to Hendry.\nHe expeienced efeats at the same stage of the Grand Prix and the Classic the following year - 5–0 by Steve Davis and by the same scoreline to Danny Fowler. He again came close to a Crucible return in the 1992 World Championship. There, he beat Lawlor 10–7, Williams 10–2 and Jason Whittaker 10–6 to reach the final qualifying round, but lost 3–10 to Bob Chaperon.\n1992/1993 would be Wright's final season as a professional; he lost to Darren Morgan in the last 64 at the 1993 European Open, but thereafter did not play another match. In September 1992, he was found guilty of \"conduct unbecoming a professional sportsman\" during a 3–5 qualifying defeat to Allison Fisher in the Dubai Classic, and suspended for the rest of the season. He was relegated from the tour in 1993.\nAfter professional snooker.\nAfter his professional career ended, Wright played amateur snooker in local leagues around the Suffolk area.\nHis Twitter bio and number plate reference his nickname \"Giro Jon\". A keen sports fan Jon enjoys watching Boxing and Darts as well as Snooker."

        "text": "Nils Birger Lennart Andersson (born 26 March 1951) is a former professional tennis player from Sweden.\nBiography.\nAndersson is best remembered for his performances for Sweden when they won the 1975 Davis Cup, the country's first title. Still a rookie, he had played professionally for only a few months before he got the Davis Cup call up. Up until the final he occupied the No. 2 singles position, behind Björn Borg. Although he didn't play in the final, he was responsible for Sweden making it that far, as he twice won the fifth and deciding match of a knockout tie. For his feats during the tournament he was given the nickname \"Bragd-Birger\".\nIn the Europe Zone quarter-final against West Germany, he defeated Karl Meiler in straight sets, to win the tie for Sweden. Soon after he made the third round of the 1975 Wimbledon Championships, with wins over Tito Vázquez and Humphrey Hose. He was again called upon for Sweden in the fifth rubber of the Europe Zone final against Spain in Barcelona and managed to beat José Higueras in four sets. For the first time in Sweden's campaign they had home advantage when they met Chile in the Inter-Zonal semi-finals in Båstad. With Sweden leading 2–1, Andersson secured his side's place in the final by beating Patricio Cornejo in the fourth rubber. Ove Bengtson was preferred over clay court specialist Andersson for the final against Czechoslovakia as the tie was played on indoor carpet. In response to being asked if he felt let down losing his spot in the team for the final he responded that he believed Swedish captain Lennart Bergelin \"picked the right guy\".\nAndersson continued playing professional tournaments for the remainder of the decade and had his best Grand Prix performance in one of his last appearances, the semi-finals of the 1980 Swedish Open in Båstad.\nSince retiring he has worked as a gymnastics director and now coaches at the Linköping tennis academy."

        "text": "The men's golf tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics took place at the Olympic Golf Course (), built within the Reserva de Marapendi in the Barra da Tijuca zone, between 11 and 14 August 2016. It was the first such tournament in 112 years.\nSixty players took part in four rounds of stroke play. Justin Rose of Great Britain won the gold medal by two strokes over silver medalist Henrik Stenson of Sweden. It was the first gold medal for Great Britain (which had previously earned silver and bronze in 1900) and first medal of any color for Sweden, making its debut in the event. Matt Kuchar of the United States was one stroke behind Stenson and won the bronze medal. This put the American podium streak at 3 Games—and 116 years—long.\nThe tournament carried Official World Golf Ranking points. Rose went from 12th to 9th in the rankings as a result while Stenson went from 5th to 4th and Kuchar went from 20th to 15th.\nBackground.\nThe first Olympic golf tournaments took place at the second modern Games in Paris 1900. Men's and women's events were held. Golf was featured again at the next Games, St. Louis 1904 with men's events (an individual tournament as well as a team event). The 1908 Games in London were also supposed to have a men's golf competition, but a dispute led to a boycott by all of the host nation's golfers, leaving only a single international competitor and resulting in the cancellation of the event. Golf would disappear from the Olympic programme from then until returning with this event.\nMany of the top players withdrew over concerns about Zika fever. Bubba Watson, the world number 5, was the highest-ranked golfer to compete.\n30 of the 34 participating nations were making their debut. The United States was the only nation to have previously competed at both of the men's individual golf tournaments in 1900 and 1904, making its third appearance in 2016. Canada (1904), France (1900), and Great Britain (1900) had each competed once previously, making their second appearance here.\nQualification.\nEach country qualified from one to four athletes based on World Rankings. The top 60 golfers, subject to limits per nation and guarantees for the host and continental representation, were selected. A nation could have three or four golfers if they were all in the top 15 of the rankings; otherwise, each nation was limited to two golfers. One spot was guaranteed for the host nation and five spots were guaranteed to ensure that each Olympic continent had at least one representative. Neither the host nor the continental guarantees turned out to be necessary, with Brazil qualifying one golfers normally and each continent having at least two golfers qualified.\nCompetition format.\nThe tournament was a four-round stroke play tournament, with the lowest score over the total 72 holes winning.\nResults.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, 11 August 2016\"\nMarcus Fraser of Australia recorded nine birdies on his way to a round of 63 (−8) and a three-shot lead. Justin Rose of Great Britain became the first player to make a hole-in-one at the Games. \nSecond round.\n\"Friday, 12 August 2016\"\nMarcus Fraser of Australia carded four birdies and two bogeys for a round of 69 (−2) and saw his lead reduced to one shot.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, 13 August 2016\"\nRose fired a 65 (−6) including two eagles to take a one-shot lead over world number five Henrik Stenson into the final round. South Africa's Jaco van Zyl, meanwhile, made a hole in one of his own at the 8th. \nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, 14 August 2016\"\nRose and Stenson continued to battle in the final group of the day and were tied at −15 going to the 18th. Rose then produced a backspin approach that left him with a 2.5-foot putt, and Stenson underhit his approach and eventually three-putted for bogey, leaving Rose with two putts to win the gold. He made the first for birdie to secure the win, becoming the first golfer to win Olympic gold in 112 years.\nIt was Rose's first tournament win in 10 months, having won the UBS Hong Kong Open the previous October. American Matt Kuchar, who had entered the final round tied for seventh, shot a 63 (−8) to take bronze."

His first appearance was the doubles rubber when Spain played Greece in Athens. He and partner Antonio Muñoz secured the tie with a four-set win. He was called up again for Spain in the Europe Zone final against Italy in Barcelona. With the Italians having an unassailable 3–1 lead, Soler was picked for the fifth match against Adriano Panatta, a dead rubber. He managed to dominate the former French Open champion for a 6–1, 6–0 win, but the Italian was accused of not playing to his best. The crowd was reportedly incensed by Panatta's performance which was described as \"lackadaisical\" and showing \"little inclination to fight\". He allegedly deliberately hit some of his shots out during the match. The crowd booed Panatta throughout and a few attempted to attack him as he left the court. There were even fist fights in the crowd between Spanish and Italian supporters.\nSoler played in the main singles draw of the French Open on three occasions and was unable to get past the opening round. In both 1977 and 1978, he lost in the first round to Buster Mottram, then in 1979 faced ninth seed Arthur Ashe. Soler, who also played in the 1977 US Open, competed on the Grand Prix and WCT circuits. His best performance was a semi-final appearance at Murcia in 1977, during which he defeated Roger Taylor. He also had career wins over Juan Aguilera and Corrado Barazzutti. In 1983 he was a doubles gold medalist at the Mediterranean Games in Casablanca."

        "title": "FIG World Cup",
        "text": "FIG World Cup refers to a number of events organized by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) across seven competitive gymnastics disciplines: 1) acrobatic gymnastics, 2) aerobic gymnastics, 3) men's artistic gymnastics, 4) women's artistic gymnastics, 5) women's rhythmic gymnastics, 6) trampoline and tumbling, and 7) parkour.\nHistory.\nThe FIG hosted the first Artistic Gymnastics World Cup on an international scale in 1975. This event was an original competition reserved for the best gymnasts, bringing together competitors in all-around competition and in apparatus finals. This initiative was taken in a particular context, since the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships took place every four years. In 1983, FIG decided to hold a Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup for the first time, after six editions of the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup. At the time, the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships were also held every four years. The World Cup events were upheld only until 1990, since FIG decided to host the Artistic and Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championships every year starting in 1991. Acrobatic gymnastics, a discipline not recognized by the International Gymnastics Federation prior to 1999, had World Cup events held from 1975 to 1993, organized by the International Federation of Sports Acrobatics (IFSA). Similarly, trampoline and tumbling World Cup events were organized from 1993 to 1997 by the Fédération Internationale de Trampoline (FIT). FIG later recognized IFSA and FIT World Cup events as official FIG World Cup competitions.\nIn 1997, the World Cup was revived as a series of qualifying events for a period of two years, culminating in a final event that was known as the World Cup Final. The different stages, known as World Cup qualifiers, mostly served the purpose of awarding points to gymnasts according to their placements. These points would be added up over the two-year period to qualify a limited number of gymnasts to the biennial World Cup Final event. In 2001, FIG hosted the World Series for aerobic gymnastics for the first time, equivalent to the World Cup format. FIG introduced the first World Cup series in acrobatic gymnastics in 2003. Both aerobic and acrobatic World Cup series were also competed in a two-year period, with a World Cup Final (or World Series Final) event closing the calendar. The World Cup Final format lasted for these disciplines until 2007. In 2008, the World Cup Final format was terminated for the other disciplines: artistic, rhythmic, trampoline and tumbling.\nBeginning in 2009, the World Cup series changed focus from a biennial series to a yearly series with no culminating final event. In each of the stages, medals are awarded to the top three gymnasts or groups in each event, as well as prize money. In 2018, parkour was recognized as a discipline by FIG, and World Cup stages were held for the first time in collaboration with the \"Festival International des Sports Extrêmes\" (FISE). The 2019 and 2020 World Cup series in artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics and trampoline will be part of the qualification process to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, a first in the World Cup series.\nWorld Cup series.\nArtistic gymnastics.\nSince 1997, the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup has been contested as a series of stages in different cities around the world. From 2003 to 2010, events at the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series were divided into Category A and Category B; Category A events were reserved for invited athletes only, while Category B events were open to all athletes. In 2011, the individual apparatus competitions were renamed World Challenge Cups while the all-around competitions retained the World Cup name. Currently, the World Cup series is divided into three groups: 1) All-Around World Cup series, 2) World Challenge Cup series, and 3) World Cup series, where gymnasts compete in individual apparatus. All of the World Challenge Cup competitions remain open to every gymnast, while All-Around World Cup competitions are by invitation only, according to the results of the previous World Championships or Olympic Games.\nRhythmic gymnastics.\nSince 1999, the Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup has been competed as a series of events held in different countries. From 2003 to 2016, events at the Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup series were divided into Category A and Category B; Category A events were reserved for invited athletes, while Category B events were open to all athletes. Since 2017, the World Cup series is divided in: 1) the World Cup series; and 2) the World Challenge Cup series. All of the World Cup and World Challenge Cup events are open to all athletes, and all of the events feature both all-around and apparatus competitions.\nThe Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup should not be confused with the Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix series, which is neither officially organized nor promoted by FIG.\nOther disciplines.\nAs of 2018, series of World Cup events are held yearly in acrobatic gymnastics, aerobic gymnastics, trampoline and tumbling, as well as parkour. All events are organized and sanctioned by FIG.\nAcrobatic gymnastics, a discipline not recognized by the International Gymnastics Federation prior to 1999, had World Cup events held from 1975 to 1993, organized by the International Federation of Sports Acrobatics (IFSA). Similarly, trampoline and tumbling World Cup events were organized from 1993 to 1997 by the Fédération Internationale de Trampoline (FIT). FIG later recognized IFSA and FIT World Cup events as official FIG World Cup competitions. The World Cup Final format lasted for these disciplines until 2007. In 2008, the World Cup Final format was terminated for the other disciplines: artistic, rhythmic, trampoline and tumbling.In 2018, parkour was recognized as a discipline by FIG, and World Cup stages were held for the first time in collaboration with the Festival International des Sports Extrêmes (FISE).\nFIG World Cup Final.\nThe World Cup Finals were held as the final event of the World Cup circuit for each of the disciplines in gymnastics until 2008. The International Gymnastics Federation officially recognizes only a number of events as World Cup Final events, as shown below.\nSuccessful nations.\nWhat follows are lists of nations which have earned at least one medal at one of the stages of the FIG World Cup circuit, divided by discipline. The events are sometimes referred to as World Series, World Cup or World Challenge Cup, depending on the format and the discipline contested. Only senior events were considered for the making of the lists.\nAcrobatic gymnastics.\nResults accounted for include: 1) the different editions of the IFSA World Cup from 1975 to 1993; and 2) the different stages of the FIG World Series and FIG World Cup series.\nAerobic gymnastics.\nResults accounted for include the different stages of the FIG World Series and FIG World Cup series.\nArtistic gymnastics.\nResults accounted for include the different stages of the FIG World Cup series and the FIG World Challenge Cup series.\nParkour.\nResults accounted for include the different stages of the FIG World Cup circuit, started in 2018 in collaboration with the \"Festival International des Sports Extrêmes\" (FISE). \nRhythmic gymnastics.\nResults accounted for include the different stages of the FIG World Cup series and the FIG World Challenge Cup series.\nTrampoline and tumbling gymnastics.\nResults accounted for include: 1) the different editions of the FIT World Cup from 1984 to 1998; and 2) the different stages of the FIG World Series and FIG World Cup series."

The school's team currently competes in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) and plays their home games in Run Baby Run Arena. They are currently led by second-year head coach Jennifer Leedham. The Peacocks have appeared in the NCAA Women's tournament seven times. As with the other women's athletic programs of Saint Peter's University, they were previously known as the Peahens.\nHistory.\nSaint Peter's University is one of the founding members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), which began play in women's basketball with the 1981–82 season. Since then, the Peacocks have compiled the second most wins of any MAAC women's team and have won the MAAC Women's Championship nine times (1982, 1983, 1984, 1992, 1993, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002), the second most all-time. Prior to joining the MAAC, the Peacocks competed in the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) from 1971 to 1981 at the Division II level.\nIn 2021, led by head coach Marc Mitchell, the Peacocks made a spirited run to the MAAC Championship game after a 19 year absence. They were matched up against their long time MAAC rival, the No. 1 Marist Red Foxes in a bid to win their first MAAC Championship, tenth overall, and first appearance in the NCAA Tournament since 2002. The Red Foxes would go on to defeat the Peacocks 69–30 to win their eleventh MAAC title.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I.\nThe Peacocks have made seven appearances in the NCAA Tournament. They have a record of 0–7.\nAIAW Small College/Division II.\nThe Peacocks made one appearance in the AIAW National Division II women's basketball tournament, with a combined record of 1–1.\nCoaches.\nHead coach Mike Granelli led the Peacocks during their greatest period of success which spanned three decades and the jump from Division II to Division I level competition. During Granelli's 32 years (1972–2004) as the Peacocks head coach, Saint Peter's won 607 games, nine MAAC titles and appeared in seven NCAA tournaments. Saint Peter's best single season record during that span was 26–3 in the 1985–86 season. Granelli was only the third head coach in women's college basketball history to win 600 games at one school and was the first male head coach to win 600 games. He also became ninth head coach in Division I history to win 600 games.\nThe following is a list of Saint Peter's Peacocks women's basketball head coaches."

        "text": "The St. John's lacrosse case was a 1990 criminal case in which some members of the St. John's University men's lacrosse team were accused of raping an African American female. The St. John's Lacrosse rape case was a sports scandal that caused significant controversy within the school, amongst feminists, New York City, and the lacrosse community. This case was a predecessor to the Duke lacrosse case. The case was the basis of a \"Law &amp; Order\" episode called \"Out of Control\".\nCase.\nOn March 1, 1990, an African American woman of Jamaican descent was the alleged victim of sexual assault by 6 white male students (3 of them being members of the St. John's lacrosse team) at a private house off campus. The female was brought over to a house by her friend on the St. John's rifle club where she was given an alcoholic drink. At the house she was semi-conscious and sexually assaulted; later she was brought to another house and assaulted as well. The victim was 5'2 and 100lbs while the attackers were all over 5'10 and 180lbs. The victim did not make notification until two weeks after the event. Some members of the school community blamed the victim for the sexual assault, likening it to the Tawana Brawley scandal. This though was 3 years after the Tawana Brawley case.\nTrial.\nThe case was said to be about consent. The victim's sexual history was put on trial. Some people wondered how much the victim could remember if she was out of consciousness. Another issues was how long it took for the student to report it. The two-week delay seemed to be problematic. One student, Thomas Dean, made a deal with prosecutors and stated the version of events told by the victim was true. The jury consisted of 10 white and two blacks. One student plead guilty and agreed to testify against the others. The charges against the students included sodomy. The alleged rapists were all acquitted of the crime.\nAftermath.\nNew York City Mayor David Dinkins, when he heard about the acquittal, stated \"based upon my reading of the evidence presented in this case, I am shocked and dismayed.\". Congressman Charles B. Rangel compared \"the verdict to the acquittal of whites in the Old South\" and said he would demand today that the Justice Department prosecute the men for violating the woman's civil rights.\" Several students were fully expelled from St. John's University after the incident."

        "text": "Defending gold medalist Andy Murray of Great Britain successfully retained his title, defeating Juan Martín del Potro of Argentina in the final, 7–5, 4–6, 6–2, 7–5 to win the gold medal in Men's singles tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics. He became the first tennis player ever, male or female, to win two Olympic singles gold medals. Murray and del Potro were only the third and fourth men to win multiple singles medals of any color (following del Potro's bronze in 2012). Murray's gold was Great Britain's fifth in men's singles, the most of any nation. In the bronze medal match, Japan's Kei Nishikori defeated Spain's Rafael Nadal, 6–2, 6–7(1–7), 6–3, earning Japan's first men's singles Olympic medal since 1920.\nThe tournament was held at the Olympic Tennis Centre in the Barra Olympic Park in Barra da Tijuca in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The final was played on 14 August 2016. There were 64 players from 34 nations.\nWorld No. 1 ranked Novak Djokovic lost in the first round to del Potro in straight sets. Djokovic was attempting to complete the career Super Slam; his defeat marked his first loss in the opening round of a tournament since 2009. This was the second consecutive Olympic singles match where del Potro defeated Djokovic, following their encounter in the bronze medal match in 2012.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th (medal) appearance of the men's singles tennis event. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. Demonstration events were held in 1968 and 1984.\nThe number one seed was Novak Djokovic of Serbia, making his third Olympic appearance after reaching the semifinals in 2008 (bronze medal) and 2012 (fourth place). The defending champion and number two seed was Andy Murray of Great Britain. Spain's Rafael Nadal, the 2008 gold medalist who was unable to compete in 2012 due to injury, was the third seed. Sidelined with injury this time was Roger Federer of Switzerland (who, like Djokovic, needed only an Olympic gold for a career Golden Slam). 2012 bronze medalist Argentinian Juan Martín del Potro returned, as did quarterfinalists Kei Nishikori of Japan (the fourth seed) and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France (fifth seed).\nBarbados, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Dominican Republic, Georgia, Lithuania, and Moldova each made their debut in the event. France made its 14th appearance, most among all nations, having missed only the 1904 event.\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's singles was primarily through the ATP ranking list of 11 June 2016. An additional restriction was that players had to have been part of a nominated team for three Davis Cup events between 2013 and 2016 (with some exceptions). Nations had been limited to four players in the event since the 2000 Games. There were 64 quota places available for men's singles. The first 56 were assigned through the world ranking. There were two Tripartite Commission invitation places and 6 final qualification places allocated by the ITF based on continental and national representation along with world rankings.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. Matches were in best-of-3 sets, except for the final which was in best-of-5 sets. A tiebreak would be played in all sets reaching 6–6 (previously, no tiebreak would be used in the third set of a non-final match or the fifth set of the final).\nSeeds.\nSeeds were based on ATP rankings as of 1 August 2016.\n \"(first round)\"\n (champion, gold medalist)\n \"(semifinals, fourth place)\"\n \"(semifinals, bronze medalist)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(quarterfinals)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(quarterfinals)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(quarterfinals)\"\n \"(second round, withdrew due to foot injury)\"\n \"(first round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\nDraw.\nPlayers placement onto the table is such that no two players from the same country start within the same quarter section of the table, hence making it impossible for them to meet until the semifinals. This is enabled by the qualification rule that states that no country can bring more than four players for each of the singles tournament. The countries bringing the maximum of four players are Argentina, Australia, France, Italy, Spain and United States."

Nations had been able to enter four players (two pairs) in the event since the 2004 Games. Each nation was limited to a total of 6 male players in the singles and doubles events combined, so nations with 4 singles players could add only 2 more in doubles. The men's doubles draw was 32 pairs (64 players).\nDoubles players ranked 10 or better qualified directly and could bring any ranked singles or doubles player from their nation as their partner. This resulted in 6 pairs being filled, as 2 pairs consisted of both players in the top 10 and the Bryan brothers declined to use their qualification places.\nThe draw was then filled to 24 pairs (that is, 18 new pairs) through combined ranking. The better of a player's singles or doubles ranking was used, and the two rankings of a pair of players were added to give a combined ranking, with the lowest rankings earning qualifying spots. (For example, Rafael Nadal was ranked #4 in singles and #144 in doubles and Marc López had no singles ranking and was ranked #18 in doubles; they had a combined ranking of 22, earning the first quota spot through this method.)\nThe final 8 pairs were selected by the ITF considering both combined ranking (as above) as well as continental and national representation, including host nation places if not qualified (bringing the total number of male tennis players to 86).\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze-medal match. All matches were best-of-three sets. Tiebreaks were used for any set before the third (fifth in the final) that reached 6–6.\nSeeds.\n / \"(first round)\"\n / \"(first round)\"\n / \"(quarterfinals)\"\n / \"(first round)\"\n / \"(final, silver medalists)\"\n / (champions, gold medalists)\n / \"(semifinals, fourth place)\"\n / \"(quarterfinals)\""

        "text": "The 1995 Wales rugby union tour was a series of matches played in August and September 1995 in South Africa by the Wales national team. The tour consisted of two matches; a warm-up game against the South-East Transvaal provincial side, and a test match against the South African national team. The tour was held in part to thank South Africa for supporting Wales' bid to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup.\nWales named a squad of 24 players for the tour, including five uncapped players. Ten of the squad had not been included in the Wales team that participated in the 1995 Rugby World Cup during May and June. Jonathan Humphreys was named the captain, despite only having played for the national team on two previous occasions.\nWales' only warm-up game was against South-East Transvaal on 29 August in Witbank. At the time, South-East Transvaal were playing in the third division of the Currie Cup, South Africa's provincial competition. They came into the game having won eleven successive matches in the competition. South-East Transvaal won the game comfortably by 47 points to 6. They scored five tries, and fly-half Jacques Benade kicked all five conversions as well as three penalties and a drop-goal. Wales' only points came through two penalties kicked by their fly-half Aled Williams.\nThe test match against South Africa took place on 2 September at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg. This was a week after the sport was declared \"open\" with restrictions on payments to players removed, making it the first test match of rugby union's professional era. This was the ninth test match between the countries, but only the second match since 1970. South Africa had won seven of the previous encounters, with one draw between the sides. As the reigning world champions following their victory in June, South Africa were overwhelming favourites to win the match.\nSouth Africa won the game by 40 points to 11. Wales had taken an early lead when Mark Bennett scored a try in the third minute, immediately following which South Africa lock Kobus Wiese punched an unsighted Derwyn Jones, knocking him out. The incident was missed by the officials, and Wiese was not sanctioned during the match. South Africa responded through tries from Wiese and Francois Pienaar, and at half-time led by 18 points to 8. In the second-half, Wales' Neil Jenkins kicked a penalty to reduce the gap to seven points. South Africa then scored three tries in seven minutes to extend their lead to 29 points. A minute before the end of the match, Wales' Garin Jenkins punched South Africa's Joost van der Westhuizen. The punch, which knocked out van der Westhuizen resulted in Jenkins being sent off by the referee.\nFollowing the game, Wales invoked citing procedures against Wiese for the punch against Derwyn Jones. As a result of receiving a red card, Garin Jenkins also faced disciplinary proceedings. Both Wiese and Jenkins were banned from playing rugby for 30 days for their actions.\nResults.\n\"Scores and results list Wales's points tally first.\""

        "text": "The 2016 Samoa vs. Fiji rugby league test match was played between Samoa and Fiji at Apia Park.\nBackground.\nOn 7 May 2016, it was confirmed that Apia would host a test-match between Samoa and Fiji on 8 October 2016, marking the 30th anniversary of rugby league in Samoa. John Grant, the Chief Executive of the Australian Rugby League Commission, shared his support for the test by confirming that an Australian registered referee would be provided along with senior staff and management to help with the organisation of the match.\nA couple of hours before the Pacific test-matches began, discussions were made and confirmed between the RLIF Deputy Chairman, John Grant, alongside Rugby League Samoa Chairman/Asia-Pacific Rugby League Confederation Chairman, Tagaloa Faafouina Su'a, and the Fiji Rugby League Chairman, Filimoni Vosarogo, that Samoa's city of Apia will host a test-match between Samoa and Fiji on October 8, 2016. This test-match will mark 30 years of Rugby league in Samoa.\nSquads.\nSamoa picked 6 débutantes for the test match, while Fiji selected four. All of the Samoan team had players based in the NRL except for Denny Solomona, who plays for Super League club Castleford Tigers. Fiji on the other hand had a fair share of National Rugby League, and New South Wales Cup players along with one domestic player, Pio Seci. Samoa's most capped player was Leeson Ah Mau, who made his 11th appearance for his country, while Fiji's most experienced player was James Storer, who also made his 11th appearance for his country.\nSt. George Illawarra's Leeson Ah Mau captained Samoa, and Wests Tigers' Kevin Naiqama led Fiji.\nMatch summary.\nFiji won the match after trailing 18-0 at the 20 minute mark. Samoa were dominating proceedings in the opening quarter as they controlled most of the possession and territory but Fiji hit back in the back-end of the game with Samoa's errors ruining the home team's chances."

Eighteen teams competed in the tournament, chosen by either winning an automatic qualifying conference tournament or as an at-large bid based on their performance during the regular season. The participating teams were announced on May 8.\nNorth Carolina won the title, defeating Maryland 14–13 in overtime in the final, becoming the first unseeded team to win the championship.

The 19 goals is a tournament record.\nTournament overview.\nThe play-in games were played at campus sites on May 11. The first round games were played at campus sites on May 14 and 15. The quarterfinal games were played on May 21, 2016 at Brown Stadium in Providence, Rhode Island, and May 22, 2016 at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio.\nThe semifinals were contested on May 28, 2016, and the championship on May 30, 2016. The semifinals and championship were held at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, and hosted by Drexel University.\nSchools from 10 conferences, the America East Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big East Conference, Colonial Athletic Association (CAA), Big Ten Conference, Ivy League, Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), Northeast Conference (NEC), Patriot League, and Southern Conference (SoCon) received automatic bids into the tournament by winning their respective conference tournaments, leaving eight remaining at-large bids for top ranked teams. The top fourteen seeds were placed directly into the bracket, and the four lowest seeds met in play-in games to the Sweet 16.\nIn the finals, Maryland was ahead by two goals with over seven minutes to play before Carolina tied the game. A potential game winning goal by Colin Heacock of Maryland went off the crossbar with just over a minute left in regulation. The game went into overtime where Kyle Bernlohr made a miracle save for Maryland, but the Terps were called for a one minute penalty on the play. On the man up, Michael Tagliaferri found Chris Cloutier uncovered at the top of the key, and he beat Bernlohr low for the winning goal.

        "text": "The 2016 Women's Cricket Super League, or 2016 Kia Super League for sponsorship reasons, was the first season of the Women's Cricket Super League (WCSL), a semi-professional women's cricket competition in England and Wales. The competition, run by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), consisted of six franchise teams playing in a Twenty20 format. Each team featured three or four players contracted to the England women's cricket team and three overseas international players. Three teams qualified from the league stage of the competition; the Southern Vipers went directly into the final, while the Loughborough Lightning and Western Storm met in a semi-final.\nThe Southern Vipers became the first WCSL champions, defeating Western Storm by seven wickets in the final. Stafanie Taylor, a West Indian overseas player for the Western Storm, was named as player of the tournament, after she finished as both the leading run-scorer and leading wicket-taker in the competition.\nCompetition format.\nSix teams competed for the T20 title which took place between 30 July and 21 August 2016. The six teams played each other once in a round robin format; followed by a finals day at the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. The team that finished top of the table during the group stage qualified directly for the final, while the teams in second and third qualified for a semi-final. Both the semi-final and the final were played on the same day at the same ground. This was a change in format from the original proposal, in which the top four team qualified for the semi-finals. During the group stage, teams scored two points for a win, but gained an additional bonus point if they scored at a run rate 1.25 or more times that of their opponent.\nTeams.\nEach team named a squad of 15 players, which included three overseas players and three or four England team players. The remaining squad positions comprised England academy players and a selection of other English domestic cricketers. A number of changes were made to the squads; before they were even officially announced, the Lancashire Thunder had to find a replacement for Jess Jonassen, who withdrew due to injury. In June, a month and a half before the tournament started, two further overseas players withdrew from the tournament. Megan Schutt was unable to play for the Southern Vipers due to a knee injury, and was replaced in the team by the New Zealand international Morna Nielsen, while Sarah Coyte withdrew for personal reasons, and was replaced in the Lancashire Thunder side by Amy Satterthwaite. The Lancashire Thunder suffered further disruption in the weeks leading up to the competition, when Sarah Taylor, who was initially named as their captain, \nconfirmed that she would not take part in the tournament while she took a break from cricket to deal with anxiety and panic attacks. Amy Satterthwaite was named as captain in her place. Another late change was necessitated by a shoulder injury to Meg Lanning, with Lea Tahuhu replacing her in the Surrey Stars squad.\nTournament summary.\nLeague stage.\nThe tournament began on 30 July at Headingley in Leeds, where the Loughborough Lightning faced the Yorkshire Diamonds. The Lightning batted first and scored 128 for nine, led by 52 runs from their New Zealand international, Sophie Devine. The Diamonds began their response well, and their captain, Lauren Winfield scored 23 runs from just 13 balls before she was run out. There was some controversy regarding the dismissal; Winfield felt that she had been impeded by the bowler, but the umpires upheld the dismissal. Regular wickets and miserly bowling from the Lightning attack restricted Yorkshire's batsmen, and they were eventually all out for 85, giving the Lightning a 43-run victory. The following day saw two low-scoring matches; the Surrey Stars were restricted to 85 runs from their 20 overs by an economic Southern Vipers bowling attack. Nat Sciver managed to score 36 runs for the Stars late in the innings, but the Vipers scored 66 runs from their opening partnership, including 41 runs from 43 balls for Georgia Adams to help them towards their target. They won with six wickets and 28 balls to spare. In the other fixture that day, the Lancashire Thunder reached 65 for four, but then a spell of bowling from Heather Knight and Stafanie Taylor for the Western Storm saw the Thunder dismissed all out for 83 runs. Taylor finished with four wickets, while Knight took three. In their batting response, Knight and Taylor were again the best performers; Knight scored 23 and Taylor 14 as the Storm chased down the total with 27 balls remaining.\nThe Lancashire Thunder took on the Loughborough Lightning in the fourth match of the tournament, and the two teams combined to score over 300 runs. Amy Satterthwaite scored a rapid 52 runs from 32 balls for the Thunder to help them reach 164 for eight. A combination of good bowling from the Thunder bowlers, and some poor run outs hindered the Lightning's batting. Sophie Ecclestone took three wickets with her spin bowling as the Lightning collapsed to 77 for eight. A partnership of 69 runs between Thea Brookes and Paige Scholfield gave Loughborough a chance at chasing down the total, but late wickets for Hayley Matthews saw Lancashire win by six runs. The next day, Yorkshire batted first against Surrey and scored 134 for five, largely due to runs from Hollie Armitage (43) and Lauren Winfield (29). Surrey's Alex Hartley was the pick of the bowlers, taking two wickets and restricting the Diamonds to 18 runs from her four overs. In their reply, Tammy Beaumont, Bryony Smith and Nat Sciver all made good starts to help their side chase down the total and give the Stars a six wicket victory with 11 balls remaining. Lancashire Thunder hosted the Southern Vipers in their third match of the tournament. The Vipers batted first and scored 132 for 4, helped by a score of 54 not out from Sara McGlashan. The Thunder lost Matthews from the fourth ball of their batting innings, but then recovered with a 57-run second wicket partnership between Satterthwaite and Emma Lamb. The pair were dismissed two overs apart, and Lancashire failed to score the runs they needed, falling 11 runs short of the Vipers' total.\nA fourth-wicket partnership of 83 runs between Amy Jones and Ellyse Perry rescued Loughborough from 31 for three against the Western Storm, and they posted 158 for eight. Storm's captain, Heather Knight, scored 74 runs in the chase, but received little batting support from her teammates. After Knight was run out, the Storm faltered to eventually lose the game by five runs. Western Storm were in action again two days later, when they hosted the Stars in Bristol. The Stars batted first and scored 161 for six, propelled by an innings of 90 not out from Nat Sciver. In their chase, Stafanie Taylor scored 74 not out, and Lizelle Lee got 53 to help the Storm to victory. In Southampton the next day, the Southern Vipers beat the Diamonds by 54 runs; Suzie Bates and Arran Brindle each scored 45 runs for the hosts, and Linsey Smith then took four wickets to help bowl the Diamonds out for 64. Only Beth Mooney reached double figures for the Diamonds. A strong bowling performance from Alex Hartley and Marizanne Kapp helped Surrey to limit Lancashire to 102 for nine in the next match, with the pair both bowling economically and taking five wickets between them. The Stars chased down the target with more than four overs remaining; Tammy Beaumont scored 45, and Bryony Smith made 30.\nIn the penultimate round of matches, Dane van Niekerk made the highest score of the competition, 91 runs, to propel the Loughborough Lightning to 168 for 6, the highest team total of the tournament. During the Surrey Stars' response, van Niekerk was also one of three bowlers to take two wickets to help limit the Stars to 134 runs, and secure the Lightning a place at finals days. The Vipers travelled to Taunton unbeaten before their match against the Western Storm. Batting first, the Vipers reached 137 for 3; Suzie Bates scored 57 runs and Charlotte Edwards got 30. In their reply, the Western Storm lost Rachel Priest early, but two big partnership involving Stafanie Taylor, who scored 78 not out, helped them to victory with 13 balls remaining. The final match of the day pitted the two northern sides against each other in the women's 'Roses' match. Yorkshire batted first in Manchester and scored 166; Alex Blackwell got 59 runs, and a slow over-rate meant that Yorkshire received six additional runs before the final over. In Lancashire's chase, Danielle Hazell took four wickets, and Katherine Brunt took a hat-trick to bowl the Thunder out for 71 runs. That meant that Yorkshire and Lancashire had each won once during the tournament, and irrespective of results in the last round of group matches, neither could qualify for finals day; both the Southern Vipers and Western Storm would join the Loughborough Lightning.\nThe last round of matches, featuring all three of the teams that had qualified for finals day, determined who went directly to the final, and who would face off first in the semi-final. The Southern Vipers faced the Loughborough Lightning, and batting first a team effort saw them reach 156 for 4; Bates scored 38, Sara McGlashan got 34* and Lydia Greenway 29. Despite scores in the thirties from Perry and Evelyn Jones, a strong bowling performance from the Vipers, in which Linsey Smith and Brindle each took three wickets, saw them to victory by 59 runs. That victory guaranteed the Vipers a place in the final, while the Loughborough Lightning had to face Western Storm in a semi-final. The result of the other match that day was of no consequence to the tournament; Beth Mooney scored 56 runs for the Yorkshire Diamonds, who scored 118 runs. Anya Shrubsole finished the match with five wickets for the Western Storm, taking a four–wicket maiden in the final over of the match. Storm opening batsmen Taylor and Priest shared a 101-run partnership to take their side to the brink of victory before being dismissed from subsequent deliveries, but despite two further wickets, the Storm won by six wickets with 21 balls remaining.\nSemi-final.\nThe first match of the women's finals day, the Western Storm won the toss and decided to bowl first against the Loughborough Lightning. The Lightning scored 21 runs from the first four overs, before Stafanie Taylor struck twice in the fifth over, dismissing both openers; van Niekerk for 14, and Georgia Elwiss for 6. A 58-run partnership between Ellyse Perry and Sophie Devine ensued, though neither scored that quickly. The scoring-rate slowed further after Devine's dismissal for 21 runs, but a late surge from Perry and Thea Brookes helped Loughborough reach 124 for seven. Taylor finished the innings with three wickets, while Shrubsole and Dibble were both relatively economical, both going for five-runs per over or less. Beginning their chase, the Storm lost Priest early, bowled by van Niekerk for four runs. Taylor and Knight then shared a 57-run partnership before van Niekerk took the wicket of Taylor for 34. Knight remained in place, reaching a half-century before being dismissed in the final over, with the scores level. Georgia Hennessy came in, and struck four runs from her only ball to secure the victory, and a place in the final, for the Western Storm.\nFinal.\nPlayed at Chelmsford after the semi-final, Vipers' captain Charlotte Edwards won the toss and elected to bowl first. The Western Storm opening batsmen, Stafanie Taylor and Rachel Priest started well, propelling the score to 71 without loss after ten overs. In the subsequent over, Arran Brindle dismissed Taylor for 35, and her miserly bowling helped to slow the Storm's scoring. Heather Knight and Priest got out soon after one another, scoring 6 and 57 respectively, before the Storm's middle-order batsmen; Fran Wilson (16*), Lizelle Lee (6), Sophie Luff (2) and Georgia Hennessy (9*), added a few more runs to bring their total to 140 from 20 overs. Brindle and Tash Farrant were the pick of the bowlers, both conceding less than five runs per over.\nIn their response, the Vipers' openers put on 78 runs together in just under 10 overs, before Edwards was dismissed for 24, bowled by Jodie Dibble. Suzie Bates was run out by Fran Wilson soon after for 52 from 46 balls. Georgia Adams added 15 runs before she was also run out, by Anya Shrubsole. Another good partnership, between Sara McGlashan (21*) and Lydia Greenway (17*), took the Vipers to their target with seven balls to spare. Taylor, who was named as player of the tournament, was the most effective bowler for the Storm, but even she could only limit the Vipers to six runs per over.\nResults.\nLeague stage.\nNotes:\nTeam marked qualified directly for the final.\nTeams marked qualified for the semi-final.\n "

        "title": "1911 Queensland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The Queensland Amateur Rugby League conducted four grade competitions during 1911 and in representative football, played three sets of three-match series against New South Wales, New Zealand and the \"Northern Districts\" on New South Wales. Ipswich fielded two teams in the senior QARL competition and also held two lower grade premierships. Club competitions continued in Maryborough.\nSeason summary.\nSenior Grade.\nThe QARL Senior premiership began and ended with four teams, but six teams played during the season. From the previous season, East Brisbane did not return. Valley and Toombul fielded a combined senior team, although they fielded separate junior teams.\nOn May 6, \"The League officials plumed their feathers yesterday afternoon, and set out in two directions— to Ipswich and the 'Gabba — for the opening of their fixtures.\" South Brisbane played Valley-Toombul in Brisbane and Ipswich hosted North Brisbane.\nTwo new teams joined the competition whilst the Queensland representative team was in Sydney. On June 3, Ipswich B hosted and defeated Valley-Toombul, by 24 to 2, on the North Ipswich Cricket Reserve. One week later, they met South Brisbane United on the Brisbane Cricket Ground, Woolloongabba. Ipswich B defeated South United, 41 to 3.\nAll six teams played on June 17 before the suspension of the senior competition for a benefit match to the widow and child of Micky Dore and representative matches against New Zealand. Competitions matches were played on July 15 and 22 prior to another break for a trial and matches against the Northern Districts on NSW. The six teams played when the senior competition resumed but just one week later, on August 26, North Brisbane forfeited to Ipswich B and four of their players appeared for South United.\nIn fixtures listed in \"The Queensland Times\", South United were due to play Ipswich A on September 2. There is no newspaper report of that match, nor any further mention of South United, in either the \"Times\", \"The Brisbane Courier\", \"Truth\" or \"The Telegraph\". \nThe four remaining teams played on September 9 and 16. Valley-Toombul won both their matches. Ipswich B and South Brisbane each had one win. Ipswich A lost both. On September 23, Valley-Toombul met Ipswich B in, \"the final match of the second round of the Queensland Rugby League's fixtures.\" Scoreless at half-time, Valley-Toombul triumphed 13 to nil as, \"The soaked and mud-bespattered players worked with a will along most unorthodox lines, providing fun and plenty for the onlookers, by their scrambles and slips in the mud and splashes in the pools.\"\nIn sunnier conditions the following Saturday, September 30, Valley-Toombul again met Ipswich B at the 'Gabba. Playing in their maroon and white strip, Ipswich B had a try disallowed early in the match. Later they kicked a goal from a mark. Under the rules of the time, a mark could be claimed when an opponent's kick was caught. At half-time, Ipswich B led two-nil. Superior skills in the scrums secured the Valley-Toombul navy blues a larger share of possession, and they scored three second half tries to win, 13 to 2, and claim the premiership.\nAt the QRFL Annual Meeting in April 1912, it was reported that Valley-Toombul played 11 matches for 9 wins, a draw and one loss.\nJunior Grades.\nThree junior competitions were held, First Grade, Second Grade and Third Grade. Matches began on May 13, although Third Grade may have started one week later. Whilst results of some junior matches were published in the newspapers most weeks, reporting on these matches was inconsistent.\nVenues used for junior matches included the Brisbane Cricket Ground (as a curtain-raiser to a senior game), Albert Park, Albion Flats, Balmoral, Bulimba, Kelvin Grove, Land's Paddock, Paddington Reserve, Toombul, Toowong and West End Reserve.\nTeams in the Junior First Grade competition included Kelvin Gordon, North Brisbane, South Brisbane A, South Brisbane B, St Bridget's, Toowong and Valley. \nFirst Grade Semi-finals were played on September 9, with Toowong beating South Brisbane A and St. Bridget's defeating the team \"leading on points after the second round\", South Brisbane B. On the 16th, St. Bridget's beat Toowong. In a match advertised as a \"Junior Challenge Final\", South Brisbane B defeated St. Bridget's 12 to nil to claim the premiership. Their record was 10 wins and 3 losses from 13 matches.\nThe Junior Second Grade competition comprised at least four teams: Mildura, St. Bridget’s, Toombul and Violet. \nIn semi-finals held on September 9, Mildura defeated St. Bridget's 18-nil and Toombul 22 beat Violet 9. The result of a final, played on the 16th, was a win to Toombul by 19 points to Mildura's 5. Premiers Toombul were undefeated in their 12 matches.\nThe Junior Third Grade competition comprised at least six teams: Britannia, North Brisbane, South Brisbane A, South Brisbane B, Toombul and Toowong. \nNorth Brisbane defeated Toombul in a final on September 9. However, \"By virtue of being ahead in points on the second round, the Toombul club hold the right to challenge.\" In the second final on the following Saturday, Toombul won, but North Brisbane lodged a protest. This must have been dismissed, as Toombul were named as Junior Third Grade premiers in a report given at the QRFL Annual Meeting in April 1912. Toombul's record was 12 matches, 10 wins, 1 drawn, 1 loss. Runner's up North Brisbane played 12 matches for 8 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses.\nIpswich.\nIpswich began the season with the intention of holding a local senior competition as well as two lower grades. Only two of the five clubs that had participated in the 1910 Ipswich Senior premiership nominated for 1911. One senior match was held on May 13, between Belvideres and Starlights, but both sides needed to call upon junior players. At a delegates meeting of the Ipswich Amateur Rugby League on the following Monday, May 15, there was agreement that a second Ipswich team be entered into the QARL senior competition. Senior players not required for either Ipswich team were permitted to play for their junior club.\nThe two lower grade premiership competitions in Ipswich saw teams join after they commenced and teams withdraw before the season ended. The competitions were also disrupted by forfeits, at a rough average of one per week.\nNine teams competed in what was initially called the Junior competition, but later was known as B Grade. Starlight B were the premiers, winning gold medals and a cup presented by the publican of the Commonwealth Hotel, Mr. W. Hartigan. The nine teams were Belvideres, Blackstone, Harrisville (late entry), Montes (also known as Silkstone), St Paul’s, Starlights A, Starlights B, Western Suburbs A and Western Suburbs B (withdrew).\nThe teams that finished second to fifth were invited to compete for a cup donated by the publican of the North Australian Hotel, Mr. Jack Lindsay. This was played as a knock-out in September. On the 16th, St. Paul's defeated Blackstone but Harrisville forfeited to the Belvideres. The following Saturday, Belvideres defeated St. Paul's to claim the Lindsay Cup.\nThe minor competition, also referred to as C Grade, was for Under 18 players. The competition began on May 6 with three teams, Belvideres, Starlights and Western Suburbs. They were joined by the Catholic Young Men’s Society (CYMS) on June 3, Silkstone and St. Paul’s on June 17 and Blackstone on July 14. Belvideres won the premiership without a final being played.\nMaryborough.\nFor the second year, Rugby League competitions were held in Maryborough. All three grades commenced on May 6.\nFour teams entered the senior competition. Howard left to play in a Burrum district competition. Christian Brothers switched from Rugby Union to join Glebe, Natives and Wallaroos.\nSeven teams competed in the Junior grade. Wallaroos were premiers, finishing one point ahead of Natives. They were followed by Glebe, Granville, Past Grammars, Present Grammars and Pialba.\nThree teams competed in the Third grade. Wallaroos were premiers, ahead of Glebe and Natives.\nRepresentative Season.\nNew South Wales.\nIn early June, a representative Queensland team travelled to Sydney to play three matches in eight days against New South Wales. They were defeated by large margins in each encounter: 65 to 9 on the 3rd, 49 to nil on the 7th and 32 to 8 on June 10.\nNew Zealand.\nIn June and July a New Zealand team toured Australia, playing against New South Wales, Newcastle and Queensland, although they did not play against an Australian team. Queensland won the second of three matches.\nNorthern Districts.\nA team billed in the newspapers as New South Wales, but composed of players from the Newcastle and Maitland competitions, visited Brisbane in August.\nPlayers.\nForty-five players represented Queensland in the nine matches played in 1911."

The team played their home games at Jenison Field House in East Lansing, Michigan and were members of the Big Ten Conference. They were coached by Forrest \"Forddy\" Anderson in his third year at Michigan State. The Spartans finished the season with a record of 16–10, 10–4 to win a share of the Big Ten Championship. They received the conference's bid to the NCAA tournament where they beat Notre Dame and Kentucky to advance to the Final Four. There they lost to eventual champion North Carolina. They lost to San Francisco in the third-place game.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 1955–56 season with an overall record of 13–9, 7–7 to finish in fifth place in Big Ten play.\nSeason summary.\nJohnny Green led MSU in rebounding at 14.6 a game and Jack Quiggle led in scoring at 15.3 points per game. Green and Quiggle were both named first team All-Big Ten.\nAfter starting the season 4–3, Green joined the Spartans after he was discharged from the Marines. In his first four games with the Spartans, MSU lost all four games. However, the Spartans won their next 10 games before a loss in the regular-season finale to Michigan. The loss cost the Spartans an out-right championship, but they still earned their first trip to the NCAA tournament as the Big Ten representative to the NCAA Mideast Region.\nIn the NCAA Mideast Regional on Kentucky's campus, the No. 11-ranked Spartans played two games at 10,000-seat Memorial Coliseum: MSU avenged an earlier loss to No. 17 Notre Dame in the semifinal winning 85–83. In the final, the Spartans upset No. 3 Kentucky 80–68 to earn the school's first trip to the Final Four.\nIn the national semifinal, the Spartans faced No. 1 North Carolina. In a game that would be referred to as one of the greatest games in college basketball history, the lead changed 31 times. Quiggle made a half-court shot after regulation expired that would have won the game for the Spartans, but was ruled too late. Green missed a free throw at the end of the first overtime that also would have sealed the win for the Spartans. North Carolina's Pete Brennan made a basket as time expired to force a second overtime. Lennie Rosenbluth took over the Tar Heels in the third overtime as they eliminated the Spartans from championship contention.\nMSU lost to San Francisco in the third-place game the following day.\nRoster and statistics.\nSource\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA Tournament\nRankings.\nSource"

        "text": "The 2016–17 Oakland Golden Grizzlies men's basketball team represented Oakland University (OU) during the 2016–17 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Golden Grizzlies were led by 33rd year head coach Greg Kampe and played their home games at the Athletics Center O'rena in Rochester, Michigan as members of the Horizon League. They finished the season 25–9, 14–4 in Horizon League play to finish in a share for the Horizon League regular season championship. As the No. 1 seed, they were upset in the quarterfinals of the Horizon League tournament by Youngstown State. As a conference champion and No. 1 seed who failed to win their conference tournament, they received an automatic bid to the National Invitation Tournament where they defeated Clemson in the first round to advance to the second round where they lost to Richmond.\nOakland made a three-point field goal in every game of the season, increasing their steak to 904 consecutive games, the ninth-longest active NCAA Division I streak. They last finished a game without a three-pointer on January 30, 1988.\nOff-season.\nWould-be senior point guard Kay Felder forwent his college eligibility and entered the 2016 NBA draft. He was drafted in the second round by the Atlanta Hawks, who traded him to the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers for cash considerations.\nAssociate head coach Saddi Washington left Oakland to become an assistant coach for the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team while assistant coach Dionne Phelps left to return to Arizona to be with his family. Washington and Phelps were replaced by Dan Hipsher and Cornell Mann.\nThe Golden Grizzlies received a commitment from junior college point guard Stevie Clark. Clark transferred from Arkansas Baptist College where he played a season after being dismissed from Oklahoma State after his 2013–14 freshman year. Clark was previously a four-star recruit and was ranked the No. 68 high school senior in 2013.\nOakland also received a commitment from 22-year old, United States Army veteran Isaiah Brock. Kampe recruited Brock on an overseas coaching trip. He thought Brock was athletic, but did not have a lot of basketball experience and probably would not receive much playing time. However, he thought the team could benefit from having Brock on it. Kampe offered Brock a scholarship when his service contract was over. Initially the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled Brock academically ineligible, but after the story made national news, the NCAA reconsidered and Brock was granted immediate eligibility.\nFormer Illinois guard Kendrick Nunn transferred to Oakland after he was removed from the team after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor battery charge. Nunn will sit out the 2016–17 season due to NCAA transfer rules and has one year of eligibility remaining for 2017–18. Nunn was named to the All-Big Ten Conference freshman team and averaged 10.6 points per game in his career at Illinois.\nGuards Chris Gilbert and Alek Frascone both suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries and will miss the season.\nSeason.\nOakland finished in fourth place in the 2016 Great Alaska Shootout. They lost their first game to Nevada and defeated Alaska Anchorage in the consolation bracket and UC Davis in the fourth place game. Junior guard Martez Walker was named to the all-tournament team.\nAfter their win over Robert Morris, the Golden Grizzlies improved to 9–1, their best start in Division I history. The best start in school history is 10–1 during the 1994–95 season.\nDuring a three-game, four-day stretch in December, Oakland lost at home to Northeastern on a buzzer beater and at Michigan State in back-to-back days. Two days later, then defeated Georgia at home 86–79, in the then-fifth-highest attended game in Athletics Center O'rena history. With the win over Georgia, a member of the Southeastern Conference, Oakland is 4–2 all-time against Power Five conference schools at home.\nIn a low-scoring game against UIC, Oakland blocked a school and Horizon League record 18 shots, including one on the final possession to ensure a 58–57 win. The previous school record was 14 blocks, against Duquesne during the 2007–08 season. With the win, Oakland moved to 14–3 (4–0 in the Horizon League) and received a point in the Coaches Poll. They then lost four of the next five games and did not receive votes in any remaining polls.\nOakland set the all-time O'rena attendance record with 4,123 in a 93–88 upset loss against Detroit. The loss was OU's first conference loss of the season.\nAwards.\nBrock was named Horizon League Freshman of the Week after averaging 7.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game during the Great Alaska Shootout. Two weeks later, he received the same award again after scoring 9 points with 5 rebounds and 5 blocked shots in a win over Robert Morris. On February 6, Brock was named both the Freshman and Player of the Week. He was the first Horizon league player to receive both awards in the same week since the league began awarding a weekly newcomer in 2012. He averaged 15 points, 14 rebounds, 3 blocks and 1.5 steals per game in wins over Youngstown State and Cleveland State.\nBrock was honored as a \"Hometown Hero\" by the National Football League's Detroit Lions during a game against the Chicago Bears. He was also honored as a veteran by the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings.\nHayes was named Horizon League Player of the Week January 30 after averaging 22.5 points and 12 rebounds in games against Green Bay and Milwaukee.\nWalker was named Horizon League Player of the Week February 20. He averaged 22 points per game on 57% shooting in two wins over Valparaiso and UIC.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, Hayes was named All-Conference First Team and Walker Second Team. Brock was named to the All-Defensive Team and All-Freshman Team.\nRoster.\nThe following table lists Oakland's roster as of November 4, 2016.\nSchedule.\nThe following is Oakland's schedule.

That same month, Fly and s4 left the team to join Evil Geniuses, with Roman \"Resolut1on\" Fominok joining VGJ.Storm. Due to post-deadline roster changes, OG would no longer be eligible to be directly invited to The International 2018 nor for the Regional Qualifiers and were required to play through the Open Qualifiers. Needing three new members just a few weeks before the qualifiers began, OG quickly signed Topias \"Topson\" Taavitsainen, a newcomer to the scene who had never performed at a major LAN event prior to the event, Sébastien \"Ceb\" Debs, who had previously served as the team's coach, and ana, returning to the team from a year-long break after their previous elimination at The International 2017. Finishing outside of the top eight in the Dota Pro Circuit final standings, which granted a direct invite to The International 2018, OG earned theirs by playing through and winning the European-region open qualifiers.\nFollowing that, OG were then placed into group A of The International's group stage, finishing fourth with a record of 9-7, which seeded them into the upper bracket. There, OG won every series to advance to the grand finals. Facing the lower bracket winner PSG.LGD in it, whom OG had just defeated in the upper bracket finals, OG won the game one, but lost the next two games. Needing another win to avoid losing the series, OG forced a late-game comeback in game four, and subsequently won game five in a similar fashion, making them International champions and winning them over $11 million in prize money. Their victory was considered a Cinderella and underdog success story, as they had come from the open qualifiers and had beaten some of the more favoured and accomplished teams along the way. Their win also broke the historical trend of Chinese teams winning the International in even-numbered years.\nIn November 2018, ana left the team after deciding to take a break from the professional scene, with Per Anders \"Pajkatt\" Olsson Lille and Igor \"iLTW\" Filatov substituting for him until he returned in March 2019. In April 2019, the team played against and lost to the OpenAI Five, a group of artificial intelligence bots that learned to play the game entirely through machine learning, in a live exhibition series in San Francisco. Later that month, Titouan \"Sockshka\" Merloz replaced Cristian \"ppasarel\" Banaseanu as team coach.\nThe team earned a direct invite to The International 2019 by finishing in the top 12 of that season's Dota Pro Circuit. There, they went 14-2 in the group stage, advancing through the upper bracket before defeating Team Liquid in the grand finals 3-1, making them the first ever repeat champion of an International, being awarded $15.6 million out of the $34 million prize pool.\nRestructuring (2020–present).\nThe \"Dota 2\" team went through various changes in January 2020, with ana leaving to take another extended hiatus until the next Dota Pro Circuit season, JerAx announcing his retirement, and Ceb leaving the active roster to help focus on developing other players on the team. To replace them, the team signed Syed \"Sumail\" Hassan, Yeik \"MidOne\" Nai Zheng, and Martin \"Saksa\" Sazdov. Sumail was released from the team in July 2020, with Ceb replacing him as a player.\nIn March 2021, MidOne was removed from the roster, with ana briefly returning to the roster before announcing his retirement in June. Shortly after, the team re-signed Sumail. OG qualified to The International 2021 via regional qualifiers, but were eliminated 2-0 in the lower bracket to the tournament's eventual champion Team Spirit. In April 2021, OG announced the news on its official website that OG and German car brand BMW announced a partnership. In November 2021, the roster underwent significant changes as Sumail and Saksa were released, Ceb announcing his retirement from professional play, while Topson and N0tail left the active roster after deciding to take a break from the professional scene.\nIn November 2021, OG announced an entirely new roster consisting of Artem \"Yuragi\" Golubiev, Bozhidar \"bzm\" Bogdanov, Ammar \"ATF\" Al-Assaf, Tommy \"Taiga\" Le, and Mikhail \"Misha\" Agatov, who had previously served as the team's coach. In May 2022, OG qualified to and participated in the ESL One 2022 Stockholm Major, with Ceb and N0tail standing in for Misha and head coach Evgenii \"Chuvash\" Makarov respectively. Through the lower bracket, OG won their fifth Dota 2 Major, by defeating TSM FTX 3–1 in the grand finals. In August 2022, the team found further success at ESL One Malaysia 2022, defeating Team Aster 3–0 in the grand finals with Chuvash standing in for Misha due to visa issues.\nRosters.\n\"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\".\nIn December 2019, OG announced they had formed a \"\" team, with the organisation signing veterans Nathan \"NBK-\" Schmitt and Valdemar \"valde\" Bjørn Vangså, along with Aleksi \"Aleksib\" Virolainen, Issa \"ISSAA\" Murad and Mateusz \"mantuu\" Wilczewski. Following that, the team signed Casper \"ruggah\" Due as the team coach in January. In September 2020, ruggah was implicated in the coaching bug scandal. As a result, the Esports Integrity Commission (ESIC) and Valve banned ruggah from participating in one Valve-sponsored . In February 2021, the team removed NBK- from the active roster, with ISSAA following suit shortly after. To replace them, the team signed Nikolaj \"niko\" Kristensen in March 2021, and Shahar \"flameZ\" Shushan a month later.\nIn January 2022, OG traded Aleksib for Nemanja \"nexa\" Isaković from G2 Esports, who was a part of the team that was the runner-up in the PGL Major Stockholm 2021. After failing to qualify for the PGL Major Antwerp 2022, OG benched valde and niko in May 2022. To replace them, OG signed Adam \"NEOFRAG\" Zouhar and Maciej \"F1KU\" Miklas. A few months later, the organization replaced the last founding member of the original roster, mantuu, with Abdulkhalik \"degster\" Gasanov.\nOn 8 June 2023, niko ended his stint as a stand-in for OG, becoming a free agent. Later that month, on 19 June, OG announced its intention to rebuild its roster around a core of F1KU, nexa and Iulian \"regali\" Harjău, following the departure of flameZ to Team Vitality. Finally, on June 20, OG transfer listed NEOFRAG and degster, leaving only F1KU as an active member of the roster.\nOn 30 June 2023, OG announced the signings of Iulian \"regali\" Harjău, Nils \"k1to\" Gruhne, and Dion \"FASHR\" Derksen, along with the return of nexa to the active roster. NEOFRAG transferred to Into The Breach on 11 July 2023.\n\"Counter-Strike 2\".\nOn November 14, 2023, OG announced the benching of FASHR, followed by the transfer of nexa to in a return G2 on November 21. OG announced the signing of MOUZ academy player Bram \"Nexius\" Campana on December 21, 2023, and completed their roster on January 4, 2024, following the signing of Israeli player Nikita \"⁠HeavyGod⁠\" Martynenko.\n\"Rocket League\".\nOn January 18, 2024, OG would announce their first ever Rocket League roster that competes in the North America (NA) region.\n\"Valorant\".\nThe team formed a \"Valorant\" division in 2021. In May 2022, OG formed a partnership with the British esports organization, LDN UTD, to compete during the 2022 EMEA Valorant Champions Tour Stage 2. In September 2022, the roster disbanded after OG LDN UTD failed to make the EMEA Valorant partnered team league."

A pitch that is intentionally thrown far outside the strike zone for this purpose is referred to as an intentional ball. Since the season, intentional bases on balls are issued to the hitter at the discretion of a manager.\nBarry Bonds is the all-time leader in intentional bases on balls with 688 career intentional walks.

After this the 'combined district' became known as North and Midlands, although the 'North and Midlands' name was used from 1954 in the Scottish Inter-District Championship.\nThe name of North of Scotland was then only used for the Aberdeenshire and Highland district.\nFormation.\nA North v Midlands match took place on 17 December 1881.\nA North v South trial match was played on 31 December 1881.\nThe North v South match did come off on 30 December 1882; the North winning by 1 try to nil.\nA North v South trial match was arranged for 22 December 1883 but did not come of; but a North team was selected for a match on 29 December 1883.\nAnother North v South fixture was arranged the following year - but again this match failed to come off. Reports of this deemed the annual fixture a 'fiasco'; the \"Dundee Courier\" noting: \"Whatever may have kept the majority of the South men and the St. Andrews men of the North from putting in an appearance, it is questionable whether the Union will care about putting on another meeting which to a portion of those interested seems of so little importance.\"\nThe North of Scotland District was originally formed as the Scottish Northern Counties Football Union in 1887.\nPlayers were capped by their District; they received a cap.\nNorth of Scotland as a separate province.\nThe North of Scotland side was traditionally made up from Aberdeenshire and Highland players.\nIn many instances, especially against touring teams, the North of Scotland District side contained Midlands District players.\nNorth of Scotland trial matches.\nTrial matches for selection to the North of Scotland District side were initially a Reds versus Colours match.\nLater the Aberdeenshire and Highland sides would play trial matches to gain selection to the separate North of Scotland side.\nNorth v Midlands.\nOften, the Midland and North Districts played in a trial match against one another to determine selection for the combined North of Scotland side.\nNorth of Scotland as a combined province.\nUsually the North of Scotland played as a de facto combined side, selecting players not only from the North of Scotland but also those from Midlands District.\nHistorically the combined North of Scotland team played matches against touring teams visiting Scotland from abroad, and also competed in the first season of the Scottish Inter-District Championship in 1953-54.\n1953-54 Scottish Inter-District Championship.\nThis season was the last domestic season where the Midlands received no recognition for their input into the combined North of Scotland side.\nAfter the start of the Scottish Inter-District Championship in 1953-54 season, the Midlands District complained to the Scottish Rugby Union that the North of Scotland District side which competed in that first championship had several Midlands players in its squad and that the Midlands should receive equal recognition for providing their players to the North of Scotland District team. The SRU agreed and the combined team became formally known as North and Midlands in subsequent seasons for the domestic tournament.\nTouring sides.\nHowever against touring sides the name North and Midlands was not used for the combined side until 1978.\nNorth and Midlands.\nThe new name of North and Midlands was used for the combined side from 1954 season onwards in the domestic Scottish Inter-District Championship. From 1978 till professionalism in 1996 the North and Midlands name was also used against touring sides.\nCaledonia Reds.\nThe amateur North and Midlands side evolved into the professional Caledonia Reds side in 1996; one year after rugby union allowed professionalism in 1995.\nHonours.\nThe 'combined' North side only formally played in the inaugural season of the Scottish Inter-District Championship; the 1953-54 season.

The SRU agreed and the combined team became formally known as North and Midlands.\nThe amateur North and Midlands side evolved into the professional Caledonia Reds side in 1996; one year after rugby union allowed professionalism in 1995.\nFormation.\nNorth of Scotland played a Midlands District side on 17 December 1881. The match was shared 1 goal apiece, but it was noted that there were also 2 touch downs in favour of the Midlands side.\nDundee Institution F.P. played a Rest of Midlands side on 23 December 1882.\nThe Midlands District as a formal district rugby union began in 1889. It was originally called the Scottish Midland Counties Football Union.\nIt had a difficult birth. On its founding, the Scottish Northern Counties Football Union - as the North of Scotland District was then called - asked that the Midland Counties formally join the Northern Counties. The North of Scotland District had been founded two years before in 1887.\nThe Scottish Rugby Union proposed that this matter be decided amicably between the two unions.\nThis was not to be and matters came to a head following a dispute over a postponed match in 1892. The co-operation between the Unions broke and thus the Midlands District's independence was reinforced.\nTeams.\nThe Midlands District team which played Glasgow District on 21 November 1984. Glasgow won the match 11–10.\nReport\nThe North and Midlands Under 21 side played a Midlands District Under 21 side.\nReport\nThe Midlands District played the North of Scotland for selection to the North of Scotland team that played in the 1953-54 Scottish Inter-District Championship.\nThe Midlands District side was itself selected after a trial match between Angus &amp; Perth versus Fife.\nSevens tournament.\nThe District used to run an annual Sevens tournament."

The group consisted of four teams: Seeded team, the European champions West Germany, World Cup debutants Algeria, Chile and Austria.\nWest Germany won the group and advanced to the second round, along with Austria. The final game in the group, between these two teams, was one of the most controversial in World Cup history: with both teams knowing a win by one or two goals for West Germany would result in both them and Austria qualifying at the expense of Algeria, after West Germany took the lead after 10 minutes, the remainder of the match was played without any serious attempts from either side to score. This match is famously known as \"The Disgrace of Gijón\". FIFA amended the rules for all future tournaments so that the final group fixtures are always played simultaneously to avoid a repeat of this situation.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

The rankings at the start of 2016/2017 season are determined by prize money earned in the 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 seasons; starting with this season, the players are re-ranked at the beginning of the current season after removing players relegated at the end of the previous season from the ranking list. As points are accrued from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons earlier are dropped. The rankings are used to set the official tournament seedings at various points throughout the season; even though the rankings are officially updated after every tournament carrying ranking status not all the rankings are used as seedings, and only the rankings officially used as seedings are documented below. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2016/2017 season, all of the points from the 2015/2016 season, and the points from the 2014/2015 season that have not yet been dropped."

It is organised by the International Association of Ultrarunners (IAU) and was first held in 1992 – five years after the launched of the World Championships for the distance. The competition features both an individual and national team component. The team race is decided by aggregated the three best times set by a nation's athletes.\nIn its 22nd edition in 2013, a total of 94 athletes representing 19 countries took part in the competition. Winschoten in the Netherlands has been a frequent host of the event, doing so ten times, including the first three editions. (In other years, the area has held an annual race there – Run Winschoten.) The championships has almost exclusively been contested in Western Europe, with the sole exception being the 2003 event in Russia. The editions of the competition from 2007 to 2012 were jointly held alongside the World Championships, with the European athletes within that race being ranked separately for the continental event.\nThe most successful athletes of the championships are Giorgio Calcaterra of Italy and Jonas Buud of Sweden. Each has won the men's title three times, as well as having won a silver and a bronze. Three-time champion Jaroslaw Janicki of Poland is the next most successful and Kajsa Berg is the only woman to have won the championships three times. The championship records are 6:16:41 hours for men, set by Belgian Jean-Paul Praet in 1992, and 7:19:51 hours for women, achieved by Tatyana Zhirkova of Russia in 2003. Russia is comfortably the most successful nation of the championships with nine women's gold medals and eight men's gold medals. Italian and Swedish athletes are the next best performers with six titles each. A total of seventeen European nations have reached the podium."

        "text": "David Jamaal White (born September 9, 1993) is a former American football cornerback. He played college football at Georgia Tech, and was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nWhite was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Brockston and Zina White. He began to play football in the 6th grade. He attended Union Grove High School and played for head coach Paul Borgdorf. In high school he played cornerback and wide receiver where he made the All-Region team and was an honorable mention for All-State. He wore number 9 on his jersey in school because it represented his birth month and day.\nWhite was considered a three star prospect by \"Rivals.com[\", the 34th best in the country at his position. He received a number of offers to play Division I football including those from Georgia Tech, Auburn, California, and Illinois. He ultimately committed to Georgia Tech following his visit to the school on December 9, 2012.\nCollege career.\nWhite chose to major in business administration, and after not receiving a redshirt designation by the Yellow Jackets, played in the last 10 games of the season and forced a fumble in conference play against North Carolina. He followed up his efforts in his sophomore year by playing in every game that season, and starting at defensive back for nine of them. During the Music City Bowl against Ole Miss, White recorded the first interception of his college career in the fourth quarter.\nHe continued to improve in his junior year as he started every game of the season. During the game against the Virginia Tech Hokies, he recorded his second interception and set up what was ultimately the game-winning drive. A week later, he stopped a 75-yard run by forcing a fumble out of the back of the end zone against the Pittsburgh Panthers that went for a touchback. On November 8, 2014, White had his first career touchdown against North Carolina State when he intercepted a pass by Jacoby Brissett by stepping in front of his wide receiver and running it back 48 yards for the touchdown. He finished the season with four interceptions, leading the team. In addition he also led the team in pass break-ups with eight, and also registered one forced fumble. His efforts resulted in him being named an All-Atlantic Coast Conference honorable mention by the media.\nIn his final year with the Yellow Jackets, White started 11 games. He started out the season recording five tackles and five pass break-ups against Virginia Tech. He went on to force a fumble against North Carolina a month later. He finished the year leading the team in pass break-ups, and two interceptions.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nWhite's play in college earned him an invitation to the NFL Scouting Combine. Lance Zierlein of \"NFL.com\" praised him for his patience in coverage and his ability to displace receivers with his jam technique. He also complimented his ability to break on the ball with his short quickness, and noted that he had forced at least one fumble every year he was at Georgia Tech. But Zierlein criticized his \"very\" average recovery speed and his inability to efficiently exercise proper technique in coverage, specifically the fact that he could not turn around fast enough or \"flip his hips\" quickly. He projected White to be a third round pick.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nWhite was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the sixth round, 178th overall, of the 2016 NFL Draft.\nOn November 4, 2017, White was waived by the Chiefs.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nTwo days after the Chiefs waived him, White was claimed off waivers by the Indianapolis Colts. On September 1, 2018, White was waived by the Colts and was signed to the practice squad the next day, only to be released two days later.\nWashington Redskins.\nWhite signed with the Washington Redskins on August 2, 2019. He was waived on August 31, 2019.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nWhite was signed to the Philadelphia Eagles' practice squad on September 30, 2019.\nAtlanta Falcons (first stint).\nOn October 8, 2019, White was signed by the Atlanta Falcons off the Eagles practice squad. He was waived on October 28.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn October 31, 2019, White was signed to the Dallas Cowboys practice squad. On December 30, 2019, White was signed to a reserve/future contract. On April 30, 2020, he was waived by the Cowboys.\nAtlanta Falcons (second stint).\nOn September 23, 2020, White was signed to the Falcons practice squad. He was released on September 29, 2020.\nLas Vegas Raiders.\nOn October 13, 2020, White was signed to the Las Vegas Raiders' practice squad. He was placed on the practice squad/injured list on October 27. He was released with an injury settlement on October 29."

At Stanford, he was a four-year starter primarily at offensive tackle for the Cardinal where he was named to multiple first-team and second-team All-Pac-12 Conference teams. He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nMurphy was born in Mission Viejo, California and attended San Clemente High School. While attending high school he lettered in not only football, but track and field where he was a shot put champion. While in high School he played in the 2012 U.S. Army All-American Bowl and was also awarded the U.S. Army's Glenn Davis Award, awarded to those who represent the Army's \"high standard of excellence in community service, education, and athletic distinction.\" He was named to two All-Orange County teams and as a senior was named the South Coast Conference MVP.\nMurphy was ranked as a five star offensive tackle prospect by Rivals.com and a four star prospect by ESPN.com, ranked 27th overall in the country in the ESPN top 150. As such, he was highly recruited coming out of high school. He received scholarship offers from a large amount of Division I schools including Stanford, Alabama, Arizona, Arizona State, Auburn, and California. He accepted visits from Stanford, Oregon, Florida, and USC.\nCollege career.\nMurphy ultimately decided to play for the Stanford Cardinal. In his first year, he was one of three freshman lineman to play, starting in two games and playing in 14. He wore two jersey numbers, 78 for when on the line of scrimmage and 94 for when he was an eligible receiver. He averaged 25 snaps per game at tight end and offensive tackle.\nIn his sophomore year, Murphy played in 13 games as offensive tackle and tight end.\nMurphy started all 13 games as right tackle in his junior year, where he was named to the All-Pac-12 Conference second-team, as well as Phil Steele's All-Pac-12 second-team. Stanford's offensive line ranked 18th in the country in tackles for loss allowed and 42nd in sacks.\nIn his final year with the Cardinal, he started all 14 games at left tackle and was named a team captain. His play earned him a spot on the watchlists for the Lombardi Award and the Outland Trophy. He finished the year by being named as a third-team All-American by Phil Steele, and to a spot on the All-Pac-12 first-team.\nProfessional career.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nMurphy was projected as a fifth or sixth round pick by Lance Zierlein of NFL.com. He stated that he had a good feel for his position and was aware in pass protection. He also mentioned that he had good pad level against the running back and did a good job of securing blocks. However, he also said that he had average quickness and that speed rushers gave him an issue. Additionally, there was concern that he was \"antsy\" before the snap and that game tape showed him starting early. Even though it was not called by college officials, this would create false start penalties at the professional level.\nMurphy was drafted in the sixth round with the 200th overall selection by the Green Bay Packers. Green Bay had drafted his long time teammate Blake Martinez earlier in the draft in the fourth round. Blake later commented that after Murphy was drafted that he and his family \"were going crazy at my house. It was awesome.\" Murphy later commented that getting a call from the Packers was \"extraordinary.\" Murphy also noted that he was ready to play wherever the team asked him. On May 6, 2016, he signed a contract with the Packers.\nMurphy made his first career start in the 2017 season opener against the Seattle Seahawks at right tackle in place of the injured Bryan Bulaga, and the next two weeks at left tackle in place of the injured David Bakhtiari. On September 26, 2017, Murphy was placed on injured reserve after suffering a foot injury.\nOn September 1, 2018, Murphy was placed on injured reserve. He was released on December 27, 2018.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nOn December 29, 2018, Murphy was signed to the Los Angeles Rams practice squad. He signed a reserve/future contract with the Rams on February 6, 2019. He was waived on April 16, 2019.\nHouston Texans.\nOn October 16, 2019, Murphy was signed to the Houston Texans practice squad. He signed a reserve/future contract with the Texans on January 13, 2020.\nOn September 5, 2020, Murphy was released by the Texans.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn May 16, 2021, Murphy signed with the New Orleans Saints. He was placed on injured reserve on August 17, 2021, and released with an injury settlement on August 25. He was re-signed to the practice squad on December 27, but released the next day.\nDC Defenders.\nOn January 22, 2023, Murphy signed with the DC Defenders of the XFL. He retired after the 2023 season.\nPersonal life.\nMurphy is the younger brother of former Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle Kevin Murphy. "

Its success prompted the team in charge of the Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics to look into including esports presentation technologies used by Riot Games if the bid is successful.\nBackground.\nAfter the 2015 \"League of Legends\" World Championship was held across Europe, the 2016 edition was held in North America.\nThe original prize pool was $2.13 million contributed by Riot Games, with the final amount being calculated after fan contributions stopped on November 6. Riot pledged to add 25% of all revenue generated from selling Championship wards and skins – customizations for the player controlled hero character – to the prize pool. On October 28, the sale of these unique Championship skins had grown the prize pool to $5.07 million, making it the largest single prize pool in \"League of Legends\" history. The final prize pool reached $6.7 million. Riot announced that 40% of the prize pool will be awarded to the winning team and 15% to the runner up. The winning team would also receive 25% of revenue from skins created to commemorate the championship victory.\nTo encourage new viewers to watch, Riot Games set up a second stream specifically for new viewers, which would help explain basic game concepts that more experienced viewers on the regular stream would be familiar with.\nRiot Games collaborated with Zedd, an electronic dance music disc jockey to create \"Ignite\", a dance music anthem for the tournament. The video referenced multiple highlights from previous \"League of Legends\" world championships. As of July 2022, it has almost 90 million views on YouTube.\nTeams and qualifications.\nBased on the results of the 2016 MSI, the European (EU LCS) summer split champion team was seeded to Pool 2, since the European team that participated in the 2016 MSI, G2 Esports, did not qualify for top 4.\nVenues.\nSan Francisco, Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles were four cities chosen to host the tournament.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stage was held at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California. The group stage was played in a best of one double round-robin format, where each team played every other team in their group twice, with the top two teams from each of the four groups advancing to the knockout stage.\nTiebreaking matches were played in groups A and C.\nGroup A.\nThe Cinderella story of the tournament was the run of Albus NoX Luna, the CIS champions who became the first wildcard team to make it to the quarterfinals in the history of the \"League of Legends\" World Championship. European first seed G2 Esports underperformed in this group, while ROX Tigers, the second seed from Korea, won the group as expected, but had to do so by defeating Albus NoX Luna in a tiebreaker game.\nGroup B.\nGroup B's deciding matches all occurred on the last day, when all teams except for the Korean first seed SK Telecom T1 had 2–3 records. In the end, it was Cloud9, the sole North American team to move on, that moved on after exploiting the inconsistent play of the Chinese and Taiwanese teams. I May was also hurt when one of its players was suspended for one match on the last day and fined $2000 for abusive behavior in online games. During Cloud 9's match against Flash Wolves, Zachary \"Sneaky\" Scuderi killed 690 minions, which set a new record for this statistic at worlds.\nGroup C.\nGroup C was the only group without a Korean team seeded first. Its two qualifiers were both considered championship favorites, since H2K-Gaming was a strong European team and EDward Gaming was a strong Chinese team. Despite a 1–2 showing in the first week, H2K managed to make the quarterfinals at the top of its group by winning four straight matches, including a tiebreaker against EDward Gaming, to become the only European team to move on.\nGroup D.\nGroup D was considered to be the group of death because it had three top Korean, Chinese, and North American teams, and a strong European team. Samsung Galaxy, would convincingly win the group with help from the strong play of Kang \"Ambition\" Chang-yong. Royal Never Give Up defeated the North American champions TSM to even their records at 3–3 and win the head-to-head tiebreaker to move on to the quarterfinals.\nKnockout stage.\nQuarterfinals and semi-finals.\nThe quarterfinals were held at the Chicago Theatre, starting on October 13. Teams were seeded against each other based on their performance in the group stage, and played a best-of-five, single-elimination bracket.\nAll three of the Korean teams, SK Telecom T1, ROX Tigers, and Samsung Galaxy, advanced to the quarterfinals from the group stage. Two Chinese teams, EDward Gaming and Royal Never Give Up, advanced by finishing second in their groups. Cloud9 and H2k-Gaming were respectively the only North American and European teams to advance out of groups. The last team to make it to the quarterfinals was Albus NoX Luna, a Russian wildcard team that finished second in its group.\nThree teams from the \"League of Legends\" Champions Korea (LCK) circuit and one from the European \"League of Legends\" Championship Series (EULCS) made it to the semi-finals. H2K-Gaming ended the wildcard run of Albus NoX by sweeping them 3–0 in the quarterfinals. Meanwhile, the three Korean teams ended the runs of EDward Gaming and Royal Never Give Up, the last two Chinese teams, and the run of Cloud 9, the last North American team.\nThe semi-finals were held at Madison Square Garden in New York over two days. SK Telecom T1 won a five-game series against the ROX Tigers, who had won the 2015 Summer \"League of Legends\" Championship Korea season and were favorites to win this event. Many commentators called this matchup the true World Finals and many still call it the greatest best of 5 series in League of Legends esports history. In the other semi-finals, Samsung Galaxy swept H2k-Gaming, the last European team in the tournament, 3–0 to advance to the finals.\nFinals.\nThe final lasted six hours and was played in front of a crowd of nearly 20,000 fans at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. A projection of the minimap which showed each team's map control was shown on the floor of the arena between the two teams. Most of the players for Samsung Galaxy (SSG) had never played in the finals before, while most members of SK Telecom (SKT) were returning members of the 2015 championship team. It was the first finals series in a \"League of Legends\" world championship to go the full five games.\nThe first match of the best of five series lasted 40 minutes and was won by SK Telecom, who were able to attack Samsung Galaxy's undefended base after winning a big \"all-in\" battle between the two teams. The second match was also won by SKT, who were able to continuously build up an insurmountable advantage after winning a battle in the mid-game, ending the game after 31 minutes.\nAfter losing the first two games, Samsung Galaxy won a long third game against SK Telecom. SKT dominated the early stages of the game and built up a lead in both kills and gold. The turning point in this game was a fight over Baron, an important in-game objective, where Samsung Galaxy was able to kill half of SK Telecom's team and destroy two of their turrets afterwards. After winning a similar engagement over Baron later in the game, Samsung Galaxy was then able to quickly destroy five of SKT's defensive towers and win the game. This third game was the second-longest in competitive \"League of Legends\" history, at 71 minutes and 20 seconds.\nSamsung Galaxy then won the fourth game, also after winning a key fight over Baron. Despite losing two inhibitor buildings in their base, SKT was able to stall SSG with defensive play until the 42-minute mark, after which SSG took three Dragons – another in game objective – uncontested and gained buffs that allowed them to win the game. In the final game, SK Telecom played a more cautious gameplay style, which was effective against Samsung Galaxy's riskier play. SKT was able to grab two Baron kills and two Elder Dragon kills en route to winning the final game.\nSK Telecom's team shared a $2 million prize purse between its members. The championship victory was SKT's third in four years, and a successful defense of their 2015 title. SKT also became the first team to win three world championships. ESPN's Timothy Lee called the finals \"an instant classic\". SKT's Lee Sang-hyeok, who uses the handle \"Faker\", was named as the tournament MVP. It was Faker's first Worlds MVP. Faker's performance on the map's middle lane broke the previous 208 kills record at Worlds by the third map of the finals, and he ended up with 217 kills.\nLegacy.\nViewership numbers were higher than those for the 2015 \"League of Legends\" World Championship. 43 million unique viewers saw the finals and peak concurrent viewership for the finals was 14.7 million; 370 million hours of esports were streamed over the course of the entire world championship. The final prize pool, which included fan contributions via purchase of in-game items, was worth $6.7 million. The total cumulative daily unique impressions (the amount of unique viewers that tuned in every day via online and television channels) reached 396 million.\nLA 2024, which is overseeing the Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, was inspired by the success of this edition of the \"League of Legends\" World Championship to plan and include esports in the Olympic Games if they win the bid. Casey Wasserman, the chairman of LA 2024, suggested using technology used in certain segments of the \"League of Legends\" World Championship such as augmented reality and virtual reality to make the Olympics more accessible to a younger demographic."

The top two teams in each group then met in a ‘semi-final’ play-off, with the two winners going through to the first knock-out phase. The remaining teams dropped out of the competition.\n12 teams played home and away in the first knock-out phase, with the 10 teams qualified from groups A and B and the two teams qualified from groups C and D.\nThe six winners of the matches in the first knock-out phase joined with the winners of groups A and B to play home and away for the right to play in the Velux EHF Final4.\nThe culmination of the season, the Velux EHF Final4, continued in its existing format, with the four top teams from the competition competing for the title.\nTeam allocation.\n26 teams were directly qualified for the group stage.\nRound and draw dates.\nThe qualification and group stage draw was held in Glostrup, Denmark.\nQualification stage.\nThe draw was held on 29 June 2016 at 13:00 in Vienna, Austria.

        "text": "The 2017 international cricket season was from May 2017 to September 2017. 13 Test matches, 52 One-day Internationals (ODIs), 12 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is), and 31 Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs) were played during this period. The season started with India leading the Test cricket rankings, South Africa leading the ODI rankings, New Zealand leading the Twenty20 rankings, and Australia women leading the Women's rankings.\nThe season started with a two match ODI series between England and Ireland, followed by a tri-nation ODI series in Ireland (also containing New Zealand and Bangladesh), and a three match ODI series between England and South Africa. These matches served as preparation for the ICC Champions Trophy, which was held in England in June. This was the first Champions Trophy that the West Indies did not participate in, due to them having been outside the top 8 in the ODI rankings on the cut-off date of 30 September 2015. This was immediately followed by the Women's Cricket World Cup, which was also held in England. After these two major events, international cricket resumed with many bilateral series that occurred during the rest of the season including Afghanistan's first ever bilateral tour to the West Indies. Important series included the 6th edition of the Basil D'Oliveira Trophy and the 26th edition of the Wisden Trophy, the latter of which included the first day/night Test match to be played in England. Pakistan were scheduled to tour Bangladesh in July, but the series was cancelled. The season also included Zimbabwe's first bilateral tour of Sri Lanka in 15 years, with Zimbabwe recording their first series win over Sri Lanka.\nDuring the season, many important steps of 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup qualification process took place. ODIs between the 12 teams competing in the ICC ODI Championship were of special importance as only those that are ranked in the top 8 at the end of this season (30 September 2017) qualified directly for the World Cup. This was different from previous World Cups, as Full Members were granted automatic qualification in those tournaments. Those ranked in the bottom four will compete in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier and will be joined by the top four teams in the World Cricket League Championship and the top two teams from World Cricket League Division Two. Matches in rounds 5 and 6 of the World Cricket League Championship and the Intercontinental Cup took place during this season. The World Cricket League Division Three tournament were also held in this season, with the top 2 teams, Oman and Canada, being promoted to Division 2.\nPakistan were also scheduled to tour Bangladesh in July 2017, to play two Test, three ODIs and a T20I match. However, in April 2017, the tour was cancelled.\nRankings.\nThe following are the rankings at the beginning of the season:"

There were 16 boats (80 competitors) from 16 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Germany, the second time the nation had won two consecutive gold medals in the men's coxed four (1900 and 1912 was the first; Switzerland also accomplished the feat in 1920 and 1924). Germany's four gold medals overall was the most any nation won in the event before it was discontinued; four nations (including two German teams, the United Team of Germany and East Germany) won two. Switzerland, which had won three straight medals in the 1920s before not competing in 1932, returned to the podium with a silver medal. Bronze went to France, the nation's first medal in the event since 1924. Both Italy (11th place) and Poland (9th place) had two-Games medal streaks broken.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nSix of the seven nations from the 1932 Games returned, with only New Zealand missing; returning nations included gold medallists Germany, silver medallists Italy, and bronze medallists Poland. Switzerland, a perennial contender that had missed the 1932 Games in Los Angeles, competed once again. The favourites were Germany and Switzerland, with Italy also a strong contender.\nUruguay and Yugoslavia each made their debut in the event. Belgium, France, Germany, and the United States each made their fifth appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nDespite the field growing from 7 boats in 1932 to 16 in 1936, the tournament continued to use a three-round format: semifinals, repechage, final.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe first boat of each heat qualified for the final, while the remainder went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe first boat in each heat qualified for the final."

It was the first (and would turn out to be, only) time that Taylor has been defeated in a World Matchplay final. Van Gerwen also became only the third player to successfully defend the Matchplay trophy after Taylor and Rod Harrington.\nThe second round was also reduced in length from best of 25 legs to best of 21 legs. This still remains the current format for the World Matchplay.\nThis tournament was the first time in the event's history that no matches went into 'extra legs', the first time that Taylor had been defeated in the final after winning his previous 15, and the first time that Robert Thornton won a match at the event. It was also the first time that James Wade was defeated before the World Matchplay quarter finals, after losing to Mervyn King in the first round.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund remained at £450,000 as it has been since the 2014 event.\nFormat.\nIn previous stagings of the event all games had to be won by two clear legs with no sudden-death legs. However, in 2013 after consulting the host broadcaster Sky Sports, the PDC decided that games will now only proceed for a maximum of six extra legs before a tie-break leg is required. For example, in a best of 19 legs first round match, if the score reaches 12–12 then the 25th leg will be the decider."

        "text": "Rocky Point Golf Course is a public 18-hole golf course in Tampa, Florida that is managed by the Tampa Sports Authority.\nHistory.\nRocky Point Golf Course was established in 1911 by the Tampa Automobile Club as the Tampa Automobile and Golf Club, and changed its name to the Rocky Point Golf Club in 1917. It was one of the first golf courses in the state of Florida. The course originally opened in 1912 with the first 9 holes, and construction was completed in 1913. The course was open for 31 years until the US entered World War II in 1942. During the war, the Federal Government closed the course for use as part of Drew Field and built barracks on the property to house prisoners of war. The course also served at this time as recreation for the servicemen stationed at Drew Field.\nIn 1953, the Federal Government turned the property over to the City of Tampa. The City then leased it to J.S. Curly Hurtman for 25 years, who reopened the course with his wife, Merle, in 1954. Merle took over operations when Curly passed in 1957.\nIn 1963, a third stretch of 9 holes was added. The land which originally housed the additional 9 holes is now home to ConnectWise and Labtech Software.\nA community was developed south of the golf course in the late 1950s called Dana Shores. Later, in the 1970s, construction began on another development to the southeast of the course called Pelican Island. Today, both neighborhoods still exist and are thriving community partners for Rocky Point Golf Course.\nOnce the lease expired with the Hurtmans in 1978, the City turned over operations to the Tampa Sports Authority – a special district that was created in 1965 by Governor Hayden Burns for the purpose of planning, developing and maintaining a comprehensive complex of sports and recreational facilities for the Tampa Bay area. In December 1981, Mayor Bob Martinez leased 40+ acres of Rocky Point Golf Course to Critikon Corporation for 99 years in return for a 1.2 million dollar redesign. This included the return from 27 holes to 18 holes. The course reopened on March 5, 1983. The current clubhouse was built and opened in July, 1993.\nCurrent.\nThe Tampa Sports Authority still manages Rocky Point today along with Babe Zaharias Golf Course, Rogers Park Golf Course and Raymond James Stadium.\nToday the 18-hole, par-71 Rocky Point Golf Course features four sets of tees playing from 4,900 to 6,300 yards, offering challenges for all skill levels. $700,000 was put into the golf course in 2015 to update it to more modern standards and it reopened in December 2015. Golfers can experience a pleasurable but adventurous round of golf, with many areas reserved for wildlife habitat and bird sanctuaries. There is also a pro shop and full-service restaurant.\nLocal knowledge.\nIn the early part of the 1900s, the Tampa cigar industry was inundated by frequent strikes and brief walkouts by its workers. This trouble in the cigar industry affected the development at Rocky Point and temporarily delayed the construction of both the clubhouse and golf links."

        "text": "“The Queensland Amateur Rugby League set the air-filled sphere rolling”, opening the competition rounds on 14 May. Three grade competitions were conducted in Brisbane. Ipswich entered a representative team to play the five Brisbane senior teams and also began their own club competition. Club-level rugby league was also played in Maryborough. \nQueensland hosted tours from England and New South Wales and representative matches were also arranged between towns where rugby league was growing.\nSeason summary.\nSenior Grade.\nSix teams competed for the QARL Senior premiership and Francis Cup. East Brisbane and Ipswich joined North Brisbane, South Brisbane, Toombul and Valley.\nTwo round robins of matches were played. After the first round of five matches each, Toombul led. At the completion of the second round, Ipswich were ahead on points. Under the competition rules, Toombul were allowed to challenge Ipswich in a final. No semi-finals were held this year, which is especially unusual as Toombul, Norths, and Valleys all finished on 10 competition points. When the final was drawn 10 all, a second match was required.\nThe first final was played at the Exhibition Ground on 3 September. Attired in their red, white and blue uniforms, Toombul scored two tries, converting one, and kicked a penalty to lead 10 to nil at “lemon time” (half-time). Ipswich, in green jerseys, came back, scoring two converted tries during the second half to level the scores. In the closing stages, “The Ipswichians were playing all over Toombul now, but the latter team defended well, and full time came without further score.” \nThe second final was played at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, Woolloongabba on 10 September. The first half was again close, Ipswich leading two-nil at the break. Ipswich had the better of the second half, and finished the match with a final score of 17-2, winning the Francis Cup.\nClub colours.\nEast Brisbane played in blue and white; Ipswich in myrtle green; North Brisbane in red and black; South Brisbane in sky blue, Toombul in red, white and blue and Valley in navy blue.\nJunior Grades.\nTwo junior competitions were held, First Grade and Second Grade. Participating teams included Kelvin Grove Gordons, Milton, North Brisbane (3), St Bridget's (2), South Brisbane, Valley and Woodville.\nIn First Grade, St. Bridget’s defeated North Brisbane, 8 to 6, in a final played at Woolloongabba on 17 September. North Brisbane, “by virtue of having the greatest number of competition points, hold the right to challenge.” This they did, and won a second final, 8 to 3, at Kedron Park on the 24th, to win the premiership. \nTwo finals were also required in Second Grade, with both played as curtain-raisers to the senior finals. After losing to North Brisbane, leading team South Brisbane, challenged and won, 22 to nil, to claim the premiership.\nIpswich.\nIn addition to entering a team in the QARL senior competition, the Ipswich &amp; West Moreton Amateur Rugby League commenced local club competitions. The five teams in the senior competition were Belvideres, Blackstone, Seekers, Starlights and St. Paul's. The eight teams in the junior competition were Belvideres, Blackstone, C.Y.M. Society, Seekers, Silkstone, Starlights A and Starlights B. \nIn a final held at the North Ipswich Cricket Reserve on 24 September, Starlights defeated Belvideres to claim the senior premiership trophy, the Connell Cup. Belvideres were junior premiers.\nMaryborough.\nRugby League competitions were held in Maryborough. Four teams entered the senior competition: Glebe, Howard, Natives and Wallaroos. Glebe won the premiership, and subsequently played a benefit match against the local Rugby Union premiers. Three teams entered the junior competition: Cities, Glebe and Wallaroos.\nThe Maryborough Rugby League organised a \"Country Week\" event on 11 June, when teams from Gympie and Isis (Childers) were invited to play against Maryborough teams. On Sunday 24 July Maryborough Rugby League arranged a return train trip to Childers where three matches were to be played.\nRepresentative Season.\nEngland.\nA team from Great Britain toured Australia and New Zealand. They played three matches in Queensland, all at the Exhibition Ground in Brisbane. \nThe first of two Test Matches between Australia and England was played in Sydney on 18 June. Before a crowd in excess of 40,000, Australia led 12-11 at half-time, but England finished stronger to win 27-20. Queensland’s only representative in the match, Charlie Woodhead, scored a late try, “by a magnificent piece of play.”\nEngland travelled to Queensland for matches on 25 and 29 June, however between these fixtures, on 27 June, England also played the Kangaroos in Sydney. Nine of the touring party played against the Kangaroos and in one of the matches against Queensland. Billy Batten played all three, with long trips on the “mail train” in between. Note, the Kangaroos team was composed of members of the team that toured England in 1908-09.\nEngland defeated Queensland in both matches, by 33 to 9 on Saturday 25th and by 15 to 4 on Wednesday 29th. Through a penalty goal, Queensland briefly led in the first match, but their only try came after five tries by England. Evan Lewis made a break to send Sid Fenely to the tryline, “where he grounded the leather with several burly Britishers going hard for his scalp.” \nThe Second Test Match between Australia and England was played at the Exhibition Ground on 2 July. The pleasant weather and presence of seven Queenslanders in this Australian side perhaps contributed to an attendance of more than 18,000. The Brisbane Concert Band played during intervals and, “The ladies were present in large numbers, and their variegated gownings gave a very picturesque charm to the surroundings”.\nAustralia scored three tries, converting only the third, to lead 11 to nil. England responded with two converted tries to trail by a point at half-time. The second stanza saw six tries scored but none converted. The “British Lions” put on four tries to lead 22-11. Australia then scored twice to trail by five. \"The Queensland Times\" reported, the “last quarter of an hour furnished probably one of the most exciting bouts of football that have ever been witnessed in a Brisbane arena. The Australians fought superbly to try to equalise matters. Indeed, they were within an ace of scoring on several occasions, with the vast crowd yelling most furiously \"Go on, Aus–tralia!\" ”. Full-time: England 22, Australia 17.\nReturning to Sydney, England next played two matches against Australasia, a composite of Australian and New Zealand players. The first match, on 9 July, was a 13-all draw and Australasia won the second, on 13 July, by 32 points to 15. Herbert Brackenreg was the sole Queensland representative in these matches.\nNew South Wales.\nNew South Wales brought senior and junior teams to tour Queensland in late July and early August. Queensland lost all three senior matches, 21-40 on 30 July, 18-32 on 3 August and 3-19 on 6 August. \nQueensland started the series well, scoring the second, third and sixth tries of the opening match at the ‘Gabba to lead 8-3 and later level at 11-all. \"The Queensland Times\" reported that a crowd of 8,000 greeted the local team’s tries by “cheering vociferously” and providing “tumultuous applause”.\nNew South Wales added two more tries to lead 19-11 at half time but Queensland scored a penalty and two tries early in the second half to reclaim the lead, 21-19. New South Wales, however, finished much the stronger to win. In the second and third matches, New South Wales led by 12 and 13 and half time and had comfortable wins. \nThe junior New South Wales side played matches against the Queensland juniors on 30 July and 6 August, winning both. On 3 August an Ipswich Juniors representative side held them to nil-all well into the second half, before conceding 13 late points. \nPlayers.\nThe following players represented Queensland in the five matches played in 1910: \nVic Anderson (South Brisbane) 3 matches, Herb Brackenreg (North Brisbane) 4*, Charles Brown (Ipswich) 2, Edward Buckley (Valley) 4*, Harold Dickens (Valley) 3, George Duffin (Valley) 3, Sid Feneley / Fennelly (North Brisbane) 2, Alf Foote (Ipswich) 1, Harold Heidke (Bundaberg &amp; North Brisbane) 3, Bill Heidke (Bundaberg) 2*, George Hooker (Valley) 4, Reginald Jarrott (North Brisbane) 1, Alfred Jones (South Brisbane) 2, Evan Lewis (Ipswich) 4, Jack Mann (Ipswich) 1, James McComb (Toombul) 1, Dugald McGregor (Valley) 3*, Phillip McGrory (North Brisbane) 3, Robert Nicholson (South Brisbane) 4*, Arthur O'Brien (Ipswich) 4, August Pioch (Maryborough) 1, George Rousell (South Brisbane) 2, Bill Thomas (Ipswich) 2, Otto Thomsen (Valley) 1, Bob Tubman (Ipswich) 4* and Charlie Woodhead (North Brisbane) 4*. \nThose marked with an asterisk also played in the Brisbane Test Match. Charlie Woodhead played in both Test matches. Herbert Brackenreg played in two matches for Australasia. The player's 1910 club or district is given in parentheses. In the newspapers, Brackenreg was often listed as Brackenrigg and Feneley as Fennelly and James McComb as F. McComb.\nBrisbane Metropolitan team visit Wide Bay.\nThe Queensland Amateur Rugby League arranged for a \"Metropolitan\" team to visit Maryborough and Gympie in September and play matches against the local district team. Led by Bill Heidke the local team triumphed twice, beating the combined Brisbane team by 33 to 8 and 32 to 8. The Brisbane captain, Robert Nicholson, was one of three visiting players sent-off in the first match. The \"Truth\" reported, \"Arthur Johnson had charge of the whistle, and the local news-sheet says of him that he had occasion to send off a couple of Brisbane players who evidently thought the referee should do just as they wished, but seemingly they were disappointed. The game at times was of the wild and woolly variety, with an occasional lurid chunk of the unprinted part of the dictionary thrown in.\""

They were especially noted in the mid-1740s. According to surviving records, the club is believed to have used Lingfield Common as its home venue in the 18th century. The club has survived and its team currently plays in the Surrey County League; its home venue is Godstone Road, Lingfield.\nMatches.\nLingfield is first recorded in June 1739, playing two matches against London. They won the first, on Monday, 18 June at an unknown venue, by two wickets. A return match was played on Wednesday, 27 June at the Artillery Ground but the outcome is unknown.\nLingfield was most prominent from 1744 to 1746. Three of its players were reported to be involved in the London v Slindon match at the Artillery Ground on Saturday, 2 June 1744. The match, which Slindon won by 55 runs, was a major event at the time and its legacy is the world's oldest known scorecard (i.e., which lists the names and scores of all players). The three Lingfield players were not specifically identified but it is possible that they included Collins of Surrey and two players called Stevens. The report says that the team included one player from Addington but there were four Addington players involved in the match and it is possible that one or more of these were connected with Lingfield: Tom Faulkner, Joe Harris, John Harris and George Jackson.\nThe Addington/Lingfield connection was apparent in the next two seasons when a combined team played two matches against Surrey in 1745 and one against a combined London/Surrey team in 1746. The three matches were all played at the Artillery Ground. Addington &amp; Lingfield won the 1746 match. Also in 1745, Addington and Lingfield played each other at Addington on Saturday, 3 August, but the result is unknown.\nLingfield disappeared from the sources after 1746 until Monday, 1 August 1785 when they hosted Sussex on Lingfield Common, Sussex winning by 42 runs. That is the last known reference to the Lingfield club in top-class cricket."

He won a single cap for Wales in the 1929 Five Nations Championship.\nPersonal history.\nRoberts was born in Toxteth, Liverpool in 1909. He was educated at Cardiff High School for Boys before matriculating to Oxford University. In 1934 he married Betty Elliot, daughter of former Wales international Jack Elliot.\nHe served his country in the Second World War, joining the Welsh Guard as an acting captain. Roberts was a freelance journalist and a breeder of prize Welsh pigs. He died in Bodfari in 1969. \nRugby career.\nRoberts first came to note as a rugby player while a student representing Cardiff High School. He played for Cardiff RFC while still a teenager, making his first appearance for the club in the 1926–27 season. On entering Oxford he was selected for the Oxford University student team and won four sporting Blues, playing in the Varsity matches of 1928 through to 1931. In the 1929 match he faced his older brother John Roberts, who was playing for Cambridge. In 1931 Roberts was made the secretary of Oxford University RUFC, and for that year's Varsity game he was made captain of the team. Under his captaincy, Oxford won a 'splendid game'. Writing in 1951 Marshall opined that Roberts 'did more than anyone to win the match for Oxford; Roberts weaving and swaying his way in short, powerful strides'.\nIn 1929 Roberts was selected to play for Wales. This time he was on the same side as his brother, as they faced England in the opening match of the 1929 Five Nations Championship. Roberts played in his preferred fly-half position outside the more experienced Wick Powell. The game ended in an England victory and Roberts was dropped for the next match and didn't represent Wales again. \nDespite a long association with Cardiff RFC, Roberts only played 31 matches for the club. He also played for London Welsh RFC. \nInternational matches played.\nWales"

However, as other clubs opened such as Akureyri Golf Club in 1935 and Westman Islands Golf Club in 1938, the name was changed to Reykjavik Golf Club.\nThe club consists of two 18-hole courses - one at Grafarholt and the other at Korpfulsstadir on the southern outskirts of Reykjavik.\nGrafarholt course.\nThe Grafarholt 18-hole course opened in 1963 and is the oldest 18-hole course in Iceland.

For other baseball players and others associated with baseball who were centenarians, see List of centenarians (sportspeople). For other lists of centenarians, see lists of centenarians.\nActuarial data.\nA study by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company that assessed the vital statistics of more than 10,000 baseball players and general mortality rates in the United States concluded that players whose careers began between 1876 and experienced only 97% expected mortality, those who debuted between and had only 64% expected mortality, and those who debuted between and 1973 experienced only 55% of expected deaths. As early as the 1930s, big league players were exhibiting either a healthy worker effect or the health benefits of the rigorous fitness regimens of professional athletes, or both. However, in this study, vital data on baseball players were limited to those available in the Baseball Encyclopedia. Other smaller studies have shown similar results for players who debuted between and and between 1900 and .\nOne large study examining major league ballplayers with debuts from 1902 and 2004 found that their expected lifespan was almost five years longer than average 20-year-old American males, and that career length was inversely associated with the risk of death, probably because those who play ball longer gained additional income, physical fitness, and training."

In 2020, following reforms to the structure of women's domestic cricket, some elements of the Loughborough Lightning were retained for a new team, named just Lightning and representing a broader region.\nHistory.\n2016–2019: Women's Cricket Super League.\nLoughborough Lightning were formed in 2016 to compete in the new Women's Cricket Super League, partnering with Loughborough University and playing across the Midlands. In the first season of the WCSL, the Lightning finished 3rd in the group stage, progressing to the semi-final, where they were beaten by eventual runners-up Western Storm. The following season, 2017, saw Loughborough miss out on Finals Day, finishing 4th with two wins. \n2018 was Loughborough Lightning's most successful season, as they topped the group with 7 wins from 10 games, progressing straight to the final. However, they were defeated by Surrey Stars by 66 runs after the Stars' Lizelle Lee hit a century. Lightning bowler Kirstie Gordon was the leading wicket-taker of the tournament, with 17. In 2019, the Lightning again progressed to Finals Day after finishing 2nd in the group with 7 victories, but were beaten in the semi-final by the Southern Vipers. Following this season, women's cricket in England was restructured and Loughborough Lightning were disbanded as part of the reforms; however they survived in spirit for a new team, Lightning, who represented a larger area, but retained some of their players.\nPlayers.\nFinal squad, 2019 season"

        "text": "Brookwater Golf and Spa Resort is a 5-star international resort (under development) located at Brookwater, a suburb located 30 kilometres from the Brisbane CBD, Queensland, Australia. It is a joint venture between World Group UK and Maxsen Capital Hong Kong. $750 million Brookwater resort project has been billed as the largest single foreign investment developments in Australia’s history. Upon completion it will also be the first fully integrated golf, day spa, retail, leisure, dining and recreation resort in Australia.\nHistory and development.\nPlanning for the Brookwater Golf and Spa Resort project began in 2012, when Springfield Land Corporation's Chairman Maha Sinnathamby agreed to provide land for the resort development. On October 9, 2014, along with the partners Maxsen World signed a deal with Springfield Land Corporation to build the Brookwater Golf and Spa Resort in Queensland. Initially, the investment in the project was $550 million, later extended to $750 million, which is the largest single foreign investment resort in Australia's history. Maxsen World is a joint venture between World Group in the UK, which has Middle Eastern investors, and Maxsen Capital Group, a Hong Kong-based property management company. Brookwater Resort Investments Pty Limited is the Australian company involved in resort development.\nThe resort is established on 14 hectares of lands at the centre of Brookwater, Queensland provided by Springfield Land Corporation. Designed by Grounds Kent Architects, the resort development approval was granted by Ipswich City Council in February 2015. Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey gave the Foreign Investment Review Board approval to allow joint venture Maxsen World to invest in the resort. The construction of the resort started in 2016. The project was set to be completed in five stages. The first stage of Brookwater resort construction started at a cost of $110 million which proposed to develop 168 resort apartments with private plunge pools. It also includes the central resort facilities including lobby, lounges, business centre and meeting rooms, ballroom, day spa, gymnasium, restaurants and resort retail, indoor and outdoor recreational and leisure facilities, as well as recreation clubs, a wedding chapel and man-made beach. Greg Norman-designed Brookwater Golf Course is located beside the resort area. Initial infrastructure works have completed over the site and adjoining streets, with services routed around, along and through the golf course.\nThe Brookwater Golf and Spa Resort hit the market in late April 2015 with Stage 1 achieving $84 million in sales. Local and international buyers have acquired 134 of 168 apartments.\nFacilities.\nOn completion of all phases, The Brookwater Golf and Spa Resort at First Residence will have 520 residential resort apartments comprising large two bedroom formats with private courtyards, and plunge pools adjoining outdoor areas overlooking Brookwater Golf Course. There will be a tennis stadium and club to host international tour events, a water park, a 12,000m² retail emporium, an aquatic centre designed to Commonwealth Games standards, and a Convention Centre set to host business conferences, exhibitions as well as major events. The convention center will be able to accommodate 2000 people at a time, making it the third largest conference facility in Queensland, after the Gold Coast and Brisbane convention centres. It also include a 15,000m² central resort pavilion, lap pools, a gymnasium, a lobby lounge, 24-hour concierge services,a bridal centre and a wedding chapel along with a Spa, Al fresco restaurants and food markets, street side cafes and boutique retail facilities. The resort features six private clubs including the Executive Club, Family Aquatic Club, Central Recreation Club, International Tennis Club, Family Club and South Rec Club.\nThe resort development area is located 30 kilometres from Brisbane's central business district and 90 kilometres from the Gold Coast. Two international airports are within reach of the area. 300,000 visitors may be generated annually through hosting international tennis and golf tournaments, marathons, business conferences, fashion festivals etc."

        "text": "The FIBA–EuroLeague Basketball controversy is a historical dispute between FIBA Europe and EuroLeague Basketball over control of the European-wide club basketball competitions.\nBackground.\nULEB was founded in 1991 from the Italian, Spanish and French leagues in an attempt to promote theirs clubs financial interests within the FIBA competitions. The union was celebrated with the ULEB All-Star Game, held annually for three seasons, featuring stars from the three leagues and also NBA guests like Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan. In 1996 the Greek league joined ULEB.\nThe Champions Cup was originally established by FIBA Europe, and it operated under its umbrella from 1958 until summer 2000, concluding with the 1999–00 season. In the 1990s the name changed to \" European League\" as runners-up were also included in the competition and the teams competed in groups rather than knock-out games. In 1996 it was renamed to \"FIBA EuroLeague\".\n2000-01 split.\nIn May 2000, ULEB under its president Eduardo Portela, representing the richest and most popular European basketball clubs from Spain, Italy and Greece, decided to take over the competition under the name of ULEB Euroleague, against FIBA and Borislav Stanković's will. Stanković's stiff stance over the top European clubs' demand seemed to play a major role in their decision. At the time FIBA's media company handling the TV rights distribution was ISL. The new competition was financially backed by Telefonica, a Spanish multinational telecommunications company which offered 35 million dollars per season for the next 4 years (2000-2004). EuroLeague immediately hired 54 FIBA referees, with Kostas Rigas as the commissioner.\nFIBA's biggest mistake was that it had never trademarked the \"EuroLeague\" name, even though it had used it since the mid-nineties. The leading European clubs therefore used the EuroLeague name for their new competition which started in 2000. FIBA responded by launching their new SuproLeague competition.\nMost of the leading clubs joined EuroLeague, although Panathinaikos, Maccabi Tel Aviv and CSKA Moscow stayed with FIBA who threatened to ban EuroLeague teams from their domestic leagues. Federations from Turkey, France and Russia did not allow their teams to apply for the new competition, but only for the FIBA sanctioned SuproLeague.\nThe 2000 split had as a result the cancellation of the very successful FIBA All-Star Game in the 2000-01 season as many of the best players (Dejan Bodiroga, Manu Ginobili, Alphonso Ford) were playing in EuroLeague. At the end of 2000-01 there were two European champions: Maccabi Tel Aviv from FIBA and Virtus Bologna from ULEB. The latter changed the format of the EuroLeague with a best of three final and no Final Four, while SuproLeague hosted it in Paris.\nIn February 2001, delegation from the both sides met with an aim to unify the competitions as it was clear that European basketball could not financially handle two top tournaments. Eduardo Portella and Jordi Bertomeu from ULEB and Borislav Stanković, Patrick Baumann, Giorgos Vassilakopoulos and Shimon Mizrahi from FIBA. Following the 2000–01 season, the ULEB (Euroleague Basketball) seemed to be in a better position than FIBA Europe, having wealthy Telefonica on its side and already trademarked the \" Euroleague\" name, while SuproLeague was discontinued after a single season. FIBA's media company reportedly owed 152 million dollars without paying the SuproLeague teams over their TV rights. Thus, Maccabi, Panathinaikos and CSKA Moscow decided to join EuroLeague.\nIn 2001 FIBA agreed to give up the running of Europe's top competition and the 2001-02 Euroleague was a unified competition with ULEB as the main organiser. International Sport and Leisure and Media Pro Agency would both sponsor the competition. Telefonica owned 70 percent of the league in partnership with the EuroLeague itself (25 percent), and the Media Pro agency (5 percent).\nAfter a new argument with ULEB in October 2001, FIBA attempted to launched its own top competition, the FIBA Champions Cup in 2002. Korać Cup and Saporta Cup were abolished for that reason. The Champions Cup which featured 15 domestic champions failed to become a competitive league to the Euroleague, despite Euroleague's financial debts to its teams. On 22 July 2002 ULEB had also announced the launch the ULEB Cup as its 2nd tier competition. Euroleague teams like Panathinaikos and Unicaja Malaga seemed close to chose the FIBA Champions Cup, but they decided to stay and strengthen ULEB's position. In 2002 Telefónica also extended its commitment to the EuroLeague until 2009. Telefónica had originally agreed to pump in $35 million a season for five seasons under the original deal, but that amount was reduced when the agreement was prolonged.\nIn May 2003 following ULEB's financial problems, FIBA decided to create a new competition with 30 teams, similar to SuproLeague. At the time EuroLeague seemed to owe money to its clubs and the new FIBA project was presented appealing as the teams would be free to negotiate their broadcasting rights. While top teams like Panathinaikos and Olympiacos BC seemed to be tempted, at the end only a total of 11 champions and runners-up joined the FIBA Europe League.\nIn November 2004, FIBA and EuroLeague officially came to an agreement, to take effect as of the 2005–06 season. FIBA agreed to sanction the two top tournaments, but these would be run by ULEB, whilst FIBA would directly run the other European club tournaments, the FIBA EuroCup and the FIBA EuroChallenge. An official contract was signed by both sides, regulating the organization of club competitions in Europe and ULEB's obligation was to pay annually a fee of €400,000 to FIBA Europe.\n2009: ECA takes over.\nECA was founded in 2006 and it gradually started limiting ULEB's role in the running of its two competitions. In 2008, when Eduardo Portela stepped down, ULEB became more cooperative with FIBA. As soon as EuroLeague competition was transferred from ULEB to ECA in 2009, ULEB remained a minority shareholder via EuroLeague Basketball, but lost control over the competition.\nSince 2010, ECA has undertaken ULEB's obligation to pay the annual fee of €400,000 to FIBA Europe. However, ECA purported to terminate the agreement in December 2012, invoking the announced change to the FIBA calendar as of 2017.\n2015-17 controversy.\nIn June 2015, FIBA announced it would start a new league to compete with EuroLeague Basketball. They also tried to take the helm by convincing eight of the eleven teams with a EuroLeague A-licence to play in a new FIBA competition, Basketball Champions League. This proposal was unanimously rejected by the clubs. The other 8 spots would have remained open for clubs via the domestic leagues, with two qualifying rounds.\nIn November 2015, EuroLeague Basketball agreed to a 10-year marketing joint venture with IMG, which would invest 35 million euros per season. In its press release, the EuroLeague announced a new competition format for the 2016–17 season, identical to the one proposed by FIBA, with only 16 teams including the eleven A-license clubs (Anadolu Efes, Baskonia, CSKA Moscow, FC Barcelona, Fenerbahçe, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Olimpia Milano, Olympiacos, Panathinaikos, Real Madrid, and Žalgiris), playing in only one group with a double round-robin, with the top eight playing in a best-of-five playoffs round to decide qualification to the 2017 EuroLeague Final Four.\nAfter its initial proposal was rejected, FIBA changed the format of the Basketball Champions League, with qualification based on performance. This competition was officially launched on 22 March 2016.\nThreats of suspension.\nDespite the offer of FIBA to all European national basketball federations, many clubs instead agreed with EuroLeague to participate in the 2016–17 EuroLeague, or 2016–17 EuroCup. Regional leagues like the Adriatic League and VTB United League, as well as many national domestic leagues, signed contracts with EuroLeague Basketball for the right to participate in its competitions.\nBecause of this, FIBA threatened to suspend 14 European basketball federations from EuroBasket 2017. Notified national organisations were given until 20 April 2016 to explain their stance.\nOn 16 April, FIBA asked Germany to take over the hosting of the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament from Italy, which was at risk of suspension. In the end, no suspensions were applied.\nReactions.\nGreece.\nGeorgios Nikolaou, director of communications of AEK Athens, after its defeat against PAOK, in the first game of the Greek League quarterfinals, stated that his club, \"will not be blackmailed by anyone, and doesn’t get any kind of messages by anyone\".\nLithuania.\nOn 20 April 2016, the Lithuanian Basketball Federation suspended BC Lietuvos Rytas for their agreement with EuroLeague. Subsequently, the club from Vilnius would be disqualified from the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL). Remigijus Milašius, president of the LKL, refuted their arguments and said that FIBA \"promised a lot of money, which they do not even have\".\nŠarūnas Jasikevičius, head coach of Lithuanian team BC Žalgiris, argued that \"playing in a FIBA tournament means taking a 20-year step back\".\nRussia.\nAndrei Kirilenko, president of the Russian Basketball Federation, requested the VTB United League to suspend the participation of all Russian teams in ULEB competitions. He also said the contract with VTB would be voided if the league refuses.\nSpain.\nFrancisco Roca, president of the Spanish ACB, said \"the ban is unfair and unfounded\", there is not any ban for Spanish teams from playing in FIBA competitions, despite agreeing to the contract with EuroLeague Basketball.\nThe Spanish Basketball Federation requested that the ACB suspend its agreement with the EuroLeague. The ACB answered stating that it cannot impede clubs from joining their tournaments, and that the possible suspension of the Spanish national team was not its fault.\nOn 13 May, the Supreme Council for Sports of Spain unilaterally cancelled the agreement between the ACB and EuroLeague, with the aim to avoid the suspension to the men's national team. The Clubs Association (ACB) regretted the action of the council, arguing that it restricts the clubs' freedom to choose the competition they want to play in. Also, it reminded that FIBA did not explain the reasons for the possible suspension.\nSlovenia.\nThe Slovenian Basketball Federation, despite the possible suspension of its national team, supports FIBA in \"its efforts to take action against ECA’s allegedly anti-competitive and illegal practices\", but does not understand the suspension, as the federation does not have any rights in the Adriatic League.\nSuspension of ABA League.\nOn 13 April, ABA League, comprising teams from the former SFR Yugoslavia, agreed with EuroLeague on a four-year contract, for one EuroLeague and three EuroCup spots.\nBecause of this agreement, FIBA threatened to suspend the six national federations, and on 30 April it suspended ABA League. This official recognition was in place since 2009. Krešimir Novosel, director of ABA League, said that he was unsure about reasons for suspension, after the ABA had reformed its league to follow the criteria of FIBA.\nCollaboration proposals.\nOn 3 May, EuroLeague presented a collaboration proposal to FIBA, with integration into EuroLeague governance, and the possibility of accepting the new playing windows schedule for the FIBA World Cup qualifying games as main points.\nTwo days later, FIBA sent a letter to EuroLeague, requesting that they agree that FIBA's newly formed Champions League becomes the new European-wide second-tier competition instead of EuroCup, agree to the new FIBA national team calendar, and on the future expansion of the EuroLeague to 24 teams.\nThreats of suspension of teams.\nIsrael.\nOn 28 June, the Israel Basketball Association (IBA) informed that Hapoel Jerusalem, which signed a contract to participate in the EuroCup, would not be allowed to register and play in the Israeli Basketball Premier League. In response, Maccabi Tel Aviv, one of the teams with EuroLeague A-license, announced that they would possibly also refuse to register to the Premier League.\nItaly.\nIn July 2016 it was announced that Reggio Emilia, Dinamo Sassari, Trento, and Cantu would be withdrawing from the EuroCup. Had the teams not pulled out of EuroCup, they would have been excluded from Serie A.\nRussia.\nOn 27 June, just after participants of the 2016–17 EuroLeague and EuroCup Basketball were revealed, Andrei Kirilenko, president of the Russian Basketball Federation, announced that the four Russian participants in EuroCup (Khimki, Lokomotiv Kuban, Nizhny Novgorod, and Zenit Saint Petersburg) would be disqualified from national domestic competitions, and that their players would be banned from playing with the Russian national team.\nSpain.\nOn 2 August, Jorge Garbajosa, recently elected as president of the Spanish Basketball Federation, sent a letter to the six Spanish clubs that were registered in the EuroCup (Bilbao, Fuenlabrada, Gran Canaria, Málaga, Murcia, and Valencia), accusing them of violating the rules of Spain's Supreme Council of Sports. This organisation of the Spanish government had previously cancelled the ACB-EuroLeague agreement.\nGreece.\nThe Hellenic Basketball Federation initially threatened to ban AEK Athens from the Greek Basket League, if it did not switch from the EuroCup to FIBA's Basketball Champions League. After AEK initially refused to switch to the Champions League, the Hellenic Basketball Federation then refused to grant Greek League player licenses for all of AEK's new signings. if they remained in the EuroCup. As a result of this, AEK had no other choice but switch to the Champions League.\nExpansion of the Basketball Champions League.\nOn 19 August, FIBA announced the expansion of its Basketball Champions League to 40 teams in the regular season, after allowing AEK Athens, Partizan and Stelmet Zielona Góra to play in it. The three teams previously withdrew from the EuroCup, weeks after this competition announced groups and schedule.\nAs consequence of this, the EuroCup reduced its competition to 20 teams.\nReturn to threats of suspension.\nIn November 2016, FIBA sent new letters to the national federations of Slovenia, Montenegro and Macedonia, asking them to take measures against clubs which compete in EuroCup. After this, Montenegrin federation suspended Budućnost VOLI from all domestic competitions.\nPromotion from Basketball Champions League to EuroLeague.\nIn November, FIBA returned to talk with EuroLeague Basketball, wishing a EuroLeague spot to the Champions League winner, but EuroLeague Basketball CEO replied this would mean \"jump from European third to first division in an attempt to finish with EuroCup\".\nReturn of Italian, French and Turkish clubs to EuroCup.\nIn January 2017, the Italian clubs wanted to return to EuroCup. In February, the French clubs also wanted to return, despite French basketball federation is one of the most faithful supporters of Basketball Champions League. In March, Italian federation said it will give freedom to join any European competition from 2017–18 based on sports merit. Days later, Turkish Basketball Federation made the same statement, and French club ASVEL Basket, chaired by NBA player Tony Parker, confirmed it will join EuroCup.\nLuxembourg court decision.\nOn 26 June 2017, the Luxembourg Commercial Court issued a favorable ruling for FIBA Europe amidst the long standing dispute with EuroLeague Basketball. EuroLeague Properties was called to pay the sum of €900.000 to FIBA Europe, plus an additional fee of €1,500 and take care of all the costs by trial procedures. The court also decided that introduction of the new calendar doesn’t mean a contract breach from FIBA Europe. This was the case made by EuroLeague Properties for declining to pay the fee from 2012 to 2015.\nNational teams windows.\nFor the 2019 World Cup, FIBA established a new qualification system, using six weekends during the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, when the qualifiers will interrupt the club competitions.\nIn May 2017, the National Basketball Association made a statement that the NBA teams will not loan their players to the national teams. Days later, Euroleague Basketball's CEO Jordi Bertomeu made the same statement.\n2020: ULEB with FIBA against EuroLeague.\nIn October 2020, ULEB representing 11 major basketball leagues in Europe, and a minority shareholder in EuroLeague Basketball, asked EU antitrust enforcers to act against organiser EuroLeague Commercial Assets (ECA) for allegedly blocking other teams from taking part in EuroLeague. ULEB president Tomas Van Den Spiegel said in a statement: \"We believe that all of our clubs must be able to compete at the highest level and we want to keep the dream of international basketball alive for every club at every level. The alleged anti-competitive behaviour includes EuroLeague granting 10-year licences to the 11 shareholder clubs without any transparent award process and reducing the number of available slots in the competition to just 18 from 24\". The commission confirmed receipt of the complaint, saying it would assess it."

        "title": "1908 Queensland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The first season of Rugby League in Queensland saw the formation of an association in March 1908, footballers begin training in the new code by early May, and the first in a series of representative matches played on 16 May. Club football began after teams representing Queensland had played, and then only as junior matches.\nProfessional Rugby.\nA catalyst for Rugby League beginning in Australia was a tour by New Zealand footballers, as professionals. In the month of August 1907, meetings of players from most Sydney Rugby Union clubs, \"and others interested in the professional movement\", formed the NSW Football League. Speakers at a meeting stated the League's aim to liberally cover expenses incurred by players due to injury or travel. From the players in attendance, a team was selected for matches against the New Zealand professionals on 17, 21 and 24 August.\n \nAs noted in the newspapers, the expectation was that players involved in these professional matches would be banned from returning to the amateur sport of Rugby Union and, probably from participating in other amateur sport.\nIn reports and published letters to newspapers, the merits and faults of Rugby Union's governing body, and the aims and play of the new code were discussed. The developments and matches in Sydney were followed in the Brisbane papers. In one short report in the Brisbane \"Telegraph\", Dally Messenger was the one player named, amongst several, as switching to the league. \nAfter playing for New South Wales against the New Zealanders, Messenger joined their tour of northern England. The team played matches against Northern Union clubs throughout October, November and December. In January 1908, as the first Australian Rugby League clubs were being formed in Sydney, the New Zealanders played international matches against Wales and England.\nRugby League arrives in Brisbane.\nOn 11 March speakers at the annual meeting of the South Brisbane Rugby Union Club warned of the approach of professionalism. \"The Brisbane Courier\" reported, \"Mr. D. Carter made more direct and pointed remarks when he stated that efforts were being made to form at least two senior professional teams in Brisbane. The Exhibition ground had been engaged, he said, and matches arranged with New South Wales and New Zealand.\" \nOn 27 March a notice in \"The Telegraph\" stated, \"Queensland Rugby Association have engaged the grounds for football practice on Wednesdays, after Monday, 4th May.\"\nOn 7 April \"The Telegraph\" reported on the formation of the Queensland Rugby Association: \n\"It is claimed that the Queensland Rugby Association has been formed with a view to bettering the existing conditions of footballers in Queensland. Its opponents declare that it is intended to promote professionalism, but the promoters object to the term professional.\"\nThe report also listed the \"main objects\" of the association:\nThe inaugural executive committee of the Queensland Rugby Association was: Alf Faulkner (Chairman and Treasurer), Sine Boland (Secretary), J. A. O'Connor, George Watson, John Fihelly, E. L. Buchanan, and Micky J. Dore.\nSeason summary.\nRepresentative matches.\nThe inaugural club competition in New South Wales began in Sydney on 21 April and club matches ran in parallel to representative matches through May, June and July. The first lot of representative matches were played against the returning New Zealand team in Newcastle and Sydney.\nNew Zealand.\nThree Queensland footballers, Doug McLean, Micky Dore and Robert Tubman played for Australia against New Zealand in Sydney on 9 May. Another three Queenslanders were unavailable for selection due to work commitments.\nThe touring New Zealanders arrived in Brisbane on Friday 15 May, and after a reception at their hotel, went to have a look at venue for their matches. There, \"The members of the team trained on the Exhibition ground, and also coached some of the Queensland team in the points of the Northern Rugby Union game.\"\nThe first formal Rugby League match in Queensland was played on 16 May between Queensland and New Zealand teams. Queensland had the honour of scoring the first points, through a try in the corner by Arthur O'Brien. New Zealand responded with two quick tries. With a further two tries by the visitors, and all goal kicks unsuccessful, the half-time score was New Zealand 12, Queensland 3. After conceding a try to Doug McLean early in the second half, New Zealand took their score to 34, before a rally by Queensland saw tries to Bill Hardcastle and George Watson. At full-time, New Zealand 34 had defeated Queensland 12.\nThe following days and weeks saw the New Zealand team undergo an emotional trial due to the passing of one of their leading members, Albert Baskerville. Having \"caught a chill\" on the ship voyage from Sydney, Baskerville entered hospital on Sunday, \"suffering from pneumonia\". He died on Wednesday evening, 20 May, aged 25. Baskerville had been one of a small group that organised the tour, acted as its travelling secretary and, when those duties permitted, he played as a wing three-quarter. In the Test match in Sydney on 9 May he had scored a try.\nHaving beaten a Brisbane team 43 to 10 earlier on the day that their teammate died, the New Zealand All Blacks were weakened by the departure of six players to accompany the body and make funeral arrangements. The remaining members continued on, keeping appointments to which, weeks earlier, Baskerville as secretary may well have consented.\nAll but one of the Brisbane team had played in the first match, but Queensland were now strengthened by the inclusion of Bundaberg's Bill Heidke and a guest, Dally Messenger.\nMessenger opened the scoring prior with a long range penalty goal, prior to a period in which, \"the play shifted from one end to the other, with amazing rapidity.\" New Zealand had a try disallowed but soon after equalised with a goal. A field goal shy of half-time gave the \"All Blacks\" the lead. Two tries early in the second stanza, one converted, extended that lead to ten points. Breaks by Mickey Dore and Messenger were stopped short of the try-line by New Zealand's scrambling defence, a penalty reducing the deficit to eight. Bill Heidke made a break down the wing and found George Watson in support. Surprisingly, Messenger missed the conversion attempt from in front of the posts, \"but he made amends after kicking a penalty goal from what seemed an impossible distance and a very difficult angle.\" New Zealand, playing one short throughout the match, continued to attack and defend until the final minutes, when, \"in the centre Messenger got possession and scored a wonderful try in the corner.\" His kick went astray, and the match finished as a 12-all draw.\nThe final game in Queensland was against Australia on the 30th. New Zealand won 24–12. This match was the second in a three match Test series. Four Queenslanders - J. Edward Baird, Micky Dore, Bill Hardcastle and George Watson - played in the Australian team.\nNew Zealand Māori.\nThe New Zealand Māori team played five matches in and against Queensland. The first three were held at the Exhibition Ground in Brisbane on 27 June, 1 July and 4 July. Queensland lost the first two (16-19 and 5-13) but won the third (6-5). \nIn the fourth match, played in Toowoomba on 7 July, \"A regrettable incident happened past within a few minutes of full time, and the game ended abruptly\". After a scuffle between players, a Maori forward struck a Queensland player and he, in turn, was struck by a spectator as some of the crowd entered the field. The referee, Micky Dore, \"ordered the offending player off the field, and [Māori captain] Asher resenting the action led his men off the field, followed by a \"howling\" mob of spectators\". Holding an 11 to 9 lead, the Queensland players remained on the field until full-time. \nRemarkably, the Māori team kept their commitment in Warwick the following day, 8 July, but Queensland won that match, 23 to 14.\nInter-state Matches.\nA Queensland team ventured to Sydney to play three matches, two against New South Wales on successive Saturdays and a mid-week match against a Sydney Metropolitan team. All were played at the Royal Agricultural Ground. With a full strength side, New South Wales won 43-nil on 11 July.\nEarly in the Wednesday match the visitors equalised at five-all, as \"keeping their footing on treacherous ground, the Queenslanders passed beautifully, the ball going from Fihelly to Hardcastle to Thompson, who scored in the corner.\" At the outset of the second half, \"[Arthur] O'Brien made a great run down the centre, taking long strides, and fending off four tacklers in turn he scored a splendid try in the corner.\" This took the score to 12–8. Sydney Metropolitan, \"playing with magnificent combination\" then ran away with the match to win, 37–8.\nThe third match was played as a curtain raiser to an Australia versus New Zealand Māori match. Queensland opened the scoring: \"A great sprint by the northerners transferred the scene to the home team's territory. Some fine forward play was wound up with a try, secured by Olsen.\" The second string NSW side, however, won by 12 points to 3. \nClub matches.\nThe teams that appeared in newspaper reports included Milton, North Brisbane (A &amp; B), St, Bridget's and Toombul.\nOn 4 July, in a curtain-raiser to the third Queensland versus Māori match, two junior teams met. Valley 10 defeated Toombul 8. \nThe \"Brisbane Courier\" listed the playing line-ups for a match between North Brisbane (in red and black) and Toombul (wearing red, white and blue) on 18 July and printed the result, Toombul winning by 30 points to 5, the following Monday. \nThe season concluded on 12 September with a match between Toombul and a Combined Thirteen. Toombul won the match, 37 to nil, and consequently, \"were awarded the silver medal and their captain a gold medal, while A. Dutton wing forward of the Toombuls was awarded a gold medal for best individual player.\" "

        "text": "Luke Thomas Farrell (born June 7, 1991) is an American professional baseball pitcher in the Washington Nationals organization. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City Royals, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, Minnesota Twins, and Cincinnati Reds. He made his MLB debut in 2017.\nCareer.\nAmateur.\nFarrell attended Saint Ignatius High School in Cleveland, Ohio, and Northwestern University, where he played college baseball for the Northwestern Wildcats. In 2010, his freshman year, he was diagnosed with a schwannoma, a benign nerve sheath tumor on his jaw, that required surgical removal. He developed another tumor that was removed and treated with radiation therapy in 2011. In his four years at Northwestern, Farrell had 208 strikeouts, and was awarded with the Big Ten Medal of Honor his senior season.

He played in the top division of Welsh club rugby for Swansea RFC and Bridgend RFC between 1983 and 1997.\nWilliams made his début for Swansea RFC in 1983 and played three full seasons for the club before moving to Bridgend RFC. Bridgend won the Snelling Sevens tournament in 1987, with Williams the recipient of the Bill Everson Award for the Man of the Tournament.\nWilliams returned to Swansea for the 1991/92 season. During his second stint, the club won the Welsh Premier Division title in the 1991/92 and 1993/94 season and won the SWALEC Cup in 1994, having finished as runner up in 1992.

        "text": "In 2012, Kent County Cricket Club competed in Division Two of the County Championship, Group C of the 40-over Clydesdale Bank 40 and the South Group of the Friends Life t20. Kent also hosted a first-class match at the St Lawrence Ground against the touring South Africans. At the start of the season, Kent played a three-day MCC Universities match at Oxford MCCU, but this match did not have first-class status. It was the first season in charge for new head coach Jimmy Adams after the departure of Paul Farbrace who had been the club's Director of Cricket for two seasons. The club captain was former England batsman Rob Key who had been club captain since 2006. Brendan Nash joined Kent as their overseas player.\nKent finished third of nine in Division Two of the County Championship, narrowly missing out on promotion to Division One. The county performed well in the Clydesdale Bank 40, winning 7 out of 9 completed matches, but missed out on qualification for the knockout stages despite finishing level on points with group runners-up Warwickshire. A surprise loss to the Unicorns and a no result against the same opposition when rain forced an abandonment after Kent had restricted their opponents to just 177/8 ultimately proved costly, and Kent missed out on a semi-final appearance after losing their final match against Sussex. The Friends Life t20 campaign was disappointing for Kent, with the side winning just 4 out of 10 matches and finishing in 4th place (out of 6) in the South Group.\nAt international level, James Tredwell played One Day Internationals for England during the English summer, playing in a single match against Australia and later three matches against South Africa. Tredwell also played two First Class matches for the England Lions against Australia A. Matt Coles also played in one of these matches for the England Lions.\nSquad.\nKent signed five players ahead of the 2012 season. Fast bowler Charlie Shreck joined from Nottinghamshire in September 2011. Veteran batsman Mike Powell signed for the county after spending 15 seasons with Glamorgan in November. Durham all-rounder Ben Harmison was the third new signing before the end of 2011 when he joined Kent in December. Kent signed Australian-born West Indian batsman Brendan Nash as their overseas player for 2012 in March. The other addition to the squad saw batsman Scott Newman join on loan for the first two months of the season from Middlesex as cover for Daniel Bell-Drummond who was on England Under-19 duty. Newman had dropped down the pecking order at Middlesex after the arrival of Joe Denly from Kent after the end of the 2011 season. Denly had made his debut for Kent in 2004. In addition to Denly, Martin van Jaarsveld had also left the county after the 2011 season. He had been with Kent since 2005 and initially agreed to join Leicestershire, but later cancelled the deal and instead announced his retirement from county cricket in November 2011, citing fatigue. Simon Cook, who had also joined the county in 2005, retired from playing towards the end of the 2012 season.\nMCCU match.\nKent's 3-day match against Oxford MCCU in May did not have first-class status."

Contested over 267 laps on the 1.5 mile (2.4 km) asphalt speedway, it was the 11th race of the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup season, The race had 16 lead changes among different drivers and six cautions for 30 laps.\nReport.\nBackground.\nKansas Speedway is a tri-oval race track in Kansas City, Kansas. It was built in 2001 and hosts two annual NASCAR race weekends. The Verizon IndyCar Series also raced at here until 2011. The speedway is owned and operated by the International Speedway Corporation.\nEntry list.\nThe entry list for the Go Bowling 400 was released on Monday, May 2 at 9:56 a.m. Eastern time. Forty cars are entered for the race.\nPractice.\nFirst practice.\nKurt Busch was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 29.049 and a speed of .\nFinal practice.\nMartin Truex Jr. was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 28.770 and a speed of .

The gremlins were remedied and he returned to the track.\nQualifying.\nMartin Truex Jr. scored the pole for the race with a time of 28.284 and a speed of . Truex said afterwards that his team \"had speed here this weekend for sure and feel pretty good about this car in race trim as too. We feel like we made some mistakes throughout qualifying and it took us a while to figure out this three round deal. Things have really been going well for us and clicking well. I love this race track. We’ve really been able to perform well here.”\nMatt Kenseth, who qualified second, said that the \"Toyota's had a lot of speed in them\" and that he \"couldn’t get that last lap I wanted. We got off-balance a little bit at the end. Martin was able to get it. We came up a little short.”\nKurt Busch, who qualified fourth, said he felt good about his car \"because we made three spring changes going into that qualifying run. Those are things we wanted to try for the race, and we ran out of practice time to do so. It's nice that it turned out positive and the pace in qualifying is fast, yes, but the race will be at nightfall whereas we practiced in the daytime. This speed should be right in the middle of what we just ran and what changes we made. I think we're cooking up the right batch (for the race).\"\nRace.\nFirst half.\nStart.\nUnder clear Kansas skies, Martin Truex Jr. led the field to the green flag at 7:48 p.m. After 15 laps, he pulled to a three-second lead over Matt Kenseth.

Jamie McMurray was black-flagged on lap 30 after NASCAR deemed his crew made \"unapproved adjustments\" to the body of the car during his pit stop. Matt McCall, McMurray's crew chief, said he thought NASCAR \"called us back in for body modification or something. The Jackman hit the door when he went for the tire, so I don’t know. It’s interesting to me how they enforce stuff.” By lap 40, Busch held a one-second lead over Kurt Busch. The second caution of the race flew on lap 56 for Matt DiBenedetto brushing the wall exiting turn 4. Truex exited pit road with the race lead.\nSecond quarter.\nThe race restarted on lap 61. Carl Edwards attempted to pit because of a flat tire on lap 82, but was carrying too much speed, overshot the entrance and had to limp back around.

The wheel was on crooked because of a jammed bracket behind the wheel. After the race, Truex said he \"couldn’t believe it. I went around Turns 1 and 2 and I was like ‘Wheel loose.’ I kept telling myself that maybe it's not me, maybe it's just shaking because it has tape on it or something stupid. It was loose and I knew it right away. Frustrating, but that's how it goes.” Kenseth pitted with 53 laps to go and handed the lead to Logano. He pitted with 52 laps to go and handed the lead to Brad Keselowski. He pitted with 50 laps to go and handed the lead to Tony Stewart. Kyle Busch passed entering turn 3 to retake the lead with 36 laps to go.\nFourth quarter.\nThe fifth caution of the race flew with 34 laps to go after Ricky Stenhouse Jr. rode the wall through turns 3 and 4. Jimmie Johnson was tagged for speeding on pit road and restart the race from the tail-end of the field.\nThe race restarted with 28 laps to go. The sixth caution of the race flew with 27 to go for a multi-car wreck in turn 3. Threading the needle between Keselowski and Kyle Larson, Hamlin got loose and spun out. Logano, with nowhere to go, t-boned the No. 11 car. Hamlin said afterwards that he \"and the No. 2 got loose at the same time, I don’t think there was any contact, but the No. 42 was real close to me on the outside. I was driving in really deep there to try and clear him. Didn’t get him cleared and I knew if I didn’t get him clear then I would’ve put myself in a bad spot. I was just going for it. We’ve got a win and it’s win or nothing with this type of format, so why not go in there and take a chance? Unfortunately, it didn’t work.” Logano said it looked from his point that \"the 2 got loose and then the 11 got loose. I was hoping the 11 would come down the hill and when you’re in the smoke you can’t see anything. I hit the wall, so I knew where that was and I just kept riding and riding and hoping the 11 would come down the hill because I couldn’t see and he stayed up there and I got him right in the door. It’s unfortunate…It’s just racing. Things happen sometimes.”\nThe race restarted with 19 laps to go. Busch held off a late charge by Harvick to score the victory.\nPost-race.\nDriver comments.\nBusch said afterwards that winning at Kansas was \"pretty big – man, there’s been a lot of rough days here at Kansas, that’s for sure. A lot of good ones too, but I just can’t say enough about this team and everyone on this M&amp;M’s Camry. This thing was awesome tonight. At the beginning and middle part of the race we weren’t great, but Adam Stevens (crew chief) and the guys, they just kept working on it.”\nFollowing his second-place finish, Harvick said his car towards the end \"got tight, I hit a big piece of debris down there about six or seven laps into the run. From that point on I just got really tight…We overhauled this thing this morning to try to get it close. They did a great job.”\nAfter finishing third, Kurt Busch said his team \"battled hard. I was trying to find all the different lines on the track to find speed. We did a lot of things good and to win you’ve got to be great. We are right there, we are knocking on the door, but thanks to Haas Automation, Monster Energy, Chevrolet, everybody at Stewart-Haas it’s a great second and third place finish. We always want to win and we have been doing really good with this Tony Gibson (crew chief) led team.”\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nFox Sports covered their sixth race at the Kansas Speedway. Mike Joy, three-time Kansas winner Jeff Gordon and Darrell Waltrip had the call in the booth for the race. Jamie Little, Vince Welch and Matt Yocum handled the action on pit road for the television side.\nRadio.\nMRN had the radio call for the race which will also be simulcasted on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio.

        "text": "The Megunticook Golf Club is a private recreational club at 212 Calderwood Lane in Rockport, Maine. Its principal features are a Craftsman-style clubhouse and a nine-hole golf course, designed in 1912 by Warren H. Manning. The club was organized in 1899, and is one of the state's oldest recreational clubs, and is home to the state's oldest surviving private golf course. Its facilities were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 (misspelled \"Mequnticook\").\nDescription and history.\nThe Megunticook Golf Club is located on the east side of the Beachamp Point peninsula, which separates Rockport Harbor from Penobscot Bay. The property consists of undulating terrain, with views of the harbor and bay, particularly from the clubhouse, which is set on one of its high points. The clubhouse is a roughly rectangular single-story building with a broad wraparound porch, rubblestone foundation, and stained shingled exterior. Its interior includes a reading room, main club hall, and ladies' parlor. It is located near the center of the nine-hole golf course, which extends west beyond Beachamp Street.\nThe club was organized in 1899 and formally incorporated in 1901. The clubhouse was designed by Boston architect Charles Brigham, and opened in 1902, along with the golf course. Early design work on the golf course was done by George Ingraham, a local landscape contractor. The course's present configuration is largely influenced by additional design work performed in 1912 by Warren Manning and in 1915 by Albert Davis Taylor, who had worked with Manning until 1914."

        "text": "The 2006 Rafael Nadal tennis season started in February as Nadal missed the Australian Open because of a foot injury. Nadal won five singles titles in 2006.\nHard court.\nIn February, Nadal lost in the semifinals of the first tournament he played, the Open 13 tournament in Marseille, France. Two weeks later, he handed Roger Federer his first loss of the year in the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships (in 2006, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray were the only two men who defeated Federer), thus ending Federer’s 56-match winning streak on hard courts. To complete the spring hard-court season, Nadal was upset in both the semifinals of the Indian Wells Masters by James Blake, and in the second round of the Miami Masters by Carlos Moyá, who thus ended Nadal's 22-match win streak over fellow Spaniard players.\nClay season.\nOn European clay, Nadal won all four tournaments he entered and 24 consecutive matches. He defeated Federer in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters in four sets. The following week, he defeated Tommy Robredo in the final of the Open Sabadell Atlántico tournament in Barcelona. After a one-week break, Nadal won the Italian Masters, defeating Federer in a fifth-set tiebreaker in the final, after saving two match points and equaling Björn Borg's tally of 16 ATP titles won as a teenager. Nadal broke Argentinian Guillermo Vilas's 29-year male record of 53 consecutive clay-court match victories by beating Robin Söderling in the first round of the French Open.\nNadal went on to face Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals, the first-ever meeting of their historic rivalry, which Nadal won via a retirement from Djokovic after Nadal took the first two sets. He then beat Ivan Ljubičić to set up a final against Federer. The first two sets of the match were hardly competitive, as the rivals traded 6–1 sets. Nadal won the third set easily and served for the match in the fourth set before Federer broke him and forced a tiebreaker. Nadal won the tiebreaker and became the first player to defeat Federer in a Grand Slam tournament final.\nNadal injured his shoulder while playing a quarterfinal match against Lleyton Hewitt at the Artois Championships, played on grass at the Queen's Club in London. Nadal was unable to complete the match, which ended his 26-match winning streak.\nWimbledon.\nNadal was seeded second at Wimbledon, but was two points from defeat against American qualifier Robert Kendrick in the second round before coming back to win in five sets. In the third round, Nadal defeated world No. 20 Andre Agassi in straight sets in Agassi's last career match at Wimbledon. Nadal also won his next three matches in straight sets, which set up his first Wimbledon final, which was against Federer, who had won this tournament the three previous years. Nadal was the first Spanish man since Manuel Santana in 1966, to reach the Wimbledon final, but Federer won the match in four sets to win his fourth consecutive Wimbledon title.\nUS Open Series.\nDuring the lead up to the US Open, Nadal played the two Masters Series tournaments in North America. He was upset in the third round of the Rogers Cup in Toronto and in the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Masters by Juan Carlos Ferrero. Nadal was seeded second at the US Open, but lost in the quarterfinals to world No. 54 Mikhail Youzhny of Russia in four sets.\nNadal played only three tournaments for the remainder of the year. Joachim Johansson, ranked world No. 690, upset Nadal in the second round of the Stockholm Open. The following week, Nadal lost to Tomáš Berdych in the quarterfinals of the year's last Masters Series tournament, the Madrid Masters. During the round-robin stage of the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, Nadal lost to James Blake but defeated Nikolay Davydenko and Robredo. Because of those two victories, Nadal qualified for the semifinals, where he lost to Federer. This was Nadal's third loss in nine career matches with Federer.\nYear end ranking.\nNadal went on to become the first player since Andre Agassi in 1994–95 to finish the year as the world No. 2 in consecutive years."

        "title": "2005 Rafael Nadal tennis season",
        "text": "The 2005 Rafael Nadal tennis season is regarded as one of the greatest seasons of all time by a teenager. Nadal won a career-best 11 singles titles, including then-season-record 4 Masters 1000 titles and his maiden Grand Slam title at the French Open on his first attempt, making him the first teenager since Pete Sampras (1990 US Open) to win a major. He finished the year with 79 calendar match wins, the most by any teenager in ATP Tour history, and the world No. 2 ranking. He was awarded the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year award.\nAustralian Open.\nAt the 2005 Australian Open, Nadal lost in the fourth round to eventual runner-up Lleyton Hewitt.\nHard court.\nNadal reached the final of the 2005 Miami Masters, and despite being two points from a straight-sets victory, he was defeated in five sets by Roger Federer.\nClay court.\nNadal dominated the 2005 clay court season. He won 24 consecutive singles matches, which broke Andre Agassi's Open Era record of consecutive match wins for a male teenager. Nadal won the Torneo Conde de Godó in Barcelona and beat 2004 French Open runner-up Guillermo Coria in the finals of the 2005 Monte Carlo Masters and the 2005 Rome Masters. During the Rome quarterfinals against Radek Štěpánek, Nadal hit what is considered by many as the greatest shot of his career, a no-look, running passing shot near the net. These victories raised his ranking to world No. 5 and made him one of the favorites at his career-first French Open. On his 19th birthday, Nadal defeated Federer in the 2005 French Open semifinals, as one of only four players who defeated the world No. 1 that year (along with Marat Safin, Richard Gasquet, and David Nalbandian). Two days later, he defeated Mariano Puerta in the final, becoming the second male player after Mats Wilander to win the French Open on his first attempt. He also became the first male teenager to win a Grand Slam singles title since Pete Sampras won the 1990 US Open at age 19. Winning the French Open improved Nadal's ranking to world No. 3.\nGrass court.\nThree days after his victory in Paris, Nadal's 24-match winning streak was snapped in the first round of the grass court Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany, where he lost to the German Alexander Waske. He then lost in the second round of 2005 Wimbledon to Gilles Müller of Luxembourg.\nSummer hard court.\nImmediately after Wimbledon, Nadal won 16 consecutive matches and three consecutive tournaments, bringing his ranking to world No. 2 on 25 July 2005. Nadal started his North American summer hard-court season by defeating Agassi in the final of the 2005 Canada Masters, but lost in the first round of the 2005 Cincinnati Masters. Nadal was seeded second at the 2005 US Open, where he was upset in the third round by world No. 49 James Blake in four sets.\nIn September, he defeated Coria in the final of the China Open in Beijing and won both of his Davis Cup matches against Italy. In October, he won his fourth ATP Masters Series title of the year, defeating Ivan Ljubičić in the final of the 2005 Madrid Masters. He then suffered a foot injury that prevented him from competing in the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup.\nBoth Nadal and Federer won eleven singles titles and four ATP Masters Series titles in 2005. Nadal broke Mats Wilander's previous teenage record of nine in 1983. Eight of Nadal's titles were on clay, and the remainder were on hard courts. Nadal won 79 matches, second only to Federer's 81."

Extra base hits are often not listed separately in tables of baseball statistics, but are easily determined by calculating the total of a batter's doubles, triples, and home runs.\nHank Aaron is the all-time leader with 1,477 career extra base hits. Barry Bonds (1,440) and Albert Pujols (1,405) are the other players with more than 1,400 career extra base hits. Only 39 players all-time have reached 1,000 career extra-base hits."

The album was recorded at Headroom Studios in Philadelphia.[8] The album is split in half between both guitarist/frontmen, Jake Ewald and Bren Lukens (Ewald wrote the first six songs and Lukens wrote the last five).][10] Ewald's songs mainly revolved around the passing of his grandfather while Lukens focuses on their struggles with mental illness and depression.[11]\nRelease and promotion.\nOn February 24, 2016, the album was officially confirmed. On March 3, two songs were published online for free via NPR. The first, \"Everyday\", was written by Jake Ewald and the second, \"Apple Cider, I Don't Mind\", was written by Bren Lukens.[12] On April 4, the band released a documentary directed by actor and director Kyle Thrash entitled \"Tripping in the Dark\".[11] The documentary focused mainly on the formation of the band and the making of the album, including Ewald's struggle with his grandfather's death and Lukens' near suicide attempt and subsequent recovery. The video for \"Wedding Singer\" was released on May 5.[13]\nThe album's Vinyl release is unique in that the sides are titled \"Side J\" and \"Side B\" named after Jake Ewald having written the songs on side A and Bren Lukens having written the songs on side B. Additionally the Vinyl release includes an undocumented hidden track on side B of the vinyl release. This track is not found on any other release. \nModern Baseball announced plans to tour on March 3, 2016, setting the first dates for shortly after the release of the new album. The tour kicked off on May 25, 2016, with Joyce Manor and Thin Lips opening. On August 3, Modern Baseball announced they would be supporting Brand New and The Front Bottoms on tour starting in October 2016. At the conclusion of the Brand New tour, Modern Baseball will be playing a string of shows internationally.\nCritical reception.\nThe album was met with universal acclaim reviews, most of them noting that Modern Baseball showed growth and maturity with the content of \"Holy Ghost\". \"Holy Ghost\" holds a score of 81/100 on Metacritic indicating universal acclaim. On June 4, 2016, Holy Ghost reached No. 53 on the US \"Billboard\" 200."

        "text": "Antonio Rangel Ojeda (27 October 1943 – 22 December 2004) was a Mexican Badminton player that competed in the different categories of singles, doubles and mixed doubles, both nationally and internationally.\nHis father, Dr Raúl Rangel Romero was a dentist who taught his two children about the importance and benefits of practising sports, while his mother Luz Ojeda Lacroix was a school teacher. Antonio started to play badminton when he was about ten years old, together with his older brother Raúl, at the Centro Deportivo Chapultepec AC.\nIn 1965, Antonio Rangel extended to three games his match against Erland Kops in the third round of the US Open; in that year, the Danish player - then ranked as the number one of the World - had been beaten by his opponents in only two games.\nIn 1968, Antonio Rangel graduated from the School of Medicine of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and, one year later, 13 December 1969, he married Flor Lujan; they had four children: Antonio, Flor, David and Jorge.\nSince Antonio Rangel got married, he concentrated all his energy to his family and his professional career and he practically retired from the badminton competitions.\nSports career.\nIn 1958, when he was just 14 years old, Antonio Rangel became the national champion of Mexico for the first time, competing in the doubles category, together with his brother Raul Rangel. By 1967, he had already won 23 Mexican National Championships. In 1966, he won two more titles in the Mexican Open of Badminton as a singles player and in the doubles category, teaming up with his brother Raul Rangel.\nMexican National Open.\nThe Mexico City International Tournament was held in the years 1949, 1952, 1958, 1959 and 1961. Since 1964, this competition became known as the National Mexican Open.\nAntonio Rangel competed in the Mexican National Open from 1964 to 1968 where he played against players such as Erland Kops, Channarong Ratanaseangsuang, Jamie Paulson, Don Paup and Bill Berry, among others.\nThe Gentleman of the Badminton (visit to Peru).\nIn October 1965, Antonio Rangel visited Peru to participate in the 1st International Tournament of Peru by invitation of the Peruvian Federation of Badminton (Federación Peruana de Bádminton) who was interested in promoting the badminton in that country. Antonio Rangel won the men's singles event after defeating the Peruvian Champion Miguel Argüelles 15-2 and 15-9, and Ismael Seminario 15-11 and 15-5. However, playing together with the Danish player Knud Christiansen, Antonio Rangel lost the men's doubles final 15-5 and 15-11 against the Peruvian couple integrated by Percy Levi and Miguel Argüelles.\nWhen the competition was finished, Antonio Rangel prolonged his stay in Peru, accepting an invitation from the Peruvian Federation of Badminton, who wanted to promote further the badminton in Peru by organising some exhibition games in the Naval Centre of Peru (el Centro Naval del Perú), the Pacific Expo (la Feria del Pacífico) and some sporting precincts such as the \"Club Regatas\" of Lima and the \"Club Lawn Tennis de la Exposición\". For his involvement, the then Mayor of Lima, Dr Luis Bedoya Reyes, gave Antonio Rangel a plate for his first place in the 1st International Tournament of Peru with an inscription: \"Ambassador of Badminton\". Also, the Naval Centre of Peru gave him an award for his collaboration in fomenting the badminton among the youth in Peru. Finally, the President of the Peruvian Federation of Badminton, Don Alfredo Salazar, expressed their gratitude to Antonio Rangel with the following words:\n\"Aparte de su juego, Rangel nos ha impresionado con su caballerosidad y corrección que hacen que sea un gran embajador de ese pueblo tan querido\".\nTranslation: \"Besides his performance as a badminton player, Rangel has also impressed us with his gentleness and kindness that make him a great ambassador of that nation (Mexico) so beloved by us (Peru)\".\nSince his travel to Peru, Antonio Rangel was also referred to as the \"gentleman of the badminton\".\nThomas Cup.\nAntonio Rangel was part of the first Mexican team that competed in the Thomas Cup (American zone) and that was defeated by Japan in February 1964 (0-9). In February 1967, he competed for the second time with the Mexican team that was eliminated by Canada in the semi-finals of the zone; Antonio Rangel lost against the Canadian champion, Wayne Macdonnell: 12-15, 15-6 y 15-8. In men's doubles, he played together with Oscar Luján, against the brothers Ed and Rolf Paterson and lost: 15-5 y 15-6. In 1970, Antonio Rangel participated in the Thomas Cup for the last time as member of the team that was coached by the former Indonesian player Tan Joe Hok (winner of the All England in 1959), this time Mexico lost against the United States (2-7), in San Diego, California."

And so as the confederation with the most slots, one UEFA spot was transferred over to CONCACAF to ensure that two nations would still have the opportunity to qualify from North America.\nThe format of the tournament was a round-robin group stage followed by the top ranking nations competing in a second round-robin group stage.

The race was broadcast in the United States on the NBC television network. The second largest attendance of 167,227 was on hand for the event.\nQualification.\nThe Kentucky Derby is a race for 3-year-old Thoroughbred horses. The 2016 field was determined by the Road to the Kentucky Derby points system that was first introduced in 2013.\nField.\nThe Post Position Draw of the entries for the Kentucky Derby was held Wednesday, May 4, 2016, at the Churchill Downs Racetrack clubhouse. After the draw was made, the undefeated Nyquist was installed as the 3–1 morning line favorite. In spite of having been undefeated in his seven previous races and having already defeated several of the other entries, including second-favorite Exaggerator, Nyquist was viewed as vulnerable, in part because of the statistical improbability of the race favorite winning for four years in a row. Pundits also noted the unusual number of gray horses in the field, four in total and three of them sons of Tapit, a gray stallion who is ranked as the leading sire in America.\nRace description.\nAt the start, Danzing Candy quickly took the lead and held onto it for until fading. The favorite, Nyquist, broke well and stayed close to the leaders, no farther back than third throughout the race. At the top of the stretch, Gun Runner, who had been running second or third throughout, briefly took the lead but was quickly surpassed by Nyquist. Exaggerator, who had started well back in 15th place, closed fast at the end. Nyquist held him off to win the race by lengths. Nyquist was the eighth undefeated winner in Kentucky Derby history, the first since Big Brown in 2008. The last horse to have been undefeated in seven races prior to winning the Derby was Majestic Prince in 1969.\nResults.\nTimes: mile – 0:22.58; mile – 0:45.72; mile – 1:10.40; mile – 1:36.51; final – 2:01.31.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (:22.58) (:23.14) (:24.68) (:25.21) (:25.70)\nSource: Equibase chart\nPayout.\nThe Kentucky Derby Payout Schedule\nSubsequent Grade I wins.\nAlthough Nyquist never won another race, several other horses from the Derby went on to win at the Grade I level:"

Since 1878 it has been contested by state representative senior heavyweight men's eights at the annual Australian Interstate Regatta. Since 1973 the Australian Interstate Regatta has been conducted on the final day of the week-long annual Australian Rowing Championships. The King's Cup is the final event of the Australian Championships and the Interstate Regatta.\nEarly history.\nVictoria and New South Wales commenced inter-colonial racing in eight-oared boats in 1878 when the Victorian Rowing Association invited New South Wales oarsmen from the Sydney and the Mercantile clubs to boat crews for a race on the lower Yarra River over about four miles. Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania all showed an interest in entering crews from the mid-1880s but disagreements over definitions of amateur status resulted in inconsistencies in eligibility criteria in the early decades. New South Wales held firm to a view that not just professional sportsmen and those employed around boats would be deemed non-amateurs but also all manual labourers. The other states had relaxed this view by 1899. Queensland and Tasmania first entered crews in 1885 and then Queensland raced regularly from 1890. From 1899 South Australia were racing annually. Following Federation the race became the interstate eight-oared championship with Tasmania and West Australia boating crews regularly by 1906.\nThe Trophy.\nSince 1921 the crews have competed for the King's Cup. The trophy had been won by a First Australian Imperial Force crew at the Royal Peace Regatta held in London in 1919 following the cessation of hostilities at the end of World War I and was presented to the victorious eight-oared boat by King George V. In time, and in spite of dogged resistance from the Australian War Memorial, the Victorian Rowing Association petitioned the King to express his intention for the Cup, and at his command it became the perennial trophy to be presented to the winning state representative men's eight at the annual Australian Rowing Championships. \nThe AIF #1 crew, all former club oarsmen who secured the King's Cup for Australia were seated as follows: Bow - Sgt. Archie A Robb (Derwent Rowing Club, Tasmania); 2 - Lieut. Fred A House (Derwent Rowing Club, Tasmania); 3 - Lieut. Thomas McGill (Leichhardt Rowing Club, NSW); 4 - Gnnr. Arthur Scott (Murray Bridge Rowing Club, SA); 5 - Lieut. Henry Hauenstein (Leichhardt Rowing Club, NSW); 6 - Maj. Sydney Middleton (Sydney Rowing Club, NSW); 7 - Gnnr.

        "text": "A Carolingian-era equestrian statuette in bronze depicting either Charlemagne or his grandson Charles the Bald, a rare example of surviving Carolingian sculpture in metal, is exhibited in the Louvre Museum. In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries it was kept in Metz Cathedral. \nThe statuette consists of three parts: the horse, the rider's body with the saddle, and the rider's head. It has a total height of 24 cm.\nThe rider is depicted with a moustache, an open crown on his head, a sword in his right hand (lost), an imperial orb in his left hand, and a riding cloak fastened with a fibula. It was most likely made around 870, i.e. during the reign of Charles the Bald. Carolingian metalwork continues the Gallo-Roman tradition of casting and takes as its templates the equestrian bronzes of the Roman imperial period, such as the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius or the Regisole of Pavia.\nThe features of the rider agree with depictions on Charlemagne on coins as well as with the description by Einhard in his \"Vita Karoli Magni\", and the statuette is usually referred to as the \"statuette of Charlemagne\", but it is possible that the statuette may in fact depict Charlemagne's grandson, Charles the Bald. If so, his depiction in the likeness of his grandfather would have been intentional.\nClemens (1890) argued for the statuette's Carolingian age, against Wolfram (1890), and he agreed with Aus'm Weerth (1885) on the point that it is impossible to judge whether it depicts Charlemagne or Charles the Bald. Scholarship of the late 20th century appears more inclined to opt for depiction of Charles the Bald, based on the circumstantial evidence that the work most likely dates to his reign and was kept at Metz Cathedral, suggesting that it may have been commissioned in 869 on the occasion of Charles the Bald's coronation as King of Lotharingia there.\nThe inventories of Metz cathedral from the 16th century on list two statuettes of Charlemagne; one of gilded silver, made by the Metz silversmith François in 1507, and the other of bronze or \"gilded copper\", first inventorized in 1567. Both statuettes re-appear in inventories of the 16th century. In 1807, the bronze statuette was acquired by Alexandre Lenoir, founder of the Musée des Monuments Français, in 1807. After Lenoir's death in 1839, his heirs sold it to the private collector Madame Evans-Lombe, who exhibited it at the \"Exposition Universelle\" of 1855, after which she sold it to the city of Paris for 5,000 francs. It was kept in the Carnavalet Museum for some time, and it was transferred to the Louvre in 1934 (accession number OA 8260)."

The teams who finished in the top two in either of the divisions received byes to the second round while the remaining eight teams were placed in the first round. Each team was initially matched up with a team from the other division (3rd versus 6th and 4th versus 5th)."

Bob Kurland was named the NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player for his efforts throughout the tournament, an honor which he won in the previous year's tournament.\nBackground.\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels.\nThe North Carolina Tar Heels, or White Phantoms, entered the season being coached by Ben Carnevale.\nOklahoma A&amp;M Aggies.\nCoach Henry Iba and the Oklahoma A&amp;M Aggies won the national championship game the previous season, where they defeated New York University by four points to claim the national title. The team returned most of the roster from the year before and the team was expected to be successful as the prior year. Sam Aubrey, a player who enlisted in 1943 and was deployed in World War II, returned to the team. Aubrey had sustained an injury during combat, but after intense rehab, he returned to the level of play he had been at before he left and was placed in the starting line up. The Aggies finished the regular season with a 28-2 record and won the Missouri Valley Conference. All five starters for the Aggies were named first team all-conference.\nMedia coverage.\nThe media believed that the Aggies' chances of winning depended on the play of Bob Kurland, the nation's leading scorer. An Associated Press writer believed that if Kurland played like he had in the past eleven games, then the Aggies would be the first team to repeat as NCAA champions. Sportswriters believed that if McKinney – who was assigned to guard Kurland – could play well enough defense and Dillon make enough shots, the Tar Heels would have a chance at winning.\nBroadcast.\nThis was the first NCAA Tournament to have a game televised. The game was broadcast across only the greater New York area and reached close to 500,000 people.\nBox score.\nSource:"

        "text": "Farmers Cricket Club Ground is a cricket ground in Saint Martin, Jersey. It was opened in 2005 by Geoffrey Boycott and Mike Gatting and has hosted ICC World Cricket League matches. The ground is the home of the Farmers Cricket Club and the Jersey national cricket team.\nHistory.\nThe Farmers Cricket Club Ground was built after Jersey farmer Jim Perchard decided to turn his potato farm into a cricket field. Work on the ground started in 2003, and took 18 months. The ground was opened in 2005 by former England cricketers Geoffrey Boycott and Mike Gatting, and its first recorded international match was in July 2007 between Belgium Under-19s and France Under-19s. The ground hosted five matches during the 2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Five, including one Jersey match against Botswana, which Jersey won by 7 wickets. In 2009, the Farmers Cricket Club Ground hosted a match between Guerney Under-19s and Ireland under-19s, as part of the 2009 European Under-19 Championships. Ireland scored 281, in an innings where Andrew Balbirnie top-scored for the Irish with 83 and 55 extras were conceded. In reply, Guernsey were bowled out for 49. \nIn 2013, the ground hosted four matches in the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Six. In May 2014, the ground hosted a 50-over and a 20-over match between Jersey and the Marylebone Cricket Club; Jersey won the 50-over match by 7 wickets, and the 20-over match by 2 wickets on the final ball of the match. After the death of Phillip Hughes, Farmers Cricket Club groundsman Jimmy Perchard organised a row of bats outside the ground, and changed the ground's scorecard to 63*.\nBetween 21 and 28 May 2016, the Farmers Cricket Club Ground was one of three grounds that hosted the 2016 ICC World Cricket League Division Five in Jersey; the other two were Grainville Cricket Ground and FB Playing Fields. The Farmers Ground hosted five matches.\nIn 2019, Farmers Cricket Club Ground was voted into the top ten club cricket grounds in United Kingdoms, after international cricket agency CricX asked its followers to send the picture of their favourite pitches."

It was the 43rd staging of the Masters and the second Triple Crown event of the 2016/17 snooker season, following the 2016 UK Championship and preceding the 2017 World Snooker Championship.\nRonnie O'Sullivan was the defending champion, having defeated Barry Hawkins 10–1 in the final of the 2016 event. O'Sullivan reached a record-extending 12th Masters final and successfully defended his title, defeating Joe Perry 10–7 to win the tournament for a record seventh time, surpassing the six titles won by Stephen Hendry. This was the first successful title defence at the Masters since Paul Hunter in 2002. Marco Fu compiled the highest of the tournament, scoring a 141 in his semi-final match against O'Sullivan.\nPrize fund.\nThe event saw identical prize money to that of the previous year's event, with a total of £600,000 total prize pool. The \"rolling 147 prize\" for a maximum break stood at £10,000, but went unclaimed. The breakdown of prize money is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nThe 2017 Masters tournament was an invitational non-ranking event held at Alexandra Palace from 15 to 22 January 2017, and saw the 16 highest ranked players in the snooker world rankings compete, with no qualification round. As defending champion, Ronnie O'Sullivan was awarded number one seed with World Champion Mark Selby seeded second. The remaining places allocated to players were based on the world rankings after the 2016 UK Championship. The event was the second Triple Crown event of the 2016/17 snooker season following the UK Championship and the 43rd staging of the Masters. The event was sponsored by sports betting company dafabet, who had sponsored the event since 2014.\nRanked 21st, Stephen Maguire failed to secure entry to the tournament for the first time since 2004. Maguire later qualified to play in the 2019 event. The event saw one debutant, Kyren Wilson who was seeded 16th. All matches, excluding the final were played as best-of-11-frames, whereas the final was played as a best-of-19-frames match played over two sessions.\nFirst round.\nThe first round of the competition was played from 15 to 18 January 2017. Defending champion O'Sullivan drew Liang Wenbo (seeded 12) in the first round. Wenbo had made his debut in the competition the previous year, losing 4–6 to John Higgins in the first round. This time he fought back from 2–4 behind, to lead 5–4, and required the final in frame 10 to win the match, but he missed the shot, allowing O'Sullivan to tie 5–5. O'Sullivan then made a of 121 in the deciding frame to win the match. Afterwards, O'Sullivan claimed that he felt ill during the match, and had been looking forward to \"a nice week off\".\nThe 2012 Masters champion Neil Robertson (8) played Ali Carter (13), with the winner to face O'Sullivan in the quarter-finals. In a low-scoring match, Robertson took a 4–1 lead, before Carter claimed the next two frames to reduce his deficit to 4–3. Robertson took the next two frames, scoring a break of 117 in the ninth, to win the match 6–3.&lt;ref name=\"Fu/Trump\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fifth seed Judd Trump played 2011 runner-up Marco Fu (14). Trump took leads of 3–0 and 4–2 over Fu, and later led 5–4, but Fu took the last two frames to claim the victory. The match, which saw fourteen 50+ breaks, was described by 1991 World champion and snooker pundit John Parrott as \"an absolutely wonderful spectacle\"; he also commented that 39-year-old Fu was \"playing the best snooker of his career\".\nTwo-time champion John Higgins (4) played Mark Allen (10), with the victor meeting Fu in the second-round. Higgins, who last won the title in 2006, had been eliminated in the first round on twelve occasions prior to this year's tournament.&lt;ref name=\"Higgins/Allen\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He took the first two frames of the match, including a break of 111, but the score later tied at 4–4 with Allen securing a break of 104. In the ninth frame, Allen lost a 67-point advantage by missing a blue into the middle pocket, allowing Higgins to build a break of 67 thus forcing a . Allen potted the black from a long-range shot to take a 5–4 lead, but a 77 break from Higgins in the next frame drew them level at five all. Both players missed shots in the final frame, until Allen compiled a break of 44 to eventually win the match 6–5.\nWorld number two Stuart Bingham (3) met Joe Perry (9) in the fifth of the first round matches. Despite being the lower seed, Perry inflicted a 6–1 defeat on Bingham, who had become a father for the second time two days before the match.&lt;ref name=\"Perry/Bingham\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Perry won the first frame of the match, before clinching the second on a respotted black. Bingham made a 132 break in the third, to win his only frame of the match, before Perry took the next four frames for the victory. Ding Junhui (6) was drawn against Kyren Wilson (16), who was making his debut appearance at the Masters. Since winning the 2011 title, Ding had failed to progress beyond the first round in the five intervening Masters tournaments. He defeated Wilson 6–3, to set up his first Masters quarter-final match in six years, which would be against Perry in the next round.\nFormer Masters champion, Shaun Murphy (7) drew Barry Hawkins (11) in the first round. Hawkins \"thrashed\" Murphy 6–1, according to the BBC. In the last of the first round matches, reigning UK and world champion Mark Selby (2) drew two-time Masters winner Mark Williams (15). Prior to the tournament, Selby had commented on the prospect of holding all three Triple Crown titles simultaneously, a feat that has only been achieved on four previous occasions.&lt;ref name=\"Hawkins/Selby\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He took a lead of 3–1, before Williams later tied the match at 3–3; the two players shared the next four frames to level the score again at 5–5, leading to a final-frame decider. Despite gaining an advantage in the last frame, Williams experienced a on the blue ball, allowing Selby to make an 89 clearance to win the match 6–5.&lt;ref name=\"Williams/Selby\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pundit John Parrott later expressed sympathy for Williams, and commented that a kick \"is a horrible way to lose\" a match.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals of the competition, played on 19 and 20 January 2017, saw the remaining eight players compete in best of 11 frame matches. In the first quarter-final, Ronnie O'Sullivan defeated Neil Robertson 6–3. Robertson won the first frame with a break of 74, before O'Sullivan took frames 2 and 3 with two 50+ breaks, later moving into a 4–3 lead.&lt;ref name=\"OSullivan/Robertson\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He a red ball in frame eight and clinched the frame; he then secured the win with a 68 break in frame nine. Despite winning, O'Sullivan commented that he had not played well, and accused himself of \"missing too many easy balls\".\nMarco Fu defeated Mark Allen 6–2, to set up a semi-final encounter with O'Sullivan in the next round. Fu took a 3–0 lead, with breaks of 83 and 74. Allen won frames four and five with two more 50+ breaks, but Fu took the next three frames to win the match. He made a 140 break in the winning frame, which was the highest break of the tournament up to that point. In the third quarter-final, Joe Perry defeated former champion Ding Junhui 6–1, after making a 127 break in frame seven. The BBC described the result as a \"shock win\".\nBarry Hawkins defeated Mark Selby 6–3 in the last quarter-final. Hawkins took an early 3–1 lead, and then led 4–2, before Selby scored a break of 101 to reduce his deficit to one frame, at 4–3. Hawkins, however, took both frames eight and nine to win the match. He commented afterwards that his first round victory over Shaun Murphy had given him the confidence to win his quarter-final, and defeat the world number one.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals took place on 21 January 2017. The first semi-final saw Ronnie O'Sullivan reach a record 12th Masters final by defeating Marco Fu 6–4. The two players shared the first two frames, before Fu made a break of 110 in frame three. O'Sullivan's cue tip was damaged during this third frame, so the match headed into an early mid-session interval (usually held after the fourth frame) to allow him to replace the tip. With his cue repaired, O'Sullivan made a break of 95 in the next frame to tie the match at 2–2. In the fifth frame of the match, Fu compiled the tournament's highest break, a 141, to take a 3–2 lead. O'Sullivan won frame six with a break of 122 for a 3–3 tie, and the pair remained tied after the next two frames, at 4–4. O'Sullivan won frames nine and ten to win the match and secure his place in the final.\nAfter his victory, O'Sullivan referred to the match as \"probably the best match [he had] won\", while Fu commented that it was \"a joy to be involved in a match like this.\" BBC Sport pundit, and six-time world champion Steve Davis called it a \"magnificent performance\", and commented that Fu's performance was \"fantastic\".\nThe second semi-final saw Joe Perry reach his first Triple Crown tournament final by defeating Barry Hawkins 6–5. Perry led the match at 2–1, but then lost four frames in a row to trail 2–5. Going into frame eight, Perry hit a from the shot, allowing Hawkins to gain a lead in the frame, eventually scoring 64 points. At 64–20 in the frame and with 43 points remaining, Perry required a to avoid losing the match. He potted a red and black, and played the snooker on the last red; Hawkins missed the shot, and left a . After potting a brown as his free ball, Perry cleared the table to win the frame, now trailing 3–5. He then also won frames nine and ten with two 50+ breaks, to level the match at 5–5, thus forcing a deciding frame. Hawkins made a break of 50 in the final frame, but ran out of position and attempted a to continue the break, which he missed. Perry then made a break of 70 to win the match.\nBy winning the semi-final, Perry booked a place in the first major championship final of his career, having previously won only one ranking event, the 2015 Players Tour Championship Grand Final. He called the match the \"best win of [his] career\", while Hawkins said that he was \"devastated\" by the result.\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 22 January 2017, as a best of 19 frames match, and was spread over an afternoon session and an evening session. Joe Perry was making his debut in a Triple Crown event final, whilst O'Sullivan had won the event on six previous occasions. Perry won the first two frames of the final, and later took a 4–1 lead, scoring four 50+ breaks, including a 115 break in frame five. In the next frame, he missed a shot on a relatively easy red ball that would have clinched the frame, but O'Sullivan won the frame to trail 4–2. He also took the remaining two frames of the session to tie the match 4–4.\nIn the evening, O'Sullivan took a commanding lead, winning the first four frames of the session (thus winning seven frames in a row overall) to lead 4–8, thanks to three 50+ breaks. With O'Sullivan two frames away from the championship, Perry won the next two frames with breaks of 117 and 92, to trail 6–8. Frame 15 gave O'Sullivan a 6–9 lead, with a break of 112, taking him one frame from victory. Perry won the next frame, but O'Sullivan took frame 17 to win the match, and his seventh Masters championship title.\nAfter winning the tournament, O'Sullivan praised Perry, saying: \"Joe played a brilliant tournament, a really good match and he should've beaten me. I got lucky – I stole it.\" O'Sullivan also broke the record for most Masters wins, previously tied (at six) with Stephen Hendry. O'Sullivan commented, \"It is great to get some records, I still have the World Championship one to get\", referring to Hendry's superior seven world championship titles.\nIn winning the event, O'Sullivan was presented with the \"Paul Hunter Trophy\", named after three-time winner Paul Hunter who died of cancer in 2006. World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn commented that they had \"made a mistake\" in not naming the trophy after Hunter previously, despite the German Open having been renamed to the Paul Hunter Classic in 2007.\nTournament draw.\nThe full match results are shown below.

It determined the national champion for the 1989–90 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, and was contested by the East Regional Champions, No. 3-seeded Duke Blue Devils of the ACC and the West Regional Champions, No. 1-seeded UNLV Runnin' Rebels of the Big West. Both teams were seeking their first national title. The game was played on April 2, 1990 at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado. This was the first of three consecutive championship game appearances for Duke.\nThe Runnin' Rebels defeated the Blue Devils, 103–73, to claim their first, and only, NCAA title. It was also the first title for head coach Jerry Tarkanian. UNLV guard Anderson Hunt was named the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player (MOP).\nThe 30-point margin of victory remains the largest in championship game history.\nParticipating teams.\nThis was the first national championship game between the two schools. Duke was playing in the Final Four for the fourth time in five seasons, and was playing in the championship game for the fourth time (1964, 1978, 1986). UNLV was playing in the championship game for the first time.\nGame summary.\nDuke won the jump ball to begin the game and Phil Henderson put up a three-point shot attempt that hit off iron and was rebounded by Stacey Augmon. After the teams traded turnovers, Greg Anthony opened the scoring with a 17-foot jumper from the top of the key. After a low-post bucket by Larry Johnson put the Rebels up 4–0, Duke got on the board with a pair of free throws by Alaa Abdelnaby. UNLV maintained a slight lead for the next few possessions. Around the 17-minute mark, Duke's Robert Brickey scored inside and was fouled for a chance to tie the game at 7 with a free throw. Brickey missed the foul shot and that is as close as the Blue Devils would get for the remainder of the ballgame. UNLV led 11–6 at the under 16 media timeout. Augmon forced Duke's 7th turnover of the half and took it in for the dunk to give UNLV its first double-digit lead at 21-11 at the under 12 timeout. After reserve Barry Young hit a three-point shot to put UNLV up 30–17, analyst Billy Packer said, Jerry Tarkanian's towel is under is seat. He's gotta be comfortable right now, eluding to significant contributions from the Runnin' Rebels bench players. After a three-point play from Larry Johnson and an alley-oop pass from half court from point guard Anthony to Augmon, UNLV's lead ballooned to 16 at 41-25. Duke would shave a few points off the deficit in the final minutes to make the halftime score 47-35, UNLV. At the break, the Runnin' Rebels held a 17-4 advantage in fast break points.\nDuke opened the second half with possession, but failed to score. UNLV drew a third personal foul from Duke's Christian Laettner on the following possession one that eventually ended with a three-pointer from Larry Johnson and a 5035 lead. Duke trimmed the lead to 10 with 16:24 remaining, but an Anderson Hunt jumper made the score 59-47 at the under 16 media timeout. The Rebels continued to push the pace as a bucket from Johnson, a three-pointer from Hunt, and a transition layup from Hunt made it 6647 with 14:49 to go. In between two Duke timeouts, UNLV's devastating run was extended to 180, and a 7547 lead, before Duke's next points. At this point, the Rebels had a 336 advantage on the fast break. Johnson, a consensus All-American, ended with 22 points and 11 rebounds, and Tournament MOP Hunt compiled 29 points on 12-16 shooting. UNLV shattered UCLA's championship game margin record from 1968 (23 points) in coasting to the 10373 victory.\nMedia coverage.\nThe championship game was televised in the United States by CBS. Brent Musburger provided play-by-play, while Billy Packer provided color commentary. This was Musburger's last NCAA men's basketball championship broadcast, as he had been fired the previous day by CBS (Musburger would eventually be hired by ABC later in 1990).\nAftermath.\nAfter UNLV won the national championship, the team was hit with NCAA sanctions and a postseason ban. However, UNLV’s postseason ban was pushed over to the 1992 season, giving the team a chance to defend their title. The Rebels returned to the Final Four the next year with an undefeated 34-0 record and were once again matched up against Duke for the right to advance to the championship game. Duke proceeded to upset the heavily favored Rebels and advance to the title game.\nSince the loss to Duke in the 1991 Final Four, the Rebels would only return to the NCAA Tournament eight times, only advancing as far as the Sweet Sixteen in 2007.\nAfter defeating UNLV in the national semifinal, Duke went on to defeat Kansas for their first national title. They would return to the championship game for a third straight time in 1992, where they defeated Michigan to repeat as champions."

It determined the national champion for the 1988–89 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, and was contested by the Southeast Regional Champions, No. 3-seeded Michigan Wolverines of the Big Ten and the West Regional Champions, No. 3-seeded Seton Hall Pirates of the Big East. Both teams were seeking their first national title. The game was played on April 3, 1989, at the Kingdome in Seattle, Washington. \nMichigan defeated Seton Hall, 80–79 in OT, to claim their first national championship in basketball. It was also the first title for interim head coach Steve Fisher. Wolverine senior forward Glen Rice was named the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player (MOP) as he established the tournament scoring record with 184 points.\nGame summary.\nMichigan trailed by three, 79–76, with less than a minute remaining in overtime when Terry Mills hit a turnaround 11-footer to cut the Seton Hall lead to 79–78. After a defensive stop, the Pirates' Gerald Greene was controversially called for a foul on Rumeal Robinson with three seconds left in overtime. Robinson made both free throws, and, after Seton Hall's last-second shot came up short, Michigan won its first national championship.\nAftermath.\nWhile Michigan and Seton Hall experienced regular season and postseason success in the following years, 1989 marked a high point for both teams. To date, this remains the only championship won by the Wolverines, while this is the only appearance in the championship game for the Pirates. Since 1989, the closest Seton Hall got to another Final Four was the Elite Eight in 1991, where they lost to then-undefeated UNLV. Michigan would make four more appearances in the national championship game after this in 1992, 1993, 2013, and 2018, and the Wolverines would lose all four, bringing their record in the championship game to 1-6, the worst record among teams that have previously won a championship."

The race, which had no Triple Crown at stake (as Derby winner Nyquist lost in the Preakness), was broadcast by NBC beginning at 5:00 p.m. EDT, with pre-race coverage on NBCSN starting at 3:00 p.m. The race was won by Creator by a nose over Destin. 2016 Preakness Stakes winner Exaggerator finished eleventh.\nThe attendance for the event was 60,114.\nField.\nOnly four horses from the 2016 Preakness Stakes came to New York to contest the Belmont: Exaggerator, the Preakness winner; Cherry Wine, the runner-up; Stradivari, who had finished fourth; and Lani, who had finished fifth. Of these, only Exaggerator and Lani had also run in the Kentucky Derby, finishing second and ninth respectively. Nyquist, winner of the 2016 Kentucky Derby and third in the Preakness, missed the Belmont due to illness.\nThe field also included five horses from the 2016 Kentucky Derby who had not run in the Preakness: Suddenbreakingnews (5th in the Derby), Destin (6th), Brody's Cause (7th), Creator (13th), and Trojan Nation (16th).\nThe field was rounded out by four \"new shooters\" — horses who had not run in either of the two preceding Triple Crown races. These were Governor Malibu, Gettysburg, Seeking the Soul, and Forever d'Oro. Governor Malibu was the only stakes winner among these; the rest were long shots. Front-running Gettysburg was entered by his owner, WinStar Farm as a \"rabbit\", to ensure a decent early pace for their other entry, Creator. To ensure there was no conflict of interest, WinStar also switched Gettysburg's trainer from Todd Pletcher (who already had Destin and Stradivari in the Belmont) to Steve Asmussen, the trainer of Creator.\nThe field was drawn on 8 June and the Preakness Stakes winner Exaggerator was installed as the 9/5 morning line favorite with thirteen entries.\nRace.\nThe weather forecast predicted rain but it held off and the track was fast. As expected, Gettysburg went to the early lead, and set a moderate pace — slow compared to the fractions in shorter races, but relatively fast by the standards of the Belmont. Destin raced about a length behind Gettysburg for the first mile, then moved to the lead.\nMeanwhile, Creator had broken slowly and spent the first half mile at the back of the pack. Jockey Irad Ortiz Jr. then moved the colt up to sixth place down the backstretch, continuing to save ground on the rail. As they entered the stretch, Creator was full of run but had nowhere to go, surrounded by other horses. Ortiz waited patiently until a hole opened, then burst through, rapidly closing on Destin to win by a nose. It was just the fourth photo finish in Belmont Stakes history.\nLani closed from last to third to round out an all-gray trifecta. The favorite, Exaggerator, had been closer to the front than was normal for him, and raced wide, struggling with jockey Kent Desormeaux to go faster. When Desormeaux finally asked for his run, Exaggerator had no response. Desormeaux said, \"I nursed him to the quarter pole and set him down, put him down for a mad drive and said, 'Show me your stuff,' and there was nothing there.\" Exaggerator finished eleventh.\nIt was trainer Steve Asmussen's first Belmont Stakes win. \"Obviously we're very proud of the horse. ... I really thought the horse tried to win late. He really laid out there, dug in, and I personally feel fortunate for his effort\", said Asmussen.\n\"[Creator] was calm and I just waited for somewhere to go\", said Oritz. \"When he got clear, he started running. It's an amazing feeling.\" It was the first win in a Triple Crown race for the 23-year-old jockey.\nPayout.\nThe 148th Belmont Payout Schedule"

        "text": "The 2017 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2016–17 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors defeated the defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers four games to one. This Finals was the first time in NBA history the same two teams had met for a third consecutive year. The Cavaliers sought to repeat as champions after winning the championship in 2016, while the Warriors won their first meeting in 2015. For the third straight year, Golden State earned home court advantage against Cleveland with a league-best record of . The Warriors entered the 2017 Finals after becoming the first team in NBA playoff history to start , while the Cavaliers entered the 2017 Finals with a record during the first three rounds of the postseason. The Warriors' start in the playoffs is the most consecutive postseason wins in NBA history and their record is the best winning percentage () in NBA playoff history. Golden State's Kevin Durant was named the Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP). Durant won the Finals MVP award unanimously, receiving all 11 Finals MVP votes.\nBackground.\nGolden State Warriors.\nThis was the Golden State Warriors' third consecutive trip to the NBA Finals and ninth appearance overall, having come short of back-to-back titles in the 2016 NBA Finals by losing in seven games after having a 3–1 lead. With the acquisition of free agent Kevin Durant in the offseason, the Warriors were hailed as a \"Superteam\" by the media and fans, forming a new All-Star \"Big Four\" of Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.\nThe team equaled their 2014–15 regular-season record of 67–15, their second most wins in franchise history. They won the Pacific Division title and Western Conference Championship for the third consecutive season. The club became the fastest team in NBA history to clinch a playoff berth, achieving the feat on February 25, 2017, two days earlier than last season when they clinched on February 27, 2016. They also became the first team in NBA playoff history to start 12–0, sweeping the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference semifinals, and the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. Entering the Finals, this twelve game win-streak tied third for the most consecutive wins in the postseason. The Warriors also entered the Finals with the largest playoff points differential in NBA history, with a +16.3 winning margin per game.\nCleveland Cavaliers.\nThis was the Cleveland Cavaliers' third consecutive trip to the NBA Finals, and fourth appearance overall, seeking to repeat as NBA champions. This was also the seventh consecutive NBA Finals appearance for LeBron James, and the sixth for James Jones (who technically qualified for the 2011 NBA Finals along with James, but did not play).\nThe Cavaliers finished the 2016–17 regular season with a 51–31 record, securing the 2nd seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round, swept the Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference semifinals, and defeated the Boston Celtics in five games in the Eastern Conference Finals.\nRegular season series.\nThe Warriors and Cavaliers tied the regular season series 1–1, with each team winning its home game.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe Warriors routed the Cavaliers 113–91 to take a 1–0 series lead. The Warriors led by only 8 points at halftime, but they opened the third quarter on a 13–0 run and never looked back. Kevin Durant had 38 points to lead the Warriors, and Stephen Curry added 28 points. The Cavaliers' LeBron James also had 28 points, becoming the first player to score 6000 career points in the postseason. James also passed Reggie Miller for second all-time in postseason three-pointers made. He grabbed 15 rebounds and dished out 8 assists, but he committed 8 of the Cavaliers' 20 turnovers. Golden State as a team managed only half of James' total with 4 turnovers, equaling the NBA record for fewest turnovers in an NBA Finals game. With this win, the Warriors became the first team ever to start 13–0 in the playoffs and their current 13 game win-streak is tied for the most consecutive postseason wins in NBA history. Former Cavaliers head coach and current Warriors interim head coach Mike Brown took charge of the game, with Steve Kerr still being out due to illness.\nThe Cavaliers became the first team in NBA Finals history to fail to record a steal in a game. With the loss, the Cavaliers' nine game road playoff winning streak (a streak that began when they won Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals) came to an end. James dropped to 1–7 in NBA Finals openers in his career.\nGame 2.\nThe Warriors won Game 2 over the Cavaliers, 132–113, to improve their best start in NBA playoff history to 14–0. Their fourteen-game win-streak is the longest postseason win streak in NBA history. Golden State surpassed Cleveland's thirteen game win-streak, which dated back to Game 5 of the 2016 Finals. The Warriors also hit an NBA Finals record 18 three-pointers on 43 attempts, with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant hitting four threes apiece and Draymond Green connecting on a three of his own from behind the arc. Warriors Coach Steve Kerr returned from illness to coach from the sideline for the first time since April 19, 2017. In what was a high scoring affair for both teams, the Warriors held a slim three-point lead (67–64) at halftime and a four-point lead (86–82) past the midway point of the third quarter before outscoring the Cavs 35–17 through the middle of the fourth quarter. LeBron James led the Cavaliers with 29 points while grabbing 11 rebounds and dishing out 14 assists, and Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving added 27 and 19 points, respectively.\nFor the Warriors, Durant scored 33 points with 13 rebounds, while Curry had 32 points to go along with 10 rebounds and 11 assists. With his eighth triple-double of the Finals, James moved into a tie with Magic Johnson for the most Finals triple-doubles in the league. Game 2 was the first postseason game since 1970 where two opposing players each had a triple-double. Golden State took a 2–0 series lead heading into Cleveland for Game 3.\nGame 3.\nThe Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 118–113 to extend the longest winning streak in NBA playoff history to 15 games. Golden State became the first team in the four major sports leagues in North America to go 15–0 in the postseason. The Warriors got off to a blistering start, hitting an NBA Finals record 9 three-pointers in the first quarter, resulting in an early 39-32 lead. During the quarter, the Cavaliers got a scare when LeBron James bumped into his teammate Tristan Thompson trying to guard Klay Thompson, but James stayed in the game. The Warriors finished the first half with 12 made three-pointers, another NBA Finals record for most threes in a half, and led 67–61. However, the Cavaliers started to show some life to start the third quarter, going on a 10–2 run to lead 71–69. They led 94–89 after three quarters of play and 113–107 with 2:32 remaining in the fourth quarter, but the Warriors scored 11 unanswered points to steal the road win and take a commanding 3–0 series lead heading into Game 4. During the game-ending run, Kevin Durant drilled the go-ahead three-pointer for Golden State with 45.3 seconds remaining and Iguodala blocked LeBron James' potential game-tying 3.\nDurant led the Warriors with 31 points, going 4-for-7 from behind the arc that included the winning basket. Klay Thompson added 30 points on 6-of-11 shooting from three-point range, and Stephen Curry scored 26 points on 5-of-9 shooting from downtown to go along with 13 rebounds. For the Cavaliers, James had 39 points, falling one assist shy of a triple-double with 11 rebounds and 9 assists. Kyrie Irving added 38 points but struggled from beyond the arc, going 0-for-7. Despite stellar performances from both James and Irving, Cleveland finished the game a dismal 12-of-44 from three-point range, compared to the Warriors 16-of-33 performance on three point shots.\nGame 4.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers led wire-to-wire as they avoided a Finals sweep by Golden State to rout the Warriors 137–116, ending Golden State's NBA postseason record winning streak at 15 games to start the 2017 playoffs. The game was notable for shattering a number of NBA Finals records. The Cavs scored 49 points in the first quarter, the most points of any period in a Finals game, en route to scoring 86 points for the first half, which was the most points scored in a half. They also hit 13 three-pointers in the first half, which broke the Finals record for most threes in a half set last game by the Warriors. The Cavaliers finished the game with 24 three-pointers, which easily broke the Finals record for the most threes in a game set by the Warriors in Game 2. Both the Cavaliers and Warriors combined to score a total of 154 points in the first half, which is another Finals record for most points by any two teams in a half.\nLeBron James tallied his ninth triple-double of the Finals (31 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists), surpassing Magic Johnson for the most triple-doubles in a championship series. His highlight of the game came three minutes into the third quarter when he threw a pass off the backboard to himself, finishing with a powerful dunk. James also passed Michael Jordan for third all-time in points scored in the Finals. Kyrie Irving led all scorers with 40 points, breaking out of a shooting slump from behind the arc by going 7-for-12. Kevin Love added 23 points on 6-of-8 from downtown, and J. R. Smith had 15 points, all on 5-of-9 from three-point range, including a deep shot from 30 feet in the second quarter to beat the shot clock buzzer. Kevin Durant scored 35 points to lead the Warriors, but their other three superstars were held to under 20 points each as Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green managed 14, 13, and 16 points respectively. Cleveland trails the Finals, 3–1, as the series shifts back to Oakland. \nGame 4 was also notable for a number of testy incidents. As the teams prepared for a jump ball with 1:56 left in the first quarter, Green was called for a hard foul for throwing an elbow at Iman Shumpert. Green was trying to plead his case when Warriors head coach Steve Kerr simultaneously argued with the officials, who then called a technical foul on Kerr, although it was mistakenly recorded as a foul on Green. With 7:26 remaining in the third quarter, Love fouled Durant from behind on a layup attempt. Durant claimed he was hit hard in the forehead, and James exchanged words with him, leading to a double-technical on the pair as well as a type 1 flagrant foul on Kevin Love. About a minute later, Green picked up what appeared to be his second technical foul of the game, which would have forced an ejection. However, the officials confirmed that the first technical was on coach Kerr, not Green as originally recorded. Late in the third, Shumpert and Zaza Pachulia got involved in a mini scuffle when battling for the loose ball, with Pachulia hitting in the direction of Shumpert's groin and Shumpert retaliating. At the same time, a Cavaliers fan, charged onto the court to shout at Matt Barnes during the Warriors huddle as the officials were replaying the incident. Shumpert and Pachulia were assessed double technicals, and the fan was escorted out of the arena by security personnel.\nMany in the media and on Twitter commented on the refereeing in this game, calling it \"a disaster\" and \"a sideshow\".\nGame 5.\nThe Warriors defeated the Cavaliers with a score of 129–120 to win the series 4–1. With this win, the Warriors 16–1 postseason record is the best winning percentage () in NBA playoffs history. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving tried their best to combat the Warriors offense but were unable to overcome a bad night from Kevin Love, who only had six points and a game low minus-21 in his 29 minutes, and the Cavaliers bench, which was outscored 7 to 35 by the Warriors' bench. The Cavaliers did come out aggressive early while Golden State dealt with a series of turnovers. Though the Warriors trailed 41-33 with 10:14 left in the second quarter, they chipped away at that deficit and eventually were able to take a 45-43 lead. David West got tangled up with Irving while fighting for the ball with 3:08 left before halftime; after J.R. Smith pushed West from behind, Tristan Thompson entered the tussle and went face-to-face with West while each jawed at one another. West, Thompson and Smith all received technical fouls after the officials reviewed the replay. A 28-4 run pushed Golden State ahead, just after it looked like Durant committed his third foul on a basket by James that was not called. The Cavaliers were barely able to hold on, trailing by 11 at the end of the half. Cleveland responded in the third quarter by outscoring the Warriors 33-27 to cut the lead to five and eventually to as little as three, but could not withstand the offensive barrage by the Warriors in the fourth. Kevin Durant hit a 17-foot fadeaway over James early in the fourth quarter, then assisted on an Andre Iguodala 3-pointer the next possession as the Warriors began to pull away for good. In the 4th quarter, Stephen Curry hit a three-pointer over Kyrie Irving to seal the game for the Warriors.\nKevin Durant, who was defeated in the 2012 NBA Finals when his Oklahoma City Thunder were finished off 4-1 by LeBron James' Miami Heat, returned the favor by scoring a team high 39 points in the 4-1 series defeat of James' Cavaliers while being honored as the 2017 Finals MVP. Stephen Curry added 34 points, 10 assists and six rebounds alongside Draymond Green's 12 big rebounds. Andre Iguodala, the 2015 Finals MVP, showed up big off the bench with 20 points. LeBron James finished with 41 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists and became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double in the NBA Finals, a feat made all the more impressive with his excellent shooting percentages of 56% from the field and 38% from behind the arc over the 5-game series, with the only blemishes being his poor free-throw shooting and turnover count. Kyrie Irving was the Cavaliers second leading scorer with 26 points on 9 of 22 from the field. However, it was the final game of Irving's career with the Cavaliers before he was traded to the Boston Celtics in the off-season. J. R. Smith scored his 2017 postseason-best 25 points while going 7 of 8 from beyond the arc.\nWith the win at Oracle, the Warriors became the first Bay Area team to win a championship in their home city since the Oakland A's beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 5 of the 1974 World Series (the San Francisco 49ers won Super Bowl XIX in January 1985 at Stanford Stadium in nearby Stanford and the Oakland Athletics won the 1989 World Series in San Francisco), gaining revenge from their 2016 loss.\nRosters.\nGolden State Warriors.\n&lt;noinclude&gt;\nCleveland Cavaliers.\n&lt;noinclude&gt;\nMedia coverage.\nIn the United States, the NBA Finals aired on ABC with Mike Breen as play-by-play commentator, and Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy serving as color commentators. ESPN Radio aired it as well and had Marc Kestecher and Hubie Brown as commentators. ESPN Deportes provided exclusive Spanish-language coverage of The Finals, with a commentary team of Álvaro Martín and Carlos Morales."

        "text": "Charles I. Matthews (born November 15, 1996) is an American professional basketball player who is currently playing for BC Luleå in Sweden. He played college basketball for the Michigan Wolverines. He played his freshman season for the 2015–16 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team after attending St. Rita of Cascia High School. As a high school senior he was a 2015 Jordan Brand Classic All-American selection.\nHe earned West Region Most Outstanding Player in the 2018 NCAA basketball tournament for the 2017–18 team that won the 2018 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament and reached the 2018 NCAA championship game. After playing his redshirt junior season for the 2018–19 Wolverines, he declared for the 2019 NBA draft.\nEarly life.\nMatthews was raised in the Avalon Park Community area of Chicago, near 79th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, which is on the borderline between the Chatham and Greater Grand Crossing Community areas on the South Side. Matthews briefly lived in Matteson, Illinois before returning to the South Side where he attended Ray Elementary and began his basketball career at the 63rd and Stony Island YMCA. In his youth, he played chess, hockey, the trombone and skateboarded, but he began to take basketball seriously the summer before his high school freshman year. Matthews committed to playing basketball for John Calipari and the Kentucky Wildcats on February 26, 2014 during his junior year. At the time, he was rated as the number 11 player and number 3 shooting guard in the national class of 2015 by Rivals.com and number 12 player by ESPN. Among his other offers at the time were Illinois, Kansas, Marquette and Michigan State. Matthews was the first to commit to playing basketball for Kentucky's 2015 class. On June 1, Matthews won the 2014 USA Basketball 3-on-3 Under-18 National Championship Tournament with teammates Braxton Blackwell, Tim Delaney and Kipper Nichols. Matthew earned the tournament's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.\nMatthews officially signed his National Letter of Intent on National Signing Day, November 22, 2014.

After his senior season, he was a selection for the Associated Press' Class-4A All-State first team. Matthews' national ranking fell significantly from the time he committed to Kentucky to the end of his high school career. Although his final rankings were 42nd by ESPN and 48th by Rivals.com, he graduated as the 59th-ranked player according to 247Sports.com's composite ranking. Nonetheless, Matthews was selected to play in the 2015 Jordan Brand Classic. At Kentucky, he joined fellow Chicagoan and former AAU teammate Tyler Ulis in the Kentucky backcourt.\nCollege career.\nKentucky.\nMatthews played in 36 games (including 3 starts) for the 2015–16 Kentucky Wildcats, posting averages of 1.7 points, 1.6 rebounds and 10.3 minutes.

On June 20, 2016, reports confirmed that Matthews, who would have to sit out the 2016–17 season, had visited both Xavier and Michigan and selected Michigan. Michigan confirmed the story on July 1. He served on the scout team for the 2016–17 Michigan Wolverines.\nSophomore Year.\nAs a redshirt sophomore, Matthews scored 20 points against North Florida in his first game at Michigan on November 11, 2017. In the game, he and Duncan Robinson became the first Michigan teammates to score 20 points in a game since March 3, 2015.

        "title": "Rhode Island Rams women's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Rhode Island Rams women's ice hockey team represents the University of Rhode Island (URI) in Women's Division 1 of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA). Since the team's 1999 inauguration, the Rams have been one of the most successful programs in intercollegiate women's ice hockey, winning nine regular season and nine playoff titles in the 15-year existence of the Eastern Collegiate Women's Hockey League, both ECWHL records. The Rams have also qualified for 12 of the 18 ACHA National Tournaments held for women's teams, a number that trails only Massachusetts, Michigan and Michigan State. Highlighting Rhode Island's 12 ACHA tournament bids are eight semifinal appearances, including five in a row from 2004 through 2008. The team's present coach, Ashley Pagliarini, was a standout defenseman at URI from 2004 through 2009 and is just the second head coach in team history, taking over for program founder Beth McCann for the 2014–15 season.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1999–2003).\nThe first women's teams at URI, typical of a new program, lost more games than they won, posting a 6–33–1 mark from the inaugural 1999–2000 season through 2001–02. For the team's first four years, it primarily used the West Warwick Ice Rink in West Warwick, Rhode Island - roughly a half hour drive from campus - as its home facility. Early schedules featured a mix of top club programs of the day, as well as junior varsity teams from NCAA Division I schools and NCAA Division III teams. Rhode Island's 2000–01 schedule, for example, included future ECWHL opponents Boston University, Massachusetts and Penn State from the first category, alongside the JV team from Brown and DIII's Salve Regina. The Rams' sole victory that year came against the Providence Lady Reds program.\nIn the 2001–02 season, URI became a member of the ACHA Women's Division (later ACHA Women's Division 1) in its second year of existence, as the organization provided much-needed structure, regulation and a national championship tournament for non-varsity women's college hockey. The Rams' 5–12–0 record in 2001–02 merited a final ranking of fourth in the East Region (at the time, the ACHA was split into three regions, with the top two from each receiving national tournament bids, along with two wild card selections). An improved team in 2002–03 achieved its first winning mark at 10–7–3, boosting the program to a near-miss for the ACHA National Tournament at third in the East Region. The Rams' stars in their formative years included Marina Riva and Lauren Marx, each of whom ranked among the top ten nationally in 2002–03 scoring. Marina Riva won the leading scorer award for the team in the 2002–03 season with 20 goals and 15 assists for a total of 35 points. Forward Heather Scherick became the first in URI's long line of ACHA award winners by earning All-American Honorable Mention that season.\nThe $12 million, 2,500-seat Bradford R. Boss Arena, which finally gave the Rams a top on-campus facility and would prove instrumental to the program's growth in the years that followed, opened in the fall of 2002.\nExploding on the scene (2003–2004).\nAlthough the Rams showed steady improvement over their first four years, there really wasn't much indication of what would follow in season five: an immediate and decisive ascension into one of the nation's best programs, a status that continues to the present day.\nCoinciding with this development was the advent of the ECWHL thanks to the efforts of McCann, who also served as the league's first commissioner. Buffalo, Penn State, Massachusetts and Boston University stood as URI's conference rivals in 2003–04.\nRhode Island served notice of the shift immediately, taking 15 of the first 16 games on the schedule. Notable among the results were a 4–2 win over NCAA Division I Sacred Heart on October 26, 2003, behind Robin Rosselle, who scored twice and assisted on the other two Rhody tallies. Win 15 of that opening salvo came on January 9, 2004, by a 4–3 score against defending national champion Michigan State. The next week, URI finished second at the UMass White Out Tournament, an invitational packed with powerhouses like the hosting Minutewomen, West Los Angeles College, Colorado and Robert Morris (IL), before thoroughly dominating the schedule's home stretch. Against Buffalo, Penn State, Bates College, UMass and Saint Anselm, the Rams went 9–0–0 and scored 50 times while only surrendering 11 goals. A 2–2 draw with NCAA Division III Holy Cross closed out the regular season.\nDriving the team's success were a bevy of top players, some familiar, some new. Riva, Marx and Scherick were all still around, as was Jen Wallace, already well on her way to putting together one of the most spectacular careers in team history by that point. Rosselle headlined a stellar group of freshman that also included Alysa Coleman, Karen Hawes and Lynn Pecci, who would become a mainstay in the Rams' crease during the middle part of the decade. Wallace (33 goals, 26 assists) and Hawes (20 goals, 27 assists) finished first and second in the national scoring race, while Scherick, Rosselle, Riva and Marx also placed highly on the list.\nIn the first-ever ECWHL playoffs, hosted at Boss Arena, Rhody was just as dominant as during its 8–0–0 league regular season, dispatching BU (7–2) and UMass (9–2) to win the title and lock down the national number three ranking into the ACHA National Tournament. Things started well in East Lansing, MI as URI took first in its pool and made the semifinals with decisive wins over West LA and Iowa State, before taking down MSU for the second time in 2003–04 during the final four round. The dream season - which resulted in a program-best 32 wins - came to a disappointing end one victory shy however, as Wisconsin topped the Rams 3–1 in the ACHA championship clash.\nA dynasty without a title (2004–2008).\nThe spectacular 2003–04 season was hardly a one-off affair as URI recharged with another great incoming class, headlined by Pagliarini and goaltender Kelly Jourdain, while retaining most of its core. A steady flow of other program legends like Kate Garcia (2005–09), Jolene Rambone (2006–10), Justine Ducie (2007–11) and Meghan Birnie (2008-12) arriving in subsequent seasons ensured that the Rams remained in constant contention. Helsinki, Finland native Johanna Leskinen (2008–12) was also part of that progression, and would go on to become the program's all-time leading scorer with 116 goals and 188 points in 112 games. Appropriately, given the caliber of players wearing Keaney blue, the Rams won every single regular season and playoff title for the first five years of the ECWHL's existence and cemented their status as the northeast's dominant team by taking the top spot in the East or Northeast Region (as applicable) in 24 of the 27 regional rankings issued between 2003–04 and 2009–10, after which the regional poll was discontinued.\nRhody's success translated on a national scale as well, as McCann collected a pair of ACHA coach of the year awards in 2004–05 and 2007–08. Both came during a stretch that saw her team qualify for the ACHA semifinals in five consecutive seasons, from the runner-up finish of 2003–04 through 2007–08, when defending national champion Robert Morris (IL) took out the Rams in the final four round. The latter result was part of a disheartening trend: while Rhode Island was great, it just couldn't manage to scale two of the other dominant programs of the time. Lindenwood, which beat URI in the 2007 semifinals, won the 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2010 national titles while RMU, which knocked URI out of nationals in 2005, 2006 and 2008 were the champs in 2005 and 2007 (the Lions and Eagles, in fact, went head to head in the title game to end four straight seasons, from 2006 through 2009). The Rams' run in the 2006 tournament was among the team's closest calls since the 2004 title game, as Chelsea Skorupski and Emily Tuohey put Rhode Island up 2–0 on RMU in the semis before a natural hat trick from 2006–07 Zoë M. Harris Award winner Savannah Varner flipped the result to 3–2 for the Eagles.\nIn 2007–08, URI had another of the program's best seasons, as the Rams tore through their ACHA regular season schedule unbeaten at 19–0–2 (part of a 19–5–3 overall regular season mark that also included six contests against NCAA teams). Included in that run, most impressively, was a 4–1 win against Lindenwood at Boss Arena on November 16, 2007, behind two points from Emily Gasper and goals by Ducie and Pagliarini. Three months later, Ducie would strike again - in triple overtime against UMass - to give Rhody a fifth consecutive ECWHL tournament title on February 24, 2008. Rhode Island subsequently plowed through Michigan, Northern Michigan and Minnesota to open nationals in Bensenville, Illinois, before seeing its ACHA unbeaten streak end at 28 games with a 3–1 loss to host school Robert Morris (IL) in the semifinals.\nCarrying a tag like \"The Best Team to Never Win a National Title\" with finishes in second place (once), fourth place (once) and third place (three times) over a five-year span is certainly a mixed bag, but Rhode Island could at least take solace in its eastern dominance. The team went 51–1–3 within the ECWHL from 2003–08, with a season sweep of a nationals-qualifying Penn State team by 9–1 and 8–1 scores in 2006–07 standing as one glaring example of the separation between the Rams and most of the rest of the league during the middle part of the 21st century's first decade.\nMounting challenges, continued success (2008–2014).\nIncreasingly, as the ECWHL neared its tenth birthday, Rhode Island saw its hegemony at the top of the league challenged. The 2008–09 season featured a team besides URI win an ECWHL regular season or playoff title for the first time ever in the form of Massachusetts, which finished in first place during the regular season. Northeastern, fresh off of a 2010 national championship in ACHA Division II, joined Division I and the ECWHL and were a strong contender during their first years in the league. In 2010–11, the Huskies became the first team other than the Rams to win the ECWHL's playoff championship with a 6–5 win over URI at Boss Arena, while also taking the regular season crown by a single point over Rhode Island to shut the Ocean Staters out of both ECWHL titles for the first time ever. NU added insult to injury the next season by claiming the ACHA national championship that had long eluded the Rams in just its second Division I campaign.\nDespite the heightened competition within the league, URI more than held their own by winning four playoff and two regular season ECWHL titles over six years from 2008–09 through 2013–14, a combined total doubling that of UMass, the next highest team. All the while, the Rams continued running off ACHA National Tournament appearances, compiling a streak of 11 consecutive bids through 2013–14 - a number that has only been surpassed in ACHA history by UMass (14, 2005–18) and Michigan State (13, 2002–14). The national title-related frustration continued as well though, as Rhode Island continued to run into teams of destiny at the tourney. In 2009–10, the Lindenwood dynasty again presented a wall too high in the semifinals, while ascending Northeastern posed the same problem the following year and 2012–13 champion Minnesota blocked URI in the pool stage that time around.\nFollowing disappointingly short ACHA tournament runs in the springs of 2012 and 2013, McCann assembled one of her strongest teams in 2013–14. That squad featured a Zoë M. Harris Player of the Year Award winner (Cassie Catlow in 2012–13), four players picked for World University Games teams (Catlow in both 2013 and 2015, Alisha DiFilippo in 2013, Lauren Hillberg in 2013 and Kristen Levesque in 2015) and six players who would be picked as first or second team All-Americans at some point during their careers (Catlow, DiFilippo, Hillberg, Brenna Callahan, Sydney Collins and Kayla DiLorenzo). With the talent cupboards again fully loaded, the Rams took both ECWHL championships for the first time since 2009–10 by shutting out both Vermont and UMass in the playoffs. URI carried the third seed to the ACHA National Tournament in Newark, Delaware, and went unbeaten in the pool round (including a tie with eventual national champion Miami), qualifying for the semifinals for the first time in three years. However, the Minutewomen exacted revenge for the ECWHL title and ousted Rhody there by a 2–1 score.\nTumult and resurgence (2014–present).\nMcCann, by 2014 ACHA's longest-tenured coach by a wide margin, surprisingly did not have her contract renewed by the team that summer, which ended her 15-year run with a 304–128–26 overall record. In McCann's place stepped one of her former star players, 2009 graduate Pagliarini, who had been coaching the Cranston Thunderbirds (a high school co-op team combining players from Cranston High School East, Cranston High School West and East Greenwich High School). Following Pagliarini's first season at the helm in 2014–15, URI student paper \"The Good 5 Cent Cigar\" reported that both ends of the coaching change were far from unanimous decisions within the team - the player vote against keeping McCann was 11–10, while the replacement search committee was similarly divided on Pagliarini - and largely blamed on the abrasive behavior of the former coach's husband Tracy, who had also been on the staff. The 2014–15 season started well, with the Rams moving into the ACHA's top five and highlighted by a 4–3 come-from-behind overtime win at second-ranked Liberty, which gave the eventual national champion Flames their first loss. Just two days after the big win, however, a coach-player disagreement at practice resulted in All-American goaltender DiLorenzo being kicked off the team, while two other players also left the squad during the season. Notably, DiLorenzo was the Rams' only goaltender, which forced star forward/defenseman Collins to log 440 minutes in net until a late-season replacement was found. Although the Rams largely survived the rough patch and finished with a 21–11–1 overall record while reaching the ECWHL championship game, a blowout loss to Massachusetts in that final and narrowly missing out on the ACHA National Tournament for the first time since 2003 brought the campaign to a bitter close.\nBy her second year in charge, Pagliarini managed to stabilize things, as senior tri-captains Collins, DiFilippo and Callahan, along with classmate Levesque, dominated the ACHA scoring charts. Callahan, with 29 points, was the second-highest-scoring defenseman in ACHA Division 1, while Collins (49 points), DiFilippo (43) and Levesque (38) ranked fourth, seventh and ninth among all DI players. Thanks largely to the four goals per game average those players helped produce, URI returned to national prominence with an eighth ECWHL regular season championship and a 12th bid to the ACHA National Tournament. The following season, 2016–17, despite breakout years from Monica Darby (43 points, good for third in the nation) and rookie Madison Balutowski (28 goals, also third), URI narrowly missed nationals for the second time in three years.\nRumors of NCAA status.\nThe continued national success of the Rams, along with URI's men's team and Rhode Island's status as the only New England state without NCAA Division I hockey at its flagship university, has led to frequent rumors of the school adding men's and women's hockey as varsity sports. Most of these began with the completion of Boss Arena, a facility considered capable of hosting NCAA hockey, in 2002, an occasion that led to then-athletic director Ron Petro to openly research the concept. Petro told college hockey news site \"USCHO\" that \"During [the last academic] year, the president [of URI] asked for a survey, so I talked to people from Hockey East, the ECAC and the MAAC as to URI - if we were able to fund it - getting into a league. I made a recommendation to the president in April, but we've been hit with budget cuts as most people have been, so we've delayed any decision on that until we can get a better hold on how to finance a Division I hockey program for men and women, which we know would be way over a million dollars. We are the only state university in New England that doesn't support a team. That would be a goal of mine in the future, but it all comes down to funding.\" More recently, a wave of conference realignment in NCAA hockey between 2012 and 2014 led to DI men's league Atlantic Hockey maintaining a less-than-ideal odd number of members, 11. Rhode Island's men were involved in discussions to join Atlantic Hockey, with the women possibly receiving varsity status as well by joining AHC's sister league, College Hockey America. However, in September 2014, athletic director Thorr Bjorn torpedoed things by flatly stating that the school \"isn't currently looking at adding varsity hockey to our slate of offered sports.\" Nevertheless, Rhode Island is frequently mentioned by fans and writers as a candidate for NCAA expansion on a more informal basis.\nSeason by season results.\nSources:\n† Rhode Island was the 2009–10 ECWHL playoff champion, which likely means that the Rams won at least two additional games that season beyond the 18 counted, however game scores for those playoffs are not available.\n‡ In the 2007 ECWHL playoffs, Rhode Island was originally scheduled to play Penn State in the semifinal round. However, PSU was unable to travel to the playoffs, resulting in a forfeit and URI's automatic advancement to the championship game. A game against non-ECWHL member Nichols was added as a fill-in during the scheduled semifinal.\nProgram records.\nAs of April 14, 2016.

A preseason ranking was initiated beginning with 2014–15. Beginning with the 2016–17 season, the ACHA tabulated rankings each week during the season and issued them on Tuesdays following weekends including games.\nRegional rankings.\nFrom 2000–01 through 2002–03, regional rankings were the sole method for determining ACHA National Tournament bids. The inaugural 2000–01 season (which did not include Rhode Island) featured teams divided into East and West Regions, with the top four from each in February's final ranking invited to nationals. For 2001–02 and 2002–03, the setup was expanded to include East, Central and West Regions. Under that system, the top two from each region were invited to nationals, along with two wild card teams. In 2003–04, the tournament field was expanded to 12 teams, and a national ranking was introduced. The latter development diminished the importance of the regional rankings, as the national rankings were used to determine nationals bids. Regional champions were still awarded an autobid, however, even if ranked outside of the top 12 nationally. In 2004–05, growth in the number of ACHA women's teams resulted in an increase to four regions - Northeast, Southeast, Central and West - although things reverted to East, Central and West in 2007–08. The 2009–10 season was notable both for the fact that the tournament field was reduced back to eight teams and as the final year of the regional system, which had become largely antiquated as regional champions generally had little issue placing highly in the national rankings.\nACHA national honors.\nAnnual awards.\nAll-Americans and All-Tournament selections including all seasons except 2008–09.

Five different Rhode Island players have been picked for Team USA a total of six times. The 2013 contingent, including defenseman Lauren Hillberg and forwards Alisha DiFilippo and Cassie Catlow, made history as members of the just the second American squad in history to win a WUG medal by taking the bronze (a men's Team USA also won bronze in 1972, although they did so by finishing third in a three-team tournament), and the first group of women or men to do so since the ACHA began stocking the teams, an era that began in 2001 on the men's side. Both DiFilippo and Catlow scored in one of the team's biggest wins, a 4–2 victory over a Russian squad featuring Anna Prugova, Yekaterina Nikolayeva, Anna Shukina, and several others who have played for the senior Russia women's national ice hockey team. Catlow, in particular, starred during the tournament, posting two goals and four assists in seven games to finish tied for second on the squad in scoring.\n2010 ACHA women's select team.\nAs a precursor to World University Games participation, the ACHA assembled a women's select team that toured Geneva, Switzerland, Chamonix, France and Méribel, France during April 2010. The team included Rhode Island players Jolene Rambone (who served as captain), Justine Ducie, Danika Korpacz and Johanna Leskinen and was led by Rams head coach Beth McCann. Its final record overseas was 2–2–0, including two close losses to the France women's national ice hockey team and two decisive wins over local club teams.\nRivalries.\nMassachusetts.\nBy any measure, Rhode Island-Massachusetts is one of the nation's best rivalries, mirroring the well-regarded clashes between the universities separated by roughly a two-hour drive in men's basketball and other sports. Both are long-standing members of the ACHA's ruling class and are far and away the top two programs in the northeast, as evidenced by the fact that both rank among the top four nationally in number of ACHA National Tournament appearances. Naturally, the ECWHL title tends to be decided by URI-UMass meetings - the teams have combined to win all but one of the conference's playoff championships and all but two of its regular season crowns in 14 seasons of league play. The two have directly collided in the conference championship game at least nine times (the 2010 playoffs are undocumented), with the Rams holding a 6–3 advantage in those meetings (although the Minutewomen have won the last three, in 2015, 2016 and 2017, most recently by a 3–0 count). The 2008 final was particularly notable. In that contest, Rhode Island stormed out to a 3–0 lead after the first period, only to see Massachusetts reply with four unanswered to take the lead in the third period. However, the Rams' Rachel MacDonald forced overtime with 3:25 remaining, allowing URI's Justine Ducie to win the trophy in the sixth minute of the third extra period. Both URI (12 times) and UMass (13 times) have qualified for the ACHA championships very frequently in their 14 years of conference membership, so ECWHL playoff failures have generally not proven fatal - or final. The teams have met five times at the ACHA National Tournament, with the Rams holding a 3–1–1 head-to-head edge. Each side has knocked the other from the tournament once, with a 1–0 Rhode Island win in the 2007 quarterfinals answered by a 2–1 result for the Minutewomen in the 2014 semifinals. During the 2016 tournament, with both teams already eliminated in the pool stage, URI gained a measure of revenge for UMass' victory in the ECWHL title game three weeks earlier with a 5–2 win behind two goals each from Alisha DiFilippo and Monica Darby.\nOne other significant event in the rivalry's history took place in 2007, when Cara Murphy transferred from URI to UMass. Murphy had been a second-team All-American twice with the Rams, while leading the team in scoring during the 2006–07 season, and finished her career in the Bay Staters' colors with another pair of All-American seasons.\nPenn State.\nPerhaps no series has reflected URI's status quite like the one with Penn State. Penn State's original women's hockey team was a powerhouse in the early days of ACHA sanctioning, and accordingly drummed the then-building Rams by a combined 50–2 count over four games during the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons. However, the fortunes of both teams drastically reversed once each became a charter member of the ECWHL in 2003–04. Rhode Island thoroughly dominated the series from there, starting with a 28-game unbeaten run lasting from November 15, 2003, until October 23, 2010 and finishing 34–2–1 against the Lady Icers from 2003–04 through 2011–12 (including 4–0–0 in the ECWHL playoffs and a 5–0 result at the 2010 ACHA National Tournament). PSU transitioned its team to NCAA Division I for the 2012–13 season, but the university also formed a new ACHA program that year, which eventually joined ACHA Division 1 and the ECWHL in 2014–15. URI has gone 12–1–0 against the second team, called the Lady Ice Lions, including ECWHL playoff semifinal wins in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The rivalry received a bit of added spice when, on the heels of that 2015 semifinal win and despite the Rams taking two of the three meetings during 2014–15, Penn State received the final bid to the ACHA National Tournament ahead of URI.\nRobert Morris (IL).\nDespite the series being played infrequently with the teams in separate conferences and geographic regions, Robert Morris (IL) represented something of a bogey team for Rhode Island during some of the best seasons for both programs. RMU appeared in five straight ACHA national championship games from 2005 through 2009, winning the 2005 and 2007 titles. That stretch, of course, significantly overlaps with URI's five ACHA semifinals appearances in a row from 2004 through 2008. The resulting clashes of the titans generally went the Eagles' way, as they knocked the Rams from that semifinal round in 2005, 2006 and 2008. Overall, Rhode Island is 0–6–0 against RMU in ACHA tournament play, with the most recent contest taking place in 2012, when the Eagles once again blocked Beth McCann's squad from advancement with a 2–0 win in the final game of the pool round. The most recent meeting between the sides occurred during the 2014–15 regular season, with a Cassie Catlow hat trick powering a 6–4 URI win before RMU forfeited the second game of the series.\nSacred Heart.\nAlthough games between the Rams and Sacred Heart, an NCAA Division I program, count for little more than bragging rights, SHU is a staple of Rhode Island's schedule each season and a valuable measuring-stick opponent. The teams have met at least twice every year since 2003–04, with the Pioneers holding a decisive 37–3–0 series edge. Rhode Island's most recent win used a DiFilippo hat trick and 45 Abigail Torres saves to upend homestanding SHU by a 3–2 score on November 21, 2015.\nPlayers.\nCurrent roster.\nAs of October 18, 2017."

He won the championship in Switzerland's second-tier division National League B (NLB) with SC Herisau in 1997 and with SC Langnau one year later, helping both clubs to promotion to the top-flight National League A (NLA). Fust played in a total of 266 NLA contests for Langnau and HC Ambrì-Piotta, before spending the last two years of his playing career in the NLB, turning out for HC Forward Morges and HC Sierre.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing the end of his playing career, Fust started an education at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, while working as a volunteer assistant coach of a college team.\nFust kicked off his head coaching career at Swiss NLB side EHC Visp in December 2007. He guided Visp to the NLB finals in 2010 and left the club at the end of the 2009-10 season to take charge of NLA team SCL Tigers, where he had spent five years as a player. Fust coached the Tigers to a sixth-place finish in the 2010-11 NLA regular season and their first ever trip to the NLA playoffs. He was relieved of his head coaching duties in December 2012 after a series of eight straight losses.\nHe was named assistant coach of NLA side Lausanne HC for the 2013-14 campaign and opted to leave the team after one year to work for the Swiss ice hockey federation: Fust served as assistant to head coach Glen Hanlon on the men's national team and took over the head coaching job at the Swiss U20 national team. After Hanlon stepped aside in October 2015, Fust served as interim head coach of the Swiss national team during the 2015 Deutschland-Cup and was then succeeded by Patrick Fischer. Fust remained in his position at the U20 national team until his contract with the Swiss ice hockey federation ended in 2016.\nIn April 2016, he signed a contract to return to EHC Visp. He took over the head coaching job at the club. In March 2017, he parted ways with the club after falling to HC La Chaux-de-Fonds in the NLB quarterfinals. Fust was named head coach of Swiss National League team Lausanne HC on February 8, 2018, replacing Yves Sarault. He stayed on the job until the end of the 2017-18 season and took over the job as head of the youth development at Lausanne in May 2018. Additionally, he was named an assistant coach for the Danish Men's National Team in April 2019.\nPersonal.\nFust's grandparents emigrated from St. Gallen, Switzerland to Canada in the 1920s. He obtained Swiss citizenship in 1984."

Their head coach was Tom Crean, in what would ultimately be his final season in Bloomington. The team played its home games at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, as a member of the Big Ten Conference.\nDespite the highs of the previous season and being ranked as high as No. 3 in the nation, the Hoosiers faced a troubling and disappointing year; they finished 18–16 overall and 7–11 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for 10th place. At the Big Ten tournament they defeated Iowa in the second round to advance to the quarterfinals where they lost to Wisconsin. The Hoosiers missed out on the NCAA tournament and lost in the first round of the NIT, their first appearance since 2005, to Georgia Tech. The game was played at Georgia Tech's McCamish Pavilion because Indiana Athletic Director Fred Glass declined to host a home game at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall citing concern it would \"devalue\" the Hoosiers' home court.\nOn March 16, 2017, Indiana fired Crean after nine years as head coach. On March 25, 2017, the school hired Archie Miller as head coach.\nPrevious season.\nThe Hoosiers finished the 2015–16 season with a record 27–8, 15–3 in Big Ten play to win the Big Ten regular season title outright, pushing the school's total to 22 conference titles (tied with conference rival, Purdue, for the most). They received the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament, where they made an early quarterfinals exit by losing to Michigan. The team received a No. 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament, and defeated Chattanooga and Kentucky having won two games before being eliminated in the Sweet 16 by North Carolina.\nPreseason.\nRecruiting class.\nIndiana was able to land its top recruit in De'Ron Davis, when he announced his commitment to become a Hoosier on November 12, 2015. IU aggressively pursued Davis for more than 3 years, and they eventually beat out Mississippi State for the highly touted 6'9 forward from Aurora, Colorado. After leading Overland High School to two consecutive 5A state championship titles, Davis was crowned 2016 Colorado Mr. Basketball.\nOn April 24, 2016, a fifth man was added to the recruiting class after JUCO transfer, Freddie McSwain Jr., committed to play for IU. McSwain hails from Hinesville, Georgia and played basketball at Neosho County Community College.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NIT"

It was named the Midwest Collegiate League (MCL) from 2010 to 2021.\nHistory.\nFormed in 2010, as a four-team summer collegiate wood bat league, MCL played their first season in the summer of 2011. The original four members were the Chicago Zephyrs, Rockford Foresters, Southland Vikings and Will County CrackerJacks. Teams play a 45 game schedule with league playoffs. The league all-star game is played sometime around mid-season.\nThe league expanded to eight teams for their second season in 2012, with the addition of the DeKalb County Liners, DuPage County Hounds, Illinois Lincolns and Northwest Indiana Oilmen. Two of the teams (Illinois and Will County) failed to complete the season schedule.\nSix teams made up the 2013 season as the league welcomed the Lexington Snipes, replacing DeKalb County.\nMCL stayed steady with six teams with the addition of the Joliet Admirals (2014) and Michigan City Lakers (2015) replacing two teams (Rockford in 2014; Chicago in 2015) who ceased operations.\nBefore the 2016 season, the Lexington Snipes announced that they would sit out the season. The league continued with six teams with the addition of the Bloomington Bobcats.\nThe Crestwood Panthers, the newest team in the Midwest Collegiate League, replaced the Michigan City Lakers before the 2017 season.\nBefore the 2018 season, the Joliet Admirals became the Joliet Generals.\nDuring the 2020 season, the MCL Minutemen made their debut and stayed in the league for two seasons.\nAfter the 2021 season, the Midwest Collegiate League rebranded itself to the Northern League. The Northern League was a name used by several baseball leagues between 1902 and 2010 as is described on the pages listed at Northern League.\nFor the 2023 season, the Joliet Generals relocated from Illinois to Griffith, Indiana as the Griffith Generals; the Crestwood Panthers moved to Highland, Indiana as the Indiana Panthers; and the Chicago American Giants were replaced by the Elkhart County Miracle in Nappanee, Indiana. With these changes, all of the league's teams are located in Indiana.\nChampions.\nChampionship series are a best-of three."

They finished the season 19–13, 9–9 in AAC play to finish in a tie for fifth place. They lost in the quarterfinals of the AAC tournament to UCF. Despite having 19 wins, they did not participate in a postseason tournament.\nPrevious season.\nThe Tigers finished the 2015–16 season with a record of 19–15 and 8–10 in AAC play to finish in a tie for fifth place in conference. The Tigers lost in the championship game of the AAC tournament to UConn. The Tigers did not participate in a postseason tournament marking the second consecutive year that the Tigers had missed the postseason entirely.\nJosh Pastner left Memphis to take the head coaching job at Georgia Tech on April 8, 2016. On April 14, 2016, the school hired Tubby Smith to take over as head coach.\nCoaching staff.\nThe Tigers hired coach Orlando \"Tubby\" Smith to replace Josh Pastner in April 2016. Smith faced his first controversy as Tiger head coach early. Keelon Lawson, father of Tiger players KJ and Dedric Lawson, had served for two years as an assistant for Pastner, but Smith did not initially want to retain Lawson in that role to make room for his son on the staff. This caused Lawson to reenter his son Dedric in the 2016 draft and hint that KJ would be transferring. However, on April 25, 2016, \"The Commercial Appeal\" reported that Lawson would be retained on the basketball staff as director of player personnel. By moving Lawson to Director of player development it prevents him from recruiting off campus. Where his close ties to area coaches and talent would give him an advantage with Memphis area recruits. An area where Smith and his staff has been very weak in past jobs. With a recruiting class average in the 70s at Texas Tech. His first class at Memphis was ranked 92nd compared to the top 10 class in Pastner's last year at Memphis- Lawson claimed he never intended to indicate that his sons would be leaving the program upon the announcement of his reassignment. Dedric, however, remained entered in the draft and attended the draft combine before withdrawing his name in mid May and returning to Memphis.\nThe U of M announced that presumptive starting center Nick Marshall unexpectedly left the team on August 1, 2016 when he went to live with his pregnant girlfriend. Marshall was not expected to return to Memphis.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"|American Athletic Conference tournament"

        "title": "Kent County Cricket Club in 2016",
        "text": "In 2016, Kent County Cricket Club competed in Division Two of the County Championship, the Royal London One-Day Cup and the NatWest t20 Blast. The season was the fifth, and last, in charge for head coach Jimmy Adams and the first for new club captain Sam Northeast, who took over from Robert Key at the end of the 2015 season, having captained the side on the field for much of the season.\nSam Billings continued to be selected for England limited overs squads, although he had to settle for only three appearances in 2016. On 21 February, he played in the second of two T20I matches at the end of the South Africa tour, scoring 5 runs in Johannesburg. Billings was selected in England's squad for the 2016 World Twenty20 in India, but did not play during the tournament other than as a substitute fielder. On 5 July, he featured in the only T20I during Sri Lanka's tour of England. Billings played a single ODI, the final match of three during England's tour of Bangladesh, on 12 October at Chittagong, opening the batting with a useful 62 in a four wicket win.\nSam Northeast won the club's Player of the Year award, having scored over 2,000 runs across all formats for a second successive season.\nSquad.\nDepartures.\nIn October 2015, Kent Cricket Academy graduate and England Under-19 wicket-keeper Ryan Davies left the club, signing for Somerset in search of more regular first XI cricket. All-rounder Ben Harmison was released in February after four seasons with Kent. On 18 April 2016, former captain Rob Key announced his retirement from playing. Key had spent his entire career with Kent and captained the side for nine years over two spells. He also represented England at international level, and scored a total of 19,419 first-class runs since his debut in 1998.\nFollowing the end of the season, fast bowlers David Griffiths and Sam Weller were released by Kent, neither having their contracts renewed, whilst 40-year old all-rounder Darren Stevens signed a new one-year contract to extend his time at the county. In October head coach Jimmy Adams also left the county to return to his native Jamaica. After his loan spell, Will Gidman signed a permanent contract with Kent in October 2016 having been released by Nottinghamshire.\nArrivals.\nFormer Hampshire and Gloucestershire wicket-keeper Adam Rouse signed for Kent in January on a two-year contract. Rouse had previously played for Kent's Second XI in 2014, and returned for a trial in April 2015 as cover for Sam Billings. Billings missed almost the first two months of the season due to being drafted by the Delhi Daredevils franchise for the 2016 Indian Premier League season.\nIn February, Kent announced the signing of two overseas players. First the club announced that South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada would have a spell with Kent from late June until the end of July, between international commitments. The young bowler impressed during England's tour of South Africa, which had recently concluded. A few days later, the club announced the signing of New Zealand international batsman Tom Latham to play in all three competitions during the season. Latham's last match before joining up with his national team for a tour of Zimbabwe was a T20 fixture against Gloucestershire on 8 July. In 2015, the squad had not featured anyone classified as an overseas player.\nAfter Rouse suffered a hand injury in June, and Billings was called into the England T20 squad, former Sussex wicket-keeper Callum Jackson was signed in early July. Kent would otherwise have been without a wicket-keeper in their County Championship match against Essex at the beginning of the month. Jackson had played as a substitute wicket-keeper during the Championship match at Glamorgan in June following Rouse's injury.\nIn late July, Kent announced the signing of Will Gidman from Nottinghamshire on a one-month loan deal. The former Gloucestershire all-rounder had recently returned from injury and would be available for four One-Day Cup games and two County Championship matches. Captain Sam Northeast stated that Gidman's signing would bolster the side's resources with Calum Haggett and Fabian Cowdrey unavailable through injury. Having impressed during this spell, Gidman's loan deal was extended for the remaining three matches of the season.\nOn 19 August, Kent announced the signing of South Africa international fast-bowler Hardus Viljoen as the overseas player for the final four County Championship matches of the season, with the club citing a number of injuries to bowlers over the course the season as the reason for the signing.\nCounty Championship.\nKent played 16 County Championship matches in 2016, playing once at home and once away against each of the other eight counties in Division Two. Six home matches were played at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, with one match at both the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells and the County Cricket Ground, Beckenham. The county won five games, drew eight and lost only twice in the Championship, finishing second to Essex County Cricket Club. In previous years a second-place finish would have led to promotion to Division One of the Championship, but 2016 saw a rebalancing of the number of teams in each division and, as a result, only one team was promoted.\nKent's match against Worcestershire at New Road in April was abandoned without a ball bowled due to a water-logged outfield. This match was classed as a draw and five points were awarded to each side.\nDurham, who had finished 4th in Division One, were deducted 48 points by the ECB at the end of the season as a result of their financial problems. This resulted in their relegation to Division Two. The ECB announced that Hampshire, who had finished 8th in Division One, would be reprieved from relegation. Kent chairman, George Kennedy, launched an appeal claiming that Kent should be promoted instead of this reprieve for Hampshire given the one-off scenario of the runners-up of Division Two missing out on promotion in 2016. The ECB did not change their decision, meaning that Kent will remain in Division Two for the 2017 season.\nOther first-class match.\nKent played a three-day match with first-class status against Loughborough MCC University before the start of the County Championship season. Daniel Bell-Drummond scored his maiden first-class double century on day one, but only 6.3 overs were possible on day two due to rain, and the match ended in a draw.\nRoyal London One-Day Cup.\nKent began their 2016 Royal London One-Day Cup campaign with a match against Surrey at the County Ground, Beckenham on Sunday 5 June. They played 8 games in the group stage of the competition, finishing in second place and securing a home quarter-final against Yorkshire. Kent lost the quarter-final by 11 runs, being bowled out chasing Yorkshire's score of 256.\nNatWest t20 Blast.\nKent began their t20 Blast campaign in the South Group with a match against Somerset at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury on Friday 20 May. They played 14 games in the group stage of the competition, winning six and failing to qualify for the knock-out stages after losing their final two matches. As well as five home matches at Canterbury, a single match was hosted at each of Beckenham and Tunbridge Wells.\nStatistics.\nBatting.\nSource: Cricinfo\nSource: CricInfo\nSource: CricInfo\nBowling.\nSource: CricInfo\nSource: CricInfo\nSource: CricInfo"

A loss at Indiana led to another seven-games winning streak, including wins over non-conference foe Oklahoma State and rival Michigan pushing MSU to a No. 7 ranking.. A home loss to No. 25 Purdue and No. 24 Minnesota in two of their next four games dropped MSU out of the top ten rankings, slipping to 12th. The Spartans would rally to win four of their final five games to finish the regular season ranked No. 11 and one game behind conference champions Purdue.\nThe Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament as the No. 3 seed in the Southeast region.

        "text": "Ligat Ha'Al (Hebrew: ליגת העל בכדוריד lit. 'The Super League in Handball') is the top Israeli professional handball league. The league is sponsored by Winner Corporation since 2010 and known also as Ligat Winner. Founded in 1954, the league currently consists of 12 teams and managed by the Israel Handball Association. Maccabi Rehovot was the first team to win the championship, while Hapoel Rishon Lezion is most successful club with 18 titles over the years. The league games are broadcast by Sport 5 channel.\nHistory.\nThe league was established in 1954–55 with 10 teams competing in a double round-robin tournament, and with Maccabi Rehovot winning the first three championships. At first, all matches were played as Field handball, with 11 players on the field, before reverting to 7-players handball, with the last matches being held on football fields were held in 1963. Until the 1980s, the handball in Israel was centered in places such as Rehovot, Ramat Gan and Petah Tikva, as 7 clubs played in these cities. But starting in the 1980s, the hegemony moved to Rishon Lezion, as local Maccabi won three titles in a row between 1984 and 1986. Important clubs like Hapoel Rehovot were dissolved because of financial issues. The three cities which were very successful in the Israeli handball, Rehovot, Ramat Gan and Petah Tikva, deteriorated.\nThrough all the 1990s, Hapoel Rishon indisputably dominated the league and won 9 championship in a row. They enjoyed from the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and signed a lot of players who were famous in Europe such as Igor Bialik, Leonid Bernstein, Evgeni Oleinik and more. In 2002 Hapoel lost the championship to ASA Tel Aviv. One year later Hapoel won it again but the hegemony and the full domination in the handball ended when Maccabi Rishon with the notable head coach Gilad Maor grew stronger. Maccabi Rishon won their first championship in the new age in 2004, after they won ASA Tel Aviv in the final. Since then, for ten years, the championship stayed in Rishon Lezion and moved between Maccabi and Hapoel.\nA lot of famous Israeli players played in the league, while the most famous is Idan Maimon, the all-time best Israeli player, with more than 3,500 goals. Other famous players: Doron Dayan, Amir Popko, Danny Turkenitz, Shlomo Hofman, Dudi Balsar, Harel Moritz, Akiva Lefler, Eyal Shur, Shachar Haber, Eitan Madmoni, Oleg Butenko, Benny Ne'eman Yoav Ne'eman, Chen Pomeranz and Avishay Smoler.\nIn 2013–14, Maccabi Tel Aviv won its first ever championship and it was the first time in 12 years that the championship moved away from Rishon Lezion. In 2014–15, Hapoel Rishon won an historic double after defeating Maccabi Rishon in the finals of Ligat Winner and State Cup. One year later, it was Maccabi Tel Aviv who won the national championship.\nAdministration and structure.\nTeams.\nThere are currently 12 teams in Ligat Ha'Al, as of 2016–17 season:\nSeason.\n• A regular season of two rounds: 12 teams play in the league, competing in a double round-robin tournament. After the end of the regular season, the top 8 teams compete for the championship, with the top four teams being seeded.\n• Playoffs semi-final: The teams which won a best-of-three series in the quarter-finals will qualify to the semi-finals. The winner in the series between the 1st place and the 8th place play against the winner in the series between the 4th and the 5th places. The winner in the series between the 2nd and the 7th places, play against the winner of the series between the 3rd and 6th places. In case of a draw in one of the matches, the tie is decided on goal difference with a 10 minutes extra time being played if the goal difference is equal. The home-court advantage is always given to the team that is ranked higher in the table of the regular season.\n• Playoffs final: The final playoffs round is decided by a best-of-five series between the two semi-final winners. The higher-ranked team at the end of the regular season host the 1st, 3rd and 5th games of the series. A team wins three games is the national champion. If the two teams win in two games each, and the fifth games ends in a draw, the tie is decided on goal difference with a 10 minutes extra time being played if the goal difference is equal.\n• Relegations: The bottom 4 teams compete in a single round-robin tournament to avoid relegation, with the bottom club relegating to Liga Leumit and the 10th and 11th placed teams compete in promotion/relegation playoffs against the 2nd and 3rd placed teams from Liga Leumit.\nSponsorships.\nIn the 2000s the league was sponsored by Bank Yahav and called \"Ligat Bank Yahav\".

The inaugural edition had 32 types of crisp, with eight group winners qualifying for the quarter-finals, and the competition progressing further using a knockout system.

The second edition was expanded to include 48 types of crisp and three group stages before semi-finals and a final, and votes were cast using Twitter's new poll feature.\nResults.\n2012 World Cup of Crisps.\nDue to the lack of Twitter polls, no official numbers of votes were revealed in the first edition of the World Cup of Crisps.\nGroup stages.\nEntries in bold denote crisps that qualified for the knockout stages.\n2016 World Cup of Crisps.\nThe second edition began on Saturday 26 March and is set to conclude on Monday 28 March.

It is the inaugural Championship under its new format, that saw Belgium, Georgia, Germany, Romania, Russia and Spain compete for the title.\nThis year's edition of the Rugby Europe Championship also served as the 2019 Rugby World Cup qualifiers for the European region. The team with the best record across the 2017 and 2018 Championships qualifies as Europe 1. As Georgia have already secured qualification automatically, in the event of a Georgian win, the runner-up will take the Europe 1 qualification spot.\nIn respect of matters relating to the eligibility of players, following a full review of the evidence, including statements and submissions from World Rugby, Rugby Europe, Belgium, Romania, Spain and Russia, the independent committee found:\nBelgium had fielded one or more ineligible players on 7 occasions during the 2017 and 2018 Rugby Europe Championships (of which 6 matches related to Rugby World Cup 2019 qualifying) Romania has fielded one ineligible player on 8 occasions during the 2017 and 2018 Rugby Europe Championships (of which 6 matches related to Rugby World Cup 2019 qualifying)\nSpain had fielded one or more ineligible players on 9 occasions during the 2017 and 2018 Rugby Europe Championships (of which 8 matches related to Rugby World Cup 2019 qualifying)\nIn respect of the sanctions, pursuant to Regulation 18, the independent committee determined the following:\nThe deduction of 5 points for any match in which a union fielded an ineligible player (40-point deduction for Spain, and a 30-point deduction for both Belgium and Romania). Therefore, based on a re-modelling of the Rugby Europe Championship tables in the context of Rugby World Cup 2019 qualifying, Russia would qualify as Europe 1 into Pool A replacing Romania and Germany will replace Spain in the European play-off against Portugal. As the tournament for 2017 had been completed and issues of relegation had been decided in that year, the points deduction was not applied to the 2017 Rugby Europe tournament."

They lost in the NCAA National Championship game to North Carolina.\nPrevious season.\nThe Bulldogs team finished the 2015–16 season 28–8, 15–3 in WCC play to earn a share for the WCC regular season championship. They defeated Portland, BYU, and Saint Mary's to win the WCC tournament and earn the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament; the Bulldogs have sequentially earned a place in this tournament for the past 18 years. As a No. 11 seed, they defeated No. 6 seed Seton Hall and No. 3 seed Utah to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. There they lost to No. 10 seed and eventual Final Four participant Syracuse.\nPreseason.\nThe Bulldogs were picked to finish first in the WCC preseason poll. Przemek Karnowski and Josh Perkins were selected to the All-WCC preseason team.\nThe Bulldogs were ranked No. 14 in the preseason AP poll and No. 13 in the preseason Coaches Poll.\nSchedule and results.\nGonzaga's non-conference schedule included a matchup with Washington as well as neutral court games against Tennessee (in Nashville) and Arizona (in Los Angeles). The Zags were invited to play in the AdvoCare Invitational in Florida, where they ultimately played against Quinnipiac, Florida, and Iowa State. Gonzaga played 18 conference games (home-and-home) within a nine-week span, beginning on December 29, 2016. The Zags also played in and won the single-elimination WCC Tournament, which took place March 2–7, 2017 at Orleans Arena in Las Vegas. This year's tournament was the first under a new 3-year contract with that venue.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| WCC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| WCC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "Hungarian American Football League",
        "text": "The Hungarian Football League (HFL) is the top tier national American football competition in Hungary, organized by the Hungarian Federation of American Football (MAFSZ). The competition was formerly called Hungarian American Football League (MAFL) (), the top tier as MAFL Division I and the second tier as MAFL Division II; since 2012 the top tier is HFL, the 2nd tier is MAFSZ Division I and the 3rd tier is MAFSZ Division II.\nHistory.\nHungarian teams formed and began playing in the 1990's when the Budapest Cowboys and Budapest Lions played in lower level division leagues outside of Hungary. The Hungarian American Football League (MAFL) began in 2005 under the guidance of the Hungarian Federation of American Football (MAFSZ) with 4 teams (Budapest Wolves, Győr Sharks, Debrecen Gladiators, Nagykanizsa Demos. The game rules are the standard gridiron football (NCAA) rules. The first winner of the first Hungarian Bowl was the Wolves.\nIn the next 2 years, the Wolves participated only in the Austrian Football League 3rd tier. These 2 years the HFL was won by the Sharks. In 2006, eight teams participated. In 2007, the championship had been split into two divisions (6 teams at Division I and 9 at Division II).\nIn 2008, the Wolves returned, and they won 3 more championships undefeated. In 2009, 26 teams participated so Division III had been introduced (this year 5, 12, and 9 teams have been played in the three tiers). In 2010, they returned into the 2 tier format.\nIn 2011, MAFSZ restructured the championship format with the introduction of Hungarian Football League (HFL), which was intended to be an international competition with the top 4 Hungarian teams and 4 from abroad. Division I and Division II became the 2nd and 3rd tier competitions, which were played in the spring season. The HFL was scheduled as a fall season but only 3 teams were willing to participate, so in 2011, the Hungarian Bowl was canceled.\nIn 2012, the HFL finally started, and this year the Budapest Wolves suffered their first-ever defeat against a Hungarian team (against Budapest Hurricanes), but in the final, the Wolves defeated the Hurricanes. However, in 2013, the Hurricanes, in 2014 the Újbuda Rebels, and in 2015 the Bratislava Monarchs defeated the Wolves in the Hungarian Bowl. The 2015 season was the only one when a foreign team participated, and with the Monarchs' win, the official Hungarian champion was the HFL runners-up Wolves.\nIn 2016, the Miskolc Steelers became the first non-capital city team in HFL history to participate in the finals, and they won the trophy as well, becoming the 6th team to win HFL in the 6 years' HFL history. In 2017, the Cowbells won the trophy, being technically the 7th team to win the HFL, but as they are the successor of Újbuda Rebels, they are the first team to win 2 HFL trophies.\nChampionship Games.\nHungarian Bowl.\nThe Hungarian Bowl is the Championship Game of the Hungarian American Football League. Between 2005 and 2010 it was the final of the MAFL Division I. In 2011, the new top-tier championship HFL was postponed, no Hungarian Bowl took place, and the Fall Bowl was an unofficial championship. Since 2012, the Hungarian Bowl has been the final of the Hungarian Football League.\nPannon Bowl.\nThe Pannon Bowl is the MAFSZ's second-tier championship game that was first played in 2007.\nDuna Bowl.\nThe Duna Bowl is the third-tier championship game of the MAFSZ.\nBlue Bowl.\nIn 2006, the MAFSZ created the Blue Bowl, the national cup game."

The team played as the Miners in 1887, before jumping to the International League and playing as the Indians for the remainder of the season. In 1892, the name was revived again by a team in the Pennsylvania State League and until 1894. In 1895, the team played as the Scranton Coal Heavers. The third Scranton Miners team played in the Eastern League in 1896 and 1897. The Miners name was used again from 1899–1900 in the Atlantic League. The final incarnation of the Scranton team used the Miners' moniker from 1904–1953. The only exceptions were the years 1939–1943 and 1946–1951, when the team was known as the Scranton Red Sox. The 1946 Red Sox were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time.\nBaseball parks.\nFrom 1894 until 1939, the Scranton Miners played at various iterations of \"Brooks Athletic Field\" which also was known as \"Brooks Field\", \"Athletic Field\", and in 1935 as \"Sweeney's Field\" after James T. Sweeney bought the property. The ballpark was located on Providence Road in Scranton and also was utilized by the St. Thomas College of Scranton Football team.\nIn 1932 the team began playing their Sunday games at Crystal Gardens Stadium in Dickson City due to Blue Laws banning games from being played on the Sabbath. According to the May 17th 1932 article in the Hazleton Plain Speaker, Centerfield at the new Crystal Gardens Stadium was so large (788 feet) that anyone who could hit a home run out of the new ballpark would \"inherit the new stadium\". The Left Field fence was 315 feet. Right Field was 416 feet. \nIn 1940 a baseball stadium called \"Scranton Stadium\" aka \"Scranton Dunmore Stadium\" was built for the \"Scranton Red Sox\" who were often interchangeable with the \"Scranton Miners\" with the name going back and forth between the two from 1939 until 1954. The stadium existed for 14 years before it was demolished. It was located at 1350 Monroe Avenue in Dunmore Pennsylvania. "

        "title": "David Grace (basketball)",
        "text": "David Grace is an American basketball coach who has coached with a high degree of success at multiple levels such as D1 college, high school, and AAU, and is retired from the United States Air Force. He is currently the Head Coach at Campbell Hall School in Studio City, CA. He was previously Head Coach at Centennial HS in Peoria, AZ. At the D1 college level he was most recently the associate head coach for the Vanderbilt Commodores of the Southeastern Conference under former NBA great Jerry Stackhouse.\nMilitary career.\nGrace grew up in Aberdeen, Maryland, while his father Gerald worked long hours as a mechanic and his mother worked as a beautician. He began military life after his mother remarried a serviceman and then moved to a series of bases over the years. He joined the United States Air Force at age 18 and served for 20 years. For 16 years as a fuel specialist and accountant, Grace traveled between Air Force bases in Turkey, Germany, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Georgia, and Virginia before settling down in the Phoenix, Arizona area for the last few years of his enlistment.\nA decorated former technical sergeant who has seen combat in Operation Desert Storm, Grace is an active supporter of his fellow military veterans, especially those who have faced challenges after they have returned home from war zones, as shown in the UCLA video Coach Grace On Giving Thanks For Our Veterans. Jeff Eisenberg of Yahoo Sports said the importance of discipline, teamwork, and following the chain of command became ingrained in Grace, and three months in Saudi Arabia (during Operation Desert Storm) also taught him to appreciate the difference between the life-threatening pressure of a combat zone and the day-to-day challenges of a job.\nCoaching career.\nAAU.\nGrace began his youth coaching career in 1997 while he was stationed at Langley AFB, Virginia, when he started coaching with the Boo Williams Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) program in Hampton, Virginia. After leaving Langley, Grace was stationed at Luke AFB near Phoenix and coached two AAU teams and a high school team. \"I've been very proud of him seeing the progress he's made from the time he began here as an assistant coach at a high school to becoming an assistant coach at OSU (Oregon State University),\" said Ronald Goodwyn, 56th Fighter Wing equal opportunity director. \"He has taken the Air Force core values and tied them into his coaching to prepare the athletes to be successful even after their life in basketball.\"\nAfter relocating to Luke AFB in Arizona, he began coaching AAU teams with the Compton Magic. He also co-founded and coached the Arizona Magic AAU program in the Phoenix, Arizona area, as an affiliate of the Compton Magic, that made it to the Elite Eight (of 338 AAU teams) of the 2004 Reebok Big Time Tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada. That team that featured Philadelphia 76ers player Jerryd Bayless (Arizona), Kaleo Kina (Naval Academy), Darren Jordan (Oral Roberts), Ty Morrison (Creighton/Grand Canyon), and former Stanford All-Conference selection and European League professional Lawrence Hill (Le Havre, France). They finished the AAU season ranked 21st in the nation and were the highest ranked team ever from Arizona up until that time.\nHigh school.\nGrace began his high school coaching career at Trevor Browne High School in Phoenix while at Luke AFB, and then retired and moved into coaching and teaching full-time. As an assistant varsity coach he helped lead Trevor Browne to a State Final Four and the team finished ranked in the Top 40 in the nation by the Sporting News. Grace began working toward becoming a full-time HS teacher and taught business and computer skills. He then became head coach at South Mountain High School in Phoenix, Arizona, for the 2004–05 season and won the 2005-06 Division 5A-2 State Championship with a win/loss record of 29–4, and was the Arizona Varsity (Rivals.com) and Arizona Informant Coach of the Year.\nCollege.\nGrace started his college coaching career at California State University, Sacramento in 2006 as an assistant coach to head coach Jerome Jenkins, after receiving a recommendation from University of Arizona coach Lute Olson. Grace's first major recruit there was 2006-07 Big Sky Freshman of the Year Vinnie McGhee from Oakland's McClymonds High School.\nAfter one year in Sacramento, Grace then became an assistant coach at the University of San Francisco in 2007-08 under head coach Jessie Evans, who had been an assistant coach under Lute Olson on his 1996-97 Arizona Wildcats men's basketball National Championship team.\nGrace was hired as an assistant coach of the Oregon State Beavers men's basketball team in 2008–09 by head coach Craig Robinson, the older brother of U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama, and served there through the 2012–13 season. His first major Beaver recruit was All-Conference Team selection Roberto Nelson, who became the 2012-13 Pac-12 Conference scoring champion (20.7 points per game), and was a European pro in Italy (Trieste).\nUCLA.\nIn 2016 Grace was ranked #7 nationally and #1 in the West by ESPN for the best recruiters based on feedback from a D1 coaching peer survey by ESPN. \" On March 24, 2018 long time Tucson sports columnist Greg Hansen, in referring to rejuvenating the Arizona Wildcat program after their first round NCAA exit, asked in his column \"Is (Sean) Miller willing to pursue someone like UCLA's David Grace, who, in my opinion, is the league's most feared recruiter and top assistant coach?\"\nGrace completed 11 years of coaching in the Pac-12 Conference where he was one of the longest tenured coaches. Until 2018, he was an assistant coach at UCLA under head coach Steve Alford, his fifth season with the Bruins who had 117 wins during his time there. Three of Grace's first four seasons at UCLA ended with Sweet 16 appearances in the NCAA Tournament.\nESPN ranked the 2018 Bruin recruiting class number two in the nation behind only Duke. \"With this current class, it's fairly clear that UCLA has re-established itself as one of the premier recruiting schools in the country. Given the Bruins' history, that shouldn't be news -- but they have now landed nine ESPN 100 prospects in the last two recruiting classes, on the heels of two five-star prospects and three one-and-done prospects from the 2016 class.\"\n\"David has been tremendous,\" Alford said. \"I've been fortunate in my 23 years to not just hire people who understand basketball but who are also really good people, and that's what David is. He's a great guy and he's a tireless worker. He's always on the phone calling or texting recruits.\"\nThe 2016–17 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team included new recruits Lonzo Ball (the Naismith National Prep Player of the Year), T. J. Leaf, and Ike Anigbogu, and was rated the fifth best recruiting class in the nation by ESPN. Grace had recruited Ball prior to Alford arriving at UCLA. \"They went up the court about four times, then stopped,\" Grace recalled. \"I walked over to his head coach and said [Lonzo] has a scholarship offer from Oregon State. I knew he was that good.\" After his freshman season with UCLA Ball was voted consensus first team All-American (USBWA, NABC, and Sporting News) and won the Wayman Tisdale Award as the top freshman in America. T. J. Leaf led UCLA in scoring at 16.3 ppg and was voted First Team All-Pac-12 Conference.\nColumnist Clay Fowler of the Orange County Register wrote that these Bruins tied a program record with 28 regular season wins (31–5 overall, 15-3 Conference) and spent nearly half the season in the top five of the AP poll, rising as high as No. 2. UCLA finished its season as the highest-scoring team in the country (89.8 points per game), the nation's leader in field-goal percentage (52.2), assists per game (21.4) and assist-to-turnover ratio (1.91). The Bruins’ peaked with a road victory at Arizona on Feb. 25 that earned UCLA the distinction as the only team to ever win games in Kentucky and Arizona's home arenas in the same season.\nBall and Leaf both declared for the NBA draft after the conclusion of the 2016–17 season and were drafted in the first round along with Ike Anigbogu in the second round.\nShortly before the Final Four of the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Grace was informed that he would not be retained by UCLA, being replaced by Murry Bartow.\nCalifornia.\nHe was then hired by Wyking Jones to be an assistant coach for the California Golden Bears men's basketball team in April 2018. Jones had previously worked for Steve Alford at the University of New Mexico racking up 52 wins in two years before heading to Louisville under Rick Pitino where they won the NCAA D1 National Championship in 2013. On October 1, 2018, Grace landed Joel Brown as a Cal commit, the number 4 ranked player in Canada (from Toronto), and the number 12 ranked PG in the class of 2019 according to 247Sports. https://www.zagsblog.com/2018/10/02/joel-brown-to-cal/\nVanderbilt.\nOn April 16, 2019, Grace was hired by Jerry Stackhouse to be the associate head coach for the Vanderbilt Commodores. Stackhouse, an 18-year NBA player, was signed to a six-year deal by new AD Malcolm Turner, after serving as an assistant coach with the Memphis Grizzlies and Toronto Raptors and had also been the NBA G League Coach of the Year for the Raptors 905. Turner became Vanderbilt's Vice Chancellor and AD shortly before hiring Stackhouse who he had worked with previously as president of the NBA G League. \"If you ask Coach Stackhouse, he'll give credit where it's due, labeling Grace as an 'unbelievable, tireless recruiter.' But that just scratches the surface. He reiterates Grace's message; he understands that his associate head coach is far more than just a recruiter. “He recruited a couple of my kids, Brandon Ingram in particular... We formed a relationship, and he had a reputation as a great coach, a great person and a great recruiter. David will get us talent, but he's so much more than that. He'll still show off what he is: a really good basketball coach.”\nVanderbilt's first recruit under Stackhouse and Grace was Scotty Pippen Jr. of Sierra Canyon HS in California, son of NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls who won six NBA championships led by Michael Jordan. He re-committed in late April 2019. http://www.espn.co.uk/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/26604899/vanderbilt-signs-pippen-jr-son-hall-famer. Their second commit was 6'6\" Kenyon Martin Jr., son of 15 year NBA player Kenyon Martin, who teamed up with Scotty Pippen Jr. at Sierra Canyon HS to go 32-3 and win the California State Championship Open Division in 2019. However, Martin decided to pursue a pro career abroad instead of attending college.\nAfter only one season on the recruiting circuit Grace was named by his fellow college basketball coaches as the number one recruiter in the Southeast after having been ranked number one on the West Coast for several years while he was at UCLA. On February 5, 2020, Vanderbilt broke its record setting SEC consecutive game losing streak (26) begun the previous season under the previous head coach and beat 18th ranked LSU 99–90 in Nashville by shooting 57% from the field and scoring more points that it has in any game in the last eight years. Though down to six scholarship players due to injuries, including the loss of the SEC's leading scorer and shooter, Aaron Nesmith, Vanderbilt won back to back SEC games over Alabama (away) and South Carolina (home) to end the regular season. \"The Commodores have upset LSU (then No. 18), Alabama and the Gamecocks. They also suffered five hard-fought losses by single-digit margins to No. 6 Kentucky, Florida, Tennessee, Georgia and Missouri.\".\nIn April 2020 Sports illustrated reported that Grace was one of the top 50 most impactful coaches in the country at the high D1 level joining 10 other SEC assistant coaches. In May 2020 it was reported that Coach David Grace and Special Advisor Ricardo Patton were no longer with Vanderbilt.\n2021 NCAA Final Four, NBA, and other pro players.\nGrace recruited five of the top eight rotation players for the UCLA Bruins 2021 Final Four team, who are also #2 in ESPN's 2021-2022 rankings. His other former recruits (commits) and players who have played in the NBA as of 2022 include Jordan Adams, Lou Amundsen, Kyle Anderson, Ike Anigbogu, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Jerryd Bayless, Jonah Bolden, Jared Cunningham, Aaron Holiday, Zach LaVine, T. J. Leaf, Saben Lee, Kevon Looney, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Moreland, Aaron Nesmith, Norman Powell, Travis Wear, Thomas Welsh, Chris Smith, Jules Bernard, and Scotty Pippen Jr. Five of these players were NBA Lottery picks in the Ball brothers, Bayless, LaVine, and Nesmith. Scotty Pippen Jr. of Vanderbilt was All-SEC and nominated for the Lute Olson National Player of the Year Award for 2022 as a junior.\nLaVine and Lamelo Ball were selected to play in the 2022 NBA All Star Game. LaVine was also selected to play in the 2021 NBA All-Star Game as well as for Team USA in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. LaMelo Ball was voted the 2021 NBA Rookie of the Year with the Charlotte Hornets. In 2022 Lonzo Ball and LaVine were both starting for the Chicago Bulls who at 38-21 were currently tied for first in the Eastern Conference and had been rejuvenated, in part, due to Ball's passing at the point guard position, according to Grace. \"The year before Lonzo gets to UCLA we weren’t very good. He comes in and changes the whole culture with the pass. ...We ran basically the same plays from the year before and it just goes to show you what can happen when you bring a person in and he cares more about his teammates and about passing the basketball. That’s what I think is happening now with the Bulls.”\n2022 Return To Head Coaching.\nIn 2022 Grace accepted the position of Head Coach at legendary athletic powerhouse Centennial High School in Peoria, AZ. At 18-10 and ranked the #5 seed in their 5A division Grace led his squad back to the Final Four in the state playoffs. It is Grace's most recent trip to the State Final Four since his Phoenix South Mountain team won the 5A state championship in 2006. Centennial lost by one point to #1 seed Campo Verde in an away game to finish the season.\nIn the seventeen years between AZ HS Final Fours he served as a D1 level Assistant Coach and Associate head coach in the Big Sky, WCC, Pac 12, and the SEC athletic conferences. He co-led those teams to multiple NCAA and CBI tournaments, winning a Pac 12 Championship, and reaching as high as a #2 national ranking for the UCLA Bruins behind current NBA star Lonzo Ball.\nIn 2023 Coach Grace accepted the position of Head Coach at Studio City powerhouse Campbell Hall School in Los Angeles, CA, where he will be coaching the sons of NBA greats such as Rip Hamilton. Campbell Hall was the home of the Holiday brothers, Justin, Jrue, and Aaron, all currently in the NBA. Aaron Holiday played for Coach Grace at UCLA.\nIn his first season with Campbell Hall he led the varsity squad to the CIF Southern Section 2AA Championship Quarterfinals where they lost in an away game at St. Anthony's 91–86. No Campbell Hall boy's basketball team has ever made it that far at the 2AA level, which is the second highest level in California.\nPersonal life.\nGrace grew up in Aberdeen, Maryland and played basketball and baseball at Aberdeen High School. He is of Irish and Native American descent (Eastern Cherokee) and has worked with the Nike N7 program for several years to honor Native Americans. He earned a bachelor's of science degree in management (human resources) from Park University, and degrees in logistics and social services from the Air Force. He and his wife, Crystal, have six grown children: Troy, Terrell, Tierra, David II, Aubrey, and Andre, as well as godson Mekai Roquemore. Grace's father Gerald was a high school basketball referee and baseball umpire in Maryland for 35 years, and his brother Jason coaches lacrosse at the NCAA level."

        "title": "Jim Parker (rugby union)",
        "text": "James Hislop Parker (1 February 1897 – 11 September 1980) was a New Zealand soldier, sportsman and businessman. He achieved distinction as a sprinter before representing his country at rugby union, including as a member of so-called \"Invincibles\" team of 1924–25. He was a decorated World War I veteran, and had a business career that included service as chairman of the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board.\nEarly life and family.\nParker was born in Lyttelton on 1 February 1897. He was the son of Nimrod Parker (1866–1930) and Jane Kerr Hislop (1871–1954), and the grandson of Joseph Parker (1842–1918) who, in 1859, had left Welburn, Yorkshire, initially for the Victorian goldfields, and then for those in Otago, New Zealand.\nOn 21 June 1924, Parker married Elizabeth Mary Westropp Twemlow (1900–1969) at St Andrew's Church, Christchurch, with Read Masters performing the duties as best man. The couple went on to have one son, Jimmy Frederick Parker (1935–1995).\nWar service.\nDuring World War I, Parker served with the ANZAC Mounted Division in the Palestine Campaign.\nIn August 1916, Parker joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and, in January 1917, sailed to Suez, Egypt on the Waihora. A diary he kept during this period gives accounts of the fighting, raids by Taube monoplanes, sports and social activity. In January 1918, Parker was with the New Zealand Mounted Machinegun Squadron at Ashdod, Palestine.\nBy 23 March 1918, Parker's squadron began to engage Turkish Forces in the Jordan Valley. He wrote in his diary:\nOn 29 March 1918, the squadron was at Amman and Parker wrote, “our section in trouble”. He then detailed several casualties amongst his comrades and that a Turkish shell had landed amongst the New Zealand horses, killing ten and wounding four. The following day, Parker wrote:\nParker was one of the many troopers who contracted malaria. He was in Cairo when the war ended. He recorded the occasion in his diary:\nAwarded the Military Medal for bravery in the field, Parker returned to New Zealand on the transport HMT \"Ulimaroa\" and was discharged in August 1919.\nSporting career.\nAthletics.\nParker was trained by his father, Nimrod Parker, who had been regarded as one of the best all round athletes in New Zealand. Jim Parker became the 1919–20 Canterbury amateur champion in the 100 yard and 220 yard sprints, and then as a professional, held the New Zealand record for the 75 yard sprint. The Wellington centre of the New Zealand Amateur Athletic Association supported Parker's reinstatement as an amateur in 1931.\nRugby union.\nPlayer.\nEducated at Christchurch Boys' High School, Parker played rugby union there, and during 1915 and 1916 he was a member of the Christchurch Old Boys club. During his war service in the Middle East, he played for the New Zealand Machinegun Squadron team, which also included players such as Jock Richardson, and Cyril and Maurice Brownlie. Following the war, he first represented the provincial team in 1920, playing both as a loose forward and wing three-quarter.\nOwing to work pressures and the malaria that he had contracted during the war, Parker did not appear for Canterbury again until the 1923 season, when he played in six matches. The following year he played in the All Black trials and in the inter-island match for the South Island, and he made his debut for the national team on the short tour of New South Wales.\nParker was then selected for the All Blacks' 1924–25 tour of Britain, Ireland, France and Canada. On that tour Parker, playing as a wing-forward, appeared in 18 matches including three internationals. His skills were compared by critics with those of George Gillett from the early 1900s: \"Parker was the Gillett type—a born rover, like lightning off the mark, with good hands, and a genius for flashing into an opening.\" Team captain and one of the selectors, Cliff Porter, was later praised for his sportsmanship in standing himself down in favour of Parker during test matches: \"Parker's remarkable speed ... allowed him to appear more in the role of a stand-off half and at the same time carry on with his winging game.\"\nCoach and administrator.\nBack in New Zealand in 1925, recurring bouts of malaria and ongoing work commitments curtailed Parker's playing career, and he retired after a few club matches that season. However, he continued in a coaching role and was credited at the end of the 1939 season for much of the improvement shown by the Victoria College Football Club in Wellington.\nParker was a member of the executive committee of the New Zealand Rugby Union from 1939 to 1956, and was the All Blacks' manager on their controversial tour of South Africa in 1949. New Zealand acquiesced to the apartheid policies of South Africa and sent a European-only team. Parker would have been aware that his former teammate, George Nēpia, had already experienced South Africa's racism and had drifted off to play rugby league. As a silent protest, the All Blacks did not perform the tradition pre-game haka. Parker stated that, \"the war cry is a creation of the Maoris and as we have no Maoris with us we are not giving the war cry.\"\nIn 1959 Parker was elected a life member of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union.\nOrchard and business career.\nParker had an orchard of , mainly of apples but with some peaches and nectarines, at Loburn in North Canterbury, but left the area in 1929. He became the Nelson manager of the New Zealand Fruitgrowers' Federation (NZFF), and moved to Wellington in 1934 when he was appointed assistant manager at the NZFF head office. By 1945 he was the NZFF general manager.\nIn 1955, Parker was appointed chairman of the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board, and served in that capacity until about 1964. In the 1964 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to the fruit industry."

        "text": "Greece became an IIHF member in 1987 and participated in five IIHF tournaments from 1991 to 1999. \nHistory.\nGreek hockey teams were found by Ahepa in the USA at the beginning of the 20th century, in Greece itself the sport started in the 1980s with players from abroad. Since 1999 there is no more any rink in olympic size due to lack of funds. \nThe 2007-08 season saw the return of hockey when a small, temporary rink was built in Athens. The following season saw an ice rink built into a disused wrestling arena built for the 2004 Summer Olympics but when the financial crisis hit the rink was closed down. Ice sports are now limited to smaller rinks. There are two rinks in Athens and another in Thessaloniki. Often teams have to play early morning or late at night due to the fact that the rinks are mostly used for public skating.\nThe Greek Ice Hockey Championship is the only level of ice hockey in Greece. It is operated under the jurisdiction of the Greek Ice Sport Federation, a member of the IIHF."

As the leading USA rider in the Rolex Kentucky Three Day Event CCI, she won the Pinnacle Cup Trophy in 2014 and again in 2016, both times riding the Dutch Warmblood mare Veronica with whom she has been paired since 2013. Nicholson was a member of the gold medal-winning US eventing team at the 2015 Pan American Games, riding Meadowbrook's Scarlett.\nNicholson comes from a \"non-horsey\" family, the only daughter of a diesel mechanic and an accountant. She began riding lessons at age six, and began competing in eventing at age 12. She is closely associated with champion equestrians and trainers David and Karen O'Connor, with whom she has served a working apprenticeship since her late teens.\nAs of April 2016, Nicholson was the world's ninth-ranked eventing equestrian according to the Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI), and at the time of the 2016 Summer Olympics in which Nicholson competed, was considered the top-ranked female eventing athlete\nin the United States.\nIn 2019, Nicholson was placed in the top 10 in the Burghley Horse Trials 5* aboard the American-bred Anglo-Arabian Vermiculus, the top placing among the contingent of riders from the United States. Vermiculus is a full brother to her 2010 Kentucky Three-Day Event horse Snooze Alarm. In discussing the training of Vermiculus, Nicholson has said, \"You have to be very conscientious producing them[Anglo-Arabs], because they’re very, very smart.\""

The race was held on May 21, 2016, and was scheduled to be run at 6:45 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) and was televised on NBC. Exaggerator won the race, while 2016 Kentucky Derby winner Nyquist finished third. The Maryland Jockey Club reported a track record total attendance of 135,256, the second highest attendance for American thoroughbred racing events in North America during 2016.\nField.\nAfter the running of the Kentucky Derby connections of the winner Nyquist sent the horse to Pimlico on 9 May. Other runners from the Derby included second placed Exaggerator, who arrived at Pimlico on May 15, and 9th placed Lani. Of the other 17 Derby contenders, Gun Runner remained under consideration until Tuesday of Preakness week, then his trainer decided to rest him and train for races later in the summer instead. Derby contenders Brody's Cause and Suddenbreakingnews were set to skip the Preakness and point to the 2016 Belmont Stakes.\nA total of eight new horses who did not contest the Derby were pointed at the Preakness. Awesome Speed, who won the Federico Tesio Stakes at Laurel Park, earned an automatic entry to the Preakness. Other new contenders included Cherry Wine and Laoban, both Derby also-eligibles who were not able to start in the Kentucky race. Of the horses who had not been on the Kentucky Derby trail, Stradivari, a lightly-raced colt trained by Todd Pletcher, Collected, a Bob Baffert-trainee who won the Lexington Stakes, and Uncle Lino, a west coast horse who won the inaugural California Chrome Stakes drew press interest. Abiding Star was in question for a time, as he was stabled at Parx Racing, which was under a quarantine due to an outbreak of EHV-1 at that track. However, the quarantine was lifted on May 17, allowing him to ship to Pimlico and enter the race.\nThe draw for the race was held at 5:30 pm (EDT) on May 18 and Nyqist was installed as the 3-5 morning line favorite.\nRace.\nOn a rainy day, the race went off at 6:52 PM, EST. In spite of the weather, attendance was a record-breaking 135,256, beating the previous year's record of 131,680. The pari-mutuel take of $94,127,434 for the entire day's races also broke the previous record of $91,028,000 in 2005.\nOn a sloppy but sealed track, Nyquist fell prey to a blistering early pace set by Uncle Lino. He led briefly at the 1/2 mile pole, but by the stretch he faded, and Exaggerator won by lengths. The second-place finisher, Cherry Wine, had hit his head on the starting gate and was second-to-last for much of the race but saved ground on the rail and rallied in the stretch to take second place over Nyquist by a nose, thus destroying any chance for the first back-to-back Triple Crown winners since 1977–78.\nPayout.\nThe 141st Preakness payout schedule"

        "title": "Midland Sailing Club",
        "text": "Midland Sailing Club is an amateur sailing club, based at Birmingham in England. It is situated on Edgbaston Reservoir in the centre of Birmingham. The club was founded in 1894.\nIt is an open sailing club for men, women, adults, and children of all abilities. The club actively tries to improve the diversity of the sailing population by engaging with the local community\nMidland Sailing Club is an RYA training centre, and courses for both beginners and more advanced sailors are run at regular intervals. Since 2019 this is done through SailBirmingham, an initiative to increase community engagement through watersports. Apart from regular junior training courses and RYA OnBoard sessions, this also includes Stand up paddleboarding.\nMembers of the club take part both in the regular club races on Saturday afternoons and Wednesday evenings (during the summer months), and also in Open meetings across the country. The club regularly sends teams to the Southport 24 Hour Race.\nBurgee.\nThe club burgee is the Swiss flag. This is a reference to the fact that the club was one of the earliest sailing clubs in England which is landlocked, so that it was jokingly compared to the Swiss navy. A letter from the Swiss embassy exists which allows the club to use the white cross on red background as its burgee.\nHistory.\nMidland Sailing Club was founded on 11 June 1894. Initially, boats hired from Salters of Oxford were used in racing, before the club in 1896 ordered seven boats from Mr Henry Holford of Gloucester.\nThere were three branches at the beginning, Edgbaston (sailing on Edgbaston Reservoir), Norton (sailing on \"Norton Pool\"), and Barnt Green (sailing on Upper Bittell Reservoir). This was partly due to lack of effective transport to sail at a central location at the time. The Edgbaston branch was the only one with a record of uninterrupted racing seasons from its foundation until the outbreak of the First World War.\nDuring the war, racing was suspended, and the boats moored at the Norton branch were used as target practice by miners stationed there, who used to throw rocks into them until they sunk, effectively ending sailing there. As there was also no sailing at Barnt Green (until the foundation of Barnt Green Sailing Club in 1918), Midland Sailing Club decided at the AGM in February of 1919 to drop the \"Edgbaston Branch\" designation and continue as \"Midland Sailing Club\" from then onwards."

        "title": "Development Basketball League",
        "text": "Developmental Basketball League (DBL), previously named Deteksi Basketball League, is the largest basketball league competition for middle school and high school students in Indonesia. This league started in 2004 in Surabaya when it was still under the auspices of DetEksi, the youth department of the \"Jawa Pos\" newspaper, and was initiated by the then head of \"DetEksi\", .\nSince 2008, this basketball league has been managed professionally. \"Jawa Pos\" established a separate subsidiary to manage the basketball league, namely PT. Deteksi Basket Lintas Indonesia or better known as PT. DBL Indonesia.\nSince 2018, DBL Indonesia has become an independent company that is no longer under the umbrella of \"Jawa Pos\". Until now, is still listed as the founder and CEO of PT DBL Indonesia.\nHistory.\n2004–2007: Humble beginning.\nDBL started in Surabaya in 2004. This league was intended as a simple high school league, but was organized in the right way. No professional or semipro players, no cigarette, alcohol or energy drink sponsors. Players must be student-athletes. Their performance in the classroom is just as important—or even more important—than their performance on the basketball court.\nA total of 96 teams joined in this first season, from various cities in East Java Province. Since the first game, many people were aware that something special was happening. The first DBL match was very tight and emotional. The women's team at defeated SMA Santo Stanislaus 2 Surabaya. Tears of sadness and happiness were seen all around the field, watched by around 1,000 spectators. That year, the number of spectators was extraordinary for a high school level basketball competition.\nSince then, more and more fans have come to watch. In the final round, more than 5,000 people came to watch (the record for the largest basketball audience in East Java at that time), and they were entertained by an emotional and dramatic match. became the men's champion, after forcing extra time with a desperate shot from outside the three-point line.\nThe success of the first DBL season helped the league to grow significantly. The more teams that join, the more spectators will watch. In fact, there were so many teams wanting to appear, DBL ran out of capacity to accept them all. Therefore, new participants must appear first in the qualifying round, eliminating each other towards the main round.\nAs the years go by, the standard of implementation also continues to increase. New rules were introduced to make the presentation of the match even better. Teams and spectators continue to be forced to follow increasingly strict rules.\nIn 2007, DBL matches were held as well as—or perhaps better—than professional and international matches. More than 55 thousand spectators watched DBL in 2007, almost four times as many as in 2004. A total of 220 teams competed in 2007, more than twice the number of participants in 2004. It was the last year where DBL was held as a regional league in the province of East Java.\nThe success of 2007 gave a sign that the time had come for DBL to spread its wings not just in East Java, but in other regions across Indonesia which began in 2008.\n2008–present: League expansion and evolution.\n2008: \"DBL Movement\".\nDBL established itself as the biggest basketball league in Indonesia in 2008. In that year, DBL started a new point to be handled more professionally with the formation of PT. Indonesian Cross Basketball Detection (DBL). The name of the Detective Basketball League evolved into the Developmental Basketball League.\nUnder the motto \"DBL Movement\", the league expanded its reach beyond East Java to ten provinces with the help of Astra Honda Motor. To meet the demands of the number of participants, in East Java DBL is divided into two regions: North Region in Surabaya, South Region in Malang. Nine other new cities were spread across nine provinces, on five islands in Indonesia. Like in Surabaya, DBL received a warm welcome in other provinces. DBL was able to break participant and audience records. For example, in the cultural city of Jogjakarta, more than 16,500 people watched DBL in just six days. A figure that has never before been achieved for a basketball event.\nAlong with expanding its territory, DBL also made history through two international collaborations. The first is a long-term partnership with the world's most prestigious basketball league: the NBA. Every year, the NBA will send its players and coaches to help develop the top DBL players and coaches. The first official NBA event in Indonesia was held in Surabaya, 23–24 August 2008. The star was Danny Granger, top scorer for the Indiana Pacers.\nThe second international collaboration is with the Australian government. In October 2008, the DBL sent its first All-Star teams (men's and women's) to Perth, to study and compete against selected youth teams from Western Australia.\nAs a complement, in 2008 DBL also opened its new basketball building, DBL Arena. The building was built in just seven months. One of the best buildings in Indonesia, it has a capacity of 5,000 spectators.\n2009–present: Continuous growth.\nDBL continues to grow every year. The new point was marked by the formation of PT DBL Indonesia so that this league could continue to run sustainably. In 2018, this league was implemented consistently in 30 cities and 22 provinces in Indonesia. From Aceh to Papua. In each match, the number of spectators present in the arena ranges from 3,000 - 10,000 people.\nThat year, the number of basketball players competing in the DBL was recorded at more than 35,000 people. They come from 850 schools spread across 195 cities and districts. The number of matches in that season reached more than 1,350 matches.\nIn total, DBL league participants grew to reach 1.2 million people. In Indonesia, there is no student-level sports league that is able to involve as many young people as DBL Indonesia does.\nAppreciation from the President of the Republic of Indonesia.\nThis achievement was recognized by the 7th President of the Republic of Indonesia Ir. H. Joko Widodo. Because of this achievement, President Joko Widodo invited the best DBL league players to the Bogor State Palace to play basketball with him and a number of State Ministers.\nList of defending champions of the DBL competition in each province.\nSumber:\nList of winners of the most DBL competitions in each province.\nThe following is a list of schools in each province that have won the DBL most often in each province for the 2004–2019 season.\nSumber:\nDBL All-Star (Boys).\n2022 KFC DBL All-Star Chicago.\n\"Coaches\":\n2019 Honda DBL All-Star California.\n\"Coaches\":\n2018 Honda DBL All-Star California.\n\"Coaches\":\n2017 Honda DBL All-Star Los Angeles.\n\"Coaches\":\n2016 Honda DBL All-Star San Francisco.\n\"Coaches\":\n2015 Honda DBL All-Star California.\n\"Coaches\":\n2014 Honda DBL All-Star California.\n\"Coaches\":\n2013 DBL All-Star San Francisco.\n\"Coaches\":\n2012 DBL All-Star Seattle.\n\"Coaches\":\nDBL All-Star (Girls).\n2022 DBL All-Star Chicago.\n\"Coaches\":\nLoop 3x3 Basketball.\nBoys\nGirls"

There were 12 boats (36 competitors) from 12 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. It was twice the highest number of boats that had previously competed in an Olympic tournament (6 boats in 1928). The event was won by the German team, rowers Gerhard Gustmann and Herbert Adamski and coxswain Dieter Arend, in the nation's debut in the event. Italy earned its first medal in the event since 1924 with silver by Almiro Bergamo, Guido Santin, and cox Luciano Negrini. France extended its podium streak to three Games with bronze by Marceau Fourcade, Georges Tapie, and cox Noël Vandernotte.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nFive of the 12 competitors from the 1932 coxed pair event returned: Poland's silver medal team, Jerzy Braun, Janusz Ślązak, and cox Jerzy Skolimowski; and two members of Brazil's fourth-place boat, José Ramalho and cox Estevam Strata.\nDenmark, Germany, Hungary, Japan, and Yugoslavia each made their debut in the event. France made its sixth appearance, the only nation to have competed in all editions of the event to that point. Belgium was the only nation to have competed previously but not in 1936.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The tournament featured three rounds: semifinals, a repechage, and a final. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. The competition introduced the 6-boat heat.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe first boat of each heat qualified for the final; the remainder went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe first two in each heat qualified for the final."

        "text": "Ian Theodore Anderson (born May 2, 1998) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB). Anderson was selected out of high school by the Braves with the third overall pick of the 2016 MLB draft. He made his major league debut in 2020. Anderson won a World Series ring in 2021 as a member of the Atlanta Braves.\nAmateur baseball.\nAnderson played in the 2013 14-and-under Babe Ruth League World Series in Moses Lake, Washington, with his team from Clifton Park, New York. Anderson's team finished third, and he was named to the all-defensive team as a pitcher. The squad was managed by Tom Huerter, father of teammate and future NBA player Kevin Huerter.\nAnderson attended Shenendehowa High School in Clifton Park, New York. As a junior, he was 6–1 with a 0.66 earned run average (ERA) and 91 strikeouts. In August 2015, he played in Perfect Game All-American Classic at Petco Park. That same summer, he played for the 18U National Team that won the World Cup. In 2016, he helped lead Shenendehowa to a Class AA state championship. \nAnderson graduated from Shenendehowa in 2016. He committed to play college baseball at Vanderbilt.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nAnderson was considered one of the top prospects in the 2016 MLB draft. To induce Anderson to forgo college baseball, the Atlanta Braves selected him with the third overall pick in the 2016 draft and signed him for $4 million.\nAnderson made his professional debut with the GCL Braves and was promoted to the Danville Braves on August 6, 2016. He finished the 2016 season with a combined 1–2 record and 2.04 ERA in ten starts between both teams. In 2017, he played with the Rome Braves where he went 4–5 with a 3.14 ERA in 20 starts. He began 2018 with the Florida Fire Frogs and was promoted to the Mississippi Braves on August 8. In 24 starts between the two clubs, he was 4–7 with a 2.49 ERA. \nAnderson was invited to spring training before the 2019 season began, and returned to Mississippi to start the year. At midseason, he was selected as a Southern League All-Star, then subsequently named to the 2019 All-Star Futures Game. On August 5, Anderson was promoted to the Gwinnett Stripers, and made his International League debut the next day. At the end of the season, Anderson won the Braves' organizational pitcher of the year award.\nAtlanta Braves.\nAnderson was invited to spring training in 2020. Following the cancellation of the 2020 Minor League Baseball season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Atlanta Braves placed Anderson on its initial list of up to 60 players eligible to play for the team during the shortened Major League Baseball season. On August 26, 2020, Anderson was promoted to the major leagues for the first time, and his contract was selected to the active roster. He debuted in the first game of a doubleheader against the New York Yankees, going through the first innings without yielding a hit. Anderson completed six innings, giving up one earned run on a home run by Luke Voit. \nAnderson finished the 2020 season with a 3–2 record over 6 games started and 32 innings, posting a 1.95 ERA with 41 strikeouts, while giving up just 21 hits. He was fifth in the NL with 4 wild pitches. He relied mostly on his 95 mph fourseam fastball, 88 mph changeup, and 80 mph curveball, and only rarely threw a 92 mph sinker. Anderson received a single vote in National League Rookie of the Year voting, tying him for seventh place with Andrés Giménez and Sixto Sánchez.\nOn October 1, 2020, making his first postseason appearance, Anderson earned the win against the Cincinnati Reds, clinching the Wild Card Series for the Braves. He became the youngest pitcher in MLB postseason history to allow fewer than three hits while striking out nine while pitching at least six innings. In the NLDS game on October 7, Anderson threw 5.2 innings and got 9 strikeouts as the Braves beat the Miami Marlins 2–0.\nIn 2021, Anderson was 9–5 with a 3.58 ERA in 24 starts. He won a World Series ring as a member of the 2021 Atlanta Braves. Anderson became the 2nd person in World Series history to leave a game after throwing five no-hit innings, accomplished during the 2021 World Series, in Game 3, striking out four Houston Astros batters and earning the win in the Braves' 2–0 victory. That year, he finished fifth in the 2021 Rookie of the Year voting.\nAnderson struggled throughout the 2022 season, starting 21 games, and pitching to a 9–6 record, alongside a 5.11 ERA, until he was demoted to the Gwinnett Stripers on August 7. He issued an MLB-leading 53 walks up to that point in the season.\nIn 2023, after impressive spring training performances from Jared Shuster and Dylan Dodd, Anderson was optioned to Triple-A Gwinnett to begin the regular season. On April 11, 2023, it was announced that Anderson would undergo Tommy John surgery and miss the entire 2023 season.\nAnderson was optioned to Gwinnett to begin the 2024 season as he continued his recovery from surgery.\nScouting report.\nAs a prospect, Anderson's pitches included a mid-90s 4-seam and 2-seam fastball, plus curveball, and developing changeup. Anderson throws a 12–6 curveball with a low spin rate. In the minors, Anderson used his curveball more frequently against right-handed batters. By the time he reached the major leagues, Anderson's changeup had improved markedly. His arm angle has stood out to teammates, as it is higher than that of most pitchers.\nPersonal life.\nIan Anderson's identical twin brother, Ben Anderson, also played baseball for Shenendehowa and was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 26th round of the 2016 MLB Draft. Ben opted to attend Binghamton University, where he played baseball for three seasons before being drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 13th round of the 2019 Major League Baseball draft. Anderson also has a younger brother named Isaac.\nHis father, Bob Anderson, played college baseball at Siena and won multiple New York State championships as a coach at Schalmont High School."

He won 13 caps for Wales and was also selected to play for invitational touring club the Barbarians.\nPersonal history.\nRoberts was born in Toxteth, Liverpool in 1906. He was educated at Cardiff High School for Boys before matriculating to Cambridge University. Upon leaving university he was ordained into the ministry of the Presbyterian Church. In 1932 he travelled to Amoy in China to undertake missionary work. On returning to Britain he was appointed minister of at Otterburn, Northumberland.\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, Roberts served as a lieutenant of the Home Guard in the Otterburn area. He also served in the Royal Observer Corps. 1951 he took up a new post moving to Southdean in the borders of Scotland. Roberts was a former moderator of the Hawick Presbytery and the industrial chaplain to the Scottish knit-wear firm Lyle &amp; Scott.\nIn his private life he was a keen amateur golfer and was an enthusiastic huntsman, often riding with the Jedburgh pack. He died in Hawick in 1965.\nRugby career.\nRoberts first came to note as a rugby player while a student representing Cardiff High School. He played for Cardiff RFC while still a teenager, making his first appearance for the club in the 1924–25 season. On entering Cambridge he was selected for the Cambridge University student team and won two sporting Blues, playing in the Varsity matches of 1927 and 1928. In the latter match he faced his younger brother Bill Roberts, who was playing for Oxford.\nIn 1927 Roberts was selected to play for Wales. He played his first game on 15 January against England as part of the 1927 Five Nations Championship. Despite Wales losing the match, Roberts became a key player for Wales over the next three years and played in 13 consecutive matches. During the 1927 tournament Roberts scored his first international points, with two tries against France in a 25–7 victory. The France game would be Wales' only win in a poor season, and Roberts was on the losing side to both Scotland and Ireland. He finished off the year with another defeat, this time to the touring Waratahs of New South Wales.\nThe 1928 Five Nations Championship was no better for Wales, and Roberts played in all four games; loses to England, Ireland and France, and a win over Scotland. In the Scotland match, played at Murrayfield, Roberts scored one of three Welsh tries, in a 13–0 victory. The following year Wales fared better, finishing second in the 1929 Championship. Wales started poorly with another lose to England, but in a home match against Scotland, Wales recorded a win. Roberts was on the score-sheet twice with two tries that helped secure the result. This was followed by a win over France a draw away to Ireland. The Ireland game was Roberts last for his country.\nOutside the international game, Roberts' club career was dominated by his time representing Cardiff. He played 101 matches for the club and spent a span of eight seasons playing for the team. He also represented London Welsh RFC and on two occasions he played for invitational touring side the Barbarians.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "Chinese Golf Factory Workers Strike for Essential Rights",
        "text": "The Chinese Golf Factory Workers Strike for Essential Rights was a strike that happened in Shenzhen, China. On July 21, 2014, approximately 300 Chinese workers at China Qilitian Golf Articles (QLT), in Shenzhen, China, marched in a strike to obtain their essential rights as factory workers. One of the prominent leaders of the strike was Qi Jianguang, a 26-year-old man who worked at the factory for eight years. During the strike, the workers marched throughout a park in Shenzhen as they carried banners, and also took photos on their devices that were later posted on social media. They used social media in a beneficial way, to promote their campaign, and to create worldwide awareness of this event.\nBackground.\nThe workers for QLT produce golf balls and golf clubs for Nike, Callaway, Bridgestone, Ping, Cobra, and Titleist. The factory employed over 2,000 workers at the time of the strike, yet was proven to be disobeying the Chinese law for years. QLT failed to purchase five types of insurance that were required by law. In addition, the company deducted excessive tax on employees’ paychecks. Not only that, but China Qilitian Golf Articles also neglected to make social security contributions for its large number of employees, and deprived the workers of their basic rights. Some of these basic rights included, “payment for social insurance, funding for housing, high temperature subsidies, living wages during low production season, and also factory union elections,” (Global Nonviolent Action Database, Molly Murphy, 2015).\nChina Qilitian Golf Articles created another production line in Jianguanxi, China, in order to obtain a greater amount of inexpensive labour. Due to the creation of an additional location, the company began to reduce orders and relocate assets from the Shenzhen factory. The workers at the Shenzhen location were extremely worried that their workplace would close in the near future, and therefore decided to go on strike.\nOutcome.\nThe strike had an immensely negative impact on QLT, which in turn, led the management team to negotiate with its employees. The strikers created a list of demands that they were determined to have met, and the organization approved the majority of the workers’ demands. The management team of QLT arranged monthly meetings to be held with workers who were democratically elected to the workers’ committee. The purpose of these meetings was to resolve any further complications after the strike, and to promote compromise amongst the management team and its employees. Other factory workers across China were inspired by the success of the nonviolent demonstrations, and many workers decided to also protect their essential rights. As a result, there was a distinct increase in the number of labour protests that occurred throughout China."

        "title": "2016 Diamond League",
        "text": "The 2016 IAAF Diamond League was the seventh season of the annual series of outdoor track and field meetings, organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).\nThe 2016 series saw three changes to the format. One of the two American meetings, the Adidas Grand Prix held in New York, was dropped from the calendar in favour of the Rabat Meeting in Morocco. This was the first meeting on the calendar to be held in Africa, which had previously been the only northern hemisphere continent not represented on the Diamond League. The second major change was an amendment to the point scoring system. The former model of four points for the winner, two for runner-up and one for third was overhauled with a broader points system giving ten to the winner, six the runner-up and progressively fewer points down to sixth place. The system of double points for the event finals was retained. A third change was the compression of the field events – throws and horizontal jumps allowed three attempts for all athletes, then the top four athletes at that point of the competition were permitted an additional three attempts (as opposed to the previous format of all athletes receiving six attempts).\nFormat.\nDiamond Race events.\nThe programme for Diamond Race events remained unchanged, with a total of 32 events divided evenly between the sexes. On the track, six running events were included for each of the sexes, from 100 metres up to 5000 metres, and all Olympic hurdles and steeplechase events featured. In the field events, all traditional four jumps were contested and three of the four traditional throwing events were held. Hammer throw remained absent due to restrictions of stadium size. The parallel IAAF Hammer Throw Challenge series catered for that event.\nThe attempt format for throws and horizontal jumps was amended so that each athlete received three attempts, then the top four athletes received an additional three attempts. This change followed a similar arrangement that was introduced at the 2016 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The announcement of the change received a mixed reaction from athletes and fans.\nPoints.\nPerformances in each of the Diamond Races events received points according to the finishing position of the athletes. The winner of the Diamond Race is the athlete with the greatest number of points by the end of the series. In the event of a tie on points, the victor is the athlete with the most race wins that year. The series winners receive a Diamond Trophy and US$40,000.\nSchedule.\nThe following fourteen meetings are scheduled to be included in the 2016 season:\nWinners.\nEvents not included in the Diamond League are marked in grey background.\nMeeting highlights.\nDoha.\nThere were twelve world leads set at the opening meet of the season in Doha, as well as 4 meeting records at an event which has begun the Diamond League season each of the past 7 years. The women's triple jump proved to be an enthralling contest, as the lead changed hands 5 times between Caterine Ibargüen and Yulimar Rojas over the course of the 6 rounds. The women's pole vault also provided a spectacle as Sandi Morris jumped a height of 4.83 to equal the Diamond League record and set an outdoor world lead. Two Americans, Ameer Webb and LaShawn Merritt, won the men's sprint events, with Webb running 19.85 to go 23rd on the all-time list. All the women's track events had new world leads set, with the most impressive being Almaz Ayana's 3000 metres victory, where she ran less than a second outside her personal best to run the 19th fastest race of all time. In the men's field, Christian Taylor returned to the meet where he came within 25 cm of the world record last year, and won his event with 17.23.\nShanghai.\nSix world leads were set at this meeting, with five meeting records also falling. Two of the best performances of the night came in the women's 1500 metres and discus throw. Sandra Perković threw 70.88 which although placing 98th on the all time lists, is the second farthest mark this century, behind her throw to win the 2014 European Championships. In the 1500 metres, Faith Kipyegon ran a Kenyan national record to win, with a time that places her just outside the top 25 female 1500 metres runners of all time. Home favourite Gao Xinglong won the men's long jump, beating Rushwahl Samaai on countback. On the track, Justin Gatlin ran his first 100 metres race under 10 seconds this season, to win, beating Qatari Femi Ogunode. The men's 800 metres was won by Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich, though there was some controversy, as world record holder and Olympic champion David Rudisha and Bram Som, the pacemaker for the race, were left waiting at the start of the race, having expected a recall due to field athletes being on the track when the gun fired.\nRabat.\nThe first appearance of the Rabat leg resulted in ten new meeting records for the African venue, as well as four world-leading performances. The four performances were Caster Semenya's 1:56.64 in the women's 800 m (five hundredths slower than the series record), Almaz Ayana's 14:16.31 in the women's 5000 m (the fifth fastest run ever at that point), an 8:02.77-minute run by Conseslus Kipruto in the men's steeplechase (the fastest ever on African soil) and 7:35.85 in the men's 3000 m by home athlete Abdalaati Iguider (also an African all-comers record). On the track, three further meet records came from Elaine Thompson in the women's 100 m, David Oliver in the men's 110 m hurdles, and LaShawn Merritt in the men's 400 m.\nIn the field events, South Africa's Rushwahl Samaai cleared in the men's long jump for a meeting record and the best mark ever achieved in Africa. A throw of left Piotr Małachowski a comfortable winner in the men's discus in a meet record. In the women's triple jump Caterine Ibargüen had her 33rd straight win. Latvia's Madara Palameika winning mark of in the women's javelin was a meeting record and Ekaterini Stefanidi added nineteen centimetres to the African all-comers record with her win of in the women's pole vault.\nEugene.\nThe Eugene meet produced nine world leads, five meet records, three area records, and two series records. The best results came from women's obstacle races. In the 100 m hurdles American Keni Harrison ran the second fastest ever time at 12.24 seconds, three hundredths off Yordanka Donkova's world record from 1988 and a NACAC area record. Ruth Jebet of Bahrain became the second woman to finish the steeplechase in under nine minutes, recording an Asian record of 8:59.97 with Kenya's Hyvin Jepkemoi a close runner-up in an African record of 9:00.01. Faith Kipyegon broke her own Kenyan record with a world lead and meet record of 3:56.41 in the 1500 m. Other world leads on the track came from Muktar Edris (men's 5000 m), Asbel Kiprop (men's mile), Tori Bowie (women's 200 m) and Mo Farah (men's non-Diamond race 10,000 m).\nThe men delivered the best field performances of that year's Prefontaine Classic. Joe Kovacs threw beyond 22 metres for a shot put world lead and Christian Taylor also did so in the triple jump with a meet record of . In the men's javelin Ihab Abdelrahman of Egypt threw for a meet record and equal world lead. Among the women field athletes, discus thrower Sandra Perković was the only repeat winner, with Diamond leaders Levern Spencer and Ivana Španović reduced to runners-up by home athletes Chaunté Lowe and Brittney Reese in the jumps.\nRome.\nAlmaz Ayana had the best performance of the night at 14:12.59 minutes for the women's 5000 m – this was (at one and a half seconds short of Tirunesh Dibaba's world record) the second fastest time ever and a Diamond League record. Caster Semenya equalled her own world lead of 1:56.64 to take her third straight win in the women's 800 m while Janieve Russell ran a world lead of 53.96 seconds in the women's 400 m hurdles. The sole world lead of the men's programme came from Conseslus Kipruto – a final-lap fall by Jairus Birech left Kipruto to his third steeplechase win in 8:01.41 minutes.\nIn Diamond races, Caterine Ibargüen had her 34th straight win. Bohdan Bondarenko took the lead in the men's high jump with his second win of the series while men's discus leader Piotr Małachowski slipped to sixth on the night (one of his worst placings of recent years). Among the women, Elaine Thompson (100 m), Ekaterini Stefanidi (pole vault), Valerie Adams (shot put) and Sunette Viljoen (javelin) had their second wins of the series to top the rankings.\nBirmingham.\nSix world leads and five meet records resulted from the Birmingham leg. In the women's pole vault Yarisley Silva of Cuba set a Diamond League record of . She and Mutaz Essa Barshim (2.37 m in the men's high jump) were the only world leads from the field events. On the men's track Conseslus Kipruto had his fourth straight world lead in a steeplechase meet record of 8:00.12. Asbel Kiprop had a world lead and meet record of 3:29.33 minutes in the men's 1500 m. In the men's 400 m, Kirani James had a meet record run of 44.23 seconds. In non-Diamond Race events, Mo Farah had a 3000 m world lead and British record of 7:32.62, while David Rudisha set an African record for the rarely run 600 m (also a world lead and meet record).\nIn women's track events, Francine Niyonsaba ran a meet record of 1:56.92 in the 800 m, breaking the series run of Caster Semenya (who was absent). Almaz Ayana's win streak was also broken in her absence, with Vivian Cheruiyot taking the 5000 m. Keni Harrison continued her streak in the 100 m hurdles with a meet record of 12.46 seconds. The upset of the night came in the women's triple jump, with Olga Rypakova ending Caterine Ibargüen's long-standing win streak by a winning margin of five centimetres.\nOslo.\nThe best performance of the 2016 Bislett Games was by Dafne Schippers, whose run of 21.93 seconds in the women's 200 m was a Diamond League record, meet record and a world lead. Thomas Röhler had the only world lead in the field events at in the men's javelin.

Sandra Perković also had her third straight win.\nIn Diamond races, Michael Tinsley's streak was stopped by Yasmani Copello in the men's 400 m hurdles, while the absence of Americans Justin Gatlin (100 m), Christian Taylor (triple jump) and Keni Harrison (100 m hurdles) saw their unbeaten records of the series end. Without Gatlin in the men's 100 m, Andre De Grasse had the first Diamond League win of his career. Joe Kovacs maintained high performance in the men's shot put, going over 22 metres for his second win of the series.\nStockholm.\nWith its overcast conditions, the Stockholm Bauhaus Athletics meet was the first of the year to produce no world leads. Ruth Jebet gave the sole meet record performance at 9:08.37 in the women's steeplechase. Three athletes achieved their first Diamond League wins: Jak Ali Harvey (100 m), Dina Asher-Smith (200 m) and Angelika Cichocka (1500 m). Keni Harrison and Christian Taylor returned to the top of their disciplines to take their third wins of the series, as did Ivana Španović and Renaud Lavillenie. Sandra Perković continued with her fourth victory to remain the only female athlete to go undefeated in the series. National interest came in the form of Susanna Kallur's return in the women's sprint hurdles, following a six-year absence from the sport by the world record holder due to injury.\nMonaco.\nAt the Herculis meeting, Caster Semenya was the top performer with a new Diamond League record of 1:55.33 minutes in the women's 800 m. This was also a South African record, meet record and a world lead. The runner-up Francine Niyonsaba also broke her national record at 1:56.24.

Ekaterini Stefanidi and Valerie Adams took the top of their event rankings in the pole vault and shot put, respectively. Tatsiana Khaladovich of Belarus had her first career win of the series in the women's javelin.\nLondon.\nThe London Grand Prix featured a world record run by Keni Harrison, who ran 12.20 seconds for the 100 m hurdles to beat the old standard from 1988. This proved an emotional moment for world-leader Harrison, who burst into tears on the track; after failing to make the American Olympic team, she had said \"only the record will make up for missing out on Rio\". Britain's Laura Muir delivered a meet and British record of 3:57.49 minutes to win the women's 1500 m.

        "text": "Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club is a tennis and squash club in south Dublin, Ireland. Established in 1877, Fitzwilliam is one of the oldest tennis clubs in the world. It has held the Irish Open annually since the late 19th century.\nHistory.\nIn November 1877 ten men met to found the Dublin Lawn Tennis Club. This club was to initially consist of 30 members each paying an annual subscription of three pounds. They next met on 23 November 1877 and discussed leasing grounds in Upper Pembroke Street near to Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, Ireland owned by Sir Francis Brady a judge on a lease of ten years for a rent of twenty five pounds per year. On 6 December 1877 another meeting was convened and the committee assembled and agreed to adopt the name Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club as recommended by one of its members. In 1879 the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club staged its first Irish Lawn Tennis Championships at Wilton Square which remained the host location of that event until 1903.\nIn 1880 the club had reached the point where there was not enough room for expansion at its current location. The club therefore purchased available land at Wilton Place and a building No. 6 Wilton Place that was converted to serve as the club's premises, in addition tennis courts were also constructed. In 1902 the club decided to build a pavilion at the club grounds which was financed through the sale of No 6 Wilton Place.\nIn 1903 the Irish Championships venue was moved from Fitzwilliam Square to Wilton Place. \nAppian Way.\nIn 1969 the members of Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club met to discuss a move to a site at Appian Way, Dublin which was concluded that year. During the move the club replaced a Victorian building named Epworth Hall (previously Winton House), which was sold by Wesley College Dublin. The Irish Open Tennis Championships continued to be played at Wilton Place until 1972, when they moved to the new venue at Appian Way, Dublin 6.\nFamous visitors to the club have included Princess Grace of Monaco in 1965.\nFormer tournaments.\nThe Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club has organised many notable tournaments throughout the years."

The tournament itself was a one-night eight-team tournament for trios, or tag teams of three wrestlers. AAA reached out to several promotions both in Mexico and around the world and arranged for six of the eight teams to come from outside of AAA. Japanese wrestling promotions All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and Pro Wrestling Noah. Both Total Nonstop Action and Ring of Honor, based in the United States, also sent representatives to the tournament, in each case bolstered by representatives of Lucha Underground, an AAA joint-venture project based on Los Angeles.

Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nWrestlers and promotions from around the world, Pro Wrestling Noah, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Lucha Underground, Pro Wrestling Wave and Oz Academy, were announced as being involved. The inclusion of Wave and Oz Academy meant that female wrestlers were going to be included too as they are all-female wrestling promotions. On April 22, 2016, AAA made their first official press release confirming the 2016 version of the Lucha Libre World Cup. The statement confirmed that there would be two qualifying matches for the Cup during the April 29 show in Xalapa, Veracruz, but did not reveal a date for the tournament nor any other participants.

The other qualifier was announced as current AAA Mega Champion El Texano Jr. wrestling against Taurus and Garza Jr. Of all the announced participants only Texano Jr. had participated in the previous year's Lucha Libre World Cup. The third qualifying match for Team AAA took place during the May 14 show in Orizaba, Veracruz and it was originally a three-way match between Nicho el Millonario, Ricky Marvin and El Hijo del Pirata Morgan but later due to a request from Psycho Clown he was added to the match and eventually won.\nTournament rules.\nAAA vice president Dorian Roldán explained the rules in a video uploaded to AAA's official YouTube channel last year. The tournament would consist of trios matches structured in quarterfinals, semi-finals and a final, plus an extra match to determine the third place. The bouts are slated to have a 15-minute time limit. If the time limit is reached without a clear winner, each of the participating teams selects one member, and the two picked wrestlers face off in a 5-minute sudden death in which the winning wrestler gets the victory for his team. There will be as many sudden deaths as necessary to determine a victor.\nTournament bracket.\nMen's Division\nWomen's Division"

        "text": "In baseball, a single is the most common type of base hit, accomplished through the act of a batter safely reaching first base by hitting a fair ball (thus becoming a runner) and getting to first base before a fielder puts him out. As an exception, a batter-runner reaching first base safely is not credited with a single when an infielder attempts to put out another runner on the first play; this is one type of a fielder's choice. Also, a batter-runner reaching first base on a play due to a fielder's error trying to put him out at first base or another runner out (as a fielder's choice) is not credited with a single.\nOn a single hit to the outfield, any runners on second base or third base normally score, and sometimes the runner from the first base can advance to third base. Depending on the location of the hit, a quick recovery by the outfielder can prevent such an advance or create a play on the advancing runner.\nPete Rose is the all-time leader in singles with 3,215 career. Ty Cobb (3,053) is the only other player in MLB history with over 3,000 career singles.\nAs of March 29, 2024, no active players are in the top 100 of career singles. The active leader is Elvis Andrus in 180th with 1,558."

        "title": "1909 Queensland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1909 Queensland Rugby League season was the inaugural season of rugby league football club competition in Brisbane, Queensland. Club matches had begun in July 1908 and encouraged by a small profit, the Queensland Amateur Rugby League looked to establish club competitions.\nIn April 1909, Valley, who had played matches in 1908, held a meeting to, \"start a senior Valley Club to play under the Northern Union [Rugby League] rules\". \nSeason summary.\nThe structure for competitive club Rugby League in Brisbane appears to be modelled on how Rugby Union was organised in the city at the time. Rugby Union in 1909 had Senior and Junior divisions, with multiple grades in each.\nSenior Competition.\nFour teams entered the senior Rugby League competition: North Brisbane, South Brisbane, Toombul and Valley. Practice matches were arranged for May 1, with the competition to begin the following Saturday.\nThe first senior club competition matches in Brisbane were played on Saturday, May 8, 1909. Both matches were played at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, Woolloongabba. In the first match played, North Brisbane 8 defeated Toombul nil. In the match that followed, South Brisbane 12 defeated Valley 2.\nSharing the season calendar with representative fixtures, club senior competition matches were played on eight Saturdays across five months - May 8, 15, 22, 29, July 3, 10 24 (Semi-Finals) and September 4 (Final). As all Senior results were published in the newspapers (\"The Telegraph\", \"The Brisbane Courier\" and \"Truth\") it is possible to reconstruct a competition table.\nAll four teams played in semi-finals. It is possible that the QARL was using a similar approach that the NSWRFL was using at the time. Namely, two points for a win in a semi-final or final were added to the team's tally. A challenger would have to pass on competition points the team they challenged. This may be the reason that while North Brisbane challenged South Brisbane for a place in the final, Valley played Toombul to give them an opportunity to secure a further two points.\nIn the semi-finals South Brisbane 21 defeated North Brisbane 11 and Valley 30 defeated Toombul 0.\nThe Final of the competition was held on Saturday, September 4 at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, Woolloongabba. South Brisbane opened the scoring with a penalty before Valley responded with a converted try. Following a second penalty to South Brisbane, Valley led 5 to 4 at the half-time break. Valley increased their lead in the second half, scoring four tries, converting one. South Brisbane did not add to their score. Full-time: Valley 19 defeated South Brisbane 4.\nJunior Competition.\nJunior division teams included Milton, North Brisbane, South Brisbane, St Bridget’s, Toombul, Valley.\nSt Bridget's won the junior premiership with North Brisbane juniors the runner's up.\nContemporary newspaper reports refer to St Bridget’s Church and Convent Grounds at Red Hill, suggesting that the team was linked to the church now known as St Bridid's. \nSt Bridget’s also had a cricket team, playing in the 1909-10 Fourth Grade Junior competition.

They are paired up in each round, traveling and working together between the series. Usually, they are never assigned to work two games between two teams they have already seen. This does not apply if a series reaches seven games, or at any point in time beginning in the third round. If a game seven is reached, those who have been assigned to work in the next round will call the series-deciding game. If at any time a referee or linesman is injured or unable to work, there is a standby official; he is there in the event that one of the officials cannot continue in the game.\nThroughout the playoffs, the list of officials is minimized.\nIn the final round of cuts, the list is reduced to ten officials: Five referees and five linesmen. They are named as Stanley Cup Finals officials. They are no longer in pairs; they will rotate so that all officials are involved in the series.

        "text": "The 2016–17 European Rugby Champions Cup was the third European Rugby Champions Cup championship (22nd overall), the annual rugby union club competition for teams from the top six nations in European rugby. The competition replaced the Heineken Cup, which was Europe's top-tier competition for rugby clubs for the first nineteen years of professional European rugby union. The opening round of the tournament took place on the weekend of 14/15/16 October 2016. The final took place on 13 May 2017 at Murrayfield in Edinburgh.\nEnglish side Saracens were the 2015–16 champions, having beaten Racing 92 of France in the 2016 final in Lyon.\nSaracens retained the cup, defeating Clermont in the final 28–17.\nTeams.\nTwenty clubs from the three major European domestic and regional leagues competed in the Champions Cup. Nineteen of these qualified directly as a result of their league performance.\nThe distribution of teams was:\nDue to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, it was decided that the play-off system that had previously decided the final team would be suspended, and that this year the winner of the 2015–16 European Rugby Challenge Cup would automatically qualify for the tournament. In the event this team had already qualified, the team's domestic league would be allocated an extra qualifying place.\nThe following teams qualified for the 2016–17 tournament.\nThis was the first time all four Irish provinces qualified for Europe's top club competition on their own merits, as Connacht's two previous appearances in the former Heineken Cup had been as a result of Leinster winning that cup the previous season.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe 20 competing teams are seeded and split into four tiers, each containing 5 teams.\nFor the purpose of creating the tiers, clubs are ranked based on their domestic league performances and on their qualification for the knockout phases of their championships, so a losing quarter-finalist in the Top 14 would be seeded below a losing semi-finalist, even if they finished above them in the regular season.\nBased on these seedings, teams are placed into one of the four tiers, with the top seed clubs being put in Tier 1. The nature of the tier system means that a draw is needed to allocate two of the three second seed clubs to Tier 1. Exeter Chiefs and Leinster were drawn into Tier 1, meaning the remaining side - Toulon went into Tier 2. As a result of this draw, Montpellier also entered Tier 2, as the fourth seed from the league of the second seed placed in Tier 2. The other two fourth-ranked sides fell into Tier 3.&lt;ref name=\"2015/16 draw\"&gt;European Rugby Pool Draws for 2015/16 season - EPCRugby.com&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe tiers are shown below. Brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nThe following restrictions will apply to the draw:\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 29 June 2016, in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.\nTeams will play each other twice, both at home and away, in the group stage, that will begin on weekend of 14/15/16 October 2016, and continue through to 20/21/22 January 2017, before the pool winners and three best runners-up progressed to the quarter-finals.\nTeams will be awarded competition points, based on match result. Teams receive 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw, 1 attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and 1 defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers will be used, as directed by EPCR:\nKnock-out stage.\nFormat.\nThe eight qualifiers are ranked according to their performance in the pool stage and compete in the quarter-finals which were held on the weekend of 31 March, 1/2 April 2017. The four top teams hosted the quarter-finals against the four lower teams in a 1v8, 2v7, 3v6 and 4v5 format.\nThe semi-finals were played on the weekend of 22/23 April 2017. In lieu of the draw that was used to determine the semi-final pairing, EPCR announced that a fixed semi-final bracket would be set in advance, and that the home team would be designated based on \"performances by clubs during the pool stages as well as the achievement of a winning a quarter-final match away from home\". Semi-final matches must be played at a neutral ground in the designated home team's country.\nHome country advantage was awarded as follows:\nThe winners of the semi-finals contested the final, at Murrayfield, on 13 May 2017."

Nonetheless, the overall structure remained largely the same: the top four teams were given byes into the quarterfinal round, and the remaining eight teams were entered into the preliminary round. All seeds were determined by regular season conference records, regardless of division. "

        "text": "The 2016–17 European Rugby Challenge Cup was the third edition of the European Rugby Challenge Cup, an annual second-tier rugby union competition for professional clubs. Clubs from six European nations plus one Russian club competed. It was also the 21st season of the Challenge Cup competition in all forms, following on from the now defunct European Challenge Cup.\nMontpellier were the reigning champions, having beaten Harlequins in the final of the 2015–16 European Rugby Challenge Cup. They did not defend their title as they automatically qualified for the 2016–17 European Rugby Champions Cup as a result of the win.\nThe first round of the group stage began on the weekend of 13/14/15/16 October 2016, and the competition ended with the final on 12 May 2017 in Edinburgh.\nStade Français won the final 25–17 against Gloucester.\nTeams.\n20 teams qualified for the 2016–17 European Rugby Challenge Cup; a total of 18 qualified from across the Premiership, Pro12 and Top 14, as a direct result of their domestic league performance, with two coming through a play-off. The expected distribution of teams was:\nThe French Top 14 had its allocation reduced by 1 place after Montpellier won the 2015–16 European Rugby Challenge Cup. This is after it was decided that, due to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, there would be no qualification play-off.\nThe following clubs qualified for the Challenge Cup.\nQualifying competition.\nOnce again, EPCR expanded the qualifying competition.\nEight teams were split into two pools of four. Each team played the four teams in the other pool once. The winner of each pool then played a two-legged final against last year's qualifying sides, and the winners, on aggregate, took the two remaining places in the Challenge Cup.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe 20 competing teams were seeded and split into four tiers; seeding was based on performance in their respective domestic leagues. Where promotion and relegation is in effect in a league, the promoted team was seeded last, or (if multiple teams are promoted) by performance in the lower tier.\nTeams were taken from a league in order of rank and put into a tier. A draw was used to allocate two second seeds to Tier 1; the remaining team went into Tier 2. This allocation indirectly determined which fourth-seeded team entered Tier 2, while the others entered Tier 3.\nGiven the nature of the Qualifying Competition, a competition including developing rugby nations and Italian clubs not competing in the Pro12, Rugby Europe 1 and Rugby Europe 2 were automatically included in Tier 4, despite officially being ranked 1/2 from \"that competition\".\nThe brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nThe following restrictions applied to the draw:\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 29 June 2016, in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.\nTeams played each other twice, both at home and away, in the group stage, that began on weekend of 13/14/15/16 October 2016, and continued through to 19/20/21/22 January 2017, before the pool winners and three best runners-up progressed to the quarter finals.\nTeams were awarded competition points, based on match result.

        "text": "In baseball statistics, a player is credited with a plate appearance (denoted by PA) each time he completes a turn batting. A player completes a turn batting when: he strikes out or is declared out before reaching first base; or he reaches first base safely or is awarded first base (by a base on balls, hit by pitch, or catcher's interference); or he hits a fair ball which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely (\"see also\" left on base, fielder's choice, force play). In other words, a plate appearance ends when the batter is put out, the inning ends, or he becomes a runner. A related statistic, at bats, counts a subset of plate appearances that end under certain circumstances.\nPete Rose is the all-time leader with 15,890 career plate appearances. Rose is the only player in MLB history to surpass 14,000 and 15,000 career plate appearances. Carl Yastrzemski (13,992), Hank Aaron (13,941), Rickey Henderson (13,346), Ty Cobb (13,103), and Albert Pujols (13,041) are the only other players to surpass 13,000 career plate appearances.\nAs of March 29, 2024, no active players are in the top 100 for career plate appearances. The active leader is Joey Votto, in 183rd with 8,746."

        "title": "Kent County Cricket Club in 1909",
        "text": "Kent County Cricket Club's 1909 season was the twentieth season in which the county club competed in the County Championship. Kent played 30 first-class cricket matches during the season, losing only two matches overall, and won their second championship title. They finished clearly ahead of second place Lancashire in the 1909 County Championship with the previous year's winners, Yorkshire, in third place.\nTwo of the county's players, Arthur Day and Douglas Carr, were selected as Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1910 as a result of their performances during the season. Carr made his debut in first-class cricket during the season at the age of 37 and played in his only Test match in August.\nThe championship title was the second of four by Kent during the Golden Age of cricket in the years leading up to the First World War. It followed their first title in 1906, with the nucleus of the side unchanged from then. It was followed by their third title in 1910 and fourth in 1913.\nBackground.\nAfter decades of underachievement, Kent won their first County Championship in 1906, with \"the best county side of the year\" which \"showed the most brilliant form\". The re-emergence of strong Kent sides was based on the development of a mix of \"gifted\" amateurs playing alongside an increasingly strong core of professionals, most of whom were a product of the club's Tonbridge Nursery - its player development centre based at the Angel Ground at Tonbridge. By 1906 professionals were making around 60% of all appearances for Kent, a figure which had increased markedly since the establishment of the Nursery in 1897 and provided a much firmer foundation for the side to achieve success on the field.\nAfter the success of 1906, Kent finished eighth in the County Championship in 1907 and second in 1908, winning more games than the champions Yorkshire but losing three compared to Yorkshire's unbeaten season. C. H. B. Marsham, who had captained the side in 1906, gave up the captaincy at the end of 1908 and Ted Dillon was appointed to lead the side.\n1909 season.\nKent started the season with a match against the MCC at Lord's which they won by 97 runs before the County Championship got under way with six away matches. The series of games saw four wins and two draws, with the first three matches of the season won by an innings in each case. A match against Oxford University divided this series of Championship matches and was also won by the margin of an innings.\nA draw against Essex in Kent's first home match of the season in June at Catford was followed by two losses to Worcestershire and Lancashire, both matches taking place at Tonbridge. These were to be the only two losses of the Championship season as Kent went unbeaten for the remainder of the season.\nSeven wins and a draw from the middle of June to the end of July saw Kent in a commanding position in the Championship. These included an innings victory against Gloucestershire at Catford which saw Kent score 593, the second highest total in the Championship in 1909. They were to continue their good form in August, winning their first two matches of the month during Canterbury Cricket Week and going on to draw three and win three of the remaining Championship matches, including a rain affected draw against third placed Yorkshire at Dover. A match against the touring Australian side at Canterbury in the middle of the month was also a rain affected draw.\nA draw, despite being asked to follow-on in a rain shortened match, in the Champion County match in September at The Oval completed the season.\nPlayers.\nThe 1909 side was captained by Ted Dillon in his first year of captaincy and featured England international players Colin Blythe, Kenneth Hutchings and Arthur Fielder. All three had toured Australia over the 1907–08 winter. Frank Woolley made his Test debut during the summer against the touring Australians, the first of his 64 Tests, with Douglas Carr making his sole Test appearance in the same match.\nCarr, who bowled leg-spin and who was an early proponent of the relatively new googly delivery, made his first-class cricket debut against Oxford University in May at the age of 37. He had not previously played any first-class cricket but, after developing his googly in 1908, he used it so well in club cricket that Kent offered him a trial. He had played only six first-class matches when he was selected for the fifth Test of the summer's Ashes series, taking five wickets in the first Australian innings and seven overall in the match.\nCarr capped his remarkable rise to fame by being selected as one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year in 1910 alongside batsman Arthur Day. He played only one Test, although he made regular appearances for Kent until the end of the 1913 season.\nDillon was unavailable from early August and Jack Mason, who had been club captain between 1897 and 1902, stepped in to captain the side in the last five Championship matches. The 1909 side also included Woolley, by now a well established all-rounder, and James Seymour who each played in 29 of the 30 matches in the season as well as Punter Humphreys, Bill Fairservice, Fred Huish and Wally Hardinge, all six of whom were professionals and provided the core of the Kent team for the season. Huish was the main wicket-keeper and was considered the senior professional, beginning a streak of 151 consecutive County Championship appearances in 1909. The reserve wicket-keeper was Jack Hubble who, as a result of Huish's dominant position, played only two matches in 1909.\nAs well as Carr, batsmen David Jennings and Harold Prest made their debuts for Kent in 1909, Jennings playing once and Prest four times.\nAges given as of the first day of Kent's 1909 County Championship season, 17 May 1909.\nSource: CricketArchive and CricInfo statistics\nStatistics.\nDuring 1909 Kent played 30 first-class matches, including 26 in the County Championship. They won 18, drew ten and lost only two matches, both during Tonbridge week in June.\nPunter Humphreys led the county in run scoring with a total of 1,390 runs, including 1,207 in the County Championship, closely followed by Kenneth Hutchings with 1,368 total runs. Hutchings led the Championship aggregate for Kent with 1,251 runs. Frank Woolley, James Seymour and Arthur Day also scored more than 1,000 runs for Kent during the season. Day and Hutchings both scored three centuries, as did Jack Mason who averaged 65.25 with the bat in 14 innings. Humphreys scored the County's highest score of the season with 208, at the time a record highest individual score for Kent.\nWoolley and Arthur Fielder shared a partnership of 235 for the tenth wicket against Worcestershire at Amblecote. As of April 2016 this remains the highest last-wicket partnership in the County Championship. The pair came together when Kent were still 40 behind Worcestershire's first innings of 360 and raised Kent's total to 555 before Kent went on to win by an innings. Woolley, who scored 185, had retired hurt earlier in the innings after being hit in the mouth by a ball from Ted Arnold. Fielder contributed 112 not out to the partnership, the only first-class century of his career.\nColin Blythe was Kent's leading wicket taker in 1909, taking 178 Championship wickets at an average of 14.07, a total which led all bowlers in the Championship. He took 185 wickets in total during the season for Kent, including taking 10 wickets in a match five times and five wickets in an innings 18 times during the season with his left arm spin bowling. Fast bowler Arthur Fielder took 95 wickets with spinners Woolley, Douglas Carr and Bill Fairservice all making significant contributions.\nKent's best individual bowling figures for the season were Blythe's 9/42 taken against Leicestershire in May, closely followed by the same bowler's 9/44 against Northamptonshire in the same month. His 16/102 in the match against Leicestershire were the season's best bowling figures in the County Championship, followed by his 14/75 in the match against Northamptonshire.\nFred Huish took 63 wicket-keeping dismissals for Kent during the season, including 35 catches and 22 stumpings in the County Championship. James Seymour took 35 catches in the Championship as part of Kent's well respected slip cordon. Seymour played in every Championship match for Kent during the season, with Blythe, Humphreys, Hutchings and Woolley all playing in 25.\nBatting statistics.\nThe table below includes all first-class batting for Kent during the 1909 season.\nSource: CricketArchive statistics and scorecards.\nBowling statistics.\nThe table below includes all first-class bowling for Kent during the 1909 season.\nSource: CricketArchive statistics and scorecards."

        "title": "Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's golf",
        "text": "The Bulldogs men's golf team represented the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) in the sport of golf from 1947–1991. Overshadowed by the school's hockey, football and basketball programs, constrained by parsimonious budgets, disadvantaged by a short spring season, and without athletic scholarships, the UMD golf program was, nonetheless, one of the most successful of the University's intercollegiate athletic programs during its existence. Perennially a conference champion threat with rosters composed of predominately Duluth area athletes, the golf team was one of the first UMD athletic programs to qualify for national championship play and gave the school its first two All-American First Team honorees. During the 45 years of the program, the Bulldogs finished first or second in conference 29 times. Thirteen teams qualified for the NAIA National Championship Tournament and seven were selected to play for the NCAA Division II title. The golf program had the distinction of representing the highest showing for a UMD team of any sport at a national event for 31 years and the highest individual finish for 25 years. Despite its achievements, the UMD golf program was eliminated for the 1991-92 school year, a casualty of athletic department budget cuts.\nEarly years – golf program beginnings.\nThe UMD golf program began in the spring of 1947 with Ward Wells as coach (some newspaper articles credit athletic director Lloyd Peterson as head coach). At the time, the school was known as the Duluth State Teacher's College (Duluth State) and was affiliated with the State Teachers College Conference of Minnesota (TCC). With the conclusion of World War II and the return of college-aged men from the armed services, Duluth State administrators met in June 1946 to propose the creation of an expanded sports program for the school (the war-suspended football and basketball programs resumed play for the 1945-1946 school year). To this end, they agreed to reestablish the shuttered men's ice hockey program and commence other athletic activities such as track, skiing, golf and boxing for the 1946-47 school year.\nThe inaugural Bulldogs golf team played only a brief schedule of meets in May 1947. In its first meet as a golf program, Duluth State lost to a squad from the Duluth Junior College at Lester Park Golf Course with only Walter Silesky winning his match. However, at the Bemidji Invitational track and field meet, the Bulldogs scored top honors by defeating Bemidji State Teachers College and Moorhead State Teachers College with James Cran carding a 79 to tie for medalist. These meets were conducted in preparation for the TCC “Loop” (as conference championships were referred to in the idiom of the time) held at the conclusion of the athletic season. Duluth State's first conference team roster included James Cran, Jack Donaldson, Joe Dubla and Dale Moren with Gus Novotney as an alternate. The team finished its introductory season last among six teams at the conference meet in St. Cloud with an average 18 hole score of 92.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 1946-47 school year, the Minnesota state legislature approved a bill authorizing the transfer of the Duluth State Teachers College to the University of Minnesota system with the school to be known as the University of Minnesota, Duluth Branch or UMD. With an expanded schedule of meets against conference rivals as well as local colleges, the 1948 UMD golf team won two of three triangular meets against Duluth Junior College and Superior State College, defeated Bemidji Teachers College and Saint Cloud Teachers College in another triangular meet and beat Eveleth Junior College in a dual meet. The squad entered the 1948 conference loop more prepared to challenge for the title than in 1947. Improving on the previous year, the team finished third at the TCC golf championship held at Mankato County Club. Jerry Chessen shot a 74 for 18 holes and finished one stroke out of a playoff for individual medalist honors.\nMove to the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.\nIn March 1949, UMD left the State Teachers College Conference of Minnesota and joined the larger Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC). Prior to UMD joining, MIAC member schools were private institutions and, for the most part, located in-and-around the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis and Saint Paul and other areas south. This made an odd and, at times, uneasy fit for the state-funded and northern-based UMD. So much so, UMD was granted only probationary status for the first six years of membership for fear it would outgrow the conference. It wasn't until 1954 that conference members voted to extend full membership to UMD with several recalcitrant schools agreeing to full membership only after an amendment was added that allowed a member institution to ask for a conference-level review of the status of any school. \nWhile some MIAC schools feared that UMD would become an overpowering athletic juggernaut, the move to the MIAC, instead, put the nascent UMD golf program at a distinct disadvantage to the other member schools. Springtime weather comes much earlier to the southern portions of Minnesota. Consequently, the UMD golf team often started preparation for the season weeks later than its conference rivals. In fact, weather would become a constant hindrance to the UMD golf program. The Bulldogs would suffer through several instances where the golf season was reduced to a few meets or just the conference championship and the NAIA District 13 tournament. This disadvantage became more acute at the national level where UMD competed against teams from the south and west whose players could play year-round.\nWith the school having just joined the MIAC at the start of the 1949 golf season, UMD was unable to schedule any meets against conference teams. However, the Bulldogs were undefeated in non-conference competition against the likes of Moorhead State, Michigan Tech, Bemidji State and North Dakota State. Unbeaten, the golf team entered the 1949 MIAC championship very confident despite having never competed against a conference team. This confidence was misplaced and the team unprepared for conference play. Not only did the squad have no knowledge of the caliber of golfers in the meet or familiarity with the Keller Golf Course layout, but Coach Wells in a pre-tournament interview admitted that he did not even know if the championship would be conducted on a stroke play or match play basis. The team combined an off-day with high winds to finish a disappointing 6th place in its first MIAC championship. Having averaged 78 strokes as a team in non-conference play, their conference championship average ballooned to 84 strokes. However, the team was young with only one senior on the squad. Learning from this setback, it would be the last time UMD golfers finished outside the top three in MIAC tournament play over the next 16 years.\nDominating the MIAC.\nFor the 1950 season, the Bulldog golfers got their second coach in five years: Lew Rickert. Rickert would coach the team for the next 25 years. In what would become a nearly annual tradition, poor weather delayed the start of team qualifying causing coach Rickert to assemble a team of only returning lettermen for its first outing against Saint Olaf College. Unfortunately, poor weather followed the team to Northfield Minnesota where winds upward of 50 miles per hour caused players to lose balance while in mid-swing. Matches were abbreviated to nine holes and the meet considered unofficial after two other competing teams walked off the course after playing only a few holes. UMD then traveled to Houghton Michigan where they defeated Michigan Tech in a non-conference encounter. Only after the team's return to Duluth was coach Rickert able to conduct a 36 hole tryout among 20 hopefuls to determine the five golfers to represent UMD on the MIAC tourney squad. Duluth Central high school graduate Andrew \"Walt\" Bida became UMD's first conference medalist shooting 76-79 (155) over two rounds at the Hiawatha Golf Club in Minneapolis to win the MIAC individual golf title. UMD took the top three MIAC tournament spots with Bill Strang and future PGA professional Rick Liljedahl coming in second and third-place respectively. However, the other two members of the team lagged far behind and the golf team finished third overall for the conference championship, nine strokes behind the winning College of Saint Thomas squad.\nIn 1951, led by Bida and two-time Minnesota State High School champion and fellow Duluth Central classmate Bob Braff, UMD swept five meets against Michigan Tech (twice), Gustavus Adolphus College, Wisconsin Central State College at Steven Point and Virginia Junior College and won the first of eight MIAC team titles over a 13-year span by edging out defending champion St. Thomas by a single stroke. Bida recorded a second-place finish in the season-ending conference event and Braff third. The golf title was first conference championship won by a UMD athletic program among the ten different sports championships conducted by the MIAC.\nThe 1952 squad began the season with its first competition outside its northern base with a Midwest tour against Xavier (Ohio), Vanderbilt University and the University of Kentucky going 1-2. The Bulldogs then defeated and tied Michigan Tech in a home-and-home series and downed conference foes Hamline University, Gustavus Adolphus and the Scots of Macalester College. Favored to repeat as conference champion, the team's number one player Bob Braff came down with the flu on the eve of the MIAC championship at Keller Golf Course and could not play. While UMD's Jack Flatt Jr. carded two 79's (158) to finish as tournament runner-up and Walt Bida and Jerry LaBreche fired identical 80-81 (161), Braff's absence proved crucial as his replacement Bob Alexander averaged 95 over two rounds (while the rest of the team averaged 81) and the Bulldogs finished third, 12 strokes behind champion Saint Thomas.\nMen's golf was first recognized by the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) as an intercollegiate sport in 1952. As a member institution of the NAIA, UMD qualified its golf team for the second annual NAIA national meet in 1953 by winning the MIAC team title by a margin of 31 strokes. By qualifying for the NAIA championship, the golf team joined the 1953 ski team as the first two UMD athletic programs to participate in national competition. In the early years of NAIA golf, very few college programs participated in the national tournament. The 1953 NAIA national tournament in Abilene, Texas was composed of just seven teams and 41 golfers – mostly from schools in the south. Something of a curiosity having traveled so far to participate, the local press reported on the arrival of the UMD team and contrasted the 95 degree weather in Texas with the 40 degree temperatures reported in Duluth. After a strong start with UMD's Richard Kohlbry in fourth place at the 36 hole halfway point, UMD managed a third-place team finish in the tournament with Bob Korsch, John Patrick and Kohlbry finishing individually 11th, 13th and 14th respectively. It would be the highest team finish in a national tournament for any UMD athletic program until equaled by the Bulldog golf team in 1962 and not bettered until 1984 when the UMD men's hockey team finished second at the NCAA Division I tournament.\nFrom 1953-1956, Duluth Denfeld high school graduate John Patrick would lead the UMD golf team to three MIAC team titles and one runner-up finish. Individually, he tied for low score at the 1954 MIAC championship (losing medalist honors in a playoff), another runner-up finish in 1955 and third place in 1956. In addition to Patrick, the 1954 team also featured Duluth Cathedral graduate Leo Spooner who would shoot 68 in his first tryout round and would later become one of the most successful amateur golfers from Minnesota and be inducted into the Minnesota Golf Hall of Fame. Patrick and Spooner were expected to lead the team to back-to-back conference titles with only perennial contender College of Saint Thomas thought to be a threat. But even the Tommies looked to be anything but intimidating after UMD easily beat both Saint Thomas and Virginia Junior College, winning all but one pairing in a triangular meet leading up to the conference championship. At the MIAC tournament, again held at Keller, Leo Spooner led at the halfway mark shooting a 76 with John Patrick one stroke behind at 77. Bob Korsch of UMD was two strokes back of the lead putting UMD in excellent position going into the final 18 holes. Unfortunately, only Patrick finished strong shooting another 77 to tie Jack Harrigan of Saint Thomas at 154 for low score but losing medalist honors on the third playoff hole. Spooner dropped to an 80 and finished tied for third. However, conference championships are usually won or lost by the play of the fourth and fifth men and it was the team from Saint Thomas that prevailed by placing all five of its golfers in the top eight, taking the title with a total score of 788 against 802 for the Bulldogs who finished 50 strokes ahead of third place Macalester College. \nConsistency help UMD capture the 1955 MIAC team title by 15 strokes ahead of runner-up Macalester College. John Patrick finished with 76-76 (152) to finish second and Rick Liljedahl, back from two years service in the military, shot 79-74 (153) for his second MIAC individual third-place finish. By virtue of claiming the 1955 MIAC team title, the Bulldogs were eligible for participation at the NAIA national tournament. Again held in Abilene, Texas, the tournament was still at that time a mostly southern dominated contest with five of the participating eight teams from Texas. At the 36 hole halfway point, Ray Ferguson of North Texas State had shot a blistering 66-67 (133) with UMD's top two players Dave Vosika 75-72 (147) and John Patrick 73-75 (148) far behind. The UMD team did not improve on its 1953 finish and ended in sixth place. Individually, only John Patrick finished in the top 25 with a tie for 22nd, 33 strokes behind Ferguson.\nThe 1956 golf team again won the MIAC title over second-place finisher Gustavus Adolphus College by six strokes with DuWayne Branscombe and John Patrick taking second and third respectively. UMD, however, did not play in the NAIA national tournament that year. The \"Duluth News Tribune\", \"Duluth Herald\", and \"UMD Statesman\" newspapers do not record the reason for not participating, but later NAIA tournaments passed up by UMD were due to insufficient funds available for travel and lodging.\nThrough the 1956 school year, the UMD golf program was the most successful of all the school's athletic programs. Only the UMD hockey program could be considered as successful as golf in the MIAC title count (also with three). In a review of UMD's sports programs since joining the MIAC in 1949, UMD hockey goalie and sports editor of the student newspaper \"The UMD Statesman\" (and later UMD hockey coach and Athletic Director) Ralph Romano reminded his readers of the lack of titles coming from the football and basketball programs and lauded the golf, skiing and cross-country teams for its championship wins.\nThe defending MIAC golf champion Bulldogs entered the 1957 season without its two top players from the previous year: John Patrick having graduated and DuWayne Branscombe lost to ineligibility. Freshman Frank Soderquist - a former teammate of Branscombe at Duluth Denfeld - led the team in qualifying and took the number one spot into the conference meet where he finished second individually and helped propel the team to the runner-up spot seven strokes behind Macalester. Under a new four-man team score format for representation at the NAIA tournament, Gustavus Aldophus - whose five-man team finished third in the MIAC tournament - beat Macalester in a one-hole sudden death playoff after the two team's top four scores ended in a draw at 501. While finishing second at the conference meet, UMD's top four scores were third with 505.\nThe 1958 squad began the season with two victories in a home-and-home series with Superior State which served as a warm-up to a meet with the University of Minnesota. No athletic team of UMD - a campus of the University of Minnesota system - had ever played a team from the main campus. While historic, the contest was no match. The Bulldogs were handily defeated in losing all five pairings with the Gophers. However, the team rebounded with a win against conference rival Hamline and finished runner-up to Macalester for a second year in a row at the MIAC finals.\nWith the departure of three members from the 1958 conference runner-up team, Coach Rickert felt he still had a winning team with the addition of Dan McNicoll to the 1959 squad. Although an upperclassman, McNicoll had not played golf for UMD. But he came with a proven record having won several junior tournaments as well as the Nemadji Men's Invitational in 1956 at the age of 18. The team cruised through its pre-conference schedule and headed to the MIAC tournament ready to face two-time defending titlist Macalester. However, the team did not perform to expectation and finished third in the conference championship behind Macalester and runner-up Gustavus with UMD's low man Dan McNicoll tied for sixth individually.\nThe 1960-1964 UMD golf teams were probably the most dominant of the Lew Rickert era. Anchored by two Duluth Denfeld high school hockey recruits and future UMD Athletic Hall of Fame inductees Tom Maas and Ron Johnson, the teams during this period won four straight MIAC team titles. The 1960 team defeated Superior State twice, Virginia Junior College, Hamline University and Augsburg College. Losing narrowly by four strokes to the College of Saint Thomas in a pre-conference meet, UMD got its revenge on the Tommies two days later by taking home the 1960 MIAC crown – its first in four years – with Tom Maas tied for low individual (losing medalist honors in a playoff). The team participated at the 1960 NAIA national championships held that year in Bemidji, Minnesota. By 1960, the NAIA national golf tournament had grown considerably since UMD's last appearance five years earlier with 18 teams and 140 individuals competing for what was now a truly national title. In sixth place after the first round, the team performed poorly in subsequent rounds and finished a disappointing 12th.\nWeather nearly derailed the 1961 season. Late April snow storms delayed the opening of Duluth-area courses into the first week of May resulting in the cancellation of meets and leaving a little more than two weeks for try-outs and preparation for the conference tournament. A rescheduled meet against Superior State was the only pre-MIAC tournament competition UMD was able to accomplish and served as a team tryout. In beating the Yellowjackets. Ron Johnson and Tom Maas showed little rust after the winter lay-off shooting 73 and 77 respectively on a still partially snow-covered Nemadji Golf Course. Despite the truncated season, UMD found its game quickly and successfully defended its MIAC team title by three strokes over Macalester College. Balance was the key to UMD's victory. While no UMD golfer placed in the top three, Jim “Cub” Olson, Ron Johnson and Tom Maas all finished in the top ten with Rolle Hoch just missing out of that group. Unfortunately, while the team earned the right to play in the NAIA national tournament, the athletic department was unable to allocate funds to participate at the Shawnee Oklahoma event.\nUMD won the MIAC team title again in 1962 with an even more balanced performance than in 1961 with Jeff Peterson taking second and all five Bulldog golfers finishing in the top eight. Despite winning the MIAC title, a second straight year of poor weather had limited UMD to just two meets against Superior State and one against Hamline University, and the MIAC tournament which qualified the team for the NAIA national tournament taking place in Davenport, Iowa. Nobody gave the team much of a chance; Coach Lew Rickert was \"hoping for seventh or eighth place at best.\" However, the team finished third out of 24 teams entered – just 12 strokes off the winning pace - joining the 1953 golf team as having the best national showing in the history of the UMD golf program. Under NAIA tournament rules, teams could enter five players of which the low four per round counted toward the team total. While first-place Western Illinois University, runner-up Texas Wesleyan, and fourth-place Whitman College all entered five-man teams, UMD played with only four golfers and did not have the advantage of being able to drop its high score. Individually, against a field of 130 participants, Tom Maas fired a four over par 292 over 72 holes (78-73-71-70) at the par 72 Emeis Golf Course layout to finish second to future PGA Tour winner Steve Spray's 290 of Eastern New Mexico University, the best individual finish in golf program history and the highest showing for any UMD sport until surpassed in 1987 by national wrestling champion Mike Hirschey. Ron Johnson – tied for fourth after regulation play – sank a 50-yard wedge shot for eagle three on the first playoff hole to take fourth place outright. Both Maas and Johnson were awarded NAIA All-American First Team honors for their performances – UMD's first All-American First Team honorees in any sport.\nWith Tom Maas and Ron Johnson returning as seniors in 1963, expectations were high that UMD could repeat its 1962 MIAC and NAIA performances. However, at a meet against conference rival Saint John's University on the eve of the MIAC tournament, Maas suffered a corneal scratch when a piece of dirt deflected off of his club and into his eye while executing a shot. Unable to compete the next day at the MIAC tournament, 6th man Rollie Hoch had to make a quick drive down to Saint Paul to substitute for Maas. A third-place effort by freshman Jim Sauntry along with solid play by the rest of the team allowed the Bulldogs to retain the MIAC team title by just two strokes over Macalester College. It was UMD's fourth team title in a row and eighth overall in 15 years of MIAC play. The team's NAIA hopes were dashed, however, when school finances prevented the team from participating at the national tournament.\nMIAC format changes handicaps UMD.\nThe year 1964 brought the introduction of a unique scoring system to determine the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic golf champion. Prior to the change, conference members scheduled their own meets on an individual basis; the outcomes of which did not count toward the conference championship. Typically, the Bulldogs would play a regular season schedule of meets with non-conference teams in addition to some conference foes. The only meet officially set up by the conference was the season-ending MIAC tournament which alone determined the conference champion. With the change, however, MIAC officials took over the scheduling of all meets between conference members. Every conference member would play each other and each meet counted as a win or loss with points assigned to each individual match to determine the victor of the meet. The MIAC tournament was reduced to just another meet albeit featuring every team in the conference and considerably more points up for grabs. The conference championship was awarded to the team which accumulated the most points from both the regular season meets and the conference meet.\nThe practical effect of the new scoring system was to harm northern-based UMD because of late winter weather not usually seen in the southern parts of the state (and where every other member of the conference was located). Under the old scheduling system, UMD was able to pick opponents without fear of early season losses costing it a chance at the title. However, with every meet now counting toward the championship, the UMD golf team was at a distinct disadvantage to other conference teams who often had weeks of practice prior to the beginning of the season. The impact on UMD was seen immediately; the golf team went into its first triangular meet of the 1964 season against Augsburg College and Concordia University without having a practice much less a finalized team and a second triangular against Macalester College and Saint Mary's University with only 27 holes of tryouts. Both of the Bulldogs' losses for the season occurred during these first two triangular meets and cost UMD a chance at the conference title for 1964. However, the team finished strong with a 6-2 conference record and added runner-up honors at the season-ending MIAC meet. Overall, UMD finished second to Macalaster for the conference crown. \nWeather again intervened as UMD participated in their first triangular meet of the 1965 season with no practice or tryouts for five returning golfers from the prior year squad losing to both Gustavus Adolphus College and Hamline University. With only one practice, the Bulldogs next participated at the Cougar Invitational Golf Tournament which served as the NAIA District 13 qualifying event for the national tournament. Coach Rickert strongly objected to the timing of the tournament (May 1) as UMD - having played just two rounds - was a great disadvantage to competing schools. Predictably, UMD finished sixth in the tourney and had no individuals among the top four moving on to represent Minnesota at the national tournament. Poor playing conditions and inconsistent conference play had UMD entering the season-ending MIAC tournament behind Macalaster, St. Thomas and Concordia, but a second-place team finish led by third place individual efforts from both Jim Sauntry and Gary Kaskela moved UMD into second place for the conference title. \nIn 1966, the Bulldog golf team's fortunes rested on the shoulders of yet another Duluth Denfeld graduate, Dave Hicks. Better known as a member of the U.S. Olympic ski jump team in 1964 and the U.S. National ski jump champion in 1965, Hicks also proved to be one of the best golfers in UMD program history. Not even mentioned in pre-season articles as a candidate for the team in 1966, Hicks, nonetheless, became the second UMD golfer to capture MIAC tournament individual medalist honors. While the team finished a disappointing third at the MIAC tournament and fourth in conference - UMD's worse showing since 1949, Hicks individually qualified for the NAIA national tournament finishing in 25th place.\nDave Hicks started the 1967 season right where he left off in 1966 by shooting 74 at Keller Golf Course and taking medalist honors at UMD's first triangular meet of the season against St. Thomas and Hamline. With Mark A. Carlson also having solid season, the Bulldogs rebounded from the prior year decline and compiled a 6-2 conference record, a second place showing at both the MIAC tournament and the NAIA District 13 qualifier and finished second in conference. Hicks led all golfers at the MIAC meet firing a three-over par 111 over 27 holes to repeat as conference medalist. Hicks and Mark A. Carlson both individually qualified for the NAIA national tournament. While Carlson missed the 36 hole cut, Hicks found himself tied for 7th place after three rounds - six strokes behind leader John Bohmann of Texas Lutheran University. However, a final round 78 pushed him down the final leader board into a three-way tie for 21st.\nLong interregnum.\nAn 11-year stretch of mostly unremarkable UMD golf results began with the departure of four lettermen from the 1967 conference runner-up team. With one lone returnee, the 1968 squad finished with an indifferent 4-4 dual meet record which left the team tied for fourth in conference going into the MIAC championship held at Stillwater Country Club. A 7th place showing at that tournament caused the Bulldogs to tumble in the standings and finish 7th overall in conference – the worst conference showing in the history of the golf program – and eliminated the team from playing in the NAIA District 13 Tournament.\nIn 1969, MIAC officials eliminated the regular season schedule instituted in 1964 and returned the season-ending MIAC tournament as the exclusive contest to determine the conference champion; the tournament itself becoming a two-day event. MIAC-member schools were free again to plan their own schedules and level of competition. While the other MIAC schools continued to compete at both meets and inter-collegiate tournaments, UMD - at probably the low point of the golf program - eliminated participation in all but the MIAC tournament and the Honeywell Collegiate Invitational which served as the NAIA District 13 national qualifying contest. The diminution of the golf program to something that more resembled a recreational sport activity had predictable results: the 1969 golf team finished 5th in the conference and 16th at the NAIA District 13 tournament. Not until 1976 and after a change in conferences would UMD participate in events outside of the conference championship and the NAIA qualifier. \nIn 1970, a freshman from Duluth Central High School named Lyn Ellingson provided lift for what otherwise would have been several years of mediocre teams. Recruited by UMD for hockey, Ellingson led the golf team in scoring in conference play for four straight years. As a freshman, he finished fourth individually at the conference championship. Ellingson was the MIAC individual medalist in 1971 and runner-up by one stroke in both 1972 and 1973. The play of Ellingson allowed the team to finish 2nd the MIAC conference tournament in both 1970 and 1971 as well as the NAIA District 13 tournament in 1971. But the bench behind Ellingson was thin and UMD could only muster a 6th and 4th-place finish respectively at the MIAC championship in 1972 and 1973 and far down the pack at the NAIA District 13 tournaments.\nNineteen seventy-four marked the end of Lew Rickert's long tenure as golf coach with his retirement. While his teams brought home eight MIAC titles, seven NAIA national tournament berths and two third-place finishes at the NAIA, the squad in his final year could do no better than fifth in conference and 13th at the district tournament.\nDave Hopkins was appointed golf coach for the 1975 season. His team responded by placing an unexpected second in the MIAC conference tournament for the first year coach. Interviewed by the \"Duluth News Tribune\", an exuberant coach Hopkins said that the MIAC result was “the best finish for UMD in 15 years”. This, of course, was incorrect as UMD had placed 1st four times and 2nd five times in the conference championship in the prior 15 years but accurately reflected the perception that the teams of late had been lackluster.\nRejoining the Northern Intercollegiate Conference.\nThe 1976 spring season marked the last year that UMD golfers would play in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Senior Dennis Nelson led the Bulldogs with a sixth-place finish individually at the MIAC tournament and the team took fourth. After a 28-year absence, University administrators decided to rejoin the former State Teacher's College Conference of Minnesota – renamed the Northern Intercollegiate Conference (NIC) – for the 1976-77 school year. Despite having joined the MIAC 15 years after its inception, the UMD golf team had won the second most MIAC titles (8) behind Macalester (11) when it left the conference. \nThe move to the NIC had many implications for the UMD golf program. Conference play would now be during the fall season instead of spring. With fall having better weather in the Duluth area and coming off of summer play, UMD golfers would be better positioned to compete against rival schools. The move also meant that UMD would be playing a split season: conference golf in the fall and national tournament qualifying golf in the spring. With the University on a quarterly schedule and students matriculating or graduating at different times of the year, the golf team roster was often impacted by team members either beginning or leaving school between the fall and spring seasons.\nReemergence.\nSince moving to the NIC in the fall of 1976, the Bulldog golf team had not enjoyed much success in conference play placing 4th at the conference championship in its first year and 3rd in 1977. However, Larry Opatz became UMD's first conference medalist in six years by taking the individual scoring title in 1977. But with the move to the NIC, the UMD golf program under coach Dave Hopkins undertook a strategic shift to compete in tournaments that would impact its visibility toward gaining NCAA Division II invitations and elevate the program back to relevance. UMD had dual affiliation with the NAIA and NCAA since 1955 but the golf program had not participated in any NCAA-sponsored tournaments. However, unlike the NAIA national tournament whose participants were determined (at that time) by winning NAIA district tournaments (and where a single bad round could end a team's chances of moving on to the national tournament), the NCAA Division II national tournament field was determined by a selection committee. Criteria for selection were tournament finishes relative to schools of the same level and the caliber of tournaments the team played. The NCAA also had the advantage of paying for travel and lodging for national tournament participants whereas the NAIA did not. For a budget-strapped team like UMD, this made for a more attractive alternative for post-conference play. For most of the program's existence, the UMD golf team had primarily participated in meets against regional teams and conference foes in preparation for the conference championship and the NAIA District 13 tournament. Having a strategic preference for NCAA Division II invitations, the Bulldogs now started to compete in large multiple-team tournaments throughout the Midwest against schools outside its division and conference. This strategy yielded dividends in May 1978 when Richard Kirby and Larry Opatz of UMD were individually selected to play in the NCAA Division II tournament. Both golfers finished well back with Kirby placing 87th and Opatz 98th but it was just the beginning of a long streak of national appearances for UMD.\nThe fall of 1978 saw big changes for the UMD golf program. Behind the scenes, George Fisher took over as coach of the team after four years under Dave Hopkins. More importantly, two players were added to the team that would propel the UMD golf program to success not seen since the early 1960s. The first was Lee Kolquist, a native Duluthian and a sophomore transfer from the University of Wisconsin Superior. The other was freshman Tom Waitrovich from Appleton, Wisconsin. Both would attain All-American honors and lead the UMD golf program back onto the national scene.\nUMD's NIC fortunes changed with Lee Kolquist winning medalist honors at the 1978 conference championship boosting the team to a second-place finish. While finishing only 5th at the NAIA district 13 tournament, the team's performance at the University of Minnesota Invitational and its win at Northern State Invitational earned them an invite to the 1979 NCAA Division II tournament, the first of seven consecutive national appearances. While finishing a disappointing 19th as a team, Kolquist was named NCAA Division II All-American Honorable Mention.\nFor the 1979-80 golf season, UMD had one of its finest results in its history winning both the Saint Cloud State Men's Golf Invitational (Kolquist earning medalist honors) and the Northern Intercollegiate Conference Golf Championship, taking runner-up honors at the North Country Invitational, and finishing third at the Northern Iowa Classic (Kolquist again medalist). More significantly, the Bulldog golfers captured both the NIC and NAIA District 13 crowns with UMD's Rich Kirby and Lee Kolquist sharing low score at the district tournament (Kirby taking medalist honors in a playoff.) Having been selected for the NCAA Division II tournament and winning its way to the NAIA tournament, UMD for the only time in its history played both national tournaments. At the Division II tournament, the golf team improved over its prior year finish and took 11th place. A week later, it placed 14th at the NAIA. Individually, Kolquist finished 11th at the NAIA and was awarded All-American First Team honors.\nUMD followed on that season with an even more spectacular 1980-81 campaign. The Bulldogs took first at the Southern Minnesota Invitational and second at both the Northern Iowa Classic and the Gulf Stream Golf Intercollegiate Tournament (Kolquist winning medalist honors at the Southern Minnesota and Northern Iowa events). While finishing second to Mankato State at the conference championship, the Bulldogs again took the NAIA District 13 title qualifying the team for the NAIA nationals. NIC rules, however, had changed to prevent a team from playing in more than one national event. UMD accepted an invitation to the NCAA Division II national tournament instead of taking the NAIA spot. The team placed fifth for the tournament, its highest national showing since the 1962's third-place finish and senior Lee Kolquist was ninth in individual standings earning him a spot on the NCAA Division II All-American Second team.\nWith the graduation of Lee Kolquist, leadership of the 1981-82 squad fell on senior Tom Waitrovich. Waitrovich had performed solidly in his first three years on the team including a runner-up finish at the 1980 NIC golf championship, two NIC all-conference team selections as well as being named to the NAIA District 13 all-district team in 1980. However, he was nearly always overshadowed by the play of Kolquist. He responded by leading the team as medalist to victory at the Mankato State Invitational as well as winning the NIC individual title while the team came in second. The Bulldogs then claimed their third straight NAIA District 13 team title. The victory earned UMD an automatic bid to the NAIA national tournament but an NCAA Division II at-large invitation was accepted instead. Waitrovich finished 12th individually at the NCAA tournament and received All-American second team honors. The rest of the team, however, finished down the pack and the Bulldogs placed 10th among 11 teams.\nThe 1982-83 team continued UMD's winning ways. Led by sophomores Reed Kolquist and John Spreiter, the Bulldogs captured the NIC title outdistancing second place Winona State by a conference record of 47 strokes. Reed Kolquist was the NIC individual medalist. The team also won the NAIA District 13 title for the fourth straight year (by 25 strokes) with Spreiter, Kolquist and Jerry Kirby finishing in the top three positions respectively. Earning a trip to the NAIA national tournament, UMD again chose to instead accept an NCAA Division II spot. Because of their dominant play, the team had expectations of a high finish at nationals but placed a disappointing 14th. However, both Kolquist and Spreiter were selected to the NCAA Division II Honorable Mention team.\nWith only two seniors graduating from the prior year's team, UMD was in good position to continue its winning ways for the 1983-84 season. In five tournaments leading up the NIC Conference championship, the Bulldogs finished ahead of 39 division teams and behind only two. However, UMD was upset by Bemidji State to finished second for the NIC conference title. In March 1984, coach George Fisher resigned from UMD to become the head men's basketball coach at Cal Poly Pamona and James “Butch” Kuronen took over the helm of the golf team. Now fully committed to an NCAA Division II pathway, the team elected to not participate at the NAIA District 13 tournament that spring and would not return for another three years. In its sixth straight NCAA Division II appearance, UMD was looking to break through to a top three finish. But in a repeat of the year before, the Bulldogs again finished in 14th place and Reed Kolquist and John Spreiter were named to their second consecutive NCAA Division II Honorable Mention team.\nThe 1984-85 team entered the season as a co-favorite with Bemidji State to take the NIC title. The championship held at UMD's home course Northland Country Club saw the Bulldogs take back the team title, while John Spreiter took medalist honors for the tournament and teammate Scott Rauvola finished 2nd. Going into the spring portion of the season saw a strong UMD team get stronger with the addition of Kyle Anderson, a transfer from Division I North Texas State University and former two-time Minnesota Class AA high school state champion from Duluth East. Again eschewing the NAIA District 13 tournament, the team won its first tournament coming out of the winter break but uncharacteristically struggled through the remainder of its spring schedule playing just well enough to earn its 7th straight NCAA Division II berth. Competing against the likes of future U.S. Open winner Lee Janzen, UMD finished in 11th place with John Spreiter earning All-American Second Team honors and Kyle Anderson All-American Honorable Mention.\nDespite losing Reed Kolquist and John Spreiter to graduation and with only one senior, the 1985-1986 UMD team was still potent. After finishing well in several tournaments, UMD won its second straight NIC title. Kyle Anderson took home medalist honors and teammates Scott Rauvola and Larry Pajari finished 2nd and 3rd respectively. However, UMD's excellent fall golf did not carry over to the spring season as the Bulldogs were never able to finish well enough to garner an eighth consecutive NCAA invite. However, Kyle Anderson earned an individual invite to the national tournament finishing in a tie for 26th which was good enough to earn him All-American Third Team honors.\nEnd of the program.\nAfter nine straight years of qualifying the team or individuals for national tournament play, it was probably inevitable that UMD would have a period of falloff. Not that the 1986-87 and 1987-88 seasons were poor: The Bulldogs would finish second in conference in each of the two years and Paul Paoletti took medalist honors at the NIC in 1987. Returning to NAIA play for the first time in four years, the team finished second at the District 13 tournament in 1987. However, the Bulldogs did not earn a place at either the NCAA or NAIA national tournaments so anything less was a disappointment.\nThe Bulldogs returned to form for the 1988-89 campaign. Although the team finished second at the NIC, senior Joe Riekena closed his collegiate career by taking home medalist honors at the conference tournament and becoming the 12th (and final) Bulldog to win an individual conference title. At the NAIA District 13 tournament, UMD captured the title – the first in six years – and earned a place at the NAIA national tournament held in Bay City, Michigan. Having no player with national tournament exposure, the inexperience of the team showed with the Bulldogs placing 26th at the halfway point and missing the cut with only the top 17 teams advancing to the final two rounds.\nThe 1989-90 season saw the Bulldogs in a reprise of the prior year. A second-place finish at the conference championship would be the fourth in a row for the Bulldogs. However, the team would capture its 6th NAIA District 13 championship and earn its 17th national tournament berth (including three NAIA tournaments - 1956, 1961 and 1963 - for which it qualified but did not appear). Again, the Bulldogs missed the team cut but freshman Greg Tuttle – a former Minnesota Class A High School golf champion – individually qualified for the final two rounds and finished 16th which earned him NAIA All-American Honorable Mention. Also, Paul Shromoff was named NAIA Scholar-Athlete in golf.\nThe 1990-91 season would be the last for the UMD golf program. A young squad with only three returning players, two being sophomores, the team played inconsistently and could never string together consecutive competitive rounds. This was evident at the NIC conference championship that October at which the team finished in third place - its worst conference showing in 13 years. The spring season saw the Bulldogs play in five events including the NCAA Division II District 4 tournament held at Purdue University in West Lafayette Indiana. Much like the fall season before, the squad did not fare well although Greg Tuttle took home medalist honors at the Milwaukee Invitational. Having learned the day before the NAIA District 13 qualifying tournament that the golf program would be cut for the 1991-92 school year, the Bulldog golfers were determined to win the District 13 championship and finish up the program with a final NAIA national appearance. However, according to freshman Mike McDonald, the team was “trying too hard instead of just letting it happen” and finished third. Coach Butch Kuronen laid blame for the team's play on the news of the program being eliminated.\nConfronted with a $130,000 revenue reduction for the 1991-92 school year, the UMD athletic department dropped both men's and women's golf (along with cross country skiing) from its 18-sport program. According to Athletic Director Bruce McLeod, the program was too expensive given the number of participants. Despite being one of the University's oldest and most successful athletic programs, men's golf was always low on the list of UMD athletic priorities with a budget to match.\nAt the time of its elimination, the men's golf team had earned more national tournament appearances than UMD hockey, football and basketball programs combined. After finishing in 5th place at the 1981 NCAA Division II championship, coach George Fisher remarked that: \"A team that has to play in Northern Minnesota and a team that plays without athletic scholarships and still finishes only eight shots out of second place - well, that is just a great accomplishment.\"\nTop ten national finishes.\nTeam\nIndividual\nIndividual conference champions.\nMinnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference\nNorthern Intercollegiate Conference\n+ Lost medalist honors in playoff\nNAIA District 13 champions.\n+ Lost medalist honors in playoff\nTeam conference, district and national finishes.\nTCC = State Teacher's College Conference of Minnesota\nMIAC = Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference\nNIC = Northern Intercollegiate Conference\nDNP = Did not play\nDNQ = Did not qualify\nCUT = Missed the half-way cut"

        "title": "Sean Davis (American football)",
        "text": "Sean Eric Davis Jr. (born October 23, 1993) is an American football safety who is a free agent. He played college football at Maryland and was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He has also been a member of the Washington Football Team, Indianapolis Colts, Cincinnati Bengals, New England Patriots, and Houston Roughnecks.\nEarly years.\nDavis attended Maret School in Washington, D.C. As a senior, he recorded 87 tackles and three interceptions on defense and ran for 823 yards, seven rushing touchdowns, 601 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns on offense. He received offers from North Carolina, Boston College, and Connecticut but ultimately chose to attend the University of Maryland to play football.\nCollege career.\nDavis played at Maryland from 2012 to 2015. He played safety his first three years before moving to cornerback prior to his senior year. During his career he started 40 of 50 games, recording 319 tackles, five interceptions and 2.5 sacks.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nAfter he performed well at the NFL combine, many NFL analysts projected Davis to be a second or third round selection in the 2016 NFL Draft. Multiple teams and scouts had Davis listed as a safety instead of cornerback because of his size, athleticism, and tendency to give up big plays in coverage. It was reported up to 19 NFL teams were interested in him and he had visits with New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was invited to the NFL Combine and completed all of the combine and positional drills. Davis was satisfied enough with his combine performance and opted to only participate in positional drills at Maryland's Pro Day.\nPittsburgh Steelers (first stint).\n2016.\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers selected Davis in the second round (58th overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. Davis was the third safety drafted in 2016.\nOn May 20, 2016, the Steelers signed Davis to a four-year, $4.08 million contract with a $1.17 million signing bonus and $1.80 million guaranteed. Davis began training camp developing as the Steelers' future strong safety and competed against Robert Golden for the starting role, but was forced to play the nickel position after Senquez Golson suffered a foot injury. He was the best option with fellow rookie Artie Burns also out due to an injury. On September 12, 2016, the Steelers started Davis at their nickel back position for the first game of the season against the Washington Redskins. He finished with a total of four tackles in the Steelers' victory and became the first rookie defensive back to start a season opener for the Steelers since Chad Scott in 1997. During a Week 3 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, he finished with a total of seven combined tackles and also suffered an injury to his back during the game. On October 9, 2016, he was again the Steelers' starting nickel back against the New York Jets and would finish the game with four solo tackles and six total. Davis was demoted from the nickelback position in favor for Artie Burns after playing in the slot for the first five games of the season. On November 13, 2016, Davis made a critical penalty when he grabbed the face mask of Cowboys tight end Jason Witten with less than 30 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The 15-yard penalty put the Cowboys, who were down 28–30 at the time, in field goal range and they would score the game-winning touchdown the very next play. He later explained he was attempting to pry the ball but when Witten ducked he accidentally grabbed his facemask. Davis finished the 35–30 loss with a combined five tackles.\nThe following week, Davis replaced Robert Golden as the Steelers' starting strong safety in a victory over the Cleveland Browns and finished the game with three combined tackles and a pass deflection. Four days later, Davis made his second consecutive start at strong safety against the Indianapolis Colts. Late in the second quarter, Davis saved a go-ahead touchdown after stopping quarterback Scott Tolzien at the one-yard line after he attempted to dive into the end zone. The next play resulted in an incomplete pass on fourth down. The Steelers went on to win the game 28–7, playing every defensive snap, and improved their record to 6–5. The next game, Davis recorded four solo tackles, three assisted tackles, and intercepted his first career pass off of New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning. The Steelers went on to defeat the Giants 24–14. On January 1, 2017, Davis made a season-high eight solo tackles, an assisted tackle, his first career fumble recovery, and sacked Robert Griffin III for the first solo sack of his career in a 27–24 overtime victory over the Cleveland Browns. Davis finished his rookie season with 70 combined tackles, five pass deflections, sacks, and an interception while starting nine games and playing in all 16 games. On December 29, 2016, the Pittsburgh Steelers announced that Davis was the winner of their Rookie of the Year award.\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished first in the American Football Conference (AFC) North with an 11–5 record. On January 8, 2017, Davis started his first career playoff game and made four combined tackles in a 30–12 victory over the Miami Dolphins in the AFC wildcard game. The following week, he recorded three tackles in the Steelers' 18–16 win against the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Divisional round. He was also fined $24,000 for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Kansas City Chiefs' wide receiver Chris Conley. The Pittsburgh Steelers were eliminated by the eventual Super Bowl LI Champions, the Patriots, in the AFC Championship. Davis made nine combined tackles and a sack on Tom Brady during the 36–17 loss.\n2017.\nDuring the offseason, Davis had surgery to repair a torn labrum he suffered while making a tackle in a Week 3 loss against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nHead coach Mike Tomlin stated Davis would remain the starting strong safety to begin the regular season. He recorded three solo tackles during the Steelers' 21–18 season-opening victory over the Browns. On November 16, 2017, Davis made three combined tackles, deflected a pass, and made an interception off of Marcus Mariota during a 40–17 win over the Tennessee Titans. In Week 14, he collected a season-high 12 combined tackles and an interception in the Steelers' 39–38 win against the Baltimore Ravens. On December 31, 2017, Davis collected three combined tackles, deflected a pass, and made a sack and interception on quarterback DeShone Kizer in the Steelers' 28–24 victory. He finished the season with 92 combined tackles (71 solo), eight pass deflections, three interceptions, and a sack in 16 games and 16 starts.\nOn January 14, 2018, Davis made 12 combined tackles in a 45–42 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Divisional round. Pro Football Focus gave Davis an overall grade of 35.5 for the season and his grade ranked 85th among all safeties in 2017.\n2018.\nOn March 29, 2018, Davis changed his jersey number from No. 28 to No. 21, reverting to his college number after 21 became available due to Joe Haden changing to No. 23. Throughout training camp, Davis competed to be a starting safety against Morgan Burnett and Terrell Edmunds. Head coach Mike Tomlin named Davis the starting free safety to begin the regular season after the role became vacant after the Steelers released Mike Mitchell. He started alongside Terrell Edmunds for the majority of the 2018 season. On November 4, 2018, Davis collected a season-high nine solo tackles during a 23–16 win at the Ravens in Week 9. In Week 16, he made five solo tackles, a season-high two pass deflections, and made his only interception of the season during a 31–28 loss at the New Orleans Saints. Davis was inactive for the Steelers' Week 17 win against the Cincinnati Bengals due to a quadriceps injury. He finished the season with 80 combined tackles (59 solo), seven pass deflections, and one interception in 15 games and 15 starts. Davis received an overall grade of 69.8 from Pro Football Focus, which ranked as the 39th best grade among all safeties in 2018.\n2019.\nDavis entered the 2019 season as the Steelers starting free safety. In Week 2, Davis suffered a shoulder injury and was placed on injured reserve on September 17, 2019.\nWashington Football Team.\nOn March 23, 2020, Davis signed a one-year contract with the Washington Football Team, then known as the Redskins. He was released on September 5, 2020.\nPittsburgh Steelers (second stint).\nOn September 6, 2020, Davis was re-signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nOn April 1, 2021, Davis signed a one-year deal with the Indianapolis Colts. He was released on August 31, 2021 and re-signed to the practice squad the next day. He appeared in one regular season game and was released on September 14.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nOn September 15, 2021, Davis was signed to the Bengals practice squad. He was released on October 5.\nNew England Patriots.\nOn October 13, 2021, Davis was signed to the Patriots practice squad. Davis was elevated to the active roster on December 6 for the team's week 13 against the Buffalo Bills, and reverted to the practice squad after the game.\nHouston Roughnecks.\nThe Houston Roughnecks selected Davis in the fifth round of the 2023 XFL Supplemental Draft on January 1, 2023. He was placed on the Reserve List on April 4, 2023. The Roughnecks brand was transferred to the Houston Gamblers when the XFL and USFL merged to create the United Football League (UFL).\nPersonal life.\nDavis was born to Sean and Lisa Davis and is also trilingual. He speaks English, French, and Chinese and majored in communication during his time at Maryland. On February 26, 2018, it was reported that Davis was named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit for allegedly posting a Snapchat video that led to the bullying of a teen at school. The suit alleges Davis recorded his visit to a Chick-fil-A location in Cranberry, Pennsylvania and made comments about an employee saying, \"Chick-fil-A got little kids... This kid like eight-year old. No wonder why the lines be so long at Chick-fil-A.\" The lawsuit calls Davis' actions \"intentional and/or reckless.\" and \"extreme and outrageous\" and also includes claims for libel, cyberbullying, intentional infliction of emotional distress and slander. Davis' attorney denied the claims and stated his comments were directed at the chain itself."

        "text": "Jacob Glarbjerg Larsen (born May 5, 1997) is a Danish former basketball player. A 6’11’’ (210 cm) post player, he joined the Gonzaga University Bulldogs for the 2016–17 season, but did not make his debut with the team until the 2017–18 season due to a knee injury suffered in a 2016 preseason practice.\nYouth career.\nBorn in Holte, Larsen started his career in the youth teams at Virum Basketball Klub in the northern outskirts of Copenhagen, and was promoted to the club’s men’s team in 2013. He played in the second-tier league in Denmark with the Virum Vipers. In 2014, he helped lead Virum to winning the Danish 1st Division Regular Season title and a trip to the semifinals.\nIn September 2015, Larsen signed with SISU Copenhagen. Larsen chose SISU since he wanted to play in the best league in Denmark and his familiarity to people from the Danish National Team, including the head coach, as well as many of the squad's youth players. Larsen was hampered by inflammation in his knee, but SISU was sympathetic to his recovery time. Larsen wanted to spend one-year training with professional competition before leaving for the United States to play college basketball after the summer of 2016. In October 2015, it was reported that Larsen was expected to miss the whole season with SISU due to injury.\nRecruiting.\nIn April 2014, Larsen announced his dreams of dominating the second best league in Denmark, then moving on to exerting his dominance in the best Danish league, and then playing college basketball, with hopes of displaying his talent in the NBA someday. In February 2015, while participating in the first-ever Basketball without Borders Global Camp in Manhattan, New York, Larsen was singled out as one of the top performers of the camp. He announced that he planned to enroll in college in 2016, and that Duke, Maryland, and George Washington were among his top suitors.\nIn October 2015, Larsen flew to the United States to take official visits to Maryland, Gonzaga, and Marquette. After he joined fellow Gonzaga commit Zach Collins in his recruiting trip to Spokane for the Zags' annual pre-season player scrimmage called Kraziness in the Kennel, he verbally committed to Gonzaga in November 2015. Larsen chose the Zags due to their successful track record with international players, especially those from Europe, like himself. He signed with Gonzaga during the early signing period later that week.\nCollege career.\nLarsen was sidelined the entire 2016-17 campaign with a knee injury, which he sustained in practice. In the 2017-18 season, Larsen saw the court in 34 contests, averaging 2.9 points as well as 2.7 rebounds a contest in 8.4 minutes per game. He left the Gonzaga men’s basketball team in October 2018 to focus on school, remaining on scholarship.\nInternational career.\nIn 2012, Larsen was selected to play on Denmark’s U16 national team at the 2012 European Championships (Division B), where he averaged 12.1 points, 8.5 boards as well as 1.9 blocks per contest.\nThe following year, he was the main man on Denmark’s U16 squad that captured gold at the 2013 European Championships (Division B). He scored 20.0 points and pulled down 12.1 rebounds while blocking 4.0 shots a game en route to Eurobasket.com All-European Championships U16 Division B Best Player honors.\nIn February and March 2015, Larsen played in his first Adidas Next Generation Tournament in Belgrade for the U18 Vaerlose BBK squad and was named as one of the stars to watch in the event. He averaged 16.7 points, 6.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.7 blocks, 1 steal, and 60.6 percent from the field.\nPersonal.\nHis older brother Rasmus Larsen who was also a basketball player died in May 2015 at the age of 20."

        "text": "The South American Gymnastics Confederation (CONSUGI) organizes South American Gymnastics Championships in different disciplines of gymnastics: men's and women's artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, trampoline and tumbling, as well as aerobic gymnastics.\nHistory.\nThe first edition of the South American Artistic Gymnastics Championships was held in 1957 in Buenos Aires. It was only the third time a major artistic gymnastics tournament was started in the Americas, after the gymnastics competitions at the Central American and Caribbean Games, first held in 1946, and the gymnastics competitions at the Pan American Games, first held in 1951. At the inaugural edition, in 1957, only men's events were competed. Women's events would be competed for the first time at the second edition of the championships, in 1969.\nIn 1978, the first edition of the South American Games, then titled the \"Southern Cross Games\", was held in La Paz, Bolivia. One of the sports contested at the tournament was artistic gymnastics, and this served as the continental championships for that year. However, that same year, another edition of the South American Championships was held in Peru only ten days after the conclusion of the gymnastics events at the 1978 Southern Cross Games. In 1982, the gymnastics events at Southern Cross Games also served as the South American Gymnastics Championships for that year. This also seemed to be true in 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998 and 2002. However, in recent years, the gymnastics competitions at the South American Games seem to have been retroactively considered independent events by CONSUGI, since the 2021 South American Artistic Gymnastics Championships are officially considered the 18th edition of the championships.\nIn 1984, the first South American Championships in rhythmic gymnastics was held in Londrina, Brazil. However, the event was organized for athletes to represent clubs, instead of national committees. The first known event in rhythmic gymnastics where athletes represented their nations was held in 1988 in Rosario, Argentina. Similar to the stance adopted concerning the artistic gymnastics championships, rhythmic gymnastics events at the 1990, 1994, 1998 and 2002 South American Games were once considered part of the South American Championships.\nSenior South American Championships have also been organized for aerobic gymnastics and trampoline gymnastics. To date, South American championships in acrobatic gymnastics and in parkour, two other gymnastics disciplines recognized by the International Gymnastics Federation, have not been created."

        "text": "A total of 10 teams in each tournament (5 athletes per team) qualified for a quota of 100 athletes in curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics. A further 8 mixed doubles pairs qualified for a total of 16 athletes. Therefore, a total of 116 athletes qualified in total to compete in the curling competitions.\nQualification system.\nQualification to the curling tournaments at the Winter Olympics was determined through two methods. Nations qualified teams by earning qualification points from performances at the 2016 and 2017 World Curling Championships. Teams also qualified through an Olympic qualification event which was held in December 2017. Seven nations qualified teams via World Championship qualification points, while two nations qualified through the qualification event (nations who competed at the 2014 and/or 2015 Worlds and did not score points were also eligible to compete at this tournament). As host nation, South Korea qualified teams automatically, thus making a total of ten teams per gender in the curling tournaments. For the mixed doubles competition, the top seven ranked teams earning qualification points from performances at the 2016 and 2017 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship qualified along with hosts South Korea.\nQualification points.\nThe qualification points are allotted based on the nations' final rankings at the World Championships. The points are distributed as follows:\nNote: Scotland, England and Wales all compete separately in international curling. By an agreement between the curling federations of those three home nations, only Scotland can score Olympic qualification points on behalf of Great Britain.\nQualification event.\nAt the Olympic qualifying event, which was held 5–10 December 2017 in Plzeň, Czech Republic, the top two teams in the event qualified their nations to participate in the Olympics. The qualification event was open to any nations that earned qualification points at the 2016 or 2017 World Curling Championships (as listed above) or participated at the 2014 or 2015 World Curling Championships (the Czech men's team, the Norway and the Latvia women's team).\nNational qualifying events.\nSome countries select their teams through trial qualification tournaments."

Starting at the 6th, Justin Rose recorded three consecutive birdies to tie; with bogeys by García at the 10th and 11th, Rose went ahead by two shots. At the 13th, García was forced to take a drop when his tee shot found the trees, but was able to get up and down to save par while Rose missed his birdie attempt. García made birdie at the 14th to get within one and hit his approach to the par-5 15th to . After converting the eagle attempt, he once again tied Rose, who made birdie. On the par-3 16th, both hit approaches to within , and Rose made his birdie from 7 feet, while García missed his gimme three-footer.

Matt Kuchar birdied three consecutive holes on his final nine, then made a hole-in-one at 16 to equal the lowest score of the round with 67 and tied Pieters. Rickie Fowler began the round a shot out of the lead, but seven bogeys yielded a 76 (+4) and dropped him to eleventh, while 2015 champion Jordan Spieth, two back at the start of the round, shot 75 and tied Fowler. (He was six-over for the round and then birdied three of the last four.) Charley Hoffman carded 41 on the final nine for 78 and tied for 22nd place.\nAfter García took his drop on 13, some TV viewers reported the possibility that he caused his ball to move while removing some pine straw near his ball. Prior to the conclusion of the round Masters Officials determined there was no penalty. Per Rule 18-2 (Decision 18/4) even if high definition TV camera evidence shows movement, there is no penalty if it is deemed that the movement was not reasonably discernible to the naked eye at the time.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;\nPlayoff.\nThe sudden-death playoff began at the par four 18th; Rose's drive found the trees and he was forced to chip out.

Rose missed the putt, giving García two putts to win the championship, but he converted the birdie to win his first major championship. The win came in García's 19th Masters appearance and 74th major, the most by any player before their first title."

For only the fourth time in the tournament’s 37-year history, all four of the number one seeds made it to the Final Four (1989, 2012, 2015).\nTennessee continued its record streak of making every NCAA women's basketball tournament at 37 consecutive appearances. Connecticut also continued its record streak of 11 consecutive Final Four appearances.\nTournament procedure.\nPending any changes to the format, a total of 64 teams will enter the 2016 tournament. 32 automatic bids shall be awarded to each program that wins their conference's tournament. The remaining 36 bids are \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. The tournament is split into four regional tournaments, and each regional has teams seeded from 1 to 16, with the committee ostensibly making every region as comparable to the others as possible. The top-seeded team in each region plays the #16 team, the #2 team plays the #15, etc. (meaning where the two seeds add up to 17, that team will be assigned to play another).\nThe basis for the subregionals returned to the approach used between 1982 and 2002; the top sixteen teams, as chosen in the bracket selection process, hosted the first two rounds on campus.\nThe selection committee will also seed the entire field from 1 to 64.\n2018 NCAA tournament schedule and venues.\nThe first two rounds, also referred to as the subregionals, were played at the sites of the top 16 seeds, as was done in 2016 and 2017.

Then a year later in 2004 it would expand to Japan. The organisation's activities have provoked controversy and have been criticized by members of other faiths.

        "text": "Killer Instinct World Cup is an annual fighting game tournament held in Texas, specifically focusing on the 2013 \"Killer Instinct\" reboot. The event's first incarnation was in January 2016 which featured \"Killer Instinct\" with a total of 32 qualifiers. The finals uses a double-elimination format and includes various tournaments as qualifiers such as EVO and Combo Breaker. \nHistory.\n2016 season.\nThe 2016 Killer Instinct World Cup Finals was announced by Ultra Arcade's Brandon Alexander in December 2014, which initially had a $10,000 prize pool with 16 qualifiers, but was eventually increased to a $30,000 prize pool with 32 qualifiers. Four last chance qualifying spots were held as well. The tournament was won by EVO 2015 Champion Jonathan \"Rico Suave\" Deleon, who primarily used Shadow Jago in the tournament, however used Omen against Matt Rebelo in Winner's Finals due to the lack of TJ Combo matchup experience and Glacius in Grand Finals as a hard counter to Lenin \"MyGod\" Castillo's Sabrewulf. The EVO 2014 Champion, Emmanuel \"CD Jr.\" Brito has notably tied for last, despite being seeded 3rd in the bracket.\nThe #1 player in points rankings Kenneth \"Bass\" Armas was notably upset in the first round of the tournament to one of the Last Chance qualifiers Joshua \"Waterhorses\" Vargas, while managing to blast through Loser's Bracket, while bowing out to FlipSid3 Tactics' Darnell \"Sleep\" Waller. However, one of the most unexpected placings was Canadian player Rebelo ending in 3rd place while being sent to Loser's by Rico Suave in Winner's Finals, followed by being eliminated by MyGod in a Loser's Finals runback from an early Winner's Bracket upset.\nKiller Instinct World Cup took place at the Fountain Bleu in San Antonio, Texas on January 30–31, 2016.\n2017 season.\nThe 2017 Killer Instinct World Cup was announced on April 5, 2016. The season would include more offline qualifiers than the previous season, as well as once again being a 32-man finals. In 2017, the KI World Cup issued a ban towards taunting and teabagging, following its frequent practice by NuckleDu in Street Fighter V. This would spark controversy from the fighting game community with members such as Echo Fox pro SonicFox and Iron Galaxy Studios dev Adam \"Keits\" Heart speaking about their disdain regarding the ban. Lab monster Javits used Daigo Umehara's playstyle from EVO Moment #37 as a reference to mention that enforcing such rule would be impossible. The teabagging ban would later be revoked following the controversy surrounding the rule, while there is still zero tolerance policies for threats and sexual harassment.\nThe event took place from March 10 to 12 of 2017. The Kilgore DLC raised more than $50,000 towards the 2018 season's prize pool."

It was also confirmed that coach Rassie Erasmus would remain in charge for the next season after much speculation that he would return to South-Africa.\nOn 4 May, Tyler Bleyendaal was named as the Munster Player of the Year at an awards ceremony in Cork.
