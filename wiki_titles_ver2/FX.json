        "text": "The UAAP Season 81 basketball tournaments were the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) basketball tournaments for the 2018–19 school year.\nFormer NU Bulldogs athletic director Junel Baculi replaced Atty. Rebo Saguisag as commissioner for the season's basketball tournaments on August 28, 2018. Former Vietnam Basketball Association commissioner Tonichi Pujante was also appointed as assistant commissioner.\nThe senior men's and women's tournaments began on September 8, 2018 while the games of the juniors' division began on November 11.\nThe Ateneo Blue Eagles and the NU Lady Bulldogs successfully defended their championships this season. Ateneo finished first after the elimination round, followed by Adamson. UP, FEU and La Salle finished tied for third, with UP getting the #3 seed due to tiebreakers. FEU defeated La Salle in the playoff for the #4 seed, and were beaten by Ateneo in the semifinals. Adamson lost out in the semifinals again, losing to UP, who have never been in the semifinals since 1998. Qualifying to its first UAAP Finals since 1986, UP was swept by Ateneo in the latter's second consecutive (and tenth overall) UAAP title. Thirdy Ravena was named Finals MVP, after scoring a still-standing UAAP Finals record of 38 points in the title-clinching Game 2.\nThe NU Lady Bulldogs won all elimination round games, qualifying to the Finals outright. FEU emerged through the stepladder playoffs that also involved UST and Adamson as NU's Finals opponent, but were still swept by the Lady Bulldogs. NU won its fifth consecutive title, all unbeaten seasons, for a still-standing league record of 80–0 in the last five tournaments.\nIn the Juniors' Division, the NU Bullpups and the Ateneo Blue Eaglets finished the elimination round with the top two seeds. NU eliminated the Adamson Baby Falcons, the only team that defeated them in the eliminations, while Ateneo defeated FEU Baby Tamaraws. In the rematch of last year's finals, the Bullpups defeated the defending champions, by winning all two Finals games. The Bullpups won their fourth title since 2011.\nTeams.\nAll eight member universities of the UAAP fielded teams in all three divisions.\nVenues.\nThe Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay and the Smart Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City were the primary venues for the men's tournament, and the venues for the finals series for the women's tournament. The Filoil Flying V Centre in San Juan and the Blue Eagle Gym in Quezon City were the alternate venues for the men's and women's tournament, respectively and the main venue for the women's and juniors' tournaments.\nIn the second round of the men's tournament, two game days were scheduled at the Ynares Center in Antipolo.\nMen's tournament.\nElimination round.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;\nMatch-up results.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's match-up results\" /&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Men's match-up results\" /&gt;\nScores.\nResults on top and to the right of the dashes are for first-round games; those to the bottom and to the left of it are second-round games.\nFourth–seed playoff.\nThe Tamaraws and the Green Archers last met in the fourth seed playoff in 2012 in which La Salle won. The winner faces Ateneo in the semifinals while the loser gets eliminated.\nPrior to the game both teams were having ups and downs into this match-up, after losing their first four games in the second round FEU manage to win their last three games to salvage their season, while La Salle sitting as the #4 and #3 throughout the season lost their last two games that denied them a chance for the last twice-to-beat advantage and a slot in the semifinals. In the first quarter, the Tamaraws were leading already by seven points, 17–10, towards the end of that period but the Green Archers countered it with an 11–2 run to take the lead by two points, 21–19. An Axel Iñigo buzzer beater 3-point shot regained the lead for FEU as they took a single-point lead. In the second quarter, both teams exchanged blows but La Salle took matters the most to lead by two points at halftime, 38–36. In the third quarter, FEU pounced La Salle into a corner with a five-point lead but La Salle cut the deficit by three points, 54–51, heading into the final period. In the fourth quarter, the Tamaraws were trying to pull away while the Green Archers were trying to catch up. La Salle eventually crept up tying the game and regained the lead. FEU's Prince Orizu fouled out of the game as Barkley Eboña returned to the game despite suffering from cramps earlier. La Salle took advantage of it as they led by four points towards the last two minutes of the game. However, FEU went within striking distance going toe to toe against La Salle cutting the lead by a single basket. The Green Archers swung back the lead by four, 70–66. with less than a minute remaining in the game. In an inbound play, Jasper Parker passed the ball to Ken Tuffin and converted his jumper and cut La Salle's lead by two points with less than 40 seconds remaining. Off a timeout, La Salle inbounded a pass but turned the ball over as it paved the way for FEU to steal the game from them. After the timeout, FEU had the possession with Parker holding the ball as he found a wide open Arvin Tolentino who shot a three-pointer to take the lead for FEU, 71–70, with 3.1 seconds remaining. In La Salle's final possession, Aljun Melecio found an open Leonard Santillan to win the game for them but eventually he was blocked by three FEU defenders winning the Tamaraws the game. Arvin Tolentino, who had a season plagued with controversy, led the scoring for FEU with 15 points with three three-pointers made including the last shot that sealed the game for them, while Barkley Eboña, one of the unsung heroes for FEU, finished with a double-double of 12 points and 16 rebounds.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;*Game went into overtime.&lt;section end=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nAteneo and Adamson had the twice to beat advantage. Ateneo qualified for its fifth consecutive Final Four appearance, and the second consecutive year where they are the first seed. Adamson, the second seed, was in its third consecutive appearance, and improved on last year's third seed. Third seed UP qualified for its first Final Four appearance in 21 years, last appearing in the playoffs in 1997. FEU advanced to the Final Four in its sixth consecutive season, the longest active streak.\n(1) Ateneo vs. (4) FEU.\nAteneo had the twice-to-beat advantage. Ateneo has faced FEU in the semifinals in three consecutive seasons where the Blue Eagles won the last two series.\nAteneo started off with all cylinders on fire highlighted by two consecutive dunks by Thirdy Ravena to start the game on an 8–0 start despite FEU finally converted their shots with two consecutive three-pointers to cut the deficit by four points. However, the Tamaraws never had a chance to catch up against the Blue Eagles as they were blown out by as many as 31 points towards the end of the 3rd quarter. Ateneo outscored FEU in every quarter except in the last period as they didn't needed to use their twice to beat advantage after going wire to wire in the past few seasons. They finally marched on to their third consecutive Finals appearance and twelfth overall in the Final Four era.\n(2) Adamson vs. (3) UP.\nAdamson had the twice-to-beat advantage. The Falcons and the Fighting Maroons were in their first playoff match-up against each other. The winner of the series would be the seventh team to qualify in the Finals in the Final Four era.\nIn the first game of the series, both teams exchanged leads in the 1st half with UP taking the 1st quarter while Adamson taking the 2nd to nudge by a point at halftime. But the Fighting Maroons outscored the Falcons in the 3rd quarter 26–14 to take an 11-point lead heading into the 4th quarter. Adamson refused to lose as they countered them with a 26-11 scoring run to lead by 4 but UP countered it back with a 6–0 run of their own to take a 71-69 heading into regulation. A costly foul by UP sends Sean Manganti to the free throw line as he converted both of his free throws. UP called a timeout with 3.7 seconds remaining in the game to strategize the play as Juan Gómez de Liaño from the inbound found an open Bright Akhuetie to seal the game for them as they forced a rubber match.\nIn the second game, the Fighting Maroons kept their guns ablaze as they led by ten points in the first quarter and nine points at half time. Their lead later ballooned already by 16 points, 60–44, but the Falcons countered it with their own scoring with a 23–4 run to take the lead at the end of the third quarter, 67–64. Both teams exchanged leads towards regulation as UP led by three points with less than ten seconds remaining, 78–75. Jerom Lastimosa shot a three-point shot to tie the game once again at 78-all with UP in ball possession. Paul Desiderio missed a shot as the game went into overtime. In the extra period Adamson took a six-point lead already, 84–78, with 2:39 remaining in overtime, but UP scored 6 straight points to tie once again at 84-all with 58.2 seconds remaining. Adamson's top gunner Jerrick Ahanmisi went down with cramps after a contested layup against Bright Akhuetie was waved off by the referee, instead calling it a foul on JD Tungcab on the floor. Ahanmisi missed the remainder of the game. Two free throws were awarded to Adamson because they were already in the penalty. Jonathan Espeleta came in to take the shots in place of Jerrick Ahanmisi but split his freethrows to lead by a point. A three-point shot by Paul Desiderio swang back the lead to UP 87–85 with forty seconds remaining but a foul by UP sent another Adamson player back into the free throw line and tied for one last time at 87-all. Desiderio's jumper over Sean Manganti however put UP back on top 89–87 with 6.6 seconds remaining with Adamson calling its last time out. The ball was given to Jerom Lastimosa to win the game but he missed a three-point shot that would give Adamson the victory, as UP won the game and entered the Finals for the first time since 1986.\nFinals.\nThe best-of-three finals began on December 1. It would be the first Finals match-up between the two teams. This is the first time that UP has made it to the finals since 1986, while defending champions Ateneo were in its third consecutive Finals appearance. The winner qualified for the 2018 PCCL National Collegiate Championship.\nBroadcast notes.\nABS-CBN Sports is the official broadcaster of the UAAP Season 81 Men's Basketball games.\nWomen's tournament.\nElimination round.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=\"Women's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Women's standings\" /&gt;\nMatch-up results.\n&lt;section begin=\"Women's match-up results\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Women's match-up results\" /&gt;\nScores.\nResults on top and to the right of the dashes are for first-round games; those to the bottom and to the left of it are second-round games.\nFourth–seed playoff.\nThis is a one-game playoff.

        "title": "Amos Thomas (basketball)",
        "text": "Amos Thomas (November 14, 1949 - November 4, 2005) was American collegiate and professional basketball player. He was a second round pick of the Buffalo Braves of the National Basketball Association in the 1971 NBA draft.\nCollege career.\nThe 1967 Oklahoma High School Player of the Year at Frederick A. Douglass High School, Thomas played college basketball for legendary Coach Henry Iba at Oklahoma State University, from 1967 to 1969. Playing on the freshman team, Thomas Averaged 30.9 points and 12.5 rebounds in 1967-1968. Playing Varsity the next season, he averaged 19.9 points and 7.0 rebounds in 1968-69.\nThomas was declared ineligible by the NCAA midway through the 1968-1969 season. The press release of January 24, 1969 read as follows: \"With a chance to climb back into the Big Eight basketball race, but the biggest news of the week in the conference came Thursday in a bombshell dropped at Stillwater. Okla. Oklahoma State University announced that sophomore star Amos Thomas is being declared ineligible for the remainder of the season, depriving Coach Henry Iba and the Cowboys of the Big Eight's No. 5 scorer. The 6-foot-7 Thomas from Oklahoma City, the school said, is being dropped because he played last spring in a benefit game in Oklahoma City in violation of Big Eight and National Collegiate Athletic Association rules. OSU said it had asked the Big Eight to investigate Thomas' participation in the game, a benefit for Dunjee High School's athletic program, and that the conference had prepared a report. \"Based on this information ... it has been determined that the participation in this game is a violation of NCAA and conference rules,\" the OSU disclosure said. \"Consequently, the university is declaring Thomas ineligible for the remainder of the basketball season.\" Thomas' future eligibility, the school said, would be appealed to the Big Eight and NCAA. Iba, whose Cowboys are off to a lackluster 1-2 start in the conference race, could not be\" reached Thursday night for comment. There is little doubt, however, that the loss of Thomas will seriously cripple any hopes OSU retained of contending for the Big Eight title. He was averaging 17.7 points and 7.7 rebounds a game in conference play. Thomas was picked to the first all-tournament team in the Big Eight pre-season tournament last month in Kansas City. OSU, which plays at Nebraska Monday night, has an 8-6 season record. Big Eight Commissioner Wayne Duke said Thursday night it will be determined at the regular conference meeting Feb. 28-March 1 in Kansas City whether the Cowboys will be forced to forfeit any of their victories. Duke said he had been asked to investigate the matter and had done so, conferring both with Thomas and Iba in the process. NCAA and Big Eight rules explicitly state that athletes shall not participate in any outside competition of any form.\"\nThomas then attended an NAIA school, Southwestern Oklahoma State University from 1969-1971, where he averaged 28.0 points in 1969-1970 and 24.3 in 1970-1971.\nOn December 3, 1968, Thomas set the Oklahoma State record for points in a debut game, with 27. The record was broken by James Anderson in 2007, with 29.\nProfessional career.\nThomas was drafted 26th overall by the Buffalo Braves in the 1971 NBA draft, but never appeared in an NBA season. Thomas was also drafted by the Memphis Tams of the American Basketball Association in the 4th Round of the 1971 ABA Draft. \nDeath.\nOn November 4, 2005 Thomas died of a stroke."

        "text": "The 2019 Masters Tournament was the 83rd edition of the Masters Tournament and the first of golf's four major championships in 2019, held between April 11 and 14 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\nTiger Woods won his fifth Green Jacket, and fifteenth major, by one stroke ahead of three runners-up. It left him one shy of Jack Nicklaus's record six Masters wins, and three short of his record eighteen major wins. At age 43, he became the eleventh oldest player to win a major, and the second oldest Masters winner, again only bettered by Nicklaus who won at age 46. It was 11 years after his last major win, the 2008 U.S. Open, and 14 years since his last Masters win beating the previous record of 13 years held by Gary Player. Due to the high profile of Woods, and his storied fall from the top of the game due to personal issues and injuries, the victory generated a large amount of publicity around the world, and is regarded as one of the great comebacks in the history of sports.\nWoods only emerged to lead the tournament in the final round, when Francesco Molinari, who had been leading the tournament, hit his ball into the water on the 12th hole and then again on the 15th after hitting a tree. It was the first time Woods won a major when not leading after the 54th hole.\nMost of the media, and the Las Vegas bookmakers, placed Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, and Dustin Johnson the pre-tournament favorites. McIlroy, the only player to finish in the top ten in the previous five Masters, came into the tournament as the Players champion and with seven consecutive top-10 PGA Tour finishes, but could only finish tied for 21st. Two-time runner-up Rose came in as world number one, but missed the cut. Johnson, who came in as world number two, and had a dominant win in the 2019 WGC-Mexico Championship, finished tied for second.\nA Masters record 65 players made the cut, including three amateurs. The leading amateur, and winner of the Silver Cup, was Norwegian Viktor Hovland who had qualified as the U.S. Amateur champion. He finished tied for 32nd at 3-under-par.\nIt was also the first time three players had shot 64 or better in a single round at the Masters, as Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, and Webb Simpson all shot 64 in the third round. This was partly attributed by the media to the soft conditions, lack of wind and accessible pin positions.\nField.\nThe Masters has the smallest field of the four major championships. Officially, the Masters remains an invitation event, but there is a set of qualifying criteria that determines who is included in the field. Each player is classified according to the first category by which he qualified, with other categories in which he qualified shown in parentheses.\nGolfers who qualify based solely on their performance in amateur tournaments (categories 6–10) must remain amateurs on the starting day of the tournament to be eligible to play.\nÁngel Cabrera, Fred Couples, Sergio García (17,18), Trevor Immelman, Zach Johnson (3), Bernhard Langer, Sandy Lyle, Phil Mickelson (15,16,17,18), Larry Mize, José María Olazábal, Patrick Reed (11,12,16,17,18), Charl Schwartzel, Adam Scott (14,17,18), Vijay Singh, Jordan Spieth (2,3,11,17,18), Bubba Watson (11,15,16,17,18), Mike Weir, Danny Willett, Tiger Woods (14,15,16,17,18), Ian Woosnam\nDustin Johnson (11,12,15,16,17,18), Martin Kaymer, Brooks Koepka (4,12,14,15,16,17,18)\nRory McIlroy (4,5,11,13,15,16,17,18), Francesco Molinari (13,15,16,17,18), Henrik Stenson (11,17,18)\nJason Day (5,15,16,17,18), Justin Thomas (15,16,17,18), Jimmy Walker\nKim Si-woo, Webb Simpson (15,16,17,18)\nDevon Bling (a), Viktor Hovland (a)\nJovan Rebula (a)\nTakumi Kanaya (a)\nKevin O'Connell (a)\nÁlvaro Ortiz (a)\nTony Finau (16,17,18), Rickie Fowler (15,16,17,18), Charley Hoffman, Marc Leishman (15,16,17,18), Louis Oosthuizen (17,18), Jon Rahm (14,16,17,18), Justin Rose (13,15,16,17,18), Cameron Smith (16,17,18)\nTommy Fleetwood (16,17,18)\nKevin Kisner (15,17,18), Xander Schauffele (15,16,17,18)\nStewart Cink\nKeegan Bradley (16,17,18), Paul Casey (16,17,18), Corey Conners, Bryson DeChambeau (16,17,18), J.

DeChambeau's round included six birdies in his final seven holes. One stroke behind was three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson with world number two Dustin Johnson and Ian Poulter two behind. Ten players were tied for 11th place at 70 (−2), including two of the pre-tournament favorites, Rickie Fowler and Tiger Woods. Defending champion Patrick Reed opened with 73 (+1). \nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 12, 2019\"\nFive players, all major champions, shared the lead at the end of the second day. First-round co-leader Brooks Koepka struggled early with two bogeys and a double, but recovered with three birdies to score 71 (−1). Jason Day and Francesco Molinari both scored 67 (−5), while Louis Oosthuizen shot the second best round of the day, 66 (−6). 2013 champion Adam Scott shot a 68 (−4) that included an eagle on the par-5 15th. In the group one back were Dustin Johnson, Tiger Woods, and Xander Schauffele, the last of whom shot a 65 (−7), the lowest round of the first two days. Woods, seeking his first major since the 2008 U.S. Open, made two front-nine bogeys in a round of 68 (−4). The other first round co-leader, Bryson DeChambeau, struggled with a 75 (+3) while Phil Mickelson followed up his opening round 67 (−5) with a 73 (+1). \nThere was a 29-minute delay during the afternoon because of thunderstorms in the area. Players remained on the course during the delay. The Masters has a \"10 shot rule\" whereby all players within 10 shots of the leaders make the 36-hole cut. With the leaders on 137 (−7) the cut was at 147 (+3). 65 players made the cut, the most since the cut was introduced in 1957. Four amateurs made the cut, the most since 1999. World number one Justin Rose was among the players to miss the cut, his first missed cut in his 14th appearance. Also missing the cut was 1991 Masters Champion Ian Woosnam, who announced his retirement as an active Masters competitor shortly after completion of play.\nAmateurs: \"Hovland (−1)\", \"Ortiz (E)\", \"Bling (+3)\", \"Kanaya (+3)\", O'Connell (+4), Rebula (+8)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 13, 2019\"\nFrancesco Molinari, part of a five-way tie for the lead at the start of the round, made four straight birdies from holes 12 to 15 on his way to a round of 66 (−6) and a two-shot lead after 54 holes. Tony Finau began his round with three straight birdies and made an eagle at the par-5 8th hole, tying the Masters record with 30 on the front-nine. He ended up with a round of 64 (−8), one off the course record, to jump into a tie for second. Four-time Masters champion Tiger Woods was one-over through 5 holes before birdieing 6 to 8, and after three more birdies on the back-nine shot 67 (−5) to join Finau at 11 under par. \nWebb Simpson and Patrick Cantlay also shot 64, the first time in Masters history three rounds of 64 or better were shot on the same day. The field combined to shoot 80-under for the round, the lowest in tournament history.\nAmateurs: Hovland (−2), Kanaya (−1), Ortiz (+1), Bling (+2)\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 14, 2019\"\nSummary.\nDue to the threat of thunderstorms forecast for the final day, the players were grouped into threesomes with tee times at 7:30 a.m. EDT off the first and tenth tees; the leaders teed off at 9:20 a.m.\nFrancesco Molinari held the lead throughout the first eleven holes before his tee shot at No. 12 came up well short and rolled back into Rae's Creek, leading to a double bogey and a tie with Tiger Woods at 11 under par. As the final threesome played No. 15, Molinari, Woods, Xander Schauffele, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka were tied at −12, but none of the latter three recorded another birdie and Molinari hit into the water again at the 15th before Woods birdied the hole. Woods doubled his advantage at 16, after his tee shot came within mere inches of going in before stopping three feet away from the cup, and made a tap-in par at 17. Needing only a bogey at the 18th to clinch the tournament, Woods chipped on and two-putted for the 5 and a 2-under-par 70 for the win. It was the first time that Woods had won a major championship when he was trailing after 54 holes. \nWoods became the fifth player to have a gap of over a decade between major wins. The others were Henry Cotton, Julius Boros, Hale Irwin and Ben Crenshaw.\nTimeline of key events.\n12.13pm\nMost of the leaders entered Amen corner in or around par for the round. Patrick Cantlay scored 3 under par through the first eleven holes to move up the leaderboard. Some commentators were suggesting Francesco Molinari was showing the same composure that enabled him to win the 2018 Open Championship.\n12.31pm:\nBrooks Koepka and Ian Poulter both find Rae's Creek on the 12th to score double bogeys. After a birdie on the 15th, backing up birdies on the 2nd, 7th, 8th, and 13th, Jason Day reaches 10 under par.\n12.39pm:\nBubba Watson makes an eagle on the 15th, to back up birdies on the 13th and 14th and charge up the leaderboard.\n12.47pm:\nThe leading group tee up on the par 3 12th, with the wind swirling. Francesco Molinari targets the flag and lands on the false front to roll back into Rae's Creek. Tiger Woods hits the centre of the green, after deciding not to go for the flag. Tony Finau goes for the flag, finding Rae's Creek as well. Molinari and Finau, like Koepka and Poulter before them, end up with a double bogey on the 12th, severely hurting their chances of victory.\n1.00pm:\nBrooks Koepka bounces back from his double bogey on 12, to eagle the 13th. Jon Rahm birdies the 16th to go four under for the round, and 10 under overall. Xander Schuffele birdies the 14th, and Patrick Cantlay eagles the 15th to move into joint lead.\n1.03pm:\nViktor Hovland of Norway wins the Silver Cup for low amateur. Hovland shot 71 to end the week at −3, one shot ahead of Mexican Alvaro Ortiz.\n1.07pm:\nTiger Woods and Francesco Molinari birdie the 13th to move into a share of the lead, whilst Patrick Cantlay bogeys the 16th to move out of the leading pack.\n1.18pm:\nJason Day birdies the last to finish with a 67, −11 overall, to set the clubhouse lead\n1.33pm:\nDustin Johnson birdies the 17th, to back up birdies on the 13th, 15th and 16th and join the leaders at 12 under par. Rickie Fowler also birdies the 17th, to back up birdies on the 13th, 14th and 15th and sit one shot behind.\n1.46pm:\nFrancesco Molinari drives into the trees on the 15th, and follows up with a misplaced lay-up. Playing from a tricky angle he hits an overhanging branch and his ball lands the pond guarding the front of the green. He ends up with a double bogey. Tiger Woods makes birdie to take sole lead of the tournament.\n2.22pm:\nAfter a birdie on the 16th, and a par on the 17th, Tiger Woods heads to the 18th knowing a bogey is all he needs to win his 5th Masters.\n2.29pm:\nTiger Woods bogeys the 18th, to win the Masters by one shot.\nHole by hole scorecard progression.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;\nReaction from Woods.\nAs is traditional, Woods was interviewed in Butler Cabin, where he discussed his victory:"

His finest achievement as a racing driver was in winning the gruelling 84-hour race, Marathon de la Route, with Belgian co-driver Julien Vernaeve, over the old Nürburgring circuit in 1966. Hedges was also an avid powerboat racer and took part in the Cowes-Torquay race. In 1966, he competed in the Miami to Nassau race with his partner, the infamous Lord Lucan.

The Jayhawks, members of the Big 12 Conference, played their home games at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. They were led by 16th year Hall of Fame head coach Bill Self.\nSeason notes.\nThe Jayhawks entered the season with high expectations due to returning All-Big 12 players Udoka Azubuike and LaGerald Vick, adding three 2018 McDonald's All-Americans, and several transfers coming off their redshirt years. Following the 2017–18 season, several sports websites ranked Kansas 1st on their \"Way too early rankings\" which preview the next season. The Jayhawks also entered the season ranked number 1 in the AP Poll. Despite the high expectations, the team dealt with adversity during the season as four different players that were expected to be starters missed time. Silvio De Sousa was declared ineligible by the NCAA, Udoka Azubuike underwent season ending surgery in January, Marcus Garrett missed five games due to injury, and LaGerald Vick took a leave absence in February to handle personal issues and eventually announced he wouldn't return. On February 23, 2019, the Jayhawks lost to Texas Tech 62-91. The loss was the Jayhawks worst conference loss under Bill Self and worst conference loss since the 1999-2000 season when they lost to Oklahoma State 53-86. Following a 68–81 loss to Oklahoma on March 5, the Jayhawks were eliminated from Big 12 regular season title contention, ending their NCAA record streak of 14 consecutive titles.\nRoster and coaching staff changes.\nGraduation.\nBelow are players who graduated from the University of Kansas without any college eligibility left.\nEarly draft entrants.\nHired agent.\nPlayers that hire an agent after declaring for the NBA draft automatically forfeit any remaining college eligibility. Below are any players that declared for the draft and hired an agent and will not be returning.\nDid not hire agent.\nPlayers who do not hire an agent can return to their college as long as they withdraw from the draft no more than 10 days after the final day of the NBA draft Combine, which made May 31 the final date to withdraw from the 2018 Draft. The following players entered the draft without initially hiring an agent. Also included is their final decision to either return to Kansas or if they hired an agent and stayed in the draft.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=| Big 12 Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"| "

Pakistan also visited Ireland midway through the tour and played the Irish team's first Test match at Malahide near Dublin. In preparation for this match the Irish team played a first-class match against Somerset at Taunton in April. At the end of their tour Pakistan played two T20 matches in Scotland on 12 and 13 June. The England team played a One Day International (ODI) against Scotland in Edinburgh in June, losing to Scotland for the first time in an ODI.\nThe South African women's team also toured England to play three One Day International matches against the England women's cricket team in June and to compete in the 2018 England women's Tri-Nation Series Twenty20 competition against England and New Zealand.

Their match against Ireland took place after the two first-class county matches, and a two-day match was played against Leicestershire between this and the first Test against England.\nPakistan won the first Test match by nine wickets on the fourth morning, playing \"superbly but unspectacularly\" to beat England comprehensively. The match was the first time England had lost the opening Test match of an English summer in 23 seasons. The BBC's cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew called England's performance \"truly dreadful\" and was shocked that England could be \"outplayed so comprehensively by a touring team at home in May\" whist praising Pakistan as looking \"sharper, better drilled and more prepared\". Pakistan's \"focus on basics\", coaching and management were praised by \"The Express Tribune\", whilst former Pakistan bowler Waqar Younis claimed that the win was his country's best at Lord's. Writing on CricInfo, George Dobell's view was that England's defeat was the \"culmination of several years' of ECB policies that have disrespected Test cricket\".\nEngland won the second Test within three days, defeating Pakistan by an innings and 55 runs in an \"emphatic victory\".\nSouth Africa women tour.\nSouth Africa women played three ODIs against England during June with England winning the series 2–1, their ninth consecutive series win against South Africa.

The Scottish score was the highest made by an Associate team against a Full Member side and included a score of 140 not out from Calum MacLeod.

The match was the England team's only away fixture during the 2018 English season.\nAustralia tour.\nAustralia played a series of five One Day International matches and a single T20 International against England in June. England won the ODI series 5–0, the first time they had achieved a 5–0 victory against Australia in an ODI series, and also won the T20I match. The series featured a world record score of 481/6 made by England in the third match of the series, a game they won by 242 runs, with Alex Hales and Jonny Bairstow both scoring centuries.\nAustralia played two warm-up one-day matches against Sussex and Middlesex at the start of June, winning both. After England achieved an \"ugly win\" in the first match of the series at The Oval strong batting performances saw them win the next three matches, including chasing a target of 311 runs in the fourth match, their highest run chase against Australia. The final match was closer, England eventually chasing Australia's score of 205 to win by one wicket, having been 114/8 in 29.4 overs at one point.\nTri-Nation series.\nThe England, South Africa and New Zealand women's teams competed in a three-way T20I competition between 20 June and 1 July.

The divisional winners Berkshire and Lincolnshire qualified for the four-day Championship Final, which was played between 16 and 19 September at the Banbury Cricket Club Ground in Oxfordshire, with Berkshire winning the Championship.\nThe Minor Counties Knockout Trophy was played on a straight knock-out basis over five rounds, a change from previous seasons. Cheshire won the final with Devon the beaten finalists.\nA new Twenty20 competition was introduced in 2018 with group matches played at the beginning of the season, replacing some of the matches previously played in the Knockout Trophy group stage. Counties were placed in four geographical divisions of five teams for the competition, each playing eight matches over four match days, with both matches against an opposition team being played on the same day as a double-header. A Minor Counties T20 competition was trialled in 2015 but has not been played since. The T20 competition was won by Berkshire, who defeated Cheshire in the final.\nThe first stages of both one-day competitions were played at the start of the season with Championship matches moving towards the later half the cricket season. The Finals Days for both one-day competitions was played at the end of August at Wormsley Park in Buckinghamshire."

        "text": "For many years before the Open Era of tennis in 1968, the usual format for the handful of touring tennis professionals was a series of two-man one-night stands across the United States and often in other countries as well. The most notable of these tours were the \"World Series\" or \"World Professional Championships\", in which the reigning world champion went head-to-head against a challenger, most often the leading amateur of the previous year who had just turned pro. Promoters would attempt to sign the leading amateur to a contract with a minimum guarantee against a percentage of gate receipts, making a similar type of deal with the reigning professional champion and sometimes giving smaller percentages to undercard players. The winners of the tours were described as being the \"world champion\".\nAfter World War II, with an increasing number of prominent professional players, there were occasionally tournament series with point systems which created official rankings for the complete field of pros. The tournament ranking series were held in 1946, 1959 and 1960 and there were also World Championship tours in these same three years involving only a few pros. The last World Championship two-man tour was held in 1963, featuring a final set of matches of Ken Rosewall against Rod Laver. From 1964 until 1967, a tournament series with a point system determined the pro No. 1 player. Some shorter two-man or four-man tours continued to be held from 1964 onward, as there had been since the late 1920s, but without a world title at stake.\nTournament ranking series.\nThere were occasionally important professional tournament series which were referred to as establishing full field rankings, necessitated by the increasing number of prominent professional players in the post-World War II period. In 1946, there was a professional tournament series of 18 events in the U.S. under the organization of the P.P.A.T. (Professional Players Association of Tennis) linked by a points system won by Bobby Riggs, which he relied upon as evidence of his mastery of the entire pro field. In 1959, Jack Kramer established a series of 15 tournaments in Australia, North America, and Europe linked by a points system which provided a full field ranking of all the contract professionals, plus a substantial money prize for the top finisher, with Lew Hoad emerging as world No. 1. The 1959 tournament series was officially named the \"Ampol Open Trophy\", after the principal sponsor of the tournaments, the Ampol oil company, and the trophy awarded to the winner. The 1959 tournament series was referred to as \"the world series\" in Kramer's brochure and a newspaper report. In 1960, Kramer again established a tournament series with a points system, but both Gonzales and Hoad withdrew from the field and the final results are unknown. In 1964, under Kramer's advice, the I.P.T.P.A. (International Professional Tennis Players Association) established a series of 17 tournaments in U.S. and Europe with a points system, and a world No. 1 and world champion was named as a result, Ken Rosewall. This system continued in subsequent years, with Rod Laver attaining the No. 1 ranking position for the 1965, 1966, and 1967 pro tournament series. The final results of these later tournament series were not published. In 1968–69, the two pro tennis tours, the NTL and the WCT, each had a tournament series ranking list which contributed four players from each tour to a combined final tournament at the Madison Square Garden. Tony Roche won the 1968 event, and Rod Laver won the 1969 event. Beginning in 1970, the ILTF authorized Kramer to arrange a year-end championship in which the pros with the highest tournament series points competed for the title of Grand Prix champion. This event was held in various locations and finally remained at Madison Square Garden from 1977 to 1989. In 1990, the ATP took over running the event and started awarding ranking points for the 8 qualifiers based on their results in the tournament. Currently, the championship is known as the \"ATP Finals\".\nNotes.\nTournament series:"

With the American Basketball Association, Williams helped organized the creation of the Dallas Chaparrals. He became the team's general manager upon their establishment in 1967 and held the position until 1971. During his time as general manager, Williams took over as the Chaparrals's head coach when Cliff Hagan resigned in 1970. \nAs an ABA head coach, Williams had 28 wins and 32 losses. During the 1970 ABA Playoffs, Williams and the Chaparrals reached the semifinals of the Western Division. He remained as both the team's head coach and general manager until Bill Blakely became coach of the Chaparrals in November 1970. While working as their general manager, Williams was fired from the Chaparrals in April 1971. Outside of coaching, Williams was also in charge of tickets. \nAfter leaving the Chaparrals, Williams became a real estate agent for a Dallas company in 1971 and was promoted to senior vice president in 1975. The same year, Williams started up companies in real estate and oil. As an oilman, Williams worked together with Irv Deal and Ray Holifield in oil production projects throughout the late 1970s.\nAwards and honors.\nWilliams was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 2009 and the Big Country Athletic Hall of Fame in 2013.

When hitting the mini-golf ball it moves around the little course until it gets into a hole. Several stage/course obstacles include giant cactuses and a little pond are in the way.\nDevelopment and release.\nKrazy Ace was programmed in 1991 but not released until late 1993 by Telegames. The game was released in very small quantities and as of a result of this, the game has become very sought-after by collectors and gamers alike. A complete copy today is worth around $450 making it one of the most expensive Atari Lynx titles ever officially released. \nReception.\nRobert Jung reviewed the game which was published to IGN. In his final verdict he wrote \"Krazy Ace Miniature Golf is a good miniature golf game, but not a great one; the card's major flaw is the lack of variety in the course and the game itself. With merely passable graphics and sound, this is a decent game to divert yourself for a little while, but there's almost nothing here to keep you on this krazy kourse for the long term.\" Giving a final score of 6 out of 10."

        "text": "Malibu Bikini Volleyball is a 1993 beach volleyball video game developed by Hand Made Software and published by Atari Corporation in North America and Europe exclusively for the Atari Lynx. In the game, players have the choice to compete across any of the game modes available with either AI-controlled opponents or against other human players using the Lynx's ComLynx system on matches set in Malibu, California. Its gameplay mainly uses a two-button configuration.\n\"Malibu Bikini Volleyball\" formed part in a string of projects created by Hand Made Software on the Lynx after their first title for the platform, \"Awesome Golf\", went gold and released to the public in 1991. Its development was led by \"Alien vs Predator\" producer James Hampton along with Oscar Green of Hand Made and went through various changes before its eventual launch to the market.\n\"Malibu Bikini Volleyball\" garnered mixed reception from critics since its release, who felt divided in regards to several aspects such as the presentation, graphics, sound design, gameplay and controls, although the multiplayer for up to four people was noted by some reviewers as a positive point.\nGameplay.\n\"Malibu Bikini Volleyball\" is a two-on-two beach volleyball game similar to \"Kings of the Beach\" and \"RealSports Volleyball\", where players take control of either a male or a female avatar in a series of matches on outdoor courts taking place in Malibu, California. Most of the rules from the sport are present in the title, though they can be modified in the options menu along with other settings that alters the matches. Some of the gameplay options found within the game include a friendly mode where players can practice their skills and a tournament mode where multiple teams must be faced in order to become the emerging champion. Multiplayer is one of the main focus of the game, as up to four players can compete against each other by connecting four Atari Lynx units via the system's ComLynx port during the title screen. During gameplay, players are able to apply skills such as serve, pass, set, attack and block the incoming ball for offensive and defensive purposes respectively in order to score points. A noteworthy feature is the ability to change the in-game music by pressing the Option 2 button during gameplay to do so.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"Malibu Bikini Volleyball\" formed part in a string of five projects by Hand Made Software for Atari Corporation after their first commercially released game on the Lynx, \"Awesome Golf\", went gold. Its development was helmed by a small team at the company with Oscar Green as producer, while James Hampton was also a producer of the project prior to his role with \"Alien vs Predator\" on the Atari Jaguar, although he is not credited as such in the credits of the game. Both Jim and Val Gregory served as co-designers, while Bill Barna and Rob Nicholson acted as programmers. Artists Andy Gavin, Lee Cawley and Michael McCallion were responsible for the pixel art. Both the music and sound effects were created by Paul Tonge while Carrie Tahquechi, wife of ex-Atari producer Ted Tahquechi and the female voice in \"Tempest 2000\", did voice work for the title.\n\"Malibu Bikini Volleyball\" was announced for a Q2 1992 release early in the same year and went through various visual and name changes before release, in addition of delays. Early previews showcased the game under the title \"Bikini Beach Volleyball\", featuring a different title screen compared with the final version featuring model Karen Isely, while the game was later slated for a September 1992 release during summer but it was renamed to \"Malibu Beach Volleyball\" before settling under its initial name. Other previews of the game also touted multiplayer support for up to two players instead of four. It was first showcased in a playable state to attendees at Consumer Electronics Show in 1992. The title was eventually released in 1993, late into the life span of the Lynx.\nReception.\nRobert Jung reviewed the game which was published on IGN in his verdict he wrote \"Malibu Bikini Volleyball is not a very demanding game, but is, like a good day at the beach, a leisurely way to spend some time. Gamers looking for a more punishing regiment should look elsewhere, but those who want a kinder, gentler sport will find this title pleasing.\" Giving a final score of 7 out of 10."

        "title": "2019 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for 2019 proceeded according to rules most recently amended in 2016. As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players. The results were announced on January 22, 2019, with the BBWAA electing Mariano Rivera, Roy Halladay, Edgar Martínez, and Mike Mussina to the Hall of Fame. Rivera and Halladay were elected in their first year of eligibility, while Martínez was elected in his last year of eligibility. Rivera became the first player to be unanimously elected, appearing on all 425 ballots; he broke Ken Griffey Jr.'s record of 99.32 percent (437 out of 440), set in 2016.\nThe Today's Game Era Committee, one of four voting panels that since 2016 had taken over the role of the more broadly-defined Veterans Committee, convened on December 9, 2018, to select from a ballot of retired players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the sport after 1987, with Lee Smith and Harold Baines elected by this body. The formal induction ceremony was held at the Hall's facilities in Cooperstown, New York, on July 21, 2019.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA election rules remained identical to those that were in effect for the most recent elections. The most recent rules change, announced in 2015, tightened the qualifications for the BBWAA electorate. Beginning with the 2016 election, eligible voters must not only have 10 years of continuous BBWAA membership, but also be currently active members, or have held active status within the 10 years prior to the election. A BBWAA member who has not been active for more than 10 years can regain voting status by covering MLB in the year preceding the election. \nEdgar Martínez and Fred McGriff were on the ballot for their final time. McGriff dropped off the ballot, while Martínez was the sixth player to be elected in his final ballot, after Red Ruffing, Joe Medwick, Ralph Kiner, Jim Rice, and Tim Raines.\nThe ballot included two categories of players:\n319 votes were needed for election. A total of 425 ballots were cast, with 3,404 votes for individual players, an average of 8.01 names per ballot.\nPlayers who were eligible for the first time in 2019 but were \"not\" on the ballot included Wilson Betemit, Henry Blanco, Tim Byrdak, Jamey Carroll, José Contreras, Jesse Crain, Ryan Dempster, Mark DeRosa, Matt Diaz, Octavio Dotel, Chad Durbin, Chad Gaudin, Édgar González, Mike Gonzalez, Jerry Hairston Jr., Ramón Hernández, Eric Hinske, Brandon Inge, César Izturis, Austin Kearns, Casey Kotchman, Mark Kotsay, Ryan Langerhans, Brandon Lyon, Corky Miller, Brett Myers, Laynce Nix, Ramón Ortiz, Cody Ransom, Jon Rauch, Chris Snyder, Yorvit Torrealba, Jake Westbrook, Ty Wigginton, and DeWayne Wise.\nRivera's unanimous election was not the only significant historic milestone from the 2019 BBWAA voting results. Halladay, who died in a plane crash in November 2017, became the first player to have been elected posthumously on the first ballot in a regular BBWAA election since Christy Mathewson in the first BBWAA election of 1936. Roberto Clemente was voted in via a special BBWAA election in 1973, shortly after his death in a plane crash and before he would have been eligible.\nToday's Game Era Committee.\nIn 2016, the Hall of Fame announced changes to the Era Committee system. The system's timeframes were restructured to place a greater emphasis on the modern game, and to reduce the frequency at which individuals from the pre-1970 game (including Negro league baseball figures) would have their careers reviewed. Considering candidates whose greatest contributions occurred in 1988 and later, the Today's Game Era Committee met in 2018 as part of the elections for the next calendar year.\nThe Hall announced the 10 candidates for the Today's Game Era Committee ballot on November 5, 2018, with the committee scheduled to meet and vote at the 2018 winter meetings. Voting results were announced immediately after the committee meeting adjourned on December 9. The cutoff for election and induction remained the standard 75%, or 12 of 16 votes.\nAll of the candidates except George Steinbrenner were living when the ballot and results were announced. Harold Baines, being considered by the committee for the second time, received the necessary votes for election to the Hall of Fame in this balloting. Lee Smith, being considered by the committee for the first time, was also elected, unanimously. Lou Pinella missed election by a single vote.\nNote: Baines, Belle, Clark, Hershiser, Johnson, Piniella, and Steinbrenner were on the previous Today's Game Era Committee ballot in .\nThe committee consisted of the following individuals:\nBaines was elected by the committee despite never receiving more than 6.1% of the vote in any BBWAA election. His selection was heavily criticized by sportswriters, who thought that his career did not meet Hall of Fame standards. John Tayler of \"Sports Illustrated\" called Baines \"an indefensible and embarrassing choice\" and wrote \"there's no real argument for Baines as a Hall of Famer. If you can put one together, it's probably a bad one. You'd have an easier time making a case that he's one of the worst Hall of Famers ever.\" According to Yahoo Sports' Mike Oz, \"There's no doubt that Baines getting into the Hall of Fame lowers the Cooperstown bar.\" Michael Rosenberg of \"Sports Illustrated\" said, \"I feel a bit for Baines, who earned the ultimate compliment only to be told he didn't remotely deserve it. This is because he didn't remotely deserve it. Baines was a good player who does not belong in Hall of Fame conversations, let alone the Hall of Fame.\" \"Sports Illustrated\"'s John Tayler and Tom Verducci noted that Baines' candidacy was helped by several committee members – Pat Gillick, Tony La Russa, and Jerry Reinsdorf – who were connected to his teams.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is now given the previous day at the Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum.\nThe three finalists for the 2019 award were announced on July 18, 2018 during the Major League Baseball All-Star break:\nStark was announced as the recipient during the 2018 winter meetings on December 11. Stark received 270 of the 463 ballots cast (including 2 blank ballots) to Reeves' 111 and Reusse's 80.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nVarious changes in July 2016 were also made to the annual Ford C. Frick Award elections, presented annually to a preeminent baseball broadcaster since 1978. According to the Hall, the new criteria for selection are \"Commitment to excellence, quality of broadcasting abilities, reverence within the game, popularity with fans, and recognition by peers.\"\nAdditionally, a ballot of eight candidates was set, down from 10 in years past. The three ballot slots previously determined by fan voting on Facebook were now filled by a committee of historians.\nA new election cycle was established, rotating annually between \"Current Major League Markets\" (team-specific announcers) with the 2017 Frick Award; \"National Voices\" (broadcasters whose contributions were realized on a national level) with the 2018 Frick Award; and \"Broadcasting Beginnings\" (early team voices and pioneers of baseball broadcasting) with the 2019 Frick Award. This cycle repeated every three years.\nThe Hall announced the following finalists for the 2019 Ford C. Frick Award on October 22, 2018.\nAll finalists had been deceased for at least 30 years when the ballot was announced, the most recently deceased being Hoyt in 1984. Two finalists, Heilmann and Hoyt, are members of the Hall of Fame as players.\nThe Hall announced Al Helfer as the recipient on December 12, 2018. Helfer (1911–1975) called games for eight MLB teams in a career that spanned more than 30 years. He was most notable as forming one of MLB's first play-by-play teams in the 1930s alongside fellow Frick Award recipient Red Barber, and also as the lead announcer for the Mutual Broadcasting System's \"Game of the Day\" in the 1950s."

        "title": "Super Bowl Sunday (This Is Us)",
        "text": "\"Super Bowl Sunday\" is the fourteenth episode of the second season of the American television drama series \"This Is Us\", and the thirty-second overall. It was written by showrunner Dan Fogelman, and directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. It was broadcast on February 4, 2018, on NBC in the United States. In the episode, on Super Bowl Sunday of 1998, the Pearsons' house catches fire. The Pearson family manages to escape, but Jack ultimately dies. In present day, the children and Rebecca watch the Super Bowl game remembering Jack.\nThe episode originally aired immediately following the broadcast of Super Bowl LII. \"Super Bowl Sunday\" was seen by 26.97 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched episode of \"This Is Us\". It is still the highest-rated scripted entertainment telecast on U.S. television since Fox's 2008 broadcast of the post-Super Bowl episode of \"House\".\nThe episode received critical acclaim by critics and audiences alike and is widely regarded as one of the best episodes of the show.\nPlot.\nIn 1998, late at night after the Super Bowl, noises wake Jack, who discovers the house is on fire. He wakes Rebecca and calls out to Randall and Kate; Kevin is at Sophie's house. Jack retrieves the children from their bedrooms, using Kate's mattress as a heat shield. Kate, Randall, and Rebecca descend to the ground via a bedsheet rope. Kate's dog, Louie, barks; seeing Kate's desperation, Jack re-enters and emerges with Louie and some family mementos. Leaving Kate and Randall at Miguel's house, Rebecca takes Jack to the hospital for smoke inhalation. While Rebecca is away from the hospital room to handle logistics, Jack suffers a sudden, fatal \"widow maker\" heart attack. The doctor informs Rebecca, who goes into shock until seeing Jack's body. She tells Miguel, Kate, and Randall, then screams alone in the car; Kate finds and tells Kevin.\nIn 2018, on the 20th anniversary of Jack's death, Kate cathartically watches the audition tape Jack recorded, which he saved from the fire; the VCR damages it, but Toby gets it repaired and uploaded to the cloud; Kate tells Toby he strengthens her, and Jack would have loved him. Kevin, who usually drinks away his pain on the anniversary, visits the tree where Jack's ashes were scattered; he acknowledges failing to fulfill Jack's legacy, but hopes to make him proud. Rebecca makes and eats Jack's favorite lasagna, and bonds with Kevin; she believes their reunion is a gift from Jack. Randall commemorates Jack with a Super Bowl party for his daughters and their friends. The family's new pet lizard dies suddenly; Randall's eulogy is overly intense and emotional. Tess tells Randall that she has deliberately left the phone off the hook to prevent social workers from calling, fearing Randall's interest in William, Deja, and his new job means he wants \"a new life.\" Randall tells Tess that her birth changed his life; he will always be devoted to her, and plans to have dinner with her every week, even when she's a working adult. Tess thinks the family's participation in fostering is \"cool.\" Deja calls from the house's front door; Randall and Beth bring her inside and comfort her, which Tess happily observes.\nJordan, the boy shown previously in an Essex County social worker's office, is placed with a couple. An older Randall arrives to have dinner with the social worker, who is the adult Tess.\nProduction.\nThe episode was written by series creator Dan Fogelman. The decision to air an episode of \"This Is Us\" after the Super Bowl was announced on May 14, 2017. Fogelman envisioned Jack's death as a consequence of the fire since the pilot script. He wanted the moment to take place towards the end of the second season and asked for the slot upon knowing NBC would air the Super Bowl.\nThe fire sequence was filmed in December 2017 in Newhall Ranch, California.\nActual footage from NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl LII, including scenes from the pre-game show and the game itself, were edited into scenes of the episode shortly prior to broadcast.\nReception.\nRatings.\n\"Super Bowl Sunday\" was originally broadcast on Sunday, February 4, 2018, in the United States on NBC. The episode was watched in the United States by a total of 26.97 million people. It is the most-watched entertainment telecast since 2012 and the most-watched TV drama episode since 2008's \"House\" Super Bowl episode, which attracted 29 million viewers.\nCritical response.\nThe episode drew critical acclaim from critics, with Mandy Moore's acting receiving critical acclaim. It has a 87% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews with an average score of 8.54/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Mandy Moore's performance proves to be a game changer in 'Super Bowl Sunday,' eclipsing the episode's plot twists, aching dialogue, and even Jack's death\".\nKimberly Roots of TVLine deemed the installment \"a good episode\". Brian Lowry of CNN called the episode \"emotional\", explaining it had \"strong individual moments for each of the key characters\" and that it \"managed to play with expectations\". Caroline Siede of The A.V. Club praised Mandy Moore's performance as Rebecca, saying she has become the \"MVP of season 2\". She thought the fire sequence was \"compelling, well-staged action\". She appreciated that the series didn't \"go too over-the-top\" with Jack's death so as it doesn't become \"emotional porn\". To her, the present-day scenes served as introduction for new viewers, establishing the show's world, and the flash-forward was a surprise.\nKelly Lawler of \"USA Today\" wrote: \"Although \"This Is Us\" is known for its big twists and fake-outs, at its core the show (like most) is about its characters. 'Super Bowl Sunday' succeeded by focusing on Kevin (Justin Hartley), Kate, Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) in the present and past. By not drawing out Jack's death even further, the episode managed to be more about the different ways Jack's family members experienced their grief, and not about tricking the audience. It was the right way for the often-frustrating mystery to end.\"\nConversely, Laura Prudom of IGN described the episode as \"a cry-fest, to be sure, because this show is used to wringing our tear ducts dry with surgical precision, but there's no denying that the whole exercise also felt unashamedly manipulative, which is a trap \"This Is Us\" often falls into -- especially when it's trying to hide things from the audience to show us how clever it is. For viewers who tuned in for the first time after the big game [...], it probably made the regular \"This Is Us\" audience seem like complete masochists.\" \"Time\" writer Daniel D'Addario gave a negative review disapproving the fact that Jack's death, though \"movingly depicted\", was used for entertainment purposes. \"The sort of show \"This Is Us\" is in its strongest moments—one in which family members have frank and honest conversations about their hopes and fears—isn’t one that stages a ritual death on Super Bowl Sunday, after deploying cast members to brag about how it will make you cry.\"\nCrock-Pot controversy.\nIn the previous episode \"That'll Be the Day\" a Crock-Pot was shown to be the cause of the fire, causing negative reactions on social media. Some people wanted to get rid of their Crock-Pots, one reason being the fear that something could happen with theirs. The manufacturer assured fans of the show their product was safe. Although a lawsuit was considered, the makers of Crock-Pot created a Twitter account of their own where they continued the positive messages, and even posted on Facebook. During Super Bowl LII, Ventimiglia appeared in an apology ad. A month after the controversy, not only did the brand restore its reputation but sales of Crock-Pots had increased."

The Flyers started the season 8-3, including a win at Cincinnati, the program's first win on their rivals home court since 1984, before losing 7 games in a row. The Flyers lost to Saint Joseph's in the first round of the Atlantic 10 tournament. Dayton was not selected to play in a postseason tournament, the 2nd season in a row that the Flyers did not play in a postseason tournament.\nPrevious season.\nThe 2004–05 Dayton Flyers finished the season 18–11, with a record of 10-6 in the Atlantic 10 regular season.

The tournament took on a similar format from the previous season with the addition of two teams from England's National League entering the competition for the first time. This took the total number of participating clubs to 58.\nThirty teams from the Scottish Championship, Scottish League One and Scottish League Two competed, along with four teams from the Highland Football League (one eliminated in preliminary round) and four from the Lowland Football League (one eliminated in preliminary round). In addition to this, Under-21 teams of the clubs competing in the Scottish Premiership were represented. This was the third edition with two clubs from both Northern Ireland's NIFL Premiership and the Welsh Premier League and was the second time that two teams from the League of Ireland entered.

Originally, Bray Wanderers were to be the second side to represent the League of Ireland however, they were subsequently thrown out by the FAI on 16 July 2018 for failing to pay their players and replaced by Limerick. A similar statement was released by the FAI hours later about Limerick who were also in financial difficulties. St Patrick's Athletic were then invited to compete as the next ranked team in line but declined. Sligo Rovers accepted the position in their place so they would represent the League of Ireland instead.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the second round was made on 16 August 2018 at 1pm live on the SPFL Facebook page.\nTeams in Bold advanced to the third round.\nTeams in \"Italics\" were not known at the time of the draw.\nThird round.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the third round was made on 11 September 2018 at 1pm live on the SPFL Facebook page.\nTeams in Bold advanced to the quarter-finals.\nQuarter-finals.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the quarter-finals was made on 16 October 2018 at 1pm at The Hub in Edinburgh live on the SPFL Facebook page.\nTeams in Bold advanced to the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the semi-finals was made on 21 November 2018 at 1pm at Hampden Park live on the SPFL Facebook page.\nPlayer of the Round.\nThe Golden Ball Award is a 'Player of the Round' award given to the player who is adjudged to have had the best performance of that round out of all the players in teams left competing in that round of the competition.

        "title": "Scott Foster (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Scott Foster (born January 17, 1982) is a Canadian accountant and amateur ice hockey goaltender. He appeared in one game for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL) near the end of the 2017–18 season as an emergency goaltender following injuries to the team's starting and backup goaltenders.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nFoster played junior hockey with the Petrolia Jets of the Western Ontario Hockey League in the 2001–02 season. He then moved on to play for Western Michigan University's hockey team in the 2002–03, 2003–04, and 2005–06 Central Collegiate Hockey Association seasons. He played in tandem with Mike Mantua in 2002–03, playing 21 games to Mantua's 26 and recording a 7–8–2 record with a .868 save percentage. His next year was more successful as he served as the team's starting goaltender, playing 33 games and recording an .881 percentage. His final stint with the team was less successful, as he played just one game in 2005-06, allowing three goals on seven shots in just one period of play.\nChicago Blackhawks.\nFoster was signed by the Chicago Blackhawks to an amateur tryout contract on the eve of their March 29, 2018, game against the Winnipeg Jets when the presumed starter Anton Forsberg was sidelined by injury. Forsberg himself had become the Blackhawks starting goaltender after Corey Crawford suffered a season-ending concussion. Foster had gone to 15 games as an emergency goaltender prior to this game, but never dressed. Serving as the Blackhawks' emergency backup goaltender for the game, Foster was not expected to play, considering his lack of high-level experience and the fact that only one goaltender of his kind had suited up for NHL action since 2010: Jorge Alves, who made his seven-second Carolina Hurricanes debut at the end of a game in December 2016.\nHowever, before the mid-way mark of the third period, Blackhawks starter Collin Delia, who was also making his NHL debut that night after having spent the balance of the season in the Blackhawks minor league system, was injured, forcing Foster into NHL action for his debut. He saved seven shots out of seven in about 14 minutes of play, becoming the first emergency goaltender to ever stop a shot, and preserving a 6–2 Blackhawks win. Although Delia was credited with the win, Foster was named the game's first star. Asked about his performance following his NHL debut, Foster quipped, \"I think I'm just hitting my prime.\" Assuming Foster does not play again in the NHL, he is one of 18 players since 1982 to record a perfect 1.000 save percentage in the league.\nFor the game Foster received \"Just beer league glory\", he said. He kept his game-worn jersey but no other compensation; under the terms of the NHL collective bargaining agreement, players signed to amateur tryout contracts like Foster are unpaid for their services.\nFoster appeared at the 2018 NHL Award Ceremony, where he and Jim Belushi presented the Vezina Trophy to Pekka Rinne. Previously, he was voted the \"Best NHL First\" at the Blackhawks Fan Choice Awards.\nDuring the 2018–19 season, Foster was asked to be an occasional second goalie for the Blackhawks optional morning skate.\nPersonal life.\nFoster lives in Oak Park, Illinois, and works as an accountant with Golub Capital. He was previously with Aurora Investment Management. He plays for two beer league hockey teams as a goaltender. After his turn in the NHL, the United States Hockey League’s Chicago Steel offered to hire him as their \"emergency accountant\" and hoped to host him at their final home game to conduct the ceremonial puck drop. Foster declined further interviews the next months, preferring to \"prioritize his family and work following his NHL stint\", even as interview requests came from as far away as Turkey. However, he eventually acquiesced and agreed to be interviewed by ESPN in April 2019."

The season was made up of ranking tournaments, non-ranking tournaments and variant tournaments. In total, 54 events were competed in the 2018–19 season, beginning with the pro–am 2018 Vienna Open, and ending with the 2019 World Snooker Championship.\nTo be eligible to play in most tournaments, players had to have qualified to play on the World Snooker Tour, however, some wildcard former professional, and amateur players were eligible in certain competitions. The season also saw four events strictly for over 40s, as a part of the World Seniors Tour.\nRonnie O'Sullivan, Neil Robertson and Judd Trump each won three ranking events with Mark Allen, Stuart Bingham and Kyren Wilson each winning twice. Robertson reached six ranking event finals during the season.\nPlayers.\nThe Main Tour consists of 128 professional players for the 2018/2019 season. The top 64 players from the prize money rankings after the 2018 World Championship and the 34 players earning a two-year card the previous year (excluding Lyu Haotian, who already climbed into the top 64 of the world rankings following the first year of his two-year tour card) automatically qualified for the season. Next, eight places were allocated from the top 8 on the One Year Ranking List, who had not already qualified for the Main Tour. Another two players came from the EBSA Qualifying Tour Play-Offs, two players came from the CBSA China Tour and a further 12 places were available through the 2018 Q School, four from each of the three events. The six remaining entries on to the tour were allocated from the international amateur events.\nDue to the disputes between the IBSF and the WPBSA, the WPBSA decided that the winners of the tournaments organised by the IBSF or any continental confederations which were not affiliated to the World Snooker Federation would not be awarded tour cards. The only exception was the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship, which had been concluded before the decision was made.\nNew professional players.\nAll players listed below received a tour card for two seasons.\nCalendar.\nThe following tables outline the dates and results for all the World Snooker Tour, World Women's Snooker Tour, World Seniors Tour, Challenge Tour, and other events in the season.\nPoints distribution.\n2018/2019 points distribution for World Snooker Tour ranking events:"

After the 1st exchange Finland was third and Italy fourth, but the margin was less than 20 seconds to Finland. On the second leg Erling Jevne pulled Norway up to second, still trailing Italy and Fulvio Valbusa by 12 seconds. Norway sent out Bjørn Dæhlie on the third leg, and he made up ground on Fabio Maj. At the final exchange, Italy led by 0.5 seconds, with Finland in third, though a full minute behind.\nAs in Lillehammer the anchor leg battle between Norway and Italy was tight. Thomas Alsgaard was the Norwegian anchor, facing Italy's Silvio Fauner. As the Italians had done four years before, Alsgaard sat on Fauner's tail for most of the leg, refusing to take the lead. Then in the stadium he unleashed a sprint 150 metres from the line, to win the gold medal for his team by 2/10ths of a second. For Bjørn Dæhlie this was his seventh gold medal, a Winter Olympic record at the time.\nFinland hung on for the bronze medal, but they were closely challenged by Sweden, which was less than 10 seconds away from the podium.\nResults.\nEach team used four skiers, with each completing racing over the same 10 kilometre circuit. The first two raced in the classical style, and the final pair of skiers raced freestyle."

Välbe's split had made it an easy task for Russian anchor Larisa Lazutina, who increased the lead slightly as Russia won a comfortable gold medal over Norway.

        "title": "2018–19 La Liga",
        "text": "The 2018–19 La Liga season, also known as LaLiga Santander for sponsorship reasons, was the 88th since its establishment. The season began on 17 August 2018 and finished on 19 May 2019. Fixtures for the 2018–19 season were announced on 24 July 2018. This was the first La Liga season to use the VAR.\nBarcelona were the defending champions, and they secured a second consecutive title with three games to spare following victory over Levante on 27 April. Huesca, Rayo Vallecano and Valladolid joined as the promoted clubs from the 2017–18 Segunda División. They replaced Málaga, Las Palmas and Deportivo La Coruña, who were relegated to the 2018–19 Segunda División.\nThis is the first season since 2008–09 that did not feature the league's all time second-highest scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored 311 goals in 293 La Liga matches.\nSummary.\nSeveral clubs made managerial changes before the start of the season. Among them were Real Madrid, when Zinedine Zidane resigned following the club's third consecutive UEFA Champions League victory. He was replaced by Julen Lopetegui, who was managing the Spain national team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia at the time of announcement and was dismissed from that job as a result. Other incomers included Pablo Machín at Sevilla, who was hired after his success with newly promoted Girona the previous season.\nIn the transfer window, the biggest deal saw Real Madrid lose Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a fee of €112 million; the Portuguese forward had scored 450 goals in 438 games during his nine years in the Spanish capital. Real Madrid's additions included Belgium international goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois for €35 million from Chelsea, and striker Mariano returned to the club from Lyon for €22 million. Defending champions Barcelona added Clément Lenglet to their defence, Arturo Vidal to midfield, and spent over €40 million on Brazilian forward Malcom. Players exiting Barcelona included Andrés Iniesta at the end of a successful 16-year-spell, as he signed for Vissel Kobe in Japan.\nVeterans Gabi and Fernando Torres also left Atlético Madrid for new teams in Asia, while the same club welcomed in the likes of World Cup-winning French midfielder Thomas Lemar and Portugal's Gelson Martins. After a successful previous season, in which the team finished fourth and returned to the Champions League, Valencia made permanent the loan signing of Portuguese winger Gonçalo Guedes from Paris Saint-Germain and Geoffrey Kondogbia from Inter Milan. Forward Simone Zaza and midfielder João Cancelo both left to Italy, while Kevin Gameiro arrived as replacement. Athletic Bilbao sold Kepa Arrizabalaga to Chelsea for €80 million, a world record fee for a goalkeeper.\nThe tenth round of matches featured the first \"El Clásico\" of the season, which Barcelona won 5–1 at home against Real Madrid with a hat-trick by Luis Suárez. The result put Madrid into 9th place, and led to the dismissal of Lopetegui after only five months. Other early pace-setters included Sevilla with their prolific strike partnership of André Silva and Wissam Ben Yedder, Alavés who were briefly league leaders in mid-October, Espanyol, and Valladolid who had been taken over by former Brazil international Ronaldo.\nTeams.\nPromotion and relegation (pre-season).\nA total of 20 teams will contest the league, including 17 sides from the 2017–18 season and three promoted from the 2017–18 Segunda División. This will include the two top teams from the Segunda División, and the winners of the play-offs.\nThe first team to be relegated from La Liga were Málaga. Their relegation was ensured on 19 April 2018, following a late 0−1 defeat to Levante, ending their 10-year spell in the top division.\nThe second team to be relegated were Las Palmas, after a 0−4 home defeat to Deportivo Alavés on 22 April 2018, ending their three-year spell in the league.\nThe last team to be relegated were Deportivo La Coruña, following a 2−4 home loss to Barcelona on 29 April 2018. This result ensured Deportivo's third relegation in seven years, and also handed Barcelona their 25th La Liga title.\nOn 21 May 2018, Huesca were promoted to La Liga for the first time ever by winning 2–0 at Lugo.\nRayo Vallecano was the second team to earn promotion to La Liga on 27 May 2018 by winning against Lugo as well, this time 1–0. Rayo returned after a two-year absence.\nValladolid was the last team to be promoted after beating Sporting Gijón and Numancia in the play-offs. Valladolid returned to top division after 4 years.\nThis was the first season since the 2014–15 season without any teams from the archipelagos of Spain (teams located on the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands) since Las Palmas was relegated and Tenerife failed to qualify for the promotion play-offs.\nStadia and locations.\n \nCelta signed a sponsorship contract with Abanca to rename their stadium as Abanca-Balaídos.\nMatches outside Spain.\nOn 16 August 2018, La Liga signed a 15-year agreement with Relevant Sports (owners of the International Champions Cup) to schedule one match per season within the United States. This would mark the first time ever that an official La Liga league match would be held there. The match between Girona and Barcelona, to be played on 27 January 2019, was selected to be played in Miami, but it required the approval of the Royal Spanish Football Federation. On 21 September 2018, the Spanish Football Federation denied approval of the match being held in Miami. On 26 October 2018, following a request for guidance from the Spanish Football Federation, US Soccer and CONCACAF, the FIFA Council discussed La Liga's proposal. At the end of the meeting, the FIFA Council stated that \"Consistent with the opinion expressed by the Football Stakeholders Committee, the Council emphasised the sporting principle that official league matches must be played within the territory of the respective member association\".

Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" designated it an \"NYT Critics Pick\", and stated that \"It's... easy to get swept up by the beats in the film because Mr. Wiseman, among the most celebrated direct-cinema practitioners, eschews voiceovers, talking-head interviews, extraneous footage and the customary and sometimes superfluous like.\" Rob Nelson of \"Variety\" also praised the film, noting that while it is shorter than most of Wiseman's works, \"the viewer learns an enormous amount from [\"Boxing Gym\",] but not at all in the conventional documentary manner\", and instead through \"images that put the audience in close contact with the boxers’ routines\". Eric Kohn of \"IndieWire\" remarked that Wiseman's filmmaking method resulted in \"an ethnographic snapshot of restless people in their natural habitat.\""

        "text": "The 2018–19 ICC T20 World Cup Africa Qualifier was the tournament played as part of qualification process for the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup.\nTwelve regional qualifiers were held by the International Cricket Council (ICC), with 62 teams competing during 2018 in five regions – Africa (3 groups), Americas (2), Asia (2), East Asia Pacific (2) and Europe (3). The top 25 sides from these progressed to five Regional Finals in 2019, with seven teams then going on to compete in the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier, along with the six lowest ranked sides from the ICC T20I Championship.\nThe first African sub-regional qualifier (North-Western sub region) was held in Nigeria, with the two other groups staged in Botswana and Rwanda. The top two teams in each group advanced to the regional finals tournament, which will determine two African entrants to the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier. In April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full international status to Twenty20 men's matches played between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards. Therefore, all the matches in the Regional Finals were played as Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).\nFrom the North-Western sub region group, both Ghana and Nigeria qualified for the Africa Regional Finals. Simon Ateak of Ghana was named the player of the tournament in the North-Western group. The second group, the Eastern sub region, started on 7 July 2018. Both Kenya and Uganda qualified for the Africa Regional Finals from the Eastern sub region group. Uganda's Riazat Ali Shah was named the player of the tournament for the Eastern group. From the Southern sub region group, Botswana and Namibia qualified for the Africa Regional Finals.\nThe Regional Finals were held in Uganda in May 2019. Namibia and Kenya both progressed to the T20 World Cup Qualifier after finishing first and second respectively in the Regional Finals. In July 2019, the ICC suspended Zimbabwe Cricket, with the team barred from taking part in ICC events. As a result of their suspension, the ICC confirmed that Nigeria would replace them in the T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament.\nNorth-Western sub region.\nThe North-Western sub region group was held in Nigeria from 14 to 21 April 2018.\nPoints table.\n(H) Host, (Q) Qualified to next stage\nEastern sub region.\nThe Eastern sub region group was held in Rwanda from 7 to 14 July 2018.\nPoints table.\n(H) Host, (Q) Qualified to next stage\nSouthern sub region.\nThe Southern sub region group was held in Botswana from 28 October to 3 November 2018. Zambia, initially listed as an entrant, withdrew before the tournament draw was released.\nPoints table.\n(H) Host, (Q) Qualified to next stage\nRegional Finals.\nThe Regional Finals were held in Uganda from 20 to 24 May 2019, with the top two sides progressing to the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the UAE. Originally, the finals were scheduled to start on 19 May, but all three fixtures were washed out, with the matches rescheduled for the tournament's reserve day. Ahead of the final day of fixtures, Kenya, Namibia and Nigeria were all in contention of finishing in the top two places and progressing to the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament. However, all of the matches on the last day were washed out, therefore Namibia and Kenya both progressed to the T20 World Cup Qualifier after finishing first and second respectively in the Regional Finals.\nIn August 2019, the ICC confirmed that Nigeria had also progressed to the T20 World Cup Qualifier, after Zimbabwe had been suspended from taking part in international cricket tournaments in the previous month."

        "title": "2018 Kentucky Derby",
        "text": "The 2018 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 2018 Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve) was the 144th running of the Kentucky Derby, and took place on Saturday, May 5, 2018, in Louisville, Kentucky. The field was open to 20 horses, with a purse of million. The Derby is held annually in Louisville on the first Saturday in May, at the end of the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival. It is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of , and has been run at Churchill Downs racetrack since its inception in 1875.\nThe race was broadcast by NBC, with coverage by NBCSN of undercard races beginning at 12:30pm EDT and main network coverage of pre-race activities starting at 2:30pm EDT. Post time was 6:52pm EDT. The race was won by Justify, who was the post-time favorite, in a time of 2:04.20 over a sloppy track. It is the first time since 1882 that the race was won by a horse that did not race at the age of two.\nQualification.\nThe Kentucky Derby is only open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds, thus all entrants in the 2018 race were part of the 2015 North American live foal crop of roughly 22,000. The field was limited to twenty horses who qualified based on points earned in the 2018 Road to the Kentucky Derby, a series of designated races that was first introduced in 2013. This point system replaced the previous graded stakes race earnings system.\nThe top points earner in the 2018 series was Magnum Moon (150 points), winner of the Rebel Stakes and Arkansas Derby. Good Magic, the champion two-year-old from 2017, finished second in the series by winning both the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and the Blue Grass Stakes. The other major prep winners were Noble Indy (Louisiana Derby), Mendelssohn (UAE Derby), Audible (Florida Derby), Vino Rosso (Wood Memorial) and Justify (Santa Anita Derby).\nChurchill Downs also created separate qualification roads for horses based in Japan and Europe. None of the invitations for qualifiers on the Japan Road was accepted. On the European Road, the connections of Gronkowski accepted after the colt qualified first. However, the colt subsequently became ill and had to miss the race.\nField.\nThe early favorite was Justify, who had made only three starts before the race but won each time with triple-digit Beyer Speed Figures. In the Derby, he had to surmount what came to be known as \"Curse of Apollo\" – a reference to the fact that no horse had ever won the Derby without racing while at age two since Apollo in 1882. \"Justify is a natural and he's still green, just learning how to run. He's so talented\", said his trainer Bob Baffert. \"But there are a lot of nice horses out there this year.\"\nTrainer Todd Pletcher, who won the 2017 Kentucky Derby with Always Dreaming, had four of the leading contenders: Magnum Moon, Audible, Vino Rosso, and Noble Indy. Magnum Moon was ranked number two on the National Thoroughbred Racing Association top three-year-old poll of April 16 after his win in the Arkansas Derby. He had made only four starts prior to the Kentucky Derby, like Justified not having raced at age two. Audible was ranked number three, while Vino Rosso and Noble Indy were ranked seventh and eighth respectively.\nThe two colts with the best form at age two, Good Magic and Bolt d'Oro, were ranked fourth and fifth respectively on the same poll. They were the winter-book favorites for the Derby, but both suffered training setbacks that delayed their return to the racetrack. They both had one win from two starts at age three going into the Derby.\nAdding an international element to the field was Mendelssohn, trained in Ireland by Aidan O'Brien. Mendelssohn started his racing career on the turf and proved his ability to ship well by winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf at Del Mar in California in 2017. However, O'Brien felt that the colt would be equally suited to racing on the dirt given his pedigree: Mendelssohn is a half brother to multiple Eclipse Award-winner Beholder. Mendelssohn earned his berth by winning the UAE Derby in an \"astonishing\" performance while setting a track record.\nEntries for the Kentucky Derby were taken on May 1. Justify drew post position 7 and was installed as the 3-1 morning line favorite by oddsmaker Mike Battaglia.\nRace description.\nBecause the Derby was held on a rainy day, the surface of the track was sealed to mitigate the effect of heavy rain on the footing. Nonetheless, the track condition was sloppy. By post time, more than of rain had been recorded that day at nearby Louisville International Airport, breaking the Derby Day precipitation record of that had been set in 1918. Despite the rain, a crowd of 157,813 attended the event, the eighth largest in Derby history, and the wettest of all time. A record $149.2 million was bet on the Derby itself from all sources, while the full card earned an all-source handle of $225.7 million, up 8% from the previous year's record.\nOn the track, Justify's jockey Mike Smith used the colt's early speed to gain vantage position near the rail moving into the first turn. He was positioned just a length after Promises Fulfilled and maintained this position down the backstretch. Following them closely were Flameaway, Bolt d'Oro and Good Magic. Although the opening fractions (22.24 for the first quarter, 45.77 for the half, 1:11.01 for the three-quarters) were fast, Smith said Justify felt \"very comfortable\".\nIn the final turn, Bolt d'Oro and later Good Magic were both put to a drive, while Promises Fulfilled began to drop back. Justify responded to urging to open up a lead of lengths as they turned into the stretch, widening to lengths at the finish line. Bolt d'Oro tired, eventually finishing in twelfth place, but Good Magic persevered to finish second. Audible closed from twelfth place to finish third, just a head behind Good Magic.\nIt was the fifth Derby win for Baffert and the second for Smith.\nMendelssohn, who went off as the third choice in the betting, broke well from post position 14 but was hit hard shortly after the start by Magnum Moon, who veered over from post position 16. Losing ground and \"banged around in traffic\", Mendelssohn was eased and finished last. On the other hand, Instilled Regard, who broke from post position 15 and was also involved in the initial bumping incident, rallied from 17th place to finish fourth.\nResults.\nTrack: Sloppy (sealed)\nTimes: mile – 22.24; mile – 45.77; mile – 1:11.01; mile – 1:37.35; final – 2:04.20.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (22.24) (23.53) (25.24) (26.34) (26.85)\nSource: Equibase chart\nPayout.\nThe table below gives Kentucky Derby payout schedule\nSubsequent Grade I wins.\nSeveral horses went on from the Derby to post Grade I wins. Most notably, Justify completed the American Triple Crown and was named Horse of the Year."

The Wolverines, led by head coach John Beilein in his twelfth year, played their home games for the 52nd consecutive year at the Crisler Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This season marked the program's 103rd season and its 102nd consecutive year as a member of the Big Ten Conference. They finished the season 30-7, 15-5 to finish in 3rd place. In the Big 10 tournament, they defeated Iowa in the quarterfinals, Minnesota in the semifinals before losing to Michigan State in the championship.

Hibbits transferred to play for head coach Dan Majerle at Grand Canyon.\nExpectations.\nImmediately following the NCAA tournament and before the April 22, 2018 NBA draft entry deadline, early rankings were put out by many services. Michigan was ranked by some: \"Sports Illustrated\" ranked them No. 4 with Wagner and Matthews both returning, while CBS Sports (No. 22), Yahoo! Sports (No. 12) and ESPN (No. 8) expected Wagner to go pro and ranked them lower. \"Sporting News\" expected both to go pro, but ranked Michigan No. 9. \"USA Today\", who ranked Michigan No. 18, expected Wagner to leave and noted that Matthews may leave as well.

In the first tournament of the 2017–18 World Rugby Sevens Series in Dubai, 2017 World Rugby Player of the Year Perry Baker suffered a concussion, and the United States team limped to a last place finish. The U.S. improved from that point on, reaching the semifinals of the Australia Sevens. The team then won the 2018 USA Sevens, the first time the U.S. won their home tournament, boosted in large part by Perry Baker, who led all scorers with 8 tries. Baker, along with forwards Ben Pinkelman and Danny Barrett all made the tournament Dream Team.

Despite the inconsistent play, the U.S. finished sixth overall.\n2017–18 World Sevens Series.\nPlayer statistics.\nThe following table shows the leading players for the U.S. after the 2017–18 Sevens Series season.

The game was played on April 1, 2018, at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish defeated the Mississippi State Bulldogs to win their second national championship.\nThe game was won on a made basket by Arike Ogunbowale with 0.1 seconds left on the clock—she made a similar shot with 1.0 second in the semifinal to defeat Connecticut, earning Notre Dame a berth in the championship.\nParticipants.\nMississippi State.\nThe Mississippi State Bulldogs were led by sixth-year head coach Vic Schaefer. The Bulldogs opened their season by winning all 15 of their non-conference games, including three wins in the Cancún Challenge and two wins as a part of the Duel in the Desert (played in Paradise, Nevada), adding a win against the No. 9 Oregon Ducks. The Bulldogs entered SEC play ranked No. 5 in the nation, and never dropped below that ranking, as they finished the regular season 30–0, 16–0 in SEC play, including four wins over ranked conference opponents: No. 6 Tennessee, No. 15 Missouri, defending national champions No. 7 South Carolina, and No. 17 Texas A&amp;M. The Bulldogs were seeded first in the SEC tournament, where they defeated (9) Kentucky and (5) Texas A&amp;M en route to the championship game, where they fell to (2) South Carolina, 51–62 for their first loss of the season. The Bulldogs received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, where they were seeded first in the Kansas City regional. In the tournament, Mississippi State defeated (16) Nicholls State, (9) Oklahoma State, (4) NC State, and (3) UCLA en route to the Final Four, where they beat (1) Louisville in overtime, putting their record at 37–1.\nNotre Dame.\nThe Notre Dame Fighting Irish were led by 31st-year head coach Muffet McGraw. The Fighting Irish opened their season by winning eleven of their first twelve games, including three wins in the Gulf Coast Showcase and a win in the ACC–Big Ten Women's Challenge, with three of those four being ranked opponents, most notably defending champions No. 3 South Carolina. The Irish suffered their first loss in their eighth game of the season, a matchup with No. 1 Connecticut in the Jimmy V Classic. Notre Dame entered ACC play 11–1, ranked No. 2 in the nation. The Irish performed exceptionally in conference, finishing the regular season 27–2, with fifteen wins from sixteen ACC games, including three wins against ranked conference opponents (No. 8 Florida State, No. 19 Duke, and No. 21 NC State) and one win against a ranked non-conference opponent (No. 8 Tennessee). The Irish's only other loss of the season came against No. 3 Louisville in their fifth conference game; Notre Dame finished the season having won their last twelve games and were seeded second in the ACC tournament, where they defeated (7) Virginia and (3) Florida State en route to the title game, where they once again fell to Louisville. The Irish were seeded first as an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament's Spokane Regional. On their run to the title game, Notre Dame defeated (16) Cal State Northridge, (9) Villanova, (4) Texas A&amp;M, and (2) Oregon to get to the Final Four, where they faced and defeated (1) Connecticut in overtime via a made basket by Arike Ogunbowale with 1.0 seconds left.\nThe Irish reached this point despite a severely depleted roster with only seven scholarship players by the start of the NCAA tournament—four players missed part or all of the season to torn ACLs. Brianna Turner, an All-American forward in 2016–17, suffered the injury in the 2017 NCAA tournament and missed the entire season. Senior guard Mychael Johnson was lost in a preseason practice, freshman center Mikayla Vaughn after six games, and starting senior point guard Lili Thompson was lost on New Year's Eve. Before the title game, McGraw told media, \"I didn't think we'd have more ACL tears than losses. I think it's just an amazing accomplishment for this team and the resilience they've shown all year.\"\nMedia coverage.\nThe Championship Game was televised in the United States by ESPN. Adam Amin gave the play-by-play, with Kara Lawson and Rebecca Lobo as the color analysts, and Holly Rowe as the sideline reporter. Maria Taylor, Lobo, Nell Fortner and Andy Landers provided studio coverage."

The running of the balls on the table, the effect, the change of direction after the billiards and the playing of the games were pretty well done.\"\nASM were however, less positive about the game's presentation, saying \"A major disadvantage of the program is that it is extremely difficult to distinguish the colors of the balls from each other. So it is hardly possible to recognize the pink, brown and red balls as well as the yellow and the white ball.\" ASM were pleased with the graphics despite this, saying \"Of course, the mentioned drawback spoils the fun, but this disadvantage is offset by the quite realistic presentation.\" \"Zzap!64\" reviewed the game, commenting on how the poorly the game ran on the Commodore 16 system, saying that the game \"plays okay, but the screen tends to flicker quite violently at times and can prove most off-putting.\""

At the World Championships countries qualify boats rather than crews and can make crew changes for the Olympic regatta for qualified boats. Further berths are distributed to the nations at four continental qualifying regattas in Asia and Oceania, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. The last berths were distributed at the Final Olympic Qualification Regatta held in Lucerne, Switzerland 15–16 May 2021.\nAll qualifying NOCs are limited to one berth per event, and only NOCs with fewer than two berths from the World Championships may compete in the continental qualifying regattas. Host nation Japan will be automatically granted a berth each in the men's and women's single sculls, in case the nation fails to qualify for any rowing event at the various regattas. "

        "text": "The 2021 UEFA Nations League Finals was the final tournament of the 2020–21 edition of the UEFA Nations League, the second season of the international football competition involving the men's national teams of the 55 member associations of UEFA. The tournament was held in Italy from 6 to 10 October 2021, and was contested by the four group winners of Nations League A. The tournament consisted of two semi-finals, a third place play-off and final to determine the champions of the UEFA Nations League.\nPortugal were the defending champions, having won the inaugural 2019 finals. However, they failed to qualify for the 2021 finals after finishing second in their group behind France.\nFrance won the final 2–1 against Spain for their first UEFA Nations League title.\nFormat.\nThe Nations League Finals took place in October 2021 and were contested by the four group winners of League A. The four teams were each drawn into a five-team group (rather than a six-team group) for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification group stage, thereby leaving the October 2021 window available for the Nations League Finals.\nThe Nations League Finals were played in single-leg knockout matches, consisting of two semi-finals, a third place play-off and a final. The semi-final pairings were determined by means of an open draw. All matches in the tournament utilised the goal-line technology and video assistant referee (VAR) systems.\nIn the Nations League Finals, if the scores were level at the end of normal time:\nOn 31 March 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of a maximum of five substitutions in matches at the Nations League Finals (with a sixth allowed in extra time). However, each team was only given three opportunities to make substitutions, with a fourth opportunity allowed in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time. The use of five substitutes had been permitted by IFAB during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resulting fixture congestion, which created a greater burden on players.\nQualified teams.\nThe four group winners of League A qualified for the Nations League Finals.\nSchedule.\nThe Nations League Finals, originally scheduled for 2–6 June 2021, were moved to 6–10 October 2021 following the rescheduling of UEFA Euro 2020 to June and July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tournament took place over five days, with the semi-finals on 6 and 7 October (the first of which featured the host team), and the third place play-off and final three days after the second semi-final on 10 October 2021.\nHost selection.\nItaly was confirmed as the host country by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting on 3 December 2020. Only League A teams could bid for the Nations League Finals, and only one of the four participants is selected as hosts. The Nations League Finals were held in two stadiums, each with a seating capacity of at least 30,000. Ideally, the stadiums would be located in the same host city or up to approximately apart.\nOn 24 September 2020, UEFA announced that Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland had declared interest in hosting the tournament, all three of which are members of Group A1. Italy were confirmed as winners of Group A1 over the Netherlands and Poland on 18 November 2020, thereby confirming hosting rights, which were confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee on 3 December 2020, the same day as the Nations League Finals draw. If the fourth member of the group, Bosnia and Herzegovina, had qualified for the Nations League Finals, the UEFA Executive Committee would have decided the venues.\nBidding venues\nVenues.\nIn their bid dossier, the Italian Football Federation proposed the San Siro in Milan and Juventus Stadium in Turin as the venues.\nDraw.\nThe semi-final pairings were determined by means of an open draw on 3 December 2020, 17:30 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. The first two teams drawn were allocated to match pairing A, while the remaining two teams drawn were allocated to match pairing B. For scheduling purposes, the host team was allocated to the first semi-final as the administrative home team. The administrative home team for both the third place play-off and final were predetermined as the teams which advanced from semi-final 1.\nSquads.\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament. If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he was replaced by another player.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nAll times are local, CEST ().\nSemi-finals.\nItaly vs Spain.\n&lt;section begin=Semi-final 1 /&gt;&lt;section end=Semi-final 1 /&gt;\nBelgium vs France.\n&lt;section begin=Semi-final 2 /&gt;&lt;section end=Semi-final 2 /&gt;\nThird place play-off.\n&lt;section begin=Third place play-off /&gt;&lt;section end=Third place play-off /&gt;\nStatistics.\nAwards.\nPlayer of the Tournament\nThe Hisense Player of the Finals award was given to Sergio Busquets, who was chosen by UEFA's technical observers.\nTop Scorer\nThe \"Alipay Top Scorer Trophy\", given to the top scorer in the Nations League Finals, was awarded to Kylian Mbappé, who finished with two goals and two assists in the Nations League Finals. The ranking was determined using the following criteria: 1) goals in Nations League Finals, 2) assists in Nations League Finals, 3) fewest minutes played in Nations League Finals, 4) goals in league phase.\nGoal of the Tournament\nThe Gazprom Goal of the Tournament was decided by online voting. A total four goals were in the shortlist, chosen by UEFA's technical observers: Karim Benzema (against Spain), Ferran Torres (second goal against Italy), Théo Hernandez (against Belgium) and Romelu Lukaku (against France). Benzema won the award for his goal in the final.\nDiscipline.\nA player was automatically suspended for the next match for receiving a red card, which could be extended for serious offences. Yellow card suspensions did not apply in the Nations League Finals.\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:"

        "text": "Globe Rowing Club is a rowing club in Greenwich in the South East of London, England. Established in 1923, the club house and boat house are based on Crane Street in the historic centre of Greenwich, as part of the Trafalgar Rowing Trust. Its crews use the River Thames and the London Regatta Centre at the Royal Docks for water outings. The club admits male and female rowers of all ages, but is particularly known for its high performance junior programme.\nHistory.\nThe rowing club was originally established at J. Stone &amp; Co's engineering works in Deptford's Arklow Road and was called Stones Rowing Club, with membership restricted to company employees.\nIn the first years after the club was established, the boats used were heavy Clinker fours, hired from local waterman in East Greenwich and were used mainly on Sunday mornings. This was found to be cost prohibitive and, in time, the club applied to Stone's engineering works for a grant to purchase new equipment. This was refused, and as a result the club broke away from the works and set up independently to attract new members from elsewhere, with headquarters in the nearby Lord Clyde public house (western end of Clyde Street). The club was hence known as the Clyde Rowing Club.\nDuring the mid-1930s, the headquarters were moved to another public house, The Globe on Royal Hill in Greenwich (demolished ), from which the rowing club took its current name, Globe Rowing Club. The club also had a headquarters (1947) at the nearby Mitre public house in Greenwich; and for a time used a decommissioned landing craft moored opposite the Union Tavern (today The Cutty Sark) at Ballast Quay.\nGlobe was only the second club in East London after Curlew Rowing Club to hold club regattas, with the earliest taking place shortly after the end of the Second World War, the participants being watermen working on nearby Thames shuttles and barges. The club was also the first rowing club in East London to use an eight.\nIn August 1981, members of Globe Rowing Club set a Guinness World Record for \"The greatest distance for paddling a hand propelled bath tub in 24 ...by a team of 25\" The record distance set was \"60 miles 88 yd\".\nIn 2006, Greenwich Council granted permission, with contributions from Sport England, and the Trafalgar 2001 Trust Ltd for the club to develop the facilities on the corner of Crane Street and Eastney Street, creating a heated, lit boathouse, indoor training room and clubhouse known as the Trafalgar Rowing Centre.\nIn the early 2010s, Globe's Junior section began a partnership with non-profit organisation London Youth Rowing, to bring indoor and water rowing to increase participation in the sport and allow those from disadvantaged backgrounds to participate. Many of the junior members who have gone on to achieve national and international rowing success have done so as a result of the partnership with LYR.\nNotable results.\nThe club has won eight gold medals at the British Rowing Championships. The Junior section of Globe Rowing Club achieved national and international attention in the 2015–2018 quadrennium for a series of national and international medal wins and the unprecedented inclusion of 6 junior globe members in the Great British rowing trial squad.\nNotable results include:\n2017 Henley Royal Regatta – Junior Men's qualify to the heats of the Fawley Challenge Cup and beat Lea Rowing Club\n2017 Coupe de la Jeunesse – Callum Sullivan and Jake Offiler: part of the victorious Great British team.\n2004 Women's Eights Head of the River – 2nd: S4 Category (Small Clubs)\nNotable members.\nCalum Sullivan – member of the winning Cambridge crew in the Boat Race 2019, member of the winning Cambridge reserve boat crew in the Boat Race 2018, 2017 Coupe de la Jeunesse team member.\nIn 2017, Globe Junior Julia Olawumi became the first rower from the club to commit to an NCAA Division 1 school for rowing choosing the University of Tulsa in Tulsa, Oklahoma."

        "text": "The 2015 Swedish Men's Handball Championship final () was a handball match that took place at Scandinavium in Gothenburg on 24 May 2015 to decide the winner of the 2014–15 Elitserien. The match was contested by regular season winners IFK Kristianstad and defending champions Alingsås HK. Kristianstad won the match by 28–25 to win their first Swedish title since 1953.\nBackground.\nAlingsås entered the match as defending champions, having won the title in 2014. Kristianstad had most recently won the title in 1953, having lost the finals in 2012 and 2013. Kristianstad had won the regular season, 10 points ahead of second placed Alingsås (2 points for a win). Kristianstad won both matches between the teams in the regular season, winning by 30–26 at home and 28–27 away. The teams had previously faced each other in the quarter-finals in 2012 and 2013, with Kristianstad winning both times. It was the fifth time that Scandinavium hosted the final, following 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2013.\nRoad to the final.\nKristianstad defeated Hammarby IF by 3–2 in the quarter-final series, and Ystads IF by 3–1 in the semi-finals. Alingsås were undefeated in the playoffs before the final, having defeated both HK Malmö and Eskilstuna Guif in straight matches.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe first half was close and the teams were tied at 14–14 at half-time. Alingsås started the second half best and took the lead by 18–15. Kristianstad coach Ola Lindgren used a time-out 9:11 into the half, after which his team scored six unanswered goals to take the lead by 21–18. Kristianstad led by 24–22 but Alingsås came back to 24–24. Kristianstad finished the match strongly and won by 28–25. Kristianstad's Markus Olsson was the top scorer of the match at 11 goals. Jesper Konradsson scored the most goals for Alingsås, 6.\nReactions.\nOla Lindgren said after the match: \"I feel a great joy for everyone. For the guys who have put in all the work, and for the club and everyone around it who have waited an extremely long time for the gold. Many had talked about how we couldn't win a final.\" He said that he did not feel certain that they were going to win until Alingsås gave the ball away with 20 seconds left. Lindgren also praised the support for both teams at the match. Alingsås coach Mikael Franzén said that \"it was small margins – small things that were the difference. (...) But Kristiantad deserved to win. They are a good team and were better than us today.\" He also praised Kristianstad goalkeeper Leo Larsson, saying that \"[he] made some really good saves, in many ways it was decisive\". Alingsås player Daniel Tellander said that they committed too many turnovers, but praised the morale of the team."

The regatta was also the third test event for international women's rowing organised by the International Rowing Federation (FISA), with nine countries competing in four boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4+, W8+) over the shorter race distance of 1,000 m (men competed over 2,000 m). The purpose of the test event was to see whether women's rowing should formally become part of the FISA-organised European Rowing Championships.\nWomen's test event.\nThe women’s test event was the third regatta organised to check whether international women's rowing was viable. Four countries had competed at the previous test events (Mâcon in 1951 and Amsterdam in 1952): France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark. In 1953, the four initial countries were joined by Norway, Finland, Austria, West Germany and Poland. The same four boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4+, W8+) as in the two previous years were contested.\nThere were only three boats entered for the eight event and a single race decided the medals: the Netherlands won gold, silver went to Great Britain, and the Danish crew was awarded bronze.\nAs part of the 1953 European Championships, FISA held a congress in Copenhagen. It was decided for women's rowing to become an official part of the European Championships, with the first full event to be held as part of the 1954 European Rowing Championships in Amsterdam. In addition, a fifth boat class was added to the regatta from 1954: coxed quad scull."

        "text": "Three athletes from India qualified for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia held between 7 and 23 February 2014. They initially entered the competition as Independent Olympic Participants due to the ongoing suspension of India's national olympic committee (NOC), the Indian Olympic Association since 2012. However, on 11 February 2014, the IOC reinstated India's NOC, allowing two athletes, Himanshu Thakur and Nadeem Iqbal, who still had pending events to compete under the Indian flag.\nBackground.\nIndia's National Olympic Committee, the Indian Olympic Association, was suspended by the International Olympic Committee due to government interference in the autonomy of the country's NOC in December 2012. It was announced on 31 December 2013 that India would be competing under the Olympic flag in Sochi. Elections by the Indian Olympic Association were scheduled two days after the opening ceremony, which would not provide enough time for the suspension to be lifted. The IOC ultimately reinstated the Indian Olympic Association on 11 February after Narayana Ramachandran, the president of the World Squash Federation, was voted in as its new president. While Shiva Keshavan had already competed in his events as an Independent Olympic Participant at 2014 Olympics, Himanshu Thakur and Nadeem Iqbal, who still had their events pending were able to compete for India; this was the first time such a reinstatement of a NOC occurred as an Olympic Games were underway.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating in the delegation per sport.\nAlpine skiing.\nAccording to the final quota allocation released on 20 January 2014, India had one athlete in qualification position. Himanshu Thakur eventually competed under the Indian flag and finished the giant slalom competition in last place out of the competitors who finished the race.\nCross-country skiing.\nAccording to the final quota allocation released on 20 January 2014, India had one athlete in qualification position. Nadeem Iqbal became the first athlete from Jammu and Kashmir to qualify for the Winter Olympics. Iqbal eventually competed under the Indian flag and finished the race in 85th position (out of 87 competitors who completed the race) nearly 17 minutes behind the winner Dario Cologna of Switzerland.\nExternal links.\nIndependent Olympic participants\nIndia"

        "title": "2018 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony",
        "text": " \nThe opening ceremony for the 2018 Commonwealth Games took place on the evening of Wednesday 4 April in the Carrara Stadium, Gold Coast. As mandated by the Commonwealth Games Charter, the proceedings of the ceremony combined the formal opening of the sporting event (including hoisting of the flags, parade of the athletes and welcome speeches) with an artistic performance to showcase the host nation's culture. The 2018 Games were formally opened by Charles, Prince of Wales. Jack Morton Worldwide was given the contract to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The theme of the opening ceremony was Hello Earth and directed by David Zolkwer.\nThe ceremony began at 20:00 AEST and lasted almost three hours. It was watched by an estimated worldwide television of 1.5 billion. The principal sections of the artistic display represented Australia's Indigenous culture, Gold Coast's Surfers Paradise, wildlife and theme parks. A medley of Australian classics were played live by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, Queensland Youth Orchestra and Gold Coast Youth Orchestra during the parade of nations. Popular Australian recording artists such as Christine Anu, Delta Goodrem, Katie Noonan and Ricki-Lee Coulter performed at the ceremony. The opening ceremony was seen as a tremendous success and worldwide praised.\nPreparations.\nThree Australian companies: Specktak International, World Events, Dae Global and one American company Jack Morton Worldwide (JMW) submitted bids to the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC) to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. On 27 December 2015, the GOLDOC announced they chose Jack Morton Worldwide to produce the ceremonies of the games. This sparked a controversy as the head of all the three Australian Companies Ric Birch, head of Spectak, David Atkins, head of Dae Global and Julie Brooks, head of World Events questioned to GOLDOC that why an American company (JMW) was chosen for the production of ceremonies which was going to happen in Australia. Ric Birch, who co-ordinated the ceremonies of the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, called for a review of the decision to overlook three Australian companies to present the ceremonies at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. GOLDOC's head of communications Marcus Taylor said that JMW is an international company which have been working in Australia since 1983 and have a range of experiences in producing the ceremonies of events as they have previously done for 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\nOn 22 November 2017, the GOLDOC revealed some of the key artistic personnel working on the ceremonies of the games. The creative team for the opening and closing ceremonies consisted of a roster of renowned individuals. Leading the ceremonies team as Artistic Director and Project Director was David Zolkwer, Head of Jack Morton Worldwide Public Events. David previously led the teams for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Australian singer Katie Noonan, winner of five ARIA music awards and former lead singer of Brisbane based band George, was given the role of the Music Director of the ceremonies. Katie said \"I'm a fiercely proud Queensland musician; I think we make some of the best music in the world and indeed some of the best art in the world. There's some truly world class dance and music being made here, so it's a good time to focus on our (cultural) identity and realise that we're really good at what we do.\" She has served as the Artistic Director of the Queensland Music Festival since 2015.\nNathan M. Wright served as the Head of Choreography and Staging Director for the opening ceremony. Nathan is a highly respected choreographer and performer who has worked on large-scale events extensively, including choreography for the opening and closing ceremonies of both the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London and the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The role of Executive Producer for the ceremonies was given to Merryn Hughes. Merryn has also served as the Executive Producer for the ceremonies of the 2015 Pacific Games in Papua New Guinea and the closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\nProceedings.\nCountdown.\nThe opening ceremony started with a countdown from 65000 years quickly to 10–1 seconds. When the countdown is finished, a very large firework exploded in the middle of the ground of the Carrara Stadium.\nHello Earth.\nAustralian Actor Jack Thompson spoke about the history of Earth along with holding an illuminated globe.\nWhen he finished his narration, he then placed the globe in the ground which was covered with beach sand. The image of earth was projected on the ground showcasing the movement of winds, oceans, wind currents and large mass of land. A group of girls stood at the image projection of land and raised their right hands. The large mass of land immediately separated into seven continents. After the separation of land masses, a white humpback whale \"Migaloo\" was shown swimming across the oceans and diving into the land of Australia.\nFour Winds.\nWorld-renowned didgeridoo player William Barton played his instrument at the top of the Q1 tower. Hip-hop artist Mau Power from Thursday Island in the Torres Strait and Australian singer Christine Anu sang the song \"My Island Home\" along with Four Winds Didgeridoo Orchestra. A group of dancers holding small glowing spheres danced along with the song. When the song finished, the dancers immediately stood adjacent to each other forming the shape of Australian land boundary. Christine Anu sang the same song at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics and in the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney.\nWelcome of dignitaries.\nCharles, Prince of Wales, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, President of the Commonwealth Games Federation Louise Martin, Chairman of GOLDOC Peter Beattie and President of Commonwealth Games Australia Sam Coffa entered the stadium and welcomed with a huge applause by the audience. Australia's National Flag along the Australian Aboriginal Flag and the Torres Strait Islander Flag were hoisted in the stadium and Australian national anthem \"Advance Australia Fair\" was sung in an unusual way. While the anthem was sung, the image of the Australian coat of arms symbol was projected on the sand stadium's ground.\nTotem ceremony.\nAfter the history of Earth segment, the traditional totem ceremony was showcased. This part of the ceremony represented the moment of reconnecting and regeneration. It showcased a ritual in which the ceremonial knowledge of the totemic system was passed down from past ancestors and elders, through present elders, to the future elders. Performers from the Bangarra Dance Theatre and performers from the Bangarra's \"Rekindling\" programme performed a dance with shields. Rekindling is an intensive dance-based education program for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander secondary students. After the dance performance, a large firework exploded in the middle of the stadium's ground.\nSurfer’s Paradise.\nAfter the Totem ceremony segment, the Surfers Paradise scene was shown. A group of people wearing swimsuits gathered into the stadium along with props such as umbrellas, deck chairs, and beach towels. The image of the scenery of beach was projected onto the stadium's ground. Australian singer Ricki-Lee Coulter performed the song \"Technicolor Love\" and the people wearing swimsuits danced on the song.\nParade of Nations.\nFollowing tradition, the host of the previous games, Scotland entered first, followed by the rest of the European countries competing. Following this, all countries paraded in alphabetical order from their respective regions. After the European countries entered, countries from Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Caribbean, and lastly Oceania marched in. The host nation of Australia entered last. The Parade of Nations track, designed by Cairns based Torres Strait Islander visual artist Brian Robinson, was a specially commissioned artwork drawing on indigenous and local culture and mythology, featuring stars, surfboards, sea animals and shells. The young Surf Lifesavers of Australia, popularly called as the \"Nippers\", escorted the athletes carrying a surfboard bearing the country name.\nAfter the parade of Commonwealth Nations, Australian singer Katie Noonan sang \"You’re Welcome Here\" with playing a piano backed by the Gold Coast Choir. She was also the musical director of the opening and closing ceremonies of the games.\nSmoking ceremony.\nContemporary aboriginal artist Luther Cora performed a traditional smoking ceremony with his family.

        "title": "Terry Smith (American football, born 1969)",
        "text": "Terry M. Smith (born July 29, 1969) is an American college football coach and former player. He played college football at Penn State and is currently the associate head coach, defensive recruiting coordinator and Cornerbacks coach for his college alma mater.\nEarly life.\nOriginally from Aliquippa, Pa, Smith and his family moved to Monroeville, Pa where he was a star quarterback for the Gateway Gators. Smith led the Gators to back-to-back WPIAL football titles in 1985 and 1986. Considered one of the greatest WPIAL championships ever played, the 1986 game featured an undefeated Gateway team and a North Hills team that was ranked No. 1 by \"USA Today\". Smith scored Gateways only touchdown as they defeated North Hills 7–6.\nCollege career.\nNicknamed Superfly, Smith, was a four-year letter winner from 1988–91 with the Nittany Lions who still ranks among the schools’ best with 108 career receptions and 15 receiving touchdowns. During the 1991 season, posting a 40-yard dash time of 4.4 seconds, Smith came up big against USC, grabbing 10 receptions to tie a Penn State single-game mark and gaining 165 yards to set a new school record. His Senior season, Smith broke school records with 55 catches for 846 yards and eight scores, helping Penn State to an 11–2 record and a Fiesta Bowl victory over Tennessee. After breaking the single season receptions record in a game against Rutgers, Joe Paterno said about Smith, \"I don't know whether there's a better wideout in the country as far as what he does. He catches the ball, he blocks, he runs with the ball, he's in the football game -- he's just a great player.\"\nProfessional career.\nDrafted by the Washington Redskins in the 11th round of the 1992 NFL draft , Smith spent the following three seasons with the Toronto Argonauts and the Shreveport Pirates of the Canadian Football League. Smith also spent one season with the Albany Firebirds of the Arena league in 1996.\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career.\nIn 1996, Smith began his coaching career as an assistant at Hempfield High School.

In that time Smith sent 23 players to NCAA FBS (I-A) colleges and 17 more to FCS(I-AA) colleges. Smith, who also served as the athletic director, departed Gateway following the 2012 football season when his athletic director position was reduced to part-time. His salary was also cut in half and the district instituted a new rule that no administrator could coach. Following a January recruiting visit in 2013, the Temple Owls coach and fellow Penn State alum Matt Rhule offered Smith a coaching position as his wide receivers coach.\nPenn State.\nIn 2014, James Franklin hired Smith as the Penn State Nittany Lions’ defensive recruiting coordinator and cornerbacks coach, positions he currently maintains. During his first season with the Nittany Lions, the defense finished second in total defense, eighth in scoring, second in pass efficiency and sixth in 3rd down conversion percentage nationally.\nSmith added the title of assistant head coach following the season.\nLed by sophomore John Reid, who earned All-Big Ten honorable mention accolades, and Grant Haley, the cornerbacks made several key plays to help the Nittany Lions to the 2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game.\nIn 2017 Smith's starting cornerbacks, Christian Campbell and Grant Haley, earned All-Big Ten honorable mention accolades, while backup cornerback Amani Oruwariye earned second team honors. That season the Nittany Lions' defense helped Penn State to its second-straight New Year's Six bowl and a Top 10 finish. Also the 16.5 points allowed per game was the fewest since the 2008 team gave up 12.2 per contest. Campbell was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the sixth round (182nd overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft.\nIn 2018, cornerbacks Amani Oruwariye earned first team All-Big Ten honors, while John Reid received honorable mention.

The Nittany Lions also held three opponents to 60 or less yards through the air, this was the first time PSU had accomplished this feat since the 1976 season.\nIn 2019, cornerback Tariq Castro-Fields earned third team All-Big Ten honors. During the 2020 season, Smith was made the lead recruiter for the Philadelphia area. In 2021, Penn State signed its first players from the Philadelphia Public League to a recruiting class since 2016 and the first Philadelphia Catholic League player since 2017.\nPersonal.\nSmith received a Bachelors in business management, from the Pennsylvania State University.

They reached the final of the One-Day Cup. losing to Hampshire at Lord's, and the quarter-final stage of the t20 Blast. In addition, before the start of the English cricket season, Kent competed in the 2017–18 Regional Super50, the List A competition of the West Indies domestic season, reaching the semi-final stage. This was the second time that Kent have competed in the competition, having played in the 2016–17 competition.\nThe season was the second in charge for head coach, and former player, Matthew Walker and saw the arrival of new assistant coach, former South African fast-bowler Allan Donald. Donald had been expected to join the county at the start of the 2017 season but was denied a work permit as he did not, at the time, hold a suitable coaching qualification. Former Kent and England wicket-keeper Paul Downton was appointed as Director of Cricket in January. Downton, who played for Kent between 1977 and 1979, was the managing director of the England and Wales Cricket Board from February 2014 until April 2015.\nSam Billings was the club captain for the first time, having replaced Sam Northeast in January 2018. Behind the scenes, chief executive Jamie Clifford departed the club in February 2018 to take up a position at MCC whilst the chairman of the Cricket Committee, former player Graham Johnson, did not seek re-election. Clifford's interim replacement, Ben Green, had previously worked at the ECB, Surrey and at the All England Club at Wimbledon. In November Simon Storey, who had been Chief Executive of Derbyshire County Cricket Club since 2012, was recruited in the role on a permanent basis, with Green initially taking on the role of Chief Operating Officer before leaving the club the following month.\nAt the end of the season Joe Denly was voted Players' Player of the Year at the Professional Cricketers' Association awards, beating teammate Matt Henry and Surrey batsman Rory Burns.

Northeast had been given permission to speak to other counties after having been replaced as captain in January by Sam Billings. Northeast declined to sign an extended contract with Kent and would have been out of contract at the end of the 2018 season. Kent were unwilling to keep Northeast as captain in the last year of his contract and relations between the two sides broke down, with Kent reluctantly allowing Northeast permission to speak to other sides.\nDuring July all-rounder Will Gidman announced that he would retire as a player at the end of the season with a view to moving into coaching. He had deputised as Kent's Second XI coach whilst Min Patel was working with the England under-19 side. On 17 September, off-spinner James Tredwell announced his retirement from cricket after an 18-year career, having made his debut for Kent in 2000. Tredwell represented England in two Tests, 45 One Day Internationals and 17 T20 Internationals.

Kuhn, a wicket-keeper batsman, has played four Test matches for South Africa and appeared in seven Twenty20 internationals for his home country.

Brathwaite credited the influence of Kent captain Sam Billings, who he has played alongside in both the Big Bash League and Indian Premier League, in persuading him to sign for the county. On 13 July, after playing three matches, it was announced that Brathwaite had extended his stay for a fifth match, thus filling the second overseas player slot until the arrival of Stoinis.\nIn September Kent announced the signing of 24 year-old seam bowler Matt Milnes from Nottinghamshire on a three-year deal beginning at the start of the 2019 season. Milnes had played only eight first-class matches, making his Nottinghamshire debut in June, and previously having played for Durham MCCU. On 1 October Kent announced another signing for the 2019 season with Dutch international left-arm fast bowler Fred Klaassen joining on a two-year contract.\nRegional Super50.\nKent competed in the 2017–18 Regional Super50, a List A tournament that is part of the West Indian domestic season, after accepting an invitation from the West Indies Cricket Board. This was the second consecutive year that the county competed in the competition which ran from 30 January to 24 February. In the absence of club captain Sam Billings who was with the England cricket team in Australia and New Zealand, the side was captained by Joe Denly and, in Denly's absence at the end of the tour, Will Gidman. Head coach Matt Walker was also working with the England T20 team and assistant coach Allan Donald and Second XI coach Min Patel led the tour.\nKent were drawn in Group B and played two matches against each of the other teams in the group: Guyana, Jamaica, Leeward Islands and the United States. All of the county's matches took place on Antigua. After a loss against Guyana in their opening fixture, good team bowling performances and half centuries from Alex Blake and, in the next match, Zak Crawley, saw Kent beat both Jamaica and the Leeward Islands. Crawley's score of 99 not out was his highest List A score in only his fourth match, with the match ending in controversial circumstances with the opposing Leeward Islands bowling wide balls in what was seen by some as an attempt to deny Crawley the opportunity to reach his century.\nIn the following match Joe Denly's score of 96 and three wickets for Adam Riley led Kent to victory over the United States before a fine bowling performance, including career best figures of 4/20 from Will Gidman, allowed Kent to dismiss Guyana for 158 and earn a bonus point victory. A loss despite an unbeaten century from Daniel Bell-Drummond, who added 135 runs with Adam Rouse for the fifth wicket, in a close game against Jamaica followed before Kent defeated the US in a low scoring game. A win against the Leeward Islands in the final match of the group stage featured half-centuries from Bell-Drummond and Sean Dickson and four wickets from Adam Riley. The win, in a rain affected match which saw the Leewards being set 40 runs to win from seven balls after a rain delay in their innings reduced the number of overs allowed to 42, saw Kent qualify for the semi-finals, finishing second in the group behind Guyana.\nThe semi-final was also affected by rain. Barbados scored 263/3 batting first, with West Indian international Kraigg Brathwaite scoring an unbeaten century. Kent's reply was interrupted by rain on four occasions and the innings was eventually restricted to 43 overs, leaving 37 runs needed from 15 balls after the final rain delay. Despite a half-century from Sean Dickson and a 64 run partnership for the fourth wicket between Dickson and Adam Rouse, Kent could only score 216/8, losing by 13 runs to the defending champions in the competition who were described as \"talented\" and as \"probably the strongest side in the Caribbean\".\nGroup B.\nKent finished in second place in group B behind Guyana. They qualified for the semi-final stage of the qualification.\nCounty Championship.\nKent finished second in Division Two of the County Championship and were promoted to Division One for the 2019 season. They won 10 matches, which was more wins than any other team in the division, drew one and lost three, but were beaten in their final match of the season by Warwickshire who won the division as a result. The two teams had started the final match equal on points.\nThe county played 14 Championship matches in 2018, seven at home and seven at away grounds. Kent's opening fixture was at home against Gloucestershire, starting on 13 April at the St Lawrence Ground. Six of the seven home matches were scheduled to take place at the St Lawrence Ground with one match, against Warwickshire in June, scheduled to take place at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells. This match was confirmed in February after a pre-season inspection of the ground, subject to another inspection before the start of the season. Kent's match at Tunbridge Wells in 2017 almost had to be moved to another ground due to concerns over the maintenance of the ground by Tunbridge Wells Borough Council who own the site.\nJoe Denly was named as official vice-captain of the side in March and captained the side at the start of the season, while club captain Sam Billings was playing in the 2018 Indian Premier League.\nOther first-class matches.\nKent began the 2018 English cricket season with a three-day match against Oxford MCC University on 1 April. They played a four-day match against the touring Pakistanis on the same ground at the end of the month. Both matches were draws, each having been hit by poor weather.\nOnly 33 overs were possible during the match against Oxford MCCU. A wet outfield at the St Lawrence Ground delayed the start of the match but play was possible after lunch on day one with Kent scoring 100/3. Bad light stopped any play after tea on day one and heavy overnight rain made the outfield impossible to play on during days two or three of the match. Joe Denly captained the side for the first time in a home match, becoming the first Kent player born in Canterbury to captain the side in a match in the city.\nThe match against Pakistan was also drawn after being disrupted by the weather. After bowling out the Pakistanis for 168 in overcast conditions and reaching 39/1 on the first day of the match, Kent were unable to bat on either the second or third days due to a combination of bad light and persistent rain. Further play was only possible on the afternoon of the final day, with Kent scoring 209/4 from 64 overs before the match was drawn. Joe Denly scored Kent's first century of the season, making an unbeaten 113, whilst Will Gidman took 5/47 during Pakistan's innings.\nRoyal London One-Day Cup.\nKent played in the South group of the 2018 Royal London One-Day Cup, finishing third in the group and qualifying for the quarter-final stage of the competition. They played eight matches in the group stage of the competition, playing once against each of the other teams in the group. Four home matches were split between the St Lawrence Ground and the County Cricket Ground, Beckenham, each of which staged two matches.\nVitality Blast.\nKent played in the South group of the 2018 Vitality Blast. They played 14 matches, playing each of the other counties in the group at least once. Seven matches during the group stages were played at home grounds, five at the St Lawrence Ground and two at the County Cricket Ground, Beckenham. The county finished second in the group and played a home quarter-final match against Lancashire, losing by six wickets in a repeat of the 2015 quarter-final result between the two teams.\nStatistics.\nBatting.\nSource: Cricinfo\nBowling.\nSource: CricInfo"

For the sixth straight year, the Pro Bowl differed from standard NFL game rules and format in that there were no kickoffs and every quarter had a two-minute warning. Also, the play clock was only 35 seconds, and the game clock ran after pass incompletions, except with less than two minutes left in either half (or overtime, had it been necessary).\nAs with the previous Pro Bowl, a modified limited-contact form was used, and play was called dead as soon as a player was surrounded and likely to be tackled.\nSummary.\nScoring summary.\nSource:\nAFC Rosters.\nThe following players were selected to represent the AFC:\nSpecial teams.\nNotes:\nPlayers must have accepted their invitations as alternates to be listed; those who declined are not considered Pro Bowlers.\nNFC rosters.\nThe following players were selected to represent the NFC:\nSpecial teams.\nNotes:\nPlayers must have accepted their invitations as alternates to be listed; those who declined are not considered Pro Bowlers.\nBackground.\nHost selection process.\nThis was the last year of a three-year deal that began in 2017 that the Pro Bowl will be held at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida.\nBroadcasting.\nThe game was televised nationally by ESPN, and simulcasted by ABC and Disney XD, and broadcast via radio by Westwood One.

        "text": "Dana Lewis (born October 16, 1949) is a retired American collegiate and professional basketball player. Lewis was a 1st Round selection (#12 overall) of the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1971 NBA draft out of the University of Tulsa.\nEarly life.\nIn 1966, Dana Lewis moved with his mother from New York City to Newark, New Jersey. He attended Weequahic High School in Newark. There he played basketball and was a teammate of future NBA player Mo Layton in a highly successful program. In 1966-1967 Weequahic went undefeated and won the Group 4 State Championship, defending their title from the year before.\nWeequahic High School in 1965–66 and 1966–67 had each of the five starters go on to play college basketball. Two reached the National Basketball Association. The five were Layton, Lewis, Leroy Cobb, George Watson and Bill Mainor. Layton played with Phoenix and Portland in the NBA after a college career at the University of Southern California. Mainor played at Fordham, and Cobb and Watson played at Southern California with Layton.\n“Yes, that was quite a ballclub,” reminisced Les Fein, the Weequahic coach. “Not only were the boys excellent players, but they were gentlemen.”\nCollege career.\nFollowing his high school career, Lewis was heavily recruited. The Associated Press release on April 19, 1967 read as follows: \"NEWARK, N.J. (AP) Dana Lewis, Wcequahic High School's 6-foot-10 All-America basketball player, rejected the recruiting efforts of virtually every major college in the country and announced that he will attend Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., for religious reasons. Oral Roberts, which is only two years old, is named after and administered by the world-famed evangelist, acknowledged spiritual leader of the Pentecostal Church, to' which Lewis' family belongs. Lewis led Weequahic to 40 straight victories and two New Jersey State championships.\"\nAs a 6’10\" Center playing for Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma as a freshman, Lewis averaged 16.0 points and 10.2 rebounds in 24 games.\nLewis' mother had influenced him to attend Oral Roberts University for his first collegiate season, and after one season he wished to transfer. Deciding to stay in town and transfer to the University of Tulsa, Lewis needed a release from ORU to be eligible. While awaiting a release, Lewis stayed in Tulsa and got a job hauling hay. He eventually paid his own tuition the first semester at Tulsa by working a construction job. Finally, Oral Roberts himself wrote a handwritten release for Lewis to be able to play for Tulsa.\nAt Tulsa, Lewis averaged 20.3 points and 11.9 bounds in 1969-1970 and 23.3 points and 13.5 rebounds in 1970–1971, while playing under coach Ken Hayes. In 1970, Lewis was named the \"Missouri Valley Conference Newcomer of the Year.\". In 1970–1971, Lewis led the Missouri Valley Conference in scoring and was First-Team All-MVC in both Tulsa seasons. Lewis still holds the Tulsa record for Rebounds in a game with 26, vs. MacMurray College, on Dec. 27, 1969.\nOverall, in 52 games for Tulsa, Lewis averaged a double-double of 21.8 points and 12.7 rebounds over his two seasons.\nAfter graduating from Tulsa, Lewis was selected for the World University Games, where Team USA earned a bronze medal, losing to USSR in the final. George McGinnis was a teammate on the USA team.\nProfessional career.\nLewis was drafted in the 1st Round (12th overall) of the 1971 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers on May 9, 1971. Lewis was also drafted by the Virginia Squires in the 1971 ABA Draft. He chose to sign with the 76ers. Originally signing a 6-year $500,000 mostly guaranteed contract, Lewis was cut by the 76ers on Sept. 27, 1972 after the third game of the season, before appearing in an NBA game.\nLewis went on to play four seasons in the Eastern Basketball Association. He played for the Hartford Capitols (1971-1974) and the Cherry Hill Pros (1974-1975). The Capitols won the League title in 1973-1974 as Lewis averaged 12.3 points and 15.3 rebounds.\nLater, Lewis played in the Philippine Basketball Association as an \"import\" for Presto and Great Taste Coffee Makers teams from 1976 to 1979.\nHonors.\nLewis was inducted into the University of Tulsa Athletics Hall of Fame in 2019."

The top 25 sides from these progressed to five Regional Finals in 2019, with seven teams then going on to compete in the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier, along with the six lowest ranked sides from the ICC T20I Championship. In April 2018, the ICC granted full international status to Twenty20 men's matches played between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards. Therefore, all the matches in the Regional Finals were played as Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).\nThe top two teams in Group A, and the top team of Group B of the East Asia-Pacific Qualifier, progressed to the Regional Finals. Papua New Guinea won Group A, with Vanuatu finishing in second place to progress to the Finals. Group B was won by the Philippines.

In the 1840s the swim head gave way to the rounded bow that was soon replaced by a straight stem (the stemmie). Competition from the railways was causing barge builders to experiment.\n\"The Golden Dustman\", William Henry Dodd, organised the first race in 1863, giving cash prizes for the first barges in the stumpie and topsail classes. The second race in 1864 attracted 40 barges. Of the 16 stumpies and the 22 topsail barges entering in 1865, six were still in service in 1931. They sailed from Erith to The Nore and back in 5hr 47min and 5hr 14min.\nThe Stumpies commonly raced at this time with a bowsprit.

        "text": "Stephen Sullivan (July 20, 1944 – August 27, 2014) was an American professional basketball player. Sullivan played collegiately for the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team and was the 14th overall pick in the 1967 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons. The Pittsburgh Pipers also drafted Sullivan in the 1967 ABA Draft. Sullivan was a member of the USA Basketball gold medal teams of the 1967 Pan American Games and 1967 World University Games.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Newark, New Jersey and raised in East Orange, New Jersey, Sullivan attended Essex Catholic High School, graduating in 1963. He then enrolled at Georgetown University.\nCollege basketball career.\nSullivan suffered a severe ankle injury and averaged only 7.1 points over 18 games in his first varsity season (1964–65) at Georgetown. In 1965–66 he led the team in scoring (15.1) and rebounding (9.7).\nIn 1966–67, Sullivan scored in double figures in 21 of 23 games, scored 20 or more points 10 times and averaged 18.6 points and 11.8 rebounds a game. That season, Sullivan had 33 points and 17 rebounds against American University, 26 points with 23 rebounds against Syracuse University, and had 18 points and 16 rebounds against Seton Hall in his final game. Sullivan is one of only seven Georgetown players ever to lead the team in scoring and rebounding in consecutive seasons. Sullivan graduated from Georgetown as the school's seventh all–time scorer, second all–time rebounder, and was the highest NBA draft pick to date in program history. Sullivan remained the highest Georgetown NBA pick until Sleepy Floyd was the 13th pick of the 1982 NBA draft. Both were surpassed when Patrick Ewing was the 1st overall pick of the 1985 NBA draft.\nSullivan was selected as a member of the USA Basketball gold medal teams of the 1967 Pan American Games and 1968 World University Games. The USA Team for the Pan Am Games captured the gold medal by going 9–0 with the gold medal game victory over Mexico. The 1967 World University team also won the gold medal, going 7–0 and defeating Brazil 91–38 in the gold medal game. Sullivan averaged 7.2 points in the Games. Sullivan's teammates on both squads included his future Detroit fellow draft pick Sonny Dove, Jo Jo White and Wes Unseld.\nProfessional career.\nSullivan was drafted by the ABA's Pittsburgh Pipers in the 1967 ABA Draft. Pittsburgh had just signed Connie Hawkins at power forward, so Sullivan waited for the NBA draft that summer. Selected 14th in the draft by the Detroit Pistons in an overall draft that included Earl Monroe, Pat Riley, Clem Haskins, Walt Frazier, and Phil Jackson, the Pistons had two of the first four overall picks. The Pistons drafted Jimmy Walker with the first overall pick, then drafted Sonny Dove with the 4th overall pick. The Pistons eventually opted to keep Dove on the roster over Sullivan.\nLater, Sullivan spent nine years professionally playing in Italy and Spain, receiving numerous MVP awards.\nDeath.\nAfter living and working for 45 years in Spain, Italy and England, Sullivan passed away in London, England on August 27, 2014, surrounded by his family."

        "title": "2034 FIFA World Cup bids",
        "text": "The 2034 FIFA World Cup bidding process resulted in the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) selecting Saudi Arabia as the location for the 2034 FIFA World Cup as the host nation.\nHost selection.\nThe bidding process for the 2034 World Cup began on 4 October 2023 and used the same requirements as the 2030 World Cup. Due to FIFA's confederation rotation policy, only member associations from the Asian Football Confederation and Oceania Football Confederation were eligible to host. FIFA made the decision to host the 2030 World Cup in three continents (Africa, Europe and South America) and the 2026 World Cup was set to be held in North America, which meant that the 2034 World Cup would necessarily have to be held in Asia or Oceania. According to a \"New York Times\" report, observers saw this as paving the path for Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 World Cup by substantially reducing potential hosting bids.\nOn 31 October 2023, FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced that Saudi Arabia would host the 2034 World Cup, making it the third time the Asian Football Confederation hosted the World Cup, after the 2002 tournament in Japan and South Korea and the 2022 tournament in Qatar, as well as the second time being held in the Middle East, after Qatar 2022.\nBids.\nSaudi Arabia.\nAfter Saudi Arabia abandoned its 2030 bid alongside Greece and Egypt, they switched their focus to a solo 2034 bid. Similar strategies to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, which was held in November-December as opposed to the usual summer scheduling, may be used to mitigate the country's summer heat, though the Saudi FA have insisted on a plan to host in the summer. The country's bid was announced on 4 October 2023. On 5 October, AFC President Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa backed Saudi Arabia's bid. On the 9th, Saudi Arabia announced that it submitted the official letter of intent, and signed the declaration to FIFA to bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup, and that over 70 different member associations already pledged their support for its bid.\nDeclined bids.\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nThe first bid for the 2034 FIFA World Cup was proposed as a collective bid by the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ten countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam). The idea of a combined ASEAN bid was mooted as early as January 2011, when the former Football Association of Singapore President, Zainudin Nordin, said in a statement that the proposal was made at an ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting, despite the fact that countries cannot bid (as that's up to national associations). In 2013, Nordin and Special Olympics Malaysia President, Datuk Mohamed Faisol Hassan, recalled the idea for ASEAN to jointly host a World Cup. Under FIFA rules as of 2017, the 2030 World Cup cannot be held in Asia (AFC) as Asian Football Confederation members are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Qatar in 2022. Therefore, the earliest bid by an AFC member could be made for 2034.\nLater, Malaysia withdrew from involvement, but Singapore and other ASEAN countries continued the campaign to submit a joint bid for the World Cup in 2034. In February 2017, ASEAN held talks on launching a joint bid during a visit by FIFA President Gianni Infantino to Yangon, Myanmar. On 1 July 2017, Vice General Chairman of the Football Association of Indonesia Joko Driyono said that Indonesia and Thailand were set to lead a consortium of Southeast Asian nations in the bid. Driyono added that due to geographic and infrastructure considerations and the expanded format (48 teams), at least two or three ASEAN countries combined would be in a position necessary to host matches.\nIn September 2017, the Thai League 1 Deputy CEO Benjamin Tan, at the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Council meeting, confirmed that his Association \"put in their interest to bid and co-host\" the 2034 World Cup with Indonesia. On the same occasion, the General Secretary of the AFF, Dato Sri Azzuddin Ahmad, confirmed that Indonesia and Thailand would submit a joint bid. Indonesia was the first Asian team and the only Southeast Asian country to have participated in the World Cup, when the territory was known as the Dutch East Indies.\nHowever, in June 2018, FIFA executive committee member, Yang di-Pertuan Agong and Sultan of Pahang, Tengku Abdullah, who is also the former president of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM), expressed interest in joining the two countries in hosting the World Cup together. The same year, Vietnam expressed interest in joining the bid for the same competition, despite some infrastructure concerns. The four countries jointly hosted a football event before during the 2007 AFC Asian Cup.\nIn June 2019, the Prime Minister of Thailand, Prayut Chan-o-cha, announced that all 10 nations of ASEAN would launch a joint-bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup, being the first to submit a ten-country joint bid in the FIFA World Cup history.\nOn 9 October 2019, five ASEAN countries officially proposed hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup. Thailand is to lead the initiative.\nOn 15 June 2022, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, in his role as chair of ASEAN, said he would urge Southeast Asian leaders to bid to host the FIFA World Cup in 2034 or 2038.\nAustralia and with other hosts.\nAfter its failed bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Australia considered a joint bid with neighbouring New Zealand, an OFC member with which they co-hosted the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. Australia re-established this intention in August 2021, shortly after Brisbane's success in bidding to host the 2032 Summer Olympics. A joint bid with Indonesia and other ASEAN nations instead of New Zealand was also discussed by Football Australia. However, Indonesia remained reluctant to the joint bid with Australia, considering the country is also taking part in the ASEAN bid for the same competition. An alternative suggestion is for Australia and New Zealand to partner alongside Malaysia and Singapore, instead of Indonesia even though both countries are also involved in the ASEAN bid as well.\nFootball Australia chief executive, James Johnson, said his organisation is \"exploring the possibility\" following FIFA's deadline for bids to be submitted by 31 October 2023. A major challenge to the bid however was the need to construct more stadiums or expand current stadiums to FIFA standards. Indonesia was in talks with Australia, Singapore, and Malaysia with a joint bid, though they pulled out on 18 October, backing the Saudi bid instead like much of the AFC.\nOn 31 October, Football Australia put out a statement saying that they decided against bidding, leaving Saudi Arabia as the sole bid.\nOther bids.\nBefore the 2034 World Cup confirmed to be in Asia and Oceania, these were other countries that were interested in bidding for the World Cup."

It ranks fourth on all-time placing tables at the competition, reflecting its narrow event focus. The nation typically sends medium-sized delegations of 40–50 athletes. Kenya ranked number one on gold medals at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics and has finished in the top five nations on the medal table at all but five editions.\nThe country's most successful athlete at the competition is Ezekiel Kemboi, who has won four gold medals and three silver medals in the men's 3000 metres steeplechase. Kenya's most successful woman, Faith Kipyegon has won four gold medals and two silver medals in the 1500 metres and 5000 metres. Vivian Cheruiyot, has also won four gold medals and also a silver in the 5000 metres and 10,000 metres events. Men's steeplechaser Moses Kiptanui won three straight titles from 1991 to 1995 and Asbel Kiprop achieved the same feat in the 1500 metres from 2011 to 2015. Julius Yego is the country's only field event medallist, having won the men's javelin throw in 2015.\nFormer Kenyans have also had impacts for other nations at the championships, including 2007's double champion Bernard Lagat (United States), two-time steeplechase champion Saif Saaeed Shaheen (Qatar) and marathon winner Rose Chelimo (Bahrain).\nDoping.\nCompared to other successful nations, such as the United States and Russia, Kenya's athletes have been largely unaffected by doping failures at the competition. The nation's first failures at the championships occurred in 2015, neither of whom were finalists."

        "text": "The 2021 Copa América was the 47th edition of the Copa América, the international men's football championship organised by South America's football ruling body CONMEBOL. The tournament took place in Brazil from 13 June to 10 July 2021. The tournament was originally scheduled to take place from 12 June to 12 July 2020 in Argentina and Colombia as the 2020 Copa América. On 17 March 2020, CONMEBOL announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in South America, the tournament had been postponed for a year, in conjunction with UEFA's decision to also postpone UEFA Euro 2020 to 2021. This was the first time since 1991 where no guest nation took part in the tournament.\nOn 20 May 2021, Colombia was removed as co-host amid ongoing protests against President Iván Duque Márquez, and Argentina was then removed on 30 May due to COVID-19 issues. The following day CONMEBOL confirmed Brazil as the new host of the tournament.\nHosts Brazil were the title holders, having won their ninth title in 2019, which they also hosted. Argentina won their fifteenth title after defeating Brazil 1–0 in the final, marking the first time Brazil failed to win the competition on home soil. Argentina secured a first senior trophy since the 1993 edition of the same tournament, also equalling Uruguay's overall record of Copa América titles.\nBackground.\nIn March 2017, CONMEBOL reportedly proposed that the Copa América take place in 2020 as part of a calendar change. Following the 2019 edition in Brazil, the quadrennial tournament would move from odd to even years starting in 2020, with the following edition taking place in United States in 2024, having previously held the one-off Copa América Centenario in 2016, which celebrated the centenary of CONMEBOL and the Copa América. This would move the tournament in line with the UEFA European Championship, which is also held in even years with a 2020 edition taking place. On 18 September 2018, plans for a calendar change were confirmed by CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez after submitting an official request to FIFA.\nOn 26 October 2018 at the FIFA Council meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, the request was approved for the Copa América to take place in even years, starting with the 2020 edition. The tournament was originally scheduled to take place between 12 June and 12 July 2020, the same dates as UEFA Euro 2020.\nOn 13 March 2019, CONMEBOL announced Argentina and Colombia as co-hosts of the 2020 event after the United States bid was rejected. It was officially announced the same day when CONMEBOL approved of the joint hosting. It was officially awarded on 9 April 2019 at the CONMEBOL Congress in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nOn 20 May 2021, due to security concerns amid protests against the government of President Iván Duque Márquez, Colombia was dropped as co-host of the tournament. On 30 May 2021, Argentina later dropped as co-host of the tournament due to COVID-19 travel restriction.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in South America began impacting football. FIFA announced that the first two rounds of the South American qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup, due to take place in March, were postponed, while CONMEBOL temporarily suspended the Copa Libertadores. On 17 March 2020, CONMEBOL announced that the Copa América would be postponed to the following year, taking place from 11 June to 11 July 2021, in conjunction with UEFA and IOC decision to also postpone UEFA Euro 2020 and 2020 Summer Olympics to 2021, in order to protect the health and safety of the teams, media, visitors and host cities. On the following day, the Bureau of the FIFA Council approved the date change in the FIFA International Match Calendar. As a result, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup, which was due to take place in June and July 2020, was rescheduled to 2021.\nOn 22 February 2021, two invited guest teams Australia and Qatar pulled out of tournament, due to postponement and reschedule for second round for 2022 FIFA World Cup Asian qualification.\nOn 20 May 2021, CONMEBOL announced to Colombia was withdrawn from host, due to 2021 Colombian protests. Two day later, Argentina went under a nine-day lockdown due to soaring COVID-19 cases, which included the suspension of all domestic football. On 30 May 2021, CONMEBOL announced that due to the current circumstances in the country, Copa América would be pulled from Argentina, and that they were looking at bids from other countries to host the tournament. This reportedly included a bid from the United States, after that bid was initially rejected. It was reported that the Argentine government had made increasing demands for biosecurity protocols that CONMEBOL found unreasonable. On 31 May Brazil was confirmed as the new host.\nAll matches in the tournament were held behind closed doors, except the final, where 10% of Maracanã Stadium's capacity was allowed for guests with a negative COVID-19 test before entering. All delegations, each limited to 65 members, were vaccinated, as were the match officials.\nVenues.\nOn 1 June 2021, the Brazilian government and Brazilian Football Confederation announced the cities of Brasília, Goiânia, Cuiabá and Rio de Janeiro as the host venues of the competition, with the Maracanã, Mané Garrincha, Pantanal and the Olímpico stadiums used for matches. On 2 June, the CBF decided to use the Nilton Santos as the second stadium in Rio de Janeiro. The government also allocated resources in the federal budget to provide the necessary support for the CONMEBOL's tournament logistics and security. Mané Garrincha hosted the opening match on 13 June, and the final was held at the Maracanã on 10 July.\nOriginal venues.\nOn 20 November 2019, CONMEBOL published a document confirming eight venues, Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes in Córdoba, Estadio Malvinas Argentinas in Mendoza, Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires and Estadio Ciudad de La Plata in La Plata for Argentina and Estadio Olímpico Pascual Guerrero in Cali, Estadio Atanasio Girardot in Medellín, Estadio Metropolitano Roberto Meléndez in Barranquilla and Estadio El Campín in Bogotá for Colombia. Moreover, Estadio San Juan del Bicentenario in San Juan and Estadio Hernán Ramírez Villegas in Pereira were also nominated but not confirmed, being finally dismissed.\nOn 3 December 2019, prior to the draw, it was known that Estadio Único in Santiago del Estero was included as one of the Argentine venues.\nOn 15 March 2021, the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata, La Plata venue was ruled out as a result of the schedule shortening.\nColombia would have hosted the North Zone group, while Argentina would have hosted the South Zone group. Each country would also have hosted two quarter-finals and one semi-final. The third place match and final would have been played in Colombia.\nTeams.\nAll ten CONMEBOL national teams participated in the competition, divided into two geographical zones for the group stage.\nIn June 2019, the CONMEBOL Council officially approved the participation of Australia and Qatar as the two invited teams, who were the previous two winners of the AFC Asian Cup. Australia would have made their debut appearance in the Copa América, while Qatar would be making their second appearance, having participated in the previous edition. However, on 23 February 2021, Football Australia and the Qatar Football Association announced their withdrawal from the tournament, due to the postponement of the remainder of the AFC second round of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification to June 2021. Following the withdrawals, a CONMEBOL spokesperson said that there was a calendar issue that stopped Australia and Qatar, that he had already seen interest from other national teams to play as guests in their place and that he would like to have 12 teams. The spokesperson added that if no replacements were found, the tournament would be played with 10 teams (for the first time since 1991).\nDraw.\nThe team allocations of the CONMEBOL members, divided into North Zone and South Zone, were announced on 9 April 2019. The group stage draw was held on 3 December 2019, 19:30 COT (), in Cartagena. Original co-hosts Argentina and Colombia were automatically allocated to positions A1 and B1, respectively. After the draw, the zones for the two invited nations and the positions of teams within the groups were as follows:\nOn 2 June 2021, Argentina and Brazil were allocated to positions A1 and B1, respectively, in the competition calendar update.\nSquads.\nEach team had to submit a list of up to 28 players (expanded from 23), including at least three goalkeepers.\nMatch officials.\nOn 21 April 2021, CONMEBOL announced a total of 14 referees, 22 assistant referees, 16 video assistant referees (VAR), and 10 support referees appointed for the tournament. This edition featured the participation of a Spanish refereeing team as part of the memorandum of understanding signed by CONMEBOL and UEFA in February 2020, which included a referee exchange programme.\nOn 5 June 2021, Uruguayan video assistant referees Leodán González and Daniel Fedorczuk were replaced by Andrés Cunha, also from Uruguay. In addition, Juan Soto from Venezuela and Jhon Alexander León from Colombia replaced the video assistant referee Nicolás Gallo and the assistant referee Miguel Roldán respectively, both from Colombia. Nicolás Gallo and Miguel Roldán had previously been suspended indefinitely as a result of their performance in the match between Uruguay and Paraguay valid for the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers.\nLater, Leodán González and Daniel Fedorczuk were summoned again to join the Uruguayan referee team.\nGroup stage.\nThe original schedule and kick-off times for the tournament were announced on 3 December 2019 and 4 March 2020 respectively. On 17 March 2020, the tournament was postponed until 2021 and the new schedule was announced on 13 August 2020. Following the withdrawals of Qatar and Australia, the schedule was shortened and it was announced on 15 March 2021. The final match schedule with Brazil as host country was announced on 2 June 2021.\n\"All match times listed are in BRT (), as listed by CONMEBOL.

        "title": "2018 UMBC vs. Virginia men's basketball game",
        "text": "On March 16, 2018, during the first round of the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the University of Virginia (Virginia; also UVA) Cavaliers played a college basketball game against the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) Retrievers at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Cavaliers, who were seeded first in the South regional bracket and first overall in the NCAA tournament, faced the Retrievers, who were seeded 16th in the south regional bracket. Virginia and UMBC competed for the right to face ninth-seeded Kansas State, which had already won their first-round game against Creighton earlier in the day.\nAfter a close first half that saw the teams finish tied 21–21, UMBC took over in the second half and defeated the Cavaliers 74–54, becoming the first No. 16 seed to defeat a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. It was only the second time in college basketball overall, after No. 16 seeded Harvard defeated overall No. 1 Stanford in the women's tournament twenty years earlier. UMBC also earned its first NCAA tournament win in school history. With Virginia set as a 20.5 point favorite heading into the game, UMBC's victory stands as the third-biggest upset in terms of point spread in NCAA Tournament history behind Norfolk State's defeat of Missouri in 2012 when Missouri was a -point favorite, and Fairleigh Dickinson's defeat of Purdue in 2023 when Purdue was a -point favorite. Virginia finished their season at 31–3 while UMBC improved to 25–10.\nUMBC coach Ryan Odom, the son of former Virginia assistant coach Dave Odom, grew up as a UVA fan, and recalled the experience of being in attendance when the Cavaliers advanced to the Final Four in 1984.\nBackground.\nAt the start of this game, NCAA tournament No. 16 seeds were 0–135 all-time against No. 1 seeds since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Although there had been close games, such as the 1989 Georgetown vs. Princeton game, a No. 16 seed had never managed to hold a lead through the end of a game.\nUMBC.\nUMBC entered its 2017–18 season under second-year head coach Ryan Odom. A preseason America East Conference coaches' poll picked the Retrievers to finish third in their league, and incoming senior guard Jairus Lyles earned Preseason All-Conference honors. The team completed the regular season with a 24–10 record and a second-place finish in the America East. Lyles, who averaged a team-high 20.3 points per game, and another senior guard, K. J. Maura, were named first team and third team all-conference respectively, with the latter earning America East defensive player of the year accolades.\nOn March 10, 2018, UMBC won the 2018 America East tournament after Lyles made a three-pointer with 0.6 seconds left to defeat top-seeded Vermont in the championship game. The win handed the Retrievers an automatic NCAA tournament berth, their second appearance ever and their first since 2008, when they suffered a 66–47 loss to Georgetown in their opening game. It also gave UMBC its 24th win of the season, tied for most in program history. Before the team's NCAA Tournament opener against Virginia, guard-forward Joe Sherburne said, \"We know we can go out there and have fun and play hard, and we really don't have anything to lose, so it'll be we go out there and play loose.\" 5 years later, FDU would become the second 16 seed to upset a number 1 seed as they would upset top-seed Purdue 63–58 in the 2023 NCAA tournament.\nVirginia.\nIn a rebuilding year under head coach Tony Bennett, Virginia had entered the season unranked but proceeded to win the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) regular season championship outright by four games over pre-season AP No. 1 Duke, finishing 17–1 in conference play including Bennett's first win at Cameron Indoor Stadium. They then capped an improbable ascendancy by defeating North Carolina in the ACC tournament championship, finishing the regular season 31–2. Virginia entered the tournament seeded first overall.\nTwo days before the UMBC game, the Cavaliers lost their future NBA lottery pick, forward De'Andre Hunter, to a season-ending left wrist fracture. The injury led the \"New York Daily News\" to change their pick from Virginia winning the national championship to not advancing out of the Sweet Sixteen.\nVenue.\nThe game was played at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The attendance for the game was 17,943. Spectrum Center had previously hosted the tournament in 2008, 2011, and 2015.\nBroadcast.\nThe game was televised nationally as part of \"NCAA March Madness\" on TNT and announced by Charlotte native Jim Nantz, Bill Raftery, and Grant Hill, with Tracy Wolfson as their sideline reporter. The game was played after the conclusion of the Kansas State–Creighton game, which took place in the same venue. The game had 3.53 million viewers, with a 94% and 54% increase in viewership compared to the 2016 and 2017 games in the same slot.\nGame summary.\nThe game started defensively with the first half having four separate ties. UMBC did not lead until just before the midpoint of the half, before a Virginia steal tied the game up for the second time. Virginia went on a 7–1 run over a four-minute period to hold a six-point lead late in the first half before UMBC managed to tie the game at 16–16 before the final TV timeout of the half. UMBC took the lead twice before halftime, but Virginia was able to tie the game up at both points.\nComing out of halftime, the Retrievers went on an early 7–2 run before Virginia used their first of three remaining timeouts of the game. Despite the timeout, a 6–2 run before the first TV timeout of the half gave the Retrievers an 11-point lead. Another UMBC run of 10–4 would force the Cavaliers to use a second timeout. An 11–7 run by Virginia allowed them to get within 12 points before UMBC was forced to use their timeout. Both teams would stall as only eight combined points were scored by both teams before the Retrievers' second timeout. A 5–0 run by UMBC within a minute forced Virginia to use their final timeout. Despite the break, fouls by Virginia contributed to UMBC making four free throws and scoring a layup on a missed free throw, which allowed the lead to be extended to 19 points. The final two minutes would see the Retrievers extend their lead by another point to finish the game 74–54.\nThe Cavaliers, who led the NCAA during the season in scoring defense at 53.4 points per game, were outscored by the Retrievers 53–33 in the final twenty minutes. The 20-point loss was the largest deficit the Cavaliers suffered their entire season. It was also the only time they allowed as many as 70 points that season. UMBC's Jairus Lyles, who scored 28 points while battling through cramps late in the second half, was named the game's most valuable player.\nBox score.\nSource:\nAftermath and redemption.\nImmediately after the game in an interview, Virginia coach Tony Bennett remarked, \nBennett continued to say, \nThis reaction by Bennett after the game was featured in \"Inc.\" magazine as a lesson in emotional intelligence and leadership. After the win, Odom said, \"Unbelievable — it's really all you can say.\"\nUMBC advanced to the round of 32, in which they faced the 9-seed Kansas State Wildcats on March 18, 2018. The game was competitive, with neither team having a lead greater than nine points throughout the game, and UMBC trailing by only three points with two minutes remaining in the game. The Wildcats won the game 50–43, thus ending UMBC's one-game Cinderella run.\nThe first round losses by No. 1 seed Virginia and No. 4 seed Arizona, and second round losses by No. 2 seed Cincinnati and No. 3 seed Tennessee, led to the south region becoming the first ever to not advance any of its top four seeds to the Sweet Sixteen. Another Cinderella, No. 11 seed Loyola-Chicago, won the region by beating Kansas State 78–62, becoming the fourth 11-seed ever to advance to the Final Four.\nFollowing the season, two members of the Retrievers staff became head coaches. Assistant coach Eric Skeeters took over the Delaware State program, while director of recruiting Griff Aldrich took over Longwood. Delaware State and Longwood met in the 2018–19 season, with the host team Longwood winning 89–73. Aldrich then led Longwood to their first ever Division I postseason appearance in the 2019 College Basketball Invitational, and was named a finalist for the Joe B. Hall Award (given for most outstanding first-year head coach), which had been won by Odom in 2017. A member of the Virginia coaching staff, Ron Sanchez, also left to become a new head coach as he took over the Charlotte 49ers in the same city the UMBC game was played in.\nIn 2018–19, Virginia again led the Atlantic Coast Conference standings and attained another No. 1 seed. Virginia trailed by as many as 14 points to No. 16 seed Gardner-Webb in the first half and still trailed by 6 (36–30) at halftime, before the Cavaliers poured it on and outscored the Runnin' Bulldogs 41–14 in the first nineteen minutes of the second half. Virginia went on to win the 2019 NCAA tournament championship in dramatic fashion, becoming the first first-time winner of the national championship since Florida thirteen years prior. UMBC, meanwhile, lost to Vermont in the championship game of the America East conference tournament, ending their hopes for an immediate return to the tourney. In a show of sportsmanship, the official UMBC athletics Twitter account celebrated Virginia's dramatic victory over Purdue in the Elite Eight. ESPN called Virginia's 2018–19 championship run \"the most redemptive season in the history of college basketball.\" NBC Sports called Virginia's 2018–19 NCAA title the \"greatest redemption story in the history of sports\". Following the championship game, veteran CBS Sports announcer Jim Nantz (who also called Virginia's upset loss to UMBC in the previous year's first round tournament game), called Virginia's win the \"all-time turnaround title\". De'Andre Hunter (who missed the UMBC game with the broken wrist) was drafted number 4 as a lottery pick in the 2019 NBA draft, as Ty Jerome and Kyle Guy also left early and were drafted as well.\nFive years later, in the 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, a similar upset would take place between No. 1 Purdue and No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson. FDU won 63–58, joining the Retrievers in being the only No. 16 seeds to advance to the Round of 32. Coincidentally, similar to the Cavaliers years prior, the Boilermakers would have their own shot at redemption a year after their upsetting defeat, with Purdue not only regaining the No. 1 seed the following season for the 2024 NCAA Tournament, but also going as far as the championship match themselves. However, unlike with Virginia's shot at redemption, Purdue would fail to fully clinch their chance that season, losing 75-60 to the team that were known as the defending champions at the time, the UConn Huskies."

        "title": "Global Rapid Rugby",
        "text": "Global Rapid Rugby was an international rugby union competition that launched a showcase series for six professional teams in 2019, played in locations across the Asia-Pacific region. Rapid Rugby matches are slightly shorter than the traditional 80 minutes and have other variations from standard rugby laws that are intended to increase the speed of the game.\nThe 2020 Global Rapid Rugby season was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic after only one completed round of competition.\nHistory.\nThe competition was conceived and is supported by the Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest. It was devised after the Western Force rugby team based in Perth, Western Australia was unilaterally dropped from the Australian Super Rugby Conference.\nBackground.\nFollowing SANZAAR's decision to reduce the number of Super Rugby teams for 2018, the Australian Rugby Union (now Rugby Australia) announced in August 2017 that the Western Force would be one of the teams cut from the 2018 competition. In the following month, Perth-based businessman Andrew Forrest announced that he would create a new tournament called the Indo Pacific Rugby Championship which would include the Western Force and five other teams from the Indo-Pacific region.\nFor the 2018 season, the competition was launched as World Series Rugby, played as a series of exhibition matches as the precursor to a wider Asia-Pacific competition planned for 2019. The newly reformed Western Force played international teams from Hong Kong, Samoa, and Tonga along with Super Rugby teams the Crusaders and Melbourne Rebels, Japanese Top League team Panasonic Wild Knights, and the Fiji Warriors, the second-tier national side. The series began on 4 May 2018.\nRapid Rugby launched.\nThe competition was re-branded in November 2018 as Global Rapid Rugby, and the Hong Kong Rugby Union was appointed the governing body for the competition ahead of the 2019 season. A season of fourteen matches was played in 2019, featuring the Western Force playing a Pacific Showcase Series in a round-robin format with teams from Fiji and Samoa, as well as an Asian Showcase Series in a round-robin format with teams based out of Hong Kong and Singapore. One-off matches were also played against a World XV coached by Robbie Deans, and the Malaysia Valke. The Singapore-based team, the Asia Pacific Dragons, did not continue in Rapid Rugby after the 2019 season and was replaced by the China Lions in 2020.\nTeams.\nSix teams compete in Rapid Rugby:\nLaw variations.\nLaw variations for Rapid Rugby included:\nSuper Rugby in Australia averages around 30-minutes of ‘ball-in-play’ per match. However, the matches in 2018 World Series Rugby – the precursor to Rapid Rugby – had a comparable 'ball-in-play' time almost 30% greater.\nPlayers.\nGlobal Rapid Rugby aims to attract about 20 of the world's top 100 rugby players with marquee contracts to be spread across the eight franchises. There is no salary cap in place for the competition.\nMedia coverage.\nRapid Rugby currently has live broadcast television coverage in 18 countries across Asia and Oceania. Live streaming and video on demand services reach additional viewers within some Asia-Pacific countries, while Rapid Rugby's own website provides live streams and highlight packages to other regions worldwide.\nFor the 2019 showcase series, nine of the fourteen matches over the season were televised. Fox Sports in Australia and related companies Star Sports and Fox Sports Asia will provide the live coverage.\nNational broadcaster SBS showed all nine of these matches live on free-to-air television across Australia via its SBS Viceland channel and also streamed through SBS on Demand. Other Rapid Rugby media partners included Kayo Sports in Australia, Sky Sport in New Zealand and Fiji TV.\nCorporate relations.\nSponsorship.\nThe 2019 showcase series does not currently have a principal naming rights partner, but major official partners include IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts, K&amp;L Gates and Harvey Beef.\nThe official rugby ball supplier is Rhino Sport."

        "title": "2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two",
        "text": "The 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two was an international cricket tournament that took place in April 2019 in Namibia. It was contested by six teams; Canada, Hong Kong, Oman, Papua New Guinea, the United States and tournament hosts Namibia. It formed part of the 2017–19 cycle of the World Cricket League (WCL) which determined the qualification for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. The final and third-place playoff match were granted One Day International (ODI) status by the International Cricket Council. Namibia won the tournament, after they beat Oman by 145 runs in the final. It was Namibia's first win in an ODI match, and it was the first ever ODI match played by Oman.\nSummary.\nHong Kong and Papua New Guinea finished in the bottom two places in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, therefore relegating them to the Division Two tournament and losing their ODI status in the process. They were joined by Canada and Namibia, who finished third and fourth respectively in the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament, and Oman and the United States, who won promotion from the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Three tournament.\nAhead of the tournament in October 2018, it was announced that, following the conclusion of the tournament, the World Cricket League would be replaced by the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 and the ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League. The top four teams would join Scotland, Nepal and the United Arab Emirates in League 2 and gain ODI status. The bottom two teams would be assigned to the Challenge League along with other teams from the World Cricket League.\nThe United States were the first team to qualify for League 2, after they beat Hong Kong by 84 runs in the fourth round of matches. Oman also qualified in the same round of fixtures, after they beat tournament hosts Namibia by four wickets. In the final round of matches, Namibia and Papua New Guinea secured League 2 qualification with big wins. Canada won their final match, against the United States, but finished narrowly behind Papua New Guinea on net run rate and qualified for the Challenge League, along with Hong Kong.\nFollowing the round-robin matches, Canada played Hong Kong in the fifth-place playoff, the United States played Papua New Guinea in the third-place playoff, and hosts Namibia faced Oman in the tournament's final. Claire Polosak was appointed as one of the on-field umpires for the final, becoming the first woman to stand in a men's ODI match.\nTeams.\nSix teams qualified for the tournament:\nPreparation.\nThe United States took part in a one-week tour to Antigua, playing five matches, starting on 10 February 2019. USA Cricket also looked at arranging warm-up fixtures against Australia and Pakistan, followed by two Twenty20 International (T20I) matches against the United Arab Emirates, and some 50 over matches in the UAE during March 2019. Oman hosted a Twenty20 International (T20I) quadrangular series followed by three List A games against Scotland in February 2019, before taking part in an eight-team T20 tournament in Kenya during March 2019. Canada played practice matches in Sri Lanka and South Africa before naming their final squad.\nPapua New Guinea and Hong Kong were both aiming to regain ODI status after losing it at the conclusion of the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. Canada were attempting to regain ODI status that they had lost in 2014, and had recruited the experienced Monty Desai to help guide them back to the top tier of Associate cricket. Hosts Namibia had been regulars in the top divisions of the World Cricket League, but their only previous ODIs were back in 2003, and they had faced a lack of international cricket in the months prior to the tournament in relation to their opponents. The United States were competing in Division Two for the first time, and were a team on the rise following a change in administration. Oman's form had fluctuated since qualifying for the 2016 World T20, the low point coming when they were bowled out for just 24 runs in a List A game against Scotland in February 2019.\nFixtures.\nThe following fixtures were confirmed in January 2019.\nPlayoffs.\nThe final and third-place playoff matches were given ODI status by the ICC, with the fifth-place playoff being a List A match. Oman played in their first ever ODI match. The United States played their first ODI match in fifteen years, after playing two matches in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in September 2004."

American Gail Devers is the second most successful woman individually, with four golds and two silver medals from the 100-meter dash and 100-meter hurdles. Felix and Amy Acuff have made the most appearances for the United States, each having represented their country at eight separate editions.\nThe United States team was affected by doping during the period from 1997 to 2003, principally in sprinting events. The loss of several gold medals in 2001 resulted in the United States dropping to second in the medal rankings for the first time since 1987.\nBest placings.\nOf the 50 events that have been held over the history of the championships, 30 have been won by American athletes (17 men's events and 13 women's events). A further 4 men's and 5 women's events have featured an American medallist at some point. Americans have topped the podium in all sprint and hurdles events, as well as all the men's jumps. By far the weakest events of the United States are men's and women's racewalking and women's throws – only four bronze medals have been won by American athletes in these disciplines, among a total of over 350 medals across events. Americans have featured in the final at some point of every discipline contested at the championships.\nThis table shows the best place finish by an American athlete by event. Where the best position has been achieved multiple times, the first instance is shown."

In order for Russian nationals to compete at the World Athletics Championship (from 2017 on), they must be approved as authorised neutral athletes by the IAAF. Prior to 1993, Russian athletes competed for the Soviet Union. Russia has the second-highest medal total among nations at the competition (153), after the United States. At 47 gold medals, it holds the third-highest total after the United States and Kenya. It has had the most success in women's events and in field events. As a major nation in the sport of athletics, it typically sent a delegation numbering over 100 athletes.\nIt topped the medal table at the 2001 tournament, overtaking the United States following the redistribution of medals due to doping cases. Russia also initially finished top of the medal table at the 2013 Moscow Championships, but lost this position due to doping disqualifications of its athletes. Russia's performance at the competition has been strongly affected by doping. Furthermore, the country's doping problems are distinct because in Russia doping is supplied to the athletes by the government. The country was banned from competing in 2017 due to the state-sponsored doping and Russians had to gain special dispensation to compete as Authorised Neutral Athletes. Various members of the Russian delegation have been banned for doping at every edition of the competition it has competed at, with the exceptions of 2003 and 2015 (though Russian medalists in both those years were subsequently banned).\nRussia's most successful athlete at the competition is horizontal jumps specialist Tatyana Lebedeva, who between 2001 and 2009 won two triple jump gold medals, a long jump title, and two further silver medals. Women's pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva has also won three gold medals, in addition to a bronze. Yuliya Pechonkina, a 400 metres hurdles and relay athlete, has won the most medals for Russia, with her total of seven. The most successful Russian man at the World Championships is high jumper Yaroslav Rybakov, who won three high jump silvers before becoming champion in 2009."

        "text": " \nThe 2018–19 Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team represented the University of Arizona during the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was led by 10th-year head coach Sean Miller and played their home games at McKale Center in Tucson, Arizona as members of the Pac-12 Conference. They finished the season 17–15, 8–10 in Pac-12 play to finish in three-way tie for 6th place. They received the 9-seed in the 2019 Pac-12 tournament, where they lost to 8-seed USC in the first round, 65–78.\nPrevious season.\nEntering the 2017–18 season, federal prosecutors in New York announced charges of fraud and corruption against 10 people involved in college basketball, including Arizona assistant coach Emmanuel \"Book\" Richardson. The charges allege that Richardson and others allegedly received payments from financial advisers and others to influence student-athletes to retain their services and in turn used those payments to secure recruits. Following the news, Richardson was suspended and relieved of all duties. On January 11, 2018, UA fired assistant basketball coach Book Richardson after his appeal failed.\nOn February 23, 2018, according to a published report by ESPN, an FBI wiretap revealed that head coach Sean Miller talked with Christian Dawkins (another key figure in the scandal) to discuss paying their top prospect, Deandre Ayton, $100,000 to commit to Arizona, with the monetary situation being dealt with directly with him. While Miller would not coach their next game that day against Oregon, Arizona allowed Ayton to play. Coach Sean Miller subsequently denied the allegation and the University of Arizona announced he will remain the coach of Arizona Wildcats men’s basketball team, with Ayton also allowed to continue playing with the team for the rest of the season. However, as a consequence of the report involving Ayton, both of Arizona's remaining committed recruits from the class of 2018, Shareef O'Neal and Brandon Williams, announced they had decommitted.\nDuring the season, Arizona defeated Texas A&amp;M in the Valley of the Sun Shootout in Phoenix, AZ. Arizona also defeated the same UMBC team that would go on to a historic upset of top-ranked Virginia in the NCAA tournament. Arizona lost to NC State, SMU and Purdue in the Battle 4 Atlantis in The Bahamas.\nThey finished the season 27–8, 14–4 in Pac-12 play to finish in a first place. The championship marked the school's 16th Pac-12 regular season championship title (back to back, 29th overall). As the No. 1 seed in the Pac-12 tournament, Arizona defeated Colorado, UCLA (avenged from 82–74 loss on February 4 in Tucson, AZ) and USC to win the 2nd straight Pac-12 tournament championship title for the 7th time. As a result, the Wildcats received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive year (35th NCAA tournament appearances). As a No. 4 seed in the South region, in the First round, they lost to No. 13 seed Buffalo 68–89.\nOffseason.\n2018 recruiting class.\nBrandon Williams, originally from Los Angeles, CA was the first commitment in the Arizona class. He committed to Arizona on June 6, 2017, over Gonzaga, Kansas, UCLA and USC. He was a consensus four-star prospect. He backed out of his commitment to Arizona after more information relating to the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal came out (similar to former Arizona commit Shareef O'Neal), but he ultimately decided to stay with Arizona on May 5, 2018.\n2019 recruiting class.\nNico Mannion, originally from Siena, Italy, was originally a part of the 2020 recruiting class, but reclassified to the 2019 class in July 2018. He verbally committed to Arizona on September 14, 2018, over Marquette. Mannion is a consensus five-star prospect out of Pinnacle HS in Phoenix, Arizona.\nChristian Koloko, originally from Doula, Cameroon, was the second commitment in the Arizona class. He committed to Arizona on September 23, 2018, over California, Creighton, and Vanderbilt. He is a consensus three-star prospect out of Sierra Canyon School in Chatsworth, California.\nJosh Green, originally from Sydney, New South Wales, Australia was the third commitment in the Arizona’s 2019 recruiting class. He verbally committed to Arizona on October 4, 2018, over Kansas, North Carolina, Villanova, USC and UNLV. Green is a consensus five-star prospect out of IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.\nZeke Nnaji, originally from Lakeville, MN was the fifth commitment in the Arizona’s 2019 recruiting class. He verbally committed to Arizona on November 23, 2018, over UCLA, North Carolina, Kansas and Purdue. Nnaji is a consensus four-star prospect out of Hopkins High School in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\nPreseason.\nRed and Blue game.\nThe annual Red-Blue game will take place at McKale Center on October 14, 2018. After sophomore Brandon Randolph defended his crown in the dunk contest, the Red team, led by Ira Lee, knocked off the Blue team, 39-33.\nPreseason rankings.\nThe Arizona Wildcats were selected fourth in the 2018-19 Pac-12 media poll. \nOn October 22, Arizona began the season unranked receiving 14 votes in the AP poll. It was the first time since the 2010–11, began the season not in the AP Poll.\nSchedule and results.\nThe Wildcats opponents were finalized in the summer and dates and times will be finalized in the fall. Current confirmed opponents are exhibition games against Division II school Chaminade, Baylor, Cal Poly, Houston Baptist, Montana, Georgia Southern, UC Davis, UTEP and Utah Valley. They will also participate in the 2018 Maui Invitational Tournament with three of the following potential opponents including (Auburn, Duke, Gonzaga, Illinois, Iowa State, San Diego, or Xavier). Arizona has two true away games with Alabama at Coleman Coliseum, and UConn at the XL Center. \nIn the unbalanced 18-game Pac-12 schedule, Arizona will not play the two Washington schools on the road (Washington and Washington State) and two Los Angeles schools at home (UCLA and USC).\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Pac-12 regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Pac-12 Tournament\nSee also.\n2018–19 Arizona Wildcats women's basketball team"

The first tournament took place between May and July 2018, with the final taking place in Nanjing, China. United States won the inaugural edition, defeating Turkey in the final.\nIn July 2018, the FIVB announced that China would host the next three editions of the women's Volleyball Nations League Finals, from 2019–2021‌, but on March 13, 2020, the FIVB decided to postpone the Nations League until after the 2020 Summer Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the FIVB canceled the 2020 edition and confirmed Italy as the host of the final stage of the 2021 VNL.\nIn February 2024, the FIVB announced that the competition will be expand to 18 teams from the 2025 edition onwards while the core and challenge teams' statuses will be abolished with the reformed format.\nThe creation of the tournament was announced in October 2017 (alongside with the announcement of the Challenger Cup) as a joint project between the FIVB, the IMG and 21 national federations. The Nations League replaced the World Grand Prix, a former annual women's international event that ran between 1993 and 2017.\nA corresponding tournament for men's national teams is the FIVB Volleyball Men's Nations League.\nHistory.\nAdoption.\nIn June 2017, Argentinian website Voley Plus reported that the FIVB would drastically change the format for both the 2018 World League and World Grand Prix. According to the reports, starting from 2018, the World League and the World Grand Prix would have only one Group (no more Groups 1, 2 and 3) of 16 national teams.\nIn October 2017, the FIVB announced, via a press release, the creation of the men's and women's Volleyball Nations League, confirming the tournaments as a replacement for the World League and World Grand Prix.\nMarketing.\nThe International Volleyball Federation has partnered with global brand strategy and design firm Landor Associates to create the Volleyball Nations League branding. Landor has also contributed with in-stadium and on-screen television graphics, staff uniforms, designs for the World Volleyball app, medals and the winning trophy.\nDigital.\nMicrosoft, the multinational technology company, has signed an agreement with the FIVB that the international federation vows will change the way the sport of volleyball is consumed while heightening the fan experience during match days as well as in the digital space. Under the tie-up, the 'Microsoft Sports Digital Platform' has been created to create new digital services and deliver personalised content on demand in order to boost the FIVB global audience and improve fan engagement.\nPrize money.\nAccording to the FIVB, the prize money is equal for both the men's and women's VNL as per the FIVB's gender equality policy.\nTeam awards.\nAt the preliminary round, the winning team is awarded US$9,500 for every win and the losing team is awarded US$4,250.\nPrize money allocated to teams based on their final place in the final round:\nFair Play Award:\nAdmissions by athletes before the Challenge is thrown will be evaluated to avoid time wasting, a green card will be awarded in this case. The team with the most green cards will receive a cash prize of $30,000. In case of a tie, the best-ranked team will be awarded.\nIndividual awards.\nThe players selected into Dream Team will receive US$10,000 each while the MVP will be given US$30,000.\nMarket performance.\nThe FIVB announced that the 2019 Volleyball Nations League (both men's and women's) attracted a cumulative global audience of more than 1.5 billion. This number was an increase of 200 million from the 2018 VNL. In total, more than 600,000 tickets were sold in the 2019 VNL.\nFormat.\nPrevious format.\nAs in the former World Grand Prix, the competition will be divided in two phases, albeit with changes in the competition formula: a preliminary round (known as preliminary round), with a system of rotating host cities, and a final round played in a pre-selected host city.\nThe preliminary round is held over five weeks, versus three in the World Grand Prix. Each week, the participating teams are organized in pools, and each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. All games in a pool take place over a weekend in the same city.\nWhen all matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top five teams in the overall standings qualify for the final round, and the remaining ones leave the competition. The host nation automatically qualifies for the final round.\n16 national teams will compete in the inaugural edition of the tournament; 12 core teams, which are always qualified, and 4 challenger teams, which can face relegation.\nThe 16 teams compete in round-robin tournament, with every core team hosting a pool al least once. The teams are divided into 4 pools of 4 teams in each week and compete five weeks long, with a total of 120 matches. The top five teams after the round-robin tournament join the hosts in the final round. The relegation will consider the four challenger teams and the last ranked challenger team will be excluded from next edition. The winners of the Challenger Cup would qualify for next edition as a challenger team.\nThe six qualified teams play in 2 pools of 3 teams in a round-robin format. The top 2 teams of each pool qualify for the semifinals. The first ranked teams play against the second ranked teams in this round. The winners of the semifinals advance to compete for the Nations League title.\nCurrent format.\nThe current format is applied since the 2022 edition. The whole competition still be divided into two phases: The pool phase and the Finals.\nThe 16 teams will be divided into 2 groups of eight. Each team will play with 12 matches during the three weeks of the preliminary round. Two pools of eight teams will compete in four matches of six days of competition (Tuesday – Sunday). The new competition format allows for a one-week gap between events. The total number of matches in the pool phase will be 96.\nThe Finals will see the eight strongest teams moving directly to the knockout phase which will consist of eight matches in total: four quarterfinals, two semi-finals and the bronze and gold medal matches. The total number of matches in the final phase will be 8.\nReform from 2025.\nThe VNL will expand to 18 teams from 2025 alongside format changes that will elevate the VNL experience for athletes, fans, and all stakeholders. To facilitate the reform, there will be no relegation for the 2024 participating teams, while the winner of the 2024 Volleyball Challenger Cup, plus the top ranked not-yet-qualified team as per the senior Volleyball World Ranking, will join the participating teams of the 2025 VNL. \nAs of the 2025 edition, the core team status shall be abolished with the last team in the competition's final standing relegated, and the top team not yet qualified as per the Senior Volleyball World Ranking promoted into the following edition of the VNL.\nChallenger Cup.\nThe FIVB Volleyball Challenger Cup will be a competition for national teams which will run in concurrence with the Volleyball Nations League. The Challenger Cup will consist of teams not participating in the current edition of the Volleyball Nations League and will feature one host team and five teams from the five continental confederations as follows:\nThe Continental Confederations, responsible for determining the teams that will qualify for the FIVB Challenger Cup, are free to organise their Continental Qualification Tournament or use an existing competition to define the qualified team(s).\nThe FIVB Challenger Cup is held before the FIVB Volleyball Nations League Finals (in 2018 and 2019 editions) but changed it in 2022 edition and the winners will qualify for the next year's VNL as a challenger team.\nNew VNL qualification system.\nThe lowest ranked Challenger team of the current edition of the VNL will play the Volleyball Challenger Cup (VCC) held after the VNL.

        "title": "Betting on horse racing",
        "text": " \nBetting on horse racing or horse betting commonly occurs at many horse races. Modern horse betting started in Great Britain in the early 1600s during the reign of King James I. Gamblers can stake money on the final placement of the horses taking part in a race. Gambling on horses is, however, prohibited at some racetracks. For example, because of a law passed in 1951, betting is illegal in Springdale Race Course, home of the nationally renowned Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank) Carolina Cup and Colonial Cup Steeplechase in Camden, South Carolina.\nWhere gambling is allowed, most tracks offer parimutuel betting where gamblers' money is pooled and shared proportionally among the winners once a deduction has been made from the pool. Parimutuel betting also provides purse money to participants and a considerable amount of tax revenue, with over $100 billion being wagered annually in 53 countries.\nIn some countries – notably the UK, Ireland, and Australia – an alternative and more popular facility is provided by bookmakers who effectively make a market in odds. This allows the gambler to 'lock in' odds on a horse at a particular time (known as 'taking the price' in the UK).\nTypes of bets.\nIn North American racing, the three most common ways to bet money are to \"win\", to \"place\", and to \"show\". A bet to \"win\", sometimes called a \"straight\" bet, means staking money on the horse, and if it comes in first place, the bet is a winner. In a bet to \"place\", you are betting on your horse to finish either first or second. A bet to \"show\" wins if the horse finishes first, second or third. Since it is much easier to select a horse to finish first, second, or third than it is to select a horse just for first, the show payoffs will be much lower on average than win payoffs. If there are a small number of horses in the race, \"show\" or \"place\" bets may not be offered (or if bets have already been made, they are cancelled and the wagered amounts refunded).\nIn Europe, Australia, and Asia, betting to \"place\" is different since the number of \"payout places\" varies depending on the size of the field that takes part in the race. For example, in a race with seven or less runners in the UK, only the first two finishers would be considered winning bets with most bookmakers. Three places are paid for eight or more runners, whilst a handicap race with 16 runners or more will see the first four places being classed as \"placed\". (A \"show\" bet in the North American sense does not exist in these locations.)\nThe term \"each-way\" (E/W) bet is used everywhere but North America, and has a different meaning depending on the location. An \"each-way\" bet sees the total bet being split in two, with half being placed on the win, and half on the place. Bettors receive a payout if the horse either wins, and/or is placed based on the place criteria as stated above. The full odds are paid if the horse wins, (plus the place portion), with a quarter or a fifth of the odds (depending on the race-type and the number of runners) if only the place section of the bet is successful. In the UK some bookmakers will pay for the first five (some independent firms have even paid the first six) for a place on the Grand National. This additional concession is offered because of the large number of runners in the race (maximum 40). Occasionally other handicap races with large fields (numbers of runners) receive the same treatment from various bookmakers, especially if they are sponsoring the race.\nThe rough equivalent of the \"each-way\" in North America is the \"across the board\" (\"win/place/show\") or \"win/place\" bet, where equal bets on a horse are made to \"win\", \"place\", and \"show\" (or just \"win\" and \"place\"). Each portion is treated by the totalizator as a separate bet, so an \"across-the-board\" bet is merely a convenience for bettors and parimutuel clerks. For instance, if a $2 across-the-board bet (total outlay of $6) were staked on a horse which finished second, paying $4.20 to place and $3.00 to show, the bettor would receive $7.20 on what is essentially a $6 wager.\nIn addition to straight wagers, \"exotic\" wagers offer bettors an opportunity to incorporate the placement of different horses in one or multiple races. The two broad types of exotic wagers are horizontal and vertical. Horizontal exotic wagers are bets on multiple horses in one particular race, while vertical exotic wagers involve predicting results across multiple races. Both have specific options for which bets are available and are detailed below.\nIn the most basic horizontal wager, an \"exacta\", the bettor selects the first and second place horses in the exact order. Picking the first three finishers in exact order is called a \"trifecta\" and a \"superfecta\" refers to the specific finishing order of the top four horses.\nBoxing is a tactic that increases the odds of winning an exotic wager by removing the need to choose the exact order. A \"quinella\", which boxes an \"exacta\" (allowing the first two finishers to come in any order and still win), is the basic box, but boxing can be applied to the \"trifecta\" and \"superfecta\" as well.\nA \"wheel\" is a bet on a single horse is to finish in a specific position, with multiple horses finishing ahead and/or behind it. In a sense, a win bet can be thought of as a specific type of \"wheel\" bet.\nVertical bets are spread over different races. A \"daily double\" is an exotic wager placed on the winner of two consecutive races. Picking the winner of three, four, five or six straight races is referred to as a \"pick-3\", \"pick-4\", \"pick-5\" and \"pick-6\" respectively.\nBetting exchanges.\nIn addition to traditional betting with a bookmaker, punters (bettors) are able to both back and lay money on an online betting exchange. Punters who lay the odds are in effect acting as a bookmaker. The odds of a horse are set by the market conditions of the betting exchange which is dictated to by the activity of the members.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the states with the largest pools are California, New York, Kentucky, Florida, Maryland and Illinois in no particular order.\nBetting on horse racing in the United States varies from state to state. By the late 19th century over 300 tracks were in operation in the country but those opposed to gambling caused the banning of bookmakers and horse racing at the beginning of the next century. In 1908 pari-mutuel (tote) betting was introduced, helping the industry to prosper and that has continued to be the case to the present day. Pari-mutuel betting is currently legal in 32 US states. Due to new legislation horse race betting in the US could change significantly in the near future. The legal market handle on horse racing in the United States in 2018 was $11.26 billion while experts predict the illegal sports betting market could be anywhere from $100 billion to $150 billion annually.\nKentucky Derby.\nRun on the first Saturday in May the most famous horse race in the United States, the Kentucky Derby, takes place at Churchill Downs and is known as ‘The Run For The Roses.’ The one mile two furlong contest dates back to 1875. $149.9 million was wagered on the race in 2019, beating the previous record amount of $139.2 set 12 months earlier. $24.6 million of that total was gambled online.\nHong Kong.\nHong Kong generates the largest horse racing revenue in the world and is home to some of the largest horse betting circles including the Hong Kong Jockey Club founded in 1884. In 2009, Hong Kong generated an average US$12.7 million in gambling turnover per race 6 times larger than its closest rival France at US$2 million while the United States only generated $250,000. Betting on horse racing is ingrained in local culture and is seen as an investment.\nDuring the 2014-2015 racing season the Hong Kong Jockey Club gained per race about HK$138.8 million (US$17.86 million), which is more than any other track worldwide. The revenue the club generate from various wagers makes it the largest taxpayer for the government. Hong Kong Jockey Club broke its own record during the 2016-2017 season with a turnover of HK$216.5 billion and paid the government HK$21.7 billion in duty and profits tax, an all-time high.\nAustralia.\nA government survey in 2015 found that nearly one million Australians (5.6% of Australian adults) gambled on dog or horse racing in Australia. Most were men aged between 30 and 64 who had a typical yearly expenditure of $1,300 on race betting. Nationally, typical annual race-betting expenditure amounted to roughly $1.27 billion.\nHorse race betting in New South Wales (NSW) is conducted by bookmakers (at race meetings and via telephone) and Tabcorp (tote betting at racecourses and through various retail outlets including the internet). In 2014 it was estimated that $300 million alone was bet on Australia’s most famous race - the Melbourne Cup.\nUnited Kingdom.\nHorse race betting is wide and varied in the UK. Unlike most other countries, the pari-mutual market in the UK is small compared to fixed odds wagering, accounting for only about 5% of the total betting turnover. Between April 2017 and March 2018, off-course horse racing betting turnover in Great Britain amounted to £4.3 billion. The majority of the money wagered on horse racing in the UK is with bookmakers, either in betting shops or online. In 2018, there were 8,500 betting shops in Great Britain. This figure is expected to decrease significantly in 2019 when government restrictions on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBT’s) comes into force."

The format for the qualifying stage was based on the Pots System, developed by Chilean Leandro Shara. Under that format, the teams are divided into pots for scheduling purposes only, and all teams face rivals from each pot, and all teams are placed under one general standing (without groups). Subsequently, the 34 teams were divided into four pots, and each team played four matches, two home and two away. Based on their results in the general standing, the teams were divided into tiers for the group phase of the inaugural edition of the CONCACAF Nations League:\nMoreover, the top ten teams qualified for the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup to join the six hexagonal participants.\nTiebreakers.\nThe ranking of teams in qualifying was determined as follows:\nSeeding.\nThe 34 teams were seeded into four pots based on their position in the March 2018 CONCACAF Ranking Index (shown in parentheses).

A computerized pre-draw produced a \"master schedule\", creating 17 fixtures for each matchday. The teams in each pot were then drawn to the corresponding positions in the schedule (A1–A8, B1–B9, C1–C9, D1–D8). The computer model assured that no teams face each other more than once, and that each team plays two home and two away matches.\nThe result of the draw was as follows:\nSummary.\n!colspan=3|Matchday 1\n!colspan=3|Matchday 2\n!colspan=3|Matchday 3\n!colspan=3|Matchday 4\nMatches.\nThe match dates were announced on 29 May 2018, with the venues announced in August and September 2018.

First discovered on the slopes of Mount Nimba, it is now believed that the species is extant within Guinea, Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire.\nDescription.\nThe Lachaise's climbing mouse measures between 5.5 and 7.7 centimetres in body length, with a tail length of between 7.9 and 9.8 centimetres. The upper section of the body is light brown, while the chest and stomach are whitish in colour. The species are distinguished from close relatives through the absence of a black stripe on the back, a lack of white spot on the muzzle, the presence of an additional toe, and cranial differences.\nDistribution and habitat.\nSpecimens caught to date have been located within the boundaries of the Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve, which overlaps the borders of Guinea, Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire. The mouse tends to frequent montane savannah plains, lowland and montane tropical forest and cultivated banana and quinine plantations.\nThreats.\nThe species may be under direct threat from mining activity and human movement. Due to the location in regard to the border of Guinea, Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire, the locality is prone to extensive refugee movement. The area is additionally mined on the basis of iron ore concessions, posing a threat to the habitat of the mouse. These prevalent risks have relatively recently seen the area added to the List of World Heritage in Danger. The former countries place protections upon the reserve, but the status of conservation regarding Cote d’Ivoire remains unknown."

        "title": "1939–40 Northern Rugby Football League Wartime Emergency League season",
        "text": "The 1939–40 Northern Rugby Football League season was an emergency season of English rugby league fixtures necessitated by the outbreak of the Second World War. The regular league season had started at the end of August 1939, but on the outbreak of war all sport was suspended. When government permission for sport to be resumed was given, the league was reorganised into two regional competitions, Yorkshire and Lancashire. The winners of each league playing against each other to decide the overall champions. The Yorkshire competition was won by Bradford Northern who beat Swinton, winners of the Lancashire competition, in the two-legged league final.\nThe season also saw the resumption of County Cup competition, as well as some representative matches arranged to raise funds for the British Red Cross. The Challenge Cup competition, traditionally run alongside the league, was not played for the first time since 1919.\nPlanned season.\nThe planned 1939–40 season had begun as scheduled on Saturday 26 August 1939 with 27 clubs starting the season. This was one less than the previous season as St Helens Recs had disbanded at the end of the 1938–39 season. The withdrawal of St Helens Recs required a change in the way fixtures were organised. With 28 clubs in the league, each club was a member of the 14 team Lancashire League or the 14 team Yorkshire League. The actual geographical split of clubs was 15 clubs based in Yorkshire and 13 in Lancashire, so Halifax played as a member of the Lancashire League. Each teams' fixture list comprised a home and away fixture against all the teams in their county league (26), as well as home and away fixtures against seven teams in the other county league (14) for a total of 40 games.\nWith only 27 clubs the League's secretary, John Wilson, proposed a 36-game season for each club with Halifax remaining in the Lancashire league, and Dewsbury, who were the lowest finishing Yorkshire team in the previous season, playing as a member of neither county league. For the purposes of determining fixture lists Dewsbury would be considered the 14th team of both county leagues. Excepting Dewsbury, each team's fixture list would comprise the other teams in their own county league (24 games) together with six teams from the other county (12 games). Dewsbury's opponents would be nine clubs from each county.\nAt the League's annual general meeting on 7 June 1939 the clubs accepted Wilson's proposal regarding the positions of Halifax and Dewsbury, but voted for a 40-game fixture list instead of Wilson's 36 game proposal. The fixture lists were issued later in June. Each team, except Dewsbury, had home and away fixtures against all the teams in their own county league (24 games). They also had home and away fixtures against eight teams in the other county league (16 games). Dewsbury's fixture list comprised home and away fixtures against 10 teams from each county league.\nA full programme of games was played up to Saturday 2 September. By that date most clubs had played two or three games as some clubs had played midweek matches.\nSuspension of the League.\nOn Monday 4 September the day after the declaration of war, all rugby league games and all other spectator sports and public entertainments were suspended by provisions of the Prohibition of Public Entertainments (Defence) Order, one of numerous orders made following the enactment of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939. As a result, some clubs like Wigan and Salford announced they were closing for the duration of the war and that their players were released.\nOne issue clubs had to consider was what to do with the monies paid for season-tickets, the holders of which may have only seen one or two games. Barrow, for one, resolved to repay season-ticket holders less a deduction for games seen, while Oldham decided not to give any refunds stating, \"We are up against it and must appeal to our members to make this sacrifice\".\nUnder the defence regulations and air raid precautions, all areas of the country were designated as evacuation, neutral or reception areas depending on the assessment of an area as an enemy target and its ability to receive people from the evacuation areas. The defence regulations allowed for the resumption of sporting events within reception or neutral areas and on 9 September the Home Secretary issued the Public Entertainments (Restriction) Order allowing events to go ahead outside evacuation areas. Attendances were limited to 8,000 or 15,000 at grounds with a capacity over 60,000.\nOn 11 September the Rugby League Council agreed to clubs playing friendlies on the following two Saturdays, while the League Secretary, John Wilson, arranged a programme of games. Players were to be paid 10s per match and their travelling expenses, while the minimum entrance fee was set at 6d. The meeting also appointed a wartime committee to run the league for the duration of the war.\nSeven games were played on 16 September and eleven on 23 September. A further change in the defence orders allowed games to go ahead in evacuation areas as long as the consent of the local chief constable had been obtained.\nCounty competitions.\nWilson's proposal, which was accepted on 11 September, was for the league to run as two parallel county competitions, a Yorkshire Competition and a Lancashire Competition under the umbrella name of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Emergency Period League. The leagues would be played on a simple home and away basis; gate money was to be split equally between the two clubs after deducting player expenses and travel expenses for 15 players of the away club. Players' expenses were limited to 10s per game plus meal expenses if they had to travel more than to an away game. These allowances replaced any previous contractual arrangements between the players and the clubs and in effect removed the professional status from the players. Referees were to be allowed 10s plus travel expenses and touch judges 5s plus travel expenses. Players were also allowed to play for another club if that club was closer to home or work, subject to agreement of their first club. This was to alleviate travelling for players who worked away.\nNo inter-competition games were planned, but in January 1940 it was proposed and agreed that there should be a two-legged final between the winner of each competition to decide the overall league champions. Clubs were asked to notify Wilson as soon as possible if they intended to play in the competitions. In the end all 27 clubs, including those like Salford and Wigan who had previously decided to cease operating, had entered when the fixture list was issued.\nThe rules also allowed alternative venues to be used if a club's home ground was unavailable, either temporarily or permanently. Broughton Rangers home ground, Belle Vue was unavailable to them all season so they played at a variety of other grounds, while Salford and Swinton shared Swinton's Station Road.\nPlayer protest.\nEven before the season started players at Bradford Northern, Halifax and Huddersfield protested that the expense limit of 10s per game was insufficient and that they would not play unless the expenses were increased. The Lord Mayor of Bradford, T. J. Robinson had anticipated the players' stance. At a lunch for the wartime committee, he was reported as saying \"the committee members would have difficulty in getting first-class footballers, used to getting £4 or £5 to accept remuneration of 10s per match, but no doubt the difficulties would be surmounted\". The players most opposed to the expense limit were those of Bradford Northern who were unanimous in their opposition and had made it clear to the club secretary that they were not prepared to play for 10s per game. The secretary had informed Wilson of this asking for a special meeting of the clubs to discuss the issue. At this stage Wilson did not consider discussion appropriate unless 20 or more of the clubs requested it. The Huddersfield players also informed their club committee that they were not prepared to play on the following Saturday. At Halifax the secretary stated reports of a strike were exaggerated and that the \"players were quite willing, indeed they were anxious to play but they were not prepared to run the risk of losing the jobs they had got, or of being off work, for the small amount they were permitted to receive\".\nThe chairman of the Rugby League Council, G.F. Hutchins, responded by asking all players to give the 10s expenses a month's trial after which the issue would be reviewed. While players at St. Helens accepted the 10s limit, at Barrow team selection for Saturday was delayed because of the issue; while some clubs, including Halifax, Dewsbury and Batley, called for an increase in the limit.\nOn Friday 29 September the Halifax players agreed to play but remained dissatisfied by the expense allowance; the Bradford players remained adamant leaving the club no alternative but to inform their opponents for Saturday, Hull Kingston Rovers that the game could not go ahead. Players from many clubs met on 2 October and agreed to continue to press the issue with the Rugby Football League, but they would play \"on Saturday in order to keep faith with the public\". After the second weekend of the competitions, the Rugby League Council met to discuss the expenses issue and agreed a doubling of the expenses limit to £1. Expenses for referees were also increased to £1, but touch judges' expenses remained unchanged at 5s. Also, clubs could make an additional payment of 5s to each player for away games played in Barrow or Hull due to the extra travelling time needed. To increase the likelihood that gates would be adequate, the minimum entry for a game was increased to 1s but remained at 6d for women, children and any uniformed members of the armed forces. The players responded by welcoming the rise but asked the Rugby League Council to consider changing the system to a payment of 25s to players on the winning team and 15s to the members of the losing team. The players felt this would increase competitiveness in the games. The wartime committee met the following week but made no response to the player's suggestion. Bonuses were not discussed further except at the end of the season when the league awarded monetary prizes rather than medals.\nYorkshire competition.\nWith 15 teams the fixture list for the Yorkshire competition contained 28 fixtures for each team with the season end date being 11 May. Until Christmas 1939 the competition progressed as planned although at least one game was concluded early; Hull v Batley on 21 October was ended after 65 minutes due to an air raid warning. The last week of December 1939 was the start of the third coldest winter of the 20th century and the most severe in the United Kingdom since 1895. Heavy snow and prolonged cold periods, together with the lack of material to protect the pitches, meant that after the games played on Boxing Day 1939 no games were played in Yorkshire until 24 February when a single match, Hull F.C. v Leeds beat the weather; it was the following Saturday, 2 March 1940, before a full schedule resumed. A backlog of over 100 games built up and it became apparent that it would be impossible to complete the fixtures by the end of April without many midweek games being played. The decision was taken to extend the season. The clubs were urged to complete their fixtures by 4 May, but as the backlog grew the date was moved to 11 May with the Championship final scheduled for 18 and 25 May. The extension required a ballot of all the clubs as the games' by-laws specified that they could not be played between the second Saturday in May and the last Saturday in August. Despite all the urging, the games did not finish on time. By 31 May there were still three fixtures outstanding. Hull F.C. had away fixtures against Batley and Keighley to play, and Hull Kingston Rovers were still to play Dewsbury at home. These games never were played as Hull F.C. reported in July that their two fixtures were unplayed and both Keighley and Batley had withdrawn from the Yorkshire Cup ending their seasons in May due to problems raising teams. With two points awarded for a win, the non-playing of these three games had no bearing on the outcome of the competition. Bradford secured the title with a game to spare when they beat Hull Kingston Rovers on 13 May giving them a three-point lead over Huddersfield, and a six-point lead over Hull F.C.\nLancashire competition.\nThe 12 teams of the Lancashire competition each had 22 fixtures to play. A season end date of 2 March was given when the fixture list was issued. Like the Yorkshire competition, the Lancashire competition progressed well until the end of 1939 but was hit badly by the hard winter. The absence of games was not as long as the barren spell experienced in Yorkshire; in the first two weeks of January 1940 three games were played all in the Lancashire competition. After that it was the last weekend in February before any more games were played. Catching up on the outstanding fixtures required some games to be scheduled close to each other. Oldham and Warrington rescheduled the two games between the clubs. Both were played over the Easter weekend, Oldham at home on Saturday and Warrington at home on Monday.\nWith a smaller backlog of games and fewer fixtures to be played, by the end of May there was only one fixture left to be played—Oldham v Rochdale. The game had previously been postponed twice at the request of Rochdale who then proposed the fixture be played on 1 June. However Oldham had already arranged a friendly against Huddersfield for the same day which they did not wish to postpone and instead proposed 8 June. Rochdale objected as they considered the outstanding league fixture should take precedence over a friendly. When Oldham refused, Rochdale wrote to the league and Oldham, stating that Rochdale did not intend to fulfil the fixture. The games' points were awarded to Oldham.\nThe title was won by Swinton on points difference ahead of Salford.\nChampionship play-off.\nThe Championship was decided by a two leg play-off between Swinton and Bradford Northern on a home and away basis. Bradford Northern won 37–22 on aggregate having won both legs.\nFirst leg.\nThe first leg was played at Swinton's Station Rd on 18 May 1940 in front of a crowd of 4,800. Gate receipts totalled £237.\nSwinton took a 3–0 lead when Hopkin scored a try. But within minutes Bradford took the lead as Harrison scored a try which Carmichael converted to put Bradford 5–3 ahead. Swinton regained the lead through a McGurk try, converted by Hodgson, cancelled out by Bradford's second try by Smith which Carmichael again converted. This gave Bradford a half-time lead 10–8.\nIn the second half it was Bradford who scored first with a Whitcombe try to which Carmichael added the conversion to make the score 15–8. Swinton reduced the gap to two points as Shaw scored with Hodgson converting. Bradford's fourth try came from a Swinton penalty kick that hit the post and rebounded into the field of play. It was gathered up by Bradford's Davies who ran the length of the pitch to score. A fifth try for Bradford, scored by Brogden, made the final score 21–13 to Bradford.\nSecond leg.\nThe second leg was played the following Saturday, 25 May 1940 at Odsal Stadium. The crowd was 11,271 generating gate receipts of £570.\nBradford made a number of changes for the first leg due to injuries and players unable to get time off work. Bradford scored first with a Ward try to which Swinton replied with a Hodgson drop goal. This was Swinton's only score of the first half. Bradford scored two more tries through Winnard and Whitcombe, one of which Carmichael converted to give Bradford an 11–2 lead at half-time.\nSwinton got a try back in the second half, but another try by Winnard and a Carmichael conversion extended Bradford's lead to 16–5. Two Hodgson penalties, the second of which was kicked from very close to the halfway line making the kick approximately from the goal posts, improved Swinton's score. Shortly before the end Jenkins (Bradford) and Bowyer (Swinton) were sent off for fighting. As Swinton had already lost Hopkin to injury they finished the game with only 11 players on the field as the game ended 16–9 to Bradford.\nCup competitions.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe Challenge Cup was suspended at the start of the war at the same time as all competitive games and it did not feature in the Rugby League's proposals for competitive football. As late as December 1939 the Lancashire County Committee were considering a proposal to reinstate the competition but the practicalities of scheduling and travel during wartime were considered too great to overcome.\nLancashire Cup.\nAlthough all cup competitions had been suspended at the outbreak of the war, as the season progressed there were calls for the County Cup competitions to be re-introduced. In December 1939 the wartime committee gave permission for the Lancashire Cup to be played. All ties including the final were to be two-legged with the winner being decided by aggregate score. With only 12 clubs participating only four rounds of competition were needed and these were scheduled for March and April 1940. After the first round the six winning clubs were drawn for the second round with two teams being given byes into the semi-finals. The two teams given byes were Swinton and Widnes who went on to win their semi-final matches.\nThe winners of the cup were Swinton who won the first leg of the final 5–4 at Widnes' Naughton Park ground on 20 April. In the second leg at Station Road, at full time the score was 9–8 to Widnes making the aggregate score 13–13. Under the competition rules extra time had to be played and Swinton won 16–11 to win the Cup 21–15 on aggregate.\nYorkshire Cup.\nEncouraged by the resumption of the Lancashire Cup, in December 1939 the Yorkshire clubs considered whether to reinstate the Yorkshire Cup but agreed to defer any decision until February 1940. At the club's February meeting it was agreed to ask the war-time committee for permission to play the competition on four consecutive Saturdays in May and June after the completion of the league season. As the request was made at the same time the league fixture backlog was increasing, the war-time committee arranged a postal ballot of all the clubs to amend the by-laws to allow games to be played in June; the vote to extend the season was carried 21–3 with 8 clubs not replying. A secondary proposal to pay match bonuses to players for cup games after the first round was rejected after a ballot of the clubs.\nUnlike the Lancashire Cup, the Yorkshire Cup was to be a straightforward knockout competition. It was agreed that the first round fixtures would be those that had been drawn in May 1939 in anticipation of the Cup being at its regular dates in the season. The draw gave Huddersfield a bye; they would join the winners of the seven ties in the draw for the second round. Shortly before the first round ties were played on 1 June 1940, Batley, Bramley and Keighley all withdrew from the competition because they could not raise teams due to war work commitments or active service. The three ties were all awarded to their opponents.\nThe final was contested by Featherstone Rovers and Wakefield Trinity at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on 22 June 1940. Featherstone won 12–9 to win the Cup for the first time.\nLancashire Summer Competition.\nIn April 1940 eight of the Lancashire clubs agreed to play in a new league called the Lancashire Summer Competition. The teams were split into two groups of four with the two group leaders meeting in a single-legged play-off final on 22 June. The two groups, titled East and West comprised Barrow, Liverpool Stanley, Warrington and Wigan in the East group with Broughton Rangers, Leigh, Salford and Swinton in the West group. Players from the four teams who had decided not to enter were not allowed to play as guests in the competition. The games were to be played as a two-legged knockout tournament in the same manner as the Lancashire Cup.\nFixtures began on 11 May with Broughton Rangers playing Leigh, but within two weeks Barrow and Swinton withdrew from the competition. With only six teams left in the competition, the league committee decided to abandon the competition at the end of May.\nRepresentative matches.\nIn October 1939 the league resolved to play three representative matches to raise funds for the Red Cross; England v Wales on 23 December 1939, Lancashire v Yorkshire at Barrow on 1 January 1940, and the 1936 Tourists v the Rest on 10 February 1940 at a venue to be confirmed.\nThe first game, England v Wales, was played at Odsal, Bradford on 23 December 1939. A crowd of 20,000 saw Wales win 16–3. The second game was scheduled for 1 January 1940 and was a match between representative teams of the Lancashire and Yorkshire clubs. It was postponed in December 1939 at the request of the Barrow club as the Barrow shipyards were not taking New Years Day, a Monday, as a holiday. Eventually played at Craven Park on 23 March before a crowd of 8,683, Yorkshire beat Lancashire 13–10 having been 2–10 behind at half-time.\nThe third game, postponed from 10 February, was played at Salford on 4 May between the 1936 Tourists (players from the 1936 team that toured Australia) and the 1940 Probables (players who probably would have toured Australia in 1940 had the war not intervened). Last minute changes in availability meant that the Tourists side included three Salford players who had not been part of the tour team. The 1940 Probables won the game 29–21 in front of a crowd of 7,000.\nIn total the three games generated £1,561 for the British Red Cross.\nFinances.\nThe season was costly both to the Rugby Football League and to many clubs. The Rugby Football League had income of only £899 in the year to 31 May 1940 and lost £3,015, reducing its assets to £23,304. This compared to a loss of £1,710 in the previous year. The two County Leagues had mixed fortunes. Lancashire made a profit of £63 while Yorkshire made a loss of £121.\nAt club level many clubs reported losses, these ranged from £47 at Batley and £87 at Rochdale to £998 at Castleford and £1,314 at Wigan. A minority of clubs reported making a profit; St Helens £5 Oldham £114, Swinton £515 and Dewsbury £750, but these club were far fewer in number than the clubs reporting losses."

        "text": "The 2018–19 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team represented the University of Virginia during the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was led by head coach Tony Bennett in his tenth year, and played their home games at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Virginia as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nUVA opened the season with consecutive wins over ranked Big Ten teams, No. 25 Wisconsin (Battle 4 Atlantis) and No. 24 Maryland (ACC–Big Ten Challenge), the latter of which improved Bennett's record in the Challenge to 8–2. An unheralded two-star recruit, 5'9\" Kihei Clark from Los Angeles, California, started both games as a true freshman. The team then started the season 16–0 before falling to No. 1 Duke, 72–70. The game was just the fourth in college basketball history between two teams both ranked No. 1, as the No. 4 Cavaliers were voted atop the Coaches Poll before the loss. After a 16–2 ACC record, Virginia won a share of their fourth ACC regular season title in the past six years.\nIn the ACC tournament, the Cavaliers defeated NC State 76–56, before falling to Florida State in the conference semifinals. Virginia was then awarded the No. 1 seed in the South region and dispatched Gardner-Webb and Oklahoma by healthy margins in the first two rounds in Columbia, South Carolina. They advanced to a Sweet 16 matchup with Oregon and beat Oregon 53–49 to advance to their 2nd Elite 8 under Bennett. In the Elite Eight, they beat Purdue 80–75 in overtime to secure a trip to their first Final Four since 1984. On April 6, 2019, they defeated Auburn in their Final Four matchup by a score of 63–62 on 3 last-second free throws by Kyle Guy, cementing the program's first ever trip to the national championship game. On April 8, 2019, Virginia beat Texas Tech 85–77 in overtime, winning its first national championship.\nPrevious season.\nUnranked by the AP in the preseason poll, the Cavaliers surprisingly finished the 2017–18 season 31–3, and 17–1 in ACC play to win both ACC Regular Season and tournament titles. The Cavaliers received an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 1 seed in the South region, where they were upset by No. 16 UMBC in the first round. This was the first time in Men's NCAA tournament history that a No. 1 seed was upset by a No. 16 seed.\nOffseason.\nVirginia's offseason started on the night of March 16, 2018, and ended on the evening of November 6, 2018.\nThe Cavaliers lost five players and gained four.\nSchedule and results.\nSource:\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"| ACC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"| ACC tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "2018–19 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2018–19 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team represented Indiana University in the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Their head coach was Archie Miller, his second year as Indiana head coach. The team played its home games at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, as a member of the Big Ten Conference. The season officially kicked off with its annual event, Hoosier Hysteria, on September 29, 2018.\nDespite getting off to a strong start of 12–2, which included 3 conference wins, IU struggled mightily down the backstretch of the season. Riddled with injuries and the inability to shoot, the Hoosiers lost 12 of 13 games before turning things around and finishing the regular season with a 4-game winning streak. Having put themselves back into the conversation for making the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 3 years, the Hoosiers looked to knock off Ohio State in the Big Ten tournament. With a win, many bracketologists had IU safely in the field. However, the Hoosiers fell short and lost to Ohio State, 75–79. IU was deemed one of the Last Four Out in the NCAA Tournament, so they earned 1-seed in the NIT, where they advanced to the Quarterfinals before losing to Wichita State, 63–73. Thus, the Hoosiers 119th season ended with an overall record of 19–16 and 8–12 in the Big Ten.\nPrevious season.\nMiller's first season was a major remodeling job, starting with laying the foundation of a pack-line defense and valuing possessions. Early in the season, Miller stated practices were 75% defense, 25% offense. That scheme showed early and often, as the Hoosiers struggled mightily throughout the season to find any flow or rhythm on offense, despite the defense making leaps and bounds in the overall rankings of Division 1 basketball. With a surprising early second round loss in the 2018 Big Ten tournament to Rutgers, 67–76, and losing enough games to keep them out of both the NCAA tournament and NIT, including games in which they were favored, such as Indiana State and Fort Wayne, IU's first season under their new coach came to a disappointing close. They finished with an overall record of 16–15 and 9–9 in the Big Ten.\nOffseason.\nDepartures.\nOn April 12, 2018, junior forward Juwan Morgan announced he was entering the NBA draft, but he would not sign with an agent. However, on May 29, 2018, it was revealed that he had withdrawn from the draft and would return for his senior season.\nRecruiting class.\nWith the commitment of Romeo Langford on April 30, 2018, not only did Archie Miller recruit his first 5-star player, he also landed IU's first Indiana Mr. Basketball since Cody Zeller in 2011. In addition, he also signed two other finalists for the award in Rob Phinisee and Damezi Anderson. Miller rounded out the incoming class with the second best player from Ohio in Jerome Hunter, as well as another 4-star in Jake Forrester from Pennsylvania; this group of high school seniors comprised a Top 10 2018 recruiting class. Within the state of Indiana, there was a total of four 5- and 4-star 2018 recruits, 3 of whom committed to Indiana. The last addition to the team roster was made on May 3, 2018, when graduate transfer Evan Fitzner of Saint Mary's College claimed the final scholarship available.\nSchedule and results.\nThe 2018–19 season will mark the first time in Big Ten history that the teams will play a 20-game conference schedule. The new schedule will also include a regional component to increase the frequency of games among teams in similar areas. Over the course of a six-year cycle (12 playing opportunities), in-state rivals will play each other 12 times, regional opponents will play 10 times, and all other teams will play nine times. Three in-state series that will be guaranteed home-and-homes: Illinois and Northwestern, Indiana and Purdue, and Michigan and Michigan State will always play twice. \n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=| Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NIT"

        "text": "Grant Dean Williams (born November 30, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Williams played college basketball for the Tennessee Volunteers. He was drafted 22nd overall in the 2019 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics and reached the NBA Finals with the team in 2022.\nWilliams was elected as the First Vice President of the National Basketball Players Association in February 2023, replacing Andre Iguodala in the role.\nEarly life and high school career.\nBorn in Houston, Texas, Williams moved to Charlotte, North Carolina as a child. He attended Providence Day School in Charlotte, where he was teammates with future and fellow NBA player Devon Dotson. As a junior in 2014–15, he averaged 18 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game while leading the Chargers to a 25–5 overall record. As a senior, Williams averaged 15.8 points, 10.1 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.0 blocks per game.\nRated a three-star recruit in the class of 2016, Williams committed to Tennessee on November 13, 2015.\nCollege career.\nWilliams was an All-Southeastern Conference player as a freshman, sophomore and junior for the Tennessee Volunteers. He was awarded back-to-back SEC Player of the Year honors for the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, becoming the first player to do so since Corliss Williamson in 1995. Williams led Tennessee as a third seed in the 2018 NCAA tournament and second seed in the 2019 NCAA tournament.\nProfessional career.\nBoston Celtics (2019–2023).\nWilliams was selected with the 22nd overall draft pick by the Boston Celtics in the 2019 NBA draft. On July 11, 2019, the Celtics announced that they had signed him to a four-year, $11.8 million rookie-scale contract. On October 23, 2019, Williams made his professional debut, coming off the bench in a loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. On December 4, 2019, he made his first career start in a winning effort against the Miami Heat. In an effort to garner support for teammates making the 2020 NBA All-Star Game, Williams pledged to dye his hair pink if Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker all received a selection. However, Williams did not do so as Brown did not make the team. Williams finished his rookie season averaging just over 15 minutes per game in 69 games, 3.4 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.\nUpon completion of the 2020–21 NBA season, Williams' second season in the league, he slightly increased his averages in all major statistical categories. He finished the season averaging just over 18 minutes per game, 4.7 points per game and 2.8 rebounds per game.\nOn March 21, 2022, Williams scored a then career-high 20 points in a win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. He finished the 2021–22 NBA season with career-best averages with over 24 minutes per game, 7.8 points per game and 3.6 rebounds per game. On May 15, Williams scored a career-high 27 points in a decisive game 7 win over the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. His performance was highlighted by a 7-for-18 mark from three point range, records for both made threes and three attempts in an NBA game 7. Williams helped the Celtics reach the NBA Finals, but lost to the Golden State Warriors in 6 games.\nOn October 26, 2022, Williams was suspended for one game without pay for making contact with a game official during a 102–120 loss to the Chicago Bulls two days earlier.\nOn March 6, 2023, Williams missed two critical free throws in the final seconds, costing his team the victory. Adding to the disappointment, Williams yelled at Cavs shooting guard Donovan Mitchell before the shots that he would make them both. Despite his pledge, both shots missed their mark, resulting in a 118–114 loss in overtime. Williams was attacked online with fans naming him \"Not him\".\nOn May 19, 2023, during game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals versus the Miami Heat, Williams had nine points, two rebounds, two assists and one block in 26 minutes off the bench. After Williams scored on a three-pointer to give Boston a 96–87 lead with 6:37 left, he mouthed some words to Heat forward Jimmy Butler while in transition to defense. Williams then fouled Butler on a made basket. They then confronted each other verbally, resulting in technical fouls being issued to both players. Butler said that the incident energized him; the Heat finished the game on a 24–9 run and won 111–105.\nDallas Mavericks (2023–2024).\nOn July 12, 2023, Williams was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in a sign-and-trade agreement. He made his debut for the Mavericks on October 25, 2023, in a 126–119 win over the San Antonio Spurs.\nCharlotte Hornets (2024–present).\nOn February 8, 2024, Williams was traded to the Charlotte Hornets alongside Seth Curry and a 2027 first-round pick in exchange for P. J. Washington and two future second-round picks.\nPersonal life.\nHis mother, Teresa Johnson, is an electrical engineer for NASA. His father, Gilbert, is a jazz artist and former college basketball player, who has worked as a bodyguard for musicians, including Prince. He is a cousin of former NBA players Salim and Damon Stoudamire. Turning down offers from Ivy League schools Harvard and Yale, Williams graduated from Tennessee in three years with a degree in business. At Tennessee, he received the C &amp; C Millwright Athletic Scholarship.\nWilliams threw out the first pitch at the Boston Red Sox game on August 7, 2019."

        "text": "Holly Bowling (born May 11, 1984) is an American pianist, and keyboardist based in San Francisco. She is known for her solo instrumental performances in addition to her work with Ghost Light, Phil Lesh and Friends, and Greensky Bluegrass. She was named by \"Rolling Stone\" as one of \"Ten New Artists You Need To Know Right Now.\"\nEarly life.\nBowling grew up in Michigan and began playing piano at age 5 under the Suzuki method.\nCareer.\nSolo career.\nBowling’s work originally focused on instrumental arrangements pulled from the songbooks of bands such as the Grateful Dead and Phish. Her career ignited when she released a solo piano performance mirroring a passage of extended improvisation from Phish’s 7/30/13 concert near Lake Tahoe, followed by a rendition of the Grateful Dead’s “Eyes of the World\" from their 6/18/74 Freedom Hall show. Subsequent years saw Bowling’s intricate arrangements shift from being the focal point of her live shows to serving as bookends guiding listeners through long stretches of improvisation, peppered with extended techniques that stretch the intended limits of the instrument.\nBowling has released four instrumental piano albums beginning with 2015’s \"Distillation of a Dream: the Music of Phish Reimagined for Solo Piano\". Her second album, \"Better Left Unsung,\" a collection of solo piano arrangements of the Grateful Dead, followed in 2016 and reached its peak position on the Billboard Classical Albums charts at #25.

        "title": "2018 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans",
        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC, TSN and AP choose third teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2018 College Basketball All-American team is determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are the first team and the next five plus ties are the second team.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by USA Today, Fox Sports, Yahoo! Sports and many others. The scholar-athletes selected by College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) are termed Academic All-Americans.\nIndividual All-America teams.\nBy team.\nAP Honorable Mention:\nAcademic All-Americans.\nOn March 12, 2018, the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) announced the 2018 Academic All-America team, with Jevon Carter headlining the NCAA Division I team as the men's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year. The following is the 2017–18 Academic All-America Division I Men’s Basketball Team as selected by CoSIDA:\nSenior All-Americans.\nThe ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are called Senior All-Americans. The first and second teams, as well as the award winner, were announced during the lead-in to the Final Four. The overall award winner is indicated in bold type."

        "title": "Greatest Royal Rumble",
        "text": "WWE Greatest Royal Rumble was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by the American company WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brand divisions. The event took place on April 27, 2018, at the King Abdullah Sports City's King Abdullah International Stadium in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. It was the first in a series of WWE events held in Saudi Arabia in support of Saudi Vision 2030, the country's social and economic reform program. At the event, all men's main roster championships at the time were defended, in addition to a 50-man Royal Rumble match, titled the Greatest Royal Rumble match.\nThe card comprised 10 matches. In the main event, Raw's Braun Strowman won the Greatest Royal Rumble match to win the WWE Greatest Royal Rumble Trophy and Championship. In the penultimate match, Brock Lesnar retained Raw's Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match. In other prominent matches, SmackDown's WWE Championship match between defending champion AJ Styles and Shinsuke Nakamura resulted in a double countout, The Undertaker defeated Rusev in a casket match, and in the opening bout, John Cena defeated Triple H. The Greatest Royal Rumble match was notable for being Chris Jericho's final match in WWE; Jericho had been employed off-and-on with the company since 1999. After making a few appearances in New Japan Pro-Wrestling, Jericho became one of the first wrestlers to sign with All Elite Wrestling in 2019. The match was also the last match in The Great Khali's and Mark Henry's wrestling career and the last match where Hornswoggle wrestled for WWE. The match was also Hiroki Sumi's only match in WWE.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSince 1988, the Royal Rumble has been an annual January event held by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE, shown on pay-per-view (PPV) since 1989 and the WWE Network since 2015. The event is highlighted by the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers.\nOn March 5, 2018, WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority advertised a live event titled the Greatest Royal Rumble to be held on April 27, 2018, at the King Abdullah International Stadium, part of the King Abdullah Sports City, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The event was announced to feature the largest version of the Royal Rumble match to date, aptly named the Greatest Royal Rumble match, having a total of 50 participants, ousting the 2011 Royal Rumble's 40-man match. The event was the first in a 10-year strategic multi-platform partnership between WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority in support of Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia's social and economic reform program.\nOn March 19, 2018, WWE scheduled matches for all seven of their main roster male championships across the Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brands at the time: Raw's Universal Championship, Intercontinental Championship, and Raw Tag Team Championship, SmackDown's WWE Championship, United States Championship, and SmackDown Tag Team Championship, and 205 Live's Cruiserweight Championship. The event was livestreamed on the WWE Network, as well as traditional pay-per-view in the United States and internationally. The event was also the first WWE pay-per-view with Arabic commentary.\nIn the weeks leading up to the event, WWE held tryouts in Saudi Arabia. From these tryouts, eight were selected to receive training by WWE, which would include an opportunity to earn a spot at the Greatest Royal Rumble event itself.\nStorylines.\nThe card comprised 10 matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\nOn April 9, Brock Lesnar, who had renewed his WWE contract, was scheduled to defend the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match as a rematch from WrestleMania 34. On the \"Raw\" following WrestleMania, Reigns expressed frustration about not being told about his future matches and opponents, singling out the steel cage match with Lesnar. Reigns alleged that there was a conspiracy against him. Samoa Joe, who had been out with an injury since January, came out and warned Reigns that Lesnar would beat him again.\nOn March 26, WWE scheduled a ladder match between then-champion The Miz, Seth Rollins, Finn Bálor, and Samoa Joe for the Intercontinental Championship. At WrestleMania 34, The Miz lost the Intercontinental Championship to Rollins in a triple threat match that also included Bálor, thus making Rollins the defending champion. Both Miz and Joe were traded to SmackDown while Rollins and Bálor remained on Raw.\nOn March 26, Cesaro and Sheamus were scheduled to defend the Raw Tag Team Championship against The Hardy Boyz (Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy). At WrestleMania 34, however, Cesaro and Sheamus lost the titles to Braun Strowman and 10-year-old Nicholas. The following night on \"Raw\", Strowman and Nicholas relinquished the titles due to Nicholas being a fourth grader. Cesaro and Sheamus demanded their titles back, but Raw General Manager Kurt Angle instead scheduled them to face the winner of the four-team Tag Team Eliminator tournament for the vacant titles at the Greatest Royal Rumble. \"Woken\" Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt won the tournament by defeating Titus Worldwide (Apollo Crews and Titus O'Neil) and The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson). Cesaro and Sheamus were then traded to SmackDown during the Superstar Shake-up.\nAt WrestleMania 34, The Bludgeon Brothers (Harper and Rowan) defeated defending champions The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) and The New Day's Big E and Kofi Kingston in a triple threat tag team match to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. On the following \"SmackDown\", The Usos defeated The New Day to earn a title match at Greatest Royal Rumble.\nA match between John Cena and Triple H was scheduled on March 26. \nThe Undertaker was originally scheduled to face Rusev in a casket match, the first match of its kind in three years. Due to reasons not entirely clear, Rusev was temporarily replaced by Chris Jericho — this was explained with Rusev's wife Lana complaining about her husband competing in a casket match — but eventually reinserted back into the match. Jericho was restored to his original participation in the Greatest Royal Rumble match.\nAt WrestleMania 34, Jinder Mahal won the United States Championship. Mahal was then traded to Raw and lost the championship to Jeff Hardy and Mahal invoked his rematch clause for the Greatest Royal Rumble. Hardy was then traded to SmackDown the following night.\nAt WrestleMania 34, AJ Styles successfully defended the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. After the match, Nakamura showed his respect to Styles but then attacked him with a low blow and a \"Kinshasa\", turning heel. On April 17, after repeated attacks on Styles by Nakamura, a rematch between the two was scheduled for the Greatest Royal Rumble.\nOn the WrestleMania 34 Kickoff pre-show, Cedric Alexander defeated Mustafa Ali in the WWE Cruiserweight Championship tournament final to win the vacant title. Two nights later on \"205 Live\", Buddy Murphy attacked Alexander during his celebration. Murphy was then scheduled to face Alexander for the title at the Greatest Royal Rumble, but he failed his mandatory weigh-in when he weighed 207 pounds, 2 pounds over the 205 pound weight limit. He was then removed from the match and banned from competing on \"205 Live\" until he met the weight requirement. The following week, Kalisto earned a Cruiserweight Championship match at the Greatest Royal Rumble by winning a gauntlet match.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with John Cena facing Triple H. During the match, Cena performed an Attitude Adjustment on Triple H for a near-fall. Cena attempted another Attitude Adjustment but Triple H countered into a Pedigree for a near-fall. In the end, Cena performed a second Attitude Adjustment on Triple H, a catapult into the corner, and a third Attitude Adjustment to pick up the victory. Following the match, Cena thanked the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for their hospitality, and expressed excitement over the event.\nIn the following match, Cedric Alexander defended the Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto. The match ended when Alexander countered a Salida Del Sol attempt into a Lumbar Check to retain the title.\nNext, the vacant Raw Tag Team Championship was contested between the team of Bray Wyatt and Matt Hardy and the former champions, Cesaro and Sheamus. In the end, Hardy distracted Sheamus, allowing Wyatt to perform a Sister Abigail on him. Hardy and Wyatt then performed a wheelbarrow Twist of Fate on Sheamus to win the titles.\nJeff Hardy then defended the United States Championship against Jinder Mahal. Hardy performed a Swanton Bomb on Mahal to retain the title.\nAfter that, The Bludgeon Brothers defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The Usos. Harper and Rowan retained the titles after performing The Reckoning on Jimmy Uso.\nNext, Seth Rollins defended the Intercontinental Championship against Finn Balor, Samoa Joe and The Miz in a Ladder match. Near the end of the match, Balor attempted to retrieve the title, only for Rollins to springboard onto the ladder and retrieve the title belt, thus retaining the championship.\nIn a segment between matches, four prospects from the recent Saudi tryouts (including Mansoor) came out to the ring to introduce themselves. Cruiserweight Ariya Daivari and his brother Shawn Daivari, in his first WWE appearance since 2007, came out to interrupt them. The Saudi prospects attacked and cleared the Daivari brothers from the ring.\nLater, AJ Styles defended the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. During the match, Nakamura resorted to various illegal tactics, such as a low blow, increasingly frustrating Styles. In the end, both Nakamura and Styles fought outside of the ring, only for the match to end in a double countout. After the match, Styles performed a Phenomenal Forearm to the floor on Nakamura.\nAfter that, The Undertaker fought Rusev (who was accompanied by Aiden English) in a Casket match. At the end of the match, Undertaker performed a chokeslam on Rusev and rolled him into the casket. Before Undertaker could close the casket, English attacked Undertaker, who retaliated with another chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver before putting English into the casket alongside Rusev and closing it for the victory.\nIn the penultimate match, Brock Lesnar (with Paul Heyman) defended the WWE Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a Steel Cage match. As Reigns attempted a Superman Punch, Lesnar reversed it into four German Suplexes and an F-5. As Lesnar attempted a second F-5, Reigns reversed it into three Superman Punches. As Reigns attempted a Spear, Lesnar reversed it into a second F-5 attempt, but Reigns avoided it by climbing the cage. After both men failed to escape the cage, Reigns performed a Powerbomb on Lesnar from the top of a corner into the ring. After some crashes of Lesnar's body into some cage walls, Reigns performed three Spears for a nearfall. Heyman stopped Reigns from escaping the cage by slamming the door on him and Lesnar performed a second F-5 for a nearfall. Heyman threw a chair into the cage, but as Lesnar removed his MMA gloves and attempted to use it, Reigns performed a fourth Spear for a nearfall. Finally, Reigns performed a combo of four chair shots, a fourth Superman Punch and a fifth Spear on Lesnar through a cage wall. Although Reigns touched the floor with both feet first, the referee called for Lesnar to win the match as he technically escaped the cage first, retaining the WWE Universal Championship.\nMain event.\nDaniel Bryan and Dolph Ziggler began the 50-man Royal Rumble match as the first two entrants. Titus O'Neil entered at No. 39 and tripped on his way to the ring. Bryan survived until the final three, beating Rey Mysterio for the longest time spent in a single Royal Rumble match of all time at an hour and sixteen minutes. In the end, Big Cass eliminated Bryan and attempted a big boot on Braun Strowman, who countered and eliminated Cass to win the match. Strowman also achieved the most eliminations of a single Royal Rumble match at 13, beating out a record previously held by Roman Reigns with 12. Post-match, Strowman received a trophy and the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship.\nControversy.\nWWE had been criticized for holding the event without female wrestlers, who were unable to perform at the event due to the limited rights women have in Saudi Arabia. Triple H, WWE's Executive Vice President of Talent, Live Events and Creative, responded to the criticism: \"I understand that people are questioning it, but you have to understand that every culture is different and just because you don't agree with a certain aspect of it, it doesn't mean it's not a relevant culture...You can't dictate to a country or a religion about how they handle things but, having said that, WWE is at the forefront of a women's evolution in the world and what you can't do is effect change anywhere by staying away from it...While women are not competing in the event, we have had discussions about that and hope that, in the next few years they will be\". Women were in attendance for the event, though only if accompanied by a male guardian. This was a major change from previous events, which were only open to men. Associated Press noted that this is due to \"a series of social changes\" by the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. During the event, WWE aired a promotional video, which included WWE female wrestlers. The Saudi General Sports Authority issued an apology for \"indecent material\" that aired at the event.\nIn addition to the female wrestlers, wrestler Sami Zayn did not participate in the event as Zayn is of Syrian descent, and Saudi Arabia had strained relations with Syria at the time. On the \"Raw\" after the event, a storyline excuse was given in where Sami was suffering from vertigo given to him by Bobby Lashley and therefore couldn't compete.\nAnother subject of criticism was the situation of LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia, as in Saudi Arabia homosexual intercourse is illegal and can be punished by death.\nAl-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a militant group offshoot of Al-Qaeda in Yemen, issued a warning to bin Salman and criticized the WWE event stating that \"Disbelieving wrestlers exposed their privates and on most of them was the sign of the cross, in front of a mixed gathering of young Muslim men and women. The corruptors did not stop at that, for every night musical concerts are being announced, as well as movies and circus shows.\"\nResults.\nTag Team Eliminator bracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChampionship belt.\nAt the conclusion of the Greatest Royal Rumble, Braun Strowman was awarded a trophy and a Greatest Royal Rumble Championship belt. According to \"The Sportster\", \"the likelihood is that nothing that took place in the main event will have any effect on anything once WWE arrives back in the United States and resume normal service.\" Although WWE.com had originally listed Strowman as the Greatest Royal Rumble Champion after the event, he never appeared with the belt at any other event and the title was never mentioned again.\nThe base design was similar to the current design of the WWE Championship introduced in 2014, with some differences. Instead of a large cut out of the WWE logo, the center plate was modeled with an Arabic pattern with the WWE logo in the center. Like the WWE Championship belt and other belts introduced since 2016, the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship belt contained two side plates, both separated by gold divider bars, with removable round sections that could be replaced with the current champion's logo; the default plates showed the official logo of Saudi General Sports Authority, which is identical to the national emblem of Saudi Arabia. The plates were on a green leather strap resembling the color of the national flag of Saudi Arabia."

The competition for women had been held earlier in the month in Bucharest. The event in Ghent was held from 25 to 28 August and they competed in all seven Olympic boat classes (M1x, M2x, M2-, M2+, M4-, M4+, M8+). Some 400 competitors from 21 countries competed.\nGerman participation.\nThe National Olympic Committee of the GDR was granted provisional membership in 1955 and as a next step, East Germany tried to gain membership of the individual sporting organisations that participated in Olympic disciplines. In July 1955, the East German rowing association applied for a license from FISA, the International Rowing Federation, to be able to nominate their rowers at the European Championships in Bucharest (women) and Ghent (men). FISA's response was that the next congress, to be held just prior to the championships in Ghent, will decide on the matter. Therefore, East German teams could not compete in 1955. At the congress, East Germany was unanimously accepted as a new member.\nWest Germany was represented in Ghent in six boat classes.\nRomania.\nA Romanian crew won gold with the coxless four. This was the country's first gold medal in international rowing."

        "text": "Lorenzo Lemuel Carter (born December 10, 1995) is an American football linebacker for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Georgia, and was selected in the third round of the 2018 NFL Draft by the New York Giants.\nEarly years.\nCarter attended and played high school football at Norcross High School. He was named to the \"USA Today\" All-USA High School Football Team after his senior year in 2013. A 4-star defensive end recruit, Carter committed to Georgia to play college football over offers from Alabama, Florida, LSU, and Notre Dame, among many others.\nCollege career.\nCarter attended and played college football at Georgia under head coaches Mark Richt and Kirby Smart. As a true freshman at Georgia, Carter played 13 games making 5 starts, and received the University of Georgia newcomer of the year award. After the 2016 season, Carter announced that he would return to school for his senior season, despite speculation that he might declare for the 2017 NFL Draft. Carter played in 54 games with 26 starts in his career at Georgia, recording 166 total tackles, 14 sacks, 6 forced fumbles, 6 fumble recoveries, and one defensive touchdown. He was named Second Team All-Southeastern Conference as a senior in 2017. \nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nCarter attended the NFL Scouting Combine and completed the majority of drills, but opted to skip the bench press, short shuttle, and three-cone drill.

On March 21, 2018, Carter participated at Georgia's pro day, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only performed positional drills. He attended pre-draft visits and private workouts with the San Francisco 49ers, Denver Broncos, and Minnesota Vikings. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Carter was projected to be a second round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the second best outside linebacker by DraftScout.com and was ranked the fifth best defensive end by Scouts Inc.\nNew York Giants.\nThe New York Giants selected Carter in the third round (66th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. Carter was the eighth linebacker drafted in 2018.\nOn May 10, 2018, the Giants signed Carter to a four-year, $4.08 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $1.04 million. In Week 3, against the Houston Texans, Carter recorded his first professional sack.\nIn week 6 of the 2019 season against the New England Patriots, Carter forced a fumble on Tom Brady which was recovered by teammate Markus Golden who returned it for a touchdown in the 35–14 loss. He finished the season second on the team with 4.5 sacks.\nCarter entered the 2020 season as one of the Giants starting pass rushers. In Week 5, he suffered a ruptured Achilles and was placed on season-ending injured reserve on October 19.\nOn Week 5 of the 2021 NFL season against the Dallas Cowboys Carter got his first career interception from Dak Prescott.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nCarter signed a one-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons on March 22, 2022, worth up to $3.5 million with $2 million guaranteed. In Week 2, against the defending Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams, Falcons linebacker Troy Andersen blocked a punt, allowing Carter to pick up the loose ball and run it back to the endzone for a special teams touchdown in the 31–27 loss. In Week 8, against the Carolina Panthers, Carter recorded a pick-six off Panthers quarterback P. J. Walker in the 37–34 win. Overall, Carter started all 17 games for the Falcons in the 2022 season, recording 58 total tackles, 4 sacks, 1 fumble recovery, 1 interception, and a defensive touchdown.\nOn March 7, 2023, Carter re-signed with the Falcons on a two-year contract worth up to $9 million, with $5.25 million guaranteed.

As a founding sport, athletics has appeared consistently since its introduction at the 1911 Inter-Empire Games; the recognized precursor to the Commonwealth Games. The competition took place between Sunday 8–15 April 2018 at the Carrara Stadium.\nThe programme featured an expanded event set for para-athletes with a total of six men's and six women's events, re presenting doubling of the number para-events at the previous games. This move was approved of by the para-athletes, and Kailyn Joseph noted that inclusion in the medal table alongside able-bodied events allowed her to share in the same environment, as opposed to the separation found in the Paralympics and World Para Athletics Championships.\nTwo Indian athletes, racewalker Irfan Kolothum Thodi and triple jumper A.V. Rakesh Babu were removed from the games after a needle was found in their apartment, breaking games policy. A Singapore para-athlete, Mohammad Khairi Ishak, was withdrawn from the men's T47 100 m after failing a drug test prior to the competition. Other controversies of the athletics included the gold medal disqualification of Zharnel Hughes in the men's 200 m, after he impeded (eventual gold medallist) Jereem Richards, and the mid-race collapse of men's marathon leader Callum Hawkins.\nPreparation.\nIn preparation for hosting the Commonwealth Games Athletics events, the modified Carrara Stadium was used for the Australian Athletics Championships in February 2018.\nThe Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority conducted a series of anti-doping tests in the months before the games. Australian sprinter Jessica Peris (daughter of former Commonwealth Games sprint champion Nova Peris) was among those to a fail doping test and she withdrew from the Australian trials event.\nSchedule.\nOver the 10 days of competition there were 58 medal events including additional para-sport disciplines."

After the first round, however, teams were now \"re-seeded\" so the highest-remaining team was paired with the lowest-remaining time in one semifinal with the other two teams slotted into the other semifinal.\nNevada, in their first year as Big West members (moving from the Big Sky), failed to qualify for the tournament.

It featured two hit singles; \"Undecided\" and \"Buried and Dead\", both of which has been released on \"The Masters Apprentices\" EP in February 1967.\nBackground.\nIn mid-1966 Adelaide-based rock group, the Masters Apprentices, shared a gig with pop star, Bobby Bright (of Melbourne duo, Bobby &amp; Laurie), who was impressed and recommended them to his label, Astor Records. A few weeks later, they were contacted by Astor's Max Pepper, who requested a four-track demo. The band went to Pepper's local two-track studio to record it, : \"Hot Gully Wind\", \"Buried and Dead\", \"She's My Girl\" and \"Undecided\". The demo became their debut extended play, \"The Masters Apprentices\" (February 1967).\n\"Undecided\" was released as the group's debut single, \"Undecided\" backed by \"Wars or Hands of Time\", was released in October 1966 and gradually climbed the Adelaide charts, due to support from local DJs, peaking at No. 4. The B-side, \"Wars or Hands of Time\", written solely by Bower, is the first Australian pop song to directly address the issue of the Vietnam War, which was then affecting the lives of many young Australians because of the controversial introduction of conscription in 1965. Teen pop newspaper, \"Go-Set\", started publishing their national singles charts in October 1966. By February of the following year the group had relocated to Melbourne and issued their four-track EP (which was self-titled) on Astor. \"Undecided\" peaked at No. 13 on the \"Go-Set\" National Top 40 in June 1967, spending sixteen weeks in the charts.\nDue to the success of \"Undecided\" and the EP, Astor requested additional tracks to be recorded for a full length album. The album itself is a compilation of the four tracks featured on the EP, five cover songs (\"Dancing Girl\", \"I Feel Fine\", \"My Girl\", \"Don't Fight It\" and \"Johnny B Goode\") and two new originals (\"But One Day\" and \"Theme For A Social Climber\") written by then chief songwriter and guitarist Mick Bower.\nThe album was released by Astor Records in June, 1967. It was later reissued on the budget Summit Records label in 1971. In 2009 a 2 CD special edition was released by reissue label Aztec Music.\nReception.\nIn a retrospective review Allmusic was mixed on the album saying that the \"Debut mixes sloppy covers of popular '60s rock and soul tunes with some fine originals\".\nTrack listing.\nAll songs written by Mick Bower except as noted."

        "title": "Tell-tale (sailing)",
        "text": "A tell-tale, in a nautical or sailing context, is a piece of yarn or fabric attached to a sail, a stay, or any rigging on a sailboat. Typically, a tell-tale is on a port and a starboard stay.\nTell-tales attached to a sail are used as a guide for trimming (adjusting) a sail. On the mainsail tell-tales may be placed on the leech (aft edge) and when trimmed properly should be streaming backwards while on a beat (upwind). When placed on the luff (forward or mast edge of the mainsail) they are used to indicate that the sail is luffing or coming head to wind. The solution is to bear away from the wind or sheet in. \nOn the jib there may be tell-tales on both sides of the luff of the sail. As a general guide, the windward tell-tale should stream aft (backwards) with an occasional lift, the leeward front tell-tale should stream aft when on a beat to windward. If one tell-tale begins to spiral, it is indicating the sail has detached air flow on that side. To correct this the sail needs to move towards the opposite side. \"Tiller to tattling tail\" is a good phrase to remember which direction to push the tiller when the tail is spiraling. Alternatively, the sail itself can be sheeted in or out towards the tell-tale which is not streaming. For example, a luffing windward telltale would indicate an under-trimmed sail, requiring the crew to sheet in that sail. A luffing leeward telltale would indicate an over-trimmed sail, requiring the crew to ease the sheets for that sail.\nThey are used both sides of the jib.\nA tell-tale compass or repeating compass is a special compass installed in the ceiling of a cabin, and can be read from below or above deck. According to \"Moby-Dick\", a tell-tale refers to the cabin-compass, \"because without going to the compass at the helm, the captain, while below, can inform himself of the course of the ship.\"\nTypes.\nThere are three types of telltale:\nDraft telltales tend to be made from wool. Leech and shroud telltales are usually made from ribbon. \nReading draft telltales.\nIf the sails are under-trimmed or the vessel is pointing too high then the telltales on the inside of the sail will stall/lift whilst the ones on the outside will stream aft. If the sails are over-trimmed or the vessel is sailing too low then the telltales on the outside of the sail will stall/lift whilst the inside ones will stream aft."

The event took on indoor hard courts. It served as the season-ending championships for players on the ATP Tour.\nThe eight players who qualified for the event were split into two groups of four. During this stage, players competed in a round-robin format (meaning players played against all the other players in their group).\nThe two players with the best results in each group progressed to the semifinals, where the winners of a group faced the runners-up of the other group.

Watson attended Cumberland Christian School, from which he graduated in 2008. He attended Roberts Wesleyan College before transferring to the University of the Arts in Philadelphia and had competed in track in the 100m, 200m and the 4x100m relay at the junior level until an injury prevented him from advancing to the top levels of competition in track and field. \nWatson found the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation after checking out the tryout pages for every sport in which the United States was represented in international competition and chose skeleton after seeing a series of videos. An aspiring Olympian from the time he was a child, Watson participated for three years in the American training program for bobsled and skeleton, but \"left on peaceful terms\". Given that his father had been born in Jamaica, Watson was eligible to compete on behalf of his father's native country. Ranked 79th in the world based on his competition results, his qualification standards with the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation were not sufficient for him to be eligible to receive one of the 30 guaranteed berths granted for male competitors to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, but Watson was given the final slot to represent Jamaica after nations with individuals who had better times turned down spots, making him the first athlete from Jamaica to compete in skeleton.\nWith finishing times of 53.13, 54.04 and 53.35 seconds in the Olympic skeleton competition, Watson finished in 29th place in each of the three first heats. His top speed was , reached during the first heat. His total time in the three heats of 2:40.52 meant that he did not qualify for the final race; he placed him almost 10 seconds behind Yun Sung-bin of South Korea, who went on to win the gold medal."

It was the first time that Papua New Guinea had qualified for a World Cup in any format. Ireland became the second team to qualify when they won Group B, also on net run rate. Both teams also advanced to the playoff section of the qualifier. They were joined by the Netherlands, Namibia and Scotland from Group A, and Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong from Group B.\nIn the first qualifier match in the playoffs, the Netherlands qualified for the T20 World Cup when they beat the United Arab Emirates by eight wickets, after the UAE only scored 80 runs in their innings.

Scotland beat tournament hosts the United Arab Emirates in the third qualifier by 90 runs to secure their place in the Men's T20 World Cup.

The remaining six entrants from the last tournament competed in the Regional Qualifiers of the World Cup qualifying tournaments. Of the teams in the ICC T20I Championship ranking, initially the United Arab Emirates and Nepal could only qualify through regional competitions. However, in March 2019, the ICC announced that the UAE would host the qualifier tournament, resulting in their automatic qualification.

On 26 October 2019, in an interview for \"The National\", Shabber denied any involvement with corruption and announced his retirement from cricket, citing the poor remuneration for playing. He said that \"if there is something with regards to anti-corruption, I am ready to cooperate in Pakistan. But I have decided cricket is not in my future\".\nFollowing the conclusion of the group stage, the ICC's Event Technical Committee approved two replacements in the UAE's squad. Faizan Asif replaced Ashfaq Ahmed and Vriitya Aravind was named as Ghulam Shabber's replacement. On 30 October 2019, the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that they had suspended Shabber for absconding, and that he was part of the ICC's anti-corruption investigation. In March 2021, Mohammad Naveed and Shaiman Anwar were both found guilty of corruption, with each player given an eight-year ban from all cricket, backdated to 16 October 2019. In July 2021, the ICC also handed eight-year bans to Amir Hayat and Ashfaq Ahmed for violating the anti-corruption code. Their bans were both backdated to 13 September 2020.

        "text": "Robert Arthur Cummings (19 May 1899 – 26 May 1969) was an Australian rowing coxswain. He was a three-time national champion who represented Australia in the 1924 Summer Olympics in the stern of the men's eight.\nClub and state rowing.\nCummings was employed as a Postal Assistant and his senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Cummings was coxswain in each of those crews and steered the 1920, 1922 and 1923, South Australian eights to victory. In 1921, 1922 and 1923 he was in those crews with his older brother Frank Cummings.\nInternational representative rowing.\nThe South Australian media pushed for the victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign. By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Cummings and the South Australian crew including his brother Frank, were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics.\nFunding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed \"the Murray Cods\". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour a number of the crew (including Cummings) busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm.\nIn the Olympic regatta, with Cummings in the stern the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final.\nBob Cummings continued on as a first-class coxswain after the Olympics. He coxed South Australian representative eights in the King's Cup campaigns of 1925 (fourth) and 1926 (second)."

        "title": "Major League Baseball Authentication Program",
        "text": "The Major League Baseball Authentication Program, or MLB Authentication Program, is a program run by Major League Baseball Properties, the product licensing arm of Major League Baseball, to guarantee the authenticity of baseball merchandise and memorabilia. The centerpiece of the system is a tamper-resistant security tape sticker with an embedded hologram. Each sticker carries a unique alphanumeric code. The sticker is affixed to all game-used merchandise and memorabilia, while information about the item is entered into a computer database. Between 500,000 and 600,000 items are authenticated each season.\nBackground.\nOperation Bullpen.\nMajor League Baseball started running an authentication program in 2001 after the FBI \"Operation Bullpen\" became widely publicized. Phase 1 of Operation Bullpen began in 1999 and uncovered $100 million worth of memorabilia-related forgeries. This operation was related to the earlier Operation Foulball in San Diego, but covered nationwide crimes. The FBI became aware of the scale of the forgery after following up a tip by Tony Gwynn. Gwynn noticed a sloppy forgery at a team store in Encinitas and alerted both Padres team management and MLB security. From there, it grew into a national investigation of forged memorabilia.\nDuring the investigation, it was discovered that 75 percent of autographs purported to be from MLB players and other personnel were fake. Among these forgeries were supposed autographs by Mickey Mantle, as well as a baseball with a forged signature from the Catholic saint Mother Teresa. Even official team stores sometimes unknowingly stocked fake merchandise. Operation Bullpen began in the 1990s and focused on basketball before expanding to all sports, including baseball. Gwynn and other ballplayers like Mark McGwire assisted with the investigation by helping to authenticate items and confirm forgeries of their own signatures.\nStage 2 of Operation Bullpen began in 2002 and included forgeries which were sold online. During the investigation the FBI seized large amounts of sports gear with forged signatures, and defaced the signatures to prevent them from fooling members of the public. They then donated the baseballs and bats to local youth baseball leagues, as part of Phase III.\nLater incidents.\nThe organization has continued to have a long-running issue with counterfeiting in general, which peaks during the postseason. For example, during the 2011 National League Championship Series between the St Louis Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers, MLB officials confiscated over 5,000 counterfeited items, with more than 80 percent being found in the vicinity of Busch Stadium. The largest haul is during the World Series, when thousands of knock-off jerseys, caps, bags, and other items of merchandise are seized.\nDuring the San Francisco Giants’ 2014 World Series race, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents seized over 2,700 pieces of counterfeit MLB merchandise in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nProgram description.\nThe authentication system centers on a hologram sticker by OpSec, which carries its own individual alphanumeric code. The sticker is tamper-resistant: the embedded hologram is ruined if the sticker is removed from the item.\nMLB employs approximately 220 authenticators as of 2022, with several being appointed to each team. At least two MLB authenticators are present at every MLB game, as well as the World Baseball Classic and team-specific events. MLB postseason games will have three or more authenticators. The authenticators all have a background in law enforcement and are recommended to the role by their local police departments. The authenticator usually sits in the first base camera well. Every ball that is taken out of play, without leaving the ballpark, is handed to the authenticator, who enters information about that ball into a computer database—such as \"the pitcher, batter, inning and the reason the ball came out of play\"—and then affixes the hologram. \nWhile anything that goes into the stands is generally considered outside their jurisdiction, if there is a batter's milestone occurring, the authenticators will often work with the umpires to mark up baseballs to ensure that even if the milestone ball is hit into the stands, it can be tracked and later authenticated.\nItems authenticated.\nUsually the MLB Authentication Program authenticates items used during baseball games, with baseballs and baseball bats being the most common. Other game-used items which are authenticated include \"player jerseys, locker tags, lineup cards, the pitching rubber, home plate, broken bats\", and base pads. Any player can request that any item be authenticated, with the request usually being passed to the authenticators by the relevant clubhouse manager.\nAny item with an MLB association can be authenticated. One example of this was when the Baltimore Orioles authenticated the remains of a dugout telephone that was smashed by the Boston Red Sox's David Ortiz. They then presented the phone to Ortiz during his retirement season. After the Houston Astros' Game 7 win in the 2017 World Series at Dodger Stadium, MLB authenticated jars of dirt taken from the field.\nBetween 500,000 and 600,000 items are authenticated each season. Game-used memorabilia remains the property of each team, which authenticates items for players who have reached certain milestones, for sale to fans at the team store or on the MLB online store, and for sale to retailers and other marketers of authenticated MLB merchandise. Occasionally items are sent for inclusion in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.\nIn 2001 MLB Properties contracted with the Arthur Andersen accounting firm to oversee and authenticate private autographing sessions for balls, bats, base pads, and other items. The Deloitte &amp; Touche accounting firm took over this role in 2002."

The entrance of the stadium resembles traditional Nepalese architecture. The stadium also have two grounds for practice on its outskirts.\nThe land for the construction has been provided by the Government of Nepal through Bharatpur Metropolitan City. The co-founder of the Dhurmus-Suntali foundation Sitaram Kattel says that the stadium will be funded by generous donors from all around the world. He hopes that if the donations are not sufficient then the Government will provide funds to finish the project.\nThe government has decided to take ownership of the Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium in Chitwan and complete the stadium. A meeting of the cabinet held on Monday made the decision to this effect.\nThe construction work of the Bharatpur-based stadium was halted in March 2022 after Dhurmus-Suntali Foundation withdrew from the construction of the stadium after not being able to pay the amount of materials purchased on loan.\nAlthough the Foundation handed over the ownership of the stadium to the Bharatpur Metropolis, it was not clear how to proceed with the rest of its construction work.\nFor the stadium, the Bagmati State government announced that it would contribute Rs 300 million, Bharatpur Metropolitan City Rs 160 million, and the District Coordination Committee Rs 22 million."

The season saw Zion Williamson dominate Player of the Year honors and media attention, while Virginia won its first NCAA Championship. The NCAA Championship Game between Virginia and Texas Tech would mark the final NCAA game with a 20-foot 9 inch three-point shot line, as it moved out to the FIBA standard of 22 feet and 2 inches the following year.\nRule changes.\nOn February 22, 2019, the NCAA announced a set of experimental rules that it would use in the 2019 National Invitation Tournament.\nThe following rules were also used in the 2018 NIT:\nA set of rules relating to free throws that had been used in the 2017 NIT was used again in the 2019 edition, with one modification:\nConference membership changes.\nSix schools joined new conferences for the 2018–19 season. Four schools switched between Division I conferences for the 2018–19 season. In addition, two schools moved from Division II starting this season and are ineligible for NCAA-sponsored postseason play until completing their D-I transitions in 2022.\nIn addition to the schools changing conferences, the 2018–19 season was the last for Savannah State in D-I with its decision to reclassify all of its sports to D-II.\nAlso, one D-I member adopted a new institutional and athletic identity. The 2017–18 school year was the last for Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) as a single institution; the school's health sciences programs were taken over by Indiana University as Indiana University Fort Wayne, while all other academic programs are now governed by Purdue University as Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW). As noted previously, the former IPFW athletic program was inherited by PFW and is now known as the Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons.\nArenas.\nArenas reopening.\nFour teams returned to newly renovated arenas, all of which were closed for the 2017–18 season.\nSeason outlook.\nPre–season polls.\nThe top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaches Polls.\nRegular season.\nUpsets.\nAn upset is a victory by an underdog team.

        "text": "Cody Lee Martin (born September 28, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the NC State Wolfpack and the Nevada Wolf Pack. He is the twin brother of Caleb Martin. He was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets in the second round of the 2019 NBA draft.\nHigh school career.\nMartin played basketball for prep powerhouse Oak Hill Academy with his twin brother Caleb Martin. Prior to playing at Oak Hill, Cody and his brother played three seasons at Davie County High School in Mocksville, North Carolina. He also played football his freshman year of high school. The two chose North Carolina State University over Rutgers and Providence.\nCollege career.\nAs a sophomore at NC State, he averaged 6.0 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game. Following that season, the Martin twins chose to transfer to Nevada to play for coach Eric Musselman. After sitting out a season as a redshirt, Cody Martin was named Mountain West Conference defensive player of the year. He averaged 14 points, 6.3 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game and led the Wolf Pack to an NCAA Tournament appearance. After the season, he and his brother declared for the 2018 NBA draft without hiring an agent, thus preserving their ability to return to college. They were also participants for the NBA Draft Combine that year, but both ultimately decided to stay for their senior seasons in Nevada.\nComing into his senior season, Martin was named to the Preseason MWC Team.\nProfessional career.\nCharlotte Hornets (2019–present).\nMartin was selected 36th overall in the 2019 NBA draft by his hometown team, the Charlotte Hornets. On July 31, 2019, Martin signed with the Hornets. On October 25, 2019, Martin made his NBA debut, coming off from bench in a 99–121 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves with four points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal. On November 29, 2019, Martin received his first assignment to the Hornets' NBA G League affiliate, the Greensboro Swarm. On February 13, 2020, he scored a season-high 13 points, alongside eight rebounds, three assists and three steals, in a 100–112 loss to the Orlando Magic. Martin again scored 13 points, alongside five rebounds, four assists and two steals, in a 103–104 loss to the San Antonio Spurs.\nOn April 25, 2021, Martin recorded a season-high 13 points, alongside ten rebounds, five assists and two blocks, in a 125–104 win over the Boston Celtics.\nOn December 15, 2021, Martin scored a career-high 21 points, alongside eight rebounds and three assists, in a 131–115 win over the San Antonio Spurs.\nOn July 2, 2022, Martin re-signed with the Hornets on a four-year, $32 million contract. He missed four out of the Hornets' five preseason games with left knee tendiopathy. During the Hornets' season-opening 129–102 win over the San Antonio Spurs on October 19, Martin only played 56 seconds before injuring his left quad and exiting the game. On November 11, he underwent an arthroscopic procedure on his left knee and was set to be re-evaluated in four weeks. Martin made his return to the lineup on January 4, 2023, recording four points, four rebounds and two assists in a 131–107 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies."

A few days later, Dominica won its first ever silver medal when Yordanys Duranona Garcia came second in the men's triple jump event.\nBritish Virgin Islands won its first Commonwealth Games medal when Kyron McMaster won a gold in the men's 400m hurdles.\nSaint Lucia won its first Commonwealth Games gold medal when Levern Spencer won the women's high jump event.\nMedal table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt; \nThe ranking in this table is consistent with the International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \"nation\" is an entity represented by a Commonwealth Games Association). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their three-letter country code.\nAustralia came in first in the medal table rank with 78 gold, the second being England with 45 gold, and the third being India with 26 gold.\nTwo bronze medals were awarded in boxing. In four events of wrestling, only five nations entered the event, per Commonwealth Games regulations, only one bronze medal was available. No bronze medal was awarded in the women's 50 metre butterfly S7, women's powerlifting heavyweight, and women's wrestling freestyle 50 kg, as only four athletes competed in the event, and per Commonwealth Games regulations, the bronze medal was not available. At women's tandem sprint B and women's tandem 1 km time trial B only one gold medal was available, as only three nations entered the event.\nAdditionally, two silver medals were awarded in the men's gymnastics horizontal bar, men's 100 metre freestyle, and the women's 50 metre freestyle\nas a result of a tie between two athletes. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals.\n Host nation\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "The 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2018–19 season. The playoffs began on April 10, 2019, after the regular season, and they concluded on June 12, 2019, with the St. Louis Blues winning their first Stanley Cup in franchise history defeating the Boston Bruins four games to three in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. The Pittsburgh Penguins increased their post-season appearance streak to thirteen seasons, the current longest streak. The Carolina Hurricanes made the playoffs for the first time since 2009, ending a nine-year playoff drought. For the second season in a row, the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs were the only Original Six teams to make the playoffs, marking the fifth time in league history (after 2000, 2001, 2007 and 2018) that only two Original Six teams clinched a playoff berth. For the first time since 2004, both Southern California teams, the Anaheim Ducks and Los Angeles Kings, missed the playoffs. For the second time in League history (and the second season in a row), both the Detroit Red Wings and Montreal Canadiens missed the playoffs.\nFor the first time in NHL history, all division winners were eliminated in the first round as all the wild-cards advanced to the second round. The Columbus Blue Jackets won a playoff series for the first time, defeating the first-place Lightning in four games, and marking the first time in Stanley Cup playoff history that the Presidents' Trophy winners were swept in the opening round, and the first time since 2012 that the Presidents' Trophy winners were defeated in the opening round. They were soon followed by the Calgary Flames, who with their five-game loss to the Colorado Avalanche, ensured that for the first time in NHL history, neither of the conference number one seeds advanced to the second round. After that, the two remaining division winners, the Nashville Predators and Washington Capitals, were each eliminated in an overtime game, the Predators in six to the Dallas Stars and the defending champion Capitals in seven to the Carolina Hurricanes. Also for the first time since 2012, none of the previous year's Conference finalists (the Capitals, the Lightning, the Golden Knights, and the Jets) made it to the second round. For the first time in League history, three series were decided in game seven overtime. It was also the first year since 2007 that neither the Washington Capitals nor the Pittsburgh Penguins made the second round.\nThe Blues tied the 1987 Philadelphia Flyers, 2004 Calgary Flames, 2014 Los Angeles Kings, and 2015 Tampa Bay Lightning for playing the most playoff games (26) in a four-round playoff format. The record for most playoff games was subsequently broken by the 2020 Dallas Stars, who played 27 games during the expanded 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Kings were the only other Stanley Cup champions to play 26 games.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThis was the sixth year in which the top three teams in each division make the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference).\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team was at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top three teams in each division made the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference, for a total of eight teams from each conference.\nIn the first round, the lower seeded wild card in the conference played against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card played against the other division winner, and both wild cards were de facto #4 seeds. The other series matched the second and third place teams from the divisions. In the first two rounds, home ice advantage was awarded to the team with the better seed. Thereafter, it was awarded to the team that had the better regular season record followed by any necessary tie breakers.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFirst round.\nEastern Conference first round.\n(A1) Tampa Bay Lightning vs. (WC2) Columbus Blue Jackets.\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning earned the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's best regular season team with 128 points. Columbus finished as the Eastern Conference's second wild card, earning 98 points. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Tampa Bay won all three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Blue Jackets defeated the Lightning in a four-game sweep. In game one, the Blue Jackets scored four unanswered goals to overcome a three-goal deficit, winning 4–3. Matt Duchene scored a goal and two assists for Columbus in game two, granting the Blue Jackets a 5–1 victory and a 2–0 series lead. During the game Nikita Kucherov hit Markus Nutivaara in the head, prompting NHL Player Safety to suspend the Lightning forward for game three. During said game, Sergei Bobrovsky made 30 saves, giving the Blue Jackets a 3–1 victory and their first 3–0 series lead in franchise history. In game four, the Lightning, desperate for a victory, could not overcome the early two-goal deficit they faced in the first period, allowing Columbus to score three empty-net goals late in the third period and win 7–3, sweeping Tampa Bay 4–0 and earning their first playoff series victory in franchise history. The Lightning became the first Presidents' Trophy winners to be swept in the opening round, and the first Presidents' Trophy winners to be defeated in the opening round since 2012.\n(A2) Boston Bruins vs. (A3) Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThe Boston Bruins finished second in the Atlantic Division, earning 107 points. The Toronto Maple Leafs earned 100 points to finish third in the Atlantic Division. This was the sixteenth playoff meeting overall, and second consecutive, between these two teams, with Toronto winning eight of the fifteen previous series. They last met in the previous year's Eastern Conference first round, which Boston won in seven games. Boston won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Bruins defeated the Maple Leafs in seven games. Mitch Marner scored twice in Toronto's game one victory, the final score of which was 4–1. Game two saw controversy in officiating, with Bruins players becoming more physical, to the point where Boston forward Jake DeBrusk collided with Toronto forward Nazem Kadri, who was skating hard out of the penalty box, resulting in a knee-on-knee collision, injuring the Maple Leafs forward. No penalty was called on the play. Kadri would return to the game, but retaliated against DeBrusk, cross-checking the forward in the head, resulting in a major penalty for the Toronto forward. Kadri was suspended for the remainder of the series. The Bruins ended the game 4–1. In game three, Auston Matthews and Andreas Johnsson scored a goal and notched an assist, leading the Maple Leafs to a 3–2 victory. In game four, the Bruins held on for a 6–4 victory, keeping the Maple Leafs from tying in the closing minutes after leading by three goals in the third period. The Maple Leafs scored twice in the third period of game five and held onto a one-goal lead late in the game to give Toronto a 2–1 victory and a 3–2 series lead. In game six, Brad Marchand had two goals and an assist in a 4–2 Bruins victory to push the series to a seventh game. In the seventh game, Boston goalie Tuukka Rask made 32 saves to defeat the Maple Leafs 5–1 and advance to the second round.\n(M1) Washington Capitals vs. (WC1) Carolina Hurricanes.\nThe Washington Capitals finished first in the Metropolitan Division earning 104 points.

In game three, Carolina forward Warren Foegele scored twice and assisted once as the Hurricanes limited the Capitals to 18 shots in a 5–0 blowout victory. During the game rookie Andrei Svechnikov was challenged by Alexander Ovechkin to a fight during which the young Hurricane forward was knocked out and removed from the game due to concussion protocol. The Capitals increased their shot count in game four, but Hurricanes goalie Petr Mrazek stopped 30 of those 31 shots, evening the series in a 2–1 victory. In game five, the Capitals blew out the Hurricanes 6–0 with Backstrom scoring two goals and adding two assists, as goaltender Braden Holtby stopped all 30 shots he faced. Carolina broke the tie in game six as they scored three goals in the third period to force a seventh game. The Hurricanes rallied from two separate two goal deficits to tie game seven forcing overtime. In double overtime, Carolina forward Brock McGinn ended the third longest game seven in NHL history at 11:05 by tipping in Justin Williams' shot to send the Hurricanes to the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 2009; with the victory Carolina has won five consecutive game sevens dating back to 2006.\n(M2) New York Islanders vs. (M3) Pittsburgh Penguins.\nThe New York Islanders finished second in the Metropolitan Division with 103 points. The Pittsburgh Penguins earned 100 points to finish third in the Metropolitan Division. This was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams with New York winning three of the four previous series. They last met in the 2013 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which Pittsburgh won in six games. These teams split their four-game regular season series. This was the first time since the 1988 Patrick Division semifinals that the Islanders had home-ice advantage in a playoff series.\nThe Islanders defeated the Penguins in a four-game sweep. This was the first time the Islanders swept a series since winning the Stanley Cup back in 1983. In game one, New York goalie Robin Lehner made 41 saves and Josh Bailey scored 4:39 into overtime to give the Islanders a 4–3 victory. Jordan Eberle had a goal and an assist in game two, leading the Islanders to a 3–1 victory. In game three, Lehner stopped 25 of 26 shots helping the Islanders win 4–1. Game four was a tight-checking, defensive affair as the Islanders kept a one-goal lead over the Penguins for two periods until an empty-net goal by Bailey sealed the victory for New York defeating Pittsburgh 3–1 and advancing to the second round in a 4–0 sweep.\nWestern Conference first round.\n(C1) Nashville Predators vs. (WC1) Dallas Stars.\nThe Nashville Predators finished first in the Central Division earning 100 points. Dallas finished as the Western Conference's first wild card earning 93 points. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Nashville won three of the five games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Stars defeated the Predators in six games. Dallas rookie Miro Heiskanen scored a goal and an assist to help the Stars achieve a 3–2 victory in game one. In game two, both teams played defensively forcing an overtime period in which Nashville forward Craig Smith scored to give the Predators a 2–1 victory.

In another goalie performance for game four, Dallas' own Ben Bishop made 34 saves shutting down the Predators in a 5–1 victory. In game five, Alexander Radulov scored twice with captain Jamie Benn assisting thrice for the Stars taking the series lead in a 5–3 victory. During a defensive game six, both teams fired more than 35 shots apiece in regulation time with each team scoring once. In the resulting overtime period John Klingberg put away the series-winning goal at 17:02 for Dallas, winning the series 4–2 and the game 2–1.\n(C2) Winnipeg Jets vs. (C3) St. Louis Blues.\nThe Winnipeg Jets finished second in the Central Division, earning 99 points. The St. Louis Blues also earned 99 points, but they finished third in the Central Division as Winnipeg won the first tie-breaker of combined regulation and overtime wins. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. This was also the first playoff meeting between the two cities since 1982. Winnipeg won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Blues defeated the Jets in six games. For the first time since the 2004 Western Conference Final, the away team won the first five games in the series. In game one, rookie goaltender Jordan Binnington made 24 saves to give St. Louis a 2–1 victory. Oskar Sundqvist scored twice for the Blues in game two taking the triumph 4–3. In game three, Winnipeg forward Kyle Connor scored twice in a 6–3 victory.

His goal also Winnipeg's first playoff overtime goal in franchise history. Winnipeg took a two-goal lead in game five, but St. Louis tied the game in the third period and with 15 seconds left, Jaden Schwartz scored to give St. Louis a 3–2 victory. Schwartz scored a natural hat trick in game six as the Blues hung on to a 3–2 series clinching victory.\n(P1) Calgary Flames vs. (WC2) Colorado Avalanche.\nThe Calgary Flames finished first in the Pacific Division earning 107 points. The Colorado Avalanche earned 90 points to finish as the Western Conference's second wild card. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Calgary won all three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Avalanche defeated the Flames in five games. In game one, goalie Mike Smith stopped all 26 shots he faced and assisted on one of Calgary's four goals in the Flames 4–0 victory. Game two necessitated overtime, and Nathan MacKinnon scored to give the Avalanche a 3–2 victory.

The Vegas Golden Knights earned 93 points to finish third in Pacific Division. This was the second playoff meeting between these teams. They last met in the previous year's Western Conference second round which Vegas won in six games. These teams split their four-game regular season series.\nThe Sharks came back from a 3–1 series deficit to defeat the Golden Knights in seven games. Four Sharks players scored a goal and assisted on another goal in game one, giving San Jose a 5–2 victory. In game two, after a wild first period in which Vegas took a three-goal lead only for San Jose to tie before the period ended, Mark Stone's power-play goal in the second period would be the game-winner for the Golden Knights, defeating the Sharks 5–3. Stone continued his scoring into game three, adding a hat trick into Vegas' 6–3 victory. In game four, Max Pacioretty had two goals and two assists while goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury stopped all 28 shots granting Vegas a 5–0 victory and a 3–1 series lead.

In game six, the Sharks evened the series with a double-overtime short-handed goal by Tomas Hertl, backstopped by Martin Jones who made 58 saves in a 2–1 victory. In the seventh game, after taking a three-goal lead, in the third period, Vegas' Cody Eakin was assessed a controversial major penalty and game misconduct as a result of a play that injured Sharks forward Joe Pavelski. The Sharks took the lead 4–3 after scoring four unanswered goals on the ensuing five-minute power play. However, the Golden Knights tied the game with 47 seconds left in regulation, sending the game into overtime. At 18:19 of the first overtime, Barclay Goodrow scored the series-winning goal for the Sharks, coming back from a 3–1 series deficit and defeating the Golden Knights 5–4. The NHL later apologized to the Golden Knights for the call on Eakin, and the two referees working the game were suspended for the remainder of the playoffs. The Sharks became just the second team in NHL history, along with the 2013 Boston Bruins, to overcome a three-goal deficit in the third period of a seventh game.\nSecond round.\nEastern Conference second round.\n(A2) Boston Bruins vs. (WC2) Columbus Blue Jackets.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.

In game two, Warren Foegele and Nino Niederreiter scored 48 seconds apart in the third period to take the lead 2–1 giving Carolina the victory. In the second period of game two, Petr Mrazek was injured, leading to Curtis McElhinney replacing him in net for the remainder of the series; as a result McElhinney, at 35 years old, became the oldest goaltender in NHL history to make his first career playoff start in game three. Teuvo Teravainen scored twice in game three to give the Hurricanes a 5–2 victory and a 3–0 series lead. Teravainen continued his scoring into game four, notching a goal and an assist in Carolina's 5–2 victory. This was the Hurricanes' first four-game series sweep in franchise history and the franchise's first sweep since the Hartford Whalers swept the Quebec Nordiques in three games during the 1986 Adams Division semifinals. In addition, the Islanders were swept in a playoff series for the first time since the 1994 Eastern Conference quarterfinals against the New York Rangers.

The teams' last appearance in the conference finals was against each other in 2016, which San Jose won in six games. San Jose won two of the three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Blues defeated the Sharks in six games. In game one, Logan Couture and Timo Meier both scored twice in the Sharks' 6–3 victory. Although Couture scored twice in game two, the Blues edged the Sharks 4–2. In game three, controversy struck in overtime as Meier swatted at the puck with his glove towards Erik Karlsson who scored in overtime. The NHL later admitted the refs missed the hand pass Meier committed. The Blues were undeterred by this blatant non-call as goalie Jordan Binnington made 29 saves in game four en route to a 2–1 victory. In game five, Jaden Schwartz scored a hat trick and Binnington stopped all 21 shots he faced for the Blues in a 5–0 victory. The Blues shut down the Sharks in game six, scoring five goals in a 5–1 victory and advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals and ending its 49-year appearance drought.

They last met in the 1972 Stanley Cup semifinals which Boston won in a four-game sweep. St. Louis made their fourth appearance in the Finals. They last advanced to the Finals in 1970, which they lost in four games to the Boston Bruins. Boston made their twentieth Finals appearance.

This is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played. The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded.\nTelevision.\nThis was the eighth postseason under NBC Sports' current 10-year contract for American television rights to the NHL. All national coverage of games are being aired on either NBCSN, the NBC broadcast network, NHL Network, USA Network, or CNBC. During the first round, excluding games exclusively broadcast on NBC, the regional rights holders of each participating U.S. team will produce local telecasts of their respective games. For the third year, the first round national broadcasts were not blacked out on television in the markets of participating teams, and could co-exist with the local broadcasts (however, NBC-provided coverage was restricted in Pittsburgh and Las Vegas, where AT&amp;T SportsNet held the regional rights to the Penguins and the Golden Knights respectively).\nIn Canada, for the fifth postseason under Rogers Media's current 12-year contract, coverage was broadcast in English by Sportsnet and CBC under the \"Hockey Night in Canada\" brand, and streamed on Sportsnet Now, CBCSports.ca (for games televised by CBC), or the subscription service Rogers NHL Live.\nIn French, all games were aired by TVA Sports. Availability of the games were initially hampered by a major carriage dispute between Bell Satellite TV and the channel's owner, Quebecor Media, over a proposed increase in carriage fees which Bell considered poorly-justified. On April 10, 2019, Quebecor pulled TVA Sports from Bell Satellite TV, despite it being illegal in Canada for channels to be pulled by their owners at a \"standstill\" in carriage negotiations. Bell publicly condemned the action, and stated it would offer the Sportsnet networks as a free preview to affected subscribers for the duration of the dispute, so that viewers still have access to the English-language broadcasts. On April 12, 2019, the channels were restored per a court injunction granted to Bell. The CRTC has since warned that any attempt to pull the channel again would result in a suspension of its license until access is restored.\nIn the United States, NBC reported that the first round saw its highest cable viewership since 1994 and the highest overall ratings since 2012. Game seven of the Capitals–Hurricanes series was the most-watched first round game on cable since 2000."

        "text": "This is a list of individual male winners in FIS Cross-Country World Cup from 1982 season to present. The list includes distance races, sprints and stage events as well as the distance and sprint stages of the stage events. Distance races have been part of the World Cup ever since its formation. Sprint discipline was first introduced in 1995/96 World Cup season and stage events are first introduced in 2006/07 World Cup season. World Championship and Olympic races were counted as World Cup races until the 1999 World Championships and the 1994 Winter Olympics.\nHistory.\nIn 43 official World Cup seasons, as of 16 March 2024, 923 individual races (626 distance, 257 sprint, 40 stage events) for men were held. These events saw 924 winners, because one race (individual 15 km classic race on 3 February 2007) ended with a tie.\nA total of 165 male cross-country skier from 19 nations have won at least one individual race. In this list Soviet Union and Russia listed separately but counted as one nation. West Germany and Germany listed together since there is no East German winner and the only West German winner Jochen Behle continued his career for Germany after the German reunification in 1990. The first winner was the Norwegian Pål Gunnar Mikkelsplass who won the 15 km individual race in Reit im Winkl on 9 January 1982. The newest member of the list is Gus Schumacher who won the 10 km freestyle individual race in Minneapolis on 18 February 2024.\nWith 83 World Cup victories, Norwegian Johannes Høsflot Klæbo is the most successful World Cup racer in the history. Among those, 49 wins have come in sprint races which makes him also the best male World Cup sprinter of all-time. The previous record holder Bjørn Dæhlie, has won 45 of his 46 victories in distance races and he is the best distance skier in World Cup history. In stage events, which is the newest individual race format, Klæbo shares the top spot with another Norwegian Martin Johnsrud Sundby at 8 victories.\nPål Gunnar Mikkelsplass was also the first skier to win races in two and three different seasons as he won the opening races of the first two official World Cup seasons (1981/82, 1982/83) and the 1984/85 season. The Kazakh Vladimir Smirnov and the Norwegian Petter Northug won races in 11 different seasons, but Northug has won races in 11 consecutive seasons and he is still only skier to do so. Gunde Svan was the first skier to win a race in four, five, six, seven, eight and nine seasons and all these seasons were consecutive. Throughout his 9-season long career, Svan managed to win at least one race in every season he competed. Bjørn Dæhlie has won races for 10 consecutive seasons from 1989/90 to 1998/99 which made him the only skier who won a race in every year in a single decade. Smirnov was the first to win races in ten and eleven seasons, while Dæhlie was the first to win in ten consecutive seasons and Northug was the first and the only skier to win in eleven consecutive seasons.\nThe youngest male winner is Petter Northug (born 6 January 1986) who won the 20 km pursuit race in Falun on 8 March 2006 at the age of 20 years and 61 days. The oldest winner is Harri Kirvesniemi (born 10 May 1958) who was aged 41 years 306 days when he won the prestigious 50 km classical mass start race in Oslo Holmenkollen on 11 March 2000, 17 years 358 days after his first race victory in Štrbské Pleso on 19 March 1982, which is also the longest time between the first and the last victory in the World Cup. The oldest skier to win his first race was Giorgio Di Centa (born 7 October 1972). When he won the 15 km individual freestyle race in Canmore on 5 February 2010 which was his only career victory, he was aged 37 years and 121 days.\nMikhail Devyatyarov and Mikhail Devyatyarov Jr. are the first father and son pair to win a World Cup race. They are followed by the Canadians Pierre and Alex Harvey. Apart from father-son pairs, there are two different brother pairs won a World Cup race: Mathias and Thobias Fredriksson of Sweden and Petter and Tomas Northug of Norway. From these two, the Fredriksson brothers were the first to do so. During the 2002/03 season, three consecutive World Cup races were won by Fredriksson brothers (two for Mathias and one for Thobias) which was also followed by the Northug brothers who became the winner of two consecutive races in the 2014/15 World Cup season after the victory in 2015 Tour de Ski was given to Petter Northug on 20 July 2016 due to illegal use of asthma medication by the initial winner Martin Johnsrud Sundby."

Only a few of Canada's and the U.S.'s losses have been to teams outside their rivalry. \nCanada currently leads the head-to-head with 103 Canadian wins vs 78 American wins. Canada also leads in Gold medals with 31 vs 21 for the Americans.\nHistory.\nAfter an American victory over Canada at the 1998 Nagano Olympics, the Canadian Olympic team won the next four gold medals over the U.S. (the exception being 2006 where Canada defeated Sweden for gold and U.S. defeated Finland for bronze) until 2018, when the U.S. ended a 20-year gold medal drought defeating Canada in a shootout. Canada once again claimed Olympic gold over the U.S. at the 2022 Olympics.\nHowever, at the World Championships, Canada won the first 8 straight gold medals from 1990 to 2004. From 2005 to 2019 the U.S. has dominated winning 9 of the 11 World Championships, defeating Canada eight times (the exception being 2019 where the U.S. won gold defeating Finland, who upset Canada in their semi-final match). Since 2020, Canada has won 3 of the last 4.\nAt the 4 Nations Cup, Canada and the U.S. have faced each other in every gold medal game (except 2001 when the U.S. withdrew due to the September 11 attacks and 2013 where Canada won gold defeating Finland and the U.S. won bronze defeating Sweden). Between 1996 and 2010, Canada won 12 of 15 and from 2011 to 2018, the U.S. won 6 of the 8. The tournament has not been played since the 2018 edition.\nThe longest Gold medal streak is tied at 9. The Canadian streak lasting from 1998 to 2002, was broken by U.S.'s Gold at the 2003 4 Nations Cup. The American streak lasting from 2015 to 2019, was broken by Canada's Gold at the 2021 World Championship.

The defending champions of the Big Sky Conference, Vandals were led by fourth-year head coach Don Monson and played their home games on campus at the Kibbie Dome in Moscow, Idaho.\nThe 1982 basketball team was the most successful in the school's history, and has yet to be surpassed. Building upon the success of the previous season (25–4), the Vandals won their first sixteen games and went 24–2 in the regular season. They defeated Gonzaga and all four Pac-10 teams from the Northwest. Idaho won the eight-team Far West Classic in Portland in late December 1981, winning all three games by at least 19 points (over Iowa State, Oregon State, and Oregon).\nThe Vandals' only setbacks during the regular season were consecutive two-point road losses in late January. The first was to rival Montana on a raucous Saturday night in Missoula on a tip-in at the buzzer. The second was to Notre Dame in South Bend two days later, ending a three-games-in-four-nights road trip, which included multiple weather-related travel delays and re-routes, and a 4:30 am arrival in South Bend on game day. Although the Vandals hit 14 of their first 15 shots to jump to lead over the Irish, Notre Dame regrouped at home to win by two in overtime. Idaho was awarded just four free throws in the 45 minutes of play and missed them all. Notre Dame was led by future NBA guard John Paxson in 1982. The Vandals then won eight straight games to conclude the regular season, and won the four-team conference tournament, which they hosted for the second straight year as regular season champions.\nTheir 26–2 record after the Big Sky tournament (&amp; ten straight victories) earned the Vandals a #8 national ranking and a #3 seed in the West region of the 48-team NCAA tournament, which included a first round bye.\nNCAA tournament.\nIdaho's first game (in the second round) was nearly a home game, played just west at Beasley Coliseum in Pullman on a Sunday afternoon. The opponent was 16th-ranked Iowa of the Big Ten, the region's sixth seed, then coached by Lute Olson. A Final Four team two years earlier, Iowa won their first-round game handily, but Idaho won this close game by two points, in overtime, and advanced to the Sweet 16. \nFour days later at the West regional in Provo, Utah, they met the nation's fourth-ranked team, Oregon State, the #2 seed in the West region. Idaho had defeated the Beavers by 22 points in December at the Far West Classic in Portland, but this time the result was far different, as the Beavers won 60–42. OSU was defeated two days later by the region's #1 seed Georgetown, led by freshman center Patrick Ewing. (Georgetown advanced to the national final, where they lost by a point to North Carolina.)\nAftermath.\nThe Vandals ended the 1982 season at , and were ranked as high as sixth in the nation (AP and UPI polls) at the end of the regular season They entered the top twenty at #18 in early January and two weeks later were up to eighth, but the two losses dropped them back to fifteenth. Eight straight wins elevated them to sixth prior to the Big Sky tournament, and were eighth in both final polls entering the NCAA tournament.\nThe 1982 starters Ken Owens () and Brian Kellerman () in the backcourt, with forwards Phil Hopson and Gordie Herbert and center Kelvin Smith, all at . Just before their two losses in January, the team was featured in a two-page article in \"Sports Illustrated\".

That position was eventually filled by Lute Olson (a year later), and Monson chose to stay for a fifth season at Idaho. With a salary of about $40,000 in 1982 and a one-year contract, an \"appreciation fund\" was set up by local fans to entice him to stay in The 1982 team was inducted into the Vandal Athletics Hall of Fame, as was Monson, Kellerman, and Owens.\nAll-conference.\nAll five starters were recognized by the conference. Senior point guard Owens was the Big Sky's player of the year and a repeat MVP in the conference tournament. He was joined in the backcourt of the all-conference team by junior guard Kellerman, the previous season's player of the year.

        "text": "Connor James McGovern (born November 3, 1997) is an American football guard for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round of the 2019 NFL Draft. He played college football at Penn State.\nEarly years.\nMcGovern attended Lake-Lehman High School. He received Wyoming Valley Football Conference first-team All-League honors in 2013, 2014 and 2015. He was named the Wyoming Valley Football Conference Most Valuable Player and first-team All-state as a senior.\nAlso practiced basketball and track. He received All-conference honors in basketball as a junior. He was the District 2 shot put champion as a senior in 2015. He also set school strength records in bench press, power clean, squat and deadlift.\nCollege career.\nMcGovern accepted a football scholarship from Penn State University. As a true freshman, he started nine out of 13 games playing at right guard. He was named the Big Ten Freshman of the week during week 10 of his freshman season, and became the first offensive lineman to receive the honor. He also became the third Big Ten offensive lineman to receive any player of the week award since Penn State joined the conference, after Korey Stringer of Ohio State and Sean Poole of Michigan State.\nAs a sophomore, McGovern was moved from guard to the center position, starting all 13 games. As a junior, he started 12 games at right guard and one at center.\nOn January 2, 2019, McGovern announced that he would forgo his final year of eligibility and declare for the 2019 NFL Draft.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nMcGovern was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (90th overall) of the 2019 NFL Draft. He missed all of the preseason with a torn pectoral muscle. He was placed on the injured reserve list on September 1.\nIn 2020, he began the season as a backup guard behind Zack Martin and Connor Williams. In the sixth game against the Arizona Cardinals, Martin left the game with a concussion after a handful of snaps, and McGovern replaced him at right offensive guard. He would make his first career start in the next game against the Washington Football Team, while Martin recovered. Martin was later moved to right tackle in the tenth game against the Minnesota Vikings to help stabilize the offensive line performance, and McGovern was named the starter at right guard. He would remain in that role for the rest of the season, after Martin suffered a calf injury in the eleventh game against the Washington Football Team. He got his first start at fullback in the regular-season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles, he also played some snaps at guard and on special teams.\nIn 2021, he started the season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at right guard in place of Martin, who was placed on the Reserve/COVID-19 list. To get him more involved on game day, although he is a natural guard, he lined up as a fullback and blocking tight end under certain packages from offensive coordinator Kellen Moore. In Week 11 against the Kansas City Chiefs, he was named the starting left guard over Connor Williams, who at the time was leading the league in penalties. He struggled in that game against defensive tackle Chris Jones, who registered 3.5 sacks. Williams regained his starting position in Week 15 against the New York Giants. In the five games that McGovern started at guard (four at left guard and one at right guard), the Cowboys had a 2-3 record.\nIn 2022, he split time with rookie Tyler Smith, working at left guard with the first-team offense in organized team activities and training camp. He started at center in the third preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks. He was named the starter at left guard for the season opener, after left tackle Tyron Smith was placed on the injured reserve list and the offensive line had to adjust to the loss. He suffered a high ankle sprain seven plays into the game and was replaced with Matt Farniok. He missed the following two games with the injury. In Week 17 against the Tennessee Titans, he started at center in the absence of Tyler Biadasz. He started 15 games, mostly at left guard, while surrendering just two sacks and one penalty.\nBuffalo Bills.\nOn March 16, 2023, McGovern signed a three-year contract with the Buffalo Bills."

        "text": "The England cricket team toured the West Indies between January and March 2019 to play three Tests, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The series included England's first Test match in Saint Lucia, when they played at the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground. It was also England's first tour to the West Indies to play all three formats of international cricket since they visited in 2009. The ODI fixtures were part of both teams' preparation for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.\nThe West Indies won the first two Test matches, taking an unassailable lead in the series, and therefore winning the Wisden Trophy. It was their first Test series win against England since 2009. However, the West Indies captain Jason Holder was suspended for the third and final Test of the series, after the team's slow over-rate in the second Test. Kraigg Brathwaite was named as the West Indies' captain for the third Test in Holder's place. The West Indies won the series 2–1, after England won the third Test by 232 runs.\nDuring the ODI series, multiple individual and team records were broken by both sides. England's captain Eoin Morgan became the first batsman for the England team to score 6,000 runs in ODIs. Chris Gayle became the second batsman for the West Indies, after Brian Lara, to score 10,000 runs in ODIs. The ODI series was drawn 2–2, after the third match was washed out, finishing as a no result.\nFor the T20I series, the West Indies retained players that were selected for the ODI matches, with Jason Holder named as the T20I captain in place of their regular T20I captain Carlos Brathwaite. During the second match, the West Indies were bowled out for 45, which was the second-lowest total in T20Is and the lowest by a Full Member nation.

Conversely, Bangladesh's wicket-keeper batsman Mushfiqur Rahim said it would be ideal preparation ahead of the World Cup, with New Zealand having conditions similar to those in England.\nNew Zealand won the ODI series 3–0, their fourth-consecutive whitewash in a bilateral ODI series at home against Bangladesh.

Mahmudullah was named as the captain of Bangladesh's team for the first and second Tests. Shakib was eventually ruled out of the third Test. Kane Williamson was ruled out of New Zealand's squad for the third and final Test, with Tim Southee named as captain in his place.\nHowever, the third Test was called off a day before the scheduled start of the match of 15 March 2019, due to the Christchurch mosque shootings. The Bangladesh team were on their way to one of the mosques in Christchurch for Friday prayers, but the team were able to escape to Hagley Oval.

In May 2018, the PCB invited New Zealand to play the fixtures in Pakistan. In June 2018, the PCB and the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) agreed to play Pakistan's future matches in the UAE. In July 2018, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) confirmed that they had declined the PCB's offer to play the T20I fixtures in Pakistan because of security concerns. Therefore, all the matches on the tour took place in the UAE as scheduled.\nPakistan won the T20I series 3–0, setting a new record for the most consecutive series wins in T20Is, with eleven. The ODI series was drawn 1–1, after the third match finished as a no result due to rain.\nDuring the third Test, Pakistan's Mohammad Hafeez announced that he would retire from Test cricket following the conclusion of the match, to focus on limited-overs cricket. Hafeez said that the time was right to retire from Test cricket and that he was honoured to represent Pakistan in 55 Test matches, including captaining the side. In the same match, Pakistan's Yasir Shah set a new record for the fastest bowler to take 200 wickets in Tests. He achieved it in his 33rd Test, breaking an 82-year old record that was set by Clarrie Grimmett of Australia, who took his 200th wicket in his 36th match. New Zealand went on to win the Test series 2–1. It was New Zealand's first away Test series win against Pakistan since 1969.\nSquads.\nAhead of the tour, Martin Guptill was ruled out of New Zealand's ODI and T20I squads with a calf injury. Corey Anderson, Glenn Phillips and Ajaz Patel were added to New Zealand's T20I squad before the start of the tour.

        "text": "The Oak Island Golf Club (OIGC) is located in Caswell Beach NC on the south side of Oak Island looking out at the Atlantic Ocean. Part of the Lower Cape Fear region in Brunswick County, Southeast North Carolina, it is one of the few 18 holes golf courses built on a barrier island. The privately owned 6,720 yard, par 72 course is open to the public and has 37 bunkers with water in play on 11 holes. Laid out with five sets of tees which present a wide range of playability, the back (blue) tees are course rated at 73.1 with a slope of 139. A pro shop/pub/snack bar along with a full practice facility to include a sand trap, both putting and pitching greens, and a driving range is also available to the public. \nHistory.\nThe first nine holes were completed in 1962 while the second nine opened to the public in 1975. The course architect, George Cobb (1914-1986), in addition to being the co-designer of Augusta National's par 3 course, is also the architect for over 100 other courses in the southeast US to include East Lake in Atlanta GA, Quail Hollow in Charlotte NC and Sea Pines in Hilton Head SC. The Oak Island layout features ultra-dwarf TifEagle greens and Bermuda tees/fairways/rough with Long Leaf Pine, Live Oak and Yaupon Holly trees bordering most every fairway. In December 2017, the original 1962 clubhouse/restaurant was torn down and a new facility built which opened in December 2019.\nGolf Events.\nTournaments are held year round with the most popular ones being a mixed scramble event on Super Bowl Sunday, the Superintendent’s Revenge in late winter where the course is set up with no concern for the rules of golf and pin positions are unbelievably difficult, the Southport-Oak Island Classic captain's choice event sponsored by the local Chamber of Commerce in the spring which includes a \"Putt for Green\" competition, the annual Battle of the Beaches where all the neighboring communities compete against each other in a team event, the Club Championship in late August which also includes a senior and super-senior competition, and the weekend Member-Guest tournament in October.\nGolf Associations.\nThe Linksters men's group dates back to 1986 and holds monthly tournaments on Saturdays where individuals and two or four man teams compete in best ball, scramble or total score events. There is also a match play elimination tournament held during the spring/summer and a mixed couples putting contest on a Sunday afternoon in September followed by a banquet. The December monthly competition includes a post event luncheon where awards are presented, the highlight of which is the Joe O’Brien Cup (former Town Mayor) presentation to the golfer of the year.\nIts counterpart, the Oak Island Women’s Golf Association (OIWGA) is an equally active group that conducts year-round weekday (Wednesday) and weekend (Saturday) morning competitions. Tournaments held during the year include the mixed couple Sadie Hawkins Day contest in March, the Member-Member team event in April and the two day Women’s Championship Stroke Play competition in September. A combined Linkster/OIGWA team event is held in October while the final event of the year in December is followed by an awards luncheon.\nCourse Environs.\nCarved out of a maritime forest, the course is built through four residential communities: single family homes in Oak Island Estates bordering holes 10-16; another single family development, the Arboretum \nlocated between holes 1–2 and 16–18; the Ocean Greens mixed townhouse, condo and duplex community surrounding holes 3-7; and Caswell Dunes, a mixed condo and patio home development alongside holes 5-9."

        "text": "The 2016 Swedish Men's Handball Championship final () was a handball match that took place at Malmö Arena in Malmö on 22 May 2016 to decide the winner of the 2015–16 Elitserien. The match was contested by IFK Kristianstad and Alingsås HK. Kristianstad won the match by 27–18 to win their second consecutive Swedish title.\nBackground.\nThe match was contested by the champions of the two previous seasons, with Kristianstad having won the title in 2015 and Alingsås in 2014. Kristianstad had won the regular season, 16 points ahead of second placed Alingsås (2 points for a win). Kristianstad won both matches between the teams in the regular season, winning 34–26 at home and 28–27 away. The teams had previously faced each other in the quarter-finals in 2012 and 2013 and in the final in 2015, with Kristianstad winning each time. It was the fourth time that Malmö Arena hosted the final, following 2010, 2012 and 2014.\nRoad to the final.\nKristianstad were undefeated in the playoffs going into the final, having swept Redbergslids IK and IK Sävehof in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively. Alingsås HK defeated Eskilstuna Guif by 3–1 in the quarter-final series and swept Ystads IF in the semi-finals.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nKristianstad dominated the match from the start and took the lead by 7–2. The following period was relatively close and Kristianstad extended their lead by a single goal to 11–5. Kristianstad finished the first half as well as they had started it, and led by 18–6 at half-time. Alingsås were better at the start of the second half and reduced the deficit to 19–12, thanks in part to several counter-attack goals. However, they never got closer than 7 goals in the second half as Kristianstad extended their lead to 23–14. Kristianstad maintained the lead and won by 27–18. Kristianstad's Iman Jamali was the top scorer of the match at 8 goals. Andreas Flodman scored the most goals for Alingsås, 5.\nReactions.\nKristianstad coach Ola Lindgren said after the match: \"The first half is the best one we've played this season. (...) I couldn't have dreamt of a twelve-goal lead at half-time.\" Alingsås coach Mikael Franzén criticised himself after the match, saying \"obviously I have a big part in us being so battered. We all have a part in it, obviously.\" Alingsås player Fredrik Teern said that their defence was \"insecure\" and \"out of sync\" and that they did not get close enough to Kristianstad's shooters. In particular he believed they gave Jamali too much space. Sveriges Radio pundit and former player Magnus Wislander said that \"it is adult men who play against little boys. Kristianstad are outstanding in Swedish handball\"."

Amenities in the community included a train depot, schoolhouse, and country store.\nU.S. President Jimmy Carter grew up at Archery on his family's farm from age four, in 1928, until he left for college in 1941. In Carter's time, the population consisted of approximately 25 black families and two white families, namely the Watsons and Carters. President Carter recalled in 1976 that Bishop Johnson was \"the best-educated, most famous, the most widely traveled, and the richest member of the community\". The Carter family remained at Archery until 1949; ownership of the Carter property was transferred to the National Park Service in 1994.\nArts and culture.\nThe Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm, open to visitors, has been restored to its original rustic appearance. SAM Shortline Railway, a heritage railway open to the public, makes a stop on its route at the Archery Depot where visitors lead a self-guided tour."

        "text": "The United States national beach handball team (USA Beach Handball) is the national team of the United States. It is governed by USA Team Handball and takes part in international beach handball competitions.\nRestart of the program in 2015.\nIn May 2015, USA Team Handball officially decided to start an international beach handball program under the direction of former Olympic USA Team Handball player and coach Dennis Burkholtz. On the day the program was announced, former USA National Team player for indoor handball Mike Hinson, approached Dennis about starting a program and coaching a team based out of Southern California. Coach Hinson, having played beach handball for 14 years, knew about beach handball and believed the United States could put together a team that could compete at the highest level pretty quickly. In September 2015, USA Team Handball announced Mike Hinson as the head coach of the USA Men Beach Handball Team. Based out of Hermosa Beach California, Coach Hinson began recruiting athletes from all different athletic backgrounds. He brought in a former 2012 Olympic goalie from USA Water Polo, a Dodgeball World Champion, several current and former USA Team Handball players, a former Division 1 Quarterback, a former division 1 Basketball Center and a current collegiate Lacrosse player, among others.\nIn March 2016 the USA Men went down to Venezuela in their first ever competition in the new formation. The top two teams from the tournament would advance to the World Championships. The tournament featured several high level programs with experienced players. Starting the tournament off 1-3 they were in a must win against Ecuador to advance to the medal round. This is where the US team was truly born. The defense held Ecuador scoreless for the first 6 minutes of the match and defeated them in two sets. Next they faced the undefeated #1 seed and host country Venezuela who was ranked #7 in the world in the semi-finals. Splitting the sets 1-1, the US won on the last shot in shootout to advance to the gold medal game. Facing defending Pan American Championship Silver medalists Uruguay they once again split sets 1-1 and again won on the last shot in shootout to claim the Gold Medal.\nBy winning the Pan American Championships, the USA men team qualified into the 12 team field of the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary. Being their first World Championships the international expectations were not high for any success. In the first game of the tournament, the USA Team shocked the international handball world by defeating the #5 team in the world, Ukraine in straight sets. Needing one more win in the next 4 games to qualify into the top 6, USA fell just short against defending World Champion Brazil, lost a close game against defending bronze medalist Qatar, then lost 2 extremely tight shootouts against Egypt and Bahrain. Finishing out of the medal rounds, USA then lost a close shootout to Oman and finished the tournament with an emotional win against Australia in the rain.\nAfter the success of the men's team in Venezuela, former assistant Coach for the men's team Juliano de Oliveira was announced head coach of the newly formed USA Women Beach Handball Team. With that announcement the women's program relocated from Miami, Florida to Hermosa Beach to have both programs benefit from the conditions in California. By recruiting current players of the USA Team Handball Women National Team and the local Los Angeles Team Handball Club Coach Juliano formed the core of the team that would go on to compete in the 2018 Pan American Beach Handball Championship."

Some of them were born to Spanish parents abroad, some moved to Spain at a young age, and some others were \"naturalized\" or acquired citizenship after playing professionally in a Spanish club.\nUp to 4 players born in Latin America were in the Spanish squad for the first EuroBasket in 1935, where Spain won the silver medal: brothers Emilio and Pedro Alonso, Rafael Martín and Rafael Ruano. Two Americans were a key factor in the modernization of the sport in Spain in the late 60s and the 70s, Wayne Brabender and Clifford Luyk, with the silver medal at the 1973 EuroBasket as their highest success. Two more Latin Americans were included in the 1980s, Argentinian Juan Domingo de la Cruz and Dominican Chicho Sibilio.\nModern FIBA regulations about the Eligibility and National Status of Players limit the number of naturalized players to one per squad:\"A national team participating in a Competition of FIBA may have only one player on its team who has acquired the legal nationality of that country by naturalisation or by any other means after having reached the age of sixteen\" (Book 3, Chapter 1, Article 21.a)In recent years, this regulation on a team's roster has avoided the inclusion of Serge Ibaka and Nikola Mirotić at the same time \nList of players.\n\"Note: list updated to senior team call-up in September 2019.

        "text": "Bruce Brown Jr. (born August 15, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Miami Hurricanes and was selected 42nd overall by the Detroit Pistons in the 2018 NBA draft. He has also played for the Brooklyn Nets, Denver Nuggets, and Indiana Pacers. In 2023, he was a key member of the Nuggets' championship team. Despite being undersized, Brown plays the small forward and both guard positions.\nHigh school career.\nBrown played basketball and football for Wakefield Memorial High School in Wakefield, Massachusetts. For his junior season, he transferred to Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, Vermont. As a senior, Brown led his team to the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council Class AA title and was named tournament most valuable player. He was selected to play in the 2016 Jordan Brand Classic. Brown was considered a five-star recruit by 247Sports and ESPN and a four-star recruit by Rivals. Brown was ranked no. 26 overall recruit and fifth best shooting guard in the 2016 high school class. On November 18, 2015, he committed to play college basketball for the Miami Hurricanes over an offer from Indiana, among others.\nCollege career.\nAs a sophomore with the Miami Hurricanes, Brown averaged 11.4 points, 7.1 rebounds, and four assists per game and shot 27 percent from 3-point range. He only played 19 games and missed the postseason with a left foot injury that required surgery. After the season Brown declared for the 2018 NBA draft but did not hire an agent, thereby allowing for the possibility of returning to college. He ultimately decided to stay in the draft.\nProfessional career.\nDetroit Pistons (2018–2020).\nOn June 21, 2018, Brown was drafted 42nd overall by the Detroit Pistons in the 2018 NBA draft. Brown made his NBA debut on October 17, 2018, against the Brooklyn Nets, scoring no points with two rebounds and an assist in 19 minutes of action. On November 2, 2019, he posted 22 points and seven assists, with no turnovers, in a 113–109 win over the Nets. On February 2, 2020, Brown recorded 19 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in a 128–123 overtime victory over the Denver Nuggets.\nBrooklyn Nets (2020–2022).\nOn November 19, 2020, Brown was traded to the Brooklyn Nets in a three-team trade.\nOn February 23, 2021, Brown scored a career-high 29 points in the Nets' 127–118 win against the Sacramento Kings.\nOn April 23, 2022, he scored a team leading 26 points for the Nets in a losing effort against the Celtics in the first round of the NBA playoffs. The Nets fell to 0–3 after that game. His performance in Games 2 and 3 were notably impressive, as he scored 23 or more points in both contests, despite eclipsing 20 points only 4 times throughout the entire regular season.\nDenver Nuggets (2022–2023).\nOn July 7, 2022, Brown signed with the Denver Nuggets. Brown signed a 2-year contract worth $13 million. The Nets had chosen not to match the Nuggets' taxpayer mid-level exception offer for Brown and acquired Royce O'Neale as a replacement instead. On November 23, Brown recorded a triple-double with 17 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 assists during a win against the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nIn 2023, Brown and the Nuggets reached the NBA Finals where they defeated the Miami Heat in five games to give Brown his first NBA Championship. In Game 4 of the series, Brown scored a pivotal 21 points, including 11 in the fourth quarter, to help Denver open up a 3–1 series lead with a 108–95 victory over the Heat. In Game 5, Brown scored the winning points on a layup off an offensive rebound with just over ninety seconds left in the game, and hit two free throws to make it a two-possession game with less than thirty seconds remaining as the Nuggets defeated Miami 94–89 to win their first championship in franchise history after a 47-year drought.\nIndiana Pacers (2023–2024).\nOn July 6, 2023, Brown signed a 2-year, $45 million contract with the Indiana Pacers. Brown saw an increased role in Indiana, earning a starting position as the highest paid Pacer for the 2023–24 season. On October 25, 2023, Brown impressed in his Pacers debut, scoring 24 points on a career-high 6 of 8 shooting from three, along with 3 rebounds and a steal in a win over the Washington Wizards.\nToronto Raptors (2024–present).\nOn January 17, 2024, the Pacers traded Brown, along with Jordan Nwora, Kira Lewis Jr. and three first-round draft picks to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Pascal Siakam."

        "text": "The Swedish ice hockey champions () is a title awarded annually to the winning playoff team of the top-tier ice hockey league in Sweden, which currently is Swedish Hockey League (SHL). It was first awarded to IK Göta in 1922, the championship's inaugural year. The championship's present SHL format did not take into effect until the league was originally formed for the 1975–76 season under the name of Elitserien. A team who wins the Swedish Championship is awarded the Le Mat Trophy. Djurgårdens IF holds the most titles in history with 16 titles. The most recent Swedish Champions are Frölunda HC, who won their fourth title in club history in 2016.\nBefore 1953, the Swedish champions were determined through a standalone tournament, the Swedish Ice Hockey Championship, where teams could submit their participation. In other words, the leagues were not connected with the Swedish Championship during this period. Between 1953 and 1955, the winner was decided through matches between the winners of Division 1 Norra and Division 1 Södra. From 1956 to 1965, the Swedish champions was the winner of a second round group stage following Division 1. In the years of 1966 and 1967 a play-off was played between Division 1 teams and the 1968 season saw a return to second round group stage. In the 1975–76 season, Elitserien was started and the winner of Elitserien (later SHL) play-off became Swedish ice hockey champion.\nLars Björn and Tord Lundström have the most titles, with nine each.\nBelow is a list of the players awarded medals."

UNLV, PCAA tournament runners-up, were also included in the NCAA field.\nFormat.\nThe tournament field remained the same as 1983, with eight total teams, despite the addition of one new team (New Mexico State, from the Missouri Valley) to the PCAA. Instead, only the top eight teams, out of ten, from the regular season standings qualified for the conference tournament.\nAll eight teams were placed into the first round, with teams seeded and paired based on regular-season records. After the first round, teams were re-seeded so the highest-remaining team was paired with the lowest-remaining time in one semifinal with the other two teams slotted into the other semifinal."

        "text": "John A. Gilmour (born May 17, 1993) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who is currently playing for Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL).\nPlaying career.\nPrior to joining Providence College, Gilmour played in the United States Hockey League for the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders and Gilmour Academy. It was while he was playing for the Roughriders that Gilmour committed to play NCAA Division 1 hockey for Providence College.\nGilmour was drafted 198th overall in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft by the Calgary Flames. The Flames did not offer him a contract and he continued playing for Providence College.\nOn August 18, 2016, Gilmour signed a two-year, $1.85 million entry-level contract with the New York Rangers. Gilmour spent the first half of the season in the AHL, and was named to the 2018 AHL all-star game. He made his NHL debut in a 4–3 win over the Flames on February 9, 2018. Gilmour recorded his first NHL goal on February 13, 2018, in a 3–2 loss to the Minnesota Wild. Gilmour became the first New York Rangers rookie defenseman to score an overtime goal when he scored a goal 1:22 into overtime on February 28, 2018, against the Vancouver Canucks.\nWhile attending the Rangers training camp, Gilmour was reassigned to the Hartford Wolf Pack to begin the 2018–19 season. During the season, Gilmour set a Wolf Pack franchise record for goals by a defenseman in a season with 20, and was named an AHL All-star for the second consecutive season.\nOn July 1, 2019, Gilmour left the Rangers as a free agent to sign a one-year, one-way $700,000 contract with the Buffalo Sabres. He began the 2019–20 season, with the Sabres as a healthy scratch before he was assigned on a conditioning stint to AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans. He appeared in 4 games with the Sabres, going scoreless.\nAs a free agent from the Sabres, and with the 2020–21 North American season delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Gilmour belatedly signed a contract abroad in agreeing to a one-year deal with Russian club, HC CSKA Moscow of the KHL, on December 14, 2020.\nFollowing two seasons with CSKA, culminating in capturing the Gagarin Cup, Gilmour left as a free agent and was signed to a two-year contract to continue in the KHL with Belarusian club, HC Dinamo Minsk, on July 24, 2022.\nFollowing one season with Dinamo, Gilmour was released from his contract and moved to Germany in signing a two-year contract with Adler Mannheim of the DEL, on April 21, 2023.

He played college football for California before being selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.\nProfessional career.\nRomero was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft with the 192nd overall pick, seven spots ahead of the New England Patriots' pick of quarterback Tom Brady. The 192nd pick was originally sent to the Eagles from the Washington Redskins in exchange for Rodney Peete on April 28, 1999. In July 2000, Romero signed a three-year contract with the Eagles for $875,000 with a $50,000 signing bonus. After originally making the Eagles' final 53-man roster, he was waived the next day to make room for center Hank Fraley, whom the Eagles claimed off waivers from the Pittsburgh Steelers. Romero spent the entire 2000 season on the Eagles' practice squad. He was re-signed to a two-year contract on February 6, 2001, before tearing a pectoral muscle in May 2001. He returned to training camp practice on August 16, but was waived by the team on August 25. Romero tried out for the Cincinnati Bengals and Buffalo Bills on October 3, 2001, and the Bills signed him to their practice squad the same day, where he spent the rest of the 2001 season. The New Orleans Saints signed Romero to a futures contract on January 17, 2002, but waived him before training camp on July 16, 2002. Romero was signed by the St. Louis Rams on August 3, 2003, and stayed with the team for a few weeks before he was waived during final roster cuts on August 25. After being out of football in 2004, he played for the Everett Hawks of the National Indoor Football League (NIFL) in 2005.\nAfter his playing career ended, Romero became a police officer in Oakland, California."

The work may have been finished by van Nost's students.\nIt was displayed on Essex Bridge (now Grattan Bridge) in Dublin from 1722 until some time between 1753 and 1755, when it was removed by George Semple, who was in charge of rebuilding the bridge, in order to prevent erosion caused by the flow of water around the pedestal on which the statue sat.\nThe statue was re-erected in 1798 in the gardens of the city's Mansion House. It was acquired for the Barber Institute, Birmingham in 1937 (at which time Dublin was the capital of the Irish Free State) by the institute's founding director, Thomas Bodkin, who had arrived there directly from his post as director of the National Gallery of Ireland in 1935.\nIn July 1982, the statue was granted legal protection as a Grade II listed structure, preventing unauthorised removal or alteration."

The worldwide broadcast began at 20:30 and finished at 22:30 AEST, lasting almost two hours.\nThe athletes entered the stadium before the broadcast began, a decision which attracted criticism. In reality, this early entrance was not without recent precedent and in reality, a 10-minute 'salute to the athletes of the Commonwealth' had been planned and rehearsed with the athletes and crowd in the stadium before the broadcast began - intended as a surprise to the broadcast audience. However, due to a very low turnout of athletes on the night, the sequence, which was to feature Usain Bolt DJ ing as the cast and athletes danced for the crowd had to be curtailed. Channel 7 was particularly virulent in its criticism. (It was later revealed that many athletes has elected not to attend the Ceremony in favour of attending a party being hosted elsewhere by the channel).\nProgram.\nSingers performance.\nThe closing ceremony started with a performance of Australian singer Amy Shark. She performed the song \"Let Love Rule\". She then introduced Australian musician Archie Roach and together with the youth choir continued the performance. Then thirteen year old poet Solli Raphael recited a poem about the Games. He is known for winning the Australian Poetry Slam competition in 2017 and is the youngest ever to win the competition. Australian singer Ricki-Lee Coulter performed her song \"All We Need is Love\". She also performed in the opening ceremony with her song \"Technicolor Love\". After her, Australian boy group The Koi Boys gave a performance. Anthony Callea performed the song \"You Should Be Dancing\" originally by the Bee Gees. After him, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt appeared as DJ along with Games mascot Borobi in the middle of the stage.\nSpeeches.\nPeter Beattie.\nGold Coast Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC) chairman Peter Beattie gave a speech:\nHe also praised the athletes, volunteers, the CGF and wished good luck to the Birmingham 2022 committee. After him, the David Dixon Award was presented by the CGF president Louise Martin to New Zealand weightlifter David Liti who won gold at the Men's +105 kg weightlifting event at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\nLouise Martin.\nFollowing the David Dixon award presentation, Louise Martin gave a speech about the conduct of the Games:\nMartin also announced that the Games mascot Borobi should remain active after the Games in order to support and raise funds for the Yugambeh community.\nAnanstacia Palaszczuk.\nAfter Martin, Premier of Queensland Ananstacia Palaszczuk gave a speech:\nThe commonwealth Games ceremonial flag was passed from Tom Tate, Mayor of Gold Coast to Sam Coffa, President of Commonwealth Games Australia, to Louise Martin, President of the Commonwealth Games Federation, to Ian Metcalfe, Chairman of Commonwealth Games England and finally to Anne Underwood, Lord Mayor of Birmingham. Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate presented his speech to the audience and thanked the volunteers for their support and wished good luck to the Birmingham 2022 committee. President of Commonwealth Games Australia Sam Coffa presented his speech and praised Gold Coast city and the athletes of the Games. He then offered his thanks to the people of Gold Coast for their support.\nAnne Underwood.\nLord Mayor of Birmingham Anne Underwood gave her speech and told the crowd:\nBirmingham handover.\nAfter her speech ended, a video about Birmingham's life and culture was shown in the screens of the stadium. The video showed the skyline of Birmingham city, its street markets, active youth, shopping streets, bars, pubs, Birmingham New Street railway station, trams and spaghetti junction. In the video, a man and a girl was shown dancing in one of the pubs of Birmingham and said \"a night you never forget, in a city that never sleeps\". The video ended with displaying the word #BRUM. Lady Sanity, a rap artist from Birmingham, then performed with her song \"Go The Distance\". After this, Amerah Saleh performed her poem \"Tourist in My City\" from what appeared to be the same location, but turned out to be Birmingham as she finished and walked into a six-minute one-take live dance performance to Electric Light Orchestra's \"Mr. Blue Sky\"."

        "text": "The 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals was the final tournament of the 2018–19 edition of the UEFA Nations League, the inaugural season of the international football competition involving the men's national teams of the 55 member associations of UEFA. The tournament was held in Portugal from 5 to 9 June 2019, and was contested by the four group winners of Nations League A. The tournament consisted of two semi-finals, a third place play-off, and final to determine the inaugural champions of the UEFA Nations League.\nPortugal won the final 1–0 against the Netherlands to become the inaugural champions of the UEFA Nations League.\nFormat.\nThe Nations League Finals took place in June 2019 and was contested by the four group winners of League A. The four teams were each drawn into a five-team group (rather than a six-team group) for the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying group stage, thereby leaving the June 2019 window available for the Nations League Finals.\nThe competition was played in a knockout format, consisting of two semi-finals, a third place play-off, and a final. The semi-final pairings, along with the administrative home teams for the third place play-off and final, were determined by means of an open draw on 3 December 2018.\nThe tournament took place over five days, with the first semi-final (which featured the host team) on 5 June, the second semi-final on 6 June, and the third place play-off and final on 9 June. The winners of the final were crowned as the inaugural champions of the UEFA Nations League.\nThe Nations League Finals were played in single-leg knockout matches. If the scores were level at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of extra time were played, where each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution. If the score was still level, the winner was determined by a penalty shoot-out. All matches in the tournament utilised the goal-line technology system. On 3 December, UEFA confirmed that the video assistant referee (VAR) system would be used for the Nations League Finals.\nQualified teams.\nThe four group winners of League A qualified for the Nations League Finals.\nHost selection.\nPortugal was confirmed as the host country by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting on 3 December 2018 in Dublin, Ireland. Only League A teams could bid for the Nations League Finals, and only one of the four participants was selected as hosts. The Nations League Finals was held in two stadiums, each with a seating capacity of at least 30,000. Ideally, the stadiums would have been located in the same host city or up to approximately apart.\nOn 9 March 2018, UEFA announced that Italy, Poland, and Portugal expressed interest in bidding prior to the deadline. The deadline to submit their dossiers was 31 August 2018. As all three associations formed Group A3, the group winner was in line to be appointed as the host, provided that the associations submitted bids that met UEFA's requirements. Poland were relegated from Group A3 on 14 October 2018, leaving Italy and Portugal as potential hosts. On 17 November 2018, Portugal won Group A3 and advanced to the Finals, thereby automatically winning hosting rights, which were confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee on 3 December 2018, the same day as the Nations League Finals draw.\nVenues.\nIn their bid dossier, the Portuguese Football Federation proposed Estádio do Dragão in Porto and Estádio D. Afonso Henriques in Guimarães as the venues.\nDraw.\nThe draw took place on 3 December 2018, 14:30 CET (13:30 local time), at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin, Ireland. No seeding was applied in the draw. The first two balls drawn were allocated as the administrative home teams for each semi-final pairing, with the next two balls drawn allocated as their opponents. For scheduling purposes, the semi-final pairing involving the host team was considered to be semi-final 1. The administrative home team for both the third place play-off and final were then jointly drawn between semi-final 1 and 2.\nSquads.\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament. If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he was replaced by another player.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nAll times are local, WEST ().\nSemi-finals.\nPortugal vs Switzerland.\n&lt;section begin=Semi-final 1 /&gt;&lt;section end=Semi-final 1 /&gt;\nNetherlands vs England.\n&lt;section begin=Semi-final 2 /&gt;&lt;section end=Semi-final 2 /&gt;\nThird-place play-off.\n&lt;section begin=Third place play-off /&gt;&lt;section end=Third place play-off /&gt;\nStatistics.\nAwards.\nThe Team of the Tournament was selected by UEFA's technical observers, and includes at least one player from each of the four participants.\nUEFA also announced a team of the tournament based on the FedEx Performance Zone player rankings.\nThe Player of the Tournament award was given to Bernardo Silva, who was chosen by UEFA's technical observers.\nThe SOCAR Young Player of the Tournament award was open to players born on or after 1 January 1996. The award was given to Frenkie de Jong, as chosen by UEFA's technical observers.\nThe \"Alipay Top Scorer Trophy\", given to the top scorer in the Nations League Finals, was awarded to Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored a hat-trick in the semi-final against Switzerland. The ranking was determined using the following criteria: 1) goals in Nations League Finals, 2) assists in Nations League Finals, 3) fewest minutes played in Nations League Finals, 4) goals in league phase 5) fewest yellow and red cards in Nations League Finals, 6) fewest yellow and red cards in league phase.\nThe SOCAR Goal of the Tournament was decided by online voting. A total four goals were in the shortlist, chosen by UEFA's technical observers, from two players: Cristiano Ronaldo (all three goals against Switzerland) and Matthijs de Ligt (against England). Ronaldo won the award for his second goal against Switzerland.\nDiscipline.\nA player was automatically suspended for the next match for receiving a red card, which could be extended for serious offences. Yellow card suspensions did not apply in the Nations League Finals.\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\nPrize money.\nThe prize money to be distributed was announced in October 2018. In addition to the €2.25 million solidarity fee for participating in the Nations League, the four participants received an additional €2.25 million for winning their groups and qualifying for the Nations League Finals.\nIn addition, the participants received payment based on performance:\nThis meant that the maximum amount of solidarity and bonus fees for the UEFA Nations League winners was €10.5 million."

The competition was held from October 25 – November 3, 2018, at the Aspire Academy Dome in Doha, Qatar.\nIt was the first time that the competition was held in the Middle East.\nSimone Biles became the first American to medal on every event at a single World Championships and the first woman to do so in 31 years. The last person to complete this feat was Russian Yelena Shushunova in 1987.\nMen's results.\nTeam.\nThe top 3 teams from the 2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships qualified to the 2020 Summer Olympic Games.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nIndividual all-around.\nDefending champion Xiao Ruoteng of China lost the title on a tiebreaker to Russia's Artur Dalaloyan. The tie-breaking procedure in this situation is dropping of the lowest-scoring apparatus from the combined score, and whoever's total score on the remaining five apparatuses is higher after that will rank ahead (74.198 versus 73.465). Dalaloyan became the first Russian man to win the all-around title since Nikolai Kryukov in 1999; they were at that time the only two Russian men to have won the title in the post-Soviet era. Last year's silver medalist, China's Lin Chaopan, failed to reach the final after finishing behind teammates Xiao and Sun Wei in qualifying. Reigning bronze medalist Kenzō Shirai of Japan finished in seventh place after some weaker and lower-scoring apparatuses, namely pommel horse.\nCanada's René Cournoyer withdrew prior to the competition and was replaced by first reserve Artur Davtyan of Armenia.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nFloor.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nPommel horse.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nRings.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nVault.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nParallel bars.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nHorizontal bar.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nWomen's results.\nTeam.\nThe top 3 teams from the 2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships qualify to the 2020 Summer Olympic Games.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nIndividual all-around.\nSimone Biles of the United States won an unprecedented fourth all-around title on the women's side. Teammate and defending champion Morgan Hurd placed third. Japan's Mai Murakami recorded her country's highest-ever finish in the all-around, and her silver was Japan's first all-around medal on the women's side since Kōko Tsurumi's bronze in 2009. Reigning silver medalist Ellie Black of Canada finished twelfth. The 2017 bronze medalist, Russia's Elena Eremina, was unable to compete due to a back injury. This final was one of the most closely contested of all time, with less than two tenths of a point separating the second- to sixth-place gymnasts.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nVault.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nUneven bars.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nBalance beam.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nFloor.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nQualification.\nMen's results.\nFloor.\nAlthough Artur Dalaloyan of Russia and Kenzō Shirai of Japan both posted the top combined score (14.833) in qualifications, Dalaloyan placed ahead after applying the tie-breaking procedure because he posted a higher E-score than Shirai (8.633 versus 8.033). The same situation with the score (14.333) happened for Kazuma Kaya of Japan, Sam Mikulak of the United States and James Hall of Britain, when Kaya and Mikulak took the final's last two spots after their tied 8th place because they posted identical D- and E-scores while Hall ended up placing 10th, and just missed qualifying for the finals, even though he posted the same combined score."

It was an unexpected medal, as Schwazer knocked nearly twenty minutes off his previous best that year. Among other Italian performances, three athletes finished fifth in field event finals: Nicola Ciotti (men's high jump), Giuseppe Gibilisco (men's pole vault) and Zahra Bani (women's javelin throw). Excluding the straight finals in the marathon and walks, six Italians reached the final of their track and field event.\nThis was Italy's worst performance on the medal table at the World Championships at that point and presaged the outcome of no medals at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics."

        "text": "George William Norton (1 April 1920 – 7 October 1999) was an Irish rugby union player who played in the fullback position. Norton played club rugby with Bective Rangers, represented Leinster at provincial level, was capped 11 times for Ireland, and was a member of the British Lions team that toured in 1950.\nRugby career.\nNorton picked up the game of rugby while in school at St Mary's College, Dublin. He joined St Mary's College RFC but struggled to displace his brother Austin from the team for his preferred position of fullback. Switching codes to play for Shamrock Rovers for a year or so, he moved club to Bective Rangers where he spent the remainder of his playing career. A first appearance for the provincial Leinster team came in 1947.\nIn Ireland's first game of the 1949 Five Nations Championship against France, Norton started the game at fullback to make his international debut. He went on to play in all four of Ireland's games in that year's tournament, which culminated with Ireland being crowned champions and clinching the Triple Crown. During the tournament, Norton scored a total of 26 points, then a record for most points scored by a player in a single championship. The Barbarians invitation team included Norton in their 1949 Easter tour, where he played in two matches against Penarth and Newport. He again featured in all four of Ireland's matches in the 1950 Five Nations, which led to his inclusion in the British Lions squad that was selected to tour New Zealand and Australia later that year. Norton appeared in three out of the first five games that the Lions played on tour against local opposition teams, but sustained an injury in that third game against Southland that ended his participation in the tour.\nNorton returned to play for Ireland in the 1951 Five Nations Championship. He featured in the first three of Ireland's games against France, England and Scotland but suffered an injury in that game against Scotland resulted in him being unable to play in their final game of the tournament against Wales. Ireland again clinched the Championship, but the shoulder injury was serious enough to force Norton to give up playing rugby.\nPost-playing career.\nFollowing his retirement from playing the game, Norton took up refereeing. He also was president of Bective Rangers. In 1998, he was inducted into the Rugby Writers of Ireland Hall of Fame."

This season saw Del Potro slightly improve on his previous results as well as his playing style. Highlights from his season includes winning his 400th career match in Indian Wells, where he won the first Masters 1000 title of his career. After he was forced to retire due to a leg injury in the Italian Open, his participation in the French Open was apparently at risk. However, the Argentine managed to recover in time and entered the tournament as the fifth seed. There, he performed notably well considering the doubts surrounding his physical condition, and the fact that clay is not the best surface for his style of play. His run to the semi-finals ensured that, for the first time since February 2014, Delpo would return to his career-best ranking of world No. 4.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Juan Martín del Potro in 2018, including walkovers (W/O) which the ATP does not count as wins.\nYearly records.\nATP and Grand Slam sanctioned matches.\nJuan Martín del Potro has a ATP match win–loss record in the 2018 season. His record against players who were part of the ATP rankings Top Ten at the time of their meetings is 7–4. Bold indicates player was ranked top 10 at time of at least one meeting.

Saint Mary's upset top-ranked Gonzaga 60–47 in the championship game and received the conference's automatic bid to the 68-team NCAA tournament.\nIt was the fourth WCC tournament title for Saint Mary's, their first since 2012, and the Gaels were seeded eleventh in the South regional of the NCAA Tournament. With the loss, Gonzaga fell to fourth in the national rankings, but was still the top seed in the West regional.\nSeeds.\nAll ten WCC schools teams participated in the tournament, seeded by conference record, with a tiebreaker system for identical conference records. The tournament returned to a format similar to that used from 2003 to 2011, with slight changes to the terminology used for the rounds prior to the semifinals. The 7 through 10 seeds will play in the \"first round\", the 5 and 6 seeds will start play in the \"second round\", and the 3 and 4 seeds will start in the \"third round\". The top two seeds will receive byes into the semifinals. \nAs the regular-season champion, Gonzaga clinched a semifinal spot, and technically secured a place in the NIT. However, the Bulldogs were all but certain to receive an NCAA Tournament bid regardless of results in the conference tournament, given that they entered the final week of the conference season as the top-ranked team in the AP poll.\nSaint Mary's also clinched a semifinal berth as the regular season runner-up. BYU and San Francisco clinched double byes, while LMU and Santa Clara had single byes. San Diego, Pepperdine, Pacific and Portland played in the first round."

Twelve regional qualifiers were held by the International Cricket Council (ICC), with 62 teams competing during 2018 in five regions – Africa (3 groups), Americas (2), Asia (2), East Asia Pacific (2) and Europe (3). The top 25 sides from these progressed to five Regional Finals in 2019, with seven teams then going on to compete in the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier, along with the six lowest ranked sides from the ICC T20I Championship.\nEighteen countries from the European region competed in the initial phase of the tournament, divided into three groups of six each. Those matches took place in the Netherlands between 29 August and 2 September 2018. The top two of each group advanced to the ICC World T20 Europe Regional Finals in 2019. In April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full international status to Twenty20 men's matches played between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards. Therefore, all the matches in the Regional Finals were played as Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).\nThree of the fixtures on day one of the qualifiers were abandoned because of rain. All three matches were replayed on the tournament's reserve day, 31 August 2018. Denmark and Germany qualified from Group A for the Regional Finals. They were joined by Italy and Jersey from Group B, and Norway and Guernsey from Group C.\nThe Regional Finals were held in Guernsey in June 2019. Jersey progressed to the T20 World Cup Qualifier after winning the Regional Finals. Jersey finished level on points with Germany, with Jersey advancing with a better net run rate.\nGroup A.\nPoints table.\n(Q) Qualified to Regional Finals\nGroup B.\nPoints table.\n(Q) Qualified to Regional Finals\nGroup C.\nPoints table.\n(Q) Qualified to Regional Final\nRegional Finals.\nThe Regional Finals took place in Guernsey from 15 to 20 June 2019. Germany announced their squad for the finals on 14 May 2019, which included three players (Ollie Rayner, Craig Meschede and Dieter Klein) with experience playing for county teams in English domestic cricket, although only Meschede joined up with the final squad. On 31 May 2019, the ICC confirmed all of the squads for the Regional Finals. During the tournament, Michael Richardson, who has also played in English domestic cricket, was added to Germany's squad, replacing the injured Daniel Weston.\nAt the mid-point of the Regional Final, Jersey and Italy had pulled clear from the other teams, both recording three wins from three matches. All four fixtures scheduled to take place on 18 June were washed out, with them being moved to the reserve day on 20 June. On the last day of fixtures, Jersey won the group to advance to the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier, despite losing to Germany in the last match of the Regional Finals, progressing due to a superior net run rate."

        "text": "The 2018–19 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team represented Michigan State University in the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Spartans were led by 24th-year head coach Tom Izzo and played their home games at Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan as members of the Big Ten Conference.\nWith a win over in-state rival Michigan on March 9, 2019, the Spartans earned a share of the Big Ten regular season championship, marking back-to-back championships for the school. It also marked the school's ninth conference championship under Tom Izzo. They finished the season 32–7, 16–4 to earn a share of the Big Ten championship. As the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they defeated Ohio State, Wisconsin, and Michigan for the third time on the season to win the tournament championship. The win over Ohio State on March 15, marked Tom Izzo's 600th career win. The Tournament win marked the school's sixth championship, the most in the Big Ten. The Spartans received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 2 seed in the East Region.

The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, their 21st consecutive trip under Izzo, as the No. 3 seed in the Midwest region. They defeated No. 14 Bucknell in the first round before losing to No. 11-seeded Syracuse in the second round. As a result, the Spartans failed to make the Sweet Sixteen for the third consecutive year, a first for the Spartans with Izzo as head coach.

MSU turned the ball over repeatedly in the early minutes of the game and the Longhorns jumped out to a quick double digit lead. With eight minutes remaining in the first half, Texas pushed the lead to 19 and the Spartans looked out of sorts. However, Josh Langford took control for the Spartans, scoring 29 points as they roared back to take the lead early in the second half. MSU, helped by Cassius Winston's 20 points, held on to notch another double digit win, winning 78–68 to earn the Invitational championship and pushing their record to 5–1 on the season.\nLouisville.\nOn November 27, newly No. 9-ranked MSU traveled to face Louisville as part of the ACC–Big Ten Challenge. The Spartans, who played without starting guard Matt McQuaid who suffered a thigh bruise late against Texas, struggled against Louisville. Without McQuaid, Cassius Winston played the majority of the game at the point and, at times, showed fatigue. He would eventually foul out with about four minutes remaining in the game. MSU trailed by six at halftime, but narrowed the lead and eventually took the lead in the second half. However, missed free throws, nine in the game, resulted in the Spartans being unable to put the game away. In overtime, the Spartans could not get enough shots to fall as they lost 82–78.

Rutgers brought the game close as the second half came to a close, but the Spartans held on to win by 11. Nick Ward played well, pouring in 20 points on seven of 12 shooting from the field. Joshua Langford added 14 as MSU moved to 6–2 on the season and 1–0 in Big Ten play.\nIowa.\nThree days later, the Spartans returned home for the first time in over two weeks to face No. 18 Iowa.

MSU, behind Nick Ward's perfect 10–10 tonight pushed the lead to as many as 28 in the second half as they dominated the Hawkeyes in the game.

Tom Izzo continued to shorten his bench as Matt McQuaid made his return though did not start. Only eight players saw the floor for MSU and Cassius Winston seemed to struggle with fatigue, scoring only 10 points on four of 13 shooting including 0–5 from three. Kyle Ahrens, who started his third straight game, finished the scoring for the Spartans with seven straight points including a dunk as the shot clock expired with less than 10 seconds remaining to give the Spartans the 63–59 win. Xavier Tillman led the Spartans with 14 points while Josh Langford and Nick Ward added 13 each. The win moved the Spartans to 8–2 on the season.\nGreen Bay.\nAfter eight days off for finals, the Spartans returned to play at Breslin Center against Green Bay. The Phoenix shot well from the field early, making 10 of their first 15 shots and taking a 24–20 lead. However, from there the Spartans dominated behind Nick Ward's career-high 28 points and led 64–35 at the half. Cassius Winston scored 16 points and dished out 12 assists in the blowout while Josh Langford added 13. MSU even played all five freshmen from its recruiting class at the same time late in the game as the Spartans won easily 104–83. Michigan State dominated the boards, out-rebounding Green Bay 56–34. The win moved the Spartans to 9–2 on the season.\nOakland.\nFive days later, the Spartans welcomed Oakland to East Lansing.

The Spartans played without Josh Langford who was in a boot before the game. Northwestern played well to start the game, but MSU went on a 26–8 run to end the first half to blow the game open. Nick Ward scored all 21 of his points in the first half as the Wildcats chose not to double team him. Leading by 20 at the half, MSU pushed the lead to as many as 32 in the second half before easing off the gas and winning by 26. Cassius Winston scored 13 points with 12 assists in the 81–55 win. The win moved Michigan State to 12–2 on the season and 3–0 in Big Ten play.\nOhio State.\nThree days later, MSU hit the road to take on No. 14-ranked Ohio State looking to move to 4–0 on the season. Cassius Winston struggled in the first half and was challenged by Tom Izzo at halftime. Winston responded, scoring 25 points to overcome a 43–36 halftime deficit.

Nick Ward scored 16 points for the Spartans while Matt McQuaid scored 15 and Cassius Winston scored 11. Michigan State turned the ball over 17 times but only trailed for 10 seconds in the game, leading by as many as 21. The 71–56 win marked MSU's 10th straight win. However, Tom Izzo was not pleased after the game and said Winston played one of his worst games. The win tied the school record for consecutive regular season conference wins at 18.\nNebraska.\nThe Spartans continued their road trip to face Nebraska in Lincoln. The game remained tight throughout the first half, but MSU pulled away late to earn a 70–64 win, without both Josh Langford or Kyle Ahrens for the second consecutive game. Cassius Winston rebounded from his poor outing against Penn State in the previous game and led the way with a career-high 29 points. Winston went over 1,00 career points for MSU in the game as Nick Ward also added 15 points and 10 rebounds. MSU's defense again held a star player in check, limiting James Palmer Jr. to six of 21 from the field, though he did score 24 points. The win improved the Spartans' record to 16–2 on the season and 7–0 in conference play and set a school record with their 19th straight conference regular season win.\nMaryland.\nFour days later, Michigan State returned home to face No. 13-ranked Maryland. The Spartans jumped out to an early first half lead before Maryland tied the game at 20 in the first half. MSU, however, answered an 11–0 run to end the half and never trailed again.

The Spartans fell 73–63, ending their 15-game winning streak and their 21-game conference regular season streak. The loss moved the Spartans to 18–3 and 9–1 on the season.\nIndiana.\nAfter playing three games in six days, the Spartans had five days to prepare for a visit from Indiana. A few days before the game, it was announced that guard Josh Langford, who had missed the previous eight games, would miss the remainder of the season. In an ESPN Gameday visit, the Spartans struggled from the foul line, making only eight of 22 free throws. The Hoosiers, who had lost seven straight games, led for most of the first half, but MSU narrowed the lead to three at the half. Cassius Winston scored 26 for the Spartans, but MSU, known for its rebounding, were outrebounded by Indiana including 20 offensive rebounds. As MSU struggled at the free throw line, the Spartans were unable to put the game away and had to settle for overtime. In overtime, Indiana's Romeo Langford led the way as the Hoosiers pulled out the 79–75 win over Michigan State. The loss was MSU's second straight loss, the first time they had lost two games in a row in a season since 2016. The loss also dropped MSU back into a first place tie with Michigan who had lost the night before to Iowa.\nIllinois.\nMSU returned to the road to face Illinois at State Farm Center. Nick Ward did not start as Tom Izzo tried to send a message to his team. However, Illinois took an early lead and for the majority of the game as their intense defense forced the Spartans into 24 turnovers in the game. Cassius Winston alone had nine turnovers. However, the Spartans mounted a furious comeback late in the second half and even took the lead with just over six minutes left. However, Illinois went on a 15–8 run to end the game and notch the victory 79–74. MSU who had struggled from the free throw line against Indiana, made 23–25 against the Illini. The loss dropped MSU out of first place and put them a game behind Purdue and Michigan in the Big Ten standing with a 9–3 record, 18–5 overall.\nMinnesota.\nMinnesota next visited the Spartans as MSU celebrated its 1979 National Championship team. MSU greats Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, Greg Kelser, and others from the team were on hand as Michigan State thumped Minnesota 79–55. Nick Ward rebounded from his recent struggles and scored 22 points to lead all scorers while Matt McQuaid added 18 in the romp over the Golden Gophers. Cassius Winston only played 33 minutes in the game due to foul trouble in the first half and Kenny Goins left with an elbow injury, but MSU still dominated the game. MSU shot over 51% from the field and 40% from three in the win. The Spartans led throughout in the easy win over the struggling Gophers. The win ended MSU's three-game losing streak as they moved to 10–3 in conference and 19–5 overall.\nWisconsin.\nMSU returned to the road to face No. 20 Wisconsin looking to continue their winning ways.

Cassius Winston led all scorers with 23 points and six assists as MSU was able to pull away at the end behind baskets by Goins and Nick Ward. Happ, struggled from the free throw line in the game, going 0–6 down the stretch. MSU pulled out the tough road win 67–59. The win, coupled with a Purdue loss earlier in the night and a surprise Michigan loss to Penn State, moved MSU back into a first place tie with Michigan at 11–3 in conference.\nOhio State.\nOhio State traveled to East Lansing on February 17 looking to avenge a loss to the Spartans earlier in the season. OSU started well, leading for most of the first half and taking a six-point halftime lead. In the second half, MSU started without Nick Ward who was on the bench having his hand looked at by medical staff. Playing most of the half without Ward, the Spartans' defense clamped down holding the Buckeyes to only 13 points. Matt McQuaid (14 points) and Kenny Goins (10 rebounds) led MSU in the second half as they pulled away to win by 18, 62–44. Cassius Winston had 13 points and eight assists while Thomas Kithier played 10 important minutes in Ward's absence. Aaron Henry, after having a good game against Wisconsin earlier in the week, only played 10 minutes and was held scoreless. The win returned MSU to a first-place tie with Michigan atop the Big Ten standings at 12–3. Following the game, MSU announced that Ward had suffered a hairline fracture in his left hand and that he would be out indefinitely, further weakening the Spartans roster.\nRutgers.\nIn their first game since Nick Ward broke his hand, MSU struggled early against Rutgers on February 20. Rutgers led for most of the first half and led a seven-point lead at halftime. In the second half, Cassius Winston and Xavier Tillman took over. Winston scored 19 of his game high 28 points in the second half as he led the Spartans to 46 points in the second half. Tillman, starting in place of the injured word, played a career-high 33 minutes and scored a career-high 19 points as MSU rallied to defeat the Scarlet Knights. Kyle Ahrens again injured his back, but still played 20 minutes for the injury-depleted Spartans. Four Spartans, Winston, Tillman, Kenny Goins, and Matt McQuaid played over 30 minutes in the game. The win kept the Spartans in first place tie with Michigan who won the next day.\nMichigan.\nOn February 24, MSU traveled to face rival Michigan with the lead in the Big Ten on the line. Playing again without Nick Ward, MSU played well, led by Cassius Winston's 27 points. Michigan had trouble with MSU's ball screen offense, but still led midway through the second half. Winston then took over, using ball screens to drive to the basket or to dish to open shooters as MSU retook the lead. MSU shot 50% from the field in the game while their defense limited Michigan's offense to less than 40%. Winston had eight assists in the game as MSU ended a three-game losing streak to Michigan. Kenny Goins added 16 points, while Xavier Tillman scored 14 as MSU was able to hold on for the surprising seven-point win 77–70 win. The win moved MSU to 14–3 and into first place in the conference and a game up on Michigan.\nIndiana.\nWith five days off and the conference championship in MSU's sights, the Spartans traveled to Indiana looking to avenge their earlier home loss to the Hoosiers. MSU, playing again without Nick Ward, led for the majority of the game, pushing the lead in to double figures in the second half. Despite shooting less than 38% from the field in the game, the Hoosiers narrowed the MSU lead late in the second half and took the lead on a free throw by Romeo Langford. With more than 30 seconds left in the game, the Hoosiers, fouled Cassius Winston with less than 10 seconds to go with a foul to give. MSU took a timeout to draw up a play for the winner, but Winston settled for a fall away jumper that came up short and the Hoosiers completed the season sweep of the Spartans. The loss dropped MSU to 14–4 in the conference, a game behind Purdue and tied with Michigan with two games remaining. The loss appeared to end the Spartans chances for a Big Ten championship.\nNebraska.\nMSU returned home to face a struggling Nebraska team. However, the Cornhuskers stayed close with the Spartans for the first 10 minutes, but MSU pulled away to lead by 18 at the half. Without Nick Ward for the fourth straight game, Kenny Goins led the Spartans with a career-high 24 points while Matt McQuaid also added a career-high 22 points. MSU led by more than 20 through portions of the second half, but Nebraska narrowed the lead to singled digits with 10 minutes remaining. However, MSU, who leaned more heavily on freshmen Thomas Kithier, Gabe Brown, and Aaron Henry than in previous games, extended the lead again to win by 15. Henry also had a career-high in points, scoring 15 including an emphatic dunk in the second half. Cassius Winston added eight points and 10 assists as he struggled with knee tendinitis and only played 31 minutes. The win coupled with a Purdue loss to Minnesota later that night, moved MSU back into a first place tie with Michigan and Purdue in the conference at 14–5.\nMichigan.\nMSU welcomed Michigan to Breslin Center on March 9 for Senior Night with a share of the Big Ten championship on the line for the rivals. A win earlier in the day by Purdue meant that the winner of the game would earn a share of the Big Ten championship. Tom Izzo said before the game that Nick Ward could have played, but Izzo determined to hold him out until the Big Ten tournament. Michigan, like when the teams met 13 days prior, started off well, surging to an early lead throughout the first half. Foul trouble hit both teams as Cassius Winston sat the final minutes of the half with two fouls. Meanwhile, Michigan's Ignas Brazdeikis and Isaiah Livers each were limited in the first half with two fouls as well. Despite not having Winston on the floor, MSU kept Michigan within reach and only trailed by six at the half. The second half continued as the first had ended with Michigan maintaining its lead, but MSU kept within striking distance. Winston then took over, making five straight shots at one point as the Spartans surged into the lead. Winston finished with 23 points and seven assists. Xavier Tillman played well for the Spartans, notching 17 points while Kenny Goins added nine points and 16 rebounds. The Spartans dominated the board, outrebounding Michigan 46–20 and pulling away for the 75–63 win. The win gave the Spartans a share of the Big Ten title and marked back-to-back championships for the Spartans. MSU earned the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament with the win as well.\nPostseason.\nBig Ten tournament.\nOhio State.\nAs the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament, the Spartans faced Ohio State for third time on the season. The Buckeyes had beaten Indiana to advance to face Michigan State. Nick Ward returned for the Spartans, but did not start. He saw limited time, but played well, scoring eight points including a jump shot and free throw where he showed no ill affects from the broken hand. The Buckeyes kept the game close in the first half as Cassius Winston struggled. Freshman guard Foster Loyer stepped up for the Spartans, scoring 14 points off the bench, including three three-pointers to give MSU the lead. The Spartans extended their six-point halftime lead and were able to pull away in the second half and led by as many as 21 points. In an obvious attempt to reduce fatigue, Winston only played 22 minutes in the game and Tom Izzo lifted MSU's starters with two minutes remaining in the game. A late surge by the Buckeyes narrowed the lead, but MSU held on for a 77–70 win. The win marked the 600th career victory for Izzo, all at Michigan State.\nWisconsin.\nThe following day, the Spartans faced off against Wisconsin, who MSU had defeated in Madison earlier in the season. Michigan State jumped out to a 18–4 lead within the first six minutes and never trailed in the game. Wisconsin kept the game within shouting distance for most of the game, but MSU pulled out the win 67–55. Cassius Winston led the Spartans with 21 points while Xavier Tillman added 17 points. Nick Ward again did not start, but played 11 minutes. He was saddled with foul trouble through most of the game and only scored two points. Winston injured his toe partway through the game and again saw his minutes restricted, playing only 28. The win sent MSU to the championship game of the Big Ten tournament.\nMichigan.\nOn Selection Sunday, the Spartans squared off with Michigan for the third time in only two weeks, this time for the tournament championship. MSU, who won the previous two games against the Wolverines, started well, jumping out to a 17–11 lead halfway through the first half. However, Spartan guard Kyle Ahrens went down hard on his ankle while coming down with a rebound in the first half and was taken out on a stretcher with an air cast on his leg. Following the injury, Michigan finished the half outscoring the Spartans 10–6, giving them a 31–23 lead at the half. The Wolverines came out hot in the second half, causing the Spartans to fall behind 39–26 in the early going. The Spartans were able to dig deep and complete a 22–9 run, tying the game at 48. MSU trailed the Wolverines by five with just over two minutes remaining, but a Matt McQuaid three pointer and a Cassius Winston assist to Xavier Tillman tied the score at 60 with 1:20 left in the game. A missed Zavier Simpson three-pointer led to a Winston lay up and a Spartans' lead at 62–60 with 29 seconds left. The MSU defense forced Michigan into bad shot attempts and MSU finished by making three of four free throws to give them the 65–60 win. MSU finished the game on a 10–0 run to earn their first Big Ten tournament title since 2016. The win was the school's sixth tournament championship, which leads the Big Ten. The win also completed a three-game season sweep of in-state rival Michigan.\nNCAA Tournament.\nBradley.\nDespite winning the Big Ten regular season and tournament championships, MSU did not receive a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. Instead, the Spartans received the No. 2 seed in the East Region. In the first round, they struggled against No. 15-seeded Bradley, and trailed with only four minutes left in the game. However, helped by a season-high 25-for-26 from the free throw line, the Spartans pulled away for the 76–65 win. Kenny Goins struggled in the game, making only one of 10 shots and missing all seven three-point attempts. Cassius Winston led the way for the Spartans, scoring 26 points while Xavier Tillman added 16. The win moved MSU to the second round to face Big Ten foe Minnesota.\nMinnesota.\nIn the earliest tournament meeting of Big Ten teams since the field had expanded to 64, the Spartans throttled Minnesota. MSU shot over 57% from the field while limiting the Gophers to 30%. MSU dominated Minnesota on the glass, out-rebounding the Gophers 45–19. Xavier Tillman led a balanced scoring attack for MSU with 14 points while Cassius Winston added 13. The Spartans blew out Minnesota 70–50 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2015, the longest Sweet Sixteen drought for the Spartans under Tom Izzo.\nLSU.\nIn the Sweet Sixteen, MSU faced No. 3-seeded LSU. The Spartans dominated for a second consecutive game, jumping out to an early 8–0 lead, and never trailed in the game. Freshmen Gabe Brown (15 points) and Aaron Henry (20 points) each had career-highs in points as the Spartans ran away from the Tigers to an 80–63 victory. Cassius Winston added 17 points in the win as MSU led for the whole game. The win moved MSU to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2015, where they would face the No. 1 seed in the South region and overall No. 1 seed in the tournament, Duke.\nDuke.\nIn the Elite Eight, Izzo faced Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski for the 13th time. Izzo had only beaten \"Coach K\" one time with a record of 1–11 against him coming in to this game. Cassius Winston tallied a double-double with 20 points and 10 assists while Xavier Tillman added 19 points and nine rebounds. However, MSU, who led at the half, trailed by one with less than a minute remaining. Kenny Goins hit a three-pointer with 34 seconds remaining in regulation to give Michigan State the lead. Duke had an opportunity to tie the game at the free throw line with five seconds remaining after Tillman was called for his fourth foul, however Duke freshman R.J. Barrett missed the first of two free throws and inadvertently made the second one. On the ensuing out-of-bounds play, Tillman passed the ball to Winston who sprinted ahead of Duke defenders and ran out the clock to secure the victory 68–67 victory. The Spartans snapped a seven-game losing streak against Duke and advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 2015. Winston was named the East regional's Most Outstanding Player.\nTexas Tech.\nThe Spartans faced No. 3-seeded Texas Tech in the Final Four on April 6, 2019. The visit marked the school's 10th Final Four and eighth under Tom Izzo. Texas Tech limited the Spartans to just under 32% shooting from the field and took a two-point lead in to halftime. The Spartans continued to struggle with the Red Raider defense in the second half, trailing throughout the half. Cassius Winston hit only four of his 16 shots and notched only two assists. Texas Tech moved the lead to 13 points with less than 10 minutes remaining, but the Spartans fought back to within one point. However, MSU could not complete the comeback and lost 61–51 ending their Tournament run.\nRoster.\n \nSchedule and results.\nThe season marked the first time in Big Ten history that the teams played a 20-game conference schedule. The new schedule also includes a regional component to increase the frequency of games among teams in similar areas. Over the course of a six-year cycle (12 playing opportunities), in-state rivals will play each other 12 times, regional opponents will play 10 times, and all other teams will play nine times. Three in-state series will be guaranteed home-and-homes: Illinois and Northwestern, Indiana and Purdue, and Michigan and Michigan State will always play twice. The conference opponent list was released on April 19, 2018. Michigan State released its full schedule on August 21, 2018. \n!colspan=9 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament\nSource\nPlayer statistics.\nSource"

        "text": "Caleb Martin (born September 28, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"the Difference\", he played college basketball for the NC State Wolfpack and the Nevada Wolf Pack. He was named the Mountain West Conference Player of the Year for the 2017–18 season by the league's coaches. He is the twin brother of Cody Martin.\nAn undrafted player in the 2019 NBA draft, Martin began his NBA career in the 2019–20 season, where he played two seasons with the Charlotte Hornets before transferring to the Miami Heat. During his stint with the Heat, he helped his team reach the NBA Finals in 2023.\nHigh school career.\nMartin, a small forward from Mocksville, North Carolina, played basketball for prep powerhouse Oak Hill Academy with twin brother Cody Martin. Prior to playing at Oak Hill, Caleb and his brother played three seasons at Davie County High School in Mocksville. He also played football his freshman year of high school. The two committed to North Carolina State University to play for coach Mark Gottfried.\nCollege career.\nAs a sophomore, Martin averaged 11.5 points and 4.7 rebounds per game. Following that season, the Martin twins chose to transfer to Nevada to play for coach Eric Musselman. They thus would play for both the N.C. State Wolfpack and the Nevada Wolf Pack.\nAfter sitting out the 2016–17 season due to NCAA transfer rules, Martin became eligible the following year. He averaged 18.9 points per game in his debut season, being named Mountain West Conference Player of the Year from the league's coaches and Newcomer of the Year from both coaches and league media. He shared Player of the Year honors with Boise State's Chandler Hutchison, who received the MW media version of the award. Martin led the Wolf Pack to a regular season conference championship and a Top 25 ranking. He and his brother then led the team to the 2018 NCAA tournament, where they advanced to the Sweet 16 after coming back from double-digits in wins over Texas and Cincinnati. After finishing out his junior season, Martin and his brother both tested out the 2018 NBA draft and were in the NBA Draft Combine that year, but both ultimately decided to return for their senior seasons.\nComing into his senior season, Martin was named Preseason Mountain West Player of the Year. Martin averaged 19.2 points per game, 5.1 rebounds, and 2.8 assists. He led Nevada to a 29–5 (15–3 MW) record. Martin’s college career ended with a loss in the First Round of the NCAA tournament to Florida 61–70.

He joined his brother Cody, who was selected in the second round of the draft. On October 19, the Hornets converted Martin's contract into a two-way contract. Later the same day, he agreed to a multi-year deal with the Hornets and was converted to a standard deal. On October 25, Martin made his NBA debut, coming off the bench in a 99–121 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves with four points, two rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal. On November 27, he received his first assignment to the Hornets NBA G League affiliate, the Greensboro Swarm. On March 9, 2020, Martin scored a season-high 23 points, alongside four assists, three steals and two blocks, in a 138–143 double overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks.\nOn April 13, 2021, Martin scored a season-high 17 points, alongside ten rebounds and five assists, in a 93–101 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. On May 4, he again scored 17 points, alongside five rebounds, two assists and two steals, in a 102–99 win over the Detroit Pistons.\nOn August 7, 2021, Martin was waived by the Hornets.\nMiami Heat (2021–present).\nOn September 14, 2021, Martin signed with the Miami Heat on a two-way contract, splitting time with the Sioux Falls Skyforce. He made his Heat debut on October 21, recording five points and two steals in a 137–95 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. On December 8, Martin scored a career-high 28 points, alongside eight rebounds, three assists and two steals, in a 113–104 win over the Bucks. On February 15, 2022, the Heat converted Martin's contract to a standard deal. During the playoffs, the Heat faced the Atlanta Hawks during their first round series. Martin made his playoff debut on April 17, scoring two points in a 115–91 Game 1 win. The Heat reached the Eastern Conference Finals, but were eliminated in seven games by the Boston Celtics.\nOn July 6, 2022, Martin re-signed with the Heat on a 3-year, $20 million deal. On October 22, 2022, during a 112–109 win over the Toronto Raptors, Martin was ejected after an altercation with Raptors center Christian Koloko. The next day, the NBA suspended Martin for one game without pay due to the altercation.\nDuring the first round of the 2023 NBA playoffs, Martin played a key role in the eight-seed Heat upsetting the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks, averaging 11.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 2 assists per game. On May 19, 2023, Martin scored 25 points during a 111–105 Game 2 Eastern Conference Finals win against the Boston Celtics. In Game 7 of the series, Martin scored 26 points, and grabbed 10 rebounds in a 103–84 win, helping the Heat advance to their second NBA Finals appearance in four years. Martin came one vote short of besting teammate Jimmy Butler for Eastern Conference Finals MVP while averaging 19.3 points and 6.4 rebounds per game, whilst shooting 60.2% from the field and 48.9% from three. Martin struggled in the NBA Finals averaging only 7.4 points on 37.5% shooting. The Heat lost the Finals in 5 games to the Denver Nuggets."

        "title": "Alliance of American Football",
        "text": "The Alliance of American Football (AAF) was a professional American football minor league. The AAF consisted of eight centrally owned and operated teams in the southern and western United States, seven of which were located in metropolitan areas with at least one major professional sports franchise.\nFounded by Charlie Ebersol and Bill Polian in 2018, the AAF began play on February 9, 2019. The league was scheduled to have a 10-week regular season and conclude with a championship game on April 27. After eight weeks of play, however, the league's football operations were suspended by controlling owner Thomas Dundon on April 2. Two days later, the AAF allowed players to leave their contracts to sign with NFL teams. The AAF filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 17, 2019, with the league's sole season left incomplete.\nThe AAF positioned itself as an \"upper-level minor league\" serving as a transition between the college game and the NFL.\nHistory.\nCharlie Ebersol, son of former NBC executive and XFL co-founder Dick Ebersol, was inspired to create the AAF in late 2016 after producing the documentary \"This Was the XFL\" for ESPN Films' \"30 for 30\" series; upon researching and examining the history of the XFL, he came to the conclusion that the concept was viable but that the finished product was both poorly executed and, from an on-field standpoint, bad football. He began developing the AAF in February 2017, about the same time that word had come out about XFL co-founder Vince McMahon possibly reviving the old XFL brand (which McMahon would indeed do in 2020). Exhibits in a lawsuit filed by Robert Vanech, who claimed to have co-founded the AAF, state that Ebersol had originally approached McMahon about relaunching the XFL but was unable to come to an agreement, as Ebersol wanted control of the XFL brand and was willing to pay $50 million for the trademark, which McMahon was unwilling to sell. In December 2018, two months before the AAF season began, Charlie Ebersol asked Vince McMahon about merging the AAF with the XFL. McMahon turned him down.\nThe league was formally organized on February 6, 2018 as an interlocked web of five Delaware limited liability companies: Legendary Field Exhibitions, AAF Players, AAF Properties, LFE 2, and We Are Realtime, LLC. Each in turn was controlled by Ebersol through his own entity as manager, Ebersol Sports Media Group, Inc., while minority investors held stakes in one or more of the LLC entities.\nThe AAF was announced on March 20, 2018. Ebersol sought to focus on creating a solid football product in the hopes that it would attract fans. He hired a team of experienced football players, coaches and executives to prepare the league for launch. The AAF was overseen by former NFL general manager Bill Polian, former Pittsburgh Steelers safety Troy Polamalu, and executive J. K. McKay. Advisers also include former Steelers receiver Hines Ward, former New York Giants and Oakland Raiders defensive end Justin Tuck, retired referee and current Fox NFL rules analyst Mike Pereira, and Ebersol's father, Dick Ebersol.\nEbersol attended the first XFL game in Las Vegas in 2001, and remembered how disappointed his father was by the poor quality of play. To ensure professional-level football at launch, the AAF set out to hire coaches with professional football coaching and championship experience. On April 7, 2018, the first team, Orlando, was announced with its coach Steve Spurrier. By June 2018, the league had announced its eight inaugural teams and their cities.\nOn July 30, 2018, the Alliance announced the league had signed 100 players. In August 2018, the league held the Alliance Scouting Combine at three locations and four dates: August 4, 2018, in Los Angeles, California; August 18 in Houston, Texas; and August 25–26 in Atlanta, Georgia. By August 24, 2018, 205 players were signed. These dates provided an opportunity for players cut at the NFL roster deadline, and each player signed a non-guaranteed three-year contract worth a total of $250,000 ($70,000 in 2019; $80,000 in 2020; $100,000 in 2021), with performance-based and fan-interaction incentives allowing for players to earn more.\nIn July 2018, Starter, through G-III Sports, which manufactured NFL jerseys and apparel in the 1980s and 1990s, was named the official on-field apparel and game-day uniform supplier for the AAF, marking a return for the brand to professional football after an almost 20-year absence. On September 20, the league announced four eastern inaugural franchises' names and logos. The four western teams' logos and names were revealed five days later.\nInaugural season.\nOn October 16, 2018, the Alliance announced its schedule (indicating the day and location, but not the time, of each game) which had two games each on Saturday and on Sunday most weekends. Quarterback skills training camps were held at the Alamodome in San Antonio on November 12 through 14. On November 27, the league held a four-round \"Protect or Pick\" quarterback draft in the Esports Arena at Luxor Las Vegas and broadcast on CBS Sports Network.\nThe AAF began its inaugural, 10-week season on February 9, 2019. The first points in AAF regular season history were scored by kicker Younghoe Koo of the Atlanta Legends, who made a 38-yard field goal against the Orlando Apollos. The first touchdown came in the same game with Orlando quarterback Garrett Gilbert connecting with Jalin Marshall for a 16-yard score. The first shutout was recorded by the Birmingham Iron when they defeated the Memphis Express, 26–0, in Week 1. The first onside conversion (see Rules section, below) was attempted during Week 3, with Atlanta successfully completing a 48-yard pass against Birmingham. The first safety was registered by Atlanta against the Arizona Hotshots in Week 4. The first overtime game occurred in Week 7, with Memphis defeating Birmingham.\nA four-team playoff was to be capped with the league's championship game, initially scheduled to be held at Sam Boyd Stadium near Las Vegas. After Dundon took over league operations, he moved the game to the Ford Center at the Star in Frisco, Texas.\nCessation of operations.\nOn April 2, 2019, the AAF suspended all football operations, on orders from AAF chairman Tom Dundon. League co-founder Bill Polian stated:\nPlayers found out about the suspension through the Internet before their coaches confirmed the news. Players were evicted from the hotels where their teams were being housed—with some being personally charged for unpaid hotel bills—and required to pay their own way home; they also lost their health insurance and were forced to cover their own medical bills from injuries sustained during play. League employees were notified via an April 2 letter from the AAF board, which did not give a reason for ending the season, that their jobs were terminated as of April 3 with no severance. Ebersol and Dundon refused public comment; Ebersol would eventually speak out on April 17, stating that he had been advised not to speak by his attorneys. He insisted that the money he raised was there and had been vetted up until immediately before the season, claimed that reports of players being saddled with hotel and medical bills were either fake news or fraudulent charges, and could not ensure that all those owed money would be paid.\nOn April 4, the AAF announced through their official Twitter account that players were eligible to leave their contracts to sign with NFL teams. The contracts that players had originally signed included a stipulation that they could leave to sign with NFL teams at the conclusion of an AAF season. The league did not issue any public statement until April 6, when the AAF.com website was updated with a statement, which read in part:\nAt the time its football operations were suspended, the AAF had played eight weeks out of a scheduled ten-week regular season.\nBankruptcy liquidation.\nOn April 17, Ebersol Sports Media Group, Inc. and the five AAF operating entities filed for joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy (liquidation) in Texas’ Eastern District. In the filing, the league claimed assets of $11.3 million, liabilities of $48.3 million, and approximately $536,000 in cash. The AAF counted its player contracts among its assets in the bankruptcy filing, blocking players from joining the Canadian Football League. This block was lifted a day after the bankruptcy filing.\nThe league's uniforms and equipment were stored in a lot in San Antonio, Texas and eventually auctioned off in July 2019. Former Arena Football League commissioner Jerry Kurz made the winning bid at $455,000, beating out bids from (among others) the revived XFL. Subsequently, the perpetually postponed Major League Football claimed it had entered into an agreement to purchase the equipment for $400,000.\nRules.\nEbersol deliberately avoided making radical changes to the rules of the game so as to make it recognizable to the U.S. public. He stated that he used the average length of a feature film, slightly over two hours, as the basis for a typical fan's attention span.\nBusiness.\nThe Alliance operated as a single entity, with all teams owned and operated by the league, under the name Legendary Field Exhibitions LLC. Some of the investors in the AAF included Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, The Chernin Group (which owns Barstool Sports), Jared Allen, Slow Ventures, Adrian Fenty, Charles King's M Ventures, and Keith Rabois. Long-term plans were for the AAF to sell franchises to individual owners.\nMGM Resorts International made an investment in the AAF tech platform, and entered a three-year sponsorship agreement to become the league's official sports betting sponsor and exclusive gaming partner. The deal marked the first time any sports organization had sold exclusive in-game betting rights to a sportsbook. Scott Butera, MGM's director of interactive gaming (the division that signed an agreement with the AAF), was formerly the commissioner of the Arena Football League before his 2018 ouster. Under the terms of the agreement, MGM Resorts International owned all rights to the tech platform in the event the league ceases operations, preventing an investor from buying the league solely for access to the technology. Gambling functions were never implemented on the league's app, and many planned features for the app never materialized due to technical glitches and impracticality.\nThe league also had player bonuses and scholarships, with player bonuses based on performance and fan interaction, players were to earn a year's scholarship in post-secondary education for each season of play. Players got three-year, non-guaranteed contracts worth $250,000 plus health insurance with an escape clause to go to the NFL. The three-year contract was believed to be purposely targeting the XFL to prevent second-tier professional players from signing with the XFL if they played in the AAF in 2019. XFL commissioner Oliver Luck stated that he did not believe that such a clause would hold up in court after the AAF collapsed, and that the XFL would be willing to sign AAF players. The league also has an incentive system that pays members of a team's offensive and defensive units for statistical achievements and also pays players to perform community service; the exact details of this incentive system were not yet finalized at the start of the 2019 season. Players are assigned to each team by way of a centralized process that is largely a trade secret. The league showed willingness to offer more money to marquee players; Landry Jones noted that Ebersol had personally promised a salary of over $1,000,000 to Jones if he played for the San Antonio Commanders; when Jones pressed Ebersol on when he would be paid, Ebersol became evasive, leading Jones to reject the offer. Matt McGloin likewise turned down the AAF, both because of his skepticism over the league and the birth of his child. For the fans, in addition to a fantasy league built into mobile broadcasts, there were low ticket prices (each team have a $35/game sideline seat option) and inexpensive food at games. When the league abruptly folded, the league left players to personally pay outstanding bills for their own hotels, as well as their transportation home and even their medical bills from injuries sustained during play.\nThe AAF coaching salaries varied by title, with $500,000 for head coaches, $200–250,000 for coordinators, and $75–150,000 for position coaches. Each AAF team employed between 11 and 13 total coaches, putting the total coaching staff expenditures at around $2 million per staff and $16 million for the entire league.\nDundon investment.\nOn February 18, 2019, the league announced that Tom Dundon, whose other holdings include the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL) and TopGolf, agreed to invest $250 million into the league. He was also named the new chairman of the AAF, and Dundon reportedly received a majority stake in the league in exchange for his investment. Dundon's investment was initially reported to be due to the league being in danger of not making payroll. It was later reported that the payroll issue was due to a glitch in the league's changing of payroll companies, and that Dundon's investment had already been planned. Dundon later backtracked on his previous claim of a $250 million investment, noting that he had not actually delivered a $250 million lump sum to the league. Dundon planned on incrementally investing in the league, using $250 million as a theoretical maximum based on if the league were to \"aggressively expand,\" and reserved the right to pull out of the league at any time. At the time of the reported April 2 suspension, Dundon had invested an estimated $70 million into the AAF. He had drastically reduced unnecessary expenses and mostly abandoned the technology platform by the end of the league's operations in a desperate attempt to keep the league financially viable.\nEbersol had admitted prior to the start of the season that, on numerous occasions, the AAF had come dangerously close to folding before its first game due to various unstated complications. When asked whether some of the AAF's initial investors had dropped out, Ebersol declined to answer. After the league suspended operations, it was revealed that one of the league's major investors, former Minnesota Vikings minority owner Reggie Fowler, had indeed pulled his funding after the inaugural game, necessitating the abrupt sale to Dundon. It came out in late April that Fowler's funds had been frozen by the Department of Justice, after Fowler's indictment on charges of money laundering for cryptocurrency exchanges. He was later sentenced to over six years in prison.\nIn early March 2019, it was revealed by Bill Polian that the AAF and National Football League were in informal discussions about a system where players under contract to NFL teams could be loaned to AAF teams. The idea would have been for NFL teams to assign their third-string quarterback and other players from the bottom half of their roster and practice squads to the AAF to gain more playing time in a similar system to what used to be in place during the existence of NFL Europe. This would have in effect made the AAF an official developmental league of the NFL. Dundon sought a change in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement to protect AAF players who may get injured and miss NFL playing time by ensuring the players still earned a salary from the NFL during their recovery. In late March, Dundon stated that, in reference to the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) and its reluctance to cooperate out of concern for injuries, if they are \"not going to give us young players, we can't be a development league\". He added that the AAF was looking at its options, including discontinuing the league if the NFLPA wasn't willing to work with the league. Profootballtalk.com reported shortly thereafter, citing unnamed sources, that if Dundon's demands were not met, he was willing to end his investment before the season ended, possibly as soon as after Week 8, which would cut off the league's cash flow and force it to immediately fold with the playoffs and championship left unplayed. As Week 8 passed, Dundon reiterated his stance on April 1, stating he was still willing to pull his funding before the next week's game.\nUltimately, the AAF lost an estimated $88 million overall, earning only $12 million in revenue against its $100 million expenses.\nLegal matters.\nIn late February 2019, a lawsuit by a venture capitalist in Los Angeles became public, as the AAF issued a statement denying a claim by Robert Vanech that the league was his idea and that he had a handshake agreement with Charlie Ebersol; Vanech is seeking financial damages and 50 percent ownership of the league. \nAs at 2024 the matter has not been resolved. \nAlso in late February, the league revealed that it had been unable to secure a league-wide worker's compensation insurance policy prior to the start of the season, forcing the Orlando Apollos to move its practice operations to Kingsland, Georgia, and commute to Orlando for games, as Florida does not consider professional athletes to be eligible for worker's compensation.\nIn April 2019, after the league suspended football operations, two players—punter Colton Schmidt of the Birmingham Iron and linebacker Reggie Northrup of the Orlando Apollos—filed a class action lawsuit in California, claiming that they were misled about the financial viability of the league and that the league entered contracts with players in bad faith.\nAlso in April, two former front-office league employees filed a class action lawsuit in California, claiming that the league violated the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, which requires large companies to give at least a 60-day advanced notice before large layoffs.\nReggie Fowler was arrested April 30, 2019, on charges related to operating a massive cryptocurrency scam in 2018, the funds for which were used to fund his AAF investments.\nIn November 2022, the trustees handling the AAF bankruptcy filed a lawsuit against Dundon seeking the remainder of the $250 million investment he had publicly promised, alleging he owed the $184 million debt to the league. Dundon countersued Ebersol for the $70 million he had previously invested.\nKey people.\nExecutives.\nSource:\nMedia.\nAs part of its formation, the AAF announced broadcast deals with CBS Sports; opening day (consisting of two regionally-televised games) was scheduled for CBS, as well as a playoff semifinal and the championship game. The telecasts made extensive use of on-field microphones (with head coaches and quarterbacks also miked), and Skycams (with two deployed for each game, with one along the sideline, as opposed to having more than one high camera). Half of the games broadcast each week were produced off-site from Sneaky Big Studios in Scottsdale, Arizona: graphics (which were provided by CBS), Skycam operations, and commentary were performed remotely from the Scottsdale site, as well as studio coverage for all games (via a virtual studio). Ebersol did not disclose whether or not the league was buying the airtime or receiving the airtime for free as part of a partnership agreement. After the season ended, it was confirmed that the AAF had resorted to buying airtime and was unlikely to be able to extract a rights fee from any of its partners for its foreseeable future, a factor in Dundon's decision to withdraw his investment. CBS broadcast an ad for the league during its coverage of Super Bowl LIII.\nCBS Sports Network aired one game per week, and was scheduled to air one of the playoff games. In addition to local stations, TNT was announced as broadcasting two games per season (one regular season and a playoff game which later was expanded to include three regular season games) while NFL Network aired two weekly games. Turner's B/R Live streamed one game a week, and the league's mobile app offered an alternate \"AAF Raw\" feed for most games (excluding those carried by CBSSN), which featured no commentary or graphics. Integrated fantasy games were available through the AAF site and app as well.\nCBSSN's game of the week was called by Ben Holden, Adam Archuleta, and John Schriffen. NFL Network's broadcast team for week one consisted of Dan Hellie on play-by-play and Marvin Lewis on color commentary. TNT's broadcast team consisted of Brian Anderson on play-by-play, Lewis on color commentary, and Maurice Jones-Drew as sideline reporter. The league did not use set announcer pairings, rotating numerous hosts (several of them from CBS's NFL and college football crews) on both play-by-play and color commentary, depending on availability.\nSirius XM Radio, a satellite radio service, carried a select Game of the Week. Additionally, teams made broadcast deals with local radio affiliates.\nReception.\nCritics.\nThe AAF received mixed to positive reviews opening night. Profootballtalk.com, in a mostly positive review, praised the league's television product and choice of markets that would embrace the league, singling out the live look-ins at the replay booth during coach's challenges as an innovation that could transfer to the NFL's television broadcasts. The on-field level of play was somewhat less well-received, being compared to NFL preseason levels, with numerous offensive miscues. SB Nation had a similar assessment, criticizing the game play as \"much worse than... most of major college football,\" while at the same time noting that the league's innovations were largely successful in making games more interesting. In an admittedly incomplete review, Peter King stated that although he would not yet draw any \"major conclusions\" about the league, he liked some of the rule changes but feared the overtime process would be a gimmick.\nViewership.\nOvernight Nielsen Ratings stated that the league-opening regionally televised games on CBS were the highest rated telecast of the night in the key demographic, drawing more viewers than an NBA game on ABC in the same time slot. In overall viewers, both the AAF and NBA lost to a rerun of \"\" on NBC. The NFL Network telecast that week secured 640,000 viewers. With these comparatively strong initial viewership statistics, the Week 2 ratings were highly anticipated in the interest of developing trended data. In Week 2, the afternoon and evening games on Saturday, February 16, reportedly attracted 1,018,000 and 425,000 viewers, respectively, in addition to the Sunday evening game on February 17 drawing 424,000 viewers. Week 3's NFL Network games drew 491,000 and 515,000 viewers, benefiting in part due to a counterprogramming effort against the 91st Academy Awards. Week 4's ratings were largely consistent with those of week 2, with the two NFL Network games that week securing ratings of 404,000 and 450,000 viewers, comparable to college basketball and NHL telecasts on the other sports networks. The disparity between the afternoon and evening games is consistent due to increased competition during primetime hours and the higher market penetration of CBS and TNT compared to NFL Network and CBS Sports Network, the latter of which does not register a rating in the Nielsens.\nIn March 2019, building upon these ratings successes, both CBS and TNT added games to their packages; Turner Sports shifted two additional Saturday afternoon games from B/R Live to TNT (with B/R Live streaming a Skycam-only feed of the games as a companion), while CBS announced that it would shift two games from CBS Sports Network to broadcast television, including a regular season game on April 6, 2019 (in the afternoon prior to CBS's broadcast of the 2019 NCAA Final Four), and one of the conference championship games. However, due to the suspension of football operations, these games were left unplayed.\nNotable players.\nThe following lists notable AAF players:"

        "title": "1998 Harvard vs. Stanford women's basketball game",
        "text": "On March 14, 1998, during the first round of the 1998 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, the Stanford Cardinal of Stanford University played a college basketball game against the Harvard Crimson of Harvard University in Stanford, California. The Cardinal, seeded 1st in the West bracket and 1st overall in the NCAA Tournament, faced Harvard, seeded 16th in the West bracket and ranked 62nd overall (out of a field of 64).\nThe Crimson defeated the Cardinal 71–67, becoming the first No. 16 seed to defeat a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, and the first No. 16 seed to defeat a No. 1 seed in college basketball. Harvard also earned its first NCAA Tournament win in school history. Stanford finished their season at 21–6 while Harvard improved to 23–4.\nBackground.\nStanford.\nTara VanDerveer was hired in 1985 to coach the Cardinal. In her third season, they reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1982 and made it to the Sweet Sixteen. The Cardinal would continue to have postseason success in her tenure; as of , they have not missed the NCAA Tournament since 1987. They reached the Final Four in 1990 and won the Tournament that year for their first championship. They reached the Final Four five further times in the next seven years, winning another Tournament in 1992. In 1998, they won their tenth straight PAC-10 title in program history, and the senior class of players had a combined record of 113-13 leading up to the NCAA Tournament. However, the team was plagued by injury late in the year. Star player Vanessa Nygaard went down with an Anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL) against Oregon State while Kristin Folkl landed awkwardly during practice with her own torn ligament. Neither would play in the game.\nHarvard.\nHarvard was ranked as a 16 seed for the third straight year despite a record of 22-4 on their way to the program's sixth Ivy League title (1986, 1988, 1991, 1996, 1997) and the nation's leading scorer in Allison Feaster. The team later stated that their anger at being ranked 16 fueled their fire for their game plan. This was Harvard's third overall NCAA Tournament appearance (all under Kathy Delaney-Smith, hired in 1982), which had seen them lose in the first round each time. No Ivy League women's basketball team would win a NCAA Tournament game again until Princeton in 2015.\nVenue and broadcast.\nThe game was played at the Maples Pavilion in Stanford, California. The attendance for the game was 5,137. Stanford had played at least one tournament game at their own arena on a continual basis since the 1988 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. The Cardinal had won 59 straight games at Maples Pavillion. The game was televised nationally on ESPN and announced by Ann Meyers and Dave Barnett.\nSummary.\nStanford took the lead first on a three-pointer. However, Harvard would quickly take control, building a lead of 22-9 with 9:22 remaining in the first half. Stanford battled back with a 25-11 run to lead 34-33 with 2:42 to go. Harvard scored nine unanswered points to lead 42-34 at halftime, where they had kept Stanford to 31% shooting while forcing nine turnovers and outrebounding Stanford by ten.\nMelody Peterson narrowed the lead to one for Stanford with a three-pointer with 12:10 remaining in the game before taking the lead again with free throws by Heather Owen with 9:26 to go. The lead would change back and forth until the final minutes. With 1:33, Suzie Miller sank a jumper to make it 66-65 Harvard. A subsequent stop by Harvard led to Miller getting another shot opportunity, and she sank a three-pointer to make it 69-65. By the time of the last 28 seconds, Harvard led by five points and the game was essentially over. Leading the game was Allison Feaster, who had 35 points and 13 rebounds.\nThe Crimson won the game 71–67, making it the first time in the history of college basketball, both men and women, that a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed.\nIn the Crimson's next game, they would lose to the Arkansas Razorbacks 82-64, ending their cinderella run. It was the first and, until 2015, only victory by an Ivy League team in the women's NCAA Tournament. To date, no other 16-seed in women's college basketball has achieved such a feat. The feat was not accomplished by a men's college basketball program until 2018, when UMBC beat Virginia, 74–54."

        "text": "As a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) prohibits the use of banned performance-enhancing substances by competitors at the World Championships in Athletics. A list of WADA-banned substances is regularly published to the public and amended as scientific knowledge expands. The IAAF and anti-doping bodies undertake in-competition sampling of athletes blood and urine in order to detect where athletes have taken banned substances. This is also complemented by out-of-competition tests during the tournament and in the preceding period.\nWhere a banned substance is detected in-competition the athlete's performance will be annulled and—depending on the severity of the infraction—the athlete may be banned from the sport for a set period. Where an out-of-competition sample tests positive for a banned substance, any performances by the athlete after that date may also be annulled. Athletes may also be banned via doping regulations if the athlete fails to submit to testing, tampers or interferes with the undertaking of anti-doping procedures, or is found in possession of banned substances. Where a performance is annulled, any medals won by the athlete will be stripped from the athlete and the IAAF may decided to reallocate the medal(s) to the next best performers. This includes disqualification of whole national relay teams should one member break anti-doping rules. Samples are stored for future retesting, as improved methods over time may lead to previously unidentified cases of doping. The IAAF began a long-term storage approach from the 2007 World Championships onwards.\nA total of 162 athletes (69 men and 93 women) have had their results annulled at the World Championships, and 40 of these have been stripped of medals as a result. A total of 53 medals have been stripped as a result of doping infractions. The first doping failure pre-dates the main championships and comes from Spanish hurdler Rosa Colorado at the 1980 World Championships in Athletics – an event which only featured two women's events not on the Olympic programme. World champions to be banned include North American sprinters Ben Johnson, Marion Jones, Tim Montgomery and Kelli White. Other prominent champions to have been banned include Russian middle-distance runner Mariya Savinova, steeplechaser Yuliya Zaripova and racewalker Olga Kaniskina. The majority of stripped medallists have come from Russia.\nThere has been an upward trend in the number of doping violations at the championships, with a peak of 50 athletes having had their performances annulled at the 2011 event, though it is assumed that this reflects improved detection rather than increased overall doping – an anonymous survey at that championships revealed over 30% of athletes had used banned substances during their career.\nGiven the susceptibility of the sport of athletics to doping issues, the IAAF has been central in the development of anti-doping standards and anti-doping measures have been were present at World Championships since the first edition in 1983. The anti-doping approach had a new development at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics, where all Russian athletes were banned due to state-sponsored doping and had to request dispensation to compete at Authorised Neutral Athletes.\nDisqualifications by nation.\nThis table collates the total number of athletes who have been disqualified for doping at the championships by nation. Athletes with multiple disqualifications are counted as one. Where a relay team is disqualified, this is counted as one disqualification, though multiple team members may have been sanctioned.\n\"Last updated 17 March 2018\"\nDisqualifications by event.\nThis table collates the total number of disqualifications within a given event. Where the same athlete has been disqualified at multiple editions of the championships, each athlete disqualified per year is counted.\n\"Last updated 17 March 2018\""

        "title": "Awesome Golf",
        "text": "Awesome Golf is a 1991 golf video game developed by Hand Made Software and published by Atari Corporation in North America and Europe exclusively for the Atari Lynx. The first project to be created by Hand Made Software, players have the choice to compete either solo or against other human players using the console's ComLynx system on matches set in any of the three available countries across any of the game modes available. Its gameplay mainly uses a two-button configuration.\n\"Awesome Golf\" was developed by most of the same staff that would later go on to work on future projects for Atari Corp. such as \"Kasumi Ninja\" on the Atari Jaguar. Atari had plans to develop a golf title for their Lynx platform and Hand Made Software travelled to meet with the company in order to work on a title for a handheld game console, which Atari agreed and decided to trust their golf project to the latter after being impressed with the team's abilities.\n\"Awesome Golf\" was met with positive critical reception from video game magazines and dedicated outlets that reviewed the game since its launch, with reviewers praising several aspects such as the presentation, visuals, digitized voice samples, controls and gameplay, though some criticized other aspects of the title like the sound design. After its release, Hand Made Software would go on to develop five more titles for the Lynx.\nGameplay.\n\"Awesome Golf\" is a golf game similar to \"Top Player's Golf\" and other golf titles from the era, where players compete in matches on various golf courses set across three countries of the world. There are three game modes and multiple golfers to choose from at the main menu: Medal is the main single-player mode where one player participates in 18 holes. Practice, as the name implies, is essentially a training mode where players can refine their skills. Lastly, there is Driving mode. Before starting each mode, players can configurate a set of options on the menu screen such as the number of holes to play through. Players also have the option of consulting with a gopher caddie called Chipper for advices and tips in how to complete a course before hitting the ball during gameplay. Multiplayer is a heavy focus of the game, as up to four players can compete with each other by connecting four Atari Lynx units via the system's ComLynx port.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nAtari Corporation were already planning to release a four-player golf game for the Lynx as early as May 1990 under the title \"Masters Golf\", however it did not have a concrete release date. Its original internal working title was \"Lynx Links\", however Atari Corp. failed in registering said title, as the name \"Lynx\" was already in use at the time. Hand Made Software was a British studio founded in August 1990 by former Mr. Micro employees to focus on creating titles for handheld game consoles and recruited people with experience working in the video game industry, however the company had no project assigned to them but settled on working with the Atari Lynx. Two members of the company travelled to Chicago in order to meet with Atari to work on a Lynx project. Impressed with the team's abilities, Atari ultimately decided on trusting Hand Made Software with the development of a golf game that would later become \"Awesome Golf\".\nDevelopment.\n\"Awesome Golf\" was made by most of the same team that would later work on various projects for Atari such as \"Kasumi Ninja\" on the Atari Jaguar. The development was helmed by a small team at Hand Made Software with Atari producer Juliana Wade leading its creation, while both Jim Gregory and Rob Nicholson served as the game's designers. Jim and Nicholson also shared roles as artists and programmers alongside Chris Manniex and Val Gregory. Both Paul Tonge and Tony Williams acted as composers for the title and created the sound effects as well, among other people collaborating in its development like David Gregory providing the voice work for Chipper. Jim Gregory and the team at Hand Made Software recounted the project's development process in a 1992 issue of British fanzine \"Lynx User\", where they stated that Atari wanted a title which could appeal to audiences of all ages, as well as the controls \"to be quick to learn\" and realistic visuals instead of polygons as with other golf titles from the era.\nThe game was originally intended to feature only one area to play, however the team managed to generate courses with highly compact data structure, expanding the number of holes from 18 to 54 as a result. In addition, the team was aided by the University of Salford, who managed to provide materials necessary in order to accurately simulate the ball's flight and a total of three months of research, including consulting with golfers and video game players were spent into the project and after the mechanics were completed, the team focused on testing and adjusting the product. The team had difficulties implementing the ComLynx functionality into the project, as the game exhibited issues when Lynx systems were linked together, which led them on writing a custom code and routine to keep the consoles synchronized during multiplayer.\nThe team at Hand Made Software also had to develop a new zoom technique for the game as well, as the Lynx can only zoom into graphics of a certain size. During development, the cost for a 2 megabit cartridge was reduced, allowing the team to improve visuals and the inclusion of Chipper due to the increased memory size. The game went gold in November 1991 after passing through testing and debugging, with the team holding a wrap party to celebrate.\nRelease.\n\"Awesome Golf\" was published by Atari in North America and Europe in December 1991. Previews of the game featured different visuals compared with the final version released to the market, going under the name of \"Golf\".\nReception.\n\"Awesome Golf\" was met with positive reception. Robert A. Jung reviewed the game which was later published on IGN in June 1999. In his final verdict he went on to say \"This game captures the intricacies of the sport, while offering enough extras to enhance its appeal, though playing with friends can be a hassle. If golf is your game, Awesome Golf should not be missed.\" Giving a final rating of 9 out of 10.\nLegacy.\nAfter the release of \"Awesome Golf\", Hand Made Software worked on five more projects for the Lynx: \"Dracula the Undead\" (an adventure game loosely based on Bram Stoker's Dracula novel), \"Power Factor\" (a conversion of an unreleased Atari ST project by Red Rat Software titled \"Red Ace\"), \"Malibu Bikini Volleyball\", \"Jimmy Connors' Tennis\" (a port of NMS Software's tennis game featuring Jimmy Connors), and \"Battlezone 2000\"."

        "text": "The 2018 ITU World Triathlon Series was the 10th season of the World Triathlon Series, the top-level international series for triathlon, since its establishment in 2009. The season consisted of nine pairs of triathlon races for both a men's and women's competition, as well as three mixed relays, beginning on 2 March in Abu Dhabi, and concluding on 16 September with the grand final at the Gold Coast. \nMario Mola and Flora Duffy began the season as defending champions from the 2017 season. Mola would go on to defend his title and win the men's series for the third time in as many years, becoming the second-most successful triathlete at the world triathlon series after fellow countryman Javier Gómez. \nDuffy's season however would be plagued by injuries, leading to an inability to defend her title despite winning two races early in the season. The eventual winner, Vicky Holland, captured the women's series by moving into first place only after the final race of the series. The most notable event of the year was in Bermuda where the Norwegian team completed the first men's podium sweep, with race winner Casper Stornes having only competed in two prior WTS races.\nOverview.\nCalendar.\nThe 2018 ITU World Triathlon Series visited nine cities, and incorporated the three events of the inaugural Mixed Relay Series in Nottingham, Edmonton, and the Mixed Relay world championship in Hamburg.\nPoint System.\nFor every race a triathlete finished, they received points based on their position across the line. For a normal world series event, first place was awarded 1,000 points and every subsequent place was awarded 7.5% less, for the first forty triathletes; for the grand final, 1,200 points were awarded, once again decreasing by 7.5% for each place, but this time awarded down to 50th. However, if a triathlete finished outside the time cut (more than 5% longer than the winner's time for men, 8% for women), they received no points even if they finished in a scoring position. A triathlete's final score was the sum of their points from the grand final and their best five race scores of that year.\nOverall standings.\nThe athlete who accumulates the most points throughout the season is declared the year's world champion.

        "text": "The 2018 Belmont Stakes was the 150th running of the Belmont Stakes and the 107th time the event took place at Belmont Park. The race, known as the \"test of the champion\", is the final leg in the American Triple Crown. It is a Grade I stakes race with a purse of $1.5 million, open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The race took place on June 9, 2018, and was broadcast on NBC starting at 4 p.m. EDT. Justify won the race with a time of 2:28.18, becoming the thirteenth American Triple Crown winner.\nField.\nEntries for the Belmont were taken on June 5, followed by the post position draw. Justify was attempting to become the first horse to win the American Triple Crown since American Pharoah did so in 2015. He faced horses that he had previously beaten in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness, plus a few \"new shooters\" who did not compete in those races. His major competitors included:\nAudible, who finished third in the Kentucky Derby and would have been one of Justify's top competitors in the Belmont, was not considered for the race. Although the two colts have different trainers, they share common ownership (WinStar Farm, China Horse Club, Starlight Racing and Head of Plains Partners), leading some to conclude that the owners did not want to increase the pressure on Justify in his Triple Crown bid.\nRace description.\nThe 2018 Belmont Stakes was run on June 9 over a fast track before a sold-out crowd of 90,327. The New York Racing Association had decided to cap admission for the race after logistical difficulties at the 2014 event. The on-track handle, or total amount bet on the race, was $16,159,584, up from 2017 but somewhat less than bet in 2014 and 2015 – the last two Belmonts where the Triple Crown was on the line. The all-source handle for the race was $72,702,815, up sharply from 2017 but down compared to the record set in 2014. The race was broadcast by NBC. \nHaving drawn post position one, Justify risked getting trapped on the rail if he started poorly. Instead, he broke well and jockey Mike Smith sent him to the lead with a quick opening quarter of 23.37. Meanwhile, the eventual runner-up Gronkowski started poorly and trailed the field. Justify then slowed down the pace as they moved around the first turn, leading by two lengths over Restoring Hope. None of the other jockeys chose to challenge Justify for the lead, so he settled into an easy stride down the backstretch, completing the opening mile in 1:38.09. Around the far turn, Restoring Hope started to tire while Vino Rosso mounted a drive to move into second place. From farther back, Gronkowski and Hofburg also started closing rapidly. Despite drifting out slightly in the stretch, Justify held off the challengers to win by lengths over Gronkowski with Hofburg another lengths back in third. Justify completed the mile and a half in 2:28.18.\nThe win made Justify the 13th winner of the American Triple Crown, and just the second horse to accomplish the feat while still undefeated, joining 1977 winner Seattle Slew. It was the second Triple Crown win for Baffert, who also trained American Pharoah.\nResults.\nTrack: Fast\nTimes: mile – 23.37; mile – 48.11; mile – 1:13.21; mile – 1:38.09; miles – 2:02.90; final – 2:28.18.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (23.37) (24.74) (25.10) (24.88) (24.81) (25.28)\nSource: Equibase Chart\nPayouts.\nSource: Equibase chart"

It is the ice climbing equivalent of the IFSC Climbing World Cup in rock climbing. \nStructure.\nThe IWC is organized as an annual tour consisting of over three to six events throughout the year (the number has varied over the years), in which men's and women's lead climbing and speed climbing competitions are held. The lead climbing routes are held on largely bolted dry artificial surfaces (with some natural ice features) and thus employ dry-tooling techniques. The speed-climbing routes are on a standardized 40-50 foot wall of solid ice that takes seconds for top roped ice climbers to complete (as per speed rock climbing). \nOver the years, the UIAA has increased the regulation and use around competition ice climbing equipment, including the prohibition of leashes on ice tools (so they cannot be used as aid), and increased controls on the use of \"heel spurs\" while climbing (to counter their use for resting)."

        "text": "The Roosevelt Lakers women's ice hockey team represents Roosevelt University (RU) in Women's Division 1 of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) and in the Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association (CCWHA), following the absorption of Robert Morris University Illinois (RMU) and several of RMU's athletic teams, including women's ice hockey, that was finalized in 2020.\nPrior to the merger RMU, known as the Eagles, was one of the ACHA's historically-dominant programs, a status that included a pair of national championships (in 2005 and 2007), as well as a national-best five winners of the Zoë M. Harris Award as the ACHA's player of the year. RMU made 11 appearances at the ACHA National Tournament, a count that also placed near the top of the association.\nMason Strom was hired as the team's seventh full-time head coach for the 2018–19 season and the first year of the team's identity as the Lakers will be his third overall.\nHistory.\nRobert Morris University Illinois (2003–20).\nInstant dynasty (2003–08).\nRobert Morris College (as the school was known until May 1, 2009) added women's hockey to its athletic department for the 2003–04 season.\nThe Eagles, under head coach John Burke, quickly assembled a roster that featured stars like co-captains Leah Johnson and Krista Sleen, as well as Warroad, Minnesota product Lisa Gens. Beginning a trend in the program that continues to the present, the inaugural roster was geographically diverse, featuring players local to Chicago and Illinois, but also from places as far away as Texas and Washington. From the program's inaugural game, a 10–0 victory at then-home Glacier Ice Arena in Vernon Hills, Illinois against Notre Dame on October 10, 2003, RMC had little issue with most ACHA competition, losing within the association only to eventual national champion Wisconsin and emerging power Lindenwood during the regular season. The program captured its first trophy midway through the year by taking first place at the White Out Tournament, hosted by UMass and the first mid-season showcase event held within the ACHA's women's divisions. That title also led to Robert Morris' first-ever number one ranking in the ACHA polls, in Ranking 3 of that season. The Eagles would retain the top position for ten ranking periods, spanning two and a half seasons (a time-period reign that was eventually matched by Lindenwood from 2009–11 but has never been exceeded).\nAs the ACHA's top-ranked team, RMC was invited to the 2004 ACHA National Tournament, held in East Lansing, Michigan. However, the Eagles dropped their opener to No. 8 Colorado despite goals by Leah Johnson, Kathleen Johnson and Mindy Shelton, a defeat that eventually cost the squad a spot in the semifinals, before dumping No. 12 University of Pennsylvania and then tying No. 11 Penn State in a consolation game to finish sixth.\nAn already-strong team got even stronger in the seasons that followed thanks largely to its 2004 entering class, which went on to become one of the most decorated in ACHA history. Erie, Pennsylvania's Savannah Varner, the ACHA's 2006–07 Zoë M. Harris Player of the Year and an All-American in 2004–05, 2005–06, and 2007–08 headlined the group, which also featured NCAA transfers Crystal Zace (a goaltender from Bemidji State) and Jennifer Norris (a defenseman from Wisconsin–Stevens Point). Other standouts included Katie Kosobucki, another Warroad High School graduate, and Ashley Boye from the noted Belle Tire youth program in Michigan.\nFrom the 2004–05 season through 2007–08, the Eagles lost just ten games against ACHA competition, all against perennial contenders Lindenwood and Michigan State. That reality, in part, led to RMC frequently seeking outside challenges, most significantly from NCAA Division III and U Sports (then called CIS) competition. Throughout the 2000s, Robert Morris schedules generally numbered between 40 and 45 games, with the 2006–07 slate serving as representative: 25–2–1 in 28 ACHA games, 5–4–1 in ten games against NCAA squads, and 0–5–0 versus CIS foes.\nDuring the 2005–06 season, RMC traveled to Tallinn, Estonia to compete in a tournament against seven European teams, and hosted by the Estonian Ice Hockey Association in an effort to get the brand-new Estonia women's national ice hockey team off the ground. The Eagles beat Estonia by a 5–0 count in their tournament opener the day after Estonia defeated Iceland in their first-ever international contest. Thanks to Varner's hat trick, RMC routed British side Kingston Diamonds 8–0 to capture the title, after also defeating Coventry Phoenix (Great Britain), KFS Wildcats (Denmark), and a team from Riga, Latvia.\nStateside, the Eagles' dominance in the ACHA made invitations to nationals a foregone conclusion, with the season's success usually ultimately hinging on the last words against other top squads. The team qualified for the ACHA semifinals for six consecutive seasons from 2004–05 through 2009–10, with the first five of that run featuring championship game appearances.\n2005 national championship.\nThe 2005 ACHA National Tournament was held outside of Buffalo, New York, with the Eagles entering the competition as the top seed, and in Pool A with hosting University at Buffalo and North Country Community College. RMC opened by battering UB by an 8–0 count on March 10, 2015, a contest in which the Bulls were held to just three shots on goal, behind two tallies by Leah Johnson and three by Boye. Burke's charges didn't have much more of an issue in the pool and quarterfinal bid clincher against NCCC, as the team scored four goals shorthanded, three by Varner, in a 7–2 victory. The ACHA, at the time, played its quarterfinal and semifinal rounds on the same day, forcing the Eagles to follow up their pool wins by defeating two strong opponents with only about seven hours between games. Fifth-ranked Western Michigan opened the rigorous stretch by handing the Eagles their first and only deficit of the tournament on a Jennifer Goscicki goal just 1:27 into the game. However, two goals from Boye, and one each from Johnson and Mindy Shelton put RMC ahead 4–2 by the end of the first period on the way to a 9–3 win. That evening, a Crystal Randall shutout helped Robert Morris past frequent nationals nemesis Rhode Island and into the championship game by a 4–0 count. The final, against Michigan State, was also largely drama-free, as the Eagles led 2–0 within the first minute of play thanks to Norris and Varner. Zace largely shut down the Spartans from there, and the RMC onslaught wrapped up with a 7–1 title win.\nRMC's 2004–05 campaign remains one of the most dominant in ACHA history. The Eagles were the association's top-ranked team wire to wire, and were 20–0–0 against ACHA competition. Sleen won the Zoë M. Harris Award as the ACHA's player of the year, while Johnson was the national tournament most valuable player, and Varner, Boye and Johnson each received placement on the All-American teams.\n2007 national championship.\nThe 2005 national title game would prove to be an anomaly in terms of opponent, as each of the next four ACHA finals would feature Robert Morris-Lindenwood matchups. The Lions shut down RMC's repeat bid in 2006 with a 3–2 overtime win, but the Eagles recaptured the top spot in the rankings the following season with a late-season home sweep of LU. That flip gave Robert Morris the top seed for the 2007 national championships in Amherst, Massachusetts, where the Eagles promptly dispatched of Michigan and hosting Massachusetts in the pool round by a combined 12–1 count, thanks in part to Jessica Zalesky's three goals.\nThings became much tighter from there, starting with a 3–1 quarterfinal win over Norwich on March 9, 2007. Thanks to an early Sophie LeClerc goal, the Cadets (who were competing in their final ACHA season before heading to NCAA Division III) held a 1–0 lead until late in the second period. RMC finally got going from that point, tying the game through freshman standout Bridget Katz, then adding third period tallies by Varner and Kosobucki for the final margin. The semifinal contest, against a Connecticut team that had upset always powerful Michigan State in the quarterfinals, offered even more drama. Varner's interception-to-backhand goal put RMC up 1–0 in the second, and her assist of Katz with six minutes left in the third period gave the Eagles a 2–1 lead. However, the Huskies grabbed a 5-on-3 goal in the last minute of regulation to force overtime, and an Eagles penalty immediately after the goal put UConn right back on a 5-on-3, with a chance to end things. Zace stood tall on the opening rush of overtime, and Varner subsequently boosted her squad to the finals with a shorthanded goal that, as with her first goal of the game, was a solo effort beginning with a turnover near the Huskies line.\nThe championship rematch against Lindenwood was a bit less tense. Jackie Holmes and Ashley Ackerman gave the Eagles a 2–0 lead, and although Katie Kells made it 2–1 in the second period, Zace made a key save on eventual two-time ACHA player of the year Kat Hannah to keep RMC ahead. Katz scored shortly after that to restore the two-goal advantage, and Tricia Cain added a late clincher on the power play.\nVarner was named the most valuable player of the tournament, completing a rare double MVP season following up her Zoë M. Harris Award win. Zace captured first team All-American honors for the second year in a row, and she was joined on the top All-American tier by Kosobucki and Dana Paha.\nWeaver era and continued success (2008–14).\nRobert Morris endured its first significant era change in 2008, as the 2004 entering class that formed much of the core responsible for the 2005 and 2007 national championships graduated (or already had, in the case of transfer players). Furthermore, Burke departed midway through the 2008–09 campaign after five-and-a-half seasons behind the Eagles bench. He was replaced on an interim basis by long-time assistant Chris Chelios (no relation to the Hockey Hall of Fame player) for the remainder of 2008–09, before Tom Robertson became the permanent replacement.\nIf those disruptions hurt the team, it wasn't immediately apparent. The Eagles brought in a loaded recruiting class in 2008, headlined by Alaska native Ramey Weaver, North Dakota's Cassie Beckerleg and Californian Rachel Black. Those freshmen combined with underclass stars like Danielle McCutcheon and Hope Fullum to drive the program for the next few years. Despite the heavy graduations and coaching uncertainty, RMU maintained its position near the top of the ACHA during 2008–09 and 2009–10, never falling below fifth in the rankings, and making its fifth and sixth consecutive trips to the national tournament semifinals. Both seasons ended in loss, however, first with one more title game loss to Lindenwood, then with a narrow semifinal defeat to Michigan State.\nIn 2010, Robert Morris joined the Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association, ending the program's run as an independent team. With its CCWHA membership, RMU once again found itself competing for trophies with Lindenwood (which had joined the conference in 2007), although the reunion was short-lived, as the Lions left the CCWHA and the ACHA for College Hockey America and NCAA Division I after 2010–11, the Eagles' first season in the league.\nDuring the 2010–11 season, the Eagles added 5-11 Alberta native Mandy Dion - a Lindenwood transfer - that year, and Dion posted 79 goals and 122 points, both single-season RMU records (Dion, in fact, ranks sixth in Robert Morris career scoring, despite only spending one season as a player in Chicago). McCutcheon was just behind Dion with 120 points, and would capture the Zoë M. Harris Award that season, while Weaver added 93 points as the Eagles battered most of the competition in their new league, finishing second to Lindenwood during the regular season and losing only to the Lions within the CCWHA. However, in the postseason, LU defeated RMU in the conference semifinals and the Eagles failed to escape the pool round at nationals for the first time since their inaugural 2003–04 season, after losses to eventual national champion Michigan State and an ascendant Northeastern team that would go on to win the title in 2011–12.\nRobert Morris found its greatest CCWHA success in 2011–12 and 2012–13 under head coach Bud Hickey, winning the league regular season championship in both seasons (with a combined CCWHA record of 29–1–4), as well as the playoff title in 2011–12, with the playoff championship largely due to the play of Staci Pomering. Pomering, a goaltender who transferred from NCAA Division III's University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point, allowed just two goals across five games against Michigan (twice), Grand Valley State, Western Michigan, and Ohio State to win tournament MVP honors. That success vaulted RMU to the top spot in the polls heading into nationals for the first time since the 2006–07 championship season, but a 1–0 semifinal loss to Minnesota on a goal in the last three minutes of regulation stalled the quest for a third national title. The Eagles were still represented well during 2011–12 awards season, however, with Weaver's 67-point campaign good enough for RMU's second straight Zoë M. Harris Award - and fourth overall, surpassing Lindenwood for the most all-time. Hickey, in his first season with the Eagles women after three with RMU's ACHA Men's Division 2 squad, was the ACHA's coach of the year, thanks largely to the team's return to prominence after the hard-to-swallow ending of 2010–11.\nRMU's CCWHA tournament title defense failed in 2012–13 when Maria Barlow and Michigan State shut the Eagles out 1–0 in the championship game, while Liberty ended Robert Morris' ACHA title hopes in the semifinal round for the third time in four years thanks to Carrie Jickling's goal to win in double overtime.\nThe 2013–14 campaign started with a jolt as the Eagles ended up with two top players not with the team during the previous season. The first was Weaver, who had originally graduated in 2012 but returned after a year off to complete her eligibility. The other was Hayley Williams. Williams had been an NCAA Division I player at Bemidji State in 2009–10 but left the team and the sport after that season, attending the school for two more years before returning home to the Chicago area. She then volunteered to help out at Chicago Steel home games, and the USHL franchise sharing Edge Ice Arena with RMU at the time facilitated a chance meeting with a former teammate that ended with Williams resurrecting her career with the Eagles. Weaver and Williams were generally considered 2013–14's headliners (both were first team All-Americans and first team All-CCWHA selections, with Williams capturing RMU's record-extending fifth Zoë M. Harris Award), but heavy contributions from players like Chelsea Kasprick, Jessica Merritt and Madi Biluk once again made Robert Morris one of the ACHA's most explosive teams.\nOn February 8, 2014, Robert Morris defeated Grand Valley State 4–2, in an outdoor contest as part of a multi-game event dubbed the Winter Frost Faceoff and held at MB Financial Plaza (now Parkway Bank Park) in nearby Rosemont, Illinois.\nThe Eagles spent the entire season ranked third or fourth in the polls, and finished second in the CCWHA standings, behind a Miami team at the beginning of their own dynasty (the RedHawks would win their first national championship that season to begin a stretch of three in four years). However, things fizzled out quickly in the postseason: Michigan State and Michigan teams fighting for national tournament bids beat and tied RMU in the pool round at the CCWHA playoffs to prevent the Eagles from advancing to the semifinals, while an overtime loss to Adrian and a tie with Liberty delivered the same fate at nationals.\nFinal RMU seasons (2014–20).\nFollowing the challenging 2014 season, RMU entered a transitional period both on the ice and on the bench. After the Eagles missed the ACHA National Tournament for the first time in program history in 2014–15, Chelios (then in a second brief stint as the team's head coach) was let go, cutting a line of continuity to the program's early days. Jennifer Wilson was then hired as Chelios' replacement. Wilson was an accomplished player, including skating for the 2005–06 ECAC East championship team at Manhattanville College before playing two seasons at RMU, where she posted 49 points from 2012–14, and she had also spent time as an assistant coach with Saint Michael's College's NCAA program.\nWilson began rebuilding the team with a 2015 entering class that included standout defenseman Alex Nurse, cornerstone forwards Bria Berggren, Grace Dynek, and Madison Schultz, as well as a few star transfers like Allyson Zachwieja (Marian University) and Rebecca Dilley (Bethel University). That group joined a solid existing core including then-rising-sophomore Makaila Anderson, who would go on to be the number eight scorer in program history, as of the end of 2017–18. Rachel Arias and Emily Urban would add offensive punch among the 2016 entries.\nThe 2015–16 season proceeded with highs and lows typical of a young team, with highs including upsets of Michigan and Grand Valley State that boosted the Eagles to tenth in the rankings late in the season, in position to aim for a national tournament bid. The win over the Lakers was particularly noteworthy, as Dynek scored the winning goal on a 3-on-0 rush with just five seconds remaining, and GVSU wound up as the national runners-up that year. The season quickly crashed from there though - RMU not only missed nationals, but also missed the CCWHA playoffs for the first time since joining the conference, as the Eagles were edged by a single point by Davenport for the sixth and final spot. The following year saw measurable progress, as Robert Morris not only returned to the playoffs, but also upset Michigan to advance to the conference semifinals for the first time since 2013. Dynek, Berggren, Zachwieja, and Anderson all scored in the victory over the Wolverines.\nWilson left for the head coach job with NCAA Division III program Buffalo State after 2016–17, and she was replaced by Sonja Novak. Novak also came highly regarded in the hockey world, thanks largely to her time as a player with Princeton University and the Czech Republic women's national ice hockey team, helping the latter to win consecutive division promotions at the 2011 IIHF Women's World Championship and 2012 IIHF Women's World Championship (including seven points in five games during the 2012 tournament). Although Novak's first season was derailed late by a slew of injuries, RMU still qualified for the CCWHA playoffs for the second consecutive year. On November 10, 2017, at its hosted ACHA showcase, the Eagles toppled fifth-ranked UMass 3–2. After trailing 2–1 into the last six minutes of the contest, Katie Merrell tied things up on the power play, then Urban capped the dramatic victory with just 33 seconds remaining. Exactly one week later, Laura Noble delivered a 34-save shutout of Michigan, supported by goals from Nurse and Abby Cardew.\nHowever, Novak departed after a single season to join Wilson's staff, after the latter had left Buffalo State for Lake Forest College. Mason Strom, notable as the leader of the successful program at Fenwick High School, succeeded Novak as RMU's coach. The Eagles largely struggled through Strom's first two seasons though, finishing sixth in the CCWHA each time. Highlights of those campaigns included a 1–0 victory over eventual ACHA National Tournament participant McKendree on December 1, 2018 on the back of a Lauren Yomantas shutout, as well as a 2–1 victory over Davenport on February 23, 2020, thanks to Arias' winning goal with 3:44 remaining that allowed the Eagles to clinch the final spot in the CCWHA playoffs.\nRoosevelt University (2020–present).\nThe team will begin play as the Roosevelt Lakers for the 2020–21 season, with Strom and associate head coach Carla Pentimone continuing in their roles.\nACHA National Tournament results.\nThe program has appeared in the ACHA National Tournament 11 times, all while known as Robert Morris. The Eagles won national championships in 2005 and 2007, and had additional top-four finishes in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013. Their combined record in all games is 35–11–3.\nProgram records.\nAs of May 15, 2020.

Ashley Miller played from 2006–10, Crystal Zace played from 2004–07, and Jade Getz played from 2007–10.\nACHA ranking history.\nNational rankings.\nThe ACHA began compiling a national ranking in 2003–04, issued four times per season, with the top twelve (from 2003–04 through 2008–09) or eight (from 2009–10 on) in the final regular season ranking, released in February, receiving a bid to the ACHA National Tournament. A preseason ranking was initiated beginning with 2014–15. Beginning with the 2016–17 season, the ACHA tabulated rankings each week during the season and issued them on Tuesdays following weekends including games. The ranking methodology initially used a combined human voter and computer ranking process before moving exclusively to a computer ranking for the 2018–19 season, a development that eliminated the preseason ranking.\nRegional rankings.\nFrom 2000–01 through 2002–03, prior to the establishment of Robert Morris' program, regional rankings were the sole method for determining ACHA National Tournament bids. The inaugural 2000–01 season featured teams divided into East and West Regions, with the top four from each in February's final ranking invited to nationals. For 2001–02 and 2002–03, the setup was expanded to include East, Central and West Regions. Under that system, the top two from each region were invited to nationals, along with two wild card teams. In 2003–04, RMU's inaugural year, the tournament field was expanded to 12 teams, and a national ranking was introduced. The latter development diminished the importance of the regional rankings, as the national rankings were used to determine nationals bids. Regional champions were still awarded an autobid, however, even if ranked outside of the top 12 nationally. In 2004–05, growth in the number of ACHA women's teams resulted in an increase to four regions - Northeast, Southeast, Central and West - although things reverted to East, Central and West in 2007–08. The 2009–10 season was notable both for the fact that the tournament field was reduced back to eight teams and as the final year of the regional system, which had become largely antiquated as regional champions generally had little issue placing highly in the national rankings. Robert Morris was included in the Central Region for the duration of its existence within the regional ranking system.\nACHA national honors.\nAnnual awards.\nAll-Americans and All-Tournament selections including all seasons except 2008–09.

Notably, Crystal Zace became the first woman in the hall twice in 2012, when she received her individual induction following her inclusion as a member of the 2004–05 ACHA national championship team.\nWorld University Games selections.\nSince 2011, the ACHA has supplied players for the U.S. National University Select Women's Team, which competes at the World University Games women's hockey tournament, held biennially and as part of the multi-sport event for college and university student-athletes. Robert Morris had six players selected to Team USA, all for the 2011 and 2013 tournaments.\nThe 2011 squad, featuring Ramey Weaver, Becky Katz, and Rachel Black, finished fourth in Erzurum, Turkey by winning games against overmatched Great Britain and Turkey teams but losing to the more traditional hockey powers in Canada, Slovakia, and Finland. Even in defeat, a game against Finland during the round robin stage was likely Team USA's best moment of the tournament. In the contest, the Americans held a team featuring several members of the senior Finland women's national ice hockey team that had just won bronze medals at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics within a 3–1 score, including an empty-net goal (Venla Hovi and Annina Rajahuhta from that Finland team would go on to also win bronze medals at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics). Weaver had four points during the tournament to tie for fifth in team scoring.\nTwo years later, she was not only invited back to the team, but also named its captain, and was joined on the roster by Eagles Hayley Williams (who was an alternate captain) and Jessica Merritt. The trio helped Team USA to bronze medals in Trentino, Italy, a historic finish as a first medal for any American team in the modern era (USA Hockey resumed its participation in the WUG on the men's side in 2001 after a lengthy hiatus) and just the second overall, following the U.S. men in 1972 (who \"earned\" bronze medals by finishing third in a three-team tournament). Particularly, Weaver and Williams were among the team leaders, not only in terms of leadership roles, but also in offensive output - Weaver's eight points led all Americans, while Williams added five to rank fourth. Each contributed a point in the team's biggest win, a 4–2 victory over a Russia team featuring several Russia women's national ice hockey team members to open the tournament, while Williams (one goal, one assist) or Weaver (one assist) had a hand in every U.S. goal during a 3–1 bronze medal match win over Japan.\n2010 ACHA women's select team.\nAs a precursor to World University Games participation, the ACHA assembled a first-of-its-kind women's select team that toured Geneva, Switzerland, Chamonix, France and Méribel, France during April 2010. The team included Weaver, as well as Eagles goaltender Ashley Miller, as RMU player representatives. Its final record overseas was 2–2–0, including two close losses to the France women's national ice hockey team and two decisive wins over local club teams.\nRivalries.\nDavenport.\nAlthough there's a fair amount of contrast between the histories of the two programs, given that Davenport only started its team in 2013–14 and has yet to qualify for the ACHA National Tournament, the Lakers and Panthers have nevertheless developed a healthy feud in a relatively short time, primarily while RU was still playing as the Robert Morris Eagles. DU (along with fellow Grand Rapids, Michigan-area schools Aquinas College and Grand Valley State University) is Roosevelt's closest CCWHA competitor, and the two teams have spent much of the last few seasons jockeying for league playoff position. In 2015–16, Davenport knocked RMU out of the league playoffs for the first time ever when the Panthers pulled off a late-season upset of then-No. 4 GVSU to edge the Eagles by one point in the standings. During the season series, RMU did win five of a possible eight points from Davenport, although crucially, DU forced overtime through a Lexie Boydston goal with 22 seconds remaining on November 7, 2015. While the Eagles did go on to take that game thanks to an Abbey Revelle winner, the Panthers' point earned with the overtime loss wound up being the difference between the teams in the standings.\nThe Eagles got the best of Davenport in that regard on other occasions. The 2014–15 regular season, for example, ended with Robert Morris as the last team in the CCWHA playoffs, one point ahead of the Panthers. This occurred in spite of the fact that DU won the only series between the teams that year - although RMU made up for that deficit with upset wins over Michigan State and Adrian. The Eagles similarly made the conference playoffs in both 2016–17 and 2017–18 while Davenport did not, although the margins were more comfortably in RMU's favor on those occasions. One of the biggest games in series history occurred on February 23, 2020, a contest that had been postponed from January 11 due to snow. The new date at the end of the regular season multiplied the drama though, as it turned out to effectively be a play-in game for the CCWHA playoffs with the winner taking the sixth and final seed and the loser seeing its season end. After Ali Sinnett and Amanda Ballestero traded goals over the first two periods, RMU's Rachel Arias propelled her team to a 2–1 win with 3:44 remaining.\nThe teams have met once in postseason play, with Robert Morris taking a 9–3 CCWHA playoff win on February 21, 2014. Ramey Weaver scored four times for RMU, including twice in the first 10:07 of the contest and sandwiching a Madi Biluk tally, as the Eagles ran out to an early 3–0 advantage and never looked back.\nThrough the end of the 2019–20 season, Roosevelt owns a 13–6–2 series advantage on the Panthers.\nMichigan State.\nFrom independent national powers to CCWHA rivals, Robert Morris and Michigan State were frequently in each other's way over stakes both large and small, and both were among the ACHA's most storied programs with a pair of national championships apiece.\nThe first time the Eagles and Spartans met was also the most important: the 2005 national championship game, won by RMC in a 7–1 rout. Since then, however, the teams have faced off four additional times at nationals, all within a span of five years between 2009 and 2013. The first two of those, 2009 and 2010, occurred in the semifinal round. Robert Morris took the first of those by a 3–0 count, upsetting the second-ranked Spartans behind two Weaver goals and an Ashley Miller shutout. MSU got even the next year with a 2–1 win that snapped the four-year run of RMU vs. Lindenwood title games. In 2011's tournament, a 4–0 loss to MSU in the pool round helped stop the Eagles short of the semifinals for the first time in seven years en route to an eventual national championship for the Spartans, while 2013's pool round tilt went to the Eagles thanks, in part, to two Chelsea Kasprick tallies.\nOnce Robert Morris joined the CCWHA in 2010, it gave the programs an additional venue for competition. Michigan State, however, has won all four matchups to date in the league playoffs. Two of those contests took place in the same postseason, 2013, after RMU had won the conference regular season crown (and both CCWHA titles in 2011–12). However, Spartans goalie Maria Barlow shut out the always-potent Eagles twice in the tournament - once in the pool round, then by a 1–0 count in the CCWHA championship game.\nThe rivalry will have a decidedly different tone as the Lakers identity takes over, with Roosevelt rebuilding and MSU remaining one of the ACHA's top programs.\nMichigan State won the 2019–20 season series from Robert Morris by sweeping a pair of games in East Lansing, Michigan on January 25 and 26, 2020.\nLindenwood.\nAlthough now essentially dormant as a result of LU's move to NCAA Division I for the 2011–12 season, the Lions and RMU ruled the ACHA's top women's division for most of the 2000s.\nThe teams met five times during the first two seasons of Robert Morris' program, but the rivalry began in earnest during the 2005–06 season. That year, Eagles took three of four early-season meetings, but in the 2006 ACHA championship game - played at LU's home Lindenwood Ice Arena - Kristen Dlugos' goal 1:40 into overtime delivered the title for the Lions. That game kicked off a run of four straight seasons that ended with Robert Morris and Lindenwood playing each other for the title. RMU took the final victory in 2007, but the Lions emerged with the championship in 2008 and 2009, in addition to their 2006 win.\nThe 2008 championship game was a particularly notable moment in the rivalry, as Ashley Boye assisted on both Lindenwood goals to help LU recapture the crown with a 2–1 victory at Edge Ice Arena. Boye had been a star for the Eagles during the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons (winning the 2005 ACHA title in the process) before departing for St. Lawrence's NCAA Division I program in 2006–07. She then returned to the ACHA for that 2007–08 season, but with Lindenwood, where she helped defeat her former team for the title on its home ice.\nFortunately for Robert Morris, the transfer train ran both ways, as former Lions ace Mandy Dion headed to Chicago in 2010–11 and posted the most prolific single season in Eagles history, with 122 points. Dion would also subsequently serve as an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at RMU for five seasons.\nThe teams met for one final weekend in 2011–12, where Lindenwood, then in their first season as an NCAA program, swept a three-game series with RMU by 4–1, 4–1, and 6–0 scorelines. Those results gave Lindenwood an indefinite 28–11–4 series lead, although LU added a second team for the 2020–21 season following the dissolution of the team at the school's Belleville campus which will, in some sense, reboot the series during the Roosevelt era.\nPlayers.\nCurrent roster.\nAs of May 15, 2020."

        "title": "WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal",
        "text": "The WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal was a professional wrestling battle royal held at WrestleMania by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE. The winner of the match received the WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal Trophy. The inaugural battle royal was held during the WrestleMania 34 Kickoff pre-show in 2018 and was won by Naomi.\nThe match returned at WrestleMania 35 in 2019, won by Carmella. This would be the final match held as the battle royal did not occur at WrestleMania 36 in 2020 due to concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and although COVID restrictions were later lifted, no further matches have been scheduled at subsequent WrestleMania events.\nThe match was the female counterpart to the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, which was introduced at WrestleMania XXX in 2014. The WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal was originally named The Fabulous Moolah Memorial Battle Royal in honor of The Fabulous Moolah, who was billed as a pioneer of women's wrestling. However, her name was removed from the match after backlash from fans due to the controversy surrounding Moolah's past.\nHistory.\nFor WrestleMania XXX in 2014, WWE established the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal for the male wrestlers. After four years, on the March 12, 2018, episode of \"Raw\", the promotion announced a female version of the match to occur at WrestleMania 34. Prior to this, the only other women's battle royal to occur at WrestleMania was at WrestleMania 25 in 2009, titled the \"Miss WrestleMania Battle Royal\". It consisted of 25 participants, which included women from the active roster as well as returning veterans. The match was infamously won by male wrestler Santino Marella, under the disguise of Santina Marella.\nThe women's battle royal established for WrestleMania 34 was originally titled The Fabulous Moolah Memorial Battle Royal in honor of The Fabulous Moolah. The winner was to receive The Fabulous Moolah Memorial Trophy, made in the likeness of Moolah. After a controversy over their decision to honor Moolah, WWE changed the name to the \"WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal.\" The trophy was subsequently renamed and it was redesigned as a simple golden cup with tassels atop the trophy's base.\nThe inaugural match was held on WrestleMania 34's Kickoff pre-show and was won by Naomi, who last eliminated Bayley to win. The match was scheduled to return at WrestleMania 35 in 2019, thus establishing the match as a yearly tradition. This second match occurred during WrestleMania 35's Kickoff pre-show and was won by Carmella, who last eliminated Sarah Logan to win.\nA third WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal was set to have occurred at WrestleMania 36 in 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought many changes to WWE's programming during that time, the match was not scheduled to limit the number of wrestlers in the ring at the same time. WrestleMania 36 itself, which was WWE's first pay-per-view and livestreaming event affected by the pandemic, was relocated and held behind closed doors at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. COVID restrictions were later lifted, and while the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal returned in 2021, no further WrestleMania Women's Battle Royals have been held.\nName controversy.\nThe decision to hold a battle royal in honor of The Fabulous Moolah drew fan outrage. Tufayel Ahmed of \"Newsweek\" wrote that Moolah \"isn't quite the bastion of female empowerment she is proclaimed to be\", with \"years of allegations\" that she had \"monopolized women's wrestling in North America\", taken a large percentage of other wrestlers' pay, and \"sexually exploited women under her mentorship\". Jason Powell from \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\" criticized the tribute as it did not \"exactly mesh with what WWE [wanted] their women's division push to represent\". David Bixenspan of \"Deadspin\" pointed out that given Moolah's alleged abuses, fans were particularly turned off by WWE personnel describing Moolah as a \"trailblazer for women's equality\". WWE also promoted Moolah as having \"challenged the gender norms of a once male-dominated sport\", but Bixenspan described that Moolah, by wrestling and teaching her students an \"in-ring style low on athleticism and heavy on hair-pulling\", relegated women's wrestling to \"much more of a sideshow\" instead of a \"legitimate headline attraction\" in the previous era. Mad Maxine, a wrestler trained by Moolah, commented that Moolah was the most \"monstrous\" person she had ever met, and that wrestling is \"about generating heat. And you can't draw more heat than naming a match for The Fabulous Moolah\".\nOn March 12, a Change.org petition appeared online demanding WWE change the name of its upcoming Fabulous Moolah Memorial Battle Royal, nearing its 10,000 signature goal. Initially, WWE reacted by disabling the comments section of their YouTube video that announced the Moolah battle royal. Later, Snickers, the primary sponsor of WrestleMania 34, called the decision to honor Moolah \"unacceptable\" and said they were \"engaging with the WWE to express our disappointment\". On March 14, WWE renamed the match \"WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal\", removing Moolah's name from the event. The trophy was also renamed and redesigned."

        "title": "Rector v. Major League Baseball Advanced Media",
        "text": "Rector v. Major League Baseball Advanced Media, No. 303630 (N.Y. Sup. Bronx Co. 2014), was a New York Supreme Court defamation case. Andrew Rector sued Major League Baseball, the New York Yankees, ESPN and their MLB announcers for broadcasting images of him sleeping at a game at Yankee Stadium between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox and allegedly making defamatory comments about him. Rector sued for $10 million for \"defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress\". The case was dismissed by Judge Julia Rodriguez, who ruled that the statements made were not defamatory.\nBackground.\nOn April 13, 2014, Rector attended Yankee Stadium to watch the New York Yankees play the Boston Red Sox in a Yankees–Red Sox rivalry game. During the fourth inning, Rector was filmed by ESPN sleeping in his seat with the footage broadcast to viewers during their live coverage of the game. ESPN New York announcers Dan Shulman and John Kruk made a number of jokes about him when his image was placed on the stadium jumbotron. They initially commented that Rector was oblivious to the quality of MLB.tv that they had been promoting in commentary prior to Rector's image being broadcast and then made comments about Rector, questioning how he could sleep through a Carlos Beltran home run and stated that the person who sat next to him did not want to share his food with Rector. They also compared Rector's body size to Kruk's. MLB later posted the broadcast video of Rector sleeping online where it was covered by a number of media organizations worldwide. Rector filed a defamation lawsuit at the New York Supreme Court in The Bronx, New York against MLB, ESPN, the Yankees and the ESPN announcers for $10 million alleging that they subjected him to \"an unending verbal crusade\". Legal experts speculated that the challenge would not be successful owing to the statements causing emotional stress rather than damaging reputation and due to defamation cases historically being unsuccessful under New York State law.\nCase.\nRector alleged in his claim, which was reportedly full of typographical and grammatical errors, that the announcers had called him \"a fatty cow\", then used words such as \"stupor\", \"unintelligent\" and \"stupid\", and said that he was \"not worthy to be a fan.\" He also alleged that MLB.com had posted numerous memes, including one of him involved in a homosexual kiss and one with the caption of \"Yankee's Fan cares not for your rivalry talk\", that implied that he supported what was occurring in the images. He claimed that the MLB's posting of the video online \"set the stage\" for further defamatory comments from online viewers. The MLB's legal team filed a motion to dismiss on procedural grounds, as Rector had not stated a cause of action, and the statements in question had been loose and hyperbolic and not malicious defamation. The MLB, ESPN and the New York Yankees submitted CD copies of both the incident and the entire broadcast, which they stated showed that the statements alleged by the plaintiff were not made.\nIn court, Judge Julia Rodriguez granted the defendants' motions. In her judgement, she stated that the CDs of the broadcasts showed that the announcers did not make the statements alleged in the complaint and that they had been made by other individuals on websites not run by the defendants. While she agreed that comments had been made about Rector's weight and his ability to sleep through a standing ovation, he was only shown and commented on for 31 seconds; the judge ruled the comments made did not meet the legal standard of defamation. She also stated that ESPN had not broadcast Rector unauthorized, as it was common practice for broadcasters at baseball games to show spectators. Judge Rodriguez stated that with regard to Rector's claim of \"emotional distress\", none of the alleged comments were attributable to the defendants and they could not be held responsible for alleged defamatory comments made by third parties on third-party websites, as there was no duty of care to protect him from those statements. As a result, the case was dismissed.\nAftermath.\nFollowing Rector's filing of the case being made public, news organisations criticized the action as frivolous litigation. Legal commentators stated that due to the media attention that the case brought, Rector probably ended up causing more damage to his reputation by bringing the case than the initial broadcast would have. Rector's lawyer, Valentine Okwara had stated that he had advised his client that \"there is room for appeal\". The lawsuit has since been used as a case study on the issue of defamation at sports events."

He played college football at Texas and later West Georgia.\nCollege career.\nFollowing his time at Contra Costa College, Harrison was seen as a top recruit after being named to the All-American Community College First-team. Harrison joined the Texas Longhorns for his junior year, but was deemed academically ineligible to play before the season started. This was because Harrison had taken an online course at Brigham Young University during his time at Contra Costa, and BYU's school policy stated that student-athletes from other universities could not receive credit from online courses. The NCAA later cleared Harrison to play. Harrison later missed the entire 2014 season after he was suspended a total of 3 times. He was able to use this as a redshirt year, but he was not able to rejoin the program for the 2015 season. After leaving Texas, he spent two years away from football, and later joined the West Georgia Wolves for the 2017 season. Following his senior season at West Georgia, Harrison was invited to the 2018 Senior Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nAt the 2018 NFL combine, Harrison garnered attention after running the 40-yard dash in 4.9 seconds, the 2nd fastest of any offensive line prospect at the combine. He also recorded an unofficial time of 4.75 seconds. Despite a strong combine, he was not selected in the 2018 NFL Draft.\nCleveland Browns.\nHarrison signed with the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent on May 4, 2018. After an impressive rookie training camp, the Browns named Harrison their starting left tackle on September 7, 2018. Following the Browns' firing of head coach Hue Jackson on October 29, 2018, Harrison was benched by interim head coach Gregg Williams in favor of Greg Robinson.\nOn June 5, 2019, Harrison was waived by the Browns after a missed flight caused him to miss the first day of Cleveland's mandatory mini-camp, deemed to be \"one too many missteps\" for Harrison.\nArizona Cardinals.\nOn June 6, 2019, Harrison was claimed by the Arizona Cardinals, the day after he was waived by the Browns. A month later on July 17, the Cardinals released Harrison following news of assault allegations and a felony arrest warrant in North Carolina.\nPersonal.\nIn July 2019, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Harrison, who was charged with assault on a person by strangulation and assault on a woman by a man. He turned himself in to police in Greensboro, North Carolina on July 19, 2019, and was held at the Guilford County Jail. He was suspended for the first six games of the 2021 NFL season by the league on March 10, 2021."

By pushing the boundaries of technology, innovation and digital broadcasting, spectators at home would witness new and diverse angles, showcasing the world class athleticism of each nation's best players.\nFor the very first time, the FIVB, in collaboration with the sports marketing company IMG, would take complete control of content production, maximizing quality and promoting a compelling on-court narrative, easier for fans to engage with and understand.\nMarketing.\nThe International Volleyball Federation has partnered with global brand strategy and design firm Landor Associates to create the Volleyball Nations League branding. Landor has also contributed with in-stadium and on-screen television graphics, staff uniforms, designs for the World Volleyball app, medals and the winning trophy.\nDigital.\nMicrosoft, the multinational technology company, has signed an agreement with the FIVB that the international federation vows will change the way the sport of volleyball is consumed while heightening the fan experience during match days as well as in the digital space.

        "text": "Brandon Chase Marsh (born December 18, 1997) is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played in MLB for the Los Angeles Angels.\nBorn in Buford, Georgia, Marsh was a multi-sport athlete at Buford High School, where he won a state championship title as a junior. The Angels selected him in the second round of the 2016 MLB Draft, but he missed the 2016 season with a back injury. After debuting with the Orem Owlz in 2017, Marsh progressed through the Angels' farm system, including a breakout turn with the Southern League in 2019. When the 2020 Minor League Baseball season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Marsh was invited to continue his development at an alternate training site.\nMarsh made his MLB debut in 2021 as a replacement for injured outfielders Mike Trout and Justin Upton. After a slow start to his major league career, he improved offensively throughout the season. Marsh made the Angels' Opening Day roster in 2022 as part of a platoon of corner outfielders, but he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies partway through the season.\nEarly life.\nMarsh was born on December 18, 1997, in Buford, Georgia, to Jake and Sonja Marsh. A multisport athlete, he grew up playing American football, basketball, and baseball. Over four years at Buford High School, Marsh grew from to , and he only attracted the attention of college recruiters after growing into his larger frame. During his junior baseball season, Marsh batted .370 with 15 runs batted in (RBI). He and teammate Joey Bart, a future Major League Baseball (MLB) catcher, took Buford to a Georgia High School Association state championship title. The following season, Marsh batted .559 with three home runs and 25 RBI. Buford reached the state championship again, where they fell to Locust Grove High School.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues (2016–2021).\nThe Los Angeles Angels selected Marsh out of high school in the second round, 60th overall, of the 2016 MLB Draft. At the time, he had committed to play college baseball for the Kennesaw State Owls. Although he initially told reporters that he would not sign with the team, Marsh ultimately chose to forgo his college commitment, taking a $1.07 million signing bonus with Los Angeles to begin his professional baseball career. Marsh was assigned to the AZL Angels, a Rookie-level team in the Los Angeles farm system, but he was soon diagnosed with an asymptomatic back injury and spent the season on the disabled list. Instead, Marsh spent the offseason practicing in the Arizona Instructional League, the Dominican Republic, and the Angels' minor league spring training facility. Marsh made his professional debut with the Orem Owlz in 2017, where he batted .533 with eight runs scored and six RBI in his first three Pioneer League games. On June 28, only seven games into his professional career, Marsh sprained his thumb while sliding into a base. He missed one month with the injury, returning on July 28 and finishing the season with a .350 batting average, 22 extra-base hits, and 44 RBI in 39 games.\nMarsh began the 2018 baseball season with the Burlington Bees, the Angels' Low-A affiliate. After going 1-for-11 to start the season, Marsh went on an eight-game hitting streak, finishing April with a .299 batting average. After batting .296 with three home runs and 24 RBI in 34 Midwest League games, Marsh was promoted to the Class A-Advanced Inland Empire 66ers on May 18. He struggled with the transition to the California League, going 3-for-41 in his first 10 games, and at the end of May, hitting coordinators worked with Marsh to shorten his swing and improve his pitch contact. He finished the season batting .256 in 93 California League games, with seven home runs and 46 RBI in 371 at bats. \nThe Angels invited Marsh to spring training in 2019, and after batting .240 in the Cactus League, he began the season in Double-A with the Mobile BayBears. He struggled early in the season, batting .200 in his first 22 Southern League games, but improved to a .347 batting average in May after taking a more aggressive approach at the plate. After hitting .292 with one home run and 17 RBI in the first two months of the season, Marsh missed the month of June with a leg injury. He finished the season batting .300 with seven home runs and 43 RBI in 96 games, and he received both Mid- and Post-Season All-Star honors from the Southern League. Later that year, Marsh played for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League, where he batted .328 with two home runs and 11 RBI in 19 games. Both home runs came during Mesa's 9–5 loss to the Glendale Desert Dogs on October 14.\nEarly in the Angels' 2020 spring training, Marsh suffered a Grade 2 strain in his left elbow while diving to make a catch in center field. By the time that he was cleared to play baseball, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had shut down all MLB and minor league operations. MLB eventually returned to play in July, but the 2020 Minor League Baseball season was canceled in its entirety. As a result, high-ranked prospects, including Marsh, were assigned to alternate training sites to continue their development and await potential major league promotions. Working out of Blair Field, Marsh spent the season developing his hitting and learning how to play first base as a supplement to his usual outfield positions. That November, the Angels added Marsh to the 40-man roster to protect him from being taken by another team in the Rule 5 draft. Marsh suffered a glenoid labrum injury during the 2020 season, which he aggravated during spring training the following season. The injury delayed his spring conditioning, and Marsh did not make his season debut until May 13, when he joined the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees in the Pacific Coast League. Marsh struggled through the first few weeks of the season, batting only .183 in 16 games for Salt Lake. He left the Bees' June 1 game with a shoulder injury, which kept him on the injured list until July 8. Marsh hit a home run against the Sacramento River Cats on July 8, his first at bat after returning from the injury. He batted .382 with two home runs and six RBI in eight games before his major league promotion, giving him a season average of .255 in 24 Triple-A games.\nLos Angeles Angels (2021–2022).\nAfter injuries to Mike Trout and Justin Upton left the Angels with few outfield options, Marsh was promoted to Los Angeles on July 18, 2021. He made his MLB debut that day, starting in center field. He went 0-for-4 at the plate with two strikeouts in the Angels' 7–4 loss to the Seattle Mariners. The following day, Marsh recorded his first three major league hits, as well as an RBI on a ninth inning double, as Los Angeles lost 4–1 to the Oakland Athletics. On August 19, Marsh contributed to the Angels' 13–10 comeback win over the Detroit Tigers when he tripled twice in one game, becoming the first Angel to do so since Erick Aybar in 2011. Marsh's first major league home run came off of Marcos Diplán the following week, during the Angels' August 25 game against the Baltimore Orioles. Although Marsh plated three runs on the play, the Angels lost the game 10–6 to Baltimore. Marsh struggled early after his call-up, batting only .155 in his first 24 major league games. He improved as the season progressed, hitting .297 in the last 46 games of the season. He finished his rookie season batting .254 in 70 games, with two home runs and 19 RBI in 236 at bats.\nMarsh was named to the Angels' Opening Day roster in 2022 alongside Mike Trout and Jo Adell. Manager Joe Maddon planned to use Trout in center field while rotating Marsh, Adell, and Taylor Ward in the corner outfield positions. Marsh began the season on a hot streak, batting .340 with a .943 on-base plus slugging (OPS) by April 28. By the end of May, he was batting .366, including a .932 OPS with runners in scoring position. Marsh was one of many players to struggle during the Angels' 14-game losing streak in June, batting only .149 during that time. He did not hit a home run between May 7 and June 11, when he recorded two against the New York Mets to break his slump. Marsh played 93 games for Los Angeles in 2022, batting .226 with eight home runs and 37 RBI in that time.\nPhiladelphia Phillies (2022–present).\nOn August 2, 2022, the Angels traded Marsh to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for catching prospect Logan O'Hoppe. Philadelphia, who had lacked a long-term center field option, had targeted Marsh during the previous offseason, but were unable to acquire him until the MLB trading deadline. On August 17, during a game against the Cincinnati Reds, Marsh suffered a bone bruise in his knee and injured his ankle when he ran into the outfield wall at Great American Ball Park. He was placed on the 10-day injured list and returned on August 27. On August 31 Marsh hit his first triple as a Phillie in an 18-2 win against the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nIn the 2022 regular season he batted .245/.295/.384 between the two teams in 424 at bats, with 28 walks and 158 strikeouts.\nFor 2023, Marsh was the everyday center fielder against right-handed pitching and improved his offensive production, batting .277/.372/.458 and practically doubling his walk total to 59, with 144 strikeouts. In the playoffs, he played in 12 games and slashed .342/.405/.526 as the Phillies were eliminated in the NLCS by the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nPersonal life.\nMarsh's younger sister Erin Marsh was a track and field athlete for the Duke Blue Devils. She won the silver medal in the pentathlon at the 2021 NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships and the bronze medal in the heptathlon at the 2022 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships."

        "text": "Ryan Graves (born May 21, 1995) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman for the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL). Graves was selected by the New York Rangers, 110th overall, in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. He has previously played for the Colorado Avalanche and New Jersey Devils.\nEarly life.\nGraves was born on May 21, 1995, in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, to Ron Graves and Monica Brennan. He was childhood friends with Nathan MacKinnon, another Nova Scotia native, and the two would play youth ice hockey against each other on local teams and together on regional teams. Graves had a reputation in the Nova Scotia youth hockey circuit for clumsiness, caused primarily by his comparatively tall physique. His strength and shot-blocking abilities, however, drew praise from coaches in the Yarmouth County Minor Hockey Association. During the 2010–11 minor ice hockey season, Graves played for the South Shore Canadian Tire Mustangs, for whom he scored five goals and recorded seven assists. In addition to being named the team's top rookie, he was given the Scott Dee Memorial Award for the best rookie defenceman in the Nova Scotia Major Midget Hockey League. That same year, he made one appearance with the Yarmouth Mariners of the Maritime Junior Hockey League.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nThe Prince Edward Island Rocket of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) selected Graves in the first round, ninth overall, of the 2011 QMJHL Entry Draft. As a rookie during the 2011–12 season, Graves had two goals and seven assists for a total of nine points, as well as 34 penalty minutes. The Rocket, meanwhile, finished in last place in the league with a 19–43–2–4 record and missed the postseason for the first time in seven years. Graves said after his rookie season that he had difficulty adjusting from minor to junior ice hockey, and his improved confidence in the 2012–13 season was due to his greater familiarity with the league, increased playing time as a second-year skater, and his ability to learn from older teammates. He also practiced three times a week with a Newfoundland skating coach that helped to improve the coordination issues that had followed him from adolescence.\nAfter improving his offensive output in the following 2012–13 season, Graves gained the eye of NHL scouts, and was later selected in the fourth round, 110th overall, by the New York Rangers in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft.\nThe Rocket were rebranded as the Charlottetown Islanders for the 2013–14 season. In collecting 12 points in 39 games, Graves was dealt by the Islanders to the Val-d'Or Foreurs for their post-season push. He helped the Foreurs in the playoffs with 8 points in 24 games to help the club claim the President's Cup. On March 17, 2014, Graves' progression was rewarded as he was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Rangers.\nPrior to the 2014–15 season, Graves was again on the move in the QMJHL, traded by the Foreurs to the Quebec Remparts in exchange for Vincent Lanoue and draft picks on August 18, 2014. An assistant captain, Graves broke out offensively in his final junior season, contributing with a career-high 15 goals and 24 assists for 39 points in just 50 games. He was selected to the Canadian Hockey League's Memorial Cup All-Star Team after collecting five points in five games for host club Quebec.\nProfessional.\nNew York Rangers organization (2015–18).\nIn the 2015–16 season, Graves was assigned to the Rangers American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. He made his professional debut on opening night against the St. John's IceCaps on October 10, 2015. He collected his first goal and assist in a 4–3 victory over the Syracuse Crunch on October 23, 2015. As a hulking defenceman with good mobility, Graves was a staple on the blueline for the Wolf Pack and represented the club at the 2016 AHL All-Star Game, winning the hardest shot contest with a slapshot. With the Wolf Pack finishing out of playoff contention, Graves finished the season, leading the blueline with 9 goals in his 21 points in 74 games.\nIn the following 2016–17 season, Graves continued his upward development in leading the blueline in all scoring categories with 8 goals, 22 assists and 30 points. He was also named one of the Wolf Pack's alternate captains. Assigned to the Wolf Pack for the final year of his rookie contract, Graves regressed with just 4 goals and 11 points in 57 games in the 2017–18 season.\nColorado Avalanche (2018–21).\nGraves was dealt by the New York Rangers at the trade deadline to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Chris Bigras on February 26, 2018. He was immediately assigned to the Avalanche's AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage. He spent the rest of the season with the Rampage, scoring one goal and six points in 21 games.\nOn July 17, he was re-signed to a one-year contract by the Avalanche. In the season, Graves scored his first NHL goal on January 4, 2019, against the team that drafted him, the New York Rangers. He split the year between the Avalanche, and their new AHL affiliate, the Colorado Eagles. On July 8, Graves was re-signed to a one-year contract. During the 2019–20 season, primarily playing alongside eventual Calder Memorial Trophy winner Cale Makar, Graves in a top-pairing role scored career highs in both goals and points, and lead the NHL in the plus–minus statistic at +40. On October 12, 2020, Graves signed a three-year, $9.5 million contract with the Avalanche.\nIn the pandemic-delayed season, Graves made his 100th NHL appearance in a 3–2 overtime victory over the Anaheim Ducks on January 22, 2021. Used in a top-four role, Graves was relied upon as the mainstay of the Avalanche penalty kill, finishing third in the league in short-handed time on ice. He registered two goals and 15 points appearing in 54 of the Avalanche's 56 regular season games.\nNew Jersey Devils (2021–2023).\nOn July 15, 2021, due to impending expansion draft considerations, Graves was traded by Avalanche to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for Mikhail Maltsev and a second-round pick in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. In his first season with the Devils, he topped his previous career high in points with 28 while scoring six goals in 75 games. In his second season with the Devils, Graves scored eight goals and 26 points in 78 games.

The purpose of the test event was to see whether women's rowing should formally become part of the FISA-organised European Rowing Championships.\nWomen's test event.\nThe French rowing association (Fédération Française de Sociétés d’Aviron) organised the test event. Four countries sent teams; France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark. The four boat classes competed in were the single scull (W1x), double scull (W2x), coxed four (W4+), and eight (W8+). There were three boats nominated for the double scull, but all countries had boats compete in the other boat classes. Great Britain came third in all four races.\nThe women would have their second test event in Amsterdam in 1952. There were no European Rowing Championships that year as the Olympic Games were held in Helsinki, and whenever the Olympic Games were held in Europe the European Rowing Championships would be skipped. The same four countries competed in Amsterdam in the same four boat classes."

In September 2015, competition climbing was included in a shortlist along with baseball, softball, skateboarding, surfing, and karate to be considered for inclusion in the 2020 Summer Olympics; and in June 2016, the executive board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that they would support the proposal to include all of the shortlisted sports in the 2020 Games. Finally, on August 3, 2016, all five sports (counting baseball and softball together as one sport) were approved for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic program.\nCompetition format.\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics, two climbing events were contested: men's combined and women's combined. The competition format combined three disciplines of competition climbing: speed climbing, bouldering, and lead climbing. This decision caused widespread criticism in the climbing community.\nMembers of the IFSC explained that they were only granted one gold medal per gender by the Olympic committee, and they did not want to exclude speed climbing. The IFSC's goal for the 2020 Olympics was primarily to establish climbing and its three disciplines as Olympic sports; changes to the format could follow later. This tactic proved to be successful as they were granted a second set of medals for the 2024 Summer Olympics, where speed climbing will be a separate event from the combined event of lead climbing and bouldering.\nParticipating nations.\nThe following nations have taken part in the Olympic climbing competition. The numbers in the table indicate the number of competitors sent to that year's Olympics."

Spencer was the defensive line coach and run-game coordinator for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) from 2020 to 2021. He played college football as a safety at Clarion University of Pennsylvania—now known as PennWest Clarion.\nEarly life.\nA native of Hartford, Connecticut, Spencer is a 1988 graduate of Bulkeley High School, where he was a teammate of future National Football League (NFL) coach Eric Mangini.

        "title": "Overwatch World Cup",
        "text": "The Overwatch World Cup (OWWC) is an annual international \"Overwatch\" esports tournament organized by Blizzard Entertainment, the game's developer, with the first edition taking place in 2016. The tournament ran every year until 2019; after a three-year hiatus, the OWWC returned in 2023.\nThe tournament format has varied in each year, with the most recent one involving a preliminary stage in which national teams competed against others in a single-elimination tournament system to claim the five qualification spots in the group stages, which also included five national teams who prequalified via ranking. Top-ranked teams from the group stage advanced to a single-elimination playoff bracket at Blizzard's BlizzCon event every November. The first three World Cups were won by South Korea, while the most recent one was won by Saudi Arabia.\nHistory.\nAccording to former lead game director Jeff Kaplan, \"Overwatch\" was not developed with any dedication towards esports. Dan Szymborski of \"ESPN\" stated that \"Overwatch\" was poised as the next big esport for having a sufficiently different look and playstyle from established esports game like \"\" and \"Call of Duty\", enough variety in maps and characters, and strong support from Blizzard to maintain the game for a long time. Bryant Francis writing for \"Gamasutra\" noted the speed and short match times of \"Overwatch\" make the game highly favorable for viewership, further supporting the title as an esports. \"Overwatch\"s progression into esports was described by \"Rolling Stone\" as a \"strategy [that] involved carefully rolling out the game in steps – first a closed beta, then open beta, then full release, then a competitive mode and finally a league.\"\nIn June 2016, the esports organizer ESL announced that they would host the first international \"Overwatch\" competition in August 2016, called \"Overwatch\" Atlantic Showdown. The competition used four open qualifiers beginning in June, followed by regional qualifiers and then a final online qualifier. Eight teams then competed for a six-figure prize in the finals to be held at Gamescom 2016 from August 20–21. Turner Broadcasting's ELeague announced the first \"Overwatch Open\" tournament, starting in July 2016, with a total prize pool of $300,000, with plans to broadcast the finals on Turner's cable channel TBS in September 2016.\nIn August 2016, Blizzard announced their own \"Overwatch\" international tournament, allowing users to vote for teams to represent their nation or region. Over 3 million votes to decide national teams were cast. The inaugural \"Overwatch\" World Cup was watched by 100,000 people at BlizzCon 2016. The South Korean team won the tournament, defeating the Russian team in the final round.\nIn March 2017, Blizzard announced \"Overwatch\" World Cup 2017. The selection of national teams for the 2017 World Cup was different from 2016 in that participating nations were required to vote for an \"Overwatch\" World Cup National Committee. The National Committees were based upon nominations chosen by Blizzard; according to Blizzard, \"analysts, coaches, statisticians, and other authorities\" recommended rosters for all stages of the competition. Blizzard announced the 2017 World Cup participants in April. The 2017 World Cup experienced an issue with several players on the Chinese team being denied visas to enter the United States for the final round, causing four players on the team to be replaced by substitutes.\nFormat.\nPrior tournaments.\nThe 2016 format had four qualifying tournaments to thin the field for the final tournament, while the 2017 and 2018 formats used an average skill rating of each country's top players to determine which countries qualified for the tournament. Qualified teams were divided into round-robin style groups – 4 groups in 2016, 8 in 2017, and 4 in 2018. In every year, teams that made it past the group stages moved on a single-elimination playoff bracket.\nThe 2019 World Cup took place across three stages: preliminary rounds, group stages, and playoffs. A country's national ranking was determined by a point-ranking system based on final placements in the previous World Cups. Any country wishing to participate was eligible to play in the preliminary rounds, a single-elimination, seeded bracket. The top five countries based on their national ranking were not required to play in the preliminary rounds and received a bye to the group stages. The seeding was based on the national rankings, and the top five countries from the preliminary rounds advanced to the group stages. The Group Stages took place on November 1, 2019. The ten countries competing in the group stages were split evenly into two round-robin style groups. The top three countries from each group advanced to the knockout stage on November 2, with the top-ranked country from each group receiving a bye to the semifinals. The four other countries that advanced from the group stage would play in the quarterfinals. The winners of the finals would be awarded a gold medal, while the losers would be awarded silver. The two teams that lost in their respective semifinals match would play each other for the bronze medal.\nBroadcasting.\nThe World Cup was broadcast through live stream channels via the Twitch platform. Official live stream broadcast channels were provided in English, Chinese, Korean, French, Russian, German, Japanese, and Thai. Other languages were broadcast through community–run channels on the official Overwatch World Cup team page. Prior to the third edition of the event, Disney and Blizzard Entertainment announced a multiyear deal for coverage of Overwatch esports.\nAwards.\nAn MVP award for the Final Round of the OWWC had been awarded since the inaugural tournament in 2016."

        "title": "2018 Oregon State Beavers baseball team",
        "text": "The 2018 Oregon State Beavers baseball team represented Oregon State University in the 2018 NCAA Division I baseball season. The Beavers played their home games at Goss Stadium at Coleman Field and were members of the Pac-12 Conference. The team was coached by Pat Casey in his 24th and final season at Oregon State. The Beavers began the season ranked #2 by Baseball America and were unanimously selected by Pac-12 coaches to repeat as conference champions.\nThey won their third national championship by defeating Arkansas in the 2018 College World Series. It was only the second time in College World Series history that a team won the championship after losing their first game of the tournament and the first game of the championship series. The first team to do that was the 2006 Oregon State Beavers.\nSeason.\nOn March 11, head coach Pat Casey was suspended by the NCAA for 4 games as a result of contact made on March 9 with third base umpire Mark Buchanan while disputing a check-swing call against a Cal State Fullerton batter. Casey was ejected following the contact and the game resulted in the Beavers' first loss of the season 3–5. Associate head coach Pat Bailey led the team during Casey's suspension.\nEntering into the final game of the regular season against UCLA Oregon State found itself game behind for the Pac-12 crown. A win against UCLA coupled with a Stanford loss to Washington, who was also in contention for the league championship, would have given the Beavers their second straight Pac-12 championship. Oregon State would go on to lose against UCLA and Stanford rallied to win against Washington to give them their first Pac-12 championship since 2004.\nIn the postseason tournament the Beavers were selected as the #3 overall national seed, which guaranteed home field advantage for both the Regionals and Super Regionals. Only defending national champion Florida (#1) and Pac-12 champion Stanford (#2) were seeded higher.\nStatistics and accomplishments.\nSeason\nCollege World Series\nCollege World Series.\nOregon State vs North Carolina (Game 1)\nOn June 16, 2018, Oregon State dropped the opening game of the CWS to North Carolina by a score of 8–6. Oregon State was first on the board when Trevor Larnach tripled in the bottom of the 1st to drive in leadoff batter Steven Kwan. The Tarheels matched the Beavers 1–1 in the 2nd, before taking a commanding 6–1 lead in the top of the 3rd. This marked the first time all season Oregon State gave up 6 runs in the first 3 innings. A controversial safe call at third base in the top of the 7th helped sustain The Tarheels inning, when Beavers' 3rd baseman Gretler appeared to tag Tarheels runner Martorano, but was ruled safe. Instant replay would say otherwise, but the call was non-reviewable. Martorano was driven in by the next batter, increasing the Tarheels lead to 7–4. \nOregon State vs Washington (Game 5)\nOn June 18, 2018, Oregon State defeated the Washington Huskies in the first elimination game of the CWS by a score of 14–5. This marked the 4th meeting between the two conference rivals this season, with Oregon State leading the series 2–1. Washington took a 3–0 lead in the bottom of the 3rd, before giving up 4 runs and surrendering the lead in the top of the 5th. Washington was quick to respond, taking a 5–4 lead before a -hour rain delay in the top of the 6th. Washington walked in the tying run after play resumed in the 6th, and would be shutout for the remainder of the game. Lead-off hitter Steven Kwan injured his hamstring while at bat in the top of the 3rd inning. Kwan would sit out the majority of the College World Series, starting only the opening game of the finals against Arkansas.\nOregon State vs North Carolina (Game 9)\nOn June 20, 2018, Oregon State defeated the North Carolina Tarheels in an elimination game by a score of 11–6. The Beavers jumped out to an early 3–0 lead, before the Tarheels tied the game in the bottom of a 3rd with the assist of a controversial fair ball call. The hit drove in 2 runs and was deemed non-reviewable. Oregon State trailed 6–3 in the top of the 8th with 1 out, before Adley Rutschman crushed a base hit double to center field, driving in 3 runs to tie the game 6–6. The Beavers continued to pile on runs into the 8th inning, while shutting the Tarheels out for the remainder of the game. \nOregon State vs Mississippi St (Game 11)\nOn June 22, 2018, Oregon State defeated the Mississippi State Bulldogs by a score of 12–2. Mississippi State appeared to have the blessings of the College Baseball Gods throughout the tournament, staving off five elimination games before arriving in Omaha. Mississippi State quickly put up 1 run in the top of the 1st, and but failed to establish their presence for the remainder of the game. Oregon State went on a hitting frenzy with a barrage of runs in the 2nd and 7th inning. In the 7th inning, head coach Pat Casey sent his son, Joe Casey, to pinch hit for Tyler Malone. Casey dug a pitch out of the ground for a base hit over 2nd and his first CWS RBI.\nOregon State vs Mississippi St (Game 13)\nOn June 23, 2018, Oregon State defeated the Mississippi State Bulldogs by a score of 5–2. The Beavers scored all 5 runs with 2 outs in the top of the 3rd, the final three runs coming on DH Tyler Malone's home run. The Bulldogs appeared to have regained favor of the College Baseball Gods with a last minute rally brewing in the bottom of the 9th, as Oregon State pitcher, Jake Mulholland, loaded the bases with a 5–2 lead and Jordan Westburg at bat. Westburg was fresh off a CWS Grand Slam against North Carolina, and was looking to become the first player ever to hit 2 CWS Grand Slams. Westburg blasted a grounder to shortstop Cadyn Grenier, which appeared to be glued to the inside of Grenier's glove, before finding its way to 2nd baseman Nick Madrigal for the final out.\nOregon State vs Arkansas (Game 14)\nOn June 26, 2018, the Arkansas Razorbacks defeated the Oregon State Beavers, 4–1, in the opening game of the CWS Finals. The CWS Finals were scheduled to begin on the previous day, but were delayed due to rain, giving Oregon State an extra day to rest their bullpen. This defeat marked Oregon State's first loss to an SEC team all season, and the first loss to an SEC team since losing game 2 of the CWS Semi-finals to LSU in 2017. \nThe game was marred by a controversial interference call which lead to a double play and took a run off the board for the Beavers. Oregon State was unable to recover from the shift in momentum, going scoreless for the remainder of the game. \nOregon State vs Arkansas (Game 15)\nOn June 27, 2018, Oregon State defeated Arkansas 5–3 to even the series 1–1. Arkansas appeared in complete control of the game, and on their way to certain victory, when Arkansas missed a game winning pop-up foul ball off the bat of Cadyn Grenier in the top of the 9th. The ball fell between the first base line and the wall, with the first baseman, right fielder, and second baseman honing in on the game sealing pop-up. The second baseman, Carson Shaddy, bumped first baseman Jared Gates while running towards the ball, causing Gates to take his eye off the ball, Shaddy to overrun the ball, and right fielder Eric Cole to pull up. The ball landed foul between the 3 Arkansas players, giving Oregon State a second chance. Cadyn Grenier knocked in the game-tying run 2 pitches later. Trevor Larnach came to the plate with Arkansas still in shock, boasting the most home runs of the season for the Beavers, and hit a two-run shot over the head of Cole to win the game, 5–3.\nOregon State vs Arkansas (Game 16)\nOn June 28, 2018, Oregon State defeated Arkansas, 5–0, to win their third College World Series championship. Oregon State pitcher Kevin Abel worked himself into a jam in the top of the 3rd, loading the bases with one out against the Razorbacks, before going on to retire 20 batters in a row. Abel became the first pitcher to win four games in the CWS, and two games in the CWS Finals. He pitched only the 4th complete game shutout in a championship game, with the lowest hit total of those games (2). Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman set the CWS hits record during this game, with 17 hits. Rutschman won the CWS Most Outstanding Player Award.\nMajor League Baseball Draft.\nIn the 2018 Major League Baseball draft Nick Madrigal became the highest draft pick in Oregon State history when the Chicago White Sox selected him with the 4th pick of the 1st Round. The previous record holder was Michael Conforto, who was selected 10th overall by the New York Mets in the 2014 MLB draft.\nPitcher Drew Rasmussen, who missed the entire 2018 season due to undergoing his second Tommy John surgery, was originally selected 31st overall in the 2017 MLB draft by the Tampa Bay Rays but was unable to come to terms with the team before the July 7th deadline. He was later denied free agency by Major League Baseball.\nTwo-time Pac-12 Pitcher of the Year, Luke Heimlich, went undrafted for the second straight year. The Texas Rangers announced a month before the draft that they would not select the winningest pitcher in Oregon State history after it was revealed Heimlich pled guilty to sexually molesting a family member when he was 15. Heimlich has since denied the allegations to which he pled guilty as a juvenile saying the guilty plea was \"a decision me and my parents thought was the best option to move forward as a family.\""

He played college basketball for the UCF Knights and the Florida Gulf Coast Eagles, being named the 2018 ASUN Conference Player of the Year with the latter.\nCollege career.\nGoodwin, a 6’0” point guard, committed to UCF from Norcross High School.

He left UCF after being caught taking (though later returning) a bike on campus the summer after his freshman year.\nGoodwin landed at Florida Gulf Coast (FGCU) after leaving UCF. After sitting out a season as a transfer, he averaged 18.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game and was named ASUN Conference Newcomer of the Year. He then led the Eagles to an NCAA Tournament berth after earning Atlantic Sun tournament MVP honors.\nFollowing his junior season, Goodwin declared for the 2017 NBA draft without signing with an agent, ultimately deciding to return to FGCU for his senior year.\nIn his senior year, Goodwin led the Eagles to a regular season Atlantic Sun championship and was named first-team All-Atlantic Sun and the Atlantic Sun Player of the Year. He averaged 18.6 points, 5.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.4 steals per game as a senior.\nProfessional career.\nMemphis Hustle (2018).\nAfter going undrafted in the 2018 NBA draft, Goodwin signed with the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2018 NBA Summer League.

Goodwin was subsequently added to the roster of the Grizzlies’ NBA G League affiliate, the Memphis Hustle. In nine appearances with the Hustle, Goodwin averaged 23.4 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4 assists per game.\nDenver Nuggets (2018–2019).\nOn November 29, 2018, Goodwin was signed by the Denver Nuggets. The Nuggets were granted an injury hardship relief exception from the NBA, allowing them to add Goodwin to their otherwise full roster. He was waived on December 10, without appearing in any games.\nOn December 13, 2018, the Memphis Hustle announced that Goodwin had returned to their team. Three days later the Nuggets re-signed Goodwin to a two-way contract.\nAtlanta Hawks (2019–2021).\nOn August 6, 2019, Goodwin signed a two-way contract with the Atlanta Hawks.

Goodwin initially blamed a COVID vaccination for his condition but later indicated he wasn't sure.\nA study led by the University of Buffalo in February 2023 showed blood clots are more likely to be from COVID itself rather than any vaccination.\nWestchester Knicks (2021).\nOn October 14, Goodwin was signed by the New York Knicks, who waived him the next day. In October 2021, he joined the Westchester Knicks as an affiliate player. He averaged 15.3 points, 5.1 rebounds, 7.0 assists and 1.9 steals per game.\nCleveland Cavaliers (2021–2022).\nOn December 31, 2021, Goodwin signed a 10-day contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers via the hardship exemption.

It was recorded in 2001 and released on the HighNote label in 2003.\nReception.\nIn his review on AllMusic, Scott Yanow writes: \"Although veteran tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards was having serious health problems by 2001, he is in excellent form throughout this set, showing no signs of decline or age. Playing in New York with a top-notch quartet that includes pianist Richard Wyands, Edwards caresses some of the melodies (his long tones are impressive), he swings hard in spots, and he shows great affection for the material. ... Throughout, Teddy Edwards shows that in 2001 he was still in his musical prime.\"\nOn All About Jazz, Terrell Kent Holmes called it \"a fine example of economical playing and arrangement\" and noted \"Edwards, now approaching 80 years old, shows on \"Smooth Sailing\" that he's as formidable a sax man as ever. More power to any septuagenerian who swings.\"\nThe authors of \"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings\" stated that Edwards \"was in failing health\" when the album was recorded, \"but you wouldn't know it... Even at this age and even seriously ill, Teddy was able to swing a line with the best of them.\"\nDavid Franklin of Jazz Times commented: \"\"Smooth Sailing\"... shows that [Edwards'] buoyant sense of swing and tender way with a ballad remain intact. Not surprising for a man of his age, his intonation is occasionally insecure... but that aside, these eight performances are remarkable for someone of his years.\""

        "text": "The Troy Trojans women's tennis team represents Troy University and plays in the Sun Belt Conference. All home matches are played at the 12-court Jimmy Lunsford Tennis Complex on Troy's campus.\nHistory.\nThe women's tennis team began playing in the 1980s, and because of a lack of record keeping during that time, the exact year it was founded is unknown, as well as the yearly records.\nIn 1995, the Trojan women won their first conference tournament title while a member of the Mid-Continent Conference. That same year, player Claire Mowling was named the Mid-Con Newcomer of the Year.\nAfter becoming a member of the Atlantic Sun Conference in the late 1990s, the women again went on to win another conference in 2004 under head coach Eric Hayes. That year, the women made it to the finals of the Atlantic Sun Tournament, defeating UCF by a score of 4–2. They would receive the automatic bid to play in their first ever NCAA Tournament, matching up with #5 Clemson. The Trojans would be defeated by the Tigers, 4–0.\nThe Trojans program moved from the Atlantic Sun Conference to the Sun Belt Conference for the 2005 season. In 2006, just Troy's second season of being in the Sun Belt Conference, the women's team won the consolation bracket of the Sun Belt Tournament and finished the season with a 16–5 record and a #68 national ranking, their highest final ranking of Eric Hayes tenure as head coach. The doubles duo of Tsitsi Masviba and Claudia Strauss finished their 2006 campaign as the #55 doubles team in the country, going 13–6 during the 2006 season. The Lady Trojans followed that up in 2007 with another winning season, going 13–9 with a national ranking of #72.\nHayes would lead the program to more successful seasons afterwards, accumulating a record of 74–56 between 2008 and 2013 and only having one season with a losing record in that span. In 2013, Hayes' last season as head coach, he coached the women's team to a 17–6 record, putting together a 12-game win streak that was the third-longest win streak in the country during the 2013 season. Troy entered the Sun Belt Tournament as the #3-seed, but was upset by #6-seed Middle Tennessee in the quarterfinals.\nRawia Elsisi, a former Troy women's tennis player, was hired in 2014 as the next head coach for the team. In her first season at the helm, she led the Trojans to a 15–8 record that included a win over then #72-ranked Nicholls State and received the #4-seed in the Sun Belt Tournament. Troy defeated Texas State in the quarterfinals of tournament, only to drop their semifinal match to #66 Georgia State.\nIn 2018, Troy garnered their first ever #1-seed into the Sun Belt Tournament by way of a 4–2 conference record during the season, despite finishing the regular season with an 8–10 record. Troy had gone a 6-game win streak toward the end of the season, which included a 4–3 win over eventual Sun Belt champion Georgia State. The Trojans won their first round match of the Sun Belt Tournament against #9-seed Georgia Southern but lost their semifinal match to #4-seed South Alabama.\nITA Final Rankings.\nSource:"

The independent Vandals were led by third-year head coach Joe Cipriano, and played their home games on campus at the Memorial Gymnasium, in Moscow, Idaho.\nIn his only season with the Vandals, forward/center Gus Johnson was a Northwest sensation, and led the team to a record. Under the NCAA rules of the era, junior college transfers that had previously attended a four-year college were not allowed to play in tournaments during their first season at the new (third) At the Far West Classic in Portland in late December, Idaho lost two of three games without him. With Johnson on the floor, the team was entering the final weekend, but dropped two in Seattle.\nLed by leading scorer Chuck White and Johnson, the Vandals were at their best in their main rivalries from the old Pacific Coast Conference: versus Oregon, versus Palouse neighbor Washington State, and against Washington. The primary nemesis was Seattle University, led by guard Eddie Miles, who swept all three games, half of UI's losses. Idaho dropped its only game with Oregon State at the Far West without Johnson, but won all three with Gonzaga, for a record against its four former PCC foes and a collective against the six Northwest rivals. In the last season before the Big Sky Conference, the Vandals were undefeated in ten games against those teams; this included a sweep of Idaho State for the King Spud Trophy and unofficial state title.\nAttendance at the Memorial Gym was consistently over-capacity, with an estimated 3,800 for home games in the cramped of WSU on December 20 caused the region to take The teams met nine days later in Portland without Johnson, and Idaho had to rally from behind to win by Johnson and center Paul Silas of Creighton waged a season-long battle to lead the NCAA in rebounding. Silas claimed this by averaging 20.6 per game, 0.3 more than In February, a low-profile article in \"Sports Illustrated\" introduced the team to the nation.\nDespite their record, the Vandals were not invited to the post-season. The NCAA tournament included only 25 teams and Oregon State and Seattle U. were selected from the Northwest. The NIT invited just twelve teams, with none from the Mountain or Pacific time zones. If Idaho had been invited, Johnson was ineligible to participate.\nAftermath.\nThat spring, 24-year-old Johnson was the tenth overall selection in the 1963 NBA draft and went on to a hall of fame career with the Baltimore Bullets. Cipriano also moved on to coach at Nebraska for seventeen until his death. Without Johnson (and White), the Vandals fell to in and were in the new Big Sky Conference, fifth place in the six-team league. They had a dismal record through and lost every game against their Northwest rivals, a collective vs UW, WSU, UO, OSU, Seattle U., and Gonzaga.\nHigh scorer White became a hall of fame high school head coach in Anchorage, Alaska; but both Cipriano and Johnson died before age fifty, due to Team captain Lyle Parks earned a degree in chemical engineering, and sophomore Chuck Kozak graduated from the UI's law school "
