When Princeton headed into the winter break they did so with seven games on the slate. To help the team navigate its way through, two-year captain Afton Zaniser returned to coach the team. After a rough start the trip turned out remarkably well for the Tigers with the team winning three out of four in Cleveland. While the team had begun the season with Douglas Ballin in net they had found greater success when Peacock took over the role.\nAfter the jam-packed schedule Princeton had little time to rest before beginning their conference schedule but still started with a win over Columbia. The Tigers weren't able to keep up with the remainder of the IHA, however, and lost their remaining conference games to finish in a tie for 3rd place. On a positive note, Princeton played its first true home game against Lawrenceville School, winning a weather-shortened match on Lake Carnegie.\nFrederic Leake and Joshua Brush served as team managers.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

He joined the Castleford Tigers development system aged 14.\nPlaying career.\nCastleford Tigers.\nOn 7 February 2020, Hall made his Super League début for the Castleford Tigers (Heritage No. 998) against the Wigan Warriors. He had been preparing to play for Castleford's reserves, but injuries to teammates saw him drafted into the first team aged 17. Weeks later, he signed full-time with the Tigers on a 2-year contract.\nAhead of the 2021 season, Hall aimed for further Super League experience, and said, \"it's a hard, hard challenge to break through with the talent of the older players, but if I get a chance I've just got to take it and play as well as I can.\" Hall made three further first-team appearances for Castleford that year, as well as standout performances for the under-19s. He signed a one-year contract extension in October 2021.\nIn June 2022, Hall signed a two-year contract extension at Castleford, keeping him with the Tigers until the end of 2024. He said, \"I feel very much at home, I like the environment and the players. There was never any doubt - I wanted to stay here.\" Head coach Lee Radford added, \"Sam has a smart football IQ and a great skill set. He plays in a position where there is a genuine pathway for him at the club.\"\nThe 2023 season was a breakout personal year for Hall, as he established himself a regular place in Castleford's first-team from April.

        "title": "Illinois–Iowa men's basketball rivalry",
        "text": "The Illinois–Iowa men's basketball rivalry is an intra-Big Ten Conference, college sports rivalry between the Illinois Fighting Illini and Iowa Hawkeyes. Multiple factors have played into the creation of the games between the two schools; Illinois and Iowa share a state border and are located about apart, and they share recruiting ground. The rivalry has been evidenced both on the court and off the court. Among the off the court elements of the rivalry, recruiting of basketball talent has resulted in battles for specific athletes. The most notable battle turned into the Pearl/Thomas Incident which began when both schools sought the services of Deon Thomas and resulted in recruiting restrictions and a one-year post-season ban for Illinois.\nHistory.\nIllinois and Iowa first met on February 14, 1908 with an Iowa victory, 46–36. The teams would not meet again until 1913 in Urbana, Illinois, however, after 1924 the teams would play every year with the exception of six seasons. Since the two teams are both in the Big Ten Conference, they meet at least once per season. The location of the game alternates between State Farm Center, formerly Assembly Hall, in Champaign, and in Iowa City at Carver-Hawkeye Arena. There have only been a total of five neutral site games in this series. Illinois leads the series 91-77.\nPearl/Thomas incident.\nIn 1986 head coach Tom Davis took over an Iowa team from George Raveling that included two key forwards, Ed Horton and Kevin Gamble, each from Lanphier High School in Springfield, Illinois. Utilizing the success of those players, Bruce Pearl, assistant coach and key recruiter for Iowa, was working the state of Illinois to acquire Deon Thomas, a highly talented Chicago Public League player from Simeon High School. Simultaneously, Jimmy Collins, assistant coach to Lou Henson and the Fighting Illini, was also attempting to acquire Thomas. Pearl brought allegations to the NCAA that Illinois assistant coaches had acted improperly in the recruitment of Thomas, including secretly tape-recorded phone conversations with Thomas that were used in the investigation. While the allegations of improper conduct were unfounded by the NCAA, the investigation did uncover other violations that cost the University of Illinois with restrictions in football and basketball in the manner of limiting scholarships, recruiting and tournament participation.\nColeman/McCaffery Incident.\nIn a game played in Iowa City on February 2, 2020, after an intensely physical game which saw 14 lead-changes and 8 ties, the Hawkeyes would come out on top with a final score of 72–65. During the closing seconds of the game, with Illinois' defense willing to let the final 12 seconds expire, sophomore guard Joe Wieskamp dunked to extend the Iowa lead to 10 points. This appeared to agitate the Illini players and, after a 3-point field goal by Illinois guard Ayo Dosunmu, with four seconds left, the Hawkeyes in-bounded the ball to C. J. Fredrick and it appeared that Illinois was trying to intentionally foul. Fredrick kicked it out to Connor McCaffery, who was hugged by Dosunmu. Mike Eades, an official for the game, elected not to call the foul as the clock expired. The exchanges between both teams spilled over into the post-game handshake line when Illinois assistant coach Ron Coleman took exception to Joe Wieskamp's dunk with 12 seconds left to give the Hawkeyes a double-digit lead. Coleman shouted profanities in the direction of coach McCaffery, leading the coach to shout back at Coleman and instruct his Hawkeyes to head to the locker room, skipping the handshake line. The Illini staff eventually held their players near the scorer's table to let the Iowa players get to the tunnel to the locker room and off the court.\nTicket scandal.\nOn February 1, 2023, a student spirit group known as \"Orange Krush\" from the University of Illinois, had 200 tickets to the game taking place on February 4, 2023 at Carver-Hawkeye Arena, rescinded with the $5,400 purchase price returned to the organization. The reason for the denial was due to the leader of the \"Orange Krush\" claiming they were being purchased for the Boys and Girls Club of Champaign, a non-profit organization who would get a discounted rate for the 200 tickets. The Iowa Athletic Department deemed this purchase to be under false pretenses, allowing them the right to deny the \"Orange Krush\" the opportunity to enter the game and barcodes for the tickets blocked, thus denying them the attempt to make the 20th annual road trip for the group. Because the order was made in September 2022, the \"Orange Krush\" had procured donations that could be utilized for charter bus transportation from Champaign to Iowa City. The denial of entry cost the \"Orange Krush\" $6,000 that had been paid towards the prearranged transportation. As for the 200 tickets retained by the Iowa Athletic Department, those were donated to the Boys and Girls Club of Cedar Rapids.\nOther.\nOccasional feuds and incidents between the schools' programs have fueled the competition over the years. Iowa has the advantage in the history of the Big Ten tournament. Of the 20+ years the conference tournament has been held, Illinois and Iowa have played a total of 5 times. Iowa holds the record of 3-2 over Illinois. In the 2016 Big Ten tournament the Hawkeyes were the fifth seed and the Illini, who were seeded twelfth, faced each other in the second round with Illinois upsetting Iowa 68–66. Illinois and Iowa squared off in the 2021 Big Ten tournament championship game where Illinois would win their third tournament title.\nAccomplishments by the two rivals.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs.\nGame results.\nGames with both teams ranked.\nWinning team is shown.

Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts (two alternates could be entered—in 1952, all eight gymnasts competed). All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus.

The 12 team exercise scores were summed to give a team total.\nNo separate finals were contested.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, apparatus scores from 0 to 20, individual totals from 0 to 120, and team scores from 0 to 600.

The eight team exercise scores were summed, along with the team portable apparatus event score, to give a team total.\nNo separate finals were contested.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, apparatus scores from 0 to 20, individual totals from 0 to 80, team exercise scores from 0 to 50, portable apparatus scores from 0 to 80, and team total scores from 0 to 480.\nResults.\nThe Soviet team won the gold medal, the Hungarian team won the silver, and the Romanian team won the bronze."

        "text": "The 1909–10 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey season was the 11th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nPrinceton returned few players from the previous year's team and used its early-season games essentially as live practices for the new players. With mostly inexperienced lineups the Tigers were outmatched against amateur clubs with more veteran rosters. Even in large defeats, however, team captain Clarence Peacock's goaltending was in fine form. The team decided on its starting roster and went into their holiday break with a slate of five games before the IHA season started. Despite the early games Princeton was still sluggish at the start of their trip, losing both games in New York. The team finally began to pull together in their three-game series against Yale, taking two out of three games.\nThe Tigers opened their conference schedule with Cornell's first game as a member. The two teams fought a tough match that required two extra periods to decide the winner but it the lone goal came from Kay to give Princeton the win. After defeating Dartmouth the Tigers entered the game against Harvard with a chance to take a commanding lead in the IHA. With a stellar defensive effort, Princeton handed the Crimson just the second shutout in program history and took the match 3–0. After dropping Columbia Princeton was one game away from their second championship and while it was their last game, by a quirk of the schedule, Yale had yet to play a conference match. If they lost the game to the Elis it could mean surrendering the crown if Yale were to sweep the remainder of their games. Two goals from Kay provided all the offense the Tigers needed and with the 2–1 victory Princeton was the Intercollegiate Hockey Association champion yet again.\nAfter the season, eight members of the team were awarded athletic letters by the university, making this the first ice hockey team in school history to have lettermen.\nR. W. Gibbs served as team manager.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Dean Kalbfleisch, who had seen limited action the year before, took over the role and played well early in the year against non-IHA opponents. After the three-game series with Yale it was apparent that Kalbfleisch wasn't the same caliber as their former captain, however, the team's offense performed much better than they had the year before so there was hope that the Tigers could repeat.\nAfter starting league play with a win over an improved Columbia squad, Princeton was looking forward to the showdown with Harvard but first they would have to get past a Cornell that was undefeated on the season. Whether they were looking past the Big Red or not, Princeton came out flat, allowing Cornell to score the game's first four goals en route to a 1–4 defeat for the Tigers.

The Boilermakers represent Purdue University in the NCAA's Big Ten Conference.\nPurdue began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1896. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Purdue's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2023–24 season."

        "text": "Jason Robertson (born July 22, 1999) is an American professional ice hockey left winger for the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Stars selected him in the second round, 39th overall, of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft.\nRobertson was born in Arcadia, California, but his family moved to Northville, Michigan, at the age of 10 to increase his opportunities for ice hockey. He played for the Little Caesars and Detroit Kings minor ice hockey teams in Michigan before he was drafted by the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League in 2015. Robertson's 18 goals in his first season with Kingston were the most of any rookie since Anthony Stewart, and in the next two years, he became the first Frontenac to record back-to-back 40-goal seasons since Michael Zigomanis. Robertson was traded to the Niagara IceDogs partway through the 2018–19 OHL season, during which he recorded 117 points in 62 games to win both the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy and the CHL Top Scorer Award.\nJoining the Stars for the season, Robertson spent most of the year with the Texas Stars, Dallas's American Hockey League affiliate. He was included in Dallas's quarantine bubble for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs but did not appear in a game. Robertson made Dallas's opening night roster the following season, where he was the Calder Memorial Trophy runner-up with 17 goals and 28 assists in 51 games. Robertson continued his offensive production during the season, becoming the first player in Dallas Stars history to record hat-tricks in consecutive games. He was named an All-Star in en route to recording his first 100-point season.\nEarly life.\nRobertson was born on July 22, 1999, in Arcadia, California, to Mercedes and Hugh Robertson. Beginning with Robertson's older brother Michael, all of Mercedes and Hugh's children were childhood hockey fans, and the family owned season tickets to see the Los Angeles Kings at the Staples Center. Robertson began playing hockey around the age of four or five, and when he was 10 years old, the family moved to Northville, Michigan, where there were more opportunities for him to ice skate. He played minor ice hockey for a number of teams there, including Little Caesars and the Detroit Kings AAA team before spending a season with the Don Mills Flyers of the Greater Toronto Hockey League. With the Flyers, he scored 28 goals and recorded 33 assists for a total of 61 points. Robertson also played in the 2015 OHL Cup, where his team finished second to the Toronto Marlboros.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nThe Omaha Lancers of the United States Hockey League (USHL) selected Robertson in Phase I of the 2015 USHL draft, but he instead committed to begin his junior ice hockey career with the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), who drafted him in the second round, 62nd overall, of the 2015 OHL Priority Selection. He impressed head coach Paul McFarland during rookie camp and made the Frontenacs' 2015–16 opening day roster at 16, the youngest possible age for junior ice hockey. He recorded his first OHL goal on October 7 against the Oshawa Generals, and on December 11, he scored his first junior hat-trick, leading Kingston to a 4–1 victory over the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. By the OHL's Christmas break, Robertson had 16 goals for the Frontenacs, three of which came on the power play, as well as eight assists and a +2 plus–minus rating. Those 16 goals were the most of any rookie born in 1999 by that point of the OHL season. He finished the 2015–16 season as the Frontenacs' leading rookie scorer with 18 goals and 32 points in 54 games. Those 18 goals were the most by any Kingston 16-year-old since Anthony Stewart 14 years prior. That September, Robertson participated in the 2016 CCM/USA Hockey All-American Prospects Game at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nFollowing his breakout rookie performance, Robertson began the 2016–17 OHL season playing on Kingston's top offensive line with Warren Foegele and Ted Nichol. While the team as a whole struggled to score at the beginning of the season, with only 21 goals through their first nine games, Robertson led the team in scoring with three goals and seven points through that same stretch. After Foegele was traded to the Erie Otters halfway through the season, Robertson became an offensive leader for Kingston, with 26 goals and 47 points in 33 regular season games after the trade. Although the Frontenacs' 179 goals were the fewest of any OHL team during the 2016–17 season, Robertson finished with 42 goals and 81 points in 68 regular season games. Those 42 goals made up 24 percent of the Frontenacs' total scoring. He added another five goals and 18 points in 11 postseason games before the Frontenacs were swept by the Peterborough Petes in the second round of OHL playoffs. The NHL Central Scouting Bureau had named Robertson the No. 34 draft-eligible North American skater in their midterm rankings, but he finished the season at No. 14 overall. That June, the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL) selected Robertson in the second round, 39th overall, of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft.\nAfter attending the Stars' 2017 training camp, Robertson returned to Kingston, where he was named one of four rotating assistant captains for the 2017–18 season. He found strong line chemistry with Linus Nyman at his other wing: by November 9, both wingers had 20 goals apiece, with most of Nyman's assists coming on Robertson's goals. The Nyman—Robertson line found a center in the second half of the season in Gabriel Vilardi. By the halfway point of the season, Robertson led the Frontenacs with 20 goals and 42 points in 33 games. He also led the OHL with 158 shots, recording at least one shot in every game to that point. On March 7, 2018, in a 5–3 loss to the Oshawa Generals, Robertson scored his 100th career OHL goal. Robertson finished the regular season with 41 goals and a team-leading 87 points in 68 games, also becoming the first Frontenac to record 40 goals in consecutive seasons since Mike Zigomanis in 2000 and 2001. He added another 18 points in 16 postseason games before the Hamilton Bulldogs defeated the Frontenacs in the third round of OHL playoffs. At the end of the season, Robertson was named to the OHL All-Star Third Team. Once the junior hockey season ended, Robertson signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Stars, as well as an amateur tryout contract to join the Texas Stars, Dallas's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, for their own playoff run. He struggled to keep up with the AHL players in practice, however, and was sent home in the middle of the playoffs to focus on training for the next season.\nReturning to the Frontenacs as an assistant captain, Robertson began the 2018–19 season on an offensive tear: by mid-November, he led the OHL with 22 goals in as many games and was seventh in the league with 33 points. He scored 38.6 percent of the Frontenacs' 57 goals and either scored or assisted on 57.9 percent. After recording two hat-tricks in the same week, first against the Ottawa 67's and then the Oshawa Generals, Robertson was named both the OHL On the Run Player of the Week and a Canadian Hockey League Top Performer of the Week for the week ending November 11. On November 20, the week after receiving these accolades, Robertson and defenseman Jacob Paquette were traded to the Niagara IceDogs for Billy Constantinou, Ian Martin, and 11 draft picks. At the time of the trade, Robertson had 23 goals and 15 assists in 24 games.\nRobertson continued his offensive performance on his new team, with eight goals and 22 points for Niagara by the midseason break, and he was named the OHL Player of the Month in November after recording 12 goals and 30 points in 12 games between the two teams. With two assists in a 6–4 win over the North Bay Battalion on March 1, Robertson recorded both his 100th point of the 2018–19 season and his 300th career OHL point. In the final week of the regular season, Robertson recorded 11 points in three games to clinch the OHL Central Division title for the IceDogs. With 48 goals and 117 points in 62 games, including 25 goals and 79 points in 38 games for Niagara, Robertson won both the 2019 Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy for the OHL's regular season scoring leader and the CHL Top Scorer Award. He then added another 10 points in as many postseason games before the Oshawa Generals eliminated the IceDogs in the second round of playoffs. Robertson closed out the 2018–19 OHL awards season with a selection to the All-Star First Team. He finished his OHL career with 149 goals and 317 points in 252 games.\nProfessional.\nRobertson was one of the final cuts that the Dallas Stars made as they reduced their roster to 23 for the start of the season. He instead joined the AHL as the Texas Stars' third line winger. Adjusting to the quicker pace of professional hockey, Robertson recorded 13 goals and 12 assists through his first 39 games in Texas. On February 13, 2020, following an injury to Alexander Radulov, the Dallas Stars called Robertson up for his NHL debut. He debuted that night, recording his first NHL assist on Tyler Seguin's goal during the Stars' 3–2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. That was his only point in his three-game call-up before he was sent back down to the AHL on February 17. By the time that the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly halted both the NHL and AHL regular season, Robertson had 25 goals and 47 points in 60 games for the Texas Stars. Robertson was one of several young prospects who traveled with the Stars to the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, but he was invited primarily to watch the team and did not play during Dallas's playoff run.\nA COVID-19 outbreak and several injuries postponed the start of the Dallas Stars' regular season and forced them to retool their roster. Robertson was named to the team's opening night roster as a fourth-line winger alongside Nick Caamano and Jason Dickinson. After playing in the first two games of the season, Robertson was demoted to Dallas's taxi squad for a five-game stretch. He returned at the start of February, and on February 7, Robertson scored his first NHL goal when he deflected a shot from Miro Heiskanen past Malcolm Subban of the Chicago Blackhawks. In the month following that goal, Robertson began producing offensively for Dallas, with three goals and eight points in his next 11 games. By April 11, Robertson's 27 points were second only to Kirill Kaprizov's 40 among rookie scorers. He was named the NHL Rookie of the Month in April after recording eight goals and 18 points, including at least one point in 13 of 17 games. While the Stars narrowly missed the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs, Robertson finished the season with 17 goals and a rookie-leading 28 assists in 51 games. In addition to being named to the 2020–21 NHL All-Rookie Team, Robertson was the runner-up for the Calder Memorial Trophy, given to the top rookie in the NHL. The award was won by Kaprizov of the Minnesota Wild. Because Robertson was still on his entry-level contract at the time of the 2021 NHL Expansion Draft, he was automatically protected from being drafted by the Seattle Kraken.\nRobertson missed the first seven games of the season with a shoulder injury but returned at the end of October to continue the scoring pace he had set the previous season. Playing on the top line with Roope Hintz and Joe Pavelski, Robertson recorded 17 points in his first 15 games of the season. On December 2, Robertson scored on Daniil Tarasov only 68 seconds into the Stars' game against the Columbus Blue Jackets. It was the fourth game in a row in which Dallas had scored within the first 75 seconds of the game, an NHL record. Three months later, on March 4, 2022, Robertson recorded his first NHL hat-trick in his 100th career game, a 4–3 overtime win against the Winnipeg Jets. He recorded another hat-trick two days later, this time during a 6–3 victory over the Minnesota Wild. He was the first Dallas Stars player ever to record hat-tricks in consecutive games, the first NHL player under the age of 23 to do so since Filip Forsberg in 2017, and the first of any NHL player since Alexander Ovechkin in January 2020. Robertson finished the regular season with 41 goals and 79 points in 74 games. He scored the most goals of any player since Jamie Benn during the season, and was only the fourth member of the Stars to reach the 40-goal mark following their relocation to Dallas. The Stars faced the Calgary Flames in the first round of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs, with Robertson making his postseason debut in Game 1. He struggled in the series, with only one assist through four games, and he was moved off of the top line for Game 5. On his new line with Benn and Tyler Seguin, Robertson scored his first postseason goal in Game 5. The Flames defeated the Stars in seven games, and Robertson finished his first playoff series with one goal and four points.\nOn October 5, 2022, after missing training camp and a majority of the preseason, Robertson signed a four-year contract with the Stars. He made the Stars' opening roster for the 2022–23 NHL season and recorded an assist in the first game. Robertson then recorded three points in the second game of the season. In January 2023, Robertson was chosen to represent the Dallas Stars in the 2023 NHL All-Star Game, his first time being selected.\nInternational play.\nRobertson first represented the United States in international ice hockey when he played for the national junior team at the 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Vancouver. He finished the tournament with one goal and seven points in seven games, while the United States took the silver medal in the tournament, losing 3–2 to Finland in the championship match.\nRobertson, joined by Jake Oettinger and Ryan Shea, was one of three young members of the Stars to represent the United States at the 2021 IIHF World Championship in Latvia. Skating on a line with Trevor Moore of the Los Angeles Kings and Conor Garland of the Arizona Coyotes, Robertson was named Team USA's player of the game for scoring the team's only goal in their 2–1 opening-round loss to Finland. He was named the player of the game again with one goal and one assist in Team USA's 6–1 bronze medal victory over Germany. Robertson finished the tournament with four goals and nine points in 10 games.\nPersonal life.\nRobertson is of Filipino descent on his mother's side and Scottish on his father's. His mother was born in Manila and immigrated to the United States when she was three years old. He is the third hockey player of Filipino descent to play in the NHL, following Tim Stapleton and Matt Dumba, and the second Filipino American, after Stapleton. Robertson's younger brother Nick was selected by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the second round of the 2019 NHL Entry Draft.\nRobertson is nicknamed \"Robo\" by his teammates."

The top five teams were placed in one group, the next five in a second group, and the bottom four in a final group. All teams were at that time locked into a seeding range that corresponded to their group—for example, the top five teams were assured the top five seeds.

        "text": "The Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball program in various categories, including points, three-pointers, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Badgers represent the University of Wisconsin in the NCAA's Big Ten Conference.\nWisconsin began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1906. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Wisconsin's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2022–23 season."

        "text": "FIA ETCR – eTouring Car World Cup (Pure ETCR during its first season) was a touring car series for electric cars. It was the first multi-brand all-electric touring car championship and in 2022 obtained the status of an official FIA series. However, in March 2023, the promoter announced that the series would not be continued.\nHistory.\nThe electric touring car series was presented together with the CUPRA 'e-Racer' car ahead of the 2018 Geneva Motor Show by TCR promoter WSC Ltd. In September 2019, Hyundai became the second manufacturer to commit to creating an ETCR car, the 'Veloster N ETCR', and in December the Italian team Romeo Ferraris announced that they will build an Alfa Romeo Giulia according to ETCR specifications.\nIn February 2020, the series was rebranded as 'Pure ETCR' and a calendar of demonstration events for 2020 was presented. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, development and testing was delayed by several months, making the original plan unfeasible. The series' official launch event eventually took place on 9 October in Copenhagen, where Hyundai Motorsport was officially announced as a competitor. A demonstration of the starting gates and the Hyundai Veloster was held during the WTCR event at the MotorLand Aragón in Spain on 13 November 2020. On the same weekend, Romeo Ferraris revealed their ETCR version of the Alfa Romeo Giulia.\nThe calendar for the inaugural season was announced in February 2021. The first Pure ETCR started on 18–20 June at the Autodromo Vallelunga in Italy, and ended in October at Circuit Pau-Arnos. Swedish driver Mattias Ekström was crowned champion of the season, while Cupra won the manufacturer's championship.\nFor the 2022 season, the series had FIA World Cup status and drivers and manufacturers competed for the \"FIA eTouring Car World Cup\".\nIn March 2023, the promoter announced that the series would not be continued, citing unresolvable differences among the various stakeholders concerning the sporting and regulatory format.\nSpecifications.\nETCR cars used spec powertrains supplied by the series organizers, with manufacturers using their own bodywork. The common kit includes motors, gearbox, inverter, battery, ECU and cooling system; ETCR technical regulations require a single-speed rear-drive chassis with McPherson strut front suspension and double wishbone rear suspension.\nThe car had four electric motors on the rear axle, which deliver a maximum combined output of (continuous) and (peak, in the push-to-pass mode). The electric drivetrain unit (EDU) is capable of electronic torque vectoring by varying the power to each rear wheel. Inverter, motor, and gearbox are supplied by MAGELEC Propulsion.\nThe battery, developed by Williams Advanced Engineering, had a capacity of 62 kWh, operating at a voltage of 798 V. According to Williams, it could be charged from 10% to 90% state of charge in one hour on a 60 kW charger. Total range is . It is centrally located on a subframe for better weight distribution, and accounts for nearly of the total curb weight of , at . Williams also supply the vehicle control modules.\nRace format.\nThe ETCR race format was different from standard touring car races, but instead, similar to a rallycross format with several rounds of short races and an elimination process leading to a final. The individual races were called 'battles' and were started from an opening gate and last for only a few laps. Each driver had a ‘push-to-pass’ power boost and a smaller ‘fightback’ boost for trying to reclaim a position. Between the battles, cars returned to a central ‘energy station’ where they could be recharged.\nTeams and cars.\nThree cars had been developed and were competing in the two seasons of ETCR:"

This includes the results from the Biathlon World Championships 2020 (held between the World Cup stages in Pokljuka and Nové Město).\nStandings.\nIn each event places 1 to 40 (1 to 30 in a Mass start) are awarded points, a victory being worth 60 points. The full point system is shown in the table on the right. In a Mass start event only 30 athletes are allowed to participate and the points awarded for ranks 22 to 30 differ from the system used in other events. Equal placings (ties) give an equal number of points. An athlete's total World Cup Score is the sum of all World Cup points earned in the season, minus the points from 2 events in which the athlete got their worst scores. Ties in this score are broken by comparing the tied athletes' number of victories. If this number is the same for the athletes in question, the number of second places is compared, and so on. If a tie cannot be broken by this procedure, it remains a tie."

In 1979, he set the single game scoring record in the Icelandic top-tier Úrvalsdeild karla when he scored 71 points for Fram against ÍS. In 1980, he won the Icelandic championship and the Icelandic cup as an assistant coach with Valur.\nEarly life.\nJohnson was born and grew up in Los Angeles.\nProfessional career.\nIn August 1978, Johnson signed as a player-coach with Fram in the Icelandic second-tier 1. deild karla. In his debut on 23 September, he scored 55 points in Fram's 93–81 victory against Ármann in the annual pre-season Reykjavík Basketball Tournament. He led the team to the tournament finals where the team lost to Valur despite Johnson scoring 41 points. On 12 November, he scored 52 points in a victory against KFÍ.\nIn November 1978, Johnson was loaned to ÍS for their upcoming games against FC Barcelona in the 1978–79 FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup. Although Johnson played well and scored 24 points in both games, ÍS suffered a lopsided losses.\nAt the season's end, Fram finished first in the league and achieved promotion to the top-tier Úrvalsdeild karla. After some uncertainty of his return due to Fram's poor financial situation, Johnson re-signed with the team for the 1979–80 season.\nOn 17 November 1979, Johnson set the Úrvalsdeild single game scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against ÍS. In the beginning of December, tension between Johnson and the team reached a breaking point with Johnson being unhappy with the lateness of his salary while the board of the team was unhappy with his temperament. In the end, Johnson left the team after playing 7 games where he averaged 35.0 points per game.\nAfter his departure from Fram, he served as an assistant coach to Tim Dwyer of Valur where he would win the national championship and the Icelandic cup in March 1980. Alongside assisting Dwyer, Johnson was hired as a player-coach for 2. deild karla club ÍA in December 1979. Johnson re-signed with ÍA the following season and in October 1980 he was loaned to Valur for its upcoming games against Cibona Zagreb in the FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup. After scoring only 14 points in the first game between the teams, Johnson scored a game high 31 points in the second game.\nIn 1994, Johnson signed with 1. deild karla club Ungmennafélag Selfoss. He was released by the team after appearing in 7 games."

Djokovic then won his singles match against Gaël Monfils in straight sets. He also won in 3 sets, in doubles with Viktor Troicki, winning the tiebreak set and saving Team Serbia. Serbia defeated Team France 2–1. Djokovic easily beat Cristian Garín in straight sets as Team Serbia beat Team Chile 3–0, and in the quarterfinals, Novak beat Denis Shapovalov in 3 sets, while Team Serbia thrashed Team Canada 3–0. Even in the semifinals, Djokovic beat Daniil Medvedev in 3 sets, while Team Serbia defeated Team Russia 3–0. In the final, Djokovic saved Team Serbia against Team Spain. He beat Rafael Nadal in straight sets, and partnered Viktor Troicki to win doubles in straight sets. Thus, Team Serbia won 2-1 and with that, won the inaugural ATP Cup title.\nAustralian Open.\nBefore the actual tournament, Djokovic participated in a charity event called \"Rally For Relief\", to extend help for Australians suffering in the Australian Bushfires. He played for Team Williams as they defeated Team Wozniacki, 4–1. In the actual tournament, Djokovic started his title defence with a four-set win over Jan-Lennard Struff in the first round. He then defeated Tatusma Ito, Yoshihito Nishioka, Diego Schwartzman, Milos Raonic and Roger Federer, all in straight sets, to reach the final of the Australian Open. Despite being down 2 sets to 1, Djokovic came back and won the next 2 sets, to defeat Dominic Thiem in the final, and win a record-extending eighth title in Melbourne. He became World No. 1 again, and stayed as World No. 1 for all weeks, except one week, until June 2022.\nDubai.\nDjokovic won for the fifth time in Dubai. He won in straight sets against Malek Jaziri, Philipp Kohlschreiber and Karen Khachanov. He saved 3 match points in his semifinal against Gaël Monfils and went on to win in 3 sets. He then defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas, the second seed, in straight sets, in the final.\nHe extended his winning streak to 21 matches.\nSeason hiatus.\nOn March 8, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season went on hiatus for several months. The following measures were taken:\nAmerican outdoor hardcourt season.\nCincinnati Masters.\nDjokovic started with straight sets wins over Ričardas Berankis, Tennys Sandgren and Jan-Lennard Struff. After a 3-set semifinal win over Roberto Bautista Agut, Djokovic won the title, defeating Milos Raonic in the final, 1–6, 6–3, 6–4. By doing so, he won his 35th Masters 1000 title, tying Rafael Nadal's record of most ATP Masters 1000 titles. Djokovic also achieved the Career Golden Masters for a second time and became the first player to win an ATP Tour singles title upon its resumption, after it was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.\nUS Open.\nDjokovic entered the US Open as the top seed. Djokovic beat Damir Džumhur in straight sets, Kyle Edmund in 4 sets, and Jan-Lennard Struff in straight sets to advance to the fourth round against 20th seed Pablo Carreño Busta. The fourth round match was uneventful until the tenth game, when Carreño Busta came back down 0–40 to hold serve; Djokovic had frustratedly hit a ball into an advertising board earlier when Carreño Busta tied it at deuce. At 5-5, Djokovic was injured and had to be treated on the court. When the match resumed, Carreño Busta took the game and a 6–5 lead in the first set, at which point Djokovic pulled out a spare ball from his pocket and again hit it behind him. The ball unintentionally struck a lineswoman in the throat, who fell to her knees and started hyperventilating. Djokovic was then defaulted from the tournament for recklessness, ending his US Open run. The US Open issued a statement regarding the default.\nClay court season.\nItalian Open.\nDjokovic defeated Salvatore Caruso and compatriot Filip Krajinović in straight sets. He defeated Dominik Koepfer in 3 sets in the quarterfinals, and he defeated Casper Ruud in the semifinals in straight sets.

He defeated Mikael Ymer, Berankis, Daniel Elahi Galán and Khachanov in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, Djokovic defeated Carreño Busta in 4 sets. He won a 5-set thriller against Tsitsipas in the semifinal. He lost in the final in straight sets to Nadal, 6–0 6–2 7–5, his first loss of the season.\nEuropean indoor hard court season.\nVienna Open.\nIn his first appearance at the Erste Bank Open since his 2007 title win, Novak Djokovic passed an early test to defeat countryman Filip Krajinović. He went 3-5 down in the first set and also conceded a set point in the tiebreaker beating him 7–6(8–6), 6–3 in straight sets. Djokovic faced four set points in his second-round clash against Borna Ćorić, but the top seed defeated the Croatian to reach the quarter-finals.\nDjokovic then suffered his heaviest defeat ever in a three-set ATP Tour match, losing 6–2 6–1 to 42nd-ranked lucky loser Lorenzo Sonego in a strangely lacklustre quarter-final performance at the Erste Bank Open. It was only Djokovic's second loss of the year, and the first outside of a Grand Slam tournament. People close to him later revealed that he was in an incredibly bad mood after celebrated Serbian-Montenegrin bishop Amfilohije Radovic passed away few hours before the match.\nATP finals.\nIn the ATP Finals, Djokovic lost to Daniil Medvedev in straight sets but defeated Alexander Zverev and Diego Schwartzman in straight sets to qualify for the semifinals.

        "text": "In cricket, a player is said to have completed a century when they score 100 or more runs in a single innings. The Under-19 Cricket World Cup is the international championship of under-19 One Day International cricket, and is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was first held in 1988, and then 1998, since when it has been contested every two years. As of the 2020 edition, a total of 133 centuries have been scored by 115 players from 18 different teams. South African batsmen have scored the highest number of centuries (17). South Africa, along with Australia, also have the highest number of centurions (15). New Zealand and Scotland have conceded twelve centuries each, which is more than any other team. At least one century has been conceded by 26 of the participating teams.\nThe first century of the championship was scored by Brett Williams of Australia when he scored 112 runs against the West Indies in the 1988 Youth Cricket World Cup. Hasitha Boyagoda scored the highest innings of the championship in the 2018 edition, scoring 191 runs for Sri Lanka against Kenya. India's Shikhar Dhawan, England's Jack Burnham and Bangladesh's Ariful Islam hold the record for the highest number of centuries (three), and are followed by eleven other players who have scored two centuries. Brendan Taylor of Zimbabwe, Anamul Haque of Bangladesh, Babar Azam of Pakistan, Eoin Morgan of Ireland, and Lendl Simmons of the West Indies are the only players to have scored centuries in more than one edition of the championship.\nThe highest number of centuries was scored in the 2018 edition (25), whereas the lowest number of centuries was scored in the 1988, 2000, and 2008 editions with three each. The highest number of centuries at a single ground has been scored at Lincoln No. 3, Lincoln, with nine centuries, followed by Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln and Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium in Fatullah, with seven centuries each. Five centuries have been scored in World Cup finals, all of which have resulted in victories. They were scored by India's Unmukt Chand and Manjot Kalra, Australia's Brett Williams and Jarrad Burke, and England's Stephen Peters. Williams' 108 runs against Pakistan in the 1988 final remains the highest individual score in a final."

        "text": "Cesar Ruiz (born June 14, 1999) is an American football guard for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Michigan and was drafted by the Saints in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nRuiz was born and grew up in Camden, New Jersey. Ruiz's father, Cesar Edwin Ruiz, was killed when he was struck by a motorist while helping a driver change tires when Cesar was eight years old. He attended Camden High School before transferring to IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida after his sophomore year. Ruiz was named an Under Armour All-American as a senior in 2017. Rated a four-star recruit and the top center in his class nationally, Ruiz committed to play college football at Michigan over offers from Florida, Auburn, LSU, and several other top-level programs.\nCollege career.\nRuiz played in ten games as a freshman, starting five games at right guard and long snapper with his first career start coming against Minnesota. Ruiz started all 13 of Michigan's games at center as a sophomore and was named third-team All-Big Ten Conference by the league's coaches and was an honorable mention selection by the media.\nRuiz was named to the Watchlist for the Rimington Trophy going into his junior season. Ruiz started all 13 of Michigan's games at center, allowing only eight total quarterback pressures in 447 snaps and was named the best pass blocking center in college football by Pro Football Focus, and was named second-team All-Big Ten by the coaches and third-team by the media. Following the end of the season, Ruiz announced that he had decided to forgo his senior season in order to enter the 2020 NFL Draft. Over three seasons, Ruiz played in 36 games for Michigan with 31 games started.\nProfessional career.\nRuiz was drafted by the New Orleans Saints in the first round with the 24th overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. Ruiz made his NFL debut on September 21, 2020, on \"Monday Night Football\" against the Las Vegas Raiders, playing on six snaps at right guard.\nIn the 2021 season opening win against the Green Bay Packers, Ruiz started the game at right guard, but played center for rest of the game after Erik McCoy suffered a calf injury in the first quarter. He continued being the team's starting center for the next four games until McCoy returned in Week 7 and Ruiz moved back to right guard.\nOn December 20, 2022, the Saints placed Ruiz on season–ending injured reserve with a foot injury. The next day, it was revealed that Ruiz had suffered a Lisfranc fracture during the team's final offensive possession in Week 15 against the Atlanta Falcons.\nOn September 9, 2023, Ruiz signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension with the Saints with $30 million guaranteed."

        "title": "Concerns and controversies at the 2018 Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "A number of notable controversies and concerns associated with the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia emerged which were the subject of public debate and media commentary.\nGames ceremonies.\nContract award.\nThree Australian companies: Specktak International, World Events, Dae Global and one American company Jack Morton Worldwide (JMW) submitted bids to the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC) to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. On 27 December 2015, the GOLDOC announced they chose JMW to produce the ceremonies of the games. This sparked an anger among the officials of all the three Australian Companies questioned to GOLDOC that why an American company (JMW) was chosen for the production of ceremonies which was going to happen in Australia. An official from the GOLDOC said that JMW is an international company who had been working in Australia since 1983 and had a range of experiences in producing the ceremonies of events as they had previously done for 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. They also said that the JMW's bid came from its Australian branch and not from its main American Branch.\nOpening Ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Commonwealth Games had numerous controversies and was criticised by the public and media for the following reasons:\nTicket printing error.\nJust 50 days before the opening of the Games, it was found that over 14,000 tickets for the Games opening ceremony event had the wrong day printed on them (Thursday), instead of the correct day (Wednesday). An official from the GOLDOC said the issue was due to a “human error”. They also commented that no problems were encountered with the other 90% of the tickets sold for other events and the wrong printed tickets wouldn't be recalled. They assured to the ticketholders that their opening ceremony passes were still valid, despite the wrong day.\nProtest.\nA group of Aboriginal activists established Camp Freedom in Doug Jennings Park on the Southport Spit to protest the Commonwealth Games. Indigenous peoples from every state and territory as well as some Maori people were present at the camp. This continued a long history of protesting the Commonwealth Games when they're held in Australia and many of the 2018 protesters were relatives of those who protested at the 1982, and 2006 Commonwealth Games. The opening ceremony of the Games was held up by protests by a group of Indigenous Australians. Before the ceremony, the protesters blocked the route of the Queen's Baton Relay, as it was under way in the suburb of Southport, which caused the run to be halted for about an hour. A protester told host broadcaster Seven Network,\nDuring the opening ceremony, over hundred Aboriginal people protested outside the Carrara Stadium, the venue of the ceremony. The protesters waved black, red and yellow Aboriginal flags and chanted \"No justice, no games\". According to the Australian Associated Press, three demonstrators who tried to enter the stadium without tickets, were arrested by police. The protesters called the event \"The Stolenwealth Games\" referring to the fact that Australia become part of the Commonwealth by stealing Aboriginal land. One protester shouted through a megaphone \"I'm here to tell the rest of the Commonwealth that the Aboriginal nations of Australia have not ceded their sovereignty\". Three protesters were arrested after clashing with police outside the stadium and were charged with one count of public nuisance.\nPerformers' fees.\nThe GOLDOC offered only A$2000 to the artists and singers to perform a song at the opening ceremony. Viewers of the opening ceremony also criticised that the ceremony lacked performances from Australia's big-name artists.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony of the 2018 Commonwealth Games was criticised by the public and media for the following reasons\nAthletes' attendance.\nFor operational reasons, the GOLDOC had decided that the athletes still on the Gold Coast would enter the Carrara Stadium during the pre-show, before the ceremony began, which was not broadcast and played only on the big screen within the venue to entertain the crowds. This was certainly not a decision without precedent. It was deemed necessary for operationally related athlete welfare reasons and had been briefed to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) which had approved the plan. It was also briefed into official athlete representatives some weeks before the event and also to host broadcast representatives many weeks in advance of the Games. In fact, all key stakeholders were aware and had signed off on the proposed plan well before the Closing Ceremony aired.\nThe television broadcast featured relatively few images of the athletes; whose celebration traditionally forms a focus of the closing ceremony. However, the media failed to report that athlete attendance on the night was the lowest in Commonwealth Games history (many elected to attend a Channel 7 party in the city) and plans to recognise and explicitly celebrate all the athletes present during the early performance of a singer had to be curtailed as there were actually too few athletes on the field of play to deliver the desired broadcast images.\nPost ceremony the media offered a skewed account of events which was never actually contradicted or corrected by the stakeholders (GOLDOC, CGF, etc.) who had signed off on the plan. At no time was attention drawn to the lack of athlete presence in the stadium or the fact that many of them were attending a party held by Channel 7 - one of the most vocal critical voices and also one of the stakeholders that had been briefed well in advance event. With hindsight, the low athlete attendance on the night was foreshadowed during the Opening Ceremony which also fell victim to poor and many felt disrespectful with the athlete attendance.\nChairman's response.\nThe day after the closing ceremony, GOLDOC Chairman Peter Beattie apologised for not showing the athletes and also for too many speeches in the closing ceremony. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she was also disappointed that the athletes were not able to march during the ceremony, laying the blame on GOLDOC. Again, with hindsight, these criticisms were proved to be premature and ill-informed.\nNo-needle policy violation.\nWarning to Indian doctor.\nA cleaner found needles in a water bottle at the Athletes' village just two days before the opening of the Games. The Games officials were shocked to see those needles as the event has a no-needle policy, which meant that the athletes and team officials were not allowed to use or carry needles during their stay in the Athletes' village. Grevemberg said he could not identify which team was involved. Later, an official of the Indian team said their team had found the syringes in a water bottle outside their accommodation and they gave it to the Games medical authorities for analysis. The GOLDOC launched an investigation, and carried out dope tests on 12 athletes. The syringe were examined for its contents. After the tests, the athletes were asked to sign an undertaking that they did not possess any more syringes and restrictions were put on them, including a ban on leaving the Athletes' Village after 10 pm. Another official of the Indian team also said that the needles were found in the common area of the building and no Indian team member was involved in it. An India team doctor admitted he injected a vitamin B complex to a member of the Indian team, which was in clear violation of the Games' no-needle policy. It was also found that the doctor was aware of the no needle policy and to have breached articles I and II of the policy in that he left needles in the room while he went to the Polyclinic to obtain sharp bins for the disposal of the needles. As a result, the Indian team received a serious letter of reprimand warning them against any further breaches of the policy.\nSuspension of Indian athletes.\nLater, the Games officials suspended two Indian athletes from the event for breaching the no-needle policy and were immediately removed from the Athletes' village. CGF President Louise Martin said that the cleaners had found the needle in a cup in the apartment assigned to two athletes. Investigators from the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority then searched their room and found another needle in a bag which belonged to one of those two athletes. Under Games rules only medical practitioners and athletes with an approved medical condition requiring auto-injection such as diabetes were allowed to bring needles into the athletes’ village. That was the second time Team India violated the Games no-needles policy. As well as the athletes’ suspensions, serious warnings were issued to Indian officials including the team's chef de mission that any further breaches could result in suspension of accreditation.\nMissing athletes.\nAt least 13 athletes from four countries - Cameroon, Uganda, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone - absconded during or immediately after the Games. Some missed their competitions. Athletes regularly abscond during major sporting events, and many subsequently claim asylum in their host countries. Most hold nationalities that are deemed high-risk by immigration authorities and find it impossible to get visas outside of exceptional events, such as major games. A month after the games ended, officials estimated that fifty athletes had remained in Australia illegally, with another 200 staying in the country on visas.\nIn October 2019, it was found from the official documents that the Department of Home Affairs had rejected the asylum claims of 217 out of 230 athletes. The official documents also found that 17 \"unlawful non-citizens\" who took part in the Commonwealth Games were still in Australia, 14 of which were from Ghana and Rwanda. A total of 13 remain unaccounted for, while four were in detention. A third of the Cameroon team went missing after the Games."

This was the first year where the Crimson would have both indoor and/or artificial ice available which would negate the cancelling of games due to poor weather conditions. Harvard would play nine of their ten games at the Boston Arena and performed about as well as they had at the Harvard Stadium Rink the year before.\nWith the arena available to them Harvard scheduled five games early in the season against non-conference opponents and gave a strong showing. The Crimson won four of the matches and entered the conference season looking for revenge against Princeton. After dispatching Columbia Harvard welcomed the Tigers to the new home with a convincing win. Their next match turned out to be the game of the season when undefeated Cornell came to town. The two scarlet clubs battled to a 2–2 draw after regulation and, with the IHA crown in the balance, Cornell's Jefferson Vincent scored the game-winner.\nThough their hopes for a championship had been dashed, the Crimson ended the season with two more victories for a 8–2 record and a second consecutive runner-up finish in the IHA.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

However, the series did not take place, and was later rescheduled for January 2022. On 4 January 2022, Rumesh Ratnayake was named as interim head coach for Sri Lanka, after Mickey Arthur's contract ended in December 2021. Craig Ervine was again named as Zimbabwe's captain for the tour, after previously leading the team for their visits to Ireland and Scotland in August and September 2021.\nSri Lanka won the opening match by five wickets, with Zimbabwe's Sean Williams top-scoring with a century. Zimbabwe won the second match by 22 runs to level the series. Sri Lanka's Dasun Shanaka scored a century but, just as Sean Williams in the first match, the centurion ended up on the losing side.

Janith Liyanage, Kamil Mishara and Avishka Fernando were ruled out of the tour, after they each tested positive for COVID-19.

The Golden Gophers represent the University of Minnesota in the NCAA's Big Ten Conference.\nMinnesota began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1896. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Minnesota's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

Hat-tricks have been achieved 71 times at the tournament, 70 times with tries and just once with field goals. The first player to do this was Alex Watson, who achieved the feat for Australia against New Zealand in the inaugural tournament. Players who have played for Australia have scored the most hat-tricks with 30 (29 tries 1 field goal), while Papua New Guinea representatives have conceded the most with 11 (all tries).\nHat-tricks are more of a common occurrence in the group stages, as the match-ups usually place higher-ranked teams against lower-ranked teams. Just ten hat-tricks have occurred in the knockout stages, six happening in the quarter-finals and four in the semi-finals. They have been scored by Bryan Fletcher and Robbie Paul in the 2000 tournament, Billy Slater and Johnathan Thurston in the 2008 edition, Jarryd Hayne (twice) and Brett Morris in the 2013 competition, Valentine Holmes (twice) in the 2017 tournament and Josh Addo-Carr in the 2021 edition.\nOut of the 70 hat-tricks scored, seven people have achieved the feat twice, these being Ian Schubert, Billy Slater, Akuila Uate, Manu Vatuvei, Jarryd Hayne, Suliasi Vunivalu, Valentine Holmes and Josh Addo-Carr. 15 people have scored an additional try on top of the hat-trick. Holmes and Addo-Carr have scored five tries in a single game, whilst Holmes is the only player to score six tries in a single game. Four players have scored hat-tricks while being on the losing side, these being Bob Fulton, Ian Schubert, Damien Blanch and Chris Taripo. Billy Smith is the only player to score a hat-trick of field goals, doing so for Australia against France in the 1968 tournament."

Although intended to increase representation from outwith Glasgow and Edinburgh, as this was the premier trial match both Glasgow and Edinburgh players were eligible for selection for their corresponding West and East sides.\nAnother Trial match, a Blues v Whites match was introduced in the 1877-88 season. The Blues v Whites match evolved into a 'Probables' v 'Possibles' match for Scotland selection.\nThe East v West match remained the premier Trial match for Scotland until the late 1920s. It was at this stage that the Blues v Whites match overtook it in importance. The introduction of the Scotland Probables versus the Scotland Possibles trial match diminished the need for the East of Scotland District versus West of Scotland District again, and it continued in the 1930s as a junior trial match. 'Junior' matches were not age-related, but matches based on teams outwith the Scottish Unofficial Championship.\nAge-grade format.\nThe East v West match continued in its same format till 1948. It then switched to an age-grade format and was used for selecting the best Under 23 players for Scotland.\nHiatus.\nWhen the Scottish Inter-District Championship began its own grade tournament, the East v West matches were curtailed.\nResurrection.\nThe West of Scotland District and East of Scotland District representative sides have recently been resurrected at age-grade levels. These matches are now used as trial matches to identify candidates for the Scottish Rugby Academy and potential Glasgow Warriors, Edinburgh Rugby and Scotland stars of the future."

        "text": "Horse surfing is an extreme sport invented in 2004. It requires two people, a horse, and a board. Horse surfing involves one person riding either\nkite-board, surfboard, wake-board, or skim-board, while being towed behind a horse, ridden by a second person, through shallow water, at speeds up to . After originating in England the first official horse surfing competition was held in 2006 in La Baule, France, and over the last 14 years the sport has continued to spread internationally. Today there are several competitions with globally established rules and categories.\nHistory.\nHorse surfing, a modification of horse boarding, originated in 2005 in Cornwall, England. It was the product of innovation when Daniel Fowler-Prime, the creator of horse boarding, was commissioned for a 'beach trick horse riding' photoshoot. Fowler-Prime forgot to bring a mountain board, his board of choice for horse boarding, to the photoshoot, so he asked local surf shop manager Matt Smith to bring a mountain and wake board to the photoshoot. Smith agreed and horse surfing was first attempted. The popularity of horse surfing has continued to grow ever since. The first horse surfing competition was held in 2006, one year after the sports invention, in La Baule, France. In 2008 the first horse-surfing and horse-boarding drag race was held and the number of competitions has grown ever since with, as of 2020, competitions having been held in Dubai, Australia, Taiwan and the USA.\nCompetitions.\nHorse surfing competitions include multiple rides across four different horse surfing disciplines. The competition winner is determined by the total of points accrued over the four events.\nCompetition area.\nThe competition area requires a 300m stretch of shallow waterfront, which is divided into two main subareas: (1) the preparation and start zone sub-areas – these areas are designed to give the team a space to connect the horse and rider via the rope and for the horse to take the rope tension so the rider is able to stand and (2) the main course area – this area cannot exceed 250m, but it can be made shorter by moving the finish post closer to the start post where required.\nAn exact breakdown of the course is as follows-\n\"Pre-competition area\"\n- Preparation zone - 10m\n- Start zone - 10m\n\"Start Post- competition area\"\n- The course - maximum length 250m\n\"Finish Post - post competition area\"\n- Run off area - 30m\nPersonnel.\nA horse surfing team is made up of four people and one horse. The two main competitors are the horse rider and the surfer, while the other two team members, the dinghy man and the rope man, are responsible for getting the surfer in place prior to being connected to the horse and connecting the horse to the surfer via the tow rope.\nRules and regulations.\nThere are several rules that have been standardised across all official horse surfing competitions:\nEquipment.\nHorse riding is a difficult sport meaning proper equipment is essential to success. To successfully horse surf there are four key pieces of equipment.\nHorse.\nA quiet, beach-trained horse that is fast and fit enough to pull the rider at speeds of 35-40 miles per hour is required.\nBoard.\nThere are several boards that can be used for horse surfing, including; wake boards, kite boards or skim boards.\nWake boards.\nThe most important factor when considering which wake board is appropriate is the board size to rider ratio, with larger boards having larger amounts of buoyancy and therefore being better able to support larger riders. The shape of the board also affects how what sort of rider it is appropriate for, a single tip board, with one square and one rounded end, is most appropriate for those who only aim to ride in a straight-line without performing any tricks, while a double tipped board, with two rounded edges allows for more maneuverability in the water, facilitating jumps and tricks. Most wakeboards are made of foam center wrapped in fiberglass or carbon/graphite.\nKite boards.\nThere are several different types of kite boards that are appropriate for horse surfing, with each having its own advantages and disadvantages. The most common type of kiteboarding is the twin-tip kite board. A kite board is similar in shape to a wake board but can have additional pads and foot straps. Most twin tip models have a base that curves upwards, channels that direct the water in one direction, increasing maximum possible speeds, either straight or curved sides and square or rounded corners. A light wind kite board is the recommended board for heavier riders due to the large surface area created by a flatter, wider more rectangular shape. A kite surfboard is generally used for kite surfers who wish to surf waves and perform tricks involving a large amount of airtime. A kite surfboard is generally smaller, thinner and narrower than a classic surf board and frequently has an epoxy core.\nSkim boards.\nAs with wake boards, skim boards come in a range of sizes and thicknesses, each with advantages and disadvantages. Thicker boards are more buoyant, gliding on top of the water, allowing for easier balance, while thinner boards are more sensitive to riders' weight changes, allowing for higher speeds and more intricate trick. The type of material used to craft the skim board also affects the style in which it can be ridden, with carbon fiber boards most commonly used by professionals, foam boards most suited to beginners and wooden boards being used by inland riders due to their weight.\nModified saddle and tow rope.\nA custom made saddle that allows for secure connection of a tow rope, as well as a tow rope strong enough to withstand the tension of the rider will be required to horse surf. \nLocations.\nHorse surfing is possible in any river, lake, or ocean that is shallow enough for a horse to gallop through while deep enough to allow a rider to be buoyant enough to surf. As horse riding is not permitted or may require a permit in some areas it is important to check rules and regulations before choosing a location. Horse riding on busy beaches is not recommended as people, balls, surf boards, frisbees, dogs, and any other moving objects may spook the horse, resulting in a lack of control and possible injury.\nHorses hooves have the potential to do damage to the beach ecosystem. Riders can minimise this damage by staying away from beach dunes, wildlife sanctuary zones, turtle nesting sites and not riding through flocks of birds or near marine life.\nFor competition training a 300m straight stretch of water and sand will be necessary. As of the start of 2020, horse-surfing competitions have been recorded as taking place in Taiwan, Australia, Dubai and the USA.\nBeach horse riding special considerations.\nHorse riding at the beach for the first time is a new experience requiring special training of both the horse and rider. It is recommended that before horse surfing the horse is well practiced in beach riding, so it does not to become spooked or anxious. To begin training a horse for horse surfing, it is suggested the first beach ride be at low-tide, at a quiet uncrowded beach front. Each horses confidence with entering the water for the first time will be unique, and it is important for safety of the horse and rider not to force the horse into the water if they have become agitated to a point where the rider does not feel comfortable they have enough control to steer and stop the horse. Having a second rider and horse, who are practiced in beach riding, will help the horse stay calm, and make the training process safer.\nRiding on beach sand requires more strength than riding on harder surfaces such as natural trails or race tracks. To reduce the chance of soft-tissue injury or muscle soreness it is best, while the horse is building up their beach fitness, to ride the horse along the firmer sand at the waters edge, take a slower pace, and take rest breaks.\nAfter riding on the beach the horse will need to be properly cleaned to avoid any damage from the exposure to salt water and sand. It is important to rinse the horse all over with clean fresh water to remove any salt that might dry out their skin, and carefully check for any scrapes of cuts. Ocean water can contain infectious microbes so if the horse has been cut or scratched the wounds should be thoroughly cleaned and treated with antibiotics. Sand can be very damaging to horse hoof tissue if they are unshod, hooves will need to be careful checked and cleaned after beach riding to remove all sand. If the horse wears pads it is recommended a space be cut in the middle of the pad, so that sand does not build up."

        "text": "The Boris Yeltsin Volleyball Cup is an annual international women's volleyball tournament. It is named after the first president of Russia, Boris Yeltsin. Since 2008, the tournament has been held in Yekaterinburg, Russia. \nHistory.\nIn the summer of 2002, Nikolay Karpol (the head coach of the Russian women's national volleyball team and Uralochka) met with Boris Yeltsin to discuss a new international volleyball competition. Yeltsin agreed for the tournament to be named after him; at the same time Karpol's initiative was strongly supported by the governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast, Eduard Rossel. The winners would receive a trophy made by stonecutters from the Ural Mountains.\n2003.\nThe first tournament of the Yeltsin Cup, which featured 8 national teams, was scheduled to match the opening of two large arenas in central Ural — the Palace of Sporting Games \"Uralochka\" in Yekaterinburg and the sports and health complex Metallurg-Forum in Nizhny Tagil. The first winner of the Yeltsin Cup was the Russian national team with no losses.\n\"Finals:\" Russia vs China  3:1 (25:16, 25:23, 27:29, 26:24)\n\"Third place play-off:\" Azerbaijan vs USA 3:2 (22:25, 28:26, 25:22, 18:25, 15:11)\n2004.\nThe 2004 tournament was held in April, instead of June, due to national teams preparing for the Olympic Games in Athens. Russia defeated Cuba in the finals.\n\"Finals:\" Russia vs. Cuba — 3:0 (25:19, 25:21, 25:23)\n\"Third place play-off\": Azerbaijan vs. Dominican Republic — 3:2 (23:25, 25:21, 20:25, 25:18, 15:6)\n2005.\nThe 2005 tournament differed from the previous two tournaments: the number of teams was reduced to six and the competition's format changed to a single-round tournament with no play-offs. At the end of the last match, where the Russian national team, led by new coach Giovanni Caprara, lost to Team Azerbaijan in five plays, the tournament winner was not immediately determined. Spectators had to wait for the results of the points calculations in all matches played by the Russian and Netherlands national teams, which at the end of the round had tied in both win-lose ratio (4:1) and plays ratio (14:6). Scoring determined that the Russians won with 0.026. Turkey won against Azerbaijan for third place, which was also determined by a better plays ratio.\n2006.\nThe Russian and Chinese teams were the final teams of the fourth Yeltsin Cup tournament. The Chinese team won in five plays. Yeltsin participated in the award ceremony for the last time.\n\"Finals:\" China vs. Russia — 3:2 (25:22, 14:25, 25:20, 18:25, 15:9)\n\"Third place play-off:\" Netherlands vs. Turkey — 3:0 (25:17, 25:21, 26:24)\n2007.\nThe 2007 tournament was the first to be unattended by Yeltsin following his death on 23 April. It is also the first tournament to be included in the official FIVB schedule.\nThe Chinese national team won against the Dutch in the finals. For the first time in the Yeltsin Cup tournament, the Russian team participated as the reigning world champion, even though some of their key players were not participating. It was also the first time that players of any local club were not among the national team players. Uralochka trainee Olga Fateeva was among the top three players of the tournament (the first being the captain of the Turkish national team Neslihan Darnel) and was recognized as the tournament's MVP).\n\"Finals\": China vs the Netherlands — 3:1 (25:21, 22:25, 25:18, 37:35)\n\"Third place play-off\": Russia vs Turkey — 3:1 (19:25, 25:23, 25:23, 25:20)\n2008.\nThe tournament, like 2005, was a single-round tournament with no play-offs. The Russians won first place one round before the end of the competition. National team captain Marina Sheshenina and volleyball player Yekaterina Gamova became four-time winners of the First President of Russia Cup.\n2009.\nRussia won the 2009 Yeltsin Cup. Ural native Marina Sheshenina, who participated in all five victorious tournaments of the Russian National Team, was awarded the \"Miss Tournament\" prize, while Japanese passer Yoshie Takeshita was awarded with the \"For loyalty to Volleyball\" prize.\n\"Finals:\" Russia vs. Japan — 3:2 (20:25, 25:20, 25:18, 20:25, 16:14)\n\"Third place play-off:\" Netherlands vs. Cuba — 3:0 (25:17, 25:23, 25:21)\n2010.\nSix teams participated in the 2010 tournament, of which Russia won first place. Chinese middle blocker Xue Ming was awarded the Yeltsin Cup MVP prize, Dutch Manon Flier received the \"Miss Tournament\" award, and the Russian team passer Yevgeniya Startseva was called the best young player.\n\"Finals\": Russia vs. China — 3:0 (30:28, 25:16, 25:17)\n\"Third place play-off\": Netherlands vs. Italy — 3:0 (25:23, 25:19, 25:23)\n2011.\nGamova, Lyubov Sokolova, Ekaterina Kabeshova, and Svetlana Kryuchkova were not on the roster of Russia's team. In the semifinals, Russia lost to first-timer Brazil with a score of 2:3. China won first place, while Russia won third place against Poland.\n\"Finals:\" China vs. Brazil — 3:2 (37:35, 19:25, 25:27, 25:23, 15:10)\n\"Third place playoff:\" Russia vs. Poland — 3:2 (22:25, 25:22, 25:22, 22:25, 16:14)\n2012.\nThe 2012 tournament was a round-robin among five teams. Russia scored 3:0 (25:23, 25:18, 25:22) against Italy and became won the Cup for the seventh time. Individual prizes included:\n2013.\nIn 2013, most of the participating teams significantly changed their rosters. In the final match, Russia won against Italy. Paolo Tofoli led the play of \"Squadra Azzurra\" in Yekaterinburg instead of head coach Marco Mercanelli, who stayed at the Apennines. His playmaker Indre Sorocaite became the tournament's MVP. The victory parade included members of the USSR national team, who won a gold medal in the 1988 Seoul Olympics.\n\"Finals\": Russia vs. Italy — 3:1 (22:25, 25:21, 25:14, 25:18)\n\"Third place playoff\": Dominican Republic vs. Cuba — 3:1 (25:16, 25:27, 25:22, 25:22)\n2014.\nIn 2014 the Bulgarian team won. Russia lost its key players that year — Nataliya Obmochaeva, Tatiana Kosheleva, Iuliia Morozova, Anastasia Shlyakhovaya. After winning against Dutch and the Dominican Republic, they made it to the semi-finals due to the Dutch victory over the Dominicans in the final day of the group stage. Both semifinal matches resulted in 3:2 — Russia beat Japan, while Bulgaria won against the Dutch. MVP was awarded to Netherlands National Team playmaker Judith Pietersen. Fans actively participated in a charity lottery called \"My vmeste\" (We are together) and collected 91,450 rubles over the competition's five days.\n\"Finals\": Bulgaria vs. Russia — 3:2 (16:25, 25:20, 28:30, 25:23, 15:11)\n\"Third place play-off\": Netherlands vs. Japan — 3:0 (25:22, 25:14, 25:17).\n2015.\nThe tournament was contested by five teams in a round robin. Israel and Czech Republic National Teams became the new contestants in the Yeltsin Cup. Russia National Team became the victor of the tournament with no play lost. Russian team opposite Nataliya Obmochaeva was awarded MVP, Moran Zur (Israel) — the best playmaker, Yekaterina Zhdanova — the best blocker, Anna Malova (Russia) — the best libero, Gung Xianiu (China) — the best server, Pavla Winkourowa (Czech Republic) — the best setter, Ksenia Alexandrovna Ilchenko — the best young player of Russia national Team, Aleksandra Pasynkova got \"Miss Tournament\" award.\n2016.\nIn 2016 the tournament was delayed to September and dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the Uralochka-NTMK volleyball club. Due to the demands of the sports schedule in the Olympic season, an alternative team roster applied to participate in the Yeltsin Cup. Uralochka, with two Kazan Dynamo volleyball players (Irina Zaryazhko and Daria Stolyarova) and led by Nikolay Karpol and Rishat Giliazutdinov, represented the Russia national team. Switzerland, represented by the Volero team (Zürich) under Zoran Terzić's leadership, won the tournament. Volero playmaker Dobriana Rabajiyeva was recognized as the MVP of the 14th Yeltsin Cup.\n2017.\nFive teams participated in the 15th Yeltsin Cup play-off. Russia and Serbia faced off in the finals before the latter won in five plays. Individual awards went to Russians Yevgeniya Startseva (best passer), Irina Koroleva (best blocker), Anna Lazareva (best young player); Radmila Beresneva from Kazakhstan (best server); Turkish Simge Şebnem Aköz (best libero); Bulgarian Elitsa Vasileva (\"Miss Tournament\"); and Serbians Bojana Živković (best passer) and Brankica Mihajlović (MVP).\n2018.\nThe 2018 Yeltsin Cup 2018 was part of the 2018 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League, and consisted of Russia, Argentina, the Netherlands, and Thailand. The Netherlands won 3:0 against Russia in the finals."

        "text": "The 1906–07 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey season was the 8th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBeginning with this season the undergraduates at Princeton were limited to just two sports during one school year. As a result, several players who had tried out for the team in recent years were ineligible to play for the ice hockey team. Despite this setback the team was well represented with many returning members from a year before. Counterbalancing the dearth of players was the team's new practice facility located on Lake Carnegie, the first home venue the Tigers' possessed. After a decent showing in three early games Princeton had to cancel it's Holiday road trip to Norfolk, Virginia and were limited to a single practice game over the winter break. While there was worry that the lack of play would inhibit the team's ability to compete against conference opponents, the Tigers won both games in early January. The fast start was then buoyed by the addition of Thomas Howard as coach.\nPrinceton's third conference game came to define their season as the Tigers were able to take down four-time defending champion Harvard 4–3. The victory was the first for Princeton over the Crimson and set the icers up for a chance at their first championship. In their final game against Yale the teams battled fairly evenly throughout the extended game (25-minute halves were used rather than the normal 20-minute halves) but a goal by Joshua Brush put the Tigers ahead for good and gave Princeton its first Intercollegiate Hockey Association Championship.\nJ.G. Thomas served as team manager with F. Leake as his assistant.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Over 100 countries worldwide broadcast coverage including the UK, Australia, India, Middle East, UAE, France, Germany, Turkey, Spain, United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Teams were split into two groups of four with matches being played on a round-robin basis in La Manga with the top two from each progressing to contest the semi-finals and final.\nThe current ECL title holders are V.O.C Rotterdam of the Netherlands, who won the inaugural 2019 season, beating SG Findorff (Bremen) from Germany in the final.\nParticipating teams.\nEight clubs from across Europe participated in the inaugural edition.\nGroup stage.\nGroup B.\n Lost all points due to player eligibility infringement.\n \"JCC Brescia initially won all their matches, but were later found breaching the player eligibility criteria and thus their opponents were declared winners.\"\n \"JCC Brescia initially won all their matches, but were later found breaching the player eligibility criteria and thus their opponents were declared winners.\"\n \n \"JCC Brescia initially won all their matches, but were later found breaching the player eligibility criteria and thus their opponents were declared winners.\"\nPlayer of the Tournament.\nMax O'Dowd of V.O.C.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Hoosiers represent Indiana University in the NCAA's Big Ten Conference.\nIndiana began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1901. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Indiana's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

The Huskies dominated the series up until the end of the 20th century, but Gonzaga has won 14 of the last 16 meetings, dating back to 1998. The Huskies hold a 19–7 lead in Seattle, Gonzaga leads the series 12–11 in Spokane, and the Zags own a 1–0 record in neutral locations, but they have never met in any postseason tournaments.\nHiatus.\nWashington and Gonzaga met 11 times between 1995 and 2006, including a true home-and-home series annually from 1997 until 2006, but then Washington cancelled the series. Gonzaga was dominating the series, ascending from a Cinderalla in the 1999 NCAA Tournament to regular in the top 25 polls and the NCAA Tournament every year. Bad blood surfaced between the schools with Huskies assistant coach Cameron Dollar breaking NCAA rules while recruiting Josh Heytvelt, who ended up signing with the Zags. In 2009, Lorenzo Romar and his Washington staff proposed a series three games in a row at KeyArena in Seattle, but Gonzaga head coach Mark Few took insult to that, retorting with \"the chances of that happening are about the same as Bigfoot having my baby. That's like me saying, Gonzaga proposes a five-year deal at Spokane Arena. There, I just made a proposal. That's as logical as this deal [would be].\" \nRenewal.\nIn 2014, Washington State Senator Michael Baumgartner proposed a bill that would require Gonzaga and Washington to play once a year in men's basketball. Later in the year, it was announced that the dormant rivalry between the Huskies and the Bulldogs would be renewed with a 4-year home-and-home series beginning in the 2016–17 season and running through the 2019–20 season. A year later, with Gonzaga and Washington both among the field of the 2015 Battle 4 Atlantis Thanksgiving week basketball tournament, they were selected to play each other in the opening round of the tournament, ending the rivalry drought at 9 years. In 2019, The Zags and Huskies extended their home-and-home series from the 2020–21 season through the 2023–24 season, starting in Spokane. \nGame results.\nBelow is a complete list of series results, according to Sports Reference and GoHuskies.com. Rankings are from the AP Poll at the time of the game."

        "text": "The 1997 World Women's Snooker Championship was a women's snooker tournament held in 1997.\nTournament summary.\nThe tournament started as the 1996 World Championship, but due to delays in the scheduling of the later rounds, it became the 1997 Championship. It was promoted by Barry Hearn who had been promoting the Women's world championship since 1990. The defending champion was Karen Corr. There were 52 players who entered the tournament. Allison Fisher who had won the title seven times, most recently in 1994, did not enter as she has moved to the United States where she had embarked on a successful pool career. 1984 amateur champion and five-times runner-up Stacey Hillyard had retired from competition and so was another non-participant. The original schedule was for the quarter-finals onwards to be held in India, as they had been in 1994 and 1995, from 16 to 19 September 1996, but eventually the final rounds took place in Llanelli, with the semi-finals and final not happening until well into 1997.\nThis was the last women's world snooker championship to be held before the World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association amalgamated with the WPBSA later in 1997.\nRounds 1 to 4.\nThe tournament started as the 1996 World Championship. The first four rounds took place at Raunds Cue Sports Club, Northamptonshire, to decide the eight players that would go on to contest the quarter-finals onwards, which were expected to be played in Bombay in mid-September 1996. Defending champion Karen Corr won her first match without losing a but won only on the final black in the deciding frame of her match against Lynette Horsburgh. Second seed Kelly Fisher and 1995 runner-up Kim Shaw both won both of their matches 4–0. Mary Talbot, ranked 26th, was a surprising quarter-finalist, beating 7th seed Sarah Smith and 12th ranked player Helen Audus. The highest break in the main qualifying was a 77 by Ann-Marie Farren. A plate competition was held for players who did not qualify to the quarter-finals and was won by Horsburgh, who made a break of 100 in the first round of the plate competition.\nQuarter-finals.\nFollowing postponements of the final stages and a lack of response from promoter Barry Hearn's partner in India, it was decided to hold the quarter-finals at the Terry Griffiths Matchroom, Llanelli, and they took place in November 1996. Corr whitewashed 1984 professional champion Mandy Fisher 4–0. Banks saw off 1987 champion Farren 4–2, and Lisa Quick beat Shaw 4–1. Fisher's match with Talbot was delayed due to Talbot's illness, with Fisher winning 4–1. Meanwhile, Hearn requested the termination of his contract with the WLBSA to promote the event in future.\nSemi-finals and Final.\nThe semi-finals and final were eventually scheduled to be held in Llanelli in mid-1997, following a continued lack of communication from Hearn's partner in India. Corr made the highest break of the competition, 87, and three other breaks over 30 in overcoming Banks 5–0. Quick won the first frame against Fisher, but no more, losing 1–5. The final between Corr and Fisher was closely contested until 3–3 but then Corr won three frames in a row to take her third world title. The tournament finished some eleven months after the start of the qualifying matches, and was the end of promoter Hearn's relationship with women's snooker that stretched back to 1990.\nThis was the last world championship to be held before the amalgamation of the World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association with the WPBSA a few months later. The intention was that major finals for women should be played at the same venues as the men's events, for example the women's world championship final being held at the Crucible Theatre during the World Snooker Championship.\nResults.\nSource: Snooker Scene\nFirst round.\nAt Raunds Cue Sports Club.

With this official approval also came the insistence that Penn join the Intercollegiate Hockey Association and play against the likes of Yale and Brown. While those plans were being ironed out the Philadelphia Hockey League, of which Penn was still a member, replaced Haverford College with Central High School and arranged inter-squad games between each of the four clubs. In late December a team composed of current and former Quaker members played Yale, losing 3–4. The game had been arranged earlier but as many Quaker players had returned home for the holidays the team needed to use graduates as replacements.\nWhen the team finally played its first official game on January 10 they opened with a bang, defeating Central High School 12–0. The Quakers played well through several games but after the managers of the West Park Ice Palace failed to carry through on an agreement for a benefit night the school refused to use the rink for the remainder of the season.\nThe team did not have a head coach but Benjamin Parish served as team manager.\nIn December of the following year the Athletic department released the figures for all of the athletic programs the university supported. They did this due to the $12,000 deficit the school had incurred from all programs over the previous fiscal year. The ice hockey team cost the school $210 to support, seventh out of ten programs, but the team had brought in just $38 in gate receipts. With the debt from the school's athletic department mounting, combined with the closing of the West Park Ice Palace, the ice hockey team was suspended as a luxury that it could not afford.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "James George Robertson (c.1854 – February 1900) was a Scottish rugby union player. He is the first black rugby union player in the world.\nThe Scottish sports historian Andy Mitchell, who researched Robertson's life, stated: \"It is intriguing that someone from an unusual background has come to the country and been accepted into society. There is virtually nothing to indicate that he suffered discrimination due to his colour. This raises the question as to whether his social class allowed them to rise above racial discrimination.\"\nEarly years.\nThe son of Perthshire surgeon Daniel Robertson, James Robertson was born in Bathurst - now Banjul - in the then-British colony of The Gambia in 1854.\nDr. Daniel Robertson was to become Colonial Secretary of The Gambia. It is there he had two sons, James and John, with a local Gambian woman. Both sons were sent to Scotland for their education.\nJames was first sent to board at a school in Crieff. He then went to Madras College from 1866 to 1870. A gifted student he then matriculated at the University of St. Andrews. Robertson lasted a year there, but then moved to Edinburgh University to study medicine. He was at Edinburgh for five years.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nRobertson played as a forward for Royal HSFP.\nHe graduated from Edinburgh University in 1876 and found a post in County Durham as the resident medical officer at Gateshead Dispensary. While there, he turned out for Northumberland between 1879–82. In this case, Northumberland was a local club, not the County team.\nProvincial career.\nHe represented Edinburgh District against Glasgow District on 6 December 1873.\nLater life.\nIn 1880, Robertson married Emily Maud. Robertson purchased a medical practice in Ashwell, Hertfordshire in 1894. He became President of Ashwell Tennis Club and a member of the committee of the local cricket club.\nHe died suddenly at home in February 1900, aged 46."

        "title": "1994–95 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1994–95 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey team represented Boston University in college ice hockey. In its 22nd year under head coach Jack Parker the team compiled a 31–6–3 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive season and twenty first all-time. The Terriers defeated Maine 6–2 in the championship game at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island, to win their fourth national championship.\nSeason.\nComing off of the worst championship loss in over 30 years, Jack Parker was looking for a way to help his team recover from a nightmarish end. To make matters worse, goaltender J. P. McKersie an AHCA Second Team All-American, was hit by a car while biking that left him in a coma for 6 days. While McKersie would recover and eventually continue his playing career, he would sit out the entire 1994–95 season. This left a rather large void in net, but because Parker rotated his goaltenders, senior alternate captain Derek Herlofsky was well positioned to shoulder his share of the burden. The bulk of McKersie's minutes would eventually go to Chicago draft pick Tom Noble who beat out Shawn Ferullo for the second spot in goal.\nThe forward and defensive corps were in a much more stable position as BU returned the majority of its principle players from a year before. The Terriers also added a couple of top prospects to this mix, including Chris Drury who was already nationally famous for having led Trumbull, Connecticut, to the 1989 Little League World Series championship.\nSlow start.\nEarly on, the Terriers had trouble finding consistency in their game, starting 3–1–2 through the first three weeks of the season but having allowed 7 goals against in two different games. After a weekend against the worst team in Hockey East Massachusetts, albeit only in their second season since returning to the ice, BU was able to settle down and get themselves ready for their first tournament of the season.\nTournament play.\nAt the end of November BU headed to California for the Great Western Freeze–Out, held at the home arena of the Los Angeles Kings. The Terriers easily downed Princeton in the semifinal then pushed national powerhouse Maine into overtime but the Black Bears were the ones who prevailed. While the loss didn't harm BU too much since it was a non-conference game, they faced Maine in a pair of road games the following weekend. While the Terriers could only capture 3 points out of 10 in the series, both games were played very close and demonstrated that the two teams were evenly matched.\nThe near miss against Maine appeared to light a fire under the Terriers who utterly dominated their next two games (winning by a combined score of 21–3) before taking several weeks off for their winter break. When the team returned to the ice at the end of December they did so in Minneapolis for the Mariucci Classic. Similar to their first tournament, BU won the semifinal comfortably and headed into overtime in the title game. This time they were able to win from a goal by Ken Rausch.\n63 58\nCatching Maine.\nAt the beginning of 1995 BU was 16 points behind Maine, however, because Hockey East had altered its point system beginning with 1994–95 (5 points for a win, 2 points for a tie and an additional point for a shootout win after overtime) they were only about 3 games behind the Black Bears with 3 games in hand. This meant that despite going 0–1–2 against Maine in their head-to-head matchups the Terriers could still keep even with the conference leaders as long as they took care of business.\nThe Terriers played well in January going 6–2, with all games coming against conference opponents. The consistent play allowed BU to close the gap with Maine with one game in hand. That would be put on the back-burner, however, as BU played in the Beanpot at the beginning of February. The Terriers were able to capture their 18th title after dropping a weak Boston College team in the championship, but the time off had allowed Maine to build a 15-point lead in the Hockey East standings.\nIll-equipped to afford a mistake the Terriers laid an egg in against Providence, losing 1–8 in their worst performance of the season. BU recovered to win the rematch but that left Maine with a 10-point lead in the standings and both teams had three games to play. Fortunately for the Terriers their remaining games came against two of the worst teams in Hockey East while the Black Bears faced much stiffer competition. BU swept their final three games while Maine lost twice and the two teams ended in a tie for 1st in the conference standings.\nHockey East tournament.\nBecause Maine had the tie-breaker due to the head-to-head meetings, BU received the 2nd seed and played Merrimack in the quarterfinals. While the game was close, BU won the 1-goal game and advanced to the semifinal at the nearby Boston Garden. The Terriers took care of Massachusetts–Lowell to reach the championship where they were surprised to find 6th-seeded Providence as their opponent. The Friars proved up to the task and played the Terriers hard but BU held firm and won the game 3–2 to win their second consecutive conference tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe championship allowed BU to earn the top eastern seed and a bye into the regional semifinals. After a week off the Terriers faced defending national champion Lake Superior State and were able to exact their revenge with a 6–2 victory. BU advanced to the Frozen Four and faced Minnesota in a rematch of the 1994 national semifinal. The score may have been different but the result was the same as Boston University defeated the Golden Gophers 7–3 to return to the national championship game.\nThe Terriers faced Maine on April Fools Day and though the Black Bears had yet to lose to BU that year they were coming off of a 3 overtime epic against Michigan (then the longest game in NCAA tournament history). Despite this Maine was able to control the balance of play early, outshooting the Terriers early but on a faceoff in the Black Bear end on the Power Play, Steve Thornton was able to tap the puck through Brad Purdie's skates and fire home the first goal of the game. After that Maine netminder Blair Allison had to face a barrage by the BU offense that saw him face 21 shots over the next 25 minutes (compared to Maine's 6). The Terriers would score twice more to build a 3-goal lead midway through the game but the Black Bears were able to get on the scoresheet before the end of the second. Maine closed the lead to one just 31 seconds into the final frame but BU continued to apply pressure to Allison and scored twice more before capping off the game with a third power play goal to win their fourth national championship.\nAwards and honors.\nThe two-goal game from Chris O'Sullivan earned him the Tournament MOP and was joined on the All-Tournament team by Kaj Linna and Shawn Bates. Mike Grier was named to the AHCA All-American East First Team while Linna and O'Sullivan made the second team. All three players were named to the All-Hockey East Second Team while Chris Kelleher made the Hockey East All-Rookie Team. Steve Thornton received the Len Ceglarski Award for sportsmanship.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

He played college football at South Carolina and was selected by the Las Vegas Raiders in the third round of the 2020 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nEdwards attended Conway High School in Conway, South Carolina. During his career, he had 188 receptions for 2,562 yards and 32 touchdowns. He was selected to play in the 2016 U.S. Army All-American Game, but did not play due to injury. He committed to the University of South Carolina to play college football.\nCollege career.\nEdwards started all 12 games he played in his freshman year at South Carolina in 2016. He had 44 receptions for 590 yards and four touchdowns. As a true freshman, Edwards earned \"Athlon's\" Freshman All-America second-team honors and All-Southeastern Conference Freshman first-team accolades.

During his senior year in 2019, he passed Kenny McKinley's school record for career receptions and Alshon Jeffery's school record career receiving yards. He played in the first 10 games of the season before suffering a season-ending injury. He finished the season with 71 receptions for 816 yards and six touchdowns. For his career, he had 234 receptions, 3,045 receiving yards and 22 touchdowns.\nSouth Carolina football receiving records:\nProfessional career.\nLas Vegas Raiders.\nEdwards was selected by the Las Vegas Raiders in the third round with the 81st overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft. The Raiders obtained this pick along with two first round picks as part of the trade that sent defensive end Khalil Mack to the Chicago Bears.\nEdwards entered his first training camp competing for a starting job against Tyrell Williams, Nelson Agholor, Hunter Renfrow, Zay Jones, and fellow rookie Henry Ruggs III. At the end of the Raiders’ training camp, head coach Jon Gruden named Edwards and Ruggs as the starting wide receivers for the 2020 NFL season.\nEdwards made his first career start and NFL debut in the Raiders’ season-opening win against the Carolina Panthers, notching 1 reception for 9 yards on one target. The following week against the New Orleans Saints, Edwards recorded 2 receptions for 42 yards on two targets in the 34–24 win. In the Raiders’ Week 3 contest against the New England Patriots, Edwards recorded 2 receptions for 48 yards on 3 targets before leaving the game with an ankle injury. He missed Weeks 4 to 8 recovering from the injury. After returning from the injury in Week 9, Edwards lost his starting job to Nelson Agholor and took on a depth role for the remainder of the season. In the Raiders’ season finale against the Denver Broncos, Edwards recorded 2 receptions for 51 yards and his first career touchdown catch during the 32–31 win. Edwards finished his rookie season appearing in 12 games (3 starts) and recording 11 receptions for 193 yards and a touchdown.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn May 13, 2022, the Raiders traded Edwards along with a 2023 seventh-round pick to the Atlanta Falcons for a 2023 fifth-round selection.

He played college football at USC and was drafted by the Dolphins in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nJackson grew up in Phoenix, Arizona and attended North Canyon High School, where he played defensive and offensive line on the school's football team and also was a member of the basketball and track and field teams. Jackson was rated a five-star recruit and the best collegiate prospect in Arizona as a senior and committed to play college football at the University of Southern California over offers from Washington and Arizona State.\nCollege career.\nJackson played in all 14 of the Trojans games as a true freshman, appearing as a reserve offensive lineman and playing special teams on the field goal unit where he played on both sides and blocked a kick against Colorado. He was named USC's starting left tackle going into his sophomore year and started all 12 of the team's games.\nJackson missed part of the summer practices going into his junior season due having surgery to donate bone marrow to his sister, who has Diamond–Blackfan anemia. He returned to practice in early August and worked his way back to playing shape in time to begin the season as the Trojans starting left tackle. Jackson was named the Pac-12 Conference Offensive Lineman of the Week for Week 2 after his performance, which included blocking a 43-yard field goal attempt, in a 45–20 win over #23 Stanford on September 7, 2019. He was named first-team All-Pac-12 at the end of his junior year. Following the 2019 season, Jackson announced that he would forgo his senior year and declared for the 2020 NFL Draft. Jackson played in all 39 of USC's games during his collegiate career with 25 starts.\nProfessional career.\nJackson was drafted by the Miami Dolphins with the 18th pick in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft. The Dolphins previously traded defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick to the Pittsburgh Steelers to acquire the pick. Jackson made his NFL debut on September 13, 2020, in the season opener against the New England Patriots, starting at left tackle and playing all of the team's offensive snaps. Jackson was placed on injured reserve on October 9, 2020, after suffering a foot injury in Week 4 against the Seattle Seahawks. He was activated on November 7, 2020. He was placed on short-term injured reserve with an ankle injury on September 16, 2022.\nJackson entered the 2022 season as the Dolphins starting right tackle. He suffered an ankle injury in Week 1 and was placed on injured reserve on September 16, 2022. The Dolphins activated Jackson off of injured reserve on November 1. He was placed back on injured reserve on December 5.\nJackson returned as the Dolphins right tackle in 2023. After starting every game protecting the blindside of Tua Tagovailoa, he signed a three-year, $36 million contract extension with $20.7 million guaranteed.\nPersonal life.\nJackson's grandfather, Melvin Jackson, also played offensive line at USC and played in the NFL for the Green Bay Packers. In the summer of 2019, Jackson donated bone marrow to his younger sister Autumn, who had a rare form of anemia.\nHe is currently dating McKayla Rain whom he shares one son with, born in 2023."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Golden Eagles represent Marquette University in the NCAA's Big East Conference.\nMarquette began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1916. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Marquette's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Although 19 nations, with a total of 79 riders, competed, the eventing competition at the 1960 Olympics clearly went to the Australians.

Bill Roycroft, the fourth Australian team member, had fallen on cement drain pipes, resulting in a concussion and broken collar bone. Unfortunately, Brian Crago's mount Sabre was rejected at the final horse inspection, removing him from his current silver-medal position. In order to insure his team finished, Roycroft left the hospital to ride in the final phase, posting a clear round and insuring a team gold for his country.\nCompetition format.\nThe team and individual eventing competitions used the same results.

Returning to school for his senior season was Jefferson Vincent who had to earn his way back onto the team through several cuts and a demotion to the second squad. The potent combination of Vincent and Magner turned out to be instrumental in Cornell's success for the year.\nThe Big Red opened with a three-game series against Yale for the second consecutive year, this time playing in Chicago. Though the games were close Cornell was able to win each match. Magner and Crassweller played particularly well while Vincent recorded a hat-trick in the second game. On their way back east Cornell stopped in Cleveland for a two-game series against local colleges, winning both handily. Vincent notched his second 3-goal game against Western Reserve but it was Magner who starred with 5 scores to his credit.\nCornell opened its conference slate against defending champion Princeton and downed the Tigers with Magner and Vincent each providing 2 goals. After downing Yale for the fourth time that season Cornell entered the pivotal match against Harvard with a chance at their first championship. Both teams had shown themselves to be at the top of the collegiate hockey world with a combined 12–1 record and the winner was largely expected to claim the championship that season. The two teams fought a mostly even match with regulation ending in a 2–2 draw, but in the overtime Jefferson Vincent provided Cornell with perhaps its biggest single moment when he scored the game-winning goal.\nWhile Cornell had two more game to play, they were against the comparatively weaker Columbia and Dartmouth clubs. Both Magner and Vincent again scored twice in the team's shutout of Columbia while a 5–1 win over Dartmouth sealed Cornell's first IHA championship.\nThe planets did seem to align for Cornell in 1911 as their 10 wins was the highest total the team would reach for over 50 years (they wouldn't even play 10 games in a single season again until 1940). None of their games were played at home, owing to the extended road trip and the poor quality of ice on Beebe Lake, but having star forward Jefferson Vincent on the team a year after he should have already graduated was an offensive boon for the Big Red.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Razorbacks were coached by Dave Van Horn, in his 18th season with the Razorbacks, and played their home games at Baum–Walker Stadium.\nOn March 17, 2020, the season was officially declared over due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Razorbacks had a record of 11–5 when the season was cancelled.\nPreseason.\nThe Razorbacks played a two-game fall exhibition schedule; the Razorbacks opened on September 20 against Oklahoma at home, falling 3–4 in 14 innings.

First pitch on opening day was at 3:00 p.m. CST, followed by 2:00 p.m. on Saturday and 1:00 p.m. on Sunday.\nConnor Noland started the season on the mound for the Hogs; after allowing a leadoff single, he retired the next two batters on strikes and the third out came by way of a pickoff. In the bottom of the first, preseason All-American Heston Kjerstad drove in an RBI with a single to left field, giving the Razorbacks an early lead. The next three innings were scoreless for both teams, but the Arkansas offense came back to life in the fifth. Christian Franklin, with two outs, launched a two-run home run deep, scoring himself and Braydon Webb and giving the Hogs a 3–0 lead. Kjerstad added to the lead five pitches later with a home run of his own, extending the lead to four runs. EIU found the scoreboard in the top of the seventh on a fielding error, but Kjerstad made up for it with another solo home run, his second of the contest. From there, the Razorbacks were able to hold the score at 5–1 for an opening day win. For his innings of work, Noland received the win; he threw 86 pitches.

        "text": "Ben Healy (born 29 June 1999) is a professional rugby union player who plays as a fly-half for United Rugby Championship club Edinburgh. Born in Ireland, he represents Scotland at international level after qualifying on ancestry grounds.\nEarly life.\nHealy first began playing rugby for Nenagh Ormond in County Tipperary, and went on to captain Glenstal Abbey to their first Munster Schools Rugby Senior Cup in 2018, defeating Christian Brothers College 18–17 in the final. He also won representation for Munster at under-18, under-19 and under-20 level, as well as Ireland at under-18 and under-19 level.\nClub career.\nGarryowen.\nHealy started and scored 13 points for Garryowen as they beat City of Armagh 45–21 in the final of the 2018–19 All-Ireland Cup in April 2019.\nMunster.\nMunster moved to bring Healy into their academy immediately after he had completed his leaving cert, with Healy joining ahead of the 2018–19 season. He made five appearances for Munster A during the 2018–19 Celtic Cup, scoring 19 points.\nHealy made his senior competitive debut for Munster in their 2019–20 Pro14 round 7 fixture against Edinburgh on 29 November 2019, starting at fly-half and scoring 11 points in the provinces 18–16 defeat. He made his European debut for Munster in their final pool 4 fixture of the 2019–20 Champions Cup against Welsh side Ospreys on 19 January 2020.\nHealy came off the bench to replace starting fly-half JJ Hanrahan in Munster's opening 2020–21 Pro14 fixture away to Welsh side Scarlets on 3 October 2020, scoring ten points of the kicking tee, including the conversion of Kevin O'Byrne's 77th minute try to level the scores with just minutes remaining of the game, before scoring a 50-metre penalty in the 81st minute to earn a 30–27 win for Munster.\nOne week later, Healy started for Munster in their match against Edinburgh, scoring six of his seven penalties and converting CJ Stander's 76th minute try to earn a 25–23 win for the province. He joined the Munster senior squad on a one-year contract for the 2021–22 season. Healy scored his first try for Munster in their 31–17 win against Italian side Benetton in round 16 of the 2020–21 Pro14 on 19 March 2021. For his performances throughout the 2020–21 season, Healy was awarded the \"John McCarthy Award for Academy Player of the Year\".\nHealy signed a one-year contract extension in January 2022. He started in Munster's historic 28–14 win against a South Africa XV in Páirc Uí Chaoimh on 10 November 2022, scoring all four of his attempted conversions for eight points and a 100% kicking record during the match. Healy scored a 79th minute try and converted it to earn a 15–14 away win against Ulster in round 11 of the 2022–23 United Rugby Championship on 1 January 2023, a result that had seemed unlikely for much of the game.\nHealy earned his 50th cap for Munster in their 40–30 away win against Italian side Benetton in round 13 of the 2022–23 United Rugby Championship on 28 January 2023, and came on as a replacement in Munster's 19–14 win against the Stormers in the final of the 2022–23 United Rugby Championship on 27 May 2023.\nEdinburgh.\nHealy, who is Scottish-qualified, joined Edinburgh on a two-year contract from the 2023–24 season.\nInternational career.\nIreland.\nSelected in the Ireland under-20s squad for the 2019 Six Nations Under 20s Championship, Healy made his debut for the side when he came on as a replacement in their 34–24 win against Italy on 22 February 2019, before going on to start at fly-half in the wins against France and Wales, the latter of which secured Ireland's first grand slam in the tournament since 2007. He was retained in the under-20s squad for the 2019 World Rugby Under 20 Championship when it was confirmed in May 2019.\nScotland.\nHealy is Scottish-qualified through his maternal grandparents, and in 2020 the Scottish Rugby Union attempted to persuade him to join Glasgow Warriors. Though Healy rejected that offer and signed a one-year contract extension with Munster, Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend retained interest in him, and Healy would subsequently agree to join Edinburgh on a two-year contract from the 2023–24 season. He was selected in the Scotland squad for the 2023 Six Nations Championship following the announcement of his transfer to Edinburgh and an injury to fly-half Adam Hastings, and made his international debut for Scotland in their final fixture of the tournament against Italy on 18 March, featuring as a replacement during the second-half of their 26–14 home win.\nHealy made his first start for Scotland in their 2023 Rugby World Cup warm-up match against Italy on 29 July, scoring two conversions and two penalties in Scotland's 25–13 win, for which Healy earned the player of the match award, and he was subsequently selected in the final 33-man squad for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\nCareer statistics.\nInternational analysis by opposition.\nCorrect as of 30 September 2023."

        "text": "Germany's Alexander Zverev defeated Karen Khachanov of the Russian Olympic Committee in the final, 6–3, 6–1, to win the gold medal in Men's Singles tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics. It was both countries' first medals at the event since 2000, and Germany's first victory. In the bronze medal match, Spain's Pablo Carreño Busta defeated Serbia's Novak Djokovic, 6–4, 6–7(6–8), 6–3. En route to his bronze medal, Carreño Busta defeated the world's top two ranked players – the ROC's Daniil Medvedev and Djokovic.\n64 players from 31 nations competed.\nAndy Murray was the two-time reigning gold medalist, but withdrew before his first-round match due to a quadriceps strain.\nWorld No. 1-ranked Djokovic was attempting to win the fourth of five components of a potential Golden Slam (and the third man to do so across an entire career, after Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal), having already won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon Championships that year, but he lost to Zverev in the semifinals.\nThe medals for the competition were presented by Nenad Lalović, IOC Executive Board Member; Serbia; and the medalists' bouquets were presented by David Haggerty, ITF President; United States.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th (medal) appearance of the men's singles tennis event. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. Demonstration events were held in 1968 and 1984.\nNovak Djokovic was the favourite entering the tournament having won three consecutive Grand Slam titles earlier in the year. Top players not present, along with two-time defending champion Andy Murray, included Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Matteo Berrettini, Dominic Thiem, Roberto Bautista Agut, and Stan Wawrinka.\nEgypt made its men's singles debut. France made its 15th appearance, most among all nations, having missed only the 1904 event.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) can enter up to four players. Nations had been limited to four players in the event since the 2000 Games. Qualification for the men's singles is primarily through the ATP ranking list of 7 June 2021. An additional restriction is that players had to have been part of a nominated team for three Davis Cup events between 2017 and 2020 (with some exceptions). There are 64 quota places available for men's singles.\nThe first 56 are assigned through the world ranking.\nThere are six places available through continental qualification: four through continental tournaments (two in the 2019 Pan American Games, one in the 2018 Asian Games, and one in the 2019 African Games) and two through continent-restricted world ranking (one each for Europe and Oceania, which must come from NOCs with no other qualified competitors). The four continental tournament places take precedence over the world ranking, so the winners (João Menezes, Marcelo Tomás Barrios Vera, Denis Istomin, and Mohamed Safwat) are not counted toward the 56 (but are counted toward the four-per-nation limit).\nOne place is guaranteed to the host nation. If Japan earns a place through the world ranking, the host guarantee is not used and a 57th place is added to the ranking.\nIn an unusual career accomplishment qualification process, one spot is reserved for a former Olympic or Grand Slam champion that has not qualified through the current world rankings. The player must have won an Olympic gold medal or a Grand Slam singles final, be within the top 300 ranked players, and be from a nation that has not already qualified four players. If multiple players meet those criteria, the one with the most titles qualifies; if still tied, the highest ranked player qualifies. If no players meet those criteria, an additional place (57th or 58th) is added to the ranking. For the 2020 Games, this 'career wild card' quota was initially held by reigning double Olympic champion and three-time Grand Slam winner Andy Murray, but he was given a direct entry after several players withdrew. However he withdrew before he was due to play his first round match due to an injury.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. Matches were best-of-3 sets. A tiebreak was played in all sets reaching 6–6, including the last set of a match.\nIn a change from previous Olympics editions, the men’s final was played over three rather than five sets, for compensation to players who are competing in the later stages in all three categories: singles, doubles and mixed.\nSchedule.\nThe competition is held over nine days from 24 July to 1 August. Times given are the start of tennis sessions, though the men's singles shares courts with other tennis events."

The eventing competition at the 1960 Olympics clearly went to the Australians. The team had fantastic performances cross-country, with three of the four riders (Lawrence \"Laurie\" Morgan, Neale Lavis, and Brian Crago) in the top three spots of the competition following endurance day. Bill Roycroft, the fourth Australian team member, had fallen on cement drain pipes, resulting in a concussion and broken collar bone. Unfortunately, Brian Crago's mount Sabre was rejected at the final horse inspection, removing him from his current silver-medal position. In order to insure his team finished, Roycroft left the hospital to ride in the final phase, posting a clear round and insuring a team gold for his country.\nCompetition format.\nThe team and individual eventing competitions used the same results. Eventing consisted of a dressage test, a cross-country test, and a jumping test. The best three total individual scores counted for the team score; any team that did not have at least three members finish the competition was eliminated.\nResults.\n18 teams, totaling 72 riders, competed."

        "text": "The individual show jumping at the 1960 Summer Olympics took place on 7 September, at the Stadio Olimpico. The event was open to men and women. It was the 11th appearance of the event. There were 60 competitors from 23 nations. Each nation could have up to three riders. The event was won by Raimondo D'Inzeo of Italy, with his elder brother Piero D'Inzeo taking silver. The brothers (silver and bronze medalists, respectively, in 1956) were the second and third riders to win multiple medals in individual jumping; all three were Italian (Tommaso Lequio di Assaba had done it in 1920 and 1924). It was the nation's first gold medal in the event since Lequio di Assaba's in 1920; Italy's two golds tied France for most all-time. David Broome earned Great Britain's first medal in the event with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900. There were two separate jumping competitions for individual and team medals, the first time this had occurred since 1920.\nEight of the top 10 riders from the 1956 competition returned: gold medalist Hans Günter Winkler of the United Team of Germany, silver medalist Raimondo D'Inzeo of Italy, bronze medalist Piero D'Inzeo of Italy, fourth-place finisher Fritz Thiedemann of the United Team of Germany, sixth-place finisher (and 1952 gold medalist) Pierre Jonquères d'Oriola of France, eighth-place finisher Carlos César Delía of Argentina, ninth-place finisher Mohamed Selim Zaki of Egypt, and tenth-place finisher Pat Smythe of Great Britain. \nAll three of the World Champions to date were competing. Raimondo D'Inzeo had followed his Olympic silver with the 1956 World Championship, with Spain's Paco Goyoaga, the inaugural World Champion in 1953, had finished second and Thiedemann third. Winkler had two World Championships (1954 and 1955) along with his 1956 Olympic gold. \nNew Zealand, the United Arab Republic, and Uruguay each made their debut in the event. France and Sweden both competed for the 10th time, tied for the most of any nation; Sweden had missed only the inaugural 1900 competition, while France missed the individual jumping in 1932.\nSummary.\nThe individual medals were fought out between the two d'Inzeo brothers, Raimondo and Piero, David Broome, and Argentinean Naldo Dasso. The first round saw Raimondo d'Inzeo and Posillipo with the single clear, followed by Naldo Dasso with 4 penalties, and Piero d'Inzeo and his mount Max Fresson with eight. David Broome (7 penalties) had the best ride of the second round, while Piero d'Inzeo and Hans-Günter Winkler each had 8 faults, and the leader, Raimondo d'Inzeo had 3 rails down for 12 faults. Raimondo d'Inzeo's final score of 12 was still enough to win the gold, followed by his brother Piero and David Broome.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used the two-round format introduced in 1952. The course was 840 metres long with 14 obstacles, including one double jump and one triple jump for a total of 17 jumps. The time limit was 2 minutes and 5 seconds; every second over the limit incurred a 0.25 point penalty. There were also penalties for obstacle faults. Each horse and rider pair completed the course twice, with the two scores summed to give a final total for ranking.\nThe individual and team events were separate, with the individual scores not used for team competition.\nResults.\n60 riders competed, with 1 additional rider (A. Capuzzo of Italy) entered but not starting."

Teams which participated at the 2017 World Baseball Classic automatically qualified for the 2023 tournament. The qualifying round consisted of two tournaments to be participated by six teams each. The qualifiers were planned to be hosted in Tucson, Arizona in the United States but after the delay, the qualifier hosts were changed to the cities of Regensburg, Germany at Armin-Wolf-Arena and Panamá City, Panama at Estadio Rod Carew. Winners and runners-up of each of the two tournaments qualified for the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\nThe first qualifying tournament was originally scheduled to be held from March 13–18, 2020 and the second from March 20–25, 2020, before the qualifiers' postponement was announced on March 12, 2020, by Major League Baseball due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In resolving the 2021–22 Major League Baseball lockout, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association agreed that the World Baseball Classic would return in 2023 and that qualifiers would begin in September 2022.\nPools composition.\nThe format was double-elimination. Each pool contained six teams, two of which are given a bye to the second round. The highest ranked teams in the WBSC World Rankings (the Czech Republic and Germany in Pool A, and Panama and Nicaragua in Pool B) received the byes.\nFour of the teams had previously participated in the main WBC tournament: Panama and South Africa in 2006 and 2009 (which were by invitation), and Brazil and Spain in 2013. All four had participated in all qualifying tournaments.\nArgentina played in WBC qualifiers for the first time, replacing the Philippines, which appeared in previous qualifying tournaments held in 2012 and 2016. The other 11 teams had all previously participated in WBC qualifying. Two have previously won their qualifying group and qualified for the main tournament (Brazil, Spain), six have previously finished as high as second in their qualifying group (Germany, Great Britain, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, South Africa), Two have previously finished as high as third in their qualifying group (Czech Republic, France), and one has previously finished last in its qualifying group (Pakistan)."

The event appeared at the first Olympic boxing tournament in 1904, was not held in 1908, and then has been held at every Games with boxing since (1920 through 2020). The 2020 tournament will be the first since 1964 that flyweight is the lightest men's weight class; the men's light flyweight class was eliminated after 2016 as the sport moved toward gender equality. The weight range for the class was changed from 49–52 kg to 48–52 kg.\nReigning Olympic champion and World Champion Shakhobidin Zoirov of Uzbekistan has qualified to make an Olympic title defense in Tokyo. Zoirov is a professional and has a 3–0 record.\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter only 1 qualified boxer in the weight class. There were 28 quota places available for the men's flyweight, allocated as follows:\nThitisan Panmod from Thailand withdrew before the competition.\nCompetition format.\nLike all Olympic boxing events, the competition is a straight single-elimination tournament. The competition begins with a preliminary round, where the number of competitors is reduced to 16, and concludes with a final. As there are fewer than 32 boxers in the competition, a number of boxers will receive a bye through the preliminary round. Both semi-final losers are awarded bronze medals.\nBouts consist of three three-minute rounds with a one-minute break between rounds. A boxer may win by knockout or by points. Scoring is on the \"10-point-must,\" with 5 judges scoring each round. Judges consider \"number of blows landed on the target areas, domination of the bout, technique and tactical superiority and competitiveness.\" Each judge determines a winner for each round, who receives 10 points for the round, and assigns the round's loser a number of points between 7 and 9 based on performance. The judge's scores for each round are added to give a total score for that judge. The boxer with the higher score from a majority of the judges is the winner.\nSchedule.\nThe flyweight starts with the round of 32 on 26 July. There are four rest days before the round of 16 on 31 July and two more rest days before the quarterfinals on 3 August. After that, there is only one rest day between rounds with the semifinals on 5 August and the final on 7 August."

        "text": "The women's middleweight boxing event at the 2020 Summer Olympics took place between 28 July and 8 August 2021 at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan. 17 boxers from 17 nations competed, Khadija El-Mardi from Morocco having withdrawn before the competition began.\nThe medals for the competition were presented by Battushig Batbold, Mongolia; IOC Member, and the medalists' bouquets were presented by Morinari Watanabe, Japan; BTF Chair.\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the women's middleweight event; the event has been held every Summer Games since the introduction of women's boxing in 2012. It has been at the 69–75 kg range each appearance.\nReigning World Champion Lauren Price of Great Britain won the event.\nLight heavyweight World Champion Zemfira Magomedalieva of Russia also qualified at this weight (the middleweight is the heaviest Olympic women's class), and won a bronze medal. The 2012 and 2016 Olympic champion, Claressa Shields of the United States, turned professional and did not attempt to qualify.\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter only 1 qualified boxer in the weight class. There were 17 quota places available for the women's middleweight, allocated as follows:\nThe host nation, Japan, was guaranteed a minimum of two places across the five women's boxing events; because Japan qualified boxers in the flyweight and featherweight through the Asia &amp; Oceania tournament, no host places were used in any women's weight class. No Tripartite Commission invitation was used in this weight class.\nCompetition format.\nLike all Olympic boxing events, the competition is a straight single-elimination tournament. The competition begins with a preliminary round, where the number of competitors is reduced to 16, and concludes with a final. As there are fewer than 32 boxers in the competition, a number of boxers will receive a bye through the preliminary round. Both semifinal losers are awarded bronze medals.\nBouts consist of three three-minute rounds with a one-minute break between rounds. A boxer may win by knockout or by points. Scoring is on the \"10-point-must\" system, with 5 judges scoring each round. Judges consider \"number of blows landed on the target areas, domination of the bout, technique and tactical superiority and competitiveness.\" Each judge determines a winner for each round, who receives 10 points for the round, and assigns the round's loser a number of points between 7 and 9 based on performance. The judge's scores for each round are added to give a total score for that judge. The boxer with the higher score from a majority of the judges is the winner.\nSchedule.\nThe middleweight starts with the round of 16 on 28 July. There are two rest days before the quarterfinals on 31 July, five more before the semifinals on 6 August, and one more before the final on 8 August."

        "text": "The Super Bowl XXX halftime show occurred on January 28, 1996, at the Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona as part of Super Bowl XXX and featured American entertainer Diana Ross. The show was produced by Radio City Music Hall. The performance was entitled \"Take Me Higher: A Celebration of 30 years of the Super Bowl\".\nThe show featured a number of Ross' songs, both from her solo career and her time in The Supremes. The show made use of pyrotechnics, special effects, and stadium card stunts. Ross made many costume changes throughout the performance.\nHistory.\nRoss had previously performed the national anthem at Super Bowl XVI in 1982.\nThe singer had developed a show which would last for a duration of thirteen-and-a-half minutes. Broadcaster NBC demanded that she shorten the performance to twelve minutes. After she pleaded with them to allow her to keep the performance unabbreviated, they relented to allow her a thirteen-and-a-half minute time slot.\nSynopsis.\nRoss, in a red minidress, started the performance standing on a crane, which lowered her onto the stage as sparklers were illuminated on the bottom of the crane, while singing \"Stop! In the Name of Love\". Hundreds of dancers occupied the field surrounding the stage, spelling out Ross' name.\nRoss then sang three more songs from her days as part of The Supremes: \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\", \"Baby Love\", and \"You Can't Hurry Love\". \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" saw Ross make an onstage costume change into an orange and purple colored dress, before performing \"Chain Reaction\" and \"Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)\". The performance of \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" saw a yellow-robed choir joining the singer.\nThe show ended with Ross singing \"I Will Survive\" and \"Take Me Higher\" from her 1995 nineteenth studio album of the same name. The singer exclaimed, \"Oh my, here comes my ride,\" as a helicopter came into the stadium and carried her off the field.\nReception.\nCritical.\nRoss’ halftime performance has been ranked positively among Super Bowl halftime shows. Her performance was cited as The Weeknd's favorite halftime performance; he would later go on to perform for the Super Bowl LV halftime show.\nRoss was cited for extravagant wardrobe changes during the performance.\nCommercial.\nIn the week following her performance, Ross' newest album, \"Take Me Higher\", saw a 74% increase in sales, selling 3,000 copies in the week following the performance."

The tournament had a smaller set of fixtures than previous editions to accommodate the 2019–20 Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League, and was used as preparation for the first Test match against the Pakistan cricket team. South Zone were the defending champions.\nIn the opening round of matches Tamim Iqbal, batting for East Zone, made the highest score in first-class cricket by a Bangladeshi batsman, with 334 not out. In the final round of matches, South Zone made an unusual declaration, with their score at 114/4, thinking they would prevent Central Zone from earning bonus points and ensuring that they progressed to the final. However, they made a mistake in the points calculation, but still managed to progress after the match was drawn. East Zone also progressed to the final, following their eight wicket win against North Zone.\nOn 16 February 2020, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced that the final would be scheduled to be played across five days, starting on 22 February, unlike the usual four-day matches that were used in the rest of the tournament. South Zone won the tournament, after they beat East Zone by 105 runs in the final."

As well as playing in the Pro14, the team competed in the Champions Cup in Europe on the back of the previous season's league performance. They were drawn into pool 5 with Gloucester, Montpellier and Toulouse, and finished bottom of the table. In addition to the league and European competitions, the Connacht Eagles development side again competed in the Celtic Cup. The Eagles finished third in the regular season of the eight-team competition, just two points behind finalists Ulster A.\nOn 12 March 2020, with 13 of Connacht's 21 fixtures in the regular season of the Pro14 completed, the league was put on indefinite hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic. The competition resumed in August, with the remaining fixtures replaced by two rounds of derby games for each team. Connacht ultimately finished fourth in their conference. This was enough to earn entry to the 2020–21 Champions Cup after it was expanded to 24 teams on a one-season basis due to the pandemic.\nSenior team transfers.\nUnlike most seasons, where the bulk of transfers occur during the summer pre-season the 2019–20 season saw two separate periods of major transfer activity.

The team coached by Igor Kokoškov and led by team captain Miloš Teodosić failed to qualify for the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nBackground.\nSerbia were qualified for the Qualification tournament by taking the 5th place at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. On 15 November 2019, the Basketball Federation of Serbia has awarded the hosting right of one out of four FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments.\nOn 13 March 2020, FIBA suspended all FIBA competitions considering the situation with the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. On 30 March, the Summer Olympics has been rescheduled to 2021 due to the same reason. On 9 April, FIBA announced that the Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments are rescheduled to 2021.\nThe Serbia roster entered the Qualification tournament four months after the end of the EuroBasket 2022 qualification where they finished with the first place in Group E with a 4–2 record and got qualified for EuroBasket 2022.\nRoster.\nOn 31 May 2021, head coach Igor Kokoškov announced a 25-man preliminary roster for the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. The 25-man roster includes six NBA players: guard Bogdan Bogdanović, forwards Nemanja Bjelica, Aleksej Pokuševski, and Alen Smailagić, as well as centers Nikola Jokić and Boban Marjanović; then two All-EuroLeague Team members for the 2020–21 season: guard Vasilije Micić and forward Vladimir Lučić; as well as six domestic league players. Furthermore, the roster includes three high-profile-leagues regular season MVPs for the 2020–21 season: Jokić (NBA), Micić (EuroLeague), and Miloš Teodosić (EuroCup).\nCenter Jokić announced his withdrawal on 16 June, stating that his \"body condition requires a longer absence from the court to recover\". On the same day, head coach Kokoškov announced withdrawals of two more NBA players, Pokuševski and Smailagić. Also, coach Kokoškov said the guards Micić and Teodosić and forwards Lučić and Nikola Kalinić will rest during the Acropolis Tournament. Guard Nemanja Nedović will skip the Olympic Qualifying Tournament due to injury. Furthermore, guards Marko Gudurić, Ognjen Jaramaz, forward Lučić and the 2019 World Cup team captain Miroslav Raduljica were also cut out from the roster due to injuries.\nOn 27 June, head coach Kokoškov announced the 12-man final roster for the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. In the end, forward Branko Lazić and center Nikola Milutinov was cut from the roster due to health issues while guard Vanja Marinković and the Bosnian-born forward Dalibor Ilić did not make it to the final roster. On 30 June, guard Stefan Jović got a soleus muscle injury in the second game and will miss the rest of the tournament.\nThe average height of players in the roster is 2.01 metres (6 ft 7 in) which makes the Serbians the tallest roster in the Belgrade Tournament. Standing at 2.22 metres (7 ft 3 in), center Marjanović is the tallest player in the tournament. The average age of the players in the Serbia roster is 29 years old.\nThe following is the Serbia roster in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament.\nDepth chart.\n&lt;section begin=\"depthchart\" /&gt;&lt;section end=depthchart/&gt;\nEarlier candidates.\nThe following were candidates to make the team:\nStaff.\nAt the end of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup where Serbia won 5th place, head coach Aleksandar Đorđević announced his decision to leave the position after six years. On 20 November 2019, the Basketball Federation of Serbia named Igor Kokoškov the new head coach of the Serbia team. In December, Dejan Milojević and Vladimir Jovanović were named assistant coaches. On 15 January 2020, the Federation added the Denver Nuggets head coach Michael Malone to the coaching staff for the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. In May 2021, Kokoškov added conditioning coach Marko Sekulić to his coaching staff. In June 2021, Aleksandar Matović was added to the staff as a player development coach. As of June 2021, the Nuggets head coach Malone did not join the Serbia staff as it was announced.\nExhibition games.\nThe Serbia roster played four exhibition games and went undefeated at 4–0. The team played at the 2021 Acropolis of Athens Tournament together with Greece, Puerto Rico and Mexico from 18–20 June 2021. They won the Acropolis Tournament for the second time after went undefeated at 3–0. Afterwards, Serbia won one more game over Mexico in Belgrade on 23 June.\nTournament.\nThe draw was held on 27 November 2019 in Mies, Switzerland. Serbia was drawn into the Belgrade Tournament Group with the Dominican Republic, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Italy, and Senegal. These matches were originally scheduled to take place between 23 June and 28 June 2020 in Aleksandar Nikolić Hall, Belgrade, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to 29 June to 4 July 2021. Teams are divided into two groups. Serbia was drawn into Group A with the Dominican Republic and New Zealand.\nIf Serbia finishes as one of the top two teams in its group, they will advance to the final round of the Belgrade Tournament and will play against one of the top two finishers of Group B, which is composed of Puerto Rico, Italy, and Senegal.\nOn 26 February 2021, Basketball New Zealand announced that they will pull out of the tournament. On the same day, FIBA announced that they will be replaced by the Philippines as the next best team from the Asia-Oceania region in FIBA World Rankings. On 28 June, Senegal canceled their participation in the tournament due to COVID-19 outbreak in their roster so they will be fortified 0–20 in both scheduled games of Group B.\nThe winning team of this tournament will qualify for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.\nPreliminary round.\n\"All times are local UTC+2.\"\nDominican Republic.\nThe game was originally scheduled for 23 June 2020, and rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Serbia roster finished strong at the opener, beating the Dominican Republic 94–76. While the Serbians had a bit of a point cushion at the end, it wasn't an easy win at all.\nSerbia entered the game in a dunk mode, with six of the first ten points coming by throw-downs from Boban Marjanović, Ognjen Dobrić, and Nemanja Bjelica for an early 10–2 lead. But the Dominicans answered back. Led by Víctor Liz and Gelvis Solano, they came back and then took the first lead of the game two minutes before the halftime, 46–45, before it was all tied up 47–47 after a very intense first half. With the third quarter coming to a close, the Serbians raised their game up a notch as they carried this momentum into the fourth where they found their best defense, energy, and offensive rhythm. The turning point was a zone defensive scheme by Serbia's head coach Igor Kokoškov at the start of the final quarter helped his team buckle down for a 9–0 run. From then on, Serbia took an advantage they would only increase until the final buzzer. Outscoring the Dominican Republic 27–10 over the final ten minutes of the game gives them some level of confidence going forward in the tournament. Center Marjanović finished with a double-double, recording 18 points and 10 rebounds for a total efficiency plus-minus score of 27. He was 7-of-12 in the paint and 4-of-4 from the line. Center Filip Petrušev added 17 points of the bench, and guard Vasilije Micić recorded 16 points and five assists. As expected, Serbia dominated the points from the paint 58–24 but didn't take advantage in rebounding as maybe was a plan (43–37). Fast break points also played a significant role, as the \"Eagles\" picked up 24 of them, mainly in the fourth quarter, compared to just nine from the Dominicans.\nPhilippines.\nThe game was originally scheduled for 24 June 2020, and rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This will be the second competitive game between Serbia and the Philippines. Previously, Serbia had a 126–67 won over the Philippines at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup in China on 2 September 2019.\nSerbia grabbed a vital 83–76 win over the Philippines. Serbia needed a thrilling finish to withstand the \"Gilas\" but the victory nonetheless sees the reigning Olympic silver medalists into the Belgrade Olympic Qualifying Tournament as the first-place team from Group A to advance to the Semi-Finals.\nThe Serbia side was in front from the tip-off till the R. J. Abarrientos lay-up at 3:50 to go in the fourth quarter, but on the wings of Boban Marjanović's dominance in the paint, his team finds a way out. Serbia head coach Igor Kokoškov decided to rest three players from starting a previous line-up due to minor injuries (Nemanja Bjelica, Nikola Kalinić, and Vasilije Micić). But, a massive problem for the home team occurred in the middle of the fourth quarter, when Stefan Jović helped to leave the floor. After leading the for 36 minutes, Serbia allowed the Gilas to take their first and only lead of the game, 74–73. But, in a similar fashion to Serbia's tournament opening game the previous night, they found a way to win it by closing with a 10–2 run. After a fantastic season in his club Crvena zvezda mts, Ognjen Dobrić continued his growth in a national team jersey, putting up 16 points while going 4-from-7 from the three point line. Center Marjanović also showed off his double-double stats mode with 25 points and 11 rebounds. Center Angelo Kouame shined in the Philippines team with 17 points and 7 rebounds. After a poor three-point shooting night against the Dominican Republic in the tournament opener, the \"Eagles\" found some rhythm out of the line, scoring 9 from 26 shots. Also, Serbians have a massive advantage over rivals in the points from the paint, 46–28.\nFinal round.\nSerbia finished as the group winner in its preliminary group and advanced to the semi-finals of the 2020 FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Belgrade and played against the runner-up of Group B, which will be Puerto Rico, on 3 July.\n\"All times are local UTC+2.\"\nSemi-final: Win over Puerto Rico.\nSerbia and Puerto Rico previously met on multiple occasions. Serbia won over Puerto Rico at the 2016 Olympic Qualifying Tournament Final in Belgrade, as well at the 2019 World Cup in China. Most recent, Serbia had an 80–68 win over Puerto Rico at the Acropolis Tournament on 18 June.\nAfter two lukewarm games to start the tournament, Serbia found a way to turn up the heat in an intensely contested game against Puerto Rico to win, 102–84. It's a win-and-you're-in game with a place in the Olympic 12-team tournament on the line. Nemanja Bjelica's three-pointer to beat the first-quarter buzzer saw Serbia take a 28–26 lead, one they would never relinquish, much to the delight of fans in Belgrade. Puerto Rico's side started the game with intensity and aggression that led to a pretty solid first quarter. Then came Bjelica' early dagger dime and the Serbians team took control thereafter, finding a strong offensive rhythm. The ball was moving well; the numbers of assisted points started to rise to the tune of 30 assists and 12 triples. Guard Vasilije Micić continued to play his MVP basketball after one game of rest. He scored 23 points and dished 8 assists. Forward Bjelica also stepped up, contributing with 18 points and 8 rebounds. Guard Miloš Teodosić led the team in assists with 10.\nThe victory puts the defending Olympic silver medalists into the Sunday Final where they will face Italy.\nThe Final: Lost to Italy.\nThe Italian roster will play this summer at the Tokyo 2020 men's basketball Olympic tournament with their 102–95 victory over Serbia in the FIBA Olympic qualifying tournament final. Fueled by their fantastic three-point shooting display as the Italians earned their first Olympics appearance since the 2004 Athens Games, where they won the silver medal. Italian made it rain from beyond the arc seemingly all night in Belgrade as they made 14 three-pointers. Many of their attempts fell at the very crucial moments of the game, an instrumental reason why the Italians will be making their country's 13th Olympics appearance in history.\nThe Italians relied on two of them, actually. The first was at the start of the game where they were able to stretch Serbia's defense, which paid off as the Italian's triple-point shots were falling. It was crowned with 25–9 to finish the first half after trailing by four (36–32 to 45–57). The second came with another precise shooting run in the second half that stopped Serbia from mounting an early comeback. The boys in blue played outstanding team basketball in the Final. The \"Azzurri\" also benefited from a career game from Achille Polonara. His two-way, double-double performance of 22 points and 12 rebounds earned him a total efficiency score of 32. Polonara was justly awarded the MVP Award following his team receiving their cardboard cutout ticket to Tokyo. Romeo Sacchetti's squad outrebounded the home team by small (39–36), but took 12 of them in the offensive end. And while most of the statistics were on Serbia's side in the end, the key was the fantastic shooting performance by the \"Azzuri\" team: 48 percent for 2 points, 41 percent for 3 point."

        "title": "1993–94 Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1993–94 Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey team represented the Lake Superior State University in college ice hockey. In its 4th year under head coach Jeff Jackson the team compiled a 31–10–4 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the eighth time. The Lakers defeated Boston University 9–1 to win the championship game at the Saint Paul Civic Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota.\nSeason.\nAfter coming up just shy of defending their national title Lake Superior was hoping to keep their recent success going. While they lost leading scorer Brian Rolston to the pros, the Lakers returned their next five point-getters and fielded a team full of players who had made consecutive deep runs in the NCAA tournament.\nMiddling start.\nThe Lakers began the season with four wins against conference opponents but when they hosted the class of the CCHA, Michigan, in early November Lake State suffered its first loss of the year. Worryingly, the next night against Bowling Green also ended in a loss for the Lakers, who had built their success under Jeff Jackson by being neatly unbeatable at home. After a pair of road wins Lake Superior could only manage a home split against Notre Dame who was still recovering from nearly losing their program a decade earlier. Lake Superior ended the first half of their conference schedule with a loss at Michigan State, dropping to 7–4 and looking like a shadow of the team that had been 20 minutes away from a national championship eight months earlier.\nTournament season.\nThe Lakers headed to Alaska to participate in the Great Alaska Face–Off, a tournament held by Alaska–Fairbanks. Unlike most in-season tournaments each team would play one another and the tournament champion would be the team who finished with the most points. Despite having played just two days prior and having to deal with the jetlag from the 3,500 mile journey, the Lakers swept through the competition, winning each game and winning the second iteration of the tournament.\nlake Superior got two full weeks to recover from the trip before they hit the ice again and they continued their winning streak with another pair of road wins. After splitting a road series the Lakers got another week off before they headed to Minneapolis for the Mariucci Classic. Lake Superior began with the long-awaited rematch against Maine and got a small measure of revenge with a 2–1 win. LSSU then battled Minnesota for the tournament title and required double overtime to decide the winner but when the dust settled it was Lake Superior who held the crown.\nSliding.\nLake Superior barely got a breather after the arduous tournament before they were thrown back into the fire. The Lakers headed to Michigan to take on a Wolverine team that was thus far undefeated in conference play. Lake State fought valiantly in the first game, narrowly missing with a 3–4 loss in overtime but after Michigan's win in the second game Lake Superior had dropped to 9–6 in the CCHA, 13 points behind the Wolverines. After recovering with three points against Ohio State the Lakers against suffered a home split then played three overtime games in a week that ended with mediocre results.\nRecovery.\nThe Lakers got the first week of February off and when they returned to game action that were already out of the running for the conference championship (with 8 games still to play). One bright spot, however, was that Michigan had been so dominant against the CCHA that the three losses Lake State suffered were mirrored by their competition for the 2nd-seed. The Lakers began their final stretch against Michigan State, who they had to beat if they wanted a top seed, and they blitzed the Spartans with a surprising 11–1 win. LSSU earned three points in the series after tying the second game then captured another three points to pull into a tie for third with Western Michigan.\nWith the Spartans 2 points ahead with 4 games to play, the Lakers' couldn't have asked for a better schedule than to play Illinois–Chicago and Kent State in consecutive weekends. While the team knew they should beat their weak competition, how they performed was miraculous nonetheless. Up to that point in the season senior starter Blaine Lacher had had a good season but he finally earned his first shutout of the year against UIC. After Lacher allowed only one goal in the rematch the Lakers found themselves in a tie for second with the Broncos after Michigan State's disastrous weekend. Lacher continued his hot streak by shutting out Kent State in consecutive games and after Western Michigan failed to keep pace the Lakers ended the season with a 2nd-place CCHA finish.\nCCHA tournament.\nLake Superior's reward was facing 10th-seed Ohio State in the first round and bye into the semifinal should they win. The Buckeyes proved they were no match for the Lakers when they failed to score in wither of the two games, allowing Lacher to run his shutout streak almost to 300 minutes, a new program record. The quarterfinal bye allowed the Lakers to rest while MSU got in a dogfight with Miami and when the two met the Spartans couldn't beat Lacher who posted his fifth consecutive shutout and was approaching the all-time NCAA shutout record.\nLacher and the Lakers faced a tall task in the conference title game against Michigan and at least early on it appeared that they might have a chance for both the title and the record. However, just after his 375th minute of scoreless play, Lacher finally surrendered a goal and the near-miss to the record seemed to deflate the team. Lake Superior could only muster 15 shots against a ferocious Wolverine defense and the Lakers fell 0–3, ending their three-year reign as CCHA tournament champions.\nNCAA tournament.\nDespite catching fire at the end of the season Lake Superior only received the 4th western seed and would have to face Michigan in the regional semifinals. That game, however, could only happen if the Lakers could get past Northeastern. The Huskies hadn't played well to end the season but they were still able to put up a fight against Lake Superior, scoring five times and pushing LSSU into their 11th overtime game of the season. Lake Superior had lost as many extra-session games as they had won to that point but they were able to get above .500 and advance to the second round.\nLake Superior wrapped up their stay in East Lansing against the only CCHA team they hadn't defeated all year. The fifth meeting between the two looked like it was going to go the same way as the first four when Michigan opened the scoring 9 minutes in but Lake State responded by scoring three times in just over three minutes to give themselves a 2-goal edge after the first. The Wolverines recovered in the third and methodically took over, firing 20 shots at Lacher and scoring three times to retake the lead but a goal by Kurt Miller, with just 3 seconds left in the second period, tied the score at 4-all. The Laker goal seemed to sap the energy from the Wolverines and the two teams played the final frame a bit more evenly. Neither was able to score and the two teams headed into overtime. Both teams appeared nervous at the start with only one shot being recorded in the first two and a half minutes, but when Rob Valicevic got the first Laker shot of the session it ended up in the back of the net and the Lakers had landed their white whale.\nThe Lakers headed to Saint Paul for a meeting with Harvard. Lake State's third game of the tournament ended in much the same manner as the first two with overtime being needed but team captain Clayton Beddoes' goal just past the 4-minute mark sent Lake Superior to its third consecutive championship game. The three nail-biting finishes had left their mark on the team with Jeff Jackson downing Tums and Blaine Lacher finding hair coming off in his mask.\nTheir final game came against the top eastern seed, Boston University, and they were expecting to weather a storm from the favored Terriers who had outscored opponents by more than 40 goals in the first period alone that season. Instead, it was the Lakers who got off to a hot start with one goal in the first period to BU's none. The score might have been a surprise but what was truly shocking was how poorly Boston University had played; the Terriers had only been able to muster 2 shots on goal in the first 20 minutes, and that didn't bode well for their chances. When Kurt Miller put the Lakers' up 3–0 the shot chart read 21–3 in the Lakers favor. BU did score in the second period but by then the route was on and Lake Superior ended up scoring nine goals from seven different players. The 9–1 win was the largest margin of victory and most goals scored by one team since 1961. More importantly was the fact that Lake Superior finally got a national championship without a cloud of controversy hanging over the victory.\nAwards and honors.\nSean Tallaire received the tournament MOP on the back of his two goals but the award could have gone to any number of Laker players with their dominating performance. Tallaire was joined by Blaine Lacher, Keith Aldridge, Steve Barnes and Clayton Beddoes on the All-Tournament team, tying the record for the most players by one team in a season. Blaine Lacher finished with a program-record 1.98 goals against average and 6 shutouts on the season (still program bests as of 2019) but his heroics went unrecognized by award voters as only Beddoes made the AHCA West second-team. Even in their conference the Lakers could only manage two All-CCHA Second Team nods (garnered by Beddoes and Aldridge) but in the end the national championship made up for any slights.\nThe 1993–94 Lakers became only the second national champion to play more road games than home games during the season (1977–78 Boston University).\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "2020 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2020 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2020 National Rugby League season held at Sydney's ANZ Stadium on October 25. The match was contested between minor premiers Penrith Panthers and second-placed Melbourne Storm. Melbourne led the game 22-0 at half-time before holding off a late Penrith comeback to win 26-20, claiming their fourth premiership title. Melbourne fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as the official man of the match. The match was attended by 37,303 spectators due to an enforced limit to stadium capacity by the NSW government as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. The game would be the last for Melbourne hooker and captain Cameron Smith after announcing his retirement in the following year, making him the most-capped player in the NRL with 430 games, and the most for a single club.\nThe match was preceded by the 2020 NRL Women's Premiership Grand Final, where the Brisbane Broncos defeated the Sydney Roosters 20–10 to win their third premiership title in succession, and their second Grand Final win against the Roosters after the teams met in the inaugural NRLW Grand Final in 2018.\nPre-match entertainment was headlined by Australian indie pop singer Amy Shark. The match was broadcast live throughout Australia by the Nine Network.\nBackground.\nIt was the first time the Penrith Panthers and the Melbourne Storm met in an NRL Grand Final, and in a finals match in general. The Penrith side were awarded the minor premiership for the third time in the club's history, and were aiming to secure a third premiership; the Panthers having secured both titles in 1991 and 2003. It was Ivan Cleary's second Grand Final appearance as a coach, having led the New Zealand Warriors to a 10–24 loss against Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in 2011. It was the Storm's fourth Grand Final appearance in five years, winning the 2017 premiership and runners-up in 2016 and 2018.\nPenrith and Melbourne finished first and second respectively on the regular season ladder. The two sides previously met at Campbelltown Stadium in round 6, with the Penrith side defeating Melbourne 21–14. As a result of restrictions imposed by the Victorian Government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, Melbourne were forced to play the remainder of the season outside their home state, with the club winning their home games at Kogarah Oval and Suncorp Stadium, before playing their remaining six home games at Sunshine Coast Stadium, which all resulted in wins. Both sides won their respective Qualifying Finals: the Penrith side narrowly defeated the reigning premiers Sydney Roosters 29–28 at Panthers Stadium, and the Storm beating Parramatta Eels 36–24 at Suncorp Stadium. In the subsequent Preliminary Finals, Melbourne would go on to defeat 2019 runners-up Canberra Raiders 30–10 at Suncorp Stadium, with the Penrith side defeating the South Sydney Rabbitohs 20–16 at ANZ Stadium.\nPre-match.\nBroadcasting.\nThe match was broadcast live on the Nine Network and delayed on Fox League in Australia and Sky Sport in New Zealand. Radio broadcasters include ABC, Triple M, 2GB, SEN and Koori Radio.\nCurtain-raiser matches.\nCurtain-raiser matches on the day will include two matches\nTeams.\nJames Tamou, Apisai Koroisau, and Zane Tetevano were the only players in the Penrith line-up to have had previous NRL grand final experience after winning premiership titles for the North Queensland Cowboys in 2015, South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2014, and Sydney Roosters in 2018 respectively. Halfback Nathan Cleary played his 100th first-grade match. Ryan Papenhuyzen, Brenko Lee, Justin Olam, Jahrome Hughes, Tino Fa'asuamaleaui, and Nicho Hynes were the only Melbourne players to make their NRL grand final debut (although Hynes spent the entire match on the bench), while Cameron Smith, Suliasi Vunivalu, Cameron Munster, Jesse Bromwich, Kenny Bromwich, and Dale Finucane played in each of the Storm's last three grand final appearances. Only Cameron Smith and Jesse Bromwich have played in further grand finals for Melbourne.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;section begin=2020 NRL Grand Final/&gt;&lt;section begin=scoreboard/&gt;&lt;section end=scoreboard/&gt;&lt;section end=2020 NRL Grand Final/&gt;\nFirst half.\nThe first points came when Melbourne's Justin Olam attempted to score in the fourth minute. The referee ruled “no try”, but a video review showed that Penrith’s Tyrone May had kicked the ball out and ordered a penalty try. Cameron Smith converted. In the seventh minute Josh Mansour appeared to have scored for the Penrith side, but it was disallowed for a Stephen Crichton obstruction. Penrith made errors twice and Smith took advantage with two penalty goals. Later Nathan Cleary misdirected a pass which Suliasi Vunivalu intercepted, running 80 meters for a length of field try. With a minute remaining, Smith scored his first grand final try, right under the goal posts. It was initially called “no try”, until replays showed Apisai Koroisau knocking the ball from his hands. Smith converted and the half finished 22–0 in favour of Melbourne.\nSecond half.\nFive minutes into the second half, Ryan Papenhuyzen ran 70 metres to score from a scrum, this turned out to be Melbourne's last points for the night. When all looked lost for the Penrith side, Isaah Yeo ran behind his teammate then kicked the ball and Brian To'o scored in the corner in the 53rd minute. The video referee controversially awarded the try, which likely would have been called for obstruction had any Storm players been attempting a tackle; as there was no attempt to tackle, the try stood. In the 67th minute Papenhuyzen leapt over the touchline to knock a Penrith penalty kick back into play. Two minutes later, Luai passed to Stephen Crichton, who scored, bringing the score to 12–26. In the 71st minute, Viliame Kikau ran into Jahrome Hughes in an attempt to chase the ball and score a try. The video referee ruled a professional foul and Hughes was sent to the sin-bin. Two minutes later, Jarome Luai threw a long ball to Josh Mansour who scored bringing the scores to 16–26 with seven minutes left. Nathan Cleary missed the conversion. With just over a minute left in the match Brandon Smith was sinbinned for a professional foul, reducing Melbourne's men to 11, Penrith took advantage and scored with a fast try to Cleary. With the clock ticking down and about 20 seconds remaining, Cleary declined the conversion, knowing that this move would give Penrith extra time to try to draw level on the last play. If he elected to attempt the conversion, the remaining time on the clock would have elapsed. Shortly after the kick-off, the siren sounded, and with the ball still live, Penrith players passed desperately, but it was eventually intercepted by Melbourne Storm's Felise Kaufusi, ending the game.\nRyan Papenhuyzen was judged best on field, winning his first Clive Churchill Medal. This is only the 2nd ever Grand Final in which 20 or more points were scored in both halves, the first being the 2001 NRL Grand Final. On both occasions the side which ultimately won had established a score of greater than 20 points to 0 in the first half and held on against a 20 or more points comeback by the opposition in the second half.\nNRL Women's Premiership Grand Final.\nThe 2020 NRL Women's Premiership Grand Final was the culmination of the 2020 NRL Women's season."

        "text": "The India women's cricket team toured England to play the England women's cricket team in June and July 2021. On International Women's Day 2021, Jay Shah, the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), stated that the India team would play a one-off Women's Test match against the England team. India women last played a Test match in November 2014, against South Africa. In April 2021, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed the fixtures for the tour, including the one-off Test match, three Women's One Day International (WODI) and three Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) matches.\nA points-based system was used across all three formats of the tour, with four points for winning the Test match, two points if the Test was drawn, and two points for each win in the limited overs matches.\nThe one-off Test match ended in a draw, despite England making a big first-innings lead and enforcing the follow-on. England won the first WODI by eight wickets to record their 100th win at home in the format. England then won the second WODI match by five wickets, to win the series with a game to spare. India won the final WODI by four wickets, with England taking the series 2–1. England won the first WT20I, with India winning the second match. Therefore, England took an 8–6 lead in the points-based system into the final match of the tour. England won the third WT20I by eight wickets, to win the WT20I series 2–1 and to win 10–6 in the points-based system.\nDuring the third WODI match, India's Mithali Raj became the leading run-scorer in women's international cricket. She went past Charlotte Edwards' previous record of 10,273 runs.\nBackground.\nOriginally, the tour was scheduled to take place in June and July 2020. The tour was to consist of four WODIs and two WT20Is. However, on 24 April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ECB confirmed that no professional cricket would be played in England before 1 July 2020, with the tour being postponed. In May 2020, Clare Connor, the Director of Cricket for the ECB, suggested that India could take part in a tri-series with the touring South African team during September 2020. However, on 20 July 2020, reports stated that India would not tour, due to the impact of the pandemic in India.\nThe Test match was played on a used pitch from a men's game in the 2021 t20 Blast from the previous week. The ECB later apologised for the situation.\nSquads.\nOn 9 June 2021, England named a squad of 17 players for the one-off Test match. Two days later, Freya Davies and Sarah Glenn were released from the squad allowing them to play in the 2021 Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy ahead of England's one-day matches."

        "text": "The South Africa women's cricket team toured England to play against the England women's cricket team in June and July 2022. Originally, South Africa were scheduled to tour England in September 2020. The tour was scheduled to consist of four Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs) and two Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is), with all the matches taking place at the County Cricket Ground in Derby. However, in August 2020, the tour was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2022, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced a new schedule for the tour, consisting of three WODI matches, three WT20I matches, and a one-off Women's Test match. It was South Africa Women's first Test match since they played India in November 2014. A points-based system was used across all three formats of the tour.\nFor the one-off Test match, England fielded four debutants, while South Africa had nine of their players earn their maiden Test cap. Batting first, Marizanne Kapp scored 150 runs before South Africa were bowled out for 284 by the close of play on day one. In reply, England made 417/8 before declaring their innings, with Nat Sciver and Alice Davidson-Richards both making centuries. However, across days three and four multiple rain interruptions meant the match ended in a draw. Nat Sciver was named as the player of the match for her 169 not out.\nEngland won the first WODI by five wickets, with Emma Lamb scoring her first century in an international match. In the second match, Sophia Dunkley also scored her first century in WODI cricket. England won the match by 114 runs to win the WODI series with a match to play. England won the third WODI by 109 runs to win the series 3–0.\nEngland won the opening WT20I match by six wickets, with Katherine Brunt taking her 100th wicket in the format. The win meant that England won the points-based series, taking an unassailable 10–2 lead into the final two matches of the tour. Nat Sciver captained England for the second WT20I, after Heather Knight was ruled out of the match with a hip injury. England won the match by six wickets, to win the WT20I series with one match left to play. Katherine Brunt became England's leading wicket-taker in WT20I cricket, taking her 103rd dismissal in the format. England won the third WT20I by 38 runs, winning the series 3–0, and finished the tour 14–2 winners on points.\nBackground.\nIn April 2020, England's series against the India women's cricket team was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A month later, Clare Connor, the Director of Cricket for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), suggested that this tour could become a tri-series with India and South Africa. On 18 June 2020, the ECB named a squad of 24 players to who will return to training, with ongoing discussions with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Cricket South Africa (CSA) about a possible tri-series. On 6 July 2020, the ECB confirmed discussions were still ongoing to host the matches, behind closed doors. However, on 20 July 2020, reports stated that India would not tour, due to the impact of the pandemic in India, with the ECB looking to add further matches between England and South Africa.\nWhen the ECB published the original fixtures for the tour in January 2020, the matches were scheduled to be played at six different venues around England. On 21 July 2020, the ECB announced that all the fixtures would take place at the County Cricket Ground in Derby. All of the team's training will also take place at the venue, in a bio-secure environment. As a result, Derbyshire County Cricket Club will play their Championship matches away from home when the season starts. On 23 July 2020, Cricket South Africa named a 24-woman squad to begin training in Pretoria ahead of the series. During the first week of August, England women played warm-up matches in Derby.\nOn 15 August 2020, the ECB confirmed that they were also in talks with Cricket West Indies. The West Indies women's cricket team could tour England in place of the South African team, due to an increase in coronavirus restrictions in South Africa. On 18 August 2020, Cricket South Africa confirmed that their women's team would not be travelling to England due to the pandemic. Despite the cancellation, the ECB also confirmed they were in talks with other cricket boards to host a possible tour in a bio-secure environment. On 25 August 2020, the ECB confirmed that the West Indies women's team would be touring England.\nSquads.\nIssy Wong was initially named as a travelling reserve for England Women's Test team. On 25 June 2022, Wong was added to England's Test squad, after Emily Arlott was ruled out of the match after not recovering from COVID-19. Prior to the WODI matches, South Africa's Lizelle Lee announced her retirement from international cricket. Ahead of the second ODI, Masabata Klaas and Delmi Tucker were added to South Africa's squad for the remaining matches of the series. For the WT20I series, Marizanne Kapp and Tumi Sekhukhune were both ruled out of South Africa's squad with Tazmin Brits added to their team."

        "text": "What the Golf? (stylized as WHAT THE GOLF?) is a sports video game developed by Triband. It was originally released for iOS and macOS (via Apple Arcade subscription) by The Label on 19 September 2019. Ports for Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 were released by Triband, respectively in 2019, 2020 and 2024.\nGameplay.\nThe game revolves around completing levels to progress on the world map. The goal of each level is to reach the hole. Every level of the game has a twist on traditional golf. Each section of the world map has its own theme, which the level's unique mechanics follow. \nDevelopment.\n\"What the Golf?\" was crowdfunded through American crowdfunding website Fig. The developers chose golf as the sport to ridicule, saying that it was \"mostly played by rich people, so it seemed like a safe target\". The levels in the game were designed to be short, to be able to try as many jokes as possible. Much of the game's humor is based around slapstick, as it was seen as a form of comedy that would work regardless of where the player was. The game's crown system was designed to make players revisit levels and for people who wanted to complete everything. The developers considered having unlockable skins for the golf ball, but the idea ended up being scrapped. The slow-motion feature was originally intended for the game's soccer level, but it was added to the rest of the game.\nRelease.\n\"What the Golf?\" released on 19 September 2019 for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS on Apple Arcade. A macOS version separate from Apple Arcade and a Windows port launched through the Epic Games Store on 1 October 2019. A Nintendo Switch port was released on 21 May 2020. A physical Nintendo Switch release was sold through Iam8bit alongside a vinyl soundtrack. A Steam version was released on 22 October 2020.\nMixed reality features for visionOS became available through Apple Arcade with the release of the Apple Vision Pro headset on February 2, 2024.\nReception.\n\"What the Golf?\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Sergio Velasquez of \"TouchArcade\" praised the element of surprise the game presented. Jordan Devore of \"Destructoid\" appreciated the game's comedic value. Christopher Livingston, writing for \"PC Gamer\", while also praising the comedy, enjoyed both the soundtrack and the challenge each level brought. However, James O'Connor of \"GameSpot\" did not enjoy the differences between the Windows and Apple editions."

        "text": "The 1900–01 Columbia men's ice hockey season was the 5th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nPrior to the Holiday break, team manager R. S. Woodward asked the university's permission for the ice hockey team to travel to Pittsburgh for a 4-game set against local athletic clubs. He did so because the ice hockey club was $75 in debt and the team was being offered $400 for the cost of expenses for the trip. Because the trip would take place during the school term, and because Columbia University policy prohibited any person or team with an outstanding debt from taking place in a public contest, permission for the trip was denied. Unfortunately the team had already committed itself to participating by signing a contract. As a result, when the team attempted to back out of the trip the Pittsburgh management threatened to sue. In an attempt to satisfy all parties, the ice hockey team reorganized itself as \"The Columbia Hockey Club Team\" and not as an official representative of the University.\nThe team traveled to Pittsburgh to complete their terms of the contract before returning home. After the break school administrators ruled that the eight men who had participated had violated university instructions and would be barred from representing Columbia University or participating in any university athletic event for the remainder of the school year. The disqualified students were: R. S. Woodward, A. Lawrence, A. Wolff, D. S. Hudson, A. Coggeshall, S. Campbell, W. Duden and F. X. O'Dwyer.\nAs a result, the team was forced to reorganize with most of the freshman squad and play out their Intercollegiate Hockey Association schedule. It wasn't much of a surprise when the team took a step back after a solid 1900 season. After the season all members of the team were reinstated with the exception of R. S. Woodward. This was done primarily so that the other teams the players were involved with were not punished as a result of the actions of the ice hockey management. Additionally, the administration expressed its appreciation at the way that the replacement team handled itself during the intercollegiate series.\nNote: Columbia University adopted the Lion as its mascot in 1910.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Columbia Lions men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Columbia Lions men's ice hockey is an ice hockey team club in New York City, associated with Columbia University since its establishment in 1896. It went dormant following its 1937 season, but was eventually revived as a club team. It remains active in the 2020s.\nHistory.\nColumbia was one of the first colleges in the United States to play ice hockey. The team benefitted from being virtually next door to the St. Nicholas Rink, one of the earliest artificial ice rinks in the country. Columbia played continually from 1896 through 1915, routinely competing against the best programs in the nation. They brought in experienced players to help improve the team like Tom Howard and Percy LeSueur but a disagreement between college administrations dealt a mortal wound to the program.\nEarly in the 20th century, the NCAA's precursor was formed to set down rules that all schools would abide by. At the time Ice Hockey was not governed by a national body (the NCAA would ignore the sport until after World War II) which left the few schools that fielded teams able to decide the rules for themselves. The major competitors, the teams that would later form the Ivy league, decided that they would prohibit freshmen from participating and limit players to 3 years of varsity play. Of the schools that were members of the Intercollegiate Hockey Association, only Columbia did not agree to the rules. As a result, the Lions were expelled from the IHA. The team's removal then caused the operators of the St. Nicholas Rink to close their door on the team, putting the program in dire straits in the middle of the 1912–13 season. While the IHA would collapse entirely after the season, Columbia had not been a big draw to the Rink over the previous few seasons and the St. Nicholas operators were hesitant to give the Lions any additional ice time. After playing an entire season on the road, Columbia managed to get a 'test' game at the Rink in order to prove that the ice hockey team was enough of an attraction. The Lions played what was described as an exciting game, but the audience was too small and the team was forced to find another home.\nColumbia struggled for several years, battling poor weather conditions and a lack of facilities. but were unable to play a single game between 1915 and 1921. The team finally returned when they were able to secure the 181st Street Ice Palace as a home. The rink was mostly used for speed skating and was smaller than most ice hockey rinks of the time. The team played well in spite of their circumstances but, just three years later, they were forced to halt playing once again. The team remained dormant for most of the next decade but was revived in the mid-1930s. By that time the administration was no longer prepared to support the team and the Lions were compelled to perform as a club team and played under that distinction for three years. In 1937 the school decided to sponsor the program again and Columbia played a schedule composed mostly of amateur clubs but did perform well at times. After the season the two players responsible for resurrecting the team, Chris McFadden and Jack McMahon, both graduated. Without their presence, or a head coach to keep the team alive, the program was allowed to wither away and vanish.\nSeveral years later the team resurfaced as a club team once more but the university had not made any plans to promote the program to varsity status (as of 2022). In the 2021–2022 season, the Columbia Lions defeated Sacred Heart 9–3 to win the MCHC Championship. The club departed from the American Collegiate Hockey Association and was promoted to Division II status under the Amateur Athletic Union for the 2023–24 season, where it would compete in the Empire Collegiate Hockey Conference.\nSeason-by-season results.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "Jack Sanders (March 10, 1917 – October 26, 1991) was an American football guard who played for four seasons in the National Football League (NFL). After playing college football for SMU, he was drafted by the New York Giants in the 17th round of the 1939 NFL Draft. He played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1940 to 1942, before enlisting in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. He fought in the Battle of Iwo Jima as a first lieutenant in March 1945, and had part of his left arm amputated due to injuries sustained from an explosion while testing underwater demolitions. On August 17, 1945, he signed a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, and became the first World War II disabled veteran to sign an NFL contract. He played in three games for the Eagles in 1945. In the first game of the season, against the Green Bay Packers, the United States Armed Forces paid to send 22,000 amputees to the game to watch Sanders play.\nSanders became the line coach for the Trinity University football team in 1946, but the school did not field a team that season due to budgetary limitations. On October 10, 1947, he was named temporary head coach of the team to allow previous head coach and athletic director Bob Coe to spend more time overseeing the entire athletic department. Sanders resigned as head coach on January 4, 1949, and accepted a position as an assistant superintendent of a construction company.\nOn August 29, 1966, Sanders announced his application to the NFL in a bid to be awarded the ownership of an expansion New Orleans franchise as the 16th NFL team. He said that if the New Orleans franchise were selected and awarded to him, he would enlist 30,000 minority owners and own 52% of the team himself. He was advised by former Chicago Cardinals, Detroit Lions, and Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Buddy Parker. On November 1, 1966, the NFL awarded the 16th franchise to New Orleans. William G. Helis Jr., Herman Lay, John W. Mecom Jr., Louis J. Roussel Jr., Sanders, and Edgar B. Stern Jr. were the six bidders for the franchise. The New Orleans franchise was awarded to Mecom on December 15, 1966, with his winning bid of $8.5 million."

        "title": "2021 British Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2021 British Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Pirelli British Grand Prix 2021 for sponsorship reasons) was a Formula One motor race held on 18 July 2021 at the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire, England. It was the tenth round of the 2021 Formula One World Championship and also featured the first ever \"sprint qualifying\" event in F1 - a new format run on the Saturday of the race weekend over a distance of . 3 points were awarded to the winner of the Sprint, 2 to 2nd place and 1 to 3rd place. The results of the sprint qualifying decided the grid for the race on Sunday.\nThe sprint qualification was won by Max Verstappen, giving him pole position for the race, while the race was won by Lewis Hamilton, who won his record eighth British Grand Prix. On the first lap of the race, Verstappen and Hamilton collided going into \"Copse\" corner, which took Verstappen out of race and earned Hamilton a ten-second time penalty for causing a collision. Hamilton went on to win the race from Charles Leclerc and Valtteri Bottas.\nBackground.\nThe event, which was held over the weekend of July, was the only Formula One race at Silverstone in 2021, after the venue had held two races behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom during 2020; the 2020 British Grand Prix was won by Lewis Hamilton, while the other one-off race, the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix, was won by Max Verstappen. This was the seventy-second time the British Grand Prix had formed a part of the world championship. In February 2021, the organisers at Silverstone Circuit said they hoped the race would have a capacity 140,000 crowd, but that this was dependent on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, which had forced the two races held at Silverstone in 2020 to be behind closed doors. Hamilton aimed to win the event for a record-breaking eighth time, having won the event seven times overall previously having first won the event in 2008 and going for his third consecutive British GP win having won the event the previous two seasons. The United Kingdom government allowed fans to return to live major sporting events on 17 May 2021 in limited numbers.\nOn 14 June 2021, the United Kingdom's government announced that a planned further easing of lockdown restrictions in England would be delayed from an original date of 21 June 2021 to 19 July 2021, a delay of four weeks and the day after the Silverstone race took place. This meant Silverstone would require special exemption to gain a capacity crowd and the circuit began work with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to try and establish how many fans the venue would be allowed to host. On 24 June 2021, the British Grand Prix was given permission to take place with a full capacity crowd as a part of United Kingdom government's events research programme with ticket holders either required to provide evidence of negative lateral flow test carried out 48 hours before their attendance of the event or proof of double vaccination against the virus fourteen days before attending the first day of the event. Upon being asked for his reaction to news about Silverstone being permitted to have a capacity crowd, Hamilton said in a press conference prior to the Styrian Grand Prix that he feared allowing such big numbers of spectators to attend the event were \"premature\" but some of his fellow drivers, notably George Russell and Verstappen, were more positive about the news. Reportedly more of the spectators were women than in previous years.\nOn Thursday 15 July, one day prior to start of the weekend action, Lando Norris admitted in an interview to Craig Slater of Sky Sports his preparations for his home race were not ideal, stating he was \"sore\", \"not in the perfect condition\", and he was \"struggling to get sleep\" after he was mugged in an incident at Wembley Stadium after the UEFA Euro 2020 Final. Also on 15 July, McLaren made a statement confirming that three of their team had tested positive for COVID-19. Notably, chief executive officer Zak Brown was one of the three who were positive. Neither of the drivers had to self-isolate and the plans for the weekend were \"unaffected.\" The event marked the seventieth anniversary of Scuderia Ferrari's first world championship Grand Prix win. A full-scale mock-up model illustrating what cars built to the planned 2022 aerodynamic regulations will look like was revealed at the venue on the Thursday before the Grand Prix.\nFollowing the Austrian Grand Prix, Verstappen led the Drivers' Championship from Hamilton by 32 points, who leads third placed Sergio Pérez by 46 points. Red Bull Racing led Mercedes by 44 points in the Constructors' Championship. The drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list, with no additional stand-in drivers for the race. Sole tyre supplier Pirelli allocated the C1, C2, and C3 compounds of tyre to be used in the race. The weekend saw the race debut of new rear-tyre construction following a successful test in practice at the previous event in Austria. The new construction is designed to improve safety, by preventing rear-tyre failures, such as those experienced by Lance Stroll and Verstappen at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix earlier in the season.\nWeekend format.\nThe 2021 British Grand Prix was the first race in the season to implement the new sprint-qualifying format, with two others expected to do the same later in the season. It was agreed after the FIA, Formula One and all ten teams had reached a unanimous agreement, regarding the schedule of the weekend. This saw a change in the weekend format as well as the rules. Usually, Friday would host two practice sessions, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. Saturday would have the final practice in the morning with qualifying in the afternoon. Sunday would have just one session, the race. The sprint qualifying changes this format, and on a Friday there would be one practice session in the early afternoon and a traditional qualifying (to determine the sprint-qualifying starting order) in the evening. On a Saturday, the second practice would take place at noon, with a newly added sprint race happening in the afternoon. Sunday is unchanged in this format. This also meant that this was the first F1 weekend for many years with a Friday qualification season.\nFormula One's director of data systems Rob Smedley said the sport would do the best it could to make sure that sprint-qualifying races do not become a \"blur\" for fans. Whilst ex-World Champion Sebastian Vettel has voiced his scepticism over the sprint-qualifying idea, drivers such as Hamilton, Carlos Sainz Jr., Fernando Alonso, and Russell have reacted positively with Formula One willingness to try a new format. Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc suggested the sprint-qualifying experiments should not continue in the future if they were proven to be unsuccessful. Leclerc also said he believed that sprint qualifying would enable drivers to push \"for a whole race\". Changes to sporting regulations to accommodate sprint qualifying were approved by teams prior to the Austrian Grand Prix ready for approval from the FIA. Hamilton later revised his opinion, and he thought the new format probably \"would not be too exciting\" and saw it being \"a train\". Formula One managing director Ross Brawn said that the sprint-qualifying experiment could be the first of many Formula One format experiments. The weekend was the first time since the 1959 German Grand Prix at AVUS (where results of the Grand Prix itself were decided on aggregate with drivers completing two 30-lap heats) that a Grand Prix meeting had consisted of more than one race for Grand Prix cars during a weekend.\nSprint qualifying.\nThe sprint qualifying is a , seventeen laps for this event, race which would decide the starting order for the race on Sunday. The grid order for sprint qualifying would be decided via the normal Q1, Q2, Q3 qualifying session. The final classification of the sprint qualifying race would be the starting grid for the race. The winner of the sprint qualifying would be on pole. Additionally, sprint qualifying awards points to the top three finishers. The maximum time limit would be 60 minutes, and normal fuel flow limits would still apply. The top three in sprint qualifying would also be given a victory parade and special wreaths for their efforts.\nPractice.\nThe first free practice session commenced on Friday at 14:30 BST in warm sunny conditions. Verstappen of Red Bull topped the timing sheets, 0.779 seconds ahead of Norris, who was second for McLaren. Reigning World Champion Hamilton was third for Mercedes, just 0.001 seconds slower than second-placed Norris.\nThe second free practice session took place on Saturday at 12:00 BST in sunny conditions. Verstappen topped the timing sheets again, 0.375 seconds ahead of Leclerc. Leclerc's teammate Sainz, was in third, 0.230 seconds behind. There were no major incidents in either of the practice sessions.\nQualifying.\nQualifying took place on Friday at 18:00 BST. Hamilton set the fastest time in qualifying, granting him first place for sprint qualifying ahead of Verstappen in second and his teammate Valtteri Bottas in third. As the winner of sprint qualifying would be given the title of \"polesitter\", the driver who set the fastest time was instead named the event's \"speed king\". Formula One's chief technical officer Pat Symonds said that control over how the title of pole position is declared lies with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile and not Formula One Management.\nSprint qualifying.\nSprint qualifying took place on Saturday at 16:30 BST and was contested over seventeen laps. Hamilton lost out at the start with Verstappen overtaking him into first place. Verstappen had had trouble getting his car's tyres up to temperature in the cooler temperatures of qualifying, but it was much warmer for the sprint. Bottas and Leclerc remained in the third and fourth positions they started in for the duration of the sprint. Alonso went from eleventh to fifth in the first lap, while Nikita Mazepin hit his Haas teammate Mick Schumacher, causing Mazepin to spin on track. Also on the first lap, Russell and Sainz made contact, resulting in Sainz dropping down to 19th place; Russell was handed a three-place grid penalty by the FIA. The next major incident was when Pérez lost control of his car on lap 5, spinning off into the gravel. He was able to carry on but later retired on lap 16. Alonso, who finished the sprint in seventh, was given a warning for moving in the braking zone, to which he responded by saying that he intended to continue driving the same way for the rest of the year. Alonso was passed by the two McLaren drivers without much resistance, as they had faster cars than him, but he was then able to hold off Vettel's Aston Martin AMR21. Formula One held the event with the intent to analyse the views of audiences on the format, and noted that there had been both positive and negative reactions.\nRace.\nThe race started at 15:00 BST (14:00 UTC). Hamilton had a better start than Verstappen, and they ran side by side through the first corner, each contesting for the lead throughout the first half of the lap. A better run out of the fourth turn allowed Hamilton to briefly get ahead going in to the sixth turn, but Verstappen was able to get back past on the inside, with Hamilton then accelerating faster than Verstappen out of the seventh turn. Hamilton collided with Verstappen into Copse corner, with Verstappen's rear-right tyre stripped from the wheel rim. Verstappen slid sideways across the gravel trap on the outside of the track, and collided with the tyre wall at at least .\nThe crash saw a red flag brought out following Verstappen's retirement, with the race suspended for fifteen minutes while Verstappen's car was removed and the tyre wall repaired. Hamilton received a ten-second time penalty for causing the collision, with stewards ruling that Hamilton was predominantly, but not fully, at fault in the contact. Hamilton's car was repaired during the stoppage. Verstappen was taken to the circuit medical centre, and subsequently hospital, for precautionary checks after the sideways impact into the barriers. Verstappen was released from hospital later that night as he was not seriously injured.\nThe collision with Verstappen caused Hamilton to lose speed, allowing Leclerc to get through into the lead before the race was neutralised. Hamilton pitted from second, served his ten-second time penalty and came back out fourth. He quickly dispatched Norris's McLaren and then his teammate, Bottas, who was instructed to let Hamilton past. Norris suffered a slow pit stop following an issue with the rear right tyre, placing him behind Bottas in fourth as he rejoined the race, where he remained for the rest of the race. Norris lost further time after emerging from the pit lane as he had to clear Alonso. This was the fifteenth consecutive race in which Norris finished in the points. Bottas's water bottle broke during the race. Leclerc struggled with intermittent power issues throughout the first half of the race, with momentary losses of power keeping the interval between him an Hamilton at around 1.5 seconds. Hamilton caught up to Leclerc on lap 50, where he overtook him for the lead. Hamilton's move on Leclerc was similar to the one he made on Verstappen, but with less fuel in the tank and warmer tyres Hamilton did not understeer this time around and held the apex. Leclerc had a little moment mid corner that caused him to run wide on the exit, allowing Hamilton to complete the overtake. Leclerc had led for almost the entire race, which was seen as unexpected given the relative pace of the Ferrari SF21 to the Mercedes W12 and the Red Bull RB16B.\nVettel lost control of his Aston Martin during a battle with Alonso on the fourth lap. This saw Vettel drop down to last; he recovered into 17th, but later retired. Kimi Räikkönen, in the Alfa Romeo, also spun, on lap 49, after a minor collision with Red Bull driver Pérez. Pérez pitted on the next lap for new soft tyres, in a bid to take Hamilton's fastest lap away (which is worth a championship point). Scuderia AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly had a puncture late in the race, which dropped him out of the points.\nPost-race and retrospective.\nMuch of the post-race debate surrounded the Hamilton–Verstappen incident on the first lap, with the collision compared by some to previous collisions which have occurred during close championship battles, and the likelihood of incidents under such circumstances also being noted. Verstappen said that the penalty issued to Hamilton mid-race was not enough, and felt Hamilton's post-race celebrations were \"disrespectful and unsportsmanlike\". Mercedes said that they would not have celebrated the win had they not known Verstappen was uninjured. Hamilton said that he did not believe himself to be at fault, adding that \"regardless of whether I agree with the penalty, I'll take it on the chin and I just kept working.\" Hamilton expressed relief that Verstappen was uninjured.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner called Hamilton's move \"desperate\" and his victory \"hollow\". He also said \"[w]e are lucky that there wasn't someone seriously hurt. That's what I'm most angry about\", and that he could not \"see how Lewis can take any satisfaction from the win when you have put your fellow competitor and driver in hospital.\" Horner said Verstappen was winded in the crash. Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko accused Hamilton of dangerous driving and suggested that the seven-time champion be banned for one race. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff defended Hamilton, stating that it was merely a racing incident and \"it always takes two to tango\", and brushed off Marko's criticism of Hamilton. Wolff believed that Hamilton's move complied with the sport's guidelines on when an overtaking driver is entitled to a corner, as Hamilton was further alongside Verstappen than the diagrams provided to competitors illustrated, although said guidelines stipulate that this only applies if the driver \"make[s] the corner cleanly.\" Mercedes trackside engineer Andrew Shovlin stated that the collision was \"inevitable\", citing Verstappen's aggressive driving style. Red Bull were also concerned about the financial cost of repairing or replacing a crashed racing car. According to Horner, the damage amounted to at least £1,300,000.\nSeveral drivers, including Leclerc and Bottas, believed that it was a racing incident, with Sainz adding that it was \"difficult to judge\". Leclerc (who was the next car behind Verstappen and Hamilton) noted: \"There was space on the inside. Maybe Lewis was not completely at the apex but it is also true Max was quite aggressive on the outside. Things happen.\" Daniel Ricciardo said that Hamilton \"went in too hot\" but felt that the collision was unintentional, and that the aerodynamic design of the cars was a major contributing factor. Alonso believed neither Hamilton nor Verstappen had done anything wrong, suggesting Hamilton was at a tricky position.\nFormula One sporting director Brawn said that he hoped the incident would not be repeated, adding that \"nobody wants the championship decided on crashes and penalties.\" Indycar Series championship leader Alex Palou who would win the title later that year said that he would have done the same thing as Hamilton or Verstappen in either of their positions. Race director Michael Masi stood ground with the stewards' decision, stating that the stewards do not take the consequences of an incident into account when deciding penalties.\nHamilton became the target of racial abuse online following the race. Fellow competitors Red Bull and McLaren (with whom Hamilton won his first Drivers' Championship title in 2008), along with Formula One and other members of the Formula One community, also condemned those who were racist against Hamilton. Social media firm Facebook, Inc criticised the abuse and said they had deleted some offensive comments from their platforms.\nSeveral drivers expressed disappointment in their post-race results, with Norris and Sainz in particular stating that their long pit stops endured during the race cost them a better result, the former a potential podium finish. Regarding his own race, Leclerc said that he \"gave not 100%, but 200%.\" Pérez lamented that he would have finished in seventh had he not taken a third stop to take away the fastest lap extra point from Hamilton as well as his late clash with Räikkönen, with Gasly echoing similar thoughts after a third stop for a late puncture denied him a potential points finish. Räikkönen felt that he had spent most of his race trying to prevent faster cars from getting past him. In the build up to the Hungarian Grand Prix on 27 July Red Bull requested the right to review the severity of Hamilton's penalty for the incident with Verstappen but the Stewards dismissed it. Red Bull's motivation for lodging the appeal was questioned in some quarters, with the potential negative public relations outcomes being noted. In a post-season interview Verstappen (who now was a World Champion) said being in hospital after the crash was among the lowest points of his title winning 2021 season. Verstappen told the \"GP Racing\" magazine the following year that he no longer had any ill feeling with Hamilton over the accident."

        "title": "2021 Italian Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2021 Italian Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Heineken Gran Premio d'Italia 2021) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 September 2021 at Autodromo Nazionale Monza. It was the 14th round of the 2021 Formula One World Championship and the second Grand Prix in Italy in the season, after the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix on 18 April. The 53 lap race was won by McLaren driver Daniel Ricciardo, who capitalised on a good front-row start and an accident between Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to take the race lead. Ricciardo was joined by Lando Norris in second with Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas in third. It was Ricciardo's first victory since the 2018 Monaco Grand Prix, and so far remains his latest race victory. In addition, the race was McLaren's first victory since Jenson Button's victory at the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix, McLaren's first 1-2 finish since the 2010 Canadian Grand Prix, and also McLaren's first win at Monza since the 2012 Italian Grand Prix. As of 2023, this is the final Grand Prix appearance for Robert Kubica.\nBackground.\nThe event, held over the weekend of 10–12 September at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, was the fourteenth round of the 2021 World Championship. The race took place one week after the Dutch Grand Prix and precedes the Russian Grand Prix. It was the home Grand Prix for Antonio Giovinazzi, Ferrari and AlphaTauri. Pierre Gasly is the previous race winner, having won the 2020 event.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nAfter Max Verstappen's win at the Dutch Grand Prix, he took the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 224.5 points. He led Lewis Hamilton by three points. Valtteri Bottas' third place at the previous race saw him jump Lando Norris, leaving Bottas in third, trailing his teammate by 98.5 points. Norris was fourth, on 114 points, while Sergio Pérez was fifth, eight points behind Norris.\nMercedes retained their lead of the Constructors' Championship, leading Red Bull by 12 points. After a double points finish, Ferrari jumped McLaren into third place, with McLaren 11.5 points behind. Alpine stayed fifth, 80 points behind McLaren.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with the only exception being Kimi Räikkönen, who was replaced by Robert Kubica, as was the case in the preceding , when Räikkönen tested positive for coronavirus.\nTyre choices.\nSole tyre supplier Pirelli allocated the C2, C3, and C4 compounds of tyre to be used in the race.\nWeekend format.\nThe event was the second, of three, to implement a trial weekend format. The first race to use this format occurred during the British Grand Prix. The change in format means that Free practice 1 and qualifying took place on the Friday. Free practice 2 and sprint qualifying took place on the Saturday, while the race is the sole event on the Sunday.\nThe sprint qualifying is a race which would decide the starting order for the race on Sunday, for this event this is equivalent to 18 laps. The grid order for sprint qualifying was decided via the normal Q1, Q2, Q3 qualifying session. The final classification of the sprint qualifying race would be the starting grid for the race. The winner of the sprint qualifying would be on pole. Additionally, sprint qualifying awards points to the top three finishers: 3 for 1st, 2 for 2nd, and 1 for 3rd. The maximum time limit is 60 minutes, and normal fuel flow limits still apply. The top three in sprint qualifying would also be given a victory parade and special wreaths for their efforts.\nPractice.\nFree practice 1 took place at 14:30 CEST on 10 September. The first practice ended with no major incidents. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, with Max Verstappen in second and Valtteri Bottas in third.\nFree practice 2 took place at 12:00 CEST on 11 September. The first practice ended with one interruption. The red flag was brought out when Carlos Sainz Jr. spun and crashed at the Ascari chicane. He said over the radio that it \"hurt\" but he was cleared during the precautionary checks. The other Ferrari of Charles Leclerc, had to stop his session early because he was feeling unwell. His situation was monitored by medical staff and ultimately, he was cleared to take part in the Sprint. The session ended with Hamilton in first, Bottas in second and Verstappen in third.\nQualifying.\nQualifying took place at 18:00 CEST on 10 September. All three parts of qualifying ended with no major incidents. At the end of the first part of qualifying, Lewis Hamilton was fastest, with Valtteri Bottas second and Lando Norris third. The second part of qualifying saw Hamilton, Bottas and Norris go first, second and third, respectively. The final part of qualifying saw Bottas go fastest, with Hamilton second and Max Verstappen third.\nSprint qualifying.\nSprint qualifying took place at 16:30 CEST on 11 September. Valtteri Bottas kept first from the start and led all laps of the race. Lewis Hamilton lost four places at the second corner. He managed to make up one place, due to Pierre Gasly crashing out at Curva Grande. Gasly's crash was caused by contact with Daniel Ricciardo. The damage meant Gasly's front wing came off and subsequently went under his car, bouncing him through the gravel and into the wall. The stewards deemed it a racing incident and didn't apportion blame for the contact. The safety car was deployed due to this crash. Yuki Tsunoda and Robert Kubica also made contact on lap 1, resulting in Tsunoda losing his front wing and Kubica spinning into the gravel. Both drivers were able to carry on.\nAfter lap 1, the positions of the top 8 drivers did not change. The session ended with Valtteri Bottas, Max Verstappen, and Daniel Ricciardo finishing on the top three positions respectively. However, while Bottas finished first in sprint qualifying, Verstappen took pole position for the race, due to Bottas having a penalty for exceeding his quota of engine components, which demoted him to 19th. Ricciardo and his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris, was promoted to second and third for the grid respectively.\nIn the aftermath of the sprint qualifying, Sergio Pérez criticised the format, saying the sprint at Monza was \"very boring\" and did not add anything. Formula One managing director Ross Brawn defended it, saying there was \"plenty of action\". Fernando Alonso advocated for single lap qualifying (the qualifying system in Formula One previously used from the start of the season to end of the season) as a method of setting the grid for sprint qualifying.\nRace.\nThe race started at 15:00 CEST on 12 September. Daniel Ricciardo overtook Max Verstappen at the start to take the lead of the race while Lewis Hamilton passed Lando Norris at the start to take third position. Hamilton attempted an overtake on Verstappen into turn 4, but was pushed wide, causing him to lose positions to Verstappen and Norris. Further down the grid, Antonio Giovinazzi went off the track at turn 5 and rejoined the track into the path of Carlos Sainz Jr., with the two making contact. Giovinazzi was spun around and clipped the barrier, losing his front wing. Giovinazzi was given a 5-second time penalty for rejoining the track in an unsafe manner.\nRicciardo held Verstappen behind for 21 laps, until he pitted for hard tyres on lap 22. Verstappen entered the pits on the next lap, but was held for 11.1 seconds due to an issue with the right front tyre. While Verstappen was in the pits, Hamilton overtook Norris, prompting Norris to pit. Norris came out of the pits ahead of Verstappen, and Hamilton pitted for medium tyres on the following lap. Hamilton's stop was also slow, being stationary for 4.2 seconds. Due to this, Norris was able to overtake him, and Hamilton ended up side-by-side with Verstappen on the pit exit and into turn 1. Verstappen was squeezed into turn 2, bouncing over a sausage kerb and making contact with Hamilton's left rear tyre, launching Verstappen's car into the air and over the top of Hamilton's car. Both drivers were uninjured, but were forced to retire from the race. This was Hamilton's first retirement in 63 races, the previous being the 2018 Austrian Grand Prix.\nThe crash brought out the safety car. Charles Leclerc and George Russell took advantage by pitting during the safety car period, resulting in Leclerc and Russell exiting the pits in second and ninth, respectively. On the safety car restart, Norris overtook Leclerc to move up into second place. A few laps later, Sergio Pérez attempted an overtake on Leclerc into turn 4, but went off the track; Pérez took third place from Leclerc, but was given a 5-second time penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage. On lap 34, Valtteri Bottas overtook Leclerc to take fourth place. Pérez held off Bottas until the end of the race, but dropped to fifth after the race due to his penalty.\nRicciardo finished first, winning his first race since the 2018 Monaco Grand Prix, and taking the first win for McLaren since Jenson Button did so for the team at the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix. Norris finished second, making it a one-two finish for McLaren; their first since the 2010 Canadian Grand Prix when Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button were driving for the team. Bottas rounded out the podium places, finishing the race in third. Damage to his Aston Martin's front wing meant that Sebastian Vettel could not finish higher than twelfth. Kubica's fourteenth-place finish allowed him to move ahead of Nikita Mazepin into twentieth place in the standings.\nPost-race.\nAfter the race, Verstappen and Hamilton were summoned to the stewards regarding their crash. The stewards ruled that Verstappen was predominantly at fault and awarded him a three-place grid penalty for the following race in Sochi, as well as two penalty points on his Super Licence. Hamilton said he was proud of the stewards for being willing to give Verstappen a penalty for the incident. Three-time Formula One World Champion Sir Jackie Stewart criticised Verstappen's behaviour following the incident with Hamilton, saying he was \"taking longer than expected to mature\". The FIA will also carry out a safety investigation into the Hamilton-Verstappen crash after considering it an 'unusual incident'. Meanwhile, race winner Ricciardo stated that that was the first time he had ever been overwhelmed by winning, especially considering he had been consistently outperformed by teammate Lando Norris in the first half of the season. Norris himself felt he could have challenged Ricciardo, but decided it would be in the best interests of the McLaren team not to, fearing challenging his teammate could have resulted in a Hamilton-Verstappen-style crash between the pair."

The tournament was shortened, due to rain, from 72 to 36 holes. Both the second round on Friday and the fourth round on Sunday were cancelled and only the Thursday and Saturday rounds were counted in the competition. The World Cup, previously named the Canada Cup, had been shortened before, due to bad weather; 1963, 1972 and 1984, but it was the first time since the event was instituted in 1953, that two full rounds were lost.\nIt was a stroke play team event with 32 teams. Each team consisted of two players from a country. The combined score of each team determined the team results. The Australia team of Peter Fowler and Wayne Grady won by three strokes over the Spain team of José María Cañizares and José María Olazábal. The individual competition was won by Fowler. Beside the prize money mentioned, Fowler won additional US$10,000 for having the lowest individual score in the first round and the Australia team won additional US$10,000 for the lowest team score the first day.\nScores.\nTeam\nInternational Trophy\nSources:"

        "title": "John Mooney (basketball)",
        "text": "John Patrick Mooney (born March 20, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for Chiba Jets Funabashi of the Japanese B.League. He played college basketball for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.\nEarly life and high school career.\nMooney is the son of Margaret and Kevin Mooney, a builder/contractor for an appliance company who played Division II golf at Spring Hill College. He has two older siblings, Brendan and Caitlin. Mooney began playing for Nike Team Florida in AAU play alongside Florida coach Billy Donovan's son Bryan in eighth grade. Mooney attended Lake Brantley High School. As a senior, he averaged 24.8 points, 14 rebounds and five blocks per game and was named to the first-team all-state.\nHe initially committed to play under Donovan at Florida but reopened his recruitment after Donovan took the coaching job of the Oklahoma City Thunder. After fielding offers from Indiana, Kansas, Georgia Tech, Georgia, Wake Forest, Alabama, Florida State, Vanderbilt, and Stanford, Mooney's father asked Donovan his opinion on Notre Dame. Donovan telephoned Notre Dame coach Mike Brey and informed him about Mooney, and Brey sent his brother to scout the prospect. Mooney committed to the Fighting Irish after taking his official visit.\nCollege career.\nAs a freshman, Mooney served as a backup to Bonzie Colson. Mooney averaged 5.6 points, 3.9 rebounds and 0.5 assists per game in his sophomore season. As a junior, Mooney was named to the Third Team All-ACC and finished second to Jordan Nwora as the league most improved player. He averaged 14.1 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, though the Fighting Irish finished 14–19 and were last in the ACC. Mooney registered 15 double-doubles in ACC play, including eight straight from January 2 to February 5, 2019. \nComing into his senior season, Mooney was named to the Preseason All-ACC team and received three votes for Preseason Player of the Year. After scoring 28 points and grabbing 16 rebounds in a win against Howard, Mooney was named ACC player of the week on November 18, 2019. On January 4, 2020, Mooney tied his career-high with 28 points and had 14 rebounds in an 88–87 win versus Syracuse. As a result, Mooney earned his second ACC player of the week honors on January 6. He had his 12th consecutive double-double with 21 points and 13 rebounds in a loss to Syracuse on January 22, breaking Luke Harangody's school record of consecutive double-doubles. At the conclusion of the regular season, Mooney was selected to the First Team All-ACC. He averaged 16.2 points and 12.7 rebounds per game as a senior.\nProfessional career.\nPerth Wildcats (2020–2021).\nOn August 14, 2020, Mooney signed a one-year deal with the Perth Wildcats of the Australian National Basketball League (NBL). In the Wildcats' season opener on January 24, 2021, he recorded 13 points and 14 rebounds in an 88–76 win over the South East Melbourne Phoenix. He set a record for rebounds by a Wildcat playing in his first NBL game. For the season, he averaged a double-double, becoming the first Wildcat to do that since 2007, and finished the season with 27 double-doubles in 42 games – the second most in a season by a Wildcat. His 11.4 rebounds per game is the eighth highest in club history and his total of 480 rebounds is the third-most in a single season in NBL history. He helped the Wildcats reach the 2021 NBL Grand Final series, where they lost 3–0 to Melbourne United. He was subsequently named the Wildcats Club MVP.\nChiba Jets (2021–present).\nOn July 15, 2021, Mooney signed with Chiba Jets Funabashi of the Japanese B.League. He re-signed with Chiba on May 27, 2022, and again on June 12, 2023."

        "title": "The Baseball Encyclopedia",
        "text": "The Baseball Encyclopedia is a baseball reference book first published by Macmillan in 1969. Nine further editions of the book were released between 1974 and 1996. \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" features statistical summaries for Major League Baseball (MLB) players.\nBackground.\nBaseball reference books that predate \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" include the \"Baseball Cyclopedia\", which was first released in 1922, and \"The Official Encyclopedia of Baseball\", which was published during the 1950s and 1960s. These books included rudimentary player statistics, but major gaps existed in their coverage. Games played were tallied for all players, while batting average was provided for hitters and pitchers' win–loss records were listed. Other statistical categories were not provided by these books. Official baseball records and various publications had numerous errors and inconsistencies, which were most apparent with pre-1920 data. One publication by \"The Sporting News\" listed two different 1899 National League batting average leaders within a 16-page span. Statistician David Neft, who had recently been hired by computer data processing company Information Concepts, Inc. (ICI), first proposed a new baseball encyclopedia in 1965. Two years later, he pitched the idea to Bob Markel, Macmillan's executive editor. Markel, a baseball fan, liked the concept and eventually Macmillan bought rights to \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\", despite concerns by company president Jeremiah Kaplan about the proposed $25 price of the book. Neft assumed the role of editor-in-chief.\nFirst edition.\nResearch and development.\nIn 1965, Neft sought out research assistance by putting help wanted ads in \"The Sporting News\", which yielded four assistants. It was eventually determined that, to provide the greatest amount of accuracy possible, daily statistics for all players would have to be recreated. Biographical details for approximately 5,000 players had already been compiled by Lee Allen, a historian at the Baseball Hall of Fame, and his research provided an early foundation. Another boon to research efforts for the book came from ICI's acquisition of scrapbooks owned by steamship executive John Tattersall. His records included a full collection of box scores dating back to 1876, and a mostly complete daily statistics log that covered the period between 1876 and 1890. The data, however, was not sufficient to calculate stats that had not been tracked contemporaneously, such as earned run average, runs batted in, and saves. To permit these categories to be deduced for each season, Neft's research team consulted newspaper accounts of old games, focusing on the 1876–1919 period. The research team ultimately expanded to 21 people, who went to libraries throughout the U.S. to obtain the needed information. This process took two years to complete.\n\"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" was an early example of computer software being used in the book publication process. Author Alan Schwarz credits it as the first book with computer typesetting (excluding phone books). Every player's data were individually compiled on sheets of paper, with the information coded into punch cards by a firm in Israel. Once the cards came back from overseas, ICI placed them in magnetic tape and data was sorted by an IBM 360 computer. The system allowed for teams' season statistics to be totaled, combined, and compared with the numbers kept by the leagues; inconsistencies were flagged by the computer and logged by Neft for investigation.\nAmong the issues resolved was the existence of a small number of phantom ballplayers who had been recorded in box scores as appearing in a game despite not existing. One example was a Cleveland Blues player named Woodruff, who was credited with playing as a right fielder in a 1901 game. The player was actually Bob Wood, who was normally a catcher but made infrequent appearances as an outfielder; a telegraph operator incorrectly interpreted Morse code that read \"Wood rf\", leading to an error in the box score. An ad in \"The Sporting News\" claimed that \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" took three-and-a-half years to research and develop, and that it cost $1.5 million to produce. Neft remarked that the book \"took seven hours to print ... but a year and a half to tell the computer what to do.\"\nAdjustments to historical stats.\nBefore the book's release, a five-person Special Baseball Records Committee was formed by MLB. This group had multiple meetings and discussed proposed corrections to players' stats, in addition to deciding how old rules would be interpreted. One issue the committee dealt with was the treatment of walks in the 1876 and 1887 seasons. In the former year they had been officially recorded as outs, and they had been ruled as base hits in 1887. The group opted against the original interpretations, electing to use modern rules, under which walks did not count as hits or outs.\nCap Anson was one player whose statistical record was affected by this change. Having previously been listed with nearly 3,500 lifetime hits, he lost 60 hits from walks during the 1887 season and 423 pre-1876 hits, which were not counted by \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\". These changes left Anson five hits short of the 3,000 hit club, according to the book. Ty Cobb, who held MLB's career record for base hits at the time, had his total adjusted upward from 4,191 hits to 4,192. Among pitchers whose records were changed, Christy Mathewson, who had been tied for the most career wins by an NL pitcher, had a reduction of six wins; Walter Johnson also had his win total lowered.\nAttracting more attention than those changes was a rule interpretation that would have altered a well-known record: Babe Ruth's total of 714 career home runs. In a 1918 game, Ruth had a game-ending hit which would have been scored as a home run under modern rules, as the ball went over the outfield wall. Because there was a runner on base who had advanced three bases, Ruth was given a triple. Thirty-seven hits that would have counted as home runs under modern scoring guidelines, including Ruth's, were discovered by the researchers for \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\". The record committee initially voted to credit the batters with home runs, which would have increased Ruth's career tally to 715.\nThe decision brought a negative fan reaction and controversy in the press. Journalist Robert Lipsyte cited the change as an example of \"historical revisionism\" and nicknamed the researchers the \"Revisionist Police\". Another critic was MLB public relations director Joe Reichler, a member of the committee who had been absent from the meeting where the home run ruling was voted upon. Reichler said that changing historical regulations was not meant to be within the committee's remit. He successfully pushed for a second vote on the topic and persuaded two other committee members to oppose the measure. By a 3–2 vote, the change was overturned, leaving Ruth with 714 home runs.\nContents.\nClose to 75% of the first edition was devoted to statistical records of MLB players. Over 10,000 players had their stats included in \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\", with coverage dating to 1876. Pitchers had 19 different categories of statistics, while batters had 17. Seven of the pitchers' categories specifically covered relievers, and position players received a summary of games played by defensive position. National Association of Professional Base Ball Players participants also had stat registers, as did MLB managers.\nOther portions of \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" included a section on baseball history and a listing of stat category leaders, which had single-season and career figures. Summaries and line scores were provided for all World Series contests and MLB All-Star Games. Another section, titled \"The Teams and Their Players\", had seasonal team rosters and stats, along with league standings and stat category leaders, for each year starting in 1876. Overall, the contents of \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" first edition totaled 2,337 pages; the book had a weight of six-and-a-half pounds.\nRelease and reception.\nThe first edition of \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" was released on September 10, 1969. Even at the $25 price point, it gained an audience, with sales of over 100,000 copies. The book attracted a mostly positive reception from reviewers as well. \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" received three separate reviews in \"The New York Times\", by Jimmy Breslin, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, and Leonard Koppett. Lehmann-Haupt described \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" as \"Big for a book, small for an amusement park.\" The large size of the book was a subject of discussion, as it was nicknamed \"Big Mac\". Breslin offered praise for the attention the book paid to lesser-known players. More critical reviews focused on the changes made to the stats of historical players. In \"Sports Illustrated\", sportswriter Robert Creamer called the adjustment of Mathewson's win total \"illogical, historically invalid, and personally upsetting to Christy Mathewson fans.\" However, historian John Thorn later called the first edition of \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" the best version.\nSubsequent editions.\nFive years later, in 1974, the second edition of \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" was published. This release included statistics that had been updated through the 1973 season. However, it was reduced in size by more than 800 pages. This was accomplished by excluding statistical summaries for all retired batters with fewer than 25 at bats, and all retired pitchers with under 25 innings pitched and no wins or losses. A new editor was required as Neft had stopped working for ICI. Reichler was hired by Macmillan for the position; Schwarz saw him as wanting to \"please his bosses at MLB\", who were dissatisfied with the changes to player statistics that had been incorporated into the first edition.\nFor the 1974 version, Reichler reversed many of the previous changes. Schwarz noted a pattern in which adjustments that would result in additions to the stats of big-name players were made, but not those that required subtractions. This process continued in later editions, making the book less accurate. \"Sports Illustrated\" Jonathan Yardley criticized the second edition for its size reduction, suggesting that updated player stats should have been released in a supplement to the original book.\nStarting in 1976, new editions of the \"Baseball Encyclopedia\" were released every three years for the next several versions. By 1982, when the fifth edition came out, sales had surpassed 250,000. Jeff Neumann, one of the book's editors, later said that editions consistently sold 50,000 copies while he was involved with \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" production, and that it was \"a very profitable enterprise\" for Macmillan. Aiding the publisher was an agreement it had made with the researchers before the original book was released, which allowed Macmillan to avoid making any royalty payments. Eventually, ICI went under and Macmillan gained full ownership of \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\".\nAfter the release of the 1988 edition of \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\", Reichler died and was succeeded by Rick Wolff. In 1990, the eighth edition came out. Along with updates that brought the number of MLB players covered to more than 13,000, six fielding statistics were newly added to players' summaries, which necessitated the use of larger pages. A directory with information for over 130 Negro league players active from 1920 to 1950 was also included, as was information on teams' home and away records and streaks. For this version, Wolff elected to rely heavily on the database from the first edition, rejecting adjustments made under Reichler that were not backed by firm proof. Numerous changes were made to historical statistics; among them was reducing Honus Wagner's career hit total by 12, which was enough to cost him two percentage points from his career batting average and drop him one place on the all-time hit list. Media members were strongly critical of the edits. Jerome Holtzman of the \"Chicago Tribune\" said they were \"tampering with baseball's most sacred text.\" Schwarz later disagreed with Holtzman's viewpoint, saying that Reichler had been responsible for adjustments before the press had paid attention. Regardless, the changes were noticed by MLB, which decided to no longer officially endorse \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\".\nThree years later, the non-endorsed ninth edition was published. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was given a section in the book, a first for \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\". With the advent of the Internet, the need for baseball reference books diminished. The final version of \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\", the 10th, came out in 1996. Jeanine Bucek was the lead editor of that edition. IDG Books purchased the book's rights from Simon &amp; Schuster, which had bought Macmillan. Wiley &amp; Sons later obtained the rights from IDG, but no new editions were produced.\nLegacy.\n\"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" was an influential publication in the field of baseball statistics. Shortly after the release of the first edition, the Society for American Baseball Research was founded. The research done for the books was reflected in future compilations of stats. The first edition of \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" served as a template which fellow encyclopedia \"Total Baseball\" was based upon. Various editions of that book were published between 1989 and 2004. Thorn has stated that he considers the websites Baseball-Reference.com and Retrosheet \"descendants of \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\"\". Sean Forman, the founder of Baseball-Reference.com, called it as an inspiration for the site's development, saying that the objective was \"making the pages connectable.\" Neft cited the encyclopedia as having an effect in publicizing the statistical achievements of players like Addie Joss and Sam Thompson to Hall of Fame voters. In 2002, \"Sports Illustrated\" selected \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" as one of the 100 greatest sports books."

While Brown, Harvard, Princeton , and Yale were able to secure ice time at St. Nicholas Rink, one of the only consistently available rinks at the time, Cornell found themselves frozen out most of the time.\nAs a result, Cornell would play only a single game in 1902.\nNote: Cornell University did not formally adopt 'Big Red' as its moniker until after 1905.

        "text": "In baseball, a home run is credited to a batter when he hits a fair ball and reaches home safely on the same play, without the benefit of an error. Sixty-one different players have hit two home runs in an inning of a Major League Baseball (MLB) game to date, the most recent being Trea Turner of the Philadelphia Phillies on August 19, 2023. Regarded as a notable achievement, five players have accomplished the feat more than once in their career; no player has ever hit more than two home runs in an inning. Charley Jones was the first player to hit two home runs in one inning, doing so for the Boston Red Stockings against the Buffalo Bisons on June 10, 1880.\nThese innings have resulted in other single-inning and single-game MLB records being set due to the prodigious offensive performance. Bobby Lowe and Mike Cameron finished their respective games with a total of four home runs, equaling the record for most home runs in one game. Both of the home runs hit by Fernando Tatís in the third inning for the St. Louis Cardinals on April 23, 1999, were grand slams. Not only did he tie the record for most grand slams in one game, Tatís became the only player to hit two grand slams in the same inning and established a new major league record with eight runs batted in (RBI) in a single inning. A decade later, Alex Rodriguez set the single-inning American League record for RBIs with seven when he hit a three-run home run and a grand slam in the sixth inning for the New York Yankees on October 4, 2009.\nBret Boone and Cameron are the only players to each hit two home runs in one inning on the same day (May 2, 2002), in the same game, in the same inning (the first), in a pair of back-to-back at bats, and as teammates (playing for the Seattle Mariners). Carlos Baerga, Mark Bellhorn, and Kendrys Morales hit their home runs from both sides of the plate. Jeff King is the sole player to accomplish the feat in consecutive seasons. Bill Regan has the fewest career home runs among players who have two home runs in one inning with 18, while Alex Rodriguez, with 696, hit more home runs than any other player in this group and amassed the fifth most in major league history. Willie McCovey, Mark McGwire, David Ortiz, Rodriguez, Gary Sheffield, and Sammy Sosa are also members of the 500 home run club.\nOf the 45 players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have hit two home runs in an inning, eight have been elected, four on the first ballot. Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 MLB seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months. These requirements leave three players ineligible who are active, three players ineligible who are living and have played in the past five seasons, and six players ineligible who did not play in 10 seasons.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "title": "International Ice Hockey Association",
        "text": "The International Ice Hockey Association was a governing body for international ice hockey. It was established in 1940 when the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association wanted more control over international hockey, and was in disagreement with the definition of amateur used by the International Olympic Committee. The Amateur Hockey Association of the United States co-founded the association, with the British Ice Hockey Association joining later. The association oversaw the relationships between the National Hockey League, and leagues within the national amateur associations. W. G. Hardy served as its president, and planned for an amateur hockey World Series after World War II. The association was merged into the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace in 1947.\nBackground.\nIn the wake of Canada not winning the gold medal in ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) pushed for an updated definition of amateur that met the realities of present-day sport in Canada, and would permit Canada to use its best non-professional players at international competitions. The revisions were led by W. G. Hardy and George Dudley on behalf of the CAHA, and were opposed by the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada (AAU of C) and its president W. A. Fry. The CAHA requested four changes to the amateur code of the AAU of C, which included; that players who tried out unsuccessfully for a professional team should be reinstated as amateurs; that professional and amateur hockey teams should be allowed to play exhibition games against each other; that players should be allowed to seek legitimate employment in hockey; and that players should be reimbursed by their employers for time lost from work while competing on behalf of their clubs. The AAU of C rejected three of the four proposals, which led to the CAHA separating from its parent organization.\nInternational hockey in the United States in 1937 was governed by the Amateur Athletic Union. After the CAHA split ways from the AAU of C, the American union terminated its working agreement with the CAHA in March 1937, that had allowed for the transferring of players and exhibition games between the two countries. In August 1937, the AAU issued an ultimatum to the Eastern Amateur Hockey League (EAHL), not to have any Canadian-born players in its league. EAHL president and hockey promoter Tommy Lockhart then entered into negotiations with the CAHA, and reached an agreement to transfer a limited number of Canadian players to the league. The EAHL then broke away from the AAU as its governing body. Lockhart recognized the need for a national governing body to efficiently manage hockey within the United States, and founded the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) later in 1937.\nIn September 1938, the CAHA and AHAUS reached a working agreement which regulated international games in North America, set out provisions for transfer of players between the organizations, and recognized of each other's authority. Since both the CAHA and the Amateur Athletic Union were members of Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG), the American union protested the CAHA affiliation with AHAUS. The CAHA felt that AHAUS was the most comprehensive ice hockey governing body in the United States, and stayed with the 1938 agreement. The decision would potentially lose Canada its membership in the LIHG, and the ability to compete at the Ice Hockey World Championships or ice hockey at the Olympic Games. The LIHG ruled in favour of the protest, but the CAHA continued its association with AHAUS. LIHG president Paul Loicq subsequently chose to allow for the continued negotiations. By then, the AAU of C decided to adopt the definition of amateur as laid out by the respective world governing body of each sport as recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and looked to bring the CAHA back under its jurisdiction. The CAHA updated its constitution to define an amateur player as one who, \"either has not engaged or is not engaged in organized professional hockey\", and ultimately declined to rejoin the AAU of C.\nFoundation of the association.\nOn April 15, 1940, the CAHA and AHAUS agreed to form a new governing body known tentatively as the International Ice Hockey League, and invited the British Ice Hockey Association (BIHA) to join. Hardy who was also the CAHA president, stated that \"the purpose of the new association is to promote the game of hockey among the three Anglo-Saxon nations\". He was named president of the new body, and Lockhart was named first vice-president. The BIHA was asked to nominate the second vice-president position.\nHardy explained the International Ice Hockey Association as a means of shifting the control of world hockey from Belgium to Canada, \"where it rightfully belonged\". He also noted the inactivity of the LIHG resulting from World War II. He sought for acceptance by the IOC on terms acceptable to the CAHA. A constitution for the new association was delegated to a committee including future CAHA presidents Hanson Dowell and W. B. George. The constitution stated that the associations president must be an executive officer or a past-president of the CAHA. The CAHA gave C$500 to the association, and an honorarium to Hardy for expenses.\nProfessional–amateur relations.\nAmateur and junior ice hockey teams in Canada were upset about losing players to professional leagues without compensation, and Hardy set about to negotiate reimbursement of the Canadian teams when a player became professional. The CAHA had introduced player contracts for the 1940–41 season, with the goal to keep junior-aged and amateur players under service in Canada instead of leaving for professional leagues.\nIn September 1940, Hardy announced a one-year agreement was reached with the National Hockey League (NHL) to reimburse the amateur associations, which included $250 for signing an amateur and another $250 if the amateur played in the NHL. The new professional-amateur agreement was signed by Frank Calder on behalf of the NHL in October 1940, and also applied to leagues in the BIHA and the Eastern Amateur Hockey League in the United States. The distribution of the development funds from the NHL was based on the service time the amateur had with each respective club. The agreement included allowing the NHL to sign a limited number of junior age players.\nHardy decided on disputes of players becoming professionals, and reinstatements as amateurs. He committed to decide on all application within 15 days to expedite transfers and reinstatements due to wartime enlistments and travel restrictions. He stated, \"we believe that the movement between professional and amateur ranks should be made as easy as possible\", which included former professionals being welcomed back in amateur.\nBy 1942, the agreement had brought in $17,241 in development fees to junior teams. Demand for junior-aged players during the 1941–42 NHL season was higher due to war-time travel restrictions on older players. Calder reported there was a general agreement with the amateur leagues that a junior-aged player should be able to determine his own financial future due to the war.\nIn 1943, Hardy recommended adjustments in amateur payments for players becoming professional, since many later enlisted shortly after signing a contract. He felt that under normal circumstances, junior-aged players should not be signed to professional contracts. He negotiated wartime measures with the NHL, without opposition being raised by presidents of the provincial associations. The Pacific Coast Hockey League began in 1944, and competed for junior-aged players. Hardy ruled that since the league operated under affiliation with AHAUS, the existing international transfer rules and professional–amateur agreement would apply to the new league.\nIn April 1945, Hardy was re-elected president, and Lockhart was re-elected first vice-president. Frank Sargent was elected the second vice-president, and Dudley was elected the secretary. By 1946, the professional–amateur agreement provided more than $45,000 in development fees. The association and the NHL agreed to enforce suspensions for players not fulfilling a tryout contract. Hardy then declined transfers to those under such a contract.\nIn May 1946, the NHL proposed a flat payment of $20,000 to cover all players being signed to professional contracts, whereas the CAHA requested $2000 for any player remaining in the NHL for more than a year. Hardy felt the CAHA was at a disadvantage to press too hard, and wanted to maintain good relations with the NHL and AHAUS. The flat rate offer was later accepted with the stipulation that a junior-aged player could sign a contract at age 16, but not play professional until age 18.\nLockhart threatened to resign as vice-president and withdraw AHAUS from the association in January 1947, after the CAHA requested a $100 fee for international transfers. He refused the fee, stating the CAHA had no authority to make that request. Several players had left Canada without proper documentation, but Hardy ultimately allowed the players to remain in the United States.\nWorld hockey relations.\nAt the 1944 CAHA general meeting in Montreal, a motion was passed to sever relations with the LIHG. Another a motion of confidence was passed in the International Ice Hockey Association, and closer relationships between the CAHA, AHAUS and the BIHA.\nIn April 1945, Hardy envisioned an amateur hockey World Series after World War II, involving teams from Canada, the United States, England and Scotland. The proposed series would be an annual event between the North American and European champion to begin in 1947 or 1948.\nHardy expected hockey to grow after the war, and said proper rules had been established to limited transfers and prevent raiding of Canadian rosters. He expected a large number of Canadian soldiers stationed in Europe to remain there playing hockey. Post-war plans were discussed on how to co-ordinate classification of clubs for international competition. In May 1946, the Swedish Ice Hockey Association and French Ice Hockey Federation expressed interest in joining the association.\nMerger with the LIHG.\nThe association met in August 1946 in New York City, along with guests from the Scottish Ice Hockey Association, French and Swedish associations. At the meeting, it was agreed to propose a merger with the LIHG to oversee international ice hockey. A proposal would also be submitted for the Ice Hockey World Championships to alternate between Europe and North America, with the Olympic hockey tournaments played under the same rules as the CAHA and the NHL. Hardy's resolution from 1941 stated the merger was acceptable if the CAHA definition of amateur was approved, the membership and voting system was acceptable to the CAHA, and that AHAUS be admitted as a member to the merged organization. The CAHA sought to have Hardy nominated as vice-president of the new governing body, and Dudley as its secretary.\nThe CAHA attended the LIHG meeting during the 1947 Ice Hockey World Championships in Prague, and pushed for the definition of amateur to be anyone not actively engaged in professional sport. Incoming CAHA president Al Pickard stated that the CAHA and AHAUS would operate with complete autonomy under the structure of the agreement to join the LIHG. The LIHG agreed to a merger where the presidency would alternate between North America and Europe every three years, and recognized AHAUS as the governing body of hockey in the United States. A decision on increased voting power for the CAHA was deferred, and the CAHA was permitted to have its own definition of amateur as long as teams at the Olympic games adhered to existing LIHG rules. Hardy agreed to the merger and accepted the vice-presidency of the LIHG. The Association was dissolved on July 1, 1947. The LIHG was renamed the International Ice Hockey Federation in 1948, and Hardy served as its president from 1948 to 1951."

        "title": "Solent (sailing rig)",
        "text": "A solent refers to a sail and rigging system on sailboats, typically sloops. Sailors, particularly British sailors, often refer to a 100% jib as a Solent, because its smaller size is preferable when sailing in the strong winds found in the Solent between the Isle of Wight and Britain. The common use of roller-furling headsails, or genoas, on modern cruising yachts allows the jib to be reduced in size, but partially-furled sails lack the efficiency of a sail that is actually cut to a smaller size. Accordingly, it is preferable to fly a separate, smaller jib—the solent—instead.\nOn a sloop, there is a single forestay that runs from the top of the mast forward to the prow, and in addition to bracing the mast it provides a firm support to which a jib can be attached. When this forestay is covered with a roller-furling jib, which cannot be quickly removed, it becomes impossible to attach a different sail to the same stay. For this reason, some boats are fitted with a \"solent stay\". A solent stay is a moveable stay that is fixed to the top of the mast just below the forestay. When needed to hold the solent sail, the stay is attached to a point just behind the forestay, where it is tensioned with a tackle or a Highfield lever. When not in use, it must be moved out of the way to allow the genoa to be deployed and tacked from side to side. It may be detached and secured just in front of the mast, or led to one side and fastened next to the shrouds.\nA solent rig is different from a cutter rig, although a solent may serve the same purpose as the staysail on a cutter. A solent stay serves essentially as an alternative forestay when a roller-fuller prevents raising a different sail on the same line. On a cutter, the staysail stay is parallel to the forestay, but a significant distance behind and below it, allowing sails to be flown from both the forestay and the staysail stay at the same time. Since a staysail on a cutter does not run all the way to the mast-top, it may cause bend in the mast unless the pull is balanced by a running backstay.\nA solent stay has additional uses. In strong winds roller-furling jibs do not perform well and may tend to unroll. Besides setting a solent sail as a 100% jib, it is possible to reef such a jib, or to set a storm sail on the solent stay."

Most national champion jerseys tend to represent a country's flag or use the colours from it.

Its \"League of Legends\" team is partnered with PSG Esports and known as PSG Talon. PSG Talon competes in the Pacific Championship Series.\n\"League of Legends\".\nHistory.\nRiot Games announced on 19 December 2019 that Talon Esports would be one of ten teams participating in the newly created Pacific Championship Series. Talon Esports' inaugural roster consisted of top laner Su \"Hanabi\" Chia-hsiang, jungler Kim \"River\" Dong-woo, mid laner Kim \"Candy\" Seung-ju, bot laner Wong \"Unified\" Chun-kit, and support Ling \"Kaiwing\" Kai-wing.\nTalon Esports finished third in the 2020 PCS Spring regular season, qualifying for the first round of playoffs in the winners' bracket. After winning three series and losing one, Talon Esports reached the finals where they faced off against Machi Esports. Talon Esports came out on top after a close series and won their first PCS title.\nOn 18 June 2020, Talon Esports announced that its \"League of Legends\" team had partnered with PSG Esports and would henceforth compete as PSG Talon. Mid laner Park \"Tank\" Dan-won was brought in as a substitute for the summer split, but was later promoted to the starting position after the departure of Candy on 9 July 2020.\nIn a repeat of the spring split, PSG Talon finished third in the 2020 PCS Summer regular season and reached the finals after defeating the same teams in spring. This qualified the team for the 2020 World Championship. PSG Talon later faced Machi Esports once again in a rematch of the spring finals; however, this time Machi Esports defeated PSG Talon, forcing PSG Talon to start in the play-in stage of Worlds as the PCS' second seed.\nRiver and Tank were unable to participate in the play-in stage due to delayed visas, and were replaced with Hsiao \"Kongyue\" Jen-tso and Chen \"Uniboy\" Chang-chu respectively. Unified was also unable to participate in the first half of the play-in stage for the same reason, and was replaced with Chen \"Dee\" Chun-dee.\nDespite starting the play-in stage with three emergency substitutes, PSG Talon won both their games on the first day of competition, including an upset victory over group favourites LGD Gaming. PSG Talon later topped their group and qualified for the tournament's main event. PSG Talon was placed in Group B for the main event, along with South Korea's DAMWON Gaming, China's JD Gaming, and Europe's Rogue. PSG Talon finished third in their group with a 2–4 win-loss record, ending their Worlds run.\nPSG Talon announced the departure of Tank on 31 October 2021 and the signing of Huang \"Maple\" Yi-tang as his replacement on \n10 December.\nPSG Talon finished first in the 2021 PCS Spring regular season, losing only a single game to second-place Beyond Gaming. The team later reached their third consecutive PCS finals and swept Beyond Gaming to win their second PCS title.\nUnified was unable to participate in the 2021 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI 2021) due to recurring cases of pneumothorax. He was replaced with Beyond Gaming's Chiu \"Doggo\" Tzu-chuan.\nFor the group stage of MSI 2021, PSG Talon was placed in Group B, along with Europe's MAD Lions, Brazil's paiN Gaming, and Turkey's Istanbul Wildcats. PSG Talon finished second in their group with a 4–2 win–loss record, only losing to first-place MAD Lions, and qualified for the \"rumble\" stage of the tournament. PSG Talon finished third out of six teams in the rumble stage, advancing to the knockout stage. In the semifinals, China's Royal Never Give Up eliminated PSG Talon from the tournament after a four-game series.\nPSG Talon placed first in the 2021 PCS Summer regular season, finishing undefeated. After sweeping J Team in the semifinals, PSG Talon qualified for the 2021 World Championship and their fourth consecutive PCS finals, where they defeated Beyond Gaming after another close series.\nPSG Talon's first-place finish in the 2021 summer split qualified them for the main event of the 2021 World Championship.

        "text": "Foundation.\nIn 1892, while participating in a tennis tournament at Niagara Falls, Ontario, Malcolm Greene Chace was introduced to the Canadian pastime of ice hockey. While he was attending Yale University, Chace put together a team of fellow collegians from his alma mater as well as Brown, Columbia and Harvard that embarked on a 10-game tour in Canadian cities around southern Quebec and Ontario during the winter of 1894–95. The following year, Chace was able to put together a team of Yale students and organize four games for them to play during the spring semester. The second and third games played by Yale were played against Johns Hopkins University and are credited with being the first two intercollegiate ice hockey games played by American universities.\nCollege ice hockey in the United States predates the existence of any formal governing body but when the precursor to the NCAA was created in 1906 ice hockey was far too regional and new for it to receive much attention. For most of the first half of the 20th century the colleges themselves were allowed to set the terms for which teams they could participate against and who would be declared champion at the end of the season. Prior to the conclusion of World War I virtually all ice hockey programs were located at universities in the Northeastern United States making the task of determining the champion fairly easy.\n \nTrials and Changes.\nWhen the United States entered World War I in April 1917, many college students joined the United States Armed Forces. As a result many colleges suspended some or all of their athletic programs for the duration of the war. A few ice hockey programs continued to operate for the 1917–18 season but those were perishingly few. Because the war was over by November 1918, many prospective students were able to attend college for the spring semester in 1919. This meant that the ice hockey programs who were suspended could be restarted quickly. College Ice hockey returned for its first full season with the 1919–20 campaign and, with the number of teams in the midwest who had stated programs over the previous few seasons, teams were now vying for Eastern and Western collegiate championships. Even with that addition, the biggest change was yet to come.\nIn 1920, following the example of most other leagues on the continent, college hockey shifted from 7-on-7 to 6-on-6. Furthermore, the game times were altered from two halves to three periods. These changes allowed for a faster game not only because there were fewer players on the ice, but because many of the rinks that were built in the 1920s were significantly larger than the ones that had been used previously. It also meant that players would have more time to recover from strenuous play (two formal breaks rather than one) and help to increase the amount of substitutions that would occur throughout the games (though it was still common for some athletes to play the entire game).\nThe college game continued to expand and was aided not only by the addition of regional rinks like the Philadelphia Arena and the New Haven Arena, but also by some universities building their own venues. The first of these was the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink by Princeton, which was followed soon after by Dartmouth's Davis Rink and Army's Smith Rink. More and more programs appeared and were able to use the increasing amount of available ice throughout the 1920s, but after the stock market crash in 1929 the colleges would face tough decisions moving forward.\n \nGreat Depression.\nAt the beginning of the great depression, most college's continued to fund the ice hockey programs. However, as the economic disaster took hold, several school were no longer able to support the expensive sport. Most of the established programs continued, but some, like Boston College and Rensselaer were forced to suspend for several seasons. Other programs like Marquette and Gonzaga have never recovered.\nDespite financial difficulties, however, the colleges and communities that supported programs during the 1930s became enthralled by the game and led to an increasing number of games played by schools. In addition, there was enough money in some budgets to permit travel beyond the immediate area and games between East, West and even Pacific teams became more common.\nBecause the NCAA did not sponsor a tournament or recognize ice hockey as a national sport, several different organizations conferred 'National Championship' status on colleges during this time. While there were no official National Champions during the 1930s, several schools claim titles during this era. By the mid-30s, most of the Midwest teams had suspended, leaving only Michigan, Michigan Tech and Minnesota by 1936. Illinois joined soon afterwards but Midwest hockey wouldn't recover until after World War II.\nWorld War II and aftermath.\nUnlike when the US had entered World War I, most colleges attempted to play through the beginning of war. Most schools continued until the end of the 1943 season when a decline in enrolment and the necessities of the war forced many programs to pause. Some, like Dartmouth and Clarkson, soldiered on but with a severe reduction in the number of schools participating, none could legitimately claim a championship during this time.\nAfter the war's end in 1945, most programs quickly restarted, though there were some conspicuous absences. Most of the Pacific teams did not return; only California resumed play but the program was shuttered in 1949. Illinois also did not return and neither did any of the Pittsburgh- or Cleveland-area colleges that had attempted to form a league at the end of the 30s. However, by 1947 enough colleges were playing varsity hockey for the NCAA to finally take notice and a National Ice Hockey Tournament was instituted for the first time. That made the 1947–48 season the first official NCAA campaign. When the tournament was instituted, the schools that were fielding teams were located primarily in the northeast and upper Midwest, the two regions that have dominated American ice hockey ever since.\n "

Some upper-echelon schools formed an intercollegiate hockey league around the turn of the century and began playing one another on a consistent basis. Due to this informal schedule the schools were able to declare a champion between the members and have that team serve as the de facto collegiate champion. Several of the smaller schools, like Williams College or Union College were not considered for the championship for a few reasons, chief among which was that their level of competition usually did not raise to the standards of Harvard or Yale.\nAfter World War I ice hockey teams began sprouting up across New England and the rust belt making the naming of an individual champion more difficult. As a result the regions (East and West) would usually have their own intercollegiate champion."

        "title": "Erik Martin (basketball)",
        "text": "Erik Martin (born May 26, 1971) is an American basketball coach and former professional player, currently serving as head coach for South Carolina State. A native of California, Martin played one season of college basketball at TCU before transferring to Santa Ana College, a junior college in California where he was a first-team All-State selection. In 1991 he joined the University of Cincinnati, and with the Bearcats he reached the Final Four during the 1992 NCAA tournament. After going undrafted in the 1993 NBA draft he played for various CBA teams and abroad in South Korea and Taiwan. He also earned two selections in the United States national team: he won the silver medal at the 1995 Pan American Games and the gold medal during the 1997 Tournament of the Americas. After retiring as a player he has held several assistant coach jobs, mainly for Bob Huggins, first at Kansas State and later at West Virginia.\nHigh school career.\nMartin is a native of West Covina, California, and he attended Whittier Christian High School in nearby La Habra, where he played as a center and power forward. A starter since his sophomore year, in his junior season Martin averaged 21.9 points and 14.1 rebounds per game, earning the Most Valuable Player award in the 1-A league and was selected in the All-Southern and All-State First Teams. Martin was again selected as first-team all-state for his senior year, during which he averaged 24.1 points per game. During his time at Whittier Christian, Martin was an honor student.\nCollege career.\nMartin signed to play for TCU in February 1988, having already signed a letter of intent in the previous months. Under head coach Moe Iba, Martin redshirted his true freshman season in 1988–89 and received limited playing time in the 1989–90 season as a 6-foot-5, 198-pound freshman; at the end of the season he had appeared in all 29 games played by the team, starting 7 of them, and he had posted averages of 6.9 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 15.2 minutes per game; he was the 4th best rebounder and the 6th best scorer on his team.\nIn April 1990 Martin announced that he was leaving TCU and transferring to another school; he chose Santa Ana College (which at the time was called Rancho Santiago Junior College). While at Rancho Santiago, Martin averaged 22.5 points (832 total) and 9.4 rebounds per game over 37 games (he averaged 25 points per game over 12 games of conference play), and established a program record for highest field goal percentage in a season with 63.7%. At the end of the season Rancho Santiago won the state championship, and Martin was selected in the All-State first team. In 2006 Martin was inducted in the Santa Ana College Hall of Fame.\nIn 1991 Martin and junior college teammate Corie Blount decided to transfer to Cincinnati. Martin and Blount were recruited by assistant coach Steve Moeller, who had brought to the Bearcats other junior college players: Nick Van Exel, Terry Nelson and Herb Jones (who had transferred to Cincinnati in 1990). Martin chose jersey number 3 and in his first year with his new team he played in all 34 games of the season, being employed off the bench by coach Bob Huggins: he averaged 6.3 points and 4 rebounds while playing 16.4 minutes per game, and he was the 5th best scorer on the team, the 3rd best rebounder (behind Jones and Blount), and the 3rd best shotblocker (0.5 per game). The Bearcats experienced a successful season and won the Great Midwest Conference tournament, gaining access to the NCAA tournament: Martin played all 5 games of the tournament, averaging 7.4 points and 5.8 rebounds, and during the Final Four he recorded a double-double of 10 points and 10 rebounds against Michigan in a tournament-high 30 minutes of play.\nMartin stayed at Cincinnati also for his senior season in 1992–93. On December 11, 1992, in a game against Southeast Missouri State, Martin shot 10-for-11 from the field (90.9%), recording the 2nd-best shooting performance in Cincinnati history at the time. On January 27, 1993 Martin recorded a career-high 6 steals against Xavier. Martin ended the season averaging 13.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 27.1 minutes per game, having started all 31 games. He ranked 2nd on the team in scoring behind Van Exel, and was the team leader in rebounds and blocks per game; that year he also led the conference in field goal percentage with 60.3%. Cincinnati again qualified for the NCAA tournament, and Martin played all 4 games, recording a tournament-high 21 points against New Mexico State on March 21, and played 42 minutes against North Carolina on March 28, posting 16 points and 6 rebounds. In 1993 Martin was selected in the All-Great Midwest Conference Second Team.\nProfessional career.\nAfter the end of his senior season in 1993, Martin was automatically eligible for the 1993 NBA draft, but he was not drafted by an NBA franchise. He was selected by the Grand Rapids Hoops in the 2nd round (21st overall) of the 1993 CBA draft. On October 28, 1993 Martin signed a non-guaranteed one-year contract with the Golden State Warriors of the NBA, as a replacement for injured forward Chris Gatling; he was waived on November 2, and signed with the Yakima Sun Kings of the CBA. In his rooke season in the CBA Martin played 55 games (22 starts), averaging 11.5 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, and also appeared in a playoff game, recording 14 points and 5 rebounds in 25 minutes of play. At the end of the season Martin was selected in the CBA All-Rookie First Team. For the following season Martin decided to stay with the Sun Kings, and appeared in 45 games with averages of 12.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, 1,8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.7 blocks per game in 26 minutes per contest; he was selected in the All-Defensive First Team and was the runner-up for Defensive Player of the Year, finishing behind Mike Bell. At the end of the season the Sun Kings won the league title, and Martin averaged 9.8 points and 5.7 rebounds over 14 playoff games.\nIn the summer of 1995 Martin had shoulder surgery, and did not play a single game during the 1995–96 CBA season. Martin had then signed with the Fort Wayne Fury, and was traded in June 1996 to the Omaha Racers. With the new team Martin found increased playing time, starting 22 of 47 games and averaging 9.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.3 steals per game. He also participated in postseason play, averaging 8 points and 4.6 rebounds over 9 games. In 1997 Martin signed with the Idaho Stampede, a new franchise that selected him during the 1997 CBA expansion draft in late May. He started the season with the Stampede; after 10 games (9 starts) during which he averaged 8.2 points, 4.7 rebounds and a career-high 3.2 assists per game, Martin joined the La Crosse Bobcats, and played 35 games with the team, averaging 6.5 points and 4.9 rebounds. Towards the end of the season he joined the Yakima Sun Kings again, and played 5 regular season games and 5 playoff games.\nIn 2000 Martin played for the Luckipar Panthers in Taiwan. He then spent the 2000–01 season in Japan with Denso Hoop Gang. Martin played for the Seoul SK Knights for the 2001–02 KBL season in South Korea, averaging 14.8 points and 12.3 rebounds per game over 45 games.\nNational team career.\nMartin was called up for the United States men's national basketball team for the first time in 1995 for the XII Pan American Games held in Mar del Plata, Argentina. The US national team was put together by Mike Thibault and included only players from the Continental Basketball Association, an American minor league: Martin was playing for the Yakima Sun Kings at the time, and had just won the 1994–95 CBA season with the team. During the competition Martin played 7 games, and averaged 7.7 points and 3.9 rebounds, shooting 75.8% from the field (second on the team behind Mike Williams). At the end of the Pan American Games the United States won the silver medal, having lost the final game to Argentina, despite Martin's 15 points and 8 rebounds.\nMartin received a second call-up for Team USA in 1997, and was included in the team that participated in the 1997 Tournament of the Americas in Montevideo, Uruguay. Again, the team was formed by CBA players, and Martin was a member of the Idaho Stampede roster at the time. Martin played all 9 games during the competition, averaging 3.3 points and 2.8 rebounds per game, led the team in blocks with a total of 9 (tied with Michael McDonald), and won the gold medal. Martin ended his career in the national team with 16 total caps over a period of 2 years.\nCoaching career.\nAfter the end of his professional career as a player, Martin took up coaching. He started in 2003 at Jacobs Center High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, and had the double role of head coach of the junior varsity team and assistant coach for the varsity team for one season. He then joined the coaching staff of Cincinnati State Technical and Community College as an assistant to head coach Andre Tate, and spent two years in the position. In August 2006 he joined Bob Huggins' staff at Kansas State for the 2006–07 season, on his first position in an NCAA Division I program. When Huggins took up the head coach position at West Virginia, Martin followed him; he began working as an assistant coach in the 2007–08 season.\nSouth Carolina State.\nOn July 11, 2022, it was announced that Martin would become the next head coach for South Carolina State, his first head coaching role."

Approximately twenty local volunteers helped create the course.\nTournaments.\nA longer, temporary course called Club et Hôtel du golf Nominingue DGC was set up approximately 2 km North of Camp Nominingue DGC proper to host the PDGA-sanctioned Le Phé-Nominingue tournament in October 2019. The tournament consisted of one round at the Camp Nominingue Disc Golf Course and two rounds at the Club et Hôtel du golf Nominingue DGC. The latter was designed by Christopher Lowcock on most of the land of the Club et Hôtel du Golf Nominingue ball golf course and featured temporary Prodigy baskets."

        "title": "Counter-Strike in esports",
        "text": "Professional \"Counter-Strike\" competition involves professional gamers competing in the first-person shooter game series \"Counter-Strike\". The original game, released in 1999, is a mod developed by Minh \"Gooseman\" Le and Jess Cliffe of the 1998 video game \"Half-Life\", published by Valve. Currently, the games that have been played competitively include \"Counter-Strike\" (CS also called CS 1.6), ' (CS:CZ), ' (CS:S), \"\" (CS:GO), and \"Counter-Strike 2\" (CS2). Major esports championships began in 2001 with the Cyberathlete Professional League Winter Championship, won by Ninjas in Pyjamas.\nHistory.\nThe \"Counter-Strike\" series has over 20 years of competitive history beginning with the original \"Counter-Strike\". Tournaments for early versions of the game have been hosted since 2000, but the first prestigious international tournament was hosted in Dallas, Texas at the 2001 Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL) Winter Championship, won by the Swedish team Ninjas in Pyjamas. The tournament offered a $150,000 prize pool and became known as the first \"\". The final significant update to the original \"Counter-Strike\" game was version 1.6 in 2003, and so the game became known as \"Counter-Strike 1.6\" (\"CS 1.6\").\nIn 2002, the World Cyber Games became the next tournament to host competitive \"Counter-Strike\", followed by the Electronic Sports World Cup in 2003. These, along with the bi-annual CPL tournaments, were the dominant Majors of CS 1.6 through 2007. CPL ceased operation in 2008, but another league, ESL, then added \"Counter-Strike\" to its Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) series. These tournaments continued for four years. The years of 2002-07 are considered \"Counter-Strike's\" first Golden Age, as the game's popularity and market-share eclipsed all others in the fledgling esports industry.\nValve struggled to iterate and evolve on CS 1.6 because of its high skill ceiling and gameplay. The \"Counter-Strike\" Xbox release had limited success as compared to that of \"Halo\" and \"Call of Duty\". The first official sequel was \"\" (CS:S), released on November 1, 2004. The game was criticized by the competitive community, who believed the game's skill ceiling was significantly lower than that of CS 1.6. This caused a divide in the competitive community as to which game to play competitively. Valve, sponsors, and tournament organizers were advocating for the newer CS:S to be played at tournaments, but the large majority of professional CS players refused to play it due to its perceived shortcomings. \"Counter-Strike\" esports gradually decreased in popularity during the late 2000s and early 2010s. This was in part due to the fractured competitive scene, but also due to the newcomer MOBA genre overcoming Counter-Strike's previous stranglehold on the team-based esport market.\nThe release of \"\" (CS:GO) in 2012 reunited the competitive community of \"Counter-Strike\", ushering in a new era of esports relevance for the franchise. Initially, the game was criticized for imbalanced gameplay, poor mechanics and bugs. However, within several months the gameplay improved after updates from Valve. The advent of video game streaming services such as UStream, Justin.tv and Twitch increased the popularity of competitive \"Counter-Strike\". On September 16, 2013, Valve announced a US$250,000 community-funded prize pool for its first ; the money was funded through the \"Arms Deal\" update, which created in-game cosmetics that players could purchase. Valve also announced that the first Major would take place in Sweden at DreamHack Winter 2013. The Valve-sponsored Majors would go on to be the most important and prestigious tournaments in the \"Global Offensive\" esports scene.\nIn October 2015, a number of professional esports organizations with \"Counter-Strike\" teams announced the formation of a trade union that set several demands for future tournament attendance. The announcement was a publicly posted email written by Alexander Kokhanovsky, CEO of Natus Vincere, that was sent to organizers of major esports events. Teams that were part of the union included Natus Vincere, Team Liquid, Counter Logic Gaming, Cloud9, Virtus.pro, Team SoloMid, Fnatic, Ninjas in Pyjamas, Titan and Team EnVyUs. Teams in this union would not attend \"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\" tournaments with prize pools of less than $75,000. In 2016, the World eSports Association (WESA) was founded by ESL with many esports teams, including Fnatic, Natus Vincere, Team EnVyUs and FaZe Clan, though FaZe Clan left soon after the league's formation. In its announcement, WESA said it would \"further professionalize eSports by introducing elements of player representation, standardized regulations, and revenue sharing for teams\". They also planned to help fans and organizers by \"seeking to create predictable schedules.\"\nValve's decisions have a strong influence on the competitive metagame. Decisions such as the removal of old maps and additions of new maps are often met with criticism, as well as changes made to certain weapons' performance characteristics. In 2016, Valve was \"heavily criticized\" for the removal of the map Inferno and its replacement, Nuke, in the competitive map pool. The release of CS 1.6 in 2003 saw a contentious nerf of the iconic AWP sniper rifle by increasing its draw time. This significantly reduced the ability of a player armed with an AWP to simultaneously engage multiple targets. The AWP was again the subject of a controversial nerf in 2015 when players' movement speed and acceleration was decreased while the weapon was equipped. Valve has also implemented new coaching rules restricting the ability of communication between coaches and players during a match, and altered a 15-year precedent by increasing the duration of each round and bomb timer in 2015.\nBy 2014, 25 million copies of the \"Counter-Strike\" series were sold. The game's fan base remains strong, having reached a new record of 1.4 million concurrent players in March 2023, surpassing the game's previous record of 1.3 million concurrent players in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTournament system.\n\"Counter-Strike\" tournaments can be hosted by any entity, and do not have a single official event organizer (like FIFA in football association, for example). The Major Championships, sponsored by Valve and held by different organizers twice a year, are the most prestigious tournaments, although they may not necessarily have the highest prizes. Most of the big teams compete, most of the time, in world tournaments that bring together teams from all corners of the world. Some of the most notable major tournaments are organized by ESL, such as the Intel Extreme Masters and ESL Pro League, and by BLAST, such as the BLAST Premier series. Tournaments that do not have a worldwide character are usually organized for teams of lower level, serving as qualifiers for the main tournaments.\nTeams rankings are published by HLTV and ESL, who use various criteria to determine the best ranked teams from the most recent tournaments. These rankings are then used by some tournament organizers to directly invite teams, depending on their rank. In 2023, Valve announced that starting in 2025, only the official Valve ranking system could be used to generate invitations, and all other \"large-scale\" events need to use open qualifiers.\nMedia coverage.\nAs the game and the scene grew in popularity, companies, including WME/IMG and Turner Broadcasting, began to televise \"Global Offensive\" professional games, with the first being ELEAGUE Major 2017, held at the Fox Theatre and broadcast on US cable television network TBS in 2016. On August 22, 2018, Turner announced its further programming of \"Global Offensive\" with \"ELEAGUE’s Esports 101: CSGO\" and \"\" docuseries on TBS. In 2019 Danish television station TV 2 secured exclusive TV rights to broadcast ESL Pro League and Dreamhack's ESL Pro Tour in Danish. In 2023 TV 2 announced it would no longer broadcast Counter Strike from 2024 onwards citing a lack of commercial sustainability given free alternatives, such as Twitch, and the downturn in results from the Danish superteam Astralis leading to a decline in popularity within Denmark.\nControversies.\nCheating.\nCheating, particularly through the use of software hacks on online servers, has been a problem throughout the history of \"Counter-Strike\" and generally results in a game ban if discovered. A Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) ban is the most common way in which players are banned. VAC is a system designed by Valve to detect cheats on computers. Any time a player connects to a VAC-secured server and a cheat is detected, the user is kicked from the server, given a permanent lifetime ban and barred from playing on any VAC-secured servers. Professional players play online on independent platform servers hosted by leagues such as ESEA or Faceit, which have proprietary anti-cheat programs.\nLinus \"b0bbzki\" Lundqvist was the first known professional player to be banned in \"Global Offensive\". Hovik \"KQLY\" Tovmassian was one of the highest-profile players to be issued a VAC ban. KQLY was banned, along with several other professional players, such as Gordon \"Sf\" Giry, while KQLY was playing for France's best team, Titan. Vinicius “v$m” Moreira from Brazil was VAC-banned while he was playing for Detona Gaming.\nCheating has also occurred at LAN tournaments, and players who cheat at organized tournaments may receive permanent bans or may be dismissed from their team. In 2018, at the eXTREMESLAND ZOWIE Asia CS:GO, Nikhil \"forsaken\" Kumawat of OpTic India was caught cheating mid-match using aimbot during a tournament game against Revolution, a Vietnamese \"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\" team. The tournament had a $100,000 prize pool. OpTic India was disqualified and Kumawat was dismissed from the team.\nIn 2020, the Esports Integrity Commission (ESIC) banned over 37 coaches due to abuse of a spectator mode bug. Valve also has punished these coaches from a number of CS:GO Majors with the severity dependant on the number of times the bug was abused.\nOn 15 April 2021, Valve updated event guidelines to allow players with VAC banned accounts to compete again in Valve sponsored events. The updated rules state: A VAC ban will only disqualify a player from an event if it was either received fewer than 5 years prior, or if it was received at any time after their first participation in a Valve-sponsored event.\nMatch fixing.\nPlayers have also been banned for match fixing. In August 2014, two \"CS:GO\" teams, iBUYPOWER and NetcodeGuides.com, were involved in a match-fixing scandal that has been cited as \"the first large match fixing scandal\" in the \"CS:GO\" community. iBUYPOWER, who was heavily favored to win, lost in a resounding 16-to-4 defeat to NetcodeGuides.com. It was later discovered in a tip to \"Dot Esports\" that the match was fixed.\nOn 20 Jan 2021, ESIC issues sanctions against 35 players for betting related offences primarily in the Australian CS:GO scene.\nOn the 31st of March 2021 the Commissioner of the ESIC, Ian Smith, has revealed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is now involved in the ongoing investigation into match-fixing in North American \"Counter-Strike\", which has been underway since September 2020. ESIC is collaborating with federal law enforcement as part of a larger investigation into players bribed to fix matches by outside \"betting syndicates\".\nGambling.\nFollowing the introduction of weapon skins into \"Global Offensive\" with the \"Arms Deal\" update in August 2013, a virtual economy formed around the skins based on rarity and desirability. Because of this, a number of skin-trading and gambling sites using the Steamworks API were created. Initially, these sites focused on wagering skins on the outcomes of professional and semi-professional CS:GO matches, in the vein of sports betting. However, some of these sites began to offer casino gambling functionality in 2015, allowing users to gamble their skins on the outcome of roulette spins, coin flips, dice rolls, and other games of chance. According to research firm Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, players and esports fans wagered $2.3 billion in 2015, and $5 billion in 2016 on \"CS:GO\" skins. In June and July of that year, two lawsuits were filed against specific gambling sites and Valve, arguing that Valve allowed their skins to be used for illegal underage gambling. Valve began to take steps to prevent these sites from using Steamworks for gambling purposes, and several of the sites ceased operating as a result. In July 2018, Valve disabled the opening of containers in Belgium and the Netherlands after the in-game loot boxes appeared to violate Dutch and Belgium gambling laws. However, some parties have tried to contest Valve's gambling rules."

Later, with Houston's move to the Big 12 Conference as a result of 2021–22 NCAA conference realignment, the future of the rivalry was put in doubt.\nSeries history.\nHouston and SMU would meet three times in the NCAA Tournament before playing in a regular season game, first in 1972. Throughout their shared time in the Southwest Conference, the Cougars and Mustangs would meet seven times in the Southwest Conference men's basketball tournament, with SMU leading 4–3 in their meetings then. The teams have also been conference mates in Conference USA and the American Athletic Conference, meeting once each in the tournaments for each conference.

This time, fortune would favor the Cougars. Led by 31 points from Elvin Hayes, Houston would gain their first series win by a score of 83–75.\nJanuary 16, 1982: In the first year of Phi Slama Jama, SMU visited No. 10 Houston and upset the Cougars 67–66.

Houston would maintain their streak against SMU, winning 75–59. Houston would win the Conference tournament and make an NCAA run before finally losing to North Carolina State in the 1983 NCAA Finals.\nMarch 3, 1985: The days of Phi Slama Jama behind them, the tables turned in favor of SMU with the Mustangs beating No. 11 Oklahoma and No. 5 North Carolina during the 1984-85 season. The No. 13 Mustangs headed to Houston for the final regular season game, only to be handed a 79–76 upset loss.\nFebruary 1, 2016: No. 12 SMU seemed to be heading in the right direction under the leadership of coach Larry Brown, visiting the Cougars with a 19–1 record on the season and having beaten the Cougars already on the season. Coach Kelvin Sampson would earn his first win against SMU, when the Cougars pulled the upset to win 71–68.

In April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full international status to Twenty20 men's matches played between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards. Therefore, all the matches in the Regional Qualifiers were played as Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). The Asia Qualifier consisted of two sub-regional groups, A and B, with the groups being played in Qatar and Malaysia respectively. The winners of each sub-regional group progressed to one of two global qualifiers. On 2 September 2021, the ICC announced that Group A had been moved from Kuwait to Qatar.\nOriginally, the qualifiers were scheduled to be played between March and September 2020. However, on 24 March 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that all ICC qualifying events scheduled to take place before 30 June 2020 had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, the ICC updated the qualification pathway following the disruption from the pandemic. In March 2021, the Group A qualifier was postponed again, and was moved back to October 2021. In May 2021, the Group B qualifier was postponed to November 2021 due to the pandemic.

        "text": "The men's individual golf event at the 2020 Summer Olympics was held from 29 July to 1 August 2021 at the Kasumigaseki Country Club. 60 golfers from 35 nations competed in the event, which was won by Xander Schauffele of the United States.\nBackground.\nThe first Olympic golf tournaments took place at the second modern Games in Paris 1900. Men's and women's events were held. Golf was featured again at the next Games, St. Louis 1904 with men's events (an individual tournament as well as a team event). The 1908 Games in London were also supposed to have a golf competition, but a dispute led to a boycott by all of the host nation's golfers, leaving only a single international competitor and resulting in the cancellation of the event. Golf would disappear from the Olympic programme from then until returning to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\nQualification.\nEach country could qualify from one to four golfers based on the World Rankings of 21 June 2021. The top 60 golfers, subject to limits per nation and guarantees for the host and continental representation, were selected. A nation could have three or four golfers if they are all in the top 15 of the rankings; otherwise, each nation was limited to two golfers. One spot was guaranteed for the host nation Japan and five spots were guaranteed to ensure that each Olympic continent has at least one representative.\nCompetition format.\nFollowing the format used when golf was returned to the Olympic programme in 2016, the tournament is a four-round stroke play tournament, with the lowest score over the total 72 holes winning. \nSchedule.\nAs with most major stroke play tournaments, the event is held over four days (Thursday through Sunday) with each golfer playing one round (18 holes) per day.\nResults.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, 29 July 2021\"\nAustria's Sepp Straka birdied three consecutive holes on his back-nine and finished with a bogey-free round of 63 (−8) to take the first-round lead. A shot behind was Jazz Janewattananond of Thailand, who also did not make a bogey in a seven-under round of 64. Belgium's Thomas Pieters holed out from the fairway for eagle on the par-four 11th hole and shot 65, tied with Carlos Ortiz in third place and two shots behind.\nReigning Open champion Collin Morikawa, at World No. 3 the highest-ranked player in the field, opened with 69 (−2). Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama was four-under on his round through eight holes but made two bogeys to fall back to two-under.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, 30 July 2021\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Saturday, 31 July 2021\"\nThunderstorms caused delays in play and 16 players did not complete the second round on Friday. American Xander Schauffele was the overnight leader after shooting an 8-under-par 63. He held a one stroke lead over Carlos Ortiz of Mexico.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, 31 July 2021\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, 1 August 2021\"\nPan Cheng-tsung won the bronze medal after a seven-man sudden death playoff after Collin Morikawa was eliminated by par on the fourth extra hole. Rory McIlroy, Sebastián Muñoz, and Mito Pereira were all eliminated by birdie on the third extra hole, and Paul Casey and Hideki Matsuyama were both eliminated by par on the first extra hole.\nThe medals for the competition were presented by Sir Craig Reedie, United Kingdom; IOC Member, and the medalists' bouquets were presented by Jay Monahan, United States; IGF Chairman."

Each team consisted of two players from a country. 50 countries originally entered the four-day competition, but Jamaica, Uruguay and the Dominican Republic all withdrew shortly before the start. The team from the Netherlands quit the tournament when one of its players became ill. The combined score of each team determined the team results. A notable player withdrawal, before the tournament begun, was Seve Ballesteros, who was selected to the Spanish team and took part in the Colombian Open on a nearby course the week before, but, reportedly due to his demand of appearance money being denied, didn't play in the World Cup. The Canadian team of Dan Halldorson and Jim Nelford won by three strokes over the Scotland team of Sandy Lyle and Steve Martin.

        "text": "The England cricket team toured India during February and March 2021 to play four Test matches, three One Day International (ODI) and five Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The Tests formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship, and the ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. In December 2020, the full itinerary was released with three venues hosting the entire tour.\nEngland won the first Test by 227 runs, and India won the second Test by 317 runs, to level the series at 1–1. The third Test, a day/night fixture, was completed inside two days, with India winning by ten wickets. The loss meant that England could no longer qualify for the final of the World Test Championship. India won the fourth and final Test by an innings and 25 runs, taking the series 3–1. The series win meant that India joined New Zealand in the final of the World Test Championship.\nIndia won the fourth T20I match by eight runs, to level the series 2–2 with one match to play. India won the fifth and final T20I by 36 runs, to win the series 3–2. India won the first ODI by 66 runs, with England winning the second ODI by six wickets to level the series ahead of the final ODI of the tour. India won the third ODI by seven runs, winning the series 2–1.\nBackground.\nOriginally, England were scheduled to tour India in September and October 2020 to play the ODI and T20I matches. However, after the 2020 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Indian Premier League (IPL) was rescheduled to be played in its place. In February 2020, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced that they would like to play a day/night Test match at the refurbished Narendra Modi Stadium. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed the changes to England's tour in August 2020.\nOn 20 August 2020, Sourav Ganguly, president of the BCCI, said that India would host England to fulfil their Future Tours Programme (FTP) commitments. In September 2020, the BCCI were also in discussions with the Emirates Cricket Board with regards to using the United Arab Emirates to host the series, due to the COVID-19 situation. Later the same month, Sourav Ganguly reiterated that it was a \"priority\" to host the matches in India, and that the BCCI were continuing to monitor the COVID-19 situation.\nThe tour's itinerary originally was scheduled to have five Tests, three ODIs and three T20I matches. However, in November 2020, Sourav Ganguly confirmed that one of the Test matches had been dropped with two more T20I matches added to the tour, in preparation for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. On 1 January 2021, the Government of India announced that up to 50% of fans would be allowed in stadiums for sporting events, and it was expected that the BCCI would also allow fans in the stadiums for the series. Initially, the BCCI and the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) took the decision not to allow fans into the stadium for the first two Test matches. However, the decision was later reversed, with up to 50% of fans allowed to attend the second Test. On 27 January 2021, the England team arrived in Chennai to begin their quarantine ahead of the first Test.\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that Nitin Menon would be one of the on-field umpires for the first two Test matches. Anil Chaudhary and Virender Sharma were also named as on-field umpires for the first and second Tests respectively, with both of them making their debuts as Test cricket umpires. The same set of match officials were retained for the third and fourth Test matches.\nAhead of the first Test, Channel 4 secured the live broadcasting rights for the Test matches. The last time the channel screened live Test cricket in the United Kingdom was for the 2005 Ashes series. It was also the first full broadcast of an England overseas Test series on terrestrial television in the United Kingdom.\nCrowds were allowed to attend the first two T20I matches, with more than 66,000 fans attending each of the two games. However, after a rise in COVID-19 cases in Ahmedabad, the BCCI and the Gujarat Cricket Association agreed to play the remaining T20I and ODI matches behind closed doors.\nSquads.\nOn 19 January 2021, the BCCI named India's squad for the first two Test matches. They also named K. S. Bharat, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Shahbaz Nadeem, Rahul Chahar and Priyank Panchal as standby players, and Ankit Rajpoot, Avesh Khan, Sandeep Warrier, Krishnappa Gowtham and Saurabh Kumar as net bowlers. Two days later, the ECB announced England's squad for the first two Test matches, with James Bracey, Mason Crane, Saqib Mahmood, Matt Parkinson, Ollie Robinson and Amar Virdi named as reserve players. Ollie Pope was not originally named in England's Test squad after sustaining an injury against Pakistan, but was added to the squad on 3 February 2021, after the England medical team were satisfied he had recovered sufficiently. The following day, Zak Crawley was ruled out of England's squad for the first two Tests with a wrist sprain. Ahead of the first Test, both Shahbaz Nadeem and Rahul Chahar were added to India's squad, after Axar Patel was ruled out of the match with a knee injury. England's Jos Buttler was rested for the last three Tests. Jofra Archer was ruled out of England's squad for the second Test due to an elbow injury. Ahead of the second Test, both Shahbaz Nadeem and Rahul Chahar were withdrawn from India's squad, returning to the reserves.\nFollowing the conclusion of the second Test, Jonny Bairstow and Mark Wood were added to England's squad for the third Test. Moeen Ali returned home to England, therefore missing the last two Test matches. On 17 February 2021, the BCCI announced the squad for the last two Test matches, with Umesh Yadav joining the team and replacing Shardul Thakur. The BCCI also retained the same five net bowlers, K. S. Bharat and Rahul Chahar as standby players, and released Abhimanyu Easwaran, Shahbaz Nadeem and Priyank Panchal for the Vijay Hazare Trophy. England's Sam Curran was originally going to be available for the fourth Test, but was ruled out of the Test match due to the logistical challenges during the pandemic. Ahead of the fourth Test, Jasprit Bumrah and Chris Woakes were released from India's and England's squads respectively.\nOn 11 February 2021, England announced their T20I squad with Jake Ball and Matt Parkinson being named as reserves. Danny Briggs, Tom Helm and Will Jacks were also named as non-travelling reserves for England's limited-overs fixtures. Rahul Chahar was added to India's T20I squad, after being one of the standby players for the Test series. On 19 March 2021, India named their ODI squad, with Prasidh Krishna, Krunal Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav earning their maiden call-ups. Two days later, England confirmed their ODI squad, with Jofra Archer being ruled out due to an elbow injury. Jake Ball, Chris Jordan and Dawid Malan remained with the England squad as reserve players. Shreyas Iyer injured his shoulder in the first ODI match, and was ruled out of India's squad for the remaining two fixtures. Eoin Morgan was ruled out of final two ODIs, with Jos Buttler captaining England in Morgan's absence. Sam Billings was also ruled out of the second ODI with Dawid Malan added to England's squad."

India won the fourth and final Test match by three wickets, to win the series 2–1.\nBackground.\nIn April 2020, Kevin Roberts, CEO of Cricket Australia looked at \"creative\" solutions for the tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These included the possibility of playing five Test matches instead of four, and to play all the Test matches behind closed doors at the Adelaide Oval. The Australian government was also looking at applying international travel exemptions to allow the tour to happen. The following month, the BCCI confirmed that they were willing to put players in a two-week quarantine period to ensure that the tour goes ahead. Kevin Roberts later added that there is a \"nine out of 10\" chance of the tour taking place. The Test series was scheduled to start in December 2020, with the first Test in Brisbane. The ODI series was scheduled to start in January 2021. On 28 May 2020, Cricket Australia confirmed all of the fixtures for the series. The following day, Kevin Roberts stated that the number of Test venues could be reduced to one or two grounds, depending on any travel restrictions imposed due to the virus.\nOriginally, the tour was also going to start with three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches, commencing on 11 October 2020, ahead of the then scheduled 2020 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. However, in July 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that the tournament had been postponed until 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the T20I matches were postponed, after they clashed with the revised fixtures for the 2020 Indian Premier League. Despite a lockdown in Melbourne in August 2020, Cricket Australia said they would do everything they can to ensure the Boxing Day Test goes ahead as planned. Cricket Australia were also looking at a revised schedule for the tour, including playing all the limited-overs matches before the Test series. On 20 August 2020, Sourav Ganguly, president of the BCCI, said that India's senior men's team would travel to Australia to fulfil their Future Tours Programme (FTP) commitments.\nIn September 2020, Cricket Australia were looking at further contingency plans for the tour, including moving venues if needed, and the possibility of replacing the Test match in Brisbane with white-ball fixtures. It was later announced that no matches of any form of cricket would be played in Perth, due to a major quarantine breach by then-Sydney Swans player Elijah Taylor during the 2020 AFL season.\nIn October 2020, an updated tour itinerary was published, with the ODIs taking place in Brisbane, the T20Is taking place in Adelaide, and the day/night Test match also taking place in Adelaide. Cricket Australia also confirmed that the Sydney Cricket Ground and the Manuka Oval in Canberra were part of their contingency plan to host the limited overs matches of the tour.\nIn October 2020, plans began to emerge to allow crowds back into venues, with Australia slowly coming out of COVID-19 restrictions. The following month, Cricket Australia confirmed the ground capacities for each match on the tour, with the possibility of more tickets being made available closer to the start of each match.\nIn late December 2020, there was a COVID-19 outbreak in Sydney, prompting tighter restrictions in New South Wales. As a result, Cricket Australia looked at the contingency of swapping the venues of the third and fourth Tests in Sydney and Brisbane respectively. Other scenarios that Cricket Australia were looking at was to host the last two Tests in Sydney, to avoid travel between states, or to host the second and third Tests in Melbourne. On 29 December 2020, Cricket Australia confirmed that Sydney would host the third Test as scheduled. On 4 January 2021, the crowd capacity of the Sydney Cricket Ground was reduced from 50% to 25%.\nSquads.\nOn 26 October 2020, India named their squad for the tour, with Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Kartik Tyagi, Ishan Porel and T. Natarajan named as additional bowlers to travel with the team. Rohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma were not named in India's squads, after both players suffered injuries during the 2020 Indian Premier League. KL Rahul was named as the vice-captain of India for the limited overs matches, in place of Rohit Sharma.\nOn 9 November 2020, the BCCI made several updates for the squads for the tour.

On 24 November 2020, the BCCI confirmed that Ishant Sharma and Rohit Sharma had been ruled out of the first two Test matches. On 26 November 2020, T. Natarajan was added to India's squad for the ODI series. Natarajan was named as cover for Navdeep Saini, who was suffering with a back spasm. Later the same day, the BCCI also confirmed that Ishant Sharma had been ruled out of the tour due to injury.\nIn November 2020, Kane Richardson was withdrawn from Australia's ODI and T20I squads, after he opted to stay at home with his newborn son. Andrew Tye was named as Richardson's replacement. On 30 November 2020, David Warner was ruled out of the remaining limited-overs games after suffering a groin injury in the second ODI. Subsequently, D'Arcy Short was named as Warner's replacement in the T20I series. Additionally, Pat Cummins was rested for the remainder of the white-ball matches to prepare for the Test series. Ashton Agar was ruled out of Australia's squad for the T20I series due to an injury, with Mitchell Swepson replacing him.\nOn 4 December 2020, India's Ravindra Jadeja suffered a concussion during the first T20I match. He was ruled out of the rest of the T20I series, with Shardul Thakur named as his replacement. The following day, Cameron Green was released from Australia's T20I squad, with Nathan Lyon named as his replacement.

On 30 December 2020, Joe Burns was dropped from Australia's squad for the third and fourth Tests, with David Warner, Will Pucovski and Sean Abbott returning to the Test squad. On 4 January 2021, James Pattinson was ruled out of the third Test, and was not replaced in Australia's squad. Will Pucovski was ruled out of Australia's squad for the fourth Test due to a shoulder injury, with Marcus Harris named as his replacement.\nOn 11 December 2020, the BCCI confirmed that Rohit Sharma had passed a fitness assessment, and would be available for selection for the last two Test matches. On 19 December 2020, Mohammed Shami was ruled out of India's squad for the last three Tests, after suffering a fractured arm in the first Test. T. Natarajan was added to India's squad ahead of the third Test match. Umesh Yadav was ruled out of India's squad for the last two Tests, due to a calf injury.

On 12 January 2021, Washington Sundar was added to India's squad for the fourth Test, replacing Ravindra Jadeja.\nTour matches.\nTwo three-day tour matches were played in Sydney, with both matches having first-class status. The second match was a day/night fixture in preparation for the first Test.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nDay One.\nPrithvi Shaw was bowled by Mitchell Starc with the second ball of the match. India consolidated by batting slowly, even as multiple chances were created but not taken by the Australians—Pujara had chances while on 0, 2 and 4, all evading fielders. India lost Agarwal with a ball from Cummins that nipped between bat and pad. Kohli and Pujara were not out at the lunch break, with India 2/41 after 25 overs, Pujara 17 and Kohli 5. India continued to bat slowly until tea, even after losing Pujara for 43 from 160 balls, India were 3/107 at the tea break. Just after 9pm, Rahane drove the ball to mid-off and called a run, but sent Kohli back leaving him stranded in the middle of the pitch. Hazlewood fielded the ball and Lyon broke the stumps, with Kohli being run out for 74. Rahane followed shortly after as he was dismissed lbw to Starc for 42 off 92 balls. Vihari was soon dismissed by Hazlewood, also by lbw, for 16 runs. After India were ahead for most of the day, Australia were now even or just in front, with India 6/233 at stumps.\nDay Two.\nIndia lost their seventh wicket without adding to their overnight score, Ashwin dismissed by Cummins on the 3rd ball of the day. Saha flashed at a wide ball from Starc the next over, but all he could manage was an edge through to Paine behind the stumps. The Indian tail lasted only a few more overs, with Starc and Cummins claiming the final two wickets of Yadav for 6 and Shami for a duck. India was all out for 244, adding only 11 to their overnight score.\nAustralia, like India, batted slowly with four consecutive maidens at the start of the innings. Wade, who was only 8 off 50 balls, was deceived by Bumrah as he fell over his front pad and was trapped in front, a DRS review doing nothing to help his cause. Australia was 1/16 after 14.1 overs. Burns was lbw to Bumrah on the final ball of his next over, which was again reviewed but showed the ball crashing into the stumps. Labuschagne and Smith were at the wicket. Labuschagne was given three chances with two drops by Bumrah and Shaw. Shortly after the Shaw drop, Smith was almost runout at the non-striker's end as he was sent back by Labuschagne. However his luck ran out as he edged one from Ashwin to first slip, scoring just 1 from 29 balls as India dried up his scoring. Australia was 3/45 from 27 overs. Head and Green were skittled by Ashwin for low scores as Australia struggled to 5/92 from 48 overs at tea, Labuschagne was 46* and Paine was 9*. Labuschagne perished soon after tea but Paine rescued Australia's innings slightly as the tail wagged, dragging Australia to 191 from 72.1 overs, Paine stranded on 73* from 99 balls. Australia had 6 overs to bowl at the Indian openers, and managed to capture Shaw's wicket in the 4th over for 4. India sent out Bumrah as a nightwatchman, India 1/9 at stumps with a lead of 62.\nDay Three.\nA remarkable spell of fast bowling followed. Bumrah was caught and bowled by Cummins in the second over of the day for 2. India was now 2/15. Pujara was removed for an eight-ball duck the next over by Cummins. Hazlewood continued, taking Agarwal for 9 and Rahane in the following over, completing a double-wicket maiden. The collapse continued as Kohli came to the wicket and scored a flashy four through gully but as he tried to repeat it, the ball caught the edge and was caught at gully by the debutant Green. India was 6/19 with a lead of just 72. Saha was caught by Labuschagne at midwicket for 4 in the 19th over, the replacement Ashwin being removed for a golden duck, both by Hazlewood. Vihari was taken by Hazlewood in the 21st over taking the score to 9/31. Cummins bowled the next over and hit Shami on his bowling arm. He tried to continue after being treated, but left the field and retired hurt. It was later revealed he had suffered a fractured wrist after undergoing scans. India had been bowled out for 36, their lowest in an innings of a Test match. This was the first time in an innings no batsman or extras had reached double figures.\nAustralia had been set 90 to win. Australia had 5 overs before the lunch break and reached the interval without losing a wicket, 0/15. The openers Burns and Wade reached 70 but then Wade was dismissed in a bizarre runout where the ball bounced off short leg's protective pad, Saha collecting it and flicking it through his legs to dislodge the bails. Labuschagne came to the crease and tried to attack Ashwin, top edging a hit over midwicket, caught by Agarwal at mid on. In what would be the final over of the match, Smith came to the wicket and scored a single off his first ball. Umesh bowled wide to Burns and he hit it through the slips cordon for 4. Burns, looking for his 50, hit the ball down to the fine leg fence, Vihari dropping the catch on the boundary, thus causing the ball to fly over for 6, Burns finishing on 51* along with Smith 1*, Australia winning by 8 wickets.\n2nd Test.\nDay One.\nBurns fell for a 10-ball duck in the fifth over of the match. Labuschagne came to the crease and put on a small partnership with Wade, but was broken in the 13th over, when Wade skied a pull shot off Ashwin, dismissed for 30. Smith came and went quickly for a duck in the 15th over. Australia were 3/38. Labuschagne and Head put on an 86 run partnership before Head edged to gully off Bumrah for 38. Labuschagne topscored with 48. The lower order managed to get Australia to 195 after 72.3 overs. Australia had 11 overs to bowl to India, and Starc managed to get Agarwal for a duck on the sixth ball of the innings. India were 1/36 at stumps, trailing by 159.\nDay Two.\nGill lost his wicket in the 22nd over after making 45 from 65 deliveries. Pujara followed in the 24th over for 17 from 70 deliveries, both wickets being taken by Pat Cummins. India were 3/90 after 37 overs at lunch; Rahane was on 10 and Vihari on 13. Lyon got Vihari on 21 in the 45th over. Pant made 29 at a strike rate of 72.50 as India reached 5/189 at tea. Jadeja then combined with Rahane as they accelerated in the final session of the day to take India to 5/277 with Rahane ending the day on 104*, and Jadeja 40*.\nDay Three.\nRahane was run out by Labuschagne combining with Tim Paine at the stumps for 112. Jadeja was removed by Starc for 57, and India were 7/306. The tail folded in the next nine overs. India had added just 49 runs in the session, as they were bowled out for 326, creating a first-innings lead of 131. Australia came out to bat after lunch and Burns again fell cheaply to Yadav in the 4th over, however Yadav left soon after with muscle pain and left India with a bowler down. Labuschagne offered some resistance but edged a ball from Ashwin to Rahane at slip, making 28 runs. Australia were 2/65 at tea, Wade was on 27 and Smith was on 6. In the final session, Smith was dismissed for 8, bowled behind his legs by Bumrah causing Australia to be 3/71 after 32.2 overs. Wade fell for 40 in the 44th over, and Head followed shortly after for 17 in the 47th over. Australian captain Paine was controversially given out by the third umpire after the on field umpire ruled not out in the 48th over, falling for 1. Australia ended the day at 6/133, a lead of 2 runs. Green and Cummins were 17* and 15* respectively.\nDay Four.\nThe final day of the game ended just after lunch with India achieving victory by eight wickets. Green and Cummins initially resisted the Indian attack, however Cummins fell for 22 to a Bumrah bouncer, and Green, batting with the tail, was caught in the same way as the last match—a mistimed pull shot caught at midwicket. Australia quickly folded for 200, setting India a target of 70 to win. India in their second innings lost Agarwal and Pujara to low scores but captain Rahane and Gill finished on 27* and 35*, achieving the target in 15.5 overs, to level the series 1–1.\n3rd Test.\nDay One.\nWarner was gone in the fourth over of the match for 5 runs, edging to Pujara in the slips off Siraj. Labuschagne came out to bat and joined the debutant opening batsman Pucovski. Australia was 1/21 in the 8th over, when play was stopped one ball into the over due to rain. Lunch was taken early, as 35 overs were lost due to rain. The covers were cleared before tea, and Pucovski was dropped on 26 and 32 by Rishabh Pant before reaching his maiden half century off 97 balls. Australia was 1/93 from 31 overs at tea with Pucovski on 54* and Labuschagne on 34*. Pucovski fell for 62, ending a 100-run stand. Australia was 2/106. Smith came to the wicket, as Labuschagne brought up his 50 off 108 balls, with six fours. Australia ended the day on 2/166 with Labuschagne on 67* and Smith on 31*. Australia was generally considered on top at stumps.\nDay Two.\nRain delays continued, as Australia reached 200 in the 69th over. Labuschagne fell shortly after for 91, caught by Rahane at slip from the bowling of Jadeja. Smith received little support from the rest of the team as Australia collapsed to lose its final eight wickets for 130 runs. Green, Cummins and Lyon were all dismissed for ducks. Despite this, Smith made his 27th Test hundred batting with the tail, but was finally run out for 131 off 226 balls. India came out to bat and the opening pair of Gill and Rohit Sharma put on 70 before Sharma was caught and bowled by Hazlewood for 26, on the final ball of the 27th over. Gill fell shortly after for 50, being caught at gully by Green off the bowling of Cummins. India finished the day on 2/96 from 45 overs, erasing Australia's lead to 242 runs at stumps. Pujara was 9* and Rahane was 5*.\nDay Three.\nRahane was bowled by Cummins for 22 from 70 balls in the 55th over. Pujara anchored the innings, adding 50 off 176 balls as India collapsed from 3/142 to 244 all out, as Vihari, Ashwin and Bumrah were all run out. Australia had a first innings lead of 94. Australia had 29 overs to bat out in the final session. Pucovski was caught behind off Siraj for 10 in the sixth over, and Warner fell in the tenth over, leg before wicket to Ashwin for 13. Australia was 2/35 but Smith and Labuschagne partnered together to a stand of 68 at stumps, Australia was 2/103 from 29 overs, and Labuschagne was 47* while Smith was 29*. Australia led by 197.\nDay Four.\nLabuschagne again fell short of a hundred as he was caught behind off Saini for 73. Smith, Green and Paine batted Australia to a lead of 406, as they made 81, 84 and 39* respectively. India had a target of 407 to win the match in four sessions. India had another promising first wicket stand, until Gill was claimed for 31 in the 23rd over by Hazlewood. Sharma's wicket was claimed by Cummins in the 31st over as he attempted a pull shot but was caught at backward square leg by Starc. India was 2/98 from 34 overs at stumps, with Pujara on 9* and Rahane 4*.\nDay Five.\nIndia required 309 on the final day. Rahane was caught by Wade at short leg off the bowling of Lyon in the second over of the day. India was 3/102. Pant was sent out at number five and put on a 148-run partnership with Pujara before Pant fell for 97 in the 80th over. Pujara was bowled by Hazlewood in the 89th over. Vihari and Ashwin survived the rest of the overs without too much trouble, as India played the match out for a draw. They did have a scare in the 123rd over, as Starc caught the edge of Vihari's bat, but the chance was dropped by the keeper Paine. The chance of the match ending in a win for either team was dropping at this point, as the five wickets for Australia and 88 runs proved too difficult for either team to manage. Vihari finished with 23* (161) and Ashwin was 39* (128).\n4th Test.\nDay One.\nThe start of the game saw a massive difference in terms of experience between the two sides. Indian bowlers had a combined total of 13 wickets, with T Natarajan and Washington Sundar making their debuts following injuries to Bumrah and Ashwin. However, this did not deter the Indian bowling who started with the session by dismissing both Warner and Marcus Harris in the first hour. This was followed by determined batting by Smith and Labuschagne. Labuschagne finally got his much deserved century late in the day with Australia ending on 5/274. India suffered further injury setbacks when Navdeep Saini left the field owing to groin pain.\nDay Two.\nDay two started with India fighting back and dismissing Paine early. Some lower order resistance resulted in Australia reaching 369 before being dismissed at the stroke of lunch. India lost Gill early in their reply. However, Rohit Sharma and Pujara steadied the innings. However, Sharma fell due to his intention to attack Nathan Lyon, who was playing his 100th Test. Rain wiped out the last session and India finished the day on 2/62.\nDay Three.\nDay three started with Pujara and Rahane leading India's reply. However, Pujara was dismissed by Hazlewood. Rahane fell soon after and with Mayank Agarwal, playing in middle order and Pant falling in the second session India were in trouble at 6/186. This was followed by the most enterprising partnership of the match with debutant Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur, playing only his second Test, counter punching. They both scored sixties and with their 123 run partnership made sure India got as close to Australia's total as possible. Australia ended the day on 0/21.\nDay Four.\nDay four started with Warner and Harris leading the charge for Australia. Runs were scored fairly easily before Thakur got Harris out after an opening wicket partnership of 89 runs. Warner was soon dismissed by Sundar with Australia ending on 4/149 at Lunch. The post-lunch session saw Green and Smith consolidate Australia's position before Smith was dismissed for 55 by Siraj. Rain caused early tea with Australia on 7/243. Post tea session saw Siraj get his maiden five-wicket haul as Australia were finally dismissed for 294 setting India a target of 328 runs, or bat out 114 overs. India ended the day on 0/4 as rain brought an early end to proceedings.\nDay Five.\nIndia lost Rohit Sharma early on the last day. This was however followed by a 114 run partnership between Gill and Pujara as India set out to chase the target. Gill was dismissed for 91. Rahane hit a quickfire 24 off 22 balls, as India ended the second session on 183/3, meaning they required 145 runs of 37 overs. The post-tea session saw Pant ignite this test match as he in combination with Pujara led India's reply. Pujara fell for 56 immediately after new ball was taken. This was followed by Mayank Agarwal failing for the second time in the match. However, Pant led the charge as India reached the final target with three overs left in the day. The win has been regarded as India's greatest overseas triumph and meant Australia lost a Test at the Gabba for the first time since 1988.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 2022, Voot released a four-episodes documentary miniseries on India's Test series victory called \"Bandon Mein Tha Dum\" (translation : The Boys Had Guts) directed by Neeraj Pandey and narrated by Jimmy Shergill. It featured interviews of Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravichandran Ashwin, Rishabh Pant, Hanuma Vihari, Mohammad Siraj, Washington Sundar, Tim Paine, Pat Cummins, and several cricket journalists."

The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.\nOriginally, the matches were scheduled to be played in October 2020. However, in August 2020, the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following month, it was confirmed that both cricket boards were looking for a window in the international calendar to play the matches. In October 2020, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced that the tour had been rescheduled for April 2021. In January 2021, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that the tour was still on their schedule for the 2021 calendar year. In February 2021, the tour dates were confirmed, including the addition of a fourth T20I fixture. On 4 March 2021, CSA announced that Temba Bavuma had been appointed as South Africa's limited overs captain, taking over the role from Quinton de Kock.\nPakistan won the first ODI by three wickets, with South Africa winning the second match by seventeen runs to level the series.

Pakistan's Babar Azam captained the team for the first time in ODI cricket.\nIn the second ODI, Aleem Dar of Pakistan stood in his 210th ODI match as an on-field umpire, surpassing South African Rudi Koertzen's record of officiating in the most ODI matches. In the second T20I, Ahsan Raza of Pakistan stood in his 50th T20I match as an on-field umpire, becoming the first umpire to reach the milestone in T20I cricket.\nPakistan won the first two ODI matches to take an unassailable lead in the series. The third match was tied, with Zimbabwe winning the Super Over. It was Zimbabwe's first win in an ODI in Pakistan since November 1998. Pakistan also won the first two T20I matches to win the series. They also won the third T20I by eight wickets to take the series 3–0. Zimbabwe's Elton Chigumbura retired from international cricket following the conclusion of the tour.\nBackground.\nIn August 2020, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced that the tour was still going ahead as planned, and were preparing a bio-secure environment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, the PCB were considering to host both the T20I and ODI series at a single venue in Lahore. However, in September 2020, it was announced that the T20I and ODI series would be held in Rawalpindi and Multan respectively. On 9 October 2020, the PCB moved the matches from Multan to Lahore, following a disagreement with the government in the city over finances. Multan last hosted international matches in April 2008, when Bangladesh played at the venue.\nOn 11 October 2020, the PCB confirmed the itinerary for the series, with the ODI matches taking place in Rawalpindi, and the T20I matches taking place in Lahore. Smog had been forecast in Lahore during November, with the PCB monitoring the situation. On 23 October 2020, the PCB made a further change to the tour, moving all the T20I matches from Lahore to Rawalpindi, because of the concerns about the smog.\nIn September 2020, Zimbabwe Cricket stated that the official confirmation of travelling to Pakistan was imminent. Tavengwa Mukuhlani, chairman of Zimbabwe Cricket, said he was \"hopeful\" that the tour would go ahead. On 20 September 2020, Zimbabwe named a preliminary squad of 25 players to begin training ahead of the tour. On 23 September 2020, Zimbabwe Cricket received government permission to travel to Pakistan. On 19 October 2020, the Zimbabwe team departed from the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport, arriving in Pakistan early the next day. The Zimbabwean head coach Lalchand Rajput did not travel with the team, so their bowling coach Douglas Hondo was put in charge of the team. The PCB also confirmed the match officials for the tour on the same day.\nSquads.\nOn 19 October 2020, Misbah-ul-Haq, head coach and chief selector of the Pakistan team, named a twenty-two man squad of \"probables\" for the series. The squad travelled to Lahore to begin COVID-19 testing and training ahead of the ODI matches, with the squads for each format being named later. Pakistan's vice-captain, Shadab Khan, was ruled out of the ODI series, after suffering an injury during a warm-up game. Haider Ali was added to Pakistan's squad for the second ODI. He replaced Haris Sohail, who suffered an injury during the first ODI match. For the third and final ODI, Abdullah Shafique, Zafar Gohar and Mohammad Hasnain were added to the squad, replacing Imad Wasim, Abid Ali and Haris Rauf. However, on the morning of the third ODI, Haris Rauf was re-added to the team, after Faheem Ashraf was suffering from food poisoning.\nAhead of the T20I series, Abid Ali, Haris Sohail and Imam-ul-Haq were released from Pakistan's squad. Shadab Khan was also unavailable for selection for Pakistan's squad for the T20Is, due to his earlier injury which ruled him out of the ODI matches."

Lockie Ferguson and Colin de Grandhomme were both ruled out of New Zealand's Test squad due to injuries, with New Zealand Cricket naming the Test squad on 21 December 2020. Neil Wagner was ruled out of New Zealand's squad for the second Test, after suffering two broken toes during the first Test. Matt Henry was named as Wagner's replacement for the second Test.\nPractice matches.\nThe Pakistan A team were scheduled to play two four-day matches against the New Zealand A team, one in Queenstown and one in Whangārei, in December 2020. Both fixtures were unofficial Test matches, with first-class status. However, the first match was cancelled following a delay for the Pakistan cricketers to practice in isolation. The Pakistan squad opted to play intra-squad matches in Queenstown instead. The Pakistan A squad also played twenty-over matches against several New Zealand domestic sides."

The 1908 Games in London were also supposed to have a golf competition, but a dispute led to a boycott by all of the host nation's golfers, leaving only a single international competitor and resulting in the cancellation of the event.

His 47-yard field goal against UCLA was the nation's longest kick in 1932.\nIn 1944, he was hired as head football coach and athletic director at Richland High School in Richland, Washington. He later coached at Yakima Valley Junior College in Yakima, Washington.\nEubank ran for United States Congress in 1948, winning the Democratic Party nomination for Washington's 4th congressional district race before losing to incumbent Hal Holmes in the general election. Eubank died on August 29, 1964, of a heart attack, at Kennewick General Hospital in Kennewick, Washington."

        "text": "The 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Final was a beach soccer match which took place on 1 December 2019 at Los Pynandi World Cup Stadium in Luque, Paraguay, to determine the winners of the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. It was the final and hence the last match of the 10th FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, a biennial competition contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. \nAs the fourth all-European final (following 2001, 2005 and 2013), the match pitted the European champions of 2018 and 2019 respectively against each other: Italy, who had previously competed in one World Cup final, in 2008, and Portugal, who appeared in their third FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup final and their sixth overall when taking into account the pre-FIFA era \"Beach Soccer World Championships\"; their last appearance was four years prior in 2015.\nIn what was seen as an evenly contested affair, Portugal emerged as victors thanks to a series of successful free kicks, clinching the match by six goals to four to win their second FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup crown (following 2015) and third world title overall (including success in the 2001 World Championship), condemning Italy to a second runners-up medal. The match was also notable as the 583rd and final international beach soccer appearance of Madjer; the Portuguese captain, often hailed as the best player of all-time, announced his retirement immediately following the match.\nBackground.\nWorld Cup history comparison.\nBoth nations are veterans at World Cups, with Portugal missing only one and Italy, two, since their debuts (1997 and 1995 respectively). The former had had considerably more success than the latter. \nDuring the \"World Championships\" era, Portugal became champions in 2001 and finished on the podium a further four times (1999, 2002, 2003, 2004). Since the FIFA era began, Portugal have fared relatively similarly, winning the 2015 title, finishing as runners-up in 2005 and earning bronze medals three times (2008, 2009, 2011). This was Portugal's third FIFA final and sixth overall. Italy's best finish of the World Championships was a single bronze medal, in 1996. Italy reached their first final during the FIFA era in 2008, when they lost to Brazil 5–3, and this remained their only podium finish of this era until now. This was Italy's second World Cup final. However, more recently, after neither team qualified for 2013, Italy had reached the semi-finals of the last two editions, one better than their Iberian opponents.\n2019 season comparison.\nBoth teams had enjoyed generally successful seasons but not without some negatives. As European nations, they had competed in many of the same events.\nPortugal failed in qualification for the World Beach Games, but compensated for this disappointment by claiming the gold medal at the European Games and becoming six-time European champions at the Euro Beach Soccer League (EBSL). Despite reaching this final, they narrowly qualified for the World Cup in July, finishing in the final qualification spot, but also won the silver medal at the Mediterranean Beach Games. Portugal were world ranked 4th going into the match.\nItaly went into the season as reigning European champions having won the 2018 EBSL and began the year by qualifying for the World Beach Games, where they went on to lose to Iran in the bronze medal match. They only managed a fifth-place finish at the European Games, but claimed fourth in the EBSL and second place in qualification for the World Cup. The Mediterranean Beach Games was their most successful event, where they claimed the gold medal. Italy was world-ranked 3rd going into the match.\nPrevious matches.\nAt World Cups.\nThe teams had gone head-to-head three times previously at World Cups, twice during the World Championships era and once in the FIFA era. The three meetings are documented below:\nRecent results (all competitions).\nThe teams had already met on three previous occasions in 2019, with Italy winning two, however Portugal had won the most recent contest. Before then, the teams had not clashed for over two years. However, overall, the two teams had met 48 times previously. The last five meetings are documented in the below table:\nMatch.\nSummary.\nPeriod one began with Portugal on the offensive and Italy on the defensive, the latter's style compared to the \"Catenaccio\" tactics classically used by their national football team. Hence, the Portuguese were the team creating the goal-scoring opportunities and dominating play, but on six minutes, Italy scored against the run of play – after a shot from Madjer (Portugal's twelfth of the match), Corosiniti played a ball through the middle to Zurlo who slotted home Italy's first shot of the match. 90 seconds later, Chiavaro fouled Leo Martins up against the touchline, just outside the Italian penalty area. The Portuguese smashed his free kick into the bottom left hand corner to equalise the score. Portugal continued to dominate, having over 70% possession of the ball, but Italy began creating opportunities of their own as the period neared its end. After an injury timeout following Corosiniti and Belchior's clash, the period concluded with the score still level at 1–1.\nThe second period started with a more even spread of chances for both teams. Del Mestre was forced into good saves from Jordan and then Be Martins, whilst, Gori and Zurlo saw their free kicks go narrowly wide for Italy. In the sixth minute, the deadlock was broken. Leo Martins won possession just inside his own half and lead Portugal on a quick counterattack, ultimately squaring the ball to an unmarked Jordan in the middle who fired home at the edge of the box. 30 seconds after the restart, Jordan won a long-range free kick, with his effort saved by a diving Del Mestre. However, the Italian mistakenly parried the ball back into the centre of the box; with the goal left undefended, Lourenço pounced onto the loose ball for a tap in, putting Portugal up 3–1. Despite the two goal gap, the game remained balanced as the second half of period two progressed; Leo Martins wasted a great chance, a one-on-one opportunity against the goalkeeper, shooting wide.\nJordan converted a powerful free kick from the centre of the pitch during the opening stages of period three to open up a 4–1 lead for Portugal. This deficit saw Italy become more offensive to try and bridge the gap. One minute later, Jordan was guilty of a foul on Gori, conceding a penalty, but the Italian's spot kick attempt was saved by Andrade. The attacking play of Italy began opening up more spaces for Portugal to exploit. Soon after, Leo Martins completed a brace from a free kick given away by Marinai just outside the Italian box, extending the Portuguese lead to 5–1 with just eight minutes left on the clock. Protests surrounding the foul lead to a flurry of yellow cards, for Jordan, Del Mestre and Chiavaro. After a Corosiniti effort hit the post, Italy scored two goals inside the 31st minute. First a one-two between Zurlo and Ramacciotti saw the latter slotting past Andrade at close range. And then from Ramacciotti's corner, Josep Junior ran from deep to head in at the back post for 5–3, reigniting the match as a contest, seeing Portugal take a more cautious approach into the final minutes. Gori almost made it 5–4 with two minutes left, hitting a bicycle kick against the post, but a controversial foul by Ramacciotti mere seconds later (for which he was booked) allowed Jordan to complete his hat-trick via the free kick. Italy's remaining efforts proved futile, save for a final attempt by Ramacciotti through Andrade's legs mere seconds from full time. But the goal bothered Portugal not as they knew they had won the game , and as the last seconds ticked by, the TV cameras were already focused on Madjer on the Portuguese bench who had begun crying.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nTournament awards.\nWhen the individual awards were presented at the conclusion of the final, players of the final's competing teams, Italy and Portugal, mopped up those on offer, claiming five of the seven available. Italy's Gabriele Gori and Emmanuele Zurlo won the Golden and Silver Scorer awards respectively, whilst Portugal's Jordan Santos, Bê Martins and Elinton Andrade won the Silver, Bronze Balls and Golden Glove awards respectively.\nQuotes from participants.\nPlayers and staff made analytic comments to the media after the match, including: \nItalian silver shoe winner, Emmanuele Zurlo:\nI am really proud of my team-mates. In the end, we have the bitterness of not having won the final, it will always be there, the truth is that we had a great tournament and we need to be happy to have gone all the way to the final. We’ve shown the world what kind of team Italy is, that we are capable of beating anyone, but in the end Portugal were deserved champions and were better.\nPortuguese coach, Mário Narciso:\nThe games between Portugal and Italy are always very divided. The teams are very equal, but of course I was hoping we could win. At this moment what is in my soul is a great joy, not only for me but also for those who are in the dressing room... the feeling that I made my contribution to this achievement is amazing. It was a dream year, we had a lot of victories! It won't be easy to match.\nTop scorer of the final, Jordan Santos of Portugal:\nThe key to our success was playing well in the crucial matches. This is an experienced squad, full of players who knew what it was like to be crowned champions, and that made the difference.\nThis is the perfect way to end a fantastic year, bearing in mind we also won the Euro Beach Soccer League and the European Games. It’s a great source of pride to represent your country in such a way. I don’t think I’ll sleep with the trophy, as it’s a bit hard, but maybe I’ll do it with the medal!\nMadjer's retirement.\nAfter the trophy ceremony, Portuguese captain, Madjer, clarified his tears at the final whistle as \"farewell tears\"; he announced his retirement from international beach soccer, aged 42, bringing to an end a 22 year playing career, having claimed eleven individual awards at FIFA editions of the World Cup, as well as being by far the tournament's all-time top scorer with 88 goals and a total of 140 since the 1995 establishment of a world championship for beach soccer. He debuted for Portugal against Chile in the 1998 World Championship, and was the only player to be part of all three of Portugal's title winning teams to date. The announcement came in spite of plans he had recently revealed stating he would retire sometime in 2020. Being widely regarded as the greatest player of all-time, his announcement was met with an outpouring of tributes from fellow players and media outlets.\nMadjer revealed the news in an emotional speech to the media:\nA big hug to all Portuguese, I thank from the bottom of my heart all the support you have given me throughout my career. I owe a lot to you, I owe a lot to this team, I owe a lot to everyone. Today was my last game... [*begins crying*] ...I want to thank all Portuguese, all my colleagues, coaches, all the staff, people who worked with me until today. To say that I leave happy, fulfilled, proud to be Portuguese, and above all proud of this family that has been building more beautiful beach soccer, with fair play around the world. Thank you, Portuguese pride!\nAftermath.\nReception in Portugal and Italy.\nThe Portuguese team subsequently flew home from Asuncion the next day, arriving back in Portugal at 07:00 WET on 3 December. Having accepted an invitation, the team then travelled to Belém Palace in Lisbon to meet with the President of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa at 13:45 in the \"Sala das Bicas\". During the meeting, the delegation was commended with civil and national orders – the team's technical staff were awarded the title of Grand Officers of the Order of Merit, the players were bestowed with the title of Commanders of the Order of Merit, and Madjer was knighted, being made a Commander of the Order of Prince Henry. On 4 December, the whole team appeared for an interview on a domestic daytime TV talk show. Coach Mário Narciso, players Madjer and João Gonçalves, team doctor Eduardo Farinha as well as Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) vice-president, Humberto Coelho and directior, Pedro Dias, were received at the 12 December plenary session of the Assembly of the Republic to be honoured by the chamber in recognition of the team's achievements.\nItalian Football Federation (FIGC) president Gabriele Gravina and Lega Nazionale Dilettanti (LND) president Cosimo Sibilia, both issued statements congratulating the Italian team on their silver medal and viewed the team's tournament very positively, despite the final loss, noting the increased engagement of new fans and reaffirming their commitments to develop the sport domestically.\nBroadcasting and viewership.\nViewership was reported in the days following the final. In Portugal, the match started at 21:00 local time and was broadcast live on free-to-air television channel RTP2, earning an average audience share of 3.2% (~0.16m viewers), peaking with an audience share of 4.9% (~0.24m viewers) at 22:12; this coincided with the final minute of the match. In Italy, the match started at 22:00 local time and was broadcast live on pay television channel Sky Sport, earning an audience share of 0.4% (~0.1m viewers)."

The Central Asian country's President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov expressed his intention in which he reiterated his aim to use sport to raise the profile of the nation. Berdimuhamedov described the proposal as \"fully in accord\" with the plans of the nation, adding that the country has \"all the necessary conditions\". Igor Makarov, the Ashgabat-born president of the Russian Cycling Federation, outlined the attractions of the Ashgabat Sports Complex Velodrome. The velodrome is among the largest velodromes in the world with room for 6000 spectators. He appealed directly to the president to consider bidding for the event. The championships would represent the largest-profile sporting event ever held in Turkmenistan. President of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) David Lappartient called the Ashgabat Velodrome \"one of the most beautiful in the world\" and noted that it was thanks to this structure that it was decided to grant Turkmenistan the right to host the World Track Cycling Championship in 2021.\nIn June 2021 the UCI announced that the championships would be moved to a different venue.

The defending champion was Hanna Öberg of Sweden.\nCompetition format.\nIn the mass start, all biathletes start at the same time and the first across the finish line wins. In this competition, the distance is skied over five laps; there are four bouts of shooting (two prone and two standing, in that order) with the first shooting bout being at the lane corresponding to the competitor's bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race), with the rest of the shooting bouts being on a first-come, first-served basis (if a competitor arrives at the lane in fifth place, they shoot at lane 5). As in the sprint and pursuit, competitors must ski one penalty loop for each miss. Here again, to avoid unwanted congestion, World Cup Mass starts are held with only the 30 top ranking athletes on the start line (half that of the pursuit) as here all contestants start simultaneously."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Spartans represent Michigan State University in the NCAA's Big Ten Conference.\nMichigan State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1898. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Michigan State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

In a Mass start event only 30 athletes are allowed to participate and the points awarded for ranks 22 to 30 differ from the system used in other events. Equal placings (ties) give an equal number of points. An athlete's total World Cup Score is the sum of all World Cup points earned in the season, minus the points from 2 events in which the athlete got their worst scores. Ties in this score are broken by comparing the tied athletes' number of victories. If this number is the same for the athletes in question, the number of second places is compared, and so on. If a tie cannot be broken by this procedure, it remains a tie."

        "title": "Duluth City Public Links Golf Tournament",
        "text": "The Duluth City Public Links Golf Tournament (often shortened to Duluth Publinx) was conducted from 1927 to 1962 and determined annually the public course golf champion of Duluth, Minnesota. Being a municipal event, the tournament was held at either city-owned Enger Park Golf Course or Lester Park Golf Course. Like the U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship and the Minnesota State Public Links Championship, the Duluth Publinx was closed to golfers with playing privileges at a golf club not open to the general public.\nThe first Duluth Publinx tournament was held over Labor Day weekend in September 1927 at Enger Park Golf Course and sponsored by the Duluth Municipal Amateur Athletic Association. Enger had opened just weeks earlier on July 2 and was at the time a nine-hole course. Against 21 other competitors, Oscar Erickson was the first winner of the tournament shooting rounds of 87 and 86 for a total score of 173 over 36 holes. Fourteen year-old Bobby Campbell finished in fifth place. By 1931, Campbell was one of the best golfers in the state winning two Minnesota state amateur titles among his many tournament wins during the 1930s before quitting the game at the start of World War II. Newspaper accounts do not reflect on the details behind the high scores shot during the tournament (Erickson was a Minnesota State Amateur Championship contender in 1930) but one can speculate that the course was probably still immature with construction having begun just a year before. Oscar Erickson would not defend his title in 1928 having joined the private Ridgeview County Club and becoming ineligible to compete.\nWally Johnson became the first to capture the Duluth Public Links title three times. With his third win, Johnson was awarded permanent possession of the original loving cup trophy. Months after his 1941 Duluth Publinx victory, Johnson joined the U.S. Air Corps after Pearl Harbor and was killed in action at the age of 27 in June 1943 in the Pacific Theater. The Duluth News-Tribune and the Duluth Herald sponsored a replacement trophy for the tournament which was retired in 1952 after Bob Braff had won the tournament for a third time. In 1958, Glenn Wicklund equaled the feat and retired that trophy by capturing his third Public Links title.\nThe Duluth City Public Links Golf Tournament was considered for many years one of the more prestigious tournaments for Duluth-area golfers. However, by the late fifties, the tournament had seen lagging interest. In response, a major change was introduced which allowed golfers with membership at a private club to compete for the Public Links title. The immediate result was an increase in participation with Dave Vosika of Ridgeview Country Club and Leo Spooner of Northland Country Club winning titles from 1960 to 1962. But, with the inclusion of private course golfers, the tournament distinctiveness was lost and the title of public course champion was not quite accurate.\nIn 1963, North Lakes Golf Association (NLGA) officials decided to merge the Duluth City Public Links and the Duluth All-City Golf Tournament into one large event to be known as the All-City Championships. NLGA officials hoped that one big tournament open to all golfers regardless of club membership or skill would stimulate public interest and renew participant interest. The All-City Championships were never held; the NLGA never got it organized. The Duluth All-City Golf Tournament lingered on for another year. However, the Duluth City Public Links Golf Tournament was abandoned after a 36 year-run and, with its demise, ended the oldest and longest running consecutively-held golf tournament in the city of Duluth at the time."

It was the location for Swimming at the 1920 Summer Olympics. In 1951, a new outdoor swimming pool was opened and used for years before work on the indoor swimming pool started in the 1970s. The new swimming pool was opened in 1973.\nFrom September 2014 to September 2015, a second Olympic pool was built at 8 m from the existing pool, Wezenberg 2, with six swimming lanes that will not be open to the public, but will be used as a training pool for top athletes. This pool will be expanded with a equipment for image and time registration. Wezenberg 2 is 50.025 m long, 16 meters wide and 2.2 m deep.

The scoring title was originally determined by total points scored through the 1996 season, after which points per game was used to determine the leader instead. Players who earned scoring titles before the 1984 season did not record any three-point field goals because the three-point line had just been implemented in the NBL at the start of that season.\nAndrew Gaze has won the most scoring titles, with 14. He also holds the all-time records for total points scored (1,007; 1991) and points per game (44.1; 1987) in a season. Between 1986 and 2001, Gaze was the leader in either total points or points per game every season. While he led the NBL in points per game in 1987 (44.1) and 1990 (37.6), he was not the leader in total points scored. His 882 total points in 1987 were third best behind Paul Stanley (920) and James Crawford (903), while his 828 points in 1990 were also third best behind Derek Rucker (865) and Wayne McDaniel (848)."

Members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) burst into a darts club frequented by Catholics and opened fire on the crowd, killing three civilians and wounding a fourth. The attack is one of many that has been linked to the Glenanne gang.\nAttack.\nThe 'Bleary Darts Club' was frequented mainly by Catholics but was also visited by Protestants. On the night of 27 April 1975, there were about thirty men inside. At about 10:40pm, three masked loyalist gunmen kicked the door open and opened fire on the crowd with a Sterling submachine gun, a Webley Revolver and a shotgun. When the burst of gunfire stopped, a customer switched the lights off so the gunmen could not see. There was then another burst of gunfire, followed by several single shots. Another customer kicked the door shut, and the gunmen left. Three men were killed, all Catholic civilians: father-of eight John Feeney (45), father-of-six Joseph Toman (48), and father-of-four Brendan O'Hara (38). A fourth man, a Protestant, was seriously wounded.\nPerpetrators.\nThe attack was claimed by the \"Protestant Action Force\", a cover name used by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group. It is believed the attackers were part of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. Six days before the attack at Bleary, the group had claimed responsibility for killing three Catholic civilians—two brothers and their pregnant sister—in a booby-trap bomb attack at a house near Granville, County Tyrone.\nLoyalists Stuart Ashtown and Derek McFarland admitted to the attack in 1980 along with a string of other offenses, including the shooting of Catholic civilians Marian Rafferty and Thomas Mitchell.\nThe shooting is one of many in the area that has been linked to the Glenanne gang; a group of loyalists that included police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and soldiers from the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). The sub-machine gun was used in the Miami Showband massacre, which was carried out by members of the group three months later. Circumstantial evidence links Robin Jackson to the attack. Among other evidence, a witness saw him in a car near the club the Sunday before the attack, and saw the same car near the club again, about half an hour before the attack."

Every athlete's leg is skied over three laps for a total of , with two shooting rounds: one prone and one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually from the spare round holders or from bullets deposited by the athlete into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still standing targets, one penalty loop must be taken for each remaining target. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five)."

        "text": "Tim Dwyer is an American former basketball player and coach. During his career, he starred in Iceland where he was a three-time Úrvalsdeild Foreign Player of the Year and led Valur to both the national championship and the Icelandic Cup in 1980 and 1983.\nCollege career.\nDwyer played for Monte Vista High School in Whittier, California, then junior college basketball for Rio Hondo College, where he averaged 19 points and 10 rebounds per game in his sophomore season. He then played Division I college basketball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans men's basketball team from 1974 to 1976. In 49 games, he averaged 11.0 points and 6.8 rebounds per game.\nProfessional career.\nIn September 1978, Dwyer joined Úrvalsdeild karla club Valur as player-coach, replacing recently departed Rick Hockenos. He debuted with the team in the annual Reykjavík Basketball Tournament where he scored 19 points in Valur's 100–84 victory against Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur. On October 10, he guided Valur to victory in the tournament, scoring 18 points in Valur's victory against Fram.\nIn his Úrvalsdeild debut on 14 October, Dwyer scored 19 points in a 101–89 victory against Þór Akureyri. On 12 March 1979, Dwyer scored a season high 44 points in a victory against arch rivals KR. Valur lost out on the national title after losing to KR, 77–75, in the last game of the season. Following the season, where he averaged 27.3 points per game in 19 games, he was named the Úrvalsdeild Foreign Player of the Year.\nAfter some uncertainty of his return due to his financial demands, Dwyer eventually resigned with Valur prior to the 1979–80 season. On 17 March 1980, he helped Valur to its first national championship after scoring 28 points in the team's 100–93 victory against defending champions KR in the last game of the season. In 20 games, he averaged 29.4 points, finishing second in scoring in the league behind Trent Smock's 34.6 points per game. In the Icelandic Cup, he helped Valur to the Cup Finals by scoring 55 points against Njarðvík in the semi-final. Valur won the hard fought game, 105–103, after Kristján Ágústsson scored the game winning basket from just inside center court with 2 seconds left of the game. On 19 March, he scored 28 points in Valur's cup finals win against ÍS. After the season he was named the foreign player of the year for the second consecutive season.\nAfter two seasons with Valur, Dwyer signed on in France as a player-coach before returning to his home state of California.\nIn July 1982, Dwyer returned to Valur as a player-coach prior to the 1982–83 season which he announced would be his last. In September, he led Valur to the pre-season Reykjavík Basketball Tournament title, scoring 22 points in Valur's 84–77 victory against Fram. On 21 March 1983, he led Valur to its second national championship after scoring 16 points in Valur's 88–87 victory against second-placed Keflavík. The game had a controversial ending after the referee Sigurður Valur Halldórsson called a three second violation on Keflavík's Brad Miley as he went up for a shot where Dwyer apparently fouled him with few seconds remaining of the game. Three days later, on 24 March, Dwyer scored 9 points but fouled out in the beginning of the second half of Valur's 78–75 victory against ÍR in the Icelandic cup finals. After the season he was named the Úrvalsdeild Foreign Player of the Year for the third time in his career. For the season, he finished fourth in scoring, averaging 23.6 points per game.\nCoaching career.\nIn his three seasons with Valur, he finished with a 45–15 record. In February 1979, Dwyer was hired as the head coach of the Icelandic men's national basketball team ahead of its games against Scotland and Denmark. In his 4 games with the team, he led it twice to victory."

Every athlete's leg is skied over three laps for a total of , with two shooting rounds: one prone and one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually from the spare round holders or from bullets deposited by the athlete into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still standing targets, one penalty loop must be taken for each remaining target. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five)."

The event was open to men and women.\nBackground.\nThe 1956 Olympics created some serious changes for the dressage competition at the 1960 Games. The previous Games had resulted in a serious judging scandal after the German and Swedish judges favored their own countrymen. These two judges were subsequently suspended by the FEI. Following this controversy, the IOC threatened to remove dressage from the Olympics, but the FEI managed to come to a compromise, removing the team competition from the 1960 Games and only allowing individual competitors (up to 2 per country). Additionally, 3 of the judges had to be from non-participating countries, and ride-offs were filmed and reviewed for a day before the final results were announced publicly.\nThe other major change was in the scoring scale, which moved from a scale of 0–6 to 0–10.\n17 riders competed, from 10 nations. Despite the small number of riders, the competition still took a long time as the judges, conscious of not playing favoritism, conferred for up to 20 minutes following each ride. 5 riders total qualified for the ride-off (2 from the Soviet Union, and 1 each from Switzerland, Germany, and Sweden). The ride-off was filmed and reviewed, the judging panel decided not to change the original placings, and the results were announced to the public 3 days following the ride.\nCompetition format.\nThree judges gave scores. Each judge gave a score between 0 and 10 for each test. The competition was held over two rounds; the top 5 horse and rider pairs in the first round advanced to the second round. The total score for both rounds determined final ranking.\nResults.\n17 riders competed."

Officially sanctioned by Sudamérica Rugby, which is consequently part of World Rugby, the league was officially launched in November 29, 2019.\nAt the official announcement, SLAR confirmed the number of the teams for the 2020 season was set at five for the regular season due to the economic issues but SLAR\nwas expected to be expanded at some point in the future, possibly in 2021. Cafeteros Pro (Colombia) joined at the end of the regular season to play a home and away series against the 5th-place finisher in the 2020 season before joining the league full-time.\nThe tournament could be played without problems in 2021 and 2022. During 2022, there were already ideas to carry out a joint competition between the franchises that contested the SLAR and teams from North America. During the season, the Challenge Cup of the Americas, a friendly rugby cup, was played on an experimental way.\nSRA (since 2023).\nAs it is a competition with franchises, the impact of the SLAR was in doubt. According to South American specialists, the success achieved by the tournament was relative but after various requests from institutions to join and participate in a larger tournament, World Rugby requested the expansion of the format towards a more ambitious and regional competition.\nOnce the news was released, Wenceslao Tejerina, High Performance Manager for Chile, announced that they were working on a new tournament. After the announcement of the new contest, the Uruguayan Sebastián Piñeyrúa, director of the South American entity, issued the following statement: \"Due to the success obtained in the American Rugby Super League in the two full seasons of 2021 and 2022, from South America Rugby, SLAR organizers, we are in the middle of negotiations with national unions in North and Central America, to plan the future growth of Rugby in the continent, for this reason, we are working with all the member unions and franchises participating in SLAR 2022, to plan and develop future competitions, by franchises and international. On October 27, the format will be presented and details of the new professional competition of the Americas will be given\".\nIn this way, after efforts by Sudamérica Rugby and World Rugby, the emergence of \"Super Rugby Americas\" was announced in October 2022, a tournament that will also be organized by USA Rugby and Rugby Canada, which will include most of the clubs that competed in SLAR 2022 with the addition of franchises from the United States and Canada.\nAccording to the High Performance Manager of South America Rugby, Daniel Hourcade, the Unión Argentina de Rugby will also incorporate more franchises in the next editions of the new league.\nCompetition format.\nIn 2020, Superliga Americana de Rugby was to span four months from February through May. For the first season, five of the six clubs Ceibos, Corinthians, Selknam, Olímpia Lions, and Peñarol planned to take part in a double round-robin regular season, playing twice against each other team, once at home and once away, for a total of eight games. The top four teams would qualify for the championship playoffs to determine a season champion. The fifth place regular season team would have played a series against Los Cafeteros Pro to determine the fifth-place team. However, on March 17, 2020, the season was postponed until 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLike Super Rugby, Major League Rugby, and the United Rugby Championship, the Super Rugby Americas has no promotion and relegation.\nTeams.\nCurrent teams.\nThere are seven teams confirmed for the 2023 Super Rugby Americas season.\nExpansion teams.\nOn 10 November 2020, Colombia formalized professional rugby. The South American nation’s first professional rugby team was Cafeteros Pro. The team entered the Súper Liga Americana de Rugby (SLAR) in 2021.\nOn 6 January 2021, UAR replaced the Córdoba based team Ceibos with the Jaguares XV, following the Jaguares' departure from Super Rugby.\nOn 4 February 2021, the Brazilian side in the competition was renamed Cobras Brasil XV, dropping their affiliation with the Corinthians multi-sport club.\nOn 13 December 2022, SLAR confirmed the replacement of Cafeteros Pro, with the reintroduction of Córdoba based team \"Dogos XV\", in the past Ceibos.\nOn 22 December 2022, Super Rugby Americas confirmed more news; first the return of Argentine Pampas XV in substitution of Jaguares XV, second the participation of American Raptors, third the rebranded of Paraguayan team from Olimpia Lions to Yakarés XV in order to indicate that relationship between the Paraguayan Rugby Union and the soccer team Club Olimpia is ended.\nExpansion candidates.\nAt the initial announcement, Brazil and Uruguay were originally slated to have two team each, but instead one team each (Corinthians and Peñarol) went on to play in the 2020 season, meaning it may be possible for the two countries to expand in the future (Club Nacional de Football was hinted at as a possibility in Uruguay) besides a possible Mexican team or a second Chilean team. With the possible change of Super Rugby to a Trans-Tasman (Australasian) competition, Argentina could add a second team, the Jaguares, based in Buenos Aires, in 2021. In November 2020, another new team was proposed for 2021, with Sudamérica Rugby officially expressing interest in the inclusion of a second Argentine Buenos Aires–based team in the 2021 SLAR. However, a second Argentine team did not play in 2021 and most Argentine players would leave the team either for overseas, or to enter the draft for the 2021 Súper Liga Americana de Rugby season.\nIn October 2022, it was confirmed that the Argentine team Tucumán would replace the Colombian team Cafeteros Pro and that two North American franchises, the Canadian Pacific Pride and U.S. American Raptors, were going to participate in this new tournament renamed Super Rugby Americas.\nIn June 2023, after losing its bid for 2022, Tucumán, plus Salta and Santiago del Estero, renewed their request to enter in the tournament in order to have 3 Argentine franchises in the future. Los Naranjas could thus be a new team in Super Rugby Americas 2025.\nIt's also possible in the future a Mexican Franchise"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bears represent Baylor University in the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference.\nBaylor began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1907. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA has recorded scoring statistics throughout the \"modern era\" of basketball, which it defines as starting with the 1937–38 season, the first after the center jump after each made field goal was abolished. Individual rebounding was first recorded in 1950–51, as were individual assists. While rebounding has been recorded in every subsequent season, the NCAA stopped recording individual assists after the 1951–52 season. Assists were not reinstated as an official statistic in Division I until the 1983–84 season. Blocks and steals were first recorded in D-I in 1988–89. Baylor's record books include players in all named statistics, regardless of whether they were officially recorded by the NCAA or any other national governing body.\nThese lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "Bowling Green Offices Building",
        "text": "The Bowling Green Offices Building (also known as the Bowling Green Building, Bowling Green Offices, or 11 Broadway) is an office building located at 11 Broadway, across from Bowling Green park in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City. The 21-story building, erected between 1895 and 1898, is tall.\nThe Bowling Green Offices Building was built to a Hellenic Renaissance-style design by W. &amp; G. Audsley. The building's articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column—namely a base, shaft, and capital—and has a facade of granite at its base and white brick on the upper stories. The building contains an interior skeleton of structural steel, several ornamental features on the facade, as well as a floor plan that maximizes natural light exposure.\nThe Bowling Green Offices Building, erected as a 16-story structure, initially hosted various steamship offices due to Bowling Green's proximity to the New York Harbor, and later hosted law firms and other companies. The Broadway Realty Company, for whom the building was built, owned 11 Broadway for several decades following its completion. Five additional stories were built in 1920–1921. In 1995, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated 11 Broadway as an official city landmark. It is also a contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places district created in 2007.\nDescription.\nThe Bowling Green Offices Building was designed by W. &amp; G. Audsley. It is bounded by 1 Broadway to the south, Broadway to the east, Greenwich Street to the west, and the Cunard Building (25 Broadway) to the north. Its alternate addresses are 5-11 Broadway and 5-11 Greenwich Street. The building has a frontage of on Broadway and on Greenwich Street; the southern boundary of its lot is long and the northern boundary long.\nForm.\nThe original structure was 16 stories and was expanded to 21 stories in 1917. These consisted of a full seventeenth story that covered nearly the entire lot, as well as an additional four stories that comprised a smaller tower above the center north section of the lot. This tower has a facade of buff-colored brick and terracotta, with a mansard roof made of copper. There was a penthouse apartment for its resident superintendent.\nThe building is U-shaped, with the two wings on Broadway and Greenwich Streets surrounding a southward-facing light court. The court abuts a north-facing court within the International Mercantile Marine Company Building, which is also U-shaped. The light court measures from north to south and from west to east, and is present above the first floor.\nFacade.\nThe western and eastern facades of the Bowling Green Offices Building are arranged in three sections, consisting of a three-story \"base\", a \"shaft\", and a three-story \"capital\" on top, similar to the components of a column. This was a common setup for facades of buildings that were being erected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Bowling Green Offices Building's facade is made of white granite—an influence from Neoclassical architecture—as well as white brick and terracotta. The facade consists of thirteen vertical bays on Broadway and fourteen on Greenwich Street. The bays are separated by slightly projecting piers, and each floor is separated by slightly recessed horizontal spandrels, creating a grid of windows. The southern facade of the Bowling Green Offices Building is visible above the International Mercantile Marine Company to the south.\nUnlike other buildings of that era, which used arcades as a method of articulation for the base, the Bowling Green Offices Building uses anthemia and other Hellenic-style ornamentation, similar to Milwaukee's Layton Art Gallery building and St. Louis's Wainwright Building. The Bowling Green Offices Building greatly resembles the Wainwright Building, except for the colors of the facades. The building is estimated to have over a hundred anthemia on its facade. The \"Real Estate Record and Guide\" said in 1897 that the Bowling Green Offices Building had \"more anthemia than any other work with which we are acquainted\". Despite this, the Bowling Green Offices Building's facade has a very little other ornamentation, and the Hellenic ornament is confined to the lower three stories. Audsley wrote that he believed \"sculpture should be within easy range of the eye [...] and used sparely in the high portions\".\nBroadway.\nThe east-facing Broadway facade is 13 bays wide and 17 stories high and is the building's principal elevation. From the bottom to the top, this elevation consists of a two-story base, a twelve-story shaft, a two-story capital, and a top story that was added during 1920–1921.\nThe base is made of a white-granite colonnade above a gray-granite water table. The pilasters of the colonnade are carved with decorations such as anthemia and support a detailed entablature with the carved words ; behind the colonnade can be seen small segments of rusticated wall. The center bay contains a stoop made of gray granite. The outermost three architectural bays comprise slightly projecting pavilions, and there are detailed entrance surrounds around the first-floor openings of the pavilions. The base also contains bronze door and window openings on the first story and aluminum-framed sash windows on the second stories. There are cornices above the second and third stories.\nThe third story serves as a \"transition\" story; the center seven bays feature half-columns and the outer six bays feature rectangular piers. The following eleven stories contain unadorned vertical piers and horizontal molded spandrels above each story. The window openings are framed by short sections of rusticated wall. The tops of the 13th and 14th stories also contain cornices.\nThe 15th and 16th stories contain vertical piers that correspond to the design of the base, as well as aluminum-framed sash windows. The top of the 16th story contains a large cornice with a carved frieze. The 17th story has a facade of buff brick, window openings with double-hung windows, and a cornice of brick and white terracotta.\nOther facades.\nThe west-facing Greenwich Street facade, similar to the Broadway facade, is divided into an elaborate base, a simple shaft, and a more detailed capital topped by the brick-faced 17th story. It contains less elaborate features than the Broadway facade: for instance, there are no projecting pavilions flanking this side. The Greenwich Street facade is 18 stories high, with a full basement faced with brick and granite, since it is at a lower terrain elevation than Broadway. There is a double-width entrance portico on the northern part of the facade, as well as a freight entrance nearby; both contain carved overhead plaques above. Unlike on the Broadway side, the vertical piers are faced with brick. The 15th and 16th stories contain an oriel window, and the 17th story is a mansard roof made of copper.\nThe south facade is broken up into western and eastern wings. Both sections are mostly blocked by 1 Broadway, and only the 13th through 17th stories are visible. The 13th through 16th stories consist of a white wall while the 17th story is a buff brick wall.\nThe north facade is mostly blocked by the Cunard Building; the visible section consists of a brick wall with windows. It is topped by a four-story tower, which is visible from the building's other three sides.\nFeatures.\nThe Bowling Green Offices Building contains a steel skeleton, with steel columns placed inside alternating vertical piers. The structure used over of steel. The building's firefighting system used standpipes and compressed-air drums, rather than the water towers used on many contemporary buildings. The standpipes could maintain a pressure of , which would allow of water per minute to be projected in a stream. The firefighting system, which could also feed water to fire engines if necessary, was praised by the New York City Fire Commissioner.\nThe entrance foyer and main corridor contain a marble floor, while a stained-glass mural dating from the building's construction is mounted on the walls of the corridor. When built, the Bowling Green Offices Building included 16 elevators. Of these, eight were clustered in the lobby in the northern portion of the building. Another elevator on the Greenwich Street side could be used by freight or passengers and could support loads of up to .\nHistory.\nThe site of the Bowling Green Offices Building was occupied by Dutch houses after the colony of New Amsterdam was founded in the 17th century. The Atlantic Garden House (Burns' Coffee House) had previously occupied the site of 11 Broadway by the 19th century, and had occupied the site since at least the 18th century. Later, one of the New York and Harlem Railroad's freight depots was located at the site.\nConstruction.\nThe Bowling Green Offices Building's site was owned by lawyer Joseph F. Stier, who sold the land in June 1895 to Stacy C. Richmond. The next month, the then-new Broadway Realty Company submitted plans for the site to the New York City Department of Buildings. The company was led by five men and had a board of directors that included Stier and Richmond, as well as philanthropist Spencer Trask, who, being the largest stakeholder in the building, would maintain a suite on the top floor for several years.\nThe precise details of how Audsley became involved in the project is not clear, though he may have been hired through association with George Foster Peabody, who was Trask's principal partner. Records from McKim, Mead &amp; White allude to the possibility that an architectural competition may have been organized. Construction of the original structure, which was 16 stories and cost $1.8 million, started in October 1895. The building was completed in two sections: the Broadway side was ready for use in mid-1896, while the rest of the building was completed in November 1898. According to one source, the Bowling Green Offices Building was built \"by British interests\" with funding from Queen Victoria. Original plans called for a tower to be built atop the rest of the building, but the tower plans were not carried out.\nUse.\nEarly tenants.\nAt the time of its opening, the Bowling Green Offices Building was the largest building on Bowling Green. A promotional brochure for the Bowling Green Offices Building advertised its fireproof material; electricity; proximity to the Ninth Avenue elevated and the then-under-construction subway; and elevators to the restaurant and apartments on the upper floors. Electricity, heating, and janitor service were given to potential tenants for free. A 1900 issue of the \"Real Estate Record and Guide\" quoted the elevators as carrying 18,000 people per day, while the building had an average of 6,000 people during peak work hours. Profits from the Bowling Green Offices Building went toward funding Yaddo, the artists' community in Saratoga Springs, New York, that had been founded by Trask.\nThe Broadway Realty Company filed a lawsuit after the New York City Department of Taxes raised the building's valuation from $1.5 million in 1898 to $2 million in 1899. The Department of Taxes ruled that the assessment was justified, but the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court overruled the decision. In 1903, the \"New-York Tribune\" reported that, when Trask's automobile driver was arrested, Trask had offered the $1 million Bowling Green Offices Building to cover his driver's $500 bail amount. During the 1910s, there were two incidents involving elevators at 11 Broadway. In 1915, seven elevators dropped down their shafts with a combined 30 people in the cabs, though no one was hurt because of safety systems that slowed down the elevators at the bottom. The next year, a man was hurt when four elevator cabs dropped.\nExpansion and later use.\nLudlow and Peabody made numerous major modifications in the early 20th century. The firm redesigned the staircases on the Broadway side in 1912–1913 by moving the front steps inward and removing or reconfiguring part of the facade. A few years later, the Broadway Realty Company planned to add five more stories at the top of the building to designs by Ludlow and Peabody, but due to steel shortages caused by World War I, the work was not completed until 1919–1920. Building plans in 1938 indicate there was a restaurant, likely facing Greenwich Street, and a photo from the same year indicated that storefronts had been added on Broadway to either side of the center stoop.\nThe building was sold to Chester W. Hansen's real-estate syndicate in 1926 as part of a $9 million transaction. This was the first ownership change since the building's opening. However, the LPC stated that Broadway Realty continued to own the building until 1978, or at least the land beneath it, citing the company's Restatement of Certificate of Incorporation filed that year. According to a former director of Yaddo, the community held the controlling interest in the Bowling Green Offices Building until 1976, as opposed to outright ownership. By the 1930s, fewer tenants were occupying the Bowling Green Offices Building because of the construction of new office buildings in Midtown Manhattan.\nIn 1995, the Bowling Green Offices Building and several other buildings on Bowling Green were formally designated as New York City landmarks. In 2007, the building was designated as a contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places district. , 11 Broadway is owned by Braun Management.\nTenants.\nThe Bowling Green Offices Building's previous tenants have included bankers, lawyers, utility companies, engineers, naval architects, and ship companies. As originally built, it included 512 offices. These were used by several companies involved in the steamship and shipping industries, such as steamship lines, shipbuilders, ship suppliers, and freight forwarders. The steamship companies included the White Star Line, which owned the ; the American Line; and the American Scantic Line. Additionally, the Shipping and Industrial Sound Money Association of the Port of New York opened offices in the building in 1900, and the Erie Railroad also had offices in the building in the early 20th century. Other tenants included the United States Department of the Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, as well as the Merchant Marine Committee of the Whole.\nBy 1926, tenants included Tidewater Oil, industrial company Ingersoll-Rand, bankers Henry Clews &amp; Company, lawyer Max Steuer, and steamship line Moore-McCormack. Later in the 20th century, space in the Bowling Green Offices Building was taken up by Ivan Boesky, a stock trader implicated in insider trading, as well as the technology company IBM.\nIn the 21st century, tenants include or have included Hill West Architects, SogoTrade, the Flatiron School, Allmenus, and Universal Studios. The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles has an office on the 11 Greenwich Street side of the building.\nCritical reception.\nThe Bowling Green Offices Building received relatively little media coverage upon its completion. Although architectural writers Sarah Landau and Carl Condit wrote in 1996 that the Bowling Green Offices was \"a major work of the [1890s] in both design and size\", it was ignored \"perhaps because it was completed in a boom building period or because its 'Hellenic Renaissance' style was considered so peculiar\".\nA writer for the \"Real Estate Record and Guide\" lambasted the design, saying that it \"is quite too conspicuous to be ignored\". The reviewer continued: \"If the architects had been less solicitous for novelty and had abstained from trying to produce 'an order practically unique', their building would have been much better\". Another critic said that the design had been intended to \"boldly admit and even [...] accentuate height\". A 1998 letter to the editor, published in \"The New York Times\", said that 11 Broadway's design was \"for those who wish to enjoy the architecture of\" Scottish architect Alexander Thomson. The letter described 11 Broadway's base as \"a literal copy\" of Thomson's designs."

        "title": "1908 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1908 season for Auckland consisted of four representative matches played in an effort to grow the game in Auckland and New Zealand. The team was chosen prior to the formation of the Auckland Rugby League so were an ‘unofficial’ Auckland team though they were very strong nonetheless and many of the players went on to represent Auckland and New Zealand in the ensuing years. Several of the players were also strongly involved in the establishment of club sides and the growth of the game in Auckland for many years to come such as Albert Asher, Charles Dunning, William Wynyard, and Ronald MacDonald.\n \n \nThe games.\nThe four matches were against Wellington and Taranaki with games being played in Auckland, Wellington and New Plymouth. They resulted in 3 wins and a draw.\nPrior to the last match of the season against Taranaki at Victoria Park the promoters of the proposed Auckland League stated clearly their intentions. They said that it was not their intention to pay players for home matches. If any profits accrued from their last match it would be “banked to form the nucleus of a ground fund. It will be the policy of the league to provide players with uniforms, free brake trips to grounds, and payment for loss of wages when away from Auckland on tour”. They went on to say that the tour had not been profitable. The money they had gained from Wellington's visit in August had been lost while on tour due to travel costs and other expenditure. They hoped to “stimulate a strong local competitions next season” and had secured a ground at Epsom for play.\nRepresentative matches.\nAuckland v Wellington.\nThe first ever match played by an Auckland side was between them and Wellington at Victoria Park in central Auckland. The Auckland Rugby League had not officially formed at this point with the sport very much in its infancy in New Zealand. The match featured 19 players out of the 26 who were current or future New Zealand representatives. Bill Tyler scored the first ever points for Auckland with a goal from a mark which had been taken by Harold Rowe. Tyler's kicking was crucial in Auckland's win with a conversion, 2 penalties, and 2 goals from marks. Rowe scored the first ever try for Auckland to give them a 5–3 lead after Conrad Byrne had scored for Wellington earlier to give them their first ever points.\nAuckland v Taranaki.\nThis match was originally supposed to be played on the recreation ground but after pressure from the rugby union it was moved to the Tukapa Cricket Field adjacent to Western Park. There were further issues with seating as the advertised seats for spectators did not arrive at the ground. Taranaki won the match by 5 points to 3 and it was suggested that Auckland had deliberately thrown the match to stir up interest in the return match. Though the closeness of the game back in Auckland would suggest this might not have been the case.\nAuckland v Taranaki.\nAuckland won narrowly, outscoring Taranaki by 5 tries to 4 before a crowd of 3,000 at Victoria Park. For Taranaki Arthur Hardgrave kicked 3 goals. Hardgrave played 5 matches for Taranaki, 11 for Auckland, and 8 for New Zealand. He transferred to Auckland in 1912 and joined the Manukau club. He later played for the North Shore Albions in 1913, the Ōtāhuhu Rovers from 1914 to 1916, and Ponsonby United from 1917 to 1920. His son Roy Hardgrave was a New Zealand and Auckland representative and played for Newton Rangers, and Mount Albert, as well as professionally for St Helens, York, and Toulouse. Kiwi, Richard Wynyard scored for Auckland. His brother William Wynyard also represented New Zealand in their 1907-08 tour. Tragically Richard committed suicide in 1915 after becoming depressed at not being able to find work in his profession as a clerk. Samuel Houghton also made his Auckland debut. He had migrated to New Zealand with his family, including Thomas Houghton who played for New Zealand in 1909. Samuel would referee the Auckland Province v Wellington game in 1909 and would also become the Auckland Rugby League secretary. "

        "title": "AEW Double or Nothing",
        "text": "AEW Double or Nothing is a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). Established in 2019, it is held annually in May during Memorial Day weekend. The inaugural Double or Nothing was also the very first PPV as well as the very first event produced by AEW and is thus considered the promotion's marquee domestic event. It is also considered one of the \"Big Four\" PPVs for AEW, along with All Out, Full Gear, and Revolution, the company's four biggest domestic shows produced quarterly.\nThe name Double or Nothing was originally referenced in a promo that Cody Rhodes made immediately after the September 2018 All In event, which was an independently produced PPV that came as a result of a bet with wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer. Rhodes, a key figure behind All In who would become a co-founder and wrestler for AEW from 2019 to 2022, said \"I know when you make a bet, sometimes you go \"double or nothing\"\"—AEW was then founded in January 2019 with Double or Nothing as its first event that May. The name is also a reference to its Las Vegas theme, with the event traditionally held at arenas on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. The only exceptions to this were the 2020 and 2021 events, which were originally scheduled for Vegas but had to be held at Daily's Place in Jacksonville, Florida due to the COVID-19 pandemic—after Florida loosened its COVID-19 protocols, the 2021 event was AEW's first PPV to have a full capacity crowd, as well as the final PPV held at Daily's Place before AEW resumed live touring in July that year.\nSince the 2020 event, Double or Nothing has featured a specialized tornado tag team match between two multi-man teams as one of its marquee matches, oftentimes the main event. For 2020 and 2021, this was the Stadium Stampede match. To capitalize on the rise of cinematic matches during the pandemic, both year's events were headlined by the Stadium Stampede match, which was contested in both Daily's Place and the adjacent TIAA Bank Field stadium. With the return to Las Vegas beginning with the 2022 event, Stadium Stampede was replaced by Anarchy in the Arena with the wrestlers fighting all throughout the host venue.\nHistory.\nAfter the success of the September 2018 All In event, an independent professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event that came as a result of a bet with wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, a group known as The Elite (Cody, The Young Bucks, and Kenny Omega), the driving forces behind the event, used the positive response from All In to pursue further events with backing of businessmen Shahid Khan and Tony Khan. In a promo after All In, Cody said \"I know when you make a bet, sometimes you go \"double or nothing\"\". On November 5, 2018, several trademarks were filed in Jacksonville, Florida, among them were \"All Elite Wrestling\" and \"Double or Nothing\", leading to speculation of the formation of a professional wrestling promotion and the name of its first event.\nOn January 1, 2019, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) was officially founded. Along with the announcement, the promotion's inaugural event, Double or Nothing, was scheduled to air on PPV during Memorial Day weekend on May 25, 2019, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, with the event taking on a Las Vegas theme. Double or Nothing would become considered AEW's marquee domestic event, with AEW president Tony Khan later referring to the event as being one of the promotion's \"big four\" PPVs, their four biggest shows domestic of the year produced quarterly, along with All Out, Full Gear, and Revolution.\nWhile AEW had planned to again host the 2020 event at the same location on May 23 that year, the venue canceled all events up through May 31 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the promotion announced that the 2020 event would still proceed as planned (which occurred at Daily's Place and the TIAA Bank Field stadium in Jacksonville, Florida), while also confirming that a third Double or Nothing would emanate from the MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 29, 2021. However, due to the ongoing pandemic, the 2021 event was again held at Daily's Place and was moved back a day to May 30. AEW resumed live touring in July, thus the 2021 Double or Nothing was the promotion's final PPV held at Daily's Place during the pandemic. It was also the company's first show to run at full venue capacity during the pandemic after Florida loosened its COVID-19 protocols.\nIn December 2021, it was confirmed that the 2022 Double or Nothing would return the event to Las Vegas, and it would be held at the T-Mobile Arena. It was also announced that the event would host the finals of the inaugural Owen Hart Cup. The 2023 event was also held at the same arena on May 28 that year. On March 27, 2024, it was announced that after five years, the 2024 event would return Double or Nothing to the MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 26 that year."

The Crimson Tide represent the University of Alabama in the NCAA's Southeastern Conference.\nAlabama began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1912. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Alabama's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

        "text": "The UT Arlington Mavericks women's wheelchair basketball team, commonly known as the Lady Movin' Mavs, is the women's college wheelchair basketball team representing the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). Established in 2013, the team plays under the auspices of the National Wheelchair Basketball Association (NWBA). It has been coached by Jason Nelms since its establishment.\nThe Lady Movin' Mavs have won two National Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball Tournament (NIWBT) national championships, in 2016 and 2018. Two of its players, Abby Dunkin and Rose Hollermann, have played for the United States Paralympic wheelchair basketball team. Two additional players of international note who have played for the Lady Movin' Mavs are Australian Annabelle Lindsay and Canadian Élodie Tessier.\nHistory.\nThe Lady Movin' Mavs were established in 2013. Jason Nelms was named its head coach. He previously played as a member of UTA's men's wheelchair basketball team, the Movin' Mavs, from 2000 to 2005 and also competed in three Paralympic Games. During its inaugural 2013–14 season, the team had no substitute players, instead playing all five of its players for the full 40 minutes of each game. The Lady Movin' Mavs played their first games against the University of Alabama and University of Illinois during a tournament in late October 2013. They also played in the National Wheelchair Basketball Association Tournament (NWBAT) in their first season, but were disqualified because one of their players fell sick before the tournament and the team could not field a five-player lineup. In April 2014, the team signed Rose Hollermann and Josie Aslakson in its first recruiting class.\nThe Lady Movin' Mavs were initially a sports club at UTA and transitioned to full intercollegiate team status once sufficient funds had been raised. It plays under the auspices of the National Wheelchair Basketball Association (NWBA), which organizes intercollegiate wheelchair basketball tournaments across the United States. During the 2014–15 season, the team's roster grew from five to nine players, which allowed the team greater flexibility with strategy and opportunities to rest players. That season, the team played in the National Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball Tournament (NIWBT), where it lost to the University of Illinois in its first game and then lost to the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater in the third-place game.\nDuring the 2015–16 season, just the third season in the team's existence, it won its first national championship by beating the University of Alabama and then the University of Illinois in the NIWBT. The Lady Movin' Mavs finished with a 19–5 record on the season. That summer, it also had its first two players make the United States Paralympic wheelchair basketball team roster for the 2016 Summer Paralympics: Abby Dunkin and Rose Hollermann.\nThe Lady Movin' Mavs finished the 2016–17 season with a 57–48 loss to the University of Alabama in the championship game of the NIWBT after they beat the University of Illinois 68–19 in their first-round game.\nDuring the 2017–18 season, the Lady Movin' Mavs recorded a perfect 20–0 season record. The team defeated the University of Alabama 65–55 in the NIWBT championship game to win its second national title. It was led by the play of veterans Dunkin, Hollermann, and Morgan Wood as well as Australian freshman Annabelle Lindsay.\nThe Lady Movin' Mavs finished the 2018–19 season with an 82–76 overtime loss to the University of Alabama in the championship game of the NIWBT. In 2019, the team added Canadian freshman Élodie Tessier to its roster.\nAs of 2019, the Lady Movin' Mavs are one of only five women's college wheelchair basketball teams in the country, along with the University of Alabama, the University of Arizona, the University of Illinois, and the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater.\nCoaches.\nJason Nelms has been the head coach of the Lady Movin' Mavs since the establishment of the team in 2013. He is a UTA alumnus and a former member of the Movin' Mavs men's wheelchair basketball team.\nSeason-by-season results.\n "

Australia had hoped to have both Martin and Loupos compete. The final rankings, however, put the United States as the #1-ranked nation. This meant that the United States was the only nation able to send two cyclists in the event; Australia, as the #2-ranked nation, could send only one. Further, Loupos was seriously injured during the 2021 World Championship less than two months before the Games, which would have kept him from competing in any case. Martin was selected as Australia's only men's BMX freestyle rider.\nThe United States selected Justin Dowell (2018 World Champion) and Nick Bruce (2019 bronze medalist); the Americans finished the 2021 World Championship with 3 cyclists in the top 5 places (Bruce 5th, Dowell 4th, and Daniel Sandoval taking silver).\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to 2 qualified cyclists in the BMX freestyle. Quota places are allocated to the NOC, which selects the cyclists. There were 9 quota places available, allocated as follows:\nCompetition format.\nThe competition is a two-round tournament, with a seeding round and a final. Each round has the cyclists all do two runs. The runs are 60 seconds long. Five judges give scores between 0.00 and 99.99 based on the difficulty and execution of the rider's run; the scores are averaged for a total run score. In the seeding round, the rider's two run scores are averaged to give a total seeding score. These seeding scores are used to determine the start order of the cyclists in the final, providing a knowledge advantage to the later riders. In the final, only the better score of the two runs counts.\nSchedule.\nThe event took place over two consecutive days.\nResults.\nSeeding.\nThe seeding phase determines the start order for the final.

        "text": "San Jose, California has various cycling routes on roads and trails used by both commuters and recreational riders. The city has plans to expand the current of bike lanes to , and the current of trails to . San Jose was ranked as a bronze-level bicycle-friendly community by the League of American Bicyclists.\nCity planning.\nBicycle planning in San Jose is handled by the city's Department of Transportation.\nSan Jose Bike Plan 2020.\nThe San Jose City Council passed the \"San Jose Bike Plan 2020\" in November 2009. It was a set of goals intended to be implemented by 2020 if possible, or otherwise make progress in those directions. The goals were as follows:\nCity officials traveled to Copenhagen in 2014 to observe how that city achieved 50% of trips by bicycle.\nThe San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR) reported from a panel discussion at an event they hosted in 2017 that the question came up why San Jose didn't see as much increase in cycling usage as expected after a round of bike lane construction. The panelists concluded that the unprotected bike lanes tend to only attract experienced riders. The panel said new less-experienced riders tend to want protected bike lanes before they will be attracted to ride more.\nSan Jose Better Bike Plan 2025.\nThe San Jose Better Bike Plan 2025 will supersede Bike Plan 2020. It has been in development since 2018. It is expected for release in early 2020.\nCounty-wide planning.\nCycling in the city of San Jose can't just be viewed in isolation because it is bordered by other cities within Santa Clara County. County-wide bicycle and pedestrian planning is done by the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) because it was formed by a merger of the county transit agency with the congestion management districts of the county and all the cities in the county.\nCycling infrastructure.\nThe city has plans to expand the current of bike lanes to , and the current of trails to .\nHellyer Park Velodrome is located in Hellyer County Park next to the Coyote Creek Trail. It was built in 1963. It served as the site of the 1972 US Olympic bicycling team tryouts. The velodrome was renovated in 2007. It is operated by the Northern California Velodrome Association, a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation.\nSan Jose International Airport has bicycle racks in both the Terminal A and B parking structures.\nBikes on transit.\nVTA buses have racks in front with capacity for 2 bikes. VTA light rail has 4 racks and room for 4 more cyclists holding their bicycles in each train car.\nBay Area Rapid Transit (BART), which is planned to open in San Jose at the Berryessa/North San Jose station and in Milpitas (next to the border of San Jose) at the Milpitas station in 2020, has rules for bicycles restricting using the first car at any time, the first 3 cars during commute hours, or any crowded car. Cyclists are also prohibited from using station escalators, and must instead use stairs or elevators.\nCaltrain normally runs 2 or 3 bike cars per train. Cyclists are required to use the bike cars. Caltrain does not allow bicycles to be locked on board.\nAmtrak California Capitol Corridor normally runs 2 bike cars per train. Other train cars have 3 bike racks on the lower level. Amtrak recommends locking bicycles to the racks.\nTrail network.\nThe off-street trail network in San Jose consists mostly of routes along waterways and highways.\nCommercial bicycle rental.\nBesides rentals available at bike shops, the City of San Jose has also permitted Bay Wheels (formerly known as Ford GoBike) to operate a bike sharing system in the city. , the bike sharing system does not have permits from any other city in the county.\nEvents and Organizations.\nVarious bicycling events and organizations in San Jose include social riding, commuting and bicycle advocacy.\nSan Jose Bike Party.\nSan Jose Bike Party has since 2007 done monthly rides on the 3rd Friday of the month, which can attract thousands of riders in Summer months. Bike Party is a social event, not a protest.\nSilicon Valley Bicycle Coalition.\nSilicon Valley Bicycle Coalition (SVBC) is a bicycle advocacy organization covering Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties.\nBike to Work Day.\nBay Area Bike to Work Day encourages commuters to try out cycling. \"Energizer Stations\" sponsored and operated by various local organizations or companies scattered along various commute routes hand out food, drinks and swag bags. In Santa Clara County, the local organizer of Bike to Work Day is SVBC.\nViva Calle San Jose.\nSince 2015 and now held each Spring and Fall, Viva Calle San Jose is a street festival where a pre-announced route of several miles of streets is temporarily closed for hours during the day to vehicle traffic and opened to pedestrians, bicycles, scooters, skateboards, etc."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2020 season began with the Wildcard Round on January 9, 2021, and concluded with Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, on February 7, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs 31–9. This marked the first time a team has played the Super Bowl at their home field, as the Buccaneers reached the title game after winning three playoff games on the road.\nThe league expanded its playoff system from a 12-team to a 14-team tournament, adding a third wild card team for each conference for the first time since the 2001 season, and only awarding each conference's division winner with the best record a first round bye. The Wild Card round was thus extended from two to three games per day.\nThe playoffs were played during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and each game's attendance was limited due to local health restrictions . Had a serious outbreak occurred during the regular season, the league had contingency plans to delay the postseason, eliminate the bye week before the Super Bowl and postpone the game itself to as late as February 28. NFL owners also approved an additional alternative plan to implement a 16-team playoff format, with no teams getting a bye, if \"meaningful\" regular season games were canceled because of the virus.\nThe Cleveland Browns and eventual Super Bowl champions Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who had not made it to the playoffs since 2002 and 2007, respectively, and thus held the two longest playoff appearance droughts in the league at the time, both qualified for the postseason in 2020, giving the New York Jets, who had not appeared since 2010, the longest active playoff appearance drought. Conversely, the New England Patriots missed the postseason for the first time since 2008, ending the longest playoff appearance streak in NFL history.\nWith the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens facing each other in the AFC Divisional playoffs, Buffalo became the third team in NFL history (joining the Los Angeles Rams and Philadelphia Eagles) and the first AFC team to face every team within their respective conference in the postseason at least once.\nSchedule.\nIn the event of a COVID-19 outbreak, the league stated playoff games or entire postseason rounds could be postponed, the bye week after the Conference Championships could be eliminated, and the Super Bowl could be moved up to three weeks later to February 28. None of these contingency plans were necessary.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 9, 2021.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 27, Indianapolis Colts 24.\nBuffalo built up a 24–10 second half lead and held off an Indianapolis fourth quarter rally to earn their first playoff win since the 1995 season.\nIn the first quarter, Colts quarterback Philip Rivers made completions to T. Y. Hilton and Michael Pittman Jr. for gains of 23 and 22 yards that set up the first score on a 30-yard field goal by Rodrigo Blankenship. Buffalo responded with an 8-play, 85-yard drive, featuring a 36-yard completion from Josh Allen to Stefon Diggs. Allen finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dawson Knox, giving the Bills a 7–3 lead with less than 2 minutes left in the quarter.\nOn a second quarter drive, Rivers completed a 32-yard pass to Pittman, while running back Jonathan Taylor caught a 6-yard pass and rushed four times for 17 yards, the last carry a 1-yard touchdown run to put the Colts up 10–7. Then after a punt, Indianapolis drove to a first and goal from the Bills 4-yard line; after a 2-yard pass and a 1-yard run, Taylor was tackled for a 3-yard loss by Tre'Davious White and Taron Johnson. Deciding to attempt a fourth-down conversion, Indianapolis turned the ball over as Rivers' pass to Pittman Jr. was incomplete. Taking the ball back with 1:46 left in the half, Allen completed passes to Gabe Davis for gains of 37 and 19 yards, while also picking up 16 yards on a scramble as he led the team 96 yards in 10 plays to score on a 5-yard touchdown run with 20 seconds left before halftime, giving Buffalo a 14–10 lead.\nBuffalo took the second half kickoff and drove 44 yards in 9 plays, with Allen completing two passes to Cole Beasley for 23 yards and a 16-yard pass to Diggs. Tyler Bass finished the possession with a 46-yard field goal, that increased the team's lead to 17–10. Indianapolis responded with a drive to the Bills' 15-yard line, only to have Blankenship miss a 33-yard field goal attempt. Buffalo then drove 77 yards in 9 plays to go up 24–10 on Allen's 35-yard touchdown completion to Diggs, with 14:17 left.\nOn the second play of the Colts' next possession, Nyheim Hines took off for a 29-yard run, and then Taylor rushed for 20 yards. The Colts were on the move and did not stop until Rivers finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Zach Pascal, making the score 24–16. After a Bills penalty moved the ball to the 1-yard line on the extra point attempt, the Colts decided to try a 2-point conversion. Linebacker Matt Milano broke up the play by getting through the line and dropping Taylor for a 1-yard loss. Buffalo then responded with a pair of 16-yard receptions by Diggs and Beasley that set up Bass' 54-yard field goal, increasing the Bills' lead to 27–16 with just over 8 minutes left. Faced with 3rd and 7 on their ensuing drive, the Colts fooled Buffalo's defense with a draw play, in which Hines took a delayed handoff and ran 33 yards to the Bills' 27-yard line. On the next play, Rivers completed a 27-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jack Doyle; Rivers threw the ball to Doyle again on a 2-point conversion, making the score 27–24.\nBuffalo took the ball back and drove to the Colts' 34-yard line, but Colts defensive end Denico Autry sacked Allen and forced a fumble. Bills offensive tackle Daryl Williams recovered the ball, but the team lost 18 yards and ended up having to punt with 2:38 left, giving the Colts a chance to drive for a winning or tying score. The Colts proceeded to drive to the Buffalo 46-yard line, converting two fourth downs along the way. On the second one, Pascal made a diving catch for 17 yards on fourth and 10, then appeared to fumble the ball as he got up, which Buffalo recovered. However, officials ruled him down by contact after making the catch, and this was upheld by replay review. Still, Buffalo's defense managed to hang on after this, forcing a 1-yard loss and two incompletions to set up a 4th down at the 47 yard line. Rivers flung a desperation pass to the end zone as time expired, but the pass was batted away safely to the ground for an incompletion to end the game.\nAllen finished the game 26-for-35 for 324 yards and two touchdowns, while also leading the Bills in rushing with 11 carries for 54 yards and a touchdown. Diggs caught 6 passes for 128 yards and a touchdown. Rivers was 27-for-46 for 309 yards and two touchdowns in what would end up being his final NFL game prior to announcing his retirement. Taylor was the top rusher for the game with 21 carries for 76 yards and a touchdown, while Hines had 75 yards on 6 rushes and Pittman caught 5 passes for 90 yards. Colts linebacker Shaquille Leonard had 9 solo tackles and 3 assists. The Bills won despite being outgained in total yards 472 to 397.\nNFC: Los Angeles Rams 30, Seattle Seahawks 20.\nRams starting quarterback Jared Goff came into this game as a backup to John Wolford – due to a broken thumb on his throwing hand suffered in week 16 – but a neck injury suffered by Wolford on the Rams' second possession resulted in Goff returning to the starting lineup. Though Goff completed less than half his passes, he led the Rams to victory, with running back Cam Akers accumulating 176 scrimmage yards.\nSeahawks' safety Jamal Adams landed an illegal low helmet-to-helmet hit on Wolford, knocking him out of the game during the Rams' second possession, after he completed a pair of passes to Cooper Kupp for gains of 15 and 13 yards that set up Matt Gay's 40-yard field goal, giving the team a 3–0 lead. In the second quarter, Michael Dickson's 48-yard punt pinned the Rams back on their own 5-yard line. Following a three-and-out, Johnny Hekker's 44-yard punt gave Seattle good field position on their own 49-yard line, where they proceeded to drive 19 yards and tie the game on a 50-yard field goal by Jason Myers. Los Angeles struck back with Goff's 44-yard completion to Kupp setting up Gay's second field goal, a 39-yard kick. Then they increased their lead to 13–3 when Darious Williams intercepted a pass from Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson and returned it 42 yards for a touchdown. Wilson quickly recovered, leading the team 79 yards in five plays and scoring on a 51-yard touchdown pass to DK Metcalf. On Los Angeles' next possession, Akers had a 44-yard reception and a 20-yard carry before taking the ball into the end zone on a 5-yard run, giving the Rams a 20–10 lead with 2 minutes left in the half.\nSeattle cornerback D. J. Reed returned the second half kickoff 58 yards to Los Angeles' 41-yard line, setting up a 52-yard field goal by Myers that cut the score to 20–13. After six consecutive drives resulted in punts, Goff's 20-yard completion to Robert Woods started up a 9-play, 52-yard drive that ended on a 36-yard field goal from Gay, giving the Rams a 23–13 lead with 11:37 remaining. Then after a punt from each team, Rams linebacker Samson Ebukam forced a fumble from Reed on a punt return, which Micah Kiser recovered for Los Angeles on the Seahawks' 36-yard line, where the Rams went on to a 30–13 lead on Goff's 15-yard touchdown pass to Woods. Wilson responded with a 23-yard scramble and a 28-yard completion to Freddie Swain before throwing a 12-yard touchdown completion to Metcalf, with 2:34 left.\nGoff was 9-for-19 for 155 yards and a touchdown, while defensive tackle Aaron Donald had two sacks, despite having to leave the game with a rib injury. Wilson was held to 11-for-27 for 174 yards, with two touchdowns – both to Metcalf, who had five receptions for 96 yards – and an interception, as well as 50 yards on 4 carries; linebacker Bobby Wagner had 11 solo tackles, 5 assists, and 1 sack. It would be Wilson's final playoff game as a Seahawk.\nThis was the second meeting between the Rams and Seahawks. The Rams had also won the previous meeting on the road in the .\nNFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31, Washington Football Team 23.\nTampa Bay racked up 507 yards of offense, 3 sacks, and forced 2 turnovers as they earned their first postseason victory since winning Super Bowl XXXVII.\nBuccaneers quarterback Tom Brady completed a 30-yard pass to Mike Evans and a 17-yard throw to Chris Godwin as he led the team to a 29-yard Ryan Succop field goal on the game's opening drive. Then after a punt from each team, Tampa Bay cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting intercepted a pass from Taylor Heinicke, on the Buccaneers' 42-yard line. Tampa Bay then drove 58 yards in six plays to score on Brady's 36-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Brown, giving the team a 9–0 lead after Succop's extra point was blocked by Jeremy Reaves. But Heinicke started the next drive with completions to Logan Thomas and Terry McLaurin for gains of 24 and 18 yards, respectively, before J. D. McKissic finished it off with a 2-yard touchdown run, making the score 9–7 with 12:58 left in the half. Dustin Hopkins' short kickoff gave the Buccaneers a first down on their own 39-yard line. On the next play, Brown took a pitch on an end-around and ran for a 22-yard gain. Three plays later, Brady threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Godwin, giving the Buccaneers a 15–7 lead after their two-point conversion attempt failed. Then after a punt, Brady completed 3-of-5 passes for 65 yards on an 82-yard drive that ended with Succop's 23-yard field goal, giving Tampa Bay an 18–7 lead at halftime.\nWashington cut their deficit to 18–10 with the opening drive of the third quarter, converting Heinicke's 29-yard completion to Thomas into a 36-yard Hopkins field goal. Later in the period, Washington defensive tackle Daron Payne forced a fumble from Ke'Shawn Vaughn that Jon Bostic recovered for Washington on their 39-yard line. Heinicke then completed a 19-yard pass to Cam Sims and rushed for a 13-yard gain before taking the ball into the end zone himself on an 8-yard touchdown run, cutting the deficit to 18–16 after an unsuccessful 2-point try. Tampa Bay responded with a 9-play, 55-yard drive, the longest a 23-yard catch by tight end Cameron Brate. Succop finished it off with a 38-yard field goal, giving the Buccaneers a 21–16 lead with 13:38 left. Following a Washington punt, Brady completed passes to Evans for gains of 20 and 19 yards, while Leonard Fournette rushed three times for 22 yards, the last carry a 3-yard touchdown run that put his team up 28–16. On Washington's next drive, Heinicke completed 8-of-10 passes for 71 yards and finishing the drive with an 11-yard touchdown completion to Sims. With the score now 28–23 and 4:57 left, Brady completed passes of 35 yards to Evans and 16 yards to Godwin, setting up Succop's 37-yard field goal with 2:49 left. Washington then drove across midfield, but after two incompletions and an 11-yard sack by Lavonte David, Heinicke's 4th down pass was incomplete, enabling Tampa Bay to run out the rest of the game clock.\nBrady completed 22-for-40 passes for 381 yards and two touchdowns, Fournette rushed for 93 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 4 passes for 39 yards. Evans caught 6 passes for 119 yards, and David had 8 solo tackles and a sack.

Sims had 7 receptions for 104 yards, and Reaves blocked an extra point and had 9 solo tackles.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between Tampa Bay and Washington. The series was tied 1–1.\nSunday, January 10, 2021.\nAFC: Baltimore Ravens 20, Tennessee Titans 13.\nIn a game between the two teams with the most rushing yards during the season, Baltimore came out on top, outgaining the Titans in total yards 401–209, and holding them to just 51 yards on the ground. Tennessee running back Derrick Henry, the NFL's leading rusher in 2020, was held to just 40 yards on 18 carries.\nTennessee opened up the scoring on their second possession with a 10-play, 75-yard drive, featuring a 28-yard completion from Ryan Tannehill to A. J. Brown, before Brown's 10-yard touchdown catch made the score 7–0. Then on Baltimore's next drive, Malcolm Butler intercepted a pass from Lamar Jackson on the Tennessee 28-yard line. Tannehill went on to complete a 35-yard pass to Anthony Firkser that set up Stephen Gostkowski's 45-yard field goal giving the Titans a 10–0 first quarter lead. Baltimore responded by moving the ball 65 yards in 12 plays, including a 28-yard completion from Jackson to receiver Marquise Brown. Justin Tucker finished the drive with a 33-yard field goal, that made the score 10–3 five minutes into the second quarter. Then after a punt by the Titans, the Ravens tied the score at 10–10 with Jackson's 48-yard touchdown run on a 3rd and 9.\nBaltimore took a 17–10 lead with their opening drive of the second half, with Jackson completing 4-of-4 passes for 30 yards and rushing four times for 34 yards, on the way to J. K. Dobbins' 4-yard touchdown run. Following a pair of punts, a roughing the passer penalty against Baltimore defensive end Derek Wolfe turned A. J. Brown's 18-yard reception into a 33-yard gain. Tennessee went on to make the score 17–13 with Gostkowski's 25-yard field goal, on the last play of the third quarter. Baltimore responded with a drive to the Titans' 34-yard line, but Tucker missed a 52-yard field goal. The Titans then drove to Baltimore's 40 yard line, but the drive stalled and they punted. The Ravens responded with another scoring drive as Jackson completed 3-of-3 passes for 30 yards and rushed for 14 yards, setting up a successful 51-yard field goal for Tucker, giving the Ravens a 20–13 lead with 4:23 left. Marcus Peters ended Tennessee's next drive with an interception of Tannehill, enabling the Ravens' offense to run out the clock with four running plays, including a 33-yard run from Jackson.\nJackson completed 17-for-24 passes for 179 yards with an interception, and was the game's leading rusher with 16 carries for 136 yards and a touchdown as he recorded his first playoff victory in his career. Marquise Brown was the game's leading receiver with 7 catches for 109 yards. Tannehill finished the day 18-for-26 for 165 yards, a touchdown, and an interception; Tennessee linebacker Harold Landry had 8 tackles, 2 assists, and 2 sacks.\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Ravens and Titans. The series was split with the road team winning all four games. As of 2024, the Ravens are the most recent AFC wild card team win on the road and play in the divisional round. In contrast, at least one NFC wild card has advanced to the divisional round every season under the 14-team format.\nNFC: New Orleans Saints 21, Chicago Bears 9.\nAlthough the Bears finished with an 8–8 record, they managed to make the playoffs after the Los Angeles Rams beat the Arizona Cardinals in the final week of the season. Even though the two teams finished with identical 8–8 records, the Bears advanced with a better record of common opponents over the Cardinals with key wins over the Rams, Carolina Panthers, Detroit Lions, and New York Giants. The Bears were 3–2 while the Cardinals were 1–4. As for the Saints, they finished 12–4, falling short of going 3 consecutive years of 13–3 records, but still making the playoffs for the fourth year in a row. The game was the two teams' first meeting in the playoffs since the .\nNew Orleans held Chicago to just 239 yards and a single field goal until the closing seconds of the fourth quarter as they progressed to the Divisional round.\nIn the first quarter, Saints receiver Deonte Harris returned a punt 7 yards to the New Orleans 45-yard line, before he caught a 17-yard pass as his team drove 50 yards on 8 plays to score on Drew Brees's 11-yard touchdown throw to Michael Thomas. Chicago seemed primed to respond, as Mitchell Trubisky completed a 28-yard pass to Javon Wims, on the Saints' 40-yard line. On the next play, the Bears ran a trick play in which running back David Montgomery took the snap out of the wildcat formation and gave the ball to Cordarrelle Patterson, who then pitched the ball to Trubisky. The play initially worked perfectly, as Trubisky threw the ball to a wide open Wims in the end zone, only to see him drop the pass. This turned out to be crucial as the drive ended in a turnover on downs on the Saints' 34-yard line. New Orleans then drove to the Bears' 32-yard line, but Wil Lutz missed a 52-yard field goal attempt. In the second quarter, Bears safety Tashaun Gipson forced a fumble from Taysom Hill that John Jenkins recovered for Chicago, on the Saints' 24-yard line. This led to Cairo Santos' 36-yard field goal that made the score 7–3; the next four drives ended in punts, with no additional scoring to the half.\nAfter the Bears punted on the first drive of the third quarter, Brees completed 6-of-7 passes for 72 yards, the longest being a 38-yard throw to Thomas. He finished the drive with a 6-yard touchdown completion to running back Latavius Murray, giving the Saints a 14–3 lead. The Bears had to punt again after three plays, and Harris returned it 11 yards to New Orleans' 36-yard line. From there, the Saints drove 64 yards in 15 plays to go up 21–3 on Alvin Kamara's 3-yard touchdown run with 8:50 left. Following another Bears punt, New Orleans drove all the way to the Chicago 1-yard line, but ended up turning the ball over on downs. In the final 2:19 of the game, the Bears drove 99 yards in 11 plays and scored on the final play of the game, with Trubisky's 19-yard touchdown pass to Jimmy Graham.\nBrees completed 28-for-39 passes for 265 yards and 2 touchdowns, Kamara had 23 carries for 99 yards and a touchdown, along with 2 receptions for 17 yards; Harris caught 7 passes for 83 yards and returned 3 punts for 22 yards. Trubisky finished the game 19-for-29 for 199 yards and a touchdown.\nThis was the first ever telecast of the \"NFL on Nickelodeon\".\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Bears and Saints. The Bears had won the previous two meetings, including the .\nAFC: Cleveland Browns 48, Pittsburgh Steelers 37.\nDespite missing four players and five coaches – including head coach Kevin Stefanski – due to positive COVID-19 tests, Cleveland built up a 35–10 first half lead, forced five turnovers, and held on to earn their first playoff win since the . This was also the Browns' first playoff appearance since 2002, their first road win against the Steelers since 2003, and their first road playoff win since .\nThe Browns took a 7–0 lead on the first play from scrimmage when a high snap from Pittsburgh center Maurkice Pouncey sailed over quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's head and went into the end zone, where safety Karl Joseph recovered the ball for a touchdown. Then on Pittsburgh's next drive, cornerback M. J. Stewart intercepted a pass from Roethlisberger, giving the Browns the ball on the Steelers' 46-yard line. Two plays later, Baker Mayfield threw a short pass to Jarvis Landry in the middle of the field and he ran it 40 yards into the end zone to increase Cleveland's lead to 14–0. Pittsburgh then had to punt after three plays, and the Browns drove 65 yards in 6 plays, the longest a 20-yard run from Nick Chubb. Kareem Hunt finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown run, to put the Browns up 21–0. Then, Roethlisberger threw another interception, this one to safety Sheldrick Redwine, who returned it 30 yards to the Steelers' 15-yard line. This set up Hunt's 8-yard touchdown run that gave the Browns a 28–0 first quarter lead – tying an NFL playoff record for points in the first quarter.\nIn the second quarter, Roethlisberger threw his third interception to defensive end Porter Gustin, that gave the Browns the ball on their 47-yard line, but the Steelers' defense was able to force a punt. Pittsburgh then drove 89 yards in 13 plays, featuring a 27-yard completion from Roethlisberger to receiver James Washington. Running back James Conner also made some crucial plays, converting a 4th and 1 on the Browns' 2-yard line with a 1-yard run, and then running the ball into the end zone on the next play to make the score 28–7. D'Ernest Johnson returned the resulting kickoff 33 yards to the Browns' 36-yard line. Then, after Mayfield scrambled to convert a 3rd and 6, he completed a 21-yard pass to Chubb to the Steelers' 32-yard line. Three plays later, Mayfield finished the possession with a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Austin Hooper, giving the Browns a 35–7 lead with 37 seconds left in the half. Still, Pittsburgh managed to respond, driving 32 yards in five plays to score on Chris Boswell's 49-yard field goal, for a halftime score of 35–10.\nIn the third quarter, the Browns punted on their opening drive, and Roethlisberger completed eight consecutive passes for 84 yards, the last a 17-yard touchdown completion to tight end Eric Ebron, cutting the score to 35–16 after a failed 2-point conversion attempt. Following another Browns' punt, Roethlisberger completed passes to JuJu Smith-Schuster for gains of 15 and 27 yards as the team drove 68 yards in 12 plays. Faced with 4th and goal on the Browns' 5-yard line, Roethlisberger threw another pass to Smith-Schuster for a touchdown, cutting their deficit to 35–23.\nAfter a Browns punt, the Steelers drove to a 4th and 1 on their 46-yard line in the closing seconds of the third quarter. From there, Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin decided to let the play clock run down to zero in an attempt to draw the Browns offside, and then punt the ball on 4th and 6. Tomlin later received criticism for declining to attempt a fourth down conversion. Cleveland got the ball seconds into the fourth quarter, and increased their lead to 42–23, with Mayfield completing passes to Landry for gains of 17 and 14 yards before finishing the drive with a 40-yard touchdown pass to Chubb. Roethlisberger completed four consecutive passes for 76 yards for the Steelers, the last a 29-yard touchdown pass to rookie receiver Chase Claypool. This made the score 42–29 with 6:39 left, following another failed 2-point try. The Browns stepped up to cut off any chance of a comeback; Johnson returned the kickoff 30 yards to the Browns' 35-yard line, sparking a 13-play, 59-yard drive that ended with Cody Parkey's 24-yard field goal that put the team up 45–29. Then, linebacker Sione Takitaki recorded Cleveland's fourth interception of the day, picking off a pass from Roethlisberger and returning it 23 yards to the Steelers' 25-yard line. This led to another Parkey field goal that gave the Browns a 48–29 lead with 2:54 left. Roethlisberger led the Steelers 77 yards in 8 plays, including his 33-yard completion to Smith-Schuster on 4th and 10, on the way to his 7-yard touchdown pass to Claypool. Then, his 2-point conversion pass to Connor made the score 48–37. The Browns recovered Pittsburgh's ensuing onside kick attempt and ran out the rest of the clock.\nMayfield finished his first career playoff game with 21-for-34 for 263 yards and three touchdowns. Landry was his top target with 5 catches for 92 yards and a touchdown. Chubb was the top rusher of the day with 18 carries for 76 yards, while also catching 4 passes for 69 yards and a touchdown. Stewart had 9 tackles (1 for loss) and an interception. Roethlisberger completed 47-of-68 passes for 501 yards and 4 touchdowns, with 4 interceptions. His 47 completions set an NFL record, his 68 passes set an NFL postseason record, and his 501 yards was the second highest total in postseason history. Smith-Schuster had 13 receptions for 157 yards and a touchdown, while Diontae Johnson added 11 receptions for 117 yards.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Steelers and Browns. The Steelers had won the previous two in the 1994 and 2002 seasons, which were the only playoff games the Browns had been in during that span.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 16, 2021.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 32, Los Angeles Rams 18.\nDespite losing Pro Bowl offensive tackle David Bakhtiari to injury in practice prior to Week 17, the Packers racked up 487 yards and 32 points against a Rams defense that finished the 2020 season leading the NFL in fewest points and yards allowed. The Rams were dealing with a myriad of injuries themselves, with leading receiver Cooper Kupp out with knee bursitis suffered in the closing seconds of their previous win, starting quarterback Jared Goff playing with a surgically repaired thumb on his throwing hand just twelve days prior, and two-time defensive player of the year Aaron Donald severely hampered after tearing rib cartilage the previous week.\nThe Packers scored on their first drive, with a 12-play, 63-yard possession that featured a 27-yard completion from Aaron Rodgers to Equanimeous St. Brown; Mason Crosby's 24-yard field goal gave the Packers a 3–0 lead. The Rams responded as Goff's completions to Josh Reynolds and Robert Woods set up a 37-yard field goal from Matt Gay to tie the game. Green Bay then drove 84 yards in 14 plays to take a 10–3 lead on Davante Adams' 1-yard touchdown reception with 11:37 left in the half. The Rams then had to punt after three plays, and a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against their receiver Nsimba Webster turned Tavon Austin's 8-yard return into a 23-yard gain, giving the Packers a first down on the Rams' 47-yard line. From there, Rodgers completed 5-of-5 passes for 44 yards, and he scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, giving Green Bay a 16–3 lead after a botched snap on the extra point attempt. The Rams took the ball back with 3:39 left in the half, and drove 75 yards in 9 plays, the longest a 21-yard catch by Reynolds. Goff finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown pass to Van Jefferson, making the score 16–10 with 29 seconds left in the half. Following the kickoff, Rodgers' completions to Adams and Robert Tonyan for gains of 21 and 33 yards enabled Crosby to kick a 39-yard field goal as time expired in the half, making the score 19–10.\nOn the first play of the third quarter, Packers running back Aaron Jones ran for a 60-yard gain to the Rams' 15-yard line. Three plays later, he scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Packers a 25–10 lead after a failed 2-point conversion attempt. After a punt from each team, Goff completed 6-of-6 passes for 51 yards on an 11-play, 74-yard drive; Cam Akers finished the drive with a 7-yard run from the wildcat formation. On the ensuing 2-point conversion, Goff threw the ball to Jefferson, who then lateralled it to Akers before reaching the end zone, making the score 25–18, with 1:45 left in the quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, the Rams forced a punt, giving them a chance to drive for the tying touchdown; but Packers nose tackle Kenny Clark made a crucial sack on Goff that eventually forced the Rams to punt. On the ensuing drive, the Rams forced an A. J. Dillon fumble in Green Bay territory, but the ball squirted right to Rodgers who was trailing the play. The Packers then converted a short third down, and two plays later put the game away with Rodgers' 58-yard touchdown pass to Allen Lazard.\nRodgers completed 23 of 36 passes for 296 yards and 2 touchdowns, while adding a rushing touchdown as well. Jones had 14 carries for 99 yards and a touchdown, along with a 14-yard catch and Lazard was the top receiver of the game with 4 receptions for 96 yards and a touchdown. Goff completed 21 of 27 passes for 174 yards and a touchdown, while Akers was the Rams' top rusher of the game with 18 carries for 90 yards and a touchdown, and also caught a pass for 6 yards.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Rams and Packers. The series was split 1–1.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 17, Baltimore Ravens 3.\nIn a game largely controlled by defense, Bills cornerback Taron Johnson's postseason record-tying 101-yard interception return gave Buffalo a two-score lead that the Ravens could not overcome. Windy conditions also played a major role in the game, with each team missing two field goal attempts and one punt went for just 23 yards.\nBaltimore took the opening kickoff and drove 46 yards to the Bills' 23-yard line, but the drive ended there as Justin Tucker hit the uprights on a 41-yard field goal attempt. Both teams had to punt on their next drive, and Sam Koch's 23-yard kick gave the Bills the ball on the Baltimore 38-yard line. From there, they drove 17 yards to take a 3–0 lead on a 28-yard field goal by rookie kicker Tyler Bass. After a Ravens punt, Buffalo drove to the Baltimore 23-yard line, but Bass missed a 43-yard field goal kick with 13:21 left in the half. Baltimore fared no better, as their next drive also ended in a missed field goal, this time with Tucker hitting the uprights again from 46 yards. After three more punts, Baltimore finally managed to get on the board, converting a 30-yard completion from Lamar Jackson to Marquise Brown into a 34-yard field goal by Tucker on the last play of the half.\nBuffalo took the second half kickoff and drove 66 yards in 11 plays, the longest a 20-yard completion from Josh Allen to Stefon Diggs. On the last play, Allen's 3-yard touchdown pass to Diggs gave Buffalo a 10–3 lead. Baltimore seemed primed to respond, as they moved the ball to a 2nd and goal from the Bills' 9-yard line with 58 seconds left in the third quarter. But on the next play, Johnson picked off a pass from Jackson in the end zone and returned it 101 yards for a touchdown, increasing the Bills' lead to 17–3. Jackson suffered a concussion on the next drive and had to leave the game, and was replaced at quarterback by Tyler Huntley. Baltimore had two possessions in the fourth quarter, but each one ended in a turnover on downs with the second ending at the Buffalo 10-yard-line.\nAllen completed 23 of 37 passes for 206 yards and a touchdown and Diggs had 8 receptions for 106 yards and a touchdown. In addition to his interception, Johnson also had six tackles. Jackson completed 14/24 passes for 162 yards and one interception, while also rushing for 42 yards.\nSunday, January 17, 2021.\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 22, Cleveland Browns 17.\nKansas City built up a 19–3 first half lead and survived losing their starting quarterback Patrick Mahomes in the second half, in order to become the first AFC team to host three consecutive conference championship games.\nOn the opening drive, Mahomes completed 4 of 4 passes for 41 yards, including a 26-yard completion to Tyreek Hill, as the team drove 75 yards in 10 plays to score on his 1-yard touchdown run. Harrison Butker missed the extra point, keeping the score at 6–0. Cleveland responded with a 12-play, 47-yard scoring drive, featuring a 27-yard pass from Baker Mayfield to tight end David Njoku. Two key defensive plays by L'Jarius Sneed, a tackle for a 3-yard loss and an 8-yard sack on Mayfield, forced Cleveland to settle for Cody Parkey's 46-yard field goal to make the score 6–3. On the second play of the Chiefs' next drive, Mecole Hardman ran a shovel pass 42 yards to the Browns' 25-yard line, and the team went on to take a 13–3 lead with Mahomes' 20-yard touchdown pass to tight end Travis Kelce with 13:48 left in the half. After forcing the Browns to punt, Kansas City drove back for more points; this time Mahomes completed 5 of 7 passes for 40 yards and rushed for 13 yards, as he led the team to a 16–3 lead with Butker's 50-yard field goal. Cleveland responded with a drive to the Chiefs' 25-yard line. On the next play, Mayfield threw a pass to Rashard Higgins; as he dived for the goal line, safety Daniel Sorensen hit him from the left side, knocking the ball loose and causing it to roll through the end zone for a touchback. Many observers argued Sorensen should have been penalized for targeting Higgins with his helmet, including CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore. Kansas City took the ball back with 30 seconds left, and managed to drive into scoring range with Mahomes completing passes to Hill for gains of 13 and 16 yards, as well as a 22-yard pass to Kelce. On the last play of the quarter, Butker kicked a 28-yard field goal, giving the Chiefs a 19–3 halftime lead.\nEarly in the third quarter, Tyrann Mathieu intercepted a pass from Mayfield and returned it 17 yards to the Browns' 19-yard line. Kansas City only gained four yards with their next three plays and Butker missed a 33-yard field goal attempt. Cleveland took over on their own 23-yard line, and started off with a pair of runs from Nick Chubb for gains of 23 and 18 yards. Then after a 2-yard run from Kareem Hunt, Mayfield's 18-yard completion to Higgins gave the Browns a first down on the Chiefs' 16-yard line. Three plays later, Mayfield finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown pass to Jarvis Landry, cutting the deficit to 19–10. Kansas City then drove to a 3rd and 1 on their 48-yard line. On the next play, Mahomes tried to run for a first down, but was tackled short of the marker and was knocked out of the game and put into concussion protocol. He was replaced by 13-year veteran Chad Henne, making his postseason debut. Now faced with 4th and 1, Henne pitched the ball to Darrel Williams, who ran around the left side for a 12-yard gain. On the next play, Williams rushed 16 yards to the Browns' 24-yard line. Cleveland's defense managed to stop the drive on their 15-yard line, where Butker's 33-yard field goal gave the Chiefs a 22–10 lead, with 4:24 left in the third quarter.\nCleveland took the ball back and mounted their longest drive of the season, moving the ball 75 yards in 18 plays on a possession that lasted 8:17 and included two fourth down conversions. On 4th and 1 from their own 34-yard line, Chubb ran 3 yards for a first down. Then on 4th and 3 from the Chiefs' 12-yard line, tight end Austin Hooper made a diving catch through tight coverage by Bashaud Breeland for a 5-yard gain. Two plays later, Hunt scored on a 3-yard touchdown run, making the score 22–17 with 11:07 left. Kansas City then drove to the Browns' 25-yard line. But after a penalty pushed them back to the 38-yard line, Henne threw a deep pass to the end zone that was intercepted by safety Karl Joseph. On Cleveland's next drive, they moved into a 3rd and 11 situation on their own 30-yard line. On the next play, Mayfield was forced to make a check-down pass to Hunt, who was tackled after picking up 2 yards. Now on 4th and 9, they punted the ball to Kansas City with 4:09 left. The Chiefs then converted a 3rd and 4 with Henne's 5-yard pass to Williams. Then after a Myles Garrett sack brought up 3rd and 14, Henne scrambled for a 13-yard gain, going down just inches short of a first down. Now faced with 4th and inches on their own 35-yard line, Chiefs coach Andy Reid decided to attempt a conversion. The Chiefs came out in shotgun formation with no running backs in the backfield, leading commentator Tony Romo to assume they would simply try to draw the Browns offsides. Instead, Henne took the snap and threw the ball to Hill for a 5-yard game-clinching first down.\nMahomes completed 21 of 30 passes for 255 yards and a touchdown, Hill caught 8 passes for 110 yards, while also rushing for 9 yards and Kelce had 8 receptions for 109 yards and a touchdown. Starting in place of the injured Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Williams rushed for 78 yards and caught 4 passes for 16 yards. Mayfield completed 23 of 37 passes for 204 yards with a touchdown and an interception.\nNFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 30, New Orleans Saints 20.\nTampa Bay forced four turnovers which were converted into three touchdowns in a winning effort against a Saints team that had defeated them twice during the regular season. Buccaneers linebacker Devin White led the defensive effort with 10 tackles (1 for loss), 1 assist, a fumble recovery, and an interception.\nThe Buccaneers had to punt on their opening drive, and Deonte Harris' 43-yard return gave New Orleans a first down on the Tampa Bay 21-yard line, setting up Wil Lutz's 23-yard field goal to take a 3–0 lead. The next time Tampa Bay punted, Harris returned it for a touchdown, ultimately negated by an illegal block penalty. Still, the team managed to drive 36 yards to a 6–0 lead on Lutz's 42-yard kick. The Buccaneers responded by moving the ball 65 yards in 15 plays to score on Ryan Succop's 26-yard field goal, with 12:57 left in the half. On the Saints' next drive, Sean Murphy-Bunting intercepted a pass from Drew Brees and returned it 36 yards to the New Orleans 3-yard line, setting up Tom Brady's 3-yard touchdown pass to Mike Evans that gave Tampa Bay a 10–6 lead. New Orleans took the ball back and drove to their 44-yard line. On the next play, running back Alvin Kamara took a snap out of the wildcat formation and gave the ball to receiver Emmanuel Sanders, who then pitched the ball to backup quarterback Jameis Winston. Winston then threw the ball to Tre'Quan Smith for a 56-yard touchdown, putting the Saints back in the lead at 13–10. Following a punt from each team, the Buccaneers drove 68 yards to tie the score 13–13 with Succop's 37-yard field goal on the last play of the half.\nNew Orleans opened the third quarter with a 10-play, 75-yard drive, with Kamara rushing 4 times for 32 yards and catching a pass for 7 yards. Brees finished the possession with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Smith, giving the Saints a 20–13 lead. The Saints defense then forced a punt, but on their next drive, Antoine Winfield Jr. forced a fumble from Jared Cook that White recovered and returned 18 yards to the Saints' 40-yard line. Brady started the ensuing possession with a 19-yard pass to tight end Cameron Brate, and finished it with a 6-yard touchdown completion to running back Leonard Fournette, with the game now tied at 20–20. After a Saints punt, Brady's completions to Tyler Johnson and Scotty Miller for gains of 15 and 29 yards set up Succop's 36-yard field goal, giving Tampa Bay a 23–20 lead with 9:52 left. White put an end to New Orleans' next drive, intercepting Brees and returning the ball 28 yards to the Saints' 20-yard line. Three plays later, Brady scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak that increased the Buccaneers' lead to 30–20 with 4:57 left. Brees was picked off for a third time, this time by safety Mike Edwards, ultimately securing Tampa Bay's victory.\nBrady completed 18 of 33 passes for 199 yards and two touchdowns, and became the oldest player ever to score a postseason rushing touchdown, as he advanced to his 14th conference championship game in 21 seasons. In his final NFL game before retiring, Brees was held to completing 19 of 34 passes, for 134 yards and a touchdown, while being intercepted three times. Kamara was the top rusher of the game with 18 carries for 85 yards, while also catching 3 passes for 20 yards.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 24, 2021.\nNFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31, Green Bay Packers 26.\nDespite giving up more yards and having more turnovers than Green Bay, Tampa Bay's 18 point lead early in the second half helped them weather a comeback by Green Bay, as Tampa Bay's defense held Green Bay to just 6 points off of 3 interceptions.\nTampa Bay took the opening kickoff and drove 66 yards on a drive that featured three third down conversions. First, Tom Brady converted a 3rd and 4 with a 27-yard pass to Mike Evans. Then on 3rd and 9, he threw a 14-yard completion to Chris Godwin. Finally, Brady finished the possession with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Evans on 3rd and 7, giving the Buccaneers a 7–0 lead. Following a punt from each team, Green Bay tied the score at 7–7 on a 90-yard drive in which Aaron Rodgers converted a 3rd and 15 with a 23-yard pass to Allen Lazard before throwing a 50-yard touchdown completion to Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Tampa Bay took the ball back, and made another big 3rd down conversion with Brady's 52-yard pass to Godwin on 3rd and 9. On the next play, Leonard Fournette's 20-yard touchdown run made the score 14–7 with 12:24 left in the half. Green Bay responded by driving 69 yards in 15 plays to cut the score to 14–10 with Mason Crosby's 24-yard field goal. Their defense then forced a punt, but on the Packers' next drive, Sean Murphy-Bunting intercepted a pass from Rodgers on the Buccaneers' 49-yard line with 28 seconds left in the half. Tampa Bay then drove to a 4th and 4 on the Packers' 45-yard line, managing to convert it with a 6-yard catch by Fournette. With eight seconds remaining, Tampa Bay decided against kicking a long field goal, and Brady threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Scotty Miller, ending the half with the Buccaneers ahead 21–10. In the first half alone, Brady completed 13 of 22 passes for 202 yards and two touchdowns.\nTwo plays into the third quarter, safety Jordan Whitehead forced a fumble from Packers running back Aaron Jones. Devin White recovered it for Tampa Bay and returned it 21 yards to the Green Bay 8-yard line. On the next play, Tampa Bay fooled the Packers defense with a play-action pass, with Brady faking a backfield handoff before throwing the ball to tight end Cameron Brate for a touchdown and a 28–10 lead. On Green Bay's next drive, Rodgers completed 5 of 6 passes for 68 yards and finishing the drive with an 8-yard touchdown throw to tight end Robert Tonyan, making the score 28–17. Then safety Adrian Amos intercepted a pass from Brady on the Packers' 32-yard line, sparking a 13-play, 68-yard drive that ended with Rodgers' 2-yard touchdown completion to Davante Adams with 24 seconds left in the quarter; receiver Equanimeous St. Brown dropped Rodgers' pass on a 2-point conversion attempt, and the score remained 28–23. Tampa Bay then drove to the Packers' 28-yard line, only to lose the ball again when Brady threw an interception to cornerback Jaire Alexander. Green Bay could not get a first down and had to punt after Shaquil Barrett sacked Rodgers for a 10-yard loss on 3rd and 5. Then Brady was picked off for the third time, throwing another interception to Alexander. Green Bay's next possession resulted in Rodgers again being sacked by Barrett and the team again going three-and-out. Tampa Bay took the ball back on their own 28-yard line, and went on to drive 44 yards in 8 plays, the longest a 29-yard gain on a screen pass from Brady to Rob Gronkowski. On the last play, Ryan Succop's 46-yard field goal gave the Buccaneers a 31–23 lead with 4:42 left.\nGreen Bay then drove to a first and goal from the Buccaneers' 8-yard line. After two incompletions, Rodgers appeared to have room to run toward the end zone, but he chose to throw the ball to a well covered Adams, which resulted in another incompletion. Packers head coach Matt LaFleur elected not to attempt a tying touchdown on 4th and goal from the 8-yard line with 2:09 left; Crosby kicked a field goal that cut the Packers' deficit to 5 points, 31–26. Tampa Bay went on to run out the rest of the clock with three first downs; they started the drive with a 9-yard pass from Brady to Evans as the clock ran down to the 2-minute warning. Green Bay deliberately committed an encroachment penalty, on 2nd and 1, giving the Buccaneers a first down. Two plays later on 3rd and 4, Brady's threw an incomplete pass, but the officials threw a late flag against defensive back Kevin King for pass interference while trying to cover Tyler Johnson, giving the Buccaneers another first down to clinch the game. The call was controversial since several Tampa Bay players seemed to commit holds earlier in the game that went uncalled, including one on Allen Lazard in the first quarter, although the call itself was deemed correct. Tampa Bay finished the game with a run by Godwin on third and 5.\nBrady completed 20 of 36 passes for 280 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions in his 14th conference championship game (and first in the NFC) as he advanced to his 10th Super Bowl in 21 seasons. Godwin was his top target with 5 receptions for 110 yards. White had 9 tackles, 6 assists, and a fumble recovery. Barrett had 3 sacks, while linebacker Jason Pierre-Paul had 2 sacks. Rodgers completed 33 of 48 passes for 346 yards and 3 touchdowns, with one interception, as he lost his second consecutive conference championship game and fell to 1–4 overall in Conference title games over his 16 seasons, making him the first quarterback to have four consecutive losses in conference championship games. Valdes-Scantling caught 4 passes for 115 yards and a score. Nose tackle Kenny Clark had 6 tackles (1 for loss), 2 assists, and a sack. With the win, the Buccaneers reached their second Super Bowl in franchise history and became the first team to play a Super Bowl in their home stadium.\nOn April 5, 2021, during Rodgers' first episode of \"Jeopardy!\" as the guest host following the death of its longtime emcee Alex Trebek, the questionable fourth-quarter play was referenced in a player's Final Jeopardy! answer: \"Who wanted to kick that field goal?\" As the audience laughed at this, Rodgers remarked: \"That's a great question. It should be correct, but unfortunately in this game today it's incorrect.\" However, the contestant (who had started the episode as the returning champion) entered $0 as his wager, and eventually finished in second place.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Packers and Buccaneers. The Packers had defeated the Buccaneers in the .\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 38, Buffalo Bills 24.\nKansas City overcame an early 9–0 deficit with 38 points and 439 total yards as they advanced to their second consecutive Super Bowl.\nBuffalo opened up the scoring with Tyler Bass' 51-yard field goal, at the end of a 10-play, 42-yard drive, and the Bills forced the Chiefs to go three-and-out. The Bills also had to punt on their next drive, but returner Mecole Hardman muffed the kick and Taiwan Jones recovered it for Buffalo on the Chiefs' 3-yard line. On the next play, Josh Allen threw a touchdown pass to tight end Dawson Knox, making the score 9–0 after Bass missed the extra point. Kansas City advanced 80 yards on their next drive in which Patrick Mahomes completed 10 passes, one of them a 9-yard completion to running back Darrel Williams on 4th and 1. With 14:20 left in the half, Mahomes' 3-yard touchdown completion to Hardman made the score 9–7. The next time Kansas City got the ball, Hardman's 50-yard gain on an end-around run pre-empted a 6-yard touchdown run by Williams, giving the Chiefs a 14–9 lead. Following another Bills punt, Mahomes completed passes to tight end Travis Kelce for gains of 11 and 17 yards, along with a 33-yard completion to Tyreek Hill. Clyde Edwards-Helaire finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the team's lead to 21–9. Buffalo took the ball back and drove 73 yards to the Chiefs' 2-yard line, featuring a 20-yard reception by running back T. J. Yeldon. On 4th and goal with 14 seconds left, the Bills decided to settle for Bass' 20-yard field goal and a 21–12 halftime score.\nMahomes started the third quarter completing 7 of 8 passes for 50 yards on the way to a 45-yard Harrison Butker field goal, bringing the Chiefs' lead up to 24–12. The Bills responded with a drive to the Chiefs' 8-yard line, with Allen completing passes of 23 yards to Cole Beasley and 17 yards to John Brown. Faced with 4th and 3 on the Chiefs' 8-yard line, Buffalo once again elected to take a Bass field goal, making the score 24–15. On the next play from scrimmage, Mahomes threw a 71-yard completion to Hill on the Bills' 4-yard line, leading to his 1-yard touchdown pass to Kelce that put Kansas City up 31–15. Chiefs cornerback Rashad Fenton then intercepted a pass from Allen, returning it 30 yards to the Chiefs' 42-yard line with 13:20 left. Kansas City went on to drive 58 yards and score another touchdown with Mahomes' 5-yard pass to Kelce, increasing their lead to 38–15 with 7:36 remaining. On their next drive, Buffalo drove 63 yards in 10 plays, including a 27-yard completion from Allen to Stefon Diggs on 3rd and 13, to score on Allen's 6-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah McKenzie; a two-point conversion was unsuccessful, keeping the score at 38–21. Buffalo recovered the ensuing onside kick, and Allen's 34-yard completion to Diggs set up Bass' fourth field goal of the day on a 51-yard kick. Buffalo's second attempt at an onside kick was unsuccessful and the Chiefs ran out the rest of the clock.\nMahomes completed 29 of 38 passes for 325 yards and 3 touchdowns, Hill had 9 receptions for a franchise record 172 yards, and Kelce caught 13 passes for 118 yards and 2 touchdowns – the most receptions by a player in a Conference Championship game. Defensive end Frank Clark had two of Kansas City's four sacks in the game. Allen finished the day 28-for-48 for 287 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception, and was the game's leading rusher with 7 carries for 88 yards.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Bills. The Bills had won two of the prior three meetings, including the .\nTelevision coverage.\nAll playoff games were televised nationally on network television.\nCBS and NBC acquired the rights to the two new Wild Card Round games. The coverage of the rest of the Wild Card round essentially remained the same, with ESPN produced coverage of one Wild Card game and simulcasted it on ABC; and CBS, NBC, and Fox televised each of the other three remaining Wild Card games.\nCBS aired an alternate broadcast for its new Wild Card game on sister network Nickelodeon, oriented toward a youth audience, called by Noah Eagle (son of CBS commentator Ian Eagle) and Nate Burleson, joined by \"All That\" cast members Gabrielle Nevaeh Green and Lex Lumpkin as a booth analyst and sideline reporter respectively. It featured explanations of rules (with Iain Armitage, in character as Sheldon Cooper from CBS sitcom \"Young Sheldon\", making appearances to explain penalties), customized on-air graphics, and augmented reality effects — including Nickelodeon's signature green slime on touchdowns. The telecast received critical praise from fans on social media and sportscasters, including those working for competing networks, on introducing children who otherwise may have never watched a football game before watching a game for the first time.\nESPN also carried additional Megacast broadcasts for its Wild Card game, including the \"Film Room\" on ESPN2 featured extended analysis of plays, ESPN+ carrying \"Between the Lines\" (which included extended analysis from a sports betting perspective), and a \"watch party\" on Freeform (which featured appearances by entertainment and pop culture personalities, and a halftime performance by DJ Khaled from Miami). NBC additionally aired its Wild Card game on streaming service Peacock and in Spanish on Telemundo.\nFox had exclusive coverage of both NFC Divisional games and the NFC Championship Game. Coverage of the AFC Divisional games was split between CBS and NBC. CBS then had exclusive coverage of the AFC Championship Game and the Super Bowl.\nNBC's Mike Tirico and CBS' Tony Romo worked remotely during the Wild Card round after failing to pass their respective network's COVID-19 protocols. Romo returned to the broadcast booth for the Divisional round."

        "text": "The U Sports Men's Volleyball Championship is a Canadian university volleyball tournament conducted by U Sports, and determines the men's national champion. The tournament involves the champions from each of Canada's four regional sports conferences. The Tantramar Trophy is awarded to the winners. \nThe 2024 champions are the Alberta Golden Bears, who have won ten championships in program history. The Manitoba Bisons, Winnipeg Wesmen and Alberta Golden Bears have won the most championships with each school having won ten times.\nHistory.\nThe first championship tournament was held in Calgary, Alberta and featured the UBC Thunderbirds defeating the Mount Allison Mounties 3–0 and the Sherbrooke Vert et Or 3–0 en route to being the first CIAU men's volleyball champions. They were given the Tantramar Trophy, named after the Tantramar Marshes in New Brunswick, which was donated in 1967 by Mount Allison University. While early records are not readily available, the championship has been played as a round-robin tournament at least since 1980. In 1983, six teams played in two pools and then, based on the results, advanced to single-elimination games to determine a winner. In 1985, the current format of full single-elimination games was adopted with eight team competing in the tournament. \nBoth the 2020 and 2021 championship tournaments were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFormat.\nThe championship currently consists of an eight-team tournament, with champions from each of the three conferences, one host (from Canada West in 2020 and 2021), an additional Canada West team, two additional OUA teams, and one additional team from the RSEQ. While the berths for the conference champions and host remain consistent year-to-year, the other four invitees can change based on the host's conference and the competitive landscape in U Sports. The championship takes place over three days and features 11 games, with teams seeded 1–8. Teams are ranked by a committee as well as by the ELO ranking used to determine weekly Top 10 rankings nationally. Conference champions can be ranked no lower than 6th place. The team ranked 1st plays the 8th ranked team, 2nd plays 7th, 3rd plays 6th, and 4th plays 5th in the quarter-finals. To ensure common rest times, teams are not re-seeded after the first round, so the winner of 1v8 plays the winner of 4v5 and the winner of 2v7 plays the winner of 3v6. There is also a consolation bracket to determine the third-place winner (bronze medalist) and fifth-place winner. The gold medal game is the last game played in the tournament.\nResults by schools.\nDue to information limitations, the following table includes all known first, second, and third-place finishes, as indicated above. Prior to 1983, there were no third-place finishes, and the second-place finish was the loser of the championship game. While the Dalhousie Tigers now play in the RSEQ, they had won their medals while playing in the AUS conference, which no longer fields men's volleyball teams."

The defending team was Norway.\nCompetition format.\nThe relay teams consist of four biathletes. Legs 1 and 2 are skied by the women, and legs 3 and 4 by the men. Two variation have this competition. The both gender's legs are or the women's legs are and men's legs are . Every athlete's leg is skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds: one prone and one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually from the spare round holders or from bullets deposited by the athlete into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still standing targets, one penalty loop must be taken for each remaining target. The first-leg participants all start at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five).\nThe single mixed relay involves one male and one female biathlete each completing two legs consisting of one prone and one standing shoot. The female biathletes all start the race at the same time and complete one leg before exchanging with their male counterparts who complete one leg before exchanging again with the female skier who after completing another leg switches again with the male biathlete who completes the race. The rules regarding shooting are the same as in the regular mixed relay."

        "title": "2020 Overwatch League season",
        "text": "The 2020 Overwatch League season is the third season of the Overwatch League (OWL), a professional esports league for the video game \"Overwatch\". The regular season began on February 8, 2020, and concluded on August 23. It was the first season that the league implemented a city-based, home-and-away format, with teams traveling between the global home venues to play regular season matches, making the OWL the first major esports league to feature such a format. However, this format was abandoned on March 31 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and all matches were thereafter played online, with the league introducing three midseason tournaments.\nAn expanded 20-team postseason began on September 3. The Grand Finals bracket began on October 8, with the Grand Finals occurring on October 10. The San Francisco Shock won the Grand Finals over the Seoul Dynasty to win their second straight OWL championship.\nLeague changes announced prior to season.\nSchedule.\nPrior to the 2020 season, the majority of all OWL matches took place at Blizzard Arena in Burbank, California. In the 2019 season, three homestand weekends took place – the Dallas Fuel Homestand Weekend hosted by the Dallas Fuel, the Atlanta Reign Homestand Weekend hosted by the Atlanta Reign, and the Kit Kat Rivalry Weekend hosted by the Los Angeles Valiant – in efforts to test how a completely localized match schedule would work. For the 2020 season, the league adopted a \"homestand\" model. Every team was to host two to five homestands throughout the season. Each team would still play 28 matches and would be responsible for the selection and operation of their respective home venues. In addition to homestands, every team would have been required to host at least three team events for the community in their respective home cities. The season marked the first time that a major esports league featured a city-based, home-and-away format.\nIn the 2018 and 2019 seasons, the Overwatch League equally divided teams into two divisions – the Atlantic and Pacific. With the large amount of travelling that was to take place in the homestand model, the Atlantic and Pacific Divisions were renamed to the Atlantic and Pacific Conferences, and each conference was equally subdivided into two divisions, the Pacific East and West Divisions and the Atlantic North and South Divisions. The smaller divisions were implemented in efforts to reduce the amount of time and money spent on travel.\nWith the large amount of localized play and travel, the season was no longer split into four stages. Instead, a midseason tournament was to be held at the same time as the All-Star Weekend. The tournament would have featured the Atlantic and Pacific Conference leaders as well as the next best two teams, regardless of conference, based on the regular season standings through Week 10.\nRules.\nIn the prior seasons, the winner of each match was determined by a best-of-four map series, with a fifth tiebreaker map, if necessary. The league announced at BlizzCon that match winners would be determined by a first-to-three map series, similar to that of the 2019 playoffs. Activision Blizzard senior director of product strategy and business operations Jon Spector noted that due to the elimination of Stage Playoffs, map differential would be less important, as it is not very likely that many teams would have the same regular season record heading into the playoffs. Every match still begins with a control map followed by a rotation between assault, escort, and hybrid maps. Similar to previous seasons, should a match still be tied after four maps, a fifth tiebreaker map will be played on a control map.\nAfter the announcement of hero pools in \"Overwatch\" for the competitive season starting in February 2020, the league announced that it would adopt the hero pool system beginning in the fourth week of play in March in effort to prevent stagnant metas. Each week, the league randomly selects one tank, two damage, and one support hero from a list of the most played heroes in the OWL from the previous two weeks of play; these heroes are then considered \"banned\" and cannot be selected during that week. Banned heroes cannot be banned in the immediately-following week. The hero pool system is only used in the regular season, and will not be enforced during the midseason tournament, the play-in tournament, and the playoffs.\nPrize pool.\nThe total prize pool remained unchanged at , although the allocation changed due to the discontinuation of Stage Playoffs. The Midseason Tournament champions will win $500,000, the runners-up will win $250,000, and the third and fourth place teams will earn $150,000. The All-Star event will have a prize pool for the first time, with a total pool of $250,000. For the postseason earnings, the Grand Champion team will earn $1.5 million (up from $1.1 million), second place will earn $800,000 (up from $600,000), third place will earn $500,000 (up from $450,000), fourth place will earn $300,000 (down from $350,000), fifth and sixth place will earn $200,000 (down from $300,000), and seventh and eighth place will earn $100,000 (down from $200,000).\nBroadcasting.\nPrior to the start of the season, several of the shoutcasters for the League, including Malik Forté, Auguste \"Semmler\" Massonnat, Christopher \"MonteCristo\" Mykles, Erik \"DoA\" Lonnquist, and Chris Puckett, left for various reasons ranging from dissatisfaction with their salaries to concerns over the new management of the league following Nate Nanzer's departure as league commissioner in 2019.\nYouTube has replaced Twitch as exclusive broadcaster of the league, as part of a deal covering all Activision Blizzard esports events. The company also announced a deal to make Google Cloud Platform the preferred infrastructure provider for its game servers.\nRule and schedule changes due to COVID-19.\nHomestand events.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Blizzard cancelled all four homestand events planned in China in February and March 2020. Four of the teams in the league are based in China, where travel restrictions and quarantines from the outbreak were enacted; the restrictions affected teams that were traveling to China to play matches there. Two of the Chinese teams, Guangzhou Charge and Shanghai Dragons, announced the relocation of their teams to South Korea, while the Chengdu Hunters remained in China. The cancelled matches were originally planned to be rescheduled in Seoul, South Korea during two weekends in March, with some matches being played during Seoul Dynasty's homestand event the same month. However, Blizzard later cancelled all South Korean events in March 2020, including the Dynasty homestand, over concerns of the outbreak. In March, French Health Minister Olivier Véran announced that all public gatherings of more than 1,000 people were banned in the country until April 15; the ban effectively cancelled the Paris Eternal homestand event that was scheduled to be held April 11–12. After the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic on March 11, the Overwatch League announced that it would be cancelling all remaining scheduled live events in March and April.\nRegions.\nFor the March and April matches, the league abandoned the Atlantic and Pacific conferences and instead divided teams into three groups based on geography – Atlantic, Pacific, and China – where teams would only play intra-regionally in an effort to reduce latency. Due to the inequity of the number of games played by each team, the All-Star Weekend was moved to the postseason, while the Midseason Tournament was canceled altogether. On March 31, the Overwatch League announced that they were abandoning the Homestand model entirely in favor of moving matches for the remainder of the season online.\nMidseason tournaments.\nOn April 26, the league introduced the league announced a new tournament structure for the month of May called the May Melee. The league divided the 20 teams into two geographical regions, 13 in North America and 7 in Asia, where teams would only play interregionally. After three weeks of play, the top teams from each region played in their respective regional tournament. Teams earned $5000 for each win in the tournaments (with receiving a bye counting as a win) and earned a bonus win towards their regular season standings for each win after, and including, the quarterfinals. There were no hero pools for the tournaments, and winners were determined by which team won three maps, except for the finals, which were determined by which team won four maps. Following the conclusion of the May Melee, the league announced two more tournaments with the same ruleset for the months of June and July – the Summer Showdown and the Countdown Cup, respectively.\nSeason playoffs.\nOn July 15, the league announced its playoff format for the season. All 20 teams played in the postseason, with teams divided by the same two regions as the three midseason tournaments. The lowest seeds played in regional play-in tournaments. Twelve total teams qualified for the season playoffs split into two regional brackets. In the North America region, eight teams qualified for the North America Bracket, and in the Asia region, four teams qualified for the Asia Bracket. Each playoff bracket is a double-elimination tournament. However, the winners of the upper and lower finals in each respective bracket did not face each other. Instead, they qualified for the Grand Finals bracket – another double-elimination tournament. The winners of the upper and lower bracket in the Grand Finals bracket will play in the Grand Finals match.\nPostseason.\nPlay-in tournaments.\nThe play-in tournaments were two regional single-elimination tournaments that took place September 3–5. All match winners were determined by which team wins three maps. The winners of each first round match advanced to the second round. The teams that qualified for a bye into the second round each selected which opponent they would face between the winners of the first round (or the Toronto Defiant or Seoul Dynasty in the North America and Asia region, respectively). The winners of the second round advanced to the playoffs.\nPlayoffs.\nThe playoffs will be contested by twelve teams – eight from the North America region and four from the Asia region. The top two teams from each region's respective playoff bracket will qualify for the Grand Finals bracket, where the final two teams in the Grand Finals bracket will play in the Grand Finals match.\nAwards.\nRole Stars.\nSource:\nAll-Star Games.\nThe 2020 Overwatch League All-Star Games will be the Overwatch League's third edition of an all-star game that involves the All-Star players of the league. For the first time, the All-Stars will be split into two regions – Asia and North America. The Asia All-Star Game will be played on September 26, while the North America All-Star Game will be played on October 3. Both games will be the culmination of their respective All-Star Weekend, an event that consists of the Talent Takedown, a Widowmaker 1v1 tournament, as well as other various skills challenges.\nWinnings.\nTeams in the 2020 season competed for a total prize pool of across midseason tournaments and playoffs. By League rules, at least 50% of these winnings are split among the team's members, the remaining going to the team's owner."

        "text": "The second round of the qualification tournament for the 2022 FIFA World Cup from UEFA (also known as the UEFA play-offs) was contested by twelve teams from the UEFA segment of qualifying. The play-offs determined the final three European teams that joined the group winners at the World Cup in Qatar. The ten runners-up from the UEFA first round groups participated in the play-offs, along with two group winners from the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League. The teams were divided into three paths, each containing four teams, with each play-off path featuring two single-leg semi-finals, and one single-leg final. The matches took place in March and June 2022.\nFormat.\nThe qualification format was confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Nyon, Switzerland on 4 December 2019. The play-offs depended, in part, on results from the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League, although to a lesser degree than play-offs of the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying tournament.\nUnlike previous editions, the play-offs were not contested in two-legged ties. Instead, the twelve teams were split into three play-off paths, each containing four teams. Each play-off path was planned to feature two single-leg semi-finals on 24 March, and one single-leg final on 29 March 2022. The winners of the final in each play-off path qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The semi-finals were hosted by the six best-ranked runners-up of the qualifying group stage, while the host of the final was determined by a draw.\nThe play-offs were played in single-leg knockout matches. If scores were level at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of extra time would be played, where each team was allowed to make a sixth substitution. If the scores remained tied, a penalty shoot-out would be used to determine the winner. Following approval from the UEFA Executive Committee in December 2019, the use of the video assistant referee system was approved for the entire World Cup qualification tournament.\nQualified teams.\nTwelve teams advanced to the play-offs. Unlike previous editions, all participants were not decided solely on the results of the first round. Two of the twelve spots were allocated to group winners of the 2020–21 edition of the UEFA Nations League.\nSecond-placed teams (all ten advanced).\nThe ten runners-up from the UEFA first round advanced to the play-offs. Based on the results from the qualifying group stage, the six best-ranked teams were seeded, while the bottom four were unseeded in the semi-final draw.\n&lt;section begin=2nd place /&gt;&lt;section end=2nd place /&gt;\nNations League group winners (best two advanced).\nBased on the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League overall ranking, the best two Nations League group winners that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group advanced to the play-offs and were unseeded in the semi-final draw.\n&lt;section begin=Nations League /&gt;\nKey\nDraw.\n&lt;section begin=Seeding /&gt;\nFollowing the completion of the UEFA first round, the twelve teams that advanced to the play-offs were drawn into three paths of four teams on 26 November 2021, 17:00 CET, in Zürich, Switzerland. The following procedure was applied in the draw:\nFor political reasons related to the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russia and Ukraine could not be drawn into the same play-off path.\nThe six runners-up with the best group stage performance were seeded in the semi-final draw, while the remaining four runners-up and two teams advancing via the Nations League were unseeded. The seedings were as follows:\n&lt;section end=Seeding /&gt;\nEffects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nPaths A and B were affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine which began on 24 February 2022, a month before the semi-finals.\nFIFA and UEFA suspended Russia on 28 February, and announced on 8 March that their semi-final opponents Poland received a bye to the Path B final; a request by the Russian Football Union for a temporary lift of the ban was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on 18 March. An initial decision by FIFA on 27 February had ruled that Russia had to compete under the name \"Football Union of Russia\" (RFU) and without its flag or anthem, and play its home matches on neutral ground without spectators. By that point, the football associations of the other three teams in the Path (Czech Republic, Poland, and Sweden) had refused to play any matches against Russia, regardless of location, a stance to which they remained committed following FIFA's initial decision.\nIn Path A, following a request by the Ukrainian Association of Football, on 8 March FIFA postponed the semi-final between Scotland and Ukraine until June 2022, along with the path final. In the interest of preventing further fixture congestion, the other semi-final match between Wales and Austria would go ahead as scheduled in March.\nSchedule.\nFour of the semi-final matches took place on 24 March, and two of the final matches on 29 March 2022. In Path A, one semi-final and the final were postponed to 1 and 5 June 2022, respectively, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The kick-off times were confirmed on 26 November 2021 following the draw. As part of UEFA's scheduling, the losing semi-finalists of each path played a friendly match against each other on the day of the play-off finals.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nPath A.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket A /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket A /&gt;\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=Path A /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Path A /&gt;\nPath B.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket B /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket B /&gt;\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=Path B /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Path B /&gt;\nSemi-finals.\n\"Poland advanced on walkover.\"\nPath C.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket C /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket C /&gt;\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=Path C /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Path C /&gt;\nDiscipline.\nA player was automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:\nOn 17 January 2022, following a UEFA request, FIFA announced the expiration of yellow cards received during the qualifying group stage, thus preventing suspensions in the play-off finals due to yellow cards received in the semi-finals. However, yellow card suspensions accumulated at the end of the qualifying group stage were still carried forward to the play-offs.\nThe following suspensions were served during the second round qualifying matches:\nPrior to their suspension, Russia were to serve the following suspensions in their semi-final:"

        "title": "Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "There have been concerns and controversies about the 2022 Commonwealth Games, which were held in Birmingham, England.\nSelection of venues.\nAthletics.\nIn June 2017, during the preparation of the Birmingham bid for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the Birmingham bid committee proposed to renovate Alexander Stadium and use it for hosting the athletics and ceremonies of the Games. But in August 2017, Ed Warner, a senior UK Athletics (UKA) official proposed the London Stadium in London to host the athletic events while Birmingham and West Midlands to host the rest of the sporting events of the Games. The London Stadium hosted the athletics and the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics as well as the 2017 World Athletic Championships and Para Athletics Championships.\nOn 11 April 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May visited the Alexander Stadium and announced that the stadium would be renovated for the Games at a cost of £70 million. She said that the investment would benefit the local community and the West Midlands region.\nIn February 2019, an official from Birmingham City Council claimed that the refurbished Alexander Stadium would become a white elephant after the Games as no long-term tenant for the stadium was identified. They were also concerned about the funding arrangement of the Games and claimed that spending funds in organizing the Games could put the council into very heavy debt.\nOn 21 June 2019, Birmingham City Council released the images and plans for renovating Alexander Stadium and claimed that it would create a legacy asset for the Perry Barr area in which it stands. The council claimed that the stadium could become the permanent home for the UKA and host major athletics events such as the annual Diamond League stage along the London Stadium.\nOn 30 January 2020, Birmingham City Council's planning committee approved the renovation plans for Alexander Stadium which would cost £72 million. The revamped stadium would also host a range of tenants including Birchfield Harriers Athletics Club and Birmingham City University.\nTrack cycling.\nThe organising committee of the Games confirmed on the day of the Games host city announcement that the track cycling events will be hosted at the Lee Valley VeloPark velodrome in London which is 136 miles (218 km) away from the Games host city Birmingham. They cited the reason that the West Midlands did not have a suitable facility to host track cycling. The Birmingham bid committee had investigated using Derby Arena in Derby to hold track cycling or converting Arena Birmingham into a temporary velodrome but instead chose to use the Lee Valley VeloPark velodrome in London. The Lee Valley VeloPark is situated on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London and has previously hosted the track cycling of the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics as well as the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships.\nThe people of Birmingham and the West Midlands were unhappy with the bid committee's decision as they would have to travel to London to watch the events. In January 2018, a petition was launched by one of the citizens of Birmingham on Change.org, calling for a velodrome to be constructed in the West Midlands for use at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. It claimed that the construction of a venue would help to develop the sport in the West Midlands region, which has a population of 5.6 million people but no indoor velodrome. It also said that velodromes could be used as a multi-sport facility by hosting basketball, netball, table tennis and boxing, as well as staging non-sporting events, such as music concerts. Over 5,000 people had signed the petition within four months from the date of bid committee's decision.\nIn September 2018, an official from Birmingham City Council defended the committee's decision to select the velodrome in London rather than constructing a new velodrome in the West Midlands and also claimed that the decision was reached in consultation with British Cycling and Sport England. They said that constructing a new velodrome would cost £50 million which could have disturbed the Games' as well as the council's budget. Further they added that the bid committee had asked the Origin Sports Group to carry out feasibility work to assess the viability of installing a temporary track to ensure track cycling would be part of the Games. They also continued to explore both temporary options in the city as well as looking at venues within the region, such as Derby Arena. To meet the CGF's venue requirements for hosting track cycling, the seating capacity must be at least 4,000 which ruled out the temporary options that were being explored in the city, as well as Derby Arena. The only suitable velodromes in the country are Lee Valley VeloPark velodrome London, which has 6,500 seats, and Manchester Velodrome, which could install sufficient temporary seating to meet the 4,000 minimum capacity. The organising committee finally agreed with the Lee Valley VeloPark in London to host the games' track cycling events. They also added that the construction of a £50 million velodrome would have made staging the Games, as a whole, an unviable proposition, which he meant that the city and region would have missed out the legacy benefits of new housing, better transport and a repositioned international profile.\nIn March 2020, British Cycling issued a \"Cycling Facility Assessment\" which stated that building a new velodrome in Birmingham was not considered a “high priority” and did not have an adequately stable strategic or business case to support such an investment.\nBudget crisis.\nIn September 2018, it was speculated that the games could bankrupt Birmingham City Council. An audit report revealed that the council had an £84 million debt at that time when vast sums of its emergency reserves were spent. The audit report also stated that the city had spent £116 million in emergency reserves in the previous two years just to run the council and that £52 million in savings were needed for the next complete year. The report also revealed that the council's emergency savings at one point dropped to £72 million.\nIt was decided between the British Government and the council that the government would pay the 75% of the total £750 million cost of hosting the games while the rest 25% would be covered by the city council which is nearly £180 million. While the council was ready to cover the Games' 25% cost, some members of the council believed that covering such cost could put the council into very heavy debt. Some feared that Birmingham, being Europe's largest local authority with an annual budget of £3 billion, could face insolvency in the next few years if its finances were not improved. One of the officials of the Birmingham City Council said that the council's financial position as “very poor” and said the situation was not helped by hosting the upcoming Commonwealth Games. Council leader Ian Ward denied that the Games would bankrupt the authority.\nIn order to avoid to bankruptcy, Birmingham City Council proposed to impose a 'hotel tax', to help pay 25% cost for the Commonwealth Games. A hotel tax could mean charging hotel visitors in Birmingham £1 per night, potentially raising £15 million over three years to help fund the Games.\nIn September 2023, one year after the Games, Birmingham City Council issued a Section 114 notice declaring that it did not have the resources to balance its budget. Although the council blamed its financial problems on the cost of settling equal pay claims, an ex-adviser to the council said that hosting the Games had been \"a challenge too far\" that had left the city in a difficult financial position.\nAthletes' village.\nCost.\nDuring the Birmingham City Council cabinet meeting of 11 February 2020, the council's draft financial plan showed that the Athletes' Village in Perry Barr would not be built within its estimated £492.6 million cost. The financial plan also explained that the cost pressure was due to the \"constrained timescales\" to build the village and hence its expected cost might increase. The Athletes' Village was expected to house over 6,500 athletes and officials during the Games, before being converted into 1,400 homes for the community as part of a long-term regeneration plan for Perry Barr known as the Perry Barr Regeneration Scheme.\nOn 10 March 2020, it was reported that the cost of the Athletes Village would rise to £91.8 million due to its construction cost price inflation and increased demand for building workers, as said by the Birmingham City Council. Due to cost pressures, the bed space requirement of the village was reduced from 6,500 to 6,320. The city council also announced it would aim to lower the additional £91.8 million costs by £25 million.\nReplacement.\nThe BOCCG announced on 11 August 2020 that the athletes' village which was due to be accommodated in the new Perry Barr housing development, had been abandoned. The decision was taken due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown, which had interrupted construction work. Athletes and team officials will instead be housed in three villages, two student's residences at the University of Birmingham and University of Warwick, and another one inside the hotels who are inside at the NEC.\nThe athletes' village was originally planned on the site of the former Birmingham City University campus as part of the Perry Barr regeneration scheme, which as of September 2020 is under construction and was planned to be completed by 2022. The Australian firm Lendlease is constructing the campus at a cost of £350 million The Athletes Village was planned to be home to over 6,500 athletes and officials, and to be converted into 1,400 homes for the community following the Games. It was also the largest infrastructure project directly related to the Games. The campus was designed by the British firms Glancy Nicholls Architects and Glenn Howells Architects.\nSporting programme.\nShooting.\nIn January 2018, the CGF confirmed that Shooting, which is an optional sport according to the CGF constitution, would not feature at the 2022 Commonwealth Games as the organising committee of the Games decided to exclude the sport. This sparked anger amongst the athletes from India and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) as India performed well in shooting during the previous edition of the Games at Gold Coast in 2018 by winning 16 medals, including 7 golds. Officials from the National Rifle Association of India and IOA were unhappy with the decision of removal of shooting and wanted the Indian government to boycott the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Meanwhile, the IOA requested the CGF and the organising Committee of the 2022 Commonwealth Games to include Shooting in the event. On 20 June 2019, during the CGF board meeting in Birmingham, the CGF confirmed that the Shooting sport has been excluded from the 2022 Commonwealth Games as no suitable venue has been found in the host city Birmingham and in the West Midlands region. Later officials from the IOA discussed with the Indian government officials about boycotting the 2022 Games as the organising committee did not add shooting in the Games.\nOn 30 July 2019, an official from the Birmingham 2022 said that shooting was not included in Birmingham's bid and that in September 2018, five sports that were not included in the original bid – shooting, archery, beach volleyball, para table tennis and cricket – expressed their desire to be part of the Games. He also stated that the Birmingham 2022 Board was committed to conducting a review, offering each sport a chance to be included and the process they conducted was fair, logical and transparent and the assessment panel included senior representatives from key Games Partners including Birmingham 2022, Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport; Commonwealth Games England and Birmingham City Council. Shooting scored highly on some of the key criteria and the Panel recognised the submission from the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF), the International Confederation of Fullbore Rifle Associations (ICFRA) and British Shooting (BS). But the Panel determined that the proposed location for shooting at National Shooting Centre in Bisley, Surrey which is 130 miles away from Birmingham, offered very little benefit to the West Midlands, in a Games with a significant proportion of funding coming from the region. Bisley had been used when Manchester staged the Games in 2002. The Panel did offer the opportunity for the sport to submit an alternative Birmingham based proposal – most likely two disciplines in one Birmingham venue – but the ISSF, ICFRA and BS were not ready to submit a proposal that did not include all four disciplines in a single Bisley-based venue. As a result of that review, Birmingham 2022 proposed adding three sports – women's cricket, para table tennis and beach volleyball – all of which could be staged in venues in Birmingham or the West Midlands and could bring additional benefits to the region.\nOn 14 November 2019, officials from the CGF and IOA had a meeting in Delhi to discuss the exclusion of shooting and to find a solution. Afterwards, the CGF revealed that their team would attend the ISSF Extraordinary General Assembly in Munich, Germany in December 2019 to discuss how the sport can be involved in the 2022 Games. The IOA revealed they would wait for the meeting between the CGF and the ISSF before taking any decision on whether to boycott the 2022 Games in Birmingham. Later, the NRAI expressed its commitment to hosting a shooting competition in India before Birmingham 2022 and endorsed the idea of the IOA to allow medals won there to count towards the overall 2022 Commonwealth Games table even though as with the Olympics, a medals table is discouraged in the Commonwealth Games. On 30 December 2019, the IOA announced in its Annual General Meeting in Delhi that they will participate in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and will also bid for the 2026 or 2030 Commonwealth Games.\nIn January 2020, it was proposed that shooting and archery competitions would take place in India some time before the Birmingham Games but count in the medal table. The ISSF and the World Archery supported the decision. It was announced that CGF would review the decision of inclusion of shooting and archery with the Games partners by January or February 2020.\nOn 4 February 2020, the House of Lords endorsed India's proposal to host the additional shooting and archery events for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. On 24 February 2020, the CGF announced that they had accepted India's proposal of hosting the archery and shooting events in India for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, but the two sports will be conducted as a separate event called as the Commonwealth Archery and Shooting Championships, which will be hosted in Chandigarh in January 2022. The CGF also confirmed that the medals won in the championships will be counted in the final medal table of the 2022 Commonwealth Games. The Commonwealth Archery and Shooting Championships 2022 were subsequently cancelled.\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPreparations delay.\nThe Birmingham City Council had found that the preparations of the Games could be affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The council revealed that the Games preparations, which include the construction of the Athletes' Village and the demolition of the Perry Barr flyover, could possibly face unexpected delays, due to a 20 per cent reduction in the workforce.\nSchedule clash.\nThe 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, due to be held from 23 July to 3 August and 25 August to 6 September respectively in 2020 in Tokyo, Japan, were postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The new dates were confirmed on 30 March 2020 by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Tokyo Metropolitan Government and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Other sporting events which were going to be held between 2021 and 2023 were postponed, planned or canceled to be postponed to next year in order to avoid clash with the Olympics and Paralympics. It was speculated that the postponement of the 2022 World Athletics Championships in Eugene, United States and 2022 World Aquatic Championships in Budapest, Hungary, respectively, to 2022 could clash with the dates of the 2022 Commonwealth Games. If the dates clash, then the top athletes from athletics and swimming could miss the Games in order to participate in the World Championships. The CGF was in talks with World Athletics and World Aquatics (FINA) to avoid the clashing of the World Championships with the Commonwealth Games.\nOn 3 April 2020, the World Athletics announced that the World Athletic Championships in Eugene, United States, planned to be held from 6 to 15 August 2021, was anticipated to instead be held from 15 to 24 July 2022. The new dates were chosen in such a way that the Championships does not clash with the 2022 Commonwealth Games and other events. On 4 May 2020, FINA announced that the World Aquatic Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, planned to be held from 16 July to 1 August 2021, was transferred to Budapest, Hungary from 17 June to 1 July.\nBan of Northern Irish gymnasts.\nThe International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) banned Northern Irish gymnasts who represent Ireland, as opposed to Great Britain, in international competition where Northern Ireland does not compete. The decision was eventually overturned.\nDuring the Games.\nBronze medal in women's tandem B sprint.\nDue to the withdrawal of a team in the women's tandem B sprint race on 29 July, only four teams were entered. The third place race, which was advertised as a bronze medal race, was won by Sophie Unwin and Georgia Holt, who were shown on the screen as bronze medal winners. However, when they went to go to the podium, they were told that there were no bronze medals since competition rules state that bronze medals are not awarded in events with only four entries. The team were left in tears and protested by holding an England flag behind the podium, but were told to move by tournament officials. They later posed on the podium wearing bronze medals which they borrowed from Laura Kenny and Josie Knight. Unwin, Holt and their team manager Keith Reynolds were each fined 200 Swiss francs for \"failure to respect the instructions of the commissaire/organiser\". The Commonwealth Games Federation later publicly apologised and returned the money for incorrectly indicating that it was a bronze medal race on the scoreboard and results sheet.\nCrash in men's scratch race.\nIn a men's scratch cycling race heat on 31 July, Matt Walls and his bike crashed over the upper track barrier into the crowd. Serving as a commentator for the BBC and the Guardian newspaper, Sir Chris Hoy said injuries to two spectators could have been prevented by a higher perspex barrier.\nWrestling arena incident.\nOn 5 August, the wrestling session at the Coventry Arena was halted for nearly two hours and spectators were asked to vacate the venue after a loudspeaker fell from the ceiling at the stands destroying some benches.\nHockey shootout controversy.\nDuring the second semifinal of the women's hockey tournament between Australia and India which went into a penalty shootout, Ambrosia Malone failed to score on Australia's first shot and as India's Lalremsiami lined up for her shot, the umpires asked Malone to retake her shot as the timer did not start during her attempt. Malone went on to score off her second attempt and the officiating error was widely criticised. The International Hockey Federation later issued a statement, \"The penalty shootout started mistakenly too early (the clock was not yet ready to operate), for which we apologise.\""

        "title": "1933 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1933 season of Auckland Rugby League was its 25th. The championship was won by Devonport United. This was their fifth title having previously won it in 1913, 1914, 1928 and 1932. The first two titles were prior to their merger with the nearby Sunnyside club when they were known as North Shore Albions, a name they later reverted to. They finished 1 point ahead of runner up Marist Old Boys. Devonport also won the Stormont Shield for the third time following victories in 1930 and 1931. They defeated Richmond Rovers in the final by 12 points to 7. Richmond had gained their place in the Stormont Shield match by winning the Roope Rooster with wins over Newton (29–15), Marist Old Boys (10–0), and City Rovers in the final by 26 points to 14. This was Richmond's third Roope Rooster title following wins in 1926 and 1927. Marist were awarded the Thistle Cup for the most competition points scored in the second round.\nThe Challenge Round trophy (awarded to the team with the best second round competition points) was won by the much improved Newton Rangers after they beat all 5 senior opponents. The Max Jaffe Cup was won by Richmond who defeated Marist comfortably by 31 to 8, and in a charity match to conclude the season Marist reversed this result with a 16 to 5 win over Richmond.\nIn reserve and lower grade competitions Richmond once again shone. The senior reserve competition was won by Richmond Rovers Reserves who finished with a 6 win, 2 draw, 2 loss record. While Devonport United Reserves won the reserve grade knockout competition when they defeated Richmond 5 to 4 in the final. Richmond once again won the Davis Shield with their lower grade teams combining for more competition points than any other club. This was their 11th win in the 13 years that it has been awarded.\nIt was a busy season for the Auckland representative side. They played seven matches for six wins and one loss. Their sole loss came against the South Auckland (Waikato) side who beat them 14–0 at Carlaw Park. Auckland had revenge in their final representative match of the season this time beating South Auckland by 17 points to 5. Their other wins came over Taranaki (32–20 and 25–17), North Auckland (28–13), West Coast (28–22), and Hawke's Bay (47–17).\n \n \nSeason News.\nClub teams by grade participation.\n+ there were company teams representing Amalgamated Theatres (2 teams), Atta Taxis (Cabs), Checker Taxis, City Markets, Railway Locos, Seamen's Union, Victoria United (Markets). There were also House Matches played on Saturdays between business sides including W. Lovett's Limited, Auckland Gas Company, McKendrick Bros, Bycroft's, Miller Paterson &amp; Lees, Australian Waste Products, A.J. Entrican, Star Office, Browne and Geddes, and Auckland Ambulance.\nAuckland Rugby League meetings.\nGeorge Rhodes announced his resignation of the chairmanship due to business commitments which would require him leaving Auckland regularly. He died suddenly near the end of the season and was buried at Waikumete Cemetery. His successor was Mr. G, Grey Campbell, who was a well known member of the City Council, the Transport Board, and other institutions. Rhodes had been chairman of the league for six and a half years. Mr. R. Doble said Mr. Rhodes deserved to be honoured with life membership for his many years service. This was endorsed by several members. Rhodes started out as a groundsman at Carlaw Park in 1921 before becoming the ground superintendent. At the league AGM it was reported that revenue for the year totalled £2,573, of which £1,791 came from gate receipts, £416 from ground rents, £68 from advertising and £45 from subscriptions. The profit was £754 9/3, with £572 1/3 distributed in grant to clubs. After other spending the total profit for the year was £182 8/. J. Carlaw presided over the meeting where over 100 people were in attendance. Mr. J. B. Donald was elected patron, Mr. J. F. W. Dickson was elected vice-president. At the ARL Board of Control meeting prior to the commencement of the season the chairman Mr. G. Grey Campbell said the policy of granting gate percentages to senior clubs should be retained. He said that it was up to the clubs to produce a high standard of play and the percentage to senior clubs would be an incentive.\nNear the conclusion of the season the Auckland Rugby League met and Mr. Campbell said “the gate receipts to date had been in excess of those last season. Clubs had benefited considerably from the percentage granted, and most senior clubs were now in a position to assist their players next season”. The intention was to carefully manage the finances of the league and “to improve the stand accommodation and give players better dressing facilities”.\n\"The New Zealand Herald\" printed an article ‘reviewing’ the season where they wrote of the visiting St George team and the standard of play in Auckland. They also discussed the possibility of Auckland teams touring Australia.\nCarlaw Park.\nIn late April efforts were made to protect players from colliding with the concrete retaining wall on the number 2 field by placing sacks filled with sand bags on the lower part of it. The wall had been built soon before using relief workers during the depression.\nJunior management meeting.\nAt the annual general meeting of the Auckland Rugby League Junior Management Committee on 21 March the annual report (in reference to the 1932 season) was submitted. It stated that there were 1,008 registered players compared with 1,224 the previous season, and 63 teams took the field. The reason for the decline in numbers was put down to the fact that large numbers of people had left Auckland in search of work during the trying economic times. The report then went on to congratulate teams who had won various trophies in the Junior grades in the 1932 season.\nSenior competition.\nIt was decided prior to the season that the reserve grade games would be played before their respective senior teams. This had been requested by clubs as it would help them ensure they had players available for their top side at all times. In spite of this there were no changes ultimately made at all to the scheduling with all senior matches played at Carlaw Park apart from rare exceptions. One reserve grade match was played at Carlaw Park most weekends with the other matches usually played at the nearby Auckland Domain.\nThe Auckland Rugby League decided at a meeting following the first round of the Roope Rooster competition that a new competition for senior teams spread over 5 weeks would take place. With the senior competition having reverted to 6 teams 2 seasons earlier the round robin was over relatively quickly leaving more time later in the season than had previously existed. The matches were to be unique in that they would be of 40 minutes duration with no interval. Most weeks two of the games would be played prior to an inter-provincial match. In the event of a tie the team that had the best for and against record would be declared the winners and a special trophy would be awarded.\nIt was also decided that force downs in teams own in goal and kicks that went dead in goal would be worth points in order to speed up the games. These rules were used in an annual competition in Sydney when there were no representative games on. Newton ultimately won this round and it was a key factor in them being given the opportunity to play against the touring St George team.\nSt George tour.\nIn September the St George team from Sydney toured the upper North Island. St George had finished runner up in the 1933 NSWRFL. Their first match was against the Auckland champion Devonport United team who they defeated 19–8. They then played a midweek match with Richmond Rovers who they lost to 8–13 and then Marist Old Boys who they also lost to 11–25.\nFollowing this they departed on a tour of Rotorua to see the geothermal sites before playing South Auckland in Huntly where they won by 17 points to 5. They then travelled to New Plymouth where they had a 22 points to 14 win over Taranaki.\nSt George returned to Auckland to complete their tour where they played Newton Rangers in a midweek match which they won 30 points to 23, followed by a return match with Richmond on the Saturday. There had been some debate as to who the last match would be played against. Newton had had a solid season putting in some strong performances and they were arguably the most improved side in Auckland. They had also been the first club to request a match with the touring side however the strongest performing sides had all been matched up with St George first and this last match of the tour was only confirmed at the end of the tour. Following the match with Newton the St George team was entertained by the New Zealand Rugby League at a dinner. Tribute was paid to the “sporting spirit” that the team had shown and a “hand-some engraved shield” was presented to the team by H Wamsley who had made it himself. The shield was to be played for in an annual competition between clubs from Sydney and the Auckland Province. Whilst in Auckland several members of the team along with the manager Mr. J. H. Mostyn visited Sacred Heart College where Mr. Mostyn gave an address to the students on football. Following their last match the team departed for Sydney on the Wanganella Ship at 5pm which meant that the match with Richmond kicked off at the earlier time of 2:45pm. Richmond won the match by 5 points to 3. Prior to the match a running race was held between Len Brennan and Bernard Martin of the touring side and several members of local clubs. It was run from try line to try line and Martin won the race by a foot from Adams (Devonport) in a time of 12.15 seconds with Brennan finishing third. Brennan was killed ten years later in 1943 when the plane he was in was shot down over Italy during World War II.\nCarlaw Park.\nAt a meeting of the Auckland Rugby League in the week prior to the start of the season there were several suggestions put forward in regard to Carlaw Park. These were, that the No. 2 ground be available for practice regardless “of the weather, that the stone wall at the end of No. 2 ground beside the terraces should be covered to protect players; that the scoreboard should be raised; that people should be stopped from jumping the terrace fence at the conclusion of the main match; that the transport Board be asked to extend the penny section from the railway station to the Stanley Street stop...”. It was also decided to issue tickets for the admission of unemployed to Carlaw Park, with the official co-operation of the Auckland Provincial Unemployed Association. After it was found that this system was being abused with the tickets being on sold it was decided to charge the unemployed but at a reduced rate of sixpence. Those trying to enter under this system had to produce their unemployment levy book containing an official stamp and a special turn-style was to be used to admit them. All school children up to 14 years of age would be admitted for free.\nIn early August it was reported that the overhead bridge from Stanley Street to Carlaw Park would be completed by Saturday, 5 August.\nAs was often the case at Carlaw Park numerous events were held there in the rugby league off season. A whippet race meeting was held in early December along with cycling races, while on 15 December there was a sports carnival involving cycling, running, and wood chopping events. The wood chopping featured W. M. Johnstone, the champion tree-feller of Australia, and New Zealand's D. Hoey, who was \"recognised as one of the World's best\". The results of the various competitions were published in the Auckland Star.\nRule issues.\nAt a meeting of the Auckland Rugby League Referees Association on 29 May they decided to recommend to the Board of Control that referees put the ball into the scrum at all grade matches, which was something that had been tried out unsuccessfully 6 years earlier. It was felt that “scrummaging was not satisfactory, particularly with regard to hooking and other infringements around the scrum”. Matches on 2 June featured this new rule change and it was commentated from referees that it had so far improved play around scrums and eliminated a lot of whistle. It was however decided at a meeting of the New Zealand Council several weeks later that the practice was to be discontinued after acting on the recommendation of the New Zealand Referees’ Association. It was also noted that a player when falling on the ball in the goal area needed to ground the ball with their hands and it was play on until this was done so. The play the ball rule was said to be being better controlled with the “same command as evident in a boxing match, when a referee called ‘break’ and the contenders were bound to obey”.\nThe League Council advised that the forward pass rule was being ruled incorrectly with players being penalised for being offside when receiving a forward pass. As the players had inadvertently got in front of the teammate passing the ball it was clarified that it should be considered a forward pass only and therefore a scrum rather than a penalty. The board approved of this interpretation and referred it to the Referees’ Association.\nRadio coverage of matches.\nThe Auckland Rugby League decided to forward a motion of protest from Ted Phelan to the New Zealand Government regarding the ban on the 1ZR station. The speaker said that patients at the Evelyn Firth Home and Auckland Hospital “were strong in their protest against being denied the privilege of listening to the station”.\nMidweek competition revived.\nAfter not being played in 1932 the midweek business league competitions returned with eight teams competing with matches held at Carlaw Park. They were Amalgamated Theatres A, Amalgamated Theatres B, Atta Taxis, Checker Taxis, City Markets, Railway, Seamen United, Victoria United. The competition consisted of two rounds, though the second round would be a knockout competition. Ponsonby and Richmond wrote to Auckland Rugby League objecting to any of their players playing for the midweek teams as it would risk their health for the weekend matches. City and Marist supported the objection. The league decided that no senior or reserve grade players could take part in the competition unless they had the permission of the clubs and the Wednesday management group be advised of this decision. This rule was somewhat ignored however and “two prominent players were injured... in mid-week matches and were not available for Saturday's games”. The league decided to enforce the rule that permission must by granted from senior clubs before players were allowed to participate in the mid-week competition.\nAuckland Rugby League prize giving.\nIn a break from previous years where trophies and awards were handed out at the beginning of the following season it was decided to hold the ceremony at the conclusion of the current season. The event was held at the Manchester Unity Hall on 31 October with free admission and an open invitation. Trophies were presented to teams as follows:\nWith Richmond Rovers winning the Davis Point Shield for the highest number of points scored by any club in all junior grades.\nObituaries.\nGeorge Frederick Iles.\nGeorge Frederick Iles passed away aged 39 in Tauranga on 27 March 1933. He was born in Christchurch before moving to Auckland at the age of 18. He played for the Grafton Athletic side in 1915–16 and then for Newton Rangers in 1916–19. He also represented Auckland and New Zealand in the post war period before moving to Tauranga in 1920 to establish a wool and hide export business. He made an attempt to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area but it was short lived and he largely played rugby union where he represented Bay of Plenty against the Springboks in 1921. Iles was also a prominent sprinter, winning races in the North and South Islands. He was survived by his widow and two young sons.\nGeorge Rhodes.\nMr. George Rhodes, former chairman of Auckland Rugby League passed away suddenly on 17 September at Auckland Hospital at the age of 68. He was chairman from 1926 to 1932 and had spent many years at Carlaw Park prior to this as an official on the grounds committee. He had been succeeded by Mr. G. Grey Campbell (the chairman in 1933). He was buried at Waikumete Cemetery where the funeral service was held with a “lengthy cortege of motor vehicles” following the casket. A large number of Auckland Rugby League officials were present, along with representatives from each of the senior clubs. His coffin was draped with the Auckland Rugby League flag.\nSenior grade competitions.\nFox Memorial fixtures.\nRound 1.\nFuture New Zealand representative Alf Mitchell, who was the first ever Samoan to play for New Zealand (in 1935), was knocked unconscious in his first ever game for Richmond. He was taken to Auckland Hospital and didn't reappear in their first grade side until round 5. He had moved to New Zealand from the Pacific Islands in 1928 aged about 18, and was educated at Feilding High School before moving to Auckland in the early 1930s. Ex-New Zealand representative Maurice Wetherill made his debut as a first grade referee in Newton's match with Richmond. Bill (Rauaroa Tangaroapeau) Turei scored his first try for City. He was killed in 1944 fighting in World War 2. A Nathan, a North Auckland rugby representative was also on debut for Newton.\nRound 2.\n Ted Brimble played a magnificent game for Newton in their 16-12 win over City. The two clubs were to amalgamate a little over a decade later.\nRound 3.\nFrank Delgrosso was injured in a tackle in the second half when Ponsonby led 5–3. He was forced from the field and announced his retirement as a result. He had played 15 seasons for Ponsonby and over 180 matches, a record at the time. Newton caused a big upset over Devonport who had won the championship the previous season and would still go on to win the championship again this year. Among the Newton try scorers was Ted Brimble who had played for New Zealand the year prior. For Devonport, Bert Leatherbarrow and Dick Smith scored their tries.\nRound 5.\nA Nathan was ordered off for Newton for striking a Ponsonby player.\nRound 6.\nHoratio Drew for City Rovers was knocked unconscious when he was tackled and was taken to Auckland Hospital in a St John Ambulance. His condition was reported as being satisfactory by the NZ Herald the following day. Francis Herring also left the field injured.\nRound 7.\nDick Smith and Albert Laing both left the field injured in the second half leaving Devonport with just 11 players against Marist. While Newton suffered the same fate with Ted Brimble and Cameron colliding. Cameron went off while Brimble hobbled around for the rest of the match after his knee was kicked in the collision. Neither was able to play the following week.\nRound 8.\nThe win for Marist over Ponsonby was significant for the club in that it was their 100th first grade win in their 15th season in the first grade competition.\nRound 9.\nThe 50 points that City scored in their Round 9 match against Ponsonby was the fourth time that a senior team had hit the 50 point mark in Fox Memorial history to this point. On all four occasions the team to do so was City. In 1920 they defeated Grafton Athletic 66–13, in 1921 they beat Fire Brigade 61–7, and in 1925 they defeated Athletic 57–7.\nRound 10.\n A photograph of the Devonport team was taken before their match with City. Devonport went on the win 17-12 with Kiwi's Allan Seagar (2) and Bert Leatherbarrow scoring tries, along with Horace Hunt, a former Auckland cricket wicket keeper, and Horace Hunt. For City, Steve Watene scored a try, kicked a conversion, and 2 penalties. In Newton's win over Ponsonby, Mortimer Stephens scored 2 tries. He would later sign for St Helens in England.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nAuckland Rugby League made the decision to expand the Roope Rooster somewhat by allowing the leading teams from the South Auckland competition to enter it. Taupiri and Huntly were both drawn to play in the first round against Richmond and Marist respectively. Both Taupiri and Huntly both withdrew from their matches in the days leading up to their matches forcing an emergency committee to redraw the first round matches. The competition took a further hit when the entire first round was postponed due to poor weather. Not only were all the league fixtures not played but all rugby matches also were postponed as was the horse racing at Ellerslie Racecourse.\nThe Ponsonby match with Marist was played at Sturges Park in Otahuhu as a way of promoting rugby league in the area with a charge being made at the ground to gain funds.\nBert Cooke turned out for Richmond for the first time in the season against Newton Rangers in Round 1 of the Roope Rooster after returning to Auckland from Waihou where he had been working.\nCity received a bye after their victory in the first round with Marist and Richmond playing in the semi-final. A percentage of the gate takings from the match would go towards the Auckland Ladies’ Hockey Association which they would put towards the cost of sending a representative ladies team on tour.\nRound 1.\nBrian Riley scored his first ever try for Ponsonby. He had played one match earlier in the season on July 1 after being promoted from their reserve side. He was aged just 18 and would play for New Zealand just 2 years later.\nFinal.\nThe final also doubled as their round 1 match in the Challenge Round.\nChallenge round.\nThe final of the Roope Rooster doubled as a Challenge Round match as well between Richmond Rovers and City Rovers. The other 1st round matches were played on the same day. The match between Newton and Ponsonby which resulted in the unusual score of 1–0 to Newton was protested by Ponsonby. The competition was being played under altered rules with matches lasting just 40 minutes and with balls forced in teams own in goals resulting in 1 point to the opposition team. Ponsonby claimed that the referee “allowed the game to continue after Newton committed a breach in-goal”, and that they should have been awarded a point. It was decided that if the match was going to have a bearing on the result of the competition then the match would be replayed. Newton went on to win the round after they defeated all 5 opponents.\nRound 1.\nCharlie White debuted for Marist. He was a former Northland rugby union representative.\nRound 4.\nThere was no City v Ponsonby match as City were in New Plymouth playing against the Taranaki representative side.\nStormont Shield.\nThe Auckland Rugby League said that the winner of the Stormont Shield would earn the right to play against the touring St George team. Ultimately both teams played them anyway, with the losers Richmond in fact playing them twice. \nSenior Challenge match for the Max Jaffe Cup.\nIt was decided at a meeting of Auckland Rugby League in early October to play a match between Richmond and Marist who had both in the week prior defeated the visiting St George rugby league team (runners-up in the Sydney competition). The match was to find the ‘best club team in Auckland’.\nUnemployed charity match.\nMarist and Richmond agreed to play in the last match of the season where money raised would go to help the unemployed. The game would be controlled by the central committee of the Grey Lynn Unemployed Relief. Prior to the match there would be a goal kicking competition, a 100-yard race involving senior players and the Waterside Workers’ Band would be performing. Des Herring (Marist) won the goal kicking competition, and Bert Schultz (Marist) won the sprint race with McNeil (Richmond) second, and F. Jones (Richmond) third. On 8 November at a meeting of the Auckland Rugby League Board of Control the Grey Lynn Relief Committee expressed gratitude for assistance in the success of the football match at Carlaw Park, as a result of which a considerable sum had been raised for the benefit of needy people in the district.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe point scoring lists are compiled from matches played in the Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster and Challenge Round matches which involved all first grade sides. Kiwi international and future member of parliament Steve Watene led the scoring with 77 points followed by Marshall from Richmond with 67. The leading try scorers were Alf Smith of Devonport United and Bill Turei of City with 11, followed by Arnold Porteous of Ponsonby who scored 9 tries, and Bert Schultz of Marist Old Boys with 8. One of George Mills tries was awarded as an obstruction try which at this time were credited to the player obstructed.\nSenior reserve competition.\nSenior reserve fixtures.\nThe senior reserve grade was typically low scoring compared to the senior grade and many other lower grades. The senior grade averaged 30.7 points per game compared to just 13.4 in the reserve grade. Remarkably the Devonport reserve grade team did not concede a single point in their final 4 matches and only conceded 35 in total across their ten contests. On the other side was the City Reserves who could not score a single point in their last 4 matches and only managed to score 39 points for the season.\nStallard Cup knockout competition.\nDevonport defeated Richmond in the Stallard Cup final.\nOther club matches and lower grades.\nLower grade clubs.\nThe Davis Cup for all junior clubs was won by Richmond Rovers with the following points: Richmond Rovers 171, Marist Old Boys 129, Devonport United 63, Papakura 60, City Rovers 58, Newton Rangers 46, Point Chevalier 46, Otahuhu Rovers 40, Ponsonby United 37, Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers 37, Ellerslie United 37, Mangere 29, Mount Albert United 25, Akarana 25, Glenora 18, Manukau 18, New Lynn 12, Avondale 0.\n2nd Grade (Wright Cup).\nThe final of the Second Grade between Māngere United and Ōtāhuhu Rovers was played at Carlaw Park as the curtain raiser to the Auckland v North Auckland representative match on 12 August. Māngere won by 11 points to 8. Māngere also won the Foster Shield by winning the knockout competition when they defeated Ōtāhuhu 24-8 in the final at Sturges Park in Ōtāhuhu after beating Point Chevalier 15-3 in the semi final. In an astonishing result for the time the Māngere 2nd Grade team defeated Manukau by 98 points to 0. It was rare for teams to score more than 50 points in a match let along run up a score of that size. On September 16 the Point Chevalier side played a special match against a side from Riverhead. Riverhead had not fielded a side since a short lived Riverhead club formed and played several 3rd grade matches in 1916.\n3rd Grade Open (Hayward Shield).\nMarist won the championship. They also won the knockout final when they beat Glenora 13-5 on September 2 after beating Ponsonby 15-0 in one semi final while Glenora beat Māngere in the other semi final 13-3. On August 26 Mt Albert played a friendly match against Ngaruawahia with the result being a 5-5 draw.\n3rd Grade Intermediate (Walker Cup).\nNorthcote won the championship with a remarkable unbeaten season where they scored 346 points and didn't have their try line crossed. They were captained by future New Zealand halfback Frank Halloran who at the start of the following season transferred to Ponsonby along with Walter and John Stockley. Walter played for Auckland in 1936 and 1937, captaining the side on occasion. John was killed in Italy during the war in 1943. The 6 points they conceded came from 3 penalties. Northcote also won the Murray Cup when they took out the knockout competition after beating Marist 6-3 in the final on September 30. Marist had beaten Papakura 12-7 in their semi final. The match between Marist and Richmond on 10 June was played as curtain-raiser to the Auckland v Taranaki representative match with Marist winning 23–0. Manukau A withdrew from the competition after 6 rounds. In special matches City drew with Huntly 10-0 on September 9, and Papakura beat Ngaruawahia 26-10 on October 10.\n4th Grade (Hospital Cup).\nMarist A won the championship with Marist B finishing runner up. Marist A also won the knockout competition when they defeated their B side 24-10 in the final on October 7. The match between Akarana and Newton A was played at Carlaw Park on 10 June as a curtain raiser to the Auckland and Taranaki representative match. Newton won the match 19 to 5. On September 30 the Marist A team defeated Ngaruawahia in a friendly match by 30 points to 11.\n5th Grade (Endean Shield).\nSimilarly to the 4th grade competition where 2 Marist sides dominated the competition, the 5th grade competition saw the 2 Richmond sides head the table with the Richmond B team winning the championship. Richmond B also won the knockout competition when they defeated Ellerslie A in the final on September 16 by 3 points to 0. Several teams withdrew from the competition in the latter stages including Northcote, Ellerslie, New Lynn, and Point Chevalier.\n6th Grade (Rhodes Shield).\nDevonport United were awarded the Rhodes Shield after a 5-5 draw in the last round with the second placed team, Ōtāhuhu on August 19. Previously winners were awarded a banner but a new trophy was awarded following the recent death of former chairman George Rhodes. Ōtāhuhu won the Hammill Cup when they won the knockout competition by getting revenge on Devonport with a 6-5 win on September 16 in the final. They had qualified with a 2-0 win over Richmond a week prior, while Devonport had beaten Manukau 20-0 in their semi final.\n7th Grade (Myers Cup).\nRichmond A won the seventh grade title and were also awarded the Harry Johns Memorial Cup, Walker Shield, Lauder Cup, Milicich Cup, Harcourt Cup, and Myers Cup after winning all 14 matches (including knockout matches), scoring 255 points and only conceding 12. They won the knockout competition when they beat Newton 6-0 in the final on September 9 after a 16-0 win over Richmond B in one semi final, with Newton beating Ellerslie 5-4 in their semi final.\nSchoolboys Grade (Walmsley Shield).\nAvondale won the championship after beating City 6-3 in what was essentially the final on July 29. There were 7 results not reported so the standings are slightly incomplete. Ellerslie won the Davis Cup for the knockout competition with a 14-5 win over Richmond on September 23. Ellerslie had beaten City on one semi final while Richmond beat Avondale in the other. The match between Devonport and Northcote on 10 June was played at Carlaw Park as curtain raiser to the Auckland v Taranaki match. A seven-a-side competition was also run with the matches played at Carlaw Park.\nHouse Matches.\nOn Saturdays several business teams competed in friendly matches. These include W. Lovett's Limited, Auckland Gas Company, McKendrick Bros, Bycroft's, Miller Paterson &amp; Lees, Australian Waste Products, A.J. Entrican, Star Office, Browne and Geddes. Then on September 30 a friendly match was played between National Reserve Ambulance and Auckland Ambulance with the National side win, 16-3.\nOther notable matches.\nIt was common for non senior clubs to request that higher profile matches be played on their suburban ground in order to help grow the rugby league code in their area. Ellerslie requested one such match to be played on the Ellerslie Reserve and on 5 August with the Newton and Ponsonby senior teams, who had both been knocked out of the Roope Rooster the previous week, playing a match there. It was complained during the week following the match that Ponsonby had largely fielded a junior team and the match would have done “harm rather than good to the code”. The Board of Control was going to be asked to have Ponsonby account for the “failure”. The City Rovers team travelled to New Plymouth to play the local Taranaki side and ran out 29–22 winners with Bill Turei scoring 5 tries.\nAuckland representative fixtures.\nAuckland played their first representative match of the season against Taranaki at Carlaw Park on 9 June. It was between Round 6 and Round 7 of the club competition. It was decided not to play the annual inter-island fixture because the cost of assembling and bringing the South Island side would be in the region of 300 pounds and with the depression in full swing it was not considered viable financially.\nAuckland v Taranaki (inter-provincial match: Walmsley Shield).\nAuckland were not at full strength for this match with the Roope Rooster semi-final between Richmond and Marist being played on the same day in Auckland. J Cowley from the Taranaki side broke his leg during the match.\nAuckland v North Auckland (inter-provincial match).\nJim Rukutai was appointed coach for the match and remained in the position until the conclusion of the season. There were however issues with attendance at trainings over the coming weeks.\nAuckland v Hawkes Bay (inter-provincial match).\nThe Hawke's Bay side was coached by Maurice Wetherill.\nAuckland v South Auckland (inter-provincial match).\nClaude List came on for Bert Cooke after Cooke was injured. He was taken to hospital to have his ribs checked but was able to return home the same day."

        "text": "The 2024 European Women's Handball Championship will be held in Austria, Hungary and Switzerland from 28 November to 15 December 2024. This will be the first tournament to feature 24 teams. Norway are the two time defending champions.\nBidding processes.\nFirst bidding process.\nOriginally, there were two bids for the EHF Women's Euro 2024.\nOn 5 September 2017, Russia's bid was the only bid left.\nHowever, later on, when the bids were announced for the 2022 and 2024 EHF Euros, Russia's bid was withdrawn and thus there were no applications left. On 20 June 2018, the day the host was supposed to be confirmed, the EHF voted to delay the awardment of the hosting rights.\nSecond bidding process.\nIn April 2019, the EHF reopened the bidding process. On 20 September 2019, there were 3 new bids.\nThe host announcement took place on 25 January 2020 at the EHF Extraordinary Congress in Stockholm. The winners were Austria, Hungary and Switzerland, who defeated the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia bid, 28–21, in the second round.\nPossible hosting change.\nOn 12 January 2023, the Hungarian government's chancellery minister, Gergely Gulyás, announced that Hungary would withdraw as hosts due to financial reasons. A few days prior, the Austrian Handball Federation was informed by the Hungarians about the decision to withdraw. The other co-hosts, Austria and Switzerland, now wanted to negotiate with the EHF about how the tournament will be held. On 28 January, the European Handball Federation released a statement concerning the issue, and said that they were amazed and surprised with the decision to potentially withdraw as co-hosts. On 16 March 2023, the EHF announced a change to the organisation structure of the championships. Hungary remained as a co-host, but played a reduced part in the hosting of the competition, including the whole portion of the tournament at the MVM Dome in Budapest (one Main Round group and the Final Weekend) being axed and replaced by Vienna. During all the uncertainty, Romania had stated that they would be able to host the tournament if the original hosts could not.\nVenues.\nThe final weekend was scheduled to be held at the MVM Dome in Budapest, Hungary, but later it was replaced with the Wiener Stadthalle in Vienna, Austria.\nExpansion.\nExpanding the competition, to 20 or 24 teams, was first considered on 30 August 2018. The idea was proposed by the Euro Delegation, but the EHF competitions commission strongly opposed the proposal, due to the fact that:\nDespite the opposition from the competitions commission, the EHF received positive feedback from their new commercial partners, Infront and DAZN about the possible expansion. On 15 December, at the EHF Executive Committee in Paris, the EHF decided to examine to proposed expansion further. In January 2019, they had introduced a working group to oversee the possible enlargement. On 5 April 2019, based on the recommendations by the working group, the EHF officially decided to expand the tournament to 24 teams.\nQualification.\n31 teams registered for participation and competed for 20 places at the final tournament. Great Britain withdraw late which would have been the 32nd team. The teams were drawn into seven groups of four and one group with three teams. The top-two placed teams in each group qualified for the final tournament, alongside the four best-ranked third-placed teams, not counting the matches against fourth-placed teams. The qualifiers draw took place on 20 April 2023 in Zürich, Switzerland. Qualification started in October 2023 and ended in April 2024.\nAll 16 teams from the 2022 edition qualified, including North Macedonia who qualified for a major handball competition on merit for the first time since 2012. Debuting in the first 24 team championship are Faroe Islands and Turkey, with the former becoming the smallest nation ever to qualify for the finals. \nCzech Republic return after missing the 2022 edition. The teams returning after long absences include co-hosts Austria (first time since 2008), Iceland (first time since 2012) plus Slovakia and Ukraine, who both return after last appearing at the Euro ten years ago in 2014. Portugal qualified for only their second ever major handball tournament after only participating at the 2008 European Women's Handball Championship.\nDenmark were the first team to secure qualification after defeating Poland in February, while the Danes, Germany, Hungary and Norway all continue their flawless record of making every European Championship.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held at 18:00 CET on 18 April 2024 in Vienna, Austria. The guests for the draw were Norwegian goalkeeper Silje Solberg, Austrian goalkeeper Petra Blazek, Swiss goalkeeper Lea Schüpbach and right wing for the Hungarian national team Viktória Győri-Lukács. The draw started with the teams from pot one being drawn followed by pots two, three and four.\nSeedings.\nThe pots were announced on 8 April 2024.\nPreliminary round.\n\"All times are UTC+1.\"\nMain round.\nPoints and goals gained in the preliminary group against teams that advance will be transferred to the main round.\nMarketing.\nThe official logo was unveiled on 19 November 2022 at the closing press conference of the 2022 edition in Ljubljana, Slovenia.\nThe official ball for the 2024 European Championship come out on 7 April 2023, made by manufacturer and EHF partner, Select. The ball in made of faux leather and is decorated in contrasting red tones with green accents and white areas with the tournament's slogan \"Catch the Spirit\" on the ball aswell.\nThe mascot was announced on 2 April 2024. The mascot is a wildcat.\nTickets.\nFor the matches of the European Championship, tickets are offered by the EHF as a package with several matches as follows:\nOfficial song.\nThe official song was unveiled on 15 April 2024.

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the race was first postponed to 2021 and then again to 2022.\nThe 194 km/120.4 mile route starts in northern Baltimore County at the headquarters of Kelly Benefits, and ends in downtown Baltimore. The race begins with riders navigating the rolling terrain of rural northern Baltimore County while the final, flatter laps loop through Baltimore City, ending at the Inner Harbor. \nThe race is the only one-day race in the United States part of the UCI ProSeries and with the UCI World Tour Tour of California going on hiatus in 2020, it is the highest stature one-day race in the country. This makes the Maryland Cycling Classic the highest level road cycling race in the United States (highest level one-day and tied with overall highest level with the Tour of Utah.)\nThe winner of the inaugural Maryland Cycling Classic on Sunday, September 4, 2022 was Sep Vanmarcke of Belgium riding for Israel-Premier Tech with a time of 4:34:45.

        "title": "History of disc golf",
        "text": "Modern disc golf started in the early 1960s, but there is debate over who came up with the idea first. The consensus is that multiple groups of people played independently throughout the 1960s. Students at Rice University in Houston, Texas, for example, held tournaments with trees as targets as early as 1964, and in the early 1960s, players in Pendleton King Park in Augusta, Georgia would toss Frisbees into 50-gallon barrel trash cans designated as targets. In 1968 Frisbee Golf was also played in Alameda Park in Santa Barbara, California by teenagers in the Anacapa and Sola street areas. Gazebos, water fountains, lamp posts, and trees were all part of the course. This took place for several years and an Alameda Park collectors edition disc still exists, though rare, as few were made. Clifford Towne from this group went on to hold a National Time Aloft record.\nEarly pioneers of the sport.\nTwo early coordinators of the sport are George Sappenfield and Kevin Donnelly, who, through similar backgrounds and the help of Ed Headrick at Wham-O, were able to individually spread the sport in their California cities. Donnelly began playing a form of Frisbee golf in 1959 called Street Frisbee Golf. In 1961, while a recreation leader and then recreation supervisor for the City of Newport Beach, California, he formulated and then began organizing Frisbee golf tournaments at nine of the city's playgrounds he supervised. This culminated in 1965 with a fully documented, Wham-O sponsored, citywide Frisbee golf tournament spearheaded by \"Steady\" Ed Headrick at Wham-O. This highly publicized tournament included hula hoops as holes, with published rules, hole lengths, pars, and prizes; an event in which Walter Frederick Morrison, inventor of the Pluto Platter and Frisbee inventor \"Steady\"' Ed Headrick, was in attendance. In 1965, Sappenfield was a recreation counselor during a summer break from college during which, he set up an object course for his children to play on. When he finished college in 1968, Sappenfield became the Parks and Recreation supervisor for Conejo Recreation and Park District in Thousand Oaks, California. Sappenfield planned a disc golf tournament as part of a recreation project and contacted Wham-O Manufacturing to ask them for help with the event. Wham-O supplied Frisbees for throwing, and hula hoops for use as targets.\nBefore 1973 and the invention of the disc golf target called the disc pole hole, there were only a few disc golf object courses in the U.S. and Canada. Despite having never heard of the International Frisbee Association (IFA) that Ed Headrick and Wham-O had put together, or ever seeing a copy of the IFA Newsletter, Jim Palmeri, his brother, and a small group of people from Rochester, NY, had been playing disc golf as a competitive sport on a regular basis since August 1970, including tournaments and weekly league play. By 1973, they had even promoted two City of Rochester Disc Frisbee Championship events which featured disc golf as the main event. In Canada, beginning in 1970, Ken Westerfield and Jim Kenner played Frisbee golf daily on an 18 object hole course they designed at Queen's Park in downtown Toronto and presented Canada's first disc golf competitions. In California, the Berkeley Frisbee Group established a standardized 18 hole object course on the Berkeley campus in 1970. University of Michigan Nichols Arboretum, Ann Arbor had an object Frisbee golf course designed in the early 1970s.\nAs mentioned above, Ed Headrick designed the disc pole hole in 1976 and it was first featured in the World Frisbee Championships later that year at two Los Angeles parks, Oak Grove and La Miranda. This seminal event was won by John 'Friz Whiz' Kirkland. Wham-O's $50,000 Disc Golf Tournament was significant turning point for disc golf. Held in Huntington Beach, California. The tournament was groundbreaking, first and foremost because of the cash involved, its massive payout right in the title, but also because the competitors had to qualify for an invitation. 72 qualifying events were established around the country, bringing in the best disc golfers from across the United States.\nCreation of the modern game.\n\"Steady Ed\" Headrick and Dave Dunipace are two inventors and players who greatly impacted how disc golf is played. In 1976 Headrick formalized the rules of the sport, founded the Disc Golf Association (DGA), the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA), the Recreational Disc Golf Association (RDGA) and invented the first formal disc golf target with chains and a basket. Dave Dunipace invented the modern golf disc in 1983, with the revolutionary change of adding a beveled rim, giving the disc a greater distance and accuracy. Dave was one of the founders of Innova, a well-known disc manufacturer. In 1982 Ed Headrick turned over control of the PDGA to the players and Ted Smethers to be run independently and to officiate the standard rules of play for the sport.\n\"Steady Ed\" Headrick began thinking about the sport during his time at Wham-O Toys where he designed and patented the modern day Frisbee. Headrick designed and installed the first standardized target course in what was then known as Oak Grove Park in La Cañada Flintridge, California. (Today the park is known as Hahamongna Watershed Park). Ed worked for the San Gabriel, California-based Wham-O Corporation and is credited for pioneering the modern era of disc sports. Ed Founded \"The International Frisbee Association (IFA)\" and began establishing competitive standards for various sports using the Frisbee such as Distance, MTA, TRC, Accuracy, Freestyle, and Guts.\nHeadrick coined and trademarked the term \"Disc Golf\" when formalizing the sport and patented the Disc Pole Hole, the first disc golf target to incorporate chains and a basket on a pole. He started designing the target because he was tired of arguing over what counted as a scoring disc with his friends. He founded the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) and Recreational Disc Golf Association (RDGA) for competitive and family-oriented play, respectively, and worked on standardizing the rules and the equipment for the growing sport. Headrick abandoned his trademark on the term \"Disc Golf\", and turned over control and administration of the PDGA to the growing body of disc golf players in order to focus on his passion for building and inventing equipment for the sport."

        "title": "Venues of the 2022 Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "The venues for the 2022 Commonwealth Games will be based in Birmingham, Cannock Chase, Coventry, Royal Leamington Spa, Sandwell, Solihull, Warwick, Wolverhampton, and London.\nVenues.\nThe following venues were used for the Games:\nNewly constructed and renovated venues.\nAlexander Stadium, Birmingham.\nAlexander Stadium is an international athletics stadium located within Perry Park in Perry Barr, Birmingham. It will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, as well as the Games’ athletics programme.\nThe stadium was first opened in 1976 and became home to Birchfield Harriers, one of the best known athletics clubs in the United Kingdom. In 2011, it underwent a £12.5 million expansion and refurbishment, including construction of a 5,000-seater stand opposite the main stand, taking the total capacity to 12,700. The new stand also became home to the offices of UK Athletics. Since the expansion, the stadium has hosted annual British Grand Prix events, the Amateur Athletics Association Championships, the 1998 Disability World Athletics Championships and, until 2019, regular English Schools' Athletics Championships.\nIn June 2017, during the preparation of the Birmingham bid for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the Birmingham bid committee proposed to renovate the Alexander Stadium and use it for hosting the athletics and ceremonies of the Games. However, UK Athletics Chief Ed Warner argued that the London Stadium, built to host the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, should be used to host the athletic events instead, with the rest of the sporting events being held in Birmingham and the West Midlands, to reduce the cost burden of the Games. Warner’s position was not supported by the UK Government, or anyone else, and on 11 April 2018, then Prime Minister Theresa May announced that £70 million of investment would be earmarked to transform the Alexander Stadium into a world-class athletics venue for the 2022 Commonwealth Games to seat 40,000 spectators. In October 2018, British engineering and design firm Arup was chosen by the Birmingham City Council to redesign the stadium and construction firm Mace chosen to manage the renovation project.\nIn February 2019, Birmingham City Councillor Paul Tilsley claimed that the refurbished Alexander Stadium would become a white elephant after the Games as no long-term tenant for the stadium had been identified. He was also concerned about the funding arrangement of the Games and claimed that spending funds in organising the Games could put the council into heavy debt. Nonetheless, on 21 June 2019, Birmingham City Council released the images and plans for renovating the Alexander Stadium and claimed that it would create a legacy asset for the surrounding Perry Barr area. The council suggested that the stadium could become the permanent home for the UKA and host major athletics events including the annual Diamond League meet, which is currently held at the London Stadium. On 30 January 2020, Birmingham City Council's planning committee approved the renovation plans for Alexander Stadium at a cost of £72 million.\nIn March 2020, the city council appointed the Northern Irish firm McLaughlin &amp; Harvey to redevelop the stadium. The redevelopment was completed by spring of 2022, in time for the Games. The stadium's seating capacity was increased permanently from 12,700 to 18,000 and will accommodate around 32,000 spectators during the Games, with the installation of additional temporary seating. After the games, the temporary stands around the track bends will be removed, leaving the two permanent stands seating 18,000, with the option of extending the stadium for major events such as the Diamond League and UK Championships.\nOn 22 May 2022, the newly renovated stadium played host to its first event, the Birmingham meeting of the Diamond League series, with around 16,000 spectators in attendance. Considered a test event for Birmingham 2022, the meeting was staged successfully and the upgraded stadium received positive reviews from spectators and athletes alike, with Olympic pole-vault bronze medallist Holly Bradshaw describing it as the \"most beautiful\" track and field venue in the United Kingdom.\nSmithfield, Birmingham.\nSmithfield is a vacant site in Birmingham City Centre, bounded by St Martin in the Bull Ring and the BullRing Shopping Centre to the north west, Birmingham’s Chinese Quarter and Gay Village to the south west, and Digbeth to the east. Originally the site of the Birmingham Manor House, Smithfield was established as a trading district by the Birmingham Street Commissioners with the opening of Smithfield Market on 29 May 1817. Predominantly a livestock market at first, Smithfield was expanded throughout the nineteenth century and continued to trade in produce and second-hand goods until the 1960s, whereupon the land was purchased by Birmingham City Council and the majority of the site subsequently repurposed as Birmingham Wholesale Markets, the largest in the UK at the time. In 2018, the wholesale markets were relocated to a purpose-built hub in Witton and the entire Smithfield site cleared in preparation for a huge £1.9 billion city centre regeneration project.\nSmithfield will be transformed into a multi-use venue for the duration of the Games. It will host the beach volleyball and basketball 3x3 competitions, for which temporary stadia of 4,000 and 2,500 spectators respectively are being constructed, and will also be the start point for the men’s marathon, women’s marathon and men’s and women’s T53/T54 wheelchair events. In addition, it will host one of two planned city centre Festival Sites, with giant screens, live and digital performances, and food and beverage outlets, which will be open to the public.\nSandwell Aquatics Centre.\nSandwell Aquatics Centre is the only permanent venue built specifically for Birmingham 2022. It is an indoor facility located in the Londonderry district of Smethwick, Sandwell, containing an Olympic-size swimming pool, a 10-metre diving board with 25 metre pool, a community swimming pool and permanent seating for 1,000 spectators with expanded seating capacity during the Games.\nBritish firm Wates designed the centre and is building it at a cost of £73 million. Funding has come from several sources. Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council is contributing £27 million, with £38.5 million coming from the overall Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games budget. A further £7.6 million has come from Sport England, Black Country LEP, Sandwell Leisure Trust (SLT) and University of Wolverhampton. Construction began in January 2020 and will be completed in time for the Games.\nAfter Birmingham 2022, the centre will undergo redevelopment and will officially open for public use in May 2023 when it will be operated by the Sandwell Leisure Trust. During the redevelopment, seating used for the Games will be removed and new facilities created, including two 4-court sports halls, a 108-station gym, a 28-station ladies-only gym, three activity studios, an indoor cycling studio, a sauna, a steam room, a football pitch with changing facilities, a dry diving area, an urban park and children's playground, and a café.\nExisting venues.\nArena Birmingham.\nArena Birmingham is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in the Westside district of central Birmingham, with a capacity of up to 15,800. When it opened in 1991 as the National Indoor Arena, it was the largest of its type in the country, and is currently the third-largest indoor arena in the United Kingdom by capacity. Each year the venue hosts over 100 events and welcomes around 700,000 visitors through its doors.\nThe Arena is located alongside the Birmingham Canal Navigations Main Line's Old Turn Junction, opposite the National Sea Life Centre in Brindleyplace, and close to the International Convention Centre (ICC) and Birmingham Symphony Hall, which are also owned and operated by the Arena'a parent company, NEC Group. Between June 2013 and November 2014, the Arena underwent a £26 million redevelopment, designed by the architecture practice Broadway Malyan, which included creating a showpiece entrance from the canal-side, three \"sky needle\" light sculptures, a new glazed facade fronting the canal and new pre-show hospitality elements.\nSince 15 April 2020, the Arena has been known as the Utilita Arena Birmingham, although it will revert to its unsponsored name for the duration of the Games. It will host the Artistic Gymnastics competition from 29 July to 2 August and the Rhythmic Gymnastics competition from 4 August to 6 August.\nEdgbaston Cricket Ground, Birmingham.\nEdgbaston Cricket Ground is a world leading cricket ground located in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham. Home to Warwickshire County Cricket Club's eight-time winning and reigning champion County Cricket team, its T20 team the Birmingham Bears, and the Birmingham Phoenix men's and women's teams in The Hundred competition, Edgbaston is also the venue for Test matches, One-Day Internationals, Twenty20 Internationals, and hosted the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2019. With permanent seating for approximately 25,000 spectators, it is the fourth-largest cricketing venue in England. The South Stand (Pavilion), rebuilt in 2011 as part of the Edgbaston Stadium Masterplan, is a multi-tiered structure which holds the Press Box, hospitality suites, players changing rooms, administration offices, Visitor and Learning Centre, the Club shop and banqueting halls, with a seating capacity of over 4,000 spectators, while the Eric Hollies Stand, with a capacity of 5,900 seats, is traditionally the most raucous area of the ground. Edgbaston is reputed to generate the best atmosphere in England for visiting test cricket teams and the men's team's record is the best of any home ground in the country.\nIn January 2021, work began on Phase 2 of Edgbaston's Stadium Masterplan, consisting of a new entrance plaza, car parking facilities and residential apartments, at a total cost of £93 million. In April 2021, the new Edgbaston Plaza was unveiled in time for the Games. It has a total area of , making it one of the largest outdoor community spaces in Birmingham, and is designed to host cultural festivals and events as well as pre-and-post matchday crowds.\nEdgbaston will host the inaugural Commonwealth Games' Women's T20 cricket tournament between 29 July and 7 August.\nSutton Park, Birmingham.\nSutton Park is an urban park located in the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, approximately north of Birmingham city centre. It is one of the largest urban parks in Europe, covering an area of around . The park is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest, and a national nature reserve, consisting of a mix of heathland, wetlands and marshes, seven lakes, and extensive ancient woodlands.\nAmongst a range of annual sport events staged in the park, the City of Birmingham triathlon is traditionally held each July, with the open water swim stage taking place in Powell's Pool, the largest lake in the Park at . Revealed on 27 October 2021, the course for the triathlon and para triathlon events at Birmingham 2022 is similarly designed, with the running leg taking place entirely within the park and the cycling section heading out through Boldmere Gate and onto the streets of Boldmere. Inside the park, a ticketed spectator area will seat 500 amongst a total capacity of 2,000, while spectators for the non-ticketed cycling section of the event will be directed from Wylde Green station towards Boldmere, which is set to be adorned with Commonwealth Games related artwork courtesy of a £20,000 Creative Communities grant.\nUniversity of Birmingham.\nThe University of Birmingham is a public research university located in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham. Ranked amongst the world's Top 100 universities, it is a founding member of both the Russell Group of British research universities and the international network of research universities, Universitas 21. It is the largest university in the UK by student population. The university’s main campus, which occupies a site approximately south-west of Birmingham City Centre, is arranged around Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower (affectionately known as 'Old Joe' or 'Big Joe'), a grand campanile which commemorates the university's first chancellor, Joseph Chamberlain, and is a dominant feature on the Birmingham skyline. The main campus will be the venue for the squash and hockey events at Birmingham 2022, while nearby Vale Village, a parkland site that normally accommodates 2,700 students, will be turned into one of the three separate Athletes’ Villages needed for the Games after plans for a single purpose-built village in Perry Barr were curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor the Games, two international-standard hockey pitches, built in 2017 as part of a £10 million outdoor facilities redevelopment, will be used to stage the field hockey competition. Temporary seating for around 6,000 spectators and accredited guests will be built around the main competition pitch, which has been re-carpeted in advance of the Games. In 2017, the University also opened a new £55 million Sport &amp; Fitness Centre, comprising six squash courts with adjustable walls for larger doubles courts. For the squash competition, the indoor arena will house an all-glass court, featuring more than 2,000 seats for spectators and accredited guests.\nVictoria Square, Birmingham.\nOn 27 October 2021, Victoria Square Birmingham City Centre was confirmed as the official finish area for the men’s marathon, women’s marathon and men’s and women’s T53/T54 wheelchair events. The pedestrianised square, which was formerly known as Council House Square, was renamed on 10 January 1901 to honour Queen Victoria, whose statue stands at its centre. The Square is surrounded by prominent buildings including the Town Hall on its western side, Birmingham Council House on its northern side, 130 Colmore Row to the east and Victoria Square House to the south. The square also features a cascading water fountain designed by Dhruva Mistry and officially unveiled by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1994, incorporating a 1.75-tonne bronze statue of a woman, tall, wide and long, known locally as The Floozie in the Jacuzzi. In July 2015, the failing water works beneath the fountain led to the site being filled with bedding plants and ceasing to function as a water feature. However, in 2021, work began on refurbishing the fountain to full working in order in time for the Games, and on 7 April 2022 the \"Floozie\" was returned to her fully functioning base.\nThe marathon route which ends at Victoria Square consists of an loop which the athletes will complete twice, followed by a section around the City Centre. Starting at Smithfield, the athletes will head south out of the city, past Edgbaston Cricket Ground, into Cannon Hill Park, and complete a large loop around Stirchley and Bournville before returning to the City Centre via Selly Oak. The City Centre section of the route passes through by some of the city's most notable districts and sights, including the Chinese Quarter, Birmingham Gay Village, Hippodrome Theatre, Paradise, Centenary Square and the Library of Birmingham, before continuing north to the Jewellery Quarter and back into the City Core for the final kilometre of the route, passing by St Paul's on the way to Colmore Row, St Philip’s Cathedral, and the finish line at Victoria Square. The looped section of the course follows a similar route to the Great Birmingham Run, an annual half marathon road running event held in Birmingham in October of each year as part of the United Kingdom's Great Run Series.\nOn 4 March 2022 it was reported that the statue of Queen Victoria in the square would be temporarily \"dressed\" by Guyanese-British sculptor Hew Locke for the duration of the Games, as part of the Birmingham 2022 Festival cultural programme which will launch on 14 June. A planning application for the project, entitled Foreign Exchange, was submitted to Birmingham City Council on 20 May 2022. The proposed wrap-around features a two-tonne fibreglass boat metres long and metres wide, containing several \"perspectives\" of the Queen. The proposal, described as a \"temporary intervention\", has caused controversy in some quarters, with the Save Our Statues campaign calling the project “cultural vandalism”.\nCannock Chase Forest, Cannock Chase.\nCannock Chase, known locally as The Chase, is a mixed area of countryside in the county of Staffordshire, approximately north of central Birmingham. It is a former Royal forest and a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The area of The Chase known as Birches Valley is a popular destination for cross-country mountain bikers, with trails including the technically-challenging XC Follow the Dog trail and the Monkey Trail.\nOn 21 May 2022, new facilities were officially unveiled in readiness for the Games, including Perry’s Trail, an off-road blue-graded trail developed by Forestry England, which will form the backbone of the course for the men's and women's mountain bike competition, and a bike play trail called Pedal and Play, which was designed in partnership with British Cycling to inspire the next generation of mountain bikers. Funding for the £1 million legacy project was secured from partners including Sport England, British Cycling, Cannock Chase District Council and Staffordshire County Council.\nCoventry Stadium and Arena.\nCoventry Stadium and Arena is a sport and leisure complex in Coventry, incorporating a 32,609-seater stadium, a arena and exhibition space, a hotel with pitch-side views, a casino, a sports bar, and a retail centre. The Stadium is home to rugby union club Wasps, who took ownership of the facility in 2014, and Championship football club Coventry City F.C., for whom the stadium was originally designed. since its opening in 2005, the stadium has played host to England under-21 and England under-19 internationals, the Women's FA Cup final, Rugby World Cup warm-up matches, 2016 Rugby League Four Nations domestic Rugby League and American football fixtures, as well as 12 tournament matches at the London 2012 Olympics, while the indoor Arena, which has been home to Netball Superleague side Wasps Netball since February 2017, has also staged Davis Cup Tennis, Champion of Champions snooker, and Darts.\nCoventry Stadium is sponsored by Coventry Building Society, which entered into a ten-year naming rights deal in 2021, taking over from previous sponsor Ricoh, although for the duration of the Commonwealth Games it will be known simply as Coventry Stadium. It will host the Rugby Sevens tournament from 29 to 31 July 2022.\nThe adjacent Arena, otherwise known as the Ericsson Exhibition Hall, will host the judo competition from 1 to 3 August and the wrestling from 5 to 6 August 2022.\nMyton Fields, Warwick.\nOn 30 September 2020 it was announced that the Men’s and Women’s Cycle Road Race would be staged in and around Warwick. Warwick is a market town, civil parish and the county town of Warwickshire on the banks of the River Avon, located south of Coventry and south-east of Birmingham, and forming part of a contiguous conurbation of some 95,000 inhabitants with its larger neighbour Leamington Spa, and the town of Whitnash. Warwick was a major fortified settlement from the early Medieval period, the most notable relic of this era being Warwick Castle, founded by William the Conqueror in 1068 and now a major tourist attraction. The town also has an array of historic buildings from the Stuart and Georgian eras. When the hosting decision was announced, Chairman for Birmingham 2022, John Crabtree, said holding the cycling competitions in Warwickshire would increase the Games’ regional reach and the area's picturesque backdrops would help showcase the “rich and varied landscape that the West Midlands has to offer.”\nWarwickshire has a history of staging high-level cycling events, having played host to a stage of The Women's Tour for four years and, subsequently, the Tour of Britain in 2018 and 2019, the latter of which consisted of an uphill stage from Warwick Town Centre to Burton Dassett Country Park. In 2021, Atherstone in North Warwickshire staged the first ever Women’s Tour time trial.\nInitially, the location for the start and finish of the Birmingham 2022 race was reported to be St. Nicholas’ Park, known locally as St. Nick’s, a popular urban park and former meadow land at the southern edge of the town, situated close to Warwick railway station. However, the official start point was later confirmed to be Myton Road at the entrance to Myton Fields, an open grass area on the opposite side of the river to St Nicholas Park, which is sometimes used as an overflow car park and will act as the muster point for the riders prior to the start of the race.\nOn 27 October 2021, the full route for the race was revealed: a circuit around Warwick and the surrounding area which the men will complete ten times () and the women seven times (). Starting on Myton Road, the course heads north over the River Avon towards the town centre, taking in views of Warwick Castle and St Nicholas' Park, before turning left onto Jury Street, past the Collegiate Church of St Marys, Warwick Town Council’s offices, and then onto Warwick High Street, passing by Lord Leycester Hospital on the right. The course follows this road until turning right onto Shakespeare Avenue, before turning left opposite Warwick Racecourse. The cyclists will then head out through the village of Hampton on the Hill and onto the rural section of the course, before looping back towards Warwick via Victoria Park in Royal Leamington Spa, which is hosting the Birmingham 2022 Lawn Bowls and Para Lawn Bowls competition. The final part of the course crosses back over the River Avon, turning right at the roundabout and onto a long straight run down Myton Road, passing by Warwick School and Myton Fields en route to the finish line. The route was described by Warwickshire County Councillor Heather Timms as a “challenging course” that “showcases the historic splendour of the town of Warwick”.\nThe Cycling Road Race is one of the Games’ five ticketless events and up to 15,000 local people and visitors are expected to line the route on Sunday 7 August 2022.\nNational Exhibition Centre (NEC), Solihull.\nThe National Exhibition Centre (NEC) is an exhibition centre located in Marston Green in the metropolitan borough of Solihull, from Birmingham City Centre. Opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1976, and extended in phases between 1989 and 1998, the NEC is the UK’s largest exhibition venue and one of Europe’s leading event destinations, its 20 interconnected halls covering of floor space. It hosts around 500 events each year, attracting 45,000 exhibiting companies and 2.3 million visitors. The venue is owned and operated by parent company the NEC Group, which also owns and operates Arena Birmingham and NEC Arena ICC Birmingham, as well as the NEC Arena.\nThe NEC’s largest exhibition halls will host four sports and two para sports at Birmingham 2022: Weightlifting and Para Powerlifting in Hall 1; Table Tennis and Para Table Tennis in Hall 3; Boxing in Hall 4; and Badminton in Hall 5. The complex will also host a fan park for ticketed spectators, which is anticipated to include giant screens, live commentaries, on-site interviews and a range of cultural performances, along with Have a Go sessions for fans to try out new sports.\nThe NEC is situated adjacent to Birmingham Airport and is served by Birmingham International railway station, to which it is physically connected, along with local bus services. It also sits at the heart of the UK’s road network, and provides 16,500 parking spaces spread around the site, with a free shuttle bus service operating between them. However, Birmingham 2022 have stated that road restrictions will be in operation during the Games and on-site parking will only be bookable in advance, so it is not clear how straightforward it will be to drive to the NEC during this period.\nNEC Arena, Solihull.\nThe NEC Arena is a multipurpose indoor arena located at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) in Solihull, with a seating capacity of 15,685. It was built as the seventh hall of the NEC complex and opened in 1980. Operated by the NEC Group, the venue is currently sponsored by Genting UK as part of its Resorts World brand, but for Birmingham 2022 will simply be known as the NEC Arena. It will host the women's netball competition between 29 July and 7 August 2022.\nOn 9 March 2020, the NEC Group submitted planning permission to Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council to expand the capacity of arena from 15,685 to 21,600, which would make it the largest indoor arena in the United Kingdom. This development would involve the demolition of the existing roof and addition of an upper tier, as well as other works including enhanced hospitality facilities, and external, internal and major refurbishment works. The application was approved on 28 May 2020. However, in June 2020, the NEC Group announced that the redevelopment work would not occur until after Birmingham 2022 due to the ongoing disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nVictoria Park, Royal Leamington Spa.\nVictoria Park will host the Lawn Bowls and Para Lawn Bowls events at Birmingham 2022, with up to 5,000 spectators per day expected to attend. The riverside park's five bowling greens are amongst the best in England, hosting the English Men's and Women's Bowling Championships annually as well as the Women's World Bowling Championships in 1996 and 2004.\nAs part of Warwick District Council's Commonwealth Games project, the venue has undergone a programme of improvements in advance of the event including upgraded playing surfaces for each of the greens, and redevelopment and refurbishment of the Bowls Pavilion and Clubhouse, incorporating enhanced Wi-Fi provision and a new PA system. These upgrades are the focus of a £1.8 million programme of infrastructural and landscaping improvements in and around Victoria Park and Leamington Spa railway station in preparation for hosting the Games.\nWest Park, Wolverhampton.\nWest Park is a urban park located on the north-western edge of Wolverhampton city centre, close to the University of Wolverhampton City Campus and Molineux Stadium. It was opened as the People's Park on 6 June 1881 by then Mayor of Wolverhampton, Alderman John Jones and, following the restoration of its period structures including the conservatory, clock tower and lakeside pavilion, is one of the best preserved examples of a Victorian park in England.\nWest Park will be the venue for the start and finish of the cycling time trials for Birmingham 2022. Ian Reid, CEO of Birmingham 2022, said Wolverhampton was the perfect setting for the time trials, as there was plenty of space and incredible support for cycling around the city, and that it was vital to bring the games to the whole of the West Midlands.\nThe Men’s Time Trial route will depart West Park and wind through Wolverhampton City Centre, passing by the Wolverhampton City Council offices, St Peters Church, Queen Square, and the Church of St John in the Square, before heading south into Dudley town centre via Sedgley. The course passes close to Dudley Castle and Dudley Zoo, Coronation Gardens, the Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council building and Dudley Town Hall, before heading back towards Sedgley via the biggest climb on the course at Moden Hill. The cyclists will then head through Gornalwood and into South Staffordshire, passing Himley Hall on route to the villages of Himley, Wombourne and Gospel End. The final section of the course takes the cyclists across Penn Common and back into Wolverhampton city centre, passing Market Square, before finishing back in West Park.\nThe Women’s circuit, being shorter than the Men’s, will not take in the section through Gornalwood and Himley.\nLee Valley VeloPark, London.\nLee Valley VeloPark is a cycling centre at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, owned and managed by Lee Valley Regional Park Authority. The facility was one of the permanent venues for the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games. Construction of the park’s flagship Velodrome was completed in 2011 at an estimated cost of £105 million and was used for the first time in competition during the UCI Track Cycling World Cup in February 2012. Since London 2012, it has staged the Revolution series, the UCI Track Cycling World Cup and the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. The Velodrome, known informally as \"The Pringle\" due to its distinctive shape, was shortlisted for the 2011 RIBA Stirling Prize and in the same year won both the Structural Awards Supreme Award for Structural Engineering and the Prime Minister's Better Public Building Award at the British Construction Industry Awards. It has a seated capacity of 6,750.\nThe decision to stage the track cycling at Lee Valley was a controversial one, given its distance of 136 miles (218 km) from the Games’ host city. The Birmingham bid committee had investigated using the Derby Arena in Derby or converting the Arena Birmingham into a temporary velodrome, but both options were ruled out as they failed to meet the minimum venue seating capacity of 4,000 set out by the Commonwealth Games Federation. On the day of the host city announcement, the Games’ organising committee confirmed that the track cycling events would instead be held in London. A petition was launched by members of the public calling for a velodrome to be constructed in the West Midlands, but the decision was defended by Birmingham City Council, claiming it was reached in consultation with British Cycling and Sport England and suggesting that a new velodrome, which would cost £50 million to construct, would make staging the entire Games an unviable proposition. In March 2020, British Cycling issued a \"Cycling Facility Assessment\" which stated that building a new velodrome in Birmingham was not considered a “high priority” and did not have an adequately stable strategic or business case to support such an investment. For those who signed the petition, the decision was seen as a lost opportunity to help develop the sport in a region with a population of 5.6 million people but no dedicated track cycling venue.\nThe track cycling programme, consisting of the Sprint/Para-Sport Tandem Sprint, Time Trial, Individual and Team Pursuit, Scratch Race, Points Race, Team Sprint and Keirin, will take place in the Lee Valley Velodrome from 29 July to 1 August 2022.\nChange in venues.\nThe Birmingham Organising Committee changed the venues of netball and rugby sevens events. The netball was moved from the Coventry Arena in Coventry to the National Exhibition Centre in Solihull and the rugby sevens was moved from Villa Park in Birmingham to the Coventry Arena. The former venues of those sporting events were decided during the preparation of the Birmingham bid in 2017 and the latter venues were decided in September 2019.\nLive Festival Sites.\nIn addition to the competition venues, a network of Birmingham 2022 Festival Sites will be established for the duration of the Games. These free-to-enter sites will feature big screens broadcasting live event coverage, concerts, parties, food, beverages, cultural activities and other entertainment.\nCity of Birmingham.\nOn Friday 10 June, it was confirmed that Birmingham City Centre will host two live Festival Sites, one at Victoria Square and the other at Smithfield. The Victoria Square site will throw ‘watch parties’ for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, while Smithfield will host a dance party finale. Both sites will offer a full schedule of event broadcasts and live entertainment throughout the Games.\nThe two City Centre sites will be complemented by seven Birmingham Neighbourhood Festival Sites, intended to give residents across the city an opportunity to “celebrate and embrace the Games” in their local areas. The site locations, announced on 9 February 2022, will be Farnborough Fields, Castle Vale; Edgbaston Reservoir; Handsworth Park; Selly Oak; Sparkhill Park; Ward End Park; and Oaklands Recreation Ground, Yardley. The Selly Oak site will be hosted by Sense Touchbase Pears and will be the Games’ first ever fully Relaxed Festival Site, catering for deafblind people and those with complex needs. It will provide quiet areas, dimmed lighting, audio descriptions, and specialist communicators including British Sign Language interpreters.\nWest Midlands Region.\nNine cities and towns across the West Midlands region will also host live Festival Sites for the Games. Seven of the sites will be in locations which already have competition venues and will be managed by the local authorities in those areas: The Assembly Festival Garden in Coventry, adjacent to Coventry Council House; The Pump Room Gardens in Leamington Spa; Market Square in Warwick; Sandwell Valley Showground in Sandwell; Mell Square and Theatre Square, Touchwood in Solihull; and Market Square in Wolverhampton. Dudley will host a daily roadshow taking in the following venues: Huntingtree Park in Halesowen; Silver Jubilee Park in Coseley; Mary Stevens Park in Stourbridge; The Dell Stadium in Brierley Hill, Netherton Park in Netherton; and Stevens Park in Quarry Bank.\nTwo further live Festival Sites will be established in towns that are not hosting Games events: The Castle Grounds in Tamworth, Staffordshire, and Southwater in Telford, Shropshire.\nSouth East.\nQueen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, will host the ‘Celebrating 10 Years’ Festival Site, delivered in partnership between Birmingham 2022, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the London Legacy Development Corporation."

        "text": "Mark Oluwafemi Williams (born December 16, 2001) is an American professional basketball player for the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils.\nHigh school career.\nWilliams began his high school basketball career at Norfolk Academy. He was invited to the NBA Top 100 camp in Charlottesville, Virginia in the summer of 2018. Williams passed the 1,000 point threshold in February 2019. As a junior, he averaged 19.7 points, 11.2 rebounds and 3.7 blocks per game to help the Bulldogs reach the VISAA state tournament. He was selected to the USA Today All-USA Virginia Boys Basketball second team. During the 2019 Nike EYBL, Williams averaged 14.8 points, 8.9 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game, while shooting 63.8% from the floor. During the Nike Peach Jam in July 2019, Williams averaged 23.5 points, 12 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game while shooting 76.0 percent in two games for the Boo Williams program. Coming into his senior season, he transferred to IMG Academy, which finished the previous season as the GEICO Nationals champions. Williams was named a 2020 McDonald's All-American. On January 31, 2020, he posted 19 points and 16 rebounds in a 64–62 win over Hillcrest Prep.\nRecruiting.\nWilliams was considered a five-star recruit by 247Sports and Rivals, and a four-star recruit by ESPN in the 2020 class. On November 1, 2019, he committed to playing college basketball for Duke University, choosing the Blue Devils over Michigan and UCLA after taking official visits to all three schools. Williams chose Duke in large part due to the possibility for a national championship, and said he wanted to pattern his game after Wendell Carter Jr.\nCollege career.\nFreshman season (2020-2021).\nBefore the start of the season, Williams was named to the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award preseason watch list. On January 30, 2021, he scored 11 points and grabbed 5 rebounds in a 79–53 win over Clemson. On February 13, 2021, Williams recorded 13 points and 5 blocks in a 69–53 victory against NC State.

On March 10, 2021, Williams recorded another double-double of 23 points and 19 rebounds in a 70–56 victory against Louisville in the second round of the ACC tournament. In that game his 19 rebounds set a record for the most ever by a freshman in the ACC Tournament, surpassing former Virginia center and NBA Hall of Famer Ralph Sampson's 18 rebounds against Clemson in the 1980 ACC Tournament and ranking the third highest for a freshman at Duke. Williams earned All-ACC Tournament second-team honors after averaging 18.0 points and 10.0 rebounds per game. As a freshman, Williams averaged 7.1 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.\nSophomore season (2021-2022).\nOn January 5, 2022, Williams scored 14 points and 10 rebounds in a 69-57 win against Georgia Tech. On February 26, 2022, he scored a career-high 28 points in a 97–72 win over Syracuse. Williams was named ACC Defensive Player of the Year as well as Third Team All-ACC as a sophomore. As a sophomore, he averaged 11.2 points, 7.4 rebounds and 2.8 blocks per game. Williams had a very productive sophomore season, his 110 blocked shots ranked fourth-most in a single season in Blue Devil history and his 142 career blocks ranked seventh all time in Duke history. Williams also had a shooting percentage of .721, which ranked the second best in Duke history and was the only player in the country 700+ from both the floor and free throw line.\nOn April 18, 2022, Williams declared for the 2022 NBA draft, forgoing his remaining college eligibility.\nProfessional career.\nCharlotte Hornets (2022–present).\nRookie season: 2022-2023.\nWilliams was selected in the 2022 NBA draft with the 15th overall pick by the Charlotte Hornets. \nOn February 10, 2023, after the team's starting center, Mason Plumlee, was traded, Williams earned his first career start and posted a double-double with 11 points and 12 rebounds in a loss to the Boston Celtics. On February 25, 2023, Williams put up a career-high 18 points and a career-high 20 rebounds in a 108–103 win over the Miami Heat.\n2023-2024 season.\nOn November 10, 2023, Williams scored 21 points and a career-high 24 rebounds, with 15 of his rebounds being a career-high and Hornets record for offensive rebounds in a game, in a 124–117 win over the Washington Wizards.\nPersonal life.\nWilliams was born to Nigerian parents, Margaret and Dr. Alex Williams, on December 16, 2001. His father is a physician with a subspecialty in gastroenterology. Williams has two older sisters, Victoria and Elizabeth.

        "text": "Club de Rugby Santander, known for sponsorship reasons as Bathco Rugby Club or simply as Bathco, is a Spanish rugby team from the city of Santander, founded in 2007. The senior men's first team competes in the top tier of Spanish rugby, the División de Honor de Rugby, and plays their matches at the Ruth Beitia Municipal Sports Complex.\nHistory.\nSince its formation, the club has focused its efforts on the promotion of sport and rugby in particular among the youngest members of society. It currently has more than 180 players, 17 coaches and plays in a total of 9 categories.\nThe club signed a sponsorship agreement with bathroom supplier Bathco for the 2016–17 season, the year in which the senior team achieved promotion to Division of Honor B from the AON Norte league. For the 2017/2018 season, the agreement was extended and the club was renamed Bathco Rugby Club.\nThe club has always maintained a great rivalry with the most successful club in the city of Santander, Independiente RC, a team formerly sponsored by Bathco and one with which they currently share a ground.\nOn 2 June 2019, the club gained promotion to the División de Honor, Spanish rugby's top tier, after defeating CR La Vila in the promotion playoffs.\nTheir first season in the top tier has proved to be a stern test, and as of 29 February 2020, they lie 11th in the table. The club's current predicament has been hampered by its away form: they are yet to win a single game outside of Cantabria. Their home form has seen some bright spots, with handsome wins against CR Cisneros, Hernani CRE, a close victory over Ciencias Sevilla CR and a draw with UBU Colina Clinic from eight games.\nClub colours.\nThe club's home kit is primarily black, with green accents. The away kit is varying shades of green with black and green socks.\nThe club's crest depicts a blue outline seal balancing a rugby ball on its nose. The seal is surrounded by a blue circle, which is itself surrounded by a green ring bearing the club's name. The animal gives the club its nickname, \"las focas\", with \"foca\" being the Spanish word for seal.\nStadium.\nSantander shares the \"Complejo Municipal Ruth Beitia\" with its city rivals Independiente. The site, run by the Santander city council, is a collection of 35 different facilities for various sports. Due to increased local interest, the derby match between Independiente and Batcho on 29 February was played at the El Malecón stadium in nearby Torrelavega. A narrow 27–21 victory for Independiente meant that the side completed a double over Bathco, having defeated them 30–20 in October 2019.\n2018–19 Standings.\nThe 2018–19 season saw Bathco win Group A of the second-tier División de Honor B, winning 20 of their 22 games and scoring an average of over 40 points a game. The club qualified for the promotion playoffs.\nSource: http://ferugby.es/clasificacion-division-honor-b-grupo-a\nPlayoffs.\nThe club progressed to the promotion playoffs, playing two-legged games against the best-placed finishing teams from other regions. They won five of the six games, losing the final to Ciencias Sevilla CR despite winning the second leg away from home. This victory earned Ciencias automatic promotion, and meant Bathco had to play the promotion/relegation playoff with the side finishing second-from-bottom in the top tier.\nSource: http://ferugby.es/calendario-promocion-division-de-honor\nPromotion/relegation playoff.\nPromotion was sealed when Bathco won their two-legged tie against La Vila, the team that had finished 11th in the División de Honor.\nCurrent Squad 2019–2020.\nThe club has a large foreign contingent, with many players notably coming from the Argentinian union. Lock Juan Cruz Guillemaín has even represented Argentina at international level. Zimbabwean Niels Van de Ven, formerly of Dutch club Castricumse RC, is the club captain.\nThe club's coach and assistant coach, Agustín Rodríguez and Luciano Marco, are both Argentinian."

Following high school, he attended the University of Idaho, where he played as a running back for the Idaho Vandals. He was redshirted in 1995 for a broken foot, but returned to play for the team. Following what was at the time assumed to be a career ending injury to his knee during a 1997 game against the Air Force Falcons, he ultimately returned once again to play in his senior season. He graduated in 1998, and set the Vandals career records of 3,929 rushing yards, 51 rushing touchdowns and 765 rush attempts. The records still stand as of 2019.\nOver his college career he was twice selected as a first-team All-Big West running back, and in 1998 he was named Big West Player of the Year. He helped lead the Vandal to a victory over Southern Miss that year's Humanitarian Bowl, receiving the Humanitarian Award following the game. He also received offers to play in the Senior Bowl and the East-West Shrine Game.

Upon his hiring, Razorbacks head coach Bret Bielema stated that, “He excelled at the position as a player and has demonstrated a remarkable ability to connect with his student-athletes and pass his knowledge on to them. He also brings a strong background of recruiting in Texas and Dallas specifically, which is a valuable area for us to have a presence.” During his final year with the Razorbacks, Arkansas defeated the Texas Longhorns in the 2014 Texas Bowl.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nIn 2015, Thomas joined the coaching staff of the New Orleans Saints as the running backs coach, having previously done a training camp internship with the Saints in 2012.

        "title": "1934 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1934 Auckland Rugby League season was its 26th. The senior championship was won by Richmond Rovers who ran away with the title with an 11 win, 2 loss record. Such was their dominance that a 14th round was not played as Richmond had a 6-point lead over their nearest competitor Newton Rangers. Richmond also won the Roope Rooster knockout competition with a 20 to 13 win over Marist Old Boys in the final. Their remarkable season also included the Stormont Shield which they won 21 to 5 over Newton Rangers. This was the first ever time that an Auckland club had won all three senior grade titles in the same season. The Richmond reserve grade team also won the title which was remarkable in that they lost their first two matches before reeling off 12 consecutive wins to claim the title. They also won the Stallard Cup knockout competition when they beat City Rovers Reserves 21 to 9. Richmond also recorded two wins over the touring Western Suburbs side who had won the New South Wales premiership with 18–16 and 10–3 wins. This was easily the strongest set of results of any club at the senior level in Auckland Rugby League's history to this point and arguably to this day.\nThe Roope Rooster competition saw the debut of the Mt Albert and Papakura senior teams playing in a senior A grade competition. Both teams performed meritoriously before Mt Albert went down to Ponsonby 19 to 11, and Papakura lost to Marist 6 points to 3. Both teams then played in the inaugural Phelan Sheld competition which was ultimately won by Newton Rangers.\nThe Auckland representative team had a successful season recording wins over Taranaki by 35 to 8, Northland 19 to 12, and South Auckland by 36 to 16. The season also saw the first ever match for an official Auckland Māori team which played under the name Tamaki. New Zealand Māori rugby league teams had been formed and toured Australia in the 1910s and 20s but none had specifically represented Auckland. There had been club teams in Auckland largely recognised as being 'Māori' teams in the Manukau and Onehunga area since rugby league formed in the area around 1908–1911. During the 1934 season the Mangere Māori team also played several tour matches along with its Auckland competition matches.\n \n \nSeason News.\nAuckland Rugby League meetings.\nAt the annual meeting of the junior management committee on 20 March the report they received showed that the number of players and clubs had increased by over 11% and 14% respectively. Registration fees were an increase on 1932 by £12 4/6. Mr. D. Wilkie was elected chairman, Mr. E. Chapman deputy chairman, while Mr. Mr. W.F. Clarke was elected secretary to replace the long serving and retiring Mr. T.R. Davis. Davis was later appointed as a life member of New Zealand Rugby League, as was Arthur Ball (ex-chairman of the Auckland Rugby League Referees’ Association, and C. Adamson (ex-chairman of the Junior Management Committee).\nThe annual meeting of the Auckland Rugby League was held in the League Rooms, Grey Buildings, on Monday, 9 April. The report presented showed that the balance-sheet figures improved on the previous season. \"The principal of sharing the gate receipts with the clubs competing... has without doubt proved very beneficial in creating the team spirit to improve the standard of play required for No. 1 ground qualification each week-end and also has been reflected in a greater esprit de corps amongst club members, as well as a correspondingly enhanced friendly rivalry between the contestants that in turn excites public patronage to Carlaw Park\". The gate takings were over £400, being available as grants to senior clubs in 1933. The working gate takings were £1,953 12/9 from club matches (an increase of £158). Ground rents of £154 7/ were lower but profits of £196 18/ were recorded from matches with visiting provincial teams. Registered player fees accounted for £99 12/ and this combined with donations and the earlier stated income meant total receipts of £2,636 2/5. Expenditure was £487 17/6 on ground rents, £340 17/2 on maintenance and upkeep of the park and grounds, £175 on staffing grounds and cost to officials, and minor expenses. This meant a balance of £21 4’8 to be carried forward. The profit and loss account showed a surplus of assets valued at £6,415 19/7.\nReference was also made to the services of George Rhodes who had passed away at the end of the 1933 season after many years as chairman of the league. At the annual meeting the following officers were elected: patron, Mr. J.B. Donald; vice-patron, Mr. J.F.W. Dickson; president, Mr. James Carlaw; vice-presidents, Messrs. O. Blackwood, H. Grange, W. Wallace, C. Seagar, R. Benson, C.H. Drysdale, A.E. Laird, John A. Lee, R.H. Wood, R.P. Sharman, J. Donald, Joe Sayegh, J. Lovatt, W.S. Shramm, E. Morton, H. Walmsley, C. Wright, Montgomery and Bagnall; deputy-chairman, Mr. E.J. Phelan; hon. Secretary, Mr. Ivan Culpan; hon treasurer, Mr. James Edward (Ted) Knowling (MBE); delegate to New Zealand Rugby League, Mr. Robert Doble; auditor, Mr. R.A. Spinley; hon solicitor, Mr. H.M. Rogerson; referees’ delegate on the management committee, Mr. William (Bill) Mincham; club delegates, Mr Jim Rukutai and J.W. Probert; hon physicians, Drs. R. Tracey Inglis, Mr. G. Pezaro, F.J. Gwynne and K.H. Holdgate; press steward, Mr. Robert Doble; board of control, Messrs. Campbell, Rukutai, Robert Doble, Lewis Binns, Probert, Bill Mincham, David Wilkie, Ellis, Ted Knowling and Ivan Cuplan; trustees, Messrs. John Stormont, E.J. Phelan, and G. Grey Campbell.\nAt a board of control meeting in April it was decided that unemployed patrons would be admitted to Carlaw Park with the same concession as the previous season provided they produced their levy book regularly and it was stamped by the Labour Department. At the same meeting Mt Albert United applied to have their colours changed from mauve to blue and gold. This was referred to the junior management committee.\nRules.\nIt was reported that in the latest English rule book there was a goal line drop out being taken when teams forced the ball in their own in goal area and that New Zealand would also adopt the rule. It was decided to implement the rule at the start of the second round. After clarifying the interpretation of the law in England it was established that the attacking team needed to stand five yards from the goal-line when the defending side drops the ball out from between its posts.\nContinued dissatisfaction was felt around the policing of the play the ball which caused problems. And late tacking was also said to be spoiling play. The referee committee said at their 21 May meeting that they intended to take drastic action on this matter. At the Auckland Rugby League Board of Control meeting on 23 May chairman Campbell drew attention to the practice of players charging into opponents and using their knees. He said it was a serious offence, not a tackle and not football at all. The referees association took up the matter and said that all senior clubs would be written to and told that such conduct would not be tolerated. As a result of a large number of matches which were late kicking off due to teams arriving late or match officials arriving late or not at all the league pointed out \"that a visiting team could be granted a 15-minute concession in starting and the length of spells could be reduced to 35 minutes each way by mutual agreement between the captains\".\nAt its weekly meeting the Board of Control banned metal sprigs after the Newton club's officials and players complained “strongly” against their use.\nThe senior competition.\nIt was decided that the championship would commence on 28 April and consist of three rounds. However the Auckland Rugby League would reserve the right to select the four leading teams to hasten the find for the champions if necessary.\nThe league promoted the senior competition by taking the unusual approach of naming all the senior coaches and including boastful quotes from each of them in its newspaper advertisements. The advertisement went \"What the Coaches say: Lar Seagar: Devonport will again be Champion and Champion of Champions. Scotty McClymont: Richmond will be hard. The Rooster will be a Champion this year. Duggie McGregor: Nothing can stop Newton winning. Pope Gregory: Marist O.B. will win from the start. The team is in great heart. Frank Delgrosso: Ponsonby will this year produce the finest League team for many a day. Ben Davidson: City Rovers will be the sensation of the season. A team of All Blacks\".\nNewton, Richmond, and Ponsonby all sported new uniforms which were well received after their opening matches.\nCarlaw Park.\nA new stand was planned for Carlaw Park to be built prior to the “next winter season”. It would cost £3,000 and have “concrete foundations and built in wood”. Preliminary architectural plans were submitted by Mr Piper and Mr. Brooker. “The new stand while embracing the present stand, which would harmonise with the main design, will provide seating accommodation for from 2,500 to 3,000 people. It will incorporate the latest facilities for public and players. Teams will take the field from under the central part of the stand”. The stands would also feature a large room for each senior club “fitted with lockers, and hot and cold showers would be a feature of the dressing rooms, which will be built under the stand. Conveniences for the general public will also be provided”. The present grandstand would be renovated and the new build would have “glass fronts and sides, to protect spectators from the wet weather... the work is to be commenced immediately, and it may be completed within two weeks of the opening of the 1934 season”. Work started on the new grandstand on 9 March after the plans and specifications were \"perused by the Auckland City Council, which proposed several alterations with a view to improvement of the building\". The changes were accepted by the trustees of the Auckland Rugby League but it would mean in increase in the contract price to a little over £3,000. It was aimed to complete the contract in May. Mr. E.J. Phelan, a trustee and vice chairman of Auckland Rugby League announced that the successful tenderer was Mr. R.A. Cornish of Newmarket. The architects were Mr. L.S. Piper and Mr. L.E. Brooker who had submitted the initial plans. By 15 March excavation works had been undertaken and were near completion. The board inspected them on 16 March. Ponsonby United donated £150 and it was hoped at the annual meeting that other clubs would also contribute £50 each towards the costs. On 21 April the league arranged practice matches at Carlaw Park with the main match being between Marist and Ponsonby with those teams reserve grade sides playing the curtain-raiser. A charge of sixpence admission would go towards the grandstand funds which was expected to be completed by the following week. Ponsonby defeated Marist by 13–0. The stand ultimately cost £3,500 and as it neared completion the New Zealand Herald published a photograph of it. In order to further help pay for the new stand the league sold 300 season tickets to the new stand which would entitle the purchaser to attend all matches under the control of the Auckland Rugby League this year. The tickets would cost £1 each. A third anonymous offer of £100 was received from a supporter of the code which was gratefully accepted at the Board of Control meeting on 9 May. The new grandstand was to be opened on Saturday 12 May by Governor-General, Lord Bledisloe and the clubs.\n On 12 May the new grandstand was officially opened by Lord Bledisloe in front of 17,000 spectators which was a record for a club match. Following the matches the six senior and six reserve teams \"took up their respective club quarters in the new grandstand... and were delighted with the improved facilities. The Ponsonby Boys’ Band played at the park and the pavilion was thrown open for public inspection\". Lord Bledisloe had said when opening the new stand that \"he had always been a firm believer in the advantages of football, both as a means of developing physique, and in forming character and a sense of discipline. Some 24 years ago on the area which was now Carlaw Park the Chinese, he understood, had cultivated vegetables; to-day the ground was in use for the cultivation of sport and of health and character, which flowed from sport when conducted fairly, honestly and in a spirit of unselfishness. Congratulating the League organisation on its enterprise Lord Bledisloe ventured the hope that the sport would continue and flourish, and be maintained in New Zealand for many years to come\". He went on to say that the \"erection of the new pavilion had provided useful work for about 60 men... and was built of good New Zealand rimu timber. In spite of the new stand and facilities the league still received a letter from Ellerslie United complaining about the inadequate shower facilities at the ground.\nLights were installed in the park later in the season and at the final ARL meeting of the year a vote of thanks was \"accorded Mr F.E. McEwan, the Ponsonby Club treasurer, for his work in connection with the lighting facilities\".\nChairman Campbell's Sydney visit.\nMr. G. Grey Campbell, chairman of the league visited Sydney to meet administrators of the game there. He returned to Auckland on 7 April. He said that there was a possibility that the Sydney University team would make a visit along with the Sydney premiership winners. Campbell said that his visit had shown \"him how seriously the management committees of the various clubs regarded training. They had more control over the players than did New Zealand. The object... was to get the teams on the ground in the best condition possible. They believed that the team \"that gets in first\" gave the others a handicap that took some getting over during the season, and no time and money were spared in preparation\".\nBroadcast of matches from Carlaw Park.\nThe district radio engineer, Mr. L.L. Macey stated that there was \"no ban on the broadcasting of Rugby League football in Auckland\", however the station 1ZB was going to be unable to broadcast matches. The reason being that its application for an extension of broadcasting hours had been turned down by 'Wellington' and as the football was played outside of their broadcast hours they would be unable to carry any coverage. The decision was met by indignation from New Zealand Rugby League and it was decided to strongly protest and follow up with other action. The protest entailed an immediate telegraph to the Postmaster General \"against unfair discrimination at the cost of the many supporters of the game who paid for licenses as listeners...the executive also was requested to communicate with individual members of Parliament on the subject, and the incoming committee was urged to take further action, if necessary, as it was a matter of urgency to the code and to the general public\". 1ZB had applied two months earlier and was ready to begin broadcasting from the opening weekend of matches however the decision not to allow it had occurred in the days prior to the season opening. Rugby Union was going to be broadcast out of the Broadcasting Boards own funds, and soccer was going to be broadcast through 1YA. Chairman of New Zealand Rugby League, Mr. Cyril Sneddon said \"well, it looks as though there is at the moment a ban, or threatened ban, on Rugby League football – just another tilt at the code\". There were many other accusations of \"strings being pulled\" made by delegates from around the regions. It was decided by the Hon. Adam Hamilton, Postmaster-General to arrange for the broadcasting of Auckland League football match results. He advised a deputation that he would ascertain if the service could be fitted in with the programme of 1YA or 1YX at a lengthy meeting on the issue where many voices were heard. Station 1ZB rearranged their Saturday programme so that rugby league broadcasts could be done. They cut out a portion of their Saturday morning programme to make room for the afternoon broadcast of the league. This meant that they did not need to apply to an extension of their hours. The decision was met very favourably by league chairman Campbell who said \"we are very pleased with the result...listeners in the country districts especially will appreciate the action of 1ZB in meeting that has become a widespread demand for the broadcasting of League matches from Carlaw Park\".\nLife memberships.\nMr. T. Davis was elected a life member of the Auckland Rugby League after he had retired. He had served as a delegate for five years, and for eight years he was the secretary of the junior management committee. At the 30 May meeting, Mr. F.D. Ellis was made a life member, he had been on the board and served as treasurer for 14 years. He was resigning due to ill health and moving to Australia.\nHec Brisbane's retirement.\nAt the end of the season New Zealand international and long serving Marist Old Boys player Hec Brisbane decided to retire. He had debuted for Marist in the 1923 season and played for them continuously ending up having played for 11 seasons and made 158 appearances for them, scoring 71 tries. Brisbane made his Auckland debut in 1923 and played for Auckland 14 times, scoring 9 tries and 1 appearance for Auckland Province. Brisbane played 5 times for the North Island where he scored 7 tries in clashes with the South Island. His international debut for New Zealand came in just his second season, in 1924, with his final appearance in the black and white jersey in 1932. In total he played for New Zealand on 50 occasions, including 10 tests and he scored 21 tries and kicked 6 goals, with 5 tries coming in tests. On 27 October his Marist club played a benefit match in his honour against Newton Rangers at Carlaw Park. His Marist side won by 30 points to 21. Brisbane went on the serve on the Marist committee for several years and in 1937 was the sole selector for the Auckland representative team and he held the same role with others from 1938 to 1940. He was the North Island selector in 1938 and 1939. In 1938 he was appointed New Zealand selector with Thomas McClymont, and Jim Amos to choose the side to tour Australia.\nPhelan Shield's debut.\nThe Phelan Shield (which is still competed for today) was first awarded in 1934. It was a \"handsome carved shield\" presented to Auckland Rugby League by Edward John Phelan (known commonly as Ted Phelan), one of the trustees of rugby league in Auckland. The shield was played for by the 4 losing teams from the first round of the Roope Rooster and was won by Newton who defeated Ponsonby in the final by 18 points to 10.\nOrigin of the Sharman Cup.\nOn 20 October, at the Charity Day at Carlaw Park, a \"beautiful silver cup\" was handed over by Mr. J Smith on behalf of Mr. R.P. Sharman. He was the merchandise manager of George Court and Sons Ltd and was being transferred to London, England. He wished to leave \"a happy recollection of his association with league football\" and wished that the trophy should be awarded in \"a competition worthy of its value\". The trophy is still played for today in lower senior grades.\nObituary.\nArthur Carlaw.\nOn 12 November Arthur Carlaw died in Christchurch aged 51. He was a stonemason by trade and the nephew of James Carlaw, who Carlaw Park was named after. Arthur Carlaw was one of the pioneers of the rugby league game in New Zealand and made 20 appearances for Auckland from 1909 to 1913, and 17 matches for New Zealand over the same years. He also played 25 times for Ponsonby United from 1908 to 1913. Carlaw moved to Christchurch in the mid 1920s where he coached and refereed for several seasons. He had been in poor health for \"many years past, owing to having been gassed while in France. He [was] survived by his widow and two young children\".\nWestern Suburbs tour.\nThe 1934 New South Wales champions Western Suburbs club from Sydney decided to tour New Zealand in September/October. Due to the unavailability of a player they strengthened their side with the addition of Percy Williams of South Sydney, and Jack Lynch of Eastern Suburbs. Their first match was with Marist where they won, this was followed by a draw with Newton, a loss to Richmond, a win over Ponsonby, and a loss in the return match with Richmond. They were the fifth Australian club to visit New Zealand following on from visits by University, South Sydney, Eastern Suburbs, and St George. They arrived on board the Mariposa Ship on 22 September before commencing a light training run. Four regular first grade players were unable to make the trip but the manager Mr. J. J. White said the side was strengthened by four substitutes \"who, in the opinion of State selectors, with the ten regular, brought the tourists well up to full strength\". Just prior to the fourth match with Ponsonby a fire broke out at the Nicholls Brothers Limited premise on Stanley Street with the building being extensively damaged. The boys who played in the curtain-raiser ran from the field to collect their clothes from the dressing shed as they feared the fire may spread to the sheds and offices of Auckland Rugby League. Like many teams who toured New Zealand they spent the last part of their trip touring the Rotorua area taking in the thermal attractions. By defeating the touring side Richmond won the Rangatira Shield for the Sydney-Auckland championship.\nFox Memorial Shield (senior championship).\nFox Memorial fixtures.\nThe new grandstand at Carlaw Park was opened on 12 May along with the Round 3 matches in front of an enormous attendance of 17,000.\nIt was decided after Round 13 to cease the championship and crown Richmond champions as they were 6 points clear and embarking on a southern tour rendering any further matches meaningless in terms of deciding the title.\nRound 1.\nCyril Blacklaws of Newton Rangers received concussion and facial injuries and was taken to Auckland Hospital in a St John's ambulance but his condition was said to be not serious. C. Allen of Newton was ordered off for kicking a Richmond Rovers player and was suspended for two playing Saturday's. R. Sellars the Newton wing left the field injured and it was reported 5 weeks later in \"The New Zealand Herald\" that he was still in hospital recovering from his injury. The insurance committee reported earlier that Blacklaws and Sellars would indeed be in Auckland Hospital for a prolonged period but that both players \"were to be covered by insurance\". Frank Halloran debuted for the Ponsonby side after transferring from the champion Northcote 3rd grade intermediate team where he was captain. Walter (Wally) Stockton and John Stockton also transferred from the same team to Ponsonby.\nRound 2.\nHerbert Thompson of Devonport was concussed when he collided with another player. He was taken to Auckland Hospital in an ambulance but his condition was said to be not serious. The solitary try that City scored pushed them past the 4,000 point mark in all senior A championship games stretching back to 1910. They were the first club to achieve this feat.\nRound 3.\nFor the third weekend in a row a player was concussed in a senior match at Carlaw Park and was taken by a St John's ambulance to Auckland Hospital. This time it was the turn of Devonport fullback, and ex-Kiwi Albert Laing. His condition that evening was said to be \"satisfactory\". The matches saw an enormous crowd of 17,000 in attendance which was a record for club games at Carlaw Park.\nRound 4.\nMcLeay and R Purdy were both ordered off for City Rovers in their match with Richmond Rovers.\nRound 6.\nHec Brisbane came out of retirement to lead a Marist side which had been struggling somewhat. He was to play until the end of the season and officially retire for good with a benefit match played for him in October. Eight of their players had refused to play after taking issue over the clubs finances including Des Herring, Gordon Campbell, Claude List, and Wilf Hassan. Hassan then left the club and switched to Marist rugby club. Herbert Thompson was concussed for the second time in the season in his City side's match with Devonport, and taken to Auckland Hospital. One match was played on the Monday which was a public holiday between City and Devonport. In the match between Richmond and Newton, both McNeil and Ted Mincham went off injured for Richmond, then Ray Lawless and Kelsall were both sent off for fighting. Late in the match Ted Brimble must have broken his collarbone but it was not reported for several weeks with him missing 3 matches.\nRound 7.\nIn the Carlaw Park crowd included the members of the jury for the ‘Bayly trial’ which some weeks later saw William Alfred Bayly convicted of murdering 2 of his neighbours. He was hung at Mt Eden Prison on 20 July. The jury were frequently taken on excursions during breaks in the trial which lasted several weeks.\nRound 8.\n Richmond comfortably beat Ponsonby in the main match with past and future New Zealand internationals Alf Mitchell, Ted Mincham, and Cliff Satherley scoring tries for the victors. For Ponsonby their New Zealand international Arthur Kay scored twice, while Gordon Midgley kicked a conversion. For Devonport their player/coach, Allan Seagar scored one of their tries in their 10-6 win over Newton, while Norm Campbell kicked 5 goals for Marist in their 22-13 win over Newton.\nRound 10.\nRound 10 saw the return of Roy Hardgrave to the Newton side after several seasons playing professionally in England.\nRound 13.\nNewton Rangers were undermanned in their match with Devonport with Trevor Hall and Ted Brimble both out suffering from influenza while Claude Dempsey was absent due to the passing of his father.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nHistory was made for the Mt Albert and Papakura clubs when they entered the Roope Rooster competition. It was their first time playing in a first grade senior competition. Roy Hardgrave and several other Newton players controversially transferred to the new Mount Albert club. He had refused to play after being told by the selector to play in the centres, away from his usual position on the wing. Hardgrave was worried it might make it difficult for him to gain another contract in England if he couldn't maintain form in that position. The selector said it was his right to position players. it caused a dispute amount the Newton board with several of them resigning and Hardgrave and other transferring. Hardgrave made his debut for Mount Albert in their Roope Rooster match. The Mount Albert side also featured several of the suspended Marist players who were eventually granted transfers including the Schultz brothers, Des Herring, and Claude List.\nPhelan Shield.\n1934 was the first year in which the Phelan Shield had been played for by senior teams. The four losing teams from round one of the Roope Rooster competition were pitted against each other with Newton Rangers becoming the inaugural Phelan Shield champions.\nStormont Shield.\nRichmond Rovers made history by becoming the first team in Auckland Rugby League to win the Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster, and Stormont Shield in the same season.\nTop Try Scorers and Point Scorers.\nThe point scoring lists are compiled from matches played in the Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster and Phelan Shield matches which involved all first grade sides\nRichmond Rovers tour matches.\nRichmond Rovers embarked on a 2 match tour of Taranaki and Hawke's Bay. J Redwood travelled as their manager. They had made endeavours to travel to Otago and asked for 50 pounds to cover their expenses. They were told by Otago that if they were willing to play a match on a Wednesday before or after their visit to the West Coast they would be \"pleased to arrange a game\". The West Coast rugby league guaranteed 60 percent of any gate takings to Richmond if they chose to tour. Ultimately they only played the two North Island matches. In their match against Taranaki they lost to a goal kicked after full-time. During the match against Hawke's Bay the referee collided with Stan Prentice and received a bad cut above his eye requiring attention from St John's before the match could continue.\nDevonport tour.\nWhile it was described as a 'Northern Tour' in the newspapers it actually only involved one match with the Northland side in Hikurangi. Rugby league in Northland was in its early years and to help promote the code there Auckland sides had travelled there to play exhibition matches and in this case to play the local representative side. Devonport proved too strong winning 17–11 though Northland were missing Bowyer, Vause, and Cunningham from their regular side.\nSenior reserve competition (Norton Cup).\nThe senior reserve grade competition was in its fourth season and was won by the Richmond Rovers club for the third consecutive year.\nNorton Cup standings.\nIt appears that the Round 13 match between Devonport and Newton, and the Round 14 match between Devonport and Marist were not played as it was not reported in the newspapers and the published points tables showed those teams had played less matches.\nLower grade competitions.\nLower grade clubs and finishing positions (with competition points).\nDuring the middle part of the season the Junior Management Committee revised the weight allowances for the junior grades. They were Third Intermediate – 10st 13lbs; Fourth Grade – 9st, 13lbs; Fifth Grade – 9st 6lbs; Sixth Grade – 9st 3lbs; Seventh Grade – 8st 10lb.\nRichmond won the Davis Junior Points Shield competition with the points as follows: Richmond 134, Papakura 94, City 75, Marist 69, Manukau 67, Pt Chevalier 63, Ponsonby 58, Devonport 51, Mt Albert 50, Otahuhu 47, Akarana 19, Mangere 12, Avondale 4\nSecond grade (Wright Cup).\nŌtāhuhu Rovers won the championship by one point ahead of Papakura after only losing one of their 14 matches when they went down 9-0 to Papakura in round 12. Papakura were coached on Wednesdays by former Devonport (North Shore Albions) and Auckland representative Alf Scott. The majority of results were reported but a handful of scores were not so the points for and against is slightly inaccurate in some teams cases. In the knockout competition Ōtāhuhu and Papakura drew 10-10 and in the replay 2 weeks later on September 15 Papakura won 21-5. Papakura went on to win the knockout competition when they beat Māngere United 26-3 in the final at Onehunga. Papakura beat Mt Albert in the semi final 18-5. Māngere had made the final after default wins against Ellerslie and Papakura B, who had entered a side in the competition but ultimately did not field a team. The match was to be the last ever played by the senior Māngere United club side after they played in Auckland competitions from 1915 to 1934. The Ellerslie side struggled throughout the season and defaulted at least 3 of their matches including their round 1 knockout game.\nThird grade open (Monteith Shield).\nRichmond won the championship unbeaten from 13 matches. Glen Ora finished runner up. Teams were given 2 points for a bye following Marist's withdrawal after round 8 hence the wins and point totals not matching in some cases. There were also several scores not reported so the for and against tallies are somewhat inaccurate but the final competition points are correct in each case. Ponsonby won the knockout competition when they beat Glen Ora 8-2 in the final on September 1. Ponsonby had beaten Richmond in their previous match to eliminate the champions, while Glen Ora beat Mount Albert in their semi final 13-5.\nThird Grade Intermediate (Walker Cup).\nMarist won the championship with an extraordinary 43 competition points in one of the longest championship seasons in any grade to this point in Auckland Rugby League history. In doing so they were awarded the Walker Cup. The knockout games at the end of the season also contributed to the championship points. Teams were also given 2 points for a bye as well which explains some discrepancies between win totals and competition points gained. There were many matches that did not have scores reported though the competition points are accurate as they were published in the newspaper at the season end. Marist beat Manukau B in the knockout final on 27 October to also claim the Murray Cup. \nFourth Grade (Hospital Cup).\n Newton Rangers won the championship. Whilst they had been a founding club in Auckland Rugby League they had won very few championship competitions. They were generally competitive in the senior grade from time to time however they typically struggled in the lower grades in the early decades winning very few titles. It was just their fifth championship in any grade through 25 seasons of competition. Newton finished a single point ahead of Manukau and sealed it after a 6-0 win over Marist on September 1. In the knockout competition semi final they beat Marist, while in the other semi final Glen Ora had a 14-11 win over Papakura. In the final Glen Ora beat Newton to achieve their first ever trophy in the clubs history. The same team coached by O. Tuohy would go on to win the championship in 1935. They were captained by R. Rogers who became their manager for the 1935 season. The win-draw-loss results for all sides are accurate however many scores were not reported so the for and against totals are inaccurate aside from Papakura who had every single result reported in the Franklin Times. Northcote withdrew from the competition after round 13 having played 11 games.\nFifth Grade (Endean Shield).\nCity won the championship with an unbeaten season. They also won the knockout competition (Milicich Cup) with a 24-11 win over Richmond in the final on September 22 following a 41-0 win over Ōtāhuhu in the semi final. Richmond had won their semi final over Akarana by 18-2. Akarana had not competed in the championship but entered a team in the knockout competition. They beat Pt Chevalier in the first round. Pt Chevalier had initially entered a side in the championship but withdrew after the first week.\nSixth Grade (Rhodes Shield).\nEllerslie won the championship with a 12 win, 2 loss record, comfortably ahead of Devonport United. They also won the Hammill Cup when they won the knockout final with a 9-6 win over Newton on September 15. Avondale withdrew after 11 rounds. Not all of the scores were reported so the for and against totals are inaccurate however the win-draw-loss and competition points are correct as they were published in the newspapers at the end of the season.\nSeventh Grade (Myers Cup).\nRichmond A won the championship with a totally dominant season, winning all 14 of their matches and most to 0. They also went on to win the knockout competition with a 9-3 win over Richmond B on September 15 after beating City 11-5 in the semi final The Richmond B team had qualified for the final after defeating Devonport 5-3 in the other semi final. Mt Albert withdrew after 10 rounds. Several of the matches did not have scores reported so the for and against totals are inaccurate however the win-draw-loss and competition points are accurate.\nSchoolboys (Newport Shield).\nAvondale won the Newport Shield for winning the championship with a 15 win - 2 loss record narrowly ahead of Richmond who were 2 points behind them. Avondale also won the Ernest Davis Cup for winning the knockout competition when they defeated Marist A on October 20. Marist won the seven-a-side competition (Robert Reid Memorial Shield) which was played once a week at Carlaw Park. Ōtāhuhu withdrew after August 18. There were many results that did not have a score reported however the win-draw-loss and point totals are accurate.\nNotable lower grade matches.\n1934 was notable for the more formal playing of matches between several Māori rugby league teams. The Mangere United second grade club team, made up largely of Māori players as it had been for two decades, played several exhibition matches and the Auckland Māori team was later formed and played several matches.\nA sub-league was formed at Tuakau at the beginning of the season. These teams met twice. The first resulted in an 11–10 win to the Māngere team 11–10 in Tuakau on 4 May. Tuakau returned the favour by beating the Auckland side 12–11 in a match played as curtain-raiser to the Auckland v Taranaki representative match. Māngere also played a Lower Waikato side. Later in the season the Mt Albert side travelled to Tuakau to play a match. And then on 8 September a trial match was played by the Waikato Māori selectors with a combined Tuakau-Waikato Māori side selected by Ernie Asher at Sturges Park in Otahuhu against the local Otahuhu Rovers side.\nAuckland representative season.\nThe Auckland selectors for the season were William Mincham (Ted Mincham's father), who had played for Auckland in the 1910s, Bert Avery, and Ernie Asher. The first representative fixture of the season was played against Taranaki with Lou Hutt being appointed captain. The Taranaki team was being picked by Frank Delgrosso. In the match with Northland Roy Hardgrave played his first representative match in New Zealand since his return from playing for St Helens in England.\nAuckland v Northland (inter-provincial).\n Northland started strongly with international Ted Meyer scoring a try and with another to R White who had transferred to Northland from City Rovers during the season. They pushed out to a 10-0 lead with a conversion and penalty to Claude Hamilton. Auckland came back with tries to Brian Riley and Vincent Axmann before Northland retook the lead late with another penalty to Hamilton. Auckland then dominated the final stages to score twice (Stan Clark and Trevor Hall) to take out the match.\nTamaki (Auckland Māori) representative team.\nFor the first time a recognised Māori representative team from Auckland played matches. They played against South Waikato Māori, Taranaki Māori, and Waikato Māori winning two and drawing one match. The origins of the team partly began with a letter sent to Mr G, Grey Campbell in late July by Rev. W.N. Panapa (secretary) of the organisation proposing a Tamaki team, \"representative of the isthmus between Auckland and Onehunga\" to challenge for the Waitangi Māori Shield. It was also reported that a Māori board of control had been set up in Auckland \"with a view to encouraging friendly rivalry between different tribes\". Their first match was against South Waikato Māori at Carlaw Park which they won easily 36–13. They then travelled to New Plymouth to play Taranaki Māori for the newly created Waitangi Shield. Stan Rickards (president of the Mangere club, and chairman of Auckland Māori Rugby League) travelled as the team manager with Ernie Asher representing the Auckland Rugby League on the trip. They won it with a comfortable victory 32–5. Two weeks later they took the shield to Huntly where they played Waikato Māori as part of the celebrations for the coronation of Māori King Korokī Mahuta. They held on to the shield with a hard-fought 5–5 draw. Their final match of the season was on a league football charity day at Carlaw Park where they took on the Auckland Colt side and went down 29–12.\nTamaki (Auckland Māori) representative matches played and scorers.\nThere were 4 matches played by the team but the team list was not printed for the side that toured Taranaki so only those who scored points in the match are known. The following players were part of the touring squad but not named in the match report and they may have played: B Paul, Bill Turei, B Roberts, P Kautoa, L Wilson, P Rewha, A Kelsall, P Daniels, T Rau, K Rawiri, G Heri. Steve Watene played in all 4 matches and top scored with 22 points. D Hira was the top try scorer with 5, 4 of them coming in the match with the Auckland Colts."

        "text": "The 2020 African U-17 Women's World Cup Qualifying Tournament was the 7th edition of the African U-17 Women's World Cup Qualifying Tournament, the biennial international youth football competition organised by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to determine which women's under-17 national teams from Africa qualify for the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. Players born on or after 1 January 2003 were eligible to compete in the tournament.\nThree teams would have qualified from this tournament for the 2021 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup (originally 2020 but postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic) in India as the CAF representatives. However, FIFA announced on 17 November 2020 that this edition of the World Cup would be cancelled. As a result, all remaining qualifying matches were cancelled.\nDraw.\nA total of 20 (out of 54) CAF member national teams entered the qualifying rounds. The draw was held on 10 May 2020 at the CAF headquarters in Cairo, Egypt.\nFormat.\nQualification ties were played on a home-and-away two-legged basis. If the aggregate score was tied after the second leg, the away goals rule was applied, and if still tied, the penalty shoot-out (no extra time) was used to determine the winner.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule of the qualifying rounds was as follows.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, all second round matches, originally scheduled for 1–3 and 8–10 May 2020, had been postponed until further notice.

        "text": "Bill Oliver (born 3 December 1948) is an English former professional snooker player.\nBiography.\nBill Oliver was born on 1 December 1948. As an amateur player, Oliver beat Ian Williamson 7–5 in the final of the 1981 Pontins Autumn Open. He became a professional snooker player in 1983 but never reached the last-16 of a major tournament. His highest ranking was 77. He owns a snooker club in Plymouth.\nHe made his television debut as a player in the 1984 World Doubles Championship, partnering Roger Bales in a 4–5 loss to Terry Griffiths and John Parrott in a match that finished at 12:30 am.\nOliver beat former champion Ray Reardon in the second qualifying round of the 1988 World Snooker Championship. Later that year he joined the board of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), taking the place of Rex Williams. In September 1990 he withdrew from the 1990 Shoot-Out after the car he was driving to the venue skidded and went off the road into a ditch. Oliver required 15 stitches and had to wear a neck brace, but his passenger Mike Hallett was uninjured.\nHe entered the 2010 World Snooker Championship under an arrangement where members of the WPBSA who were not on the main World Snooker Tour could participate if they paid a fee of £200. He was beaten 1–5 by Nic Barrow in what was Oliver's first world championship match since 1994."

Later, Newell was named to the 2018-19 All-USCHO First Team, selected as a Hobey Baker Award Top 10 Finalist alongside teammate Jimmy Schuldt, and chosen for the CM/AHCA All-America First Team.\nProfessional.\nOn March 31, 2019, Newell's collegiate career ended when he signed a three year entry level contract with the New York Rangers. A few days later, he signed an Amateur Tryout agreement with the Rangers American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. He made his professional debut on April 4 in a 5-2 loss to the Springfield Thunderbirds.\nFollowing the completion of his entry-level contract with the Rangers, Newell having played primarily with affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, was released as a free agent. On August 20, 2021, Newell embarked on a career abroad by agreeing to a one-year contract with Norwegian club, Stjernen Hockey of the Eliteserien."

        "text": "The U Sports Women's Volleyball Championship is a Canadian university volleyball tournament conducted by U Sports, and determines the women's national champion. The tournament involves the champions from each of Canada's four regional sports conferences. The championship trophy, first awarded in 1977, features a two-wheeled oxcart, symbolizing the pioneer era on the Red River in Manitoba. The 2024 champions are the UBC Thunderbirds who have also won the most championships with a total of 14, including six in a row from 2008 to 2013.\nHistory.\nWhile intercollegiate volleyball had been played in Canada since 1947, championships had been played for conference titles only. In 1969, the Canadian Women's Interuniversity Athletic Union (CWIAU) was formed (a precursor to today's U Sports organization) to provide a regulatory body for national competition. For the 1969–1970 season, the Calgary Dinos were named the first unofficial champions. The first official champions were the Manitoba Bisonettes, who were crowned following the 1970–1971 season after they defeated the Toronto Varsity Blues in four sets. While full historical championship results are not readily available, the championship was initially a round-robin tournament where the teams with the best records would then play for the championship. This was changed for the 1983 championship when the tournament changed to single-elimination. The 2020 and 2021 championship tournaments were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFormat.\nThe championship currently consists of an eight-team tournament, with champions from each of the four conferences, one host, an additional OUA team, and two additional Canada West teams. While the berths for the conference champions and host remain consistent year-to-year, the other three invitees can change based on the host's conference and the competitive landscape in U Sports. The championship takes place over three days and features 11 games, with teams seeded 1–8. Teams are ranked by a committee as well as by the ELO ranking used to determine weekly Top 10 rankings nationally. Conference champions can be ranked no lower than 6th place. The team ranked 1st plays the 8th ranked team, 2nd plays 7th, 3rd plays 6th, and 4th plays 5th in the quarter-finals. To ensure common rest times, teams are not re-seeded after the first round, so the winner of 1v8 plays the winner of 4v5 and the winner of 2v7 plays the winner of 3v6. There is also a consolation bracket to determine the third-place winner (bronze medalist) and fifth-place winner. The gold medal game is the last game played in the tournament.\nResults by schools.\nThe following table includes all known first, second, and third-place finishes, as indicated above. Prior to 1983, there were no third-place finishes, and the second-place finish was the loser of the championship game."

        "text": "Brad Lambert (born 19 December 2003) is a Finnish-Canadian professional ice hockey forward currently playing for the Manitoba Moose in the American Hockey League (AHL) as a prospect to the Winnipeg Jets of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted 30th overall by the Jets in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nOn 13 December 2019, 15 year old Lambert made his professional debut for HIFK of the SM-liiga, the top league in Finland. Following the season, in which he scored 38 points in 42 games with HIFK's U20 club and two points in four games with their senior club, Lambert exercised a contractual option to leave the organization.\nOn 8 May 2020, Lambert signed a two-year contract with Finnish club JYP Jyväskylä. He would score 15 points in 46 games in the 2020–21 season, leading all under-18 players.\nEntering the 2021–22 season, Lambert was considered one of the top prospects for the upcoming 2022 NHL Entry Draft, ranked as high as second overall by some scouts. After a disastrous start to the season that saw him score only six points in 24 games, Lambert's contract was terminated by mutual agreement and he signed with his hometown club, the Lahti Pelicans. In Lahti, his production stalled even further, to just four points in 25 games. Following this tumultuous and disappointing season, he fell in the draft until he was selected by the Winnipeg Jets in the first round, 30th overall.\nIn June 2022, despite never playing a game in the league and all signs pointing to him playing at the professional level upon arriving in North America, the Seattle Thunderbirds acquired Lambert's Western Hockey League (WHL) rights from the Saskatoon Blades in exchange for draft picks.\nLambert attended Jets training camp prior to the 2022–23 season. On 12 October 2022, he was signed to a three-year entry-level contract and assigned to the Jets' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. After 14 games with the Moose in which he scored only three points, the Jets assigned Lambert to the Thunderbirds. With the Thunderbirds, Lambert scored 48 points in 26 games, as well as 26 points in 17 playoff games en route to winning the 2023 Ed Chynoweth Cup as WHL champions. The Thunderbirds then reached the final of the 2023 Memorial Cup, where they were defeated by the Quebec Remparts.\nReturning to the Moose for the 2023–24 season, Lambert was named to the 2024 AHL All-Star Game. In his NHL debut on 18 April 2024, Lambert recorded an assist in a 4–2 victory over the Vancouver Canucks.\nInternational play.\nLambert represented Finland at the 2019 Hlinka Gretzky Cup, as a as a 15 year old at the under-18 tournament, where he scored a hat-trick in a 6–0 victory against Switzerland.\nLambert has attended three IIHF World Junior Championships, winning bronze in 2021 and silver in 2022, and finishing fifth in 2023.\nPersonal life.\nLambert was born in Lahti, Finland to a Canadian father and a Finnish mother, and he is a citizen of both countries. His uncle Lane Lambert is a former NHL player and coach. His father Ross played for the Saskatoon Blades and professionally in the American Hockey League (AHL) and in the United Kingdom's Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL), where his uncle Dale also played. His cousin Jimmy played for the University of Michigan."

It was the site of the 1872 massacre of the Yavapai people in the Battle of Salt River Canyon.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.\nBackground.\nA short distance from Canyon Lake, Skeleton Cave, also known as Apache Cave and Skull Cave, is a rock shelter formed by the overhang in the cliff wall. The cave is no deeper than , and is approximately wide. It sits above the river, at the base of a cliff.\nThe cave was used by the Yavapais as a hideout from George Crook and the 5th Cavalry. On December 28, 1872, Crook and his soldiers massacred the Yavapais. This was the first principal engagement during the 1872 Tonto Basin Campaign and part of the 1871 to 1875 Yavapai War. The 5th Cavalry left the more than seventy bodies of the victims in the cave. From the time of the 1872 massacre until about 1905, the cave remained forgotten.\nIn January 1908, local rancher Jack Adams visited the cave with a group of friends. The remains of the slain Yavapais were still in the cave along with remnants of their belongings, and this is how the cave acquired its name. After 1908, with the construction of local dams, the cave was rediscovered and subsequently looted. In 1933, the remains of the massacre victims were relocated to Fort McDowell.\nThe wilderness area around the cave is managed by the United States Forest Service. Accessing the cave requires a difficult hike."

Due to COVID-19 pandemic all events but one were cancelled, and FIA considered that only one event wasn't enough to award a World title and cancelled the season.\nCalendar.\nThe original calendar for the 2020 edition of the world cup featured five events; four cross-country rallies and one cross-country marathon; the Silk Way Rally, which was included for the first time. Four events on the schedule are shared with the 2020 FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship; the Qatar round being the only exception.\nRegulation Changes.\nStarting with the 2020 season the vehicle classes have been reorganized into the following classifications:\nThe FIA awards the world cup to drivers, co-drivers, and teams competing in the T1 category; whilst drivers and teams in the T3 and T4 categories are awarded FIA cups. The T2 production class will no longer be awarded an end of season trophy. Likewise, the T5 'truck' category is recognized, but not awarded any end-of-season cup or trophy.\nResults.\nT2, T4 and T5 categories had no competitors in the only event held."

        "title": "Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics – Individual jumping",
        "text": "The individual show jumping at the 1956 Summer Olympics took place on 17 June, at the Stockholm Olympic Stadium. The event was open to men and women, with two women competing. It was the 10th appearance of the event. There were 66 competitors from 24 nations, with each nation able to send a team of up to three riders and the team and individual events sharing results. The event was won by Hans Günter Winkler of the United Team of Germany, a victory in the debut for that nation though Germany had won in 1936. Brothers Raimondo D'Inzeo and Piero D'Inzeo took silver and bronze, respectively, the first medals for Italy in individual jumping since 1924.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nFive of the top 10 riders from the 1952 competition returned: gold medalist Pierre Jonquères d'Oriola of France, bronze medalist Fritz Thiedemann of Germany (now competing as the United Team of Germany), fourth-place finisher Eloy de Menezes of Brazil, fifth-place finisher Wilfred White of Great Britain, and seventh-place finisher Raimondo D'Inzeo of Italy. The first two World Champions in the event, Paco Goyoaga of Spain (1953) and Hans Günter Winkler of the United Team of Germany (1954 and 1955) were present, with Winkler favored in the competition.\nAustralia, Cambodia, and Venezuela each made their debut in the event; East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany for the first time. France and Sweden both competed for the ninth time, tied for the most of any nation; Sweden had missed only the inaugural 1900 competition, while France missed the individual jumping in 1932.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used the two-round format introduced in 1952. Scores from the two runs were added together for a total score.\nThe team and individual jumping competitions used the same results. The course had 13 obstacles. The time limit was 1 minute, 56.1 seconds. Penalty points were received for obstacle faults (3, 4, 6, or 8 points based on severity) or exceeding the time limit (0.25 points per second or fraction thereof over the limit). A third refusal or jumping an obstacle out of order resulted in elimination. \nResults.\n66 riders competed. For the first time since 1932, no jump-off was required to determine the medalists. \nWinkler led after one round with 4 faults. In second was defending champion Jonquères d'Oriola at 7. There were five riders tied for third at 8, including both D'Inzeo brothers. Winkler suffered a pulled groin and would have withdrawn except that doing so would cost his teammates a chance at a team event medal (Germany led, but all three riders had to finish). He rode the second round dosed with (visibly insufficient) painkillers and coffee.\nDespite those impediments, Winkler was one of three riders to ride a clean second round (though one, López, had a .75 time penalty). He both took the individual gold and led Germany to the team gold. The other rider to come out of round 2 with no faults was the younger D'Inzeo, Raimondo. With Jonquères d'Oriola having a relatively poor second round (at 8 faults), the Frenchman fell to sixth—leaped over by 4 of the 5 men who had been tied for third after round 1. Raimondo's clean round earned him silver; his elder brother Piero's 3 second-round faults was good for bronze. Thiedemann and White each had 4 faults in the second round, tying for fourth.\nThe first two women to compete in the event, Pat Smythe and Brigitte Schockaert, finished 10th and 34th, respectively."

        "title": "Malcolm Perry (American football)",
        "text": "Malcolm Xiomar Perry (born April 19, 1997) is an officer in the United States Marine Corps and a former American football wide receiver. He attended the United States Naval Academy, where he played college football for the Navy Midshipmen from 2016 to 2019.\nThe son of United States Army personnel, Perry was a military brat who grew up in Tennessee. After high school and attending the Naval Academy Preparatory School, he joined the main campus and football team in 2016, where he played a variety of positions. He cycled between quarterback and slotback for his first two seasons before becoming the starting quarterback in 2018. After struggling that year and returning to slotback, he permanently reverted to quarterback in 2019. As a senior, he set various Navy and NCAA records, including the most rushing yards by a quarterback in a season, and was named American Athletic Conference (AAC) Offensive Player of the Year.\nHe was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the seventh round (246th overall) of the 2020 NFL Draft. Perry spent his rookie season in Miami, during which he scored his first professional touchdown, before joining the New England Patriots prior to the 2021 season. After spending time on the Patriots' and New Orleans Saints' practice squads, he retired from the NFL in 2022 to begin his military service.\nEarly years.\nPerry was born in Fort Campbell, where his parents Bonny and Malcolm Sr. were stationed as members of the United States Army. The family later moved to Clarksville, Tennessee. After growing up with basketball, Perry began playing football in third grade.\nHe attended Kenwood High School, where he played high school football for the Knights. He was named the team's quarterback in his sophomore year and led the team to three consecutive Class 5A state playoff appearances; all three postseason runs ended with losses to opponents that would make the state championship (with two winning). Perry's junior year saw him record 1,000 yards each in rushing and passing, a performance that ClarksvilleNow.com's Jimmy Trodglen wrote \"almost carried the Knights offense alone.\" In his senior season in 2014, he recorded 800 passing yards, 1,600 rushing yards, and 20 touchdowns as he was named District 10 Most Valuable Player and \"The Leaf-Chronicle\" All Area Player of the Year. Perry concluded his high school career with two All-State selections.\nCollege career.\nAfter high school, Perry contemplated attending Middle Tennessee State University, where his older sister's friends played for the Blue Raiders football team, or enlisting in the armed forces. Although he hoped to play running back for the University of Tennessee, the team did not express interest in him. Instead, he was recruited by the three service academies in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS)—Army, Navy, and Air Force—and his hometown school Austin Peay. Perry committed to Navy as the academy allowed him to play football in addition to serving, while the team also allowed him to select his position; in contrast, Air Force and Army wished to keep him at quarterback. In 2015, before enrolling at the main academy, he attended the Naval Academy Preparatory School. Despite starting the NAPS football season at slotback, he was moved to quarterback after starter Jonah Llanusa broke his wrist.\n2016.\nDuring Perry's freshman year in 2016, offensive coordinator Ivin Jasper switched his position from slotback to quarterback. In addition to playing for the junior varsity team, he began the varsity season sharing the third-string quarterback spot with Zach Abey before being demoted to fourth string due to illness.\nPerry made his varsity debut against Fordham after starting quarterback Tago Smith suffered an ACL tear. Although he was initially inactive for the game and instead watched from the stands, the injury forced the Midshipmen to pull Perry into action, while team equipment members had to return to campus to retrieve his uniform. Backup Will Worth played much of the game and Abey was suspended, leading to Perry seeing action in the fourth quarter. He led a 90-yard drive that resulted in a field goal, and ended the 52–16 Navy win with seven carries for 30 yards.\nHe saw playing time at slotback in Navy's game with SMU, where he recorded one carry for 13 yards. In the 2016 Armed Forces Bowl against Louisiana Tech, Perry entered the game with 3:46 remaining after Abey suffered an injury and scored on his lone play, a 30-yard touchdown run to tie the game at 45 points apiece. However, the Bulldogs kicked the game-winning field goal on the ensuing drive. It was Perry's first college touchdown and his only score in 2016 as he finished the season with nine carries for 73 yards.\n2017.\nEntering the 2017 season, Perry was expected to serve as Abey's backup quarterback since he was the only other player on the team to have varsity experience at the position. However, Navy head coach Ken Niumatalolo moved him to slotback as he wanted to provide playing time for Perry; the change was spurred by Smith spending much of his Navy career backing up Keenan Reynolds, only to suffer a season-ending injury in his first game as a starter. Niumatalolo described Perry as \"a very athletic kid who can help us and I'm going to get him on the field. I'm not going to have him standing on the sideline sending in signals.\" With Abey as the starter and junior Garret Lewis as backup, Llansula was originally slated as the third-string quarterback before he left the team, leading to Perry sharing the role with Jacob Harrison. Perry would start all 12 games in his sophomore year, including three at quarterback, and also served as the Midshipmen's kick returner after the incumbent Tre Walker was lost for the season to injury.\nPerry's first 100-rushing yard game came against Cincinnati, followed by 104- and 127-yard performances against Tulsa and Air Force, respectively; the latter was a then-career-best for Perry. The Air Force game also saw him record a 91-yard touchdown, the third-longest carry in Navy history and the longest at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, along with his first receiving touchdown on a 40-yard completion from Abey. In a 31–21 loss to UCF, Perry scored a 75-yard receiving touchdown and had a second score that was nullified by a holding penalty.\nAgainst Temple, Perry completed his first touchdown pass with a five-yard throw to Abey; the score came on a trick play that began with Abey pretending to give audibles to his team before the ball was snapped to running back Darryl Bonner, who pitched to Perry on a reverse, who in turn threw to Abey for the touchdown. Abey suffered a shoulder injury in the loss, leading to Perry making his maiden start at quarterback the following against SMU. Although he recorded 282 rushing yards and four touchdowns, including a 92-yard run that was the second-longest rushing score in the team's history, he sprained his left ankle in the fourth quarter; Navy would win 43–40 after the Mustangs came back from a 34–11 halftime deficit. For the season's remaining games, Niumatalolo opted to name starting quarterbacks shortly before kickoffs as Perry and Abey's differing playing styles (Perry preferred to run to the outside and could quickly change his pace, while Abey was a better passer and employed a more physical running style) forced opponents to prepare differently even if Navy fundamentally ran the same offense regardless of the starter.\nThe 2017 Army–Navy Game saw Perry start at quarterback, though Navy went on to lose 14–13. In snowy conditions, he recorded 250 rushing yards on 30 attempts, including a 68-yard touchdown, but penalties on the final drive hampered the Midshipmen offense and resulted in Bennett Moehring's game-winning 48-yard field goal going wide left. Perry's rushing yards accounted for 84 percent of his team's total yardage in the game and were nine more than Army's total. The performance also allowed Perry to break 1,000 rushing yards in 2017; Abey also accomplished the feat, allowing Navy to have its third duo of 1,000-yard rushers in a season. The Midshipmen, who started with a 5–0 record, concluded the regular season 6–6 and played in the Military Bowl against Virginia. Perry scored two touchdowns and rushed for 114 yards before leaving with a foot injury in the 49–7 victory. The 114 rushing yards were the second-most in bowl history behind Reynolds' 144 in 2015.\nHe ended the year with 1,182 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns; he averaged 8.6 yards per carry, a Navy record and the third-highest in the nation. His 303 receiving yards and two touchdowns on 13 catches were second-best on the team.\n2018.\nPerry began his junior year in 2018 as the Midshipmen's starting quarterback. Although he had thrown only two passes in his college career—one of which was intercepted—and Navy did not feature a pass-heavy offense, Jasper noted Perry possessed \"a good arm\" and threw \"a great deep ball\". As part of his new responsibilities, Perry transitioned into Navy's full triple option offense; in 2017, he only saw action at quarterback when the offense ran the read option from the shotgun formation. In July, he was placed on the preseason watch lists for the Maxwell (best college football player), Paul Hornung (most versatile player), and Walter Camp Awards (the Walter Camp Football Foundation's best player).\nThe Midshipmen opened 2018 with a 59–41 loss to Hawaii, during which Perry recorded 108 rushing yards and a 75-yard touchdown late in the first half. He also threw his first touchdown pass as a quarterback on a 19-yard score to Walker in the fourth quarter. In Navy's first American Athletic Conference (AAC) game of the year against Memphis, Perry led the team in all three offensive yardage categories (166 rushing, 22 passing, 17 receiving), the school's second player to do so after Reynolds in 2015; he also scored a \"highlight-reel touchdown\" as he dodged multiple Memphis players en route to a 14-yard touchdown run. This was followed by a 51–21 victory over Lehigh, during which Perry ran for 223 yards and three touchdowns as the Midshipmen recorded 629 total yards (tenth-most in program history), though he struggled with arm strength and accuracy as a passer.\nThe offense struggled through the next games, including a 35–7 loss to Air Force that dropped Navy to 2–3. The Midshipmen recorded just six first downs and 199 total yards in the loss, while Perry had a mere 54 yards on 19 carries (a number that was skewed by a 20-yard run). In a column published after the defeat, \"Capital Gazette\" writer and Navy beat reporter Bill Wagner criticized the team for its excessive reliance on Perry, whose 105 carries across the first five games greatly exceeded his teammates' attempts. Wagner called for Navy to \"admit the Malcolm Perry experiment has been a mistake\" as \"Perry is a running back and not a quarterback. I completely understand the logic of wanting to put the ball in the hands of the best offensive player as much as possible, but Navy's coaching staff is trying to fit a square peg into a round hole in its desperate attempt to do so.\" TheMidReport's Mike James wrote Perry was \"a year behind in his development as a quarterback\" due to spending the previous year as a slotback, with Navy's offense consequently growing too complex for him; the system used in the Air Force game was simplified to aid Perry, but James noted the offense was the same used against Army in 2017 shortly after Perry returned to quarterback, which Air Force capitalized on.\nAfter five games at quarterback, Perry was moved to slotback, a position that was hampered by mounting injuries. Although he was no longer the starting quarterback, he continued to see time at the position with Abey and Lewis. Despite the quarterback switch, the Midshipmen continued to struggle passing-wise as the three combined to complete less than 42 percent of their attempts. As a runner, Perry had just one more game of the remaining seven in which he recorded at least 100 yards—a 133-yard performance in a 44–22 loss to Notre Dame. In a one-point loss to Tulane, Perry threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to Abey, who also completed a 73-yard touchdown throw of his own to Perry in the game as Navy fell 29–28.\nThe Midshipmen ended the season 3–10, their worst record since 2002, including a third-straight loss to Army. Perry led Navy in rushing yards with 1,087 on 172 attempts, along with seven rushing touchdowns; in receiving, he recorded nine catches for 167 yards and a touchdown; when throwing, he completed nine of 25 passes for 222 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. In March 2019, Niumatalolo admitted he was unsure if ousting Perry from the starting quarterback role during the 2018 season was \"the right decision[...] We did what we felt was best for the team at the time, but when I go back and look at our games I'm not sure it worked out very well.\"\n2019.\nFor his senior year in 2019, Perry went back to quarterback and was named team co-captain. As Perry's playing style differed from previous Navy quarterbacks, Niumatalolo and Jasper redesigned Navy's offense to support him. For example, to assist his development as a passer, Navy hired Billy Ray Stutzmann to install features of the run and shoot offense; Stutzmann played in and coached the system at Hawaii. The run and shoot also shares formations and concepts with Navy's standard spread option offense. During the offseason, Perry focused on improving his decision making, noting that the option and passing aspects of the offense were \"all in my hands now\". Entering the 2019 season, Perry was again placed on the Maxwell Award watch list.\nPerry and the Navy offense enjoyed success in the season-opening 45–7 win over Holy Cross as the quarterback recorded his first 100-passing yard performance, completing six of nine passes for 103 yards, and ran for 28 yards and a touchdown. The following week against East Carolina saw Perry combine for six touchdowns—two passing and four rushing—and 307 total yards in a 42–10 victory; the six scores were the most by a Navy player in a game since Reynolds' seven in 2014. Perry also became the first Midshipman to record at least 150 rushing and passing yards apiece in one game since Ricky Dobbs in 2010. Navy's first loss of the year, a 35–23 defeat by Memphis, saw Perry run for two touchdowns and throw for another, but the Midshipmen's offensive production faltered in the second half. He was also pulled from the game on three occasions after hurting his throwing shoulder while sustaining hard hits, prompting coaches to advise him to avoid absorbing tackles.\nThe Midshipmen avenged their blowout loss to Air Force the previous year with a 34–25 win, during which Perry led an 11-play, 75-yard drive late in the game that ended with his go-ahead three-yard touchdown run. Against Tulsa, he ran for 218 yards and three touchdowns as Navy won their first away game since they beat the Golden Hurricane in September 2017. Perry continued his string of success by rushing for 188 yards and two scores against South Florida, guiding the final drive against Tulane that led to Bijan Nichols' game-winning field goal, and another two-score performance in a 56–10 blowout over Connecticut that placed Navy on a five-game winning streak. At the time, the Midshipmen were 7–1, their best record after eight games since the team began using the triple option in 2002. The Connecticut game also saw Perry run for 108 yards to surpass the 1,000-rushing-yard mark for the season, making him the first Navy player since Reynolds to record 1,000 rushing yards in three seasons.\nNavy's win streak was snapped with a 52–20 loss to Notre Dame. Perry recorded 117 rushing yards on 25 attempts, but lost three fumbles in the first half before being benched for Perry Olsen in the third quarter. He rebounded in the next game against SMU by completing a career-best nine of fifteen passes for 162 yards and a touchdown, while also running for 195 yards and two scores in the 35–28 win. In Houston against the Cougars, Perry ran for 146 yards and a touchdown, along with throwing for 107 yards on just two attempts, as Navy won 56–41; it was the Midshipmen's first victory at TDECU Stadium since they joined the AAC. The win tied Navy at the top of the conference's West Division with Memphis, but the Tigers were named division champion thanks to their win over the Midshipmen earlier in the year.\nIn early December, Perry was named AAC Offensive Player of the Year and first-team All-Conference; at the time of the announcement, he led the conference in rushing yards per game (136.4), which was also the most among quarterbacks in the nation, along with 1,500 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns. Against Army, he ran for a career-high and rivalry-record 304 yards (the first Navy player to do so against an FBS opponent and the second in general) and two touchdowns as the Midshipmen won 31–7, their first win in the rivalry since 2015. His performance allowed him to break two Navy records: Worth's 2016 single-season total offense record with 2,831 yards and Napoleon McCallum's 1983 single-season rushing yardage record with 1,804, while his 606 rushing yards in three Army–Navy Games were the most by any player in rivalry history. He was also the third player in school history to record 4,000 career rushing yards, joining McCallum and Reynolds. The Midshipmen concluded the regular season 10–2, during which Perry had nine consecutive games with at least 100 rushing yards and two games with over 200, the fourth player in school history to accomplish the latter.\nThe 2019 Liberty Bowl against Kansas State was Perry's final college game. He completed five of seven passes for 57 yards and a touchdown, while also running for 213 yards on 28 carries; the rushing yards surpassed Dobbs' 106 in the 2009 Texas Bowl for the most by a Navy player in a bowl game. Perry received game MVP honors in the 20–17 Navy victory. He ended 2019 with 2,017 rushing yards, surpassing Jordan Lynch's record for the most rushing yards by a quarterback in a season, while his 4,359 career rushing yards were the 79th-most among all players in college football history and the second-most by a Midshipman behind Reynolds.\nStatistics.\n\"Source\":\nProfessional career.\n2020 NFL Draft.\nPerry, who was assigned to the United States Marine Corps for his post-Academy military commitment, entered the 2020 NFL Draft as a wide receiver; he explained the position change gave him \"the best opportunity to play at the next level\". Although service academy graduates were required to serve for five years, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper signed an order in November 2019 that allowed athletes from the academies to defer their service to play professional sports upon receiving approval.\nDuring the pre-draft process, Perry participated in the 2020 East–West Shrine Bowl, playing for the East team. He had one carry in the 31–27 East win: he received the snap as a quarterback on a speed option play, from which he faked a lateral to running back Adrian Killins before running 52 yards for a touchdown. In February, he was invited to the NFL Scouting Combine; Perry was the second player in Navy history to attend the event, joining long snapper Joe Cardona in 2015.\nHe was regarded as a potential late-round draft pick or undrafted free agent by various outlets, with NFL.com's Lance Zierlein considering him a \"priority free agent\" and WalterFootball.com's Charlie Campbell projecting him in the sixth-round-to-undrafted range. Although draft scouts like Zierlein praised his toughness and intelligence, his small frame and the move to wide receiver were seen as concerns. However, Zierlein also added Perry's experience in the option offense and versatility made him a viable utility player in the NFL. During the pre-draft process, Perry met with the Los Angeles Chargers and Tennessee Titans at the East–West Shrine Bowl.\nMiami Dolphins.\nPerry was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the seventh round of the 2020 NFL Draft with the 246th overall pick, becoming the first drafted service academy player in Dolphins history. He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the team on August 3, 2020, and was activated three days later.\nAfter being inactive for the early games of the 2020 season, Perry made his NFL debut in the Dolphins' Week 8 win over the Los Angeles Rams, during which he recorded a ten-yard reception and was a wildcat formation quarterback on two plays. He was the fourth triple option-era Navy player to play in an NFL regular season game after Cardona, Reynolds, and Kyle Eckel. He caught his first touchdown pass, a 25-yard throw from fellow rookie Tua Tagovailoa, in a Week 17 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Perry concluded his rookie season with nine receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown, along with three carries for five yards.\nDuring the 2021 preseason, Perry played receiver and return specialist. He saw little playing time on offense across the first two games against the Chicago Bears and Atlanta Falcons as he combined for just two receptions and 41 yards; as a returner, he recorded one of Miami's four punt returns that went for at least 20 yards in Chicago, while he returned four kickoffs for 84 yards and two punts for 13 yards versus Atlanta. His offensive snaps increased in the final game against the Cincinnati Bengals with four catches for 69 yards, including a play that went 36 yards. Due to the Dolphins having too many receivers on their roster, he was one of four released on August 31 as part of final roster cuts to reach the 53-player limit.\nNew England Patriots.\nAlthough the Dolphins had hoped to sign Perry to the practice squad for the 2021 regular season, the New England Patriots claimed him off waivers on September 2. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, who is closely connected to the Naval Academy via his father and former Navy assistant coach Steve Belichick, had \"heavily scouted\" Perry entering the 2020 draft. The signing also made Perry one of two Navy players on the Patriots' active roster alongside Cardona. A foot injury caused him to miss the season opener against the Dolphins, and he was moved to the injured reserve list on September 11. He was released on November 17.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nSix days after departing the Patriots, Perry was signed to the New Orleans Saints practice squad with plans of quickly promoting him to the active roster to assist a struggling wide receiver unit. He never played a game for New Orleans and was one of four practice squad members released on December 28.\nReturn to New England Patriots and retirement.\nPerry returned to New England by signing a reserve/future contract on January 11, 2022. On July 22, days before training camp began, he was placed on the reserve/retired list as he intended to commit to naval service. A day later, Perry officially announced his retirement from the NFL.\nHis decision to end his playing career was attributed to a \"burning desire to go serve and fulfill the commitment I signed up for when I went to the Naval Academy. I kind of came to the conclusion that I was ready to call it quits and go do something that means a lot to me, my family and my country.\"\nMilitary career.\nAfter retiring from the NFL, Perry commissioned as an officer in the Marine Corps and underwent training at The Basic School on Marine Corps Base Quantico. Unlike some Navy-to-NFL players like Cardona who played while serving in the United States Navy Reserve, Perry was obligated to serve five years on active duty under his academy contract.\nPersonal life.\nPerry's parents were members of the Army's 101st Airborne Division. The two served in the Gulf War, with Malcolm Maurice Perry being involved in refueling operations and Bonny in parts repair and supply. A military brat, Malcolm Jr. is the youngest of six children, with two of his siblings being born in North Carolina and another in Germany.\nAt the Naval Academy, he was a quantitative economics major."

Although intended to increase representation from outwith Glasgow and Edinburgh, as this was the premier trial match both Glasgow and Edinburgh players were eligible for selection for their corresponding West and East sides.\nAnother Trial match, a Blues v Whites match was introduced in the 1877-88 season. The Blues v Whites match evolved into a 'Probables' v 'Possibles' match for Scotland selection.\nThe East v West match remained the premier Trial match for Scotland until the late 1920s. It was at this stage that the Blues v Whites match overtook it in importance. The introduction of the Scotland Probables versus the Scotland Possibles trial match diminished the need for the East of Scotland District versus West of Scotland District again, and it continued in the 1930s as a junior trial match. 'Junior' matches were not age-related but matches based on teams out with the Scottish Unofficial Championship.\nAge-grade format.\nThe East v West match continued in its same format till 1948. It then switched to an age-grade format and was used for selecting the best Under 23 players for Scotland.\nHiatus.\nWhen the Scottish Inter-District Championship began its own grade tournament, the East v West matches were curtailed.\nResurrection.\nThe West of Scotland District and East of Scotland District representative sides have recently been resurrected at age-grade levels.

Washington co-founded and popularized Jelly Fam, a social media movement that emphasizes creative finger roll layups. He played college basketball for the Minnesota Golden Gophers, Iona Gaels and Long Beach State Beach.\nEarly life.\nWashington was born and raised in Harlem, a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan. He grew up playing basketball at Dunlevy Milbank Children's Center in Harlem. In junior high school, Washington and his friend, Ja'Quaye James, along with Jahvon Quinerly, began calling themselves \"Jelly Fam.\" The phrase became popular among basketball players through social media and was centered around fancy finger roll layups called \"jelly.\" Washington trademarked the name.\nHigh school career.\nWashington played basketball for St. Raymond High School for Boys in The Bronx, a borough of New York City. On August 26, he shared most valuable player (MVP) honors at the Elite 24 All-American Game after scoring 36 points. As a senior, he averaged 26 points and six assists per game. Washington scored a season-high 54 points in a 91–83 loss to Cardinal Hayes High School. He finished his career as St. Raymond's all-time leading scorer with 1,410 points, surpassing Darryl Bryant, and was named Mr. New York Basketball, becoming the fourth point guard to ever win the award.\nRecruiting.\nWashington was a consensus four-star recruit and the most highly rated New York point guard in the 2017 class. He committed to play college basketball for Minnesota over offers from several other NCAA Division I programs.\nCollege career.\nOn November 10, 2017, Washington made his collegiate debut, recording four points and five assists on 1-of-9 shooting for Minnesota in a 92–77 victory over USC Upstate. On February 3, 2018, he scored a career-high 26 points in a 76–73 overtime loss to Michigan. It was the highest-scoring performance by a Minnesota freshman in Big Ten Conference play since Kris Humphries in 2004. He was subsequently named Big Ten freshman of the week. As a freshman, Washington played 32 games and averaged 8.7 points, 2.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game, shooting 36.6 percent from the field. On December 11, 2018, during his sophomore season, he posted his first double-double, with 14 points and a career-high 13 assists in an 80–71 win over North Florida. Washington averaged 4.3 points and 2.8 assists on 31.1 percent shooting as a sophomore and received less playing time due to the emergence of Gabe Kalscheur.\nFor his junior season, he transferred to Iona, moving closer to his hometown of Harlem to spend time with his ailing grandmother, and was granted immediate eligibility by the NCAA. In his first eight games, Washington averaged 7.8 points per game and shot 28 percent on three-pointers, but he grew more comfortable with his teammates and improved his statistics as the season progressed. On January 26, 2020, he tallied 25 points and 10 rebounds in a 94–88 loss to Monmouth. On February 27, Washington posted the third triple-double in Iona history with 14 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds in an 86–65 win over Canisius.

On May 21, 2020, he entered the transfer portal as part of a mutual agreement with new head coach Rick Pitino and his staff.\nOn June 15, 2020, Washington announced that he was transferring to Long Beach State. As a senior, he averaged 13.7 points and 4.9 rebounds per game.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2021 NBA draft, Washington signed with Lovćen 1947 of the ABA League Second Division and the Prva A Liga.\nOn August 12, 2022, Washington signed with Spišskí Rytieri of the Slovak Basketball League.\nOn January 8, 2023, Washington signed with Skyliners Frankfurt of the Basketball Bundesliga."
