        "title": "2007 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 2007 Rose Bowl Game presented by Citi was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 2007 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. It was the 93rd Rose Bowl Game and part of the 2006–2007 Bowl Championship Series (BCS) at the conclusion of the 2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season. In the game, the University of Southern California Trojans, champions of the Pacific-10 Conference, defeated the University of Michigan Wolverines, second-place finishers in the Big Ten Conference, 32–18. USC wide receiver Dwayne Jarrett and USC outside linebacker Brian Cushing were named the Rose Bowl Players of the Game.\nHistorically, the Rose Bowl has pitted the champions the Big Ten and Pac-10. What made the 2007 Rose Bowl a not-so-traditional matchup is that Michigan entered as the runner-up of the Big Ten. The Big Ten champions, Ohio State, were ranked #1 and instead participated in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game. Michigan won their first 11 games in 2006, but lost their last regular season game to the undefeated Buckeyes in Columbus, 42–39.\nPre-game.\nA moment of silence prior to the national anthem was held in memory of former Michigan center, 38th President of the United States, and 1978 Tournament of Roses Grand Marshal Gerald Ford, who died six days earlier. George Lucas, Southern California alum, the creator of the \"Star Wars\" series of films, and 2007 Tournament of Roses Grand Marshal, flipped the coin. The coin used featured Southern California's logo on one on side and Michigan's logo on the other. Neither team called a side as the team's logo that landed up won the coin toss. Southern California deferred after winning the coin toss, and Michigan elected to receive the ball on the kickoff. The game officially started at 2:00 pm PST (UTC−8).\nGame notes.\nMany times the participants of the Rose Bowl game have been the winners of the respective UCLA–USC rivalry and Michigan-Ohio State rivalry games, although there have been instances where the loser of the rivalry game still won the conference championship. In the 2007 Rose Bowl game, the participants \"both\" were the losers of those games, and Michigan was an at-large BCS participant with a second place Big Ten finish."

        "title": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup",
        "text": "The ICC Men's T20 World Cup, is the Twenty20 International cricket tournament, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2007.\nThe event has generally been held every two years. In May 2016, the ICC put forward the idea of having a tournament in 2018, with South Africa being the possible host, but the ICC later dropped the idea of a 2018 edition at the conclusion of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. The 2020 edition of the tournament was scheduled to take place but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was postponed until 2021, with the intended host changed to India. The 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was later relocated to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman due to problems relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in India, taking place 5 years after the previous (2016) iteration.\nAs of 2022, eight editions have so far been played and a total of 21 teams have competed. Only the West Indies and England have won the tournament more than once, both having won two titles. The inaugural 2007 World Twenty20, was staged in South Africa and won by India, who defeated Pakistan in the final at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. The 2009 tournament took place in England, and was won by the previous runner-up, Pakistan, who defeated Sri Lanka in the final at Lord's. The third tournament was held in 2010, hosted by the countries making up the West Indies cricket team. England cricket team defeated Australia in the final in Barbados, which was played at Kensington Oval, winning their first international tournament. The fourth tournament, the 2012 World Twenty20, was held in Asia for the first time, with all matches played in Sri Lanka. The West Indies won the tournament by defeating Sri Lanka in the final, winning its first international tournament since the 2004 Champions Trophy. The fifth tournament, the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, was hosted by Bangladesh, and was won by Sri Lanka defeating India, Sri Lanka being the first team to play in three finals. The sixth tournament, the 2016 ICC World Twenty20, was hosted by India and was won by West Indies defeating England. The seventh tournament, the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup , was hosted by UAE and was won by Australia defeating New Zealand.\nEngland are the reigning T20 World Cup holders, having beaten Pakistan in the 2022 final, winning their second title. They became the first men's team to hold both limited-overs World Cups (T20 and ODI) simultaneously.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nWhen the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup ended in 2002, the ECB needed another one-day competition to fill with the younger generation in response to dwindling crowds and reduced sponsorship. The Board wanted to deliver fast-paced, exciting cricket accessible to thousands of fans who were put off by the longer versions of the game. Stuart Robertson, the marketing manager of the ECB, proposed a 20-over per innings game to county chairmen in 2001, and they voted 11–7 in favour of adopting the new format.\nDomestic tournaments.\nThe first official Twenty20 matches were played on 13 June 2003 between the English counties in the T20 Blast. The first season of Twenty20 in England was a relative success, with the Surrey Lions defeating the Warwickshire Bears by 9 wickets in the final to claim the title. The first Twenty20 match held at Lord's, on 15 July 2004 between Middlesex and Surrey, attracted a crowd of 27,509, the largest attendance for any county cricket game at the ground - other than a one-day final - since 1953.\nSoon after with the adoption of Twenty20 matches by other cricket boards, the popularity of the format grew with unexpected crowd attendance, new domestic tournaments such as Pakistan's National T20 Cup and Stanford 20/20 tournament, and the financial incentive in the format.\nThe West Indies regional teams competed in what was named the Stanford 20/20 tournament. Convicted fraudster Allen Stanford backed the event financially, giving at least US$28,000,000 funding money, the fruit of his massive Ponzi scheme. It was intended that the tournament would be an annual event. Guyana won the inaugural event, defeating Trinidad and Tobago by 5 wickets and securing US$1,000,000 in prize money. A spin-off tournament, the Stanford Super Series, took place in October 2008 between Middlesex and Trinidad and Tobago, the respective winners of the English and Caribbean Twenty20 competitions, and a 2008 Stanford Super Series team formed from West Indies domestic players; Trinidad and Tobago won the competition, securing US$280,000 prize money. On 1 November, the Stanford Superstars played England in what was expected to be the first of five fixtures in as many years with the winner claiming a US$20,000,000 in each match.\nTwenty20 Internationals.\nOn 17 February 2005 Australia defeated New Zealand in the first men's full international Twenty20 match, played at Eden Park in Auckland. The game was played in a light-hearted manner – both sides turned out in kit similar to that worn in the 1980s, the New Zealand team's a direct copy of that worn by the Beige Brigade. Some of the players also sported moustaches/beards and hair-styles popular in the 1980s, taking part in a competition amongst themselves for \"best retro look\", at the request of the Beige Brigade. Australia won the game comprehensively, and as the result became obvious towards the end of the NZ innings, the players and umpires took things less seriously – Glenn McGrath jokingly replayed the Trevor Chappell underarm incident from a 1981 ODI between the two sides, and Billy Bowden showed him a mock Penalty card (red cards are not normally used in cricket) in response.\nInaugural edition.\nIt was first decided that an ICC World Twenty20 would take place every two years, except in the event of a Cricket World Cup being scheduled in the same year, in which case it will be held the year before. The first tournament was in 2007 in South Africa where India defeated Pakistan in the final. Kenya and Scotland had to qualify via the 2007 ICC World Cricket League Division One which was a 50-over competition that took place in Nairobi. In December 2007 it was decided to hold a qualifying tournament with a 20-over format to better prepare the teams. With six participants, two would qualify for the 2009 World Twenty20 and would each receive $250,000 in prize money. The second tournament was won by Pakistan who beat Sri Lanka by 8 wickets in England on 21 June 2009. The 2010 ICC World Twenty20 tournament was held in West Indies in May 2010, where England defeated Australia by 7 wickets. The 2012 ICC World Twenty20 was won by the West-Indies, by defeating Sri Lanka at the finals. For the first time, a host nation competed in the final of the ICC World Twenty20. There were 12 participants for the title including Ireland and Afghanistan as 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. It was the first time the T20 World Cup tournament took place in an Asian country.\nExpansion to 16 teams.\nThe 2012 edition was to be expanded into a 16 team format however this was reverted to 12. The 2014 tournament, held in Bangladesh was the first to feature 16 teams including all ten full members and six associate members who qualified through the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. However the top eight full member teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team rankings on 8 October 2012 were given a place in the Super 10 stage. The remaining eight teams competed in the group stage, from which two teams advance to the Super 10 stage. Three new teams (Nepal, Hong Kong and the UAE) made their debut in this tournament.\nIn July 2020, the ICC announced that the 2021 edition would be postponed by two years due to the pandemic. Therefore, the 2020 tournament (originally to be hosted by Australia) was moved to November 2022, and the 2021 tournament was originally to be hosted by India, due to Pandemic the matches was played in Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Both retained the rights to host the tournaments, with India hosting in 2021 and Australia in 2022. The 2021 tournament ran from 17 October to 14 November 2021, The 2022 tournament ran from 16 October to 13 November 2022.\nExpansion to 20 teams.\nIn June 2021, the ICC announced that the T20 World Cup tournaments in 2024, 2026, 2028, and 2030 will be expanded to include 20 teams. The teams will be divided into 4 groups (5 per group), with the top two teams from each group advancing to the Super Eights. They will be divided into two groups of four, with the top two from each group advancing to the semi-finals.\nThe 2024 T20 World Cup will be hosted by the West Indies and the United States. It will be the first time the US has hosted a World Cup, with multiple stadiums across the country either being newly built or repurposed for cricket. The 2026 tournament will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, with the 2028 edition in Australia and New Zealand, as well as the 2030 tournament in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland following.\nFormat.\nHosts.\nThe International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining bids from the nations which have expressed an interest in holding the event. After South Africa in 2007, the tournament was hosted by England, the West Indies and Sri Lanka in 2009, 2010 and 2012 respectively. Bangladesh hosted the tournament in 2014. India hosted the tournament in 2016. After a gap of five years, India won the hosting rights of 2021 edition as well, but due to COVID-19 pandemic the matches were played in Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The 2022 edition was hosted by Australia, who won the tournament in the previous year.\nIn December 2015, Tim Anderson, the ICC's head of global development, suggested that a future tournament be hosted by the United States. He believed that hosting the event could help spur growth of the game in the country, where it is relatively obscure and faces competition by other sports such as baseball. In 2020, the United States and West Indies expressed interest in co-hosting a T20 World Cup after 2023, with Malaysia being another possible contender. In November 2021, the ICC confirmed the hosts for the next four Men's T20 World Cup tournaments from 2024 to 2030. The United States and West Indies would co-host the 2024 edition, India and Sri Lanka to co-host the 2026 edition, Australia and New Zealand to co-host the 2028 edition and the 2030 edition is to be co-hosted by United Kingdom and Ireland.\nQualification.\nAll ICC full members qualify automatically for the tournament, with the remaining places filled by other ICC members through a qualification tournament, known as the T20 World Cup Qualifier. Qualification for the inaugural 2007 World Twenty20 came from the results of the first cycle of the World Cricket League, a 50-over league for ICC associate and affiliate members. The two finalists of the 2007 WCL Division One tournament, Kenya and Scotland, qualified for the World Twenty20 later in the year. A separate qualification tournament was implemented for the 2009 World Twenty20, and has been retained since then. The number of teams qualifying through the World Twenty20 Qualifier has varied, however, ranging from two (in 2010 and 2012) to six (in 2014 and 2016).\nFinal tournament.\nIn each group stage (both the preliminary round and the Super 12 round), teams are ranked against each other based on the following criteria:\nIn case of a tie (that is, both teams scoring the same number of runs at the end of their respective innings), a Super Over would decide the winner. In the case of a tie occurring again in the Super Over, subsequent super overs would be played until there is a winner. Earlier, the match would be won by the team that had scored the most boundaries in their innings. During the 2007 tournament, a bowl-out was used to decide the loser of tied matches.\nTrophy.\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup trophy is presented to the winners of the final. It was designed and manufactured by Links of London, and is made of silver and rhodium. It weighs approximately and stands tall, with a width of at the top and at the base.\nTeam performance.\nCorrect as of final of the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Teams are ordered by best result then by winning percentage, then alphabetically:\n\"Note:\""

        "title": "Gymnastics at the 1964 Summer Olympics – Men's artistic individual all-around",
        "text": "The men's individual all-around was a gymnastics event contested as part of the Gymnastics at the 1964 Summer Olympics programme at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium. It was held on 18 and 20 October. There were 130 competitors from 30 nations. Each nation could send a team of 6 gymnasts or up to 3 individuals. The event was won by Yukio Endō of Japan, the nation's first victory in the event after two consecutive Games with silver medals. Endō snapped the Soviet Union's three-Games gold medal streak and started a three-Games streak for Japan, as the two nations reached the height of their four-decade combined dominance of the event. Three silver medals were awarded after a tie between Viktor Lisitsky and Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union and Shuji Tsurumi of Japan. Shakhlin, the defending gold medalist, thus became the seventh man to win multiple medals in the all-around. For the second consecutive Games, Japan and the Soviet Union took 11 of the top 13 places (and, for the second consecutive Games, Yugoslavia's Miroslav Cerar and Italy's Franco Menichelli were the two men in the top 10 not from those two nations).\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nEight of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1960 Games returned: gold medalist Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union, two-time silver medalist Takashi Ono of Japan, two-time bronze medalist Yuri Titov of the Soviet Union, fourth-place finisher Shuji Tsurumi of Japan, fifth-place finisher Yukio Endō of Japan, eighth-place finisher Miroslav Cerar of Yugoslavia, ninth-place finisher Takashi Mitsukuri of Japan, and tenth-place finisher Franco Menichelli of Italy. Titov was the reigning (1962) World Champion, with Endō and Shakhlin (the 1958 World Champion) finishing second and third.\nAlgeria, the Republic of China, Iran, Mongolia, and the Philippines each made their debut in the event. France and Italy both made their 12th appearance, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics all-around events continued to use the aggregation format. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score.\nThese exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 130th. There was no all-around final.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, apparatus scores from 0 to 20, and individual totals from 0 to 120.\nResults.\nThe score for the individual all-around was a simple sum of each gymnast's preliminary scores from the six apparatus events."

        "text": "Chottogram Division cricket team represents the Chittagong Division, one of the seven administrative regions in Bangladesh. The team was founded in 1999 to compete in the National Cricket League (NCL) and plays first-class cricket. For the short-lived National Cricket League Twenty20 in 2010, the team adopted the name Cyclones of Chittagong (often abbreviated as CC). The equivalent team in the Bangladesh Premier League is the Chittagong Vikings (qv), replacing the Chittagong Kings.\nChittagong Division play most of their home games at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium (ZAC) in the port city of Chittagong. The ZAC has superseded the older M. A. Aziz Stadium (MAA) as Chittagong's main cricket venue. The MAA is now used primarily for football.\nHistory.\nBefore Bangladesh became independent, Chittagong was part of East Pakistan and it had a cricket team which was scheduled to take part in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in both 1959–60 and 1964–65, and in the Ayub Trophy in 1962–63. None of the scheduled matches took place as all were abandoned without any start of play. East Pakistan cricket had a chequered history and it was only after independence that cricket in Bangladesh gained any real significance.\nThe earliest known match involving a Chittagong Division team was in March 1980 when they played Rajshahi Division in an Inter-Divisional Championship competition. In March 1986, they took part in a National Cricket Championship and reached the quarter-final stage. These were not first-class competitions and it was not until the late 1990s, after Bangladesh had made progress in international cricket, that there was any possibility of first-class cricket at the domestic level.\nBangladesh won the 1997 ICC Trophy and so qualified for the 1999 Cricket World Cup. There was then the very real prospect (realised in 2000) of the country being admitted to full membership of the International Cricket Council (the ICC) and so steps were taken to create an organised national championship. The result was the NCL which began in the 1999–2000 season, though it did not have first-class status until the 2000–01 season. It was decided that the NCL teams should represent each of the country's six (at that time) administrative divisions and so a Chittagong Division team was formed, playing its matches at the M. A. Aziz Stadium in Chittagong, the Comilla Stadium in Comilla and the Niaz Mohammad Stadium in Brahmanbaria. Chittagong Division won the 1999–2000 championship.\nIn 2000–01, Chittagong Division became a first-class team and has continued to compete in the NCL but with no further titles to 2016. The List A One-Day Cricket League began in 2000–01 and ran until 2010–11 when it was terminated. Chittagong Division won the competition once, in 2003–04.\nChittagong played in the Bangladesh NCL (National Cricket League) Twenty20 tournament which was staged for one season only, 2009–10, and used the name Cyclones of Chittagong (CC). The team's official colours were blue and white. Though captained by Nafees Iqbal and featuring Tamim Iqbal, the Cyclones were unsuccessful. They lost four of their five games and finished fifth in the six-team league.\nCurrent squad.\n, The current squad for 2019–20 season"

He entered the Galleryfurniture.com Bowl in the fourth quarter, but did not attempt a pass.\n2002 season.\nLong had a record-breaking season as a sophomore after not attempting a pass as a freshman. He won the starting spot from two-year incumbent starter Mark Farris with a solid performance against the Pitt Pathers in the second game of the season and started his first career game the following week against Virginia Tech. Long passed for 2,509 yards and 19 touchdowns on 177-of-333 passing, his 2,509 season passing yards putting him at No. 2 in school history for a single season. He started the last nine games of the season and played in all 12. He posted 300-yard passing games against Kansas (399), Texas Tech (367) and Oklahoma State (332). Long shared Big 12 Conference Offensive Player of the Week honors with Texas Tech’s Kliff Kingsbury after passing for 367 yards and seven touchdowns against the Red Raiders, his seven touchdowns shattering a Big 12 record. His 19 passing touchdowns tied him with Gary Kubiak for the most in one season at A&amp;M.\n2003 season.\nLong was supplanted by Reggie McNeal as the starting quarterback, although he did see action in all 12 games. In his lone start against Mizzou (after an injury to McNeal), Long passed for 252 yards and a touchdown on 23-of-29 passing. He finished the season with 709 passing yards and four touchdowns on 63-of-104 attempts.\n2004 season.\nUnhappy with his lack of playing time, Long decided to transfer to Sam Houston State University following the 2003 season. During his senior season, Long passed for 3,408 yards and 31 touchdowns and led the SHSU to an 11-3 record and helped propel them into the NCAA Division I-AA playoff semifinals.

He threw for 323 yards and four touchdowns, leading Sam Houston State to a 54-24 win.\nIn the second round, Long passed for 478 yards and three touchdowns to rally the Bearkats from a 20-point fourth quarter deficit, leading them on a 75-yard drive which culminated with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Jason Mathenia as time expired for a 35-34 win over Eastern Washington University.\nIn the semifinals against Montana, Long was 35-of-53 for 375 yards, but was erratic throwing two interceptions without a touchdown. He was sacked six times, matching his total for the entire season up to that point. Ironically, Montana quarterback Craig Ochs was a transfer from Texas A&amp;M's Big 12 rival Colorado Buffaloes.\nProfessional career.\nAlthough Long went undrafted in the 2005 NFL Draft, he participated in workouts and a team mini-camp with the Dallas Cowboys, who allocated him to the Hamburg Sea Devils of NFL Europa, where he did not see any regular-season action.

        "text": "The Melbourne Rugby Union Football Club, is a rugby union football club based in Melbourne, Australia. Nicknamed the Unicorns, the club plays at Romanis Reserve in Prahran and was founded in 1926. The club's colours are green, blue and gold.\nHistory.\nMelbourne rugby union football club is one of the two oldest clubs in Victoria (the oldest being Melbourne University Rugby Football Club). Officially established in 1926, some 38 years after the first game of rugby was played in Victoria, under the 'Melbourne Rugby Union' banner. The first rugby union games were played in Victoria were in 1888. Three games are recorded as being played that year:- one against a British touring team and two against a New Zealand Natives side. The match against the British was lost, but the second Natives' games was a draw; the game they play in heaven had arrived in Victoria.\nUntil the establishment of Melbourne Rugby club, Victorian rugby was a somewhat stop start affair, due in no small part to World War I. The Victorian Rugby Union (VRU) was established in early 1926 when Melbourne and the five other clubs then playing Rugby League, St Kilda, Melbourne University, Kiwis, RAAF and Navy agreed to wind up the Victorian Rugby League.\nDuring the period 1930-35, Dave Cowper became the club's and Victoria's first Australian international representative and, in 1933, captained Australia against the Springboks in South Africa.\nIn the early days of the late 1920s and 1930s, Melbourne Rugby Club's motto of that era was \"Praemia Post Habeas Ludo\" (loosely translated as \"After the Battle, Enjoy the Prize\"). Following the club's amalgamation in 1939 with Old Boys Rugby Club and prior to his departure, that year, to military duties in World War II, the club accepted the recommendation of club member Weary Dunlop, that the rampant unicorn become the club emblem along with his suggested new club motto \"Never a step backward\"\nBoth the emblem and the motto along with the club's victory song \"We're on the march with Melbourne's Army\" are still deeply embedded in the Melbourne Rugby Club 'psyche.' Another mark of recognition of Melbourne RUFC was introduced by R.I. Kingman in the early Sixties. The sound of 'Who's that man with the big red nose' has become synonymous with MRUFC throughout Victorian rugby circles.\nIn 1959 MRUFC gained the rights to play on Romanis Reserve. Commonly known as Orrong Park, it is situated on Orrong Road, between High Street and Malvern Roads, Prahran, and is regarded as one of the best playing surfaces in the Victorian union.\nIn recent years the Melbourne Rugby club has enjoyed some extraordinary success. In 2009, the club's centenary year the first grade side came from last to first, to win the Dewar Shield for the club's 15th time (the most of any club in Victoria). On 11 September 2010, the club went one step further with all 4 senior sides winning their respective competitions. The first club to ever do this in Victoria and second in Australia."

He graduated in 1990 with a bachelor's degree in government and foreign affairs, and went on to earn his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of Georgia School of Law in 1994.\nCollege coaching career.\nGeorgia.\nDooley started his college coaching career with a one-year stint as a graduate assistant at the University of Georgia in 1996. This is where his father Vince Dooley was the athletic director and head football coach who won the 1980 national championship there.\nSMU.\nDooley spent the 1997–1999 seasons as the wide receivers coach at Southern Methodist University, while also holding the duties of assistant recruiting coordinator during his final two years at SMU.\nLSU.\nIn 2000, Dooley was hired by Nick Saban at LSU as the Tigers’ recruiting coordinator/tight ends coach, a capacity in which he served until 2002. Dooley spent the 2003–04 seasons coaching the Tigers’ running backs and special teams, and in 2004 was named assistant head coach. In 2005, Dooley left LSU with Saban when the latter became head coach of the Miami Dolphins.\nLouisiana Tech.\nOn December 17, 2006, Dooley was hired as the new head coach at Louisiana Tech University. He replaced former coach Jack Bicknell, who was fired on December 4 after the Bulldogs finished 3–10 in 2006. \nIn his first season as head coach, Dooley led the Bulldogs to a 5–7 record in 2007. On March 6, 2008, Dooley was named the Athletics Director of Louisiana Tech University replacing former AD Jim Oakes. From 2008 to 2009 Dooley was the only head football coach in the country who also served as the university's athletics director. In the 2008 season, Dooley led Louisiana Tech to a 7–5 regular season record. He led Louisiana Tech to its first postseason victory since the 1977 Independence Bowl with a 17–10 victory over Northern Illinois in the 2008 Independence Bowl. In the 2009 season, Dooley led Louisiana Tech to a 4–8 record.\nTennessee.\nOn January 15, 2010, Dooley was hired as the 22nd head coach at the University of Tennessee. He replaced Lane Kiffin, who resigned to become head coach at the University of Southern California after one season at Tennessee. Dooley had a challenging three seasons as the head coach at Tennessee. The only in-depth on the record discussion of his tenure was given nearly four years later during a live two-hour televised interview with Clay Travis of Fox Sports Outkick the Coverage in June 2016. \nDooley inherited a program for which he would be the third head coach in three years. Perhaps due to these coaching changes, a number of scholarship players had left the University. The 2010 Tennessee Volunteer football team was expected to be one of the worst in school history. Despite few scholarship players and a very young team, the season yielded some positive, memorable, and controversial moments. On October 2, against #12 LSU, Tennessee was up 14–10 towards the end of the game. LSU was driving with little time remaining. LSU let the time run out in regulation before having a chance to score leaving Tennessee to think they won the game. Tennessee ended up having too many men on the field for that play. LSU got one more play after it had looked like the game had ended and scored the game-winning touchdown. Tennessee started the season 2–6. However, they won their last four regular season games to finish the season 6–6 and become bowl eligible. Tennessee went on to lose the Music City Bowl to North Carolina in a controversial ending. \nIn 2011, the team finished a disappointing 5–7, dropping the last game of the season to Kentucky, which ended a 26-game winning streak against the Wildcats. Combined with the 6–7 record of 2010, it was the first time since 1910–1911, that the Vols had finished with losing records in back to back seasons.\nAt the outset of the 2012 season the Vols had high hopes for a major turnaround. With returning star quarterback Tyler Bray back at the helm and star wide receiver Justin Hunter returning from injury the Vols were expected to tout an offense that could compete against the top SEC defenses. Boosting the offense from the start of the season was the emergence of community college transfer wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson who became a big threat in both receiving and returning plays. However, another loss to the rival Florida Gators, a game in which the Vols were in control for a majority of time, sent the season trending downward. The Vols lost six of the nine remaining games, including a four-game losing streak which saw the Volunteers lose close games to ranked opponents Georgia and South Carolina. A heartbreaking 4OT loss to Missouri left many fans fed up with Dooley after a questionable call to play overtime rather than play for a game-winning field goal would deprive the Vols of a victory. A lop-sided 41–18 loss to in-state rival Vanderbilt ended up being his final game. The next day, Dooley was fired from his head coaching position effective immediately. He was eventually replaced by Butch Jones, the former head coach of the Cincinnati Bearcats. The Volunteer football team went 5–7, with all seven losses being to SEC teams. As a result, Tennessee recorded three consecutive losing seasons (2010, 2011 and 2012). Dooley amassed the worst record of head coaches with more than two seasons in Tennessee history, and the worst overall since 1906. He has the worst record of all Tennessee coaches in SEC play.\nMissouri.\nAfter a few years back in the NFL, Dooley returned to college, from 2018 until 2019 Dooley was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Missouri.\nIn his first season as offensive coordinator, Mizzou ended the 2018 season ranked 13th nationally (third in the SEC) in total offense (481.8 avg.), 18th nationally (third in the SEC) in scoring (36.6 avg.) and 18th nationally (third in the SEC) in third down conversions (46.4%). Dooley's offense also led the SEC in fewest quarterback sacks allowed (8th nationally) and fewest tackles for loss allowed (6th nationally).\nUnder Dooley's guidance, Mizzou was one of only three Power Five offenses to throw for at least 279 yards per game, while rushing for at least 200 yards per game. The other two were national champion Clemson (279 passing/248 rushing) and CFP semi-finalist Oklahoma (322 passing/247 rushing).\nIn the 2018 AutoZone Liberty Bowl, Dooley’s offense broke a school bowl-game record with 637 yards of total offense. In the game, Mizzou threw for 373 yards (including a program bowl-game record three passing touchdowns) while running for 264 more in the 38–33 loss to Oklahoma State.\nDooley mentored quarterback Drew Lock, who was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft. Under Dooley's guidance, Lock was a finalist for three major national awards (Manning Award, Unitas Golden Arm Award, Lowe's Senior CLASS Award) and earned second-team All-SEC honors for his outstanding play, which included 3,498 yards and 28 passing touchdowns, to go with a career-best six rushing scores.\nDooley left after the 2019 season to return to the NFL.\nAlabama.\nOn February 16, 2022, Dooley was hired by Alabama to be their offensive analyst.\nNFL coaching career.\nMiami Dolphins.\nDooley was named to the Dolphins’ coaching staff as the tight ends coach on January 10, 2005, by Nick Saban, for whom Dooley had previously worked at Louisiana State University. Dooley served on the staff for two years, but left the Dolphins' staff in 2006 when he was chosen as the new head football coach at Louisiana Tech. He was an assistant coach under Nick Saban for seven years, which included a BCS National Championship at LSU in 2003.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn February 5, 2013, the Dallas Cowboys officially hired Dooley as their wide receivers coach. Dooley coached with the Cowboys from 2013–2017. During three of Dooley's five seasons with the team, he contributed to an offensive coaching staff that finished fifth in the NFL in points three times, in 2013, 2014, and 2016. In the 2014 and 2016 seasons, the team finished in the top seven offenses in yardage. During Dooley's tenure with the team, accomplished Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant earned three trips to the Pro Bowl in 2013, 2014, and 2016 and was named as a first team All Pro for the 2014 season. Following the 2017 season, he left the Cowboys to join the Missouri Tigers coaching staff.\nNew York Giants.\nOn January 27, 2020, it was confirmed that Dooley would be a part of the Giants coaching staff under Joe Judge. For the 2021 season he was named as the team's tight ends coach, switching positions with Freddie Kitchens. He was not retained after the 2021 season.\nPersonal life.\nDooley's wife is Dr. Allison Jeffers Dooley, who is an OB/GYN, and they have three children named John Taylor, Peyton, and Julianna. Peyton was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in August 2014. Dooley currently serves on the board of the JDRF Dallas chapter. John Taylor is currently on the Georgia Bulldogs' football team as a wide receiver.\nBefore embarking on his coaching career, Dooley practiced law at Nelson Mullins Riley &amp; Scarborough in Atlanta, Georgia. He is the son of former University of Georgia head football coach and athletic director Vince Dooley.\nWhile at Tennessee, Dooley helped raise over $1 million for children and other causes in the local community. The Dooley's hosted the Big Orange Experience, an annual fundraising event for Variety, an organization that provides financial support for numerous children's charities. In 2012, some of the proceeds funded the Dooley-Witten Learning Center at the Halls/Powell Boys and Girls Club of the Tennessee Valley, a project on which Dooley teamed up with former Vol and Dallas Cowboys All-Pro Tight End Jason Witten.\nDooley's brother-in-law is former NFL wide receiver Patrick Jeffers."

        "title": "Tom Payne (basketball)",
        "text": "Thomas Robert Payne (born November 19, 1950) is a former professional basketball player, professional boxer and a convicted serial rapist.\nA 7-foot, 2-inch center, Payne played with the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) during the 1971-1972 season. He was also the first African American ever to play basketball for the University of Kentucky.\nEarly years.\nThe eldest of nine children, Payne broke one record in birth; he was the longest baby ever born at the local hospital. He grew up in a home where academics were stressed; his father had attained the rank of master sergeant in the United States Army before retiring, and his mother had a bachelor's degree in biology. His eight siblings were also well-educated, with a total of fourteen college degrees.\nDespite his height and incredible physical skills, Payne was basically a newcomer to basketball. He didn't play organized basketball until his sophomore season at Shawnee High School at Louisville, Kentucky. By his senior season, he was one of the most coveted players in the nation, with Kentucky and UCLA recruiting him. On June 9, 1969, the high-school All-American signed with Kentucky; he was not only the tallest player ever to play at the school at that time, he was also legendary coach Adolph Rupp's first-ever African-American player.\nUniversity of Kentucky.\nTouted as \"another Lew Alcindor\" (the player later known as Kareem Abdul Jabbar), Payne struggled in adjusting to college life at Kentucky. A low entering test score prevented him from playing on the Kentucky freshman team. (Freshmen were ineligible to play varsity basketball at the time.) He instead played for an AAU team called \"Jerry's Restaurant.\"\nPayne boosted his grades and gained eligibility to play during his sophomore season, averaging 17 points and 10 rebounds per game, earning all-Southeastern Conference honors along the way. Impressive as these numbers were, signs of trouble developed during the season. In a road game against the Tennessee Volunteers, Payne flipped Jim Woodall head over heels battling for a rebound. The referees whistled Payne for a flagrant foul and ejected him. In the rematch against Tennessee at Kentucky, Payne again flagrantly fouled Woodall, and was ejected from this game also. Payne was also ejected from a home game against Alabama for objecting to a referee's call. Payne's temper was exacerbated by racial slurs that he heard when playing in opposing venues.\nFor all his temper, Payne continued to improve during the season, and dominated opponents. He scored 34 points in one game against Georgia Bulldogs, and 39 against LSU. The future looked bright for Payne after he scored 30 points against Auburn, in a game that clinched the Southeastern Conference regular season title for Kentucky.\nDuring the summer however, Payne experienced a variety of troubles. In August, a police officer cited him for speeding in his new Cadillac. The car was registered to a Pennsylvania auto dealer; it was rumored that teams from the NBA and American Basketball Association were coveting Payne and that the car was a gift from the Pittsburgh Condors of the latter league to apply for the ABA draft. Payne also had nine hours of incomplete grades that needed to be made up before he could return to Kentucky. With the slim likelihood of being eligible to play the following season, Payne left Kentucky and joined thirteen other underclassmen in the NBA's first-ever supplemental draft.\nProfessional basketball.\nPayne was drafted by the Atlanta Hawks and, during the 1971–1972 season, averaged 4.1 points in 29 games. During the season, his mother, a major influence in his life, died.\nLegal issues.\nIn 1972, Payne was convicted of raping a woman and served five years in a Georgia prison. After completing his sentence in Georgia, Payne served six years in a Kentucky prison on separate rape charges before being paroled in 1983. However, Payne was again convicted of rape in 1986, this time in California. Payne was paroled in California in 2000, only to return to prison in Kentucky for a parole violation. Payne was paroled in January 2019. Payne said in a 2015 interview with WHAS-TV that he regretted his past behavior and was reformed."

        "title": "Equestrian events at the 2008 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Equestrian competitions in all three disciplines at the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics were held from 9 August to 21 August at the Hong Kong Sports Institute and Sheung Yue River in Hong Kong. It was the second time that the equestrian events were hosted by a member of the IOC other than the member hosting the main games (although this time the events were technically held in the same country as the main games). Unlike 1956, however, the equestrian events were part of the main games, and were held within the same period.\nEvents.\n6 sets of medals were awarded in the following events:\nQualification.\nEach event has its own qualification rules, but generally rely on FEI rankings.\nDressage qualification.\nFor the team competition there were a total of 10 quota spots and as many composite as qualify. Three team spots were awarded at the 2006 FEI World Equestrian Games. In addition 7 team spots were awarded at regional competitions (Europe: 3, Americas: 2, Asia: 2). In addition, should a country have three athletes qualified in the individual competition, they will be considered a team and allowed to compete as a composite team. Five teams qualified under this scheme.\nFor the individual competition, 50 spots were allocated as follows. Thirty spots were awarded to the athletes who qualified as teams above. In addition, the highest ranked rider from each of seven geographic regions and the host nation qualify. Then the top twelve riders based on rank FEI rank who had not otherwise qualified are given spots.\nJumping qualification.\nA country may send up to five riders if it qualified for the team competition, two otherwise. Similar to Dressage, teams of five riders were qualified at either the World Equestrian Games, a region competition, or through a composite spot. The WEG awarded five spots, the regions eight (Americas: 2, Europe: 2, Asia: 4), and two composite teams qualified. For the individual competition there were a total of 73 spot allocated as follows: 45 team member, 1 host nation, 7 regional, and 22 at-large.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:\nVenue.\nThe equestrian competitions were held apart from the main games in Hong Kong, which is a separate member to the IOC. This was because Hong Kong has established a huge horse racing industry since its British colonial days; therefore, strict quarantine measures for horses have been well established in the region, and were likely to result in fewer problems with equine disease than other cities in mainland China. Additionally, there were already some stabling sites for horses within Hong Kong, hence less construction was needed to facilitate the equestrian sports required by the Olympics.\nThere were two main equestrian venues: Hong Kong Sports Institute (adjacent to Sha Tin Racecourse) and the Beas River Country Club. The Sports Institute held the main competition arena, which included an 80 × 100 meter stadium will all-weather footing and seating for 18,000. The Beas River Country Club was the site of the cross-country phase of eventing, which was held on the golf course.\nWeather.\nHong Kong is known to have hot and humid weather with typhoons being common. This includes a mean air temperature of 28.4 °C (83.1 °F) with 82% humidity, making it even more inclement than Athens (mean temperature of 27.6 °C (81.6 °F), humidity 48%) and Atlanta (26 °C (78 °F), 75% humidity).\nSome competitors made it clear that they believed that it would be unfair to work their horses in such weather. Swiss dressage rider Sylvia Ikle was one such rider, and the Swiss decided not to send a dressage team because they would have had little chance of success without her.\nTo combat the heat, the horses were transported from the airport in Hong Kong to the stabling facilities in air-conditioned vans. The stables are all air-conditioned as well, at a temperature of 20 °C (68 °F). For the first time in history, there was also an indoor arena for training that was also air-conditioned. Misting fans were placed under tents at both venues to cool off horses that worked outside. There were also vast quantities of ice water available. There was a veterinary clinic on site, which tested the horses' urine several times to ensure they were all properly hydrated.\nThe cross-country course was also designed with a shorter, alternate route to be used if the heat and humidity warranted it. The show jumping was held under lights at night to avoid the heat. The footing is made of high tensile fibers and quartz sand, which has a great ability to absorb water, so that any rain should have minimal effect on the footing used for dressage and show jumping competitions.\nCourses.\nThe show jumping courses (both Grand Prix and the eventing stadium phase) were designed by Leopoldo Palacios of Venezuela and Steve Stephens of the USA. Michael Etherington-Smith of Great Britain designed the cross-country course.\nParticipation.\nMore than 200 horses from 41 nations competed."

In 2018, they won the 2017–18 LEN Champions League in Genoa, beating once again a home team in the final, the Italian powerhouse Pro Recco, the most successful club in the competition with 8 titles. Olympiacos dominated the final game and won the title with a 9–7 scoreline against the Italian side inside their home ground. Along with their second LEN Champions League title, they also completed the second Quadruple Crown in their history (LEN Champions League, Greek Championship, Greek Cup, Greek Super Cup). Key players of this Olympiacos team that was crowned European Champion for the second time in the club's history were Josip Pavić, Giannis Fountoulis, Andro Bušlje, Konstantinos Genidounias, Manolis Mylonakis, Paulo Obradović, Konstantinos Mourikis, Vangelis Delakas, Giorgos Dervisis, Alexandros Gounas, Stelios Argyropoulos and Dimitris Nikolaidis. Under Vlachos, Olympiacos have also reached the final of the 2015–16 LEN Champions League in Budapest, where they lost 6–4 to VK Jug, and the final of the 2018–19 LEN Champions League in Hannover, where they lost in the penalty shootout to Ferencváros.\nOverall, from 2006–07 through the 2022–23 season, Olympiacos domestically won 15 Doubles (Greek Championship and Greek Cup) in 17 seasons, five of them straight (2007–2011), and six more undefeated and having won every game (without even a single draw) in both the Greek League and the Greek Cup (2008–09, 2009–10, 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2017–18). The club also holds many more unique records in the domestic competitions. They have achieved an all-time record of 163 straight wins in both the Greek League's regular season and play-offs, which lasted from May 2013 to May 2019. Additionally, Olympiacos holds the record for the fewest losses (overall), the most goals scored in a season (446 goals in season 2017–18, beating their previous record of 444 goals in season 2015–16), and the fewest goals conceded in a season (100 goals in season 2015–16).\nSupporters.\nOlympiacos fans are renowned for their ardent support to the men's water polo team, with the atmosphere at home matches in regarded as raucous and passionate to such an extent that is rarely seen in water polo matches. Papastrateio is widely considered one of the most fearsome and strong home grounds in Europe. Starting from season 2015–16, Olympiacos has won 19 out of their last 20 LEN Champions League home games in Piraeus (losing only to Szolnoki in the 2016–17 season), while their last defeat in the domestic competitions was recorded on 8 May 2013, with the Red-Whites counting more than 5 and a half years with nothing but straight wins at home in both the Greek League and the Greek Cup.\nIn 2016 Olympiacos fans carried out the largest fan movement in the history of the sport in the European continent, as more than 1000 Olympiacos supporters travelled to Budapest for the 2016 LEN Champions League Final in the Alfréd Hajós Swimming Pool.\nThe large Alfréd Hajós pool was filled with Olympiacos fans from Greece and many other European cities, who provided a passionate support to the team in both the semi-final and the final game of the competition.\nOlympiacos fans have created a very popular chant to describe the atmosphere they usually create in Olympiacos water polo matches in Papastrateio Hall. They sing: \"For your glory Legend, we're gonna turn Papastrateio Hall into a madhouse\" (Greek: \"Θρύλε για το δικό σου μεγαλείο, το Παπαστράτειο τρελοκομείο\").\nCurrent roster.\n2023–24\nNotable players.\nSource:"

        "title": "1999 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 1999 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament began on March 12, 1999, and concluded on March 28, 1999, when Purdue won its first national championship in any women's sport. The Final Four was held at the San Jose Arena in San Jose, California, on March 26–28, 1999. Purdue defeated Duke 62-45 in Carolyn Peck's final game as head coach for the Boilermakers. She had previously announced her intention of leaving Purdue after two seasons to coach the expansion WNBA Orlando Miracle.\nThe two finalists had recent \"off the court\" history. Duke's coach, Gail Goestenkors, was a former assistant coach at Purdue under Lin Dunn until becoming the Blue Devils' head coach in 1992. Dunn's firing from Purdue in 1996 and the subsequent player defections resulted in the unusual scenario that two Blue Devil players in the championship game had formerly transferred from Purdue. Purdue's Ukari Figgs was named Most Outstanding Player.\nNotable events.\nTennessee, which had won the prior three national championships, was selected as a No. 1 seed, and started out strongly, beating Appalachian State, 113–54. They continued on easily through the second and third rounds, then faced Duke in the East regional final. Duke was the 3 seed, but had upset Old Dominion 76–63 to reach the regional final. Tennessee and Duke had met in the regular season, with the Lady Vols winning by 14. The game was played in North Carolina, but Tennessee fans outnumbered Duke fans. Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw, generally considered the top player in the college game, missed her first ten shots, and ended up with only eight points, her lowest point total of the year. Duke reached an eleven-point lead in the first half, but Tennessee started the second half strong, hitting four baskets in a row, and cut the lead to four points. Duke went over five minutes without scoring a basket, but Tennessee could only cut the lead to a single point. Duke's Georgia Schweitzer tied her career high with 22 points, and the Blue Devils advanced to the Final Four for the first time in their history.\nConnecticut was the 1 seed in the Mideast regional, and hosted the first two rounds at their home court, Gampel Pavilion. The Huskies won their first game easily, beating St. Francis (PA) by 51 points. The second game, against Xavier, would prove to be very different. Xavier led by as many as ten points in the second half, and with just over two minutes to play, the Musketeers had an eight-point lead, 84–76. UConn scored six consecutive points to tie the game at 84 points each. With 37 seconds left in the game Xavier's Nikki Kremer was fouled, and headed to the line, having hit all eight free throw attempts on the day. She missed both attempts. After Shea Ralph missed a jumper, Tamika Williams snared the rebound and was fouled. With seven seconds left in the game she hit both free throws. Xavier tried two desperation shots, but missed both, and UConn narrowly escaped an upset on their own court.\nGeorgia faced Duke in one of the national semi-finals. Georgia hit nine of their sixteen three-point attempts, and held the Miller twins, who had been averaging 37 points per game, to only 31. Duke led at halftime, then went on a 14–5 run to extend the lead. Georgia later responded with a 13–4 run, but could not take the lead. Duke won the game, 81–69, and advanced to their first championship game.\nLouisiana Tech returned to the Final Four, a year after reaching the championship game. However, Purdue came into the game riding a 30-game winning streak. Purdue's Ukari Figgs scored 18 points in the first half, leading to a 40–27 lead at halftime. The Lady Techsters fought back in the second half, and cut the lead to three points, but Purdue's Stephanie White-McCarty stole the ball for a score, and followed it with a shot-clock-beating basket to extend the lead back to seven points. Louisiana Tech did not get closer again, and the Boilermakers extended their winning streak to 31 games, and a place in the championship match with a 77–63 win.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 1999 NCAA Tournament. Thirty conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1999 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nThirty-four additional teams were selected to complete the sixty-four invitations.\nBids by conference.\nThirty conferences earned an automatic bid. In seventeen cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Thirty-four additional at-large teams were selected from thirteen of the conferences.\n1999 NCAA tournament schedule and venues.\nIn 1999, the field remained at 64 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1-16 in each region. In Round 1, seeds 1 and 16 faced each other, as well as seeds 2 and 15, seeds 3 and 14, seeds 4 and 13, seeds 5 and 12, seeds 6 and 11, seeds 7 and 10, and seeds 8 and 9. In the first two rounds, the top four seeds were given the opportunity to host the first-round game. In all cases, the higher seed accepted the opportunity.\nFirst and Second rounds\nThe following lists the region, host school, venue and the sixteen first and second round locations:\nRegional semifinals and finals\nThe Regionals, named for the general location, were held from March 20 to March 22 at these sites:\nEach regional winner advanced to the Final Four held March 26 and March 28 in San Jose, California at the San Jose Arena\nBids by state.\nThe sixty-four teams came from thirty-one states. California had the most teams with six bids. Nineteen states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nBrackets.\nData source\nRecord by conference.\nFourteen conferences had more than one bid, or at least one win in NCAA Tournament play:\nSixteen conferences went 0-1: Big Sky Conference, Big South Conference, Big West Conference, Ivy League, MAAC, MAC, Mid-Continent, MEAC, Midwestern Collegiate, Northeast Conference, Ohio Valley Conference, Patriot League, Southern Conference, Southland, SWAC, and Trans America"

        "title": "Playfair Cricket Annual",
        "text": "Playfair Cricket Annual is a compact annual about cricket that is published in the United Kingdom each April, just before the English cricket season is due to begin. It has been published every year since 1948. Its main purposes are to review the previous English season and to provide detailed career records and potted biographies of current players. It is produced in a \"pocket-sized\" format, being approximately 5×4 in (i.e., about 13×10 cm), so that it is a convenient size for carrying to cricket matches. The front cover of each edition has featured a photograph of a prominent current cricketer. There is a popular myth that this \"honour\" has a \"hex\" or \"curse\" associated with it, as the player featured then invariably has a poor season.\nPublications.\nThe original publisher was Playfair Books Ltd of London, which had its office at Curzon Street when the first edition was published in April 1948; the company relocated soon afterwards to Haymarket. The name Playfair was chosen because it reads as \"play fair\", as confirmed by C B Fry who began his foreword to the first edition in 1948: \"This Playfair Annual (and what a proper title for a book about the Noble Game) will commend itself to innumerable readers\". The first editor was Peter West who was succeeded in 1954 by Gordon Ross. Roy Webber was the statistician at Playfair for many years and was described by West as \"that ace of statisticians\".\nThe \"Playfair Cricket Annual\" is one of a series of similar pocket sized sporting annuals published under the Playfair name. Others have included \"Playfair Football Annual\", \"Playfair Rugby League Annual\" and \"Playfair Racing Annual\". In addition the Playfair name was used for record books produced by Roy Webber and for the magazine Playfair Cricket Monthly. A number of tour brochures were also produced by Playfair Books.\nBetween 1948 and 1962 the annual was a larger size, 4¾×7¼ in (12×18 cm) and had a different style, being printed on glossy paper and including numerous photographs. In 1962 the Playfair titles were acquired by Dickens Press which had just published \"The Cricket Annual\", edited by Roy Webber. In 1963, Dickens published a new style \"Playfair Cricket Annual\", keeping the same name but basing the size, format and price on \"The Cricket Annual\". Therefore, the 2013 edition is the 66th in total, but the annual has been published in its current compact size only since the 1963 edition (the 16th).\nIn addition, \"Playfair Cricket World Cup Guide\", in 1996, and \"Playfair Cricket World Cup 1999\" were published in the same format as the regular annual to cover the International limited overs competitions in India/Pakistan/Sri Lanka and England/Scotland/Ireland/Netherlands in those years respectively. Both of those were also edited by Bill Frindall.\nThe current publisher is Headline Publishing Group with Ian Marshall, who succeeded Bill Frindall on an acting basis in 2009 and permanently for the 2010 edition, as editor. There are several specialist contributors, notably Philip Bailey who compiles the career records.\nThe following tables provide a summary of each annual by reference to editor, size and price:\nLarger format: 1948–1962.\nIn each of the first 15 editions there was a 16-page photographic section in addition to the numbered pages. The 1948 annual was actually called \"Playfair Books Cricket Annual\" but subsequent years were simply called \"Playfair Cricket Annual\". There were two issues of the 1948 annual with a difference in the back cover. One had a Playfair logo, the other a Schweppes advertisement.\nCompact format: 1963–present.\nFor the forerunners to the annual in this format see The Cricket Annual. \n \nFrom the 1998 edition onwards a thumbnail picture also appeared on the spine of the annual. This has been a smaller version of the front cover photograph except in 1998 and 2008, when it was the back cover picture, and in 2006, 2010 and 2023 when the Ashes urn was depicted.\nCompact format: World Cup Guides.\nApart from those on the covers, there are no photographs in any of the annuals from 1963.\nEleven cricketers of the year.\nFrom 1950 to 1962 the annual produced a list of its Eleven Cricketers of the Year for the previous season. Tony Lock was selected 7 times, Peter May 6 times.\nCounty register, averages, and records.\nSince the first compact edition of 1963, the core of the publication has been a section providing a county by county list of current cricketers with potted biographies, their county averages in the previous season together with some introductory notes on the county and the major county records.\nThe county clubs are listed in alphabetical order. Until 1962, the biographies occupied less space and were not sorted by county club. Introductory information about each county club has expanded, largely because of the introduction of limited overs cricket competitions. A much longer list of officials is now given; originally only the secretary and captain were given. Until 1972 most editions gave potted scores for each club's home matches but lack of space caused this to be removed.\nCurrent contents.\nCurrently, the annual's contents typically include:\nStatus of matches.\nAs one of the leading statistical cricket publications, Playfair has to take a view on the status of Test, One Day International, first-class and domestic one-day (i.e. List A) matches. It generally complies with the statistics published by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and will sometimes ignore official rulings: e.g., the ICC ruling that South African rebel tours between 1981–82 and 1989–90 were not first-class matches. The 2010 edition overturned Frindall's long-held view that the match between Australia and an ICC World XI in 2005/06 should not be regarded as a Test Match and now includes it in its Test record section."

Their first matches were in January 2006 when they played a triangular series against Kenya A and Uganda.\nHistory.\nKenya played in the African regional qualifiers for the 2009 World Cup in December 2006 against Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. They performed poorly in the tournament, finishing in last place.\nIn 2008, Sarah Bhakita scored an unbeaten 186 against Rwanda to become the second woman in the world to achieve the feat in an international match.

        "text": "The 1984 Giro d'Italia was the 67th running of the Giro. It started in Lucca, on 17 May, with a prologue and concluded in Verona, on 10 June, with a individual time trial. A total of 171 riders from nineteen teams entered the 22-stage race, that was won by Italian Francesco Moser of the Gis Gelati–Tuc Lu team. The second and third places were taken by Frenchman Laurent Fignon and Italian Moreno Argentin, respectively.\nAmongst the other classifications that the race awarded, Urs Freuler of Atala–Campagnolo won the points classification, Fignon of Renault–Elf won the mountains classification, and Renault–Elf's Charly Mottet completed the Giro as the best neo-professional in the general classification, finishing twenty-first overall. Renault–Elf finishing as the winners of the team classification, ranking each of the twenty teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. The team points classification was won by Metauro Mobili–Pinarello.\nTeams.\nA total of nineteen teams were invited to participate in the 1984 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 171 cyclists. Riders represented a total of 18 countries. The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager are introduced in front the media and local dignitaries – took place at the Piazza San Marco in Lucca on 16 May. Robin Morton, the team manager of the Gianna-Motta-Linea MD team, was the first female team manager ever in the Giro d'Italia. From the riders that began this edition, 143 made it to the finish in Merano.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nTeam managers when asked about the favorite entering the race felt there was no clear favorite to win. \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" felt four riders – Francesco Moser (Gis Gelati–Tuc Lu), Laurent Fignon (), Giuseppe Saronni (), and Roberto Visentini () – had the best chances to win, but \"there is no man who knows how to dominate.\" When asked about his biggest challenge, Moser stated: \"First, Visentini, because last year he was second, he has a very homogeneous squad and is the Italian runner in better shape...\" Ángel Ruocco of \"El País\" felt that the race would be between 1983 Tour de France champion Fignon and Saronni, the winner of the Giro the previous year. He added that Silvano Contini, Mario Beccia, and Fignon as other challengers. Marino Lejarreta () who rode the 1984 Vuelta a España to prepare, as well as Alberto Fernández () who displayed great results when the race reached the Apennines last year.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1984 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani on 18 February 1984. Covering a total of , it included four time trials (three individual and one for teams), and eleven stages with categorized climbs that awarded mountains classification points. Five of these eleven stages had summit finishes: stage 3, to Madonna di San Luca; stage 5, to Blockhaus; stage 16, to Bardonecchia; stage 19, to Selva di Val Gardena; and stage 20, to Arabba. The organizers chose to include two rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter and contained the same number of time trials and rest days. In addition, this race contained the same number of stages.\nClassification Leadership.\nFour different jerseys were worn during the 1984 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro. Time bonuses of 20, 10, and 5 seconds were awarded to each stage's first three finishers.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the originally the Stelvio Pass, but it was changed to the Pordoi Pass. The first rider to cross the Pordoi Pass was French rider Laurent Fignon. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing).\nAlthough no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time. There was another team classification that awarded points to each team based on their riding's finishing position in every stage. The team with the highest total of points was the leader of the classification.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nAftermath.\nSince the race's conclusion, the race has been marred by accusations of race officials favoring Francesco Moser. On several occasions, Moser was seen drafting behind team cars and being pushed up mountains which is not allowed in the race rules. Moser was not penalized the times he committed the violations, but several other riders in the race were punished by officials when they committed the same infractions. Renault manager Cyrille Guimard especially upset with Moser's lack of punishment because his rider, Fignon, was awarded a twenty-second penalty for receiving food outside of the feed zone. Another instance appeared when the race officials cancelled the crossing of the Stelvio Pass during the eighteenth stage. Snow had fallen on the Stelvio and was thought to be able to be cleared by the day of the stage as race director Vincenzo Torriani had photos showing that it could be done. The French magazine Vélo published photos of the pass being clear of snow and open to the public. However, the day before the stage, the snow had yet to be cleared. There's speculation that a government official from Trent – Moser's hometown – would not allow the Giro to cross the Stelvio. The race was re-routed to go over the Tonale Pass and Palade Pass. The changes in the stage resulted in another collective finish of the general classification contenders, thus keeping the time gaps the same and playing into the hand of Moser. 1986 race winner Roberto Visentini quit the race because he felt the it was being fixed..\n In the final time trial, TV helicopters have been accused of flying low behind Moser in order to propel him forward, increasing his speed. Fignon told the media that the helicopters were flying in front of him in order to slow his pace.\nFignon later published an autobiography in 2010 entitled \"We Were Young and Carefree: The Autobiography of Laurent Fignon\" where he discussed this edition of the Giro. He wrote that the \"breaches in the rules were obvious\" and that Moser had received many pushes from spectators while climbing during the twentieth stage. Fignon elaborated on the final time trial, stating that the helicopter pilot \"almost mowing the number off of my back with his rotorblades.\" He stated the helicopter's turbulence slowed him down and also nearly crashed him a few times during the stage. Ultimately, Fignon felt that if the entire race was run according to the route and abiding by the rules, he would've won the race. In 2015, Moser was inducted to the Giro d'Italia Hall of Fame. At the ceremony, he received a replica of the modern-day trophy for his victory in the race. Moser spoke of how he and Fignon talked years after the race and he still blamed his victory on the helicopter, while Moser insisted that the cheering from the crowds is what motivated him to perform so well during the day. He further commented on Fignon: \"Poor Fignon! He lost two Grand Tours on the last day and in time trials, too. If either of those races had ended with a climb, it would have been a very different story.\""

        "title": "History of women's cricket",
        "text": "The history of women's cricket can be traced back to a report in \"The Reading Mercury\" on 26 July 1745 and a match that took place between the villages of Bramley and Hambledon near Guildford in Surrey.\nThe \"Mercury\" reported:\nEarly years in England.\nEarly matches were not necessarily genteel affairs. A match, on 13 July 1747, held at the Artillery Ground between a team from Charlton and another from Westdean and Chilgrove in Sussex spilled over into the following day after it was interrupted by crowd trouble. Contemporary records show that women's matches were played on many occasions between villages in Sussex, Hampshire and Surrey. Other matches, often held in front of large crowds with heavy betting on the side, pitted single women against their married counterparts. Prizes ranged from barrels of ale to pairs of lace gloves. The first county match was held in 1811 between Surrey and Hampshire at Ball's Pond in Middlesex. Two noblemen underwrote the game with 1,000 guineas, and its participants ranged in age from 14 to 60.\nOriginally, cricket deliveries were bowled underarm. Legend has it that the roundarm bowling action was pioneered in the early 19th century by Christiana Willes, sister of John Willes, to avoid becoming ensnared in her skirts. In fact, roundarm was devised by Tom Walker in the 1790s.\nThe first women's cricket club was formed in 1887 at Nun Appleton in Yorkshire and named the White Heather Club. In 1890, a team known as the Original English Lady Cricketers, toured England, playing in exhibition matches to large crowds. The team was highly successful until its manager absconded with the profits, forcing the ladies to disband. James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual for 1890 has a photograph of the team and short article on women's cricket. \"As an exercise, cricket is probably not so severe as lawn tennis, and it is certainly not so dangerous as hunting or skating; and if, therefore, the outcome of the present movement is to induce ladies more generally to play cricket, we shall consider that a good result has been attained.\"\nThe Women's Cricket Association was founded in 1926. The England team first played against The Rest at Leicester in 1933 and undertook the first international tour to Australia in 1934–35, playing the first Women's Test match between England and Australia in December 1934. After winning two tests and drawing one. England travelled on to New Zealand where Betty Snowball scored 189 in the first Test in Christchurch.\nEarly years in Australia.\nThe founding mother of women's cricket in Australia was the young Tasmanian, Lily Poulett-Harris, who captained the Oyster Cove team in the league she created in 1894. Lily's obituary, from her death a few years later in 1897, states that her team was almost certainly the first to be formed in the colonies . Following this, the Victoria Women's Cricket Association was founded in 1905 and the Australian Women's Cricket Association in 1931. The current competition is run by the Women's National Cricket League.\nThe spread to other countries.\nThe International Women's Cricket Council was formed in 1958 to coordinate women's cricket which was now being played regularly in Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies, Denmark and the Netherlands. Test cricket has now been played by Australia, England, India, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies. 131 women's Test matches have been played to date, the majority featuring England or Australia. Originally these were three-day matches, but since 1985 most have been played over four days. England have played 87 Test matches since their first in 1934, winning 19, losing 11 and drawing 57. Australia have played 67 in the same period, winning 18, losing nine and drawing 40.\nThe highest total is Australia's 569 for six declared against England Women in 1998, and the highest individual score is the 242 recorded by Kiran Baluch for Pakistan Women against West Indies Women at the National Stadium, Karachi in 2003/04. Five other women have scored double centuries. Neetu David of India took eight wickets in an innings against England in 1995/56 and seven wickets have fallen to the same bowler on ten occasions. The best match figures, 13 for 226 were recorded by Shaiza Khan for Pakistan Women against West Indies Women in Karachi in 2003/04. Three English batsmen, Janet Brittin with 1935 runs at 49.61, Charlotte Edwards, 1621 at 49.09 and Rachel Heyhoe-Flint with 1594 at 45.54, head the all-time run scoring lists while six other women have scored more than 1,000 Test runs. Mary Duggan of England took 77 Test wickets at 13.49 while Australia's Betty Wilson took 68 at 11.8. Seven other women have 50 or more victims to their name .\nBetty Wilson was the first player, male or female, to record a century and ten wickets in a Test match, against England at the MCG in 1958. In a remarkable match Australia were bowled out for 38 but gained a first innings lead of three in dismissing England for 35 in reply, with Wilson taking seven for seven. 35 remains the lowest total ever recorded in a women's Test. Australia, thanks to Wilson's century, set England 206 to win but the visitors held on for a draw. In 1985, Australia's Under-21 National Women's Cricket Championship was renamed the Betty Wilson Shield in her honour. Another phenomenal club performance saw right-hander Jan Molyneaux make a record 298 for Olympic v Northcote in Melbourne's A grade final in 1967. Molyneaux also made 252 not out on a separate occasion in a 477 run partnership with Dawn Rae, again for Olympic.\nWomen's cricket in the modern era.\nClub and county cricket in England has undergone constant evolution. There is currently a National Knock-Out Cup and a league structure culminating in a Northern and Southern Premier league. The major county competition is the LV Women's County Championship, while Super Fours, featuring teams named after precious stones, bridges the gap for the elite players between domestic and international competition.\nIn April 1970, MCC's traditional Easter coaching classes at Lord's were attended by Sian Davies and Sally Slowe of Cheltenham Ladies' College (see photo in \"Wisden at Lord's\", page 129) breaking the 'gender barrier'. The first Women's Cricket World Cup was held in England in 1973, funded in part by businessman Jack Hayward, and won by the hosts at Lords in front of Princess Anne. Enid Bakewell and Lynne Thomas, making their international debuts for England, scored unbeaten hundreds against an International XI in Brighton in a stand of 246, a record which stood for a quarter of a century . Lord's staged its first women's Test match in 1979, between England and Australia.\nOne-Day International cricket has been played by Australia, Denmark, England, India, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand. Pakistan, Scotland, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies while Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and International XIs have played in World Cups. 707 ODIs have been played up to the end of the 2009 World Cup. The 455 for 5 smashed by New Zealand Women against Pakistan Women at Hagley Oval, Christchurch in 1996/97 remains the highest team score while the Netherlands Women were bowled out for just 22 against West Indies Women at Sportpark Het Schootsveld in Deventer in 2008.\nThe Women's Cricket Association handed over the running of women's cricket in England to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 1998. In 2005, after the eighth Women's World Cup, the International Women's Cricket Council was officially integrated under the umbrella of the International Cricket Council, and an ICC Women's Cricket Committee was formed to consider all matters relating to women's cricket. The 2009 World Cup, the first held under the auspices of the ICC was won by England, the first English team of either sex to win an ICC competition.\nWomen have beaten male teams to several milestones in one-day cricket. They were the first to play an international Twenty/20 match, England taking on New Zealand at Hove in 2004. The first tie in a one-day international was also between Women's teams, hosts New Zealand tying the first match of the World Cup in 1982 against England, who went on to record another tie against Australia in the same competition. Female wicket keepers were the first to record 6 dismissals in a one-day international, New Zealand's Sarah Illingworth and India's Venkatacher Kalpana both accounting for 6 batsman on the same day in the 1993 World Cup and Belinda Clark, the former Australian captain, is the only female player to have scored a double hundred in an ODI, recording an unbeaten 229 in the 1997 World Cup against Denmark. Pakistan's Sajjida Shah is the youngest player to appear in international cricket, playing against Ireland four months after her 12th birthday. She also holds the record for the best bowling figures in a one-day international, taking 7 wickets for just 4 runs against Japan Women at the Sportpark Drieburg in Amsterdam in 2003. Fast bowler Cathryn Fitzpatrick of Australia took 180 wickets in her one-day international career.\nIn 2009 England batsman Claire Taylor was named one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year , the first woman to be honoured with the award in its 120-year history.\nSince at least 2017 the England and Wales Cricket Board has promoted a short-form variant known as women's softball cricket, which is played in several county leagues in England. The traditional game is sometimes referred to as \"women's hardball cricket\" where a distinction needs to be made."

        "title": "History of cricket in Sri Lanka",
        "text": "Cricket was introduced to Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) in the first quarter of the 19th century, following colonisation of the island by the British. The earliest known match was recorded in 1832 and the earliest first-class one in 1926. The national team has played Test cricket from 1982. The national team has achieved international success by winning the 1996 Cricket World Cup and the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. Cricket is played nationwide with Test venues in Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Moratuwa. The country's most notable players include Aravinda de Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga, Rangana Herath, Sanath Jayasuriya, Mahela Jayawardene, Muttiah Muralitharan, Kumar Sangakkara and Chaminda Vaas. Administration and governance are performed by Sri Lanka Cricket, which was founded in July 1922 as the Ceylon Cricket Association (CCA). The main domestic competition is the Premier Trophy which attained first-class status in 1988.\nDevelopment.\nIntroduction of cricket.\nCricket was introduced to Ceylon by the British and the first recorded match is dated 1832. The earliest definite mention of cricket in Ceylon was a report in the \"Colombo Journal\" on 5 September 1832 which called for the formation of a cricket club. The Colombo Cricket Club was formed and matches began soon afterwards when it played, on the Rifle Green in Colombo, against a team from the 97th Regiment of Foot which was stationed on the island from 1825 to 1836. Through the 19th century, cricket was essentially the preserve of European settlers and visitors but it gradually attracted the native Ceylonese who were, at first, often needed to make up the numbers.\nVisiting teams.\nIn October 1882, Ivo Bligh's England team played an odds (18 against 11) game in Colombo \"versus\" a team of Europeans. Bligh's team was \"en route\" to Australia, where their mission was to \"recover those Ashes\". In 1888–89, an English team led by George Vernon toured Ceylon and India, including an 11-a-side game against All-Ceylon at Kandy. In 1890, the Australian team \"en route\" to England played in Colombo. The first Indian team to tour Ceylon was from Elphinstone College, Bombay, in 1903–04. The first of numerous visits by Marylebone Cricket Club was in 1911–12, when they played a one-day match on their way to Australia. A New South Wales team captained by The Rev. E. F. Waddy toured in January 1914, playing nine matches. Among other English teams was Sir Julien Cahn's XI, which played five matches in 1936–37.\nCCA foundation and international aspirations.\nDr John Rockwood was a noted administrator in Ceylonese cricket and he proposed the creation of a national board to govern and promote the game. This was founded in July 1922 as the Ceylon Cricket Association (CCA), the forerunner of Sri Lanka Cricket. The inaugural first-class match in Ceylon was played 12–13 February 1926 between Rockwood's Ceylon XI and W. E. Lucas' Bombay XI at the Nondescripts Ground in Colombo. Bombay included the Indian Test batsman C. K. Nayudu. Ceylon won by 7 wickets. Five years later, a private international team, including Jack Hobbs, Herbert Sutcliffe, C. K. Nayudu and Syed Mushtaq Ali toured Ceylon and were well matched against the All-Ceylon and native Ceylonese teams they played against, but they easily defeated a European team, thus proving that the standard of the Ceylonese players exceeded that of the Europeans.\nFor many years first-class cricket was restricted to games by Ceylon against visiting touring teams, notably the English and Australian teams who used the island as a stopover on the long voyage to each other's country. Douglas Jardine's \"bodyline\" team was there in 1932–33. The first visit by a New Zealand team was in October 1937 to play a one-day match in Colombo. In the aftermath of World War II, the Australian Services team, featuring Keith Miller, toured Ceylon and India. Miller returned as part of the 1948 Australian team which played a game in Colombo \"en route\" to England, but it was not until the 1969–70 season that another Australian team came to Ceylon. The first visits to Ceylon by Pakistan and West Indies were both in 1949, in each case to play two internationals. Ceylon were no match for either of them as their teams included the likes of Fazal Mahmood (Pakistan), Everton Weekes and Clyde Walcott (both West Indies).\nCeylon v India.\nOccasionally, teams representative of Ceylon played matches abroad, mostly in India. The first such tour took place in 1932–33. The Indian national team visited Ceylon in March 1945 and played an international match against Ceylon at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo. The match was drawn on account of bad weather. India's team was a strong one captained by Vijay Merchant and including notable players such as Shute Banerjee, Syed Mushtaq Ali, Lala Amarnath, Vijay Hazare and Rusi Modi.\nFrom 1953–54 until 1975–76, the CCA organised a first-class match against Madras (latterly renamed Tamil Nadu) for the Gopalan Trophy. This fixture was played in Colombo roughly every two years, with one further fixture in 1982–83, the venue alternating with Madras.\nIn the 1956–57 season, India visited again and played two internationals in Colombo, both of which were drawn. India's team was captained by Polly Umrigar and included Nari Contractor, Subhash Gupte, Pankaj Roy, A. G. Kripal Singh and Vijay Manjrekar. In 1964-65 Ceylon had their first international victory when they defeated India in India by four wickets.\nTour of England in 1968 (cancelled).\nAfter beating a Pakistan A team in Ceylon and a full Indian team in India in 1964–65, Ceylon looked to a tour of England in 1968 to advance their case to be elevated to Test status. A schedule of 19 matches was arranged from early June to early August, including a match at Lord's against the MCC, nine first-class matches against county teams, and five other first-class matches.\nHowever, the Board of Control for Cricket in Ceylon had insufficient money to pay for the trip, and private donations had to be sought. Also, the government was reluctant to release the necessary foreign exchange at a time when it was struggling to afford vital imports.\nThe final straw was the selection of the team in April 1968. Chandra Schaffter, one of the four selectors, resigned when he found that the other selectors were going to select each other in the team, one of them as captain. The selected team was Herbert Fernando (captain), Michael Tissera (vice-captain), Ranjit Fernando, Abu Fuard, Gamini Goonesena, Stanley Jayasinghe, T. B. Kehelgamuwa, Dan Piachaud, Anurudda Polonowita, Mano Ponniah, Buddy Reid, Daya Sahabandu, Anura Tennekoon and Dhansiri Weerasinghe. Herbert Fernando and Dhansiri Weerasinghe were the two selectors who chose themselves. The resultant uproar caused the tour to be cancelled in May, just days before the team was scheduled to leave.\nInternational success.\nThe name of the country changed from Ceylon to Sri Lanka on 22 May 1972. Sri Lanka's performance in its two matches against Pakistan in 1973-74 led the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan, A. H. Kardar, to urge the International Cricket Conference (ICC) to consider promoting Sri Lanka to Test status.\nThe Sri Lankan national team made its first appearance in top-class international cricket at the 1975 Cricket World Cup in England. They were easily beaten by the eventual tournament winners, West Indies, who bowled them out for only 86 runs. Sri Lanka made a good impression in their match against Australia, losing by 52 runs after scoring 276 for 4 in response to Australia's 328 for 5.\nSri Lanka continued to perform well at international level and won the 1979 ICC Trophy. A youth development program instituted by the CCA ensured a continuing supply of good players through domestic competition. The country's progress was duly noted by the International Cricket Council, which awarded its Full Member status to Sri Lanka on 21 July 1981. Sri Lanka became the eighth nation to play Test cricket. The inaugural Test was played at Colombo's Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in February 1982 against England, but Sri Lanka lost by 8 wickets.\nSri Lanka won the 1996 Cricket World Cup and the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. Spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan established a world record for the highest number of wickets taken by a bowler in a Test career with 800 from 1992 to 2010.\nDomestic cricket.\nPremier Trophy.\nIn 1937–38, the first national domestic competition was established when 12 teams competed for the Daily News Trophy. The tournament's title was changed to the Saravanamuttu Trophy in 1950–51 and then the Robert Senanayake Trophy in 1976–77. After Sri Lanka began playing Test cricket in 1982, sponsorship was acquired and the tournament was re-branded as the Lakspray Trophy for the 1988–89 season when, for the first time, it was designated a first-class competition. Subsequently, the title of Saravanamuttu Trophy was resurrected from 1990 and since 1998 it has been called the Premier Trophy. The most successful team has been Sinhalese Sports Club.\n\"For a full list of winners from 1938, see\" : Premier Trophy.\nPremier Limited Overs tournament.\nThe first limited overs cricket tournament in Sri Lanka was Brown's Trophy in 1988–89. Only four teams competed in the inaugural competition: Sinhalese Sports Club (winners); Nondescripts Cricket Club (runners-up); Galle Cricket Club; and the Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club. The tournament was renamed the Hatna Trophy in 1990–91 and then given its current name, Premier Limited Overs Tournament, in 1998–99.\n\"For a full list of winners from 1988, see\" : Premier Limited Overs Tournament.\nLeading players by season.\nThe lists below give the leading first-class run scorers and wicket-takers in each domestic season."

        "title": "Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Purdue Boilermakers basketball team is a men's college basketball program that competes in NCAA Division I and is a founding member of the Big Ten Conference.\nPurdue basketball has the most Big Ten regular season championships with 26 conference titles, and in 2024 became the first Big Ten program to be ranked as the #1 team in America for three consecutive seasons. As of April 2024, Purdue also holds a winning record against all other Big Ten schools in head-to-head match ups.\nThe Boilermakers have reached three NCAA Tournament Final Fours and two NCAA championship games, but have not won an NCAA Championship. The 1931–32 team was retroactively named a national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Purdue has sent more than 30 players to the NBA, including two overall No. 1 picks in the NBA draft.\nPurdue's main rival is the Indiana Hoosiers.\nHistory.\n1896–1916: The early years.\nThe history of Purdue basketball dates back to 1896 with their first game against the Lafayette YMCA. In the 1902–03 season, head coach C.I. Freeman, in his only season, led them to an undefeated 8–0 record. Upon conclusion of the season, the university recognized the popularity of the sport and made it part of the Purdue University Athletic Association. The Boilermakers began play in the Big Ten Conference three years later, with its first championship coming in 1911 under the direction of Ralph Jones.\n1917–1946: Ward Lambert era.\nIn 1917, Ward \"Piggy\" Lambert, a former basketball player at Wabash College, was named head coach of the Boilermakers. What followed was one of the most dominant eras of Purdue Basketball on the conference and national level. Under Lambert, Purdue became a front-runner in the development of the fast-paced game as it is today. In 28 seasons, Lambert mentored 16 All-Americans and 31 First Team All-Big Ten selections, which included the 1932 National Player of the Year John Wooden. Wooden was the first college player to be named a Consensus All-American three times. Lambert compiled a career record of 371–152, a .709 winning percentage. His 228 wins in Big Ten play have been bested by only Indiana's Bob Knight, Michigan State's Tom Izzo, and former Purdue head coach Gene Keady. Lambert won an unprecedented 11 Big Ten Championships, which Bobby Knight later tied for most in conference history. In 1943, the Helms Athletic Foundation retroactively recognized Purdue as its national champion for 1932. The Premo-Porretta Power Poll later recognized the Boilermakers as the 1932 national champion as well.\n1950–1965: Ray Eddy era.\nWard Lambert announced his resignation on January 23, 1946. That same year and the year following, under new head coach Mel Taube, Purdue won both meetings against coach John Wooden's Indiana State team. On February 24, 1947, three students were killed (one of whom died the next day) and 166 people were taken to hospitals after the 3,400-student section of the Purdue Fieldhouse collapsed during a game against Wisconsin.\nCenter Paul Hoffman became the only Boiler to be named a First Team-All Big Ten selection four times in 1947. With third overall-picked teammate Ed \"Bulbs\" Ehlers (who played for John Wooden at South Bend Central High School), the two were the first players in the program's history to be selected in the NBA draft, while Paul Hoffman became the BAA's (original title of the NBA) first player named Rookie of the Year in 1948.\nAfter Mel Taube's four-and-a-half seasons, Ray Eddy, a former player and teammate of Wooden's under Lambert, took over as head coach. During his 15-year tenure, he coached Terry Dischinger and Dave Schellhase, both Consensus All-Americans, and Ernie Hall, the first Purdue junior college transfer and African-American player to wear a Boilermaker uniform. In 1955, his team played one of the longest games in college basketball history, lasting six overtimes in a loss to Minnesota.\n1966–1979: George King era.\nOver the next few decades the Boilermakers enjoyed moderate success, culminating in 1969 when they won their first conference title in 29 years and advanced to the 1969 NCAA Finals game under head coach George King and led by All-American Rick Mount, where they fell to former Purdue great John Wooden and his UCLA Bruins squad. Former Los Angeles Lakers coach/general manager, Fred Schaus, who also spent time as West Virginia's head coach, took over the program after George King stepped down to become solely the school's athletic director. Schaus led the Boilermakers to the 1974 NIT Championship, becoming the first Big Ten team to capture the NIT title. In the 1978–79 season, new head coach Lee Rose introduced Purdue basketball to a new approach with a slowed-down, controlled style of play. With All-American center Joe Barry Carroll, he led them to the 1979 NIT Finals and to a 1980 NCAA Final Four appearance.\n1980–2005: Gene Keady era.\nIn 1980, Gene Keady, the head coach of Western Kentucky and former assistant to Eddie Sutton with the Arkansas Razorbacks, was named the new head coach of the Boilermakers. Over the next 25 years, Keady led the Boilermakers to six Big Ten Championships, 17 NCAA Tournament appearances with two Elite Eights and no Final Fours. Purdue received their highest Associated Press and Coaches Poll ranking in its program's history during the 1987–88 season, where they were ranked as high as 2nd in the nation. They were ranked 1st in the nation during the 2021–2022 season. In 1991, Keady and assistant coach Frank Kendrick recruited Glenn Robinson, who ultimately became an All-American and Purdue's second-named National Player of the Year. A few years later, Purdue managed to recruit the program's first of several foreign players when they picked up Matt ten Dam from the Netherlands. In December 1997, Keady became Purdue's all-time winningest head coach, surpassing Lambert with his 372nd win. He also became the second-winningest coach in Big Ten history behind Indiana's Bobby Knight, against whom Keady went 21–20 in head-to-head meetings. Soon afterward, the playing surface at Mackey Arena was named Keady Court in his honor.\nMany of Keady's former assistant coaches and players throughout the years have gone on to enjoy success as head coaches. Included in the Gene Keady coaching tree is current Purdue head coach Matt Painter, former St. John's head coach Steve Lavin, former Pittsburgh head coach Kevin Stallings, former Kansas State head coach Bruce Weber, former Wisconsin–Green Bay head coach Linc Darner, former UNC Charlotte head coach Alan Major, former Missouri and current Missouri State head coach Cuonzo Martin, former Missouri State head coach and current Purdue assistant coach Paul Lusk, and former Illinois State head coach Dan Muller.\nFollowing the 1998–99 season, the NCAA placed Purdue on two years' probation due to minor violations over recruiting, benefits, and ethics. Purdue also lost one scholarship per season for the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons. Most severely, Purdue assistant Frank Kendrick was found to have provided an illegal benefit to Purdue player Luther Clay, who transferred to Rhode Island after his freshman year, namely a $4,000 bank loan. Clay was found to be ineligible due to his extra benefit, so Purdue forfeited all 19 victories in which Clay played, including one win in the 1996 NCAA tournament.\n2005–present: Matt Painter era.\nAs the Keady era came to a close in 2005, the Matt Painter era began. Painter played for Keady during the early 1990s, with Keady naming him captain in his senior year in 1993. After one season at Southern Illinois as the head coach after Bruce Weber left north for Illinois, Painter was hired as a planned replacement for Coach Keady for the 2004–05 season as Keady's associate head coach. After a disappointing first season marred with injuries and suspensions from off-court altercations, Painter re-energized Purdue basketball in the summer of 2006 by signing the top recruiting class in the conference and made one of the biggest turnarounds in the program's history. His \"Baby Boilers\" developed into three eventual All-Americans, including 2011 consensus selection JaJuan Johnson, that led Purdue to four consecutive NCAA Tournaments and back-to-back Sweet Sixteen appearances, a Big Ten title, and a conference tournament championship. During the 2010 season, Matt Painter led the Boilermakers to a school record-tying 14–0 start, as well with the most wins in a season with a 29–6 record and a Big Ten title. The season ended in relative disappointment, however, as Junior Robbie Hummel was sidelined with an ACL injury in February of that season. The following year, and with the anticipated return of Hummel, E'Twaun Moore, and Johnson, Purdue looked poised to have one of its program's finest seasons. This excitement was quickly tempered when Hummel re-tore his ACL on the first practice of the season, sidelining him for its duration once again. Despite Hummel's absence, Purdue remained in the top ten most of the season, being ranked as high as 6th and finished the regular season with a 26–8 record. At the conclusion of the 2010–2011 season, Johnson and Moore declared for the NBA draft. On June 23, 2011, both Johnson and Moore were drafted to the Boston Celtics in the first and second rounds, respectively. Purdue began the 2012 season with a 12–3 record, holding the fifth best home winning streak in the nation with 27, before leading the nation with the fewest turnover average per game. The home winning streak was lost during the 2012 season to Alabama. They finished with a 10–8 conference record, giving Purdue its sixth consecutive 22+ win season, the best in the program's history. In the 2012 NBA draft, Robbie Hummel was the 58th overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves. The following two seasons brought slim success, missing out on both the NCAA Tournament and the NIT. They accepted a bid in the 2013 CBI, where they lost in the second round to Santa Clara. After a moderate 8–5 preseason campaign during the 2015 season, Purdue got back on track, finishing 3rd in the conference after finishing last the season prior. The 2015 season ended after losing to Cincinnati in overtime. It was the first time the program lost its opener in the NCAA Tournament since 1993, breaking a 14-game win streak. After making it back to the NCAA tourney, the program landed its biggest recruit in nearly a quarter century when Fort Wayne native Caleb Swanigan, a top ten recruit, de-committed from Michigan State. They opened the 2016 season with an 11–0 record, while setting a program record with consecutive double-digit victories and were ranked as high as 9th in the nation. That season ended with an NCAA First Round loss to Little Rock with a 26–9 record. In May 2016, it was announced that the 2017–18 Purdue team would represent the U.S. at the 2017 World University Games in Taipei. The team went on to win the silver medal at the Games, winning every game until losing to Lithuania in the gold medal game.\nPurdue won the outright 2017 Big Ten Conference title, along with Caleb Swanigan being named unanimous B1G Player of the Year. In the 2017 NCAA Tournament, Purdue reached the Sweet Sixteen, losing to #1 seed Kansas. In the 2017–2018 season, Purdue, led by seniors Vince Edwards, Isaac Haas, PJ Thompson, Dakota Mathias and sophomore Carsen Edwards, spent several weeks at #3 while being on a program record and nation-leading 19-game winning streak. During that time, the Boilers led the nation in scoring margin, points per game, three-point shooting, and was one of only two teams with a top 3 ranking in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Purdue missed out on a consecutive B1G title after losing to Wisconsin, finishing 2nd in the conference at 15–3. The Boilers were seeded 4th in the Big Ten tournament, where they beat Rutgers and Penn State to reach the Big Ten tournament Championship for the second time in three years. They faced a familiar opponent in Michigan, whom they had already faced two other times throughout that season, Purdue winning both meetings. However, Michigan beat Purdue 75–66 to become Big Ten tournament Champions for the second straight season.\nPurdue was seeded 2nd in the East Region of the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, their highest seed in recent history. In the first round, they faced Cal State Fullerton Titans, winning 74–48. However, many Purdue fan's hearts broke in the second half of the game, as senior Center Isaac Haas fell on his elbow as he fought for a rebound, and broke his elbow as he hit the ground, ending his Purdue Basketball career. Purdue's second-round game was against Butler Bulldogs, whom Purdue had already played earlier in the season. The Boilers won the game on a last second shot by Dakota Mathias, winning 76–73 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the second straight season. In the Sweet Sixteen, Purdue faced the third seeded Texas Tech Red Raiders. The Boilers went on to lose in disappointing fashion 65–78, ending their season with 30 wins.\nIn 2019, Purdue was seeded 3rd in the South Region of the 2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, after another strong season. In the first round, they eliminated a 26–8 Old Dominion team that was coming off a Conference USA championship, winning 61–48. In the second round, they handily defeated #6 seed Villanova, sending the defending champs home early after an 87–61 victory, and advancing to their third straight Sweet Sixteen under Matt Painter. The Boilermakers ran into their first real test with the #2 Tennessee Volunteers. After a back and forth contest that included 17 lead changes and needed overtime to be decided, Purdue came out victorious, barely beating the Vols 99–94 to reach their first Elite Eight in nearly 20 years. In the Elite Eight, Purdue faced the #1 seeded Virginia Cavaliers in what was another back and forth thriller.\nAfter several lead changes throughout the game, and a 40-point effort from Carsen Edwards including 10 made 3s, Purdue led 70–67 with 5.9 seconds left and looked to be headed to their first Final Four since 1980. Virginia's Ty Jerome was fouled intentionally, and missed the second free throw of two after making the first. Virginia was able to come up with the offensive rebound, and after chasing down the loose ball that had gone into the Virginia back court, toss the ball to Mamadi Diakite who hit a free-throw line floater at the buzzer to send the game to overtime tied at 70. The Boilermakers once again looked to be en route to the Final Four, leading 75–74 with 43 seconds to go. However Virginia was able to hold Purdue scoreless over the final minute and prevailed 80–75, ending the Boilermakers season with 26 wins and their first Elite Eight appearance since 2000.\nAfter the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Purdue picked up where they had left off in 2019, only this time they were the 4th seed in the South region of the 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Their first-round matchup was against 13th-seeded North Texas, where they came back from behind 32–24 at the half to send the game to OT. Ultimately, once there, Purdue couldn't score until the last 30 seconds of overtime, and North Texas pulled off the 78–69 upset.\nThe 2022 season saw the Boilermakers reach #1 in the AP Poll for the first time in program history, led by senior Trevion Williams, and All-American sophomore guard Jaden Ivey. In the 2022 tournament, Purdue reached the Sweet Sixteen after a second round win over Texas, only to lose to the Cinderella story of that year's tournament, the 15-seeded Saint Peter's Peacocks.\nThe following year, Purdue put together a 29–5 season that again had them reach #1 in the AP poll at various points in the season, and saw them win the Big 10 regular-season and postseason tournament championship, leading to a #1 seed in the East Region of the 2023 NCAA Tournament. Center Zach Edey was also voted the third player in Purdue history to win National Player of the Year honors. They then became the second team in NCAA Tournament history to be upset by a 16-seed, falling 63–58 to Fairleigh Dickinson in the First Round, suffering the biggest upset in NCAA tournament history with Purdue being -point favorites heading into the game.\nPurdue was awarded a #1 seed for the second consecutive year in the 2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, this time in the Midwest Region. They cruised into the Sweet Sixteen with routs against 16 seed Grambling State, 78–50, and 8 seed Utah State, 106–67. With the victory against Utah State, they achieved their 31st win of the season, breaking the program record of most wins in a season. They then defeated 5 seed Gonzaga, 80–68, following a second-half surge, and moved on to the Elite Eight.\nThere the Boilermakers met a familiar foe in the tournament, 2 seed Tennessee. Zach Edey scored 40 points to go along with 16 rebounds, leading the Boilermakers to a 72–66 victory and a trip to the Final Four in Phoenix, the first under Matt Painter's tenure and the first since 1980. They lost the 2023–24 National Championship Game to UConn.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Boilermakers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 34 times. Their combined record is 49–35; due to use of an ineligible player, Purdue vacated one win and one loss from the 1996 NCAA Tournament, resulting in an adjusted official NCAA Tournament record of 48–34.\nNIT results.\nThe Boilermakers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) eight times.

        "text": "The 2006 Asian Games opening ceremony was held on 1 December at the multi-purpose Khalifa International Stadium. The opening ceremony was described by the media to be one of the most breathtaking and technologically spectacular multi-sport event ceremonies in the history of the Asian Games (and also one of the most expensive) at that time. It was created and produced by David Atkins, who had previously helmed the 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Sydney, Australia. and was filmed and broadcast live by International Games Broadcast Services' (IGBS) precursor Doha Asian Games Broadcast Services (DAGBS). 10 composers from Qatar, Lebanon, Egypt, Singapore, Japan, India, South Korea, Germany and Australia composed the score for the ceremonies.\nProceedings.\nPre-ceremonial events.\nPrior to the opening ceremony, Qatari youngsters spent 10 minutes creating a traditional Qatari Al Sadu carpet on the stadium floor. This was followed by youngsters from Aspire Academy, who raced around the stadium chasing Orry, the Games’ mascot to represent Qatar’s bid to make the country the sports capital of the Middle East.\nPreface.\nThe ceremony started with the arrival of Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, OCA chairman Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahad and their wives into the stadium.\nCountdown.\nAfter that, a 10-second countdown projection on the stadium floor began to signal the start of the opening ceremony. A group of 2,300 young people then used flares to form the national flag followed by a message consisting of the Arabic and English greetings \"As-salamu alaykum\" (, \"peace upon to you\").\nMain event.\nA group of children, led by Nasser Khaled Al Kubaisi, then sang Qatar's national anthem to accompany the raising of the national flag by Qatari Armed Forces personnel.\nA cultural performance that told the story of the \"Seeker\" and his journey to Asia was presented, which began with footage that displayed an astronomical zoom from an atom to the universe, the Milky Way, the Solar System and Earth , before stopping at the games' host nation, Qatar. The main protagonist was played by local actor Adel Al Ansari.\nThe artistic segment revolved around a man known as the \"Seeker\" who was born and lived in the nation of Qatar, where the people of the desert and the people of the sea lived harmoniously together. The people of the desert are experts in poetry while the people of the sea are experts in fishing for pearls named \"tears of the moon\". As a boy, he dreamed of following a falcon that leads him up to a tower and finds an astrolabe, an instrument used to make astronomical measurements. When the boy grew up into a young man, he left behind his family and his love before he proceeded to begin his adventure in a pearling boat, searching for pearls with a few pearl divers from his homeland, guided only by the stars and his astrolabe. One day, he encountered a fierce storm at sea that overturned the pearling boats of the pearl divers that followed him, causing most of them to get lost and never return to their families. He later encountered a terrifying and colossal half-human half-amphibian sea jinn named Abu Darya (meaning in Arabic \"Lord of the Sea\"), who threatened to destroy his ship and devour him. Fortunately, he was rescued by a giant falcon who defeated the jinn, landing him on safe ground where he continued his path to Asia and discovered its colourful history and cultures. The Angkor Wat, the Taj Mahal, the Temple of Heaven and Borobudur were among the important landmarks he passed. The Seeker was also treated to a multicultural presentation that displayed the cultures of different Asian countries such as China, Japan, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Thailand. Many people in the continent came to greet him, sending him gifts such as gold, silk, spices and incense. Meanwhile, back at the Seeker’s homeland, his love was in despair, waiting for his arrival. With his Asian brothers helping him in his way back to his homeland, the Seeker safely made it back to his love, and invited all of Asia to celebrate their wedding as guests. To honour his guests, the Seeker presented them a troupe of horsemen that put on a special performance. Years later, the Seeker had a son. He showed him the Arab world's contributions to modern science in the past, the present and the future, Qatar's natural resources and the country’s vision for the future.\nDelegates from the 45 countries and regions of Asia entered the stadium after Hong Kong artist Jacky Cheung sang \"Together Now\". As host nation, Qatar enters the stadium last. For the fifth time after the 2000 Summer Olympics, 2002 Asian Games, 2004 Summer Olympics, and the 2006 Winter Olympics, North Korea and South Korea jointly entered the stadium under Korean Unification Flag. Once all the delegates gathered inside the stadium, India's Bollywood star Sunidhi Chauhan sang \"Reach Out\" written by award winning songwriters Paul Begaud and Vanessa Corish. Hundreds of performers brought out dove sculptures and formed the word \"peace.\" Then, the games' organising committee chairman Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Olympic Council of Asia chairman Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah gave their respective speeches and Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani declared the games open. Qatar’s armed forces personnel later raised the flag of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), the games' governing body which was brought in by representatives of Reach Out To Asia (ROTA), a Qatari charity organisation. The flag bore the old logo of the Olympic Council of Asia, which was replaced by a new and current version the following day at the Flag Square of the Asian Games Athletes village. Mubarak Eid Belal (a Qatari volleyball player) took the athletes' oath, while Abdullah Al Balushi (a Qatari football referee) took the judges' oath.\nBefore the torch relay section, Lebanon's Majida El Roumi and Spanish tenor José Carreras performed \"Light the Way\". The torch was relayed into the stadium by bowler Salem Bu Sharbak, volleyball player Mubarak Mustafa, shooter Nasser Al-Atiyya, Mohamed Suleiman, footballer Mansoor Muftah Sheikh and Talal Mansour. Mohammed Bin Hamad Al-Thani, son of the emir and captain of the Qatar equestrian endurance team, rode his horse up the stairs to the top of the stadium to light up the giant cauldron that took the form of a giant astrolabe. The flame was transferred electronically to the Aspire Tower just outside the stadium, and fireworks soon went off, signalling the start of the 2006 Asian Games. The horse nearly slipped in the process and a clip of this incident made it onto the official broadcast.\nParade of Nations.\nAll 45 contingents participated in the parade in English alphabetical order, from Afghanistan to Yemen, with host Qatar marching last. The traditional music of several Asian regions accompanied the athletes as they marched into the stadium.\nWhilst most countries entered under their short names, a few entered under alternative names, sometimes due to political disputes. Taiwan (Republic of China) entered with the compromised name and flag of \"Chinese Taipei\" under T so that they did not enter together with conflicting \"China\", which entered under C. \nNorth Korea and South Korea marched together under the Korean Unification Flag, but competed separately.\nWhile the placards were displayed only in English, the participating countries were announced in English and Arabic."

Before independence in 1980, the New Hebrides were a unique form of colonial territory in which sovereignty was shared by two great powers - Britain and France - instead of exercised by just one. The Condominium divided the New Hebrides into two separate communities — one Anglophone and one Francophone. This divide continues even after independence, with schools either teaching in one language or the other, and between different political parties.\nTeams from Vanuatu have competed with teams from the Solomon Islands although usually with not much success.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s an expatriate team in Port Vila, the Berocca's, regularly played local teams within Port Vila and hosted visiting Australian and New Zealand Navy teams. These games fostered the growth of local rugby and the talent within the local teams."

He is goalkeeping coach at Staveley MWFC.\nPlaying career.\nBowling started his professional career with Lincoln City whom he joined from Gainsborough Trinity in November 1988. Prior to that, he had spent some time with Stafford Rangers and Frecheville CA. During his time with The Imps, Bowling made 51 appearances for the club. He was also sent out on loan to Hartlepool United, Kettering Town and Bradford City.\nFollowing the successful loan spell with Bradford City, Bowling joined them in July 1993. He made 29 appearances joining Mansfield Town in the following season.\nBowling will probably be most remembered as a Stags legend as he spent the best part of five seasons, making 172 appearances for the club. Bowling left Mansfield Town in July 2000 having not been offered a new contract, and in September 2000, joined Kettering Town. In February 2002 he suffered a serious head injury in the game against Tiverton Town when he collided with a goalpost. The injury caused him to miss the remaining thirteen games of Kettering's triumphant Southern Football League Premier Division season. He made his comeback from injury in July 2002.\nHe subsequently joined Worksop Town in May 2003. He joined Stalybridge Celtic on loan in December 2003. He made his debut in the 1–1 home draw with Burscough on 6 December 2003 and made a total of five appearances, four in the league, before returning to Worksop at end of the month. He spent a month on loan at Hucknall Town in September 2004 and the first three months of 2005 on loan at Matlock Town before returning to the Worksop Town first team making his final appearance, before retirement, in April 2005.\nManagerial career.\nBowling remained with Worksop as goalkeeping coach. In early November 2006, Bowling was appointed manager of Worksop Town. This was after a successful period as caretaker manager, where a renewed emphasis on attacking football was rewarded with results on the pitch, and Bowling himself winning his first Manager of the Month award at the end of October that year. He replaced the previous coach, Ronnie Glavin, who left the club by mutual content at the beginning of October 2006. However, he was sacked at the end of the season after Worksop's relegation from the Conference North.\nIn October 2007 he was appointed as goalkeeping coach at Matlock Town, linking up with his former Lincoln City and Kettering Town colleague Phil Brown. He will also combine his role with scouting duties. In May 2015 he joined Staveley Miners Welfare as first team goalkeeping coach."

He is reputed to have been the first Indigenous Australian to play rugby league at first-grade level in Australia.\nClub career.\nGeorge Green played for the club sides Eastern Suburbs for four seasons between 1908–11 and North Sydney for 10 seasons between 1912–1916 and 1918–1922.\nA utility forward, Green made his debut playing for the Eastern Suburbs club in 1908 season, rugby league's founding year in Australia. He played in the Eastern suburbs side in 1911, the year that club won their first premiership. He moved to the North Sydney club the following year where he played for the next ten seasons.\nIn 1916 Green captained the North Sydney club and in 1918-1919 he was Captain-coach.\nGreen was a vice-captain with the Norths during the club's golden era in its only two premiership winning seasons – 1921 and 1922.\nGreen, who has been described as \"scholarly\" and \"trend-setting\" was a crowd favourite, a whole-hearted player who often came up with an important play at vital times in a match. Both on and off the field Green is described as being a gentleman.\nCoaching and administrative career.\nHe is reputed to have been the first chief organizer of The Eastern Suburbs junior league, and coached the winners of the first President Cup competition.\nGreen was made a vice president of the North Sydney club in 1923 and a member of the club's finance committee during his stay.\nFollowing his retirement from the major rugby league administration in Sydney, Green spent time coaching the Lismore Rugby League club in northern N.S.W. where he had great success in 1931. From this League a team was selected by the Queensland Rugby League to play in the prestigious Bulimba Cup.\nHe also coached at the Cessnock club the 1930s. It was during his time at Cessnock, that he unearthed the remarkable talents of a local player, Ray Markham, who had a remarkable career at English club, Huddersfield where played 6 seasons, scored 255 tries and won a Challenge Cup medal.\nGeorge Green gave many lectures in rural N.S.W. educating many players and coaches on the finer points of Rugby League.\nDeath.\nGeorge Green died at his home at Dural, New South Wales on 17 Nov 1938. His funeral was two days later at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium.\nAccolades.\nGeorge Green has been recognized as the Sydney Roosters 20th ever player.\nThe George Green Medal, an award for Indigenous Australian rugby league players, was named in his honour. The Medal was first awarded in 2008.\nGreen's apparent Aboriginality has come into question with University of Western Sydney historian Andrew Moore's suggestion that Green's father was actually of Afro-Caribbean origin. During his lifetime Green told people that he was Polynesian or Maori."

        "title": "History of cricket in India to 1918",
        "text": "The sport of cricket was introduced to the Indian subcontinent by sailors and traders of the English East India Company in the 17th and 18th centuries. The earliest known record of cricket in India dates from 1721 and the first club had been founded by 1792. In the 1886 and 1888 summer seasons, the Parsees cricket team toured England. In the winter of 1889–90, a team of English players was the first to tour India, followed by another in the 1892–93 season. That tour coincided with the beginning of competitive cricket in the country as the Parsees won the prestigious Bombay Presidency Match against the Europeans cricket team. By 1912–13, the tournament had become the Bombay Quadrangular with the addition of the Hindus cricket team and the Muslims cricket team. Similar tournaments began soon afterwards in Calcutta and Madras. By the end of 1918, first-class cricket was established in India.\nEarly developments.\nThe entire history of cricket in the subcontinent (including modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) as a whole is based on the existence and development of the British Raj via the East India Company. On 31 December 1600, Queen Elizabeth I granted a Royal Charter to the English East India Company, often colloquially referred to as \"John Company\". It was initially a joint-stock company that sought trading privileges in India and the East Indies, but the Royal Charter effectively gave it a 21-year monopoly on all trade in the region. In time, the East India Company transformed from a commercial trading venture to one which virtually ruled India as it acquired auxiliary governmental and military functions, until its dissolution in 1858 following the Indian Mutiny. The East India Company was the means by which cricket was introduced into India.\nIn 1639, the Company effectively founded the city of Madras (now Chennai), and in 1661 acquired Portuguese territory on the west coast of India that included Bombay (now Mumbai). In 1690, an Anglo-Mughal treaty allowed English merchants to establish a trading settlement on the Hooghly River, which became Calcutta (now Kolkata). All of these places became leading centres of cricket as the popularity of the game grew among the native population.\nThe British had brought cricket to India by the early 1700s, and the first documented instance of cricket being played anywhere in the sub-continent is a report of English sailors of the East India Company written in 1737. It refers to cricket being played at Cambay, near Baroda in 1721. It was played and adopted by the Kolis of Gujarat. Sea pirates among the Kolis had looted British ships. The East India Company tried to befriend them and, among other things, introduced them to cricket.\nThe Calcutta Cricket and Football Club was known to be in existence by 1792, but was possibly founded more than a decade earlier. In 1799, another club was formed at Seringapatam in south India after the successful British siege and the defeat of Tipu Sultan.\nBeginning of first-class cricket.\nIn 1864, a Madras v. Calcutta match was arguably the start of first-class cricket in India. Indian elites quickly adopted the game, both playing with British teams and with one another.\nThe most important fixture in the 19th century was the Bombay Presidency Match which evolved, first, into the Bombay Triangular and then into the Bombay Quadrangular. The match was first played in 1877 and then intermittently for several seasons until finally being given first-class status in 1892–93.\nAn English team led by George Vernon in 1889–90 was the first foreign team to tour India but none of the matches that it played are considered first-class.\nThe first Indian community which started playing cricket were the Parsees in 1848. By 1892, they became proficient enough to play the Presidency matches against the Europeans.\nFirst-class cricket definitely began in the 1892–93 season with two Europeans v Parsees matches, at Bombay (match drawn) and Poona (Parsees won by 3 wickets). In the same season, Lord Hawke captained an English team that played four first-class matches including a game against \"All India\" on 26–28 January 1893.\nGradually, with the passage of time other communities also started playing cricket. The Hindus started playing first-class cricket in 1907. The tournament became the Triangular tournament. In 1912, the Muslims also entered the arena of first-class cricket. The tournament was then called the Quadrangular Tournament, with four teams – the Europeans, the Parsees, The Hindus and the Muslims – playing each other.\nInternational cricket.\nThe first Indian ventures into international cricket were by the Parsees cricket team which toured England twice in the 1880s. English amateur teams visited India in 1889–90 and 1892–93.\nG. F. Vernon's XI in India, 1889–90.\nAn English cricket team led by G. F. Vernon toured Ceylon and India in the winter of 1889–90. The team played no first-class matches but it was a pioneering tour being the first visit by an English team to India and the second to Ceylon. In all, the team played 13 matches of which 10 were won, 1 was lost and 2 drawn."

        "text": "This article describes the history of South African cricket from its known beginnings until the end of the First World War in 1918.\nTest and first-class cricket were both introduced retrospectively to South Africa in the 1888–89 season by the elevation in status of two matches played by an English touring team against a South African national team. At the same time, the Currie Cup was donated by Sir Donald Currie for the domestic championship and this was first contested in the 1889–90 season. Playing standards rose and a number of provincial teams were able to challenge for the championship, including Eastern Province, Griqualand West, Natal, Transvaal and Western Province. South Africa became increasingly involved in international cricket and the national team undertook six overseas tours (five to England and one to Australia) before 1914. Eight teams, seven English and one Australian, toured South Africa during the period.\nBeginnings.\nEuropean colonisation of southern Africa began on Tuesday, 6 April 1652 when the Dutch East India Company established a settlement called the Cape Colony on Table Bay, near present-day Cape Town. Cape Colony slowly expanded along the coast and into the hinterland throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. It was founded as a victualling station for the Dutch East Indies trade route but soon acquired an importance of its own due to its good farmland and mineral wealth.\nThere was no significant British interest in South Africa until the colony was seized by British forces in 1795 under General Sir James Craig during the French Revolutionary War, the Netherlands having fallen to France in the same year. British policy was to secure the colony against French encroachment in the name of the Dutch Stadtholder Willem V. Under the terms of the short-lived Treaty of Amiens in 1803, Cape Colony was handed back to the Netherlands, then known as the Batavian Republic. In 1806, with the Napoleonic Wars proper now under way, British forces again invaded and seized Cape Colony, this time with permanent designs on it. The whole territory was formally ceded to Great Britain in 1814 by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 and administered as Cape Colony until it joined the Union of South Africa in 1910.\nIt is believed that cricket was introduced to South Africa by Craig's occupying force. A similar scenario had arisen throughout the British Empire. English soldiers and sailors were the pioneers of the game in numerous foreign lands. One of Craig's officers was Charles Anguish (sometimes known as Charles Clarke) who had been a member of the White Conduit Club and was an early member of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Anguish had played in 32 first-class matches between 1788 and 1795 when he departed for the Cape. He died there, by committing suicide, in May 1797.\nIt is generally supposed that Anguish organised matches in the colony but the earliest definite reference to cricket there is dated 1808, two years after the re-occupation. A newspaper called \"The Cape Town Gazzette and African Advertiser\" carried notice that:\nA grand match at cricket will be played for 1,000 dollars a side on Tuesday, January 5, 1808 between the officers of the artillery mess, having Colonel Austen of the 60th Regiment, and the officers of the Colony, with General Clavering. The wickets are to be pitched at 10 o'clock.\nThe venue for the 1808 match is unknown but there was another military match at Green Point in 1810 between the Ordnance and the 87th Regiment. There is a Green Point club, formed in the 1890s, but it is not certain if it is based at the same venue. If so, then it is the oldest known venue in South Africa.\nEarly developments.\nLong before apartheid, cricket was considered \"a white man's pastime\" in South Africa but there is evidence of it being played by Bantus and Hottentots in 1854. Nevertheless, the surviving records are essentially about games played by whites only. H. Rider Haggard suggested that it became \"an obsession\" in the white military community and complained about officers insisting on taking cricket gear with them on the ill-fated Isandlwana mission in 1879.\nBy the middle of the 19th century, cricket had become well-established in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Pietermaritzburg. The first club known to have been formally constituted was in 1843 at Port Elizabeth, which then had a population of 3,000. The club was allocated some land just outside the town which it still uses as St George's Park. A club was founded in Cape Town in 1844 and in Pietermaritzburg by 1848. The military continued to be cricket's pioneer and staged a match at Bloemfontein, then only a small village, in 1850. There was a match in 1852 between clubs from Pietermaritzburg and Durban.\nCape Colony schools had adopted the game by the 1850s. Its growth in the hinterland was gradual and depended on settlers moving north from the Cape. A match was recorded in the Transvaal in 1861. In 1862, an annual fixture called \"Mother Country v Colonial Born\" was staged for the first time in Cape Town and became the most important match of the Cape season for many years. The game's popularity in Cape Town led to the foundation of Western Province Cricket Club in October 1864. In 1876, Port Elizabeth presented the \"Champion Bat\" for competition between South African towns; initially Cape Town, Grahamstown, Kingwilliamstown and Port Elizabeth itself. This competition was played sporadically until 1890 when, with provincial teams now involved, it was superseded by the Currie Cup.\nBeginning of first-class cricket.\nTwo major venues opened in 1888: Newlands in Cape Town and the Old Wanderers in Johannesburg. At the end of the year, an English team arrived for the first overseas tour of South Africa. Known at the time as R. G. Warton's XI after its manager, the team played odds matches against several provincial and town teams. Then, in March 1889, it played two eleven-a-side matches against a South African XI. The first was at St George's Park, the second at Newlands. Warton's XI, captained by the future Hollywood actor C. Aubrey Smith, won both games comfortably; at Cape Town, Lancashire spinner Johnny Briggs had match figures of 15 for 28.\nRetrospectively, these two matches were assigned first-class status, although the South African team was very weak and Warton's XI included some players who never otherwise played any first-class cricket. Then, after the concept of Test cricket had been established in the 1890s, it was officially decided in 1897 that the matches should be called South Africa \"versus\" England and so allocated Test status too. First-class cricket was itself officially defined by MCC and the leading English counties in December 1894. The first match at Port Elizabeth is, therefore, both the inaugural Test played by South Africa and the inaugural first-class match played in South Africa.\nThe tour was successful, although it did not achieve a financial profit, in that it introduced South Africa to international cricket and provided the domestic game with a huge stimulus. This was underwritten by tour sponsor Sir Donald Currie, founder of the Castle Shipping Line, who donated a trophy for the domestic champions. This was the Currie Cup, first awarded in 1889 to Kimberley.\nStart of domestic cricket (1889 to 1891).\nDomestic first-class cricket began in December 1889 when Port Elizabeth Cricket Club hosted Natal at St George's Park, the visitors winning a low-scoring match by two wickets. Natal featured in all of the first five matches, which were played between 27 December and 9 January. Their team, on tour, went from Port Elizabeth to Kimberley where they played two matches against Kimberley at the Eclectics ground in Kimberley, the home team winning both. Natal then played two matches at Newlands against Western Province (won by one wicket) and Cape Town Clubs (lost by three wickets).\nThe Currie Cup was first contested at the end of the 1889–90 season when, as in boxing, a challenge was made to the holders. Transvaal challenged Kimberley and the match began on Saturday, 5 April at the Eclectics ground in Kimberley. Transvaal's captain C. Aubrey Smith and wicket-keeper Monty Bowden had played for Warton's XI the previous year (Bowden had emigrated to South Africa) and their experience gave Transvaal a distinct advantage, enabling them to win by six wickets.\nFour first-class matches were played in the 1890–91 season. The first three were a round-robin between Eastern Province, Western Province and Griqualand West in the Champion Bat Tournament. Western Province were the winners after defeating both their rivals. It was the last Champion Bat Tournament as it was superseded by the Currie Cup thereafter. The fourth match was for the Currie Cup, still on a challenge footing. Former holders Kimberley challenged Transvaal and the match was played in April 1891 at the Old Wanderers in Johannesburg. It was into its seventh day before Kimberley won by 58 runs to reclaim the trophy. This was the last Currie Cup challenge match as the competition went national when next contested in the 1892–93 season.\n1891 to 1902.\nNo domestic matches took place in 1891–92, when England was on tour. In 1892–93, Western Province won the Currie Cup after defeating both their rivals Transvaal by 91 runs and Griqualand West by 109 runs. In the other match, Transvaal beat Griqualand West by 8 wickets.\nFrom then on, although it was not contested every season, the Currie Cup was the established national championship.\nFirst-class cricket in South Africa was suspended during the Boer War from 1899 to 1902\n1903 to 1918.\nIn 1903–04 the Currie Cup had a change in format from a qualifying round-robin followed by a final, for which the holders had already qualified, to a knock-out competition. This allowed for the competition to be held in more than one province. In 1904–05, the competition was expanded to allow for the inclusion of Rhodesia.\nFirst-class cricket was suspended during the First World War from 1914 to 1919. Competition began again in the 1919–20 season.\nInternational tours of South Africa to 1914.\nEngland 1891–92.\nSouth Africa won the toss and batted first. They were soon all out for 97, with John Ferris taking 6 for 54. In reply 134 from Henry Wood saw Walter Read's side total 369, a lead of 272 that South Africa were never likely to catch. Ferris's 7 for 37 helped dismiss the South Africans for 83 in their second innings.\nThe game is more interesting for some historical oddities:\nEngland 1909–10.\nThis tour included The Reef v MCC at Boksburg. It was scheduled as a four-day match but play only took place on two because of bad weather. Although the two teams consisted of recognised players, the South African Board of Control decided as late as 1930 that it had not been a first-class match. Wisden 1931 reproduced a letter from the SABC which outlined its case. Wisden has ignored the ruling and includes the match in the career figures of all the players who took part, including record-breaking players such as Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs and Frank Woolley.\nIt is possible that the SABC thought it was a 2-day match, but Wisden 1911 clearly states that \"not a ball could be bowled on the first and fourth days\" so it was actually planned as a 4-day match. For more information about this curious affair, see Variations in published cricket statistics.\nOverseas tours by South Africa to 1914.\nEngland 1894.\nNo Test matches were played and none of the South African team's matches are rated first-class.\nEngland 1901.\nFifteen first-class and ten minor matches were played, but no Tests.\nEngland 1904.\nA total of 22 matches were played but no Tests.\nEngland 1912.\nSee 1912 Triangular Tournament."

        "text": "The history of United States cricket begins in the 18th century. Among early Americans, cricket was as popular a bat and ball game as baseball. Though Americans never played cricket in great numbers, the game grew for some time. Around the time of the United States Civil War, the game began competing with baseball for participants, but then slowly declined in popularity. This was followed again by a brief golden age with the Philadelphian cricket team. This lasted until roughly the start of World War I; at this time, cricket again became less popular. In the latter part of the 20th century immigrants from cricket-playing nations in South Asia and the West Indies helped spark a resurgence in the game's popularity. This led to participation and success in several International Cricket Council events. In 2007, the United States of America Cricket Association was suspended by the ICC because of problems with its administration, but was again recognized beginning in 2008.\nThe USACA was expelled as the recognized national governing body by the ICC during its 2017 AGM. USA Cricket is now the ICC-recognized national governing body, and is responsible for administering Minor League Cricket, which is currently the highest level of domestic competition in the USA. It is played in the relatively recently invented T20 format of cricket, with games lasting roughly three hours, separating it from the longer-format cricket played throughout most of American history.\nEarly developments.\nCricket was being played in British North America by at least the beginning of the 18th century. The earliest definite reference to American cricket is in the 1709 diaries of William Byrd of Westover on his James River estates in Virginia. By the American Revolution, the game was so popular that the troops at Valley Forge played matches; George Washington himself joined in at least one game of \"wicket.\" John Adams told Congress that if leaders of simple cricket clubs could be called \"presidents,\" the leader of the new nation might be called something more grand. Cricket continued to develop slowly as a recreational sport as America gained independence in 1783.\nA variation of cricket known as wicket was played until the 1800s in the New England area.\nHistory following independence.\nCricket enjoyed its greatest popularity along the East Coast corridor between Philadelphia and New York. A contemporary report notes that upwards of 5,000 people played the game in those cities. In 1833, students at Haverford College established what is generally accepted as the first cricket club exclusively for Americans. This club was short-lived, but helped to keep interest in the sport alive in Philadelphia, leading to the foundation of the Philadelphia Cricket Club in 1854 and the Germantown and Young America clubs in 1855. By this time, Philadelphia had become the unofficial \"Cricket Capital of America.\"\nThe United States participated in the first international cricket match, which saw St George's Cricket Club play Canada on 24 September 1844, at the former Bloomingdale Park in Manhattan. The match was attended by some 10,000 spectators. It is today \"the longest international rivalry in cricket, in fact in any sport.\" Wagers of around $120,000 were placed on the outcome of the match.\nAs late as 1855, the New York press was still devoting more space to coverage of cricket than to baseball.\nSides from England toured the US and Canada after the English cricket seasons of 1859, 1868 and 1872, in tours organized as commercial ventures. The 1859 team comprised six players from the All-England Eleven and six from the United All-England Eleven and was captained by George Parr. They played five matches, winning them all. There were no first-class fixtures. The match at New York attracted a crowd that was claimed to be 10,000, all that the ground would hold.\nThe 1868 tourists were led by Edgar Willsher and those of 1872–3 by R.A. Fitzgerald. The latter side included W.G.Grace.\nMost of the matches of these early English touring teams were played \"against odds\", that is to say the home team was permitted to have more than eleven players (usually twenty-two) in order to make a more even contest.\nIn spite of all this American growth in the game, it was slowly losing ground to a newcomer. In many cities, local cricket clubs were contributing to their own demise by encouraging crossover to the developing game of baseball. After the United States Civil War the Cincinnati Red Stockings brought a talented young bowler from the St. George's Cricket Club in New York to serve as a player and manager of the team. Harry Wright applied the \"scientific\" batting and specialized placement of fielders that he had learned in cricket to his new sport. This development was instrumental in creating the Cincinnati team's undefeated 1869 season. It also helped to secure the place of baseball as one of the most popular sports in the country.\nIt may have been during the Civil War that baseball secured its place as America's game. An army making a brief stop at a location could easily organise a game of baseball on almost any clear patch of ground, while cricket required a carefully prepared pitch. Baseball began to poach players and administrators from the world of cricket. Nick Young, who served for 25 years as the president of the National League, was originally a successful cricketer. It was not until the Civil War that he took up baseball because \"it looked like cricket for which his soul thirsted.\" It has been suggested that the fast-paced quick play of baseball was more appealing to Americans than the technical slower game of cricket. This natural tendency toward baseball was compounded by terrible American defeats at the hands of a traveling English side in 1859, which may have caused Americans to think that they would never be successful at this English game. By the end of the Civil War, most cricket fans had given up their hopes of broad-based support for the game. Baseball filled the role of the \"people's game\" and cricket became an amateur game for gentlemen.\nRise of amateur cricket.\nFollowing the Civil War, cricket grew into an amateur sport with much less broad appeal than it had had before. This manifestation can be seen in the foundation of the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club. The club was to be based on \"the broadest and most liberal interpretation of the terms 'gentlemen' and amateur.\" They were not that interested in playing baseball, but in founding a more responsive club in the area than the St George's Cricket Club. The members of the Seabright Lawn Tennis Club became so interested in cricket that they convinced club officials to sod their cricket ground with turf imported from England and had the name of the club changed to the Seabright Lawn Tennis and Cricket Club in 1885.\nNowhere was this new trend in cricket more evident than in Philadelphia. In 1865 a group of young people in that city founded the Merion Cricket Club. They were very emphatic about the purity of the sport and thwarted early attempts by some to convert the club into baseball club. In the end, the club members passed a resolution that the remaining baseball equipment \"be sold off as quickly as possible\" to guarantee the purpose of the club. Following the lead of New York and Philadelphia, other cities saw new clubs form. These included St Louis, Boston, Detroit, and Baltimore.\nThese decades also saw an increase in cricket-playing at the intercollegiate level. Following the Civil War, it looked like cricket might expand beyond its strongholds at Haverford College and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1881 delegates from several collegiate cricket clubs, including Harvard University, Columbia University, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania and Trinity College, joined to form The Intercollegiate Cricket Association. The group was plagued by troubles and withdrawals. Haverford College and Cornell University later joined the ICA, but Yale University and Johns Hopkins University never got around to fielding teams. The ICA lasted until 1924 when it crowned its last champion. These collegiate clubs generally drew their talent from pools at secondary schools which also fielded team and played in interscholastic competitions in this period.\nPhiladelphian cricket.\nThe Philadelphian cricket team was a team that represented Philadelphia in first-class cricket between 1878 and 1913. The team was composed of players from the four chief cricket clubs in Philadelphia: Germantown, Merion, Belmont, and Philadelphia. Players from smaller clubs, such as Tioga and Moorestown, and local colleges, such as Haverford, also played for the Philadelphians. Over its 35 years, the team played in 88 first-class cricket matches. Of those, 29 were won, 45 were lost, 13 were drawn and one game was abandoned before completion. The \"Gentlemen of Philadelphia\" were able to win at least a match or two from all of the foreign sides that visited. They beat Australia's test team by an innings on two separate occasions, in 1893 and 1896 Throughout their first-class period of play, the Philadelphians produced such cricketers as Bart King, George Patterson, and John Lester.\nThe success of the team and of the sport itself in Philadelphia was the result of broad support from the citizens of the city. Crowds of several thousand fans \"ranging from millionaires, coaching parties, and box holders to newsboys\" routinely filled the stands at the big four clubs during international matches. These matches were also widely reported in local newspapers. Unlike the other regional pockets of cricket enthusiasm across the country, the sport maintained is popularity for almost two decades into the twentieth century.\nIn 1897, the Gentlemen of Philadelphia were able to launch its first strictly first-class tour of England. This came about after many years of planning. This tour was a very ambitious one for the Americans. They had last toured the British Isles in 1889. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. The 1897 schedule included all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on 17 June. In the first innings, King proved his batting worth on a fourth-wicket stand of 107 runs with John Lester. He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs and the team dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour. In the second innings, King took 6 for 102 and helped the Philadelphians to a victory by 8 wickets.\nThe Philadelphians again took King and his teammates to England in 1903. On this tour, the team rarely found itself outmatched. By the end of the tour, some English observers were comparing the Philadelphian team to some of the Australian sides that they had seen. One of the highlights of the tour was the win over Gloucestershire by an innings and 26 runs. This was the worst defeat ever by an American side over an English county side. The Americans back home believed that this was the country's chance to burst onto the world cricket stage. Unfortunately, this was followed by a relatively poor showing in 1908. The only bright spot of this tour was Bart King's capture of the season bowling record. His record of 11.01 was not bettered until 1958 when Les Jackson of Derbyshire posted an average of 10.99.\nDecline of popularity.\nEven as the Philadelphians were faring poorly in England in 1908, a more disturbing trend was showing itself back home in Philadelphia. The sport's grassroots popularity was waning. Many Philadelphian professionals began to fill their leisure time with other activities such as golf and tennis. Starting around 1905, the number of matches held in the city dropped off. Some of the great clubs of the city even began to close down due to lack of members. Bart King's own Belmont Cricket Club sold its grounds and disbanded in 1914. The sport slowly declined in Philadelphia and the last first-class match in the city was played in 1913. The game was still being played at Haverford College at least as late as 1925 at a high standard, when a team from the college visited England and played a number of English public schools. Haverford College continues to field a cricket team and its last tour to England was in 2019.\nAnother blow to cricket in the United States was the formation of the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909. As the name implied, this was meant to be an organization for cricketing nations in the British Empire. Countries such as Australia and South Africa were able to continue playing internationally, while the United States was left out. Although commentator Robert Waller predicted that cricket \"had taken so deep a root in Philadelphia that it could never be uprooted,\" the lack of support and international apathy caused an irreversible decline.\nSlow resurgence.\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, immigrants to the United States from traditional cricket strongholds such as South Asia and the West Indies helped to stimulate the growth of the game. The first match televised in the United States was one between the Corinthians and Hollywood in 1958. Cricket received a boost in the United States in 1959 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower attended a cricket match at Karachi's National Cricket Ground. In 1961, an expatriate Englishman, John Marder, helped to establish the United States of America Cricket Association. He also helped to re-establish the series between the United States and Canada that began in 1844. Cricket also gained ground in American collegiate settings during this period. Again, most of the play was done by foreign students visiting the United States to study. This slow but steady resurgence in the game has not spread in great numbers to the mainstream American population.\nModern developments.\nThe United States of America Cricket Association was admitted as an associate member of the International Cricket Conference in 1965, a dramatic change as they been integral in keeping the United States out of international cricket when it was formed in 1909.\nThe United States was also able to participate in the ICC Trophy when the tournament started in 1979, where they have been successful and have continued to improve despite not yet qualifying for the World Cup. Unfortunately, the USACA proved unable to administer the sport in the United States effectively, leading to suspensions, and subsequent disqualification from tournaments.\nIn May 2007 the USA were to visit Darwin, Australia, to take part in Division Three of the ICC World Cricket League. A top two finish in this tournament would have qualified them for Division Two of the same tournament later in the year. Unfortunately, after the USACA was suspended from the ICC, the team was disqualified.\nCompton Cricket Club.\nThe Compton Cricket club got its start with Mustafa Khan who played cricket in England with the Los Angeles Krickets world's first homeless cricket team founded by David Sentance and Ted Hayes in September 1995. Mustafa Khan with Leo Magnus as coach introduced cricket at the Willowbrok School in Compton. Thereafter, Ted Hayes and Katie Haber raised funds to take the Compton team to England.\nThe Compton Cricket Club, or CCC, is a cricket club based in Compton, Los Angeles County, California, USA. The CCC is an all American-born disadvantaged exhibition cricket team. The team, which includes Latino and African American ex-gang members, was founded in 1995 by US homeless activist Ted Hayes and Hollywood movie Producer Katy Haber to combat the negative effect of poverty, urban decay and crime in Compton. The club uses the ideals of sportsmanship, and the particular importance of etiquette and fair play in cricket, to help players develop respect for authority, a sense of self-esteem and self-discipline. Having toured England once as a homeless team and 3 times as the Compton Cricket Club, the club toured Australia in 2011 and became the first American born cricket club to tour to Australia.\nPro Cricket.\nPro Cricket was operated by American Pro Cricket LLC (APC), a private company independent of the ICC and the USACA. New Jersey cricket figure Kalpesh Patel was one of the key players and acted as Commissioner while Australian Robert Smith filled the role of Assistant Commissioner and game operations specialist. The league was formed in 2004 as one of several independent efforts by different organizations to develop and promote cricket in the United States. It consisted of eight geographically distributed teams organized in two divisions that mostly used minor league baseball parks as home fields. APC originally announced that the league was fully funded for at least three years of competition, but the league struggled through its initial season due to poor attendance. Although most of the games were shown on Dish network PPV, the competition was linked to the unsuccessful launch of the so named \"American Desi TV\" channel based in New Jersey. The league ceased operations after the 2004 season.\nGame-play format.\nThe format of the games were 20 overs a side, similar to Twenty20 cricket. However, there were two major changes from the rules of cricket used elsewhere:\nAdditionally, the league used a \"designated hitter\" rule, in which teams consist of 12 players, 11 of whom field and 1 of whom bat. This was similar to such rules existing in some domestic List A cricket competitions. All of these changes were designed to shorten the game and produce more aggressive batting, which the league administrators believed would help make the sport more appealing to the U.S. public.\nThe league counted on participation from first-class players from all the major countries, but the Indian board barred its players from participating.\nEach team was allowed a limited roster of \"global players\" from professional cricket teams outside the U.S. The ICC, however, ruled that because Pro Cricket was not organised by the USACA, contracted players from ICC Test nations could not be released from their contracts to play in Pro Cricket matches. However, several notable players without contracts, such as Ajay Jadeja, Daren Ganga, Mervyn Dillon, Colin Miller and Rahul Sanghvi took part in the competition. Also featured was 51-year old Larry Gomes, as well as a few Zimbabwean exiles such as Craig Wishart. The 15–⁠20 international players who did turn out were rotated among the teams to improve gate attractability.\nAlthough cricket had a strong following in the U.S. up to the mid-19th century, its popularity dwindled with the rise of baseball, and it remained an almost unknown sport throughout the 20th century. The U.S. was one of the first nations to become an associate member of the ICC in 1965, but growth of the game there languished until the late 1990s, when the ICC focused development efforts on the country. Progress has since been slow but steady, and many hoped that Pro Cricket would prove to be a turning point in the popularity of the sport in the U.S.\n2004 Season.\nThe league consisted of eight teams in two divisions. The East division, known as \"The Covers\" and the West, known as \"The Mid Wickets\", are listed with their home grounds:\nEast Division\nWest Division\nThe competition involved round-robin home and away games between all pairings within a division, followed by inter-divisional semi-finals and a final. The schedule ran from the opening game on 19 June 2004 to the final on 4 September 2004. In addition, Pro Cricket had a policy of not playing the games that have no importance to them on the points table. The game scheduled for 21 August 2004 between Chicago and Los Angeles was canceled due to the lack of importance of the game. Neither team could have made the playoffs even if they won the game; therefore, Pro Cricket chose to not play the game. In 2004, San Francisco Freedom defeated New Jersey Fire for the league championship title.\nMajor League Cricket.\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) is the highest level of domestic T20 cricket in the USA. A development league, Minor League Cricket (MiLC), started its first season in 2021, with star players from MiLC to eventually play in MLC.\nAmerican-born Test cricketers.\nAlthough the United States is only an associate member of the ICC and has never played a Test match, two Test cricketers have been born in the United States. Ken Weekes was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1912 and played in two of the Tests on the West Indies' tour of England in 1939. Weekes scored 137 at The Oval in the last Test match before the Second World War. Weekes eventually returned to the United States from Jamaica, and died in Brooklyn in 1998.\nLater, the Washington, D.C.-born Jehan Mubarak became an international Test player. He has played 8 Tests and 20 One Day Internationals for Sri Lanka."

        "title": "Field archery",
        "text": "Field archery is any archery discipline that involves shooting at outdoor targets of varying and often unmarked distance, typically in woodland and rough terrain.\nBeing a traditional field sport as well as a widely recognized competitive sport in its own right, field archery can be used to improve the techniques and fitness required for bowhunting in a realistic wilderness setting. Archers sometimes refer to the additional skills required to deal with challenging terrain, lighting and weather conditions as \"fieldcraft\".\nField archery events are usually conducted according to the rules of either the International Field Archery Association (IFAA) or the World Archery Federation (WA). Others may be held under the rules of national organisations such as the UK National Field Archery Society (NFAS) and the US National Field Archery Association (NFAA) and Archery Shooters Association (ASA).\nIFAA/NFAA.\nInternational Field Archery Association (IFAA) and US National Field Archery Association (NFAA) competitions include three rounds: field, hunter, and animal. A round consists of 28 targets in two units of 14.\nField rounds are at 'even' distances up to (although some of the shortest are measured in feet), using targets with a black inner ring, two white middle rings and two black outer rings. Four face sizes are used for the various distances. A score of five points is awarded for shots which hit the centre spot, four for the white inner ring, and three for the outer black ring.\nHunter rounds use 'uneven' distances up to . Scoring is similar to a field round, the target has an all-black face with a white bullseye. Child and youth positions for these two rounds are closer, no more than , respectively.\nAnimal rounds use life-size 2D animal targets with 'uneven' distances reminiscent of the hunter round. The rules and scoring are also significantly different. The archer begins at the first station of the target and shoots his first arrow. If it hits, he does not have to shoot again. If it misses, he advances to station two and shoots a second arrow, then to station three for a third if needed. Scoring areas are vital (20, 16, or 12) and nonvital (18, 14, or 10) with points awarded depending on which arrow scored first. Again, children and youth shoot from reduced range.\n3D rounds use life-size models of game animals such as deer. It is most common to see unmarked distances in 3D archery, as the goal is to accurately recreate a hunting environment for competition, albeit a more loosely organized form of competition than other types of field archery. Though the goal is hunting practice, hunting tips (broadheads) are not used, as they would tear up the foam targets too much. Normal target or field tips, of the same weight as the intended broadhead, are used instead.\nWA Field.\nThe information in this section is taken from Book 4 of the WA Constitution &amp; Rules.\nThe World Archery Federation, commonly known as WA and formerly as FITA (Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc), defines a suite of rounds based on a 24-target course.\nFour target face sizes are specified: ; ; and . Six target faces of each size are used on the course. For each target face size there are upper and lower distance limits for the various divisions of archer. Target faces have four black outer rings and a yellow spot, each with an equal width. The yellow spot is subdivided into two rings. The black rings score 1 point for the outermost to 4 points for the innermost. A hit in the outer yellow scores 5 points. A hit in the inner yellow scores 6 points. Before April 2008, the innermost yellow ring counted as an X (the number of Xs was used for tie-breaks) but only scored 5 points.\nShooting positions are marked by coloured pegs set at a distance from each target. Generally the red peg is set the furthest from the target, the blue peg is set nearer, and the yellow peg (or white peg in the UK) is set the nearest. The course layer may choose to vary this, though. Each peg is associated with one or more divisions of archer:\nThe UK operates some variations on this for junior archers.\nWhen shooting marked distances, the distance to the target is shown on each peg. On unmarked distances, the distance is not shown.\nA WA 24 Marked round is shot on a single day using 24 targets at marked distances only. A WA 24 Unmarked round is shot on a single day using 24 targets at unmarked distances only. A WA 24 Mixed round is shot on a single day using 12 targets at marked distances and 12 targets at unmarked distances. A WA Combined Field round consists of a WA 24 Unmarked round shot on one day and a WA 24 Marked round shot on the same course the following day with the distances having been increased.\nWA rules state that the lanes between the shooting positions and the targets must not be obstructed by branches or tree trunks.\nArchers follow the course in groups of between two and four. The pegs are arranged so that two people can shoot from one peg at the same time. Each archer shoots three arrows at each target, making a round of 72 arrows.\nNational Field Archery Society (UK).\nIn the United Kingdom, the National Field Archery Society (NFAS) sets the rules for many shoots, including Big Game and 3D shoots. Most of these consist of 36 or 40 targets or 2×20 targets. The NFAS is not affiliated to any international organisation. According to the NFAS Rules of Shooting:\nThe most common NFAS rounds have a \"walk-up\" format, where the archer starts at the furthest peg from the target; if the archer fails to score, they proceed to the next closest peg. For an adult of 16 and over these pegs are coloured red, white, and blue. The archer is allowed a maximum of three shots per target.\n14 and 15 year olds shoot their first arrow from the white peg. If additional arrows are required, both of these are shot from the blue peg. Archers aged 12 years of age and under 14 shoot their first arrow from the blue peg. If additional arrows are required, both of these are shot from the yellow peg. Archers 9 years of age and under 12 years of age shoot their first arrow from the yellow peg. If additional arrows are required, these are also shot from the yellow peg. Archers aged under 9 years of age ('Cubs under 9') shoot their first arrow from the orange peg. If additional arrows are required, these are also shot from the orange peg. The points scored for the under 16 pegs follow the same format as the adult 1st, 2nd and 3rd pegs. \nThe inner kill zone is only used on some targets, and only for the first arrow shot from the furthest peg. The wound zone is marked by wound lines on 2D targets, or by any target hit outside the kill zone excluding the antlers, hooves and target base.\nThere are multiple classes including American flatbow, barebow, bowhunter, compound limited, freestyle, hunting tackle, longbow, primitive, traditional bowhunter, unlimited, and crossbow.\nAll archers attending these shoots must carry a valid NFAS card in order to shoot. The NFAS holds annual championships open to all members. Generally, two championships are held per year: the 3D Championships (in May) and the National Championships (in September). Participants for these events must have competed in three open shoots in the bow style that they wish to shoot, or have participated in a previous Championship.\nArchery Shooters Association (US).\nUnlike the other governing bodies listed here, the ASA governs competitions solely in 3D archery. At national \"pro-am\" events, the ASA features numerous classes for adult men, women, seniors (age 50 and over), \"super seniors\" (60 and over), and \"senior masters\" (69 and over). The ASA also has four age-based classes for youth—\"young adult\" (age 15–17), \"youth\" (12–14), \"eagle\" (9–11), and \"junior eagle\" (6–8). Classes are also distinguished by whether the distances to the targets are known by the shooters, or unknown; the \"known\" classes also vary in distance. Shooters in \"open\" classes may use any compound or recurve bow, with associated equipment, unless specifically prohibited by other rules. Classes also exist for Olympic recurves, barebow recurves (in which bows must conform to WA barebow standards), and crossbows. ASA-affiliated clubs also conduct their own competitions with most if not all of the same classes, and ASA state federations have their own championship events. As with IFAA/NFAA events, broadheads are prohibited.\nThe scoring area is a large ring that surrounds a depiction of the animal's vital area. Several higher-value scoring rings are contained within this larger ring. In all cases, an arrow that touches the edge of a scoring ring receives the higher score. The rings are organized and scored as follows:"

        "title": "Rugby union in Germany",
        "text": "Rugby union in Germany is a moderately popular and growing sport with 124 men's clubs and 5 women's clubs competing in 4 men's and 1 women's national leagues.\nGoverning body.\nThe German Rugby Federation ( or DRV), founded in 1900, is the governing body for all formats of rugby union in Germany, overseeing 12 regional unions. The DRV is a founding member of Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur Association Européenne de Rugby (FIRA-AER) (1934), affiliated with the International Rugby Board since 1999, and a member of the German Olympic Sport Federation.\nHistory.\nFrom early clubs to a national union.\n While rugby union probably reached Germany through affluent British students who attended renowned private grammar schools in the German Confederation, studied in Heidelberg, or completed military service in Hannover, there is disagreement about when the game was first played.\nHeidelberg's Neuenheim College (now Heidelberg College) lays claim to its students first playing rugby around 1850. By contrast, in Stuttgart William Cail is regarded as having first introduced rugby, in 1865 at Bad Cannstatt. In Dresden rugby is seen as first emerging there in 1873, while Lüneburg and Hannover make similar claims with regards 1875 and 1876, respectively. Whatever the actual date and place that rugby first kicked off in Germany, the first German-language texts about rugby was published in 1875. Early printed efforts to explain \"The Laws of Football Played at Rugby School\" was followed by journals and textbooks mentioning the sport.\nRugby enthusiasts worked from within existing clubs serving different sports to establish sections catering to their sport. One of the oldest examples was established on 14 September 1878 by 14-year old schoolboy Ferdinand-Wilhelm Fricke and 24 of his peers at the German Sports Association (Deutsche Sport-Verein von 1878, or DSV 78 Hannover) — the first club in Germany dedicated exclusively to sports played on grass. Fricke's name lives on in Hannover where the German Rugby Federation presently has its offices in a street named for him. Similarly, Neuenheim students under guidance of teacher Edward Hill Ullrich founded a rugby department in 1891 within the Heidelberg Rowing Club (Heidelberger Ruderklub von 1872, or HRK 1872).\nAs a result of such actions taken to establish rugby around them, Heidelberg and Hannover remain centres of the sport.\nThe earliest attempt at constituting a national body by merging German clubs occurred when northern clubs initiated the German Rugby Football Federation (Deutschen Rugby-Fußball-Bundes) in 1886. But when that failed, DSV 78 Hannover joined the (1891–1902), while clubs in Cannstatt, Frankfurt am Main, Heidelberg and Munich joined the (1893–95).\nAt a rugby day in Heidelberg on 13 February 1898 for players from that city, Stuttgart, and Frankfurt am Main, Ullrich argued for closer ties with northern clubs and the ultimate establishment of a national body, but found little support. Between August 1898 and September 1899 the issue continued to be discussed. At a rugby day in Hannover on 11 March 1900, 19 clubs committed to joint future action, undertaking to translate English rules into German, to organize the first North-South match in November, and to join the .\nAs no federation had been formed by October 1900 on the occasion of the second Olympic Games in Paris, SC 1880 Frankfurt club was assigned to participate in the rugby section on behalf of Germany, winning the silver medal behind France.\nOn 4 November 1900 the German Rugby Football Association was established as a separate division within the German football (soccer) association, with Fricke of DSV 1878 Hannover as president. Exactly a year later the rugby association ended its connection with the soccer body and continued independently as the German Rugby Federation (Deutscher Rugby-Verband, or DRV).\nThe first half of the 20th century.\nThe first national competition was organised in 1900, when on 4 November a South versus North game was held, won 11–3 by northern Germany. This annual game became a fixture until 1967, when it was replaced by a state championship. In 1999 the German Rugby Federation returned to the old north-south game but its importance has not reached former levels.\nIn 1909 a national club championship was first organised. The champions of the north, FV 1897 Hannover, met southern club FV 1893 Stuttgart and won 6–3 on 14 November 1909.\nFive regional rugby associations were established in the 20th century's first three decades, including northern Germany in 1900 (Hannover); southern Germany in 1909 (Baden, Württemberg, Greater Frankfurt am Main); western Germany in 1922 (Düsseldorf, Cologne, Bonn); and Brandenburg Central in 1924 (Berlin, Leipzig), which in 1930 subdivided into the Brandenburg and Central associations.\nIn 1927 the German national rugby union team was set up and played its first international on 17 April in Stade de Colombes in Paris. Germany lost 5–30 to France but on 15 May won the return match in Frankfurt 17–16. In the third international between the two countries on 18 March 1928, a record 14,000 spectators attended the game, still the highest attendance number for an international rugby match in Germany.\nGerman rugby peaked in the pre-World War II period, when in 1938, Germany beat France 3–0 for the second time. Long the preserve of the German middle classes, the most prominent German rugby fan/player was the controversial Albert Speer.\nLike all other German sport federations, the German Rugby Federation was absorbed in the all-powerful Nazi sports organisation, the \"Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen\", as part of \"Department 2\", which also served association football and cricket. Hermann Meister, chairman of the German Rugby Federation, a firm believer in a united Europe and a friend of France, tried to live up to his ideals but rugby by and large offered no more resistance to the Nazis than any other sport.\nThe sport was decimated by World War II as most of its players were killed. Germany, at its height of performance in 1939 and second only to France in continental Europe, lost virtually its whole national team during the war, a predicament from which it has never recovered.\nThe subsequent post-war social upheaval largely reversed the pre-war successes in German rugby. It came to be seen as a very English game and, as a result, rugby lost the financial support and much of the popularity it had gained in the western and northern cities of Heidelberg, Hanover and Frankfurt.\nThe post-war period.\nFollowing the War friendly matches were played against British military teams. \nOf the centres of German rugby, only Heidelberg, future headquarters of the US forces in West Germany, was spared by the bombing raids and the sport of rugby carried low priority in the first post war years. But by the early 1950s the German Rugby Federation (DRV) had re-established itself and the 6 regional associations that had existed before the war.\nIn 1948 the German championship was restored and the golden area of the TSV Victoria Linden begun, the team winning the title six times in a row from 1951 to 1956, an achievement matched only recently by Heidelberger RK. The first British team to tour Germany after the war was the Oxford Greyhounds in 1950. In the same year, the DRV was restored in West Germany. With the country now divided into East and West following the post-war occupation, East Germany became the first German team to resume playing international rugby when it toured Romania in 1951. It was followed by the West German team a year later, which played its first international against Belgium in 1952. However, neither side was able to achieve the same successes as the pre-war German team.\nRugby showed that it was not immune to the Cold War split when Burt Weiss, an East German player, escaped to West Berlin using a snorkel. The \"DRV\" continued to offer the East German \"DTSB\" to play a rugby friendly, but this was always declined by the East. After a combined team of \"Lok\" and \"Post\" Berlin happened to play West German side Berliner SC in a tournament in Olomouc in 1985, a ban on participation in international tournaments with West German clubs was issued by the \"DTSB\".\nA Rugby-Bundesliga was formed in 1971 to replace the previously existing regional championships. The hoped for increase in interest however did not materialise and rugby remains a minor sport in Germany, almost exclusively played by amateurs.\nIn 1989 a German women's national 15s team was founded, initially resorting under Germany's youth rugby organization.\nWith German reunification in 1990 a number of clubs from former East Germany joined the German league system.\nThe German Rugby Sports Association of the GDR was dissolved in November 1990 and the state associations of Saxony and Brandenburg with their 17 clubs registered with the DRV. This brought about a restructuring of the Rugby-Bundesliga and the introduction of a second division, 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga.\nIn 2000 the German Rugby Federation celebrated its centenary. Centenary celebrations included a banquet in the Heidelberg Castle and the hosting of the European leg of the Rugby World Cup Sevens in Heidelberg, in which the German team came close to upsetting Ireland, who had Gordon D'Arcy in their line-up. The tournament was won by the Welsh team, which featured Andy Marinos and Arwel Thomas.\nThe highlight of the Centenary season was the Centenary Match against the famous Barbarians. The Barbarians included a host of Welsh, English, Scottish, Irish and Australian internationals including Scott Hastings, Peter Stringer, Shaun Longstaff, Jeff Probyn, Frankie Sheahan, Russell Earnshaw, Shaun Connor, John Langford and Derwyn Jones and won 47–19 against a determined German team.\nThe German federation tendered to host the 2010 Women's Rugby World Cup but the event was awarded to England instead. It did however hold the 2008 Hannover Sevens, the European Sevens championship.\nAn important part of rugby union outside the structures of the German federation is the Army Rugby Union of the British Army in Germany which holds its own \"German\" championship. The winner of this competition advances to play the UK Army rugby union champion. The British Army also supported development of the sport in the region by a British Army Germany rugby union team playing the national teams of Germany and its neighbouring countries.\nFinancial crises and current situation.\nThe national German women's 15s team was officially disbanded by the DRV in 2005 for financial reasons. The DRV reversed its decision a year later, but in 2010 again suspended the women's 15s program in favour of concentrating all resources on the women's sevens national team. Unofficial women's sides played against Belgium in 2012 and 2013, and a privately funded women's national team, called G15, was established in 2015. Supported by clubs participating in the women's Rugby-Bundesliga, the initiative was partly to persuade the DRV to again set up a national women's program. The G15 defeated Switzerland 47–13 in their first match. On 16 April 2016 the DRV undertook to rebuild the women's 15s national team for a period of two years, after which its efficiency and affordability would be evaluated.\nThe German Rugby Federation (DRV) found itself close to insolvency in 2011 due to being €200,000 in debt. The situation was brought on in 2010 when the German federal ministry of the interior refused to pay out its annual grant to the DRV, due to ministry concerns that the DRV was not using the funds to support the sport. DRV chairman Claus-Peter Bach fought a legal battle with the ministry which worsened the situation. Bach consequently announced he would not stand for another term in July 2011 and was replaced by Ralph Götz. The DRV secured a private loan to survive and hoped to attract the sponsors that had withdrawn under Bach as well as to reach a settlement with the ministry.\nIn mid-July 2012 at the Deutsche Rugby Tag (DRT), the DRV's annual general meeting approved a league reform proposed by German international Manuel Wilhelm. The number of clubs in the Rugby-Bundesliga was increased from ten to 24, the league was divided into four regional divisions of six clubs each, and play-off berths were expanded from four to eight teams. A major aim of the reform was to minimize the distances that individual teams had to travel and so to reduce travel costs. The DRV announced that it was able to avoid insolvency and regain its annual grants from the German government on condition that it stuck to a strict financial plan that would see the DRV debt free by 2018. Any violation of this plan would see funding withdrawn and the association confronted with insolvency again.\nPopularity.\nIn 2023 there were 20,072 players registered with the German Rugby Federation and 40,470 players in all, according to World Rugby.\nRugby union has a large and dedicated following in several university cities such as heidelberg.\nGerman players occasionally break through into French or English clubs, such as Robert Mohr at La Rochelle or Sascha Fischer at Périgueux.\nNational teams.\nFifteens.\nThe German men's national 15s team played their first international match in 1927 against France, but have yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup. With the partition of Germany following the Second World War, the East and West fielded separate teams until the reunification of Germany in 1990. In 2017–18 the men competed in the Championship Division, the top tier of Rugby Europe's International Championships, a European tournament below the Six Nations. As Germany placed last in the competition, they face a relegation match against Portugal in June 2018. The men's national team was ranked 28th out of 105 teams on World Rugby's May 2018 list.\nThe German women's national 15s team was founded in 1989 and initially resorted under Germany's youth rugby organization. The team succeeded in qualifying for the 1998 Women's Rugby World Cup as well as the 2002 edition. In 2002 the women's side finished 2nd in the 2002 FIRA Women's European Nations Cup and 4th in 2005. The national women's side was ranked 19th out of 52 teams by World Rugby in March 2018.\nSevens.\nBoth Germany's men's and women's national rugby sevens teams participate in the major European sevens competition, the Sevens Grand Prix Series.\nIn 2017 the German men finished 5th out of 12 teams. As the series also functioned as a 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens qualifying tournament, they missed out on a place. Germany did not qualify for the debut of sevens rugby at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Germany reached the 2018 Rugby Europe Men's U18 Sevens Championship's quarter-final matches where they defeated Great Britain 21–10, before losing 21–0 to Ireland in the semi-finals.\nThe German national women's side is currently competing in the 2018 Rugby Europe Women's Sevens Grand Prix Series. When they last qualified for this competition they finished 12th out of 12 teams in 2015.\nFifteens club competitions.\nMen's leagues.\nMen's club rugby is organized in four tiers in Germany, with the 2018–19 league structure comprising 16 clubs in the 1st Rugby-Bundesliga, the first level; 26 teams in the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga, the second-highest level; 60 teams in the Regionalligen, the third-highest level; and 30 teams in the Rugby-Verbandsliga, the fourth tier.\nThe German rugby union season starts in September each year and is divided into a championship tournament followed by cup competitions. The championship determines which 1st Rugby-Bundesliga club is the overall German men's champion, while the cup competitions determine which 1st Rugby-Bundesliga club wins the Rugby Union Cup (German: ), and which 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga team claims the League Cup (German: ).\nIn the championship the 1st Rugby-Bundesliga and 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga clubs play matches in a round-robin, home-and-away format, followed by semi-final and final contests. The 16 sides in the 1st Rugby-Bundesliga compete within their respective North-East and the South-West divisions. All 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga clubs follow the same format, competing against other clubs within their respective North, East, West, and South divisions.\nThe championship also determines which teams are promoted to the 1st Rugby-Bundesliga and relegated to the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga. The two winners of the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga semi-finals are promoted to the 1st Rugby-Bundesliga for the next season, while the two 8th-placed 1st Rugby-Bundesliga teams are automatically relegated to the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga. Losing 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga semi-finalists play promotion-relegation matches against 7th-placed 1st Rugby-Bundesliga teams for the same reason.\nIn the cup competitions 1st Rugby-Bundesliga teams who did not qualify for the championship play-offs compete in a knock-out format for the DRV Cup, while 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga clubs play the same format for the League Cup.\nMeasured by playoff participation, 15-a-side men's clubs from Hannover and Heidelberg dominate the Rugby-Bundesliga. Former Hannover champions include TSV Victoria Linden, DRC Hannover, and DSV 78 Hannover, while Heidelberg champions include Heidelberg RK, RG Heidelberg and SC Neuenheim. Four teams from three clubs from two foreign countries participate inside the German league system. These are RC Luxembourg and RC Walferdange from Luxembourg, and RC Innsbruck from Austria. Heidelberger RK's win against TV Pforzheim in the 2015 Rugby-Bundesliga final made it the second club after TSV Victoria Linden to win six consecutive titles.\nWomen's leagues.\nA championship for women in the form of a tournament series was introduced in 1988. From 1992 a Women's Rugby-Bundesliga was contested, similar to the league for men. Since then the number of participating clubs have varied from four (2001/02) to six (2004/05); peaking in the 2014/15 season at eight teams. A women's 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga for ten-a-side teams was played from 2005 to 2010, with teams usually completing two games on match day. From 2016 there has been only one women's 15s league, featuring five teams. Heidelberger RK women's side has claimed 7 victories in a row since 2010, a streak broken in 2017 by SC Neuenheim. Neuenheim women hold the overall record with 13 championships since 1988, followed by FC St. Pauli with 8.\nRugby positions: German terms.\nIn German, the English terminology for rugby positions is not commonly used. The German equivalent for the English terms are:\nGerman rugby museum.\nThe history of rugby in Germany is documented in the Deutsche Rugby-Sportmuseum at Heidelberg which was opened 2 May 1997 by the then-mayor, Beate Weber. The museum consisted of four exhibition rooms, which includes the DRV's first flag from 1900; the coat of arms of the jerseys from Germany's first international match in 1927; and the ball from the 1938 match that Germany won against France. The museum opens during matches of local clubs SC Neuenheim 02 and TSV Handschusheim, or by special arrangement."

Milan sport club under the ownership of Silvio Berlusconi and won 4 domestic championships. When Berlusconi dropped the sport club to keep the football team only Amatori folded and in 1998 the senior team and the sports title were sold to Calvisano. The club were revived in 2002 and coached by Marcello Cuttitta, a former Italian international rugby union player that played for Amatori in the 1990s, managing to reach the second tier of Italian rugby union championship before being disbanded in 2011.\nHistory.\nAmatori Rugby Milano was founded in 1928 as Ambrosiana, branch of the \"Ambrosiana Football Club\", that today is known as Internazionale Milano F.C.\nThe club won the first ever Italian domestic championship (today, the Top12) in 1929. Amatori Rugby Milano would dominate the coming years, winning back-to-back titles in 1931, 1932 and 1933. \nAmatori Rugby Milano won the championship again in 1936, and then twice more during the decade, in total throughout the 1930s, winning the national championship on eight occasions. The 1940s were also a highly successful time for the club; winning the championship after their 1939 victory once again in 1940, which was then following by successful championships three seasons in a row to 1943. \nAmatori Rugby Milano won a fifth title that decade, winning the 1946 season as well.\nThe following years were very quiet in contrast to the dominance of the 1930s and 1940s. \nThe club however won a number of titles during the 1990s as well: capturing the 1991, 1993 national championships and 1995, 1996 as part of the A.C. Milan sport club under the ownership of Silvio Berlusconi, as well as winning the Coppa Italia for the first time in the club's history in the 1995 season.\nWhen Berlusconi dropped the sport club to keep the football team only Amatori folded and in 1998 the senior team and the sports title were sold to Calvisano.

        "text": "Joel Randal Ward (born December 2, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Minnesota Wild, Nashville Predators, Washington Capitals and San Jose Sharks. He is currently an assistant coach with the Vegas Golden Knights.\nEarly life.\nWard was born in North York, Ontario, to Cecilia, who worked as a nurse, and the late Randal Ward, who worked as an automotive mechanic. Both of his parents emigrated to Canada from Barbados. As a youth, Ward played in the 1994 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from North York. He also has two older brothers who played hockey in their youth.\nWard graduated from Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate Institute in 1998.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nUndrafted, Ward played in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) with the Owen Sound Platers. After completing his four-year junior career and his final year of eligibility with the Platers in 2000–01, Ward linked up with lower tier professional team the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the West Coast Hockey League to end the season. An unsigned free agent to start the 2001–02 season, Ward attended the Detroit Red Wings' training camp on a try-out basis, but was ultimately recruited and played collegiately for the University of Prince Edward Island Panthers of the CIS. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from UPEI in 2006.\nProfessional.\nAwarded Rookie of the Year and the Panthers' three-time MVP while earning a degree in Sociology in his four-year collegiate career, Ward was invited to the Minnesota Wild's training camp in 2006. In his first full professional season, he was assigned to the Wild's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Houston Aeros, signing his first professional contract for the entirety of the 2005–06 season.\nAfter impressing Wild management with his work ethic, Ward earned a two-year contract with Minnesota on September 27, 2006. He debuted in 11 NHL games with the Wild during the 2006–07 season, but spent his time primarily with the Aeros, developing into a responsible, two-way player and improving his points totals in each of his three years.\nAs a free agent, Ward signed a one-year contract with the Nashville Predators on July 15, 2008. He made the opening night roster out of training camp for the 2008–09 season and scored his first NHL goal in his first game as a Predator against the St. Louis Blues on October 10, 2008.\nIn 2008–09, his first full NHL season, he scored 17 goals in 79 games, and his reliability as a defensive forward, and success as a utility scoring forward earned him a two-year contract extension on July 1, 2009.\nWard became an unrestricted free agent after the 2010–11 season and subsequently signed a four-year, $12 million contract with the Washington Capitals on July 1, 2011. On April 25, 2012, Ward scored the game-winning goal in overtime in Game 7 of the first round of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs against the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Boston Bruins, advancing Washington to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. However, Ward's fortune would not continue into Washington's series with the New York Rangers. With the series tied at two games apiece, Ward took a high-sticking double minor penalty on Carl Hagelin with 22 seconds remaining in the third period of Game 5, with Washington leading 2–1. Rangers forward Brad Richards tied the game with under ten seconds remaining, and defenceman Marc Staal scored in overtime with the Rangers still on the powerplay as a result of Ward's penalty; the Rangers took a 3–2 series lead. After the Capitals' ultimate elimination in the series, Ward required surgery for a sports hernia.\nOn November 1, 2013, in his 336th career game, Ward scored his first career hat-trick, coming against the Philadelphia Flyers in a 7–0 Washington victory.\nIn 2014, Ward was selected to represent Canada at the 2014 IIHF World Championship. He started on the team's checking fourth line, but finished as one of the team's top scorers.\nOn July 3, 2015, as an unrestricted free agent, Ward signed a three-year, $9.75 million contract with the San Jose Sharks.\nAs the Sharks prepared to play in the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Ward spoke to ESPN, stating that the NHL's first Black player, retired fellow right winger Willie O'Ree, should have his player number 22 retired by the NHL league-wide, just as Jackie Robinson, the first player of colour in Major League Baseball has been honoured—and whom O'Ree had met in person in his own younger years— by having his own player number 42 retired league-wide.\nAfter his contract expired after three seasons, Ward left the Sharks' organization. On September 14, 2018, Ward agreed to attend the Montreal Canadiens' training camp on a professional tryout. However, the Canadiens released Ward from his tryout on September 25.\nOn April 27, 2020, Ward announced his retirement from professional ice hockey via The Players' Tribune.\nOn June 8, 2020, Ward became an inaugural executive board member of the Hockey Diversity Alliance, whose goal is to address intolerance and racism in hockey.\nWard took his first coaching position on November 23, 2020, as he was hired as an assistant coach for the newly-relocated Henderson Silver Knights of the American Hockey League. On July 12, 2023, Ward was promoted to assistant coach of the Vegas Golden Knights, Henderson's NHL parent club."

B. George stated Canada would not be sending a team to the 1953 World Championships. He told the press: \"Every year we spend C$10,000 to send a Canadian hockey team to Europe to play 40 exhibition games.

        "text": "Pole climbing is ascending a pole which one can grip with their hands. The related activity of mast climbing describes ascending an object similar to a pole, but having a larger diameter which excludes gripping with the hands. In either case, it is normally assumed that climbers who view the activity as a \"gymnastic sport\" use only their bodies and limbs, without artificial aids.\nHistory.\nAs \"sporting pursuits\" both pole and mast climbing may have begun as either martial exercises or physical training related to the invention and development of sailing ships, with the attendant requirements of scaling high masts.\nPole climbing appears in some historical documents describing various \"cultural practices\". For example, Fray Diego Durán describes watching an Aztec climbing feat: \". . . to see an Indian standing on top of the 'flying pole' (for so they call it) anywhere between one hundred eighty and two hundred feet in height! He stands there with a trumpet in his hand, and, just watching him, those who observe become giddy . . . after having performed a thousand turns and tricks, he descends with an expression as serene as if he had done nothing!\" \nJohann Friedrich GutsMuths (1759–1839) wrote the following in the late 18th century, in one of the first textbooks of \"modern\" gymnastics : \"The climbing of the mast is far more challenging [than pole climbing], for the surface is smooth and the hands cannot go around it. Here, it is most necessary to have performed well on elementary exercises [gripping with legs and thighs]. This activity is known, by the way, in several areas of Germany and Europe as an amusement for the general public. A few weeks ago one of my pupils climbed a tree trunk high. With nonchalance, he held on to the tree with one hand, tore off some leaves and flowers with the other, and fearlessly scattered them, looking down on his ascent. On such tree trunks one must not climb too high because of vertigo; if one loses his composure, he can slide down the tree, rather than fall.\"\nFriedrich Ludwig Jahn (1778–1852) describes both pole and mast climbing in his seminal work of 1816 on gymnastic apparatus and exercises."

        "text": "The Open Championship is an annual golf competition established in 1860, and is organised by The R&amp;A. It is played on the weekend of the third Friday in July, and is the last of the four major championships to be played each year. The championship is currently held on a different course each year. Of the 14 that have been used, 10 are currently used in the rota. All the courses on the rota are links courses.\nPrestwick Golf Club hosted the first championship in 1860 and remained the sole venue until 1873, when the Old Course at St Andrews hosted the event. Prestwick hosted a further 12 championships, the last in 1925. Musselburgh Links became the third course to host the championship in 1874. The three courses rotated the hosting of the championship until 1892 when Muirfield hosted the event. The Honourable Company of Edinburgh golfers built their own course at Muirfield and Musselburgh was removed from the rota as a result. Royal St George's Golf Club became the first course outside Scotland to host the championship in 1894.\nRoyal Liverpool Golf Club hosted the event for the first time in 1897. Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club became the next course to host the event in 1909. The course hosted a further championship in 1920, but further attempts to host the Championship in 1938 and 1949 were thwarted by bad weather and the course was dropped from the rota. Royal Troon, Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes and Carnoustie held the Open Championship for the first time in 1923, 1926 and 1931 respectively. The following year Prince's Golf Club hosted the event for the only time. The course was requisitioned by the military during the Second World War and was extensively damaged. Royal Birkdale was chosen as the host course in 1940, however, due to the Second World War the event did not go ahead. It was not until 1954 that Royal Birkdale hosted the Open.\nThe Old Course at St Andrews has hosted the most championships with 30 in total, most recently with the 2022 Open Championship. The championship has been held outside Scotland and England twice, in 1951 and 2019; Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland was the venue for both tournaments. Turnberry became the most recent course to have hosted the Championship for the first time, when it held the 1977 Open Championship. However, Martin Slumbers, the Chief Executive of The R&amp;A said in 2021, \"We had no plans to stage any of our championships at Turnberry and will not do so in the foreseeable future. We will not return until we are convinced that the focus will be on the championship, the players and the course itself and we do not believe that is achievable in the current circumstances.\" \nWith Scotland, England and Northern Ireland hosting The Open, Wales is now the only country yet to join The Open rota within the United Kingdom. Golfweek said in 2019 that \"The R&amp;A should go out of its way to put Royal Porthcawl in its pool of Open Championship courses.\" \nNotes.\nA.  From 1860 to 1891 The Open Championship was contested over 36 holes."

        "text": "This is a list of medalists in the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Nordic combined. Bold numbers in brackets denotes record number of victories in corresponding disciplines.\nIntroduction.\nThis event debuted in 1925. At that time, the athletes competing in Nordic combined competed together with the 18 km athletes and the ski jumpers, so an athlete could conceivably win gold in ski jumping and combined on the same day. This format existed until 1939. From 1950, there were separate races for athletes competing in the combined competition, and there was one individual competition, with three jumps where the best two counted, and a 15 km cross country race. Later, the third jump was abolished. From 1985 onwards, the Gundersen method – named after the former combined athlete Gunder Gundersen, who devised the system – was used, where the points from ski jumping were recalculated into cross country skiing times and the athletes then started with a staggered start, the winning ski jumper starting first. The team event debuted in 1982, the sprint in 1999, and the mass start debuted in 2009 (it was only time when mass start event was held). Also in 2009, the 15 km individual Gundersen was changed to a 10 km individual normal hill event while the 7.5 sprint event was changed to a 10 km individual large hill event with the former involving a single jump from the normal hill while the latter involves a single jump from the large hill. The team sprint event debuted in 2013. In 2021, women Nordic combined skiers debuted at the World Championships with individual competition, consisting of ski jumping normal hill event and a 5 km cross country race. In 2023, there debuted mixed team event which replaced men's team sprint event.\nMen's events.\n10 km individual normal hill.\nFormerly known as the 18 km/ 15 km Individual Gundersen, this event involved two jumps from the ski jumping \"normal\" (or basic) hill. For the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 in Liberec, the event will involve a single jump from the ski jumping normal hill followed by 10 km of cross country skiing. Any one point difference between competitors in the ski jump represents 4 seconds between them at the start of the cross country part of the competition.\nThe 10 km individual normal hill is one of only three events held at every FIS Nordic World Ski Championships.\nMedal table\n4 x 5 km team (3 x 10 km team: 1982–1993).\nPrior to 2009, this involved each team member taking two jumps from the ski jumping hill. For each point difference between teams, there is certain time between them at the start of the cross country part of the competition. This point – time difference changed over years. Since the 2009 championships, it involved each team member taking only one jump from the ski jumping hill with the point – time difference being 1 point equals 1.33 seconds. The ski jumping part of this event took place at normal hill at every championships except 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2023 editions when it took place at large hill (in 2011, there were held two separate team events at normal and large hills).\n1984 Extra World Championships in Rovaniemi, Finland as the team event was not on the program at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.\nMedal table\n10 km individual large hill.\nFormerly the 7.5 km sprint, it was similar to the 15 km Individual Gundersen except competitors have only one jump from the ski jumping large hill (in 1999 – one jump from the ski jumping normal hill) instead of two jumps from the ski jumping normal hill. For the 2009 championships, the event was changed to a single jump from the large hill followed by 10 km of cross country skiing. Any one point difference between competitors in the ski jump represents 4 seconds between them at the start of the cross country part of the competition.\nMedal table\n10 km mass start.\n10 km cross country is run first with mass start. The winner receives 120 points with anyone finishing behind them losing 4 points for every second behind the winner. Two jumps from the normal hill are then done, based on distance with the K-points measurement. The winner is the one who earns the most points. This event was held at the 2009 championships only, being replaced by the 4 x 5 km team normal hill event.\nMedal table\n2 x 7.5 km team sprint large hill.\nDebuted: 2013.

The tournament ran from 27 July–1 August 1998, and was won by Rod Harrington.\nA classic final between Harrington and Ronnie Baxter was characterised with deadly finishing from Baxter, who led the final for most of the way, and Harrington's stubbornness in clinging on and keeping the match neck-and-neck. However, Harrington eventually trailed 14–17 and was only 1 leg from defeat. Baxter had a championship dart at double 20 in the 33rd leg but missed. At 17-17, a moment of significant darting history occurred when Harrington took out 125 via treble 15 and two consecutive double 20s. The standard check out route on 80 with two darts in hand had been, up to this point, almost invariably treble 20 and double ten. From then on, it would become more common to see players attempt the Harrington route. With Baxter (who had looked likely to regain the lead) demoralised, Harrington maintained a clear lead throughout the next leg, and sealed the title on double five.\nPhil Taylor was the reigning champion going into the tournament, but lost 10-13 to Baxter in the quarter finals.

        "text": "James Peters (7 August 1879 – 26 March 1954) was an English rugby union player and, later, a rugby league footballer. He is notable as the first black man to play rugby union for England, and the only black England player until 1988.\nEarly life.\nPeters was born at 38 Queen Street in Salford, Lancashire, England. James Peters' Jamaican father, George, had been mauled to death in a training cage by lions. His mother, Hannah Gough originally from Shropshire, was unable to look after him so allowed him to join another circus troupe as a bareback horse rider. He was abandoned by the circus at age 11, having broken his arm, and found himself in Fegan's orphanage in Southwark, and then Little Wanderers' Home in Greenwich, where he captained many of their sports teams. Greenwich Admirals Rugby League Club now celebrate Peters' life with an annual challenge game.\nPeters trained in printing and carpentry; his trade brought him to Bristol, where he played as a fly-half for Dings Crusaders, Knowle and Bristol Rugby Club, and represented the Somerset County team between 1900 and 1903. His presence at Bristol was opposed by some on racist grounds: a committee member at Bristol resigned in protest at his selection for the team, whilst a local newspaper described him as a \"palid blackamoor\", and complained that he was \"keeping a white man out of the side\". Peters then moved on to Plymouth in 1902, representing Plymouth RUFC, and the Devon county side until 1909. He was the star player in the Devon side which won the County Championship in 1906, resulting in the press calling for his selection for the national team.\nEngland international.\nOn 17 March 1906, Peters won his début cap for England against Scotland. However, The \"Yorkshire Post\" pointed out, \"his selection is by no means popular on racial grounds\". In the match, he set up two tries for England: \"The Sportsman\" commented that the \"dusky Plymouth man did many good things, especially in passing.\" He was to play a further game, against France, in which he scored a try.\nIn October through to December 1906 Peters became embroiled in controversy regarding the touring South African Springboks, as some members objected to him playing against them for Devon due to his colour, and he was not picked for the International game against South Africa, with a number of newspapers citing racial grounds. He went on to be capped for England three more times in 1907 and 1908.\nIn 1910, Peters lost three fingers in a dockyard accident, and although it was initially feared he could not play again he continued to play until 1912 when politics forced Peters out of rugby union.\nRugby league.\nClubs in the south-west of England attempted to form a Western League (later Rugby league) and play competitive fixtures. He was suspended for accepting payment from Devon Rugby Club, which was illegal according to the codes of rugby union. Many players, including Peters, and also RFC Plymouth were suspended by the RFU. Plymouth's ground closed, signalling the end of Plymouth RFC. The rules of professionalism often owed more to politics than finance.\nPeters, by then 34 and disillusioned with rugby union, was accepted into rugby league. Returning to his native northwestern England, Peters played for Barrow in 1913, and then transferred to St. Helens in 1914 until his retirement from rugby."

        "text": "The 2002 Stan James World Matchplay was a professional darts tournament held from 28 July to 3 August 2002 at the Empress Ballroom in the Winter Gardens of Blackpool. It was the ninth staging of the competition since the 1994 edition and the 18th of 35 Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) tournaments in the 2002 season. The tournament was broadcast on Sky Sports and was sponsored by the betting company Stan James.\nThe tournament's defending champion Phil Taylor defeated John Part by 18 legs to 16 in the final, winning his third consecutive World Matchplay title and his fifth overall since his first in the 1995 event. He defeated qualifier Shayne Burgess in round one, Kevin Painter in round two Chris Mason in the quarter-finals and John Lowe in the semi-finals en route to the final. Taylor made a nine-dart finish in the fifth leg of his quarter-final match against Mason, the first time the achievement had been broadcast live in the United Kingdom. Keith Deller achieved the competition's highest checkout, a 170, in his second-round match against Alan Warriner.\nTournament summary.\nBackground.\nTommy Cox, the tournament director and co-founder of the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC), conceived the idea of staging a darts tournament in the North West England seaside resort of Blackpool in the early 1990s. The World Matchplay was first held in 1994 and is the second most prestigious competition in the PDC in terms of prize money behind the World Championship. The 2002 tournament was held between 28 July to 3 August in Blackpool, England, and was the 18th of 35 PDC-sanctioned events that year. It was the ninth edition of the tournament and featured a 32-player main draw that was played at the Empress Ballroom in the Winter Gardens.\nA total of 28 players automatically qualified for the main draw according to their final position from 1 to 28 in the PDC rankings with 16 seeds. The tournament's defending champion Phil Taylor was seeded first and Alan Warriner was the second seed. The remaining four places were decided by a two-stage play-off tournament contested by members of the Professional Dart Players Association at the Cardiff International Arena in Cardiff, Wales, on 20 July. Shayne Burgess, Mark Holden, Mark Walsh and Paul Whitworth were the four players who progressed from qualifying to the main draw. The maximum number of legs played in a match increased from 19 in the first round to 25 in the second and 31 and 33 in the quarter and semi-finals respectively, leading up to the final which was played as best-of-35 legs. Sponsored by the betting company Stan James, it had a total prize fund of £75,500, and the host broadcaster was Sky Sports.\nRound 1.\nThe draw for the first round of the championship was conducted on Sky Sports News by Cox and Sid Waddell on 19 June. The first round of the competition, in which 32 players participated, took place from 28 to 30 July. Steve Brown defeated the ninth seed Dennis Smith 10–7. Brown led 5–3 with a 137 checkout before Smith took the next two legs to tie at 5–5. Brown then reestablished a two-leg lead and won the match on the double 20 outer ring. Kevin Painter, the 16th seed, averaged 53.85 points per dart to win 10–4 over former world champion Dennis Priestley. Taylor achieved a three-dart average of 100.74 and a checkout of 161 in whitewashing qualifier Burgess 10–0; he attempted to complete a nine-dart finish in leg seven before he missed the triple 20 inner ring on his seventh throw. \nA 64 checkout gave Holden the opening leg of his match against the Las Vegas Desert Classic runner-up Ronnie Baxter, who won ten legs in a row to win by 10–1 with finishes of 121 and 70. Fourth seed Denis Ovens was untroubled in a game with Whitworth and made a checkout of 121 in leg five en route to a 10–4 win. 12th seed Jamie Harvey emerged a 10–5 winner over Andy Jenkins as both missed their targets. Harvey said afterwards he required a victory at the tournament due to him being drawn to play Taylor in the previous two years. John Lowe made a three-dart average of 90.93, a checkout ratio of 30.31 and a checkout of 114 to defeat Alex Roy 10–2. A 52 finish and a 89.60 three-dart average allowed Chris Mason to win 10–1 over Richie Burnett, the 2001 World Matchplay runner-up. Mason failed to achieve a nine-dart finish because he missed the triple 19 inner ring at his eighth throw. Second seed Warriner won 11–9 over Les Fitton. Both players took the game to 9–9 and Warriner won by two legs over Fitton on a tie-break. \nNumber 20 seed Keith Deller, who had lost in the first round of the previous three World Matchplays, came from 4–1 and 6–3 behind the two-time tournament winner Rod Harrington for a 10–8 victory with finishes of 116, 32 and 76 after the latter had a series of bounce outs that affected his flow. Another tie-break was required in a match between Bob Anderson and seed eight Peter Manley in which the former won 18–16; both competitors compiled high scores with checkouts of 111 and 116. World number eight Colin Lloyd came from 4–7 behind Mick Manning to claim six legs in succession and win 10–7, saying afterwards, \"I started thinking am I going to hit the double? And saying to myself 'keep going the way you are and the doubles will come'\" Dave Askew won 10–4 over Peter Evison. Both players tied at 2–2 before Askew took a 4–3 lead. Askew won the following six legs and Evison the thirteenth. Askew took victory on the double eight outer ring and had an average finish of 93.29.\nJohn Part, the Ireland Open Class champion, had a three-dart average of 84.92 in whitewashing the error-prone Walsh 10–0. Part said he felt slightly awkward for Walsh not performing and that \"it ended more or less like a practice match.\" Cliff Lazarenko averaged 98.67 in defeating Steve Beaton 10–8. The match saw Lazarenko lead 5–1 before Beaton responded to bring it to 8–9; the former finished on the double 16 outer ring to win. The final first round match was played between the world number six Roland Scholten and Paul Williams. Scholten compiled high scores as the game went to 4–4 and later 8–8 before winning two more legs for a 10–8 victory on the double 20 outer ring.\nRound 2.\nThe second round consisted of best-of-25 legs between 30 and 31 July. Taylor was the first player to progress to the quarter-finals with a 13–6 victory over Painter. He led Painter 3–2 and later 6–4. before checkouts of 68, 127 and 167 gave him the win; he missed compiling a 170 checkout. Mason won 13–6 over Brown; he had an average of 97 in the first six legs, which he won. Brown subsequently returned to contention before Mason won the match. The next second-round match saw Baxter beat Harvey 13–7. Baxter threw accurately enough to claim the opening three legs until Harvey mounted a short comeback. Harvey had a three-dart average of 85 before he was unable to complete a 140 checkout and Baxter returned to a three-leg lead at 7–3. Harvey took a further four legs in the match before Baxter claimed victory. Lowe beat Ovens 14–12. The game was closely contested until the 14th leg, when Ovens hit the double one ring to go 8–6 in front. It went to 10–11 and then 11–11 before Lowe took the win.\nLloyd earned a 13–5 victory against Scholten. Both players shared the first two legs before Lloyd claimed seven sets in a row to lead Scholten 9–2. Scholten then lowered his deficit to 9–3 until Lloyd had finishes in the double five and fifteen outer rings to earn a spot in the quarter-final. Deller emerged from 5–2 behind Warriner to level the score at 6–6 and then 7–7. As Warriner drew clear, Deller made the tournament's highest checkout of 170 in the 18th leg and then finished in the double one, five and sixteen rings to win by 13–11; Deller's form allowed him to hit 13 out of 30 targets. Anderson defeated Askew 13–9 after he overcame a late match challenge from his opponent. He led 8–2 when Askew took 7 of the next 11 legs before Anderson won the match by hitting the double 20 outer ring in the 22nd leg. The last second-round match was contested by Part and Lazarenko. Both players shared the first 18 legs with neither taking a clear advantage. At 9–9, Part clinched the 19th leg and made a checkout of 117 to lead 11–9. He then won two more legs for a 13–11 victory.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe four quarter-finals entailed best-of-31 legs on 1 August. Lloyd defeated Deller 16–6 in the first match. Level at 2–2 after checkouts of 138 and 60, Lloyd won two legs in a row before Deller took leg seven after Lloyd was unable to complete a checkout of 130. Lloyd then won four consecutive legs, and responded each time Deller won a leg to claim a 16–6 victory and a berth in the semi-final. Part beat Anderson 16–5 for the second semi-final spot. He won 11 legs in succession and 15 of the last 16 to set up a semi-final meeting with Lloyd. \nTaylor made the first nine-dart finish (two maximums and completing a 141 checkout by hitting the triple 20 and 19 inner rings and the double 12 outer ring) to be broadcast live in the United Kingdom in the fifth leg of his 16–7 victory over Mason and won £100,000 for doing so. He had a three-dart average of 112.17 with checkouts of 120, 126, 167, 87 and 106 for victory. Of the achievement, Taylor said: \"I was a bit tearful at the end but I had to dig in... Once I'd done the nine-darter it was a bit off-putting to then win the match. When everyone's waving betting slips at you, it takes you a few legs to think that this fella could knock me out of the competition if I'm not careful.\" Lowe took the last semi-final berth with a 16–13 win over Baxter. The players split the first two legs before Baxter won the third. Lowe then won three legs in a row until Baxter tied at 5–5. The score went to 8–7 and then 11–11 until Lowe claimed another three legs to be within two of victory. Baxter claimed two more legs until Lowe took two in succession to win.\nSemi-finals.\nBoth of the semi-finals were contested as best-of-33 legs on 2 August. Part was the first player to reach the final when he defeated Lloyd 17–12. Lloyd won the first two legs with a checkout of 76 and a finish on the double 14 outer ring. Part used Lloyd's inability to convert his throws to claim the next four legs. The game was closely contested with neither player going more than two legs ahead after 18 legs. After a short interval, Part moved into a 15–10 lead and won a 16th leg with a checkout of 122. Lloyd delayed victory by claiming the 27th leg and the 28th saw Part win the match by finishing on the double eight outer ring. Part said after the match that he had not produced his best performance of the competition, \"I didn't have my best game on hand, but it was a great fight. Colin and I gave it our best.\"\nThe other semi-final was between Lowe and Taylor. The players split the opening two legs before Taylor won two in a row from checkouts of 106 and 64. Both players had an equal amount of competitiveness and came back several times during the match with checkouts over 100 until Taylor won 17–15 by completing a checkout on the double 16 outer ring in the 32nd leg. Taylor praised Lowe's play and commented on the final: \"I can relax now and enjoy it. John's got to play well against me. Every time I've played him I've given him a good hiding but tomorrow's a different story. John wants to beat me badly and it's going to be a good final.\" Mel Webb of \"The Times\" wrote that the match had seen Taylor taken further than he had been in a major darts competition since his semi-final tie with Eric Bristow at the 1997 WDC World Darts Championship went to nine sets.\nFinal.\nThe final between Taylor and Part on 3 August was played to the best-of-35 legs. The pair shared the first two legs before Taylor took legs three and four and added the fifth after the two had missed chances to secure it earlier on. Part replied by compiling checkouts of 72 and 81 to remain in close contention, and took the lead by winning leg eleven. From the 12th to 18th legs, both players levelled the scoreline until Taylor ended the deadlock. Part later achieved a checkout of 104 in the twentieth leg as Taylor grew more frustrated by the 25th leg. Taylor made a 161 checkout to which Part replied with checkouts of 160 and 87 to regain an advantage over the former. The match was tied once again until Part returned to the lead with a 61 checkout on the 31st leg. Taylor claimed the 33rd and 34th legs to win the match 18–16 and the tournament.\nIt was Taylor's third consecutive World Matchplay title and his fifth overall since first winning it at the 1995 edition. He won £15,000 for winning the competition and £100,000 for his nine-dart finish, earning him a cumulative total of £115,000. Taylor commented on Part's form during the game: \"He really pushed me. Every time I missed, he would finish his shots. At 16-all, I thought this is a best of three now and I need to do the business. Adrenaline and the will to win pulled me through.\" He called it \"one of the hardest tournaments I’ve ever played in\" because he had underestimated players whom he perceived as sub-par and called them \"vultures\", adding: \"They are getting fed up with losing, and you can tell by the way they are playing against me.\"\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for 2002 is shown below.\nMain draw.\nNumbers given to the left of players' names show the seedings for the top 16 players in the tournament.

        "text": "The 2006 Holsten Premier League the second year of the Professional Darts Corporation's popular darts league. The 2006 league was launched with the top six players in the PDC world rankings and the addition of a wildcard player, Raymond van Barneveld who decided to switch from the British Darts Organisation just weeks after reaching their 2006 World Championship final.\nBarneveld, a four-times BDO World Champion went on to achieve the perfect nine-dart finish on 23 March against Peter Manley, on the fifth night of the 2006 Premier League at the Bournemouth International Centre. It was the same night that he faced Phil Taylor for the first time since his switch, the match ended in a 7–7 draw.\nTaylor and Barneveld dominated the league stages, with both players winning every match in the league phase against the other 5 players in the league. Taylor came out on top 8–6 in their other meeting in Doncaster.\nGiven the form of Taylor and Barneveld in the group matches, there was much anticipation of a clash between the two in the final. However, it failed to materialise as Roland Scholten averaged 104.13 in the semi-final to hammer Barneveld (average 91.79) by 11 legs to 3. Phil Taylor averaged 105.03 in his 11–3 semi-final win over Colin Lloyd (average 99.42).\nPhil Taylor successfully defended his title by seeing off Scholten in the final by 16 legs to 6. Taylor's average in the final was 101.41 to Scholten's 92.01. \nBarneveld and Taylor would ultimately have their next meeting in the finals of the 2007 PDC World Darts Championship, with Barneveld ending Taylor's three-year reign as champion.\nFormat.\nThe format had a slight change from 2005. Previously, all twelve legs of a match had to be completed – regardless of whether a winner had already been determined. From 2006, a match would finish when a player reached the 8 legs victory target, unless the match reached 7–7 when the points would be shared and the match drawn.\nVenues.\nLike the inaugural Premier League Darts event, all 11 venues were used, but this time venues in Scotland (Aberdeen) and Wales (Newport) were also used.\nResults.\n16 February – Week 1.\n King George's Hall, Blackburn\n23 February – Week 2.\n Seaburn Leisure Centre, Sunderland\n2 March – Week 3.\n AECC, Aberdeen\n16 March – Week 4.\n Wolverhampton Civic Hall, Wolverhampton\n23 March – Week 5.\n Bournemouth International Centre, Bournemouth\nNine dart finish.\nThe Premier League's first nine-dart finish occurred, when Raymond van Barneveld hit one during the ninth leg of his match against Peter Manley, checking out with T20, T19 and D12.\n30 March – Week 6.\n Sands Centre, Carlisle\n6 April – Week 7.\n Newport Centre, Newport\n20 April – Week 8.\n The Dome Leisure Centre, Doncaster\n27 April – Week 9.\n Stevenage Arts &amp; Leisure Centre, Stevenage\n4 May – Week 10.\n Rivermead Centre, Reading\nPlay-offs – 29 May.\n Plymouth Pavilions, Plymouth\nTable and streaks.\nTable.\nNB: LWAT = Legs Won Against Throw. Players separated by +/- leg difference if tied.\nPlayer statistics.\nThe following statistics are for the league stage only. Playoffs are not included.\nTop match Averages.\nDarts averages are based on the total number of points scored divided number of darts thrown (multiplied by 3 in this case to give a \"3 dart average\"). There were 16 matches where a player managed an average in excess of 100 per visit to the board. Phil Taylor achieved this during seven matches, Raymond van Barneveld six times. Roland Scholten, Ronnie Baxter and Peter Manley each averaged over 100 during one match in the competition."

It is owned by the City of Bowling Green and Warren County.\nHistory.\nThe site was established in 1934 as a military airfield. Shortly after the end of WWII the airport was served by an intrastate airline, Bluegrass Airlines through fall 1946. On August 1, 1948 Eastern Airlines added Bowling Green to its Chicago to Atlanta route. Aircraft used were the Douglas DC-3, Martin 4-0-4, and the Lockheed L-188 Electra. In 1969 Eastern contracted to Air South and Wright Airlines to serve Bowling Green. The last Wright Airlines flight left Bowling Green around 4:30 pm, September 10, 1972, leaving the airport without airline service.\nCharter flights for Western Kentucky University Men's and Women's athletic programs use the airport regularly.\nAirlines and destinations.\nBowling Green–Warren County Regional Airport had seasonal service on a single airline, Contour Airlines, to Destin–Fort Walton Beach Airport in Destin, Florida. Service to Destin resumed on May 13, 2017, and continued through August 13, 2017. Contour Airlines began serving Bowling Green–Warren County Regional Airport on August 29, 2016, with twice daily flights to Atlanta and twice weekly flights to Destin on a seasonal basis. This marked the first time Bowling Green had scheduled commercial service since 1972. The seasonal flights to Destin ended in late October. On November 1, 2016, service to Atlanta was reduced from two flights a day to one. It was announced on December 9, 2016, that the flights to Atlanta would end on January 8, 2017, due to insufficient demand.\nFacilities.\nThe airport covers and has two runways:\nIn the year ending December 31, 2022, the airport had 9,814 aircraft operations, average 27 per day: 85% general aviation, 14% air taxi, &lt;1% military and &lt;1% airline. 66 aircraft were based at the airport: 51 single engine, 8 multi-engine, 5 jet, and 2 helicopters.\nFuture developments.\nIn December 2015 the city and the airport reviewed a proposal to expand the terminal at a cost of $1.8 million. The expanded facility would be about 9,000 to 10,000 sq. ft. and would be built based on demand."

The club was named after its original boathouse, an old French frigate moored near Bristol Bridge. All the club's rowing boats were named along the same theme, after characters from \"The Tempest\". The club moved to the clubhouse at St Annes in 1900, and although they suffered losses and closed during the two World Wars, it has expanded since.\nClub colours.\nThe blade colours are white set with an Oxford blue Maltese cross; kit: white, trimmed with Oxford blue.\nHistory.\nThe Bristol Ariel Rowing Club was formed in 1870, making it the oldest club of its kind in Bristol. The club originally stored its equipment in an old French frigate near Bristol Bridge, named \"Ariel\", after which rowing club was named. Each of the club's boats have followed the same theme by being named after character's from William Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\", as story with a character called Ariel. The frigate was known as \"the barge\", and housed all the club's boats and paperwork, as well as having space for the rowers to change in. By 1879, the club had approximately 60 active and 100 honorary members and in 1884 the club won the West of England Challenge Cup.\nIn 1900, the club moved to a new clubhouse at St Annes, Bristol, where it remains. It was officially opened by Frederick Wills, using a key which was specially designed for the occasion. The building was designed by J. Hart Taylor. The club lost thirteen members who were killed in action during World War I, leaving the club closed until 1919. The club opened to lady members in 1926, originally only as tennis members. On 6 December 1940, the grounds were hit by a bomb during World War II, destroying the teahouse and damaging the main club house, leaving the club closed again until it could be repaired after the war. In 1955, the University of West of England built eight sheds for their boats and a large boathouse was added for the club in 1971."

        "text": "Since 1990, the biggest events in men's tennis have been the four Grand Slam tournaments, the ATP Finals and the ATP Masters tournaments, in addition to the Grand Slam Cup between 1990–99. From 1983 to 1990, men's tennis had a very strong tradition and clear hierarchy of tournaments: the Grand Slam tournaments, including Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open, and the Australian Open; the season-ending Masters Grand Prix; and the Davis Cup. Before 1983, however, and in particular before the start of the Open Era in 1968, the hierarchy of professional tournaments changed virtually every year. For example, in 1934, the U.S. Pro was a high-class tournament with all the best players, but just two years later, the same tournament was ordinary because only professional teachers (no leading touring pros) entered the event.\nProfessional tennis before the Open Era.\nBefore the start of the Open Era and in addition to numerous small tournaments and head-to-head tours between the leading professionals, there were a few major professional tournaments that stood out during different periods:\nBecause of the instability of the professional tour, the greatest tournaments in a given year could be the three \"championship tournaments\" (such as in 1964) or other tournaments (such as in 1959 when the greatest tournaments probably were the Forest Hills Pro, the Masters Pro in Los Angeles, and almost all the Australian pro tournaments).\nHowever these three tournaments were considered retrospectively by some tennis experts as the three tournaments of the professional Grand Slam (until 1967). Some years as in 1948, only one of them was held, the U.S Pro in this case, and even in 1944 none was organized : this explains why professionals players have less impressive records than those of the modern players but it doesn't mean that the banished players of the pre-Open Era were less great than their Open Era colleagues.\nAs with any statistics, those of tennis players should be put into the correct context because:\na) they are mixing performances of the amateur circuit (until 1967), the professional circuit (until 1967), and the open circuit (since 1968).\nb) they don't always take into account the greatest events of a given year (such as the 1959 example above).\nFor instance, Ken Rosewall's amateur successes between 1953 and 1956 were achieved without having to compete against world-class professionals like Frank Sedgman and Pancho Gonzales. Likewise, when Rod Laver captured the amateur Grand Slam in 1962, he did not have to face opponents such as Rosewall, Lew Hoad, Pancho Segura and Andrés Gimeno, all professionals, and therefore his 1962 Grand Slam is not seen as impressive as his 1969 Grand Slam which he won in the Open Era. In 1967 Laver was omnipotent on fast courts, winning all the greatest pro tournaments that year, Wimbledon Pro (grass), the U.S. Pro (grass), Wembley Pro (indoor wood, fastest surface ever used in tennis) and the French Pro (indoor wood). In the official statistics as published by the ITF or ATP these tournaments are seldom listed because only the amateur tournaments were taken into account. Yet Laver's supremacy in 1967 was undisputed: in his statistics (19 major tournaments) three of the four previous tournaments are listed. The one tournament not chosen is 1967 Wimbledon Pro because it was a one-off event and not a \"Grand Slam pro\" tournament but it was probably the greatest pro event of the 60s and in particular of 1967. It indicates that the Grand Slam label in the pre-Open Era is not always attributed to the greatest tournaments of a given year.\nIn reality to fairly compare pre-Open Era players' records with Open Era players, it would be necessary to select from the tennis beginnings the four greatest events of each year, knowing it would change every year (some years it is difficult to choose the four greatest tennis events). Thus, for instance, Ken Rosewall's record of 23 victories, indicated above, would be reduced to about 21 tournaments \"equivalent to the modern Grand Slam tournaments\": Wembley Pro 1957, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963 – New York City-Madison Square Garden Pro 1966 – French Pro 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966 – French Open 1968 – U.S. Pro 1963, 1965 – US Open 1970 – Australian Open 1971 – WCT Finals 1971, 1972. In that list, on one hand have disappeared all Rosewall's great amateur successes (Australia 1953, 1955 – Roland Garros 1953 – U.S. 1956) and also the 1972 Australian Open without eighteen of the twenty best players, but on the other hand have appeared some pro tournaments which weren't one of the three classic ones (see Ken Rosewall's article).\nMost major singles titles.\nThe three professional tournaments (Wembley Pro, French Pro, U.S. Pro) until 1967 are sometimes referred as the 'professional Grand Slam tournaments' by tennis historians, such as Robert Geist or Raymond Lee (in his \"Greatest Player of All time: A Statistical Analysis\" article). This list comprises winners of three types of titles; Amateur Era and Open Era majors (Australian, French, Wimbledon, and US championships), plus the three Amateur Era professional majors (French Pro, Wembley Pro, and US Pro).\n \"Only players with 10+ Major titles listed.\"\nMajors statistics.\nThe draws of Pro majors were significantly smaller than the traditional Grand Slam tournaments; usually they only had 16 or even fewer professional players. Though they were the top players in the world, this meant only four rounds of play instead of the modern six or seven rounds of play.\nPro World Championship winners.\nIn the years before the Open Era, male professionals often played more frequently in tours than in tournaments because a head-to-head tour between two tennis stars was much more remunerative than a circuit of pro tournaments and the number of professional tournaments was small. For example, Fred Perry earned U.S. $91,000 in a 1937 North American tour against Ellsworth Vines but won only U.S. $450 for his 1938 victory at the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships. Vines probably never entered a tournament between the London Indoor Professional Championship in October 1935, which he won, and the May 1939 edition of that tournament, which he lost. In 1937, Vines played 70 matches on two tours and no matches in tournaments. Even in the 1950s, some professionals continued to play numerous tour matches. During his first five months as a professional (January through May 1957), Ken Rosewall played 76 matches on a tour against Pancho Gonzales but only 9 matches in tournaments. As an example of the small number of professional tournaments held before the Open Era, Joe McCauley has determined that for 1952, only 7 professional tournaments were played by the top international players, and 2 other professional tournaments (the British Pro and the German Pro) were reserved for domestic players. However, there were professional tournament series with a point system attached which produced a pro ranking in some years, notably 1946, 1959, 1960, 1964–68.\nThe prevalence of head-to-head tours and the small number of professional tournaments in many years makes it necessary to consider the tours when comparing male players from before the Open Era with male players during the Open Era. The following lists the pre-Open Era professionals who won the most tours based on the information currently available.\nYear-end Championships winners.\n \"Only players with 3+ YEC titles listed.\"\nMasters Series winners.\n \"Only players with 10+ Masters titles listed.\""

A total of 130 riders from thirteen teams entered the 22-stage race, that was won by Frenchman Bernard Hinault of the Renault–Gitane–Campagnolo team. The second and third places were taken by Italians Wladimiro Panizza and Giovanni Battaglin, respectively.\nAmongst the other classifications that the race awarded, Gis Gelati's Giuseppe Saronni won the points classification, Claudio Bortolotto of Mobilifico San Giacomo–Benotto won the mountains classification, and Bianchi–Piaggio's Tommy Prim completed the Giro as the best rider aged 24 or under in the general classification, finishing fourth overall. Bianchi–Piaggio finishing as the winners of the team classification, ranking each of the twenty teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time.\nTeams.\nA total of thirteen teams were invited to participate in the 1980 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 130 cyclists. From the riders that began this edition, 89 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1980 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani on 31 January 1980. Covering a total of , it included three individual time trials, and ten stages with categorized climbs that awarded mountains classification points. Four of these ten stages had summit finishes: stage 8, to Fiuggi; stage 11, to Campotenese; stage 14, to Roccaraso; and stage 18, to Zoldo Alto. In the case the Stelvio was not passable by bike, the nineteenth and twentieth stages had a back-up plan where that took an alternate route through the Pordoi Pass in stage nineteen and would be the new Cima Coppi. The organizers chose to include two rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was longer and contained two less time trials. In addition, this race contained three more stages.\nClassification leadership.\nThree different jerseys were worn during the 1980 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Stelvio Pass. The first rider to cross the Stelvio was French rider Jean-René Bernaudeau. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but considering only riders aged 24 and younger.\nAlthough no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

In 1995, his senior season, he caught 53 passes for 860 yards and 14 touchdowns, helping lead his team to the Texas Class 4A State Football regional finals. Cole was also a member of the school's track and field team, and qualified for the Texas State Track and Field Championships in long jump and triple jump.\nCole was recruited by R. C.

His 89 career receptions still rank at No. 10 on the school's all-time list. His most productive season came as a junior in 1998, when he led the Aggies in catches (38), receiving yards (667) and touchdowns (five). He totaled 89 passes caught for 1,383 yards and 8 touchdowns.\nNFL career.\nCole was selected by the Denver Broncos in the third round of the 2000 NFL Draft, as the 70th pick overall.

The club is the oldest in Surrey.\nHistory.\nUntil 1870, the golf course was actually a race course. Laid out on land that was once part of the Onslow Estate, the club was founded by Colonel W. Bannatyne, Major W. Pontifex and Mr E.L. Hooper. The 4th Earl of Onslow gave his support to the project, and so became the President of the club. Originally, the course was just six holes in length, but by the early 1900s it had expanded to eighteen and the clubhouse was built.\nClubhouse.\nThe clubhouse was built in 1901 and was officially reopened by Peter Alliss in 1998, following a refurbishment. The clubhouse looks out over the Downs, with attractive views of the 18th hole. The club website states that the clubhouse has been \"widely acclaimed as one of the best in the South East of England\".\nThe course.\nThe course is an 18-hole parkland golf course set on the North Downs. It measures 6090 yards off the men's competition tees and has a par of 69. Being situated on chalk, it is seen as a good all-weather course. Often, there is a fairly strong wind across the Downs, significantly increasing the difficulty of the course."

The tournament was not held during the World War II years 1942–1945.\nIn 1971 the tournament was part of the Grand Prix tennis circuit while from 1973 until 1977 it formed part of the World Championship Tennis circuit. One of the landmark tournament events was in 1974, the championship match was broadcast before a national audience; thirty-four-year-old Rod Laver, met heir apparent, seventeen-year-old Björn Borg. Laver, who in 1961 became the first foreign player to win the singles title, won in straight sets and became the first man to hold four singles championships at River Oaks.\nIn 2008, the River Oaks International was merged with one of the oldest, and last remaining clay court tournaments in the United States, the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships."

        "text": "The 1933 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the first edition of the All-Star Game known as the \"Midsummer Classic\". This was the first official playing of the midseason exhibition baseball game between Major League Baseball's (MLB's) National League (NL) and American League (AL) All-Star teams. The game was held on July 6, 1933, at Comiskey Park in Chicago, Illinois, the home of the AL's Chicago White Sox. The game resulted in the AL defeating the NL, 4–2, in two hours and five minutes.\nThe first official All-Star Game came 22 years after the Addie Joss Benefit Game of July 24, 1911, when the American League's Cleveland Naps faced a team of all-stars from other American League teams at League Park in Cleveland, Ohio; the game was won by the all-star squad, 5–3.\nHistory.\nThe first official MLB All-Star exhibition game on July 6, 1933, was held at Comiskey Park (1910–1990) and was part of the 1933 Chicago World's Fair during the city's centennial. The 1933 MLB All-Star Game was the idea of Arch Ward, the sports editor of the \"Chicago Tribune\", after the Mayor of Chicago, Edward J. Kelly, had first approached the \"Tribune's\" publisher for a major sport event. The game was intended to be a one-time event to boost morale during the Great Depression. Ward decided that the fans would select the starting nine players and the managers the other nine players for each of the NL and AL All-Star teams. The \"Tribune\" called it the \"Game of the Century\", and 55 newspapers across the country printed the fans' ballots in their papers. The \"Tribune\" estimated the game's attendance on July 6, 1933, at 49,000. The proceeds ($45,000, net gate receipts) from the game went to a charity for disabled and needy major league players. The All-Star Game would afterwards be known as MLB's \"Midsummer Classic\".\nThe legendary baseball player Babe Ruth of the Yankees highlighted the game by hitting a two-run home run to right field in the bottom of the third inning and catching a fly ball up against the scoreboard in right-center field in the top of the eighth inning. Ruth was greeted at home plate by the AL/Chicago White Sox batboy John McBride and teammate Lou Gehrig. Twenty of the game's thirty-six All-Stars including Ruth would later be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, New York. Both the game's managers, five out of six coaches, and two out of the four umpires on the field that day would also be future Hall of Famers. Two AL All-Stars were White Sox players, starting third baseman Jimmy Dykes and starting center fielder Al Simmons. Yankee Lefty Gomez was the winning pitcher for the American League.\nThe NL team wore specially made gray uniforms and navy blue caps with \"National League\" in navy blue felt letters on the front of the jersey, a large navy blue felt number on the back and \"NL\" in white letters printed on the navy caps. The AL team members each wore their home uniform. The NL members were allowed to keep their All-Star uniforms and caps. In 1934, each NL member used their home uniform and cap.\nThe game's official AL baseball was changed to an official NL baseball and the AL home plate umpire was replaced by a NL home plate umpire after the top of the 5th inning. 60 baseballs autographed by All-Star players were given out before the game started.\n1933 All-Star Game rosters.\nPersonnel in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n1933 All-Star Game.\nUmpires.\nThe umpires rotated positions clockwise in the middle of the fifth inning, with Klem moving behind the plate.\nGame summary.\nChick Hafey of the National League had the first hit, a bloop single to center field to lead off the second inning. The American League got on the board first in the bottom of the second. NL pitcher Bill Hallahan issued one-out walks to Jimmy Dykes and Joe Cronin. Two batters later, the game's winning pitcher Lefty Gomez, singled home Dykes for the AL's first run.\nIn the bottom of the third, after a walk to Charlie Gehringer, Babe Ruth famously hit the first home run in All-Star Game history, putting the AL up 3–0. Hallahan was chased from the game after walking Lou Gehrig immediately afterward, and was replaced by Lon Warneke. General Crowder replaced Gomez to start the fourth inning. In the sixth, Warneke hit a one-out triple and scored on a Pepper Martin groundout. Frankie Frisch followed with a home run to bring the NL to within a run, but after a Chuck Klein single, Crowder would escape the inning without giving up any more damage.\nCronin led off the bottom of the sixth with a single. After advancing on a bunt, he scored on an Earl Averill single to extend the lead to 4–2. Crowder would be replaced by Lefty Grove in the top of the seventh, while Warneke was replaced by Carl Hubbell in the bottom of the inning. The NL looked to have a chance in the top of the eighth. With Frisch on first with two outs, Hafey lined a shot to right field that looked like it could be a home run, but Ruth reached over the wall to catch it, denying the NL a chance to tie the game. Grove retired the side in order in the ninth to secure the American League's victory."

        "text": "Ullna Golf &amp; Country Club is a golf club situated 20 km north of Stockholm on the shore of Lake Ullna in the municipality of Österåker, Sweden. The premier championship venue in the region at the time, it hosted the Scandinavian Enterprise Open on the European Tour 1983–1987. \nHistory.\nOpened in 1981, the course was conceived and designed by Sven Tumba with the aim of hosting international competitions of the highest level. Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland officially inaugurated the course on 27 August 1981. \nUllna has been consistently ranked as one of the finest courses in Sweden, and had until the mid-1990s, an unrivaled position as the best course in the Stockholm area. In the Swedish \"Golf Digest\" 2005 ranking of Swedish courses, it was ranked 11th. In 2020, following the Jack Nicklaus redesign, it ranked 4th. Ullna is famous for its beautiful setting. It is unique in its proximity to open water, with 6 of the 18 holes stretched along the waterfront. In 2005, course manager Magnus Adén was awarded Swedish Greenkeeper of the Year. Part of the jury’s motivation was “Ullna, that has always been highly ranked, has under the leadership of Adén, reinforced its position as one of the best and finest managed courses”.\nDue to the development of a number of high class golf courses in the Stockholm area in recent decades, Ullna Golf Club is no longer unmatched as the best course in the region. \nThe club hosted the PGA European Tour event Scandinavian Enterprise Open (SEO) 1983–1987, featuring the biggest European stars of the day. Winners include Sam Torrance (1983) and Ian Woosnam (1984). In 1988 the Eisenhower Trophy was held at Ullna. Between 1998 and 2001 the club hosted the team match competition SAS Invitational Match Play featuring stars like Colin Montgomerie, Mark O'Meara, Sergio García, Bernard Langer and Tiger Woods. \nIn recent years, though, the course has not been able to keep up with the rapid development in golf equipment which is making the pros hit the ball further. This has rendered the course too short for the modern pros and due to the limited land area on which it is situated, it is very difficult to lengthen. It is, however, still a superb course for women's competitions, and in 2004, Ullna hosted the Ladies European Tour event HP Open, with Annika Sörenstam as winner.\nIn November 2022 it was confirmed that the club was selected to host the 2023 Scandinavian Mixed, a European Tour and Ladies European Tour co-sanctioned event featuring a field of 78 women and 78 men playing for one prize fund and one trophy."

Before attending the University of Michigan for two years, Brown was a member of the US National Development Team Program, competing in the North American Hockey League (NAHL). He was drafted in the 5th round, 159th overall, by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft.\nProfessional.\nBrown became one of two Mike Browns to have been part of the Canucks organization and was often mistaken for the latter, a forward who left the Canucks in 2002. Following his sophomore season, he was signed to a professional contract with the Canucks and chose to forgo his last two years of college hockey. In his pro rookie season in 2005–06 with the Manitoba Moose, the Canucks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, he recorded 15 points in 73 games. He was suspended for two games after an illegal high hit in a game versus the Houston Aeros. In 2007–08, he received his first NHL call-up, playing 19 games for the Canucks. Brown scored his first NHL goal on December 2, 2007, against the Minnesota Wild in just his third game with the Canucks, deflecting a point shot from defenceman Lukáš Krajíček in a 2–1 loss. He was sent back down to the Moose on January 17, 2008.\nThe following season, Brown played in 20 games for the Canucks, registering one point. On February 4, 2009, Brown was traded by the Canucks to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for Nathan McIver. He finished the season with the Ducks having played in 8 games scoring one goal and two points. On May 1, 2009, Brown was ejected from Game 1 of the Western Conference Semi-finals after a questionable hit on then-Detroit Red Wings forward Jiří Hudler, who was left dazed and bloodied on the ice. Brown was not suspended for the hit, but the Red Wings ultimately won the series in seven games. He finished with two points in the Ducks series loss. Following the season he was re-signed to a two-year contract extension.\nIn the 2009–10 season, Brown played in a career-high 75 games, posting six goals and recording 106 penalty minutes. On June 26, 2010, at the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, he was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for the Leafs' fifth round pick, 122nd overall. The Leafs general manager Brian Burke acquired Brown to protect his teammates on the ice and to bring toughness to the team. On February 2, 2011, Brown signed a three-year contract extension with the Leafs. \nDuring the shortened 2012–13 season, on March 4, 2013, Brown was traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for a conditional fourth round pick in the 2014 Draft. He was traded by the Leafs in order to make room for the return of Matt Frattin from injury. He scored his first goal as an Oiler on March 10, 2013, against the Chicago Blackhawks. Brown's first period goal broke a two-game goalless drought for the Oilers. Brown played in a total of 35 games with the Oilers over two season, scoring just once. He was traded to the San Jose Sharks on October 21, 2013, in exchange for a fourth round pick in 2014 Draft.\nIn the offseason, Brown was re-signed by the Sharks to a two-year contract. During the 2015–16 season, Brown was placed on waivers after 44 games with the Sharks and was claimed by the Montreal Canadiens on February 29, 2016. He was brought in by the Canadiens to protect the younger star players on the roster. He completed the season remaining on the Canadiens roster, scoring his first goal (a game winner) on March 23 versus the Anaheim Ducks.\nAs a free agent over the summer, Brown went un-signed before agreeing on a try-out basis to attend the training camp of the Columbus Blue Jackets on September 13, 2016. He was released from his try-out at the conclusion of training camp by the Blue Jackets and remained a free agent into the 2016–17 season. On December 20, 2016, Brown belatedly signed a professional try-out (\"PTO\") contract with the Blue Jackets affiliate, the Cleveland Monsters of the AHL. After 11 scoreless games, he was released from his PTO with Cleveland on February 12, 2017.\nPersonal life.\nBrown is Jewish.

        "text": "The 2022 Winter Olympics, officially called the XXIV Olympic Winter Games () and commonly known as Beijing 2022 (2022), were an international winter multi-sport event held from 4 to 20 February 2022 in Beijing, China, and surrounding areas with competition in selected events beginning 2 February 2022. It was the 24th edition of the Winter Olympic Games.\nBeijing was selected as host city on 31 July 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, marking its second time hosting the Olympics, and the last of three consecutive Olympics hosted in East Asia following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang County, South Korea, and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Having previously hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing became the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The venues for the Games were concentrated around Beijing, its suburb Yanqing District, and Zhangjiakou, with some events (including the ceremonies and curling) repurposing venues originally built for Beijing 2008 (such as Beijing National Stadium and the Beijing National Aquatics Centre).\nThe Games featured a record 109 events across 15 disciplines, with big air freestyle skiing and women's monobob making their Olympic debuts as medal events, as well as several new mixed competitions. A total of 2,871 athletes representing 91 teams competed in the Games, with Haiti and Saudi Arabia making their Winter Olympic debut.\nBeijing's hosting of the Games was subject to various concerns and controversies including those related to human rights violations in China, such as the persecution of Uyghurs in China, which led to calls for a boycott of the games. Like the Summer Olympics held six months earlier in Tokyo, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of health and safety protocols, and, for the second Games in a row, the Games being closed to the public (with selected events open to invited guests at a reduced capacity).\nNorway finished at the top of the medal table for the second successive Winter Olympics, winning a total of 37 medals, of which 16 were gold, setting a new record for the largest number of gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics. The host nation China finished fourth with nine gold medals and also eleventh place by total medals won, marking its most successful performance in Winter Olympics history.\nBidding process.\nThe bidding calendar was announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in October 2012, with the application deadline set for 14 November 2013. The IOC Executive Board reviewed the bids from all applicant cities on 7 July 2014 and selected three cities, Oslo (Norway), Almaty (Kazakhstan), and Beijing (China), as the final candidates.\nSeveral bid cities withdrew their bids during the process, citing the high costs or the lack of local support and funding for hosting the Games. The Oslo bid, considered the clear frontrunner, was canceled in the wake of a series of revelations about the IOC's demands for luxury treatment of IOC members that strongly turned public opinion and the parliamentary majority against the bid. The city withdrew its application for government funding after a majority of the Norwegian parliament had stated their intention to decline the application. In the days before the decision, Norwegian media had revealed the IOC's \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. The IOC also \"demanded control over all advertising space throughout Oslo\" to be used exclusively by IOC's sponsors, something that is not possible in Norway because the government doesn't own or control \"all advertising space throughout Oslo\" and has no authority to give a foreign private organization exclusive use of a city and the private property within it. Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy; \"Slate\" described the IOC as a \"notoriously ridiculous organization run by grifters and hereditary aristocrats.\" Ole Berget, deputy minister in the Finance Ministry, said \"the IOC's arrogance was an argument held high by a lot of people.\" The country's largest newspaper commented that \"Norway is a rich country, but we don't want to spend money on wrong things, like satisfying the crazy demands from IOC apparatchiks. These insane demands that they should be treated like the king of Saudi Arabia just won't fly with the Norwegian public.\"\nBeijing was selected as the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics after beating Almaty by four votes on 31 July 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nDevelopment and preparations.\nVenues.\nIn February 2021, Beijing announced that the 26 venues (including training venues) for these sports would be running on entirely renewable energy.\nThere were three different clusters of venues designed and constructed for the 2022 Winter Olympics, each respectively known as the Beijing Zone, the Zhangjiakou Zone, and the Yanging Zone.\nBeijing Zone.\nVenues in the Beijing Zone exist in different conditions; some were recently constructed exclusively for the 2022 games, while the rest were renovated from the 2008 Summer Olympics or other existing sites. The Beijing Zone of the 2022 Winter Olympics consisted of six competition venues and was where the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, for both the 2022 Winter Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics, would take place.\nFive ice events were held at the Olympic Green, the Capital Indoor Stadium and the Beijing Wukesong Sports Center, which had been some of the main venues of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Big Air snowboarding and freestyle skiing events were held in a former industrial area in Shijingshan District, at Western Hills area. Since the end of 2009, the Beijing Olympic Village apartments on the Olympic Green had been transformed into a residential area. There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics. These new buildings are located in the southern area of Olympic Green on the neighbourhood of the National Olympic Sports Center and will serves as Chinese Olympic Committee residential complex for those athletes who will undergo training sessions at the nearby venues.\nThe Beijing National Stadium was an iconic venue in the Beijing Zone, and it is also known as the Bird's Nest (鸟巢; \"Niǎocháo\"). The Beijing National Stadium was the site that hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the 2022 Winter Olympics, but it was no longer a venue for any competition in 2022.\nThe National Aquatics Center (国家游泳中心 Guójiā Yóuyǒng Zhōngxīn /gwor-jyaa yoh-yong jong-sshin/), also known as the Water Cube, was the venue for Curling competition. In the 2022 Winter Olympics, the National Aquatics Center became the first Olympic venue to incorporate a curling track in the swimming pool.\nThe Shougang Big Air (首钢滑雪大跳台中心 Shǒugāng Huáxuě Dàtiàotái Zhōngxīn /shoh-gung hwaa-sshwair daa-tyao-teye jong-sshin/) was a newly constructed site for the 2022 Winter Olympics. The Shougang Big Air hosted the freestyle skiing and snowboarding events.\nThe Wukesong Sports Centre (五棵松体育馆 Wǔkēsōng Tǐyùguǎn /woo-ker-song tee-yoo-gwan/) was under an 8-month renovation for the 2022 Winter Olympics. In February 2022, the Wukesong Sports Centre hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics Men's and Women's ice hockey tournaments.\nThe National Indoor Stadium (国家体育馆 Guójiā Tǐyùguǎn /gwor-jyaa tee-yoo-gwan/) was the second venue for the ice hockey tournament for the 2022 Winter Olympics, besides the Wukesong Sports Centre.\nThe National Speed Skating Oval (国家速滑馆 Guójiā Sùhuáguǎn /gwor-jyaa soo-hwaa-gwan/) has the nickname \"Ice Ribbon\" due to its exterior design. The National Speed Skating Oval was the venue for speed skating in the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nThe Capital Indoor Stadium (首都体育馆 Shǒudū Tǐyùguǎn), also known as the Capital Gymnasium, was a venue adapted from the 2008 Summer Olympics and was reconstructed for short-track speed skating and figure skating competitions in the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nYanqing District is a suburban district localized at the Beijing's far north. Competitions for luge, skeleton, bobsleigh and alpine skiing were held in Xiaohaituo Mountain area in the West Dazhuangke village of Zhangshanying in Yanqing District, northwest of the urban area of Beijing, away from the city center of Beijing and away from the town of Yanqing, using artificial snow because of the rarity of natural snow in this region.\nZhangjiakou Zone.\nAll other skiing events were held in Taizicheng Area in Chongli District, Zhangjiakou city, Hebei province. It is from downtown Beijing and away from Xiaohaituo Mountain Area. The ski resort earned over ¥ 1.54 billion (US$237.77 million) in tourism during the 2015–16 winter season for a 31.6% growth over the previous season. In 2016, it was announced that Chongli received 2.185 million tourists, an increase of 30% from the previous season, during the first snow season after winning the Olympic bid. The snow season lasted for five months from November, during which Chongli has hosted thirty-six competitions and activities, such as Far East Cup and Children Skiing International Festival. A total of twenty-three skiing camps have also been set up, attracting the participation of 3,800 youths. All the venues construction started in November 2016 and was finished by the end of 2020 to enable the city to hold test events.\nMedals.\nThe design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 26 October 2021. The concept is based on the 2008 Summer Olympics medals and Chinese astronomy and astrology as the games were held coinciding with the Chinese New Year festivities.\nThe uniforms for medal presenters at medal ceremonies were unveiled in January 2022. The uniforms have been designed in a joint project by the Central Academy of Fine Arts and Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology.\nTorch relay.\nThe torch relay started on 18 October 2021 in Greece. On 20 October 2021, it was announced that the local leg would start on 2 February and end on 4 February 2022 during the Opening Ceremonies. The local leg only visited two cities: Beijing and Zhangjiakou. Activists staged a protest at the Olympic torch lighting ceremony in Greece.\nThe inclusion and television appearance of Qi Fabao, a People's Liberation Army commander well known in China for his involvement in the 2020–2021 China–India skirmishes, as one of 1,200 torchbearers have been controversial, with India launching a diplomatic boycott of the Games as a result.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in the qualifying process for curling and women's ice hockey due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020. Qualification for curling was based on placement in the 2021 World Curling Championships and an Olympic Qualification Event that completed the field (in place of points earned across the 2020 and 2021 World Curling Championships). The IIHF based its qualification for the women's tournament upon existing IIHF World Rankings, without holding the 2020 Women's World Championship.\nOn 29 September 2021, the IOC announced biosecurity protocols for the Games; all athletes were required to remain within the bio-secure bubble (referred to as a \"closed-loop management system\") for the duration of their participation, which included daily COVID-19 testing, and only being allowed to travel to and from Games-related venues. Unless they are fully-vaccinated or have a valid medical exemption, all athletes were required to quarantine for 21 days upon their arrival. Mirroring a protocol adopted for the 2020 Summer Olympics before they were moved behind closed doors, the IOC also announced that only residents of the People's Republic of China would be permitted to attend the Games as spectators.\nOn 23 December 2021, the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) announced that they had agreed to withdraw their players' participation in the Games' men's hockey tournament, citing concerns over COVID-19 and the need to make up games that had been postponed due to COVID-19 outbreak As part of their latest collective agreement with the NHLPA, the NHL had agreed to accommodate a break for the Olympics and player participation for the first time since 2014.\nOn 17 January 2022, amid increasing lockdowns across China and the first detected case of the Omicron variant in Beijing, it was announced that ticket sales to the general public were cancelled, and that limited numbers of spectators would be admitted by invitation only. These, therefore, became the second Olympics in a row that were closed to the general public. In the lead-up to the Games, organizers stated that they had aimed for at least 30% capacity at each venue, divided equally between spectators from within the \"closed loop\" (including dignitaries, delegations, and the press), and invited guests from outside of it (including local residents, school students, winter sports enthusiasts, and marketing partners). At least 150,000 spectators from outside the \"closed loop\" were expected to attend. Spectators were only present at events held in Beijing and Zhangjiakou; all events in Yanqing were held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted.\nEveryone present at the Games, including athletes, staff, and attendees, were required to use the My2022 mobile app as part of the biosecurity protocols, which was used for submissions of customs declarations and health records for travel to the Games, daily health self-reporting, and records of COVID-19 vaccination and testing. The app also provided news and information relating to the Games, and messaging functions. Concerns were raised about the security of the My2022 app and how information collected by it would be used, so several delegations advised their athletes to bring burner phones and laptops for the duration of the games.\nBecause of the strict COVID-19 protocol, some top athletes, considered to be medal contenders, were not able to travel to China after having tested positive, even if asymptomatic. The cases included Austrian ski jumper Marita Kramer, the leader of the World Cup ranking, and Russian skeletonist Nikita Tregubov, silver medalist of the 2018 Winter Olympics.\nTransportation.\nThe new Beijing–Zhangjiakou intercity railway opened in late 2019, starting from Beijing North railway station and ending at Zhangjiakou railway station. It was built for speeds of up to ; with this new road system, the travel time from Beijing to Zhangjiakou was decreased to around 50 minutes. A dedicated train for the Winter Olympics began to run on this line in January 2022, featuring a mobile television studio that supports live broadcast on the train.\nOn December 31, 2021, the Beijing Subway reached the planned at the bid book.\nPlanned before the city was awarded the rights to the Games, the Beijing Daxing International Airport opened in 2019, and due to the strategic location, it would be the main focus for the arrival and entry of delegations on Chinese soil. Chinese officials had hoped that this airport would replace Beijing Capital International Airport as the country's main hub for arrivals and departures between its opening and the Winter Games and reduce the international and domestic demands of the older airport. This airport replaced the old Beijing Nanyuan Airport which was out of date and was on the list of the most dangerous airports in the world because of its location and since its opening, it has been sharing the local and international demands of the city and the country with the older Beijing Capital International Airport. However, according to the COVID-19 pandemic security protocol manual issued by BOCWOG and International Olympic Committee, all foreign delegations could only enter and leave Beijing via the Capital International Airport due to its smaller size and the fact that it is closer to the city center and Olympic Green and has specific isolation areas and a better health protocols.\nBudget.\nThe original estimated budget for the Games was US$3.9 billion, less than one-tenth of the $43 billion spent on the 2008 Summer Olympics. Although there were reports that the games might cost more than US$38.5 billion, the final official budget was US$2.24 billion and turning a profit of $52 million, of which the International Olympic Committee (IOC) donated $10.4 million of that surplus to the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) to help with the development of sport in China.\nCeremonies.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 4 February 2022 at Beijing National Stadium.\nAmid the political controversies and tensions impacting the Games, IOC president Thomas Bach instructed athletes to \"show how the world would look like, if we all respect the same rules and each other\", and pledged that \"there [would] be no discrimination for any reason whatsoever.\"\nThe final seven torchbearers reflected multiple decades of Chinese athletes, beginning with the 1950s, and concluding with two skiers competing in the Games—21 year-old skier Zhao Jiawen from Shanxi (the first Chinese athlete to compete in Nordic combined), and 20-year-old Dinigeer Yilamujiang from the Xinjiang autonomous region (cross-country, and the first Chinese cross-country skier to win a medal in an ISF event).\nFor the first time in Olympic history, the final torchbearers did not light a cauldron: instead, they fitted the torch into the centre of a large stylised snowflake, constructed from placards bearing the names of the delegations competing in the Games. Three similar snowflakes were also erected as public flames, with one outside of the stadium lit by a volunteer, one in Yanqing District lit by speed skater Yu Jongjun, and the third in Zhangjiakou lit by skier Wang Wezhuo.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics was held at Beijing National Stadium on 20 February 2022; it included a cultural presentation, closing remarks, and the formal handover to Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo as hosts of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\nSports.\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics include a record 109 events over 15 disciplines in seven sports. There are seven new medal events, including men's and women's big air freestyle, women's monobob, mixed team competitions in freestyle skiing aerials, ski jumping, and snowboard cross, and the mixed relay in short track speed skating.\n\"Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each discipline.\"\nNew events.\nIn October 2016, the International Ski Federation (FIS) announced plans to begin permitting women's competitions in Nordic combined, to contest the discipline at the Olympic level for the first time in Beijing. In November 2017, a further three events were put forward by the FIS for possible Olympic inclusion: a ski jumping mixed team competition and men's and women's big air in freestyle skiing. At their May 2018 Congress at the Costa Navarino resort in Messenia, Greece, the FIS submitted several additional events for consideration, including a proposal to make telemark skiing an Olympic discipline for the first time in Beijing, with proposed competitions to include the men's and women's parallel sprint and a mixed team parallel sprint. The Congress also approved to submit the aerials mixed team event, and several new snowboarding events: the men and women's snowboard cross team event; a mixed team alpine parallel event; the men's and women's parallel special slalom; and a mixed team parallel special slalom event. The individual parallel special slalom events were featured at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, but were dropped from the Olympic program in 2018 to make way for the snowboarding big air competitions.\nThe International Luge Federation (FIL) proposed the addition of six new events, including natural track luge (men's and women's singles), a women's doubles competition on the artificial track, and sprint events (men, women, and doubles) on the artificial track.\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) continued to campaign for the addition of synchronized skating as a new event within the discipline of figure skating. The ISU also proposed a new mixed team event in short track speed skating.\nIn biathlon, a single mixed relay was proposed by the International Biathlon Union (IBU) to complement the four-person mixed relay that featured at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Also, the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) proposed a new team event, but there was no plan to introduce a four-woman bobsleigh event despite the recommendation from the federation's executive board to propose such an event in the interests of gender equality.\nIn July 2018, the IOC announced changes to the program for the 2022 Winter Olympics as part of a goal to increase the participation of women, and appeal to younger audiences. Seven new medal events were added (expanding the total program to 109 events), including men's and women's big air freestyle, women's monobob, mixed team competitions in freestyle skiing aerials, ski jumping, and snowboard cross, and the mixed relay in short track speed skating. Women's Nordic combined was not added; Nordic combined remains the only Winter Olympic sport only contested by men.\nParticipating National Olympic Committees.\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with lab data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they were not permitted to compete in team sports. WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) again, as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision.\nAfter reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty WADA had placed on Russia. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate in the Olympics and other international events, but for two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team.\" The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation.\nOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. Russia would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.\nOn 8 September 2021, the IOC Executive Board suspended the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) through at least the end of 2022 for violations of the Olympic Charter, over its refusal to send athletes to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo due to COVID-19 pandemic-related concerns. North Korean athletes would be allowed to participate under the Olympic flag. However, North Korean Ministry of Sports and the National Olympic Committee said in a letter to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, the Chinese Olympic Committee, and the General Administration of Sport of China on 7 January 2022 that \"Due to the \"action of hostile forces\" and the COVID-19 pandemic, they would not be able to participate in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\" In addition, the North Korean Olympic Committee said \"supports all the work of our comrades in China to host a grand and wonderful Olympics. The United States and its followers are plotting anti-Chinese conspiracies to obstruct the successful hosting of the Olympics, but this is an insult to the spirit of the Olympic Charter and an act to damage China's international image. We firmly oppose and reject these actions.\"\nThe following 91 National Olympic Committees have qualified athletes (two fewer than four years earlier), with Haiti and Saudi Arabia making their Winter Olympic débuts. Kenya qualified one athlete, but withdrew.\n \nNumber of athletes by National Olympic Committee.\n2,871 athletes from 91 NOCs:\nMedal table.\nNorway finished at the top of the medal table for the second successive Winter Olympics, winning a total of 37 medals, of which 16 were gold, setting a new record for the largest number of gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics. Germany finished second with 12 golds and 27 medals overall. United States finished third with 9 golds and 25 medals overall, and the host nation China finished fourth with nine gold medals, marking their most successful performance in Winter Olympics history. The team representing the ROC ended up with the second largest number of medals won at the Games, with 32, but finished ninth on the medal table, as only five gold medals were won by the delegation. Traditional Winter powerhouse Canada; despite having won 26 medals, only four of them were gold, resulting in a finish outside the top ten in the medal table for the first time since 1988 (34 years).\nChanges in medal standings.\nOn 29 January 2024, CAS disqualified Kamila Valieva for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021 for an anti-doping rule violation. On 30 January 2024, the ISU reallocated medals in the figure skating team event to upgrade the United States to gold and Japan to silver while downgrading ROC to bronze.\nMarketing.\nEmblem.\nThe emblem for the 2022 Winter Olympics, \"Winter Dream\" (冬梦), was unveiled on 15 December 2017 at the Beijing National Aquatics Center. Designed by Lin Cunzhen (who previously designed the emblem of the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing), the emblem is a stylized rendition of the Chinese character for winter (冬) as a multi-coloured ribbon, reflecting upon the landscapes of the host region. The beginning of the ribbon symbolizes an ice skater, while the end of the ribbon symbolizes a skier. The emblem carries a blue, red, and yellow colour scheme: the latter two colours represent both the flag of China, and \"passion, youth, and vitality\".\nMascot.\nBing Dwen Dwen was the mascot of the 2022 Winter Olympics. Bing Dwen Dwen was chosen from thousands of Chinese designs in 35 countries worldwide. \"Bing\" (冰) means ice in Chinese, and was meant to suggest purity and strength. \"Dwen Dwen\" (墩墩) was meant to suggest robustness, liveliness, and youth. Bing Dwen Dwen's astronaut-like clothes implied that the Winter Olympics embraced new technologies and created possibilities.\nSlogan.\nThe Games' official slogan, \"Together for a Shared Future\" (), was announced on 17 September 2021; organisers stated that the slogan was intended to reflect \"the power of the Games to overcome global challenges as a community\".\nThe slogan was compared in media with Chinese leader Xi Jinping's policy slogan: 'Building the Common Future of Humanity'.\nBroadcasting.\nIn China, domestic rights to these Games were owned by China Media Group (CMG), with rights being sublicensed by China Mobile's Migu streaming service. In some countries, broadcast rights to the 2022 Winter Olympics were already agreed upon through existing long-term deals. In France and the United Kingdom, these were the first Games where Eurosport would be the main rightsholder; the BBC sub-licensed a limited amount of coverage on free-to-air television, as part of a deal in which the BBC sold the pay-TV rights to the 2018 and 2020 Games to Eurosport. In January 2022, the BBC announced it would broadcast over 300 hours of free-to-air live coverage, as well as highlights programmes.\nThe scheduling of the Games impacted the U.S. broadcast rights to the Super Bowl—the championship game of the National Football League (NFL), and historically the most-watched television broadcast in the United States annually—as the game's date fell within an ongoing Olympic Games for the first time in its history. Under the NFL's broadcast rights at the time, the rights to the Super Bowl alternated annually between CBS, Fox, and long-time Olympic broadcaster NBC (whose last Super Bowl also fell in a Winter Olympic year, but was held prior to the opening ceremony). To prevent the Games from competing for viewership and advertising sales with Super Bowl LVI—which was scheduled for 13 February 2022 at Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium—CBS and NBC announced in March 2019 that they would invert the rights for Super Bowl LVI and LV (2021), so that both the 2022 Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LVI would be broadcast by NBC. In a break from the established practice of airing premieres or special episodes of entertainment programmes after the Super Bowl to take advantage of its large audience, NBC aired its prime time coverage for Day 10 of the Games immediately following Super Bowl LVI. Furthermore, the NFL's new media rights beginning in 2023 extends the Super Bowl rotation to four networks by adding ABC, thus codifying this scenario by giving NBC rights to the Super Bowl in 2026, 2030, and 2034.\nThese Games also confirmed an ongoing trend in U.S. viewership of the Olympics; while television viewership had seen a further decline, they were offset by increases in social media engagement and streaming viewership of the Games. Similar trends were seen in Europe, where Eurosport reported an eight-fold increase in streaming viewership on its platforms and Discovery+ over Pyeongchang 2018.\nConcerns and controversies.\nDuring the bidding process, critics questioned the Beijing bid, arguing that the proposed outdoor venue sites do not have reliable snowfall in winter for snow sports. Concerns have been raised that snow may need to be transported to the venues at great cost and with uncertain environmental consequences.\nAdditional concerns about weather conditions were raised during certain events. Swedish athlete Frida Karlsson nearly collapsed after the women's skiathlon due to low temperatures. Afterwards, the Swedes considered putting in a request for races to be moved to earlier in the day, stating that the afternoons and early evenings scheduled for European TV audiences were hurting the performance of the athletes.\nAs in 2008, activists, human rights groups, and diplomats made calls to boycott the Olympic Games when hosted by China. In the aftermath of the 2019 leak of the Xinjiang papers, the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, and the persecution of Uyghurs in China, calls were made for a boycott of the 2022 Games. Because of these issues, the selection of an athlete from Xinjiang as part of the final torchbearers received a mixed reaction.\nIn February 2021, the Chinese Communist Party-owned tabloid \"Global Times\" warned that China could \"seriously sanction any country that follows a boycott.\" In March 2021, Chinese spokesperson Guo Weimin stated that any attempt to boycott the Olympics would be doomed to fail. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi also told the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell that they should attend the games to \"enhance exchanges on winter sport\", and to \"foster new highlights\" in bilateral cooperation.\nThe IOC stated that it remains neutral in all global political issues and that the award of hosting the games does not signal agreement with the host country's political or social situation or its human rights standards. The committee's response to Agence France-Presse read: \"We've repeatedly said it: the IOC isn't responsible for the government. It only gives the rights and opportunity for the staging of the Olympic Games. That doesn't mean we agree with all the politics, all the social or human rights issues in the country. And it doesn't mean we approve of all the human rights violations of a person or people.\" The statement attracted criticism, with Pacific University professor Jules Boykoff accusing the IOC of \"hypocrisy\".\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, \"The New York Times\" published a report alleging that China requested Russia to delay the invasion until after the Olympics to avoid damaging the Games' public image. Russia invaded Ukraine just 4 days after the Games' Closing Ceremony. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, has rejected the claims as \"speculations without any basis, and intended to blame-shift and smear China\".\nAmerican diplomatic boycott.\nThe United States boycott of China's Winter Olympics was predominantly due to China's human rights issues on topics such as the systematic oppression of the Uyghurs, Tibetans and the riots in Hong Kong in 2019. The Chinese government implemented many coercive activities in those regions, such as the reeducation camps, mass detention camps, and restricted access to social media.\nKey event timeline.\nIn October 2018, American senator Marco Rubio, Senator Jeff Merkley, and Congressmen Jim McGovern and Chris Smith sent a letter, on behalf of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requesting the revocation of China's host right on the 2022 Winter Olympics. The letter stated that \"no Olympics should be held in a country whose government is committing genocide and crimes against humanity.\"\nIn November 2021, President Biden proposed \"a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\" The United States was aware of the prospective harsh punishment of being suspended by the National Olympic Committee and was careful regarding the scale and severity of the boycott.\nIn December 2021, the Biden administration officially initiated a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, restricting United States government officials' presence at the games. The attendance of Team USA athletes was not affected by the diplomatic boycott.\nReactions.\nThe IOC remained relatively neutral regarding the letter from CECC or the boycott. The IOC negotiated with the Chinese government on specific protocols to ensure the Olympic Games ran smoothly, such as providing unrestricted internet access to foreign journalists.\nFrom China's perspective, the United States was \"politicizing sports\" with the Biden Boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, accused the United States of violating the spirit of political neutrality endorsed in the Olympic Charter, emphasizing that an Olympic game should not be a place for political posturing and manipulation. China announced that the United States was not yet officially invited by the host committee; thus, the United States should not have initiated the boycott in the first place.\nFollowing the United States, many countries in the Western world decided to join the diplomatic boycott to show disapproval of China's human rights issues.\nEnvironmental impact.\nAn estimated of water was expected to be used to create snow at the various venues. Pyeongchang, South Korea, which held the previous Winter Olympics, also had a cold but similarly arid climate that required vast quantities of artificial snow. Professor Carmen de Jong, a geographer at the University of Strasbourg, argued that these would be the \"most unsustainable\" Winter Olympics in history. The IOC stated that \"a series of water-conserving and recycling designs have been put into place to optimize water usage for snowmaking, human consumption, and other purposes.\nArtificial snow forms a harder piste compared to real snow. It is often favoured by professionals for being fast and \"hyper-grippy\" but also raises their fear of falling on it. American snowboarder Jamie Anderson compared it to \"pretty bulletproof ice\" while her teammate Courtney Rummel compared it to the man-made snow in Wisconsin.\nAccording to Jules Boykoff in February 2022, Beijing's electricity came largely from coal and this coal power was what supported the construction of some Olympic venues. To offset emissions from construction and air travel, China had planted roughly 60 million trees.\nSporting controversies.\nThere were concerns about decisions and disqualification in several events during the games. These issues included the following: \nAthlete and officials complaints.\nThe food and overall conditions in quarantine hotels given to athletes testing positive for COVID-19 were criticised early on. Team officials from delegations including Belgium, Germany, Poland, Finland and the Russian Olympic Committee all brought up issues their athletes faced in quarantine hotels, among them were the lack of internet connections, low-quality food, insufficient facilities and no training equipment.\nWith China's Zero-COVID policy, there were issues raised about the process of quarantine at the games. On 2 February, Belgian skeleton athlete Kim Meylemans posted on social media and was in tears about the conditions she faced while in quarantine. According to \"Newsweek\" and \"Time\", the hotels' conditions appeared to have improved after the athletes' complaints were made public.\nThere were some complaints about the food served outside of quarantine. Germany's alpine coach Christian Schweiger called the catering \"extremely questionable\" for not having hot meals but he echoed athletes from several nations that the food at the nearby Athletes' Village was great. The US and South Korean teams elected to bring their own food. Austrian skier Matthias Mayer said that Kitzbuehel would have offered \"the best of the best\" but also that a hot meal right before a race might not bring out top performances.\nOther complaints included low temperatures and related safety concerns. Sweden's Frida Karlsson nearly collapsed at the conclusion of the women's skiathlon cross-country race. Afterwards, her team considered requesting that races held in afternoons and evenings for European TV audiences be moved to earlier during the day. Some athletes resorted to putting tape on their faces and noses to protect them from the bitter cold. Heavy snowfall disrupted a number of competition and training events on 13 February. Thirty-three skiers did not finish their first run of the men's giant slalom. Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway said that he \"couldn't see shit.\" Switzerland's Loic Meillard said, \"It's not what I was hoping for but it's part of the game ... we've raced in conditions like that before.\""

        "title": "History of cricket in Bangladesh",
        "text": "The history of cricket in Bangladesh predates the foundation of the Bangladeshi state in 1971 by nearly two centuries. Cricket was introduced to Bengal by the British in the eighteenth century but its growth in East Bengal was slow. Following Partition and the creation of East Pakistan, both first-class and Test cricket were played there during the 1950s and 1960s. Although cricket continued to be popular after independence, especially in Dhaka, the country lost first-class status and had to establish itself in international competition as an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nAfter winning the 1997 ICC Trophy and making a good showing at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, Bangladesh created its National Cricket League (NCL) in 1999–2000 to prepare the way for full membership of the ICC. This was granted in 2000 and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) was formally established. In November 2000, the Bangladesh national team played its inaugural Test match against India at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka.\nBengal.\nCricket was first introduced into Bengal by the British East India Company in the eighteenth century and the first cricket matches recorded were in Calcutta in 1792, but matches were possibly played more than a decade earlier and the sport quickly achieved popularity in western Bengal and neighbouring Bihar. In eastern Bengal, the area which is now Bangladesh, cricket developed very slowly as the area failed to attract large numbers of European settlers until the second half of the nineteenth century. The problems were the region's predominantly rural character and its lack of infrastructure given that it had numerous rivers and travel was extremely difficult. The confluence of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra is in central Bangladesh and the coastal area consists of the Sundarbans mangrove forest and the Ganges Delta. The British saw it as a remote region with few economic incentives. Improvement was gradual and it was not until the 1860s and 1870s that the British built the new roads that facilitated communication. Work was done to improve water supplies, with a consequent boost to public health, and Europeans began to settle in Dhaka with cricket soon becoming one of their favourite recreational activities, as had happened elsewhere in India. In 1876, a European XI met and defeated a Native XVIII in Dhaka.\nA team representative of Bengal played against G. F. Vernon's XI, the first English team to visit the Indian sub-continent, in 1889–90. In January 1923, Bengal took part in the Nagpur Provincial Tournament with Bombay and a Central Provinces XI. In 1934, the Board of Control for Cricket in India organised the Ranji Trophy but Bengal did not take part in 1934–35. Bengal achieved first-class status in December 1935 when they played the Australian tourists and were defeated by 9 wickets. In January 1936, Bengal joined the Ranji Trophy, playing in the East Zone, and reached the semi-final where they lost to Madras. In 1937, Bengal were runners-up and, in 1939, winners of the Ranji Trophy. Throughout this period, Bengal was essentially a West Bengal team. They were based in Calcutta and played all their matches at Eden Gardens. The earliest match of note in Dhaka was in February 1941 when a Bengal Governor's XI played the Bengal Gymkhana at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, then called the Dacca Stadium.\nWith the Partition of British India in 1947, Bengal itself was partitioned with West Bengal remaining an Indian province and East Bengal becoming the eastern wing of Pakistan. In 1955, the western wing became West Pakistan and East Bengal became the new province of East Pakistan. The two wings were separated by some 1,600 km (1,000 miles) of Indian territory and, despite their common religion of Islam, the ethnic and linguistic gulf between the two, compounded by an apathetic government based in the west, eventually resulted in the independence of Bangladesh. While Pakistani cricket was strong in the west, there was no first-class cricket in East Bengal until the 1954–55 season.\nEast Pakistan.\nBetween the 1954–55 and 1970–71 seasons, thirteen East Pakistan first-class cricket teams played in Pakistan's domestic cricket competitions, the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy and the Ayub Trophy. Many played in only a single season or two. The most prolific were East Pakistan (nine seasons), Dhaka University, East Pakistan Greens and East Pakistan Whites (three each). Chittagong is a good example of the sporadic way in which teams from East Pakistan were involved in the national competitions as they were scheduled to play three matches between 1959–60 and 1965–66 and all were abandoned without play starting. The main East Pakistan team played first-class matches against the touring Indians in 1954–55 and Marylebone Cricket Club in 1955–56.\nEast Pakistan staged Test cricket from January 1955 when a match between Pakistan and India was allocated to the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka. The stadium was used for numerous important matches including Tests through the 1960s. The M. A. Aziz Stadium in Chittagong also dates back to 1954 as a first-class venue but it was not used for Tests until Bangladesh played there in 2001.\nRelations between East and West Pakistan had been tense since Partition. East Pakistan was plunged into turmoil on 12 November 1970 when Cylone Bhola struck Bengal with enormous loss of life and devastating impact on the community and economy. The Pakistani government, based in West Pakistan, was roundly condemned for procrastination in its response to the crisis. A few weeks later, when the country's first general election was held on 7 December, widespread outrage in the East resulted in victory for the Awami League which was a Bengali nationalist party under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This led to an opening of talks between representatives of the East and West wings of Pakistan about the future of the country's constitution under a national government headed by the Awami League, and proposals for the division of power between the central government and the provinces. The talks were unsuccessful in breaking a deadlock and, on 1 March 1971, Pakistani President Yahya Khan indefinitely postponed the pending National Assembly session, precipitating massive civil disobedience in East Pakistan. Three weeks later, Bangladesh formally declared its independence and the country was plunged into its liberation war which raged through 1971 until intervention by India, in support of the Bangladeshis, on 3 December 1971. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was short-lived and resulted in Pakistan's capitulation on 16 December 1971, celebrated as Victory Day in Bangladesh, which was then established as a new nation.\nThe last first-class match to be completed in East Pakistan was between a Pakistan Cricket Board XI and the touring International XI in Dhaka from 26 February to 1 March 1971. It was drawn and its final day coincided with Yahya Khan's suspension of the National Assembly, the action which finally triggered the liberation war. The International XI left Dhaka next day for Lahore and played one further match there to end their tour. Two Quaid-i-Azam Trophy matches scheduled to be played in Dhaka during March were both cancelled because of the national emergency.\n1972 to 1977.\nAfter independence, the new state endured poverty, famine, political turmoil and military coups until the restoration of democracy in 1991 which has been followed by relative calm and economic progress. Cricket had to find its way forward amid the turmoil but it was helped by successive governments, civil and military, which treated its development with some importance. In 1972, the government created the Bangladesh Cricket Board, then called the Bangladesh Cricket Control Board, with a directive to organise cricket in the new country. In the aftermath of the war, this was no easy task. \"Barclays World of Cricket\" records that, in early 1975, the national stadium in Dhaka was \"in such disrepair (some buildings being shell-torn) that the cricket square had sunk several inches after years of disuse\".\nThe problems of post-war recovery apart, cricket was popular in Dhaka and the first organised competition of note was the club-level Dhaka Metropolis Knockout Tournament staged in February and March 1973. A national club championship began in 1974–75 and has been held in most seasons to 2015. This gained sponsorship by the Wills tobacco company from 1983 to 1984, then by Pepsi from 1993 to 1994, but it has never been a first-class competition. It has similar status to league cricket in England or grade cricket in Australia.\nThe worst of the problems had been addressed by the start of the 1976–77 season. In January 1977, the inaugural Bangladesh national cricket team was selected for a match against the touring MCC at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. MCC also played against North Zone, East Zone and South Zone which was the first time that any of these teams, now in the Bangladesh Cricket League, were selected. Although the MCC team included some notable county cricket players such as Mick Norman, John Barclay, Dan Piachaud and Nigel Popplewell, their matches on the 1976–77 tour were not first-class. Even so, Bangladesh made a favourable impression on MCC and it was in 1977 that the country became an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n1978 to 1986.\nThe first full international team to visit Bangladesh was Sri Lanka in January 1978. Sri Lanka was then close to ICC Full Member status (achieved in 1982) and their higher standard was underlined by a series of innings victories in the three international matches against Bangladesh. The three-day match in Dhaka starting on 13 January 1978, which Sri Lanka won by an innings and 9 runs, was Bangladesh's debut in international cricket but the very low standard of Bangladeshi cricket at the time means that it was not a first-class match.\nSri Lanka also played against a BCB President's XI, South Zone and Central Zone, the first time that this team was selected. In early February, the first Indian team to visit Bangladesh was the Hyderabad Blues who played a single game in Dhaka against the national team. MCC returned in December 1978 and played six matches at various locations, five of them against the national team. None of the 1978 matches were first-class.\nBangladesh made their competitive international debut when taking part in the 1979 ICC Trophy, held in England between 22 May and 21 June, but failed to reach the semi-final stage. Captained by Raqibul Hasan, Bangladesh were in Group B (there were three qualifying groups of five teams each) against Canada, Denmark, Fiji and Malaysia. Bangladesh struggled in their opening match against Fiji but were rescued by Ashraful Haque who took 7–23 to secure a 22-run victory. In the second match, Bangladesh were well beaten by Canada. They won convincingly against Malaysia and so needed to defeat Denmark in the last match to qualify for the semi-finals. It was a close game but Denmark won by ten runs. Denmark won the group with Canada second and both of these two qualified for the semi-finals, Bangladesh being placed third. Sri Lanka then defeated Denmark and Canada in turn to win the tournament.\nIn the 1979–80 season, Pakistan visited Bangladesh for the first time. It was eight years after the end of the Liberation War but tensions were still evident. The visit was in January during a break in Pakistan's six-Test tour of India. In a two-day match on 2 &amp; 3 January, the Pakistanis played a BCB XI at the M. A. Aziz Stadium in Chittagong. The BCB XI played well though each of the first three innings were ended early by sporting declarations. At tea on the second day, with the BCB XI struggling to chase a target of 211, there was a crowd riot which prematurely terminated the game as a draw. Because of the riot, an international match due to start at the National Stadium two days later was cancelled. It was not until January 1994 that the Pakistan national team could safely tour Bangladesh. In March 1980, an inter-divisional tournament was staged which included teams from the Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna and Rajshahi divisions. It was the first time that divisional teams were selected and this tournament anticipated the National Cricket League which was launched twenty years later. Fortunately, the riot in 1980 did not deter other tourists and MCC returned to Bangladesh in 1980–81, followed by the Calcutta and Hyderabad clubs from India in 1981–82.\nIn the 1982 ICC Trophy, also held in England, Bangladesh reached the semi-finals and lost to the eventual winners, Zimbabwe. This time, there were sixteen teams divided into two groups of eight. Bangladesh were in Group B. Two of their seven matches were abandoned because of bad weather and they had two very narrow wins against Malaysia, by a single run, and Netherlands, by four runs. They had only one defeat and so finished second. The defeat was against group winners Bermuda and it was a heavy one, again exposing Bangladesh's limitations at this stage of their development. Bangladesh were bowled out for only 67 and Bermuda needed just 15.5 overs to win by seven wickets. The limitations were again exposed in the semi-final when Bangladesh's batsmen could only reach 124, Zimbabwe winning easily by eight wickets. Zimbabwe defeated Bermuda in the final and there was another setback for Bangladesh when they lost the third-place playoff match to Papua New Guinea by three wickets despite an innings of 115 by Yousuf Rahman.\nIn 1983–84, Bangladesh hosted a tournament for the first time. This was the South East Asian Tournament (limited overs) in which the national team played against Hong Kong, Singapore and a BCB under-25 XI. Bangladesh defeated Hong Kong by 3 wickets in the final to claim the country's first international trophy.\nThe first New Zealand team to visit Bangladesh arrived in 1984–85. This was the New Zealand Ambassadors who played two limited overs matches in January against Dhaka University and a BCB Under-25 XI. In March, Sri Lanka returned to play a single three-day match against Bangladesh, captained by Gazi Ashraf, in the National Stadium. Bangladesh did well to secure a draw after scoring 139 and 152 for 6 against Sri Lanka's 429 for 9 declared.\nIn the 1985–86 season, neighbouring Bengal toured Bangladesh and played four matches against university and BCB teams in February and March. On the basis of their triumph in the South East Asian Tournament two years earlier, Bangladesh were invited to take part in the 1986 Asia Cup, the first edition of this tournament, in Sri Lanka after India withdrew. On 31 March, Bangladesh played their first-ever List A-classified Limited Overs International against Pakistan at the Tyronne Fernando Stadium in Moratuwa. Captained by Gazi Ashraf, Bangladesh were dismissed for 94 and Pakistan won easily by seven wickets. Three days later, Bangladesh lost to Sri Lanka by the same margin.\nWriting in 1986, Robin Marlar expressed positive views about Bangladeshi cricket including his opinion that the country would, with more encouragement and experience, one day win the ICC Trophy. He also mentioned the large crowds attending matches and the potential for thousands more to play the game. In June and July, Bangladesh competed in the 1986 ICC Trophy, again held in England. As in 1982, there were two qualifying groups and Bangladesh were placed sixth in Group A after a disappointing campaign.\n1987 to 1996.\nBangladesh hosted the 1988 Asia Cup, competing against India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the first List A classified matches to be played in the country. Bangladesh were the rank outsiders and, as expected, were easily beaten by each of their three opponents. Gazi Ashraf again captained the team. Five of the tournament's seven matches, including the final, were played at the Bangabandhu National Stadium and the other two, both involving Bangladesh themselves, at the M. A. Aziz Stadium in Chittagong. The tournament was won by India who defeated Sri Lanka by six wickets in the final.\nThere were visits by the Hyderabad Blues and Denmark in January and February 1990 to play limited overs games against the BCB XI and club sides only and none of the matches were List A classified. The 1990 ICC Trophy in June was held in the Netherlands and Bangladesh performed with credit, qualifying via two group phases for the semi-final where they were drawn against Zimbabwe and lost by 84 runs. Zimbabwe, who won the tournament, were elected to ICC Full Member status soon afterwards. Bangladesh played in the 1990–91 Asia Cup in India but were well beaten in their two matches by Sri Lanka and the host nation.\nIn December 1992, Bangladesh hosted a SAARC Quadrangular tournament in which their national team competed against the A-teams of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, all the matches being List A classified and all to be played in Dhaka at the National Stadium. Bangladesh defeated Sri Lanka A by seven wickets in the opening game but then lost by five wickets to Pakistan A. Their third match against India A was interrupted in the ninth over by a crowd riot and abandoned. It was rescheduled three days later but with the situation still volatile, it was cancelled along with the final which would have been India A v Pakistan A.\nThe situation was calmer the following season (1993–94) when there were short visits by Zimbabwe (November) and Pakistan (January) to play two limited overs matches each against the national team. Being friendlies, these games are not List A-classified. Zimbabwe won their matches by margins of 9 and 13 runs. Pakistan won their two games by 62 runs and 7 wickets. Although the national team were having limited success against opponents with greater experience, domestic cricket in Bangladesh was making progress and expanding. In 1994, the ICC estimated that there were 93,000 people playing cricket in Bangladesh and, as a result, playing standards were rising.\nIn the same 1993-94 season the BCB inked a sponsorship agreement with Pepsi for the national cricket championship with the aim of eventually structuring the championship to be similar to India's Ranji Trophy in furtherance of Bangladesh's Test ambitions. A joint Pepsi-BCB Foundation for coaching budding players was also part of the agreement. To this end the 1993/94 Pepsi National Cricket Championship retained the traditional 45-overs one day format for the zonal group games but the semi-finals consisted of each team having a single 60-over innings and the match being played over two days and the final consisted of a two day match with each team having a single 80-overs innings.\nBangladesh competed in the 1994 ICC Trophy in Kenya and reached the quarter-final stage and finished third in their group behind Kenya and the Netherlands. In December 1994, Bangladesh hosted a second SAARC Quadrangular against the A-teams of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, all the matches being List A classified and all to be played in Dhaka at the National Stadium. The problems of 1992 were not repeated and Bangladesh reached the final where they lost to India A by 52 runs. Kenya, one of Bangladesh's main opponents in Associate Member cricket, visited in January 1995 to play five one-day matches. These were not List A classified and Bangladesh won all three of the international fixtures. England's A team visited Bangladesh in February 1995 and played three double innings matches, not first-class, all against the national team. England A won the first two and the third, in which Aminul Islam scored a century, was drawn. Bangladesh were in the 1995 Asia Cup in Sharjah against India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka but lost all three of their first round matches. MCC returned in February 1996 to play a mixture of one-day and three-day matches.\nFor the 1994-95 Pepsi National Cricket Championship, the format returned entirely to a 45-overs one day tournament even for the semi-finals and final.\n1997 to 2000.\nBangladesh first began to actively pursue full membership and test status recognition within the ICC from 1996 with the induction of the new Board President, Saber Hossain Chowdhury.\nThe SAARC Quadrangular returned to Bangladesh in February 1997, Pakistan A defeating India A in the final. Bangladesh fared badly and were well beaten in all of their three matches. Disappointing as that was, only two months later Bangladesh had their first international success when they won the 1997 ICC Trophy in Kuala Lumpur.\nBangladesh won all five of their matches in the tournament's Group B to reach the quarter-finals, which were two more round-robin groups of four. Bangladesh qualified for the semi-finals defeating Netherlands and Hong Kong while the other game against Ireland was abandoned because of bad weather. In the semi-final, Bangladesh defeated Scotland by 72 runs. They were now playing in the final itself against Kenya and winning by two wickets, scoring the winning run from the last ball of the match.\nFollowing the success of the team in the ICC Trophy, BCB president Chowdhury informed the CEO of the ICC Dave Richards that Bangladesh intended to apply for test status. Aware that on-field performances alone would not be enough to secure full membership for Bangladesh despite an ICC development committee having already recommended Bangladesh as the 10th full member and test playing nation ahead of the ICC's annual meeting in June 1997, Chowdhury and the board also targeted host major international cricket series, including the Independence Trophy, the first ICC Knockout tournament in 1998, and the final of the Asian Test Championship.\nDomestically, Bangladesh began to reintroduce multi-day two innings matches, with an eye towards applying for full membership and test cricket status, with the 1997 National Cricket Championship where a four-day final (with 2 innings per team) was scheduled, but Chittagong DSA beat Bangladesh Biman by and innings and 64 runs with a day to spare to retain the Championship on May 12th.\nBangladesh applied for full membership and test status in May 1997, with India proposing and Pakistan seconding the application. However, the dearth of the longer from of the game in Bangladesh and disappointing on-field results persuaded the ICC against granting full membership. \nAt the June 1997 ICC annual meeting the ICC moved to expand cricket worldwide by conferring on Bangladesh both first-class and one-day status. This meant that any matches they play against full member countries were considered official one-day internationals, or would have first=class status if they were three or four-day matches. New Zealand was slated to be one of the first countries to host Bangladesh under this status in the 1997-98 season.\nThe national team's debut in official first-class cricket was 17–19 November 1997 at Seddon Park, Hamilton, New Zealand, against a Northern Conference team. Bangladesh were guesting in the 1997–98 Shell Conference. They lost this match by an innings and 151 runs and were similarly outclassed in their other matches in the tournament. In January 1998, Bangladesh hosted the List A-classified Coca-Cola Silver Jubilee Independence Cup involving India and Pakistan. They lost both their matches and India defeated Pakistan in the final.\nAt their annual meeting in June 1998, the ICC executive committee extended the time-limit for Bangladesh to justify its claim for full membership and test status by one year to the next ICC annual general meeting in June 1999. To this end, the ICC formed a three member committee (with Bobby Simpson of Australia, Nasim-ul Ghani of Pakistan and Andy Pycroft of Zimbabwe) to assess the conditions of wickets and umpiring and work out details for Bangladesh's domestic cricket including the introduction of regularly structured matches of the longer form of cricket.\nIn 1998–99, Bangladesh hosted the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy (known as the Wills International Cup) during October and November, although it being for Test nations only they could not play themselves but providing neutral venue. South Africa won the tournament. During November, the West Indies A team visited and having played three List A matches against Bangladesh, starting on 12 November the two teams played the first-ever first-class match in Bangladesh (i.e., since independence). West Indies A won by 8 wickets. The final of the 1998–99 Asian Test Championship was played at Dhaka in March 1999, Pakistan winning by an innings and 175 runs against Sri Lanka. Later that month, Bangladesh hosted Kenya and Zimbabwe for the List A Meril International Tournament, won convincingly by Zimbabwe.\nIn domestic cricket, Bangladesh continued putting in place the structures to support their bid for full member status as the National Cricket Championship continued having multi-day two innings matches for the semi-finals and finals (group matches were now 50-over one day games while semi-finals were three-day matches and finals were four-day matches) for both the 1998 season and the 1998-99 season. Additionally the BCB decided to change the format of the Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League in the 1998-99 season from the traditional 50-over one day format to matches of 80-overs per side played over two days to enable more players to be habituated in playing two or three days matches. \nThere was some controversy over this decision to change the format of the Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League, since there were concerns that players would not be adequately prepared ahead of the 1999 Cricket World Cup which followed the 50-over one day format.\nThe Bangladesh team played in the Cricket World Cup for the first time, having qualified by winning the 1997 ICC Trophy, for the 1999 tournament in Great Britain. They did not get past the group stage but had a memorable victory by 62 runs over Pakistan.\nOn 25 June, five days after the conclusion of 1999 Cricket World Cup, Bangladesh lost a vote on becoming a full member when it secured the votes of 5 full members (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, West Indies and Zimbabwe) and the then all 25 associate members (it required the votes of 7 full members and all 25 associates in order to have become a full member). Board President Chowdhury considered the vote an encouraging development as prior to the vote it was thought that only the three Asian full members would have voted in favour. As Chowdhury later noted, all nine of the full members supported Bangladesh's ambition for full membership, however in that vote, five voted in favour of full membership at that time while the other four advised for a review of Bangladesh's performance for another year.\nFollowing the 1999 vote, the BCB conducted more cricket diplomacy targeting especially Australia and South Africa with development deals between them and the BCB in order to obtain the required vote of 7 full members. Meanwhile as part of an ICC plan to prepare Bangladesh for test status and to address some shortcomings that surfaced in an ICC report at that 1999 meeting, it was planned for two Test teams and as two 'A' teams to visit Bangladesh that coming winter with a focus on three to four-day matches.\nFurther domestic developments to support the bid for full membership occurred with the inauguration of the National Cricket League as a league tournament of three-day matches among teams representing Bangladesh's divisions The BCB executive committee had voted to introduce a national league of three-day matches similar to India's Ranji trophy and Pakistan's Qaid-E-Azam trophy at their 6 August 1999 meeting. Originally intending to run from 10 November until 20 December, the tournament actually ran from 16 November 1999 until 5 January 2000 with Chittagong winning the tournament after topping the points table.\nBangladesh's efforts both on the field (internationally and domestically) and off the field (with engagement with the full member boards) began to pay off in early 2000 as by February 2000 the executive board of the ICC had recommended full membership for Bangladesh at the June 2000 annual meeting of the full ICC board and between March and May 2000 the boards for Australia, Pakistan and New Zealand all voiced their support for Bangladesh's bid for test status.\nFinally, Bangladesh's progress had received recognition and, on 26 June 2000 by the unanimous vote of all 9 full members, Bangladesh became a Full Member of the ICC, which enabled them to play Test cricket. The BCB president Saber Chowdhury described his country's elevation to Test status as \"the third most historic event in our national life\". In May/June 2000, Bangladesh had hosted the 2000 Asia Cup, won by Pakistan. In November of that year, Bangladesh played their first-ever Test match against India at the National Stadium, India winning by 9 wickets.\n2001 to 2010.\nThe country's main domestic competition, the National Cricket League (NCL), began in 1999–2000 with teams from each of Bangladesh's (then six) administrative divisions: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi and Sylhet.\nIn 2000–01, its second season, the NCL became a first-class competition, sponsored by the Green Delta insurance company, and won by Biman Bangladesh Airlines. The 2000–01 NCL involved eight teams playing twelve matches each in two groups. Four teams qualified for a final stage in which they each played a further eight games. Group A consisted of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Dhaka Division. Group B had Dhaka Metropolis, Khulna, Barisal and Sylhet.\nIn 2001–02, Ispahani Mirzapore Tea became the sponsor of the NCL in addition to the new One-Day League, introduced as the premier limited overs competition. The NCL was reduced to six teams in 2001–02 with Dhaka Metropolis and the champions, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, both dropping out. Following creation of Rangpur Division in January 2010 as the country's seventh administrative region, the NCL in 2011–12 was again expanded to eight teams with the introduction of the Rangpur team and the return of Dhaka Metropolis, although the latter had no settled home venue.\nBetween 2001 and 2004, Bangladesh suffered from heavy defeats in ODI's. They also suffered from 5 heavy defeats and 1 no results in 2003 Cricket World Cup.\nThe board officially changed its name to Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), dropping the word \"Control\" from its title in January 2007.\n2011 to 2019.\nThe One-Day League was terminated after the 2010–11 season. The main List A limited overs competition since then is the Dhaka Premier Division, which began in 2013–14.\nBangladesh co-hosted the 2011 Cricket World Cup with India and Sri Lanka. The country was the sole host of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, the final of which was played at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium. In addition, Bangladesh has hosted, in succession, the three Asia Cup tournaments in 2012, 2014 and 2016.\nBangladesh also continued to do well in test cricket. They have beaten England and Sri Lanka in 2016–17 session. The win against Sri Lanka was the 100th test match and 9th winning test match for Bangladesh. A few months later they have beaten Australian test team in 1 match and drawn the series.\nThe Bangladesh Cricket League (BCL), another first-class competition, began in 2012–13. It is played by four teams selected on a zonal basis (North Zone, South Zone, East Zone and Central Zone) to give experience to leading players of a higher standard than the NCL and so prepare them for Test cricket. The winners of the four championships to 2016 have been Central Zone and South Zone winning two apiece. In April 2015, the BCL staged a One-Day League, which was won by East Zone.\nThe Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) is the country's main Twenty20 competition. It was founded in January 2012 and despite problems including match-fixing, it has been a commercial success, said by its promoters to be second only to the Indian Premier League (IPL) in terms of global revenue.\n2020 to present.\nBangabandhu centenary.\nIn 2020, to celebrate the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the BCB held a 50-over tournament named the BCB President's Cup with three teams, and a T20 tournament named the Bangabandhu T20 Cup with five."

        "text": "Robert Hughes Sr. (born May 15, 1928) is a retired American high school basketball coach. Hughes was the United States' all-time winningest high school basketball coach from February 11, 2003 to December 7, 2010, and is currently the winningest boys high school basketball coach in the United States with 1,333 wins. He was passed in wins by Leta Andrews of Granbury High School in Granbury, Texas, who compiled a national record 1,416 career victories in girls high school basketball before retiring in 2014.\nBiography.\nHughes joined the Army after high school. At 6'6\" he was recruited for a special unit that just played basketball; it was the first integrated team Hughes ever played on. When he left the Army, Texas Southern University offered him a basketball scholarship. Playing for coach Edward H. Adams, Hughes was an All-American at Southern. He started playing for the barnstorming Harlem Magicians in 1954, and was selected by the Boston Celtics as a supplemental draft pick in 1955 NBA Draft, but he did not make the team. Hughes returned to the Magicians in 1955, and met his wife, Jacquelyne Johnson, while playing in a tournament in Memphis, but a ruptured Achilles tendon later that season forced him to give up playing basketball. He returned home to Oklahoma and attended the University of Tulsa, graduating in 1957.\nCoaching career.\nHughes was hired by Douglas Aircraft as a mechanic after graduating from Tulsa, and worked there until his former coach at Texas Southern called to ask if Hughes had ever considered coaching. Hughes wasn’t initially interested, but Adams persisted and Hughes was hired at I. M. Terrell High School, in Fort Worth, Texas (an all-black high school) during segregation. Hughes led Terrell to three PVIL state championships and one runner up in the five years from 1963 to 1967.\nAfter segregation ended and I.M. Terrell was shut down in 1973, Hughes began coaching at Dunbar High School in the Fort Worth Independent School District. At Dunbar, Hughes won two state titles, finished as state runner-up three times, and took the team to the final four 12 times between 1977 and 2003, including ten final fours in the 17-year run between 1977 and 1993. In 32 seasons at Dunbar, Hughes only ever had one assistant coach, Leondas Rambo, who retired with Hughes in 2005.\nBetween Terrell and Dunbar combined, Hughes won five state basketball titles, and retired in 2005 as the all-time winningest high school basketball coach, passing Morgan Wootten in 2003. \"If you can't work hard and put out the best, you probably need to go home to your mama,\" Hughes was known for telling his players.\nHalls of fame and awards.\nOne of Hughes' greatest achievements was his election to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on March 31, 2017. Additional halls of fame include: Texas Basketball Hall of Fame (1993), High School Basketball Hall of Fame (2003), and the Texas Black Sports Hall of Fame (2013).\nHughes was selected as the NHSCA National High School Coach of the Year in 2003, and received the Morgan Wootten Lifetime Achievement Award by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010.\nPersonal life.\nHughes' wife of 57 years, Jacquelyne Sue Johnson Hughes, died July 1, 2014.\nHughes' son, Robert Hughes Jr., took over head coaching duties at Dunbar after Hughes Sr. retired in 2005, and is the current coach at Dunbar High School. He has two daughters. One, Carlye J. Hughes, was ordained the 11th Episcopal Bishop of Newark in September 2018. Another daughter, Robin L. Hughes, was named dean of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Education, Health and Human Behavior in July 2019.\nHughes resides in the Stop Six neighborhood of southeast Fort Worth.\nPopular culture.\nIn anticipation of Hughes' induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, filmmaker and former Dunbar basketball player, Mike Byars created a feature length documentary \"5700 Ramey Ave: The Story of Robert Hughes\" to chronicle Hughes' career."

        "text": "The Calvin–Hope men's basketball rivalry is a college sports rivalry between the men's basketball teams of Hope College Flying Dutchmen of Holland, Michigan, and the Calvin University Knights of Grand Rapids, Michigan, which participate at the NCAA Division III level.\nHistory.\nThe men's basketball teams first played each other in 1920. As of October 2023, the men's basketball teams have played 212 times, with the Hope Flying Dutchmen leading with 110 wins to the Calvin Knights' 102 wins. The rivalry, which originates from the historical separation of the Reformed Church in America and the Christian Reformed Church in North America, operates on a basis of more similarity than difference. Tom Davelaar, assistant coach to Hope's basketball team, once said, \"... both schools and fan bases are so alike - and yet we think we're different somehow. We're really just two peas in a pod.\" The face off in 2020 marked the 100th anniversary since the rivalry started.\nIn 2009, the rivalry turned ugly - the two teams faced off against each other in the MIAA championship when a Hope student was instigating fans in the upper concourse late in the 2nd half at VanNoord Arena celebrating what would become a Hope victory, when the Hope student kicked a Calvin student's legs and a scuffle occurred.\nIn 2015, it again turned ugly as Calvin students stormed the court in a nail-biter victory in the MIAA championship, while a Hope player laid in the middle of the floor, nearly getting trampled by the court storming.\nSignificance.\nIn 2005, ESPN polled its staff about who they thought were America's greatest college basketball rivalries, and the Calvin–Hope rivalry was voted fourth in all college basketball behind Carolina–Duke rivalry, Connecticut–Tennessee women's basketball rivalry, and Kentucky–Louisville rivalry. ESPN also conducted an on-line \"fan poll\" in which 80% of voters picked the Knights vs. Flying Dutchmen.\nThe rivalry between the two colleges is most prominent in basketball; however, the rivalry spans the schools' athletics."

        "text": "Walter Beasley Gilbert (February 5, 1915 – August 19, 1979) was an American gridiron football player, best known for playing college football for Auburn. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956.\nBiography.\nGilbert grew up in Fairfield, Alabama, and graduated from Darlington School in Rome, Georgia. He earned three varsity letters (1934–1936) playing football at Alabama Polytechnic Institute, officially renamed Auburn University in 1960. Gilbert was selected to All-America teams in 1935 and 1936, and was captain of the 1936 Auburn squad. He starred at center, and also played linebacker. His final season was somewhat hampered by an appendicitis operation he had in December 1935, but he still was voted the \"finest team player\" in his conference by coaches of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Gilbert concluded his college career by playing in the January 1, 1937, edition of the Bacardi Bowl. Contested in Havana, it ended in a 7–7 tie against Villanova. He received All-SEC football honors in each of his three varsity seasons.\nWhile in college, Gilbert was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society. He was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round of the 1937 NFL Draft, but he did not play professionally, opting to pursue a career in the oil industry. Gilbert was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956, and to the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1974.\nIn May 1938, Gilbert married Frances Wright; the couple first lived in Savannah, Georgia, where Gilbert was in business. In March 1940, a daughter was born to the couple in Miami. Gilbert served in the United States Army during World War II; entering in February 1942, he attained the rank of major. He worked in management for Texaco for many years, and headed their European operations before his retirement in the late 1970s.\nGilbert died in August 1979; he was survived by two daughters. In July 1980, Auburn announced the creation of the Walter Gilbert Award, given annually to an Auburn graduate who was a varsity athlete and has demonstrated at least 20 years of superior performance in their profession. The award was first issued in May 1981, to Joseph Lester Stewart (1915–2004), who served as an officer in the United States Marine Corp from 1937 to 1965 and retired at the rank of brigadier general. Stewart had served as cadet colonel of Auburn's ROTC brigade and was a fellow 1937 graduate with Gilbert."

        "title": "Cricket West Indies",
        "text": "Cricket West Indies (CWI) is the governing body for cricket in the West Indies (a sporting confederation of over a dozen mainly English-speaking Caribbean countries and dependencies that once formed the British West Indies). It was originally formed in the early 1920s as the West Indies Cricket Board of Control, but changed its name to West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) in 1996. In November 2015, the Board resolved to rename itself as Cricket West Indies as part of a restructuring exercise that would also see the creation of a separate commercial body. This rebranding formally occurred in May 2017.\nCWI has been a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1926. It operates the West Indies cricket team and West Indies A cricket team, organising Test tours and one-day internationals with other teams. It also organises domestic cricket in West Indies, including the Regional Four Day Competition and the Regional Super50 domestic one-day (List A) competition. The CWI has also collaborated with Sir Allen Stanford in the organisation of the domestic Stanford 20/20 competition for the Twenty20 format of cricket. Later they created their own Twenty20 league called Caribbean Twenty20 after disbanding Stanford 20/20. In 2013 they created Caribbean Premier League, a Professional Twenty20 league.\nCWI's membership includes the six territorial cricket associations of the various countries and territories which contest the West Indies first-class and limited-overs competition in the Caribbean. Each provides two directors, in addition to a number of non-member directors. Two of these associations are themselves multi-national boards representing a number of countries and dependencies.\nThe president of CWI is Dr Kishore Shallow, who replaced Ricky Skerrit in 2023. Johnny Grave is its chief executive officer.\nSince 2005, per an ICC mandate, the West Indies Women's Cricket Federation (WIWCF) has been integrated with CWI. The President of the WIWCF is Carol Whilby-Maxwell and the Secretary is Michael Seepersaud.\nCWI is charged with aiding regional development of cricket in the Americas region, under the ICC's development program.\nHistory.\nFrom the 1880s onwards there had been no central body to co-ordinate the Inter-Colonial Tournaments and matches, select composite West Indian XIs for tours and against touring sides and to organise the West Indian tours of England, Canada and the United States. Such organisation as there was, was done by an informal coalition of the major clubs in the region. West Indian cricketers however had felt the need for the establishment of such an organisation although geography and culture were to make such a task difficult. However, with the help of one influential Marylebone Cricket Club member, R. H. Mallett (the manager of the 1906 and 1923 West Indian tours and future manager of the 1930–31 West Indian tour to Australia), representatives of the various territories finally got together and ultimately formed the West Indies Cricket Board of Control. The preliminary meeting was in Bridgetown, Barbados, from which the informal \"West Indies Cricket Conference\" was founded in 1926. The West Indies Cricket Conference held its first official meeting on 22 January 1927 at the Bridgetown Club in Barbados attended by Mallett and representatives from the Windward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Demerara (British Guiana). Delegates from Jamaica and the Leeward Islands were invited but unfortunately were unable to attend. At this January meeting the delegates present decided to form the West Indies Cricket Board of Control (WICBC) which would be composed of a president, a secretary and two delegates each from Barbados, Demerara, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago and one delegate each from the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands. The WICBC's first meeting was held on 17 and 18 June 1927 in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad with Harold Austin (the former captain of the 1906 and 1923 West Indian tours of England) serving as the first president. The board as constituted was enlarged in 1982 when the Leeward and Windward Islands were given the same representation as the other full Members. The president was appointed by the board at an ordinary general meeting and had to be a person resident in the West Indies who had shown a keen and active interest in West Indies cricket. His term of office was for two years (and eligible for re-election) or until his successor was appointed. Board members were also thenceforth to be appointed by their Cricket Associations although in British Guiana the Georgetown Cricket Club held this responsibility until 1943, and in Trinidad the Queens Park Oval Club until 1981 when their respective cricket associations were given recognition. There was a provision for associate members who would be entitled to attend meetings but not to move resolutions or vote. Bermuda and Belize had been the only members in this category prior to their cessation as Associate Members. According to Ram Hiralal, former president of the Suriname Cricket Association, up until 2002 when Suriname applied for and gained affiliate membership of the ICC, it was also an associate member of the West Indies Cricket Board.\nDomestic competitions.\nThe West Indies' major men's domestic competitions are the Regional Four Day Competition (first-class competition) and the Regional Super50 (List A one-day competition) and more recently the Hero Caribbean Premier League (domestic Twenty20 competition – replacing the Caribbean Twenty20, which in turn replaced the Stanford 20/20 that had been financed and organised by Allen Stanford). Meanwhile, the major women's domestic competitions are the Women's Super50 Cup and the Twenty20 Blaze.\nOther CWI domestic competitions include the TCL Under-19 West Indies Challenge (three-day first-class competition), TCL Under-19 West Indies Challenge Limited Overs Series (one-day limited overs competition), CLICO West Indies Under-15 competition and the WIWCF Women's Senior Tournament. One prominent former competition (not originally organized by the WICB) was the Inter-Colonial Tournament.\nIn the case of the Regional Four Day Competition and the Regional Super50 the following first-class domestic teams participate:\nIn 1978 Belize had requested (through the then Belize Cricket Association) in a letter to the WICBC to participate in the Shell Shield and the List A competitions, but the WICBC was unable to entertain their request.\nFor the TCL Under-19 West Indies Challenge (both the first-class and limited overs competitions) it is the Under-19 squads for these teams which participate, while for the CLICO Under-15 West Indies tournament it is the Under-15 squads for these teams which participate. In the 2004 TCL Under-19 Challenge the Under-19 Bermuda national cricket team and an Under-19 combined Americas cricket team also took part.\nIn the women's WIWCF Senior Tournament and the Stanford 20/20 competition the separate components of the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands compete individually. Additionally for the Stanford 20/20 competition teams from outside the West Indies sporting confederation, but within the Caribbean, also compete including the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Cuba (which was barred from competing in 2008 by the US embargo), the Turks and Caicos Islands (both competing in 2008) as well as the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico (announced for the 2009 edition of the Stanford 20/20).\nIn the Caribbean Premier League there are franchise teams competing, with each franchise currently representing one of the six traditional cricketing territories in the West Indies:"

Cricket Kenya organizes two six team regional tournaments in the T20 and 50 Over formats of the game to replace the defunct Sahara Elite League. These are the East Africa Cup and Premier League. Cricket Kenya organizes the Kenya national cricket team and conducts the international matches with the team.\nStructure.\nCricket Kenya consists of a national board consisting of a chairperson, vice chairperson, treasurer, secretary and directors selected from its affiliate provincial associations. These are\nHistory.\nCricket in Kenya.\nCricket in Kenya dates back to the early 1890s when colonial settlers, and administrators began playing against one another in Nairobi and Mombasa among several other venues. The first match of any consequence took place in 1899, and in 1910 a three-day fixture between Officials and Settlers started, remaining the highlight of the domestic calendar until 1964, along with Europeans v. Asians which began in 1933. In 1966, Kenya become a member of the East African Cricket Conference (E.A.C.C.) and participated in its annual Quadrangular tournament which included the three East African countries and Zambia. The tournament played in each respective country by rotation saw Kenya winning nine of the 15 competitions between 1960 and 1980. A number of Kenyans took part in the 1975 World Cup as part of the East Africa side, and that unit again appeared in the inaugural 1979 ICC Trophy, but by 1982 Kenya were playing under their own flag, under the Kenya Cricket Association. It was under this body that Kenyan cricket reached its peak, at the 2003 Cricket World Cup, which it co-hosted and reached the semifinals of. In subsequent years however, bitter disputes between board and players led to a series of strikes, but more cripplingly, the KCA found itself battling most of the country's stakeholders. By the end of the dispute in 2005, Kenyan cricket was in the doldrums, was sponsorless, and was effectively in international isolation. Later in the year it was stripped of its ODI status by the ICC.\nEstablishment Of Cricket Kenya.\nThe final installation of Cricket Kenya as the body in charge of Cricket in Kenya came at the end of a long drawn out dispute the previous management, the Kenya Cricket Association and its Provincial boards among other stakeholders in the game. The dispute, which centered around issues such as floundering constitutional review, and financial irregularities which had seen the KCA rack up almost 500,000 dollars of debt, and as well as periodic player disputes over pay that eventually saw the KCA lose all credibility within Kenyan cricketing circles as players, administrators and even the Kenya government gradually withdrew all recognition and support of the KCA in favour of Cricket Kenya, which was then an interim board put together by the Kenya Government to avoid the chaos that had been created by the KCA over the management of Cricket in Kenya. Ultimately, with the intervention of a high powered ICC delegation led by Percy Sonn and Peter Chingoka, an agreement on a new elections and a new constitution was agreed upon. The board members that were elected in the subsequent elections then formally wound up the Kenya Cricket Association paving the way for its official replacement by a new organisational body to be known as Cricket Kenya.\nTom Tikolo served as the CEO of Cricket Kenya from 2005 to 2009 when he resigned due to cash scandal. After extensive searching he was replaced by Tom Sears in mid-2010. Sears himself stepped down in mid 2012 to pursue a career in rugby administration."

        "text": "Anthony Allen (born 1 September 1986) is a former international rugby union player and coach. He played for Premiership Rugby club Gloucester 91 times between 2005 and 2009 then 126 times for Leicester Tigers as a centre before his retirement due to injury in 2015. He was a Premiership champion in 2010 and 2013, where he was named \"man of the match\" in the final.\nAfter his playing career he had a spell as Coventry's defence coach.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Southampton, in his early life, he played rugby for the Trojans Rugby Club at Stoneham Lane, Eastleigh in Hampshire. In 1999, Allen toured South Africa with the South England Schools side, beating Natal 22–20. In the middle of the tour Allen was hospitalised with food poisoning, missing the end of the Tour. In 2000 Allen Won the Hampshire Cup with the Trojans Under-13 side, whilst attending Boundary Oak School at Roche Court, just outside Fareham. From there he moved on to Clayesmore School at the age of 13, where he was a member of Devine House. He was a member of the Clayesmore 1st XVs from year 10, effectively playing three years above his age group.\nGloucester career.\n2005–06.\nIn 2005, Allen joined Gloucester straight from Millfield School. At the start of the season, Allen helped Gloucester to triumph in the Middlesex 7s with some fantastic tries. He made his first team debut in Gloucester's Anglo Welsh Cup match against Bristol, which Gloucester won 34–6. Allen scored his first try for Gloucester in their 106–3 demolition of Bucuresti. His first Guinness Premiership try came 2 weeks later against Leicester at Welford Road. A glorious try against Worcester Warriors helped Gloucester to the European Challenge Cup Final. During his first season with Gloucester, Allen summed up his tremendous talent with a glorious brace of tries against London Wasps. He also played an important role in the defeat of London Irish in the European Challenge Cup Final.\n2006–07.\nAfter a great start to the season England came calling for Allen. His performance against Agen at Kingsholm, where he scored two tries in defeat, was a catalyst for his call up. On 28 November 2006, Allen signed a two-year extension to his contract. He came back from national duty and continued his great form for Gloucester with 3 tries in 3 games in December. Allen finished the season with 9 tries including one in Gloucester's semi-final victory against Saracens. He was also voted the young player of the season by Gloucester's fans. Unfortunately for Allen and Gloucester they suffered defeat at the hands of Leicester in the Guinness Premiership final.\n2007–08.\nAllen started the season fantastically with two tries in the opening 2 weeks against Leeds Carnegie and Saracens. Tries against Ospreys and Bourgoin in the Heineken Cup helped Gloucester to the quarter-finals. Allen was one of the key players for Gloucester starting 29 games, more than anybody else in the squad. As well as Allen's obvious talent for breaking tackles and scoring tries his immense tackling plays a vital role to the team.\n2008–09.\nAllen, in his fourth season playing for Gloucester, firmly established himself as first choice inside centre alongside Mike Tindall at outside centre. The arrival of Olly Barkley from Bath presented a higher level of competition for Allen than in previous seasons. On the opening day of the season, Allen suffered an injury against Leicester which kept him out for 2 months. He returned in November against Saracens and his try in this game helped Gloucester to a win at Vicarage Road. Gloucester ended the season disappointingly and Allen moved to Leicester for the 2009/10 season.\nLeicester career.\n2009–10.\nIn his first season at Leicester, Allen was faced with breaking into a first-choice centre pairing of Aaron Mauger and Dan Hipkiss. However, his ability to cover both positions and a series of injuries to his rivals allowed him to quickly establish himself in the side. Before long, he was a first-choice centre and he marked his debut season at the club with the first major trophy of his career as Leicester won the Guinness Premiership final against Saracens. He finished the season with six tries in 28 games in all competitions.\n2010–11.\nHis second season saw Allen as Leicester's first-choice inside centre alongside the teenage Manu Tuilagi. Allen put in a series of solid performances—both in attack and defence—that earned no international recognition, but saw him named as the Player's Player of the Season and scorer of Try of the Season for his solo score against Bath.\n2012–13.\nAllen won his second Premiership title when playing in the final as Leicester defeated Northampton.\nEngland.\nHe made his England debut against New Zealand on 5 November 2006, partnering Newcastle Falcons' Jamie Noon in the centre. Allen received multiple stitches in his mouth halfway through that first half after being hit in the face by his New Zealand opposite number, but Allen was dropped after they lost 25–18 to Argentina.\nHe was an integral part of the England Saxons sides that won the Churchill Cup in Canada / USA 2008 and again in 2010.\nCoaching career.\nAll was appointed defence coach at Championship club Coventry in 2019, before relinquishing the role in November 2020 to pursue interests away from rugby."

It was the third successive season Sri Lanka visited New Zealand, after the 2005–06 tour was aborted and reschuled for the winter of 2005–06. Originally, the tour had been set to include three Tests and five One Day Internationals, but New Zealand Cricket chief executive Martin Snedden announced in June that one of the Tests would be replaced with two Twenty20 Internationals.\nSri Lanka lost their ODI series 1–4 and the Test series 0–2 the last time they visited New Zealand, but beat New Zealand at the 2006 Champions Trophy. However, that was their only victory in the group stage, as New Zealand progressed from the group. On the ICC Test Championship tables, Sri Lanka were ranked two places ahead of New Zealand, but New Zealand were ranked third on the ODI tables, three places ahead of Sri Lanka.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule was announced on 22 June.\nFirst-class matches.\nTour Match: Otago v Sri Lankans, 30 November–3 December.\nMatch drawn\nAt Dunedin, Sri Lanka passed 400 twice, with Upul Tharanga making the highest score of the match with 108 in the third innings. For Otago, Jordan Sheed, Craig Cumming and Aaron Redmond all passed 50, and the remaining eight batsmen contributed 86 runs to the total in the first innings. Lasith Malinga took three wickets, with wicket-keeper Gareth Hopkins the highest-batting, and no-balled 11 times.\nFirst Test: New Zealand v Sri Lanka, 7 December–9 December.\nShane Bond took three wickets in his first six overs in his first Test match for a year, and Sri Lanka were bowled out for 154 with only Tharanga and Chamara Kapugedera passing 20. In reply, New Zealand trailed by 41 with six wickets in hand, but Daniel Vettori's half-century helped score 206 against a Muttiah Muralitharan-led bowling attack. Murali took four for 65 from 34 overs, while Chaminda Vaas took two wickets in an over and ended with three for 49. The second time around, Kumar Sangakkara made an unbeaten century from number three, out of a total of 170. After completing an easy single to complete Sangakkara's century Muralitharan walked down the pitch to celebrate while the ball was being returned to the wicketkeeper. McCullum then appealed for a runout and Muralitharan was dismissed, ending Sri Lanka's second innings. After the match Jayawardene expressed the Sri Lankan team's disappointment about the incident, saying it was contrary to the spirit of the game, but Fleming and McCullum were unrepentant. New Zealand managed to reach the modest target of 118 to win the game, despite a mini-collapse.\nSecond Test: New Zealand v Sri Lanka, 15 December–19 December.\nKumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva put on a stand of 121 runs to lift the Sri Lankans to a score of 268 in their first innings after Jayawardene chose to bat. Sangakkara hit 21 4s and one 6 on his way to 156 not out, while Silva scored 61 runs. The only other player for Sri Lanka to get into double figures was Prasanna Jayawardene, while 5 of their players didn't manage to trouble the scorers. At the end of the first day, New Zealand in reply were 64 for 4, still 204 runs behind with Malinga taking 3 scalps.\nOn the second day, Muralitharan and Malinga shared the remaining 6 wickets of the New Zealand innings, as they were bowled out for 130 before lunch. The second Sri Lankan innings started off shaky, with their first three wickets, including the in-form Sangakkara falling with just 62 runs on the board. Chamara Silva then came to the crease and helped the Sri Lankans to 255 for 5 at the end of the day, with Silva getting to 79 not out at stumps.\nThe third day belonged to Sri Lanka once more, with Silva reaching 152 not out by the end of the innings, and Chaminda Vaas chipping in with a well made 47. Needing an unlikely 504 runs to win the match, New Zealand lost their openers with just 60 runs scored. On the fourth and final day, the New Zealanders lost five quick wickets falling to 163 for 7, before Vettori and Franklin shared a partnership of 96. After Vettori got out, the New Zealand team lost their way and finished with 286. Sri Lanka won by 217 runs to level the test series 1-1. The player of the match was Chamara Silva after scoring 213 runs in the match."

        "text": "Canadian cricket tours of England have taken place only sporadically and few matches of first-class status have been played.\n1880s.\nThe first two Canadian teams to visit England arrived in the 1880s. In the 1880 season they played 17 minor matches with a 5–6 win–loss record; while the 1887 team played 19 minor matches with a 5/5 record.\nInter-war period.\nThe next visit was after World War I in the 1922 season when the Canadians played 11 minor matches, won none and lost four. The 1936 team fared much better: they won 7 and lost only 1 with 7 drawn, all the games again being minor.\nFirst-class matches in 1954.\nIn the 1954 season, the Canadians played 15 matches in all, and four of them were first-class. Overall, they won four and lost three but in the four first-class matches they could only manage two draws and two defeats. Rain affected many matches on the tour. Prominent members of the team included Jimmy Cameron, who had played Test cricket for the West Indies in 1948–49 and Kenneth Trestrail, who had toured with the 1950 West Indies team in England, without playing Tests. Tom Brierley, the former Glamorgan and Lancashire wicketkeeper and batsman, was also in the side.\nLater tours.\nCanada visited England in both 1974 and 1981 but played no further first-class matches.\n1979 ICC Trophy and World Cup.\nIn 1979, Canada visited England to take part in the ICC Trophy, the one-day limited overs (on this occasion 60 overs a side) competition for non-Test playing countries, held in late May and early June. Canada won three of their four group matches, played on club grounds in the west Midlands, beating Bangladesh, Fiji and Malaysia, but losing to Denmark. They finished second in their group and, as the second-placed team with the best record, qualified for the semi-finals. On 6 June at Burton upon Trent, they beat Bermuda by 6 wickets. In the final, at Worcester on 21 June, they lost to Sri Lanka by 60 runs. However, as finalists they had already qualified for the World Cup, held between the ICC Trophy semi-finals and final.\nCanada were rather out of their depth in the World Cup, losing all three of their group matches: to Pakistan by 8 wickets at Headingley on 9 June, to England by 8 wickets at Old Trafford on 14 June, when they were bowled out for 45 (though lasting 40.3 overs), and to Australia at Edgbaston by 7 wickets. John Valentine, a left-arm medium-pace bowler, dismissed Majid Khan, Mike Brearley and Rick Darling, returning figures of 9–3–18–1, 7–2–20–1 and 3–0–28–1."

        "title": "English cricket team in North America in 1859",
        "text": "The English cricket team in North America in 1859 was the first ever overseas cricket tour by an English team. The touring team is sometimes referred to as George Parr's XI.\nOrganisation.\nThe idea for the tour came from William Pickering, a former player who had emigrated to Canada in 1852 and first captained Canada against the United States the following year. Together with Robert Waller from St George's Cricket Club, Pickering opened discussions for a possible tour in 1856 but financial problems meant that it was three years before the money could be raised. The English team required a guarantee of £600, which Pickering obtained through the Montreal Cricket Club, Hamilton Cricket Club and St George's Cricket Club.\nTeam.\nThe English team comprised six members of the All-England Eleven and six of the United All-England Eleven. With George Parr as captain, the twelve players were effectively the cream of professional talent in the 1859 English cricket season that had just ended:\nMatches.\nFive matches were played, all against XXIIs, so none had first-class status. Three exhibition games were also played in which the 12 England players divided and added five North Americans to each team to make up eleven-a-side matches. Including travelling time, the trip lasted two months and each English player (all professionals) earned about £90, a sizeable sum at the time.\nThe team's opponents were:\nOne of the exhibition matches was played 14 October at Camac Woods.\nAmong their opponents were Harry Wright, a future pioneer of professional baseball, and Charles H. T. Collis, future Medal of Honor winner in the American Civil War.\nIn addition to the exhibition matches they also had two excursions to view the Niagara Falls.\nThe English side was exceedingly strong and would probably have beaten any twenty-two in England. There were excellent crowds for the first three matches but the weather in mid-October turned very cold and reduced the attendances at the last two. It was reported that the fielders wore gloves and overcoats in the last match.\nAftermath.\nA product of the tour was a book by Fred Lillywhite, who travelled as scorer, entitled \"The English Cricketers' Trip to Canada and the United States\" and published in 1860. A reprint of the book was published in 1980 with an introduction by Robin Marlar, including biographies of all of the players.\nFor the general growth of cricket in the United States, it was most unfortunate that this pioneering tour occurred only 18 months before the American Civil War began. If the war had not broken out, it is highly likely that two or three follow-up tours might have been arranged in the early 1860s, thus building on the interest created by the initial trip. As it was, the enthusiasm for cricket faded in the war years and the troops on both sides adopted the embryonic game of baseball. When English teams resumed tours to America in 1868, not only did they have to try to rekindle the enthusiasm, but in baseball they had a serious rival to contend with."

        "title": "Rowing at the 1964 Summer Olympics – Men's single sculls",
        "text": "The men's single sculls event was a rowing event conducted as part of the Rowing at the 1964 Summer Olympics programme. It was held from 11 to 15 October at the Toda Rowing Course. There were 13 competitors from 13 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Vyacheslav Ivanov of the Soviet Union, his third consecutive victory (and the fourth for the Soviet Union) in the event. Ivanov's three gold medals in the event remains (through the 2016 Games) tied for the best results for any individual single sculler (with Pertti Karppinen); only Ekaterina Karsten has more medals in (women's) single sculls, though she took only two golds along with a silver and a bronze. The second spot on the podium was also a repeat of 1960; Achim Hill of the United Team of Germany became the sixth man to win multiple single sculls medals by repeating as silver medalist. Bronze this time went to Gottfried Kottmann of Switzerland, that nation's first medal in the event since 1924.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nOnly two of the 13 single scullers from the 1960 Games returned, but they were the top two: gold medalist Vyacheslav Ivanov of the Soviet Union and silver medalist Achim Hill of the United Team of Germany. Ivanov had won gold in 1956 as well, along with the 1959, 1961, and 1964 European championships and the inaugural World Championship in 1962. He was a prohibitive favorite to take a third gold medal in the event, especially with the absence of the two strongest potential challengers: New Zealand's James Hill (who had followed a fourth-place finish at the 1960 Games with British Empire and Commonwealth Games championships), who was not in Tokyo, and the United States' Seymour Cromwell (reigning Pan American and Diamond Challenge Sculls champion), who competed only in the double sculls. Long-shot challengers included Achim Hill, Gottfried Kottmann of Switzerland (1963 Diamond Challenge winner), and Vaclav Kozak of Czechoslovakia (1963 European champion); very long-shot challengers were Rob Groen of the Netherlands (runner-up to Kozak and then Ivanov at the European championships in 1963 and 1964) and Alberto Demiddi of Argentina (second to Cromwell at the 1964 Diamond Challenge Sculls).\nFor the second consecutive Games, no nations made their debut in the event. The United States made its 11th appearance, most among nations competing but one behind Great Britain which was missing the event for only the second time.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. \nThe 1964 tournament introduced the \"B\" final, a consolation final that ranked rowers that had not qualified for the main, or \"A\", final. As in 1960, there were three rounds: semifinals, a repechage, and the final round. Six boats had become a standard final size in 1960 and continued here.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe top rower in each heat advanced to Final A, with all others sent to the repechages.\nRepechage.\nThe top finisher in each of the three repechage heats joined the finalists. The second and third-place finishers competed in a consolation final for 7th-12th places. The fourth-place finisher, in the only repechage with that many competitors, was supposed to be eliminated; however, Plettner competed in Final B while Kozak and Kubiak did not.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe consolation final determined places from 7th to 12th."

He is the former general manager of the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers NBA teams, as well as former team president of the 76ers.\nEarly life and education.\nKing grew up in Sterling, Virginia where he played basketball at Park View High School.\nHe received a scholarship to play at Duke University and wore jersey number 55. He was known primarily for his tough defense. In his senior season, he served as a captain of Duke's 1988 Final Four team and was named NABC National Defensive Player of The Year.\nPost-playing career.\nKing served as an assistant coach for the Indiana Pacers for four seasons under Larry Brown. He joined the professional ranks after spending four seasons as an assistant at Illinois State University under head coach Bob Bender. King also spent one year as a color analyst for ESPN's men's basketball coverage of the Ohio Valley Conference.\nKing then joined the Philadelphia 76ers on June 2, 1997, as vice president of basketball administration. On May 19, 1998, he was promoted to general manager, and on April 5, 2000, he signed a new contract to stay with the team for an extended term. On May 26, 2003, he was named president along with general manager.\nIn 2005, King and other individuals became prominent investors in a Foxwoods Resort Casino proposed for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In September 2008, facing massive opposition at the originally proposed waterfront location, backers for the slots casino decided to seek a new location in the Center City area, next to Philadelphia's Chinatown community. As of January 2009, the casino did not have a building permit.\nOn December 4, 2007, the 76ers replaced King with former New Jersey Nets general manager Ed Stefanski.\nOn July 14, 2010, King was hired as a general manager for the New Jersey Nets, replacing former Nets president and general manager Rod Thorn. As general manager of the Nets, King's legacy in the NBA was hurt by a series of oft-criticized trades that were deemed among the \"worst in league history\". On January 10, 2016, it was announced that the Nets had reassigned King. His position would be replaced by former NBA player and San Antonio Spurs assistant general manager Sean Marks.\nOn October 2, 2019, it was announced that King was joining the morning sport talk radio show on 94 WIP in Philadelphia.\nOn March 28, 2022, Billy King was hired by Modern Executive Solutions as a Senior Partner Head of Sports and Entertainment.\nOn February 12, 2024 Billy King joined ZRG Partners and TurnkeyZRG as a Managing Director\nPersonal life.\nKing married the former Melanie Lynn Frantz on August 27, 2005.

        "title": "Volkswagen Golf Mk5",
        "text": "The Volkswagen Golf Mk5 (codenamed \"Typ 1K\") is a compact car/small family car manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen, as the fifth generation of the Golf in three- or five-door hatchback (August 2003–2008) and a five-door station wagon (2007–2009) configurations, as well as the successor to the Golf Mk4. Using the Volkswagen Group A5 (PQ35) platform, the Mk5 debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in October 2003 and went on sale in Europe for the 2004 model year. While marketed as the Volkswagen Rabbit in the United States and Canada, the GTI model in these countries was marketed simply as the Volkswagen GTI.\nThe Golf Mk5 was replaced in 2009 by the Golf Mk6, which is built on the same platform.\nFeatures.\nDesign.\nThe Mk5 had revised suspension changes and chassis tuning and increased cargo volume, corresponding to a minor increase in size over the outgoing model. Its cargo volume is roughly greater. \nIts replacement, the Mk6, was moved forward from the previously stated 2009 in Europe to the autumn of 2008, right after its official premiere at the Paris Motor Show in September 2008.\nPowertrain.\nOptions for engines and transmissions vary from country to country, but the Golf Mk5 is available with 4-cylinder, 5-cylinder, and 6-cylinder petrol engines, and a new \"Pumpe Duse\" unit injector Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine. Transmission options include manual, automatic, Tiptronic, and Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG).\nThe Golf GTI included a 2.0-litre Turbocharged Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) engine rated at 5100–6000 rpm ( automatic) and torque at 1700–5000 rpm. Transmissions include a 6-speed manual or 6-speed DSG.\nIn September 2005, the Golf Mk5 GT was announced, which featured a choice of either 1.4 L petrol engine in twincharger (TSI) configuration, or a 2.0 litre TDI. Both are available as versions; while the diesel also is available as a variant in the UK. The diesel has of torque, which is more than the range topping R32.\nThe new Twincharger (TSI) petrol engine uses Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), along with a pair of chargers forcing the induction of the air. The chargers are a single supercharger that disengages after a specified rev-range, at which point charging of the air is handled by a single turbocharger. This system benefits from the pumping efficiency of the supercharger at lower revs and the fuel efficiency of the turbocharger at high revs. This results in more constant power delivery through the rev range, and better fuel efficiency. Both petrol and diesel versions are also available with DSG (Direct-Shift Gearbox). Performance figures for the petrol vehicle are 0- in 6.9 seconds (6 speed) and 6.9 seconds (DSG), with the diesel taking 8.2 seconds, and both reaching top speed of .\nUS and Canada.\nUnited States and Canada base specification Rabbits use the same 2.5-litre five-cylinder gasoline engine that powers the Jetta and New Beetle in these markets, making and in 2006–2007 models, and and from 2008 onward. North American transmission choices include a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic with Tiptronic for the Rabbit. Diesel engines have been unavailable on Rabbits, though they were offered through 2006 on the Jetta until tightening emissions regulations in the U.S. led to their temporary unavailability.\nVolkswagen did not market the GT version to the US or Canada, though the VR6-powered R32 range-topping model was available in the United States.\nModels.\nStation wagon.\nThe station wagon version of the Golf Mk5 debuted at the International Geneva Motor Show in March 2007 and was marketed as the Golf Variant in the German domestic market, in The United States as the Jetta SportWagen, and in Argentina and Uruguay as the Vento Variant. Designed by Murat Günak, it is more closely related to the Jetta saloon with a shared front fascia design and front doors. It was produced in Puebla, Mexico since April 2007 alongside the similar Jetta with a targeted annual production of 120,000 units.\nVolkswagen did not intend to release the station wagon/estate version of the Golf Mk5 until later in its life cycle. Initially, Volkswagen expected the Golf Plus and Touran to be able to cover the station wagon segment left by the Golf, but it was reported that dealers and customers were asking for a conventional station wagon version.\nThe station wagon version was facelifted in late 2009, with changes including the front clip and interior from the Golf Mk6, while the remaining is based on the pre-facelifted model. It was marketed as the station wagon version of the Golf Mk6 as it was sold alongside it. The facelifted model was also marketed as the Golf Wagon and Variant in the Canada and Mexico, while it continued to be sold as the Jetta SportWagen in the United States.\nJetta Mk5.\nVolkswagen marketed the three-box sedan variant of the Mk5 Golf since 2004 as the Jetta in North America and Europe, replacing the Bora name. It debuted at the Los Angeles Auto Show on 5 January 2005. It was marketed as the Volkswagen Bora in Mexico and Colombia, Volkswagen Vento in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, and Volkswagen Sagitar in China. The Mk5 Jetta shared the front fascia, front fender panel and front doors with the Golf Variant, while the GLI variant adopted Golf GTI's front end. It is the last Jetta generation to be heavily based on the Golf, since the Jetta A6 used a dedicated bodywork. In the US market, the Jetta outsells the Golf/Rabbit by a ratio of 4 to 1.\nGolf Plus.\nIn December 2004, Volkswagen announced the Golf Plus variant of the Golf Mk5. It is taller than the standard Golf, and shorter than the other compact MPV of the marque, the seven-seater Volkswagen Touran. It is sold up to 2014 when it was replaced by the Golf Sportsvan, with a refresh in December 2008. A crossover-styled version was released as the CrossGolf (Golf Plus Dune in UK) in 2006.\nPerformance models.\nGT.\nThe Golf Mk5 GT features a choice of either 1.4 L petrol engine in twincharger (TSI) configuration, a 2.0 litre TDI diesel engine or a 2.0 (FSI) direct injection petrol engine. TSI petrol and diesels are available as versions. The 125kW diesel engine has of torque, which is more than the range topping R32. The petrol engined offering contains the new TSI engine, which is based on the recent Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), but with a pair of chargers forcing the induction of the air. The chargers are a single supercharger that disengages after a specified rev-range, at which point charging of the air is handled by a single turbocharger. This system benefits from both of the efficiency of the supercharger in the lower rev ranges, with the longevity of the turbocharger higher in the rev range. This results in little turbo lag, constant power delivery along the rev range, and better fuel efficiency than similarly powered 2.4 L V6 engine due to its small size. However, the power delivery of the petrol TSI engine was criticised as being very jerky by Jeremy Clarkson.\nIn the UK the GT sport badge was marketed as offering both high power and low emissions, sparking some controversy. The diesel offers 156g/km and returns 47.9 mpg combined with the petrol equivalent offering 175g/km and 38.2 mpg respectively.\nBoth petrol and diesel versions are also available with Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG). Performance figures for the petrol vehicle are 0- in 7.9 seconds (6-speed manual) and 7.7 seconds (DSG), with the diesel taking 8.2 seconds, and both reaching top speed of .\nThe Golf GT features the same brakes as the Golf GTI, with ventilated front discs, and solid rears. It has also lowered suspension, which lowers its centre of gravity, it borrows the GTI's suspension/damper settings, uses 7Jx17\" \"ClassiXs\" alloy wheels fitted with wide 225/45 R17 tyres, and has twin exhaust outlets.\nGTI.\nThe Golf GTI features a 2.0 litre turbocharged inline 4-cylinder petrol engine with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct-injection technology, which produces 200PS (147 kW/197 bhp). It is available in both 3-door and 5-door hatchback body shapes, and comes with a choice of either 6-speed manual or a 6-speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) which greatly reduces shift time to only 8ms.\nSome Mk 5 GTIs bound for the North American Market produced in late 2008 and early 2009 came with a different engine. The EA113 engines used in the earlier years were traded for a new design in late 2008 as VW Audi Group began producing new engines for the upcoming Mk 6 GTI (among other models) which was released for sale in late 2009. Some of the Mk 5s exported to North America in these years received this new engine and were delivered to customers with the redesigned EA888 engine. This early version of the EA888 engine produced very similar horsepower and torque numbers compared to the EA113. \nThe main design changes came in the form of addressing known issues with the previous platform. A new high pressure fuel pump cam follower design that did not require periodic replacement due to wear was chief among them. Failure of this component in the EA113 design had the potential to lead to catastrophic engine failure if not replaced often enough. Further, the timing belt was replaced with a timing chain. This was done to address the reported problems with failed timing belts and tensioner assemblies that caused severe damage when not maintained properly in this interference engine design. One other notable change was the air intake and intake manifold design. The air intake was no longer integrated into the plastic engine cover and instead was routed around the right hand side near the battery. This design provided slightly reduced intake restriction and access to cooler air further from the engine. \nThe concept GTI was first shown to the public at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2003. The first production model was initially unveiled at the Mondial de l'Automobile in Paris in September 2004, and went on sale around the world shortly thereafter. At the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006, the GTI made its long-awaited North American debut in 3-door guise (a 5-door variant was eventually made available), where it is marketed solely under the 'GTI' moniker, with no reference to the Rabbit. The new GTI has a considerable price increase over the previous model, mainly due to the features mentioned above, and the fact that the exterior itself had not seen such a dramatic design change in years. The price is further raised because it is built in Germany, unlike the Mk4 some of which were built in Brazil. The innovative DSG transmission and the TFSI engine all helped raise the retail price of the car. The Mk5 GTI was named 2007 Automobile of the Year by \"Automobile Magazine\", in December 2006.\nThis generation marked the only generation in Canada to have the GTI as a separate nameplate rather than a trim of the Golf. When Volkswagen announced the revival of the Golf in the US and Canada for the 2010 model year, Volkswagen reverted the GTI nameplate as a Golf trim, although the GTI remains a separate nameplate in the United States.\nIn Mexico, it is only sold as a 3-door hatchback. A special edition of the GTI was sold in 170 copies under a \"Pirelli\" limited edition with a 230 CV engine and only in a black colour.\nR32.\nIn September 2005, the Mk5 R32 went on sale in Europe. United Kingdom sales began in November that year. It features an updated 3.2-litre VR6 engine of that fitted to the previous Mk4 version, with an extra due to a reworked inlet manifold. Maximum power is now at 6,300 rpm; torque is unchanged at . It reaches an electronically governed top speed of . Going from 0 to will take 6.5 s, reduced to 6.2 s with the Direct-Shift Gearbox.\nCompared with the previous Mk4 R32, it is 0.1 seconds faster for the manual version, while the newer R32 is about heavier. As with the previous R32; there is the Haldex Traction-based 4motion part-time four-wheel drive, now through 18\" Zolder 20-spoke alloy wheels. Stopping the R32 comes in the form of blue-painted brake calipers with discs at the front and disks at the rear.\nThe Mk5 R32 was released in the US in August 2007 with a limited production run of 5000. Each R32 has its production number laser etched on its steering wheel.\nIn Chile, the Golf Mk5 was only offered in this model, while the standard Golf model offered was the Brazilian-made Mk4.\nSpecial editions.\nGTI Edition 30.\nFollowing Volkswagen's successful 20th anniversary edition GTI (1996 in Europe, and 2003 for the North American market), and the 25th anniversary GTI (in 2001 for Europe only) models, Volkswagen marked the GTI's 30th anniversary by producing the GTI Edition 30.\nGoing on sale in November 2006 from £22,295 RRP, with an initial goal of a limited production run of only 1500 (Europe models), the Edition 30 was available in 6 colours; Tornado Red, Black, Candy White, Reflex Silver (Metallic), Steel Grey (Metallic) and finally Diamond Black (Pearl). Due to strong demand, 2280 cars were eventually built with a small number continuing into the 2009 model year. The changes over the standard production model included a different forged engine (same as Audi S3 8P has) and powered by K04 turbo that produced an extra more than the standard version, raising the output to , giving rumour that it was faster in the dry and more powerful than the R32. Slight changes to the body work included body coloured side skirts and Votex front spoiler, colour-keyed rear bumper and tinted rear lights from the R32. Changes to the interior included a return for the golf ball shaped gear knob and silver \"Edition 30\" logo'd sill plates. Edition 30 seats were also decked out in the distinctive red stitching on 'Vienna' leather and 'Interlagos' fabric mix. Red stitching was also added to the leather-covered steering wheel. Finally, dependent on the market and the options available the Edition 30 was available with 18\" BBS originated 'Pescara' alloy wheels, or black versions of the 18\" 'Monza II' alloy wheels.\nPerformance was marginally improved: with 0- coming at 6.8 seconds (6.6 seconds for DSG-equipped models), and a top speed of (manual) or (DSG).\nFahrenheit Edition.\nIn October 2006, Volkswagen debuted a new Fahrenheit Edition of their GTI and GLI models at the Playboy Mansion. These new models were the first special-edition versions of the GTI and GLI made available in North America, and the first of the new models arrived in dealers in the early March 2007.\nFahrenheit models of the GTI were distinguished by their Magma Orange paint job, special Fahrenheit badging, a commemorative plate placed on the steering wheel, body-coloured interior panels, orange stitching on the DSG boot, steering wheel, park brake handle and floor mats (from which the red GTI logo had been removed), as well as special gunmetal-colored 18\" \"Charleston\" wheels. The Fahrenheit also came with a European tuned suspension.\nThe Fahrenheit GTI was available with Volkswagen's DSG transmission or 6-speed manual. Only 1200 Fahrenheit GTI models in Magma Orange were produced for the US (150 in Canada) and 1200 GLIs in yellow (not available in Canada)(600 DSG 600 manual). US pricing started at $27,665.\nPirelli Edition.\nThis is a special edition GTI, developed by Volkswagen Individual. It was given the Edition 30 engine, instead of the in the standard Mk5 GTI. It is equipped with 225/40R18 Pirelli P-Zero tyres on titanium colored alloy wheels. It is available with a 6-speed manual or an optional DSG gearbox.\nIt features leather sport seats in \"San Remo\" microfiber with embossed Pirelli tyre tread pattern down the centre. It also has yellow stitching on the seats, steering wheel and gear shift. There is also a Pirelli logo on the head restraints. The exterior and valences are painted sunflower yellow. Other colours are also available.\nGTI W12-650.\nVolkswagen unveiled the GTI W12-650 at the GTI Festival in Wörthersee, Austria, in May 2007. It was designed as a concept car, and only one is known to exist. Unlike most concept cars, it is mechanically functional to the extent that it can be driven. Due to the rushed build time of the car (8 weeks), however, not all of its features function fully. The steering-wheel mounted paddle-shifters are not linked to the transmission, the hazard lights do not function, the stereo system doesn't work, and the heating and air-conditioning system of the car does not function due to the dashboard controls never being linked to the unit.\nThe car features a 6.0L W12 bi-turbo engine from the Bentley Continental GT delivering , of torque, 0- in 3.7 seconds, and a top speed of . The W12 differs from the standard GTI in several ways. It features 19-inch wheels that resembled the GTI's. It is lower and wider, the rear seats have been removed to accommodate the mid-engine design, and the roof is made from carbon-fibre composite, front brakes are from the Audi RS4, and rear brakes and axle are from a Lamborghini Gallardo. The W12-650 achieved a time of 1:29.6 on BBC Top Gear's \"Power Lap\" feature. Jeremy Clarkson showed that the car had some trouble with high-speed cornering but was extremely fast in the straight sections of the track.\nConcepts.\nTDI Hybrid.\nA VW Golf TDI Hybrid concept was shown at the March 2008 Geneva Motor Show. The concept vehicle shown had a three-cylinder TDI engine – probably the 1.4 litre used in the Volkswagen Polo BlueMotion – mated to a electric motor, and a seven-speed double-clutch DSG transmission. The electric power system is a Nickel-metal hydride battery in the boot, and a regenerative braking system. An \"energy monitor\" display on the dashboard keeps tabs on what the powertrain is doing, and provides both a stop/start capability and a full-electric mode at low speed. The design also includes concepts introduced via BlueMotion, with smaller grill and thinner low-resistance tyres. According to Germany's \"Auto Bild\", the car will get 69.9 mpg, and emit 90 g/km of carbon dioxide, less than the 104 g/km emitted by the Toyota Prius and 116 emitted by the Honda Civic Hybrid. The TDI Hybrid was expected to be marketed in Europe from mid-2009.\nTwin Drive.\nVW CEO Martin Winterkorn announced Volkswagen Golf Twin Drive plug-in hybrid vehicle based on Mark V Golf, which uses 2.0L turbodiesel and electric motor with lithium-ion batteries. The car could run about 50 kilometres on battery power. The combined power was .\nVolkswagen never developed the Twin Drive system for the Golf. It was planned to be developed with 8 German partners and planned a trial fleet of 20 Golfs outfitted with the system in 2010.\nThe production version was expected to be based on Mark VI Golf featuring a 1.5L turbodiesel engine and electric motor, with estimated arrival date of 2015.\nSafety.\nIn 2004, the Mk5 received a 5-star Euro NCAP rating. The 2010 edition of Monash University's \"Used Car Safety Ratings\", found that the Golf Mk5 provides an \"excellent\" (five out of five stars) level of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident.\nMotorsport.\nIn auto racing, APR Motorsport has led two MKV VW GTI's to victory in the Grand-Am KONI Sports Car Challenge and Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge Street Tuner (ST) class."

        "title": "Volkswagen Golf Mk4",
        "text": "The Volkswagen Golf Mk4 (or VW \"Type 1J\") is a compact car, the fourth generation of the Volkswagen Golf and the successor to the Volkswagen Golf Mk3. Launched in October 1997 for the 1998 model year, it was the best selling car in Europe in 2001 (though it slipped to second place, behind the Peugeot 206, in 2002).\nThe Mk4 was a deliberate attempt to take the Volkswagen Golf series further upmarket, with a high-quality interior and higher equipment levels.\nIt was replaced in late 2003 for the 2004 model year by the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 in European markets. However, manufacturing continued in South America and China for developing markets until 2014.\nDesign and engineering.\nAs with the larger Passat, launched a year earlier, the MK4 Golf helped form a part of Volkswagen's strategy of moving its products upmarket to plug a gap between mainstream economy cars and premium cars, with SEAT and Škoda, two other VW Group owned marques, poised to fill the gap below the new Golf. In fact, the quality of the Golf was comparable with the Audi A3, which was the first car based on this floor pan when it was launched a year earlier, but cost considerably more than most of its competitors.\nThis generation of the Golf brought in the Haldex 4 Wheel Drive system, which was previously only available on Audi products, the system was used with the 1.9TDI Sport Engines, i.e. PD115 (then replaced by the PD130) and the PD150 Engines, (Codes: AJM/ASZ/ARL) and with the VR6 powered models. This featured a totally revised rear axle and rear floor pan, which was shared with the Audi TT 8N. This went on to be used in the R32 model in 2003 - 2004.\nThis version of the Golf was the only version to do away with the GTD nameplate - there were Petrol and Diesel versions of the GTI, which featured slightly lowered suspension, the 1.8T or the 1.9 TDI (PD 150) and premium interior features like Climatronic, full leather, and wood trims, however it was not as sporty as the preceding generations of the GTI. As part of VW's move upmarket, the firm down played the sportiness of the hatchback in favour of comfort. The Mk4 GTI is looked down upon because of this and VW restored the GTI's reputation as a sporting hatch with the 25th Anniversary edition, and the Mk5 Golf that followed it.\nIt was also one of the very first Golfs to come with Xenon headlamps (optional) and rain sensing wipers at the end of its manufacturing in Europe, and along with this a full 12 year anti-corrosion warranty, which was rarely seen at this time.\nThe Mk4 Golf was praised for its quality improvements, but was criticised for its handling characteristics, and was compared with the Mk1 Ford Focus of the time, which had an independent rear suspension in the 2WD models, unlike the Mk4 which had a torsion beam rear axle setup in the 2WD models.\nThe Mk4 Golf platform remained to be widely used in the VW Group much after its demise in 2004 (2006 for the Bora and Variant models).\nModels.\nGolf Cabriolet.\nAs with the Mk2 Golf, Volkswagen did not make a convertible version of the Mk4 Golf. Instead, they facelifted the front bumper, fenders, hood, and headlights of the Mk3 Golf Cabrio to resemble the styling of the Mk4 Golf (colloquially referred to as the Mk3.5). Changes to the rear included a redesigned hatch, which moved the number plate tub to a restyled rear bumper, in addition to a handle and larger VW emblem more closely resembling the rear of a Mk4 Golf. VW incorporated other non-structural parts from the Mk4 as well, such as fender repeaters, grille, side mirror caps, etc. The interior remained largely similar to the Mk3 interior save for a Mk4 style three-spoke leather steering wheel and airbag, a textured dashboard (also known as \"dimpled dash\" or \"shark skin dash\"), heavily bolstered front seats with incorporated side airbags, and a chromed finish on several parts, such as the inner door handles, emergency brake button, door strikers, front seat-belt anchors, key lock cylinders, and shifter button in automatic transmission equipped cars. The instrument panel was updated with a relocated hazard light switch and blue and red backlighting, as found in the Mk4. Technical updates include the immobilizer and engine computer from the Mk4 Golf being retrofit to the older Mk3 engine mechanicals.\nVariant.\nThe Volkswagen Golf Mk4 Variant was introduced in 1999. It was discontinued in 2006, and succeeded in 2007 by the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 Variant. Unlike the Mk3, it was offered in North America with the \"Jetta\" name with corresponding front styling. The \"Jetta Wagon\" was used in North America instead of the \"Bora\" name.\nVolkswagen Bora/Jetta Mk4.\nVolkswagen produced a saloon version of the Mk4 Golf, launched around a year later. As with previous incarnations of the Golf, it had its own identity, and this time was called the Volkswagen Bora although the name Jetta remained in North America and South Africa. Unlike its predecessors, the Bora/Jetta featured unique rear doors, front wings and bonnet. The front doors were the only body panels it shared with the Golf. The interior, though, was almost identical to the Golf, featuring very minor styling changes like its predecessor.\nThe Golf 4 was produced in Germany, South Africa, Slovakia, Brazil, Belgium, and China. Eastern European locations making the Golf 4 included Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Vogošća, which also made Mk1 and Mk2 models.\nThe Golf/Jetta Mk4 engine choices included 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.3  litre VR5, 2.8  litre V6 and 3.2  litre R32 petrol engines, 1.9-litre naturally aspirated diesel SDI engine, and a 1.9-litre turbodiesel, with power ranging from 90 to 150 PS (66 to 110 kW). The R32 engine was not added to the range until much later, while the 2.3 V5 was a new addition to the Golf range. The rest of the engine line-up differed little from that of the MK3 Golf.\nVolkswagen made a choice of three and five-door hatchback or a five-door station wagon available. The European Golf wagon, launched in the spring of 1999, was nearly identical to the North American Jetta Wagon. The only difference was the use of the Golf front headlights, bumpers, grille, hood, and fenders as these parts are interchangeable between the Mk4 Golf and Bora/Jetta.\nThe Golf 4 was introduced to North America in mid-1999. Available engines for the Golf at its introduction to the American market were a 2.0 L gasoline engine, and a 48mpg 1.9 L TDI engine. In 2004 the updated 1.9L TDI PD or \"Pumpe-Düse\" engine was installed in the Golf and Jetta. The \"Pumpe-Düse\" or Pump Nozzle was a Robert Bosch extreme high pressure fuel injection system for direct cylinder injection. A 1.8 L turbocharged gas engine was introduced in 2000, along with the 12-valve 2.8 L VR6. At the same time, the 1.6 L 8-valve unit was replaced with the 16-valve unit from the Polo GTI, but detuned to 77 kW (105 PS).For 2000, Volkswagen opted for the relatively new 1.8 L 20-valve turbocharged gasoline engine as a base engine for the GTI. The top-of-the-line GLX model was equipped with Volkswagen's 2.8 L VR6, which produced . The VR6 engine, with its narrow 15-degree Vee design, was unique to Volkswagen. This engine is shorter and lighter (featuring a single cylinder head) than other V6 engines. For the 2002.5 model year Volkswagen introduced a 24-valve version of its VR6 engine to the North American market under engine code BDF. This engine had the same torque characteristics of the older 12-valve version which had been carried over from the Mk3 Golf under engine codes AAA and AFP. The 24-valve version gained an additional over the 12-valve to reach 204BHP. In Europe, the VR6-engined V6 4Motion variant was produced from 1999 with 204BHP and a 24-valve engine from the outset, using engine codes AUE and AQP. In 2002, the European market began using the BDF-code engine at the same time as the North American market. This had the same 204BHP power output but now featured variable valve timing on the exhaust valves which allowed the engine to rev more freely in the higher ranges and now had \"coil-on-plug\" ignition coils. The 1.8T and VR6 models continued until 2005, when the Mk4 platform came to an end in North America (except Canada). Both the Mk4 Golf and the Mk4 Jetta were still in production in Brazil, Mexico, and China as of 2008, it was named the Mk4.5.\nThe Mk4.5 Brazilian Golf TDI PD was sold in Canada due to its popularity as a full 2006 models in base, GL and GLS trim levels for the full model year as there were no diesel engine versions for the North American 2007 Mk5 Golf (Rabbit).\nIn Europe, trim levels were country-specific however the base trim levels were: Trendline, Comfortline, Highline and GTI, any others like the Ocean, Pacific and Edition Trim levels were modifications of the regular four trim levels.\nThe United Kingdom sold the Mk4 with the following trim levels: E, S, SE, GT TDI, GTI TDI, GTI and V5/V6/V6 4MOTION versions. The V5 was available in 150 bhp/110 kW (1997-2000) and 170 bhp/125 kW (1999-2003) versions.\nSpecial editions.\nGTI 25th Anniversary Edition (2001) / 337 Edition (2002).\nThe \"GTI 25th Anniversary Edition\" was a special version of the Golf GTI for the European market to commemorate the first GTI, launched in 1976. The 25th Anniversary edition was available in three paint colour options: Tornado Red, Reflex Silver &amp; Diamond Black.\nThe GTI 25th anniversary edition was equipped with many extra features not included in the standard GTI, which included: 18x7.5\" BBS RC wheels with a special shot peened finish, a perforated leather steering wheel, shift boot, and handbrake, red accented seat belts, red and black upholstered Recaro seats, a body kit (front valance, side skirts, hatch spoiler, and rear valance), blackened headlights, a 02M 6-speed manual transmission, larger 312mm front brakes and 256mm vented rear brakes with red painted calipers, a lowered sport tuned suspension, and brushed aluminium interior trim.\nAt the 2002 New York International Auto Show, VW announced the 25th Anniversary Edition would be sold in the US Market as the GTI 337 Edition, named for the early 1970s Golf/GTI codename. Available only in Reflex Silver, the 337 Edition was substantially the same as the European 25th Anniversary GTI, albeit without the black headlight trim.\nThese models were never equipped with a sunroof as to take the car back to its roots, the Mk1 GTI, and improve handling and performance. However, one instance of the 337 edition is known to have been special ordered with a sunroof.\nThis version of the GTI was only available in a 3-door configuration and was also available with the PD150 TDI engine, running the shortest ratio EFF 02M 6 speed manual gearbox. (Standard GTI TDI models had the PD150 engine with the ERF 02M gearbox, the mid-way point for ratio length).\nThe UK versions of the Anniversary edition were numbered with individual plaques placed on the fusebox cover.\nGTI 20th Anniversary Edition (North American Market).\nFollowing the initial commemorative anniversary edition MK3 GTI produced in Europe in 1996 celebrating the introduction of the GTI model in 1976, and the overwhelming popularity of the 25th anniversary edition GTI produced 2001, Volkswagen of America produced 4,200 \"20th Anniversary Edition\" GTIs for 2003; 4,000 were shipped to the United States and 200 to Canada. This marked the 20th anniversary of the GTI's 1983 introduction to the U.S. and Canadian market, some seven years after the GTI was introduced to the European market. Several special features distinguish the 20th Anniversary GTI from the standard GTI, most of which were shared with the 337 Edition of 2002.\nOn the outside, the 20th Anniversary edition came with throwback red-lettered GTI logos on the left front and right rear. The rear was also accompanied by a vintage-look chrome rabbit. Similar to the 25th Anniversary edition, exterior included Votex front and rear valences, side skirts, and hatch spoiler, black headlight trim, black painted wing mirrors, and 18\" OZ Aristo alloy wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport tires. These models were only produced in three colors: Imola Yellow, Jazz Blue, and Black Magic Pearl. Distribution of production was 50% Black magic pearl, 25% Jazz Blue and 25% Imola Yellow.\nInside, all 20th Anniversary GTIs included a sunroof, a black headliner, and a golf ball shift knob. The steering wheel, shifter boot, and handbrake handle were trimmed in black leather with silver stitching. Unique black cloth Recaro bucket seats with silver stitching accents and red GTI embroidery were also included. Aluminum trim came standard, and included a numbered nameplate above the radio identifying the exact production number (US production only) of the vehicle. Volkswagen's premium 8-speaker Monsoon stereo system was also standard.\nMechanically, the 20th Anniversary Edition GTI is nearly identical to the GTI 337 Edition. Including the 6-speed manual 02M transmission, 30 mm lowered suspension, and 1.8T engine. The brakes were also upgraded with 12.3\" vented rotors up front and 10.3\" vented rotors in the rear, as well as red powder-coated calipers.\nGolf R32 (2003).\nIn 2002, Volkswagen produced the Golf R32 in Europe as a 2003 model year. It was the world's first production car with a dual-clutch gearbox (DSG) — available for the German market. Due to unexpected popularity, Volkswagen decided to sell the car in the United States and Australia for the 2004 model year Volkswagen R32. \nThe R32 shared many mechanical components with the 3.2-litre Audi TT, including the DOHC 24v VR6 engine (ID codes: BFH/BML), which produced at 6,250 rpm and at 2,800 rpm. Further additions included Haldex Traction-based 4motion on-demand four-wheel drive system, a six-speed manual transmission, aluminum front control arms, independent rear suspension, and larger disc brakes with gloss blue painted calipers. Exterior changes included R32 specific bumpers and side skirts, a hatch spoiler, and 18\" OZ Aristo alloy wheels (Ronal produced the wheels towards the end of production). The interior of the R32 was equipped with Climatronic automatic climate control, sport seats from König with \"R\" logo embroidery, a sunroof (US only), Xenon Headlamps (for Europe), and more.\nFor Australia, two hundred \"Edition 200\" cars were produced, each uniquely plaqued and available in three colours: Black Magic Pearl, Deep Blue Pearl and Reflex Silver.\nFor the US, Tornado Red was an available fourth colour. The distribution of US-spec R32 colours were:\nFor the US, five thousand cars were produced and intended to be sold over a two-year period. The allotment sold out in 13 months.\nThe R32 is capable of 0- in 6.6 seconds, reduced to 6.4 seconds with the dual clutch gearbox. Clearing the quarter mile in 14.1 seconds at , the R32 edges out its third fastest sibling, the top-of-the-line Phaeton 6.0-litre W12 (414 bhp), by a tenth of a second at the (\"i.e.\" 1/4 mile) mark.\nExtended production Mk4.5.\nChina.\nIn China, the Golf Mk4 commenced production in 2003 by FAW-Volkswagen where it was sold alongside a new version of the Golf IV with FAW-VW's facelifted Bora front. It was shown at the Beijing International Automobile Exhibition in 2006 and was named as the Bora HS to complement the Bora Mk IV range and shared similar styling cues. Both the Mk4 Golf and Bora HS ended production in 2008, where they were both succeeded by the Volkswagen Golf Mk6 for the 2009 model year. The Golf came standard with the 1.6 litre engine and 1.8 litre engine for the 2005 model year. The engines were paired to a 5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic gearbox as standard. Its Bora counterpart came standard with the same 1.6 litre engine and transmission options as the Golf. In comparison to pricing and trim levels, the 2004 Golf was priced from 116,000 to 139,000 yuan ($17,680 to $21,190 US - March 2021 exchange rate) and 2 trim levels available known as Fashion and Charming. For the Bora HS, pricing ranged from 112,500 to 129,800 yuan ($17,150 to US$19,780 - March 2021 exchange rate) also with 2 trim levels known as Fashion and Luxury.\nAmericas.\nThe facelifted Golf Mk4 (nicknamed as the Mk4.5) continued to be produced in Brazil until 2013. In Argentina the range was available with a 1.6 L or 2.0 L petrol four-cylinder, a 1.8 L turbocharged petrol four-cylinder, or with a 1.9 L turbodiesel. In Chile, it was also sold until 2010, with a 1.6 to 2.0 L petrol range. All of these are Brazilian built models, although the diesels are only for export markets.\nIn Brazil, the Mk4.5 Golf has a 1.6 L engine (with Volkswagen's Total Flex system which accepts both gasoline and ethanol), or a 2.0l engine (the 1.8 turbo engine was discontinued in 2009). It is available in two trim levels: the basic Sportline model with the 1.6 engine, and the 2.0 version with a Tiptronic 6-speed transmission.\nIn 2007, Volkswagen Brazil introduced a major restyling of the fourth generation Golf. The front takes styling cues from the current Volkswagen Polo and the back of the car is inspired by the Golf 5. It is exported in most Latin America countries, since it is produced in Brazil. It was also sold in Canada, where the Mk4.5 model (City Golf) was sold alongside the Mk5 model (badged as the Rabbit). This car was not sold in the United States. The lack of diesel models for the 2007 model year led Volkswagen Canada to continue sales of an entry-level car that was designed as an alternative to the TDI models for budget-minded shoppers. The Canadian model was originally rebadged as the City Golf, but in 2009 it was renamed the Golf City alongside the Jetta City. Pricing of the Golf City started at C$15,300 as of 2008. As an entry-level alternative to the Rabbit, it offered only one engine: the 2.0L SOHC 8 valve with . It was not related to the South African Volkswagen Citi Golf, despite the similarity in name. The Mk4.5 Jetta was similarly reintroduced in Canada for the 2007 model year as the City Jetta. This was the first entry-level car from a previous-generation car since the 1992 Eagle Vista, which was a rebadged 1980s Mitsubishi Mirage. Although the Golf City was dated, its attractive price enabled good sales. The Golf City was discontinued after the 2010 model year.\nPope Benedict XVI.\nIn 1999, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, prefect of the Catholic Church's Congregation of the \"Doctrine of the Faith\" under Pope John Paul II, purchased a fourth-generation Golf in which to drive around Rome, selling it in 2005 after John Paul's death in anticipation of retiring and returning to Germany.\nInstead, he became Pope Benedict XVI. Shortly after John Paul's death, his 1999 Golf sold to a German owner for $13,000.\nThe Golf, undriven since the sale, was subsequently sold for £14,300 via eBay."

        "title": "Volkswagen Golf Mk3",
        "text": "The Volkswagen Golf Mk3 is a medium-sized compact family car. It's the third generation of the Volkswagen Golf and the successor to the Volkswagen Golf Mk2, which was produced by Volkswagen from August 1991 (for the 1992 model year) to 2002 (for Cabrio convertible).\nThe Golf Mk3 was launched in mainland Europe in August 1991, in the United Kingdom in February 1992, and in North America in the spring of 1994. The delay in North America was due to Volkswagen's decision to supply U.S. and Canadian dealerships with Mk3 Golfs (and A3 Jetta's) from the VW plant in Puebla, Mexico. Quality control problems led Volkswagen of America to reject Golfs and Jetta's from Mexico. Thereafter, labor unrest at the plant delayed production. The third-generation Golf and Jetta first launched in North America as 1993 models in the San Diego, California area and in Canada, then in the autumn in the rest of North America as 1994 models.\nThe Mk3 Cabrio replaced the Volkswagen Cabriolet. The Mk3 Cabrio continued until the 2002 model year, when Volkswagen replaced it with a convertible version of the Volkswagen New Beetle.\nLike the previous two generations, the Mk3 was supposed to be built at the TAS factory in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, when the car was first released, the Yugoslav War broke out, leading to the destruction of the factory. Due to this, TAS went bankrupt in 1995. This meant the Mk3 was the only Golf before the Mk4 not to be built in Bosnia and Herzegovina, although a single Mk3 managed to roll off the assembly line in Sarajevo, its fate unknown.\nThe Mk3 Golf was sold in Japan alongside the Polo, where both vehicles complied with the small size class regulations that encouraged sales.\nThe Volkswagen Golf Mk3 began to be replaced with the October 1997 (1998 model year) introduction of the Volkswagen Golf Mk4. In some markets, the Mk3 Golf continued to be available for the 1998 model year (Americas, South Africa), and even as early 1999 model year vehicles (Canada, Mexico, US).\nBody Styles.\nAs for previous generations, the Golf was available as a three- or five-door hatchback. For the first time an estate was produced, being launched in early 1993, and bringing it into line with key competitors such as the Ford Escort and Vauxhall/Opel Astra, which had all long been available as estates. The name of three-box sedan (now only with four doors) changed to Vento, in an attempt to improve the Jetta's stodgy image in Europe. In North America, where the Jetta had no such problems, the old nameplate remained.\nIn some markets, where the tax structure suited such a model, Volkswagen also offered a light commercial Van version of the three-door hatchback. Typically fitted with a flat plywood floor in the rear and often with blanked rear side windows, precise specifications varied for different markets to meet various local requirements for being classified as a commercial vehicle. In the United Kingdom, the Van was available only with the \"Umwelt\" (\"Environment\") engine, blanked rear windows, fabric interior, power steering, and a five-speed manual transmission. A petrol unit was available to special order. The Umwelt diesel was Volkswagen's then-new 1.9-liter turbodiesel (AAZ), fitted with a catalytic converter and producing . Payload is .\nCabriolet.\nThe Volkswagen Golf Mk3 Cabrio (or \"Type 1E\") was introduced in 1994 for the 1995 model year, replacing the previous MK1 Rabbit based Cabriolet. It was facelifted in 1998 (mid-1999 for non-euro markets) with the front, rear, and steering wheel styling inspired by the Golf Mk4 while still maintaining the body from the Mk3 Cabrio. These Cabrio's are often referred to as the Mk3.5 Cabrio's. The Volkswagen Golf Cabrio was discontinued in 2002 with a special edition called \"Last Edition\".\nPerformance models.\nGTD.\nThe Golf GTD is the diesel-powered variant of the high-performance GTI version.\nA59.\nThe cancelled Golf A59 was intended to be a 4WD model with a turbocharged 1998cc engine, carbon fiber and Kevlar shell, and a full roll cage, and have the highest performance of the Mk3 Golf models. The A59 was also supposed to be able to win the World Rally Championship in 1994. The prototype can be seen at the Volkswagen Museum.\nOverview.\nA 16-valve version of the third-generation Golf GTI was introduced in 1993. The engine was enlarged to 2.0L, with power now reaching . While lower powered than the VR6, it was still relatively popular with driving enthusiasts in Europe, because it offered ample power without the thirst or tax burden of the six-cylinder. As with previous versions, the Golf Driver acted as the official GTI-look-alike in the United Kingdom. Similar to the continental market Golf GT, it looked sporting but was fitted with a single-point injected 1.8L engine.\nThe Golf Mk3 was also the predecessor of the \"diesel craze\" that swept through Europe in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Volkswagen introduced the direct-injection system with the Golf TDI in 1993.\nFrom its launch, all versions of the Golf came with fuel injection, to meet EEC requirements that all new cars sold in member countries from January 1993 must come with fuel injection or a catalytic converter. Non-catalyzed models were also built for those markets where there was no interest in them; power outputs were the same as for the catalyzed models. An all-new 1.4 petrol engine was the entry-level model in the MK3 Golf range.\nAlso offered was a naturally aspirated version of the 1.9-liter diesel engine, the SDI, offering .\nAirbags were first offered on the Golf in 1992, and from 1996 anti-lock brakes were standard across the range.\nThe Golf Mk3 was also available in \"Ecomatic\" form. It was powered with a diesel engine and a clutch-less manual transmission. The vehicle would freewheel by opening of the clutch as soon as the accelerator is released, and the engine was switched off after a further 1.5 seconds of inactivity, whether by stopping or coasting. Restarting the engine simply required depressing the accelerator pedal. VW had previously pioneered similar technology in the VW Polo \"Formel E\" in the 1980s.\nAs had happened with the Mk1 and Mk2, the Mk3 remained available in US for a year after it was discontinued in Europe (1998). The Mk3 continued to be produced for the 1999 model year where it was sold in North and South America. These 1999 Mk3 cars were the last produced in the world and sold alongside the Mk4 in showrooms.\nGolf CitySTROMer.\nThere was also a limited production run of around 250 \"CitySTROMer\" vehicles, mainly sold to the German market, which were fully electric vehicles, incorporating six lead-acid batteries in the engine bay, and a further 10 underneath the luggage area. It had a range of approximately . The vehicle could be filled with a small amount of diesel to provide heat for the cabin.\nSpecial editions.\n20th Anniversary GTI.\nVolkswagen produced a limited quantity of 1000 special-edition 3 and 5 door GTI Anniversary models, celebrating 20 years of the GTI model. These models included the usual GTI specifications, but came equipped with special checkered Recaro front sport seats and matching rear seats bearing the GTI logo, red seat belts front and rear, half-chromed and leather golf ball gear knob, red stitched leather steering wheel and handbrake gaiter. The release knob on the hand brake was also red, and the instrument dials were silver. Floor mats also had red piping along their edges. The red theme continued externally with a red striping on the bumpers and red brake calipers. The wheels were 16\" x 7\" split rim BBS RS 722 alloys, visually similar to the 15\" that were found on VR6 model. The exhaust also featured brushed stainless-steel rear twin tailpipes, and the front fog and indicator lamps were smoked to match the rear lamps. Three optional extras were made available: electric sunroof, air conditioning and metallic black paintwork. Insurance was based on the standard GTI, making this version a very desirable model. The edition was sold in only 6 color schemes, and the 1000 number figures that were produced was as follows: 600 8 valve models, 150 16 valve models and 250 TDI models. The diesel model was only produced for the European market and was not sold in the UK. Many of the models fell into the UK company car and lease market prior to the second-hand market and it is believed only a few hundred still survive. However, another factor in the rarity of Mark 3 Golfs, unlike the excellent build quality of the Mark 2, at least in the UK, is the very low-quality steel sourced by VW on some occasions, and used across the range, from entry model to VR6. According to independent mechanics, parts specialists, and MOT testers, the floor-pan, both door sills, and rear hatch can suffer severe rot and disintegration, and anybody planning to buy one is advised to check for rot, holes and patches to the floor-pan.\nOtmar Alt.\nThe Gold Otmar Alt is a limited (1000 cars were built) edition version of the Golf. It featured various artworks from the artist Otmar Alt and a fully customized interior with the same graphics.\nRabbit.\nThe Golf 3 Rabbit Edition was exclusive to Austria, and it featured a special rabbit badge.\nCool.\nThe Golf Cool just featured a \"Cool\" sticker, like Avenue, and other minor design changes.\nCitySTROMer.\nThe Golf CitySTROMer was an alternative electric powered version of the Golf 3, which also featured colorful graphics on the side panels.\nHighline.\nAs the name suggests, the Golf Highline was the high end, premium version of the Mk3 Golf, and it shows that with a full leather interior, wood accents and a \"Highline\" sticker on the trunk.\nCoast.\nThe Golf Coast was a Cabrio-exclusive limited edition, and it featured the \"Coast\" graphic on the trunk.\nSport.\nJust like the name, it was the sporty version of the Golf 3, which also featured a \"Sport Edition\" sticker.\nClassic.\nThe Golf Classic had an overall retro look and a \"Classic Edition\" silicon badge.\nLimited.\nJust like the \"Edition\" edition of the Golf 4 Variant, it came packed with special features and the \"Limited Edition\" graphic on the inside step with a similar font.\nGTI / VR6 Edition.\nThey featured their respective body-kit, \"GTI/VR6 Edition\" badges on the side and the GTI Edition also featured a sticker on the rear quarter panel that matches the font from the seats.\nKamei.\n\"Kamei Edition\" was a limited edition made by the Wolfsburg-based aftermarket body parts manufacturer Kamei.\nIt had the full Kamei kit and a \"Kamei Edition\" badge on the grille, offset to the right side.\nRyder.\nIt featured small design changes but did not have a sunroof.\nDriver's Edition GTI VR6 (North America).\n1997 Model Year. It came in two colors Ginster Yellow and Jazz Blue. It also had red stitching on the steering wheel, special half aluminum - half leather golf ball shift knob with GTI logo, silver gauge faces, 15\" seven spoke alloy wheels made by Speedline and brake calipers painted red. Most of the extras became standard on the 1998 GTI VR6 causing some confusion as to what a Driver's Edition is. The VIN can be used to confirm if a car is a Driver's Edition or not.\nHenri Leconte.\nIt featured a leather interior with signed seats and a sticker representing 3D ball breaking the glass on the rear window.\nHenri Lloyd Yachting.\nThe GT based edition had a special front lip, rear bumper extension and a special grille, besides the rear badge.\nDriver.\nThis regular Golf 3 received the GTI body-kit, together with the \"Orlando\" alloy rims and a small trunk spoiler.\nSE.\nProduced from 1996 to 1997 for the UK market, the SE featured a GTI body-kit, all round tinted glass, clear front indicator covers, twin headlamp lenses and GTI taillights, silver instrument cluster and Sport Räder alloy wheels.\nMatch.\nThis version came pre-packed with a Sony CD player, power steering, 6 spoke rims and \"Match\" graphics (\"///Match\" written on the sides near the front wheel arch and above the guard rail, and only the three \"///\" blue, red and green lines below the right taillight.)\nMatch II.\nJust like the first \"Match\" it featured \"Match II\" graphics, but this time in the shape of a metallic badge under the \"Golf\" and \"TDI\" logos. It also featured a custom interior with a unique fabric design.\nColour Concept.\nWas a highly limited edition made in only 5 colors (Flash Red, Salsa Green, Yellow, Jazz Blue Pearl Effect and Black Magic Pearl Effect) and a few of each produced. They featured a leather interior matching the outside color (with Color Concept embossed on the front seats) and the Color Concept badge. 15-inch BBS Solitude alloy wheels were included, as were electric windows, central locking and front seat heating. The Color Concept was available on the Cabriolet and Estate (Variant) version of the Golf as well.\nFamily.\nIt was just the regular Golf MK3, but only with a custom sticker and a few other minor differences.\nHarlequin.\nThe Golf Harlequin model began with a group of four cars, each carrying a \"Design Series\" emblem, created by Volkswagen to display on the 1995 international auto show circuit.\nBasing the design on an earlier Volkswagen \"Polo Harlequin\" special edition, the Golf Harlequins were created in four variations, by taking four solid color models and interchanging the easily detachable doors, hood, hatch, grill, fenders and bumper facias — after final production at the Puebla, Mexico assembly plant where all the Harlequins were manufactured.\nThe interchangement of colors — Tornado Red, Ginster Yellow, Chagall Blue, and Pistachio Green — was not random, but followed four defined assignments, with each pattern avoiding adjacent major panels sharing the same paint color.\nChagall Blue, and Pistachio Green were otherwise unavailable as a Golf paint color choice in North America.\nThe resulting Harlequins were designated by their \"base\" color, the paint color of the welded panels comprising the core body — including the substructure, roof and C-pillar.\nFollowing a positive response to the original four Harlequins, Volkswagen marketed an additional 60 — followed by another 200.\nIn a series of follow up letters to various entities at Volkswagen, the total number of Harlequins is reported variously from 275 to 264, all offered solely for model year 1996, in the United States, Canada, and Mexico — with most marketed in the United States.\nEach Harlequin Golf featured a gray/black interior highlighting the four body colors. The special edition was available for an additional $150 over their stock counterparts.\nTREK / K2 Editions.\nIn 1997, a marketing effort with TREK on the Jetta Mk3 was expanded to include the Golf Mk3. The TREK edition came with a roof bike carrier, a 21-speed purple TREK-Volkswagen branded mountain bike, and a TREK 'Limited Edition' badge.\nAlso in 1997, the other special edition, The K2, came with a ski/snowboard roof carrier, a K2 \"Limited Edition\" badge, and either a pair of K2 El Camino skis, or a K2 Juju snowboard.\nBoth TREK and K2 editions also included special Recaro manufactured seats, 14” alloy wheels, tinted taillights, special “TREK” or “K2” shift knobs, optional moonroof, roof-mounted antenna, and fog lights.\nWolfsburg Edition.\nA Wolfsburg Edition was produced alongside other Mk3 \"Wolfsburg Edition\" Jetta's in the United States. Like the Wolfsburg Edition Jetta, Mk3 Golfs with the Wolfsburg package came standard with an improved white/tan dual-tone interior, smoked tail-lamps, premium alloy wheels, remote entry, power windows/mirrors, and a tilt/slide sunroof. The Wolfsburg Edition was only available with the VW 8-valve SOHC 2.0L engine.\nDuring the 1990s, Volkswagen sponsored three high-profile rock bands' European tours, and issued a special-edition Golf, with distinctive exterior markings, for each: the Golf Pink Floyd Edition (1994), the Golf Rolling Stones Edition (1995), and the Golf Bon Jovi Edition (1996).\nEuropean Car of the Year.\nThe Golf MK3 was voted European Car of the Year for 1992 - the first Volkswagen to win this award."

        "text": "The Volkswagen Golf Mk2 is a hatchback, the second generation of the Volkswagen Golf and the successor to the Volkswagen Golf Mk1. It was Volkswagen's highest volume seller from 1983 and ended in (German) production in late 1992, to be replaced by the Volkswagen Golf Mk3. The Mk2 was larger than the Mk1; its wheelbase grew slightly (+ ), as did exterior dimensions (length + , width + , height + ). Weight was up accordingly by about . Exterior design, developed in-house by VW design director Schäfer, kept the general lines of its Giugiaro-designed predecessor, but was slightly more rounded. All told, about 6.3 million second-generation Golfs were built.\nGolf Mark 2.\nThe second-generation Volkswagen Golf (also known as the \"Typ 19E\" until the 1991 model year, and \"Typ 1G\" thereafter) was launched in Europe at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1983, with sales beginning in its homeland and most other left-hand drive markets soon after. It debuted in March 1984 on the right-hand drive British market, and it was introduced as a 1985 model in the United States. It featured a larger bodyshell, and a wider range of engine options, including a GTD turbodiesel (in Euro markets, later using the 1.6 \"umwelt\" (ECO) diesel engine), a DOHC 1781 cc (1.8) 16-valve version of the straight-four GTI (as well as the tried and tested 1781cc (1.8) 8v GTI), the supercharged 8v \"G60\" with front- and four-wheel drive options, and a racing homologated variant of this, the \"Rallye Golf\". This model was intended to be sold in the United States as well (badged as \"Rallye GTI\"), and prototypes were made, but it did not come to be.\nThe original Golf had been one of the few front-wheel drive hatchbacks on sale when launched in 1974, but within a decade almost all mainstream manufacturers had launched a Golf-like family hatchback. Ford had switched to front-wheel drive hatchback format for its MK3 Escort in 1980, soon after General Motors had adapted that concept for its latest Opel Kadett (Vauxhall Astra in Britain). Austin Rover (formerly British Leyland) did not enter the small family hatchback market until the launch of its Maestro at the beginning of 1983, although it had launched its larger Maxi hatchback as long ago as 1969 and in 1976 had taken the then unusual step of launching a hatchback bodystyle on a luxury car (the Rover SD1). Peugeot would not launch its first Golf-sized hatchback (the 309) until late 1985, but it had taken ownership of Chrysler's European division (which it renamed Talbot) in 1978, just after the launch of the Chrysler/Simca Horizon hatchback. However, the likes of Fiat, Renault and Volvo had all entered the small family hatchback market by the end of the 1970s. The hatchback bodystyle had also become popular on cars produced outside Europe, particularly on Japanese models.\nIn 1985, British motoring magazine \"What Car?\" awarded the Golf Mk2 1985 \"Car of the Year\", even though it had actually been launched on the UK market early in the previous year. It sold well in Britain, peaking at more than 50,000 sales a year by the end of the decade.\nHowever, the Golf was overshadowed in the 1984 European Car of the Year contest, finishing third but being heavily outscored by the victorious Fiat Uno and runner-up Peugeot 205, which were similar in size to Volkswagen's smaller Polo.\nDuring the life of the Golf MK2, there were a number of external style revisions. Notable changes to the looks of the Golf MK2 included the removal of quarterlight windows in the front doors, and the introduction of larger grille slats with the August 1987 facelift. The most notable was the introduction of so-called \"Big Bumpers\", which were introduced in the European market with an August 1989 facelift. They were available in the United States from August 1989 as well, as part of the \"Wolfsburg Edition\" package. They were not standardized until January 1990.\nThis Golf was marketed for the first time with that name in the United States and Canada. The Rabbit name used on the Mk1 was meant to give a car a cuddly image, but with the 1980s redesign of the car, Carl Hahn, the former Volkswagen of America president who was now chairman of the whole company, dictated that Volkswagen model names be standardized globally. James Fuller, head of the Volkswagen brand in North America, concurred in using the Golf name to stress the car's Teutonic character. The GTI body kit became available on a non-injection Golf and was sold as the \"Driver\" trim level in Europe. While the GTI remained a trim level in the Golf lineup in Europe, in some markets, it was (and continues to be) marketed as a separate model line.\nThe MK2 Golf remained in production until the launch of the MK3 model in August 1991. Continental sales began that autumn, but the MK3 did not take over from the MK2 on the right-hand drive British market until February 1992.\nModels.\nThe Golf Mk2 was available as a 3- and 5-door hatchback. The 2-door and 4-door sedan variants of the Golf Mk2 were marketed under the Volkswagen Jetta name. No cabriolet version was developed from the Mk2; instead, the Mk1-based convertible continued to be produced, with minor changes.\nTrim levels included base, C, CL and GL and initially a range-topping Carat model (until 1986), later a GT (in 1987) version was also on offer. In North America, there was only a base model until 1986, in 1987 a GL and GT model, in 1988–1989, there were all three, and in 1990 until the end of its run there was again only a GL. The GTI model existed from 1985 to 1987, and again from 1990 to 1992, and the GTI 16v existed from 1987 to 1992. In Japan the range consisted of catalysed Ci/CLi/GLi models all sharing the same 1.6 or later 1.8 liter fuel-injected inline-four engines. In the course of the years, a host of \"limited edition\" models appeared on various markets, distinguished by cosmetic changes and/or an enriched features list. Generally, these were option packages on top of a base \"model\" (CL, GL, etc.). Also in some countries it could be found trim level TX (Austria) and JX (Yugoslavia).\nThe base engine was initially the 1.3 option as used in the first generation Golf, accompanied by 1.6- and 1.8-litre petrol fours and 1.6-litre naturally aspirated or turbocharged diesel engines. In January 1984 a new base engine was introduced, a 1.05 litre inline-four mainly available in Italy and Greece. In North America, all Golf Mk2s had 1.8-liter petrol or 1.6 diesel engines (the GTI, while not a Golf model in North America, also had a 2.0-liter model).\nThe MK2 was the last version of the Golf to feature carburettor petrol engines, as all versions of the MK3 came with fuel injection from its launch, to meet requirements that all new cars sold in the EEC after 1992 must be fitted with a catalytic converter or fuel injection.\nGolf GTI &amp; GTI 16v.\nThe successful Golf GTI (or, in the US, simply \"GTI\") was continued with the Mk2 as a sporty 3- or 5-door hatchback. Like late Mk1 GTIs, it featured a naturally aspirated Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injected 1781 cc inline-four engine developing . In 1986 (1987 for North America) a Golf GTI 16V was introduced; here the 1.8 litre engine output was at 6,100 rpm (or for the catalyst version) and at 4,600 rpm of torque, the model was marked by discreet red-and-black \"16V\" badges front and rear. North American-market GTIs were later equipped with 2.0-liter, 16-valve engines, only available in the Passat and Corrado outside North America. In 1990, like the Golf, the GTI was given a facelift, and the \"Big Bumper\" became standard on all GTIs. This was maintained through the rest of the Mk2 model era. In 1990 the GTi G60 was also introduced featuring the 8v 1.8 with a G60 supercharger this version is not to be confused with the very rare G60 Limited (see below).\nFor the South African market, Volkswagen SA added a 2.0 8v engine in January 1992, the same engine which would go on to be used in the Mk3 model launched later that year.\nGolf Syncro.\nIn February 1986, Volkswagen presented the first Golf with four-wheel drive. This Golf Syncro was available as a five-door with the 1.8 engine only, later with . Its 4WD system had been developed in collaboration with Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria, and featured a viscous coupling and flexible partition of torque between front and rear axle - up to 48% to the rear. Due to its high price (in 1986, a Syncro cost about 30% more than an equivalent front wheel drive model) the model remained rare; from 1986 to 1989, for instance, just 16,000 Syncros were built. Fewer than 1,000 were sold on the UK market.\nThe four-wheel-drive system was fully automatic and minimally intrusive, also in appearance. Aside from a few discreet \"Syncro\" badges there was no way to tell. There were no additional gauges or buttons in the interior either. The gearing was lowered somewhat, to mask the performance losses due to the additional . The rear seat was moved forward , and the cargo floor was raised, making the luggage compartment 25 percent smaller than in a regular Golf.\nRallye Golf.\nIn 1989, the Rallye Golf appeared as a rallye \"homologation special\" for Group A rallying. Distinguishable by its box-flared wheel arches and rectangular projector headlamps, this model featured Syncro four-wheel drive, a cable shifted transmission and a G-supercharger 1763 cc, marginally less than the standard 1781 cc to enable the car to enter in the sub 3-litre class for Group A rallying.\nFive thousand cars were built in Volkswagen's Brussels, Belgium, plant, priced at about DM 50,000 each (or roughly twice as much as a base Golf GTI). The Rallye Golf has .\nNone were officially sold in the US. Two were sent over officially for testing, with five sent over for evaluation. Volkswagen of America vice-president James Fuller was a supporter of its addition to the U.S./Canadian lineup. Fuller died in December 1988 while flying home from Germany aboard Pan Am Flight 103, when a bomb planted by Libyan terrorists exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland; this had a detrimental effect on the Rallye Golf's chances of importation to North America.\nEventually, Volkswagen of America decided that the Rallye Golf would be too expensive to offer for sale in North America, where Volkswagen was perceived as a low-cost brand.\nWRC success was limited, the best position being a 5th place on the 1990 Tour De Course Rally.\nGolf Limited.\nBased on the Rallye Golf, a very limited edition Golf Mk2 variant exists, combining all of the high-line options (such as leather interior with heated and height adjustable front seats, 4 electric windows, electric mirrors, ABS, power steering and sunroof) available at the time. Designed and hand-built by the Volkswagen Motorsport division, only 71 of the \"Golf G60 Limited\" models were produced.\nThe exclusive feature package included a G60 supercharged version of the 16-valve engine, mated to a sports transmission and Syncro four-wheel drive mechanism driving BBS RM012 wheels in 6.5Jx15\". The cars were mainly built around the stronger, more angular 5-door chassis, with two 3-door models also produced. Externally, it featured US bumpers, a plain black grille with unique blue detail with VW Motorsport and black VW badging, Hella tinted taillights, motorsport badges, and a special numbered plaque. In 1989, these cars cost in the region of DM 68,500 each and were primarily sold to VAG executives and management. These cars produce and accelerated from 0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 6.4 seconds, making them the most powerful VW Golf ever produced until VW released the Mk4 R32 with in 2003.\nGolf Country.\nThere was also a version called Golf Country (7,735 cars built), co-manufactured by Steyr-Daimler-Puch in Austria, designed for medium off-road driving. It had more suspension travel, Syncro four-wheel drive, improved ground clearance of , bullbars at front and rear (generally over a single headlight grille), a skid plate for protecting the engine area, sub-frame to protect the rear Syncro differential and propshaft and a spare wheel mounted externally on a swing-away triangular frame on the back.\nIn Europe, it was offered with the acclaimed 1.8 8v 1P petrol engine. There were also: 1500 \"Country Allround\" designed to appeal to a wider public, made without the electric luxuries like electric and heated mirrors, leather steering wheel and bullbar without headlight grills, in relation to a more affordable price range; 558 \" Country - Chrompaket\" with Chrome bullbars, Sliding sun roof, Engine and interior pre-heater and beige leather interior; and 50 \"Country GTI\" 1.8 GTI petrol engine, made only for Golf Country project VW-staff. The Golf Country was particularly popular in Alpine regions in central Europe.\nThe Golf Country's powertrain was also used in the Biagini Passo, a compact convertible crossover built in Italy.\nGolf Mk2 citySTROMer.\nIn 1984 Volkswagen, in cooperation with RWE, released the second generation \"'Golf citySTROMer\", an electric version of the Mk2 Golf. It was the first electric Volkswagen to enter serial production as the Mk1 citySTROMer was only a prototype vehicle. The Mk2 citySTROMer had a range of approximately and used 16 gel-electrolyte batteries mounted under the cargo area and rear seats. Just 100 Mk2 citySTROMers were produced and sold for 45,000DM (~US$34,000) until production ceased in 1985. The citySTROMer name was continued in later models; the Jetta citySTROMer and the Mk3 Golf citySTROMer.\nNorth America.\nAs with the North American Rabbit, the second-generation Golf was produced for North America in Pennsylvania. When sales in North America failed to live up to expectations and with increasing productions costs, the Westmoreland Assembly Plant was closed in July 1988. Subsequent Golfs sold in North America came from the Puebla assembly plant, in Mexico. The Mk2 Golf was discontinued in Europe in 1991, but Mexican-made Mk2 models remained available in North America for another year.\nIn its first years on sale in North America, 1985 and 1986, the Golf II maintained sealed-beam square headlights, while the GTI bore flush headlights (from the Jetta). All Golfs gained the flush \"aerolamps\" in 1987 after a design freshening to move it more upscale in the wake of the introduction of the Brazilian-built Fox (Voyage in Brazil) in North America. This is also the reasoning for the model being called \"Golf GL\", while virtually no equipment changes occurred. The 1985 U.S. models are easy to distinguish from subsequent models due to the absence of a high-mounted brake light; these became required of all cars sold in the U.S. for 1986.\nThe GTI was \"Motor Trend\" magazine's Car of the Year for 1985, as well as VWVortex's \"Best Golf of all time\".\nIn its first year on sale in the U.S., Golf sales were eight percent below those of the 1984 Rabbit. Sales of the all-new 1985 Jetta, by contrast, skyrocketed compared with the 1984 model. In 1986, the Jetta became VW's bestseller in North America, a position it has held ever since.\nAs with the Mk1, there was a \"warm hatch\" version known as the Golf GT. Introduced in 1987, it featured the GTI's exterior styling, namely the red stripe exterior trim, and wheel-arch spoilers but with a standard 1.8 L engine, available in an automatic and with 5 doors (unlike the GTI). It only lasted for a few years, but with the reintroduction of the GTI in 1989 (the GTI 16v was produced continuously from 1987 to 1992), this model bore the concept. Year by year, the GTI with the 8 valve engine lost its GTI-like features, getting standard Golf brakes in 1990, suspension in 1991, losing the MFA computer, and finally being optional with an automatic, a first in GTI history. All GTI models got the European quad-headlight grille with the upgrade to big bumpers in 1990.\nA 2.0 L engine producing replaced the 1.8 in 1990 - 1992 North American 16V models. This version included 15\" 2pc BBS RM wheels. In the interior, the Recaro seats no longer had vinyl bolsters of earlier GTIs.\nMexico (1987-1992).\nThe Golf Mk2 was introduced in Mexico in March 1987 to replace the successful Caribe (Golf Mk1). It was available with two variants of the 1.8-litre engine: A , and the previously used in the Caribe GT, the Atlantic GLS, and the Corsar. It came in C, CL and GL trims, with a 4-speed manual gearbox for the lesser engine (C and CL), and a 5-speed manual or optional 3-speed automatic for the more powerful Golf GL. Tires for the C and CL were 155 SR 13, and P 175/70 R 13 for the GL. In 1988 the Golf received the same modifications as in Europe, but for the nameplates (which changed for 1989). In 1989 a GTI version was introduced with a \"Digifant\" fuel injected variant of the 1.8-liter engine with no catalytic converter.\nIn early 1992, the MkII Golf was replaced by the MkIII.\nOther markets.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, all models were sold with fuel injected and catalyzed engines as the CLI and GLI, with the GTI model also available. Sales were bolstered due to the Golf's compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations. In 1982, the Golf was joined by the Polo in Japan which was also in compliance.\nUnited Kingdom.\nSales in the UK were strong; though it never quite made the top 10 for sales in any of the eight years in sale, it came close. In 1990, it was the UK's 12th most popular car with almost 50,000 sales. As of 2012, over 20 years after the Mk2 Golf's demise, it is still a very common sight on British roads and is being recognized by many as a growing classic.\nYugoslavia.\nVolkswagen also produced the Mk2 Golf in Yugoslavia, in a factory at Vogošća near Sarajevo, called Tvornica Automobila Sarajevo (TAS). Following on from the production of the Mk1 Golf at the factory, the Mk2 was produced from June 5, 1985, with a yearly production of 25,000 units, and plans had been made to start production of the Mk3 Golf amid the Bosnian War in 1992, however the factory was destroyed by bombing that year. The Mk2 Golf was produced by TAS only for the six Yugoslav republics, with a rear badge J, JX (which stands for less equipment than C and CL), C and CL and TAS badge on the front grille and Sarajevo city logo instead side blinkers. Such models were usually very poorly equipped, with the passenger-side rear-view mirrors being optional equipment which had to be paid for. Engines were 1.3 (carburettor), 1.6 petrol and 1.6 diesel."

        "title": "Volkswagen Golf Mk1",
        "text": "The Volkswagen Golf Mk1 is the first generation of a small family car manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen. It was noteworthy for signalling Volkswagen's shift of its major car lines from rear-wheel drive and rear-mounted air-cooled engines to front-wheel drive with front-mounted, water-cooled engines that were often transversely-mounted.\nSuccessor to Volkswagen's Beetle, the first generation Golf debuted in Europe in May 1974 with styling by Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign.\nHistory.\nReplacing the Beetle; early efforts.\nVolkswagen began producing prototypes of possible Beetle replacements as far back as the early 1950s, and may have received design proposals from Porsche earlier than that. All of the internal projects' names started with \"EA\", standing for \"Entwicklungsauftrag\" and meaning \"Development assignment\". This work began during the tenure of Heinz Nordhoff, who was Director General of Volkswagen from 1948 to 1968.\nIn 1952 the company built the EA41 in collaboration with Pininfarina. Essentially a rebodied Beetle, it never went into production.\nThe first EA47 prototype appeared in 1953; at least 11 more EA47 variations were built over the next three years.\nBy the mid- to late-1950s, questions about the future of the Beetle began to be asked from outside the company. In 1957, an article with the title \"Is the Volkswagen dated?\" appeared in the West German magazine \"Stern\". Two years later, a similar headline was used in an article in \"Der Spiegel\" weekly news.\nIn 1958 Porsche began a project numbered 728 for a revised Beetle. A few years later this became the Volkswagen EA53. This project continued for a number of years and produced several prototypes, with early ones having bodywork designed by Porsche and later ones styled by Ghia. The EA53 eventually led to the Type 3 model.\nIn 1957 another design study, the EA97, was started. This exercise was larger than the Beetle, but kept the usual rear-mounted powertrain. Two hundred instances of this design were built. Styling varied, depending on whether a particular car's bodywork was done by VW or by Ghia. Some cars’ looks echo the later Type 3 cars, although the EA97 was smaller. The last EA97 was built in 1960. The EA97 would provide the basis for the Brasília model from Volkswagen do Brasil.\nThe EA158 was a Beetle-successor project that started in 1962 with a unibody study by Pininfarina. As the project progressed the car grew in size and weight. Eventually it was rejected as a Beetle replacement, but served as the foundation of the subsequent Volkswagen Type 4 model.\nIn 1967 another set of prototypes for possible Beetle replacements appeared in the form of the EA235 and EA235a.\nIn 1968 the last internal prototype for a Beetle replacement built under Nordhoff's direction appeared. This car, designated EA276, was a small three-door hatchback with front-wheel drive using a front-mounted Volkswagen air-cooled engine. The EA276 program was cancelled after the death of Nordhoff, but did find new life as the inspiration for the Brazilian Gol.\nDuring Nordhoff's time VW did broaden its product line with the launch of the Volkswagen Type 3 in 1961 and the Volkswagen Type 4 in 1968. In 1964 the company acquired control of the Auto Union group from Daimler-Benz and with it the technologies of the constituent companies of DKW, Horch, Audi and Wanderer.\nCorporate changes and later prototypes.\nKurt Lotz succeeded Nordhoff as Director General of Volkswagen from 1968 to 1971. Work to broaden the product line and find a replacement for the Beetle accelerated. Under Lotz Volkswagen acquired control of NSU in 1969. NSU was subsequently merged into the Auto Union group. One outcome of this acquisition was that the mid-sized front-wheel drive car that had been under development at NSU would reach the market, not as an NSU, but as the Volkswagen K70.\nIn 1968 another development project started named EA266. This project originated with Porsche, where it began as an internal project as early as 1966. This unusual design used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout with a water-cooled inline four cylinder engine laid over on its side and mounted longitudinally under the floor of the rear of the passenger compartment.\nIn 1969, one year after the start of work at Volkswagen on the EA266, another project named EA337 was commissioned. This project would draw on engines and front-wheel drive technology from the Audi division of Auto Union.\nEntering difficult times.\nIn 1966 Volkswagen built almost 1.5 million automobiles and reported net profits of DM 300,000,000. By 1967 domestic sales had fallen to 370,000 units from a high of 600,000 units in 1965. A government-backed economic stimulus package was able to produce a rebound in sales. Beetle exports to the United States went from 232,550 in 1963 to 423,008 in 1968.\nLocal competitors Ford of Europe and Opel launched new small car models targeted directly at Volkswagen's traditional market. Volkswagen's share of the German domestic car market dropped from 45% in 1960 to 26% in 1972.\nProfits fell from a high of DM 330,000,000 in 1969 to DM 12,000,000 in 1971, mainly due to slumping Beetle sales and high R&amp;D costs.\nIn 1971 the United States' government ended international convertibility of the US dollar to gold in what is termed the Nixon shock. One outcome of this was that the Deutsche Mark rose 40% against the US dollar in 1971. This, combined with a 10% import duty on cars entering the US, caused Beetle sales to plummet in what had become a critical market for Volkswagen. In 1973 the OPEC oil crisis hit, triggering a global recession. The German government responded with emergency measures banning private car use on certain days of the week and comprehensive speed limits.\nIn 1972 Opel's share of the German market rose to 20.4%, making them Germany's largest automobile manufacturer and overtaking Volkswagen in their domestic market.\nIn 1972 the Center for Auto Safety published \"Small—on safety: the designed-in dangers of the Volkswagen\", which examined the safety deficiencies of the Beetle just as Ralph Nader's earlier book \"Unsafe at Any Speed\" had done for the Chevrolet Corvair.\nAll of the foregoing combined to result in Volkswagen posting a DM 807,000,000 loss in 1974. In the same year Volkswagen of America alone posted a DM 200,000,000 loss.\nRudolf Leiding replaced Lotz as Director General of Volkswagen from 1971 to 1975. Commenting on the situation at Volkswagen as he found it, Leiding said: \"The global situation for VW was more critical than we had once thought – to put it simply, we were dealing with the survival of a giant group, which employed more than 220,000 people worldwide ...\"\nTwo weeks after assuming the directorship, Leiding stopped work on the Porsche-designed EA266 and ordered all but two of the 50 prototypes built to that point to be destroyed.\nIn 1969 Lotz and Italian Volkswagen importer Gerhard R. Gumpert visited the Turin Auto Show. After selecting their six favourite cars of the show, they discovered that four of the six were designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and his Italdesign studio.\nGiugiaro was invited to Wolfsburg in January 1970 to work on development project EA337. The first thing he saw when he arrived at VW's research centre was a Fiat 128, completely disassembled and labelled. The design brief provided by Volkswagen specified a C-segment car with a two-box body in three- and five-door versions. The client also provided Giugiaro with the basic dimensions and the power-train options.\nGiugiaro produced a design that reflected his signature \"origami\" or \"folded-paper\" style, emphasizing sharp corners and flat planes. Giugiaro would come to consider the Mk1 Golf the most important design of his career. Early prototypes included rectangular headlamps and wide tail-lamp assemblies. At least one pre-production car was modified with a sliding side door.\nDuring development, candidates for the name of the new car included \"Blizzard\" and \"Caribe\", but these lost out to the final choice of \"Golf\". The origin of the name is variously attributed to the game of golf, the Gulf Stream current (German \"Golfstrom\") or the name of a horse.\nModel history.\nThe Golf Mk1 received VW model designation \"Type 17\". Production started in March 1974, and sales officially began in May 1974. By this time Giugiaro's rectangular headlamps and wide tail-lamps had given way to round headlamps and much narrower rear lamps. On these earliest cars the lower horizontal bodyline running under the tail-lamps on the rear hatch dropped down in the location of the rear license plate. This feature has been dubbed \"Swallowtail\" by some Golf enthusiasts. The surface between the raised sides on the bonnet on early cars also blended smoothly into the leading edge.\nThe Golf was not the first example of Giugiaro's work for Volkswagen to reach production. His design for the first generation Passat was released in 1973, and the first generation Scirocco, a Giugiaro design prepared concurrently with the Golf, was released months ahead of the Golf.\nFrom October 2, 1974 to January 14, 1975 two Golf Mk1s were driven over from Fairbanks, Alaska to Tierra del Fuego as a test of their durability.\nThe right-hand drive Golf went on sale in Britain in October 1974. For the 1975 sales year it was the 14th best selling car in Britain with more than 19,000 units sold. In 1981 the facelifted Golf GTI was voted \"Car of the Year\" by \"What Car?\" magazine, ahead of all-new models like the Austin Metro and MK3 Ford Escort. In its final sales year of 1983 it sold more than 25,000 units and was Britain's 14th best selling car despite being almost 10 years old.\nAir conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975. The ability to retrofit the system, together with installing a larger battery, was offered to owners of existing cars.\nIn December 1975 a minor styling revision deleted the Swallowtail line on the rear hatch, replacing it with a simple straight horizontal body-line. The bonnet also received a transverse line connecting the two raised sides across the front edge of the panel.\nThe Golf was introduced to Japan in 1975, where it was imported by the Yanase dealership chain. Its exterior dimensions and engine displacement were in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations, which helped sales.\nThe Golf Mk1 was runner-up for European Car of the Year in 1975, losing to the Citroën CX.\nA minor exterior revision in December 1978 replaced the narrow front and rear bumpers with moulded units that wrapped around the sides of the car. Another minor facelift in 1980 saw the adoption of wider rear lamp clusters and a new dashboard with a more modern-looking instrument display featuring LED warning lights. US versions also received rectangular headlights. This was the last major update before the MK1 was replaced by the MK2 Golf in most markets in September 1983 and in the British market in March 1984.\nThe Golf was West Germany's best selling new car for much of its production life, and was among the most successful cars in the whole of Europe during its nine-year production run.\nFeatures.\nThe Golf adopted an efficient \"two-box\" layout with a steep hatchback rather than a formal trunk. The chassis was a steel unibody.\nThe car's engine was mounted transversely in the front, and drove the front wheels. Engines from two Audi engine families were offered. Both were water cooled inline four cylinder four-stroke engines. Both also had two valves per cylinder operated by a single-overhead camshaft driven by a timing belt. The early engines used 2 barrel Zenith carburetors. The 1.1 L and 1.3 L engines were from the original EA111 line. In this engine the valves were operated by rocker arms. The EA111 was mounted with a 20° forward tilt. The 1.5 L, 1.6 L and 1.8 L engines were from the EA827 family. In this engine the valves were operated by bucket tappets. The EA827s were mounted tilted 15° rearwards.\nThe car was originally available with two transmission options; a four-speed manual and a three-speed automatic. A five-speed manual became available in 1979.\nThe front suspension was made up of MacPherson struts and helical coil springs with lower wishbones and an anti-roll bar. The rear was semi-independent with dual trailing arms connected by a twist-beam rear suspension and coil springs over telescopic shock absorbers.\nSteering was by rack-and-pinion.\nFront brakes were disks with solid rotors. In the rear were drums.\nThe car's tires varied with the power-train, with 145SR13 on the 1.1, and 155SR13s on the 1.3 and 1.5. Tires on the GTIs were larger, using 175/70 profile 13-inch tires.\nMk1 derivative models.\nGolf GTI.\nDue to the negative political reaction to the 1973 release of the Beetle \"Gelb-Schwarzer Renner\" (\"GSR\", or \"Yellow-Black Racer\"), Volkswagen had little inclination to develop a faster Golf.\nVW Press Department head Anton Konrad and VW engineer Alfons Löwenberg began development of a high-performance \"Sport Golf\" as a skunkworks project rather than as an official factory program. The two were joined by Gunter Kühl from the Press department, suspension expert Herbert Schuster, Hermann Hablitzel, who smuggled parts from the project into regular tests, Jürgen Adler, whose chassis analysis led to additional reinforcements, Horst-Dieter Schwittlinsky from the marketing department who coined the \"GTI\" acronym, and Franz Hauk, developer of the EA827 engine.\nA prototype was built based on a Scirocco, rather than a Golf. This proof-of-concept had an EA827 engine with dual carburetors and a lowered and stiffened suspension. When this prototype was driven by Volkswagen's Chief of Research Ernst Fiala, he objected to the harsh suspension and excessive noise from the intake system and declared the car \"undriveable\".\nThe ad hoc development team arranged to use the fuel-injected version of the EA827 engine that had been developed for the new Audi 80 GTE. That engine's Bosch K-Jetronic system reduced intake noise and raised power output.\nThe car's name is typically described as an acronym of either the Italian phrase \"Gran Turismo Iniezione\", or the English \"Grand Tourer Injection\", and is usually written in all capitals.\nThe GTI was presented to Volkswagen's management early in 1975, and the project was approved 28 May 1975.\nAt this point a ninth person joined the original eight-member GTI team. Working under Chief designer Herbert Schäfer, Gunhild Liljequist was tasked with creating a set of features that would set the GTI's interior apart from the normal Golf. Her contributions included the bright Tartan plaid upholstery, and the dimpled golf ball-like gearshift knob.\nThe Golf GTI debuted in March 1975 at the Frankfurt Motor Show, and wasn't unveiled until the autumn of 1976.\nProduction was not expected to exceed 5000 units, which was the number needed to qualify for the Group One Production Touring Car class.\nIn addition to the modifications already mentioned, the GTI was distinguished from the stock Golf by external changes that included black-plastic wheel arch extensions to cover the 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels fitted, a larger front spoiler, a matte-black frame around the backlite and a red frame for the grille. Ride height was reduced by , and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with ventilated discs. Anti-roll bars were also fitted front and rear.\nThe engine in the early GTIs had a bore x stroke of that displaced . The compression ratio had been raised to 9.5:1. This resulted in an engine that produced at 6,100 rpm and at 5,000 rpm. This was mated to a close-ratio 4-speed manual transmission.\nWith a curb weight of , the GTI could accelerate from in 9.2 seconds. Top speed was .\nIn August 1979 a 5-speed manual transmission became standard.\nIn 1982 the engine's bore and stroke were enlarged to 81 and 86.4 millimetres respectively, which resulted in a total displacement of . Compression had also been increased to 10.0:1. Power rose to at 5,800 rpm, and torque to at 3,500 rpm.\nThe GTI appeared on the British market in 1977 as a special order only in left-hand drive form. A factory right-hand drive version finally became available in July 1979, priced at £4705. The Rabbit GTI did not arrive in the United States until the 1983 model year.\nThe 1976 Volkswagen Golf GTI is considered by many to be the archetypal \"hot hatch\", a class of sporty small cars popular in the 1970s and early 1980s, although cars of a generally similar concept, such as the 1967 Simca 1100 Ti and the 1971 Autobianchi A112 Abarth had appeared earlier.\nTotal production of Golf Mk1 GTIs eventually reached 462,000 units. In 2004, \"Sports Car International\" declared the Golf Mk1 GTI to be the 3rd best car of the 1980s.\nGTI special editions.\nPrior to the release of the 1.8 L GTI, a special edition called the Golf GTI 16 S Oettinger was available in France and Switzerland. GTIs were shipped from Germany to the Oettinger factory where they received, among other modifications, a 16-valve double-overhead cam cylinder head. The resulting engine developed .\nAfter the GTI was upgraded to 1.8 litres, special factory editions of the model were sold under different names in several European countries. These were distinguished externally by a quad-lamp front grille, tinted glass, factory sliding sunroof and Pirelli P 6Jx14 alloy wheels. The interior featured a leather-wrapped steering wheel, internal mirror adjusters and the MFA trip computer system.\nThe names of these editions, by country were:\nTwo additional special editions of the GTI were available in France and Norway. One was called the Golf GTI Rabbit. This model was a GTI with some normally standard equipment deleted, making it less expensive than the regular GTI.\nGolf Diesel.\nA Golf powered by a normally aspirated diesel engine first appeared in September 1976. Equipping a compact car with a heavier, noisier and less powerful diesel engine was unusual in Germany at the time, with Peugeot among the few competitors offering a comparable model. The 1.5 litre Golf Diesel, which used fuel at the rate of , was one of the most fuel-efficient compact cars of the 1970s.\nThe diesel engine was derived from the existing EA827 Audi petrol engine. To withstand the higher stresses imposed by the diesel conversion, many engine components, including the cooling system, crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons and piston pins, cylinder head and timing belt, were reinforced or otherwise redesigned. Swirl chambers were added to the cylinder head. In the place previously occupied by the ignition distributor was a vacuum pump for the brake booster. The diesel injection pump was driven by the camshaft drive belt. The diesel engine was no larger than the 1.5-litre gasoline engine.\nEarly diesel engines had a displacement of 1.5 liters and developed the same as the 1.3 litre petrol engine. Later engines displaced 1.6 liters and produced . The noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) characteristics of the early diesels were still unsatisfactory. When the turbocharged diesel engine appeared the turbo not only boosted the power output but dampened engine noise as well.\nRabbit Pickup/VW Caddy.\nA Golf-derived utility model with a pickup truck style rear bed was developed for the American market. This Mk1 variant was called the Rabbit Pickup in the US, and entered production in 1978 at the Westmoreland plant. An almost identical version for Europe called the VW Caddy went into production in 1983 at the Tvornica Automobila Sarajevo (TAS) plant in Vogošća near Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. Approximately 200,000 units were produced at this location until the factory was destroyed in 1992 during the Bosnian War.\nJetta.\nIn August 1979 a sedan version of the Golf called the Jetta was introduced. Essentially a Golf Mk1 with a trunk grafted on, this three-box sedan body style was offered in two- and four-door versions and was targeted at more conservative buyers. In North America the Jetta was a sales success, but sales numbers in Europe lagged behind expectations.\nIn 1980 Karmann produced a prototype of a convertible Jetta based on the 2-door body. Sales of the Jetta sedan did not justify putting the convertible into production.\nGolf Cabriolet.\nA convertible version of the Golf was presented to Volkswagen's management by coachbuilder Wilhelm Karmann GmbH as early as 1976. This early prototype lacked the roll-over bar of the later version, and had a flat body line in the rear, where the soft top folded down below the sill level.\nIntroduced in 1979, the production version of the convertible Golf was designated \"Type 155\". In Europe, it was called the Golf Cabriolet, while in the United States and Canada it was sold as the Rabbit Convertible up through the 1984 model year. As the Rabbit was replaced by the Golf II in the United States and Canada, the Mark 1 Cabriolet was renamed simply \"Volkswagen Cabriolet\" (without either the Golf or Rabbit nameplate) from the 1985 model year on. Beginning in 1988, Canadian models were badged as Golf Cabriolet. The Golf I Cabriolet received a reinforced body, a transverse roll-over bar, and a high level of trim. From stamping to final assembly, the Mk1 Cabriolet was built entirely at the Karmann factory. Volkswagen supplied engines, suspension, and interior trim for Karmann to install. The tops, of vinyl or cloth, were heavily insulated, with a heated glass rear window. The top was raised and lowered manually until 1991, when an electric option was offered. Production continued until April 1993; the last cars were sold after the introduction of the MkIII Cabrio. In the United States, these were sold as the Cabriolet Classic (some as 1994 models), while in Europe they were called Golf Cabriolet Classicline.\nThe body of the Cabriolet did not change through the entire production run except for a larger fuel tank. It kept the pre-1980 Golf style of rear lamp lenses. A full-size spare tire was fitted from 1979-1984; a space-saver spare tire was fitted from mid-year 1984 onward, coinciding with the installation of a larger fuel tank. All Cabriolets from 1988 onward left the factory fitted with a \"Clipper\" body kit that featured smooth body-coloured bumpers, wheel-arch extensions, and side skirts.\nPrior to the 1984 model year, the highest standard specification in Europe for the Cabriolet was the GLI, which was essentially a GTI in all but name. It was only in late 1983, with the introduction of the 1984 models, that an officially badged GTI version of the Cabriolet finally became available in the UK (the GLI continued in mainland Europe).\nCabriolet special editions.\nSpecial editions of the Cabriolet included the Etienne Aigner, Carat, CC, Wolfsburg Edition, Quartett, Acapulco, Havanna, Toscana, White Edition, Fashionline, Classicline, Azur, Bel-Air, Genesis, Sportline, Boutique, Youngline, and Best Seller models.\nGolf GTD.\nPresented at the March 1982 Geneva Motor Show, the Golf GTD combined performance and economy. The car's appearance package and suspension were based on the Mk1 Golf GTI. The engine was a version of the 827 model diesel, with power boosted by a forced induction system. To increase the performance of the 1.6-liter naturally aspirated diesel, the GTD was equipped with a Garrett turbocharger with a maximum boost of , which raised power output to and maximum torque to at 2600 rpm from the and at 2300 rpm of the naturally aspirated engine. To make this power increase possible, more than 30 changes to the base engine were made, including increased oil circulation, a more efficient oil pump and reinforced or higher quality components such as head gasket and cylinder head. Due to the increased thermal load on the pistons, they were cooled from below by means of oil jets, and the engine was equipped with an oil-to-water heat exchanger on the flange of the oil filter element. The turbocharger was mounted between the engine and the firewall.\nThe turbo engine weighed about more than the naturally aspirated diesel, and once all the accessories were factored in weight grew by . Average fuel consumption of less than was possible, as long as the driver endeavored not to use the turbo.\nRegional variations.\nVolkswagen Caribe (Mexico, 1977–1987).\nIn May 1977, the Mk1 Golf was launched in Mexico as the Volkswagen Caribe. It came standard with a 4-speed manual transaxle and a 1.6 litre carbureted engine. The car was an instant success. At first only the 5-door body was offered, but in 1978, the lineup expanded with the 3-door body. Two initial trim levels were offered: \"Base\" and \"L\", with the \"GL\" trim level added in 1979. \nThe 1980 Caribe lineup remained essentially unchanged except for a slightly restyled front grille with squared type headlamps.\nIn 1981 an improved Caribe was offered to the Mexican market, with looks matching the recently face-lifted North American-spec Mk1 Golf: the Volkswagen Rabbit. New features included revised bumpers, new taillights and a new front grille design. A diesel engine became an option that year.\nIn 1983, the Caribe range got an improved dashboard designed for the 1980 European Golf. Trim levels were also updated, with the previous \"Base\" entry-level rebadged as the \"Caribe C\", the \"GL\" level unchanged, and the mid-level \"L\" trim level being dropped.\nIn 1984, inspired by the worldwide success of the Mk1 Golf GTI, VW Mexico produced its own \"hot\" derivative: the Caribe GT. This version featured an 1.8 L engine with dual-carburetor fuel delivery system, rather than the electronic fuel injection of the GTIs.\nClose to the end of the model production, VW Mexico offered, through 1986 and 1987, three special Caribe versions: \"City\", \"Pro\" and \"Plus\":\nThe \"Caribe City\" was primarily based on the entry-level Caribe \"C\". It was offered only in Pearl Gray or Turquoise Blue paintwork and featured a distinctive \"City\" badge. The \"Caribe Pro\" was a somewhat downgraded version of the GTI-like Caribe GT. The \"Pro\" retained the sporty feel of the GT and was offered only with a 3-door body, with two paint choices: Tornado Red or Black. \"PRO\" label graphics were attached to the lower doors and the hatch. The \"Caribe Plus\" was the last special edition in the range. The \"Plus\" had GL level trim, and was offered only in Alpine White paintwork for the body colour and much of the trim, including the front grille and the bumpers (which were of the plastic-molded type sported by European Mk1 Golfs since 1980). The interior's upholstery and carpets were also Alpine White in this edition.\nAfter 10 years of success, 1987 was the last production year for the Mexican Mk1 Golf-based Volkswagen Caribe series. The \"Plus\" special version could be considered the \"Last Edition\" Caribe, since it had a short production run before the discontinuation of the model lineup in March 1987, when the whole Caribe range was dropped in favor of the production and introduction in Mexico of the Golf MkII.\nVolkswagen Rabbit/Golf (U.S.A./Canada).\nThe Golf Mk1 was first introduced to the United States in 1975, but in that market the car was called the Volkswagen Rabbit. These early US Rabbits were produced in Germany and exported to North America.\nIn 1978 Volkswagen began building the Rabbit at its Westmoreland plant. Former Chevrolet engineer James McLernon was chosen to run the factory, which was built to lower the cost of the Rabbit in North America by producing it locally. McLernon moved to \"Americanize\" the Golf/Rabbit (Volkswagen executive Werner Schmidt referred to the act as \"Malibuing\" the car) by softening the suspension and using cheaper materials for the interior. VW purists in America and company executives in Germany were displeased. For the 1983 model year the Pennsylvania plant went back to using stiffer shocks and suspension with higher-quality interior trim.\nRabbit Diesels arrived in mid-1977 and were originally German-built. During 1980, production was shifted to the Pennsylvania plant, with the most obvious change being a switch from round to square headlamps. The color schemes also changed; period testers noted a lower quality of materials being used, although fit and finish was as high as on German-made cars. The US-market 1.5-liter diesel had a claimed at 5,000 rpm. This model was short-lived, with 1981 Rabbits receiving a facelift with wraparound turn signals and larger taillights, while the diesel engine was changed to a 1588 cc unit. The plant also began producing the GTI for the North American market in the fall of 1982, for the 1983 model year. 'Rabbits' were built in Pennsylvania until 1984. The first Volkswagen Caddy pick-up, based on the Mk1 Golf, was also created at the Pennsylvania plant.\nCanada continued to import the German-made Rabbit until the 1981 model year when Volkswagen Canada began to import the US-made version.\nThe original U.S.-spec Golf saw use in a taxi fleet. The Yellow Cab Company of Lexington, Kentucky, bought eleven Rabbits in the late seventies as part of an effort to save money on fuel, estimating an annual savings of $135,000 in gasoline costs. Two other companies considered using the Rabbit as the basis for a taxicab. The Checker Motors Corporation and the Wayne Corporation both built prototype taxis using Rabbits with much longer wheelbases than factory. Checker built one prototype and Wayne built three, but neither project went into production.\nFor 1981 the gasoline powered Rabbit received a fuel injected engine, an iteration used only in North America, which offered . The carburetted versions were discontinued.\nThe Volkswagen Rabbit GTI, the North American version of the high-performance Golf GTI, debuted in Canada in 1979 and the United States for 1983. Assembled from parts made in Mexico, Canada, Germany and the U.S. in Volkswagen's Westmoreland assembly plant, it had the same Mk1 chassis, and the same A1 body type as the Mk1 Golf GTI that had been on sale in Europe since 1976, with a few exceptions. Key distinct features of the Rabbit GTI were its squared front end styling, and its alloy \"snowflake\" wheels. The interior came in red or blue felt and leatherette trim. The squared styling of the front end, particularly the wraparound direction indicator lights, gave it added safety and slight improvement in performance. Under the hood, the engine was a JH 1.8 litre four-cylinder gasoline engine that ran on unleaded fuel, In addition to being marginally larger than the regular engine it also had lightened pistons, bigger valves, a higher compression, and a free-flow exhaust as well as other minor improvements. The JH 1.8 L would peak in stock condition at , delivered through a close-ratio five-speed manual transmission. For 1984 the Rabbit GTI was back, now with an updated engine offering . In total, 30,000 of these 1.8 L Rabbit GTIs were built in Pennsylvania.\nWhen the Rabbit GTI first appeared in Canada, it featured the 78 hp 1.5 L (1979) and 1.6 L (1980) K-Jetronic engine and wide ratio five-speed transmission. It was initially available in red, white, and black. These Canadian cars were German-built and were nearly identical in body shell and interior appearance to the Golfs built in Europe. Unfortunately for enthusiasts, the entire drive-line and running gear was identical to the other Canadian versions. Five-MPH bumpers were fitted as well as anti-intrusion bars within the doors. The towing eye integral to the front of the European car was deleted as the crash-worthy bumper's shock absorbers had towing facilities as part of their design and the car had been crash-tested for Canada with the North American front apron. The car was very attractive but drove no better or worse than a Rabbit of the same era. Only with the arrival of the American GTI was a faster Golf available in Canada, and it was down compared to the 1.8 L Golf GTI Mk1. A small number of European specification GTIs made it to Canada under an agreement with the government that allowed foreign soldiers training at Canadian military facilities to bring their personal vehicles with them. As a result of this, VW made available (for many years) all unique European model parts required through VW of Canada. It was thus possible, although expensive, to build a \"real\" GTI. Some enthusiasts did so based on the reputation of the European car.\nVolkswagen CitiGolf (South Africa, 1984–2009).\nFrom 1984 to 2009, Volkswagen of South Africa manufactured two variants of the Mk1 Golf; the five-door Citi Golf and the Volkswagen Caddy. Earlier, the original Golf Mk1 had been manufactured with petrol or diesel engines.\nTo celebrate the continued success of the Mk1 based Citi Golf in South Africa, on 22 September 2006 Volkswagen SA announced the limited edition Citi R powered by a 90 kW (120 hp/123 PS) 1.8L fuel injected engine with a five-speed manual transmission as well as a GTI trademark red outlined front grill.\nThe 2007 VW South Africa Citi Golf range starts with a standard Citi Golf, in either 1.4 or 1.6 litre fuel injected models. Variations of the standard version with different options packages included the Citi Rhythm, Citi.com and others. The range topper is the CitiRox, also available in 1.4i and 1.6i, made as sportier versions of the standard Citi to replace the previous sports version, Velociti and Citi Life. The later Citi Golfs feature modern amenities such as a new dashboard adapted from a Škoda Fabia, and minor body \"facelifts\" such as revised tail-light clusters.\nThe 2009 VW South Africa Citi Golf range consisted of four new models:\nProduction of the Citi Golf ended on 2 November 2009 after 377,484 cars had been built. The final 1000 vehicles manufactured were a special edition Citi Mk1 with a 1.6i engine. The colors available for the Citi Mk1 were \"Shadow Blue\" and \"Black Magic Pearl\".\nExperimental versions and specials.\nVolkswagen.\nVolkswagen used the Golf Mk1 as the basis of several experimental cars of their own. These included:\nArtz/Nordstadt.\nGünter Artz was director of the Hannover Volkswagen dealer Autohaus Nordstadt. Artz and Nordstadt produced several specials that were either based on or had the appearance of the Golf Mk1 or its derivative models.\nSbarro.\nSwiss fabricator Sbarro built several cars with the look of a Golf Mk1 but with greater performance. These included the following models:\nRinspeed.\nIn 1979, Rinspeed released their Golf Turbo 1, and, in 1981, they unveiled the Aliporta, a modified Golf Mk1 with gull-wing doors.\nACM.\nIn Italy the ACM company built a vehicle called the \"Biagini Passo\" from 1990 to 1993. This crossover-like car started with a Mk1 Cabriolet body and mounted the engine, transmission and Syncro four-wheel-drive system from the MkII Golf Country using a custom subframe. Approximately 65 were built.\nMotorsports.\nIn the late 1970s, the Mk1 Golf GTI was campaigned in a variety of international rallying events, taking wins at Sweden (1978, 1982, 1983), Monte Carlo (1980), Great Britain (1983), and Portugal (1984).\nIn 1981, drivers Alfons Stock and Paul Schmuck won the German Rally Championship in a Golf GTI Mk1. The bright green Golf, sponsored by Rheila, was nicknamed the \"Rheila Frosch\" (Rheila Frog). In its final iteration it was powered by a Oettinger 16-valve engine."

        "text": "Samuel James \"Sugar Jim\" Henry (October 23, 1920 — January 21, 2004) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. A goaltender, Henry played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the New York Rangers, Chicago Black Hawks and the Boston Bruins between 1941 and 1955.\nEarly life.\nHenry was born on October 23, 1920, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada to mother Essie Henry. Growing up, he earned the nickname \"Sugar\" as the neighbours would dip his pacifier into sugar. During the 1930s, he played for the Brandon Elks in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League and led them to the Turnbull Cup. Following this, Henry joined the Regina Rangers of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League where he led them to the 1941 Allen Cup. During the tournament, Henry gained the attention of Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers.\nPlaying career.\nUpon winning the 1941 Allen Cup, Henry started his NHL career with the New York Rangers. During his first NHL season, he led the New York Rangers to a first-place but they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1942 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Despite this, Henry's 29 wins during the season led all goaltenders around the league and set a new franchise record. Following his rookie season, World War II broke out and he joined the Ottawa Commandos and Red Deer Army. In 1942, while with the Commandos, Henry helped them sweep the competition and win another Allen Cup. He also played with the Red Deer A-16 Army team and was voted the most valuable player in the league. In 1945, Henry was discharged from the army and returned to the National Hockey League.\nWhen the 1945–46 NHL season started, Henry alternated goaltending duties with Chuck Rayner. However, Rayner eventually took over starting duties and Henry was re-assigned to the New Haven Ramblers of the American Hockey League (AHL) in January 1946. Following this, he spent numerous seasons alternating between the NHL and AHL. During the 1947–48 season, Henry returned to his original starting position with the Rangers after Rayner suffered a compound fracture of his right cheekbone. Within his first 25 games as the starting goaltender, Henry earned 12 wins, seven losses, and six ties.\nDuring the 1952 postseason, Henry recorded a playoff shutout in the semifinal round versus Montreal. At the end of Game #7 of that same series, Henry, sporting a black eye, was photographed shaking hands with Maurice Richard who was bandaged and bloodied. It has been considered one of the iconic NHL photographs.\nIn 2004, Henry was inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Israel Tennis Centers",
        "text": "Israel Tennis Centers (\"ITC\"; Hebrew: המרכז לטניס בישראל) is the largest social service agency for children in Israel, serving more than a half million children and their families since its first center opened in Ramat Hasharon in 1976. With 16 centers across Israel, primarily in underprivileged communities, the not-for-profit Centers use tennis to promote the social, physical, and psychological well being of their students (through other programs such as their Life Skills program). Another of its goals is the development of coaches (such as Oded Yaakov), and building and maintaining courts and facilities at the highest levels.\nThe ITC is the physical home of the Israel Children's Centers, Israel's largest social service agency for children. The Israel Children's Centers serve 10,000 children every week through a variety of programs that address development and social needs, including coexistence programs for Arab and Jewish children and customized programs for a variety of disabilities.\nThe ITC has to date produced the following top-30 players: Andy Ram (career-high doubles ranking of No. 5); Yoni Erlich (doubles ranking of No. 5); Shahar Pe'er (doubles ranking of No. 14 and singles ranking of No. 11); Anna Smashnova (singles ranking of No. 15); Amos Mansdorf (singles ranking of No. 18); Shlomo Glickstein (singles ranking of No. 22 in 1982; No. 28 in doubles); Dudi Sela (singles ranking of No. 29 in 2009), and Harel Levy (singles ranking of No. 30 in 2001).\nHistory.\nIn 1974, at a time when tennis in Israel was a sport played primarily by tourists as beach hotels, Dr. Ian Froman, Freddie Krivine, Joseph D. Shane, Harold Landesberg, Rubin Josephs, and Dr. William H. Lippy began fundraising efforts to launch tennis as a sport in Israel and to build a National Tennis Center on an old strawberry patch in Ramat HaSharon given to the ITC by the government. On April 25, 1976, Leah Rabin cut the ribbon to the Center, and 250 children signed up to participate. Canadian pioneers of the Centers included Joseph Frieberg, Gerry Goldberg, Ralph Halbert, and Harold Green. Their fundraising efforts laid the financial foundation for Canada Stadium, where the Davis Cup and Fed Cup were hosted in Israel until 2009, and the construction and maintenance of the centers, as well as provision of equipment to the children, were funded without any government assistance.\nBy 2008, about 350,000 Jewish, Christian, and Moslem Israeli children had gone through the seven complexes funded by the ITC, and 1951 Wimbledon champion Dick Savitt was overseeing the coaching techniques. Anna Smashnova moved to Israel with her family in 1990, aged 15, and trained at the ITC; the next year she won the French Open girls title, and in 2002 she reached a career-high ranking of No. 15. In 1991 the ATP donated $5,000 to the ITC, and Argentine tennis player Martín Jaite, who is Jewish, donated $3,000. In 1995, Israeli former Davis Cup player and national champion Gilad Bloom, who was world champion in the under-12 age group, became senior coach role with the ITC.\nThirty years after the centers were begun, in 2006 the first ITC product won a Wimbledon title, as Andy Ram won the 2006 Wimbledon Mixed Doubles title. He had learned his tennis at the ITC's Jerusalem Tennis Center, and Yoni Erlich, his men's doubles partner, had learned his tennis at the Haifa Tennis Center. \"I can only find words of esteem for the Israel Tennis Center for their support and help\", Ram said after his success.\nIn 2007, Issy Kramer, Honorary President of the Israel Water Polo Association (IWPA), indicated that he would like to replicate what the ITC has achieved, by building centers throughout Israel, particularly in poorer neighborhoods and development towns. \"Swimming, like tennis, should not have to be an elitist sport\", he said."

For the first time, the event was sponsored by Coral who continued to sponsor the UK Championship until 1985.\nThe most dramatic match came in the qualifying rounds when Terry Griffiths, a newly turned professional, was beaten 8–9 by Rex Williams after leading 8–2. The main stage of the championship also provided plenty of surprises. Patsy Fagan, the defending UK champion, went out 7–9 in the first round to David Taylor who, after a decade in the professional ranks, reached his first major final by beating Alex Higgins 9–5 in the semi-finals. In the other half of the draw, Roy Andrewartha beat John Spencer 9–8 and Willie Thorne beat Ray Reardon 9–6 only to collapse 1–9 against Graham Miles, whose 139 break set a tournament record. In the semi-finals it was Miles' turn to collapse 1–9 to Doug Mountjoy who, keeping his best until last, clinched his final victory over Taylor with a break of 120. The BBC televised the final on their \"Grandstand\" programme with Ted Lowe commentating the match.\nQualifying.\nLast 24 Best of 17 frames\n David Taylor 9–2 Maurice Parkin \n John Virgo 9–4 Ray Edmonds \n John Dunning 9–3 David Greaves \n Jim Meadowcroft 9–5 Jackie Rea \n Doug Mountjoy 9–5 John Barrie \n Roy Andrewartha 9–3 Pat Houlihan \n Rex Williams 9–8 Terry Griffiths \n Willie Thorne 9–4 Bernard Bennett "

        "text": "The 92nd Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday May 25, 2008. Scott Dixon of New Zealand won the race from the pole position.\nIt was the thirteenth Indy 500 sanctioned by the Indy Racing League, and served as the showcase event of the 2008 IndyCar Series in DIRECTV HD season. It was the fifth round of the 2008 IndyCar Series season. It was the first Indy 500 after the open wheel \"unification\" took place, and it featured a full complement of entries of IndyCar Series regulars, as well as former Champ Car teams.\nIt was the first Indy 500 where all entries utilized the Dallara IR-05 chassis after Phil Giebler failed to qualify with Panoz chassis - effectively ushering in a four-year \"spec\" era. In addition, all full-time entries began utilizing semi-automatic paddle shifters in 2008. Paddle shifters for part-time Indy 500-only entries were optional due to cost reasons.\nIndyCar Series practice began May 4. Time trials took place over the two weekends prior to the race (May 10–11 and May 17–18). The final practice was held Friday May 23.\nEntertainment.\nJulianne Hough, who partnered with two-time Indy 500 winner Hélio Castroneves to win \"Dancing with the Stars\", sang the national anthem. Jim Nabors returned to sing \"Back Home Again in Indiana\" after an illness prevented him from doing so in 2007. 1992 Winter Olympics women's figure skating gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi, the season six winner of \"Dancing with the Stars\", served as the honorary starter and wave the green flag.\nStone Temple Pilots performed during the annual Carb Day Concert. Other bands performing during the month included Healing Sixes, DJ Orion, Chevelle, Ludo, Yellowcard, The Bravery, Psychodots, Forever the Sickest Kids, OK Go, Sum 41, Jon McLaughlin, and Jack's Mannequin.\nStarting grid.\nFailed to qualify\nRace summary.\nStart.\nAt 1:03 p.m., Mari Hulman George gave the command to start engines. All cars except Sarah Fisher pulled away, but Fisher quickly caught up to the field. Emerson Fittipaldi was booed during the parade laps due to his incident where he drank orange juice instead of milk after winning in 1993. He pulled the pace car off the track after the third pace lap, and a well-aligned field took the green flag. Polesitter Scott Dixon took the lead into turn one, and led the first two laps. His teammate Dan Wheldon took the lead on lap three. On the 8th lap, Bruno Junqueira lost a mirror, and the first of many caution periods slowed the field.\nFirst half.\nNearly the entire field pitted on the first caution, with Buddy Rice staying out to lead. Sarah Fisher also stayed out, and moved to third. Moments later, she spun in the north chute while warming her tires, and lost 3 laps. When the green resumed, Dan Wheldon quickly regained the lead. He held it until lap 36, when Dixon passed him. At the same time, rookie Graham Rahal drifted high and hit the wall exiting turn four.\nMarty Roth and Jaime Camara each brought out the yellow in the first half, suffering single-car crashes. Wheldon and Dixon continued to trade the lead.\nOn lap 94, Tony Kanaan charged into the lead. He set a new all-time record by leading a lap in seven consecutive Indy 500 races. He broke Rick Mears' record of six straight races led (1979–1984). His continuing bad luck at Indy returned however 11 laps later. Scott Dixon took the lead back on lap 105. Marco Andretti, Kanaan's AGR teammate, dove low in turn three to overtake, which was followed by Kanaan going high and into the marbles. Kanaan lost control of his car, brushing the wall, then collecting the lapped car of Sarah Fisher. Both cars were heavily damaged. The caution was then extended when Jeff Simmons car suddenly veered and hit the inside wall on the frontstretch.\nSecond half.\nMarco Andretti gained the lead on lap 122. Dixon ran second, while Wheldon began to slip deep in the standings with handling problems. Justin Wilson brought out the yellow in turn 2 on lap 133 with yet another single-car crash. His crash was followed 20 laps later by Alex Lloyd, who brushed the wall in turn 4, and spun wildly into the pit area. Tomas Scheckter, who had been running amongst the leaders all afternoon, dropped out with a broken driveshaft.\nOn the lap 159 restart, Vítor Meira went three-wide and stormed into the lead. With Dixon second and Andretti third, the stage was set to decide the race between those three drivers. Other contenders, Hélio Castroneves, Ed Carpenter, Danica Patrick, Ryan Briscoe, Oriol Servia and rookie Ryan Hunter-Reay, were battling for the balance of the top ten.\nPatrick/Briscoe pit incident.\nOn lap 169, Milka Duno dove below Buddy Lazier in turn three. The two cars touched slightly, and Duno spun to the warm-up lane. She suffered a flat tire, but was able to continue. The leaders all headed to the pits on lap 171 for what would be the final sequence of pit stops. At pit exit, Ryan Briscoe swung wide and clipped the right rear of Danica Patrick's car. Patrick spun around, and Briscoe hit the pit wall. Both cars were eliminated. Patrick climbed out of the car, and started walking down towards the Team Penske pits, presumably to confront Briscoe. A security guard intervened, and she later walked back to her pit stall. Patrick and Briscoe were called to the Indycar hauler after the race. Patrick and Briscoe were fined $100,000 and were placed on probation until the end of the 2008 season for an aggressive pit incident.\nFinish.\nWith 24 laps to go, Scott Dixon led the field back to green. Vítor Meira ran second, and Marco Andretti third. The race went green the remainder of the distance, and Dixon held on by 1.7498 seconds to win his first Indianapolis 500. He became the 19th pole winner to win the race, and the first winner from New Zealand.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe race was televised in high definition in the United States on ABC, the 44th consecutive year on that network. Time trials were shown live in high definition on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 at various timeslots and was available via broadband at MediaZone.com.\n1998 Indianapolis 500 winner Eddie Cheever joined the announcing crew for the first time. For the first time, two hours of pre-race was aired, one hour on ESPN2, followed by one hour on ABC. For the third year in a row, the telecast utilized the Side-by-Side format for commercial breaks.\nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the IMS Radio Network for the 56th consecutive year. Mike King served as anchor. For the second year in a row, Davey Hamilton offered live in-car reporting during caution periods. Chris Economaki offered pre-race and post-race commentary for the final time. This was also the last time that former 'voice' of the 500 Bob Jenkins served as a turn announcer. \nFor the fourth year in a row, Kevin Olson conducted his annual pre-race interview with David Letterman."

        "title": "2009 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 93rd Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday May 24, 2009. It was the 14th Indy 500 sanctioned by the Indy Racing League, and the premier event of the 2009 IndyCar Series season.\nHélio Castroneves, a native of Brazil, won the race from the pole position, his third of four Indy 500 victories. He became the first foreign-born three-time winner of the race, and tied a record by winning the race three times in the same decade (2001, 2002, 2009). The win was car owner Roger Penske's 15th Indy 500 triumph, extending his team's own record. Former winner Dan Wheldon of England came second, with Danica Patrick third, the best finish ever by a female driver. There were eight crashes, with Vítor Meira and Tony Kanaan both suffering non-permanent injuries.\nThe 2009 Indianapolis 500 began a three-year Centennial Era celebration which marks the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 2011 marked the 100th anniversary of the first Indy 500.\nThe victory by Castroneves marked the milestone 60th Indianapolis 500 victory for Firestone. It came less than two months after Castroneves was acquitted of federal charges of tax evasion and conspiracy. The IRS filed the charges against Castroneves in the fall of 2008, and the trial was held in March 2009 at the U.S. District Court in Miami. A guilty verdict in the trial would have likely sent Castroneves to prison, and ended his driving career.\nEntry list.\n\"See Team and Driver Chart for more information\"\nThe official entry list was released April 20. The initial list includes 77 cars for 40 entries. 32 driver–car combinations have already been announced, as of Monday, May 4. Among the participants include five former winners (Lazier, Castroneves, Wheldon, Franchitti, Dixon), and six rookies.\nPaul Tracy, the runner-up of the controversial 2002 race, returned for the first time since that race, and Scott Sharp also returns. However, this would mark the final IndyCar Series race for the 1996 Indy Racing League co-champion. \nTime trials – Weekend 2.\nSunday May 17 – Bump day.\nShortly before midnight on May 17, Conquest Racing announced that Alex Tagliani, who had failed to qualify, would replace Bruno Junqueira in the No. 36 car. Because of the replacement, the car was moved to the last spot in the starting grid.\nCarb Day.\nIndyCar Series final practice.\nThe final hour-long practice was held.\nPit Stop Contest.\nTeam Penske won the 32nd annual pit stop contest, their record tenth overall victory in the event. The teams of Hélio Castroneves and Marco Andretti met in the finals with Castroneves and his chief mechanic Rick Rinaman winning the $40,000 first prize after a 7.962-second pit stop.\nQualification round.\nNote: Positions 5–8 are eliminated from the competition. Positions 3–4 advance to the quarterfinals. Positions 1–2 received a bye for the quarterfinals, and advanced directly to the semi-finals. Ryan Briscoe and Graham Rahal were randomly selected to bypass the qualifying round and advance directly to the quarterfinals.\nStarting grid.\nFailed to qualify\nRace.\nThe green flag was waved off on the first attempt after Hélio Castroneves hit the accelerator in the middle of turn four and the field did not maintain its traditional three-row lineup. The second attempt, although similar in formation, was given the green flag.\nDuring the first lap entering the first short chute, Mario Moraes squeezed Marco Andretti into the wall, crashing both drivers out. Both drivers were out, but Andretti returned briefly later in the race. Moraes held the view that Andretti ran into him, and both drivers expressed their frustration to the TV crews. Andretti said that Moraes is \"clueless\", while Moraes believed that Andretti checked down on him.\nRyan Hunter-Reay also had a crash on lap 20 which saw his car slide into the pit lane. This capped a brutal month of May for the Vision Racing driver, in which his car never seemed to get up to speed, and he barely even made the 500 field.\nGraham Rahal and Davey Hamilton had similar crashes on laps 56 and 83 respectively. Both slowed their cars between turns 3 and 4, drifted up the track, and hit the wall on the front straightaway. Rahal had a similar crash in the 2008 race.\nOn lap 98, while running third Tony Kanaan suffered a driveshaft failure while at speed in the back stretch, pitching his car into the wall. Kanaan's steering was largely incapacitated and the Brazilian bounced off the backstretch wall and then hit the turn 3 wall. In television interviews, Kanaan appeared visibly shaken. The next day, Tony stated the hit was recorded at 175 G's.\nDuring the first half of the 200-lap event, Scott Dixon, Castroneves and Dario Franchitti swapped the lead with the Dixon–Franchitti Target Chip Ganassi team leading much of the laps. Dixon led laps 91 through 141, with Franchitti close behind to protect him.\nDrivers Robert Doornbos, Nelson Philippe, and Justin Wilson, all former Champ Car World Series race winners, had incidents in the middle-to-late stages of the race that ended their respective days. Under the caution for the Philippe incident, Franchitti's fueler got stuck in his car, causing him to lose track position. With nobody to block for him, Dixon was powerless on the restart to stop Castroneves from passing him. The Penske Dallara-Honda cleared Dixon before the cars even entered turn 1. It turned out to be the winning pass.\nThe scariest incident of the day occurred on lap 173, when Vítor Meira and Raphael Matos collided in turn 1. Both had heavy contact with the wall. Meira's car also flipped on its side and slid along the wall for hundreds of feet before falling back to all four wheels on the track. Meira was taken to Methodist hospital after the incident. Meira broke two vertebrae in his back and spent the next two days in the hospital being fitted for a back brace. Matos suffered a bruised right knee in the crash.\nRyan Briscoe had fallen back to the middle of the pack with a bad set of tires, but short-fueled in a late round of pit stops to claim second place, behind teammate Castroneves. Eventually Briscoe attempted to take the lead, with the intention of pulling Castroneves along, in order to help the Brazilian save fuel by using the draft. However, he had to pit during the Meira–Matos caution and was never a factor to win.\nIn the final 15 laps, Castroneves maintained a gap over Dan Wheldon, Danica Patrick and Townsend Bell. Castroneves and Wheldon kept similar lap speeds of 218 mph through the last 15 laps, but with a gap of roughly eight car lengths and Patrick on his tail, Wheldon could not catch the pole-sitter.\nCastroneves won the event as his sister, Kati, and mother celebrated. The driver and his crew engaged in his traditional victory celebration, climbing the frontstretch catch fence, to the delight of the crowd. It was his third career Indianapolis 500 victory, with the others coming in 2001 and 2002. He is the sixth driver to win three 500s and the first foreign-born driver to do so.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe race was televised in high definition in the United States on ABC, the 45th consecutive year on that network. ABC Sports signed a four-year extension to continue covering the Indianapolis 500 through 2012. Marty Reid served as anchor for the fourth year. For the fourth time, the telecast utilized the Side-by-Side format for commercial breaks.\nTime trials and Carb Day were shown live in high definition on Versus, part of a new ten-year contract with the network and the Indy Racing League. Bob Jenkins served as anchor, along with Robbie Buhl and Jon Beekhuis as analysts. Jack Arute, Robbie Floyd, and Lindy Thackston covered the pits.\nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the IMS Radio Network. Mike King served as anchor. For the first time, three living \"Voices of the 500\" joined together to offer commentary during the pre-race. King, Paul Page, and Bob Jenkins recollected their experiences on network. Page remained in the booth to offer commentary and observations throughout the race. Jenkins, who had returned as a turn reporter in 2007-2008, was unable to serve during the race due to his commitments with Versus.\nJake Query moved from the pits to take the turn two location. For 2009, there were only three regular pit reporters, but they were joined by Dave Wilson, who moved from the booth to cover the garage area and infield hospital.\nFor 2009, as a gesture to the Centennial Era, a special change was made for the famous out-cue \"Stay tuned for the greatest spectacle in racing.\" The out-cues for each commercial break were recordings of previous renditions by the former \"Voices of the 500\". Each commercial break would feature a different chief announcer, rotating through Sid Collins, Paul Page, Lou Palmer, Bob Jenkins, and Mike King."

        "text": "The 1979 UK Championship (officially the 1979 Coral UK Championship) was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place between 19 November and 1 December 1979 at the Guild Hall in Preston, England. This was the third edition of the UK Championship that would later become part of snooker's Triple Crown. The event was sponsored by Coral for the second year in a row.\nJohn Virgo won the championship, in his only major tournament win, by defeating Terry Griffiths 14–13 in the final, despite being deducted two frames for arriving late. The defending champion, Doug Mountjoy, was defeated 5–9 by Steve Davis in the opening round. Griffiths compiled the tournament's highest break of 119 in his semi-final win over Bill Werbeniuk. The last session of the final was broadcast by the BBC on their \"Grandstand\" programme; however, due to a strike by BBC personnel, the final frames of the match – including Virgo being awarded the championship – were never broadcast or recorded.\nTournament summary.\nThe 1979 UK Championship was a professional non-ranking event held between 19 November and 1 December 1979 at the Preston Guild Hall, England. The tournament was the third annual UK Championship, first held in 1977. The event saw 27 players compete, with the highest-ranked eight players based on the previous years world championship receiving a bye to the last 16, and the last six players competing in a playoff round. This was the first time that any seedings list for a professional snooker tournament had occurred. Ray Reardon did not compete at the event, having signed a sponsorship contract with General Motors to only play in specific tournaments and exhibitions. World Championship semi-finalist Eddie Charlton and Rex Williams did not play at the event, instead opting to play in a tour of Australia.\nMatches until the final were contested as best-of-17- matches, with the final played as best-of-27-frames. The preliminary rounds saw two matches reach a final frame decider, with both John Dunning and Jackie Rea winning matches 9–8.\nEarly rounds.\nThe last 24 round was played from 20 to 23 November 1979. Future six-time world champion Steve Davis made his debut in the competition and defeated John Dunning 9–3. Another future world champion Joe Johnson also made his debut in the competition, playing his third professional tournament, but lost 3–9 to Bill Werbeniuk. All three players who competed in the preliminary round were defeated in the last 24.\nThe round of 16 saw Steve Davis overcome reigning champion Doug Mountjoy 9–5. World number four and three-time world champion John Spencer was defeated by Bill Werbeniuk 8–9. Former winner Patsy Fagan defeated two-time Pot Black champion Graham Miles 9–5. John Virgo defeated Tony Meo 9–6, despite being 5–0 and 5–3 down after the first session, making a break of 102 in frame 11. Dennis Taylor and Willie Thorne contested a final frame decider, with Taylor defeating Thorne to win 9–8. Having won the 1979 World Snooker Championship earlier that year, Terry Griffiths defeated Cliff Wilson 9–4.\nQuarter–semi-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were contested from 24 to 26 November 1979. John Virgo took an early lead over Steve Davis 4–3, and later 8–7 in their match. In frame 16, Virgo had the chance to win, and Davis accidentally dropped his cue, making a loud sound. Virgo still potted the next shot during the noise and make a clearance to win the match 9–7. Post-match, Davis commented to Virgo that it was the only time he had ever wanted his opponent to \"not\" miss. Elsewhere, Dennis Taylor defeated Patsy Fagan 9–6, Bill Werbeniuk defeated Ray Edmonds 9–8, and Terry Griffiths defeated Alex Higgins 9–7.\nThe semi-finals were played from 27 to 29 November 1979. The semi-finals were similar to the 1979 World Snooker Championship, where John Virgo played Dennis Taylor and Terry Griffiths played Eddie Charlton. In place of Charlton, Bill Webeniuk took on Griffiths. Despite having lost heavily at the world championships (12–19), Virgo defeated Taylor 9–4 to reach his only major final. In the second semi-final, Terry Griffiths defeated Werbeniuk 9–3.\nFinal.\nThe final was contested as a best-of-27 frame match, held between 30 November and 1 December 1979. The match was held over three sessions, with two on the first day and the final on the second, between John Virgo and world champion Terry Griffiths. Virgo took an early lead, winning the first five frames including breaks of 63 and 67. Griffiths won two of the remaining frames, but trailed 7–2 after the first session. The second session saw Griffiths win the first three frames to trail 7–5 before Virgo led 11–7 at the end of the session.\nThe final session was played on 1 December 1979 and was broadcast on \"Grandstand\". With the final being live on national television, the match was moved from the regular 1:45 p.m. start time to 12 noon. Virgo, having not seen that the times had changed, was reading a paper in his hotel room when he was informed that he had missed the start time for the session. Virgo was over 30 minutes late to the arena and was docked two frames for arriving late. Griffiths took the two remaining frames before the interval to tie the match 11–11.\nDuring the interval, Griffiths approached Virgo and offered half of the prize money for the event, apologetic at the situation of having frames awarded. Virgo replied: \"You haven't won it yet,\" noting the match hadn't finished. Virgo won frame 23 to lead 12–11, before Griffiths tied the match again at 12–12. Griffiths made a break of 68 to lead 13–12, before a break of 50 in frame 26 by Virgo took the match into a deciding frame. Virgo won the final frame to claim the match 14–13 and his sole major title win. The final frames of the final were unaired, due to a strike of BBC staff, with cameramen leaving the arena during the final frame.\nMain draw.\nThe following is the full results from the event.

        "title": "Small ball (baseball)",
        "text": "In the sport of baseball, small ball is an informal term for an offensive strategy in which the batting team emphasizes placing runners on base and then advancing them into scoring position for a run in a deliberate, methodical way. This strategy places a high value on individual runs and attempts to score them without requiring extra base hits, or sometimes without base hits at all, instead using bases on balls, stolen bases, sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly balls, the hit-and-run play, and aggressive baserunning with such plays as the contact play. A commonly used term for a run produced playing small ball is a \"manufactured run\". This style of play was more often found in National League game situations than in the American League due in large part to the absence of the designated hitter in the National League until the universal adoption of the Designated Hitter.\nA team may incorporate a small-ball strategy for a variety of reasons, including:\nMost commonly, managers will switch to small-ball tactics while a game is in progress, doing so upon the convergence of a variety of factors including having appropriate hitters coming up next in the batting order and, often, having fast runners already on base. A team could also start the game with the intention of playing small ball but then change from this strategy at some point during a game, depending on circumstances, such as when the opposing pitcher is struggling or has left the game or when the team is ahead or behind by several runs.\nBackground.\nSmall ball is a contrast to a style sometimes called the \"big inning\", where batters focus more on drawing walks or getting extra-base hits and home runs. This may produce many innings with little but strikeouts and flyouts, but occasionally innings with several runs. By playing small ball, the team trades the longer odds of a big inning for the increased chances of scoring a single run. Specifically, small ball often requires the trading of an out to advance a runner and therefore usually reduces the number of batting opportunities that a team will have in a given inning.\nSmall ball was once the standard by which the game was played during the \"dead-ball era\" at the beginning of the 20th century, when both batting averages and home-run totals dropped to historic lows. Teams relied on bunting and stolen bases to score runs. The advent of new, cork-centered baseballs in 1910, as well as the outlawing of specialty pitches such as the spitball, saw a jump in batting averages and home runs.\nBy the 1950s, small ball had been forgotten with most teams relying on power hitters such as Mickey Mantle and Harmon Killebrew to score runs. Stolen bases totals were at a nadir, with Dom DiMaggio leading the American League in 1950 with just 15 stolen bases. When Paul Richards took over as the manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1951, his team had few power hitters, so he decided that he needed to manufacture runs by emphasizing speed as well as a strong defense. The White Sox became a contender and eventually, the team known as the won the American League championship in 1959 by relying on speed and defense. The Los Angeles Dodgers also used the strategy during the 1960s to win the World Series twice during the decade, relying on the pitching of Cy Young Award winners Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, and the base running of shortstop Maury Wills, who stole a then-record 104 bases in 1962.\nSmall ball has become less common because of the general trend toward smaller parks and more home runs, especially in the American League where the designated hitter rule further increases offensive power. However, all big league managers are still skilled at managing from a small ball perspective, as it is sometimes necessary, especially in critical games. White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén was widely credited for saying his 2005 World Series champion team played not small ball or big inning ball, but \"smart ball\", which has come to mean a more adaptable strategy.\nThe general idea of playing small ball is much more widely accepted and used in Japan; good hitters will frequently be asked to lay down a sacrifice bunt in an attempt to advance the runner if the lead off batter reached first or second base.\nHistorical examples.\nOn May 16, 1952, the Philadelphia Phillies and Cincinnati Reds played at Shibe Park in Philadelphia. With the game tied 2–2 after nine innings, Philadelphia held the Reds scoreless in the top of the tenth inning. First baseman Eddie Waitkus, batting eighth for the Phillies, drew a walk to lead off the inning. Pitcher Ken Heintzelman, batting ninth, grounded into a fielder's choice (apparently on a sacrifice-bunt attempt), reaching base and advancing Waitkus to second; Heintzelman was pinch-run for by speedy infielder Putsy Caballero. The leadoff hitter, center fielder Richie Ashburn, bunted a single down the third-base line to load the bases, and shortstop Granny Hamner delivered a single to center field to score Waitkus. The only hits delivered were the surprise bunt single by Ashburn, and the actual game-winning hit by Hamner.\nThe San Francisco Giants were widely credited with winning the second game of the 2012 World Series against the Detroit Tigers on small ball. In a 2-0 victory, the Giants scored their first run on a ball that was grounded into a double play and later earned a run on a sacrifice fly.\nThe Kansas City Royals in particular embodied this style within the last decade, leading the league in stolen bases but finishing last in home runs in 2013 and 2014, leading to a berth in two consecutive World Series, one of which they won.\nThe Cleveland Guardians also embodied this style in 2022, leading the league in stolen bases and fewest strikeouts but finishing last in home runs. This led them all the way to the 2022 American League Division Series, which they lost to the New York Yankees.\nAlternative usages.\nSometimes, the term may be used (also correctly, since it is an informal term) to refer to any of the parts of the broader strategy defined above. This may include a bunt single, the hit and run play, a sacrifice fly, the contact play, etc.\n\"Small ball\" can also be used to refer to any of the important but less glamorous techniques that individual players use to contribute to their team's success, such as a baserunner sliding toward a fielder to disrupt a potential double play, backing up other players in case of an overthrow, or attempting to take an extra base during the defensive team's effort to throw out a fellow baserunner. The contact play is another example. With runners at second and third or just a runner at third, the runners automatically advance when they see that the ball was hit on a downward plane resulting in a ground ball. If the ball is thrown home in order to cut down at the plate the runner from third attempting to score, that runner tries to get into a rundown to allow the batter to advance to second base. In this sense, it is the plays themselves, rather than the overall strategy, that are referred to as small ball.\nWhen aggregated, such individual efforts can amount to small-ball tactics even when not deliberately deployed by a team's manager. For example, if the lead-off batter reaches base, a series of individual moves can lead to run totals resembling those of the big-inning strategy but scored one at a time."

        "text": "Randy Smith (born June 15, 1963) is an American professional baseball executive. He has served as general manager of Major League Baseball's San Diego Padres (1993–95) and Detroit Tigers (1996–2002), and as assistant general manager for the Colorado Rockies (1991–93). He works with the front office of the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball and, as of , also serves as a professional scout for MLB's Texas Rangers.\nBiography.\nSmith is the son of baseball executive Tal Smith. Randy Smith became the general manager of the San Diego Padres midseason in 1993 at the age of 29. At the time, he was the youngest GM in baseball history. In his time as Padres GM, he acquired future MVP Ken Caminiti and eventual all-stars Trevor Hoffman, Andy Ashby, Steve Finley and Brad Ausmus. In a highly criticized trade at the time, Smith traded away star Gary Sheffield to the Florida Marlins for unknown rookie Trevor Hoffman. Sheffield had won the NL batting title the year before and was MVP runner-up. Smith said at the time, \"The only way to acquire quality players is to give up quality.\" While Sheffield would go on to hit 500 career homeruns and generate 53.1 WAR compared to only 27.2 for Hoffman, Hoffman spent the next 16 years with San Diego and would set the Major League record for saves, earn induction into the baseball Hall of Fame and have his number retired in San Diego.\nSmith spent six years as the vice president of baseball operations and general manager for Detroit Tigers, in which the team received Organization of the Year Honors from \"Baseball America\" and \"Howe Sports Data\" in 1997. He was also named \"Baseball America\"'s American League Executive of the Year in 1997. Smith inherited a Tigers roster that was in flux with the retirements of former all-stars Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker, as well as longtime manager Sparky Anderson. In an effort to obtain young and inexpensive talent, Smith traded away highly paid all-stars Travis Fryman and Cecil Fielder. Smith was known for several trades involving the Tigers and his former team, the San Diego Padres, and for several trades with the Houston Astros, where his father Tal Smith was president of baseball operations. Under Smith, the Tigers acquired a host of young players that were listed as \"Top 100 Prospects\" by \"Baseball America\", including former top-10 prospects Brian Hunter, Andújar Cedeño, and Matt Drews. Despite the collection of younger talent, the Tigers failed to achieve a winning record in any of Smith's seven seasons with the club. The pitching, attendance, and payroll ranked near the bottom of the American League until the team moved to Comerica Park in 2000.\nFollowing a 0–6 start to the 2002 season, Smith was fired along with manager Phil Garner. He then returned to the San Diego Padres in 2003 as director of professional and international scouting. In 2010, Smith was named the Padres' Director of Player Development. Over the next few years, the Padres had one of the top farm systems in baseball, being ranked #1 by ESPN in 2012.\nIn 2016, the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball hired Smith as a senior advisor to their general manager. He still holds this role as of 2023."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured England in the 1999 cricket season, playing 12 first-class matches including four Tests against England.\nNew Zealand won the Test series 2–1, with one match drawn. As a result, England fell to the bottom of the Wisden Test rankings.\nOverview.\nAt Edgbaston, in a low scoring match, an England team without a coach (as David Lloyd has resigned after their exit from the World Cup) surprised themselves by beating New Zealand by 7 wickets. Trailing by 100 runs on first innings, New Zealand could only set England 208 to win the match collapsing to only 107 all out in their second innings. England lost one wicket late on day 2 but of significant importance is that the cloud cover which had prevailed for the previous two days (during which 21 wickets had fallen) had disappeared. New Zealand could manage only two more wickets as Hussain, Thorpe and fledgling all-rounder Alex Tudor took England to victory. Tudor made 99 not out including 21 fours.\nRoger Twose admitted New Zealand were \"bitterly disappointed\" to lose the first test when interviewed by Channel 4 during the second test and their response was a resounding win at Lord's. New Zealand bowled England out for a paltry 186 on a good batting wicket and then ground out 358 at barely 3 runs per over. Leading by 172, England faced an uphill battle to even make New Zealand bat again. With no batsman able to score more than 45 (Andrew Caddick at number 8 top scoring), England set New Zealand 60 to win - which they duly did by 9 wickets. Chris Cairns took 8 wickets in the match including the celebrated Chris Read ducking what ended up being a leg stump yorker as he lost sight of Cairns's slower ball.\nIn the third test at Old Trafford, the rain largely saved England as they could only face 68 overs in their 2nd innings. Alec Stewart made 83 not out to hold off defeat. Nathan Astle and Craig McMillan scored centuries in New Zealand's 496/9 declared.\nThe series was therefore 1-1 heading into the final match at the Oval. Another low scoring contest (something of a feature of this series) ensued. Leading by 80 runs on first innings, again New Zealand somewhat collapsed to 162 all out in their second innings, Cairns top scoring by some margin with 80 batting at number 8 including some huge sixes off Tufnell. England therefore needed only 246 to win the match and series but fell well short at 162 with nobody able to stay with Michael Atherton who made 64.\nThis series is probably most memorable for:\nAt the end of the series, England had dropped below Zimbabwe in the Wisden world rankings and in a moment of black humour England's fans were heard to sing \"We've got the worst team in the world\" to the tune of the hymn \"He's got the whole world in his hands\"."

        "text": "India's 2003–04 tour of Australia was composed of seven first-class matches, including four Tests. India also participated in an ODI tri-series with Australia and Zimbabwe. The Test series was drawn 1–1, and India retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy because of their victory in the Trophy's previous contest. In the 2003–04 series' Adelaide Test, Rahul Dravid scored a double century, securing a famous win for India. Sachin Tendulkar scored 241* in Sydney, which up until that point in his career was his highest score in a Test match. Captain Sourav Ganguly made his first test century against Australia, a 144 in Brisbane that gave his team a lead of 86 after they were in trouble. VVS Laxman played consistently well throughout this series, most notably his contribution in the Adelaide test is well remembered. This series was also the last for Steve Waugh, who had captained Australia to a record equalling 16 consecutive test match victories and had 41 victories in 57 Tests.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nMatch report\nDebuts: \"Nathan Bracken (Australia)\"\nFirst day:\nThe pitch at the Gabba had a green top, which was acknowledged as being greener than the Gabba ever was. There was heavy cloud cover all day too. These conditions were accepted as being the Indian bowlers' only chance to quell the Australian bowlers as their bowling relied more on swing rather than pure pace. Sourav Ganguly, the Indian Captain won the toss and chose to field, but Zaheer Khan, India's opening bowler bowled a wayward first spell and then he and Ashish Nehra bowled consistently on a full-length basis, which resulted in the accumulation of runs for the Australian openers, Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer. While Hayden played aggressively, Langer played stylishly, in an almost \"apologetic\" manner.\nThe duo piled up the runs before the Indians luck changed when Akash Chopra caught Langer off Ashish Nehra's no-ball at square leg. After this, the Indian bowlers made the batsmen play and miss more frequently and Zaheer Khan produced a good spell. But it was not until the score read 73 that India separated the two Australians. Zaheer Khan took Hayden's first wicket with a flashy delivery, which Hayden edged to VVS Laxman at slips for 37 made from 52 balls.\nThe new batsman Ricky Ponting walked in and was greeted by Ajit Agarkar's beautiful first over, but Agarkar was quickly removed from the attack after some poor bowling resulted in damage of his figures which read: 5–1–40–0. Then having no other options, Ganguly turned towards the only spinner in his team, Harbhajan Singh. Harbhajan had dismissed Ponting five times in the 2000–01 series and had troubled the Australians with 32 wickets in three tests, but this time his first ball was savagely cut by Langer, and then Ponting dealt with him in the same manner.\nDuring the course of their 89-run partnership, neither spin nor pace could unsettle the two batsmen. Then against the run of play, Zaheer Khan got the wicket of Ponting with a short delivery. Damien Martyn walked in at 162/2. He was unhurried and played his own game, which ESPNcricinfo writer Anand Vasu wrote, was \"very pleasing to the eye\". Finally, when no play was possible due to bad light, Australia had finished at 262/2 from 62 overs at an above-par run-rate of 4.22, with Langer finishing at 115 from 175 balls, and Martyn finishing at 42. At the end of the day, Langer hailed this century as one of his \"best\".\nSecond day\nPlay started at 11:30 am on the second day and Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar, had been refreshed after a break after day one. The first batsman to be dismissed by the two Indian quicks was Justin Langer. He was dismissed by Agarkar's skiddy medium pace which was aided by late swing. Langer had just smashed Agarkar's previous ball to the fence, when he got dismissed off the next ball by a ball that pitched just in the line of the off-stump and would, as replays went on to show, have not gone past leg-stump. He was dismissed for 121. Australia's score read 268/3. Next man in was Steve Waugh playing his final test at Brisbane.\nWaugh had walked in amidst loud ovation, and his arrival was widely anticipated. However, he immediately got into trouble, when, Martyn punched a ball through covers, and then ran two for it. Waugh then backed up for a third run, but Martyn pleaded to him emphatically enough to ignore the run. However, by the time Waugh did heed the call, it was too late for him to turn around. Martyn then sacrificed his wicket for his captain's. He was run out by Harbhajan Singh's throw from the deep, which Parthiv Patel took and whipped off the bails. However, the strangeness of the dismissal was accentuated by the fact that the ball was a no-ball. Waugh could not redeem himself as he got out shortly to a short ball by Zaheer Khan, and while trying to negotiate a ball from Zaheer, overbalanced and trod on his stumps. This dismissal gave him the dubious distinction of being the only man to be dismissed in every way possible in cricket, barring obstructing the field and timed out. Referring to his failure and the unfortunate mix-up between him and Damien Martyn, Greg Chappell mentioned in an interview that Waugh's last mile was going to be uphill from then. Waugh's dismissal brought the score down to 275/5.\nDuring lunchtime, the rain-gods visited the Gabba and confined the players indoors till 4:20 pm. The next session of play after that was dominated by the Indians. Adam Gilchrist, the next batsman in, was usually known to reply with a furious fifty or hundred, but he too, did not hang around for too long, as he lasted for four balls and did not trouble the scorers at all and departed for a duck with the scoreline being 276/6. Again his manner of dismissal was familiar: caught Laxman, bowled Zaheer. Buoyant and hopeful of their prospects of cleaning up the tail after Gilchrist's wicket, the Indians scalped the wicket of Andy Bichel(11 runs) caught by Laxman again, off Agarkar's bowling, then Simon Katich, who had contributed 16 runs to the score, before his nervous stay at the wicket was ended by a tentative poke at a Zaheer delivery to wicket-keeper Parthiv Patel.\nJason Gillespie was distinctly uncomfortable during his stay at the crease as he was tested immediately by a few Ajit Agarkar deliveries before being run-out after attempting an over-ambitious fourth run to reduce Australia to 317/9. The Australian tailenders added further six runs before light worsened and play could not be continued anymore. The Indians had dominated a damp squib of a day, where only sixteen overs could be bowled. The Australian batsmen squandered a strong platform set by their top-order, to lose an incredible 7 wickets for 61 runs. The second day of the match was notable for the sixteen overs of play during which only two bowlers were used: Ajit Agarkar and Zaheer Khan. However, on a worrying note, the Indian Captain Sourav Ganguly was warned for his bowlers not completing nine fewer overs than the scheduled number of overs that was to be bowled. This constituted a level two offence in the ICC's Code of Conduct and Ganguly was liable to be penalised fifty percent of his match-fees. This risked Ganguly being the first captain in test cricket to be docked for slow over-rates after he became the first captain to be docked a couple of runs for running in the Danger Area in a test against New Zealand in Ahmedabad earlier that year.\nPraise was reserved for the Indian bowlers' extensively penetrative bowling and their ebullient comeback after a tolling day which saw them becoming increasingly despondent and lacklustre. Zaheer Khan bowled half of the sixteen overs possible on that day and his figures were: 8–0–42–3. These figures if expensive, belied the fact that Khan bowled according to the plans the Indians had set to different Australian batsmen. Zaheer hit an unplayable line and length mark right from his very first over and did not let any batsman settle. Agarkar kept Martyn quiet with some deliveries that the batsman played and missed. Greg Chappell and Sunil Gavaskar, two players who had played in the 1981 Melbourne test match between the two countries, when India defeated the Australians by 59 runs after setting them a target of 143, reckoned that the Indian bowlers' performances were quite close to the bowling heroics put up by the Indian team in that match. Overall, Zaheer's 5/95 was his third successive five-wicket haul in tests.\nThird day\nThe third day brought frustration for all players alike and the spectators too, as the weather proved to be extremely unkind, delaying the start of the day's play and hastening its end. The 9,136 spectators who had assembled to witness whether their home team could inspire a fightback of the sort the Indians produced the previous day, but it was treated to long hours of waiting, and when the play did begin it seemed like a farcical proceeding, for the day's play began only at 3:18 pm and ended just 37 minutes later, at 3:55 pm. The day's play however, was not shorn of its drama and excitement. In the 38 balls that were sent down on the third day, one was enough to clean up the Australian tail. Ajit Agarkar bowling the first over of the day, bowled the first delivery of the day short and wide of off-stump. Stuart MacGill, the batsman played an ugly shot, a clumsy sweep, which only succeeded in procuring an edge which ballooned to Akash Chopra at point. Perhaps MacGill felt embarrassed by his own shot selection as he was seen grinning sheepishly to Nathan Bracken, the non-striker after his dismissal.\nFinally after Australia ended their innings on 323, the Indian openers Chopra and Virender Sehwag faced the uphill task of facing 35 balls of high-quality swing and seam bowling, which was aided by a track which had enough grass on it to suggest that it would assist seam movement. Further, the overcast and gloomy skies did not bode too well for the Indian openers. Taking advantage of these conditions and the fact that Chopra was playing in only his third test, Jason Gillespie produced an incisive spell of bowling. His very first ball indicated that there would be a touch of outswing for him. He stuck the right length time and again, and he beat Chopra's edge frequently, making him play and miss. However, if he was beaten, Chopra did not betray any sign of that fact and played out the two frontline bowlers with assurance. Sehwag was beaten time and again by Nathan bracken, who, despite playing only his first test, generated a lot of bounce with his natural high-arm action and dominated Sehwag throughout. Sehwag, though treated his sluggish start without the slightest care and played on with nonchalance. Both of the openers made five each and India had reached 11/0 from 6.1 overs when play was concluded at that stage.\nFourth day\nAt the close of the fourth day's play, though India had no chance of winning anything, they dished up a performance they could have been proud of. To summarize the events that happened on that day, India closed at 362/6 from 105 overs, with VVS Laxman and the Indian Captain Sourav Ganguly helping themselves to some runs. Laxman scored 75 runs from 113 balls with 11 boundaries, while Sourav Ganguly played the innings that defined the test match and made the day memorable for one and all. He scored 144 runs from just 196 balls laced with 18 shots to the ropes.\nThe day began well, and the weather was pleasant and sunny. Steve Waugh immediately unleashed his pack of fast bowlers, who posed a formidable threat to the Indian pair of Sehwag and Chopra. But the two openers, handled them with ease and looked the part of a top order pair. Sehwag took advantage of an ordinary bowling spell by Andy Bichel, flicking and driving confidently. He could not, however, negotiate the full and swinging deliveries and was dropped off one such delivery by Nathan Bracken. But the speedster had his revenge as he scalped Sehwag for his first wicket in tests. Sehwag departed for a fast 45 from only 51 balls. The score stood at 61/1. Later, Rahul Dravid batting on one, was tricked by a Jason Gillespie delivery into poking at a delivery that swung and seamed away. This produced a fatal edge that Hayden gleefully accepted. Dravid departed for 1 and the score was 62/2. In the very same over, Sachin Tendulkar came out to bat. After batting out two uneventful balls, Gillespie let loose a quick one. Picking the line of the ball early as the ball seemed like missing the off-stump, Tendulkar shouldered arms and the ball went and thudded onto his pads. Umpire Steve Bucknor looked blank for some time and finally raised his finger. Bucknor had already had a history of bad umpiring earlier in this match, overriding straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen in their first innings, and this decision made things worse for him. His decision did not go too well with Tendulkar's Australian fans. Some of them reportedly made remarks like: \"\"Didn't he turn down two straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen on the first day? Don't they call him a batsman's umpire?\" and some others said, \"Hey mate, we came to watch Tendulkar bat, not Bucknor wag his finger.\" But Tendulkar took the decision with grace. Robert Craddock, writing in \"The Australian\", commented that, \"World cricket does not need electronic help to sort out lbw decisions. It just needs better umpiring. Steve Bucknor shouldn't have needed a camera to give Sachin Tendulkar not out when he was struck high ... Bucknor, a delightful fellow, was a great umpire at his zenith but there have been signs in recent times he is slipping and there is a gap emerging between his still high reputation and his performance.\" Rajan Bala also wrote in the \"Asian Age\":\"In an earlier birth Bucknor might have been one of those Roman emperors who ensured that the crowds at the Coliseum were kept in suspense before he gave the thumbs-down signal to end the life of a gladiator or a Christian.\" In fact, so annoyed were the fans that during Ganguly's innings, when he was struck in the shoulder, they said aloud: \"Give him out now.\" The comment was noted to be quite sarcastic in nature.\nIndia were reduced to shambles at 62/3, and then Ganguly came out to the middle. Ganguly was the unenviable possessor of a batting average of below 30 in Australia, and his weakness at handling the short delivery was only too well-documented. Therefore, there were some suggestions that Ganguly would drop himself down the order to no.6, so as to delay facing the Australian pacemen as much as possible. His first scoring shot was a streaky shot between gully and third slip, which brought him three runs. Then he played the odd shot outside the off-stump, but other than a few risky fours, there was nothing to suggest that he would fail. Ganguly then drove Andy Bichel between cover and mid-off for another boundary. This proved to be the integral part of his innings as he was decidedly more at ease and runs started to flow from his bat. Previously, on India's tour of England in 2002, he stroked a 128, which had a lot of unorthodox shots and some savage hitting. This innings, though, seemed to have reclaimed the majesty and beauty that Ganguly's batting had been known for. His footwork was noted to be the most intriguing part of his stay at the wicket. He did not move his feet exaggeratedly during his innings and unfurled a huge variety of strokes towards the end of the innings, without once breaking the momentum he had set. He also left the balls that were way outside the off-stump and his defense grew progressively secure and certain. He handled the short ball extremely well too, slapping them away, or ducking safely. There was superb timing and placement written all over his trademark off-side shots. In fact, Ganguly's innings provoked humorous comments from the fans who suggested that his superb strokes were a result of him dining at the Taj Mahal restaurant, whose owner was a spectator.\nIn the early stages of his innings, he was ably assisted by Akash Chopra, who made a solid 36, but after Chopra's dismissal, VVS Laxman walked out to bat with the scorecard reading 127/4. He started to play some sumptuous shots off back foot, a few flicks with a delectable roll of the wrists, and a characteristic swivel-pull, which signalled that he was going to get a hundred as well. Peter Roebuck wrote of his innings: \"Laxman's innings was astonishing. In his hands, a bat becomes a wand...Laxman does not play any ugly shots but he is no mere stylist, for his beauty is innate. He hits the ball hard and with plenty of control and scores quickly because he can and must. He is hard to contain, for he has a wide range of strokes at his disposal and an appetite for big scores. Opponents fear his reach towards the extraordinary.\" For a man who had been under needless pressure, Laxman's innings was quite soothing and he dominated almost every bowler except Gillespie and MacGill, against whom he scored 7 runs off 24 balls and 14 runs off 40 balls respectively. His end came unexpectedly and almost against the run of play, as he was out slicing a short and wide delivery of MacGill's to Simon Katich, leaving India at a healthy stage of 273/5.\nGanguly carried on with Parthiv Patel, who had made an unbeaten 37. When he reached his century, his celebrations were emphatic and boisterous, as he had finally made an important innings under pressure against the best team in the world. He carried on until he reached 144, before holing out to Gillespie off MacGill. Then the score read: 329/6. Patel and Agarkar carried on until no more play was possible due to bad light.\nFifth day\nThe fifth day did not hold much enthusiasm as the scorecards might suggest, as India took off from where they started, from 362/6. India's tail wagged as they put on 47 runs for the loss of 4 wickets. Ajit Agarkar was the first man to be out in the morning to Andy Bichel, and then he was followed by Parthiv Patel, whose ill-fated, top-edged hook was caught by a diving Bichel off Gillespie. The two batsmen departed without India adding any run to their score. At 362/8, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh had a fine outing with the bat. Zaheer swatted a six and three boundaries in his 27 and Harbhajan hit 19 in his own inimitable fashion, as India pushed along to 409. They had obtained a lead of 86– a rarity in Australia against Australia itself. Moreover, this achievement was significant because India were written off before the match even began.\nAustralia's second innings began weakly, with Langer edging Agarkar to Patel before he even opened his account. Australia were then at 6/1. A window of opportunity opened up for the Indians. However, their hopes were soon evaporated by Matthew Hayden's dynamic strokeplay. He hit the ball hard, transferring his weight to the back foot often, and displayed clean and strong hits which sent the ball crashing to the fence. His powerful strokeplay ended on 99 from 98 balls. He reached 99 with a six off Ashish Nehra. The Queensland fans and the Hayden family cheered, but he missed out the century when he top-edged a sweep to Sehwag at midwicket off Harbhajan. Hayden's knock was remarkable for the disdain he treated the Indian bowlers with. He was impervious to the efforts of the Indian bowlers, which was shown by the fact that he managed to treat even the good balls contemptuously. Of the 98 balls he faced for his 99, 51 balls were good length deliveries, which were dispatched for 52 runs. When the Indian bowlers pitched the ball slightly short, he was less destructive, hitting 12 runs off 30 such deliveries. In 17 other deliveries of which 8 were half-volleys and 9 were short balls Hayden hit 19 runs and 16 runs respectively, for a total of 35 runs from the other deliveries. He dominated almost every Indian bowler he faced, except Ajit Agarkar by scoring runs at more than a run-a-ball rate.\nZaheer Khan's absence was also talked about, unable to bowl with a hamstring niggle. After Hayden's dismissal, Steve Waugh and Damien Martyn kept the scoreboard ticking with both of them scoring half-centuries, with Martyn ending on 66 not out after Waugh declared.\nAustralia thus gave India a target of 199 in 23 overs. The Indian openers however, started extremely badly, with both of them getting out in successive balls to Nathan Bracken, giving him a chance of bagging a hat-trick on his test debut. The match came alive after that and VVS Laxman the next batsman, avoided the hattrick by squirting the ball through gully. Thereafter, India had no problems absolutely, as Rahul Dravid and Laxman took the score to respectability with Dravid dominating the partnership, scoring 43 only off 47 balls, while Laxman charmed his way on to a breezy 24. Amazingly, for a match in which ten hours of play was lost, this match kept the spectators interested till the end.\n2nd Test.\nMatch report\nDebuts: \"Irfan Pathan\" (India)\nFirst day\nThe Adelaide Oval was a ground which had a flat pitch unhelpful for bowlers, and short square boundaries, which helped the Australian Batsmen, who were benefitted by their captain Steve Waugh's decision to bat first. Langer and Hayden gave their side a quick start, stitching 22 runs from 5 overs, with Hayden scoring a fast 12 off 13 balls, but the 19-year-old fast-bowler Irfan Pathan, making his debut after Zaheer Khan was nursing a strained hamstring, took Hayden's wicket for a dream start to his debut, and he took his first test wicket in only the second ball of his third over. During their relatively short stay, the two Australian openers set the tone for the day by driving along the line, exploiting a pitch, whose lack of bounce, a fast outfield, and lack of movement, proved to be frustratingly unhelpful for the Indians.\nRicky Ponting, the next man in, had a great start to his innings, creaming a boundary off only the second ball he faced. When Ponting had added just six to his tally, Virender Sehwag dropped a chance at third slip off Pathan, and when he reached 12, a close lbw decision against him off Ajit Agarkar's bowling was turned down. Overcoming these hiccups, Ponting strove on further with his innings, reaching his fifty off 64 balls, with a four off Ashish Nehra's bowling, in the 23rd over of Australia's innings. One over later, Langer joined the party, too, amassing 20 runs off Anil Kumble's sixth over with two boundaries and two sixes apiece. However, Kumble was to have the last laugh, as he trapped Langer, who nevertheless, made a dominating and attacking 58 from a mere 72 deliveries in the fifth ball of the 26th over, when Australia were cruising along at a run-rate of above five per over. The dismissal occurred shortly before lunch, providing the Indians with a vital breakthrough, but the relief was a short one, as Langer was replaced by Martyn, who proved to be a thorn in the Indian team's flesh. Martyn seemed to be in a graceful touch from his first ball, stroking some good shots to the fence against the pace duo of Agarkar and Pathan, the latter being unable to replicate his good start with the new ball. Just when he seemed set for a big score, Martyn threw away his wicket when he chased a wide ball from Nehra to VVS Laxman. Steve Waugh the next batsman also played a few through the off-side for his 30 before he was bowled by a clever piece of bowling from Nehra. Simon Katich came in at the fall of the fourth wicket at 252, and then he proceeded to add 138 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting. Katich started slowly, but gained momentum and proceeded to pepper shots all over the wicket once he settled down, the most memorable shot being a six of Nehra. The partnership ended in the 88th over of the Australian over of the day, when he top-edged a pull from Agarkar, only to be caught by a spectacular catch by Sehwag, who came in diving full-length and held on to the cherry with both hands.\nAustralia ended the day with 400/5 from 90 overs, and Ponting was unbeaten on 176, his 19th test hundred and his fifth for the year 2003, a remarkable year for him in which he had hitherto scored 1149 runs at an average of 95.75, and had set his sights for a double century. His innings was exceptional. For his first 100 runs, he picked boundaries in the gaps on the off-side, in spite of the fact that that region was packed with fielders. He raced on to his 100 from just 117 balls, but slowed down considerably, once he reached his 150. He commented about his innings, admitting that he was satisfied with the way he played on that day. He said, \"It was a good wicket, and a good outfield, and you got real value for your strokes.\" He commented of the Indian bowlers that, \"They missed Zaheer...He's been their best bowler the past couple of years, and he bowled well up in Brisbane. They didn't bowl as well as they'd have liked today, but you can't judge them based on that.\" Ponting's crisp strokeplay combined with aggression to produce a fantastic knock. However, he was aided by the fact that Ganguly got rid of the 8–1 and 7–2 fields thereby depriving his bowlers the chance of getting lbws or any catches.\nSecond day\nThe second day began in an explosive fashion. While the first over of the day (bowled by Agarkar to Adam Gilchrist) yielded only 3 runs, the second over was the one that set the tone for a day which was morbidly frustrating for the bowlers and was heavily in favour of the batsmen. The second over of the day(Ashish Nehra to Gilchrist), and the 92nd over of the Australian innings fetched 12 runs. The scoring sequence was as follows: 3–0–0–1–4–4. But in the 96th over, Agarkar managed to stop the Gilchrist juggernaut when he had him to offer a catch to Sehwag for 29, made from only 24 balls. Australia, were still looking strong at 426/5 with Ponting still around for an undefeated 182. Ponting was moving sedately at a rather sluggish pace ever since he had reached 150, and seemed considerably slow before he broke off the shackles with two elegant and sweetly timed boundaries off Nehra in the 103rd over. Five balls later, Ponting brought up his double century of a mere 289 balls with another exquisite drive to the fence. When he reached his 200, he paused to blow a kiss to his wife. He had not only scored his second double century in what happened to be a prolific year for him, but also had stitched a valuable partnership with Andy Bichel, who had scored a gutsy 19 from 45 balls before Kumble had him dismissed. The Australians, though, gave the Indian bowlers and fielders no respite, as Jason Gillespie and Ponting came together to add a partnership of 83 runs, with Gillespie making merry with 48 from 53 balls, and Ponting had already raced to 242 from 350 balls by then. However, operating in his 43rd over, Kumble first got rid of Ponting and then picked up the remaining two Australian wickets off the last two balls of that over as well. This put a huge dent on the Australian hopes of making a 600-plus score.\nThe Indian innings started modestly, with only a total of two boundaries coming off the blades of the two openers, Sehwag and Chopra, but then in the eighth over, with the scorecard reading 30 for no loss, they cracked two fours off a Gillespie over and took 11 runs off it. In the ninth over, they handed out the same treatment to Bichel as well, carting him for 13 runs to bring a fifty-run partnership from just 9.4 overs. India's first 10 overs yielded 54 runs. But in the fifth and last ball of the eleventh over, Bichel, who was a controversial selection after a poor game in Brisbane, bowled to a straight, canny field by Waugh, and ended Chopra's 27-run stay with an innocuous half-volley, which Chopra drove uppishly towards the bowler. Bichel showed wonderful athleticism in holding on to a low return catch, breaking the 66-run partnership. Later, in the 15th over, by which time Sehwag had already bludgeoned 47 from 41 balls, Bichel \"outfoxed\" Sehwag with a legcutter which bounced more than expected, resulting in a fatal edge from Sehwag, which was held onto by Hayden (81/2). Sachin Tendulkar, yet to score a run in the series after his ill-fated duck at the Gabba, was distinctly ill at-ease, and was almost run out by Langer. He made a solitary run before getting out to Bichel, whose third wicket reduced the Indians to 83/3. Sourav Ganguly, man of the match in the previous test was the next batsman, but he could hardly do anything to stop the run-glut. He scratched his way to 2, before he was run out, leaving the Indian team reeling at 85/4. VVS Laxman the next man walked in.\nTheir partnership required 13 balls to open its account, but then on, Dravid and Laxman frustrated the Australian bowlers with their patience, eschewing any risks by leaving all the good balls. Dravid displayed some amazing shots early on in the partnership. A textbook cover-drive, which in Ravi Shastri's opinion, had \"good balance\", then at 95/4, in the 25th over he hit two consecutive boundaries off Bichel, the former being a whiplash pull, while the latter was an on-drive which he played down the ground, while moving his feet well. Harsha Bhogle opined on air that, \"That is a superb shot! We have seen two shots of high-quality in this innings, in this over, rather. This was even better than that pull shot, this was shot of great class and grace...\"\nWhile Laxman, on the other hand, used his wrists diligently to even flick balls that were well outside off, to legside boundaries. In the first ball of the 30th over, Laxman unfurled a cover-drive off a Jason Gillespie good-length delivery. This shot too earned Bhogle's acclaim. He commented, \"Beautiful Shot!\", while another commentator remarked that, \"That was both languid and imperious...That shot, was the shot of a class batsman.\" In the fortieth over, MacGill bowled an off-break to Laxman, which turned sharply in, but Laxman played an inside-out shot by unfurling the \"full-face\" of the bat. In the last ball of the 48th over, Laxman reached his fifty by guiding a delivery from Andy Bichel past point for a four. He reached his fifty off 95 balls. Ravi Shastri commended his effort, stating that he came played \"extremely well\" for a \"fine innings\" under pressure. India ended the day at 180/4 from 51 overs, with the Dravid-Laxman pair putting on 95 runs for the fifth wicket from 29.3 overs. The duo batted well, without giving the Australians too many chances. The closest Australia came to a wicket was through another run-out chance, when Katich missed a direct hit which would have found Laxman well short of the crease.\nThird day\nThe third day of play had bright and sunny weather, and the pitch remained an excellent one for batting. The pair of Dravid and Laxman began in a circumspect fashion, adding only 28 runs in 17 overs, a period in which the only noteworthy accomplishment made by either sides was Dravid's half-century, which he reached with a front-foot flick to square leg off Stuart MacGill's bowling in the penultimate ball of the 59th over. Not long afterward, in the 65th over, Dravid hit the first boundary of the morning by flicking a loose, low full-toss drifting towards leg-side from MacGill. VVS Laxman, facing the first ball after the drinks break, from Andy Bichel, was dropped by Ricky Ponting when he was batting on 65. The ball was short and nicely dug in, but Laxman tilted the face of the bat at an unusual angle, getting a thick edge towards slips, where Ponting dived full to his left, but was unable to latch on to the ball. Australia would go on to regret this mistake. Sunil Gavaskar noted that Laxman would have a sudden lapse of concentration after prolonged periods of good batting. The two batsmen grew in confidence, however, and they began to bat a little more freely, with Dravid driving every ball in the off-stump line towards extra cover or cover for a boundary, while Laxman use his wristy strokeplay and his good footwork to negotiate the odd ball which kept low, and often dragging off-stump deliveries towards leg-side. This was reminiscent of the way he handled Shane Warne in 2000–01 at Eden, where he hit 281 and along with Dravid, staged a comeback to give India a famous victory. At Lunch, India were securely placed at 252/4 from 83 overs. After lunch, the two batsmen began to stroke boundaries at will, going at a rate of a four every over for the first five overs after lunch, with the highlight of that passage of play being Dravid's century. He miscued a pull from Gillespie's short ball, but had hit it hard enough for it go over the backward-square leg ropes for a six. Then Laxman reached his century as well, in the 89th over, with a single towards mid-wicket, his sixth in tests and his third against Australia, the earlier two being 167 and 281.\nThe two Indians continued to torment the Australians, with some risk-free but effective strokeplay, which fetched them boundaries. The only time in which the partnership saw an unorthodox shot was when Dravid dispatched a Stuart MacGill ball straight back over the bowler's head for a four by lashing at it hard and straight in the 106th over, when India were at 340/4. 4.4 overs later, Dravid's wristy flick off his hips brought him his 150, his seventh score of 150+ in tests at that time. Then, just when it seemed that Australia had to resign themselves to a long day, at 376/4 from 112.4 overs Laxman flashed a short and slightly wide delivery from Andy Bichel towards slips, where Ricky Ponting could not get his hands on the ball, and it went away through third man for a four. Later, when the score stood at 384/4, and the partnership was already 299, Laxman produced a classical drive with good timing, and good placement through extra cover to bring up the 300 for the partnership off 563 balls. As a respite for the Australians, on the last ball before tea, Laxman again decide to cut a good, rising delivery from Bichel, but managed to get an edge to Gilchrist, who had to stretch a little to take an impressive catch.\nHe had faced 282 balls for an elegant 148, which featured 18 fours. His innings was full of orthodox and stylish shots, notable of which were his cover drives through mid-off and extra cover, which saw him open the full face of the bat without an exaggerated follow-through. He leaned in on his drives for the spinners, while he played close to the body for the pacers, with little or no bending of his back. He moved his feet well, and used his wrists to play the ball fine, whenever the ball would stray down to middle-and-leg line. He would also flick the deliveries with no effort at all. For the off-side deliveries, Laxman would either utilize the ball's pace and send it scorching to the boundary, or he would open the face of the bat late enough to cut it. On some occasions he back-cut the ball intentionally over the slips. His innings was even appreciated by the Australian fielders. On one occasion, when Laxman drove Stuart MacGill through cover, Adam Gilchrist, exclaimed, \"Aw, nice...\" and then clapped his hands in acknowledgment of the shot, as it sped away to the boundary.\nBy the time they had been separated, the duo had already broken several records. When Dravid hit an exemplary cover-drive to bring up the 250 of the partnership, they became the first batting pair to put on two stands excess of 250 against Australia. After their stand ended, however, Dravid felt least unperturbed and forged a partnership of 59 with the young Parthiv Patel, who played well for a composed 31, which consisted of three successive fours off MacGill, but the partnership ended when Patel drove Katich to Ponting. At 447/6, the new man Ajit Agarkar came in and Dravid stitched a stand of 22 with him and then Agarkar too departed at 469/7. Finally, with the new man Kumble, Dravid added 8 runs before the play was finished for the day. He finished the day on 199 not out, an innings which was built slowly, yet steadily. This was his first test hundred in Australia, and this was an innings which \"laughed at the face of that innuendo\". Sambit Bal, noted ESPNcricinfo author argued that Dravid could have completed an easy double hundred had he not refused easy runs in order to shield the lower-order batsmen. Bal also described Dravid's batting as being \"picture perfect. It describes balance, poise and symmetry\". Laxman and Dravid had frustrated Australia so much on that day, that their partnership seemed to be an encore of that 376 that had put on together at Kolkata in 2000–01. Laxman had scored a double century then, and Dravid seemed to be on the cusp of another one. in fact, when Ricky Ponting was asked at the end of the previous day whether Dravid and Laxman's partnership brought back memories of Kolkata 2000–01, Ponting was reported to have said, \"I didn't want to think of that.\"\nFourth day\nAustralia's woes on the field were magnified by Laxman and Dravid's stubborn partnership on the third day, but their misery was to continue when it was discovered that one of Australia's bowlers, Brad Williams had injured his shoulder while fielding and that he would require a month to be back in action. The bad day which was to unfold for the Australians began with a square cut from Rahul Dravid on the first ball of the day from Stuart MacGill. He had taken 386 balls for the milestone. After reaching his double hundred, Dravid continue in fine nick, cover driving a ball from Gillespie to extra cover boundary for four, going past Ravi Shastri's record for the highest score in Australia against Australia by an Indian. His monumental innings-it lasted for well over 9 hours-ended when he top-edged a pull off Gillespie to Bichel, who took a good, tumbling catch.\nThe Indians and Australians had exploited a good batting surface, but the pitch which had rapidly worn out, aiding spinners to a large extent, because when the ball pitched on the rough and the footholds on the batsmen's end, it would turn alarmingly and would keep low as well, making it difficult for the batsmen to play some attacking shots. However, the Australian batsmen decided to tackle this situation by the mean they knew best: all-out attack.\nSure enough, the Indian bowlers got plenty of help from the pitch. However, the Australian batsmen also played a hand in their own dismissal, playing too many rash strokes. The Australians suffered their first setback, when Ajit Agarkar got Justin Langer plumb lbw in the second ball of the second over with a delivery that nipped back in. At 10/1, Ricky Ponting, Australia's first innings double centurion entered. However, he played 16 balls without opening his account before he drove straight to the hands of gully. Then the score was 18/2. Soon after, in the 15th over, (8.2 overs after the first wicket) the third wicket fell–this time, Matthew Hayden being the batsman, scooping up a drive straight to cover. Australia were soon struggling at 44/3. Then came one of the few partnerships of any substantial note in the Australian innings. Damien Martyn and Steve Waugh came together to add 65 runs for the fourth wicket. The partnership started off slowly, with only 11 runs being added in 5 overs, and then in the 21st over, Waugh broke out from the defensive shell by stroking two boundaries off Ashish Nehra's over. Thereafter, Martyn took displayed a stylish exhibition of batting with some glorious cover-drives, whereas Waugh dominated the partnership with his trademark square-drives. However, the track seemed to aid spin-even Anil Kumble's legbreaks turned a great deal-Sourav Ganguly brought on Sachin Tendulkar, and the move immediately paid off. In his third over, Tendulkar lured Damien Martyn into edging to slips, where Rahul Dravid held a superb catch. Martyn departed after a commanding 38, and then in his fourth over, he made Waugh edge a delivery to Dravid at slips. From 109/3, the Australian were suddenly in trouble at 112/5.\nIn came Gilchrist, and he began playing with his usual aggression, hitting Tendulkar for four in just his third ball. He carried on his aggression, treating Anil Kumble with disdain, smashing him for six, and then he hit a Tendulkar delivery for six as well. He was ably assisted by Simon Katich, who played sedately, and yet tackled the spinners comfortably. Gilchrist's aggression proved a perfect foil for Katich's calm strokeplay, as they mounted a stand of 71 runs from 15 overs. However, Gilchrist, in a moment of overconfidence, moved in front of the stumps to Kumble, exposing his leg-stump, which promptly got knocked over. Australia could still have hit back from 183/6, but then their tail succumbed to Ajit Agarkar, whose only claim to fame in his 18 test matches till then was the sobriquet of 'Bombay Duck', which was bestowed upon him for scoring seven ducks on the trot against Australia. Agarkar, came back for a new spell of 4 overs, in which he picked up a wicket off every over. He used the short ball judiciously and sparingly, and this tactic nailed the well-set Simon Katich, who had played a patient and a disciplined innings. For the tailenders, Agarkar bowled good-length deliveries on a consistent basis, which lured them to play aggressively, and as a result, Australia suffered. His spell with the old ball, was almost as good as the new ball, with which he \"confounded\" Matthew Hayden with the swing, and dismissed the two first innings accumulators, Ponting and Langer. Those four overs yielded only 13 runs, and Australia were bowled out for 196, while Agarkar picked up 6/41 from 16.2 overs.\nThe Indians were thus left with a target of 230, and there were still ten overs left in the day, but the Indian openers survived all of these overs without any scare. Virender Sehwag played aggressively, hitting a couple of boundaries off the fast bowlers, while he also hit Stuart MacGill's first ball for four to midwicket. Chopra also played patiently and showed no sign of nerves, cover driving Bracken and Gillespie with some good timing. They ended the day on 37 for no loss, with 193 runs still left to get after what seemed like an enthralling day of play\nLater, John Buchanan, then the coach of Australia, admitted that Australia's batting did not show any application. He stated that \"There are days when teams will get bowled out for 196 if the conditions favour bowlers and the bowling is exceptional. Sadly, we can't offer those excuses today.\n\"We always look to play aggressive cricket. It's part of our batting philosophy, we try to score off as many balls as possible. That's how we have been successful. But some of the shot selection from our top six batsmen was not good enough today. The Indian bowlers bowled in the right areas, give them credit for that. But our batting performance was immature.\"\nHe also remarked that he rather wanted the Australians to bat like Dravid and Laxman. However, he expressed his hope in the Australian team to win the match irrespective of the situation, stating that last day pitches are always difficult to play out, more so in this case, because he suggested that the pitch had some dust and would turn more the next day.\nFifth day\nIndia entered the final day with ten wickets in hand and a further 193 runs to get. Should they win the match, it would be their first in Australian soil in 23 years, moreover such a result would mean that the Australians would have lost their first home test match in five years. As the openers walked out on a bright and sunny morning. The morning sessions was intense and tension-filled, as the Australian bowlers, led by Gillespie, did not let the opening pair to settle down as they did the previous morning. The opening pair only added 11 runs to the score in five overs, before Gillespie nailed Chopra when the score was 48. Dravid, the next man in, was welcomed with a tremendous round of applause from the Australian crowd. However, the welcome he received from the Australian bowlers was less than warm. When he was batting on 9, Dravid edged a delivery in the offstump line from the injured Brad Williams to Gilchrist, who could not take a low and difficult chance. However, Dravid was once again given a thorough working over from Williams. The reprieve would ultimately prove to be costly. Had the wicket fallen, it would have been 73/2, but the second wicket did not get delayed much after that drop. Virender Sehwag had smashed a four off Stuart MacGill, but almost immediately, a couple of balls later, he got out MacGill, who dropped in a well-flighted delivery, luring Sehwag to step put of the crease and have a go at it, which resulted in his stumping. Then the score was 79/2. Sachin Tendulkar, coming at the fall of the second wicket was under immense pressure as he had only scored a meagre 171 runs at an average of 19 in five tests that he played since December 2002. His sequence of scores in those tests were:8, 51, 9, 32, 8, 7, 55, 1, 0 and 1. However, in this innings, Tendulkar started well, starting with a paddle-sweep for four of MacGill, and then he played some handsome cover-drives and unleashed his pulls whenever the bowlers seemed to have erred in line and length. He played patiently as well, not allowing the momentum to drop, but also not allowing aggression to get the better of him. His running was also prolific, as he ran three runs and on one occasion, he even ran four runs. Dravid, on the other end, played slowly and assuredly, with his runs coming mainly from solid batting rather than aggressive or flamboyant strokeplay. The duo added 50 runs within a span of 14.2 overs, when Dravid scored two runs off a delivery from Steve Waugh. Brad Williams came back for a second spell and tested the two batsmen severely with his reverse swing and limited pace. The partnership blossomed to 70, and just when it seemed that the two would bat Australia out of the game, Stuart MacGill struck with Tendulkar's wicket in the 47th over. MacGill, who had been until then, bowling from round the wicket, changed the angle and Tendulkar, failing to read a straighter one which pitched on middle-and-leg, offered no stroke and was given out lbw for a 59-ball 37, and the score was 149/3. Sourav Ganguly joined Dravid in the middle. The two added 21 runs from 9 overs before Ganguly was dismissed by Andy Bichel for 12, scooping a drive straight to Simon Katich. At 170/4, India required 60 runs more and Australia were smelling blood, and were back into the contest. Laxman walked out once again, to join Dravid, and he swung back the momentum of the match promptly. After scoring his first run off his first ball, Laxman was back on strike in the 57th over. He dead-batted the first two balls, but he caressed the third ball through covers, a full toss (by MacGill) to the boundary. When MacGill repeated that the next ball, Laxman sent it back to the midwicket boundary. Then he cut the last ball to the point boundary, taking 12 runs from the over. The next over, Dravid reached a well-deserved fifty from 129 balls, with a four off Andy Bichel. Thus, he completed the distinction of being the only man to reach two fifty-plus scores in the match. Dravid too, grew in confidence, and began to repeat his partner's exploits. Soon after the two had added 51 from 11 overs, Laxman was dismissed playing a rash stroke, mistiming a hoick off Katich to Bichel, but the match was already lost by then and at 221/4, India needed only 9 runs to clinch the match. Parthiv Patel delayed the moment, getting bowled around the legs by Katich, but it brought together India's two heroes with the bat and ball, Rahul Dravid and Ajit Agarkar to the crease. In the fourth ball of the 72nd over and with the score on 229/6, Dravid played a square cut, which went away to the boundary, and as he ran, he let out a roar and pumped his fist. Then he took off his cap and kissed the India crest on it. Steve Waugh, in a brave act of sportsmanship, gave Dravid the ball which he had cut for four, saying \"Well Played.\"\n3rd Test.\nMatch report\nFirst day\nThe match at Melbourne was crucial for Australia, as they had to pull back the advantage and had to squeeze a win for Steve Waugh, who, incidentally was playing his last match in the ground where he had made his debut nineteen years ago, in 1985, and even more coincidentally, against the same opponents.\nGanguly, the Indian captain won the toss and chose to bat first. The Indian openers justified his choice by playing some watchful cricket in the first hour, which produced less than thirty runs. Virender Sehwag was particularly watchful, and at one stage, had made only 16 runs from 53 balls. The two openers also played out three successive maidens within this period. However, by lunch, they made 89 for no loss, and by then Sehwag had completed his fifty from 78 balls, with eight fours and one six, the latter being swung away inside-out above extra cover into the stands, off MacGill.\nSehwag's innings was ably assisted by his Delhi team-mate, Akash Chopra, who was cautious and defensive. His vigil was watchful, and he played the perfect foil to his partner, complementing Sehwag's brisk strokeplay with his defensive approach. He did have his moments of aggression, though, the most notable of them being the successive boundaries he hit off Brett Lee in an over which was put away for 18 runs.\nBrett Lee had dominated the clash between himself and Sehwag for some brief moments when he hit Sehwag on the helmet twice, with just-short of a length deliveries each time. Sehwag also enjoyed a slice of luck, when a comedy of errors by the Australian fielders resulted in a run-out chance being put down. Sehwag had just struck a ball off Lee on the off-side, and had run a single, and had made his mind to go for the second, but a moment's hesitation, left him in the middle of the pitch and when the fielder threw the ball to Lee, the bowler, Sehwag was a few yards away from the crease. Unmindful of this, Lee threw the ball to the batting end, where Chopra was struggling to get to. The wicketkeeper, however, dropped the ball, only for Chopra to make it back to the crease in time.\nAfter his reprieve, Sehwag batted in a much more watchful manner, playing with discipline, not employing any ugly slogs, and playing only \"ground shots\". Against the fast bowlers, he used his back foot well, cutting or late-cutting the ball through gully, albeit sometimes with some risks, as he was almost caught by a diving Langer at third slip.\nAfter Chopra fell, with the score on 141/1, Rahul Dravid joined Sehwag in the middle and the pair cruised along steadily, and by the end of the 50th over, they had added 28 runs from 7 overs, with Sehwag having completed a hundred and Dravid having scored 9. Sehwag completed his hundred with a neatly timed, and powerful drive through midwicket for four, from just 144 balls. He had by that time, 16 boundaries and a six to his credit.\nUpon reaching his hundred, Sehwag did not do anything excessive, by his standards, instead, lofted MacGill for six and then continued his belligerent display by hitting Brad Williams for two fours and then, in the last over before tea, which was bowled by Waugh, Sehwag clubbed a six to move to 130 from 170 balls, complete with nineteen boundaries and two sixes. Australia were sloppy, as Sehwag's knock could have been nipped in the bud, had it not been for the missed run-out chance and a dropped catch when he was on 66. Mike Coward, writing for Wisden's test match report, commented on the aggressiveness in Sehwag's innings. He wrote,\nPost tea-break, Sehwag and Dravid steadied the Indian innings further and carried forward to 278/1 along with Dravid, who, having come off 305 runs in Adelaide, had made a patient 49 from 89 balls with 5 boundaries. Steve Waugh gave himself an extended bowling spell, and against the run of play, produced a delivery which was well outside leg-stump, but Dravid aimed a shot to Damien Martyn at forward square leg, and it appeared that Dravid, who had faced a lot of short deliveries from Waugh, had not anticipated this delivery. Dravid's dismissal apparently did not hamper Sehwag's rapid progress, as he whipped a delivery to square-leg boundary with a flourish, off Brad Williams in the next over after the second wicket. However, Tendulkar was soon dismissed by Lee, trying to work a delivery in the legside fine. He was the third wicket to fall at 286/3. The Indian captain, Sourav Ganguly walked into the middle to join Sehwag, whose response to the two quick wickets was to just smash a MacGill delivery next over for a six above midwicket. However, Sehwag's approach hastened his end, as he was out in the 78th over, bowled by Simon Katich, the next ball after he had hit a six.\nSehwag's \"buccaneer\" spirit was praised much by Dileep Premachandran, who asserted that his 195 would be considered as one of the finest ever innings played in the opening day of a test match. His back foot play off the fast bowlers, and his audacious and apparently murderous strokeplay against the spinners impressed Premachandran, who wrote in the same article,\nSehwag also brought out the best in Akash Chopra, who was just playing in his fifth test, and together, they had amassed 141 for the first wicket, which was the first partnership outside the subcontinent in nearly ten years. This was a contrast from the opening partnerships that had been put on in the 1999–00 series, the previous instance when India visited Australia. Then the opening partnerships read:\n7 and 0, 11 and 5, and 10 and 22. In this series, the partnerships were: 61 and 4, 66 and 48, 141. His style of play was termed to be an aberration from the way how other elite Indian batsmen used to play–with a quiet demanour and inscrutability. His innings was praised to be one of raw courage and daring.\nAfter Sehwag's exit, VVS Laxman came out to join his captain, Ganguly. The pair weathered a testing and hostile spell from Brett Lee with the second new ball in a session of play which almost saw the fifth wicket fall when Ganguly spooned back a catch to Lee, only for the bowler to put it down. The pair added valuable runs for India, with Ganguly ending on 20 and Laxman on 6. India ended the day on 329/4, having cause for satisfaction. After the day's play closed, Sehwag termed the innings as his best, \"Coming to Australia, and making runs ... it has to be my best,\" he said about his knock, which threatened to put Australia out of contention.\nSecond day\nThe second day saw India make a heavy string of mistakes which cost them dearly. Coming in at 329/4, with Ganguly and Laxman both looking good for better scores, India began the day's play with much more confidence than their opponents. India did begin brightly, after Ganguly unfurled some glorious strokes against Nathan Bracken and Lee. However, in the 95th over bowled by Lee, which lasted 8 balls, courtesy of three no-balls from the bowler, Ganguly's weakness against fast-bowlers resurfaced as he popped a short-of-length ball to gully after knocking Lee for two fours, becoming the fifth wicket to fall, for 350. Thereafter, India completely lost their way. Poor judgment from the lower-order batsmen and Laxman's dismissal for 19 contributed to India's spectacular demise, as the last 6 wickets fell for 16 runs.\nAfter ending India's chances of posting a huge total, Australia, having the perfect chance to post a good total, lost their first wicket before lunch, when Agarkar dismissed Langer for 14–for the fourth time in the series–with the score reading 30/1. The next man, Ponting and Hayden, though gave no quarter for India, as they piled up the runs. India's best bowler in the first test at Gabba, Zaheer Khan, who had returned from a hamstring injury, put up a lacklustre bowling effort, due to the after-effects of the injury.\nOf the two batsmen, Hayden was the most prolific. He reached the 50-run mark from 71 balls with a single off Khan in the 27th over. Ponting followed him, not too long after, reaching his fifty from 84 balls. Hayden reached his hundred off a mere 137 balls, but his knock was circumspect. He was selective about his strokeplay early on in his innings, batting cautiously against Ashish Nehra, who bowled two accurate and probing spells to him. His runs came mostly off Agarkar's and Kumble's bowling, driving the former down the ground, while slogging the latter, never allowing him to settle. He repeatedly attacked Kumble, whose figures were unimpressive–5-1-35-0. Hayden's running was equally good as well. After reaching his hundred, he broke the self-imposed shackles off, taking guard outside his crease, and dispatching even the good balls for boundaries.\nPonting, on the other hand, was content to play second fiddle to Hayden for once, scoring his hundred off 172 balls. His off-driving and punches behind square seemed to bear \"a brutal stamp of efficiency of a man who has scored five centuries in a year\". He dominated Zaheer Khan, and Ajit Agarkar, taking advantage of their mistakes, but his batting against Kumble was a major concern, as he did not play him with certainty or with the assuredness he displayed against other bowlers. He was lucky to survive some close chances off Kumble's bowling.\nAfter Hayden's dismissal, Ponting (120 not out at the close) and Damien Martyn saw Australia safely home to the end of the day, as India had a meagre lead of 49 by then.\nThird day\nAfter having reduced the lead to a slow margin, Australia were faced with a pitch which had deteriorated and made batting increasingly difficult. The Australian batsmen switched gears eventually after tea, from aggressive to defensive, though Ponting's second century earlier took almost 200 balls. The Indian bowlers were rewarded with Martyn's wicket in the fourth ball of the 92nd over, by which time Australia had already gained a lead of 13. At the end of the first session, Australia added 79 runs for the loss of Martyn's wicket. The second session saw some more circumspect batting, as Australia added 84 runs from the 28 overs bowled in that period, but for the loss of Simon Katich's wicket. The highlight of the second session was Ponting's double hundred, from 368 balls with a neat single off Ashish Nehra's bowling. His double hundred was described as being \"magnificent\" by S Rajesh, noted ESPNcricinfo statistician, \"for its complete mastery over the Indian bowlers\". Ponting was also dominant as he neared his double century, singling out Kumble for some punishment. His knock also continued his excellent form in the year 2003, in which he had already notched up an average excess of 100, in Tests. Another incident, a setback for Australia briefly, was Steve Waugh's decision to retire after being hurt. Waugh came out to bat to a standing ovation, but the second ball he faced, from Agarkar, was a short one to which he turned his back, turning his head towards third slip. The ball hit him on his elbow, and after a quick examination from the physio, he decided to go off. The last session made the difference, as Australia, already with a commanding 114 run lead, added 88 runs for 6 wickets, of which Anil Kumble took three. After Waugh retired hurt, Simon Katich came in and hung around, adding 64 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting, then was out to Kumble (437/5). Steve Waugh returned at this stage, wearing an arm-guard over his hand, but he looked far from comfortable in his 19-run knock. He padded up once too many times to Kumble, which turned out to be his downfall, as he lost his wicket that way (502/6). Ponting lost the tail as India steadily worked their way through the match, with some perseverance from Kumble. Ponting was stumped off Kumble, at 555/9, after missing an attempted heave. Ponting's 468-ball innings was termed as \"restrained\" and \"mature\", and had less aggression or flamboyance compared to his double century at Adelaide. His approach towards batting was similar to that of Rahul Dravid's in Adelaide: he was in command of his shots and the bowlers, so he had to occupy the crease for a long time. An important aspect of Ponting's knock which stood out was his footwork: he scored at a rate of 1.5 off the front-foot, but scored at a pace of 5.4 from the back-foot. He remarkably remained in control for 87% of the balls he faced from other Indian bowlers, except Kumble, against whom he had a lower in-control percentage of 81%. Sambit Bal noted that despite being uncomfortable against Ashish Nehra and Ajit Agarkar early on, Ponting played an innings of ambition. He added,\nOf the seven Australian wickets to fall, Kumble took four and had figures of 27–6–74–4. Overall, Kumble took 51–8–176–6. His bowling effort was termed \"lionhearted\" according to noted journalist Soumya Bhattacharya, he \"bowled with great heart and skill...but also with great skill and guile in an overseas test match.\" Bhattacharya also commented upon the change of Kumble's stock ball, the googly, which he believed now was a wicket-taking weapon that can not only turn to the right hander, but also bounces.\nAfter Australia's innings ended for 558, the Indian openers had a task of batting out 11 overs more. But they lost their way soon. Aakash Chopra lost his wicket to Nathan Bracken, wrongly adjudged caught behind when the ball had only brushed his pads. Sehwag also got out, offering a catch, flicking Lee uppishly. Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly(who came in place of Sachin Tendulkar) carried them through to the end of the day without any major mishaps, ending on 6 not out each respectively.\nFourth day\nIndia started the fourth room facing a daunting situation. Dravid and Ganguly gave India a quiet start, adding only 11 runs in the first five overs, but in the third ball of the fifteenth over, Ganguly received a blow on the back of the head from Brad Williams, and had to retire. At this point, Sachin Tendulkar came in, and along with Rahul Dravid, rescued India from doldrums. India were 109/2 at lunch, as the two batsmen applied themselves on a wearing pitch with uneven bounce. After lunch, Tendulkar began confidently, playing some good shots off Brett Lee and Brad Williams, before getting out to Williams, attempting to play a wide delivery from him. He had, by then, made his highest score in the series, 44, and a poor year personally in terms of form for him, ended. His knock was described as being \"diligent in protecting(his)wicket and resisting temptation\". Then the score was 126/3. From that point onwards, Australia executed their tactics well enough and did not employ over-attacking fields for VVS Laxman, the next batsman, knowing that he could score his runs freely anyhow. Laxman, in spite of being untroubled during his brief stay in the crease, got out to Stuart MacGill, getting drawn into edging a leg-break to slips. The score was 160/4 and India were still trailing by 32 runs. Ganguly came in after Laxman's dismissal, while Dravid was unbeaten at the other end on 53. The Dravid-Ganguly partnership resumed quietly, starting with a succession of three maiden overs within five overs. Ganguly, in particular, continued with his defensive style of play till tea. Just after the break, Australia played Simon Katich and Stuart MacGill, and the runs continue to flow freely. The second new ball was taken after eighty overs, and by then Ganguly's strokeplay had become bolder. He reached his half-century against Brett Lee's bowling with a drive to mid-off. He reached his fifty from 106 balls with eight fours. After securing applause for his fifty, he sent the next ball racing past point for four. Against Brad Williams in the next over, Ganguly swung high over square leg for four against a short delivery, like the one which had hit him on the back of his head. Lee came steaming in the next over as well, but again, he was dispatched for four off successive balls. It was \"stirring stuff, not without an element of risk in it.\"\nMeanwhile, Dravid was a picture of calm and patience, as he played yet another important innings to turn around India's fortunes. His 92 however, lacked in the polish that was exhibited in his two knocks in Adelaide, as he played and missed sometimes. But he retained an excellent control over almost all bowlers, and played a lot of dot balls, and put away the bad deliveries for the boundaries, explaining his high boundary rate. Dravid was dismissed by Lee, edging a delivery to Adam Gilchrist behind the stumps. Dravid was dismissed when the score was 253, and was the fifth man out. After his dismissal for a gritty 92, the Indian innings came to an end rather rapidly, as only a further 33 runs were added for the loss of five wickets, including that of Ganguly's who was dismissed for 73. Brad Williams turned out to be the chief destroyer of the Indian innings with a haul of 4 wickets, and constantly troubled Ganguly. Williams, who was a surprise pick over Andy Bichel, expressed his joy on being able to scalp four against the Indian batting order. He also praised Dravid for his batting. Dravid himself commented that it had been an uphill struggle for most of the day, \"It was never comfortable. When me and Sourav were going well, there was a bit of hope. But to be honest, we needed something special to happen, an Eden Gardens or an Adelaide. And those things don't happen everyday.\". India's spectacular collapse left Australia needing only 95 runs for a victory.\nFifth day\nIn pursuit of an easy target of 95 and a series-levelling win, Australia lost the wicket of Langer, who was dismissed by Ajit Agarkar, but the fall of the first wicket brought together Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden. Together, the two took Australia to a safe victory, levelling the series with one more match to go.\n4th Test.\nMatch report\nFirst day\nWith both the teams level on one win each, the final and fourth test match was critical to both the teams' ambitions. Sourav Ganguly won the toss and elected to bat first on a good, bouncy pitch. The Indian openers, Sehwag and Chopra added 98 runs for the first wicket before lunch. Sehwag and Chopra stitched the runs with a definite uncertainty, as they were troubled by the swing and seam movement generated by Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, the latter coming off an injury. The openers played and missed frequently, as Brett Lee looked like taking a wicket.\nLee almost created a breakthrough for Australia, as he had Chopra caught off a no-ball once and off the next ball, he had Chopra edge to the gully, only to have Simon Katich drop the chance. This proved to be a turning point for Lee, as Sehwag snatched 18 runs off him, a couple of overs later.\nAfter that over, both the openers looked more settled, as Chopra began to select his shots confidently and fortuitously, while Sehwag recklessly began to hit the ball, but did not overdo his hitting spree. Just when Sehwag seemed set for another big innings, he edged a good-length ball from Gillespie after lunch, and was caught behind for 72 (123 for 1).\nA short while after, Lee earned Chopra's wicket by delivering a yorker to him, after softening him with a bouncer. Chopra fell on 45, and the score was 128/2. Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar were at the crease then.\nTendulkar, who had come under scrutiny for his below-par performances, began to play a solid innings, but a compact one with no uppish shots. He laced his innings with some expansive drives, and collected his boundaries with minimum risk. Rahul Dravid, at the other end, was unyielding in his response to the bowling. He was solid as well, and he was \"fluid\" often outscoring Tendulkar in their partnership. He selected Stuart MacGill for some severe punishment."

        "text": "Harold Leon Jackson (born January 6, 1946) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) from 1968 through 1983. Jackson was drafted in the 12th round (323 overall) of the 1968 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams. In 2014, Jackson was hired to serve as head coach at his alma mater Jackson State. He was fired five games into the 2015 season.\nProfessional career.\nAfter appearing in only two games during his rookie season, he was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles and quickly emerged as one of the top receivers in the NFL, finishing the 1969 season with 65 receptions for a league-best 1,116 yards and 9 touchdowns. During his years with the Eagles, Jackson led the NFL in receptions in 1972 and in receiving yardage in both 1969 and 1972.\nPrior to the 1973 NFL season, the Eagles traded Jackson back to the Rams for quarterback Roman Gabriel (who was expendable as the Rams had acquired John Hadl). Jackson led the NFL in receiving touchdowns in 1973 with 13 and helped the Rams rebound from a 6–7–1 record the previous season to a 12–2 finish that won them the first of 7 straight NFC West Division Championships. Statistically, his greatest NFL game came against Dallas on October 14, 1973, when he caught 7 passes for 238 yards and 4 touchdowns (this came in the midst of a string of four games in which he caught a total of 13 passes for 422 yards for a 32.5-yard average with 8 touchdowns). During his career, Jackson was selected to play in the Pro Bowl five times. In 1972, he was named 2nd-team All-Pro by the Associated Press (AP), the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA) and the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) and was voted 1st-team All-NFC by the Associated Press (AP), \"The Sporting News\" and UPI. He was a consensus first-team All-Pro and All-NFC choice in 1973. He was voted 2nd team All-NFC by UPI in 1976, 1st team All-NFC by The Sporting News and UPI in 1977 and 2nd team All-Pro by the NEA in 1977.\nIn 1978, Jackson was traded to the New England Patriots. Alongside Stanley Morgan, Jackson helped form one of the NFL's best starting wide receiver duos of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Jackson became the NFL's active leader in receiving yards when Fred Biletnikoff retired after 1978, and remained the league leader for his remaining five seasons. At the time he was ranked 15th all-time, but would eventually reach second place. In 1979, Jackson finished with 1,013 yards receiving, 7 touchdown receptions and was second in the NFL in yards-per-catch with an average of 22.5. His teammate Morgan, who was nine years younger than Jackson, was the only one to finish with a higher average that season. Jackson finished his career by playing one season each for the Minnesota Vikings (1982) and the Seattle Seahawks (1983).\nDuring his career, Jackson had 29 career 100-yard games and three 1,000-yard seasons. At the time of his retirement, only Don Maynard had more career receiving yards than Jackson. He currently ranks 26th in league history in career receiving yardage. For the decade of the 1970s, Jackson ranked first in receptions (432), yards (7,724) and receiving touchdowns (61).\nDespite this, Jackson was not one of the wide receivers selected to the NFL's All-Decade Team for the 1970s and he has yet to be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nIn 2011, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Jackson to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2011.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring from professional football, Jackson coached receivers for 10 years in the NFL with New England (1985–89), Tampa Bay (1992–93) and New Orleans (1997–99). In his first NFL season as a coach, the Patriots won the AFC Championship and played in Super Bowl XX. In 1987, he suited for two of the Patriots replacement games, but did not play. Jackson served as the receivers coach at Baylor University. On January 13, 2014, Jackson was named the head coach at Jackson State University. Coach Jackson was fired on October 6, 2015, after the Tigers got off to a 1–4 start."

Frawley spent most of the next two years playing in the AHL. While playing with the Cornwall Royals, the team won the 1981 memorial cup against the Kitchener Rangers.\nNHL career.\nHe played with the Blackhawks during the 1984–85 season (his NHL rookie season). On the 7 October 1985, Frawley was picked up in the waiver draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins, the team he'd spent the next four years (the rest of his NHL career) with. His apparent leadership on the Penguins, was recognized with his appointment as captain in October 1987, a role he would hand over to Mario Lemieux two months later, because of a torn ligament that kept him out of the lineup. He received surgery for the injury and returned to play in early 1988.\nReturn to the minors.\nIn 1989 Frawley returned to the AHL, retiring in 1993. However, he came out of retirement in 1995 and played two more years, with the Rochester Americans of the AHL, winning the 1996 Calder Cup. He retired from professional hockey a second time in 1998, after the 1997–98 season.\nAmerks Hall Of Fame.\nIn 2003, Frawley was selected to the Rochester Americans Hall Of Fame.

        "text": "Robert Frederick Murray (born November 26, 1954) is a Canadian professional ice hockey executive and former player. He most recently served as the general manager of the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League. Murray played in the NHL from 1975 to 1990 as a defenceman with the Chicago Black Hawks. He played in two NHL All-Star Games and helped the Black Hawks reach the NHL playoff semifinals five times in a nine-year stretch.\nPlaying career.\nJunior hockey.\nMurray played for the Cornwall Royals of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) from 1971 to 1974. He won a Memorial Cup in 1972. After scoring 99 points as a defender in his final junior season, he was drafted 52nd overall by the Black Hawks in the 1974 NHL Amateur Draft.\nProfessional hockey.\nAfter playing with the Dallas Black Hawks of the Central Hockey League in 1974–75, he joined the Chicago Black Hawks for the 1975–76 season. After developing a leadership role with the team, Murray served as Chicago's interim captain for two months of the 1985–86 season (November 1985 to January 1986) while captain Darryl Sutter was out of the lineup with an injury. Other than starting the 1988–89 season briefly in the IHL, Murray spent 15 consecutive seasons with Chicago, finishing his career with a postseason loss to the Edmonton Oilers on May 12, 1990.\nIn 1,008 career NHL games, Murray amassed 132 goals and 382 assists. As a member of the Campbell Conference team, he appeared in both the 33rd National Hockey League All-Star Game in February 1981 and the 35th National Hockey League All-Star Game in February 1983.\nPost-playing career.\nThe Blackhawks hired Murray as their director of player personnel in 1991, and he became the sixth general manager in Blackhawks' history on July 3, 1997. He served as general manager of the Blackhawks from 1997 to December 1999, when he was fired 22 games into his third season with Chicago in last place in the Central Division. Murray briefly worked as a scouting consultant for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim before becoming a professional scout for the Vancouver Canucks from 1999 to 2005.\nOn July 14, 2005, Murray became the Ducks' senior vice president of hockey operations, working with Anaheim general manager Brian Burke and overseeing all aspects of player development. He won the Stanley Cup in this role with the Ducks in 2007.\nMurray replaced Burke as the Ducks' general manager on November 12, 2008, when Burke abruptly left the job to become the Toronto Maple Leafs' general manager and president later in the month. The Ducks made the Stanley Cup playoffs in eight of Murray's first 10 seasons in charge, reaching two Western Conference finals and winning five consecutive Pacific Division titles from 2012 to 2017. Murray won the NHL's Jim Gregory General Manager of the Year award for the 2013–14 season after the Ducks finished atop the Western Conference with a franchise-record 116 points.\nOn February 10, 2019, Murray fired head coach Randy Carlyle for the second time in their Anaheim careers and assumed the head coaching position himself for the final 26 games of the 2018–19 season. Murray returned exclusively to the front office later that summer, hiring Dallas Eakins as the Ducks' new head coach.\nOn November 9, 2021, Murray was placed on administrative leave by the Anaheim Ducks pending the results of an ongoing investigation. The investigation is reportedly focused on Murray's alleged history of verbal abuse to players and staff members. The following day, November 10, Murray resigned from his position and informed the team he planned to enter treatment for alcohol abuse. At the time of his resignation, Murray was the tenured general manager in the league.\nLess than five months later, in February 2022, Murray reportedly joined the Calgary Flames as a scout."

The competition was held on Saturday, July 30, 1904. Four American rowers competed. Frank Greer won the event, with James Juvenal second and Constance Titus third. It was the only podium sweep in the history of the event, which restricted the number of boats per nation beginning in 1908.\nBackground.\nThis was the second appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nTwo top scullers, James Ten Eyck of the United States and Lou Scholes of Canada, entered but withdrew before the race. Scholes had won the Henley Diamond Sculls earlier in 1904; he would eventually compete in the Olympics in 1908. The withdrawals left the race as a United States-only affair. The Americans who did compete included the 1902 and 1903 American champions (Constance Titus and Frank Greer).\nThe United States made its debut in the event, joining France, Great Britain, and Spain as nations who had competed once in the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe tournament featured a single race, with all four competitors rowing at the same time.\nThe distance for the race was 2 miles (3218 metres), rather than the 2000 metres which was becoming standard even at the time (and has been used in the Olympics since 1912, except in 1948). It was by far the longest distance used in the Games, over the 1.5 mile (2412 metres) course in London in 1908.\nResults.\nGreer won by two lengths over Juvenal, with Titus another half-length behind. Times are not known for rowers other than the winner."

        "title": "Austrian Cricket Association",
        "text": "The Austrian Cricket Association (Österreichischer Cricket Verband) is the national governing body of cricket in Austria. It was founded in 1981 by Kerry Tattersall as the Austrian Cricketers Association, following the re-introduction of cricket to Austria in 1975 with the founding of Vienna Cricket Club – as \"1. Vienna Cricket Verein\". Cricket was recorded as being played in Vienna as far back as the 1890s, traditionally by gardeners of mercantile families. During the post-war occupation of Austria, cricket was also played by allied forces members. Since 2017, the Austrian Cricket Association has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council, and it is one of the founding members of the European Cricket Council. The European Cricket Council, now succeeded by ICC Europe, is responsible for the administration of the ICC's European Development Program.\nExecutive committee.\nThe executive committee of the ACA is elected every two years and usually consists of three elected members\nall of which are volunteer workers.\nMember clubs.\nThe association's members are 13 cricket clubs, each holding a single vote, with clubs having to be registered with the Austrian Vereinspolizei. Currently there are clubs from four of Austria's 9 federal provinces: Whilst the majority of clubs are based in Vienna, there are also clubs in Graz, Salzburg, Steyr and Velden.\nCompetitions organised.\nThe Austrian Cricket Association is responsible amongst other duties for the administration of organised cricket competitions in Austria, with the ACA Open League perceived to be its premier competition. In 2008 the ACA Trophy, which had been a 40 over knockout tournament, and which had been geographically split since 2002 was replaced with a 20 overs competition, with a development remit.\nACA Open League.\nThe ACA Open League is a single innings league, and in 2006 was split into two parallel conferences (Austrian Conference and National Conference) to allow more teams to enter the league. The top three teams of each conference qualified for the Super Sixes stage, with the top two contesting a final to decide the Open League Champions. Teams not qualifying for the Super Sixes stage played in localised plate competitions – the Viennese Plate and the Southern Plate.\nThe league is played as a 50 overs tournament, with the exception of 2009, where due to difficulties in scheduling the League due to the unavailability of Austria CC Wien's ground in the Markomannenstrasse, it has been necessary to reduce the competition to a 35 overs format to ensure that the competition can be played to a conclusion. In 2008 logistical issues had meant that the parallel conference system was in abeyance, with a regionalised structure (a Vienna group and a non-Vienna group) with a knock-out stage for the top 6 Viennese teams joined by the top 2 from the non-Vienna group. The 2008 Open League champions were Pakistan CC, retaining the title they had won in 2007.\nThe first winners of the Open League since its split into parallel conferences was Vienna Lions CC in 2006, defeating Five Continents CC in the final played in September 2006 in Seebarn. United Nations CC won the Viennese Plate competition, with CC Velden '91 winning the Southern Plate competition.\nACA Open League Champions and Runners-up 1991–2018.\nChampions:\n8: Concordia CC/Austria CC Wien\n7: Pakistan CC\n4: Lords CC\n2: Vienna CC\n1: Pakistan Falken CC, Vienna Lions CC, Pakistan Cricket Wien\nACA Trophy.\nPakistan CC were the last winners of the ACA Trophy (North), in 2007, defeating reigning ACA Trophy (North) holders Vienna Lions CC in the final in Seebarn. Vienna Lions CC had won the 2006 ACA Trophy (North). The competition was split into two tournaments (North and South) in 2002, with Salzburg CC having dominated the ACA Trophy (South).\nACA Twenty20 tournament.\nThe inaugural Twenty20 tournament was contested by five teams in Vienna in 2008, with Pakistan CC defeating Pakistan Falken CC in the final to become champions. In 2009, United Nations CC defeated the reigning champions to win the second Twenty20 tournament, contested by six clubs. In 2010 the tournament was contested by 7 teams. In 2011 the competition split into two groups due to demand for the competition, although in 2012 the nine teams in the tournament played in a single group again. A plate competition was introduced to ensure extra cricket for sides eliminated in the group stage of the competition.\nAustrian national team.\nThe Austrian national team is open to players who are qualified to play for Austria under the International Cricket Council's qualification criteria and fulfil a nationality and development criteria. The Austrian national team made its competitive début in 1990 in Guernsey and played regularly until 2003. In 2006 the national team was revived, playing two international matches against the Czech Republic.\nThe team's return to competitive cricket was to ICC Europe's European Championships Division 4, held in Cyprus in September 2009, with the team finishing third after wins against Luxembourg, Cyprus, Slovenia and Finland and a loss against Switzerland."

Since retiring, he has continued his affiliation with the University of Georgia as a special teams assistant and the cohost of the Budweiser Fifth Quarter Show on 106.1 WNGC and 960 WRFC in Athens. He is the first kicker ever inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\nEarly life and college career.\nButler was born in Savannah, Georgia. He attended Redan High School in Stone Mountain, Georgia, outside Atlanta where he played football and soccer. He loved to play sports and play the guitar.\nDuring Butler's senior year, Redan played Marist High School for the state championship. In the closing moments of a very close game, Butler kicked a 44-yard field goal that gave the winning margin to the Redan Raiders. Attending the game was Georgia Bulldog Head Coach Vince Dooley. In a brief, impromptu exchange outside the door to the visiting locker room, Dooley congratulated Butler and pointed out that Bulldog kicker Rex Robinson would be graduating at the end of the school year. Georgia, Dooley said, would be needing a new kicker. The next year, Butler began his illustrious career as the Bulldog's kicker.\nAt the University of Georgia Butler was a two-time All-American and a four-time All-Southeastern Conference football player including three First-team selections. Thus far he holds the Bulldogs' record for scoring with 353 points (122 PAT’s, 77 field goals), and he is second in career scoring in SEC history (including all players, kickers and non-kickers). Butler helped lead Bulldog teams to two SEC titles and four bowl appearances, kicked a school record 60 yard field goal to beat the Clemson Tigers in 1984, set an NCAA record with 27 multiple field-goal games, and was named to All-Century teams selected by the Walter Camp Football Foundation and Sports Illustrated, as well as to ABC Sports' College Football All Time All-America team. In December 2001, Butler became the first kicker to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\nLater in his Georgia career, Butler opted to not use a tee to attempt most field goals, in order to better prepare him for the NFL. The NCAA banned use of a tee for field goals and extra points in 1989.\nProfessional career.\nIn his 11 seasons with the Bears, Butler became the team's all-time leading scorer with 1,116 points, easily surpassing the old record of 750 points held by Walter Payton. Butler held that record until October 11, 2015, when it was broken by kicker Robbie Gould.\nButler was also part of the 1985 Chicago Bears team who won Super Bowl XX. He set a rookie scoring record with 144 points on 31 field goals and all of his 51 extra point attempts and kicking three field goals in the Super Bowl. His record stood until 2014, when it was broken by place kicker Cody Parkey of the Philadelphia Eagles.\nIt was said that Butler called his fiancée from training camp in Platteville, Wisconsin, and explained that \"we're going to have to change the date of our wedding, because we're going to the Super Bowl and it's on January 26th.\"\nWhen he was released by the Bears after the 1995 season, he was the last remaining holdover from the Super Bowl XX team. Butler finished his 13 NFL seasons with 265 of 361 field goals (73%) and 413 of 426 extra point attempts, giving him 1,208 total points, sixth-most in NFL history among kickers.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter retiring from football, Butler became a businessman for UgMo Technologies, a King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based company that focuses on turf irrigation.\nButler returned to the University of Georgia in the fall of 2016 to complete his undergraduate degree, which he received in May 2018. He was also an undergraduate assistant for the Bulldogs during the 2016 and 2017 seasons.\nCareer regular season statistics.\n\"Career high/best bolded\"\nPersonal life.\nKevin is married to Cathy Butler. They have three children together: Katie Scarlett, Andrew Joseph and Kylie Savannah. Scarlett and Drew attended the University of Georgia. Savannah was a student at Marymount Manhattan College and is a ballet dancer. Drew was the starting punter for the Georgia Bulldogs and played in the NFL from 2012 to 2016 for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals."

        "text": "The World Rugby Hall of Fame (formerly the IRB Hall of Fame) recognises special achievement and contribution to the sport of rugby union. The World Rugby Hall of Fame covers players, coaches, administrators, match officials, institutions and other individuals. The Hall of Fame recognises the history and important contributions to the game, through one or more induction ceremonies that have been held annually except in 2010. The permanent physical home of the Hall of Fame was based at the Rugby Art Gallery, Museum &amp; Library in Rugby, Warwickshire from 2016 until 2021.\nHistory.\nThe Hall of Fame was introduced by the International Rugby Board (as World Rugby was then known) during the 2006 IRB Awards ceremony in Glasgow, Scotland. The inaugural inductees were William Webb Ellis, who apocryphally caught the ball during a football game and ran with it, and Rugby School, which has left a huge legacy with the game in a number of ways.\nThe second induction to the Hall of Fame took place in Paris on 21 October 2007, the night after the 2007 Rugby World Cup final. The next induction was in London on 23 November 2008.\nThe third induction, in which nine figures entered the Hall, was held on 27 October 2009 at Rugby School. The voting process for the class of 2009 was geared toward the history of British &amp; Irish Lions tours to South Africa, the most recent of which took place in that year; all of the candidates were either Lions or Springboks.\nFor 2011, induction ceremonies were held at various locations around the world, with the year's final ceremony taking place as part of the 2011 IRB Awards on 24 October in Auckland, the day after the Rugby World Cup final in that city. The inductions at the Auckland ceremony, according to the IRB, were \"under the theme of Rugby World Cup founders, visionaries and iconic figures,\" and were made in three groups—first for the founders of the RWC, then all World Cup-winning captains and coaches through the 2007 World Cup (minus John Eales, inducted in 2007), and finally other iconic players of the World Cup.\nThe pattern begun in 2011 was repeated in 2012, with six induction ceremonies being held in six countries. As in the two previous induction cycles, the 2012 inductions had an overriding theme; \"Rugby - A Global Game\". According to the IRB, it \"celebrates Rugby’s expansion to become a global sport played by millions of men and women worldwide.\"\nOn 31 July 2014, the IRB announced that its Hall would merge with the separate International Rugby Hall of Fame later in 2014. The merger saw the 37 members of the International Hall who had not already been honoured by the IRB formally enter the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2014 and 2015. The 2014 class of inductees also included six women.\nOn 19 November 2014 the IRB rebranded as World Rugby, and the Hall of Fame became known as the World Rugby Hall Of Fame."

Brazil has won three gold medals at the Olympic Games, has won the World Championship three times, and the World League nine times. Brazil is the national volleyball team that has won the most titles overall, and also the team that has won most titles outside their regional competition. The team is sometimes referred to as volleyball's \"Dream Team\" specially in reference to its winning streak period under coach Bernardo Rezende. Currently Brazil is ranked fifth on the FIVB World Rankings. \nPerformance history.\n2000-until now.\nAfter the sixth place in the Sydney Olympic Games, the Brazilian men’s national team underwent some important changes ahead of the 2001 season. Mr. Bernardo Rezende, nicknamed Bernardinho, who had spent six years coaching the women's national team, was chosen to be the head coach of the Brazilian men's national team. In the first season with Bernardinho, the team conquered three gold medals (World League, America's Cup and South American Championship) and one silver medal (World Grand Champions Cup). In 2002, Brazil finished second in the World League after losing the title at home idc in the match against Russia. But in that same season, they conquered the World Championship for the first time ever.\nThe beginning of the 2003 season was very special for the World Champions. In an exciting final match against Serbia and Montenegro, Brazil won the World League gold medal for the third time, beating its opponent 3–2 in Madrid. After that, the team was defeated by Venezuela in the semifinal of the Pan American Games in Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) and ended up with the bronze in the competition. However, the Brazilian squad beat Venezuela by 3–0 in the South American Championship final only one month later. That year ended with Brazil conquering the last title it had not won yet: the World Cup, in Japan.\nIn 2004, Bernardinho led the Brazilian team to a fourth title of the World League. In August, the Brazilian men's team won the second Olympic gold medal of its history, which happened in Athens in 2004 (the first one was conquered in Barcelona in 1992). In the final, Brazil beat Italy 3–1.\nIn the 2005 season, the Olympic Champion won four medals. In the final match against Serbia and Montenegro, Brazil won another gold medal in the World League, beating its opponent 3–1. After that, the team became second in the America's Cup, defeated by the United States in the final. Then in the South American Championship, Brazil conquered its 25th title, winning all matches and losing just one set. To end this great season, Bernardo Rezende’s team secured the gold medal in the World Grand Champions Cup in Japan. During the year 2006, the Brazilian team won a sixth title in the World League and a second title in the World Championship. \nThis team was considered by some commentators to the best and most consistent men's volleyball team of all time.\nTournament record.\nOlympic Games.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place\n Fourth place  \nWorld Championship.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place\n Fourth place  \nWorld Cup.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nWorld Grand Champions Cup.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nWorld League.\n 1st   2nd   3rd\nNations League.\n 1st   2nd   3rd\nPan American Games.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nPan-American Cup.\n Champions Runners up Third place Fourth place\nSouth American Championship record.\n 1st 2nd 3rd\nAmerica's Cup.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nFIVB Olympic Qualification Tournament.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following is the Brazilian roster in the 2023 FIVB Men's Olympic Qualification Tournaments.\nHead coach: Renan Dal Zotto\nFans.\nRecords.\nIncidentally, the Maracana Stadium holds the all-time volleyball attendance record when 95,000 turned out to watch Brazil beat the USSR in an open-air friendly game in 1983.\nStadium.\nGinásio do Maracanãzinho and Ginásio Municipal Tancredo Neves are Brazil's national team training and hosting venues.\nKit providers.\nThe table below shows the history of kit providers for the Brazil national volleyball team.\nSponsorship.\nPrimary sponsors include: main sponsors like Banco do Brasil, Nivea, other sponsors: Globoesporte, Gatorade, Gol Transportes Aereos, Delta Air Lines, Mikasa, Ernst &amp; Young and Asics.\nMedia.\nBrazil's matches and friendlies are currently televised by SporTV and Globo."

He also won the men's singles gold medal when badminton was a demonstration sport at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He possessed great agility, quick footwork, accurate power, and coolness under pressure, and is widely regarded as one of the finest singles players in the history of the sport.\nCareer.\nYang began training in 1975, when he was 12 years old. He was recruited by the Chinese national team in 1983. He won his first Chinese national championship title in 1984. In 1985, he won the Hong Kong Open by defeating Morten Frost. In 1986, he won the Japan Open and the Hong Kong Open for the second straight year, and also helped China to regain the Thomas Cup (men's world team championship) from Indonesia by winning key matches. In the late 80s he dominated international singles play, winning the World Championships over Morten Frost in 1987 and over young Ardy Wiranata in 1989. In 1988 he also won the Olympic exhibition event in Seoul (badminton became an official Olympic sport at the next games in Barcelona). In 1989 he added the venerable All-England Championships to his tally; thus, by twenty-five, he captured all the titles by which \"greatness\" in the sport is generally measured.\nChina's Golden Generation.\nAs a member of China's golden badminton generation of the 1980s which included the almost equally brilliant singles stars Zhao Jianhua and Xiong Guobao, Yang Yang played an important role in making China \"the\" major world badminton superpower. His play was instrumental in China's consecutive Thomas Cup (men's world team) titles in 1986, 1988, and 1990.\nRetirement.\nIn 1991, he retired as a player and started coaching in Malaysia. In the very next year, he guided Malaysia to its first Thomas Cup victory in 25 years, the only occasion since 1967 in which neither Indonesia nor China has won the cup.

        "text": "Michael Joseph Kelley (December 2, 1875 – June 6, 1955) was an American Major League Baseball first baseman. He played one season in the majors with the Louisville Colonels. He then forged a 30-year career as a manager in the minor leagues and became a legendary figure in the \"Twin Cities\" of Minneapolis–St. Paul.\nMajor League career.\nBorn in Templeton, Massachusetts, Kelley played only one season in the Major Leagues, with the 1899 Louisville Colonels of the National League. A right-handed hitter and thrower, he appeared in 76 games that season, and he batted .241 with three home runs and had 33 runs batted in. At the end of the season, the NL shrunk from 12 to eight teams and the Colonels were disbanded. Many Louisville players were acquired by the surviving Pittsburgh Pirates, but Kelley returned to the minors.\nMinor league career.\nBy , he was managing Des Moines in the Western League, and the following season he was named pilot of the St. Paul Saints of the American Association, where he won back-to-back pennants in –.\nApart from 4½ seasons, Kelley managed in the Twin Cities through . He coached the St. Paul team for nearly 18 seasons (1902–05; August 1908 – 1912; 1915–23), where he won five championships. His Saints won 115 games, the 1922 team notched 107 victories – each time winning the pennant – and his 1923 club won 111 games while finishing second, two games behind the Kansas City Blues.\nKelley first managed the Minneapolis Millers for one season (). At the close of the season, he purchased the Millers and became their manager. He led the Millers through 1931, but never won a pennant; his highest finish was second, to the Indianapolis Indians, in 1928. After a sixth-place finish in '31, he retired to the club presidency, operating the Millers until he sold them to the New York Giants in . His over-all record in his 30 years as a minor league was 2,390 wins and 2,102 losses for a .532 winning percentage.\nPost-career.\nKelley died at the age of 79 in Minneapolis, and is interred at Lakewood Cemetery."

        "title": "Gymnastics at the 1964 Summer Olympics – Men's rings",
        "text": "The men's rings was a gymnastics event contested as part of the Gymnastics at the 1964 Summer Olympics programme at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium. The event was held on 18, 20, and 22 October. There were 128 competitors from 29 nations, with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Takuji Hayata of Japan, the nation's first victory in the rings after two Games with bronze medals. Silver went to Franco Menichelli of Italy, the nation's first rings medal since 1932. Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union took bronze, breaking a three-Games gold medal streak for the Soviets. Shakhlin was the fourth man to win multiple medals in the rings, adding to his 1960 silver.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Four of the six finalists from 1960 returned: silver medalist Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union, joint bronze medalists Velik Kapsazov of Bulgaria and Takashi Ono of Japan, and sixth-place finisher Yury Titov of the Soviet Union. Two-time gold medalist Albert Azaryan had retired. Titov had won the 1962 world championship, with Shakhlin and Yukio Endo of Japan tying for second place.\nAlgeria, the Republic of China, Iran, and Mongolia each made their debut in the men's rings. The United States made its 10th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics all-around events continued to use the aggregation format. Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to two individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score.\nThese exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 128th. For the apparatus finals, the all-around score for that apparatus was multiplied by one-half then added to the final round exercise score to give a final total.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, with the final total apparatus score from 0 to 20.\nResults.\nEach gymnast competed in both compulsory and optional exercises, with the median scores from the four judges for the two sets of exercises were summed. This score was also used in calculating both individual all-around and team scores.\nThe top 6 advanced to the final for the apparatus, keeping half of their preliminary score to be added to their final score."

        "title": "National Basketball League (England)",
        "text": "The National Basketball League, or NBL for short, is a league competition representing semi-professional and amateur basketball clubs from England and Wales. It forms levels 2 to 4 on the British basketball pyramid, in line with the Scottish Basketball Championship, sitting directly below the top tier British Basketball League.\nFor the 2021-22 season, the league will have teams split across three levels: \nThe league also runs the English Women's Basketball League, with Division 1 and Division 2 North and South, and a junior structure with over 630 teams competing in Under-18s, Under-16s, Under-14s and Under-12s leagues.\nThere is no promotion and relegation between the National League and the British Basketball League (BBL), which operates a franchise system. Despite this, several teams have been successful in making the step up from the National League to the BBL in recent years, most notably the Plymouth Raiders and the Bristol Flyers.\nCompetitions.\nNational Basketball League\nPlayoffs\nNational Cup\nHistory.\n1960–1972.\nIn 1960 a National Basketball League was introduced with nine members – Borehamwood Bullets, Watford Royals, Nottingham Dodgers, Aspley Old Boys (Nottingham), Birmingham Athletic Institute, Birmingham Dolobran, Doncaster Panthers, Manchester YMCA Comets, and Billingham Tech. Watford Royals won the first National league in 1960-61. Two of the strongest teams in the country at the time were London Central YMCA and London Poly. Neither of these London based teams felt it necessary to join the National Basketball League when the local competition in London was so strong.\nA change of format in 1965-66 produced three sections, with a total of 16 teams, including two from Scotland; with a change of name to the British Basketball League known as the ‘Rosebowl’.\n&lt;br&gt;By 1972, the Scots had their own thriving National League, though also competing in the \"Rose Bowl\", but when a London team, Sutton, defeated Edinburgh's Boroughmuir Barrs in the 1972 Final, the Basketball Association decided that it was time to relaunch the idea of an English National League.\n1972–1986.\nIn 1972 the National League truly took off. The first season comprised just six clubs, plucked from regional and district leagues around the country, and was run in effect as a trial league. The six teams consisted of London-based teams Avenue Leyton and Sutton, Sheffield YMCA Scorpions and Liverpool Bruno Roughcutters from the North, Midlands club Loughborough All-Stars and touring team RAF Fliers.\nAfter several successful seasons, expansion was implemented to 10 teams, and 1975 saw the addition of Division 2. The 1978–79 season was the first to adopt the post-season playoff format, while a year later the National Trophy was created.\n1987–1993.\nIn 1987, there was a breakaway by the league's elite clubs looking to formulate a fully professional league in the United Kingdom. The new league, operated by a new body, British Basketball League, was established as the country's top and only fully professional basketball league. The National League became the country's second tier competition. Initially, there was promotion and relegation between the BBL and the National League. The new league was sponsored by Carlsberg and was known as the Carlsberg League.\n1993–2000.\nIn 1993, the NBL restructured once again after the top division reverted to the name BBL Championship. Because of this, the lower divisions were renamed and restructured to fit accordingly. From the 1993-94 British Basketball League season, Division 1 was renamed as the Budweiser Basketball League (BBL), thus having a domino effect where the previous Division 2 was rebranded as NBL Division 1 and Division 3 became Division 2, forming the bottom of the three-tiered National League structure.\nThat season also saw the last relegation between the top-two divisions (BBL and Division 1), as last-placed Oldham Celtics were demoted into the new Division 1 for 1994–95. Their replacements were Sheffield Forgers and Leopards, which signalled the start of the current 'buy-in' policy operated by the BBL, whereby teams can only buy a place in the league, operating a franchise system. 1997 saw the addition of Division 3 to the structure, welcoming new teams such as Reading Rockets, Taunton Tigers and the Manchester Giants B team.\n2000–2003.\nIn 1999, the BBL restructured with a north–south conference system, and the following year the National Basketball League replaced Division 1 with the eight-team NBL Conference as the second-tier after the BBL. Subsequently, Division 2 became Division 1 and Division 3 became Division 2, with the addition of a new Division 3 forming effectively the fifth-tier of the structure.\nHowever Division 3 only lasted for one season, as another reorganisation took place the following year, in 2001, which saw an expanded NBL Conference and Division 1, while Divisions 2 and 3 merged to form a regionalised format, with Division 2 North and Division 2 South. In 2003, after three seasons, the BBL ditched its North-South Conference format, and reverted to a single league of ten clubs. During the same year, the National Basketball League was rebranded as the English Basketball League, and once again was restructured with a new format.\nSince 2003.\nThe Conference was disbanded, and EBL reverted the National Leagues to EBL Division 1, Division 2 and a regionalised North-South Division 3, with Division 4 (a reincarnation of the one-time old Division 3 of 2000) returning to the fold in 2006. In 2019–20, a regionalised North-South Division 2 was introduced, with Divisions 3 and 4 merging and the latter disappearing once again."

        "title": "North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball",
        "text": "The North Carolina Tar Heels Men's basketball program is a college basketball team of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Tar Heels have won six NCAA championships (1957, 1982, 1993, 2005, 2009, and 2017) in addition to a 1924 Helms Athletic Foundation title (retroactive). North Carolina has won a record 133 NCAA tournament matchups while advancing to 31 Sweet Sixteen berths (since 1975), a record 21 Final Fours, and 12 title games. It is the only school to have an active streak of reaching the National Championship game for nine straight decades (no other school has done it in more than six straight) and at least two Final Fours for six straight decades, all while averaging more wins per season played (20.7) than any other program in college basketball. In 2012, ESPN ranked North Carolina No. 1 on its list of the 50 most successful programs of the past fifty years.\nNorth Carolina's six national championships are third-most all-time, behind UCLA (11) and Kentucky (8). UNC has also won eighteen Atlantic Coast Conference tournament (ACC) titles, and thirty-three ACC regular season titles. The program has produced many notable players who went on to play in the NBA, including four of ESPN's top 74 players of all-time: Michael Jordan, James Worthy, Vince Carter, and Bob McAdoo (tied for most with UCLA). Many Tar Heel assistant coaches and players have gone on to become head coaches elsewhere.\nFrom the Tar Heels' first season in 1910–11 through the start of the 2021–22 season, the program has amassed a .735 all-time winning percentage (second highest all-time), winning 2,294 games and losing 829 games in 111-plus seasons. The Tar Heels also have the most consecutive 20-win seasons, with 31 from the 1970–71 season through the 2000–01 season. On March 2, 2010, North Carolina became the second college basketball program to reach 2,000 wins in its history. The Tar Heels are currently 3rd all-time in wins. The Tar Heels are one of only four Division I men's basketball programs to have achieved 2,000 victories. Kentucky, Kansas, and Duke are the other three.\nCarolina has played 182 games in the NCAA Tournament. The Tar Heels have appeared in the NCAA Tournament championship game twelve times, and have been in a record 21 NCAA Tournament Final Fours. The Tar Heels have been selected to the NCAA Tournament 53 times (second-most all-time), and have amassed 133 victories (most all-time). North Carolina won the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in 1971, and has appeared in two NIT Finals with six appearances in the NIT Tournament. Additionally, the team has been the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament eighteen times, the latest being in 2024 (most No. 1 seeds all-time).\nNorth Carolina has been ranked in the top 25 of the AP Poll an all-time record 927 weeks, has beaten AP No. 1 ranked teams a record fourteen times, has the most 25-win seasons with 38, and has the most consecutive top-three ACC regular season finishes with 37. North Carolina has ended the season ranked in the top 25 of the AP Poll 51 times and in the top 25 of the Coaches' Poll 53 times. Furthermore, the Tar Heels have finished the season ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll six times and ranked No. 1 in Coaches' Poll seven times. In 2008, the Tar Heels received the first unanimous preseason No. 1 ranking in the history of either the Coaches' Poll or the AP Poll.\nTeam history.\nEarly years (1910–1953).\nNorth Carolina played its first game on January 27, 1911, beating Virginia Christian 42–21 at Bynum Gymnasium, the team's home from 1911 to 1923. The team's first coach was Nat Cartmell. Cartmell was charged with illegally playing dice with known gamblers and was fired after the 1913–14 season. He would be replaced by Charles Doak.\nIn the 1914–15 season, UNC joined the SAIAA, and would compete in the conference through the 1920–21 season. The 1917–18 team went 9–3 (7–0 at home) to finish 3rd in the SAIAA. On January 24, 1920, North Carolina beat Trinity College (Duke), 36–25, in the first-ever game of the Carolina-Duke rivalry.\nSoCon years.\nIn 1921, the school joined the Southern Conference. Overall, the Tar Heels played 32 seasons in the Southern Conference from 1921 to 1953. During that period, they won 304 games and lost 111 for a winning percentage of 73.3%. The Tar Heels won the Southern Conference regular season title 9 times and the Southern Conference tournament 8 times.\nIn 1924, the Tar Heels moved to the Tin Can for home games. From 1924 to 1938, UNC would go 130–20 (.867 winning percentage) at the Tin Can. Rudimentarily built of steel, attempts to heat the Tin Can failed, with ice often forming inside: \nOn February 29, 1924, UNC beat Kentucky, 41–20, in the first-ever game of the Kentucky–North Carolina rivalry. The 1923–24 Tar Heels squad went 26–0, and was awarded a national championship by the Helms Athletic Foundation in 1943 and later by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. In North Carolina's first five seasons in the SoCon (from 1921–22 to 1925–26), they went 96–17, won four SoCon regular season championships, and four SoCon tournament championships. Their fast style of play and stingy defense earned these teams the nickname \"White Phantoms\", coined by sportswriter Oscar Bane Keeler of \"The Atlanta Journal\", used as an alternative nickname for the Tar Heels through 1950.\nCartwright Carmichael was the first Tar Heel to earn first-team All-America honors in any sport in 1923, and was again selected in 1924. Jack Cobb was UNC's first three-time All-America (1924, 1925, 1926), and was named Helms Foundation Player of the Year in 1926. George Glamack followed suit in 1940 and 1941, being named Helms Foundation Player of the Year also. Both Cobb and Glamack are honored with their numbers being retired (Cobb did not have a number).\nIn 1939, the Tar Heels relocated their home arena to the Woollen Gymnasium, where they would play until 1965. On March 21, 1946, under Hall of Fame coach Ben Carnevale and All-Americans Hook Dillon and Jim Jordan, North Carolina beat NYU, 57–49, for their first win in the NCAA Tournament ever. Later in the 1946 NCAA tournament, UNC advanced to their first ever Final Four. Oklahoma A&amp;M would beat UNC, 43–40, in the championship game.\nFor most of the first four decades of the program's history, North Carolina had very little consistency at the head coaching position, reflecting the lack of emphasis on the sport in much of the South at the time. The first coach, Cartmell, doubled as the track coach. From 1923 to 1926, three coaches led the program in as many years. Norman Shepard led the team to an undefeated season in 1923–24 while attending law school. He was succeeded by one of his players, medical student Monk McDonald, who in turn gave way to Harlan Sanborn. Other early coaches included baseball coaches Charles Doak and James Ashmore and assistant football coach Bill Lange. All told, from 1910 to 1946, no coach stayed in Chapel Hill longer than five years. Carnevale, who led UNC to its first Final Four, left after only two years. Tom Scott ran the program for six years from 1946 to 1952, but was pushed out in favor of Frank McGuire after two consecutive losing years.\nFrank McGuire (1953–1961).\nThe modern era of Tar Heel basketball began in 1952, when Scott was pushed out after two consecutive losing seasons in favor of St. John's head coach Frank McGuire. School officials wanted a big-name coach to counter the rise of North Carolina State under Everett Case.\nOn December 1, 1952, McGuire coached his first game at UNC with a 70–50 win over The Citadel. In 1953, North Carolina split from the Southern Conference and became a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. On December 12, 1953, UNC beat South Carolina, 82–56, in their first ACC game ever. On December 14, 1955, UNC routed then-No. 5 Alabama 99–77. It was UNC's first defeat of a nonconference opponent ranked in the top 10 of a major media poll. On January 14, 1956, All-American Lennie Rosenbluth scored 45 points in a 103–99 win at Clemson. On February 24, 1956, Rosenbluth had 31 points in a 73–65 win over Duke to clinch UNC's first-ever ACC regular-season title (shared with N.C. State). The following season, in 1956–57, Lennie Rosenbluth scored 40 in a Tar Heel win at Duke to finish with a perfect 24–0 regular season record (14–0 in ACC). Rosenbluth was named 1957 Helms Foundation Player of the Year. Furthermore, in 1957, the Tar Heels won their first ACC Tournament and first NCAA Championship. On March 23, 1957, No. 1 North Carolina beat Wilt Chamberlain and No. 2 Kansas, 54–53, in triple overtime as Carolina capped off a perfect 32–0 season as national champions. C.D. Chesley, a Washington, D.C. television producer, piped the 1957 championship game in Kansas City to a hastily created network of five stations across North Carolina—the ancestor to the longstanding syndicated ACC football and basketball package from Raycom Sports—which helped prove pivotal in basketball becoming a craze in the state. The title game was the only triple overtime final game in championship history, which followed a triple overtime North Carolina defeat of Michigan State 74–70 the previous night.\nIn 1961, the Tar Heels were placed on NCAA probation for a year for violating \"provisions prohibiting excessive entertainment\" of prospective players and providing \"improper financial assistance\" to the parents of players. As a result, they were barred from the 1961 NCAA tournament and also withdrew from the 1961 ACC tournament. Following the season, Chancellor William Aycock forced McGuire to resign. As a replacement, Aycock selected one of McGuire's assistants, Kansas alumnus Dean Smith.\nDean Smith (1961–1997).\nOn December 2, 1961, Carolina beat Virginia, 80–46, in Dean Smith's first game as head coach. Smith's early teams were not nearly as successful as McGuire's had been. His first team went only 8–9, the last losing season UNC would suffer for 40 years. On January 13, 1964, All-American Deakon Patrick scored 40 and had 28 rebounds in 97–88 win over Maryland. On December 4, 1965, UNC beat William and Mary, 82–68, in the first game played at UNC's new home, Carmichael Auditorium. On December 16, 1965, Bobby Lewis scored a current UNC-record 49 points in a 115–80 win over Florida State. Smith's first five teams never won more than 16 games. This grated on a fan base used to winning; in 1965 some of them even hanged him in effigy. Smith would go on to take the Tar Heels to a reign of championships and national dominance. On March 17, 1967, North Carolina beat Princeton for Dean Smith's first NCAA Tournament win. Later, in the 1967 NCAA tournament, UNC beat Boston College to advance to Dean Smith's first Final Four, where they would lose to Dayton in the national semifinal. In 1968, Carolina appeared in their second consecutive Final Four. On March 23, 1968, they lost to Lew Alcindor and UCLA for the national title. On March 15, 1969, All-American Charlie Scott hit the game-winning jumper at the buzzer to beat Davidson, 87–85, to advance North Carolina to their third consecutive Final Four. On March 27, 1971, Bill Chamberlain scored 34 points as UNC beat Georgia Tech, 84–66, to win the NIT. On March 18, 1972, Carolina beat Penn, 73–59, to advance to their 4th Final Four in 6 years. All-American Bob McAdoo had 24 points and 15 rebounds, but fouled out with 13 minutes to play, as UNC lost to Florida State in the national semifinal. On March 26, 1977, the Tar Heels, back in the Final Four, edged UNLV, 84–83, in the national semifinal. Carolina, in the championship two days later, lost to Marquette, 67–59. On February 25, 1978, co-consensus National Player of the Year Phil Ford scored 34 points in his final game at Carmichael Auditorium, an 87–83 win over Duke. North Carolina returned to the Final Four in 1981. In the national semifinal, All-American Al Wood scored 39 in a win over Virginia. UNC would lose in the NCAA championship game to Indiana.\nThe following year, North Carolina won their second NCAA championship. On March 29, 1982, Final Four MOP James Worthy scored 28 points and Michael Jordan hit the game-winning shot with 17 seconds to play as Carolina beat Georgetown, 63–62, to win Dean Smith's first national championship. On January 18, 1986, North Carolina beat Duke, 95–92, in the first game played in UNC's new arena, the Dean Smith Center. On March 24, 1991, Carolina beat Temple, 75–72, to advance to the Final Four for the first time since 1982. In the national semifinal, Carolina fell to former UNC assistant coach Roy Williams and Kansas, 79–73. In 1993, UNC won their third NCAA title. On April 5, 1993, Final Four MOP Donald Williams scored 25 points as Carolina beat Michigan, 77–71, for Dean Smith's second NCAA championship. On March 25, 1995, North Carolina beat Kentucky, 74–61, to advance to another Final Four. UNC would fall to Arkansas in the national semifinal. On March 15, 1997, North Carolina beat Colorado, 73–56, in the NCAA tournament second round for Dean Smith's 877th win, breaking Adolph Rupp's all-time record for coaches. On March 23, 1997, the Tar Heels beat Louisville, 97–74, for another Final Four appearance. Smith would coach his final game, a 66–58 loss to Arizona in the national semifinal, on March 29, 1997. After 36 years as head coach, Smith retired on October 9, 1997. When he retired, Smith's 879 wins were the most ever for any NCAA Division I men's basketball coach (currently 5th all-time). During his tenure, North Carolina won or shared 17 ACC regular-season titles and won 13 ACC tournaments. They went to the NCAA tournament 27 times–including 23 in a row from 1975 to 1997–appeared in 11 Final Fours and won NCAA tournament titles in 1982 and 1993. The 1982 national championship team was led by James Worthy, Sam Perkins, and a young Michael Jordan. The 1993 national championship team starred Donald Williams, George Lynch and Eric Montross. While at North Carolina, Smith helped promote desegregation by recruiting the university's first African American scholarship basketball player, Charlie Scott.\nBill Guthridge (1997–2000).\nSmith unexpectedly retired before the start of practice for the 1997–98 season. He was succeeded by Bill Guthridge, who had been an assistant coach at the school for 30 years, the last 25 as Smith's top assistant. During Guthridge's three seasons as head coach, he posted an 80–28 record, making him tied for the then-NCAA record for most wins by a coach after three seasons. The Tar Heels reached the NCAA Final Four twice, in the 1998 tournament and again in the 2000 tournament. North Carolina reached the Final Four in 2000 as an 8-seed, their lowest seeding in a Final Four appearance.\nMatt Doherty (2000–2003).\nGuthridge retired in 2000 and North Carolina turned to Matt Doherty, the head coach at Notre Dame and a player on the 1982 championship team, to lead the Tar Heels. Doherty had little success while at North Carolina. In his first season, the Heels were ranked No. 1 in the polls in the middle of the Atlantic Coast Conference schedule and finished with a 26–7 record. The bottom fell out the following year, as the Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 8–20, the worst season in school history. They missed postseason play entirely for the first time since the 1965–66 season (including a record 27 straight NCAA Tournament appearances) and finished with a losing record for the first time since 1962 (Dean Smith's first year as coach). They also finished 4–12 in the ACC—only the program's second losing ACC record ever. The 12 losses were six more than the Tar Heels had ever suffered in a single season of ACC play and placed them in a tie for 7th place—the program's first finish below fourth place ever. The season also saw the end of UNC's run of 31 straight 20-win seasons and 35 straight seasons of finishing third or higher in the ACC.\nAfter bringing in one of the top 5 incoming classes for the 2002–2003 season, the Tar Heels started the season by knocking off a top 5 Kansas team and going on to win the Preseason NIT and returning to the AP top 25. North Carolina went on to finish the season 17–15, but a 6–10 record in ACC play kept them out of the NCAA Tournament. Doherty led the Tar Heels to the third round of the NIT, where they ended their season with a loss to Georgetown.\nRoy Williams (2003–2021).\nDespite the turnaround from the year before and the NIT appearance, at the end of the season Matt Doherty was replaced as head coach by Roy Williams. Williams had served as an assistant to Smith for 11 years before a successful 15-year tenure at Kansas, winning 9 conference regular season championships and taking his Jayhawk teams to four Final Fours. Smith himself convinced Williams to return home. Williams had also been courted by Smith for the UNC job when it had been open in 2000, but Williams had promised Nick Collison he would be at Kansas his entire college career and could not bring himself to leave Kansas at that time despite media speculation reporting Williams would take the job in 2000. Williams could not turn his mentor down a second time, so just two weeks after Doherty's resignation, Williams took the Carolina job. Williams was UNC's third coach in six years, the most turnover the program had faced since its early years. The previous two, McGuire and Smith, had covered a 45-year period.\nOn November 22, 2003, Carolina beat Old Dominion, 90–64, in Roy Williams’ first game as head coach. In Williams' first season, the Tar Heels finished 19–11 and were ranked in a final media poll for the first time in three years. They returned to the NCAA tournament and were ousted in the second round by Texas. The following year, on April 4, 2005, the Tar Heels defeated Illinois, 75–70, to win their fourth NCAA title and Williams' first as a head coach. After winning the championship, Williams lost his top seven scorers, but the 2005–06 season saw the arrival of freshman Tyler Hansbrough and Williams was named Coach of the Year. The Tar Heels swept the ACC regular season and tournament titles in 2007 and 2008. The 2008 ACC tournament was the first time North Carolina had ever won the ACC Tournament without defeating at least one in-state rival during the tournament. North Carolina lost in the national semifinals of the 2008 NCAA tournament to Williams' former program Kansas.\nOn December 18, 2008, Tyler Hansbrough scored his 2,292nd career point, breaking Phil Ford's UNC career scoring record. In the 2008–09 season, the Tar Heels won their fifth NCAA title by defeating Michigan State in the championship of the 2009 NCAA men's basketball tournament. The Tar Heels won all six of that year's tournament games by at least 12 points, for an average victory margin of 20.2 points, and only trailed for a total of 10 minutes out of 240 through the entire tournament. Wayne Ellington was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, the fourth Tar Heel so honored.\nThe 2009–2010 Tar Heels struggled throughout the regular season finishing with a 16–15 record, and dropped to No. 3 in Division I in all-time wins. They later lost in the first round of the ACC Tournament, playing in the first \"play-in\" Thursday game for the first time since the ACC grew to 12 teams. The Tar Heels did not receive an NCAA tournament bid, and instead accepted a bid to the NIT. During the season, on March 2, 2010, Carolina beat Miami, 69–62, to become the second school in NCAA history to win its 2,000th game (North Carolina was in its 100th season of basketball at the time of this accomplishment). The Tar Heels made it to the final game of the NIT, losing to Dayton in the final game finishing with a 20–17 record.\nThe 2010–2011 Tar Heels, with the addition of Harrison Barnes, Kendall Marshall, and Reggie Bullock, eighth in the preseason polls, struggled out the gates, starting with a 2–2 record, the worst start since the 2001–02 season. After losses to Illinois and Texas, the Tar Heels fell out of the rankings. The losses of senior Will Graves, to dismissal, and Larry Drew II, to transfer and also the unexpected off-season transfers of David and Travis Wear did not help matters. However, the Tar Heels improved greatly during the conference season, finishing first in the ACC regular season with a 14–2 record. Williams was named Conference Coach of the Year for his efforts of getting his team to work through the adversity to finish strong in the regular season. Also during the season, the term Tar Heel Blue Steel was coined, referencing the Tar Heel men's basketball walk-ons. The term was started by one of the players, Stewart Cooper, in hopes that it would be a replacement for \"walk-ons\" and similar names, and soon enough Roy Williams caught on. North Carolina lost to Duke in the ACC Tournament Final and made a significant run in the NCAA Tournament until they were eliminated in the Elite Eight by Kentucky, finishing with a 29–8 record.\nThe 2011–2012 Tar Heels season started on November 11, 2011, as top-ranked Carolina beat Michigan State, 67–55, on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in San Diego. The Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 32–6, including a 14–2 ACC record to win the conference regular-season championship outright. The team fell to Florida State in the championship game of the 2012 ACC tournament and was a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Regional of the 2012 NCAA tournament; the team reached the Elite Eight and was defeated by Kansas 80–67. Before the Kansas game, the Tar Heels won their previous three games in the NCAA Tournament by an average of 13.7 points. In the second-round game versus Creighton, starting UNC point guard Kendall Marshall broke his right wrist with 10:56 remaining in the second half with UNC leading 66–50. Marshall continued to play by dribbling primarily with his left hand and left the game with two minutes left with UNC leading 85–69. Williams announced the injury at the Creighton post-game press conference. Marshall did not play in UNC's two following games in the NCAA Tournament, a 73–65 overtime win over Ohio in the Sweet 16 and the aforementioned 80–67 loss to Kansas in the Elite Eight.\nWith the departures of several stars from the 2012 team, The Tar Heels would begin a slow climb back to the top following the Elite Eight loss. The 2012–13 season ended with a loss to Kansas in the tournament for the second year in a row. In 2013–14, the Tar Heels became the only team in men's college basketball history to beat every team ranked in the top 4 in the preseason. The Tar Heels would finish 24–10 that year, ending the year by losing to Iowa State in the final seconds of the Round of 32. The 2014–15 team would improve, finishing the year 4th in the ACC and a Sweet 16 appearance, where they would lose to the Wisconsin. It was also the year that North Carolina would add Joel Berry II and Justin Jackson to the roster, who were both key contributors to the 2017 National Championship squad.\nIn 2015–16, led by seniors Marcus Paige and Brice Johnson, the Tar Heels earned their 30th ACC regular season title, 18th ACC tournament title, and 19th Final Four. They also appeared in their 10th NCAA title game, in which they lost on a buzzer beater to Villanova, despite Marcus Paige's dramatic three-pointer to tie the game with 4.7 seconds left. The Tar Heels finished with a 33–7 overall record and a 14–4 ACC record.\nThe following year, the Tar Heels were ranked No. 6 in the AP preseason poll, having lost Paige and Johnson but retaining 2016 ACC Tournament MVP Joel Berry II as well as forwards Kennedy Meeks and Isaiah Hicks. After early season losses to Indiana and Kentucky, the Tar Heels won their 31st ACC regular season title. Despite never being ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll and losing to Duke in the semifinals of the ACC tournament, the Heels earned a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. On March 26, 2017, Luke Maye hit a jump shot with 0.3 seconds left to beat second-seed Kentucky, 75–73, to advance to Carolina's record 20th Final Four. On April 3, 2017, Final Four MOP Joel Berry II scored 22 points as UNC beat Gonzaga, 71–65, to give Williams his 3rd national championship, surpassing mentor Dean Smith for NCAA Tournament championships. Just as in the previous year, the Tar Heels finished with a 33–7 overall record and a 14–4 ACC record.\nIn 2017–18, the Tar Heels were ranked at No. 9 in the AP and Coaches poll. Forwards Isaiah Hicks, Kennedy Meeks, Tony Bradley, and Justin Jackson had left, while the team added Cameron Johnson. This season, the team did not win the ACC regular season or tournament title. However, the Heels earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament and ended the season 26–11 after being eliminated by Texas A&amp;M in the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament.\nIn the 2018–19 season, the Tar Heels were led by freshman point guard Coby White, and seniors Luke Maye and Cameron Johnson. The Tar Heels were co-ACC regular season champions with Virginia, earned another Number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, and made it to the Sweet Sixteen round before being eliminated by the Auburn Tigers.\n2019–20 was an unusually down year for the Tar Heels, only winning 14 games and being swept by arch-rival Duke in the regular season. Freshman point guard Cole Anthony's knee injury and a lack of depth on the bench proved devastating for the Tar Heels, as they were unable to carry momentum through ACC play, losing several games on last second shots after starting the season 6–1. The Tar Heels made it to the second-round of the ACC tournament before losing to Syracuse in what would turn out to be the final ACC tournament game played before the cancellation of the rest of the 2019–20 season due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. Williams passed Smith's mark of 879 all-time wins in the COVID-shortened season.\nHeading into the 2020–21 season, expectations were high after the lackluster, injury-filled performance of the season prior. Coming into the season with a talented freshman recruiting class, the Tar Heels looked to rebound from their 14–19 record. Senior Garrison Brooks was picked as the preseason ACC Player of the Year yet failed to live up to the preseason hype. Sophomore forward Armando Bacot led the Tar Heels in scoring, and the emergence of freshman Kerwin Walton provided the Tar Heels with an outside shooter that had been missing on the previous year's team. However, the Heels stumbled out of the starting block, beginning conference play with an 0–2 record in the ACC. However, the Tar Heels rebounded, and returned the favor to the Blue Devils, sweeping them in the two regular season matchups. Freshman guard Caleb Love scored 25 points and 7 assists against Duke in Durham, breaking an at-Duke assist record set by Ty Lawson in 2009. On February 27, 2021, Williams earned his 900th career victory as a head coach against Florida State, becoming the fastest coach to reach that mark, over the fewest number of games. The Tar Heels finished with a record of 18–11, losing to Wisconsin in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\nOn April 1, 2021, Roy Williams announced his retirement as the head coach of the Tar Heels after 48 years in coaching and 33 years as a collegiate head coach, 18 of which came at the helm of his alma mater. Williams ended his coaching career with 903 career wins, 485 of which came at Carolina, and three national championships, all as the Tar Heel head coach. At the time of his retirement, Williams was third all-time in NCAA Division I victories. Williams is the first coach to earn 400 or more wins at two different schools. Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham announced that evening that a search for the next head coach would begin immediately, with the search being headed up by Cunningham and UNC-Chapel Hill chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz.\nHubert Davis (2021–present).\nFour days after Williams retired, assistant coach and former Tar Heel player Hubert Davis was hired as his successor. Davis, the nephew of Tar Heel and NBA great Walter Davis, became the first African-American to lead the program. After an up-and-down start to the regular season that included some blowout losses, Davis' Tar Heels turned a corner in the latter part of ACC conference play. With a 70–63 victory against Louisville on February 21, 2022, Davis reached 20 wins in his first season as head coach. The team coupled the renewed energy and intensity with a shock 94–81 upset victory over Duke in Mike Krzyzewski's final home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium. The Tar Heels earned an 8 seed in the NCAA tournament and upset the East Region's No. 1 seed, Baylor, in the second round, despite the ejection of star forward Brady Manek following a flagrant foul. The Tar Heels defeated UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen and Saint Peter's in the Elite Eight to earn a trip to the 2022 Final Four in New Orleans. In a rematch of the regular season finale against Duke, the Tar Heels defeated Duke 81–77 in the national semifinal in Mike Krzyzewski's final game as a head coach. The Tar Heels faced the Kansas Jayhawks in the National Championship game, during which they were unable to capitalize on a double-digit halftime lead and were defeated by a final score of 72–69, finishing the season as National Runner-Up. The team was preseason #1 the following season but never could find much consistency finishing with a disappointing 20–13 record and declining an NIT bid. Because of this, they became the first preseason #1 team to miss the tournament since it expanded to 64 teams in 1985. After Caleb Love and others decided to transfer after the season, Davis looked to the transfer portal to improve the team's fortunes. They landed Harrison Ingram from Stanford University, and Cormac Ryan, a graduate transfer student from Notre Dame University, while also landing Elliot Cadeau, who was considered the top point guard in the class of 2024. The changes in personnel definitely helped as the Tar Heels finished the regular season 25-6 and atop the ACC standings at 17-3 for their 33rd conference title in school history. Along with sweeping their archrivals, Duke Blue Devils Hubert Davis was voted ACC coach of the year while senior RJ Davis was voted ACC player of the year.\nThe Carolina Way.\nDean Smith was widely known for his idea of \"The Carolina Way\", in which he challenged his players to \"Play hard, play smart, play together\". \"The Carolina Way\" was an idea of excellence in the classroom, as well as on the court. In Coach Smith's book \"The Carolina Way\", former player Scott Williams said, regarding Dean Smith: \"Winning was very important at Carolina, and there was much pressure to win, but Coach cared more about our getting a sound education and turning into good citizens than he did about winning.\" \"The Carolina Way\" was evident in many practices the players would implement, including pointing to the player who assisted in a basket, giving him credit as an act of selflessness. This \"Thank the Passer\" practice is used throughout basketball today.\nStreaks.\nThe Tar Heels own several notable streaks in the history of college basketball. They appeared in either the NCAA Tournament or National Invitation Tournament (NIT) every year from 1967 to 2001. This includes 27 straight appearances in the NCAA tourney from 1975 (the first year that more than one team in each conference was assured of a tournament bid) to 2001—the longest such streak in tournament history until it was broken by Kansas in March 2017. The Tar Heels also notched 37 straight winning seasons from 1964 to 2001, the third-longest such streak in NCAA history, behind UCLA's streak of 54 consecutive winning seasons from 1948 to 2001, and Syracuse's streak of 46 seasons. They also finished .500 or better for 39 years in a row from 1962 (Dean Smith's second year) to 2001, the third-longest such streak in NCAA history, behind Kentucky's streak of 61 consecutive seasons from 1926 to 1988 (the Wildcats were barred from playing in 1952–53 due to NCAA violations) and UCLA's 54-season streak.\nFrom the ACC's inception in 1953 to 2001, the Tar Heels did not finish worse than a tie for fourth place in ACC play. By comparison, all of the ACC's other charter members finished last at least once in that time. From 1965 to 2001, they did not finish worse than a tie for third, and for the first 21 of those years they did not finish worse than a tie for second.\nAll of these streaks ended in the 2001–02 season, when the Tar Heels finished 8–20 on the season under coach Matt Doherty. They also finished tied for 7th in conference play, behind Florida State and Clemson—only their second losing conference record ever (the first being in the ACC's inaugural season).\nAdditionally, the Tar Heels went 59–0 all-time in home games played against the Clemson Tigers (the NCAA record for the longest home winning streak against a single opponent). The Tar Heels' all-time home winning streak against Clemson lasted until the 2019–2020 season where Clemson stunned the Tar Heels in overtime, 79–76. Until the 2010 ACC tournament, North Carolina was the only program to have never played a Thursday game in the ACC tournament since it expanded to a four-day format.\nThe Tar Heels have three stretches of being ranked for more than 100 consecutive weeks in the AP Poll. They spent 172 consecutive weeks in the rankings from the start of the 1990–91 season until early in the 1999–2000 season, the second-longest streak in college basketball history at the time behind only UCLA's run of 231 consecutive weeks from 1966 to 1980. That streak has since been passed by Duke's run of 200 consecutive weeks from 1997 to 2007 and Kansas' 231 consecutive weeks from 2009 to 2021. They were also ranked for 171 consecutive weeks from 1973 to 1983, and for 106 consecutive weeks from 2014 to 2020.\nBy the numbers.\nVictories over AP No. 1 team.\nNorth Carolina has 14 victories over the AP number one ranked team.\nHonored and retired jerseys.\nRetired numbers.\nEight players (including Jack Cobb, whose jersey did not have a number) have had their numbers retired. Tyler Hansbrough's number 50 is the eighth to be retired, after he won all six major player of the year awards during the 2007–08 season.\n51 former North Carolina men's basketball players are honored in the Smith Center with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Of the 51 honored jerseys, eight are retired.\nHonored jerseys.\nIn addition to the eight retired jerseys, an additional 43 jerseys are honored. Joel Berry II, Justin Jackson, and RJ Davis most recently qualified to have their jerseys honored.\nTo have his jersey honored, a player must have met one of the following criteria:\nNotable players and coaches.\nTar Heels inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nTo date thirteen Tar Heels have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame\nCurrent players in international leagues.\n\"Source:\"\nRivalries.\nOther major programs.\nUNC alumni defeated UCLA alumni 116–111 in an exhibition game in Los Angeles, CA on June 29, 1987.\nCarolina Basketball Museum.\nThe Carolina Basketball Museum is located in the Ernie Williamson Athletics Center and contains . It was built to replace the old memorabilia room in the Dean Smith Center. Designed by Gallagher &amp; Associates, the cost of construction was $3.4 million. The museum opened in January 2008.\nUNC junior varsity basketball team.\nThe UNC junior varsity basketball team was originally used at North Carolina as freshmen teams because freshmen were not allowed to play on the varsity team until the NCAA granted freshmen eligibility in the Fall of 1972.\nAfter most schools decided to disband their J.V. squads, North Carolina's athletic department opted to keep the team so that non-scholarship students were given the chance to play basketball for UNC. North Carolina also uses their J.V. team as a way for varsity assistant coaches to gain experience as head coaches, such as the current coach, Hubert Davis. Roy Williams was a J.V. coach for eight years before he was hired at Kansas.\nStudents at UNC are only allowed to play on the team for two years, and then they are given a chance to try out for the varsity. The J.V. team also serves as a way for coaches to evaluate players for two years on the J.V. so they will better know what to expect when they try out for varsity later in their careers.\nUNC's J.V. team plays a combination of teams from Division II and III schools, some community colleges, and a few prep schools from around the North Carolina area."

        "title": "Boston College Rugby Football Club",
        "text": "The Boston College Rugby Football Club, or BCRFC, is a collegiate rugby union team that represents Boston College. It competes in the East Coast Rugby Conference (ECRC). Like other Boston College athletic teams, BC ruggers are called the Boston College Eagles. With over 90 members, BC Rugby is one of the largest athletic teams at Boston College.\nFounded in 1968, and with league play every fall and tournaments during the spring, BCRFC fields three sides – A, B, and Developmental – with over 80 players participating each year. BCRFC nears its 50th anniversary and has produced All Americans as well as players for the USA Eagles national team. The Eagles compete in the East Coach Rugby Conference each fall, against rivals AIC, Northeastern, Dartmouth, Fairfield, and UMass. Since 2013, Robert Conway has been the head coach of the Eagles.\nHistory.\nThe Boston College Rugby Football Club celebrated its Centennial Season in 2005, making it one of the oldest rugby teams in the United States. The club was founded in 1968 by Brian King,'71. BCRFC's stated mission is to commit to the highest level of achievement on the pitch, in the classroom, and after graduation. In recent years, an additional emphasis on community service has reinforced the club's commitment to the university's Jesuit ideals. Many BCRFC alumni go on to participate in BC's Old Gold Rugby Football Club.\nCups and competitions.\nCRC 7s.\nInitially making their debut in 2011, the Eagles have been invited to the Collegiate Rugby Championship for the past three years.\nJesuit Cup 7s.\nThe Eagles became the inaugural Jesuit Cup 7s Champions in 2016, beating fellow Collegiate Rugby Championship team Notre Dame in the Championship Game. In 2017, the Eagles lost in the Cup final to Santa Clara University.\nRecords &amp; highlights.\nBC Rugby has consistently performed well, most recently going undefeated for an unprecedented three seasons in 2004, 2005, and 2006. Highlights of 2006 included capturing a Jesuit Invitational crown in Fairfield, Connecticut, going 2–1 at the 40th annual Cherry Blossom Tournament in Washington, D.C., and advancing to the NRU semifinals in Batavia, New York where they were defeated by Harvard. BCRFC finished 8–2 on the 2006 season, placing 3rd in the New England Rugby Football Union. The Eagles' undefeated play in the NERFU's White League gave them 1st place in the league.\nAlso in 2006, Joe Hughes, BC ’03, was selected for the United States National Rugby Team, to compete in the Rugby World Cup in 2007.\nAcademics &amp; community service.\nAlthough it competes at the highest intercollegiate level, Boston College Rugby is officially a club sport as determined by the Boston College Athletics Association. Membership is open to any Boston College undergraduate. As such, BCRFC membership reflects the diversity of Boston College and embodies the University's motto, \"Ever to Excel\". The club's emphasis on academic achievement is evident in an average GPA of 3.4. Members of the Club partake in the university's Honors Program, and many have been inducted into honor societies including Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Sigma Nu. Several have won Fulbright scholarships and other prestigious post-graduate fellowships and awards. In addition to their many academic accomplishments, the BC ruggers fulfill regular service commitments to the Special Olympics, The American Red Cross and Nativity Prep, a tuition-free Jesuit middle school for inner-city students in Boston.\nFacilities.\nBCRFC's historic home pitch is St. John's Field on Boston College's Brighton campus. In the fall of 1994, owing to misunderstanding with the university administration, use of St. John's Field was suspended. During the subsequent 11 years, BC Rugby made use of other facilities including BC's Newton Soccer Complex, Eddie Pellagrini Diamond at John Shea Field, and Alumni Stadium as well as several off-campus locations. These arrangements proved unsatisfactory, and in the fall of 2005, use of St. John's Field was restored. In the early 2010s BCRFC began playing home matches at Alumni Stadium, and since 2018 has made use of the Fish Fieldhouse as a practice facility."

        "text": "The 2004 Budweiser UK Open was the second time the Professional Darts Corporation held the tournament which had quickly earned the nickname the \"FA Cup of Darts\". It was held at Bolton Wanderers' Reebok Stadium between 4–6 June 2004. Budweiser became the tournament's new sponsor.\nRoland Scholten won the title and the tournament featured Phil Taylor's second televised nine-dart finish during his fourth round win over Matt Chapman.\nIt was also notable for marking the TV debuts of Adrian Lewis and Andy Hamilton.\n130 Players qualified via a ranking table played 8 events across the UK &amp; Ireland. \nFriday 4 June 2004.\n1st Round, best of 9 legs.\n128 players started the chase for the title with the lower ranked players. The competition had earned the nickname, \"The FA Cup of Darts\" by the nature of its random draw for each round - and there was the extraordinary pairing of former world champions John Lowe against Keith Deller in the first round. Lowe, who had been missing several tournaments on the circuit at the time opted to withdraw from the event so Deller received a bye into round two.\nSteve Evans against the Welshman Marshall James in the former 1997 world championship finalist by 5–4 in the preliminary round, Alex Roy showed the worst of his form and temperament against \"Odd Job\" James Barton, an electrical tester from Bradford. Barton edged Roy out 5-4. Richie Burnett was very poor against Eamon Davies who comfortably beat the Welshman 5-3. Rod Harrington hadn't qualified for a televised tournament for a year and even though his darts were now not falling out of the board, he narrowly lost out to Bedfordshire's Derek Hunt 5-4.\nAlan Green took out another known face, Leeds player Dave Smith 5-4 and 'The Horse' Reg Harding was also going home early, as was last year's finalist Shayne Burgess who lost 5-2 to Lee Rose. Mick Manning lost 5-1 to Graeme Stoddart and Cliff Lazarenko stormed through to round two courtesy of a 5-1 win over Andrew Davies. Dennis Harbour beat the only lady in the competition Deta Hedman 5-2 and Dutchman Jan van der Rassel started strongly by beating Steve Ritchie 5-1.\nBest match of the first round was former BDO player Colin Monk (now full-time with the PDC) against Lee Palfreyman who was last seen on TV in the Las Vegas tournament two years ago. It was a belter of a game with Monk edging out Palfreyman 5-4. Both players averaged around 96.0 in the match.\n2nd Round, best of 9 legs.\nAnother 32 players entered the fray for the second round and perhaps not quite as many shocks this time. A slimmed down Alan Warriner who had shed two stones in weight since his last TV appearance got off to a shaky start trailing 3-0 to Eddie Lovely. However the \"Ice Man\" dug deep and ended up the winner 5-4.\nThe previous year's local hero Paul Williams was edged out 5-4 by Ian Covill and other local 'The Natural' Les Fitton stormed to a 5-0 win over Tony Smith. Matt Clark went through as did Tom Kirby 5-3 against Keith Wetton. \"Fat Boy\" Andy Keen took out Simon Whatley 5-2 and Mark Landers beat Tony Wilson 5-1. \"Uncle Fester\" Ritchie Buckle lost out 5-4 to David Platt, who was a \"9 dart\" challenge qualifier for the 2003 world championship.\nTracking those who came through from the first round, \"Odd Job\" James Barton won again by beating Alex MacKay 5-4. Dennis Harbour also won again beating the fancied Welshman Wayne Atwood 5-4. \"Big\" Cliff Lazarenko took out Graeme Stoddart 5-3 and Colin Monk had a slightly easier game this time beating Mark Holyoake 5-2.\nSaturday 5 June.\n3rd Round, best of 15 legs.\nInto Saturday and enter all those who qualified in the top places during the regional finals. The format was now best of 15 legs, so a bit more time to settle down and play for the seasoned dart players.\nDarren Webster went down 5-0 to James Wade and it looked all over. However he amazingly pulled the match back to 5-5 before Wade ultimately squeezed through 8-7. Mark Dudbridge and Roland Scholten were neck and neck at 4-4 with all legs going with the throw, Dudbridge even managing the first six perfect darts of a potential 9 darter. However Scholten took a leg against the throw and then stormed ahead to an 8-5 win.\nFriday's hero James Barton finally met his match against rising star Mark Walsh who went into round four with an 8-3 win. However Cliff Lazarenko notched up his third win of the tournament edging out Robbie Green 8-7.\nWayne Mardle appeared to struggle for a while against Vic Hubbard before winning through. He joked with interviewer Helen Chamberlain that his wayward throws into the fives were a tactic. Mardle also commented that he is now a full-time pro having quit his accounts job in the City of London.\nDennis Priestley looked to be in good form as he edged out Terry Jenkins 8-7. Priestley commented that while playing on a 'minor' board that the noise and calling from the main stage was off putting. He also said that he was probably the only player brave enough to voice his opinion on this matter!\nLes Fitton again produced a whitewash beating Steve Parsons 8-0. That was 13 legs on the trot to 'The Natural' without a loss! John Part took out Eamon Davies 8-4 and commented that his World no. 1 ranking could be a bit false. He suggested we wait for the official rankings after the World Matchplay to see who really is top of the pile.\nPhil Taylor had a difficult match against Steve Maish, a player soaring up the PDC rankings list. Taylor won 8-3 but averaged only around 93.0. A bit of Taylor magic was evident though as he took out a 170 - the highest finish. Maish threw six perfect darts and perhaps thought of a 9-darter. He said to Taylor afterwards that he didn't realise he'd have got nothing for it. Taylor later joked, \"If he'd hit it, I'd have given him a tenner.\"\nShock of the round was Peter Manley the no.1 qualifier going straight out to Matt Chapman. 'The Sheriff' Erik Clarys got through to the last 32 as did Peter Evison. No such luck for Lionel Sams who was edged out by Henry O'Neill. Form player before the tournament Colin Lloyd really struggled against 57-year-old Tom Kirby before muscling through 8-6 and Dutchman Jan van der Rassel won his third match taking out Mark Landers 8-4.\n4th Round, best of 15 legs.\nAndy Jenkins whitewashed Martin Freeman 8-0 for a place in the last 16. John Part had a harder task facing the ever improving Bob Anderson. Anderson led 6-5 and then John Part checked out a beautiful 160 to tie the game. This must have rocked Anderson and Part took the final two legs to make it 8-6.\nAlan Warriner raced to a 6-0 lead against Cliff Lazarenko. It was too much for the big man to claw back but he finished with a respectable losing scoreline of 8-4. Ronnie Baxter sailed through to the last 16 as did 62-year-old John Magowan.\nColin Lloyd and James Wade was a match that went to the wire. At 7-7 Lloyd had first throw. He threw 40 which tossed the advantage in Wade's direction. Wade then threw only 24 and Lloyd persevered to win the leg and the match.\nBoth Peter Evison and Jan van der Rassel had done well in the tournament thus far and in another 8-7 game, \"The Fen Tiger\" just eclipsed the impressive Van Der Rassel. Alan Caves beat Dennis Smith 8-3 and 'The Natural' Les Fitton continued with his strong form to almost get the better of world finalist Kevin Painter. After his 8-6 win Painter said, \"Les is either rubbish or he's brilliant. He's a bit of a spaceship!\"\nMatch of the round had to be Phil Taylor against young Matt Chapman who had taken the scalp of Peter Manley in round three. Taylor won the match 8-2 with an average of 111.0 and made history by taking out his second live televised nine darter, the only player in darts history to do so.\nCommentator John Gwynne's quote of \"He is very-very extraordinary!!\" goes down in darts history along with the nine darter and sums it up. Co-commentator Stuart Pyke noted that Taylor had achieved this without having played a competitive match for six months. The whole of the stadium erupted after the nine darter with the crowd singing for many minutes. Ritchie Buckle was spotted singing along with the crowd and Colin Lloyd stopped his live TV interview to give Taylor a round of applause.\nTaylor felt this one was easy because there was no special prize for a nine darter in the tournament so as he threw the final three darts he thought \"just do it.\" And he did! It was reported afterwards that tournament sponsors Budweiser were to present Taylor with 501 bottles of beer for his achievement!\nSunday 6 June.\n5th Round - Last 16, best of 15 legs.\nDennis Priestley continued at the UK Open with a return to impressive form really first shown at the World Championships at the turn of the year. He went into a 4-0 lead against a lacklustre John Part and Part then picked up his game to make it 4-4. Part took out a 156 checkout to go ahead 5-4 and then Priestley brought the game back level to 6-6. Priestley then set himself up for a possible 9 darter with six perfect darts, but though that wasn't to be he did take the lead 7-6. Then it went to 7-7 after Priestley missed a dart for the match and Part won the deciding leg to win 8-7. Part through but great to see Priestley back and hitting six maxima during the match.\nAndy Jenkins raced off to a 5-0 lead against Colin Monk with an average of over 103.0 but the latter pulled it back to 7-6. Jenkins took the next leg to win 8-6. Alan Warriner also went into the quarter finals beating Alan Caves 8-3.\nDenis Ovens and Roland Scholten was neck and neck all the way until Scholten pulled clear at the end for an 8-6 win. John MaGowan went 6-1 up against Kevin Painter and appeared to have the game won but Painter clawed 7 legs on the trot to win 8-6. Colin Lloyd raced to a 6-2 lead against Ronnie Baxter but the latter pulled the game back to 7-7. Lloyd then won the decider for his place in the quarter finals.\nWayne Mardle went into a 4-2 lead against Phil Taylor but \"The Power\" brought it back to 4-4. At 5-5 Taylor took out a 155 checkout to lead 6-5. The match was neck and neck again going to 7-7. Both players had darts for the match but it was Taylor who hit the double 5 to win. Apparently no love lost between them at the start of the match Phil Taylor seemed to begrudgingly shake Mardle's hand. Apparently at the world championships Wayne Mardle was annoyed that Phil Taylor had brought in a pop star friend to their post match interview. After this game Mardle said, \"I'm throwing down the gauntlet - I'm going to beat him.\" Throughout their post-match interview the players were turned away from each other, Taylor almost with his back to Mardle.\nQuarter-finals, best of 15 legs.\nSteve Beaton started well against Kevin Painter going 4–2 ahead. He maintained this advantage going 7-4 and ultimately 8-5 to win a place in the semi-finals. After the match Beaton said that he'd stopped smoking a few months ago and decided that he wouldn't be practising for the semi-final and that he'd just chill out before the next match.\nAndy Jenkins and Colin Lloyd was a much more tense affair. Jenkins went 3-1 up but Lloyd pulled it back to 3-3. Jenkins then led again at 6-4 but again Lloyd squared the match at 6-6. Jenkins then threw six perfect darts and though the nine darter wasn't on it was enough to lead again at 7-6. He took the match 8-6 and it was an accomplished performance from \"Rocky\" who started four legs with a maximum.\nMatch of the round was undoubtedly Phil Taylor and John Part. The live draw placed them on board two much to Taylor's consternation. Part had played on this board before with all the distractions from the main board, but it was a first for Taylor. Part took an early break of throw to go 3-1 up. Taylor broke back and took it to 3 a piece. Part again went into the lead at 5-3 and Taylor once again squared the match at 5-5, then 6-6. As Part said afterwards he just kept his confidence and self-belief high and this was enough to win this tussle with \"The Power\" 8–6.\nRoland Scholten went 3–1 up against Alan Warriner who had said that he'd changed his darts three times since the world championships. Warriner took three on the trot to go ahead 4–3 before Scholten dug deep to take the next three legs. The match ultimately finished 8–6 to Scholten who said afterwards that he was happy with the way he was playing. Asked about the forthcoming semifinal, Scholten said that he would try to play to his ability and see what happened.\nSemi-finals, best of 15 legs.\nJohn Part and Andy Jenkins was another close game. Part was the first to admit he didn't play well in the match. Jenkins took an early 3-2 lead courtesy of a 121 checkout. Part then clawed ahead and kept a one leg advantage up until 6-5 when Jenkins then squared the match again. Ultimately 8-7 to Part who said afterwards that he felt Andy Jenkins had control of the match and that he was \"pretty lucky\" to get through to the final.\nSteve Beaton shot out of the starting blocks against \"The Tripod\" Roland Scholten going 3-0 up. However where in the past the Dutchman had caved in during the closing stages of a tournament, this time it was a different Roland Scholten. Beaton only took one more leg in the match which went 8-4 to Scholten.\nFinal, best of 21 legs.\nScholten blasted off to a 6-1 lead in this first to 11 legs race courtesy of some impeccable finishing. Part continued to be somewhat off the boil as Scholten took the match to 8-3. Finally Part seemed to get some rhythm going as he won the next two legs to make it 8-5. Scholten won the next and in the fifteenth leg after a 180 by Scholten, Part threw some really wayward darts. At 10-6, Scholten signalled his intent by throwing back to back 180s and the match and the UK Open title was his, along with the payout cheque of £30,000. Part admitted after the match that Roland deserved to be the champion.\nScholten himself said, \"The competition is so hard. The day really starts at 7:30 and you are on the go until 10:30 at night. It took lots of focusing and concentration. I'm well happy. My form's been doubtful but I took a lot of confidence from the first and second day. When I reached the final I thought that I might as well do it now. I hope it's a turnaround. A brilliant crowd, a long day and thanks very much!\""

        "title": "Equestrian Portrait of the Count-Duke of Olivares",
        "text": "Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, on Horseback () is an oil on canvas painting by Spanish painter Diego Velázquez, made around the year 1636. It has been in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since its inauguration in 1819.\nThis painting is an exception for the style of Velázquez as its design and color are more vigorous and pompous than his usual more somber portraits. The object of the work was to validate the power of Gaspar de Guzman, Count of Olivares and Duke of Sanlúcar la Mayor, known as the Count-Duke of Olivares, the chief minister under Philip IV of Spain, a Spanish nobleman and influential politician.\nDescription.\nOlivares is portrayed on horseback, an honor usually reserved for monarchs that reflects the power he attained as \"valido\" or right hand of the king (equivalent to the current prime minister's office). The picture resembles equestrian portraits Velázquez had painted for the Hall of Realms of the Buen Retiro Palace, though it was not made for this series but rather to display a particular custom of Olivares bound for home. The painting is not dated but was probably painted just after this series, around 1638, and possibly after the Battle of Fuenterrabía, a military success of the Franco–Spanish War that was attributed to Olivares although he was not personally involved. The picture did not join the royal collection at the predecessor of the Museo del Prado until a century later.\nThe Count-Duke wears a wide-brimmed feathered hat and the band of the State; the hand holds a marshal's baton, which marks the direction of the battle. The armor he wears is possibly preserved in the Palace of Liria of Madrid (collection of the House of Alba). The Count-Duke looks at the viewer, making sure all can witness his feat. The figure is viewed from a low viewpoint and his torso is turned back, making it look more slender; Olivares had a massive body and was rather clumsy, as seen in the portraits that Velázquez had done before.\nThe horse raises its front legs, performing a somersault or levade as it looks toward the battlefield. Drawing a diagonal from the hills that can be seen in the landscape, the composition provides energy to the portraiture; in this dynamism, the work reminds of Rubens. This equestrian portrait differs from those made for the royal family and is believed to have been suggested by Olivares; Velázquez had to take particular care, as Olivares was the highest political office of the court (after the king) and had supported him in his early days as a painter in Madrid.\nThe battle in the distance is treated with small spots. The landscape is very schematic, as is typical of Velázquez, with no buildings or characters. Perhaps it is because the painter did not know the town of Hondarribia, where the battle happened as described, although other sources believe the painting does not refer to any particular battle. The hills fade in green and blue tones, providing a feeling of remoteness, for it is said to have a very sharp aerial perspective.\nThe rich chromaticism and treatment of light give the scene a great vitality."

        "title": "Golf in the Year 2000",
        "text": "Golf in the Year 2000, or, What We Are Coming To is an 1892 novel by J. McCullough. It is a specimen of science fiction of the Victorian era, and an example of time travel in fiction. It tells the story of Alexander J. Gibson, who falls into a deep sleep in 1892 and awakens in 2000.\nPlot.\nThe plot follows Gibson as he is introduced to the wonders of the dawning 21st century by his host, the current owner of the house where Gibson lay sleeping for 108 years. Like Gibson, the host is a passionate golf player. Much of the story revolves around the two men's visits to the golf course, where Gibson learns first-hand the radical changes that technology has made to the game. There are golf clubs that automatically keep their user's score, driverless golf caddies or carts, and special jackets, which everyone must wear, that yell \"Fore!\" whenever the player begins his swing.\nAnalysis.\nModern readers are fascinated by the many startlingly accurate \"predictions\" contained in \"Golf in the Year 2000.\" These include bullet trains, digital watches, and television (although those specific terms are not used). It correctly predicts the conversion of the British pound to decimal coins. It notably fails to anticipate modern air travel, instead postulating that undersea trains will cut trans-Atlantic travel time to a few hours. Similarly, Gibson's jest about travel to the Moon is answered with an explanation that this is still a few generations off. It anticipates a form of chemical warfare, but suggests a very different impact.\nOne of the novel's \"predictions\" is the liberation of women. In the book, women have achieved substantial equality with men, but with some remaining and new differences. Gibson learns that the women of 2000 dress like men, hold key positions in business (bank clerks are exclusively female) and government (but not yet prime minister, due to petty rivalries), and in fact do almost all of the work, while the men play golf full-time. In the view of the fictional narrator, this is a true utopia, though he does not find women of the year 2000 to his liking.\nEditions.\nThe book was originally published in London by Unwin in 1892. A rare first edition sold at auction in January 2005 for $2,240 to an American collector of golf memorabilia named James Espinola. The book was reprinted in 1998 by Rutledge Hill Press, and is also available online."

        "title": "British Universities cricket team",
        "text": "The British Universities cricket team was a cricket team whose players were drawn from university students studying in Great Britain. The team played under the title of Combined Universities until 1995. The team played List A cricket from 1975 to 1998 and first-class cricket from 1993 to 2006.\nHistory.\nCombined Universities' first matches in top-level cricket came in the 1975 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, a List A competition. In their first game, on 3 May, they beat Worcestershire County Cricket Club by 66 runs, thanks largely to an outstanding all-round performance by future Pakistan captain Imran Khan, who top-scored with 35 runs and took four wickets for four runs from 8.3 overs as Worcestershire were bowled out for 92 runs. The team played as an Oxford and Cambridge Universities side initially. Players from universities other than Oxford and Cambridge were first selected for the Benson and Hedges Cup in the 1987 season. The first team drawn from the wider university community, to face Hampshire on 2 May 1987, included Nasser Hussain, John Stephenson, Martin Speight and Alan Fordham from Durham, Mike Cann from Swansea and Peter Perera from Exeter. By 1989 there were five players from Durham in the squad but only three from Oxford and Cambridge.\nFrom 1975 to 1992 inclusive the team played only in the Benson and Hedges Cup. Their most successful year was 1989, in which a team led by future England captain Mike Atherton and containing Nasser Hussain, who also went on to captain England, as well as future England Test player Steve James, beat Surrey and Worcestershire in the group stages, their first wins in 13 years. Worcestershire were the defending County Champions and went on to win the 1989 County Championship with seven past or future Test players in their side, yet the match \"constituted a stuffing. Without doubt it is the finest ever limited-overs performance\". The team became the first non-first-class team to reach the knockout stages of the competition and narrowly lost by just three runs against Somerset in the quarter-finals.\nThe team continued to play in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, and in June 1993 played its first first-class cricket match. Their opponents were the touring Australians at The University Parks in Oxford. Combined Universities also played first-class matches against the New Zealanders in 1994 and the West Indians in 1995.\nFrom the 1995 season onwards the team was renamed British Universities, partly to reflect the fact that players were now increasingly coming from outside Oxford University Cricket Club and Cambridge University Cricket Club, both of which have had first-class cricket status since the 19th century. The team played under its new title in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup until the end of the 1998 season when the competition was restructured.\nThey played another 10 first-class matches, all against touring international sides, until their final match in 2006 against the Sri Lankan tourists. The team generally used either Fenner's in Cambridge or the University Parks in Oxford as their 'home' ground.\nFrom 2007, the Marylebone Cricket Club Universities team played games primarily against county second XIs until 2017, including entering the Second XI Championship from 2009 to 2017. This continued the tradition of playing home games at Fenner's or the University Parks, although a number of home games were also played at Leeds University's Weetwood Playing Fields. The MCC Universities team also played against other touring English teams in Dubai in 2013 and in Abu Dhabi in 2014 and 2015.\nTouring sides.\nTeams playing under the names Combined Universities and British Universities have toured overseas on a number of occasions. A Combined Universities side played in the Netherlands in 1987 and a British Universities side played in South Africa in late 1999, playing a number of matches against South African university sides. In 2012 a side played two matches in Pakistan, the first time an overseas touring side had played in Pakistan since the 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team's tour bus which resulted in injuries to seven of the Sri Lankan players and the deaths of eight Pakistanis. A side took part in a student cricket competition in Sr Lanka in April 2013."

        "title": "Fred Williams (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Frederick Richard Williams (born July 1, 1956) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. He was drafted in the 1st round (4th overall) by the Detroit Red Wings in the 1976 NHL draft and 26th overall in the third round of the World Hockey Association draft, by the Hartford Whalers. Williams played in only 44 games at the NHL level. He is the older brother of former NHL player Gord Williams.\nHockey career.\nMajor Junior Hockey.\nAn explosive skater with outstanding stick-handling skill, Fred Williams began his career towards the pro ranks as a 15-year-old in major junior hockey in the Western Canada Hockey League as a centre for his hometown Saskatoon Blades in the 1971–72 season. It was unusual for players of Williams' age to play in the major junior ranks in particular, because of size and experience of older players who were ultimately seeking draft positions in the NHL or at the time, the World Hockey Association. Only one other player on the club, Ralph Klassen was 15 years old, and was selected at #3 overall in 1975 NHL draft. However, Williams, being younger than the majority of players he played with and against in the WCHL, had unusual skills and size for his age, and was selected for the Saskatoon Blades roster for the 1971-72 season, after his first training camp. The previous year, he had been playing Midget hockey in Saskatoon. Despite his recognized talent by the Blades coaching staff, Williams put up mediocre statistics in his first two seasons in the WCHL with only 41 points in a 121 games. However, in the following three seasons as he became a more experienced player and gained more size, Williams would score 36, 70, and 118 points. His efforts guided the Saskatoon Blades to two trips to the playoffs, driving the Blades to the league finals two years in a row, with 63 total playoff points over 37 games. Despite having some marquee players that season, Saskatoon would not win the championship and to this day, still have not won a WHL championship cup. During the 1975-76 WCHL season, Williams was one of the top assist getters in the WCHL with 87, only behind the likes of top players such as Bernie Federko who would go on to illustrious success in the NHL ranks. During his draft year, Williams' excellent skating ability, his solid hockey sense and a consistent scoring touch, he attracted the attention of the Detroit Red Wings, who opted to draft Williams as their first round pick, fourth to be selected overall, in the 1976 NHL draft. The same year, the World Hockey Association's Hartford Whalers drafted Williams 26th overall, in the third round of their draft. The disparity between the NHL's Red Wings' and the WHA's Whalers' draft positions for Williams would guide him to accept a contract offer and an almost guaranteed roster spot on the Red Wings for the 1976-77 NHL season.\nNHL Debut and Minor leagues.\nIn the fall of 1976, Williams attended his first NHL training camp with his draft club, the Detroit Red Wings. Despite Williams strong training camp showing for a player directly out of major junior hockey, Alex Delvecchio, then coach of the Red Wings, along with his coaching staff, opted to send Williams to the minors for more professional experience to hone is game and develop his readiness to enter the National Hockey League. He then started the 1976–77 season with the Rhode Island Reds of the American Hockey League but due to injuries on the Red Wings, he was quickly called up to the big club on October 7, 1976. Expectations from the Wings and the NHL for Williams debut were high as a first round draft pick, and he did not disappoint. He scored his first goal in his first NHL game against the Washington Capitals. The Red Wings, who were playing in one of their most historically dismal seasons with only 16 wins over 80 games, decided to keep Williams up with the team for the remaining 43 games of the regular season, to allow him to gain more NHL experience, as the Red Wings would not make the playoffs. However, in disappointing fashion during his chance to impress Red Wings brass, Williams went on to score only six points in those remaining games in '76-'77 and was subsequently sent down to the Wing's minor league affiliates for the following season on a conditioning stint. Detroit felt that his play was not up to NHL standards, and in spite of his high draft selection and the high expectations which befall a first rounder, he was not contributing to the same level as the likes of Bernie Federko or Don Murdoch who were drafted later than Williams and were having spectacular NHL seasons. Williams continued to flounder while playing for Detroit's minor affiliate Kansas City Red Wings of the Central Hockey League, even trying to play as a defenseman to see if his game and play-making would turn around. However, Williams did not improve and was waived and then released outright by the Red Wings organization at the end of the season. At this time, feeling his heart was not in the game, he decided to retire for the first time in his career . Since he was no longer under contract to Detroit and was a free agent, Williams reconsidered his retirement, and was quickly enticed out of retirement by an attractive offer from the Philadelphia Firebirds of the AHL on September 15, 1979. He played in 35 games for the Firebirds where he scored only 5 goals and contributed 11 assists before being traded to the league leading Maine Mariners. He played is final three seasons for the Mariners scoring 51, 55, and 32 points respectively. Without any NHL suitors for his talents, Williams decided to retire after the 1981–82 season. Unfortunately, Fred Williams garners a distinction among others, to be one of the biggest draft busts in NHL history, never rising to a level of talent or consistency in his game which would have allowed him to play a long career in the NHL. Fred Williams currently resides in Western Canada with his family."

        "text": "The Boston Rowing Marathon is a rowing head race taking place on the third Sunday of September annually in Lincolnshire, England, over the exceptionally long distance of 49.2 km (30.6 miles). The course is along the River Witham from Lincoln to Boston.\nOverview.\nThe event started as a one off in 1946, a pub bet, and was big news for the town. A single coxed four of seniors rowed from central Boston to the Brayford Pool in central Lincoln (against the river flow) and took around six hours. A distance, measured at the time, of 34 miles.   \nOn 26 October 1947, a teenaged coxed four from the Boston Rowing Club, took on the challenge of beating the 1946 time. Aubrey Fox, Deg Borman, Bill Gale and Bill Lockwood (AKA Dennis) completed the course in 4 hrs 11 mins and were each awarded an inscribed tankard by the mayor of Boston, TM Moffatt. In 1948 a solo rower covered the course (time unknown). \nIn 1949, Crowland Rowing Club became involved and the course was reversed to finish at Boston. It was easier to row with the flow and preferable to finish at the boathouse with the pub next door. In 1950 the event was opened to all competitors and has remained so to this day. The event is now organised by Boston Rowing Club. \nThe long distance of the event makes it unique in British rowing and thus attracts a lot of entries; some competing for a time, others only wanting to complete the distance. The event is also unusual in accepting entries from all crews and categories. \nThe current record for the 30.6 mile course is 2 h 59 min 45 s, set in 1991 by a University of London Boat Club men's eight. The race was cancelled in 2000, due to that year's fuel crisis, in 2011 due to an unusually prolific growth of water weed, and again in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021 the event was again cancelled due to Covid-19, but a solo club rower completed the course on the scheduled day.\nCourse.\nThe start is a set of landing stages at Lincoln Rowing Centre, Stamp End Lock, Waterside South, Lincoln. The centre was founded in 2006 in response to marathon being the only rowing hosted in Lincoln. The race follows the straightened Witham downstream to the finish line at Boston Rowing Club boathouse, 660 m north of the first bridges in Boston (overlapping road and rail bridges). One lock is present in the course."

        "title": "English cricket team in South Africa in 1888–89",
        "text": "An English cricket team managed by Major R. G. Warton toured South Africa from December 1888 to March 1889. Warton was a retired British Army officer who had served on the general staff in Cape Town and was a member of the Western Province Cricket Club. He had been invited by local enthusiasts to bring a team of English first-class cricketers to the country. He negotiated with local agents called Billy Simkins and William Milton, who obtained sponsorship from Sir Donald Currie, founder of the Castle Shipping Line. They made all the arrangements while Warton travelled to England and recruited players for the team which, at the time, was known as R. G. Warton's XI.\nThe team was captained by C. Aubrey Smith and included five players with prior international experience in Bobby Abel, Johnny Briggs, Maurice Read, George Ulyett and Harry Wood. Some of the other players, making up the numbers, did not have first-class status and Harry Altham described the team's standard as \"about that of a weak county\".\nTwo of their matches were against a team representative of all South Africa and, in 1897, it was officially decided that these should retrospectively be assigned Test match status. As such, the first is South Africa's inaugural Test and, given that there had been no first-class cricket in the country before 1889, it is the inaugural first-class match played in South Africa.\nThe term \"test cricket\" (in the sense of a test of team strength) was new in 1889 and was first used by \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" in that year's edition. Allocation of retrospective status was bound to be controversial and, in Rowland Bowen's history, he argued that standards in South Africa were so poor that the two matches should not have been rated first-class, let alone Test. As he pointed out, South Africa's tour of England in 1894 was not first-class. Furthermore, when M. W. Luckin wrote the first history of South African cricket in 1914, he considered the 1889 matches to be minor.\nTour summary.\nWarton's XI played a total of twenty matches but only the two retrospective Tests are recognised as first-class. This is because 17 of the games were played against odds, the home team in each case fielding from 15 to 22 players against eleven on the English team. Although the final match on the tour was 11-a-side against South Africa, it was a two-day filler (a first-class match must be scheduled for at least three days). Many of the matches were played on matting as, with rudimentary pitch preparation, surfaces were uneven; they tended to be grassy in coastal areas and hard soli in the interior.\nWarton's XI met sides from four of the South African provinces: Eastern Province, Natal, Transvaal and Western Province. They also played teams representing the cities of Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg, Kimberley, Pietermaritzburg and Port Elizabeth. Even playing against odds, the English team were expected to win all the provincial and city matches but they had four surprising defeats in their first six matches against Cape Town, Kimberley (twice) and Port Elizabeth. They nevertheless won the two Test matches convincingly.\nThe tour was successful in legacy terms as it brought South Africa into international cricket and provided a stimulus for their domestic game. Sir Donald Currie as sponsor was so impressed that he decided to donate the trophy named after him, the Currie Cup, as the prize for winning South Africa's domestic championship. For the 1888–89 season, the English team were asked to award it to the team which had excelled most against them. They chose Kimberley. In 1889–90, the competition proper began with a challenge by Transvaal to Kimberley. A shorter-term benefit for South Africa was that Frank Hearne decided to emigrate to the country, mainly for health reasons, and became a successful coach as well as representing South Africa in Test matches in the 1890s. Financially, the tour was not a success as it failed to make a profit and \"Wisden\" noted that \"it was never intended, or considered necessary, to take out a representative English team for a first trip to the Cape\".\nEnglish squad.\nWarton's XI consisted of fifteen players who were something of a mixed bag given that George Ulyett had already played in 22 Tests against Australia whereas, at the other extreme, six of the players were not registered with any county club. Bobby Abel, Johnny Briggs, Maurice Read and Harry Wood had played Test cricket against Australia. Monty Bowden, Arnold Fothergill, Frank Hearne and Aubrey Smith were established county players.\nCameron Skinner was a comedian who accompanied the party to provide entertainment but nevertheless took part in four of the odds matches. He never played in a first-class match. Neither did Major Warton himself; he played in the final (fill-up) match only on the tour. James Roberts, another occasional player, took part in the first odds match but then had to return home owing to the death of his father and Ulyett was contracted to replace him. Roberts made a single first-class appearance for Middlesex in 1892.\nCharles Coventry, Basil Grieve and Emile McMaster all played against South Africa and so are officially credited as Test players despite never playing in any other first-class matches. Coventry was a career soldier who did play for Worcestershire, then a minor county, in 1886 and for some local or itinerant teams. Grieve and McMaster were former Harrow School pupils who both played for the school team in the 1870s. There is no record of McMaster ever playing for any other team except Warton's XI. In 1892, Grieve played in minor cricket for a team called the Ne'er-do-wells.\nSquad details below state the player's age at the beginning of the tour, his batting hand, his type of bowling, and his County Championship team at the time:\nSouth African selections.\nSouth Africa selected a total of fourteen players for the two matches, all of whom were making not only their Test match debuts but also their first-class debuts. Domestic first-class cricket began in South Africa in the 1889–90 season but none of these players went on to have extensive first-class careers.\nThe greatest number of first-class matches played was eleven by Bernard Tancred, who was a cousin of wicket-keeper Fred Smith. Gus Kempis played in five matches for Natal between 27 December 1889 and 9 January 1890, but he died in Mozambique four months later, aged 24.\nOnly three players (Milton, Smith and Vintcent) played for South Africa again after this season and they totalled three appearances each in their respective Test careers. Milton and Vintcent both played against England in 1891–92. Smith, who played against Lord Hawke's touring team in 1895–96 had the longest Test career span.\nThe details for each player below state his age at the beginning of the English tour, his batting hand, his type of bowling, and his provincial team at the time:\nTest matches.\nFirst Test.\nAt the time, the match was billed as Major Warton's XI \"versus\" a South African XI. It was retrospectively given Test match status and renamed South Africa v England. Played on a green matting wicket in Port Elizabeth, South African captain Owen Dunell won the toss against Aubrey Smith and chose to bat. The game did not last long as the matting wicket did not induce high scores. Around 3,000 spectators attended the first day's play. \"Wisden\" commented on a good all-round performance by the Englishmen with special mentions for Abel and Smith.\nSecond Test.\nAlthough South Africa was a very weak team, the performance by Johnny Briggs who took fifteen wickets for 28 runs in the match was exceptional. Abel made his third century of the tour. Bowden became England's youngest ever Test captain, aged 23 years 144 days. He replaced Smith who had developed a fever. Tancred became the first batsman to carry his bat in a Test match in scoring 26 not out. South Africa were obliged to follow on, but were again quickly dismissed. Briggs' second innings wickets were all bowled."

        "title": "Rugby union in Peru",
        "text": "Rugby union in Peru is a minor sport.\nGoverning body.\nThe national governing body is the Unión Peruana de Rugby (Peruvian Rugby Union)\nThe Peruvian Union.\nOn November 30, 1996, the first university test match was held between the Universidad de Lima and the Pontificia Universidad Catolica, with the former winning 18 to 3. This was the first time that everyone on the pitch, including the referee, was Peruvian.\nTowards the end of 1996 and after a local tournament of seven a side, a new club was founded: the Club de Rugby San Isidro. Thus, fourteen months after having decided to train there were four clubs with their own identity, three of which had their own fields (usually an adapted football field) because the teams are affiliated with institutions. (The Club de Rugby San Isidro had to rent a field in order to train.)\nThe clubs decided to create the Unión Peruana de Rugby on February 11, 1997 to organize all rugby activities and start the promotion and teaching of the sport. The Unión Peruana de Rugby (UPR) started with Néstor Corbetto as President and Diego Zúñiga as Secretary-Treasurer who were elected amongst representatives of the four clubs: Old Markhamians Rugby Club, Universidad de Lima, Pontificia Universidad Católica and the Club de Rugby de San Isidro. Since then, two other clubs have joined the Union: the Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC) and the Newton College Old Boys. A crest depicting a Tumi, superimposed over the Peruvian flag of 1820 is the official UPR emblem\nThe government's Instituto Peruano del Deporte (Peruvian Institute for Sports) resolved in November 1997 to accept the formation of the Commission Deportiva Nacional de Rugby — an officially recognized rugby commission — which is the first step to becoming a recognized federation.\nOn 2002, the Commission Deportiva Nacional de Rugby, was recognized as Federacion Peruana de Rugby, by the IPD.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded rugby game in Peru took place in 1885 at the Lima Cricket and Football Club (LCFC). LCFC still exists, and is nicknamed the Bullfrogs, as a result of having a mixture of British and French players.\nIn 1958 Peru, together with Argentina, Uruguay and Chile participated in the first South American tournament, held in Santiago, Chile. Because there was no IRB-sanctioned rugby union at the time, participation was not officially accepted by Peruvian sport authorities. After this, the impulse of the game seems to have faded.\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and the 1980s, Peruvian rugby had only a handful of sides, with the Lima Cricket and Football Club's Bullfrogs, as the Anglo-French expat team par excellence and the South American opposite number, the Lima Polo Club, mainly consisting of Argentinian and Uruguayan residents. The Bullfrogs' main regular fixture was against the French school, and the occasional ship of the British Royal Navy. and Royal Canadian Navy. There was also a rather short-lived side known as the Tacama Pumas, organized by Peruvian and French employees working in the coastal vineyards of Tacama (three hours south of Lima) . Rugby memorabilia of this period is housed in the clubhouse of the Lima Cricket and Football Club, where photographs of the teams from Argentina, Chile, France and Ecuador who challenged the Bullfrogs during these years are kept.\nRugby was taught sporadically at Newton, Franco Peruano, and San Andres schools. However, only Newton and Markham's teams persisted in teaching rugby. Outside of Lima, there were also two sides in Iquitos.\n1992 - present.\nDue to the interest of some Markham graduates and Mr. David Roberts, a teacher at the school, a team was started called Old Markhamians in 1992. The side had only 15 Peruvians between the ages of 17 and 19, most of whom had never seen a rugby ball in their lives; only 7 of the 15 were really former Markham boys. This team competed with the Bullfrogs (foreigners over 30 years of age) which was the only rugby side left since the 1990s. After Mr. Roberts departure to Britain, the Old Markhamians ceased training due to a lack of facilities and instructors. In 1993 and 1994, three or four games were played for fun and \"old times sake\". This was the seed that those fifteen Peruvian boys germinated.\nSo at the end of 1995 and thanks to their interest, Bruce Allen (director of Markham's primary school) was contacted soon after his arrival in Peru to direct the Old Markhamians side. The side was reformed, with a new projection, and including new players. This was the beginning of a new era in Peru and started the take-off of rugby. On Saturday November 25, an exhibition game was held between the Old Markhamians and former players of that club who now attended the Universidad de Lima at the university football ground. By this time, there were 60 active Peruvian players. Naturally this spurred the formation of a University team, so by March 1996 Peru had two rugby teams practicing together. The Universidad de Lima side encouraged their traditional rival, the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú to form a team.\nAt the same Peruvian rugby got the happy news that in Iquitos, a city in the Peruvian Amazon which can only be reached by plane or river, a side had been formed the Alianza Rugby Club Olimpico (A.R.C.O. Iquitos), thanks to the initiative of Vincent Brack, a Frenchman. They are trying to survive since they have no one to play with and, due to distance, it is expensive to travel to Lima.\nPeruvian rugby internationally.\nSoon after the re–initiation of rugby in Peru, in 1996 contacts were made abroad and an invitation was extended to a first division club in Chile. From then on the Federacion de Rugby de Chile has been especially interested in cooperating with the growth of Peruvian rugby. On June 16, two referees from this federation gave a course updating the rules, and have sent a past-President and a trainer to overlook the growth of Peruvian rugby.\nIn September 1996, a local team had a chance to go abroad to face the adult and youngsters teams in Arica. The games were played on the main field of the Carlos Dittborn stadium (a 1962 World Cup hosting stadium). The following week during the South American Championship U19, the Confederacion Sudamericana (South American Federation) met in Santiago, Chile inviting Peru as an observer.\nA year after this meeting in October 1997, the Unión Peruana de Rugby was formally accepted as a member of the Confederacion Sudamericana (CONSUR) at the meeting held in Mendoza, Argentina. Hereafter Peru has attended all meetings. In the January meeting in Mar del Plata the same year, Mr. Carlos Tozzi of the IRB was contacted. At this meeting, Peru's intervention allowed the presence of Colombia in the meeting.\nAt the Montevideo meeting, as previously agreed, Peru presented Mr. Tozzi and CONSUR members a letter requesting incorporation in the IRB. The letter was faxed to the IRB on April 13, 2000.\nDuring this time three more teams from Chile, one from Japan and a British Royal Navy team visited Peru to play against combined or club sides. Also in 1997, two Peruvian clubs attended seven tournaments held in Arica, Chile. A Peruvian linesman attended the International Sevens Tournament in Renaca, Chile.\nIn September 1999 the Peruvian national side participated in its first international tournament: the first U21 South American tournament in Asuncion, Paraguay.\nIn November, 2000 Peru participated on the first South American group B Tournament, in São Paulo Brazil, with Brazil and Venezuela.\nIn 2001 they played rugby World Cup Australia 2003 Qualifying Rounds, against Brazil, Venezuela, and with Colombia, being this last, the first official IRB game to be played and won in Peruvian grounds.\nWomen's rugby.\nAlthough Peru's women have not yet played test match rugby, they have been playing international sevens rugby since 2004. (Current playing record)."

        "text": "The men's individual was an event held as part of the golf programme at the 1904 Summer Olympics. It was the second time the event was held at the Olympics, though it took a much different format than the 1900 golf tournament. 75 golfers from two nations competed. The competition was held approximately 5.75 km north of the Olympic Stadium at Glen Echo Country Club from September 19 to September 24, 1904. The event was won by George Lyon of Canada, one of three golfers not from the host United States. Lyon defeated American Chandler Egan in the final, giving Egan the silver medal. Americans Burt McKinnie and Francis Newton were the defeated semifinalists, each receiving bronze.\nBackground.\nThe first Olympic golf tournaments were held at the 1900 Games, with events for both men and women. One of the men's players was Albert Bond Lambert, who finished eighth in the (Olympic) men's tournament and first in the (non-Olympic) handicap tournament. Lambert and his father-in-law George McGrew, prominent businessmen in the St. Louis area, determined to bring golf to the 1904 Games that would be held in St. Louis. They founded the Glen Echo Country Club and pressed for the inclusion of golf on the programme with a tournament to be held at Glen Echo. The result was the second Olympic golf tournament, though the women's individual event was dropped, and a men's team event added.\nGolf was planned to be on the programme for the 1908 Games in London, but a dispute amongst representatives from England and Scotland over the format led to British golfers boycotting. This left only one foreign entrant, the Canadian defending champion Lyon, who refused to accept the gold medal by default, and the 1908 golf event was cancelled. Golf would not be held again at the Olympics until 2016.\nCanada made its debut in the event. The United States made its second appearance, the only nation to have golfers at both of the first two men's individual golf tournaments.\nCompetition format.\nThe format for the 1904 men's individual tournament was a grueling one.\nIn contrast to the 1900 Games, which used a 36-hole stroke play tournament for the competition, the 1904 tournament started with a 36-hole stroke play \"qualifying round\". This was followed by the top 32 qualifiers playing a match play knockout tournament, with each round consisting of 36 holes. \nEach round was played on consecutive days, meaning the two finalists played six straight days of 36 holes of golf. No bronze medal match was played, with both semifinal losers receiving bronze medals.\nResults.\nQualifying round.\nGolfers played two 18-hole rounds in qualifying play on September 19, with the top 32 golfers advancing to the match play knockout."

He was found dead in the street after falling from an upper story window. He apparently cut his throat before the fall. He was suffering from ill health prior to his suicide.

        "text": "Matt Ellis (born August 31, 1981) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger and assistant coach for the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League. Not selected in an NHL Entry Draft, Ellis has also played in the NHL for the Detroit Red Wings, Los Angeles Kings and the Sabres.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nEllis began his major junior hockey career in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) with the Toronto St. Michael's Majors in 1998. Each subsequent season with the Majors saw Ellis improve his point totals, from 18 the first year, onto 35, 45, and finishing with 38 goals and 51 assists for 89 total points in his final year with Toronto, helping them with the Central Division title.\nProfessional.\nAs a result of his OHL performances, the Detroit Red Wings signed the undrafted Ellis as a free agent on May 10, 2002. He was then sent to play on the Red Wings' ECHL affiliate, the Toledo Storm, where he posted 59 points in the regular season and tacked on eight points in the Storm's short playoff run.\nIn the following season, 2003–04, Ellis was called up to the American Hockey League (AHL) to join the Red Wings' top-level affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins; he recorded his first AHL point on October 24, 2003, with an assist on the game-winning goal against the Utah Grizzlies. Ellis again took time to adjust to the faster pace of the AHL, but soon found his place with the team. Each season saw his point totals increasing, and in 2005–06, he was named team captain, the youngest-ever in Griffins' history. On earning the captaincy and his confidence level, Ellis stated:\n \"It's definitely a big factor. You can totally tell the difference when there's a guy out there playing with confidence and when a guy's unsure of himself. Being a fourth-year pro, it makes a huge difference. Each year, you come in with a little more confidence, and I’ve been fortunate enough to be surrounded by some great players and coaches who were there to give me a pat on the back or help me out and keep me motivated.\" \nWhen asked about the chance to play for the Red Wings, Ellis then said:\n\"I’m hoping. Grand Rapids is a great place to learn and develop, but I’d like to get my feet wet in Detroit – for sure.\" \nEllis made his NHL debut for the Red Wings on December 18, 2006, in a 4–3 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets.\nNearly two years later, on February 21, 2008, Ellis was claimed off of waivers by the Los Angeles Kings. He scored his first goal with the Kings, an empty-netter, on March 13, against the Nashville Predators at Sommet Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\nShortly before the commencement of the 2008–09 season, on October 1, 2008, Ellis was claimed off of waivers from the Kings by the Buffalo Sabres. He played his first game with the latter on October 15 against the New York Rangers. On December 18, after injuries to several Buffalo forwards, Ellis was recalled from Buffalo's then-AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates, for the second time that season. In the subsequent off-season, on July 9, 2009, he resigned with the Sabres on a one-year contract.\nOn August 31, 2010, Ellis was re-signed to an additional one-year contract with Buffalo. To begin the following 2010–11 season, the Sabres placed Ellis on waivers, which he cleared on October 4, 2010. On July 19, 2011, in the off-season, Ellis signed a multi-year contract extension with the Sabres.\nDuring the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Ellis was again waived and was sent to the AHL's Rochester Americans after six games played with Buffalo. After 12 points in 35 games with the Americans, Ellis opted to remain with the Sabres organization, signing a two-year, two-way contract extension on July 3, 2013.\nIn the 2014–15 season, Ellis was recalled to the Sabres during the midpoint of the season, and on April 1, 2015, he scored his first goal of the campaign in a Buffalo victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.\nOn July 9, 2015, Ellis signed a one-year contract with the Rochester Americans. Ellis announced his retirement at the end of the season. He immediately joined The Academy of Hockey, which like the Sabres and Americans is owned by Terrence Pegula, as a coach."

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around was an artistic gymnastics event held as part of the gymnastics programme at the 1904 Summer Olympics. It was the second time an all-around event was held at the Olympics. The competition was held on Friday, July 1, 1904 and on Saturday, July 2, 1904. One hundred and nineteen gymnasts from three nations competed. The event was won by Julius Lenhart, an Austrian gymnast living in the United States and competing under the auspices of his Philadelphia-based club. Silver went to Wilhelm Weber of Germany, with bronze to Adolf Spinnler of Switzerland. They were the first medals in the event for each of those nations, as France had swept the medals in 1900.\nThe scores from this event, with some adjustments, were also used for the men's team event.\nBackground.\nThis was the second appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900. At the time, it was common to include athletics events along with gymnastics competitions in a combined event such as this.\nAnother combined event was held in 1904, during the later October gymnastics events.\nThe United States made its debut in the event. Germany and Switzerland each made their second appearance, the only two nations to have competed at both editions of the event to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe scores in the all-around were the sum of the results of the athletic triathlon and gymnastics triathlon events. They thus included competition in the 100 yard dash, long jump, shot put, horizontal bar, parallel bars, and horse (both vaulting horse and pommel horse).\nFor the gymnastics triathlon, each competitor performed a total of 9 routines—3 on each of the three apparatus. Each set of three routines included two compulsory exercises and one optional exercise. For the horse apparatus, there was one compulsory exercise in each of the vaulting horse and pommel horse, with the optional exercise being on the pommel horse. There was a maximum score of 5 points for each exercise, for a total of 15 points in each apparatus and 45 points for the triathlon.\nIn the athletics triathlon, the three events were the 100 yards, the long jump, and the shot put. There was no maximum score for each event, but rather a \"standard\" score of 10 and competitors would receive a score above or below 10 based on whether they performed better or worse than the \"standard\" result. In the 100 yards, the standard was 11.0 seconds, with a .1 point addition or subtraction for every .2 seconds faster or slower. In the long jump, the standard was 18 feet, with a .1 point addition or subtraction for each .1 feet longer or shorter. In the shot put, the standard was 30 feet, with a .1 point addition or subtraction for each .2 feet longer or shorter."

        "text": "Crystal Palace was a basketball team competing in the National Basketball League (NBL) and then the British Basketball League (BBL), until they merged with the London Towers in 1998. They played in the Crystal Palace Sports Centre and were the most successful team in Britain throughout the seventies and early eighties.\nHistory.\nIn 1966 the Old Suttonians basketball club was founded by several ex pupils of Sutton Grammar School including David Last and Terry Doherty who both performed the role of director of the club in future years. In 1972 the club entered the new National League as Sutton basketball club and finished third of six teams. the following season they relocated to Crystal Palace and became the Sutton &amp; Crystal Palace club. Success arrived quickly with a league and cup double the very next season.\nIn 1975 the club dropped the Sutton prefix and gained sponsorship from Cinzano which helped propel them into being the best club in Britain. The team would go on to complete three consecutive doubles of National League and National Cup. The team became regarded as the pioneers of UK basketball and their early players included Jim Guymon, Martin Hall, Barry Huxley, Mark Saiers, Alan Baillie, Pete Jeremich and Paul Philp. An incredible treble ensued in the 79–80 season and other players to represent the club included players such as Dan Lloyd, Bob Roma, Paul Stimpson, Mick Bett and Alton Byrd, the latter considered the man who revolutionised basketball in Britain.\nFurther success followed and it was not until the advent of Channel 4 TV coverage and big spending football club takeovers that Palace lost their mantle as top club. &lt;br&gt;In September 1986 Crystal Palace and Brunel Uxbridge &amp; Camden Ducks joined forces with fixtures being split between the Crystal Palace Sports Centre and Brunel University. Immediate glory returned to the club when after finishing fourth in the league they went on to win the 1987 play Off's but after just one season the club ran into financial difficulty and were forced to sell many players and change their name back to just Crystal Palace. &lt;br&gt;Players from the highly successful junior programme led by Roy Packham and Mark Dunning made up the team along with a number of talented juniors from Kevin Hibb's Kingston Junior programme. Graham Hill, Derek Johnson, Brian Moore, Roger Hosannah, Derek Lewis, Paul Smith, Michael Hosannah and Adrian Cummings were notable juniors that made the transition to the senior team which was led by Daryl Reshaw and Shaughan Ryan. \nFollowing the completion of the 1988 season the club dropped out of the Carlsberg League into the National League before failing to compete for the first time in the 1990/91 season. A return to action came the following season when Crystal Palace lined up in the third division of the revamped Carlsberg League finishing runners up to another former basketball giant the Solent Stars.&lt;br&gt;The returning Tim Lewis led the home grown talent along with Junior Peters Clinton ford, Brian Moore, Tunde Orelaja, Roger Lloyd and Adrian Jones. This team gain promotion two years running. \nThe 1993–1994 season saw Budweiser sponsor tier 1 of the league which as a consequence meant the National League was restructured moving Palace into division one where they finished Runner-up to Coventry Crusaders. The following season Alton Byrd returned to the club as player/general manager kick starting a successful season as they won Division One. The league win was repeated the following year because Palace had remained in the National League after their application to join the Budweiser League (tier 1) was rejected. &lt;br&gt; The team continued the development of British talent. Richard Scantlebury, Neill Rickets, Andy Powlesland, Graham Hill, Adrian Cummings, Ade Orelaja and Time Lewis all becoming permanent fixtures in the team.\nIn 1996 a return to the top tier in for the first time since 1988 ensued. Transition back to the BBL was difficult, other talented British players such as, Barry Gooch, Jason Crump, Clive Lindo, Jimmy Markham joined the club along with Junior Williams and Wayne Henry. A lack of sponsorship and the retirement of Alton Byrd had a major impact on the club. The Club tried to hang on to its ethos of growing local talent, Graham Hill a former junior and senior player was given the coaches job but after two mediocre seasons and despite the best efforts of club stalwarts Roy Packham and Terry Doherty the club merged with London Towers and the name Crystal Palace (the most successful UK basketball club in history at the time) ceased to exist."

        "text": "George Foster \"Sandy\" Sanford (June 4, 1870 – May 23, 1938) was an American college football player and coach. He served as the head coach at Cornell University (1896), Columbia University (1899–1901), the University of Virginia (1904), and Rutgers University (1913–1923), compiling a career coaching record of 89–49–7. Sanford was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1971.\nPlaying career.\nSanford started at center on the 1891 Yale Bulldogs football team and left guard on the 1892 team, but missed the final three games of the latter season due to a broken ankle. He graduated from Sheffield Scientific School in 1893, but was allowed to stay on the football team due to a rule change that allowed graduate students (Sanford was attending Yale Law School) to play college football. Sanford was also a member of the Yale track team and in 1894 competed in the Yale-Oxford games in England and the Amateur Athletic Union Outdoor Track and Field Championships at Travers Island, New York. He was declared ineligible for the 1895 football season finale against Princeton because he did not register as a student before that year's deadline. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1896, but passed on a legal career to go into coaching.\nCoaching.\nSanford began his coaching career at in 1896 at Cornell. He assisted Yale during the 1897 and 1888 seasons. In 1899, he became the first paid coach at Columbia University, receiving $5,000 a year. He was let go in 1902 in favor of Bill Morley. He spent that year out of football, instead working in the locomotive business in Chicago. He helped coach Yale during the final three weeks of the 1903 season. In 1904, he was the head coach at the University of Virginia. In 1905, 1910, 1911, and 1912, he assisted at Yale when it did not interfere with his business commitments. \nFrom 1913 to 1923, Sanford was the head coach at Rutgers University. His 1915 scored more points than any other eastern college football team. Sanford's players at Rutgers included Paul Robeson and Homer Hazel. After his retirement from coaching, Sanford remained involved with the football program as an advisor to his successor, John Wallace. Throughout his time at Rutgers, Sanford did not collect a salary and worked full time as an insurance broker in New York City.\nLater life.\nAfter retiring from coaching, Sanford was president of the insurance brokerage firm of Smyth, Sanford &amp; Gerard, Inc. in Manhattan, New York City. He died of a heart attack on May 23, 1938, at the age of 67 at Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was survived by his wife and two children. His son, Foster Sanford Jr., was a member of the University of Pennsylvania baseball, football, and track teams and was a member of the University's board of trustees from from 1958 to 1968."

        "text": "Thurmon Lavelle \"Bobby\" Collins Jr. (October 25, 1933 – November 15, 2021) was an American college football coach. He served as head coach at the University of Southern Mississippi and Southern Methodist University. While at SMU, Collins saw the school's football program brought down by severe NCAA sanctions that led to the \"death penalty\" being applied to the program, including the cancellation of the entire 1987 season and being limited to only seven road games in 1988. However, the school opted to sit out the 1988 season as well after virtually all of the team's experienced players went elsewhere.\nHe was born in Laurel, Mississippi. From 1975 to 1981, Collins coached at Southern Miss, and compiled a 48–30–2 record. In 1982, he was hired by SMU, signing a five-year deal with more than $100,000 annual salary. While at SMU, Collins compiled a 43–14–1 record. His only losing season as a coach came in 1976, when he went 3–8 at Southern Miss. From 1982 to 1984, he put together the best stretch in SMU's history, going 31–4–1.\nAfter the 1986 season, Collins, athletic director Bob Hitch and recruiting coordinator Henry Lee Parker were interviewed by WFAA-TV's Dale Hansen regarding allegations that players were being paid. Collins denied any knowledge of the affair. It later emerged that Collins knew that players were being paid, though he didn't know who they were. Collins resigned shortly after WFAA aired a special report breaking the scandal, and was later given $850,000 in severance pay in return for keeping quiet about the payments.\nCollins was not sanctioned by the NCAA for any role in the events leading up to the \"death penalty\", though the final report criticized him for not providing a convincing explanation for why players were still being paid after the school assured the NCAA that the payments had stopped. Nonetheless, his reputation was ruined. While he was a finalist for the open head coach's job at Mississippi State in 1990 (which eventually went to Jackie Sherrill), he never returned to the collegiate ranks in any capacity since leaving SMU. He spent his remaining years raising charity for Southern Miss. On November 15, 2021, Collins died at the age of 88."

        "title": "Queensland Cricket",
        "text": "Queensland Cricket, formerly known as the Queensland Cricket Association, is the governing body of Cricket in Queensland, Australia. Formed in 1876, it is directly responsible for the Queensland Bulls, Queensland Fire, Allan Border Field and Queensland Premier Cricket. Terry Svenson is the current CEO of the body, and Chris Simpson is Chairman of the Board of Directors.\nGrade Competitions.\nQueensland Premier Cricket was founded for the 1897/98 season as the premier competition for Brisbane cricket clubs but it has since expanded to represent wider South East Queensland with Ipswich, Gold Coast, and Sunshine Coast teams competing.\nOther grade competitions affiliated with Queensland Cricket include Townsville Cricket, and Cricket Far North.\nHistory.\nEarly Queensland cricket administration: 1863 - 1876.\nAn early effort to administ rate cricket in Queensland came in December 1863 when an Intercolonial Cricket Match between Queensland and New South Wales was proposed and a 'Central Intercolonial Cricket Match Committee' was formed in Queensland in order to make preliminary arrangements, which included making alterations to a cricket ground to accommodate the match. In May 1864 the Committee organized for a Brisbane side to play an Ipswich side in order to determine which players should represent Queensland against New South Wales. In July 1864 the Committee held a final meeting after the match had taken place to settle the accounts and consider preparations for future engagements. \nAs of February 1865 another Intercolonial match had been proposed and the Intercolonial Cricket Match Committee was reformed with responsibility for an Intercolonial Match Fund. The Committee was forced to change practice days for the Queensland side in March due to a scheduling clash with the Brisbane Cricket Club, and in May the Committee proposed that in order to improve the practice and proficiency of the Queensland side a Queensland Cricket Association should be formed composed of delegates from each club who would be under the direction of the Committee itself, and in June the body was formed and inaugurated, however by 1866 it had disbanded.\nIn January 1867 a media report observed that cricket was thriving in Queensland, with approximately six clubs in Brisbane and active clubs also existing in Ipswich and Toowoomba, and proposed that a Queensland Cricket Association be formed to settle disputes in the sport noting that other colonies already had such bodies. In March an Indigenous Cricket team visited Brisbane, and a committee formed to organize matches decided to save any surplus funds raised for the visit be held in trust for a Queensland Cricketing Association if it was formed, and in September a Queensland Cricket Association was established in Brisbane. The Association was still in existence as of 1874, however in May that year the Association observed that many clubs were not represented in the body and it was decided that it should print and distribute its rules and urge clubs to appoint delegates as soon as possible. In April 1875 the captain of the Gympie cricket team complained that the Queensland Cricket Association had refused to schedule a match between a Brisbane and Gympie side, and in November the body was harshly criticized as being a \"so-called \"Queensland Cricket Association\" which has never held a meeting or done an act within the memory of man.\"\nIn March 1876 a meeting was held at the Royal Hotel in Brisbane attended by approximately fifty at which it was proposed to form a new body in Brisbane to be called the Queensland Cricket Association (Q.C.A.) and the proposal was unanimously carried. The body was to have a committee consisting of a President, two vice-presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer, to be elected by delegates of member cricket clubs. It was decided that for a club to qualify for membership in the Association it must have twenty members and that clubs would have one delegate in the Association for every twenty members with a maximum of five delegates. An objection was raised at the meeting, suggesting that clubs with over one hundred members would be under-represented, but concerns were dismissed with the reasoning that it was better to encourage many small clubs rather than a small number of large clubs.\nClub cricket era: 1876 - 1897.\nThe first meeting of the delegates of the Q.C.A. was held on 5 April 1876, at the Australian Hotel in Brisbane, at which a subcommittee drafted Association rules which were decided on at a second meeting on 20 April. In late April 1876 the Q.C.A. received a letter regarding an English cricket team which was to tour Australia and had offered to visit Queensland if the Association could cover costs. The Association made an offer of 600 pounds in total for the English XI to visit the colony which was rejected. In September the Q.C.A. drew up rules for a \"Challenge Cup\" competition for clubs to compete in, and the inaugural 1876-77 season began in October marking the beginning of senior club cricket under the Q.C.A..\nQueensland Women's Cricket Association.\nThe Queensland Women’s Cricket Association was founded in the 1920s, but only began formally in 1929, with the Wynnum Women’s Cricket team. In this team Edna Newfong and Mabel Crouch were chosen as players, the first Aboriginal women to represent Australia in any sport. It was a major achievement in the 1930s as Aboriginal women had to face both racist and sexist disadvantages, all the while being under the control of the \"Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897\", which legally restricted civil rights to Aboriginal people."

        "title": "History of the National Rugby League",
        "text": "The history of the National Rugby League (NRL), the top league of professional rugby league football clubs in Australasia, goes back to December 1997, when it was formed in the aftermath of the Super League war of the mid-1990s. The NRL has, in its relatively brief history, enjoyed growth and record attendance figures.\nPrior Australian first grade competitions include New South Wales Rugby League premiership, Australian Rugby League and Super League (Australia).\nHistory and origin.\nThe New South Wales Rugby League ran the major rugby league competition of New South Wales from its inception in 1908 until 1994. Following the introduction of a new format for interstate rugby league, the State of Origin series in 1980, the decade of the 1980s brought about expansion of the NSWRL premiership, with the introduction of commercial sponsorship, the Winfield Cup, and the addition of non-Sydney-based teams, Canberra and Illawarra in 1982. Although this move brought more interest in the competition statewide in New South Wales, it would spell the beginning of the demise of some of the traditional Sydney-based clubs as well as having a negative effect on the Brisbane Rugby League premiership. Following the 1983 season, Sydney foundation club Newtown Jets were ultimately forced to withdraw from the competition because of financial difficulties.\nFurther expansion of the league followed in 1988, with another three teams based outside Sydney introduced to the competition; the Newcastle Knights and the first two Queensland teams, the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast-Tweed Giants. The Brisbane and Newcastle sides proved to be successful and popular and paved the way towards a push for a truly national competition. \nAlthough a top-flight league, legally parallel to the NSWRL Premiership until the beginning of the truly national ARL Premiership in 1995, the Brisbane Rugby League's history is not officially recorded by the NRL, and it is considered to have been an equal but unrelated first grade competition from 1922-1994.\nThis was attempted in 1995 with control of the premiership passing from the NSWRFL to the Australian Rugby League (ARL), who invited four more teams from outside NSW to participate in 1995. Ultimately this competition failed, but in its demise the National Rugby League was born, incorporating the traditional Sydney clubs, successfully coercing the Sydney market to follow the newly created national competition.\nThe prospect of a truly national rugby league competition in addition to the introduction of pay television in Australia attracted the attention of global media organisation, News Corporation, and it followed that professional rugby league was shaken to its very foundations in the mid-1990s with the advent of the Super League war. Initially a conflict over broadcasting rights, it became a dispute as to who controlled the sport and which traditional clubs would survive into the new national era, as News Limited formed their own Super League and admitted some former ARL clubs, poaching players from the original ARL league with high salaries. With twenty-two teams of highly varying quality playing in two competitions that year, crowd attendances and corporate sponsorships were spread very thinly, and many teams found themselves in financial difficulty. The ARL undertook moves to invite the traditional clubs that had moved to the Super League competition back into a re-unified competition. Following a period of negotiation with News Corporation, on 23 September 1997 the ARL announced that it was forming a new company to conduct the competition in 1998. On 7 October News' Manaaki Ranginui announced that he was confident that there would be a single competition in 1998. On 19 December, representatives of clubs affiliated with the Australian Rugby League gathered at the Sydney Football Stadium to decide whether to accept News Limited's offer of a settlement – eventually voting in favour by 36 votes to 4. As a result, in the following months the National Rugby League, jointly owned by the ARL and News Limited, was formed.\nIt was announced that the inaugural National Rugby League (NRL) season of 1998 would have 20 teams competing, 19 remaining Super League and ARL teams plus the Melbourne Storm, who were created by Super League for their 1998 season. Clubs on both sides of the war were shut down. Super League decided to close the Hunter Mariners and the financially ruined Perth Reds, who were $10 million in debt at the end of 1997, while the ARL decided to close down the South Queensland Crushers, who were also in severe financial trouble. Additionally, at the end of 1998 the NRL decided to close down former Super League club, the Adelaide Rams and former ARL club, the Gold Coast Chargers, despite the Gold Coast franchise being one of the few clubs to make a profit during the Super League war.\nStructure of the NRL between 1998–2012.\nA Partnership Executive Committee administered the agreement between the Australian Rugby League and News Limited as well as making major financial decisions. Three representatives from each party made up this committee. A National Rugby League Board, which was commissioned by the Partnership Committee and is composed of six delegates – three from each party – was responsible for administering the competition. Both bodies nominated a Chairman to lead each board for a term of 12 months on an alternating basis.\nThe National Rugby League markets the premiership on behalf of the clubs as well as organising the draw and finals matches. When the draw is finalised, teams are responsible for controlling and organising their assigned home games. Clubs each have their own organisational structure but are also bound to the National Rugby League by a common set of rules in club agreements.\nIn late November/early December each year the NRL holds a conference for CEOs, coaches and players to discuss issues facing the League.\n1998: The beginning of the National Rugby League.\nWith twenty-two teams playing in two competitions in 1997 crowd attendances and corporate sponsorships were spread very thinly, and many teams found themselves in financial difficulty. On 23 September 1997 the ARL announced that it was forming a new company to control the competition in 1998 and invited Super League clubs to participate. On 7 October Rupert Murdoch announced that he was confident that there would be a single competition in 1998 and on 19 December representatives of clubs affiliated with the Australian Rugby League gathered at the Sydney Football Stadium to decide whether to accept News Limited's offer of a settlement – eventually voting in favour by 36 votes to 4. As a result, in the following months the National Rugby League, jointly owned by the ARL and News Limited, was formed.\nIt was announced that the 1998 Season would have 20 teams competing, 19 Super League/ARL teams and the Melbourne Storm, who were owned by News Limited. Clubs on both sides of the war were shut down. News decided to close the Hunter Mariners and the financially ruined Western Reds, who were $10million in debt at the end of 1997, while the ARL decided to close down the South Queensland Crushers, who were also in severe financial trouble.\nNeil Whittaker was the new League's first CEO. At the end of 1998 News Limited decided to close down the Adelaide Rams and the ARL closed down the Gold Coast Chargers, even though they were one of the few clubs to make a profit during the Super League war.\n1999–2002: Rationalisation.\nOne condition of the peace agreement between the ARL and News Limited was that there would be a 14 team competition in 2000. The 20 clubs that played in 1998 would be assessed on various items such as sponsorship, crowds, on-field success and the like. It was also announced that clubs that merged would receive a large sum of money, as well as a guaranteed position in the 2000 NRL Competition. The St. George Dragons and the Illawarra Steelers were the first clubs to take up the offer, forming the joint-venture St. George Illawarra Dragons at the end of the 1998 season.\nThe Bulldogs continued in their present form without merging in 1999, however dropped the \"Canterbury\" from their club name to simply become known as the Bulldogs.\nIn August 1999 the NRL's CEO Neil Whittaker announced that he would resign at the end of the season.\nThe 1999 NRL Grand Final brought about a new official world record attendance for a game of rugby league. 107,999 spectators saw the Melbourne Storm play the newly merged St. George Illawarra Dragons in the decider at Stadium Australia.\nBalmain and Western Suburbs formed the joint venture club, the Wests Tigers at the end of 1999, while North Sydney and Manly-Warringah merged to form the ill-fated Northern Eagles.\nThe 2000 National Rugby League season started with a new CEO in rugby union's David Moffett who replaced Neil Whittaker in late 1999.\nAs part of another image makeover, a number of teams also released new club logos. The most notable of these was the Sydney Roosters, dropping the \"City\" section of their name for the 2000 season and beyond. Souths were controversially axed from the competition at the end of 1999 for failing to meet the criteria.\nThis move was highly controversial and on 11 November 2001 80,000 marched in protest at their continued exclusion. South Sydney challenged the decision in the Federal Court claiming that the NRL agreement was exclusionary, intended to unfairly exclude South Sydney, and breached the Trade Practices Act. Justice Paul Finn ruled that the agreement did not specifically exclude any club and dismissed the Rabbitohs claims for re-instatement into the national competition. Souths appealed this decision and were re-admitted into the competition in 2002.\nThe Auckland Warriors experienced much financial hardship in the early part of the decade, ultimately collapsing before being resurrected as the New Zealand Warriors for the 2001 season. They made the Grand Final the following year.\nIn 2001, Australia's largest telecommunications provider Telstra became naming rights sponsor of the NRL, with the competition's name becoming the NRL Telstra Premiership, while in 2002 David Gallop took over the CEO role from David Moffett, and the competition has become more and more popular each season.\nSince 2001, the NRL Grand Final has been played on Sunday nights, a shift from the traditional Sunday afternoon slot used for over a decade prior.\n2003–2005: Record popularity.\nThe 2003 season was widely regarded as the most successful since the beginning of the National Rugby League in 1998. The Penrith Panthers rose from the bottom of the table to win the Premiership, while the Broncos returned to Lang Park mid-year. Season 2004 proved even more successful than 2003, with the North Queensland Cowboys going from 11th position in 2003 to 3rd in 2004, narrowly missing out on a maiden Grand Final berth. It also saw the return of the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles after the breakdown of the Northern Eagles merger.\nCrowd average records were broken in 2003, 2004 and 2005. In 2005, the NRL reached record levels of popularity for its competition. Total crowds for the competition season almost reached the figures for the last year of the competition conducted by the ARL competition of 1995, prior to the Super League war. From 2004 to 2005 there was a 39% increase in sponsorship, a 41% increase in merchandise royalties and a 12% increase in playing participation. In 2005 Business Review Weekly ranked the NRL 497 in revenue of Australian private companies, with revenue of A$66.1m (+7%) with 35 employees. In 2005, a record national audience of 4.1 million tuned into watch the grand final between the Wests Tigers and the North Queensland Cowboys.\nAt the beginning of 2005 the NRL became the first mainstream professional sport in Australia to appoint a female director to a governing body, with Katie Page, the managing director of retail giant Harvey Norman, accepting an invitation to join the NRL executive board. She replaced Sydney orthopedic surgeon Dr Merv Cross, who retired. Former Broncos and Australian captain Gorden Tallis also joined the board, replacing John Brass.\nBefore the 2005 season the NRL introduced a pension incentive scheme to try to retain top players in the competition.\nIn the middle of 2005 the NRL reached a broadcasting rights agreement with Foxsports and Channel 9 worth $500 million over six years, representing a 65% increase in direct television income.\n2005: Legal action.\nOn 13 September 2005, the Seven Network began proceedings in the Federal Court in Sydney naming 22 parties (including the NRL) in a conspiracy to shut down the C7 pay television station. C7 had unsuccessfully bid $72,000,000 per annum for the right to broadcast the NRL competition on pay television. After News Limited re-signed these rights, C7 was left without a major sport to broadcast and subsequently ceased operation in March 2002. It is alleged that News Limited used its position as half-owner of the NRL to secure the rights. Jonathan Sumption, QC representing the Seven Network, has said\nThe case is being heard by Justice Ron Sackville. The Seven Network is seeking up to $1.1 billion in damages. Sumption also stated that:\n2006: A unique year.\nThe 2006 National Rugby League season kicked off on Friday, 10 March, between defending premiers Wests Tigers and early favourites St George Illawarra Dragons at Telstra Stadium.\nMelbourne, after leading the competition for most of the season, comfortably claimed the minor premiership, with the Bulldogs, Brisbane, and Newcastle making up the top four. Manly, St George Illawarra, Canberra and Parramatta took places five to eight.\nThe 2006 NRL Grand Final won by the Brisbane Broncos over the Melbourne Storm, 15–8. The matchup was a significant milestone in the history of the NRL, as two interstate teams (teams not from New South Wales, the perceived \"heartland\" of the NRL) contested the grand final for the first time ever.\n2007: Expansion once more.\nThe 2007 NRL Season kicked off on Friday 16 March 2007 with eight games each round. Monday night football returned during the 2007 season, the first match saw the Sydney Roosters go down to the South Sydney Rabbitohs 18–6 on 19 March 2007. The opening round also saw two matches at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium, the first featuring reigning champions Brisbane against fellow Queensland side the Cowboys, while the second match featured the new club, the Gold Coast Titans. The finals series was contested over a period of four weeks, culminating with the NRL Grand Final held on Sunday 30 September 2007 where Melbourne beat Manly 34–8.\nAnother change from the previous season included a reduction in the number of byes per team in the season. With an odd number of teams contesting between 2002 and 2006, the draw meant that at least one team would have to have a bye each weekend. With the inclusion of the 16th team for the 2007 season, the National Rugby League had the option of reverting to back to the system used between 2000 and 2001 where every team played each round. This system was not used however, but rather teams were given just a single bye during the year, grouped in periods that assisted clubs around the representative fixtures.\nFollowing the 2011 season, the newly formed independent Australian Rugby League Commission took over control of the NRL.\nA 2013 report conducted by Brand Finance valued the Penrith Panthers club at $46.2m, the highest of any Australian sporting brand, while the Brisbane Broncos had the highest brand equity.\nNational Rugby League premiers.\nNote – Melbourne Storm were stripped of their 2007, 2009 premiership titles and their 2006, 2007, 2008 minor premiership titles due to their 2010 salary cap breaches. Although they have been stripped, the NRL declined to make the second placed team the premiers/minor premiers."

        "text": "The men's vault was a gymnastics event contested as part of the Gymnastics at the 1964 Summer Olympics programme at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium. The event was held on 18, 20, and 23 October. There were 130 competitors from 30 nations, with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 3 gymnasts. For the first time in three Games, there was a clear winner with no tie. Haruhiro Yamashita took the gold medal, the second consecutive gold for Japan. Victor Lisitsky finished second, taking silver but breaking the Soviet Union's three-Games gold medal streak. Hannu Rantakari's bronze was Finland's first medal in the event since 1948.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Seven of the top 11 (including three-way tie for 9th) gymnasts from 1960 returned: joint gold medalists Takashi Ono of Japan and Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union, fourth-place finisher Yury Titov of the Soviet Union, fifth-place finisher Yukio Endo, sixth-place finisher Shuji Tsurumi, and eighth-place finisher Takashi Mitsukuri of Japan, and ninth-place finishers Franco Menichelli and Giovanni Carminucci of Italy. Ono had also taken bronze in 1952, Titov had taken bronze in 1956, and Shakhlin had finished fourth in 1956. The reigning (1962) world champion was Přemysl Krbec of Czechoslovakia, with Haruhiro Yamashita of Japan second and Endo and Shakhlin tied for third.\nAlgeria, the Republic of China, Iran, Mongolia, and the Philippines each made their debut in the men's vault. The United States made its 10th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics all-around events continued to use the aggregation format. Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to two individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. The event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004).\nThese exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 130th. For the apparatus finals, the all-around score for that apparatus was multiplied by one-half then added to the final round exercise score to give a final total.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, with the final total apparatus score from 0 to 20.\nResults.\nEach gymnast competed in both compulsory and optional exercises, with the median scores from the four judges for the two sets of exercises were summed. This score was also used in calculating both individual all-around and team scores.\nThe top 6 advanced to the final for the apparatus, keeping half of their preliminary score to be added to their final score."

The current president is Terrence Khoo, who played for the national team from 1984 to 2000 and is a former national captain.\nThe Singapore Rugby Union is currently located at 900 Tiong Bahru Road, Delta Swimming Complex, Singapore 158790. This office houses all the administrative staff of the union.\nCoaches.\nIn 2019, Simon Mannix took over as national head coach from Mark Lee on a three year contract. In 2021, Mannix left the position to return to France.\nStadium.\nThe Queenstown Stadium is the on field home of Singapore Rugby and is where all major games are being played.\nIncidents.\nIn October 2005, it was reported that Sean Lee, a former financial executive of the Singapore Rugby Union, absconded with SGD$300,000. On the last day of his work when he resigned, the money was found missing from the Union's accounts. In April 2007, the absconded amount was revealed to be three times more than what was originally reported in November 2005. A total of SGD$1.215 million was misappropriated over an 18-month period by writing Union checks with forged signatures to companies registered under his name.\nIn March 2009, nearly half of the national team went on strike citing nationality bias by the management, as well as not addressing some issues and concerns with training. Ex-captain and incumbent backrower Rong Jing Xiang was also part of the players who went on strike. After the Rugby Union met with the players to resolve the issue, the Singapore Rugby Union agreed to address some their concerns and also to implement a \"balance\" in the ratio of local to expatriate players in the team. In final team selections, Rong was subsequently dropped from the team.\nThe national team is made up largely of expatriate players. The 2009 training squad consisted of 17 expatriate players, and 13 local players. The captain, Ben Wheeler, who took over captaincy from Rong Jing Xiang (Singapore's most capped player with 45 appearances), had only 2 caps prior to the Asian 5 Nations tournament. Critics are beginning to wonder if this move by CEO Ian Bremner is a right move for the development of rugby amongst the locals in Singapore, and if the Singapore National Rugby team is headed into the same direction as Hong Kong's National Rugby team, which is dominated by expatriate players."

        "text": "The 1972 Giro d'Italia was the 55th running of the Giro, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It started in Venice on 21 May, with a prologue and concluded with a mass-start stage, on 11 June. A total of 100 riders from ten teams entered the 20-stage race, that was won by Belgian Eddy Merckx of the Molteni team. The second and third places were taken by Spaniards José Manuel Fuente and Francisco Galdós, respectively.\nTeams.\nA total of ten teams were invited to participate in the 1972 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 100 cyclists. In total, 63 riders were from Italy, while the remaining 37 riders came from: Belgium (18), Spain (10), Switzerland (6), Sweden (2), and Denmark (1). Of those starting, 21 were riding the Giro d'Italia for the first time. The average age of riders was 27.34 years, ranging from 22–year–old Jürg Schneider from GBC to 38–year–old Aldo Moser of GBC. The team with the youngest average rider age was Magniflex (25), while the oldest was (29). From the riders that began this edition, 69 made it to the finish on the Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nEddy Merckx () entered as the unanimous favorite to win the event. He had previously won the race in 1968 and 1970, but did not ride in 1971 in order to race the Tour de France, which he won. Early in the season, he broke a vertebra in a fall during the Paris–Nice. Merckx entered the race as the reigning world champion, with victories at Milan–San Remo and Liège–Bastogne–Liège in the season so far. He was viewed to be in great physical shape coming into the race. Despite his success, there were concerns that Merckx's constant racing during the 1969 and 1970 seasons might have diminished his capabilities. The Molteni team was viewed to have strong supports for Merckx with Roger Swerts, Martin Van Den Bossche, and Jozef Spruyt. It was known that Merckx wished to target the upcoming Tour de France and it was thought that he and his team would try to be conservative with their efforts at the Giro. A third victory would tie Merckx with the likes of Giovanni Brunero, Gino Bartali, and Fiorenzo Magni, whom each had won the race three times. Five-time champion Alfredo Binda commented that Merckx's participation \"promises episodes of high competitive value, even if the Belgian is no longer the powerful athlete, almost irresistible from two years ago.\" Binda commented that Merckx is vulnerable when considering his results from the previous season to the current one.\nReigning champion Gösta Pettersson () was found to be a dangerous opponent. Pettersson's teammate Gianni Motta was also viewed as a general classification threat, which was thought to hinder their chances as Merckx was the sole leader of his Molteni team. The same was thought for the team which featured two-time winner Felice Gimondi (1967 and 1969) and Italo Zilioli. Gimondi stated before the race that on the fourth stage where the Blockhaus is climbed, \"you will know what I am worth.\" Binda felt Gimondi had the best chance of all the Italian competitors to win the general classification. Spanish climbers José Manuel Fuente and Miguel María Lasa, both from the KAS team, were expected to disrupt Merckx in the mountains and could challenge for a high general classification ranking. The KAS team was viewed as a strong squad after their stranglehold over the recent Vuelta a España where Fuente was victorious, but it was noted that featured minimal competition for the squad.\nOutside contenders for the race were Roger De Vlaeminck (Dreher), Ole Ritter (Dreher), Pierfranco Vianelli (Dreher), and Franco Bitossi (Filotex). De Vlaeminck was viewed as a threat due to his victory at Paris–Roubaix and stage-race Tirreno–Adriatico. He suffered scaphoid fracture before the race and got the cast removed before the race began and started the event with a bandage on his left wrist. He stated he hoped his condition would improve before the race reached the Blockhaus. In addition, one of de Vlaeminck's knees would be operated on in the fall.\nSprinters Marino Basso (Salvarani) and Patrick Sercu (Dreher) were thought to be the favorites to win the opening flat stages. Notable absences from the race included Rik Van Linden (Magniflex) who had injured his foot in the Vuelta.\nRoute and stages.\nRace director Vincenzo Torriani revealed the race route on 28 March 1972 in front of several journalists. Torriani reported that Belgium had expressed interest in hosting the start of the race with a cash incentive, but arrived late in the process and would be considered for the 1973 edition. After the routes announcement in March, it was modified and contained twenty days of racing, with three split stages, which covered a grand total of , which was reduced from the initially. The race featured two rest days, the first of which was used to transfer from Messina to Rome on 30 May. There were eleven stages containing seventeen categorized climbs that awarded points for the mountains classification across eleven stages. In total, the race climbed , less than the previous year. The average length of each stage was . The route contained three time trial stages for a total of . One of the days featured two time trials each in Forte dei Marmi, where Torriani pitched the idea that there could be three winners on the stage, one for each winner of the split time trial stage and one winner for the best combined time from both performances. At the initial route announcement there was speculation that a prologue would take place on 20 May in Venice, but it was later reported to have failed because Torriani did not get approval from the Venetian government.\nThe route began in Venice for the first time in race history and traveled south and crossed the Apennines until reaching the edge of the continental section of Italy. The race transferred to Sicily for a stage. Following the conclusion of Messina stage, the race had a rest day that was used to transfer for Rome. The event continued north and reached the Alps before reaching the Alps and making a turn south and west to travel towards Milan for the finish. The entire route crossed through the majority of Italian regions.\nIt was believed Torriani made the race very mountainous in order to keep Merckx from overly dominating the race. Author William Fotheringham shared that sentiment, specifically stating that Torriani designed the route in order to give José Manuel Fuente several opportunities to attack Eddy Merckx. The race was predicted to be under poor weather for the majority of its duration.\nRace overview.\nDuring the fourteenth stage, the race jury disqualified Zilioli, Motta and Bitossi, among others.\nEddy Merckx lost the sprint finish to defending champion Gösta Pettersson on stage 7 but took the lead of the race and never looked back en route to the 3rd of his five Giro victories. Roger De Vlaeminck won the points classification as well as four of his career 22 Giro stage victories. José Manuel Fuente won the 2nd of his four Giro King of the Mountains titles.\nClassification leadership.\nThere were three main individual classifications contested in the 1972 Giro d'Italia, as well as a team competition. Two of them awarded jerseys to their leaders. The general classification was the most important and was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Giro. The rider leading the classification wore a pink jersey to signify the classification's leadership.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the top positions in a stage finish, with first place getting the most points, and lower placings getting successively fewer points down to fifteenth place. The rider leading this classification wore a purple (or cyclamen) jersey. The mountains classification was the third classification. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Climbs were ranked in first and second categories, the former awarded 50, 30, and 20 points while the latter awarded 30, 20, and 10 points. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Most stages of the race included one or more categorized climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. In addition there was the \"Cima Coppi\", the Stelvio Pass, which was the highest mountain crossed in this edition of the race. For this designation it gave 200, 100, 80, 70, and 50 points to the first five riders summit the climb. The first rider over the Stelvio was José Manuel Fuente.\nThe final classification, the team classification, awarded no jersey to its leaders. This was calculated by adding together points earned by each rider on the team during each stage through the intermediate sprints, the categorized climbs, stage finishes, etc. The team with the most points led the classification.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nMerckx also won the combination classification which was calculated by totaling each rider's placement in the general, points, and mountains classifications."

        "text": "The 1969 Giro d'Italia was the 52nd edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The race consisted of 23 stages, one of which was a split stage, starting in Garda on 16 May and finishing Milan on 8 June. There were two time trial stages and a single rest day. Felice Gimondi of the Salvarani team won the overall general classification, his second victory. Italians Claudio Michelotto (Max Meyer) placed second, 3 min and 35 s slower than Gimondi, and Italo Zilioli (Filotex) was third, over four minutes behind Gimondi.\nEddy Merckx, who was leading the general classification, was excluded from the race after an extremely controversial anti-doping control in Savona.\nTeams.\nA total of 13 teams were invited to participate in the 1969 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 130 cyclists. Riders of Italian nationality numbered the most with 113, while Belgium had the second most with eight. Out of the 130 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 81 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams that took part in the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nEddy Merckx (Faema), the previous year's winner returned to defend his crown. He arrived in Italy amid a great season already with victories in the three Monuments Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, and Liège–Bastogne–Liège. Merckx named Felice Gimondi () his top rival for the upcoming race. Both Merckx and 1967 champion Gimondi were viewed as the principal favorites to win the race. Gimondi had won the Tour de Romandie and placed second in the Tour of Flanders. Both riders hoped to achieve the Giro–Tour double, for the first time since Jacques Anquetil achieved it in 1964. Gimondi had previously attempted the feat in 1965 and 1967. Merckx had specifically hoped to ride a conservative race in order to help his chances to complete the double.\nReigning world champion Vittorio Adorni () who placed second the year before was viewed as a rider who could challenge the Gimondi–Merckx duel, despite being winless that season so far. Filotex's Italo Zilioli and Franco Bitossi were other riders who were speculated to challenge for high general classification positions. Top sprinters entering the race were Molteni's Michele Dancelli and Marino Basso.\nSpanish and French rider participation was lacking, as the former had only a single team entered and there were zero French riders competing. Notable absences included Gianni Motta and Franco Balmamion.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route was revealed on 27 March 1969 by race director Vincenzo Torriani. The announced route covered , across twenty-four stages of racing. The average stage length for this edition was . In total the route traversed 600 municipalities over 44 provinces. The route featured 26 categorized climbs that awarded points for the mountains classification, including eight of which were being scaled for the first time in race history. Five of those climbs would be stage finishes for the race. Four climbs were over , while the whole race climbed a total of . The route started flat before the first important stages pertaining to the general classification would be in the ninth and tenth stages. The rest day took place in San Marino on 31 May.\nThe race started in Garda and made its way south and west across the Apennines. Then the race headed south until Potenza before turning north until reaching San Marino for two stages. The race transferred to Parma and headed east again and entered the Dolomites. Traversing the Dolomites, the race headed west until its finish in Milan.\nRace overview.\nThe twentieth stage of the race from Trento to Marmolada started at 8:30 AM local time and by around 1 PM the weather was worsening and this lead race organizers to change the route in order to go through Fiera di Primiero. However, the weather there was even worse and the Torriani elected to neutralize the stage after of racing.\nFollowing Merckx's disqualification from the race, there were rumors of riders protests. The race started an hour later than intended and the race stopped briefly in front of Merckx's hotel in an act of solidarity. Gimondi, who was promoted to first place, refused to wear the pink jersey during the seventeenth stage. However, the stage went on and the winning breakaway started roughly 30 kilometers from the race finish, with Ole Ritter attacking to win ahead of the fifteen other riders in the move. The mood of the peloton and the race's caravan was described as dismayed.\nDoping.\nThe race had doping controls and the top two riders in the general classification were drug tested after each stage, along with two other cyclists chosen at random. A mobile lab that traveled with the race and conducted the drug tests. \nOn 2 June, it was announced that the race leader Merckx had tested positive. Merckx's first test came up positive for fencamfamine, an amphetamine and a second test confirmed the positive. The word spread about Merckx's positive test while Merckx himself was still asleep. The media was able to enter Merckx's room at the Albissola Superiore as the news broke to him, where he stated \"I'm sure I didn't take any doping product,\" as he cried on his hotel bed. Fellow riders, including Gimondi, and team directors stopped by to express their solidarity with Merckx as he faced the news.\nThe positive test meant Merckx was to be suspended for a month. Race director Vincenzo Torriani delayed the start of the seventeenth stage in an attempt to persuade the president of the Italian Cycling Federation to allow Merckx to begin the stage. However, the president was not in his office and Torriani was forced to start the stage, disqualifying Merckx in the process. Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) president Adriano Rodoni announced an investigation into the situation, which, in the succeeding days, resulted in the removal of the suspension.\nThe reaction to Merckx's expulsion was wide. Many writers sided with Merckx stating how he tested negative every other time in the race to that point before the positive on his final test. Several pointed to his clean track record and willingness to take doping controls whenever approached. A writer made note that it was widely known that riders took stimulants at the time, otherwise the pace of racing could not be kept at what it was at the time. At the time the list of banned substances varied from country to country. There were some riders that threatened to strike at the start of the seventeenth stage. Some writers stated that the Giro was over at that point, and one went as far as to say that this might be the death of the Giro. There were hypotheses that he had consumed tainted food. Fellow cyclists also sided with Merckx, Taccone stated \"It was sabotage, while Gimondi commented that if he were to win the race overall, it would have no meaning since he could not best Merckx. On the other hand, Rudi Altig told the media: \"The law must be respected. If it had been a runner in the background, there would be no scandal. He would have been disqualified without any other form of trial. Merckx, on the other hand, is the victim, and that is why the case is experiencing such a twist.\" Former cyclist Marino Vigna and Faema co–director mentioned that Merckx could not have taken a tampered bottle from the ‘’tifosi’’ as he warned Merckx “from the start of the Giro against the danger of refueling during the stage by the public,” further saying that Merckx never accepted bottles from fans. However, he did say that Merckx could have gotten a bottle from a teammate that got one from a spectator.\nClassification leadership.\nTwo different jerseys were worn during the 1969 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a red jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15. The mountains classification leader. The climbs were ranked in first and second categories. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time."

The artistic gymnastics events were held at the Beijing National Indoor Stadium on August 9–19. The rhythmic gymnastics events were held at the Beijing University of Technology Gymnasium on August 21–24. The trampoline events were also held at the Beijing National Indoor Stadium on August 16–19.\nChampions Gala.\nThe traditional Gymnastics Champions Gala took place on August 20 at the National Indoor Stadium. Participants are mainly selected from the 2008 Olympic trampoline and artistic gymnastics, as well as medalists from world championships. In addition, some Chinese pop stars appeared in the Gala.\nThe performances included Olympic disciplines such as floor exercise, pommel horse, rings, parallel bars, horizontal bar, uneven bars, balance beam, rhythmic gymnastics and trampoline gymnastics; non-Olympic discipline such as tumbling and acrobatic; and art performances such as dancing, martial art, instrument performance and chorus.\nAge controversies.\nChina.\nOn August 21, 2008 the IOC instructed the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) to investigate allegations that Chinese gymnast He Kexin was underaged and therefore ineligible to compete during the Olympic gymnastics competition. The FIG requires that all gymnasts be at least 16 years of age in the Olympic calendar year. The IOC had initially accepted the ages of all the Chinese participants, but newly uncovered documents suggested He was 14 years old, and thus ineligible to compete.\nThe investigation was initiated after an American blogger reported on a cached official Excel spreadsheet showing He's birthday as January 1, 1994. His discoveries support earlier reports from The New York Times and other bloggers regarding He's age discrepancy. Earlier, several bloggers found links to news stories and photo captions from 2007 and early 2008, including stories in the state-run Xinhua news service, that cited He's age as 13.\nOn October 1, 2008, the FIG ended their investigation and concluded that He and her teammates from the 2008 Olympic games were old enough to compete. This ruling confirmed the FIG's initial conclusions. Though some media outlets have voiced doubts about the decision, the gymnasts have been cleared by the FIG of any wrongdoing.\nNorth Korea.\nIn 2014, North Korean female gymnast Cha Yong-hwa was a subject of disciplinary hearing because of false passport used to falsify her age. The FIG decided to withdraw her license and nullify all her results, including the results from 2008 Olympics."

        "text": "The English women's cricket team toured Australia and New Zealand in 1934 and 1935. It was on this tour that the first women's Test matches were played: three against Australia, followed by one against New Zealand. England won the first two Tests against the Australians convincingly, and had the better of a drawn third Test, to clinch the Ashes. The game against New Zealand was even more one-sided in England's favour.\nThe tour itself was recorded for posterity in a series of photographs that are now in the National Library of Australia. These photographs show the cricketers playing the game on a long tour, which took in many matches apart from the international series. However, there are others showing the players relaxing on their vessel, the SS Rotorua, and on trips, such as to Melbourne Zoo or up New Zealand glaciers.\nThe Test matches were dominated by Myrtle Maclagan, who made 279 runs and took 26 wickets. So dominant was her performance that just after the men's team had lost the men's version of the Ashes, the \"Morning Post\" praised Maclagan's batting prowess with the quatrain:\nHowever, she was outscored by Betty Snowball, who made 381 runs, including a mammoth 189 against the Kiwis.\nTest match details.\nFirst Test: England v Australia (28–31 December).\nAustralian captain, Margaret Peden, won the toss and chose to bat. Australia, however, soon came up against England allrounder, Myrtle Maclagan, whose 7 wickets for the cost of only 10 runs saw Australia collapse to 47 all out. During that first innings, Australian wicket-keeper, Hilda Hills retired hurt on 2, with a broken nose. Hills then played no further part in the match, with Hazel Pritchard going behind the stumps in her place.\nMaclagan opened the batting for England, and made 72 before she was the fifth woman out with England on 116, just before close on the first day. On day two, England moved on to 154, with Betty Archdale making 32 not out. In their second innings, Australia fared better, and were 99 for 5 at close on the second day. Maclagan failed to take a wicket in her 28 overs, but it was Mary Spear's five wickets that did the damage, as the home team were all of for 138, a total which included 63 runs scored over more than four hours from Essie Shevill. England were thus set just 32 for the win, which they secured with the loss of just one wicket.\nIn the match, Australia fielded sisters, Essie Shevill and Fernie Blade, Fernie was dropped after one test, her twin sister Rene Shevill played in the 2nd and 3rd tests.\nSecond Test: England v Australia (4–8 January).\nPeden won the toss for the second time, and chose to bat. Australia soon stumbled to 22 for 3, before recovering to 147 for 9 at close on the first day. There was no play on the second day, and on the third Australia put on 15 more runs before being dismissed. Maclagan had taken four wickets in Australia's innings, and she now proceeded to make the first century in Women's Test history, putting on 119 before being third out for 230. By the close of the third day, England had put on 301 for 5.\nEngland captain, Betty Archdale, declared on the overnight score. On the fourth day, Joy Partridge took 6 for 96 as the Aussies stumbled to 148 all out. England easily made the 10 required for victory, though not before two wickets had been lost. As Rene Shevill took over as the Australian wicket-keeper from the injured Hill, Essie Shevill yet again played with one of her sisters. However, Rene's twin, Fernie Blade, did not play.\nThird Test: England v Australia (18–20 January).\nArchdale won the toss and chose to bat. England did not fare as well as in the earlier matches, though, and were only able to make 162, with Maclagan top-scoring on 50. Peggy Antonio took 6 for 49. Australia then made 31 for the loss of 1 wicket before stumps on the first day. The second day saw them to 150, just 12 behind England. 59 of these runs, however, were made for the ninth and tenth wicket. Without these, Australia probably would have slumped to a third consecutive defeat. As it was, however, England were tight for time, declaring on 153 for 7. Australia were made to face 57 overs, but were able to hang on, being eight down when the match ended. England therefore won the series two-nil.\nTest Match: England v New Zealand (16–18 February).\nAlthough scheduled as a three-day match, it was soon clear that it would not last the course. New Zealand won the toss and chose to bat, but were dismissed within 30 overs for a dire 44. Maclagan had taken 5 wickets, and Peta Taylor 3 to complete the rout. Maclagan, however, was first out at 55 for 1 in England's reply. Honours instead went to Betty Snowball, who set a new Test match record score of 189. Molly Hide also made a century as New Zealand's attack lacked any penetration. England batted on past their first day score of 431 for 4, finally declaring on 503 for 5.\nNew Zealand batted better in their second innings, but an England victory was never in doubt as Joy Partridge took 4 wickets to end England's Test match tour on a comprehensive high."

        "text": "The Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team represents Duke University in NCAA Division I college basketball and competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The team is fifth all-time in wins of any NCAA men's basketball program, and is currently coached by Jon Scheyer. \nDuke has won 5 National Championships (tied with Indiana for fourth all-time behind UCLA, Kentucky, North Carolina, UConn, and appeared in 11 Championship Games (third all-time) and 17 Final Fours (tied for third all-time with Kentucky and only behind North Carolina UConn) and UCLA). Additionally, all of Duke's championships were won after the NCAA instituted a shot clock. Duke has an NCAA-best .755 NCAA tournament winning percentage. Eleven Duke players have been named the National Player of the Year, and 71 players have been selected in the NBA draft. Additionally, Duke has had 36 players named All-Americans (chosen 60 times) and 14 players named Academic All-Americans. Duke has been the Atlantic Coast Conference Champions a record 22 times, and also lays claim to 19 ACC regular season titles. Prior to joining the ACC, Duke won the Southern Conference championships five times. Duke has also finished the season ranked No. 1 in the AP poll eight times and is the all-time leader in total weeks ranked as the number one team in the nation by the AP with 145 weeks. Additionally, the Blue Devils have the third longest streak in the AP Top 25 in history with 200 consecutive appearances from 1996 to 2007, trailing only Kansas' 231 consecutive polls from 2009 to 2021, and UCLA's 221 consecutive polls from 1966 to 1980.\nTeam history.\nEarly years (1906–1953).\nIn 1906, Wilbur Wade Card, Trinity College's Athletic Director and a member of the Class of 1900, introduced the game of basketball to Trinity. The January 30 issue of The Trinity Chronicle headlined the new sport on its front page. Trinity's first game ended in a loss to Wake Forest, 24–10. The game was played in the Angier B. Duke Gymnasium, later known as The Ark. The Trinity team won its first title in 1920, the state championship, by beating the North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering (now NC State) 25 to 24. Earlier in the season they had beaten the University of North Carolina 19–18 in the first match-up between the two schools. Trinity college then became Duke University.\nBilly Werber, Class of 1930, became Duke's first All-American in basketball. The Gothic-style West Campus opened that year, with a new gym, later to be named for Coach Card. The Indoor Stadium opened in 1940. Initially it was referred to as an \"Addition\" to the gymnasium. Part of its cost was paid for with the proceeds from the Duke football team's appearance in the 1938 Rose Bowl. In 1972 it would be named for Eddie Cameron, head coach from 1929 to 1942.\nIn 1952, Dick Groat became the first Duke player to be named National Player of the Year. Duke left the Southern Conference to become a charter member of the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953. The Duke team under Vic Bubas made its first appearance in the Final Four in 1963, losing 94–75 to Loyola Chicago in the semifinal. The next year, Bubas' team reached the national title game, losing to the Bruins of UCLA, which claimed the first of that program's 10 titles in the next 12 years. Bob Verga was Duke's star player in 1967.\nBill Foster (1974–1980).\nThe basketball program won its 1000th game in 1974, making Duke only the eighth school in NCAA history to reach that figure. In a turnaround, Coach Bill Foster's 1978 Blue Devils, who had gone 2–10 in the ACC the previous year, won the conference tournament and went on to the NCAA championship game, where they fell to Kentucky. Gene Banks, Mike Gminski ('80) and Jim Spanarkel ('79) ran the floor.\nMike Krzyzewski (1980–2022).\nMike Krzyzewski was at Duke from 1980 to 2022.\nKrzyzewski's teams made the Final Four in 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2010, 2015 and 2022.\nIn Krzyzewski's first season, the Blue Devils would finish the season with a 17–13 overall record and 6–8 record in ACC play. The team would later play in the NIT tournament advancing to the quarterfinals. Despite having a good record the previous season, the Blue Devils would struggle during the next two seasons finishing with 10 wins in 1982 and 11 wins in 1983. The 1984 team, led by Tommy Amaker &amp; Johnny Dawkins, would bounce back in strong fashion finishing 24–10 and was ranked the No.14 in the AP and Coaches poll, but lost in the second round of the NCAA tournament to the Washington Huskies (having earned a first-round bye).\nIn 1985 Duke defeated Pepperdine in the first round of the NCAA tournament, for Krzyzewski's first tournament win, but lost to Boston College in the second round 74–73. The next season the Blue Devils made their first Final Four under Krzyzewski. They beat Kansas to advance to the title game against Louisville, where they ultimately lost 72-69.\nDuke upset the heavily favored UNLV Runnin' Rebels 79–77 in the Final Four in 1991, a rematch of the 1990 final in which Duke lost by 30 points. The team, led by Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley, Grant Hill, and Thomas Hill, went on to defeat Kansas 72–65 to win the university's first NCAA Championship. Ranked #1 all season and favored to repeat as national champions in 1992, Duke took part in a game \"acclaimed by many [as] the greatest college basketball game ever played,\" according to ESPN. In the Elite Eight, Duke met the Rick Pitino-led Kentucky Wildcats. It appeared Kentucky had sealed the win in overtime when guard Sean Woods hit a running shot off the glass in the lane to put Kentucky up by one with 2.1 seconds left on the clock. After a timeout, Duke's Grant Hill threw a full-court pass to Christian Laettner. Laettner took one dribble and nailed a turn-around jumper at the buzzer to send Duke into the Final Four with a 104–103 victory (The Shot). Duke went on to defeat sixth-seeded Michigan, led by the Fab Five as freshmen starters including Chris Webber, Jalen Rose and Juwan Howard, 71–51 to repeat as national champions. Following the successful repeat, Laettner was the only collegiate player to be chosen for the Dream Team that won Olympic gold in Barcelona, while Krzyzewski was an assistant coach under Chuck Daly of the Detroit Pistons in a precursor to his becoming Team USA coach in 2006 and coaching them to two gold medals.\nThey would later meet Kentucky for another classic regional final game, but blow a 17-point second half lead in losing to the Wildcats. The Blue Devils would lose the 1994 title game to Arkansas and their \"Forty Minutes of Hell\" defense. The next two seasons would see them fall to just 31–31, though they made the 1996 tournament with an 18–12 record, 8–8 in conference play. They would also fall in the 1999 title game, this time to Jim Calhoun and the UConn Huskies. Duke defeated Arizona 82–72 to win its third NCAA Championship in 2001, becoming one of a handful of teams in NCAA Tournament history to defeat all of their tournament opponents by double digits. Krzyzewski was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame later that year. On April 5, 2010, Duke Men's Basketball won their fourth NCAA Championship by defeating Butler 61–59. On April 6, 2015, Duke's Men's Basketball won their fifth NCAA Championship by defeating Wisconsin 68–63.\nCoach K announced that the 2021–22 season would be his last coaching for Duke. Making it to the Final Four one last time, Duke fell just short of the championship game losing to the North Carolina Tar Heels 81–77 in the first ever meeting between the rivals in the NCAA Tournament.\nJon Scheyer (2022–present).\nOn June 2, 2022, Scheyer was named as the new head coach at Duke following Krzyzewski's retirement. On March 11, 2023, he became the first person to win an ACC tournament title as both a coach and a player.\nFormer Duke stars such as Jim Spanarkel, Gene Banks, Alaa Abdelnaby, Johnny Dawkins, Cherokee Parks, Bobby Hurley, Antonio Lang, Roshown McLeod, William Avery, Trajan Langdon, Grant Hill, Danny Ferry, Christian Laettner, Kenny Dennard, Brian Davis, Elton Brand, Shane Battier, Carlos Boozer, Chris Duhon, Mike Dunleavy Jr., Dahntay Jones, Daniel Ewing, JJ Redick, Shavlik Randolph, Shelden Williams, Corey Maggette, Luol Deng, Josh McRoberts, Gerald Henderson, Andre Dawkins, Austin Rivers, Lance Thomas, Kyle Singler, Miles Plumlee, Mason Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee, Bob Verga, Quinn Cook, Nolan Smith, Jason Williams, Jabari Parker, Rodney Hood, Seth Curry, Kyrie Irving, Matt Jones, Amile Jefferson, Jahlil Okafor, Tyus Jones, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen, Brandon Ingram, Luke Kennard, Jayson Tatum, Harry Giles, Frank Jackson, Gary Trent Jr., Trevon Duval, Marvin Bagley III, Wendell Carter Jr., RJ Barrett, Marques Bolden, Cam Reddish, Zion Williamson, Tre Jones, Vernon Carey Jr., Cassius Stanley, Jalen Johnson, Paolo Banchero, Mark Williams, Wendell Moore Jr., Trevor Keels and AJ Griffin have gone on to play in the NBA.\nMany of Krzyzewski's assistants and former players, such as Tommy Amaker (Seton Hall, University of Michigan and Harvard), Bob Bender (Illinois State University and University of Washington), Chuck Swenson at William &amp; Mary, Mike Brey (Delaware and Notre Dame), Jeff Capel (VCU, Oklahoma and Pittsburgh), Chris Collins (Northwestern), Johnny Dawkins (Stanford, UCF), Quin Snyder (Missouri, Utah Jazz, Atlanta Hawks), and Steve Wojciechowski (Marquette) have become head basketball coaches at major universities and the NBA, while Pete Gaudet is now the head coach of the India women's national basketball team.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1978 edition.\"\nComplete NCAA tournament results.\nThe Blue Devils have appeared in the NCAA tournament 46 times. Their combined record is 122–40.\nNIT results.\nThe Blue Devils have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) five times. Their combined record is 5–6.\nKey statistics.\nAs of the 2017–18 season, the Blue Devils' program record is as follows.\nDuke has been ranked as the #1 team in the nation 235 weeks in their history.\nDuke had not lost a non-conference game at Cameron from 2000 until 2019, when SFASU beat Duke in overtime (85–83). Duke maintains a tradition of hosting the previous season's Division II national champion in an exhibition game each November.\nCameron Indoor Stadium.\nCameron Indoor Stadium was completed on January 6, 1940, having cost $400,000. At the time, it was the largest gymnasium in the country south of the Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania. Originally called Duke Indoor Stadium, it was renamed for Coach Cameron on January 22, 1972. The building originally included seating for 8,800, though standing room was sufficient to ensure that 12,000 could fit in on a particularly busy day. Then, as now, Duke students were allowed a large chunk of the seats, including those directly alongside the court. Renovations in 1987–1988 removed the standing room areas and added seats, bringing capacity to 9,314.\nCameron Crazies.\nDuke's men's basketball teams have had a decided home-court advantage for many years, thanks to the diehard students known as the Cameron Crazies. The hardwood floor has been dedicated and renamed \"Coach K Court\" in honor of head coach Mike Krzyzewski, and the tent city outside Cameron where students camp out before big games is known as Krzyzewskiville. In 1999, \"Sports Illustrated\" ranked Cameron the fourth best venue in all of professional and college sports, and \"USA Today\" referred to it as \"the toughest road game in the nation\".\nPlayer awards.\nACC Defensive Player of the Year.\n\"(since 2005)\"\nMcDonald's All-Americans.\nThe following 78 McDonald's All-Americans have signed and played for Duke. \nCurrent Blue Devils in the NBA.\nAs of February 9, 2023, these former Blue Devils players were in the NBA: \nRivalries.\nThe Duke–North Carolina rivalry is often ranked among the top rivalries in both college basketball and all North American sports. Entering the 2023 - 2024 season, North Carolina leads the rivalry, winning 141 games to Duke's 115. The Duke Blue Devils face the North Carolina Tar Heels twice each year during ACC play, with thousands of Duke undergraduate students participating in an annual tradition of camping out in Krzyzewskiville, a lawn in front of Cameron Indoor Stadium, for months to line up for admission into the rivalry game. The two teams always face each other for their last game of the regular season, with the home team hosting their Senior Night. Some years, the two teams meet for a third game in the ACC tournament. The teams have met twice in post-season tournament play. In 2022, the two schools met in the Final Four to face each other in the NCAA Tournament for the first time. In that game, the Tar Heels defeated the Blue Devils 81–77. In 1971 the two rivals met in the semi-finals of the NIT, a game also won by North Carolina by a score of 73 - 69. Duke also has rivalries with NC State and Wake Forest, and together with UNC, the 4 schools form Tobacco Road. \nDuke and North Carolina have combined for 11 national championships, with North Carolina leading Duke 6–5. The intensity of the rivalry is augmented by the proximity of the two universities, located only ten miles apart along U.S. Highway 15–501 (also known as Tobacco Road) or eight miles apart in straight-line distance in the cities of Durham and Chapel Hill. In addition, Duke is a private university whereas North Carolina is a public school; the vastly different funding structures and cultures between the two further contribute to the intensity of the rivalry.\nFormer \"Esquire\" editor and author (and North Carolina graduate) Will Blythe argues that the rivalry's passion can be attributed greatly to class and culture in the South.\nThe rivalry has been the subject of various books and articles, including \"To Hate Like This Is to Be Happy Forever\" by Blythe and \"Blue Blood\" by Art Chansky.\nFurther illustrating the intensity of the rivalry, U.S. Representative Brad Miller, a die-hard Carolina fan, told an Associated Press writer in 2012, \"I have said very publicly that if Duke was playing against the Taliban, then I'd have to pull for the Taliban.\"\nHowever, also due to the close proximity of the two schools, there is respect and collaboration within the rivalry. Inspired by the men's basketball teams, twenty-four students from the two schools got together from January 14–16, 2006 in order to attempt to break the world record for the longest continuous game of basketball ever recorded. The game set a new world record at 57 hours, 17 minutes and 41 seconds with Duke winning the game 3699–3444. All $60,000 raised from the marathon benefited the Hoop Dreams Basketball Academy, an organization which helps children with life-threatening illnesses develop successful life skills through basketball.\nBeyond athletics, the school papers have also engaged in the rivalry. As a tradition, one day prior to a Duke-North Carolina basketball game, \"The Chronicle\", Duke's student newspaper, publishes a spoof cover page for the day's edition with the title \"The Daily Tar Hole\". Contained within are satirical stories poking fun at \"The Daily Tar Heel\" and the North Carolina Tar Heels. \"The Daily Tar Heel\" typically publishes former columnist Ian Williams' \"Insider's guide to hating Duke\" for the two basketball match-ups each year. There is a longstanding agreement that if Duke wins the first matchup, \"The Daily Tar Heel\"s masthead is printed in Duke blue, and if North Carolina wins the first matchup, \"The Chronicle\"s masthead is painted Carolina blue. The losing school's paper also has to put the other school's logo in a conspicuous location and claim that the winning school is \"still the best.\"\nThe Michigan Wolverines and the Maryland Terrapins basketball teams have also claimed rivalries against the Blue Devils, but Duke has long rejected both claims and considers North Carolina to be its only rival.\nPerception.\nThe Duke men's basketball team has been noted as a particularly hated team within the sport. Some of the hate comes from fans of rival teams, most notably the North Carolina Tar Heels. However, the hate extends beyond rivalries to other fans. The hate is often tied to Duke's record, as the team have experienced success in most seasons since the 1990s.\nThe hate is often tied to specific players. Christian Laettner, who played for Duke from 1988 to 1992 as they won two national championships, is often named as one of most hated players in college basketball. The 2015 documentary \"I Hate Christian Laettner\" names five main reasons for the hate: \"privilege, race, bully, greatness and looks\". JJ Redick, who played at Duke from 2002 to 2006 also experienced hatred and animosity from fans during his tenure. Another particularly hated player is Grayson Allen, who played for Duke from 2014 to 2018. In addition to many of the reasons Laettner was hated, Allen was also targeted after several incidents in which he deliberately tripped opposing players.\nBy the numbers.\nVictories over AP No. 1 team.\nDuke has 10 victories over the AP number one ranked team."

        "title": "History of cricket in New Zealand to 1890",
        "text": "This article describes the history of New Zealand cricket to 1890.\nHistorical background.\nEuropean colonisation of New Zealand, particularly by British settlers, began in earnest after 1800. It may safely be assumed that cricket was first played there soon after the English arrived.\nThe earliest definite reference to cricket in New Zealand appears in 1832 in the diary of Archdeacon Henry Williams.\nThree years later, HMS Beagle visited the Bay of Islands on its voyage round the globe. Charles Darwin watched a game of cricket at Waimate North being played by freed Maori slaves and the son of a missionary. In \"The Voyage of the Beagle\" he wrote: \"Several young men redeemed by the missionaries from slavery were employed on the farm. In the evening I saw a party of them at cricket.\"\nDomestic cricket.\nEarly developments to 1863–64.\nThe first recorded formal game of cricket in New Zealand took place in Wellington on 28 December 1842. The \"Wellington Spectator\" reported the game, played between a \"Red\" team and a \"Blue\" team from the Wellington Club. In March 1844 the \"Examiner\" in Nelson reported a match between the Surveyors of the Land Company and Nelson.\nIn March 1860, the first inter-provincial match was played, a one-day match in Wellington between teams representing Wellington and Auckland. Other games soon followed but they were all one-day matches that are not considered to have been first-class.\nThe inaugural first-class match in New Zealand was Otago v Canterbury at the South Dunedin Recreation Ground on 27–29 January 1864. It was arranged as a 3-day match with 4-ball overs. Canterbury won the toss and decided to field but Otago won by 76 runs.\nDespite this being the inaugural first class match in New Zealand, five of the Otago players had previous first class experience, from intercolonial cricket in Australia with Victoria. Nevertheless, it was a debutant, 32-year-old James Fulton, who passed 25 for the first time. John Mace, a former Victoria player, and MacDonald, born in Victoria, then bowled Canterbury out for 34 by the end of the first day. On the second day, Otago batted out 65.1 overs to make 74, before Mace and MacDonald struck with four and six wickets each to win the game.\nThe Otago v Canterbury fixture was played annually from 1864 onwards and became part of the Plunket Shield in the 1911–12 season.\n1864–65.\nThe only first class match was the first to be played in Canterbury Province. It was the second Canterbury v Otago game. The match took place on 6 &amp; 7 February 1865 at Hayley Park in Christchurch. Canterbury won by 4 wickets. Otago scored 73 &amp; 61; Canterbury scored 80 &amp; 55–6.\nIn 1864, Otago had fielded five players with first class experience in Victoria; and a sixth who was born in Victoria. In 1865, those players were gone and the teams were more balanced. As in 1864, Otago captain James Fulton top-scored with 22 in the first innings, but four Canterbury players (including both openers) made double-figure scores and Canterbury took a first innings lead of seven. Canterbury captain Henry Lance then had Fulton stumped for seven, and made 12 in the chase of 55 after coming in at 27 for three. Andrew Bloxham, who played his one and only first-class game, made 18 in the first innings and 10 in the second and was Canterbury's top scorer.\n1865–66.\nOn 13 &amp; 14 February at South Dunedin Recreation Ground, Otago v Canterbury. Otago won by 2 wickets. Canterbury scored 68 &amp; 97; Otago scored 105 &amp; 62–8.\nArthur Powys, recalled as captain of Canterbury after missing the 1865 fixture, chose to bat. Otago took a first innings lead of 37 on the first day. Augustus Tennant, playing in his final game, made 24 for Canterbury in the second innings, but a 17-run partnership between Worthington and Murison took Otago within two runs of victory and Worthington managed to get the winning runs.\n1866–67.\nOn 7 &amp; 8 February at Hagley Oval in Christchurch, Canterbury v Otago. Otago won by an innings and 37 runs. Canterbury scored 25 &amp; 32; Otago scored 94.\nThis was the first match played at the Hagley Oval, which became a regular venue up to 1881. The Canterbury totals of 25 and 32 were record lows in New Zealand first-class cricket, while John Hope hit a new first-class best of 28 for Otago as they managed 94 in their first innings, having been asked to bat second. Otago bowler William Downes took 10–22 in the match, while 20-year-old debutant George Young took six wickets for Canterbury.\n1867–68 to 1872–73.\nThe Otago v Canterbury series continued through these seasons as the only domestic first-class fixture. In the 1868–69 match Canterbury's Arthur Cotterill scored 72, the first fifty in New Zealand first-class cricket.\n1873–74.\nThe number of first-class teams was expanded to five. Otago and Canterbury continued their annual series, and both played their inaugural first-class matches against Auckland. Auckland made their first \"southern tour\", playing Canterbury, Otago and Wellington in the second half of November 1873, and winning all three matches. Wellington also played the fifth debutant, Nelson.\n1874–75 to 1889–90.\nAuckland, Canterbury, Otago and Wellington played regularly and became established first-class teams.\nIn 1880–81 George Watson of Canterbury scored New Zealand's first first-class century, finishing on 175. Canterbury totalled 381, which was the highest innings total to that date.\nFor details of the 1882–83 season, see: 1882–83 New Zealand cricket season\nInternational tours of New Zealand to 1890.\nGeorge Parr's XI 1863–64.\nAn English team led by George Parr made the first overseas tour of New Zealand in February 1864, playing five matches in the South Island. The local teams fielded 22, so none of the matches are rated first-class. The team toured Australia before and after the New Zealand leg of the tour.\nJames Lillywhite's XI 1876–77.\nMidway through their tour of Australia, James Lillywhite's team played eight non-first-class matches in New Zealand between late January and early March 1877. They won six matches and drew two. Their next match, on their return to Australia, was the first-ever Test match.\nAustralia 1877–78.\nAustralia toured in January and February 1878, playing seven non-first-class matches against provincial teams, winning four and losing one, against Canterbury.\nAustralia 1880–81.\nAustralia toured in January and February 1881, playing 12 non-first-class matches against provincial teams, winning six and losing one, against Wanganui.\nAlfred Shaw's XI 1881–82.\nBetween the First and Second Tests of their Australian tour, Shaw's XI toured New Zealand from early January to early February 1882, playing seven non-first-class matches against provincial teams, winning three and drawing four.\nTasmania 1883–84.\nTasmania toured the South Island in February 1884, playing four first-class matches – two against Otago and two against Canterbury – as well as three other matches. Canterbury won both matches; Otago won one and drew the other.\nAustralia 1886–87.\nAustralia toured in November and December 1886 and played five non-first-class matches against provincial teams, winning two and drawing three.\nArthur Shrewsbury's XI 1887–88.\nAfter their tour of Australia, Shrewsbury's team played three non-first-class matches in New Zealand in March. All three were drawn.\nNew South Wales 1889–90.\nNew South Wales toured from late January to early March 1890, playing five first-class matches. After drawing the first match against Auckland, they beat Canterbury, Otago, Wellington, and Auckland in a second match. Sydney Callaway took 32 wickets, and later moved to New Zealand, where he played for Canterbury.\nLeading players.\nWhen the cricket historian Tom Reese compiled his history of early New Zealand cricket, \"New Zealand Cricket, 1841–1914\", in 1927, he selected a 14-man team of the best New Zealand cricketers of the period from 1860 to 1914. His idea was that the team would be a touring team to England or elsewhere.\nReese added that De Maus had obtained the last batting spot just ahead of Len Cuff, Alfred Holdship and Kinder Tucker. He did not consider for selection those who had established reputations in Australia before they moved to New Zealand, such as Syd Callaway, Alfred Clarke, Harry Graham and Charles Richardson."

        "title": "History of cricket in the West Indies to 1918",
        "text": "This article describes the history of West Indies cricket to 1918.\nHistorical background.\nThe development of cricket in all countries has been shaped by historical events but perhaps nowhere else is this more so than in the West Indies where not only colonialism, but also slavery shaped society.\nIn 1492, the \"New World\" was discovered by a Spanish naval expedition under Columbus which reached the Caribbean Sea and found the Bahamas; and hence the creation of the West Indies.\nIn 1609, the first British settlement in the West Indies was on Bermuda by shipwrecked English colonists originally bound for Virginia. The settlement became permanent in 1612. In 1623, the first British colony in the Caribbean itself was established at St Kitts in the Leeward Islands. In 1628, British colonists began to settle on Barbados which had been uninhabited. Sugar plantations were soon developed and large numbers of African slaves were brought in to work them. Another British colony was established on Nevis. In 1632, more British colonies were established on Montserrat, Antigua and Barbuda.\nWe do not know when or where cricket was first played in the West Indies but it is reasonable to assume that it was introduced by these early colonists.\n1655 is a significant year in British colonisation of the West Indies for its forces under Admiral Sir William Penn and General Robert Venables seized the Spanish island of Jamaica, full colonisation commencing in 1661. The cultivation of sugar cane and coffee by African slave labour made Jamaica one of the most valuable possessions in the world for more than 150 years. The colony's slaves, who outnumbered their white masters 300,000 to 30,000 by 1800, mounted over a dozen major slave conspiracies and uprisings between 1673 and 1832.\nBy the 1660s, British holdings in the West Indies included Jamaica, Barbados, Bermuda, Bahamas, St Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, Montserrat, Antigua and Barbuda.\nGreat Britain's other West Indies territories came into the story later.\nThe islands of Dominica, Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines were initially claimed by France in the 17th century but were all ceded to Great Britain under the terms of the Treaty of Paris 1763 that ended the Seven Years' War.\nSt Lucia was first colonised by France in 1660 but seized by the British in 1663. It was then the subject of no less than 14 separate conflicts between the two before Britain finally secured control in 1814 at the end of the Napoleonic War.\nThe group now known as the British Virgin Islands had been settled by the Dutch in 1648 but they were annexed by the British in 1672. Sugar cane was introduced by the British and it soon became the main crop. Initially, labour was indented by 'transported' British convicts and from Ireland. African slaves were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century.\nGuyana was first settled by the Dutch, who established three separate colonies at Essequibo (1616), Berbice (1627) and Demerara (1752). The British assumed control in 1796 and, following counter-revolts, the Dutch formally ceded the area in 1814. The three became a single British colony known as British Guiana in 1831. There were major slave revolts in 1763, and also in 1823. The Guyana plantations were originally coffee and cotton but, as elsewhere in the Caribbean area, sugar eventually superseded them.\nTrinidad and Tobago were found by Columbus in 1498. Although Spanish settlement of Trinidad began in the sixteenth century, the population in 1783 was only 2,763 with the majority being Amerindians. In 1783, the proclamation of a Cedula of Population by the Spanish Crown granted of land to each Catholic who settled in Trinidad and half as much for each slave that they brought. Uniquely, was offered to each Free Coloured or Free Person of Colour and half as much for each slave they brought. In the tumult of the Haitian and French Revolutions, many people migrated from the French islands to Trinidad. This resulted in Trinidad having the unique feature of a large Free Coloured slave-owning class. By the time the island was surrendered to the British in 1797 the population had increased to 17,643: 2,086 whites, 1,082 free people of colour, 1,082 Amerindians, and 10,009 African slaves. Spanish rule over the island, which nominally began in 1498, ended when the final Spanish Governor, Don José Maria Chacón surrendered the island to a British fleet of 18 warships under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie on 18 February 1797.\nTobago's development was similar to other plantation islands in the Lesser Antilles but quite different from that of Trinidad. During the colonial period, French, Dutch, British and Courlanders (Latvians) fought over possession of Tobago and the island changed hands 22 times: more often than any other West Indian island. Tobago was finally ceded to Great Britain in 1814. The two islands were incorporated into a single Crown Colony in 1888 with Tobago reduced to the status of a Ward of Trinidad.\nThe Abolition of the Slave Trade Act was passed by the British Parliament on 25 March 1807. The Act imposed a fine of £100 for every slave found aboard a British ship. The intention was to entirely outlaw the slave trade within the British Empire. In 1827, Britain declared that participation in the slave trade was piracy and punishable by death.\nOn 23 August 1833, the Slavery Abolition Act outlawed slavery in all British colonies. On 1 August 1834, all slaves in the British Empire were emancipated. Some remained indentured to their former owners in an apprenticeship system which was finally abolished in 1838. £20 million was paid in compensation to plantation owners in the Caribbean. From then on indented labour from India, China and elsewhere was imported. This created the ethnic pot pourri of the region's population.\nEarly cricket references.\nThe game was taken to the West Indies by British colonists and soldiers.\n1865 to 1890.\nInter-Colonial matches were sporadic in the early years of West Indian cricket, mainly because of travel difficulties between the islands and there were only 10 such matches up to 1890, involving Barbados, British Guiana and Trinidad. These ten games are generally regarded as first-class matches.\nThe British Guiana team was often referred to as Demerara and the two names seem to have been interchangeable at first. British Guiana is used here throughout until the country was renamed as Guyana.\nEarliest first-class matches.\nThe 1864–65 season included the inaugural first-class match in the West Indies between Barbados and British Guiana at Garrison Savannah in Bridgetown on 15–16 February 1865. Barbados won a low scoring match by 138 runs. Augustus and Frederick Smith, two uncles of Sydney Smith took the wickets for Barbados and dismissed British Guiana for 22 and 38.\nEdwin Beete, one of the British Guiana side, was later quoted as follows: \"On the Friday morning we went to the Garrison and practised on the pitch there. Consequently the islanders had to prepare a pitch on the Savannah. And such a pitch! The outfield was very high with grass, you could not run after a ball. The pitch itself was so studded with small pieces of corral that the ball had to be changed twice in an innings which lasted about two hours and mangled balls were brought back as a memento. We practised on Saturday and the match was fixed for the Monday and Tuesday following but was postponed until the Wednesday and Thursday\".\nA return match was arranged for the following season in September 1865. Barbados batted first and scored 111 with Thomas Daly taking 4–30 bowling underarm. In reply British Guiana were all out for 82 which included 34 extras, George Whitehall taking 4–16. British Guiana were then set 146 to win which they made with 2 wickets remaining, William Watson batting throughout for 39*. As in the previous match the Smith brothers took most of the wickets for Barbados.\nAfter this game, various social events were organised including a boat trip on the steamer \"Berbice\" up the Essequebo River to the Penal Settlement at the junction of the Cuyuni and Massaruni Rivers and to take place from 18 to 20 September. A trip up the Massaruni was arranged in three smaller boats and during this it was decided to shoot the Koestrabraek Falls. One of the boats, the Lady Wodehouse, capsized in the falls and seven people were drowned including two of the British Guiana team, Henry Beresford and Richard Stewart.\nWest Indian cricket to 1918.\nInter-Colonial Tournament.\nThe 1891–92 season saw the first Inter-Colonial Tournament in the West Indies take place in Barbados between Barbados, British Guiana and Trinidad. Matches took place at the Wanderers Ground, Bay Pasture in Bridgetown between 1 and 10 September 1891. Barbados beat British Guiana by 4 wickets, British Guiana beat Trinidad by 151 runs and Barbados beat Trinidad by an innings and 93 runs. The final was then contested between Barbados and British Guiana. Barbados won this match by an innings and 55 runs.\nDuring this tournament a suggestion was made by Hon. Aucher Warner that there should be a regular series of matches between the three colonies to be played alternately at each colony. By the time of the next tournament in 1893 a cup had been subscribed for but British Guiana were unable to take part, Barbados being winners again. This 1893 match is regarded as the first proper tournament because of the trophy being awarded.\nThe inter-colonial tournament was restricted to amateurs and that this excluded many of the leading black cricketers who were often professionals. In addition, because of the distances and travelling costs involved, Jamaica never took part in the tournament.\nThe tournaments took place irregularly until the Second World War, winners to 1918 being:\nEnglish tours of the West Indies.\nThe 1894–95 season featured the first tour of the West Indies by an English team. This was a team of amateurs captained by R Slade Lucas. They played a total of 16 matches between January and April 1895 of which eight are considered first-class matches. See: RS Lucas' XI cricket team in West Indies in 1894-95.\nThe 1896–97 season had \"two\" English teams on tour. See: AA Priestley's XI cricket team in West Indies in 1896-97 and Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in West Indies in 1896-97. There were further privately organised tours in the next ten years: RA Bennett's XI cricket team in West Indies in 1901-02 and Lord Brackley's XI cricket team in West Indies in 1904-05.\nThe first team organised by MCC arrived in 1910–11 and played twelve matches, eleven of which are first-class. See: English cricket team in West Indies in 1910-11.\nAnother MCC team toured in 1912–13. See: English cricket team in West Indies in 1912-13.\nPhiladelphian tour.\nSee: Philadelphian cricket team in Jamaica in 1908-09"

        "title": "International Boxing Association",
        "text": "The International Boxing Association (IBA), previously known as the Association Internationale de Boxe Amateur (AIBA), is an international sports organization that sanctions amateur (Olympic-style) boxing matches and awards world and subordinate championships. IBA consists of five continental confederations: AFBC, AMBC, ASBC, EUBC, and OCBC. The association includes 203 national boxing federations.\nThe IBA was recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the international governing body for the sport of boxing until 2019, when the IOC suspended its recognition of the federation; in 2023, the IOC formally stripped the IBA of its status, upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2024.\nThere are five confederations of IBA: African Boxing Confederation, American Boxing Confederation, Asian Boxing Confederation, European Boxing Confederation, Oceania Boxing Confederation.\nCompetitions.\nUnder the leadership of President Wu Ching-kuo, who ran AIBA from 2006 to 2017, the organization divided its competitions into three categories as part of Wu's overarching goal to govern boxing in all its forms:\nWu's two professional ventures were abandoned by AIBA largely due to the organization's financial woes, which led to Wu's resignation in November 2017. AIBA Pro Boxing staged bouts only from late 2014 to 2016, and the World Series of Boxing abruptly ceased operations amid mounting financial losses after its 2018 season.\nHistory.\n1920-2009.\nDuring the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, representatives from the national associations of England, France, Belgium, Brazil and the Netherlands met in a preliminary consortium for the foundation of an international boxing federation: The Fédération internationale de boxe amateur (FIBA). The official foundation has been celebrated on 24 August. Right after, international competitions appeared in the boxing arena, allowing amateurs to compete in well-known tournaments.\nIn November 1946, a consensus was met to give way for the boxing governing body to regain the loss of credibility due to the behavior of some leading officials in World War II. The FIBA was dissolved and the English Amateur Boxing Association in partnership with the French Boxing Federation decided to create AIBA; the Association Internationale de Boxe Amateur. The President of the French Boxing Federation, Emile Grémaux, was elected to the position of President.\nSixty years later, AIBA continued to govern boxing in the Olympic Games without using the word \"amateur\". Until now, amateur boxing has been present on all continents with continental championships as well as World Cups and World Championships organized by AIBA.\n2010-19.\nThe organization has been involved in multiple corruption scandals including on several editions of the Summer Olympic Games. In December 2017, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) expressed concerns about the governance of AIBA under Wu's leadership, and reaffirmed these concerns at an IOC Executive Board decision in February 2018. In June 2019, the IOC voted to suspend its recognition of AIBA as the governing body for the sport, stripping AIBA of any involvement in the Olympic Games. The IOC oversaw the qualification events and the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympic Games through a task force chaired by Morinari Watanabe (JPN), President of the International Gymnastics Federation.\n2020-22.\nOn December 12, 2020, Umar Kremlev was elected as AIBA President, gaining 57.33% of the vote. The IOC had concerns, but Kremlev declared himself \"the most clean candidate\" and promised reforms. On December 13, 2020, AIBA adopted a new constitution. In 2021, Olympic champion, two-time World champion István Kovács was appointed General Secretary of AIBA. Later that year, AIBA appointed Professor Ulrich Haas to lead the AIBA's Independent Governance Reform Group.\nUnder the new leadership, five new committees were created: the Coaches Committee, the Champions and Veterans Committee, the Competition Committee, the Women's Committee, and the Medical and Anti-Doping Committee. In the process of Umar Kremlev's reforms, AIBA increased the number of weight categories in amateur boxing for men and women to 13 and 12, respectively. The prize money for the World Championships was set at $100,000 for gold medal, $50,000 for silver and $25,000 for both bronze medals. A program of financial assistance to national federations was also introduced.\nOn April 7, 2021, AIBA's new management signed a cooperation agreement with Gazprom, because of which the Russian company received the status of the organization's General Partner. AIBA stated they had paid off all debts, including a $10 million debt to the Azerbaijani company Benkons LLC. On May 28, 2021, AIBA signed an agreement with the international military sports council CISM. In the same year, the organization signed an agreement with the International Testing Agency (ITA).\nTo reveal the facts of manipulation at the boxing tournament at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and corruption of the past AIBA administration, Canadian lawyer Professor Richard McLaren was appointed by AIBA to conduct a three-stage investigation. In September 2021, an independent report found that bouts leading up to and during the 2016 Rio Olympics were manipulated for money (up to $250,000), the perceived benefit of AIBA, or to thank National Federations, their Olympic committees, or hosts of competitions for their financial support and political backing. In December 2021, AIBA's National Federations implemented a series of constitutional amendments which included changing the abbreviated name to the IBA.\nThe International Olympic Committee has been concerned about the IBA under Kremlev's leadership. Kremlev has ties to Vladimir Putin, has moved much of the IBA's operations from Lausanne, Switzerland to Russia, has spent heavily on apparent self-promotion, and has opposed independent appointment of judges and referees. The IOC has also been alarmed by the fact that the IBA's only sponsor is a Russian company that supports the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In September 2022, the IBA voted against a presidential election, cementing Kremlev's position as the organization's president.\nIn late September, the IBA banned Ukraine's national federation, telling the Ukrainian junior boxing team they must compete under the IBA flag at the European championships in Italy. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) expressed serious concern over and stated it would conduct a full review about the decision in December. Ukrainian boxers refused to follow the requirements. On October 4, the IBA cancelled its previous decision and allowed Ukrainian boxers to compete under their flag. A day later, the IBA cancelled an IOC-imposed ban on boxers from Russia and Belarus from earlier that year in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian and Belarusian boxers were allowed to compete with national flags and anthems in events with immediate effect. On October 6, Finland and Sweden announced that they would boycott IBA events with Russian or Belarusian boxers. In November 2022, the IBA signed a cooperation agreement with the WBA.\n2023-present.\nIn February 2023, USA Boxing announced its decision to boycott the 2023 World Championships (organized by the International Boxing Association) where Russian and Belarusian athletes will compete with no restrictions, also accusing the IBA of attempting to sabotage IOC-approved qualification pathway for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Poland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Ireland, Czechia, Sweden and Canada later joined the U.S. Rival World Boxing was launched in April 2023 with its interim board including officials from member organizations of the Common Cause Alliance.\nThe IBA subsequently lost its IOC-recognized status in June 2023.\nHeadguards.\nAIBA changed its rules in 2013 to ban headguards in AOB Elite Men competitions (19–40 years old) at the national, continental and international levels. Headguards are still mandatory for all other category competitions, including women's boxing at all levels. The Boxing Task Force for the Tokyo Olympics maintained the ban on headguards for men, but Roy Jones Jr. and other prominent boxers have argued for their reinstatement in future tournaments.\nExternal links.\n "

        "text": "The 1985 Giro d'Italia was the 68th running of the Giro. It started in Palermo, on 16 May, with a prologue and concluded in Lucca, on 9 June, with a individual time trial. A total of 180 riders from twenty teams entered the 22-stage race, that was won by Frenchman Bernard Hinault of the team. The second and third places were taken by Italian Francesco Moser and American Greg LeMond, respectively.\nMoser led the race for the first two days after winning the opening prologue. He lost the lead to Giuseppe Saronni after his team won the stage three team time trial. Upon conclusion of the event's fourth stage, Roberto Visentini won sufficient time to take the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" () from Saronni. Visentini held the jersey for a total of eight days of racing, during which the race traversed the Dolomites, before losing it to Hinault after the stage 12 time trial. Hinault then successfully defended his lead through the Alps, all the way to the race's finish.\nAmongst the other classifications that the race awarded, Johan van der Velde of Vini Ricordi-Pinarello won the points classification, José Luis Navarro of Gemeaz Cusin-Zor won the mountains classification, and Sammontana-Bianchi's Alberto Volpi completed the Giro as the best neo-professional in the general classification, finishing tenth overall. Alpilatte-Olmo-Cierre finishing as the winners of the team classification, ranking each of the twenty teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time.\nTeams.\nA total of twenty teams were invited to participate in the 1985 Giro d'Italia, six of which were based outside of Italy. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 180 cyclists. The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager are introduced in front the media and local dignitaries – took place at the Verona Arena on 15 May. From the riders that began this edition, 135 made it to the finish in Lucca.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton did include the 1984 winner, Francesco Moser. Two–time champion Bernard Hinault entered the race with a strong supporting team as he sought a third overall victory. Author Bill McGann believed that going into the race Hinault was \"the world's most potent racing machine\" and that Moser would have to ride very well in order to repeat as champion. Mario Fossati of \"La Repubblica\" named Moser, Saronni, Hinault, and Greg LeMond as contenders for the overall crown. LeMond rode the Giro d'Italia for the first time this edition. Spanish rider Marino Lejarreta decided not to race the Vuelta a España in favor of racing the Giro. Luis Gómez, of \"El Pais\", believed Lejarreta to be in top form going into the race and that he could challenge for the overall victory. Javier Dalmases, an \"El Mundo\" sportswriter, believed that there was no clear favorite for the race. Prominent French rider Laurent Fignon did not participate in the race due to an inflamed Achilles tendon.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1985 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani on 16 February 1985. Covering a total of , it included four time trials (three individual and one for teams), and eleven stages with categorized climbs that awarded mountains classification points. Three of these eleven stages had summit finishes: stage 4, to Selva di Val Gardena; stage 14, to Gran Sasso d'Italia; and stage 20, to Valnontey di Cogne. The organizers chose to include two rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was longer and contained the same number of time trials and rest days. In addition, this race contained the same number of stages, but one more set of half stages.\nLuis Gómez, an \"El Pais\" writer, believed that the route was designed to benefit the Italian participants, with there being three individual time trials, the team time trial being flat, and most stages being primarily flat. \"El Mundo\" writer Javier Dalmases believed that the route was purposefully less mountainous so that an Italian would win the race, citing that this route favored the likes of Giuseppe Saronni or Moreno Argentin. \"La Stampa\"'s Gian Paolo Ormezzano thought overall easiness of the course — the few mountains and summit finishes — added some mystery as to who could win.\nRace overview.\nThe event began with a prologue around the city of Verona. The brief time trial leg was won by Francesco Moser, who finished seven seconds faster than the second placed rider. The following day was the first mass-start stage of the race, which culminated in a bunch sprint that was won by Atala-Ofmega-Campagnolo's Urs Freuler. The second stage was a team time trial that stretched . Del Tongo-Colnago won the leg and their rider, Giuseppe Saronni, earned enough of an advantage to take race lead and don the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" (). The third stage saw Saronni expand upon his lead by winning the leg after out-sprinting the rest of the leading group. The fourth stage took the race into the Dolomites, as well as featuring a summit finish on Selva di Val Gardena. Spanish rider Marino Lejarreta attacked with around to go and only Roberto Visentini, Bernard Hinault, Hubert Saiz, and Gianbattista Baronchelli were able to mark his move. The group of five stayed together to the finish as Saiz took the stage victory by edging out Hinault. Visentini took the race lead after Saronni finished over four minutes behind, while another Italian favorite Francesco Moser finished two minutes behind.\nThe route went through more mountains in the fifth stage. With large amounts of rain, the peloton made a truce and the stage saw few attacks. A three-man breakaway formed with around twelve kilometers to go. The riders stayed together and all sprinted for the stage win, which was originally won by Roberto Pagnin; however, due to his non-linear sprint line that interfered with the two other riders, he was relegated to second place and the original second-place finisher, Emanuele Bombini, was promoted and declared winner. The next day of racing ended with a bunch sprint won by Frank Hoste, but a crash with two kilometers to go from the finish saw general classification contenders Visentini and Saronni, as well as others, lose twenty seconds. The seventh stage saw a six-man breakaway survive and finish ahead of the peloton by almost two minutes as Orlando Maini won the day.\nThe twelfth stage of the race was individual time trial. Hinault won the stage by fifty-three seconds over Moser. Hinault's time gains were enough to give him the race lead by a minute and fourteen seconds. The thirteenth stage saw Freuler win his second stage of the race by virtue of a sprint finish. Italian Franco Chioccioli won the mountainous fourteenth leg of the event after attacking on the descent of the third climb of the day. The following day of racing began with a twenty-man breakaway forming off the front of the peloton; however, all but one rider was caught with ten kilometers remaining. With under five kilometers left, another four-man attack group formed, of which 's Ron Kiefel survived. Kiefel caught the lone remaining rider in front and went on to win the stage as the peloton crossed the line three seconds behind. This was the first stage victory by an American in the history of the Giro d'Italia. The sixteenth stage saw the day of racing end with a field sprint which was won by Saronni.\nRace leader Hinault and his team, , allowed a breakaway to get almost a twenty-minute advantage over the peloton during the race's seventeenth stage, before other general classification contenders' teams stepped in to help with the chase. The attack group reached the finish line around ten minutes faster than the peloton. Swiss rider Daniel Gisiger won the stage ahead of Giovanni Mantovani. Paolo Rosola won his second stage of the event as the eighteenth stage resulted in a bunch sprint. The following day's race route was altered the night before by Torriani, which removed six kilometers off the climb of Great St Bernard Pass, while it still contained the full climb of the \"Cima Coppi\", the Simplon Pass. The stage saw a large group of fifty-three riders cross the finish line together, with Moser at the head, taking his second stage victory of the event. Former race leader Visentini, after losing a significant amount of time during the stage 16 individual time trial, abandoned the race during the nineteenth stage.\nStage 20 was a brief that featured a seventeen kilometer ascent to finish the leg. La Vie Claire drove a hard pace throughout the stage and fractured the peloton in the process. American Andrew Hampsten attacked with around nineteen kilometers to go and won the stage by a minute over the second-place finisher. The penultimate stage of the race was culminated with a field sprint, which was won by Freuler. The final stage of the race was a individual time trial that stretched from Lido di Camaiore to Lucca. Moser was able to win the stage by seven seconds on race leader Hinault, which was not enough to overcome Hinault and take first. This meant Hinault won his third Giro d'Italia.\nSix riders achieved multiple stage victories: Freuler (stages 1, 13, and 21), Moser (prologue and stages 19 and 22), da Silva (stages 8b and 10), Allocchio (stages 8a and 11), Saronni (stages 3 and 16), and Rosola (stages 9 and 18). Stage wins were achieved by nine of the twenty competing squads, six of which won multiple stages. Del Tongo-Colnago collected a total of five wins through the team time trial, Saronni, Bombini (stage 5), and Hoste (stage 6). Atala-Ofmega-Campagnolo amassed a total of four stage wins through Freuler and Gisiger (stage 17). Malvor-Bottecchia also secured four stage wins through da Silva and Allocchio. Sammontana-Bianchi obtained two stage victories with Rosola. Gis Gelati-Trentino Vacanze collected two stage successes with Moser. 7-Eleven recorded two stage wins with Kiefel (stage 15) and Hampsten (stage 20). Cilo-Aufina, Alpilatte-Olmo-Cierre, and La Vie Claire all won a single stage at the Giro, the first through Seiz (stage 4), the second through Maini (stage 7), and the third by Hinault (stage 12), and the fourth with Chioccioli (stage 14).\nClassification leadership.\nFour different jerseys were worn during the 1985 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first four finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Simplon Pass. The first rider to cross the Simplon Pass was Colombian rider Reynel Montoya. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

        "text": "The men's foil was one of eight fencing events on the fencing at the 1964 Summer Olympics programme. It was the fourteenth appearance of the event. The competition was held from October 13 to October 14, 1964. 55 fencers from 21 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Egon Franke of Poland, the nation's first victory in the men's foil. France returned to the podium after a one-Games absence, with Jean-Claude Magnan taking silver and Daniel Revenu the bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Five of the eight finalists from 1960 returned: gold medalist Viktor Zhdanovich of the Soviet Union, bronze medalist Albie Axelrod of the United States, fourth-place finisher Witold Woyda of Poland, fifth-place finisher Mark Midler of the Soviet Union, and seventh-place finisher Bill Hoskyns of Great Britain. Jean-Claude Magnan of France was the reigning world champion. The previous two world champions, Ryszard Parulski of Poland and German Sveshnikov, were also competing in Tokyo.\nIran, Malaysia, and South Korea each made their debut in the men's foil. The United States made its 13th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 competition.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1964 tournament introduced a hybrid pool-play and knockout format. The competition began with two rounds of pool play. In each round, the fencers were divided into pools to play a round-robin within the pool. Bouts were to five touches. Barrages were used to break ties necessary for advancement. The competition then shifted to knockout rounds. These rounds used a single-elimination tournament format to reduce the remaining field from 24 to 16, then from 16 to 8, then from 8 to 4. There were also classification semifinals and a fifth-place match for the quarterfinal losers. Bouts in these knockout rounds were to 10 touches. The four quarterfinal winners then resumed pool play once again for the final.\nStandard foil rules were used, including that touches had to be made with the tip of the foil, the target area was limited to the torso, and priority determined the winner of double touches.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nPool A.\nThe three-way tie for third-place resulted in a barrage in the first pool. After each fencer went 1-1 in the barrage, touches received was used to break the tie. Cohen's 6 gave him the win over McKenzie's 7 and Elkalyoubi's 8; Cohen received third place. The tie-breaker then went back to head-to-head results between the two remaining fencers in the barrage to assign fourth place; Elkalyoubi had defeated McKenzie in their bout (and, incidentally, had defeated him in the main pool as well), so he placed fourth and advanced while McKenzie was eliminated.\nPool B.\nThe second pool required no barrage; ties within the top four were nominally broken by touches against (15-18 in favor of Sehem in the top two places) and then touches scored (21-18 for Okawa after he and Curletto tied at 18-18 in touches against).\nPool E.\nTouches against were 12-16-19 to break the three-way tie for second place.\nPool I.\nTouches against were 14-18-20 to break the three-way tie for second and 22-24 to break the two-way tie for fifth.\nRound 2.\nPool A.\nTouches against were 16-16-19 to break the three-way tie for second into second/third and fourth places, with touches scored 23-22 to separate second and third.\nPool B.\nTouches against broke the tie for second and third, with 14-16. Since the tie for fourth and fifth determined advancement, another bout was fenced. Tabuchi, who had won the main-pool bout, defeated Sehem again in the barrage to win a qualification spot.\nPool C.\nThe three-way tie for first was broken by touches against (16-18-20), but the three-way tie for fourth required a barrage. Elkalyoubi, fencing in the first two bouts of the barrage, won both to clinch advancement and make a bout between Granieri and Haukler unnecessary. Their main-pool touches against (17-19) decided the fifth and sixth places.\nPool D.\nA three-way tie for third place required a barrage, with two fencers advancing and the third eliminated. Cohen, who had beaten Muresan but lost to Mano in the main pool, won both of his barrage bouts to take third place. Mano defeated Muresan in the other barrage bout to revenge his loss in the main pool and take fourth, qualifying for the third round.\nPool E.\nThe fifth pool resulted in a four-way tie for third place, out of which two fencers would advance and two would be eliminated. The barrage resulted in two fencers going 2-1 to advance (with Jay's 20-21 edge in main-pool touches against giving him third place) and two going 1-2 (Parulski took fifth with 19 touches against in the main pool to Courtillat's 21) to be knocked out.\nPool F.\nSince the three-way tie for second didn't matter for qualification, it was broken by touches against. Magnan's 13 gave him second place, while Brecht and Kamuti were still tied at 17. They maintained their tie even through touches scored at 20, so both received third place in the pool.\nKnockout rounds.\nThe winner of each group advanced to the final pool, while the runner-up moved into a 5th-place semifinal."

        "text": "The Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball team represents Vanderbilt University in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Commodores have won three SEC regular-season titles (1965, 1974 and 1993) and two SEC Tournament championships (1951 and 2012). They have competed in 15 NCAA Tournaments, making it to the Elite Eight once (1965) and the Sweet Sixteen six times (1965, 1974, 1988, 1993, 2004, and 2007). Vanderbilt has played in 14 National Invitation Tournaments, winning it in 1990 and finishing runners-up in 1994.\nMemorial Gymnasium.\nThe Commodores play their home games in Memorial Gymnasium. Memorial Gymnasium was built in the early 1950s. It was dedicated as the campus memorial to students and alumni killed in World War II; a plaque commemorating those who died is displayed in the gym's north lobby.\nAt the time of the gym's construction, there was a serious discussion within the Vanderbilt community about whether the school should de-emphasize intercollegiate athletics and refocus on its academic program. As a compromise between those who advocated increased athletics competition and those who argued in favor of de-emphasis, the gymnasium was built to hold only about 9,000 seats, and it would be readily adaptable to other uses—significantly, as a possible concert hall.\nConsequently, the gymnasium floor was built up above its surroundings, more in the nature of a stage. The areas out of bounds along the sidelines were very wide, in contrast with the small facility which it replaced, where the walls were right along the sidelines and players could scrape their shoulders bringing the ball up the court. This necessitated the placement of the benches at the end of the court, which was not highly unusual at the time.\nIn addition, each goal was anchored by two far-reaching beams attached to support columns, with extra support coming from cables stretching all the way to the gym's ceiling. In the case of a backboard shatter or beam fracture, replacing these goals would be highly difficult, compared to the usual goal setup at most venues.\nMemorial Gym is well known for its unusual design. The end-of-the-floor bench location is now unique in major college basketball, and SEC coaches who travel to Memorial, along with coaches from other schools who have played at Vanderbilt as a post-season venue, have said that the unusual setup gives Vanderbilt a tremendous home court advantage, since no other facility in which opponents play is arranged in such a way.\nYear-by-year season records.\nNote: Fansonly.com reports Vanderbilt's overall record in 1937–38 as 9–12, while SECSports.com reports it as 10–11.\nSource: Soconsports.com\nSource: SECSports.com\nSource: Fansonly.com\nConference championships.\nVanderbilt has won 4 conference season championships, 3 conference tournament championships, and 1 division season championship. \nFirst college basketball game played.\nVanderbilt defeated Nashville YMCA in a score of 9-6, on 7 February 1893, in the first college basketball game played in history. Vanderbilt's start to college basketball occurred just two years after Dr. James Naismith originated the game of basketball at Springfield (Mass.)

The event was won by Grigory Kriss of the Soviet Union, the nation's first gold medal in the event after a bronze four years earlier. The Soviets also took bronze, with Guram Kostava finishing in third place. Between the two was silver medalist Bill Hoskyns of Great Britain; it was the second consecutive Games with a British silver medalist in the event. Italy's six-Games gold medal streak in the men's individual épée ended with the nation missing the podium entirely; Gianluigi Saccaro finished fourth after losing the bronze-medal barrage to Kostava.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nFour of the eight finalists from the 1960 Games returned, including all three medalists: gold medalist (and 1956 silver medalist) Giuseppe Delfino of Italy, silver medalist Allan Jay of Great Britain, bronze medalist Bruno Habārovs of the Soviet Union, and sixth-place finisher Yves Dreyfus of France. The field included the previous five World Champions: Bill Hoskyns of Great Britain (1958), Habārovs (1959), Jack Guittet of France (1961), István Kausz of Hungary (1962), and Roland Losert of Austria (1963, the reigning champion).\nMalaysia and South Korea each made their debut in the event. Belgium and the United States each appeared for the 13th time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition underwent a significant format change from prior Games. Rather than exclusively pool play, the format now featured a mix of pool play and single-elimination brackets. It was the first time, other than the odd \"extra final\" round in 1928, that bracket play was used in the event. The format began with two rounds of pool play that narrowed the field to 24 fencers, continued with three rounds of knockout brackets that reduced the competitors to 4, and finished with a final pool featuring those fencers. A ranking bracket was also used for the four quarterfinal losers, placing them 5th, 6th, and 7th (two fencers, with no 7th/8th match). Barrages were used to break ties where necessary for advancement out of pools. Pool round bouts were to 5 touches, with double-losses possible. Knockout round bouts were to 10 touches.\nResults.\nKnockout rounds.\nThe winner of each group advanced to the final pool, while the runner-up moved into a 5th-place semifinal."

        "title": "Ed Sweeney (baseball)",
        "text": "Edward Francis Sweeney (July 19, 1888 – July 4, 1947), often referred to as \"Big Ed Sweeney\", was an American professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the New York Highlanders / Yankees of the American League from 1908 to 1915 and the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League in 1919.\nBaseball career.\nEarly career.\nSweeney attended St. Ignatius College Prep in Chicago, Illinois, and played for their baseball team as a catcher. He also played baseball as a semi-professional. Sweeney made his professional baseball debut with the Columbia Gamecocks of the Class C South Atlantic League in 1905. He also played for Columbia during the 1906 season. The Atlanta Crackers of the Class A Southern Association drafted him from Columbia after the 1906 season. Playing for Atlanta in the 1907 season, Sweeney split time at catcher with Syd Smith.\nOne day in 1907, while warming up pitcher Russ Ford, a ball hit a concrete pillar, scuffing it. When Ford threw the ball again, it moved wildly. Ford began to experiment with this effect in secret, not telling Sweeney about it.\nMajor leagues.\nIn 1908, Sweeney made his major league debut for the New York Highlanders of the American League on May 16. At the age of 19, he was the fourth-youngest player in the American League that season. When Kid Elberfeld became the Highlander's manager during the season, he increased Sweeney's playing time. Sweeney had a .146 batting average in 32 games played for the Highlanders in the 1908 season. In 1909, Sweeney batted .267 in 67 games. He led all American League catchers with 20 errors committed.\nFord joined the Highlanders in 1910, and told Sweeney about how he had learned to throw the emery ball following the initial discovery in 1907. Ford taught Sweeney how to catch it and requested that the Highlanders have Sweeney serve as his personal batterymate. That year, Sweeney batted .200 in 78 games played.\nSweeney batted .231 in 83 games during the 1911 season. He missed the beginning of the 1912 season due to a contract dispute with the team. He still caught 110 games that year, and batted .268. Sweeney led all American League catchers with 114 caught stealings (114). He also led American League catchers with 34 errors. After the 1912 season, Dave Fultz formed a union for baseball players, called the Players Fraternity, with Sweeney, Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson, and Red Dooin serving as vice presidents. In 1913, Sweeney batted .265 in 117 games, and also hit his first two major league home runs. Sweeney again led the league in caught stealings that year, with 133, but also allowed the most stolen bases (205) and passed balls (19).\nBefore the 1914 season, Sweeney came to terms with the Buffalo Buffeds of the outlaw Federal League. Ban Johnson, the president of the American League, intervened in the negotiations. Claimed by both leagues, Sweeney signed with the Yankees for $9,000 ($ in current dollar terms), the largest salary for a catcher to date. Ford jumped to the Federal League before the 1914 season, and Sweeney taught the emery ball to Ray Keating, a spitball pitcher.\nOn September 12, 1914, Sweeney caught Keating during a game against the Philadelphia Athletics. Eddie Collins became suspicious after striking out, and asked Tom Connolly, the home plate umpire, to inspect the ball. Connolly saw that the ball was scuffed, and investigated Keating's glove, finding emery paper. Following the discovery, the emery ball was outlawed, punishable with a 30-day suspension and a $100 fine ($ in current dollar terms). Sweeney batted .213 with one home run in 87 games played in 1914.\nLater career.\nSweeney's playing time decreased in 1915; he played 53 games for the Yankees and batted .190. The Yankees demoted him to the Richmond Climbers of the Class AA International League in August. The Yankees did not bring Sweeney with them to spring training in 1916, and attempted to buy out the remainder of his contract before the 1916 season. They struggled to find a team that would acquire him, as his salary was tied for the 12th-highest in the league. Sweeney eventually signed with the Toledo Iron Men of the Class AA American Association. The Yankees sold Sweeney and Keating outright to Toledo before the 1917 season. With Toledo, Sweeney was reunited with Ford.\nFollowing the United States' entry into World War I, Sweeney enlisted in the United States Army after the 1917 season. Commissioned as a sergeant, he managed U.S. Army baseball teams in 1918, before serving on the front lines in France with the 161st Artillery Brigade. Sweeney returned to the United States in January 1919. The Yankees traded Sweeney to the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League for Gus Getz and Hooks Warner before the 1919 season. He had four hits in 42 at bats (.095 batting average) for the Pirates, before he was released in July.\nSweeney signed with the Seattle Rainiers of the Class AA Pacific Coast League for the remainder of the 1919 season. The Kansas City Blues of the American Association purchased Sweeney from Seattle before the 1920 season. He was released to the San Antonio Bears of the Class A Texas League after the season. Sweeney returned to Chicago and played semi-professional baseball in 1921, and he signed with the Racine, Wisconsin, franchise of the Midwest League, an independent baseball league, in 1923.\nPersonal life.\nSweeney was born in Chicago, Illinois, on July 19, 1888. His father was a battalion chief in the Chicago Fire Department and a contractor who built a garage for his sons, Ed and Gene, that they turned into a taxi business. Sweeney stood at and weighed approximately , giving him the nickname \"Big Ed Sweeney\".\nSweeney died in Chicago on July 4, 1947. He was buried at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois."

The event was won by American crew Edward Ferry, Conn Findlay, and coxswain Kent Mitchell. Findlay had been on the United States gold medal crew in 1956 and bronze medal crew in 1960; he was the first man to earn two gold medals in the event, as well as the first man to win three medals of any color in the event. Mitchell had also been on the 1960 crew, and was the seventh man to earn multiple medals in the coxed pair. Jacques Morel, Georges Morel, and cox Jean-Claude Darouy took silver to earn France's first medal in the event since 1952 (the last time a French team had competed). Herman Rouwé, Erik Hartsuiker, Jan Just Bos earned what was formally the Netherlands' first medal in the event; a pair of Dutch rowers had won the first edition in 1900, but had jettisoned their cox in favor of a local French boy between rounds and thus that medal was a \"mixed team\" medal.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nSix of the 18 competitors from the 1960 coxed pair final returned: Igor Rudakov, the coxswain from the silver medal Soviet Union team; Conn Findlay and Kent Mitchell, rower and coxswain from the bronze medal United States team (Findlay had also won gold in 1956); Jens Berendt Jensen and Knud Nielsen, rowers from the fourth-place Denmark team; and Gheorghe Riffelt, a rower from the sixth-place Romania team. The United Team of Germany sent an East German crew that had won the European championships instead of a West German crew that had won the inaugural World Championship. The American crew had won the 1963 Pan American Games.\nArgentina's crew included coxswain Oscar Rompani, at age 60 the oldest Olympic rower.\nNo nations made their debut in the event. France and the United States each made their ninth appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948). \nThis rowing competition consisted of two main rounds (semifinals and finals), as well as a repechage round that allowed teams that did not win their semifinal heats to advance to the main final. The competition introduced the \"B\" or \"consolation\" final, which ranked boats 7 through 12.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe top crew in each heat advanced to the final, with all others sent to the repechages.\nRepechage.\nThe top finisher in each of the three repechages joined the finalists. The second and third place finishers competed in a consolation final for 7th to 12th places. All other crews were eliminated.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe consolation final determined places from 7th to 12th."

The event was won by the United Team of Germany, the nation's second consecutive victory in the men's coxed four (though with an entirely new crew from 1960). The two medals placed the United Team of Germany in a tie for second-most all-time with Switzerland and Italy; Germany had the most with four. Italy earned its third straight medal in the event, all of different colours, with a silver in Tokyo (also with an entirely different crew in 1964 than 1960).

The event was won by the United States, returning the top of the podium after losing their eight-Games winning streak with a fifth-place finish in 1960; it was the nation's 11th overall victory in the men's eight. The defending champions, the United Team of Germany, took silver; the Germans defeated the United States in the opening round but lost the rematch in the final after the Americans advanced through the repechage.

        "text": "The Worcestershire County Cricket League (WCL) is an English club cricket league, and consists of club teams primarily from Worcestershire and Herefordshire, several other clubs from bordering counties Shropshire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire, and Wales.\nHistory.\nThe Worcestershire County Cricket League was created in 1999 as part of the new 'pyramid system' in English club cricket, and acts as a feeder league to the Birmingham and District Premier League. It was formed mainly as a merger between the old Worcestershire Clubs' League and the Autobag/Plumb Centre League. Other clubs came from the Midland Combined Counties League, the 3D Cricket PLJ League, and in the case of Herefordshire sides, the Marches Cricket League and the Willowsticks Three Counties Cricket League. For the 2023 season the WCL took over the administration of the Marches League (the only open age cricket league based in Herefordshire, which also included some clubs from Wales), thereby adding another 29 sides and 17 new clubs. \nThere is promotion and relegation and most divisions of the league operate on a two up/two down basis, although the feeder league status means that more than two sides may be relegated from the Premier Division, with knock-on effects on other divisions, if one or more Worcestershire (also Herefordshire in the past) side is relegated from Birmingham League Division 1. Other exceptions to this are in the Premier Division (where the winner is only promoted to the Birmingham and District Premier League if they finish in the top 2 out of the 4 feeder league champions, after a round-robin competition between the 4 sides at the end of the season).\nIn the two regionalised Division 7 leagues (North &amp; South) the winners go up to Division 6 and the two bottom placed teams in each division are relegated to the Division 8 regional leagues. In the five regionalised Division 8 leagues (North, South, East, West, &amp; Marches League Division 1) the winners of each of the five divisions and the three best-placed runners-up go into end of season playoffs, with the winners of the first round of playoffs going into Divisions 7 North &amp; South for the following season. \nWinners of Division 1/Premier Division of the Worcestershire County Cricket League, who have been promoted to the Birmingham and District Premier League, since 1999 are:\nWCL Division 1\nWCL Premier Division\nIn 2018 there was no promotion from any of the four county feeder leagues due to the restructuring of the Birmingham &amp; District Premier League.\nIn 2020 there was no promotion from any of the four county feeder leagues due to the shortened season resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFrom 2019 onwards the winners of the Worcestershire County League's new Premier Division went into a round-robin playoff at the end of the season with the winners of the Shropshire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire leagues, with the top two sides out of the four being promoted to the Birmingham &amp; District Premier League.\nDivisional structure.\nFrom 1999 until 2018 from Division 1 down to Division 4 there were separate 2nd XI Divisions, with the 4th XI of those sides whose 3rd XIs played in the league competing against other clubs' 2nd XIs. From 2006, Division 1 and 2 2nd XIs were promoted and relegated independently of their 1st XIs (and 4th XIs could be promoted or relegated independently of their 3rd XIs), from 2007 the same applied to Division 3, and from 2014 this also applied to Division 4. Clubs could only be promoted from Division 5 if they were able to field two XIs in the following season, and there was a space available in Division 4.\nAt the end of the 2018 season the league absorbed six 1st XIs that were relegated out of the Birmingham and District Premier League due to the league downsizing from 48 to 24 clubs, as well as 14 2nd XIs, due to the B&amp;DPCL no longer holding a 2nd XI competition from 2019 onwards. The 1st XIs to be relegated were Astwood Bank, Old Elizabethans, Old Hill, Pershore, Redditch and Stourbridge. The 2nd XIs that were absorbed by the WCL were Astwood Bank, Barnards Green, Barnt Green, Brockhampton, Bromsgrove, Halesowen, Himley, Kidderminster, Old Elizabethans, Old Hill, Ombersley, Pershore, Redditch, and Stourbridge.\nFor the 2019 season the league adopted a 'linear structure' so that 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th XIs would all be part of the same 'ladder system', and theoretically a 2nd, 3rd or 4th XI etc. would be able to be promoted as far as the new WCL Premier Division (one division below the Birmingham and District Premier League).\nFor the 2021 season several of the league's lower divisions were regionalised, so that the top 8 divisions (Premier to Division 7) remained county wide, but Divisions 8 and 9 were regionalised into North, South, East and West divisions. For the 2022 season a county wide Division 8 was added, with three regional divisions in Division 9 and four regional divisions in the new Division 10. This was adjusted again for 2023, with Divisions 7 &amp; 8 being regionalised into Division 7 North &amp; South, and Division 8 being split into four regional divisions of North, South, East &amp; West. At the bottom of the league, Division 9 has two divisions of North and South. \nFor the 2023 season the league took over the administration of the Marches Cricket League, with the winners (and potentially 2nd-placed team) in Marches League Division 1 being offered the chance to compete in the Division 8 playoffs. The rest of the Marches League Divisions will operate on a two-up, two down basis, apart from there being no relegation from Division 3. \nFor 2024 the Worcestershire County Cricket League will be made up of the following divisions and clubs:\nClubs from different counties.\nFor the 2024 season, 80 different clubs will have sides in the league (194 sides in total across the 18 divisions). \nFamous players.\n86 First-Class and List A cricketers have played in the Worcestershire County Cricket League, including 18 internationals:\nInternationals, and club represented.\nEngland\nNew Zealand\nWest Indies\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\nZimbabwe\nScotland \nOther First Class and List A players, and club(s) represented.\nEngland\nAustralia\nSouth Africa\nWest Indies\nNew Zealand\nIndia\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\nZimbabwe\nNamibia"

        "text": "Matthew Clayton Flynn (born June 20, 1985) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the LSU Tigers and was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the seventh round of the 2008 NFL draft. Flynn was a member of the Packers when they won Super Bowl XLV over the Pittsburgh Steelers. He also played for the Seattle Seahawks, Oakland Raiders, Buffalo Bills, New England Patriots, New York Jets, and New Orleans Saints.\nEarly life and family.\nMatthew Flynn, born and raised in Tyler, Texas, is the son of Alvin and Ruth Flynn. Matthew Flynn's father, a civil attorney, was a quarterback at Baylor in the 1960s, and his mother is a former collegiate dance team director and choreographer at Kilgore College and Tyler Junior College. Matt has two brothers, Adam and Bill, and two sisters, Rebecca and Amanda.\nHigh school career.\nMatthew Flynn attended Robert E. Lee High School where he was coached by Mike Owens, and was teammates with Justin Warren, Brandon Pettigrew, and Ciron Black. As a junior in 2001, Matthew Flynn completed 101 of 199 passes for 1,650 yards, 13 touchdowns and 9 interceptions for the season, leading Lee to the 5A-I playoffs, where they lost in the second round to eventual state champion Mesquite High School. As a senior, he completed 124 of 206 passes for 1,679 yards and 9 touchdowns, and had 305 yards rushing with 12 touchdowns. Matthew Flynn displayed toughness by leading Robert E. Lee High School to a semifinal appearance despite playing his last four games with a broken foot. His team lost to Midland High School 24–14.\nAfter his senior season, 247 Sports listed Matthew Flynn as the top-rated Texas high school quarterback in 2003. Matthew Flynn was a member of the SuperPrep Texas 124, the \"Dallas Morning News\" Texas Top 100 and the \"Tyler Morning Telegraph\" All-East Texas Football Team. He chose LSU over Tennessee, Texas Tech, and Texas A&amp;M.\nCollege career.\n2003–2006.\nFlynn redshirted the 2003 season at LSU. In 2004, he served as third-string quarterback behind starter Marcus Randall and backup JaMarcus Russell. He also doubled as LSU's holder on placekicks. Flynn played in all 12 games, but only three games as quarterback. His collegiate first completion went to Xavier Carter for a 67-yard touchdown against Mississippi State. Flynn also made a short appearance in the 2004 Capital One Bowl, completing 1 of 4 passes for 11 yards in a 25–30 losing effort against Iowa. He finished the season with 4 completions on 10 attempts for 99 yards and 1 touchdown.\nThe departure of Randall left Russell and Flynn battling for the starting quarterback position in the 2005 season. Russell eventually got the job, leaving Flynn as backup. He played in seven games at quarterback for the Tigers in 2005, completing 27 of 48 passes for 457 yards, 7 touchdowns and 1 interception. In a win over North Texas, Flynn threw a perfect 7-of-7 for 139 yards and 3 touchdowns, all in the fourth quarter. In the 2005 SEC Championship Game against the Georgia Bulldogs, starting quarterback Russell was injured and Flynn finished the game. He was then given the nod to start for the Tigers in the 2005 Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl against the University of Miami Hurricanes. In that game, he led the Tigers to a 40–3 rout of Miami.\nIn 2006, Flynn again served as backup to Russell, appearing in seven games. He completed 12 of 20 passes for 133 yards over the season, recording 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Both touchdowns came in a 49–0 rout against Kentucky on October 14, 2006.\n2007: BCS National Championship season.\nWith JaMarcus Russell's departure, Flynn became a starter as a fifth-year senior. He started every game that season except the SEC Championship in which he was injured. He finished the season with 2,407 passing yards, 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. In addition, he rushed for 215 yards and 4 touchdowns.\nFlynn threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Demetrius Byrd to win the game against Auburn on October 20, 2007, with 1 second remaining on the clock; Colt David kicked the extra point to make the final score LSU 30, Auburn 24.\nHe then led the Tigers to a 4th quarter comeback against Alabama. Flynn and the Tigers then beat Louisiana Tech the following weekend and climb back to the #1 spot after a loss by then-#1 Ohio State. The following week the Tigers beat Ole Miss. In his final game at Tiger Stadium, Flynn and the Tigers lost to Arkansas, seemingly losing any chance at the national title. However, LSU, without Flynn, beat Tennessee for the SEC Championship, and losses by Missouri and West Virginia vaulted LSU back into the title game in New Orleans.\nOn January 7, 2008, Flynn led LSU to a BCS National Championship, beating Ohio State 38–24. Flynn completed 19 of 27 passes and 4 touchdowns, and was named offensive MVP of the game. The Tigers finished the season ranked No. 1 in the polls.\nProfessional career.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nFlynn was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the seventh round (209th overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft. On July 23, he was signed to a four-year rookie contract through the 2011 season. In 2008, Flynn won the competition for the back-up role to Aaron Rodgers, beating out fellow rookie and second-round pick Brian Brohm. Flynn was seen as being less talented than Brohm because of Brohm's superior size, arm and foot speed, coupled with the fact that Brohm was selected much higher in the draft compared to Flynn.\nOn December 19, 2010, Flynn made his first NFL start, against the New England Patriots, after starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers was not cleared medically to start. Flynn threw three touchdown passes; one each to John Kuhn, James Jones and Greg Jennings against New England, but threw an interception that was returned by Kyle Arrington for a touchdown in the second half. The game went down to the final play when Flynn, with the ball at the New England 15-yard line, lost it when he was sacked. The Packers lost the game 31–27. Flynn completed 23 of 37 passes for 254 yards in the loss.\nFlynn was the backup to Rodgers when the Packers won Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011.\nOn January 1, 2012, Flynn started the final game of the season, against the Detroit Lions. He threw for 480 yards and six touchdowns in the 45–41 victory, both of which set single game Packers records.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nOn March 18, 2012, Flynn signed a three-year deal with the Seattle Seahawks worth $20.5 million, with $9 million guaranteed. He decided to wear the number 15, his number from college. Flynn competed with 2011 starting quarterback Tarvaris Jackson and 2012 NFL draft third round pick Russell Wilson for the starting quarterback position. When Wilson was named the starter, it made Flynn and his contract expendable.\nOakland Raiders.\nOn April 2, 2013, the Seahawks traded Flynn to the Oakland Raiders for a 2014 fifth round pick and a conditional 2015 draft pick. He was brought in to compete with 2013 NFL draft fourth round pick Tyler Wilson and 2011 NFL draft supplemental third round pick Terrelle Pryor for the starting quarterback position, with Pryor winning the starting job in preseason.\nHe was assigned number 15. Flynn relieved an injured Pryor in a Week 3 match-up against the Broncos, completing 1 of 2 passes for 19 yards in a 37–21 loss. With Pryor's concussion preventing him from starting the next week against the Redskins, Flynn started and completed 21 out of 32 passes for 227 yards with one touchdown pass and one interception (which was returned for a Redskins touchdown) in a 24–14 loss. Several days later, Raiders coach Dennis Allen announced Flynn's demotion to third-string behind Pryor and undrafted rookie Matt McGloin.\nOn October 7, 2013, the Raiders released Flynn just six months after bringing him in to be the starter.\nBuffalo Bills.\nOn October 14, 2013, Flynn worked out with the Buffalo Bills with rookie and starting quarterback EJ Manuel out 6–8 weeks with a knee injury, and backup Thad Lewis injured during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals. He signed with the Bills on October 14, 2013. He was assigned number 17. Flynn did not see any playing time in Buffalo and primarily served as an emergency replacement should third-string quarterback Jeff Tuel also be hurt. After Lewis and Manuel recovered from their injuries, Flynn was released on November 4, 2013.\nGreen Bay Packers (second stint).\nOn November 12, 2013, due to injuries to starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers and backup quarterback Seneca Wallace, Flynn was re-signed by Green Bay to be the backup for Scott Tolzien.\nOn November 24, 2013, Flynn was brought in to relieve the struggling Tolzien midway through the 3rd quarter. Flynn rallied the team from a 23–7 deficit at the beginning of the 4th quarter. The game went to overtime with a 23–23 score. The Packers struck first in overtime with a field goal, but due to the NFL's new regular season overtime rules, the Vikings got the ball back and also scored a field goal. The game ended in a 26–26 tie.\nOn November 27, 2013, it was announced that Flynn would be the starting quarterback for the Thanksgiving game against the Detroit Lions. Flynn struggled, only completing 10 of 20 attempts for 139 yards with one interception and two fumbles. He was sacked 7 times, including one in the end zone for a safety. The Packers lost 40–10.\nOn December 15, 2013, Flynn led the Packers from a 26–3 deficit against the Cowboys at halftime to come out with a 37–36 victory. He led five consecutive touchdown drives in the 2nd half, and threw for 299 yards with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception.\nOn December 22, 2013, Flynn threw for 232 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception in a 38–31 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nHis contract expired at the end of the season. On April 15, 2014, Flynn was given a new 1-year deal with the team worth $1.07 million. During his final season with the Green Bay Packers, Flynn appeared in four games, and finished the season with 66 yards, no touchdowns and one interception. Flynn was not re-signed and became a free agent on March 8, 2015.\nNew England Patriots.\nFlynn was signed by the New England Patriots on June 11, 2015. Flynn would add a veteran presence for second-year quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo for four games due to the suspension of Tom Brady. He was assigned number 8. On August 10, 2015, the Patriots released Flynn to make room for Ryan Lindley.\nNew York Jets.\nFlynn was signed by the New York Jets on August 19, 2015, to a one-year contract. He was assigned number 5. On September 3, 2015, Flynn started the Jets' preseason week 4 match-up against the Philadelphia Eagles, throwing 10–14 for 136 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception. On September 5, 2015, Flynn was released.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn November 15, 2015, Flynn was signed by the New Orleans Saints after back-up quarterback Luke McCown suffered a season-ending injury. The 2015 season marked the first in Flynn's career in which he did not appear in a regular season game.\nPersonal life.\nFlynn married his long-time girlfriend Lacey Minchew on June 22, 2013."

        "title": "Mike Mercer (basketball)",
        "text": "Michael Anthony Mercer Jr. (born September 29, 1986) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the University of Georgia and the University of South Florida.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Anaheim, California, Mercer grew up in Snellville, Georgia, where he was a teammate of former NBA player Lou Williams at South Gwinnett High School and with the AAU's Georgia Stars. As a junior at South Gwinnett in 2003–04, he averaged 18.1 points per game and helped the school go 31–2 and win the AAAAA championship.\nAs a senior in 2004–05, Mercer averaged 19.8 points, 8.1 assists and 6.0 rebounds per game, helping South Gwinnett to a 28–3 record and the quarterfinals of the Georgia Class 5A state tournament.\nCollege career.\nGeorgia.\nAs a freshman at Georgia in 2005–06, Mercer averaged 11 points and three rebounds per game and was named to the Coaches' SEC All-Freshman team. He had 17 double-digit scoring games, captured one Freshman-of-the-Week award, and ranked eighth in the SEC in steals at 1.71 per game.\nAs a sophomore in 2006–07, Mercer started all 23 games for Georgia before suffering a right ACL injury that forced him to miss the final 10 games of the season. He was the second leading scorer on the team at 13.6 points per game. Prior to his injury, Mercer was leading the team in scoring and minutes played and was ranked 18th in the SEC in scoring, 14th in assists (3.6), eighth in steals (1.70) and 13th in assist/turnover ratio (1.43). He earned SEC Player of the Week honors once and came within two rebounds against Jacksonville of becoming first Bulldogs player in history to achieve a triple-double.\nOn March 15, 2007, Mercer underwent reconstructive knee surgery to repair the torn ligament.\nOn October 11, 2007, Mercer was suspended by the University of Georgia for violating the school's new class attendance policy for student-athletes. His suspension cost him the first 15 games of the 2007–08 season. Mercer was later dismissed from the program on November 19, 2007 for \"being a disruption,\" said Georgia coach Dennis Felton at the time.\nSouth Florida.\nOn November 27, 2007, Mercer transferred to South Florida and subsequently redshirted the 2007–08 season due to NCAA transfer regulations.\nMercer became eligible to play for South Florida in December 2008, making his debut for the Bulls on December 14 against Niagara. He competed in four games, starting two, before suffering a season-ending knee injury on December 21 against Wright State.\nWhile out injured, Mercer again ran into trouble. On January 23, 2009, he was arrested for the second time in four months: the first being in September 2008 for public consumption of alcohol, and the second being for marijuana possession. Arrested with him was teammate Anthony Crater, who were both charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Both were suspended from the team indefinitely.\nIt seemed his career, at Georgia and USF, would be remembered for injuries and dismissals, and for the disappointment of missed opportunities. But coach Stan Heath kept Mercer on scholarship, hoping he would stick around and earn his degree, and after Mercer graduated in August 2009 and fulfilled the legal requirements of a pretrial intervention program to get a misdemeanor drug charge dropped, Heath took a chance by allowing Mercer back on the team for the 2009–10 season. Heath's decision paid dividends, as Mercer became a key part of the Bulls' emergence in 2009–10. In February 2010, Mercer expressed how grateful he was to be part of a team making a run at the NCAA Tournament: \"Coming back has been a blessing. I'm grateful that Coach Heath and the coaching staff gave me another chance, and that's why I play my heart out every game. When you have a coach that's willing to go out on a limb for you, it makes you want to work that much harder for them.\"\nIn 2009–10, Mercer played in all 33 games for the Bulls, starting 30 of them. He ranked fifth on the team with 9.2 points per game while also adding 4.5 rebounds in 28.6 minutes per contest. He also finished third on the team with 48 assists and second with 44 steals. On January 5, 2010, he had his first career double-double with 10 points and a career-high 10 rebounds against Notre Dame. During the season, he had two 19-point games, a season high.\nAfter earning a degree in criminology, Mercer began working on a second degree in communications.\nProfessional career.\nIn November 2010, Mercer joined the Halifax Rainmen as a non-contracted training camp invite. He helped the team go 3–1 over four preseason games between December 10 and 19, and made his regular season debut for the club in the season opener on January 2, 2011, scoring 14 points in a 109–99 win over the Vermont Frost Heaves. Mercer left the team on February 15 because of undisclosed family reasons. Team Owner Andre Levingston said Mercer returned to Atlanta to be with his wife and young child. His departure left a gaping hole at the Rainmen's two spot, where Mercer averaged 14.5 points per game, second on the team and 15th in the Premier Basketball League.\nIn November 2011, Mercer moved to Weißenhorn, Germany to play for BG Illertal of the German ProB. In 15 games for the club throughout the 2011–12 season, he averaged 16.5 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.7 steals per game.\nIn December 2012, Mercer signed with the Geelong Supercats for the 2013 SEABL season. Mercer had a standout year with Geelong, finishing top ten in the league in points scored, assists and steals. In 29 games for the club in 2013, he averaged 20.1 points, 5.0 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. He subsequently earned All-SEABL Team honors.\nIn October 2013, Mercer trialled with the Wollongong Hawks of the National Basketball League, but was ultimately unsuccessful in garnering a contract.\nMercer returned to the Geelong Supercats for the 2014 SEABL season, but a mid-season right Achilles tendon injury ended his campaign after just 15 games. He helped the Supercats go 14–1 with averages of 20.1 points, 4.6 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game."

        "text": "In basketball, a field goal is a basket scored on any shot or tap other than a free throw, worth two or three points depending on the location of the attempt on the basket. Uncommonly, a field goal can be worth other values such as one point in FIBA 3x3 basketball competitions or four points in the BIG3 basketball league. \"Field goal\" is the official terminology used by the National Basketball Association (NBA) in their rule book, in their box scores and statistics, and in referees' rulings. The same term is also the official wording used by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and high school basketball.\nOne type of field goal is called a slam dunk. This occurs when a player jumps near the basket with possession of the ball, throwing the ball down through the basket while airborne.\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar holds the NBA record for field goals made in a career with 15,837. Wilt Chamberlain, one of the most prolific scorers of all time, holds the top four spots for most field goals made in a season and has the second-highest field goal percentage for a season (72.7%). The highest field goal percentage for a single season was set by New York Knicks center Mitchell Robinson with 74.2% in the abbreviated 2019–20 season. One of the greatest field-goal shooters of all time is Michael Jordan, who led the NBA in field goals made ten times. Shaquille O'Neal has the record for most seasons (10) with the best field goal percentage, and Artis Gilmore has the record for highest career field goal percentage (59.9%). Steve Nash holds the record for 50–40–90 seasons, a mark of all-around shooting for two-point field goals, three-point field goals, and free throws. Nash recorded four of the eleven 50–40–90 seasons in NBA history. Baron Davis holds the NBA record for the longest successful field goal with an 89-foot shot on February 17, 2001.\nDiana Taurasi has the record for the greatest number of field goals in a WNBA season.

        "text": "Matthew Thomas Ryan (born May 17, 1985) is an American former football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 15 seasons, primarily with the Atlanta Falcons. Nicknamed \"Matty Ice\", Ryan spent his first 14 seasons with the Falcons and holds the franchise records for passing yards, passing touchdowns, attempts, completions, passer rating, and wins. He played college football for the Boston College Eagles, winning the Manning and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Awards as a senior. He was selected by the Falcons with the third overall pick of the 2008 NFL draft. He is currently an analyst for CBS Sports.\nRyan immediately made an impact by taking the Falcons to the playoffs in his first season, earning him Offensive Rookie of the Year. During his Atlanta tenure, he led the team to six playoff appearances, three of which were division titles, and received four Pro Bowl selections. His most successful season was in 2016 when he was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) and led the Falcons to an appearance in Super Bowl LI. Ryan was traded to the Indianapolis Colts in 2022, where he spent one season. As a result of his time with the Falcons, he is often regarded by many fans and media as one of if not the greatest player in team history.\nEarly life and high school.\nRyan went to William Penn Charter School in Philadelphia where he was a three-year starter and earned All-East honors from Larunt Lemming Prep Football Report. He captured All-Southeastern Pennsylvania accolades as a senior quarterback in addition to receiving All-City first-team honors in 2002 and second-team recognition in 2001. A three-time All-League selection, he threw for more than 2000 yards with 19 touchdowns as a senior, finishing his career by completing more than 52 percent of his pass attempts during all three seasons at the helm. Ryan played football, basketball and baseball while in high school and was named captain of all three teams his senior year. He was quarterback of the football team in 2002, played small forward on the basketball team, and was a pitcher and shortstop on the baseball team.\nRyan says he was \"mildly\" recruited and began receiving scholarship offers as a sophomore. Some of the schools that offered him an athletic scholarship were Purdue, Georgia Tech, Temple, and Connecticut. After visiting Boston College during his junior year, he gave them his verbal commitment on August 14, 2002. His choices had come down to Iowa or Boston College. Ryan was looking for a university close to home and one that had a strong and competitive football program with a major emphasis on academics.\nCollege career.\n2003–2004.\nRyan began attending Boston College in 2003 and redshirted his first year with the team. Before the 2004 season, he was named the starting quarterback for Boston College due to an injury to Quinton Porter. He made his collegiate debut on October 2, 2004, against the UMass Minutemen and completed two of three passes for 16 yards in the 29–7 victory. He would not complete his first touchdown until November 20, 2004, against Temple, after throwing a 32-yard touchdown pass to Larry Lester. Replacing the injured Paul Peterson, he completed 9-of-15 passes for 121 yards in the 34–17 victory. He made his first collegiate start on November 27, 2004, in the final game of that season, completing 24 of 51 passes for 200 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions in a 43–17 loss against Syracuse. He also played against North Carolina in the Continental Tire Bowl. He completed one of his two passes for 13 yards in the 37–24 victory. Ryan also received the 2004 Freshman Male Scholar-Athlete award in the same year.\n2005 season.\nAt the beginning of the 2005 season, Ryan was named the second-string quarterback behind Quinton Porter. Porter had some success at the beginning of the year, including winning Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Week for his performance in Boston College's 28–17 win over Virginia. After a 30–10 loss to third-ranked Virginia Tech, coach Tom O'Brien finally went to Ryan for good in the fourth quarter of the next game against North Carolina State. In ten games, of which he started five, he completed 121 of 195 passes for 1,514 yards. He had eight touchdowns and five interceptions. He also rushed for five touchdowns and 94 yards. He started his first bowl game in the MPC Computers Bowl versus Boise State. He completed 19 of 36 passes for 256 yards and a career-best three touchdowns in the 27–21 victory to help Boston College finish with a #18 ranking in the final AP Poll.\n2006 season.\nRyan started 11 of the 12 games.

In Week 9 against the New Orleans Saints, Ryan had 343 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and one rushing touchdown in the 27–25 victory. Ryan was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. The Falcons offense would be anemic in the next two games, as they were held to a field goal against the Dallas Cowboys and then were shut out by the New England Patriots, with Ryan held to less than 200 yards in both games. The Falcons alternated wins and losses going into Week 17.\nDuring the Week 17 game against the Buffalo Bills, Ryan was called for a taunting penalty after seemingly scoring a rushing touchdown, but after further review, he was ruled down at the 1-yard line, and the resulting 15-yard penalty put Atlanta back at the 16-yard-line instead of being enforced on the ensuing kickoff. The Falcons failed to score from that distance on the next two plays, all but sealing a 29–15 loss that eliminated the team from the playoffs. Ryan finished the 2021 season with 3,968 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nOn March 21, 2022, the Falcons traded Ryan to the Indianapolis Colts for a third-round pick in the 2022 NFL draft.\n2022 season.\nIn his first game with the Colts in Week 1 against the Houston Texans, Ryan finished with 352 passing yards, a touchdown, and an interception as the game ended in a 20–20 tie.

In the game, he passed Dan Marino for seventh all-time in passing yards. Following a Week 7 loss to the Tennessee Titans, head coach Frank Reich announced Ryan had a shoulder injury and Sam Ehlinger would be the Colts' starting quarterback for the remainder of the 2022 season. However two weeks later, Reich was fired and interim coach Jeff Saturday announced Ryan would return as the team's starter. In a 25–20 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, Ryan threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Parris Campbell with five minutes remaining, on a drive which included a career-best 39-yard run by Ryan to convert a third down. In a game against the Minnesota Vikings, Ryan and the Colts jumped to a 33–0 lead at halftime before having a historic collapse, allowing the Vikings to make the largest comeback in NFL history and win 39–36 in overtime. Ryan finished with 182 yards and a touchdown in the game.

In 2018, Sarah announced the birth of their twin boys. Ryan and his wife quietly welcomed their third son Cal Patrick Ryan in April 1, 2023.\nOn January 9, 2019, Ryan made a cameo appearance on the series premiere of ABC's \"Schooled\", and his high school athletic career is also explored in the series.\nIn June 2020, Ryan donated $500,000 to a GoFundMe that he started to help advance the lives of people in the black community of Atlanta.\nOn May 15, 2023, Ryan was hired by CBS as a football analyst.

        "text": "Steven John Patterson (June 24, 1948 – July 28, 2004) was an American professional basketball player and coach who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for five seasons. A 6'9\" center for UCLA, Patterson spent his first year of athletic eligibility (1968-69, the third of the Bruins' unprecedented string of seven consecutive national titles) as the backup to Lew Alcindor, later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He then was the starting center for the Bruins' 1970 and 1971 championship teams under legendary coach John Wooden.\nEarly life.\nPatterson played basketball at Santa Maria High School in Santa Maria, California. In is senior season, he averaged 34 points per game and was named All–American and was California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section Player of the Year as he led his team to the CIF championship.\nCollege career.\nPatterson was UCLA's starting center in the seasons between Alcindor and Bill Walton, and part of the Bruins' string of seven consecutive NCAA titles.\nPatterson averaged 21.9 points and 20.2 rebounds per game on the Bruins' freshman team in 1966–67, then redshirted in 1967–68.\nHe served as a backup on the 1968—69 team. He was eighth on the team in scoring with 5.0 points per game and fifth in rebounding with 3.8 per game. He also scored four points in the 1969 NCAA Championship victory over Purdue.\nIn 1969–70 he was joined in the starting lineup by four other future NBA players, forwards Sidney Wicks and Curtis Rowe and guards Henry Bibby and John Vallely. For the season he averaged 12.5 points and 10.0 rebounds per game, with a field goal percentage of .496 and free throw percentage of .741. He scored 17 points as UCLA defeated Jacksonville University 80–69 in the 1970 NCAA championship game. After the season, UCLA honored him with the J.D. Morgan Memorial Award presented by the Bruin Hoopsters for the outstanding \"team player.\"\nIn 1971, he helped lead the Bruins to another national title with the same starting lineup, except for Kenny Booker replacing the graduated Vallely, as Patterson averaged 12.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. Patterson saved his best for the final game of his college career with a personal–best 29 points in a 68–62 win over Villanova in the 1971 NCAA championship game.\nDuring Patterson's two seasons as a starter, the UCLA Bruins were a combined 57–3, and had a total record of 84–4 in his three varsity seasons.\nAt UCLA, Patterson was an active member of Campus Crusade for Christ. Patterson also started a ministry on campus, the Jesus Christ Light and Power House, which housed and served Christians and students of all faiths and persuasions.\nProfessional career.\nPatterson was eligible for the professional basketball drafts after his second varsity season due to his earlier redshirt season. He passed up a chance to play for the Phoenix Suns, who selected him in the 1970 NBA draft, and the Texas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association, who chose him in the 1970 ABA Draft. Patterson re-entered the 1971 NBA draft and was the first selection of the second round by the expansion Cleveland Cavaliers, and he signed with the Cavaliers.\nPatterson showed ability as an inside defender and rebounder, but also battled knee problems and never reached his potential as an NBA player. He played five years in Cleveland, mostly as a backup.\nHowever, he had his most productive year as primarily a starter in his third season, 1973–74, when he played over 25 minutes per game and averaged 7.8 points, 8.1 rebounds and 2.2 assists, all career highs. That season he also set a personal-best of 22 points in a game, on February 16, 1974, in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers. It was one of three 20-plus games that season for Patterson. In the following season, he topped his career single-game point production with 23 on January 19, 1975, in a loss to the Detroit Pistons.\nDuring the 1975-76 season—his fifth and final NBA season—after playing 14 games for the Cavaliers, on November 27, 1975, he was traded along with Eric Fernsten to the Chicago Bulls for Nate Thurmond and Rowland Garrett. He played in 52 games for the Bulls, and the following year was released prior to the season's start. After the NBA, he played one year professionally in Italy.\nPost-playing career.\nPatterson then went into coaching, becoming the men's head basketball coach at Santa Rosa Junior College from 1983 to 1985. He then became head coach at Arizona State from 1985 through 1989, coaching the Sun Devils to a 48–56 record. He was also the chairman of Phoenix's organizing committee for Super Bowl XXX (1996) and commissioner of the Continental Basketball Association in 1997.\nPersonal life.\nPatterson spent the last years of his life organizing youth and community sports programs in Arizona, including as founder of the Grand Canyon State Games. He and his wife, Carlette, ran Patterson Sports Ventures, which specialized in marketing for professional athletes, sports philanthropy and sports ministries. He was a gourmet cook, a history buff and a wine connoisseur.\nPatterson died of lung cancer at home on July 28, 2004, at age 56. He was survived by his wife of seven years, Carlette, their daughter, Makena, her daughters Amanda and Sara, and Steve's sons from his first marriage John and Brent. A lifelong Christian, Patterson made faith the core of his post-NBA activities and he is remembered at TheGoal.com. The Goal had been his central organization to church-sports activities.\nHonors.\nIn 2005, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation established the Steve Patterson Award for Excellence in Sports Philanthropy, because he believed in and practiced the use of the power of sports philanthropy to make a difference."

        "text": "George Chambley (April 10, 1866 – September 6, 1947) was an American scholar and educator who played a crucial role in the development of Auburn University. From 1887 until his retirement in 1942, Petrie held various positions at Auburn, including professor of history and Latin, head of the History Department, and dean of the Graduate School. Petrie also organized and coached Auburn's first football team in 1892.\nPetrie is the first Alabamian to earn a Ph.D. degree. He received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Virginia in 1887 and a Ph.D. in \"history, political economy, and jurisprudence\" from Johns Hopkins University in 1890. At Auburn, known until 1892 as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, and from 1892 to 1960 as Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Petrie is considered the founder of both the History Department and the Graduate School, as well as the school's athletic program.\nFootball coach.\nHis time at the University of Virginia inspired Petrie to choose burnt orange and navy blue as the official colors for Auburn's athletic teams. Upon organizing the first Auburn football team in 1892, Petrie arranged for the team to play the University of Georgia team at Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia. Auburn won the game, 10–0, in front of 2,000 spectators. The game inaugurated what is known to college football fans as the Deep South's Oldest Rivalry.\nAuburn Creed.\nPetrie is perhaps best known to Auburn alumni as the author of the Auburn Creed:\nThe creed has been a well known symbol of the university ever since Petrie wrote it in 1943."

        "text": "The 1997 UEFA Champions League final was a football match played at the Olympiastadion in Munich on 28 May 1997 to determine the winner of the 1996–97 UEFA Champions League. The match was contested by Borussia Dortmund of Germany and Juventus of Italy. Borussia Dortmund won 3–1 with goals from Karl-Heinz Riedle and Lars Ricken; Juventus' goal was scored by Alessandro Del Piero.\nRoute to the final.\nIn their first semi-final in Europe's premier tournament since 1964, Dortmund defeated Manchester United, who themselves had not reached that stage since 1969.\nIn the other half of the draw, Juventus easily overcame Ajax, the same team they had beaten on penalties in the previous year's final.\nPrevious meetings.\nThe match featured the same teams that competed in the 1993 UEFA Cup Final, in which Juventus prevailed 6–1 over two legs. Their two German players in that final, Jürgen Kohler and Andreas Möller, had since moved to Dortmund along with the Brazilian Júlio César (who did not feature in the 1997 final), while another two Dortmund players who did play in Munich – Stefan Reuter and Paulo Sousa – were also former Juventus players, and Matthias Sammer and Karl-Heinz Riedle had previously played in Italy's Serie A (the latter's replacement at Lazio was Alen Bokšić, who by 1997 had moved to Juventus).\nGoalkeepers Angelo Peruzzi and his understudy Michelangelo Rampulla were the only Juventus players from 1993 in the squad for the 1997 final (Moreno Torricelli and Antonio Conte were still at the club but were not involved), with the aforementioned Kohler and Möller having switched sides. In the Dortmund squad their goalkeeper Stefan Klos, striker Stéphane Chapuisat and midfielders René Tretschok, Reuter and club captain Michael Zorc remained from four years earlier.\nBesides the 1993 showpiece, the clubs had also met in the semi-finals of the 1994–95 UEFA Cup with Juventus progressing to the final which they lost to Parma, and in the group stage of the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League, with each club winning away from home, however Juventus topped the group and went on to win the trophy.\nIn the years to follow, Juventus and Borussia Dortmund would not meet again until 2014–15 Champions League round of 16 – the Italian club went through, meaning they won all four fixtures (1993, 1995 UEFA Cup, 1995 and 2015 Champions League) at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion, with their only defeat on German soil was in this final. Juventus reached that season's final; coincidentally that match was again held at an Olympiastadion in Germany, but this time in Berlin, and the outcome was another 3–1 loss, to Barcelona.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nKarl-Heinz Riedle put Dortmund ahead finishing from inside the six yard box after Paul Lambert's cross. Riedle then made it two with a header from a corner kick from the right.\nIn the second half, Juventus forward Alessandro Del Piero, who had come on as a substitute, scored via a back-heel from a cross by Alen Bokšić to make the score 2–1.\n20-year-old substitute and Dortmund local boy Lars Ricken latched on to a through-pass by Andreas Möller only 16 seconds after coming onto the pitch. Ricken chipped Angelo Peruzzi in the Juve goal from over 20 yards with his first touch of the ball, to make it 3–1 for Dortmund. Ricken's goal was the fastest ever by a substitute in said event.\nWith Zinedine Zidane unable to make an impression for Juve against the close marking of Lambert, the 3–1 victory gave Dortmund their only Champions League title to date."

Carter was tied at 6–6 when he spent the mid-session interval in his dressing room discussing tactics with his coach Terry Griffiths. Carter was deemed to have returned to the table late by the referee Olivier Marteel and Bingham was awarded frame 13. Walden began his match against the 2001 tournament winner Ronnie O'Sullivan with breaks of 80 and 67 before O'Sullivan tied at 2–2 and both players concluded the first session 4–4. O'Sullivan led 7–4 but breaks of 102, 93, 85 and 79 put Walden into the lead before O'Sullivan forced a final frame decider, which he took with a 23rd season century break of 108 to win 9–8.\nTied at 4–4 after his opening session Davis beat Burnett 9–5, while Hull was a surprise winner over Robertson winning five consecutive frames to claim a 9–4 victory. Shaun Murphy, the 2005 world champion, fell 6–2 behind McManus at the interval and could not recover as McManus won 9–3. Mark Williams, a two-time world champion, progressed to round three by beating Greene 9–7. Another world champion, John Higgins, emulated Gray's 146 clearance in a 9–4 victory over King, and Stephen Lee defeated Lawler 9–6. Breaks of 107, 86, 82 and 66 enabled Stephen Maguire to overcome Swail 9–8 in the second session. Five-time UK champion Stephen Hendry led Harold 7–3 before the latter won four successive frames with two century breaks of 115 and 111 to equal the score at 7–7. Hendry's match-high breaks of 88 and 82 in the 14th and 15th frames earned him a 9–7 victory.\nGraeme Dott, the world champion, won the first six frames of his match against fellow Scot MacKenzie within one hour, compiling century breaks of 100, 107 and 112 to win 9–2. Ding, fatigued from having arrived in the United Kingdom on 8 December after winning three gold medals at the 2006 Qatar Asian Games, beat Day 9–7 in a tightly contested match. Tied at 4–4, both players exchanged frames with four in a row decided on the . Day missed a difficult shot into the from his position and Ding made a game-winning clearance of 57 to win. Fourth seed Ken Doherty held a 7–1 advantage over his opponent Dunn and claimed frames nine and ten with breaks of 87 and 58 in 22 minutes to win 9–1 and progression to the third round.\nRound three.\nThe third round was held from 11 to 12 December. Breaks of 128, 121 and 105 enabled Higgins to lead Lee 7–1 in a match delayed by 20 minutes to enable players and officials to watch Paul Hunter's widow Lyndsey receive the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Helen Rollason Award on his behalf. Higgins made another century break in the second session to beat Lee 9–2. Ebdon moved 6–2 ahead of Bingham despite missing the penultimate when it appeared he would achieve a maximum break but he won 9–4. O'Sullivan constructed a 5–3 lead over Maguire and used several mistakes from his opponent in the second session to win 9–3. Doherty lead Perry 5–1, but the latter responded in the second session to claim six of the next seven frames to win 9–5. Dott ended the first session of his match with Hull 7–1 with breaks of 90, 73 and 66. He won the first two frames of the following session to make the quarter-finals 9–1.\nDing led the first session of his match against Stevens 5–3 from breaks of 111, 100 and 92 while his opponent compiled breaks of 82, 74 and 66. He won 9–5 and spoke of his relief to have won because his Asian Games schedule affected his stability and confidence. Davis defeated McManus 9–7; the match ended 20 minutes after midnight and the final frame lasted 46 minutes. In the final third round match, breaks of 103, 117 and 73 enabled Hendry to lead Williams 6–2. Williams improved his form to take three of the first four frames of the second session and be 6–5 behind. Hendry claimed three more frames with a match-winning break of 92 to qualify for the quarter-finals 9–6.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 13 and 14 December. Ebdon won four successive frames to lead Ding 4–0 and was 6–2 ahead after the first session. Ding won the evening session's first two frames with breaks of 110 and 82 and came from 40–0 behind in frame 11 with a 59 clearance. Ebdon won frame 12 after a shot battle with Ding and outscored his opponent 212–4 in the following two frames to win the match 9–5. Higgins came from 66–0 behind Perry to claim frame three with a 69 clearance and took the sixth with a 47 clearance after Perry missed a shot on the black ball. Perry accumulated breaks of 100 and 128 in the second session but Higgins won the match 9–3 with a 106 break in the 12th frame.\nHendry won 9–1 against O'Sullivan, a match which O'Sullivan defaulted. Trailing 1–4 and 24–0 in front during frame six after the black ball and after missing a red to a corner , O'Sullivan declared the match over. He shook hands with Hendry and referee Jan Verhaas. O'Sullivan left the Barbican Arena after wishing Hendry well in his dressing room. Tournament director Mike Ganley confirmed O'Sullivan had forfeited the match and O'Sullivan later apologised to Hendry and his fans in a statement. O'Sullivan was fined £20,800 and docked 900 ranking points by the WPBSA's disciplinary committee in May 2007. The last quarter-final saw Dott overcome Davis 9–6. He came from 3–2 behind to lead the first session 5–3 after breaks of 78, 83 and 65. Breaks of 52 and 61 enabled Dott to get within a frame of victory before Davis won two successive frames to make it 8–6. Dott's 116 break secured him a semi-final berth.\nSemi-finals.\nBoth the semi-finals were held on 15 and 16 December. Both Ebdon and Higgins were level at 4–4 after the first session that had seven breaks over 60, including 97, 76 and 132 from Ebdon. Higgins led 5–4 but he missed a tricky shot on a red ball and Ebdon cleared the table to force a black ball to again equal the score before going 6–5 ahead. In frame 14, Higgins missed a straightforward red ball while on a break of 49 and the frame was taken by Ebdon. He won a disjointed frame 15 to claim victory at 9–7 and enter his first UK Championship final since the 1995 tournament. Post-match, Ebdon considered the victory the most important of his career and praised the quality of the match, \"This win means so much to me because I have got so much respect for John. He's a wonderful ambassador for the game. You have to play top class when you play John.\" Higgins said that considered the game's decisive point to have been when he was leading 5–4 and attributed his loss to a lack of concentration, \"But take nothing away from Peter. He played very well all through the match and thoroughly deserved to win.\"\nThe other semi-final was between Hendry and his fellow Scot Dott. Trailing 5–3 after the first session Dott won four frames in a row with breaks of 96, 92 and 85 to take the lead as he accumulated 203 unanswered points. Hendry compiled a 111 clearance and a break of 50 to go level at 7–7. Hendry claimed frame 16 with a score of 61–25 and a break of 93 in the next earned him a place in the final alongside Ebdon at 9–7. It was Hendry's record-breaking 10th appearance in the final of the UK Championship and his first since the 2005 China Open. Hendry said additional practice in the past two to three weeks improved his playing, \"I'm so close to playing at my best – it's a pleasure to be competing again. Peter is playing fantastic snooker and is very hard to beat over a long match. But I'm just delighted to be in a final and have a chance of winning a tournament – I can't believe it.\"\nFinal.\nThe best-of-19 frames final happened on 17 December. In the afternoon session Hendry took 1 hour and 31 minutes to lead 3–1 with breaks of 51 and 59, but his lead was narrowed by one frame after Ebdon missed a shot leading 66–0 and Hendry did not win frame five. Ebdon moved 4–3 in front with a break of 83, and a then season-high clearance of 135. Hendry ended the first session at 4–4 after Ebdon made a double shot error. The evening session's first four frames were won by Ebdon through consistent potting and him playing tight , as Hendry's long-shot potting accuracy lowered and made errors on simple shots, which appeared to affect his confidence. Nonetheless, Hendry took frame 13 on the and won the next with his only century break of the match, a 116 clearance, to be two frames behind Ebdon at 8–6. Hendry missed a straightforward red ball in the 15th frame and Ebdon won it with a break of 43 before following it up with a break of 70 in the next frame to win the match 10–6 and his first UK Championship title. \nIt was his fifth career victory over Hendry in 19 meetings. Aged 36, Ebdon was the oldest UK Championship title winner since Doug Mountjoy in 1988. He also won the seventh ranking title of his career and his first since the 2004 Irish Masters. Ebdon joined Davis, Griffiths, Alex Higgins, Parrott, Hendry, Higgins, Williams and O'Sullivan as the ninth player to win both the UK Championship and the World Snooker Championship. He earned £77,000 prize money, and moved from tenth to fourth in the provisional world rankings.\nPost-match, a tearful Ebdon dedicated the win to his Dubai-based family and commented, \"This just means so much. It's a tournament I have worked so hard for. I always knew it was going to be tough against Stephen. He played some good safety in the first session, then I found a bit of rhythm and then Stephen inexplicably started to miss balls.\" Hendry bemoaned his poor performance but praised Ebdon, \"I picked the one day of the week when I didn't want to play like that. I had a great chance to go 4–1 up but from then on Peter was by far the better player and dominated the match. For some reason I couldn't pot a long ball – sometimes that just happens. Peter didn't play as well as he can either. We've both had better matches.\"\nMain draw.\nNumbers to the left of the players' names are the tournament seedings.

        "text": "Temporary fencing is a free standing, self-supporting fence panel. The panels are held together with couplers that interlock panels together making it portable and flexible for a wide range of applications. A common type of temporary fencing is Heras fencing.\nFence panels are supported with counter-weighted feet, have a wide variety of accessories including gates, handrails, feet and bracing depending on the application. Fence panels are commonly constructed of either chain link or weld mesh.\nTemporary fencing is an alternative to its permanent counterpart when a fence is required on an interim basis when needed for storage, public safety or security, crowd control, or theft deterrence. It is also known as construction hoarding when used at construction sites. Other uses for temporary fencing include venue division at large events and public restriction on industrial construction sites, when guardrails are often used. Temporary fencing is also often seen at special outdoor events, parking lots, and emergency/disaster relief sites. It offers the benefits of affordability and flexibility.\nCommon forms of temporary fencing include a variety of plastic fencing or panels constructed of chainlink, steel or wire. Fencing commonly consists of individual panels that can be set up around the perimeter of the desired area to be fenced in.\nPlastic temporary fencing has been used during English cricket games since 2001 as a form of crowd control.\nIn the evolution of temporary fencing, historical laws have significantly influenced its modern applications. Notably, during the Roman Empire, the 'Code of Justinian' mandated the use of temporary fencing, or 'circumvallation,' as a tactical measure during sieges. In contemporary times, the significance of fencing endures. For instance, the United States mandates certain industries to utilize temporary fencing for safety compliance, demonstrating how historical practices persist in shaping present-day regulations. Today's temporary fencing materials and designs, such as chain-link fencing, have evolved to meet the demands of construction sites, public events, and safety regulations."

        "title": "Mike Gregory (darts player)",
        "text": "Michael Seward Gregory (16 December 1956 – 19 April 2022) was an English professional darts player, best remembered as the runner-up to Phil Taylor in the 1992 Embassy World Darts Championship final, which went to a tiebreak final leg and is regarded as one of the greatest matches in darts history.\nGregory was also twice runner-up in the Winmau World Masters. Among his tournament wins were the News of the World Championship (1987 and 1988), the Butlins Grand Masters (1984), the MFI World Matchplay (1986), the WDF Europe Cup (1988), the WDC UK Masters (1992 and 1993) and the European Masters (1995). Gregory was also a controversial figure in the 1993 split in darts, first siding with the rebel World Darts Council players in leaving the British Darts Organisation, before rejoining the BDO.\nDarts career.\nGregory was one of the top ranked players from the mid-1980s through to the early 1990s, having been seeded in the top four at the World Championships on seven occasions – although he never won the World title.\nHis major breakthrough was beating John Lowe in the semi-finals of the 1983 British Open in which he finished runner-up to Eric Bristow. He lost again to Bristow in the final of that year's World Masters tournament. He made his World Championship debut in 1984 and reached the quarter-final, losing heavily 0–5 to Jocky Wilson.\nGregory lost at the quarter-final stage of the World Championship in 1987, 1989 and 1993. He made his first semi-final in 1990, losing to Eric Bristow and his only final appearance came in 1992 – when he lost an epic match 5–6 in sets to Taylor. Having missed six darts for the title – two each for double 20, double 8 and double 10, which he has since jokingly referred to as the Bermuda Triangle – the match went all the way to a sudden death leg, which comes when the players reach 5–5 in both sets and legs. It was the first time this had happened in the World Championship's 14-year history and the match is often mentioned in discussions about the greatest darts match; Taylor himself listed this as his greatest ever match. Gregory won the bull-off to throw first in the decider, but had a bounce-out on his first turn and Taylor comfortably sealed the win. Gregory would become the only man to have lost a World Championship final having had darts at double to win, and remained so until Mark McGeeney did so in 2018.\nWhilst he was never a World Champion, he won many televised titles of the era, including the 1984 Unipart British Professional (beating both Jocky Wilson and John Lowe), the 1986 MFI World Matchplay, as well as becoming one of only seven players to win the News of the World Darts Championship twice (in 1987 and 1988), joining Tom Barrett (1963–64 and 1964–65) and Eric Bristow (1983 and 1984) as the only other players to win it in consecutive years.\nRole in the BDO/WDC split.\nGregory was a controversial figure in the split in darts, a dispute between the game's governing body, the British Darts Organisation, and the top players. Darts had boomed in the 1980s, with as many as 23 televised events in 1983, but this had steadily diminished to just one by 1989. This reduction in prizemoney and television exposure meant that players were no longer able to make a living from the sport. The top players, their managers and darts equipment manufacturers felt that the BDO were not doing enough to improve the image of darts and attract new sponsors, so they formed the World Darts Council, which eventually became the Professional Darts Corporation. By the end of 1992, the WDC had begun to stage their own tournaments outside the auspices of the BDO. The first of these, the Lada UK Masters, was shown on Anglia Television and was won by Gregory.\nAt the 1993 Embassy World Championship, the WDC players were ordered to remove their WDC insignia. Later in the tournament, 16 WDC players, including Gregory, issued a statement saying that they would only participate in the 1994 World Championship if it came under the auspices of the WDC, and that they only recognised the WDC as having the authority to sanction their participation in darts tournaments worldwide. The BDO responded by banning the 16 \"rebel\" WDC players, and any other players or officials who associated with them, from all competitions. This was endorsed at a World Darts Federation meeting in October 1993 and became a worldwide ban. This resulted in four years of litigation, as the WDC sought to overturn the ban.\nGregory won the second WDC Lada UK Masters in November 1993, defeating Bob Anderson in the final. However, Gregory then had a change of heart, and announced in late November 1993 that he would be returning to the BDO. He was the second WDC player to move back to the BDO, after Chris Johns. The other WDC players were particularly aggrieved by Gregory's departure, as they felt he had let them down at a crucial juncture. He had also not informed them in advance. Coming just a month before the inaugural WDC World Darts Championship was set to begin, Gregory's defection threatened their recent broadcast deal with Sky Sports, as the contract stipulated that all WDC players were to participate in the tournament. Ultimately, Sky agreed to honour the deal, on condition that no other players withdrew.\nIn an interview on \"Time of our Lives\", Gregory admitted that in hindsight he made a mistake in leaving the WDC. Eric Bristow wrote in his autobiography: \"Mike's decision to leave hurt us badly because he was a good player and the good players really did need to show solidarity. When he defected back to the BDO we were down to fourteen and panic was setting in.\" Bristow, who had been good friends with Gregory, insisted that he would never speak to him again. John Lowe felt that Gregory had succumbed to pressure from Olly Croft, who warned that he would lose his house if the WDC lost its case. John Gwynne said: I think even he [Mike] would admit that it's the worst thing he ever did, because he was accepted then by neither side.\" When Phil Taylor won the inaugural Champions League of Darts in 2016, his first win broadcast on BBC since his 1992 Embassy world final victory over Gregory, he said: \"I'm sure he's watching so, to Mike, look at what you could have won, buddy!\"\nAfter the split.\nThe last BDO tournament in which the \"rebel\" players competed was the Finland Open in April 1993. Gregory's return to the BDO was in time for the 1994 British Open, which was staged on New Year's Day, and he reached the semi-finals. He was not able to compete at the Embassy World Darts Championship in 1994, as the tournament draw had been made before he decided to return to the BDO. Later in 1994, he won the Norway Open and Belgian Open.\nIn 1995, he returned to the Lakeside for the first time since the split as the number five seed. He reached the quarter-finals, losing 3–4 to Martin Adams.\nHis other WDF titles came in 1995, winning the Swiss Open and the Belgian Open. Gregory then won his last televised title in September 1995, when he won the Unipart European Masters tournament, which was held at Lakeside and broadcast on the BBC. In the semi-final, Gregory defeated the reigning BDO World Champion, Richie Burnett, and beat Peter Manley in the final.\nAfter Gregory's Unipart European Masters triumph, his form quickly faded. He suffered first round defeats in each of his next three appearances in the BDO World Championship at Lakeside – in 1996, 1997 and 1999, and did not qualify for the competition again. Other than a quarter-final appearance at the 2001 Welsh Open and a defeat to Davy Richardson in the final of the 2003 Scottish Open, he did not feature in the latter stages of Open events after 1999. His last appearance at a major WDF event was the 2005 Scottish Open, when he reached the last 16.\nGregory played county darts for Somerset and also played for Radstock in the Somerset Super League, where he appeared with the PDC player Steve Grubb.\nDeath.\nMike Gregory died on 19 April 2022, at the age of 65. He had been battling dementia in the last few years."

The centre also features a pro shop, bar and clubhouse with over 800 members.\nThe Club hosts training and junior development, as well as regular competition ranging from weekly matches to the Tasmanian Junior Masters and Tasmanian Junior Open, and the more glamorous Moorilla Hobart International, part of the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour, with over $US145,000 in prize money, and recently having featured former world number ones Kim Clijsters (2000 Champion), Serena Williams and Justine Henin, and also other top players such as Patty Schnyder (1998 Champion), Alicia Molik (2003 Champion), American veteran Amy Frazier (2004 Champion) and Australian Open and Wimbledon semifinalist Zheng Jie (2005 Champion).\nRedevelopment.\nMidway through 2009, the Tasmanian Government announced a $2.25 million to fund redevelopments to the Domain Tennis Centre over 2009–10. This announcement was to ensure that the Moorilla Hobart International tournament was retained. Prior to the 2010 singles final, representatives from Tennis Australia, along with tournament director Michael Roberts, announced that the future of the tournament would be secured through to 2013.\nIn 2009, the Domain Tennis Centre began a series of redevelopments in order to ensure the tournament's future. The first stage of these redevelopments included the demolition of the northern seating to make way for a permanent Corporate Stand and also a new Media Stand at the southern end of the Centre Court. This was completed prior to the 2010 Moorilla Hobart International tournament. The second stage of the redevelopment is to construct new permanent grandstands at the eastern and western ends of the court, increasing seating from around 1000 spectators to 2800. The redevelopment was completed before the 2011 tournament."

        "title": "History of cricket in Zimbabwe to 1992",
        "text": "The history of cricket in Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia and before 1965 Southern Rhodesia, includes Rhodesia first forming a first-class cricket team in August 1890, and the inaugural Test appearance of Zimbabwe in October 1992.\nUntil 1965 Rhodesia encompassed Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, but the cricket-playing population in that territory was very small. \nHistorical background.\nThe modern history of Zimbabwe starts with treaties and concessions initiated by Cecil Rhodes and the British South Africa Company in 1888/9. The country was the southern part of Zambezia until that name was officially changed to Rhodesia in 1895, and in 1898 the designation Southern Rhodesia was made official. Southern Rhodesia became a self-governing British colony in 1922.\nIn 1953 Northern and Southern Rhodesia were reunited in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and after its dissolution in 1963, an independence movement in Southern Rhodesia was led by Ian Smith. Southern Rhodesia was renamed Rhodesia in 1965, and a unilateral declaration of independence occurred. This was declared illegal by the UK, and 15 years of controversy and sanctions followed until finally the country gained official independence as Zimbabwe in April 1980.\nCricket in Rhodesia.\nIn cricket terms, Rhodesia was always tied to South Africa and for cricketing purposes were under the authority of that country's administrators until independence in 1980. The first recorded match in Rhodesia took place near Fort Victoria (modern Masvingo) on 16 August 1890, on a wicket of a bare twenty two yards of earth, shortly after Cecil Rhodes' Pioneer Column had formed a settlement. In the mid-1890s, the most important match of the Rhodesian domestic cricket season was Salisbury v Bulawayo. The Rhodesian Cricket Union was formed in 1898. The first English representative team, led by Lord Hawke, visited in 1898–99, with the match played on a matting wicket.\nFirst-class cricket was not established in the colony until the Rhodesian team began taking part in South Africa's Currie Cup competition from 1904 to 1905 following the inclusion on 1 February 1904 of the Rhodesian Cricket Union (RCU) in the South African Cricket Association (SACA; itself founded in 1890). Rhodesia's inclusion within the South African cricketing struture had already been provided for since 1898 as the South African Cricket Association's own Articles of Constitution noted that the \"area of the Association shall be divided into districts defined by the Government surveys, as the Association in general meeting may from time to time decide, and that the following be recognised as districts for Unions:- Western Province, Eastern Province, Border, Natal, (including Zululand), Transvaal (including Swazieland), Orange Free State (including Basutoland), Griqualand West, Bechuanaland (including Rhodesia)\". These provisions meant that when the RCU applied to be affiliated with the SACA on 21 December 1903, it was unanimously approved.\nThe initial first-class match was against Transvaal cricket team on 15–16 March 1905, at Johannesburg. Rhodesia lost by an innings and 170 runs. After this brief appearance, Rhodesia did not take part in the Currie Cup again until 1929–30. They played also in 1931–32, winning four out of five matches, but losing the cup to Western Province under the points system then in use. The Rhodesian team then did not return until 1946–47, after which they at last played regularly. The Rhodesian team toured other areas of Africa too. In 1951 they toured their northern neighbours East Africa. The first overseas team to play there. In this period, Denis Tomlinson became Rhodesia's first Test cricketer when he was selected to tour England with the South Africa national cricket team in 1935, Chris Duckworth the second for the English tour of 1955, and Tony Pithey the third against England in the home series of 1956/57.\nThe Logan Cup, a weekend contest between the four provinces, Matabaleland, Mashonaland, Manicaland and Midlands was played on an annual basis, later incorporating Northern Rhodesia, while in the winter months, with the farmers in fallow, Sunday Country Districts' Cricket abounded. Additionally in the late 1950s and early 1960s, in those winter months, the Stragglers, made up of a number of Mashonaland players, travelled to Blantyre for weekend matches on matting wickets against Nyasaland. In the 1961 game, Chris Duckworth scored 91 in 58 minutes.\nDavid Lewis was the captain of the Rhodesian team for 10 years, from 1953–54 to 1963–64, and the team included players such as Colin Bland, Chris Duckworth, Godfrey Lawrence, Percy Mansell, Joe Partridge, Tony and David Pithey, Lloyd Koch and Paul Winslow. \nAlthough the RCU became eligible for Associate membership of the ICC after 1965, when the ICC opened up associate membership more broadly (including to non-Commonwealth countries like the USA) it did not seriously consider applying as it valued its relationship with SACA more than an independent relationship with the ICC.\nBy the 1970s, the team was captained by Mike Procter and included players such as John Traicos, Duncan Fletcher, and Robin Jackman. However, despite this wealth of talent Rhodesia never won the Currie Cup. In all, 242 players represented Rhodesia in first-class and List A cricket.\nThe team played in 1979–80 as \"Zimbabwe-Rhodesia\", and left the competition for good at the close of that season after Zimbabwe officially became independent.\nCricket in Zimbabwe.\nThe only first-class matches in the 1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons involved the Zimbabwean national cricket team against tourists. Zimbabwe became an associate member of the International Cricket Council on 21 July 1981, and played first-class matches on its inaugural tour of England in 1982. Zimbabwe won the 1982 ICC Trophy, and this can be seen as its first step towards Test status. The team competed in the 1983 Cricket World Cup, unexpectedly beating Australia in its first match. Later, the team was weakened when white Zimbabweans, including Graeme Hick, left the country to pursue their careers elsewhere.\nZimbabwe's application for Test status and full membership of the ICC was again rejected at the ICC's July 1989 meeting&lt;ref name=\"Zimbabwe First-Class Cricket in 1988/89\"&gt;ZIMBABWE FIRST-CLASS CRICKET IN 1988/89&lt;/ref&gt; due to a veto by England, although it was agreed that in the future Zimbabwe could play five-day unofficial Tests against representative teams from Test-playing countries, while serving a five-year probationary period before their bid for full membership would be reconsidered in 1994.&lt;ref name=\"Zimbabwe First-Class Cricket in 1989/90\"&gt;ZIMBABWE FIRST-CLASS CRICKET IN 1989/90&lt;/ref&gt;\nZimbabwe was elected to full membership of the ICC in July 1992, with all full members voting in favour except for England who abstained,&lt;ref name=\"Zimbabwe First-Class Cricket in 1992/93\"&gt;ZIMBABWE FIRST-CLASS CRICKET IN 1992/93&lt;/ref&gt; and played its inaugural Test match versus India at the Harare Sports Club on 18–22 October 1992, under the captaincy of David Houghton. The match was drawn, and thus Zimbabwe became the first team to avoid losing its inaugural Test match since Australia beat England in the very first Test in 1877.\nThe main domestic competition is the Logan Cup which has a long history. This acquired first-class status from the 1993–94 season.\nZimbabwe cricket has also nurtured and produced South African born Andy Flower, whose test batting average was over 80 in both 2000 and 2001 and who ranks as one of the finest wicket-keeper batsmen in the history of the game.\nInternational tours of Rhodesia and Zimbabwe to 1992.\nA team of English cricketers financed by businessman Solomon Joel (hence known as S. B. Joel's XI) toured South Africa in 1924/25. One match was played against Rhodesia in Bulawayo which was won by S. B. Joel's XI by 8 wickets.\nThe touring New Zealand team played one match against Rhodesia at the start of their 1953/54 tour of South Africa. The three-day match at Bulawayo was drawn.\nPrior to the commencement of their 1957/58 tour of South Africa the Australian cricket team played three matches in Rhodesia. A 2-day match with North Rhodesia in Kitwe was drawn, a 4-day match against Rhodesia in Sailsbury was won Australia by an innings and 14 runs and a 3-day match versus Rhodesia in Bulawayo was a 10 wicket victory to Australia.\nRhodesia was visited by a New Zealand team at the start of their tour of South Africa in October 1961. They played two three-day first-class games against Rhodesia, the first in Bulawayo and the second in Salisbury. Both matches ended in draws.\nThis was the first tour by an international team of southern Africa that was confined to Rhodesia. The Commonwealth XI cricket team visited the country in February–March 1962 and played matches in Kitwe, Bulawayo and Salisbury. The first two matches were drawn, while the third match in Salisbury was a 74 run victory for the Rhodesian team.\nAn International Cavaliers cricket team toured Rhodesia in the 1962–63 season, playing a first-class matche against the team representative of Rhodesia, in Salisbury. Captained by Willie Watson, the Commonwealth XI included several famous or well-known players such as Basil D'Oliveira, Rohan Kanhai, Roy Swetman, Chandu Borde, Roy Marshall, Bill Alley, Trevor Goddard and Peter Loader. The three day match was drawn.\nAn International Wanderers team, made up of international players from multiple countries, toured Rhodesia in 1972. They played two 4-day matches against Rhodesia. The first game was drawn and the second game was a 411 run victory to Rhodesia. The International Wanderers toured Rhodesia and Transvaal in 1974. They played three 50-over matches and one 3-day match against Rhodesia. The International Wanderers won all four matches. In 1975 the International Wanderers visited again playing one 50-over match and two 3-day matches. The 50-over match in Salisbury was won by Rhodesia by 12 runs. The first 3-day match in Bulawayo was won by Rhodesia by 4 runs. The second 3-day match in Sailsbury was won by the International Wanderers by 9 wickets.\nThe Kenyan cricket team toured Zimbabwe in 1980/81 and played six matches. The two 3-day matches against the full Zimbabwean team were victories for Zimbabwe, winning the first match in Salisbury by 10 wickets and the second in Bulawayo by an innings and 103 runs.\nSri Lanka, after recently being awarded test status, toured Zimbabwe in 1982. They drew a two match limited overs series 1-1. There were then two 4-day matches, one being drawn and the other a victory to Zimbabwe by an innings and 40 runs. The tour was later overshadowed by several Sri Lankan players leaving to join a \"rebel tour\" to nearby South Africa, the Arosa Sri Lanka team.\nA touring team from Ireland visited Zimbabwe in 1986 and played 8 matches against local teams, but no matches against the Zimbabwe national side.\nIreland made another visit in March 1991 and played nine matches on their tour. One was a 9-day match against a Zimbabwe XI in Harare which was drawn."

        "title": "Australian PGA Championship",
        "text": "The Australian PGA Championship is a golf tournament on the PGA Tour of Australasia. It is the home tournament of the Australian PGA. Since 2000 it has been held in the South East Queensland region. The tournament was part of the OneAsia Tour from 2009 to 2014, and it has been co-sanctioned with the European Tour from 2015 to 2019 and again in 2022.\nThe championship started in 1929, when the Australian Golf Union decided to hold the Australian Professional Championship during their annual championship meeting. The leading 16 professionals in the Open championship qualified for the match play event, with four rounds of matches over 36 holes. The winner, Rufus Stewart, received the \"Joe Kirkwood Cup\", donated by Australian golfer Joe Kirkwood Sr. After World War II the PGA of Australia took over the organisation of the championship. It continued to be a match-play event until 1964, when it became a 72-hole stroke-play tournament. Kel Nagle holds the record for the most wins, with 6 wins, while Bill Dunk won the championship five times.\nBefore becoming a \"championship\" in 1929, a number of professional competitions were held at the Australian Golf Union championship meetings, the first being held in 1904. The Australian PGA treat some of these competitions, starting in 1905, as earlier editions of the same event. They also include the 1926 Sun-Herald Tournament as part of the same series.\nHistory.\nAt the annual meeting of the Australian Golf Union, held during the 1928 championship meeting, it was decided to hold a professional championship, starting at Royal Adelaide in 1929, to add to the Australian Open Championship and the Australian Amateur Championship, which were already held during the meeting. Professional competitions had been held at the championship meeting since 1904 but had never been given the title of \"championship\". Winners of the Sun-Herald Tournament, held from 1924 to 1926, and which had a similar format to the new championship, had been reported as being the \"professional championship of Australia\" and the winners called the \"professional champion of Australia\", although these were not necessarily official titles. Joe Kirkwood, Sr., during a visit to Australia in late 1928, donated a trophy for the new championship. The Australian Professional Championship followed the format of the amateur event, with the leading 16 professionals in the Open championship qualifying for the match play event. All matches were over 36 holes, the first three rounds played from Monday to Wednesday with the final was played on the Saturday, three days after the semifinals. There was tie for 16th place which was resolved by the first round scores in a professional \"purse\" at Kooyonga, played on the Saturday between the end of the open on Friday and the start of the professional championship on Monday. Rufus Stewart beat Ernie Bissett 8&amp;7 in the final.\nThe same format was used throughout the 1930s, the only variation being the day of the final. From 1930 to 1932 and in 1938 and 1939 the four rounds were played from Monday to Thursday, while from 1933 to 1937 the final was delayed until Friday to avoid clashing with the amateur final which was played on the Thursday. Rufus Stewart reached the final again 1930 but lost a close match to Jock Robertson. Sam Richardson won the championship twice, in 1933 and 1935. He reached the final again in 1937 but lost to Eric Cremin, who also won in 1938. Two cousins, Ted and George Naismith, reached the 1939 final, Ted winning 7&amp;5.\nThe first championship organised by the PGA of Australia was in 1946. It retained the previous format with 16 players competing over four days of 36-hole match-play. A qualifying system was used, similar to that used for the earlier Sun-Herald Tournament, with each state having a fixed number of qualifying places, determined by the number of members. New South Wales was allocated six places, Victoria five, Queensland two with South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia having one each. The states organised their own qualifying events. The championship was played at Manly from 11 to 14 December. The New South Wales qualifying event was a 36-hole stroke-play event played immediately before the championship, at Manly on 9 December. The final was between two of the New South Wales players, with Norman Von Nida beating Eric Cremin by one hole. Cremin reached the final five times between 1946 and 1952, losing them all. In 1947 he lost to Ossie Pickworth and in 1948 he lost to Von Nida again. With only 16 competitors it became practical to play the event in different locations, the 1948 championship being played in Tasmania and the 1949 event in Western Australia. The 1949 championship was won by Kel Nagle, the first of six wins in the event. The 1950 final was a repeat of the 1946 and 1948 finals and saw Von Nida beat Cremin for the third time.\nIn 1951 the qualifying system was changed, with the PGA Championship being played immediately after the Open. The leading 16 professionals in the Open qualified. Norman Von Nida won the championship, his fourth in six years. Qualification in 1952 was based on the leading professionals in the Sydney Ampol Tournament. Bill Holder beat Eric Cremin in the final. In 1953 the PGA Championship immediately followed the Open, with the Open acting as the qualifying event, as in 1951. Ossie Pickworth won his second championship, beating Peter Thomson in a close final. The Open again acted as the qualifying event in 1954, although the PGA Championship was not played until 6 weeks later, Kel Nagle winning his second title. From 1955 to 1961 the PGA Championship was played the week after the Open, which acted as the qualifying event. It was played in the same area as the Open, but not generally at the same club. In 1955 it was played in Queensland for the first time, Pickworth winning his third title. Les Wilson won in 1956, followed by Gary Player in 1957. Nagle won his third and fourth titles in 1958 and 1959, followed by John Sullivan in 1960 and Alan Murray in 1961. For scheduling reasons, only three days were allocated in 1961, with the first two rounds played over 18 holes on the first day.\nIn 1962, a 36-hole qualifying event was introduced, replacing qualification via the Open. As in 1961, there were two rounds on the first day of match-play, with 36-hole semi-finals and final on the following two days. The final was one-sided, with Bill Dunk beating Eric Cremin 8&amp;7. Cremin was playing in his seventh final since WWII, but lost them all. A similar format was used in 1963, except that all match-play rounds were over 36 holes. Col Johnston beat the American Ron Howell in the final, which was played on a Sunday for the first time.\nIn 1964 the tournament changed its format to 72-hole stroke-play. It has been played in that format to the current day, with the exception of 1973 when it reverted to match-play for a single season. Initially it was played over three days, with the leading 40 and ties playing 36 holes on the final day. Col Johnston won for the second year in succession, a stroke ahead of Bruce Devlin. Kel Nagle won for the fifth time in 1965, a shot ahead of Frank Phillips. In 1966 Bill Dunk led by 9 strokes after two rounds. Peter Thomson had a third round 69, to reduce Dunk's lead to two but had a final round 73 to Dunk's 68. Dunk won by 7 from Thomson with Bob Stanton third, a further 6 strokes behind. Thomson had his only win in 1967, having been runner-up four times. Johnston and Phillips tied for second place, a shot behind, with Peter Townsend fourth. Townsend dropped shots at the 14th and 15th holes to fall behind, while Phillips missed a short putt at the final hole.\nArnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus competed in the 1968 championship, which was extended to four days with a Sunday finish. However, 47-year-old Kel Nagle won the title for the sixth time, 6 ahead of Nicklaus with Bruce Devlin third, a further 5 strokes behind. Bruce Devlin won for the first time in 1969, played in Canberra for the first time, and won again in 1970, when it was played at Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast. It was played at Surfers Paradise again in 1971, Bill Dunk winning by 3 shots. Dunk came close to winning again in 1972 but was eventually runner-up, two strokes behind Randall Vines. In 1973 the event returned to a match play format. There was a single stroke-play round with the leading 64 qualifying for six 18-hole rounds of match-play over the following three days. Vines repeated his 1972 success beating Stewart Ginn in the final. Dunk won in 1974 after an 18-hole playoff, and won again in 1976, his fifth and final win, also after a playoff.\nThe 1977 event was sponsored by Telecom and saw an increase in prize money from A$20,000 to A$100,000. Mike Cahill won by 4 strokes. Telecom dropped its sponsorship after a single event and Mayne Nickless became the sponsor from 1978 to 1982, all five tournaments being played at Royal Melbourne. Prize money rose to A$175,000 in 1982. There were three overseas winners in this period, Hale Irwin in 1978, Sam Torrance in 1980 and Seve Ballesteros in 1981. Australians Stewart Ginn and Graham Marsh won in 1979 and 1982. Prize money dropped to A$40,000 in 1983 but rose to A$150,000 in 1984 under new sponsors Toshiba. Greg Norman won in 1984 and 1985, both times by 8 strokes, and was runner-up in 1986, losing to Mike Harwood. ESP sponsored the 1987 event, played at The Lakes Golf Club. Roger Mackay won by a stroke from American Mike Colandro.\nFrom 1988 to 1990 the championship was held at the Riverside Oaks club outside Sydney with prize increasing to A$500,000 in 1989 and 1990. In 1988 Wayne Grady beat Greg Norman after a sudden-death playoff, the first in the championship's history. Peter Senior won in 1989 followed by Brett Ogle, who won by five strokes in 1990. It was held at Concord from 1991 to 1993 with Ford sponsoring the event. Prize money dropped to A$250,000 in 1991 but increased to A$350,000 by 1993. Wayne Grady won for the second time in 1991, followed by Craig Parry in 1992. 1993 saw another playoff with Ian Baker-Finch beating Peter Fowler and Grant Waite. Reebok sponsored the event at the New South Wales club in 1994, prize money being reduced to A$200,000. Andrew Coltart became the first non-Australian to win since 1981. The 1995 event was cancelled because of the lack of a sponsor.\nThe event returned in 1996 sponsored by Mastercard who also sponsored the event in 1997 and 1998. Prize money was A$400,000 in 1996 rising to A$600,000 in 1998. Phil Tataurangi won in 1996, having started the last round eight strokes behind leader Chris Gray. Andrew Coltart won for the second time in 1997 with David Howell winning by seven strokes in 1998. The 1999 event was played at Victoria Golf Club with reduced prize money of A$300,000 and was won by Greg Turner.\nSince 2000 the championship has been held in Queensland, initially at Royal Queensland in Brisbane, before being played 11 times in a row, from 2002 to 2012, at Hyatt Coolum on the Sunshine Coast, later renamed Palmer Coolum. From 2013 to 2019 it was held at Royal Pines on the Gold Coast. From 2009 to 2014 the event was co-sanctioned with the OneAsia tour while the European Tour co-sanctioned the event from 2015 to 2019. Prize money was A$1,000,000 from 2000 to 2004, rising to A$1,500,000 from 2008 to 2011 before falling back to A$1,000,000 in 2014. Under the European Tour co-sanctioning prize money was initially A$1,750,000 in 2015, reducing to A$1,500,000 from 2016 to 2019.\nRobert Allenby won the championship in 2000 and successfully defended his title in 2001. He won again in 2005 and, for the fourth time, in 2009. In 2002, Peter Lonard and Jarrod Moseley were tied after 72 holes and after playing one hole of a sudden-death playoff, fading light meant that no further play was possible. They chose to share the title and not return the following day. After this joint win, Lonard won again in 2004 and 2007. He was also involved in a playoff against Nick O'Hern in 2006, O'Hern winning at the fourth extra hole. Peter Senior won in 2003, having previously won in 1989, and won for the third time in 2010 after a playoff against Geoff Ogilvy. Ogilvy was also a previous winner, having won in 2008.\nGreg Chalmers won the championship twice, both times after a playoff. In 2011 he beat Robert Allenby and Marcus Fraser at the first extra hole, while in 2014 the playoff went to seven extra holes, before he beat Adam Scott. 2012 produced a surprise winner, with Daniel Popovic winning his only important tournament. Although Scott lost in a playoff in 2014, he won the event twice, in 2013 and 2019. Nathan Holman won in 2015 after a playoff against Dylan Frittelli and Harold Varner III. Varner returned the following year, 2016, and won the championship by two strokes. Cameron Smith won in 2017, after a playoff against Jordan Zunic, and regained the title in 2018.\nThe 2020 championship was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the 2021 event was rescheduled to January 2022, without European Tour co-sanctioning, at Royal Queensland with prize money of A$1,000,000. Jediah Morgan won the tournament by a record margin of 11 strokes, with a record low score of 262. A second event was held in 2022, at Royal Queensland in November, as part of the 2023 European Tour season. Cameron Smith won by three strokes, his third win in the event. Min Woo Lee won the event in 2023.\nVenues.\nThe following venues have been used since the founding of the Australian Professional Championship in 1929.\nWinners.\nEarlier competitions.\nBetween the foundation of the Australian Open in 1904 and the creation of the Australian Professional Championship in 1929, the leading professionals attended the annual Australian Golf Union championship meeting and a number of professional competitions were organised at this time. Each year there was a professional competition organised by the club hosting the championship meeting and, in addition, other nearby clubs organised professional events.\nFrom 1904 to 1907 a two-day professional event was organised by the host club. The first Australian Open finished on Saturday 3 September 1904, and the leading eight professionals in it played a knock-out competition on the following Monday and Tuesday. The first two rounds were played on the Monday, followed by a 36-hole final. Carnegie Clark beat Alex McLaren 5&amp;4 in the final. In 1905 the professional event was played on the two days before the Open championship. After 36 holes of stroke-play on the first day, the leading four played match-play on the following day, matches being over 18 holes. Dan Soutar beat Gilbert Martin in the final. The 1906 tournament was played using the same format as in 1904 and resulted in another win for Soutar. Soutar won again in 1907, in a tournament with four rounds of match-play played over two days, with no qualification. The 1908 event was also match-play only but was extended to three days, the first round on Monday, two rounds on Tuesday and the final played on the Saturday. Carnegie Clark repeated his success of 1904.\nFrom 1909 to 1913 there was no match-play event organised for the professionals, although a one-day 36-hole stroke-play event was organised each year on the championship course. In 1909 and 1910 it was played the day before the Australian Open. In 1909 there was a tie between Fred Popplewell and Willie Thomson, while Dan Soutar won by 8 strokes in 1910. From 1911 to 1913 the professional events were played after the Open. Charlie Campbell won in 1911, while Soutar won again in 1912. In 1913 the professionals had two events at the Royal Melbourne. The first, with prize money of £25, was played on the Monday following the Open and was won by Soutar, with Popplewell and Rufus Stewart runners-up. The professionals played at the Metropolitan Golf Club on the Wednesday and then a second event was played at Royal Melbourne on the Thursday, again with prize money of £25. The result was similar to the Monday event with Soutar winning, Stewart second and Popplewell third. Soutar set a new course record of 70 in his morning round. The second event was sponsored by Watson's No. 10 Whisky with the intention that it would be an annual event.\nFrom 1920 to 1928, a two-day competition was arranged for the professionals after the Open. A 36 hole stroke-play qualifying stage was held on the Monday with the leading four playing match-play on the Tuesday. In 1928 the event was held a day later, on the Tuesday and Wednesday. The 1920 and 1921 events were handicapped. In 1920, Joe Kirkwood Sr., the open champion, was handicapped at plus-6 and failed to qualify. Walter Clark, receiving 3 strokes, beat Dan Soutar 2&amp;1 in the final. In 1921, Billy Iles, receiving 2 strokes, beat Arthur Le Fevre by 2 holes in the final. The handicap element was dropped in 1922, Charlie Campbell winning. Fred Popplewell won in 1923 while Tom Howard won in 1924 and 1925 followed by Arthur Le Fevre in 1926. Harry Sinclair repeated Howard's achievement, winning in 1927 and 1928.\nThe following competitions were played on the championship course during this period.\nSource:"

        "title": "The distance (boxing)",
        "text": "The distance, in boxing, refers to the full number of rounds in a match. It is frequently used in the expression \"going the distance\", which means fighting a full bout without being knocked out.\nIn title fights, this is called \"the championship distance\", which once was 15 rounds but today usually means 12 rounds (See history section), though there were some ten-round championship matches. Non-title fights can be of any length under 12 rounds but are typically 10 rounds or fewer. Women's championship boxing is ten rounds or fewer, each round lasting 2 minutes instead of 3 for men.\nHistory.\nIn the early days of bare-knuckle boxing, there was no limit on the number of rounds and so matches would be fought to a conclusion (i.e. with a knockout or tap out). For example, the match between Simon Byrne and James 'Deaf' Burke in 1833 lasted 3¼ hours. \nSubsequently, laws and rules were passed to prevent such protracted bouts. When John L. Sullivan made boxing under Queensbury rules with gloved hands popular, his matches were of a pre-determined length and the referee would decide the winner if they went the distance. If a match reached the prescribed limit without a formal result then the result would be \"no-decision\", though one boxer might be considered the winner by popular acclaim—a \"newspaper decision\". To regulate such results better, official judges were appointed to award points so that a technical winner could be determined. For a period, titles in many US states could not be lost if the match went the distance.\nFor amateur boxing, the Amateur Boxing Association of England set rules for the length of a match when it was formed in 1880. Initially there were three rounds of 3 minutes with a break of 1 minute between them. Changes were made in 1926 and 1997 and most recently, in 2000, the International Boxing Association made it four rounds of two minutes each.\nChampionships shortened.\nIn professional boxing, until the 1980s, the \"championship distance\" generally referred to the title rounds that numbered between 13 and 15. For decades, the last heavyweight title match scheduled for less than 15 rounds had been the September 22, 1927 10-rounder between Gene Tunney and Jack Dempsey; from then, the only bout that was not scheduled for 15 rounds had been a \"scheduled\" 20-rounder between Joe Louis and Abe Simon on March 21, 1941. This changed though, following the death of lightweight Duk Koo Kim in 1982 after his fourteen-round fight with Ray Mancini. Almost immediately, the World Boxing Council (WBC) issued a statement saying that WBC world title bouts would be set for 12 rounds.\nThe following year on March 27, 1983, the first ever heavyweight title fight scheduled for 12 rounds under that rule was held by the WBC between Larry Holmes and Lucien Rodriguez. The World Boxing Association, from which the World Boxing Organization had not yet separated, later followed suit by voting to reduce their championship distances to 12 rounds on October 19, 1987. While the International Boxing Federation, which had recently broken away from the WBA, continued to hold onto the position there was no documented medical evidence to show a 15-round fight is more dangerous than a 12-round fight, they eventually voted to shorten their championship distance to 12 rounds as well on June 3, 1988.\nThe last heavyweight 15-rounder title fight was on October 16, 1987 between Mike Tyson and Tyrell Biggs. The last middleweight 15-rounder title fight was a World Boxing Board title match on June 7, 1997 in which Jose Alfredo Flores won a split decision over Eric Holland in Ruidoso, New Mexico.\nIn recent years, there have been calls to return the championship distance to 15 rounds. For example, the debate following the Bernard Hopkins vs. Jermain Taylor fight on July 16, 2005 questioned whether Taylor, who was \"losing steam\" in the later rounds, would have won the title match were it a 15-round bout.\nDistance change criticisms.\nThe shift from a 15-round to a 12-round distance for title fights has been controversial. There have been studies which show that the brain becomes more susceptible to damage after the 12th round. Moreover, it has been argued that the 15-round distance greatly increased the risk of dehydration and exhaustion.\nHowever, \"purists\" of the sport have contended that the shift from 15 rounds to 12 rounds has impacted viewership of the sport. Moreover, Frank Lotierzo, a critic of the 12-round limit, pointed out that fatalities are rare in heavyweight matches, instead attributing deaths to dehydration from the pressure of \"making weight\" for lower weight classes:\nLotierzo also argues that part of the motivation for a 12-round limit was not so much for safety, but to allow the matches to appear on network television. Previously, the timing of boxing involved 15 three-minute rounds with 14 one-minute intervals between each round, the preamble, and post-fight interviews—requiring around 70–75 minutes; in contrast, a 12-round bout lasts 47 minutes, which fits neatly into a one-hour time slot when pre- and post-fight programming and commercials are added in. However, by the 1990s, championship boxing had been almost exclusively become a premium pay-television (HBO, Showtime, pay-per-view) sport, meaning no commercials were necessary, and making that irrelevant.\nNonetheless, it has been noted that these rule changes have made certain kinds of boxing deaths far rarer, though boxing remains the 8th most deadly sport with 1.3 deaths per 100,000 participants.\nSpeculation regarding change.\nIt has been argued that \"some of the greatest moments in sports would never have occurred\" were the 12-round limit imposed in earlier matches. Nonetheless, entirely different strategies might have been used were the fights scheduled for only 12 rather than 15 rounds, so it is possible that some or all matches could have ended the same way regardless of whether the scheduled distance were 12 or 15 rounds.\nThe following are some of the most notable longer championship distances, including the Fight of the Century, that would have had the reverse result were they abruptly ended after the 12th round:\nIt has also been argued that extra rounds would have changed other fights after the distance was changed. As before, the trainers worked with the 12-round rule, and based their strategies on the 36-minute distance, compared to the 45-minute distance.\nPopular culture.\nThe notion of \"going the distance\" is featured prominently in the 1976 film \"Rocky\" in which Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed fight 15 rounds for the World Heavyweight Championship. Rocky says, \nBalboa (Sylvester Stallone) and Creed (Carl Weathers) nearly go the distance again in their rematch in 1979's \"Rocky II\", as do Rocky and Ivan Drago in their showdown in \"Rocky IV\". Balboa's final fight against Mason \"The Line\" Dixon in \"Rocky Balboa\" lasts the maximum of 10 rounds.\nBalboa's use of the term has also inspired its use in other works."

Abdullah Sani Karim was the chief of the delegation.\nMedal summary.\nMultiple medalists.\nMalaysian competitors that have won at least two medals.\nMedallists.\nThe following Malaysian competitors won medals at the games; all dates are for December 2006.\nArchery.\nMen's recurve\nWomen's recurve\nAthletics.\nRoslinda Samsu won a silver in women's pole vault while Noraseela Mohd Khalid earned a bronze in the women's 400 metres hurdles.\nBadminton.\nMalaysia's biggest hope, the second seed ranking in the world, Lee Chong Wei is looking forward for at least a gold. However, after losing to the third seed from Korea, Lee Hyun-il by 21-19, 21-19, the Malaysian badminton team 2 men's double were beaten by the Korean team. Malaysia won the bronze medal in the men's team, after losing to South Korea by 3-1.\nIn the individual section, Lee Chong Wei faced Taufik Hidayat in the semifinals and losing to 21-16, 21-18. Again, he got a bronze medal only. However, Malaysia unseeded men's doubles pair of Koo Kien Kiat and Tan Boon Heong went all the way. After the world no. 1 Chinese pair in the quarterfinal and World Champion Indonesian doubles Kido Markis and Setiawan Hendra, they again beat another Indonesian team in the final, winning a victory gold medal for Malaysia in the men's double. This was Malaysia's 1st gold medal in badminton for 36 years. Malaysia was even unable to progress to the final in Asian games; they lost to Indonesia 12 years ago.\nBesides the men's singles and doubles, Malaysia also attained 2 bronze in the men's team event and also the mixed double.\nBodybuilding.\nMBBF is banking on Sazali Samad, who recently won the gold in the bantamweight category of Mr. Universe held in the Czech Republic in October. Sazali recently did a training stint with coach Milos Sarcev in California recently, which proved good as he picked up the Mr. Universe title soon after.\nHowever, in the 65 kg bodybuilding final, he was unable to catch another gold for Malaysia, but only earn a silver medal.\nBowling.\nEsther Cheah realised her dream by winning a gold medal at the Asian Games, just as her father and Malaysian national coach Holloway Cheah had done in the men's team of five event back in 1978.\nThe 20-year-old became the first Malaysian to win the tenpin bowling women's singles with an Asian Games record of 1,444 for a six-game series and an average of 240.7.\n“I trained her very hard for it,” Holloway Cheah said after his daughter's victory. “I leave everything with the Lord and I’m very proud for her. I knew that she could make it. It is the best Asian Games that I have attended in my life.”\nIndonesia's Putty Insavilla Armein had to settle for silver – the first ever medal for her country in women's singles at the Asian Games – despite earlier breaking the eight-year-old record with a total of 1,395.\nHowever Armein refused to be downhearted after the competition, paying tribute to Cheah instead: “I was not disappointed, she did better today. The battle of the day is over. My best today was not good enough to earn the gold.\n“I didn’t know I had [set a then record], but I am feeling extremely happy that I did that. What I did today is my best performance in this event.”\nAngkana Netrviseth claimed the bronze medal – an early present for her 17th birthday on 24 December – with a total of 1,331, three pins better than that of Japanese bowler Kanako Ishimine.\nEsther Cheah also helped Malaysia win the women's team of five crown with a Games record 6,555 total for a six-game series, but had to settle for silver in the all events competition behind Choi Jin A of Korea on Friday 8 December.\nThe medals took Cheah's personal haul at Doha 2006 to two gold medals and two silver, the 20-year-old having already become the first Malaysian to win the women's singles and then claimed silver in the women's trios.\nCheah and teammates Sharon Koh Suet Len, Wendy Chai De Choo, Zandra Aziela and Shalin Zulkifli at the Qatar Bowling Centre to shatter the previous six-game record of 6,272 – set by Japan in Busan four years ago.\nHowever this was not the only record the Malaysians claimed on the way to victory, posting new benchmarks for a one-game series and three-game series which had stood at 1,156 and 3,183 respectively.\nMalaysia took gold by 239 pins from the Korean quintet of Choi, Hwang Sun Ok, Gang Hye Eun, Kim Yeau Jin and Nam Bo Ra – the latter two having won the gold medal in this event in 2002 – who scored 6,316.\n\"We are very happy after winning gold today for the team of five. We got second in the last game of trios and after that we set our target for gold only and we have done it [as] this time we beat the team of Korea,\" Cheah said.\nThe bronze medal went to Tan Bee Leng, Cherie Tan Shi Hua, Evelyn Chan Lu Ee, Michelle Kwang Tien Mei and Valerie Teo Hui Ying of Singapore with their total of 6,239 being 165 pins better than the Chinese team.\nChoi, who led the Korean team by example with the top total of her compatriots, though had cause to smile after pipping Cheah to the all events gold medal with an average of 222.5.\nA bowler's totals from the singles, doubles, trios and team of five competitions are added together to determine the all events champion, with Choi's total of 5,339 being not only 43 pins better than that of Cheah, but also a Games record.\nThis gave Choi her fourth medal of the Games like Cheah, the Korean having also won silver in the doubles and bronze in the trios earlier in the week. Teo also collected her third medal with the bronze on 5,245, the Singaporean having also won the doubles with Kwang.\nBoxing.\nThree boxers represented Malaysia and competed for 11 gold medals at stake in this edition of the Asiad. The country garnered three bronze medals in boxing\nat the 2005 Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines. The Busan 2002 Asian Games powerhouse countries include: Uzbekistan, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Pakistan and Thailand.\nCue sports.\nEsther Kwan Suet Yee earned a silver in women 9 ball pool-singles.\nMen\nWomen\nDiving.\nMalaysian diver Elizabeth Jimie may only be 14 years old and have just two international appearances to her name, but she will be among the contenders to land a medal at the 15th Asian Games Doha 2006. \nJimie is already a world champion after her victory on home soil in the Group B (14–15 years old) 1 m springboard event at the 16th World Youth Championships in Kuala Lumpur in August.\nJimie beat two Chinese divers to take that gold at the Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA) event, and become the first Malaysian female diver to win a world title – only a month after making her debut on the international stage at the World Cup in Changshu, China.\nHowever Jimie, who comes from a family of four siblings in Kuching, is no stranger to the Malaysian scene. She was first drafted into the national squad as an 11-year-old, only to suffer from homesickness and return home to the state of Sarawak.\n“I will be partnering Leong Mun Yee for the 3m synchronised event,” Jimie told The Star newspaper. “I will also compete in the 1m and 3m springboard individual events.\n“It will be great to reach the final, but I want to concentrate on improving my diving skills.”\nMalaysia has high hopes for her with Edwin Chong, the Amateur Swimming Union of Malaysia (ASUM) Secretary, admitting that “it is not beyond her abilities to win an Asian Games medal, especially in the 3m synchronised event”.\nAs a result, in the women's 3 m synchronised event held on 11 December, Malaysia team of Edwin Chong and Elizabeth Jimie won a bronze medal with a total point of 275.04 points, 50.40 points behind the gold medalist (the China diving team).\nThe next day, again Elizabeth Jimie got another bronze medal in the Women's 1 m Springboard Final, with 280.30 points.

Earlier in the preliminary round, Yeoh get a 3rd place, only slightly behind China's Luo and Qin.\nMen\nWomen\nEquestrian.\nA bronze each from dressage - individual and Eventing - Individual, while a silver from dressage - Team.\nField hockey.\nMen's tournament.\nThe Malaysian men team shared the same group with Pakistan, Japan, Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei.\nGolf.\nMen\nGymnastics.\nArtistic.\nNg Shu Wai had won a silver in men's vault.\nKarate.\nThe Karate event had begun on 12 December, but on the 1st day, Malaysia had already won 5 medals, including 4 silver and a bronze. Ramasamy Puvaneswaran, Lakanathan Kunasilan, Ku Jin Keat and Anthony Vasantha Marial won a silver in Men's Kumite -55 kg, Men's Kumite -60 kg, Men's individual Kata and Women's Kumite -48 kg events respectively, while Lim Lee Lee won a bronze in the Women's individual Kata event.\nMen\nWomen\nSailing.\nUnexpectedly, 15 years old Rufina Tan Hong Mui, who took part in the women's optimist event, won a gold for her country, winning the 1st medal in the sailing events of Malaysia, as well as the 1st gold medal in the Asian games since 1994. She had 30 points in total, 12 points higher than the silver winning Japanese competitor, Komiya Haruka.\nIn the Laser 4.7 Open, Malaysia's Nurul Elia Anuar also won a bronze with 47 points in total after 12 races.\nMen\nWomen\nOpen\nSepaktakraw.\nIn men's regu and men's team, Malaysian team went into final and lost to the Thailand teams, winning two silver for Malaysia. However, in the men's double, Malaysia was defeated by Myanmar and only manage to get a bronze.\nMen\nShooting.\nMen\nWomen\nSquash.\nNicol Ann David will be an obvious gold medal hopeful, being her No.1 current world ranking. The Penangite is in top condition after winning the Hong Kong Open last month. With a disastrous outing at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in March this year, Nicol can be expected to give her 200 per cent to bag the Asiad gold medal as an apology to the country.\nFour Malaysian got themselves into the men's and women's individual semifinals. However, Sharon Wee Ee Lin was defeated by Hong Kong's Chiu Wing Yin with 9-6, 9-1, 9-3. However, the Nicol Ann David and the other two Malaysian men's squash player had given a place in the final. As a result, Malaysia is ensure to win at least 1 gold 2 silver.\nDefending champion Ong Beng Hee of Malaysia beat compatriot and top seed Mohamad Azlan Iskandar to claim the gold medal in the men's singles squash final at Khalifa International Complex on Thursday.\nIn a closely fought encounter, which could have gone either way, Ong prevailed 5–9, 9–1,10–9, 9–5. Iskander began the stronger, winning a series of long rallies and he was good value for his first set win. But thereafter things went awry for the top seed and Ong began to dictate terms.\nIskandar used gamesmanship on several occasions, prompting a number of lets during the match, but he was unable to disturb the concentration of Ong. Indeed, it was Iskandar who cracked first, throwing his racket to the ground in the crucial third game, which Ong just edged.\nWith Nicol Ann David's comfortable victory in the women's singles earlier in the day, Malaysia cleaned up on the courts, much to the delight of their supporters.\nAfter the game, Ong said, \"We've both done well. There were Malaysian finalists in both events. There were also a lot of VIPs here tonight, I see a lot of relieved faces!\n\"It's good to win, you never know when you can win another Asian Games gold medal. I was very nervous, I think he was very nervous too. I was very lucky to win the third game 10-9. If Azlan had won the third game 10-9, then it might have been a different story.\n\"I didn't think I played very well, but this was a tough match against a tough opponent who can easily dominate the court. I tried to use my mobility to move my opponent around the court.\"\nIskandar said, \"I just hit too many errors, made too many mistakes. It's not rocket science.\n\"I've been mentally tired. But the best athletes have to back it up every match. The objective is to win, simple.\"\nAs expected, World no 1 Nicol Ann David exorcised her demons of the last Asian Games, by winning gold in the women's squash singles at the Khalifa International Complex on Thursday, 14 December. Four years ago she suffered a devastating loss to Chiu Wing Yin at the final in Busan, Korea which caused her to take a four-month break from the game to reassess her career in the sport. But this time round it was a whole different story as she brushed aside her rival from Hong Kong, China 9–0, 9–3, 9–3 in just 30 minutes.\nClad in a striking red and black outfit, the Malaysian player was a picture of concentration and determination as she took to the court. She stamped her authority on the game early on and raced into a 3–0 lead. She made good use of the court to stretch that advantage to 5–0. Try as she might, Chiu had no answer to Davis's incessant pressure and the opening game ended with a 9–0 whitewash in just six minutes.\nDavid began the second game in similar fashion, winning the first point by varying her pace. Chiu finally broke the ice with a powerful shot to the right-hand corner of the court. But David was soon on top again and, after a series of long rallies, she stretched her lead to 4–1, before wrapping up the second game, 9–3.\nIn the third, the world No 1 raced into a 3–0 lead. Chiu managed to win a few points after an impressive array of shots and evened the score at 3-3. But David returned with a series of clinical executions to confirm her status as the Asian Games' top player and seal the match with a 9–3 score in the final game. Her gold was the 200th for Malaysia in Asian Games history.\nAfter the game, David was keen to play down any talk of revenge, she said, “There is no thought of revenge. It is more about wanting to win that medal. She is a hard player to play and I had to keep her out of her comfort zone.\nVolleyball.\nBeach volleyball.\nMen\nWomen\nWushu.\nIn women's Taijiquan - two events combined, Malaysian girls won both gold and bronze.\nChai Fong Ying of Malaysia has won the first wushu medal of Doha 2006 by securing the women's taijiquan two events combined crown. This is also the sixth gold of Malaysia in this game.\nThe World No.1 was a convincing winner, coming out on top in both the taijiquan (shadow boxing) and taijijian (taiji sword) disciplines to win with a score of 19.38.\nTaolu"

        "title": "2002 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 2002 Rose Bowl, played on January 3, 2002, was a college football bowl game. It was the 88th Rose Bowl game and was the BCS National Championship Game of the 2001 college football season. The game featured the Miami Hurricanes and the Nebraska Cornhuskers, marking the first time since the 1919 Rose Bowl, and only the third time in the game's history, that neither the Big Ten nor the Pac-10 Conferences had a representative in this game. The Hurricanes won the game, 37–14, for their fifth national title. Miami quarterback Ken Dorsey and wide receiver Andre Johnson were named the Rose Bowl Players of the Game.\nTeams.\nBecause the Rose Bowl was hosting the BCS Championship game, as part of the agreement begun in the 1998 season, the Tournament of Roses committee would get the number one and number two ranked teams in the Bowl Championship Series system. However, this was actually the third Rose Bowl number one versus two pairing, with the first two in the 1963 and 1969 games.\nNebraska Cornhuskers and Miami Hurricanes.\nIn yet another controversial season for the BCS, Nebraska was chosen as a national title contender despite not having played in the Big 12 championship game. The Huskers went into their last regularly scheduled game at Colorado undefeated, but were beaten by Colorado 62–36. The Huskers dropped to the 6th in the wire service polls but only 4th in the BCS. In the ensuing two weeks, #2 Florida lost to Tennessee, the Colorado Buffaloes (ranked 7th in the BCS) went on to win the Big 12 Championship Game over Texas (ranked 3rd), and in the SEC Championship Game, Tennessee (now at #2) was stunned by LSU. This left Miami as the undefeated and undisputed No. 1 team in the country but a host of other teams vying for #2. The BCS computers did not take into account at which point a team's loss came during the season. There were also components for strength of schedule, quality win, and margin of victory. With this calculation, one-loss Nebraska came out ahead of two-loss Colorado and one-loss, second-ranked Oregon.\nPreviously, Nebraska had appeared in the 1941 Rose Bowl in a 21–13 loss to Stanford. This was the first appearance for the Miami Hurricanes in the Rose Bowl.\nPac-10 and Big Ten.\nOregon was the champion of the Pacific-10 Conference and was ranked No. 2 in the AP Poll. They were selected for the 2002 Fiesta Bowl, where they faced No. 3 ranked Colorado, who was No. 4 in the BCS poll. The Illinois Fighting Illini, ranked No. 8 in the BCS, won the Big Ten Conference championship and were picked for the 2002 Sugar Bowl.\nAftermath.\nOregon defeated Colorado in the 2002 Fiesta Bowl. In the final AP poll, Miami was the unanimous No. 1 team, Oregon was #2. The next time that the Rose Bowl hosted the BCS championship, the 2006 Rose Bowl, the USC Trojans would be a participant. The 2002 contest was the last one not to feature a team from either the Big Ten or Pacific-10 until the 2018 Rose Bowl, which was a component of the College Football Playoff and pitted Georgia against Oklahoma.\nThe game, which was played on a Thursday night, two days after the parade, has been remembered as a low point for the Rose Bowl. University of Michigan coach Bo Schembechler remarked, \"Didn't watch it,\" when asked what he thought of the 2002 Rose Bowl.\nThe 2002 Rose Bowl was the first broadcast not set at the traditional 2:00pm West Coast time. The visual of the afternoon sun setting on the San Gabriel Mountains on New Year's Day is recognized as an important part of the tradition of the game."

        "title": "Germany at the Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Athletes from Germany (GER) have appeared in only 20 of the 22 editions of the Winter Olympic Games as they were not invited to two events after the World Wars, in 1924 and 1948. Germany hosted the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and had been selected to host in 1940 again.\nThe nation appeared 11 times as a single country (IOC code GER), before World War II and again after German reunification in 1990. Three times, from 1956 to 1964, German athletes from the separate states in West and East competed as a United Team of Germany, which is currently listed by the IOC as EUA, not GER.\nDue to partition under occupation that resulted in three post-war German states, German athletes took part seven times for the contemporary states they lived in, in 1952, and from 1968 to 1988. The all-time results of German athletes are thus divided among the designations GER, EUA, FRG, GDR and also SAA (the Saarland only took part in the 1952 Summer games and won no medal).\nIncluding the Winter Games of 2014, German athletes have won 377 medals : 136 gold, 135 silver and 106 bronze. The IOC currently splits these results among four codes, even though only the East German Democratic Republic (GDR) from 1968 to 1988 had sent a separate team to compete against the team of the German NOC that represented Germany (GER) since 1896.\nTimeline of Germany at the Winter Olympics.\n1924 - 1948.\nIn the Paris Peace Conference, the outbreak of World War I was blamed on Germany and other Central Powers allies. These nations, even though having new republican governments by now, were not invited to the 1920 Summer Olympics. While all other banned nations except Germany were invited again for the 1924 Summer Olympics, held for the second time in Pierre de Coubertin's home town of Paris, and for the 1924 Winter Olympics, also held in France, the ban on Germany was not lifted until 1925. This was likely related to the ongoing French Occupation of the Ruhr and the Rheinland between 1923 and 1925. Thus Germany was not present in Chamonix for the first Winter Olympics.\nGermany took part the first time in the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, with rather modest results, scoring only a Bronze medal in bobsleigh. Germany doubled the low score in the 1932 Winter Olympics held in Lake Placid, United States. Both 1932 games, held during the worldwide Great Depression, suffered from low European participation due to high cost of travel overseas.\nAlready in spring of 1931 it had been decided that the 1936 Summer Olympics were to be held in Berlin. Germany should host the 1936 Winter Olympics, too. From 1933 onwards, Germany became known as Nazi Germany, the change being marked also by the use of the Nazi party flag. To host the winter event, two Bavarian towns were merged to form Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Alpine skiing made its first appearance as the combined, which added the results of both the downhill and slalom which were not separate contests yet. German athletes won Gold and Silver in both the men's and women's combined, for a 2nd rank overall.\nThe 1940 Winter Olympics were to be held in Sapporo, but Japan withdrew in 1938 due to the Second Sino-Japanese War. In June 1939, Garmisch-Partenkirchen was selected again, but three months later World War II broke out and the 1940 Winter Games were cancelled in November 1939. The 1944 Winter Olympics did not take place either. For the 1948 Winter Olympics, with the war in recent memory, Germany (and Japan) was not invited as it had no recognized NOC anymore. The NOC had been, as other organizations, been dissolved by the Allies.\nSeparate German teams 1952 - 1988.\nThe 1952 Winter Olympics were held in Norway, which had been occupied in 1940 by Germans. \nPublic discussions in Norway were rather lively on the subject of whether or not Germans should be admitted to the Winter Games. Following the annual meeting of the IOC in Vienna in May 1951, invitations were extended to the German Olympic Committee, placed in the Federal Republic of Germany. On the whole, the press approved of\nthis decision, and the reaction of the Norwegian public seemed to prove that the decision was based on a correct estimate of the public opinion.\nThe IOC had not recognized the East German NOC, and asked the GDR to send athletes to the German NOC team, which was rejected by the GDR officials. The Saarland, having a recognized NOC but barely any winter sports tradition, did not participate in the Winter Games, but in the 1952 Summer Games, before joining West Germany later on. Thus Germans from West Germany took part in the 1952 Winter Olympics in 21 of 22 events, winning two Gold medals in bobsleigh, and one in figure skating. The IOC presently attributes the 2 Gold medals won by Bavarian bobsledder Andreas Ostler to \"Federal Republic of Germany (1950-1990, \"GER\" since) FRG\" for a 5th rank, while all other medals are attributed to \"Germany GER\" for a sixth rank. The figure skating couple Ria Falk/Paul Falk won Gold. Skier Annemarie Buchner aka Mirl Buchner won a medal in each of the three events she took part. Skier Rosa Reichert took another silver medal.\nDuring the Oslo IOC meetings, several important matters were discussed, such as East German participation in Olympic Games. In Olympic Games in 1956, 1960 and 1964, German athletes of both states competed together as United Team of Germany (GER then, currently designated EUA). The 1968 games saw two separate German teams which still used the compromise common symbols.\nThe two states sent independent teams, incl. separate national symbols, designated as East Germany (GDR) and West Germany (GER 1968-1976, FRG 1980-1988) after that for five Games between 1972 and 1988 until the separate East German state ceased to exist in 1990.\n1992-.\nAfter the German reunification in 1990 country returned under the IOC code GER and topped Olympic medal tables in 1992, 1998, 2002 and 2006.\nOverview of Olympic participation.\nMedals by sport (GER 1928–1936, 1952, 1992–current).\n\"These totals include the one gold and one silver medal won by Germany in figure skating at the 1908 Summer Olympics.\""

        "text": "Harold Percival \"Whipper\" Watson (May 6, 1923 – November 19, 2002) was a Canadian professional ice hockey left wing who played for the Brooklyn Americans, Detroit Red Wings, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Chicago Black Hawks, winning five Stanley Cups over a 14-year career in the National Hockey League.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Watson played junior hockey for the Saskatoon Junior Chiefs (1938–39), the Saskatoon Chiefs and Saskatoon Dodgers (1939–40), and the Saskatoon Junior Quakers (1940–41).\nCareer.\nIn 1941, at age 18, Watson turned professional with the Brooklyn Americans in the NHL in what would be the team's final season. He was selected by the Detroit Red Wings in an intraleague draft and played there in 1942–43, winning his first Stanley Cup. Watson then joined the Royal Canadian Air Force as World War II escalated. While in the military, he played for the Montreal RCAF team in 1943–44, as well as for the Saskatoon RCAF squad. The following season, he played for the Winnipeg RCAF team.\nAfter a two-year break from the NHL, Watson rejoined the Red Wings after the war for one season and was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs on September 21, 1946, for Billy Taylor. Watson played eight seasons for the Leafs, winning four Stanley Cups over that period. In 1948–49, he led the Leafs in points and goals, with 26 goals and 19 assists in 60 games. He didn't take a single penalty through the entire regular season.\nShortly into the 1954–55 season, the Leafs sold Watson to the Chicago Black Hawks. After three years in Chicago, Watson played one more year as a professional, as player-coach of the Buffalo Bisons in the American Hockey League, before retiring in 1958. He coached the St. Catharines Teepees of the Ontario Hockey League in 1958–59, and coached the senior Windsor Bulldogs to an Allan Cup championship in 1962–63.\nThrough his 14 years in the NHL, Watson played 809 games, scoring 236 goals and 207 assists for 443 points. He won five Stanley Cups (1943 with Detroit, and 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1951 with Toronto). He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1994."

        "title": "Acrobatic gymnastics",
        "text": "Acrobatic gymnastics is a competitive discipline of gymnastics where partnerships of gymnasts work together and perform figures consisting of acrobatic moves, dance and tumbling, set to music. There are three types of routines; a 'balance' routine (at FIG grade 5 and above) where the focus is on strength, poise and flexibility; a 'dynamic' routine (also FIG grade 5 and above) which includes throws, somersaults and catches, and (at FIG grade 6 and above, as well as grade 4 and below) a 'combined' routine which includes elements from both balance and dynamic.\nThe sport is governed by the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG, an abbreviation of Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique). At international level, there are four FIG categories of competition defined by age; 11–16, 12–18, 13–19, and 15+ (Senior). There are also grades 1–6, with grade 5 being the same difficulty as 11–16 and grade 6 being the same difficulty as 12–18.\nAcrobatic gymnasts perform in pairs or groups and enter into and are judged at a specific level or age group category. In each partnership, the gymnasts' different sizes and abilities will be balanced to complement each other in order to carry out the complex moves. Some will mainly carry out supporting and pitching roles, and are known as bases. They are then balanced with usually smaller gymnasts who become the 'tops'. In men's and women's groups there are also one or two 'middles', who are like another base who usually will support the top while balancing on the base. The different partnerships seen in competition are:\nAs well as this, in grades 1–2 there can be mixed groups (either 3 or 4 people from both genders). In competition, partnerships perform a routine to music, that has usually been choreographed specifically for them. The gymnasts carry out their acrobatic moves and combine them with dance, all in time to and in keeping with the style of the music. Partnerships are judged on artistry/dance (worth 10.0 points out of 31.5) execution of skills (marked out of 10 and doubled to give 20.0 points out of 31.5) and difficulty of skill (worth 1.5 out of 31.5).\nThe rules for the sport, known as the Code of Points, are governed by the FIG. These rules are subject to change every four years in line with the Olympic cycle, as in other disciplines of gymnastics.\nCompetitions.\nAcrobatic Gymnastics is part of the World Games, and are also included in the European Games as well as having a dedicated Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships held in even numbered years (known as World Sports Acrobatics Championships prior to 2006), and continental or region championships in odd numbered years. For example, the 28th Acrobatic Gymnastics European Championships were held in Rzeszow, Poland in October 2017.\nThere are also numerous national, state, and regional competitions that are held in each country. Local and regional competitions often form the qualification stages required to compete at national championships. There is no requirement from the FIG for gymnasts to have qualified through their own national championships to compete internationally, but local governing bodies will often make their national team selections based on performance at national competition.\nAcrobatic gymnastics events often attract sizable audiences, because they are entertaining, exhilarating, and suspenseful due to perceived risky or daring moves. At the London 2012 Olympics, acrobatic partnerships were seen performing before the Olympic gymnastic events, and during the opening and closing ceremonies. It has been said that its appearance, despite not being an Olympic discipline, is testament to its ability to entertain.\nGold, silver, and bronze medals are generally awarded in the usual fashion; although in some competitions, a minimum score is required to qualify for medals.\nRoutines.\nThe number of required routines at a competition depends on the level at which the gymnasts are competing. At the junior and senior levels, all three routines mentioned below are required. At lower age levels, only a single simpler routine is required. Each of the routine types has a different emphasis, but all include tumbling and dance as elements. The different routine types are as follows:\nScoring.\nThe acrobatic gymnastics competitions are judged on a score out of 30.00. The following are the categories in which the athletes are scored.\nScores over thirty are not uncommon, as difficulty points are not limited.\nFor Senior Elites the difficulty has no cap, meaning that they can exceed 30.00 by having a lot of difficulty.\nJudging.\nThe judging panels of acrobatic gymnastics are similar to other disciplines of gymnastics where different panels of judges are overseen by a head judge, and each panel has a 'Chair of the Judging Panel' (CJP) who oversees that panel's activities. In acrobatic gymnastics, there are then difficulty judges (DJ) who only assess the difficulty of the elements in the routines; artistic judges (AJ) who only assess the performance and artistic merits of the routine; and execution judges (EJ) who only judge what points should be deducted based on imperfect execution of individual elements in the routine. The numbers of each type of judge on an acrobatic panel depends on the level of the competition and can vary from one to many (with the exception of the Chair, as there is only one CJP per panel).\nHistory.\nThe first use of acrobatics as a specific sport was in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, and the first world championships were in 1974.\nIn addition to the current five categories, two additional categories for tumbling (men's and women's) were included until the 1999 World Championships, though some groups still involve tumbling events.\nIn the United States, the first national sports acrobatics organization was called the United States Sports Acrobatics Federation (USSAF). Founded in 1975, its name was changed to the United States Sports Acrobatics (USSA) in the 1990s. The USSA then merged with USA Gymnastics in 2002, and Acrobatic Gymnastics is now a discipline therein."

        "text": "James Edwin Gibbons (September 26, 1936 – August 20, 2016) was an American professional football tight end for the NFL's Detroit Lions (1958–68).\nEarly life.\nGibbons was born in Chicago, Illinois. He attended the University of Iowa, where played on teams with future Detroit Lion teammate Alex Karras.\nHe earned All-America and All-Big 10 honors as a senior and Hawkeye team captain in 1957. In a 1957 game against Minnesota he caught nine passes for 164 yards and two touchdowns in a 44-20 Iowa victory.\nIn the 1957 Rose Bowl, Gibbons was a starter on the #3-ranked Iowa team that defeated #10-ranked Oregon State 35-19, catching a 16-yard pass from quarterback and the game's MVP Ken Ploen. His touchdown catch in a home game against Ohio State on November 10, 1956, was the lone score in the game and clinched the Rose Bowl appearance and at least a tie for the Big Ten championship (which the team went on to win) for Iowa as the #7-ranked Hawkeyes defeated the #6-ranked Buckeyes, 6-0.\nProfessional career.\nGibbons and Karras were two of seven Hawkeyes selected by NFL teams in the 1958 draft; Karras was the 10th player chosen as the Lions' #1 pick. Gibbons was drafted in the sixth round by the Cleveland Browns. The 6'3\", 220-pound tight end spent all of training camp with Cleveland and had impressed the coaching staff. However, three days prior to the first regular season game, the Browns acquired punter Dick Deschaine from the Green Bay Packers. To make room on the roster, Gibbons was traded to the Lions in exchange for a fifth round draft pick in 1960. Cleveland used that pick to acquire guard John Wooten, a two-time All-Pro who started for the Browns through the 1967 season.\nGibbons blossomed as a key part of the Lions' offense for the next seven seasons, playing with the club 11 years overall. He earned Pro Bowl honors three-times during his career, after the 1960, 1961 and 1964 seasons. He had a career year in 1964, earning Lion MVP honors, catching 45 passes for 605 yards and 8 touchdowns. Also in 1964, Gibbons set the Lions record for receiving yards in a game by a tight end, with 161 yards on December 13 against the San Francisco 49ers. The record stood until 2022, when it was broken by T. J. Hockenson's 179 yards against the Seattle Seahawks.\nAs of 2018, Gibbons ranks tenth on the Lions' all-time reception list with 287 receptions, 3,561 yards and 20 touchdowns. Selected to three Pro Bowls, one career highlight came in a 1960 game versus the Baltimore Colts in Baltimore. Gibbons scored the game winning touchdown on a 65-yard pass from quarterback Earl Morrall as time expired, giving the Lions a 20–15 victory. It was the game's third lead change in the last 15 seconds of play.\nGibbons died on August 20, 2016, at the age of 79 of natural causes. Gibbons' brain was donated to Boston University for research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurological disorder observed in professional athletes with repeat brain trauma."

He attended Colorado A&amp;M, now known as Colorado State University.\nCollege career.\nJim David played as an offensive and defensive halfback, linebacker, and end for Colorado A&amp;M from 1949 to 1951. In his senior year, he was ranked second in the nation in receptions. During his college career, David lettered in both football and baseball. Prior to attending college, he served in the Army as a staff sergeant in the infantry, which included a tour-of-duty in Europe.\nDavid was inducted to the Colorado State University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1989.\nProfessional career.\nJim David was a member of three Detroit Lions World Championship teams in the 1950s, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in Detroit history. The six-time Pro Bowler (1955–60) roamed in the Lions secondary, often referred to as \"Chris' Crew\", for eight seasons (1952–59) after being drafted out of Colorado A&amp;M. David's teammates in that secondary included Hall of Famers Jack Christiansen and Yale Lary, and they were also joined by Bob Smith and Karl Karilivacz. He ended his career with 36 interceptions, which still ranks fifth in Lions' history, and he recorded a season-high of seven interceptions three times (1952, 1954 and 1956).\nKnown around the league as \"The Hatchet\", David was a major contributor on an instrumental Lions' defense that helped Detroit's championship teams in 1952, 1953 and 1957. Standing only 5-11 and weighing a little over 170 pounds, he earned the nickname \"Hatchet\" in 1953 when, in successive games, he delivered devastating tackles that knocked future Hall of Famers Y. A. Tittle (San Francisco 49ers) and Tom Fears (Los Angeles Rams), out of both games.\nAfter retiring from the Lions, David immediately entered the pro coaching ranks - joining the Los Angeles Rams' coaching staff as defensive backs coach from 1960 to 1962. Jim later became the Rams' chief talent scout in 1963. He then joined Jack Christiansen's San Francisco 49ers coaching staff, as secondary coach, from 1964 to 1966. In 1967, another former Lions' teammate and Hall of Famer, Joe Schmidt, hired David to help run the Lions' defense. He served in that capacity for six seasons from 1967 to 1972. Among the star players he coached was Hall of Famer Lem Barney, whom David presented during his Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement in 1992."

The start was made in the center of a set of 8 numbered marks that were placed in a circle. During the starting procedure, the sequence of the marks was communicated to the sailors. By picking the mark that was most upwind, the start could always be made upwind.

RCA administers the game of cricket in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The Rajasthan Cricket Association was founded in 1931 at Ajmer and was formerly known as the Rajputana Cricket Association.\nIt officiates the state level cricket in Rajasthan and the Rajasthan cricket team. It selects the cricket team of the state of Rajasthan to play in Indian first class cricket, namely the Ranji Trophy, the Vijay Hazare trophy and the Duleep Trophy.\nVaibhav Gehlot is the incumbent President of the RCA. The Rajasthan Cricket Association is officially recognized by Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and affiliated to it.\nHistory.\nThe association was formerly known as Rajputana was renamed to Rajasthan Cricket Association after the formation of the State of Rajasthan in 1956. Headed by Bhagwat Singh Mewar until 1972, it was controlled by the Rungta family from 1972 to 2004. Promulgation of a Sports legislation by the \"Government of Rajasthan\" resulted in Lalit Modi beating Rungta in the first ever contested election in 2005.\nFormer IPL chief Lalit Modi created a world-class infrastructure in Jaipur, restructuring the stadium and cricket academy. Changing political equations saw Lalit Modi lose by a wafer-thin margin to Sanjay Dixit in 2009. The Association was headed by CP Joshi as president and Sanjay Dixit as the Secretary. Lalit Modi won the election again in 2013, however legal disputes have marred his team's functioning in the last 2 years.\nRajasthan Cricket Association's Rajasthan cricket team won the Ranji Trophy in 2011 for the first time in the 77-year history of the tournament, by beating Baroda on 15 January 2011 at Vadodara. They gained another title win in the 2011/12 seasons. Prior to this, Rajasthan had finished runners-up eight times between 1960 and 1974.\nFinance.\nIn a move to honor and help former Ranji players who have represented Rajasthan in the past, the RCA declared a monthly pension scheme for former players wherein players who have played 5 to 14 matches will be given Rs. 5,000 per month while players who have represented Rajasthan in 15 to 24 games, will be given an amount of Rs. 7,500. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) gives monthly pension to players who have played at least 25 first-class games, hence this decision from the RCA comes as a godsend for former Rajasthan players who haven't represented their state in 25 first-class matches.\nAdministration.\nVaibhav Gehlot is the incumbent president and Mahendra Sharma is the secretary of Rajasthan Cricket Association. Various district cricket associations of Rajasthan are affiliated to the RCA.\nFuture development.\nRCA do not have its own stadium like other most of the Indian state cricket boards have. It organize its domestic and international cricket matches at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, it is owned by the government of Rajasthan. The Rajasthan Cricket Association laid the foundation stone for its own cricket stadium on February 5, 2022. The stadium is expected to be completed in three years and will be located near Jaipur-Delhi bypass Highway outside Jaipur in Chonp village, which is 25 kilometers away from Jaipur. The stadium will have two practice grounds that can be used for Ranji trophy matches. According to the RCA president Vaibhav Gahalot, this stadium will be the world’s third-largest cricket stadium with a seating capacity of 75,000. It will be the third largest cricket stadium in the world after Narendra Modi stadium and Melbourne Cricket Ground if compared by seating capacity. The estimated cost for the stadium is 300 cr. rupees."

        "title": "Men's Irish Junior Cup (field hockey)",
        "text": "The Men's Irish Junior Cup is a knockout trophy played for field hockey clubs in Ireland. Entry is open to sides that do not qualify for the Irish Senior Cup and to the second teams of clubs that play in the Irish Senior Cup. The trophy was first played for in 1895, a year after the Senior version of the trophy.\nHistorical format.\nFrom its start in 1895 until the 1980s, the tournament was played in regional tournaments. The winners of the regional tournaments in Leinster, Munster, Ulster and at times Connacht would proceed through to semi-final matches. The finals were played in one weekend until 1935. The final was then moved to a separate weekend. The change was prompted by the circumstances of the 1934 finals. Castlecomer played the semi-final against Cork Harlequins (with extra time) on the Friday afternoon and a semi-final replay (with more extra time) on the Saturday morning. After winning the marathon semi-final, the exhaustion of the Castlecomer team forced them to scratch from the Final that was due to be played on the Saturday afternoon.\nCurrent format.\nIn the 1980s the format of the competition was changed when the last eight teams from the regions entered an open draw. After a few years of operating this system the competition was changed to a completely open draw.\nThe introduction of the Irish Trophy in 2008-09 meant that entry to the Irish Junior Cup was restricted to club's second teams. A small number of third eleven teams also qualify.\nBoth teams are allowed a squad of 18 as long as you have two fully kitted goalkeepers and there is no extra time, a drawn match will be finalised with penalty strokes.\nThe Irish Junior Cup Trophy is the only trophy in Ireland where the Captain's name is engraved as well as the team's name and year."

        "text": "John Michael Walton (born 10 November 1961) is an English professional darts player currently playing in World Darts Federation (WDF) events. He is best known for winning the 2001 BDO World Darts Championship. He adopted the nickname John Boy and used the song \"Cotton Eye Joe\" by Rednex as his walk-on theme.\nBDO career.\n1993–2000: Early career.\nWalton picked up some small tournament victories in the early stages of his career, including the Websters 150 Championship in 1993 and the Highlands Open Championship in 1996 but didn't manage to qualify for the World Championship until 1999 when he lost 0–3 to Roland Scholten on his first round debut. He failed to qualify for the World Championship in 2000, but in the autumn of that year he won the prestigious Winmau World Masters. Despite that success, he was 50/1 with the bookmakers to win the World title in the New Year, and his Masters form possibly led to him being tipped by darts pundit Bobby George at the start of the BBC televised coverage as a possible winner.\n2001–05: World title.\nWalton opened his 2001 campaign with a 3–1 first round win over Ritchie Davies and averaged an excellent 100.62 during the match. He then beat Mervyn King 3–0 with another high average of 99.00. His quarter-final was a 5–0 whitewash over Marko Pusa, in which Walton won 14 consecutive legs. Walton then beat Wayne Mardle 5–3 in the semi-final and Ted Hankey 6–2 in the final to become World Champion. This also made him one of only a few players to have held both the Winmau World Masters and World Championship simultaneously. He joined Eric Bristow, Phil Taylor, Richie Burnett and Bob Anderson as the fourth player to win them in the same season. Martin Adams and Stephen Bunting have since joined this elite group of players.\nWalton's defence of his Lakeside title in 2002 ended with a second round loss to Colin Monk and he went out in the second round to Davies in 2003. He reached the 2004 quarter-finals, but lost 1–5 to Raymond van Barneveld. In 2005 he lost to Darryl Fitton in the second round and he was knocked out by Stephen Roberts in 2006. Another second round defeat, this time to Gary Robson followed in 2007, and in 2008 he lost in the first round to the then-reigning Winmau World Masters champion Robert Thornton. He hasn't won any of the major open events since his successful year in 2001 when he took the British Open, British Classic, Belgium Open, Scottish Open and Portland Open.\n2007–14.\nWalton made history at the 2007 Winmau World Masters in Bridlington by hitting a televised nine dart finish. It was the first time a player had hit a nine-darter in the televised stages in the 34-year history of the event (Chris Mason achieved one in the preliminary round a few years previously), and was the first on BBC television since Paul Lim's historic World Championship feat in 1990. Walton's 2008 campaign was hampered by a shoulder injury but despite sliding down the world rankings, he entered the 2009 BDO World Championship as the number 15 seed. He won through an emotional first-round game against his friend Shaun Greatbatch who was battling bone marrow cancer. He then caused a major shock by beating defending champion Mark Webster 4–0 in the second round. He then played Hankey in the quarter-final, a repeat of the 2001 Embassy Final which Walton won. Hankey avenged the earlier loss with a 5–1 win, and went on to win the championship. On 24 May 2009, Walton hit another 9 darter at the Antwerp Open in the final against Drik Beni. The 9 darter came in the third leg and he went on to win the game 4–0, only to go out the next round to Joey ten Berge in the last 32. In the 2010 Six Nations Cup tournament held in Sligo. Walton representing England, hit his third 9 darter against Dave Smith-Hayes of Wales. This rare achievement in a single leg format of the team event has, as yet, not been equalled. Walton was unseeded for the 2011 World Championship, but beat 16th seed Dave Prins 3–1 in the first round before being defeated by Martin Adams 4–3 in a sudden death leg. The match has already been touted as one of the best in the tournament's history. In 2011 season, he retained the English Masters beating Ross Montgomery in the final. Walton failed to qualify for the 2014 BDO World Darts Championship, the first time since 2000 he did not appear at the event.\n2015–18.\nWalton lost the Malta Open 2015 final in November 2015 against Ümit Uygunsözlü. Walton qualified for the 2016 BDO World Championship, but did not enter many events after 2016. He did qualify for the TV stages of the 2018 World Masters, beating Martin Adams and Andy Hamilton in the floor stages before losing 3-1 to Glen Durrant in the last-32.\nWorld Seniors Darts Championship.\nWalton made a return to the TV Screens by playing in the Inaugural World Seniors Darts Championship, He beat fellow World Champions Les Wallace 3-2 and John Part 3-1 In the opening two rounds, before losing in the quarter final to Terry Jenkins 3-1.\nWalton also competed in the Modus Super Series and Live League in 2022.\nPDC career.\nIn January 2015, Walton joined the rival PDC by entering the PDC Qualifying School in an attempt to win a tour card. He was unsuccessful in doing so having failed to finish in the top 18 of the Q School Order of Merit."
