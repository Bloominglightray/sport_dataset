        "text": "Josh Hoover is an American football quarterback for the TCU Horned Frogs.\nEarly life and high school.\nHoover was born in Rockwall, Texas where he attended high school at Rockwall-Heath. Hoover finished his high school career throwing for 9,953 yards and 108 touchdowns in three seasons. Hoover was initially committed to play college football for the Indiana Hoosiers. However, he de-committed and changed his commitment to play for the TCU Horned Frogs.\nCollege career.\nIn Hoover's first career season in 2022, he would redshirt and only appear in one game completing his only pass attempt for two yards. In week six of the 2023 season, Hoover came in to relief for starting quarterback Chandler Morris after he went down with an injury. Hoover completed 11 of his 19 pass attempts for 119 yards and one touchdown, with an interception, but the Horned Frogs lost to Iowa State. In the following week, Hoover made his first career start where he completed 37 out of his 58 passing attempts for 439 yards and four touchdowns, as he led TCU to a rout of BYU winning 44-11.\nPersonal life.\nHoover is a Christian. He has said, “My faith keeps me grounded and gives me comfort that no matter how I perform on Saturday’s, God still loves and cares about me.”"

        "text": "The Yakima Indians were a minor league baseball team based in Yakima, Washington. \nIn 1920 and 1921, the \"Indians\" played as members of the Class B level Pacific Coast International League, winning the 1921 league championship. \nThe Yakima Indians hosted home minor league games at the Athletic Field, known today as Lions Park.\nHistory.\nThe Yakima Indians were preceded in local minor league baseball play by the 1913 and 1914 North Yakima Braves, who played as charter members of the six–team Class D level Western Tri-State League. The league folded following the 1914 season, after not being able to raise funds to continue play. Western Tri-State League president Roy W. Ritner stated that the failure of the league to return to play was due to the North Yakama, and Walla Walla clubs not wanting to work together.\nIn 1920, the Yakima \"Indians\" resumed minor league play in Yakima, as the Indians became members of the six-team Class B Level Pacific Coast International League. The Pacific International Coast International League had evolved from the 1919 Northwest International League that played without a Yakima franchise.\nThe Yakima \"Indians\" nickname corresponds with local history and culture. The Yakama are a Native American tribe based in the region.\nThe Seattle Giants, Spokane Indians, Tacoma Tigers, Vancouver Beavers and Victoria Islanders teams joined Yakima in beginning league play on May 5, 1920.\nIn their first season of play in the Pacific Coast International League, Yakima placed second in the 1920 league standings. The Indians ended their 1920 season with a record of 65–48, playing the season under manager Frank \"Tealy\" Raymond. Yakima finished 3.0 games behind the first place Victoria Islanders in the six–team league.\nPaul Strand of Yakima won the 1920 Pacific Coast International League batting title, hitting .339, while his Indians teammate Charles Gorman scored 101 runs to lead the league. James Harrigan of Yakima had 156 total hits, most in the league.\nThe Yakima Indians won the league championship in 1921, in the final season of play for the Pacific Coast International League, which reduced two teams to become a four-team league. Yakima won the league championship, finishing in first place with a final record of 79–36, playing the season under returning manager Teally Raymond. Yakima finished 16.5 games ahead the second place Tacoma Tigers, as the four–team league held no playoffs. The league had adopted a split-season format, but Yakima was in first place in both halves, negating a playoff series.\nGeorge Lafayette of Yakima hit .428 to capture the 1912 league batting title. Lafayette also led the Pacific Coast International League with 132 runs scored and 179 total hits. Yakima pitcher Guy Cooper won 22 games with 162 strikeouts to lead the league in both categories.\nAfter compiling a two-season record of 144–84, Yakima was unable to defend their 1921 championship, when the Pacific Coast International League did not return to play in 1922. The Tacoma Tigers and Vancouver Beavers franchises became members of the 1922 Western International League, while the Yakima and Victoria Bees teams did not resume play.\nYakima next hosted minor league baseball sixteen years later, when the 1937 Yakima Pippins began a 14-year tenure as members of the Western International League.\nThe ballpark.\nIn 1920 and 1921, the Yakima Indians hosted home minor league home games at the Athletic Field. In the era, the site was bordered by 6th Avenue, West Pine Street &amp; West Maple Street at South 6th Avenue &amp; South 5th Avenue. The site is still in use today as a public park, known as Lions Park. The park is adjacent to A.C. Davis High School (Washington), which was first constructed in 1905 and is located at 202 South 6th Avenue. Lions Park is located at 509 West Pine Street in Yakima, Washington."

That season the X-Men competed with other local colleges for the inaugural Hewson Cup, donated by E.E. Hewson. Rules stipulated that the first team to win the trophy three times would be allowed to keep the cup. SFX proceeded to win the title in the first three years of contention and lay permanent claim to the trophy. A second trophy was made, called the Sumner Cup, however, due to St. Francis being accused of knowingly using ineligible players (despite no governing body or official eligibility rules at the time) SFX was not included in competition for the second trophy. After returning from World War I, the animus against St. Francis had ebbed and the X-Men were one of the founding member of a new intercollegiate conference, the Maritime Intercollegiate Athletic Association. St. Francis Xavier swiftly became one of the league's best teams and won several championships in the interwar years. SFX left the MIAA sometime in the early 30s but the team was still invited to participate in the conference tournament each year. During this time, St. Francis also played in a local senior league and competed for the Allan Cup on multiple occasions.\nDuring World War II, St. Francis was one of three teams who attempted to play for the duration but the program was eventually forced to suspend operations in 1944. It returned after a 1-season break and became the dominant force in the MIAA. The X-Men won every single conference tournament from 1950 to 1959 (The 1953 tournament was cancelled due to a bleacher collapse) and were by far the best team of the maritime colleges. In 1954, the MIAA teams ended their senior hockey play and focused solely on the college level. When the CIAU championship began in 1963, SFX was the first entrant from MIAA but the X-Men had trouble winning on the national stage. Despite making 6 appearance in the first 15 years of competition, St. Francis Xavier failed to make an appearance in the finals.\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, the fortunes of the program changed and the once-lofty X-Men became a middling team at best for most of the next 15 years. St. Francis Xavier did not regain its former status until the late 90s. Even then, it wasn't until 2004 that the team won another league championship, however, that year also saw St. Francis win its first national championship. SFX has made several trips to the national tournament in the years since with their best finishes coming in 2016 and 2018 as runners-up (as of 2023).\nSeason-by-season results.\nSenior and collegiate play.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\"\nCollegiate only.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\"\nSee also.\nSt. Francis Xavier X-Women ice hockey"

        "text": "The 2005 Rhode Island Rams baseball team represented the University of Rhode Island during the 2005 NCAA Division I baseball season. The Rams played their home games at Bill Beck Field as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference. They were led by head coach Frank Leoni in his thirteenth and final year as manager.\nThe Rams won the East Division championship, notching a 34-21 (18-6) record. In the 2005 Atlantic 10 Conference baseball tournament, the Rams clinched the top seed, and the bye-round, and defeated sixth-seeded Richmond and second-seeded George Washington in the championship game en route to their first-ever NCAA Division I baseball tournament as a four seed, where they were knocked out in the first round by top seeded Long Beach State and third-seeded Pepperdine. After the conclusion of the tournament, Leoni accepted the job at fellow Atlantic 10 Conference member William &amp; Mary to be the head coach of the Tribe. The Rams would not make another appearance in the NCAA Division I baseball tournament until 2016.\nBackground Information.\nThe University of Rhode Island opened in 1889, following the Second Morrill Act, an amendment to the pre-existing Land Grant Act. The baseball team was founded in 1898 and began to play on and off throughout the years before finding consistency in 1907. Rhode Island had rarely featured successful teams throughout the years prior to Frank Leoni's hiring as manager in 1993. Leoni was a starter on Rhode Island's baseball team from 1988-1990, playing shortstop for the Rams. When hired in 1993, he was the youngest head coach in modern history of NCAA Division I baseball. He immediately began a winning culture in Rhode Island.\nPrevious Season.\nThe 2004 team finished 35-20-1 (20-4) overall, becoming just the second Atlantic 10 Conference member to win 20 conference games in a season. The top seed overall in the 2004 Atlantic 10 Conference baseball tournament, the Rams lost to fourth-seeded St. Bonaventure in the first round before defeating second-seed St. Bonaventure and third-seeded Richmond in the losers’ bracket before falling to the Bonnies again in the championship game. The Rams failed to clinch an at-large bid into the 2004 NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\nPreseason.\nRhode Island starting pitcher Zach Zuercher was named to Collegiate Baseball Newspaper's Second-Team All-American list.\nRhode Island was predicted to win the Atlantic-10 Conference and make their first ever NCAA Tournament appearance.\nSeason.\nRegular Season.\nRhode Island began their season on a rough patch, losing eight out of their first ten games to No. 12 Florida, Maryland, Central Michigan, IPFW, Sacred Heart, Kentucky and Miami (Ohio). The Rams did not capture their first win until March 13, upsetting SEC member Kentucky 7-5. Rhode Island kept their losing skid going throughout the month of March. Once April hit, however, and conference play began, Rhode Island began a tear throughout their schedule. After going 6-11 throughout February and March, Rhode Island went 15-4 throughout the entirety of April, with highlight wins against division rivals Richmond, St. Bonaventure and Temple. They continued their surge, with a commanding 12-game winning streak heading into the month of May. Rhode Island clinched the Atlantic-10 Regular Season title on May 14 with an 8-0 at Massachusetts.\nAtlantic 10 Tournament.\nAfter finishing 34-21 (and 18-6 in conference), Rhode Island would clinch the number one overall seed in the 2005 Atlantic 10 Conference baseball tournament. The Rams would not look back, defeating #4 seed Dayton 7-4 in the quarterfinals and #6 seeded Richmond 8-3. In a rematch of the Atlantic 10 Championship game from the previous year, Rhode Island would defeat #2 seeded George Washington 9-7 to clinch Rhode Island's first ever NCAA tournament berth in college history. Second-baseman Wayne Russo would win the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, after going 7-11 hitting with a .636 batting average, two doubles and three RBIs, and catcher Josh Nestor and outfielders Daryl Holcomb and David Savard would join Russo in the All-Tournament Team, with Nestor making his second straight All-Tournament Team.\nNCAA Tournament.\nThe Rams clinched the number four seed in the Long Beach Regional, joining number one seeded Long Beach State (hosts of the regional), second-seeded USC and third-seeded Pepperdine in Long Beach.The Rams' first taste of the tournament would be cut short, however, as an 11-2 defeat to Long Beach State in the first round, and a 2-1 walk-off defeat in the sudden death loser's bracket to Pepperdine would eliminate the Rams in the first two days of the tournament. USC would wind up defeating Long Beach State to advance to the Corvallis Super Regional, where they were promptly knocked out by Oregon State, whom clinched a berth to the College World Series. Following the tournament, Frank Leoni accepted the job at conference-rival William &amp; Mary. Jim Foster would promptly be hired by Rhode Island to succeed Leoni.\nStats.\nBatting.\n\"Note: G = Games played; AB = At bats; R = Runs; H = Hits; 2B = Doubles; 3B = Triples; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in; SB = Stolen bases; BB = Walks; AVG = Batting average; SLG = Slugging average\"\nSource:\nPitching.\n\"Note: W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; G = Games pitched; GS = Games started; SV = Saves; IP = Innings pitched; H = Hits allowed; R = Runs allowed; ER = Earned runs allowed; BB = Walks allowed; SO = Strikeouts\"\nSource:\nOffseason.\n2005 MLB Draft.\nThird baseman Mike Rainville and right-handed pitcher Mick Lefort were both signed as undrafted free-agents after the draft, by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the Chicago Cubs respectively "

        "text": "The Baseball Study (also known as the Baseball Experiment) was an academic experiment that tested how reading comprehension is impacted by prior knowledge. In 1987, education researchers Donna Recht and Lauren Leslie tested middle school students on the topic of baseball, evaluating their results based on the participant's reading abilities and prior knowledge of baseball. They concluded that prior knowledge was just as important as reading proficiency in the student's abilities to comprehend written text.\nDesign and implementation.\nIn 1987, researchers Donna Recht and Lauren Leslie developed a study to determine how much reading comprehension depended on prior knowledge of a topic. As the study was to be conducted on junior high students, they chose the topic of baseball under the assumption that the kids could potentially be familiar with the sport. Starting with 64 students, the participants were split into four groups based on their reading ability and prior knowledge of baseball. Each student read a half-page of text describing a baseball inning and were then asked to recreate the action on a model baseball field, demonstrating their comprehension of what they had just read.\nThe study found that the students who were previously familiar with baseball were better able to recreate the described action. According to the researchers: \"Students with high reading ability but low knowledge of baseball were no more capable of recall or summarization than were students with low reading ability and low knowledge of baseball.\" The study also found that the students assessed as 'less proficient' readers were \"better at identifying important ideas in the text and at including those ideas in summaries\", skills that are considered important for overall reading comprehension. Natalie Wexler, an educational journalist, described the key takeaway as demonstrating that \"the bad readers who knew a lot about baseball outperformed the good readers who didn’t\".\nRecht and Leslie were surprised at the results and reached the conclusion that if \"educators want to accelerate student learning, it will be essential to consider students' background knowledge in the planning\". They published their research in the Journal of Educational Psychology in 1988.\nEffects.\nThe baseball study has been described as \"elegant in its simplicity but profound in its implications\". The study's findings were praised for revealing that readers with \"sufficient background knowledge are able to comprehend and learn more easily because they have multiple ways to store information\".\nThe Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA) lauded the study for increasing the connection between education and the community \"while also dismantling stereotypes and bridging cultural divides\". It cites the study's results as a way to assist at-risk students, such as students from historically marginalized groups and low socioeconomic backgrounds, through the use of culturally relevant teaching to improve academic success."

The AS Rugby Vicenza club was founded by former \"Recoaro\" players, who were active in the 1960s.\nThe creation responds to strong expectations in the city and very quickly licensees flock. Soon the club was able to field two senior teams and a junior team. The club quickly rose to Serie B.\nIn the 1980s the club merged with \"Rugby Thiene\" which brought many talented players with it.\nIn 2011 and 2012, the club obtained two successive climbs which brought it to the second division. In 2017, Rangers Vicenza gained great unintentional notoriety when their Argentine captain Bruno Doglioli attacked a referee in the middle of a match against Valsugana. He is disbarred for life.\nAfter a good 2022 season which saw them finish second in their groups, Vicenza obtained accession to the first division in 2023.\nCurrent squad.\nThe Rangers Vicenza Rugby squad for the 2023–24 season is:"

        "text": "Arkansas has a fleeting association with ice hockey in the United States. The Natural State has had only brief flirts with the game but has largely been uninterested in ice hockey.\nHistory.\nDespite several of its neighbors being targets of ice hockey expansion over the years, Arkansas did not receive its first official franchise until the late 1990s. The Arkansas GlacierCats debuted in 1998 at the Barton Coliseum in Little Rock. In spite of, or perhaps due to, the introduction of the sport, the GlacierCats were well situated in their first season. The team finished well above .500 and managed to draw more than 4,000 attendees per game in its first season. Unfortunately, the team found itself in a battle for the spotlight when the Arkansas RiverBlades appeared the following season. The RiverBlades' arrival was delayed by a year as they waited for the Alltel Arena to be finished and the new building gave them a leg up. The two teams, both based in Little Rock, often had games occurring on the same day or even at the same time. While the RiverBlades were able to get nearly 4,000 on a given night, the GlacierCats saw their attendance drop by more than 1,000 and, with the ill health of their league, the team folded after the year. The good times for the RiverBlades did not continue, however as their attendance dropped after a solid first season. Dave Berryman sold a 51% interest in the team to Equity Media Holdings in 2001 but the team's situation continued to worsen. By 2002 the team saw fewer than 3,000 fans per game and, despite seeing a slight increase in their fourth season, the team folded in 2003.\nThe following year, junior hockey came to Arkansas with the Texarkana Bandits. The team began well, posting a winning season in its first year and then increasing its win total over the following two campaigns. Unfortunately, when a more promising spot opened in the St. Louis market, the team moved despite increased interest from the local community.\nAs of 2023, no further attempts have been made to place an ice hockey team in Arkansas.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nAs of 2023, no players from Arkansas have achieved notability in ice hockey. The state, as a whole, has one of the lowest engagement rates in the nation. Just 415 people were registered with USA Hockey in 2022, good enough for 0.012% of the population. Both numbers are 48th in the nation."

It was founded by the Chinese Ice Hockey Association (CIHA) as an amateur league in 2021 and was reorganized as a professional league in 2023.\nThe league should not be confused with the National Women's Ice Hockey Championship (), an annual national competition for provincial teams.\nHistory.\nIn 2021, the CIHA established the first women's ice hockey league held in China, the Chinese Women's Ice Hockey League (). An amateur league competition for clubs and independent teams, it was founded in an effort to promote and develop youth and women's ice hockey in China, increase the number of players in the national program pool, and to encourage growth of a viable Chinese ice hockey market via the creation and expansion of programs, clubs, and infrastructure; future professionalization of the league was a founding goal.\nThe league was reorganized into the Chinese Women's Ice Hockey Professional League ahead of the 2023–24 season, becoming the first professional league organized by the CIHA. With the establishment of a Chinese professional league, Shenzhen KRS left the Russian Zhenskaya Hockey League (ZhHL) to participate in a domestic league for the first time, increasing the number of teams in the WCIHL to seven.\nThe option for teams to sign up to five international import skaters was introduced following the reorganization of the league. In an effort to \"fully train domestic goaltenders,\" signing foreign goaltenders is not permitted.\n2023–24 season.\nThe inaugural WCIHL season began with a tournament in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang during 25 November to 2 December. Shenzhen KRS topped the standings after winning all six games of the tournament.\nThe remaining tournaments of the regular season were held in Harbin, Heilongjiang during 9 to 16 December and in Shenzhen, Guangdong during 30 December to 6 January. \nThe finals tournament was contested in Beijing during 19 to 26 January. The top-four teams from the regular season – Shenzhen KRS, Qiqihar Landi, Harbin WIHT, and the Beijing Swift – participated in the finals.\nA total of eleven import players – from Canada, Finland, Russia, and Slovakia – were active in the 2023–24 WCIHL season. They were contracted to three teams: five played for Shenzhen KRS, three played for the Beijing Swift, and three played for the Sichuan Qin Champion.\nFormat.\nThe WCIHL season uses a multi-tournament system divided into two parts: a regular season of three tournaments followed by a finals tournament. For each regular season tournament, the seven teams travel to a host city and play a single round-robin of 21 games across a seven or eight day period. The regular season comprises 63 games, with each team playing a total of eighteen matches.\nThe top four teams from the regular season advance to the finals. There are two stages in the finals: the semifinals and the championship/third place finals, each played as a best-of-three series.\nAwards.\nA player of the game is selected per team after each game and one player is recognized as best player per tournament. Seasonal awards include best forward, best defenseman, best goaltender, and most valuable player.\nTeams.\n2023–24 season.\nSources:"

        "text": "The 1926–27 MIT Engineers men's ice hockey season was the 26th season of play for the program. The Engineers were coached by Bill Stewart in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nEntering the season, MIT had just 2 starters returning from the previous years' squad, however, several others did have some experience with the Engineers. Captain Bill Berkeley teamed up with fellow senior Deke Crandall on the blueline while Bill Richards took over in goal full-time. The forward unit was an entirely new contingent with Fahey, Crosby and Duplin getting first team roles for the opening tilt. Coach Stewart tried to fight fire with fire and match the many alternates that Harvard used, however, they were unable to match the speed of the Crimson. Berkeley snagged the lone MIT goal on a long shot while the forwards were ineffective throughout the match. The second game saw a better effort as MIT tied Boston University 2–2. Two 5-minute overtime periods were unable to settle the score but did allow the forwards to finally show that they were worthy of their positions.\nAfter the winter break the team travelled to Springfield for a match with Yale. MIT gave the Elis all that they could handle and held back the Bulldogs offense. After Richards surrendered an early goal, the Engineer netminder refused entry and turned aside everything that Yale sent in his direction. Despite being outshot through most of the match, MIT found itself down by just a goal in the third and were able to tie the match before the end of regulation. Yale seemed to take the overtime session personally and their captain scored twice in the first few minutes to give them a commanding lead. The Engineers were able to get one into the Bulldog net but could not earn the second and fell to the Elis by a narrow margin. Though winless in their first three games, the Engineers had already shown an improving level of play and were chomping at the bit when they travelled west to face Army. The Cadets were no match for the Garnet and MIT easily won the game 7–0.\nThe team returned home for a rematch with BU and found themselves in another close battle. When the dust settled, however, MIT came out on top. A match at Dartmouth was postponed due to a lack of ice and left just the game against Boston College left before the exam break. MIT's defense was nigh-impenetrable with Berkeley and Crandall playing a masterful game on the blueline. Only one shot got past Richards but, due to the stellar defensive play from the Eagles, that was enough to sink the Engineers.\nA month later, the team was ready to play the match with Dartmouth, having moved the cite of the game to Boston. While MIT had been idle in the interim, the Indians were carrying a 5-game winning streak and flattened the Engineers 7–0. Afterwards, the team had nearly two weeks off before their final match with Brown. The Engineers practiced as much as they could before heading down to Rhode Island and facing the Bears. With White now in goal and Cullinan starting in place of Fahey, the team was enen more reliant on the defense and elder statesmen came through in the clutch. Brown was hardly able to get a shot on goal while MIT made the most of its scant opportunities. Cullinan, Duplin and Crandall each scored to give the team a 3–0 win and end the season on a high note.\nHerbert B. Whiting served as team manager with.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The St. Thomas Tommies men's ice hockey team was an ice hockey team representing the St. Thomas Tommies athletics program of St. Thomas University. The team was a member of the Atlantic University Sport conference and competed in U Sports. The program was discontinued in 2016 due to budget constraints.\nHistory.\nSt. Thomas fielded an ice hockey squad at last as early as 1916, however, the sparse records do not indicate whether or not this was a varsity team. The records for an official squad do not begin until the Tommies joined the Maritime Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1937. In the early years, the team found itself lagging behind its contemporaries, however, the team's situation changed after returning following World War II. St. Thomas steadily improved throughout the 1950s and won its first regular season title in '59. Two years later, the Tommies captured their first league championship.\nUnfortunately, the team was unable to sustain their success and began slipping down the standings afterwards. By the mid-70s, St. Thomas was playing so poorly that they won just 2 games over a 3-year span. The team suspended operations in 1975 but returned four years later, hoping that the time off could do them some good. For the first half of the 1980s, little appeared to have changed for the Tommies; the team routinely finished at the bottom of the standings and couldn't get a sniff of the postseason. The team was finally able to put together a winning season in 1986 and, three years later, made its first playoff appearance in nearly 20 years. That season saw the Tommies come achingly close to making their first appearance in the national tournament but a loss in the conference championship put those dreams on hold. Over the succeeding decade, the Tommies were mostly a mediocre team in their conference but they began to raise their level of play at the end of the 90s. After a few near misses, St. Thomas was finally able to win a second conference championship in 2001. The squad was quickly bounced from the national tournament, losing both round-robin games, and then finished last in the standings the following year.\nHopes were renewed in 2003 when St. Thomas won a regular season title but they were upset in the Semifinal round. The program declined afterwards, sinking to the bottom of the conference by 2010. Over a 7-year span, St. Thomas finished last every season save one and didn't make a single postseason appearance. With little hope on the horizon, the school's administration decided to end the program and invest the money elsewhere. At the time the team was running a deficit of approximately $250,000 per year with little to show for the price tag. Dawn Russell, the then-university president, reasoned that funding a competitive ice hockey team was beyond the means of the school.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSenior and collegiate play.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\"\nCollegiate only.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\"\nSee also.\nSt. Thomas (New Brunswick) Tommies women's ice hockey"

        "title": "2024 Alpine Skiing World Cup – Men's slalom",
        "text": "The men's slalom in the 2024 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of ten events, including the discipline final. Due to three prior cancellations in other disciplines, the first men's race of the entire season was the slalom held at Gurgl, Austria on 18 November 2023. The original season schedule called for 13 events, but during the season (as discussed below) three slaloms were canceled and not rescheduled. In an upset, Manuel Feller of Austria won his first career discipline title.\nSeason summary.\nOn 27 October 2023, two days before the scheduled opening of the men's World Cup season, Lucas Braathen, the 23-year-old Norwegian who was the defending champion in the slalom discipline, announced his retirement from professional Alpine skiing, as part of a dispute with the Norwegian ski federation over his individual commercial rights. The surprising aftermath of that decision was an Austrian podium sweep in Gurgl, the first race of the season, with Manuel Feller defeating Marco Schwarz and Michael Matt. The Austrian victory ended a streak of 17 slaloms without an Austrian victory, dating back to January 2022. However, the next scheduled race, in Val d'Isère on 10 December, was canceled due to a mix of overnight rain followed by new snow and high winds. When the second race was finally held in Madonna di Campiglio, Marco Schwarz won it, coming from sixth after the first run, and took over the season lead in both the discipline and the overall men's World Cup. By the next slalom, Schwarz had suffered a season-ending injury, but Feller won by .02 seconds to maintain the Austrian domination and also regain the overall lead for the season.\nIn the next two slaloms, at the downhill/slalom festivals in Wengen (SUI) and Kitzbühel (AUT), Feller won and then finished fourth (behind German Linus Straßer, who grew up and learned to ski at Kitzbühel), opening up an almost 200-point lead in the discipline. Straßer also won the night slalom at Schlamding, less than 100 miles away, four days later to move into second overall in the discipline for the season.\nThe next race, held in poor snow conditions in Chamonix, France after two prior races had already been canceled due to warm temperatures, featured a history-making comeback by Swiss slalom specialist Daniel Yule. Yule made a huge blunder on the first run and was the last of the 30 racers who qualified for the second run, meaning that he would start first, almost two seconds behind the leader; however, he put down a great second run and then sat in the leader's chair as all 29 remaining racers came down the increasingly melting and rutted course, with only two (his countryman Loïc Meillard and first-run leader Clément Noël of France) even managing to get within 0.3 of his total time, thus making Yule the first World Cup men's slalom skier ever to advance from 30th after the first run to 1st after the second run..The race in Bansko the next week was then canceled after 31 skiers had completed the first run, because visibility was compromised by fog while the course had deteriorated due to persistent heavy rain. \nThe following two races were held in the US, and Feller pulled off a come-from-behind triumph in the first (at Palisades Tahoe) to establish a 204-point lead over Straßer, who dropped from first to third on the second run, with just three races to go. When the slalom scheduled the next weekend in Kranjska Gora was canceled due to heavy rains, Feller clinched the season title over Straßer.\nFinals.\nThe World Cup discipline finals took place on Sunday, 17 March 2024, in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria. Only the top 25 in the slalom discipline ranking and the winner of the Junior World Championship were eligible to compete in the final, except that all skiers who have scored at least 500 points in the overall classification were eligible to compete in any discipline. Because of the reduced field size, only the top 15 finishers in the discipline final scored points. In the finals, no skier with at least 500 points who wasn't otherwise eligible chose to compete, and one skier who qualified (Schwarz) was injured, leaving 25 racers at the start.\nSince Feller and Straßer had already clinched the top two spots on the discipline podium, the only battle left was for third, and Timon Haugan of Norway jumped out to a big lead after the first run, then held off Feller, Straßer, and Meillard on the second run to claim that podium spot. However, the bigger news was that immediate past champion Lucas Braathen announced his \"un-retirement\" and return for the 2025 season, but now skiing for Brazil (his mother's homeland) instead of Norway, where he will have full control over his individual commercial rights."

        "text": "The Mount Allison Mounties men's ice hockey team was an ice hockey team representing the Mount Allison Mounties athletics program of Mount Allison University. The team was active from 1896 through 1998 before being dropped as a varsity sport.\nHistory.\nIn January 1896, Copp's Rink opened in Sackville, allowing ice hockey to come to Mount Allison for the first time. Prior to that, no athletic programs were active at the school during the winter months and, coincidentally, ice hockey swiftly became a favorite of the student body, The first intercollegiate game was played against Dalhousie in February of the following year and every winter the students looked forward to the start of the season. The faculty, on the other hand, were not fans. After the team had joined its first conference in 1905, the administrators felt that too much time was being devoted to the sport and decided to ban ice hockey in favor of basketball. A little over a month later, the university presidents of Acadia (who had also banned hockey) and Mount Allison learned that students from their respective campuses had taken it upon themselves to organize teams and play local teams despite the ban. With the schools powerless to stop the students, the ban was lifted and hockey resumed the following year.\nUpon their return, the Mounties welcomed the program's first head coach, Jack Twaddle. The team went on to win a pair of championships in 1914 with one being attended by over 1,000 spectators. World War I put the team on ice for a few years but the interest in the game seemed to have remained once Mount Allison returned in 1920. The team competed in both senior and intercollegiate leagues throughout the 20s and 30s and were one of the top teams in the maritimes, winning 6 championships in a 9-year stretch.\nWorld War II forced the team to stop playing for a time but they returned as soon as the fighting was over. After the war, Mount Allison sought to keep its spot as the best team of the region but they eventually found themselves slipping down the standings. After switching to a college-only schedule in 1955, was still able to compete against the top teams but by the 1960s they found themselves at the bottom of the standings. The program experienced a revival in the early 80s, winning two division titles, but that success was short-lived. The Mounties last appearance in the postseason was 1983 and, even after expanding to eight teams, Mount Allison failed to reach the paloyffs by finishing last every year after 1989. After nearly a decade of abject futility, the school had had enough. In 1998, citing a need to reallocate funds to other programs as well as gender equality necessities, Athletic Director Jack Drover terminated the ice hockey program.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSenior and collegiate play.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\"\nCollegiate only.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\"\nSee also.\nMount Allison Mounties women's ice hockey"

        "text": "The Blue Lake bobsleigh track (in Italian: \"pista di bob del Lago Blu\"; in French: \"piste de bobsleigh du Lac Bleu\") was a bobsleigh track located near the Blue Lake in Breuil-Cervinia, a hamlet of the municipality of Valtournenche in the Aosta Valley, Italy. Built in 1963, the track hosted numerous international bobsleigh events until its final closure in 1991. \nHistory.\nAfter the successes of the Italy national bobsleigh team on the Olympic track in Cortina d'Ampezzo (the only one existing in Italy at the time), a local committee for the construction of a bobsleigh track at Breuil was formed on 26 September 1959, composed mainly of Milanese fans.\nLuigino Gallia, owner of the Grand Hotel Cervinia, and former national team technical commissioner Botta entrusted the design of the track to engineer Luciano Galli, who was inspired by the most famous bobsleigh tracks of the time, including those in Cortina d'Ampezzo and Sankt Moritz. \nOn 12 April 12 1962, the promoting group was replaced by an executive committee, which was charged with approving the defined project, finding the financial resources (budgeted at 55 million liras) and contracting the construction work for the runway. Due to the opposition of a landowner, the project had to be modified: the construction work, carried out by the construction company Mario Dal Pont of Ponte nelle Alpi (Belluno) in the same year 1962 near the Blue Lake, was thus more difficult than planned, as some rocks had to be unearthed, increasing the final costs of the concrete structure. In total, the construction work amounted to 95.4 million liras, largely financed by contributions from the Aosta Valley Region, CONI and FISI. \nDuring the winter of 1962-1963 the bobsled track was given to the Cervino Company, which put it into operation with an operating expense of 11,535,021 liras. To make the natural icing of the slope, about thirty workers led by Luigi De Biaso of Voltago Agordino arrived from Agordino, who for a month accumulated a large quantity of snow, to be mixed with water and prepare the track by the plastering method, also finishing the concrete walls of the curves. At least fifteen track workers were needed for the daily maintenance of the slope, for the duration of the season from December to March. The first test descent was performed by Italian champion Eugenio Monti (known as the \"flying red\"), who used the bobsled with which he won the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo: it was an immediate success, recognized by sportsmen and fans.\nIn the summer of 1963, some construction defects were found, although it was not possible to complete all the investigations, following the Vajont Dam disaster, in which found death the parents of engineer Luciano Galli (who later became the president of the Vajont Survivors Committee). Moreover, on 31 October 1963, during a meeting in St. Vincent, the Dal Pont company pledged to fix the work at its own expense. In the winter of 1963-1964 the slope remained closed, due to the collapse of a curve.\nDuring these years, the Italian Air Force opened a \"bobsleigh school\" in Cervinia, renamed in 1965 as the \"Armed Forces Bobsleigh School,\" to train pilots, interns and brakemen.\nAfter restoration work, the bobsled track was officially inaugurated in 1966, with a grand ceremony in the presence of the authorities, including Leo Gasperl (founder of the Matterhorn Ski School), Luigi Cravetto (Matterhorn Ropeway Company) and Piero Oneglio (president of the Italian Winter Sports Federation), as well as famous personalities.\nThe Cervinia track fostered the development of the sport, also highlighting several champions from the Aosta Valley: Maurizio Compagnoni, Gianni Bonichon (silver medalist at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo) and Franco Perruquet (gold medalist in the two-man bobsleigh at the 1975 World Bobsleigh Championships, organized on this track).\nThe Cervinia track hosted many international competitions, including 4 world championships, 4 European championships and 17 Italian championships, as well as several stages of the FIBT World Cup.\nIn 1991 the Blue Lake bobsled track was included in Aosta's bid to organize the 1998 Winter Olympics (later awarded to the Japanese city of Nagano). In the same year, the city of Cervinia again obtained the organization of the 1993 World Bobsleigh Championships, but the excessive costs budgeted for the track's refurbishment decreed the event's renunciation (deliberated on 16 September 1992) and the final closure of the bobsleigh track. In the 2000s, after the 2006 Winter Olympics were awarded to Turin, there was a hypothesis of recovering the old Lac Bleu slope: the Valle d'Aosta Region commissioned a feasibility study to restore, bring up to standard and arrange the slope, which estimated an expense of about two billion liras, as well as an annual management cost of about one billion liras against a possible revenue of 480 million liras. In any case, the organizing committee then decided to build the new Olympic track at Cesana Pariol, which cost 110 million euros and then closed after six years.\nTechnical features.\nThe length of the icy track was , with 18 curves (some of which were 6-7 meters high) and an elevation difference of 139 meters, an average slope of 9.34 percent and a maximum slope of 13.19 percent, which allowed the racecars to reach speeds of up to 140 km/h."

        "text": "The torch relay of the 1959 Pan American Games was held between July 25 to August 27, 1959, culminating in the Games' opening ceremony at Soldier Field in Chicago, Illinois, USA. \nThe torch was lit on July 25 at Cerro de la Estrella in Mexico City. It was carried across Mexico by members of the Asociación de Scouts de México, reaching the U.S.–Mexican border at Nuevo Laredo and Laredo, Texas on August 4. From there, the torch was carried across the United States to Chicago by members of the Boy Scouts of America. An estimated 3,000 Boy Scouts took part in the relay, each carrying the torch for one \"Scout's Pace\": 50 paces running followed by 50 steps walking. The torch run was conducted during daylight hours, and each night the torch was put on display.\nIn McAlester, Oklahoma, a local youth stole the torch and threw it in a ditch. The torch itself was damaged, but the relay continued as scheduled the next day. In Alton, Illinois, a support car slipped off an embankment into the Mississippi River. The car was carrying the base on which the torch was to sit overnight, as well as letters of congratulation from city officials along the relay route, which were lost in the incident.\nThe torch itself was symbolic: instead of a burning flame, the \"Atomic Torch\" consisted of a blue lightbulb surrounded by a chromium-plated model of an atom. The torch was designed by staff at Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago. Upon arrival at Soldier Field, the torch was connected to a string of cesium-137 pellets, which gave off radioactive impulses that were converted into an electrical signal, triggering the lighting of the Friendship Flame cauldron."

        "title": "Victoria Cruising Club Rugby League Club",
        "text": "The Victoria Cruising Club Rugby League Club was a rugby league club in Auckland, New Zealand which existed for one season in 1923. They fielded one team which competed in the Auckland Rugby League 3rd grade. They were in fact a yachting club founded in 1903 which still exists and is based at the present day Westhaven Marina adjacent to the southern end of the Auckland Harbour Bridge.\nHistory.\n1923 formation.\nRelatively little was reported on the club during their lone season in the Auckland Rugby League competition aside from their fixtures which were published weekly in the Auckland Star and New Zealand Herald. On April 30 they published a notice in the Auckland Star requesting members to meet for training that night (Monday) at Victoria Park. The notice was posted by their honorary secretary George Mobberley who was also the secretary of the yachting club. It is unknown what their colours were though the yachting clubs colours are red, black, and gold.\n1923 season.\nThe Victoria Cruising Club played 11 matches in the 14 team 3rd grade competition. Only 4 of their results were actually reported, with 3 wins and 1 loss though other leading teams point totals were published later in the season indicating that Victoria lost at least 5 matches. The standings are incomplete but it is likely they finished mid table, well behind the leading teams with the grade won by Ponsonby United. Their first ever match was against Richmond Rovers on May 5 at their opponents Grey Lynn ground at 3pm and was refereed by Mr. J. Clark. Surprisingly Victoria won the match by default as Richmond were ultimately one of the stronger teams in the competition. However it was reported later that the Richmond club had defaulted all of their opening round lower grade matches in protest at the allocation of grounds. The Victoria Cruising Club's team for there opening match was published in the Auckland Star and was: Dodds, Sharp, Cawley/Cowley, Dunn, Archer, Roman, Daw, Bennett (2), Miller, Shannon, Clark, Riley, Barwell/Barnwell, and Clauson.\nTheir first match which was actually played was against the Parnell club on May 12 at 3pm on the Auckland Domain. The match was refereed by the experienced first grade and representative referee Frank Thompson. They won the match by 2 points to 0. They then beat Coromandel Old Boys at Victoria Park by 8 points to 2.\nThey then played City Rovers on May 26 with test referee Les Bull in charge at the Auckland Domain on the #1 field. The result of the match was not reported though from standings reported later in the season it is evident that they lost the game. They then played against North Shore Albions, known as Devonport United at this time following a merger with Sunnyside a few years earlier. The match was at Devonport on June 9. A week later they played Manukau Rovers at Manukau (Waikaraka Park). An notice was published in the newspaper requesting their players to meet at the corner of Hobson and Victoria Street at 1:45 for a bus to take them to the venue. They lost by 14 points to 3 with their team list published prior to the game. It was to be the last time that their team names were published and the side included: Manley, Sharp, Doonan, White, Sprott, Dords, Cawley, Clawson, Bennett, Shannon, Clark, Barwell, Dunn, Miller, Graydon, Hickson, and Hawks.\nTheir remaining matches were against Kingsland Rovers at Walker Park in Point Chevalier on June 23, Ponsonby United at Māngere on July 7, Ihumātao at the Ellerslie Racecourse on July 14, Point Chevalier at their ground on July 28, and then their last match against Richmond Rovers at Victoria Park on August 18. None of the results of these games was reported though it is likely they lost to Point Chevalier, Ponsonby, and Richmond. Kingsland and Ihumatao had both struggled with no known wins during the season so the Victoria side may have recorded victories in these games. The club did not meet again in a rugby league capacity and they fielded no teams in the 1924.\nPlaying records.\nThe results are incomplete. The \"New Zealand Herald\" and \"Auckland Star\" published the fixture list each week with details, but results were only sent to the newspapers sporadically during the season, so these records have been compiled from the known results."

        "text": "Jim Kevin \"Jimmy\" Ellis (born March 25, 1964, in Redondo Beach, California) is an American former professional football player in the National Football league (NFL) with the Los Angeles Raiders. He is also a former professional boxer who fought in the Heavyweight division.\nAmerican football.\nHe moved to Boise, Idaho after graduation from Redondo Union High School. In Boise, he played American football for the Boise State Broncos football team at Boise State University. Weighing 237 pounds and listed at 6 feet, 2 inches tall, Ellis played from 1983 to 1986, returning five interceptions for a total of 63 yards.\nHe was drafted by the Los Angeles Raiders in 1987 and played three games during a season that was affected by a strike. He did not achieve any stats in those three games. He was one of the replacement players.\nProfessional boxing.\nEllis decided to try a professional boxing career, and, on Tuesday, February 21, 1989, at the Central Plaza Hotel in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, he debuted against Howard Nero, who had lost all three of his previous bouts. Ellis won that fight by a first-round knockout.\nEllis had a promising start into professional boxing, building a record of 16 wins, 0 losses and 1 draw (tie) in his first 17 tests, with 15 wins by knockout, a record which demonstrated he was a boxer with considerable skills and hard punching power. However, for fight number 18, he would face the legendary, comebacking former and future world heavyweight champion, George Foreman, whose record was of 68 wins and 3 losses, with 64 wins by knockout. There were many skeptics as far as Ellis' ability to beat Foreman before the bout; nevertheless, Foreman commented about his rival with respect prior to their facing off, in this contest of hard hitting heavyweight boxers. Their fight took place on Saturday, December 7, 1991, at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno, Nevada, as part of an HBO Boxing televised event headlined by an IBF vacant world junior welterweight championship fight between American former two-time world champion Roger Mayweather and Colombian rival Rafael Pineda (won by Pineda by ninth-round knockout). Foreman was just coming off an unsuccessful but inspired effort in losing to Evander Holyfield for the world heavyweight title in his previous contest. Foreman-Ellis was officiated by referee Richard Steele and promoted by Bob Arum. Foreman won the contest by a third-round technical knockout.\nEllis' boxing career zigzagged from that point on; he only won four of his last eight contests. However, two notable wins took place, one over former WBA world cruiserweight title challenger, Eddie Taylor, 31 wins, 15 losses and 1 draw before their fight, a 5th-round knockout win on Friday, October 16, 1992, in Boise. Taylor had faced the likes of Ossie Ocasio (in his world title challenge), Marvin Camel, Rickey Parkey, Dwight Muhammad Qawi and Lee Roy Murphy in his career; he was on a seven-fight losing streak when he faced Ellis.\nThe other one was against former WBA world heavyweight champion Tony Tubbs. Tubbs had 34 wins and 4 losses when this contest took place at the Boise Center on Monday, August 16, 1993. Ellis won the fight by a 22-seconds, first-round knockout for arguably the biggest win of his career.\nIn his last professional boxing contest, Ellis faced future WBO and linear world heavyweight champion Shannon Briggs, who was undefeated in 16 bouts coming into their Saturday, March 12, 1994, match at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. Briggs won the six-rounds contest by a first-round knockout, causing Ellis to decide to retire.\nBoxing record.\nEllis had a record of 20 wins, 5 losses and 1 draw (tie) in 26 professional boxing contests, with 19 of those wins and 4 of those losses coming by knockout or technical knockout.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1995, Ellis began working in the insurance industry. He joined Bankers Life in 2022. His page at that company's website states that he enjoys fishing at the Boise River. He has been married to his wife, Carrie Ellis, for more than 30 years, and has 4 daughters with her as well as 12 grandchildren."

        "text": "The Osceola team was a minor league baseball team based in Osceola, Iowa. \nIn 1903, the \"Osceola\" club played as members of the short–lived Class D level Southwest Iowa League, joining the league in mid–season as an expansion team. Osceola won an informal championship series following the conclusion of the 1903 league season.\nHistory.\nIn 1903 Osceola, Iowa first hosted minor league baseball when the \"Osceola\" team became members of the Southwest Iowa League during the season. The team was without a known nickname, common in the era. which began play on May 29, 1903. The members of the six–team Class D level Southwest Iowa League to begin the season were the Atlantic, Clarinda, Red Oak Blue Indians and Shenandoah teams, as the league began play on May 29, 1903, without an Osceola team.\nOn March 25, 1903, the Southwest Iowa League was formed at a league meeting. E.H. Whiteside, of Atlantic, Iowa was elected league president and a $400 monthly salary limit was established for league teams. The league began play with four Iowa teams in Atlantic, Clarinda, Shenandoah and Red Oak as the charter member franchises. The league disallowed playing games on Sundays. The cities of Glenwood, Iowa and Malvern, Iowa were unable to raise the necessary funds required for a league franchise.\nAfter the Southwest Iowa League opened league play, Creston, Iowa formed a local team and played numerous exhibition games against league member teams. At the June 25, 1903, Southwest Iowa League meeting, Creston was awarded membership in the league and Osceola also was awarded a team, with the two new franchises expanding the league to six teams. Osceola had formed a team just weeks earlier. On June 29, 1903, Osceola and the Creston Cyclones teams began play in the league.\nAfter beginning play in the Southwest Iowa League on June 29, an Osceola game against Atlantic was protested by Atlantic.\nOn August 29, 1903, the Southwest Iowa League folded after the Creston franchise dissolved. The First place Shenandoah team had folded July 18, 1903, leaving the league with four teams. After Nebraska City, Nebraska refused an offer to replace Shenandoah, the league considered dropping Osceola, as the team had a record of 1–11, but the league allowed Osceola to continue play. Eventually, Osceola had compiled an 18–29 record when the league ended the season on August 29, 1903. The fourth place Osceola team finished 11.0 games behind first place Atlantic in the final standings.\nAfter the league had folded, the Creston and Osceola teams continued play. The two teams organized and played a winner-take-all post-season series for a $1,500 purse. Osceola then defeated Creston in five consecutive games to win the purse.\nThe Southwest Iowa League never reformed as a minor league. Osceola has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe name of the Osceola home minor league ballpark is not directly referenced. It is known that Osceola and the Creston Cyclones played games against each other in the neutral town of Afton, Iowa."

The tournament took place on three dates between March 6 and 12, 2024, and all tournament games were played in the home arenas of the higher-seeded school. The winner, Wagner, received the conference's automatic bid to the 2024 NCAA tournament.\nMerrimack was the defending champion. Due to Merrimack's ineligibility as a team transitioning from Division II, Fairleigh Dickinson represented the conference in the 2023 NCAA tournament and advanced to the second round.\nSeeds.\nThe top eight teams in the conference regular-season standings qualified. Effective for the 2023–24 academic year, NEC teams transitioning from Division II are eligible for the NEC tournament during the entirety of their transition periods. If a reclassifying institution wins the NEC tournament championship, the tournament runner-up will be awarded the NEC's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. If two reclassifying teams reach the final of the NEC tournament, the conference will stage an automatic qualifier game between the two non-advancing semifinalists. Previously, transitioning NEC teams were eligible for the conference tournament only during their third and fourth transition years. The rule change results in Stonehill and Le Moyne being eligible for the 2024 NEC tournament, since Stonehill is in its second transition year, and Le Moyne is in its first.\nTeams were seeded by record within the conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records.\nTournament notes.\nQuarterfinals.\nTop-seeded Central Connecticut found themselves trailing Saint Francis by as many as eight points at 54–46, before going on an 8–0 run to tie the score at 57. Moments later, a three-pointer by Jordan Jones, who finished with 18 points, gave the Blue Devils a 60–59 lead. After several lead changes, a jump shot by Jones gave Central Connecticut the lead for good with 3:29 to play. Allan Jeanne-Rose had a career-high 28 points and added five rebounds for the Blue Devils. Eli Wilborn scored 19 points and had six rebounds for the Red Flash.\nMerrimack survived a difficult test from LIU in the NEC quarterfinals, securing a 72–66 victory to advance. The game remained close throughout, until the Warriors went on a 9–0 run to take a 10-point lead with less than four minutes to play and seemingly put the game away. However, the Sharks battled back and got within a point of the lead in the final minute. Merrimack iced the game at the free-throw line and by clamping down on defense in the closing minute. For the game, the Warriors forced 18 turnovers, leading to 27 points. Jordan Derkack had his third double-double of the season for Merrimack with 23 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and three steals. Adam \"Budd\" Clark added 18 points for the Warriors. Tai Strickland and Andre Washington each had 18 points and two steals for LIU.\nTahron Allen's go-ahead layup with 46 seconds remaining fueled Wagner to a 60–57 upset victory at Sacred Heart. The game was close throughout, and neither team led by more than three points during the final 11:13. After a pair of free throws by Melvin Council Jr. gave the Seahawks a three-point lead in the closing seconds, and the Pioneers' three-point attempt at the buzzer was off the mark. Wagner held the lead for 35:03. Allen led Wagner with 22 points and added six rebounds. Alex Sobel had 15 points, 11 rebounds and two blocked shots for Sacred Heart. The Seahawks were the first road team to win an NEC quarterfinal game since 2019.\nPowered by Luke Sutherland's 22 points, Le Moyne cruised to an 82–61 wire-to-wire victory over Fairleigh Dickinson. The Dolphins opened the game with three three-pointers to take a 9–0 lead just 1:45 into the contest. The Knights settled down, and Le Moyne was up, 42–34, at intermission. Leading 46–40 in the second half, the Dolphins went on an 11–0 run over 2:09 to take a 57–40 lead with 15:42 remaining. Fairleigh Dickinson got no closer than 12 points behind the rest of the way. Darrick Jones Jr. scored 17 points for Le Moyne. Sean Moore scored 16 points and added eight rebounds and two steals for the Knights.\nSemifinals.\nAfter Le Moyne jumped out to an early 13–4 lead, Merrimack's defense got the Warriors back into the game, and a 19–3 run in the later part of the first half helped them build a 28–20 lead at intermission. The Dolphins cut the deficit to three with 14:47 to play on a put-back by Kaiyem Cleary. The teams traded three-pointers over the next three minutes, until Samba Diallo's layups on consecutive possessions extended Merrimack's lead to seven points. The Dolphins responded with a 6–2 run to get within three points at 40–37 with 8:14 to play. An 8–2 Warriors run gave them a nine-point lead with 6:45 on the clock, but Le Moyne responded with a pair of three-pointers by Luke Sutherland to pull within three again with 5:42 to play. After each team had two empty possessions over the next two minutes, Bryan Etumnu was fouled on a layup and completed the three-point play, sparking a 9–2 Merrimack run that put the game away. The Warriors' 61–51 victory put them in the NEC tournament final for the second straight year. Adam \"Budd\" Clark scored 24 points to lead Merrimack. Sutherland had 23 points and eight rebounds for Le Moyne.\nJulian Brown scored 20 points to lead Wagner past top-seeded Central Connecticut, 66–56. After the Seahawks took a 28–23 halftime lead, the Blue Devils battled back and tied the game at 39 with 9:06 remaining, but Central Connecticut was never able to pull in front. After the Blue Devils got within 48–45, Melvin Council Jr., who finished with 12 points, scored the next two baskets to extend Wagner's lead to seven points with 2:57 on the clock. Javier Ezquerra scored to give the Seahawks a 54–48 lead with 2:23 to play. After a Jordan Jones three-pointer got the Blue Devils within five points at 61–56, the Seahawks, who were down to five dressed players after Council and Keyontae Lewis fouled out, went 5 for 6 from the free-throw line in the final 30 seconds to ice the game. Lewis scored 12 points and added nine rebounds for Wagner. Jones had 15 points for Central Connecticut.\nFinal.\nWagner became the first team to win three road games and take the NEC tournament title and, as the no. 6 seed, matched the lowest seeded team to ever capture the NEC crown with a 54–47 victory at Merrimack. Tournament MVP Tahron Allen scored 22 points for the Seahawks and gave them an 11-point lead at 41–30 with his three-pointer with 12:38 to play. The Warriors responded with a 13–0 run, keyed by two Jordan McCoy three-pointers and capped by Bryan Etumnu's three-pointer, to take a 43–41 lead with 8:07 to play. With the sellout crowd in a frenzy, Wagner answered by holding Merrimack scoreless over the next six minutes while scoring eight points to take a 49–43 lead with 2:18 to play. After Allen's free throws put the Seahawks up, 51–45, with 1:10 on the clock, the Warriors' three-point attempts were all off the mark. McCoy hit a pair of free throws with 25 seconds to go to bring Merrimack within four points, but Javier Ezquerra sank a pair of charity tosses four seconds later to ice the game. Melvin Council Jr. had 12 points, and Keyontae Lewis scored eight points and pulled down 12 rebounds for the Seahawks. Devon Savage had 16 points and six rebounds for the Warriors, and McCoy added 11 points. NEC Player of the Year, Jordan Derkack, played through an injury he suffered in Merrimack's semifinal game but was held to only four points. Merrimack was held to just one field goal over the final 8:07 and shot 30% from the floor, including 16% (10 for 38) from beyond the arc.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=BracketGraphic /&gt;Teams were reseeded after each round with highest remaining seeds receiving home-court advantage.\n&lt;section end=BracketGraphic /&gt;\nAwards and honors.\n\"Source:\" \nTournament MVP: Tahron Allen, Wagner"

        "title": "History of the America's Cup",
        "text": "The America's Cup is the oldest international competition still operating in any sport.\nThe cup was originally known as the 'R.Y.S. £100 Cup', awarded in 1851 by the British Royal Yacht Squadron for a race around the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. The winning yacht was a schooner called \"America\", owned by a syndicate of members from the New York Yacht Club (NYYC). In 1857, the syndicate permanently donated the trophy to the NYYC, under a Deed of Gift that renamed the trophy as the 'America's Cup' after the first winner and required it be made available for perpetual international competition.\nFrom the first defence of the cup in 1870 until the twentieth defence in 1967, there was always only one challenger. In 1970 multiple challengers applied, so a selection series was held to decide which applicant would become the official challenger and compete in the America's Cup match. This approach has been used for each subsequent competition. The trophy was held by the NYYC from 1857 until 1983. The NYYC successfully defended the trophy twenty-four times in a row before being defeated by the Royal Perth Yacht Club, represented by the yacht \"Australia II\". Including the original 1851 victory, the NYYC's 132-year reign was the longest (in terms of time) winning streak in any sport.\nEarly matches for the cup were raced between yachts on the waterline owned by wealthy sportsmen. This culminated with the J-Class regattas of the 1930s. After World War II and almost twenty years without a challenge, the NYYC made changes to the deed of gift to allow smaller, less expensive 12-metre class yachts to compete; this class was used from 1958 until 1987. It was replaced in 1990 by the International America's Cup Class, which was used until 2007. After a long legal battle, the 2010 America's Cup was raced in waterline multihull yachts in Valencia, Spain. The victorious Golden Gate Yacht Club then elected to race the 2013 America's Cup in AC72 foiling, wing-sail catamarans and successfully defended the cup. The 2017 America's Cup match was sailed in foiling catamarans, after legal battles and disputes over the rule changes.\nOrigins.\nThe America's Cup is the oldest competition in international sport, and the fourth oldest continuous sporting trophy of any kind. The cup itself was manufactured in 1848 and first called the \"RYS £100 Cup\". It was first raced for on 22 August 1851 around the Isle of Wight off Southampton and Portsmouth in Hampshire, England, in a fleet race between the New York Yacht Club's \"America\" and 15 yachts of the Royal Yacht Squadron. The race was witnessed by Queen Victoria and the future Edward VII and won by \"America\". This is considered to be the first America's Cup race.\nOn 8 July 1857, the surviving members of the \"America\" syndicate donated the cup to the New York Yacht Club via the Deed of Gift of the America's Cup filed with the New York Supreme Court. The deed is the primary instrument that governs the rules to make a valid challenge for the America's Cup and the rules of conduct of the races. It states that the cup \"is donated upon the condition that it shall be preserved as a perpetual challenge Cup for friendly competition between foreign countries\", outlines how a foreign yacht club can make a challenge to the holder of the cup and what happens if they do not agree on how the match should be conducted. The deed makes it \"distinctly understood that the cup is to be the property of the club [that has most recently won a match for the cup], subject to the provisions of this deed, and not the property of the owner or owners of any vessel winning a match\".\n1851: \"America\" wins the Cup.\nIn 1851 Commodore John Cox Stevens, a charter member of the fledgling New York Yacht Club (NYYC), formed a six-person syndicate to build a yacht with intention of taking her to England and making some money competing in yachting regattas and match races. The syndicate contracted with pilot boat designer George Steers for a schooner, which was christened \"America\" and launched on 3 May 1851.\nOn 22 August 1851, \"America\" raced against 15 yachts of the Royal Yacht Squadron in the club's annual regatta around the Isle of Wight. \"America\" won, finishing 8 minutes ahead of the closest rival. Apocryphally, Queen Victoria, who was watching at the finish line, was reported to have asked who was second, the famous answer being: \"Ah, Your Majesty, there is no second.\"\nThe surviving members of the \"America\" syndicate donated the cup via the Deed of Gift of the America's Cup to the NYYC on 8 July 1857, specifying that it be held in trust as a perpetual challenge trophy to promote friendly competition among nations.\n1870–1881: First challenges.\nNo challenge to race for the Cup was issued until British railway tycoon James Lloyd Ashbury's topsail schooner \"Cambria\" (188 tons, 1868 design) beat the Yankee schooner \"Sappho\" (274.4 tons, 1867 design) in the Solent in 1868. This success encouraged the Royal Thames Yacht Club in believing that the cup could be brought back home, and officially placed the first challenge in 1870. Ashbury entered \"Cambria\" in the NYYC Queen's Cup race in New York City on 8 August against a fleet of seventeen schooners, with time allowed based on their tonnage. The \"Cambria\" only placed eighth, behind the aging \"America\" (178.6 tons, 1851) in fourth place and Franklin Osgood's \"\" (92.2 tons, 1857) in the fleet's lead.\nTrying again, Ashbury offered a best-of-seven match race challenge for October 1871, which the NYYC accepted provided a defending yacht could be chosen on the morning of each race. Ashbury's new yacht \"Livonia\" (264 tons) was beaten twice in a row by Osgood's new centreboard schooner \"Columbia\" (220 tons), which withdrew in the third race after dismasting. The yacht \"Sappho\" then stepped in as defender to win the fourth and fifth races, thereby successfully defending the cup. Although the event ended in acrimony, Ashbury was the catalyst for the introduction of greater fairness in no longer allowing the defender to use multiple yachts against a single challenger.\nThe next challenge, in 1876 from the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, was the first to be disputed between two yachts only. The schooner \"Madeleine\" (148.2 tons, 1868), a previous defender from the 1870 fleet race, easily defeated the challenger \"Countess of Dufferin\" (221 tons, 1876 design by Alexander Cuthbert). Cuthbert filed the second Canadian challenge, bankrolling, designing and sailing the first sloop challenge for the America's Cup in 1881. The small Canadian challenger \"Atalanta\" (84 tons, 1881), representing the Bay of Quinte Yacht Club, suffered from lack of funds, unfinished build and a difficult delivery through the Erie Canal from Lake Ontario to New York. In contrast, the NYYC cautiously prepared its first selection trials. The iron sloop \"Mischief\" (79 tons, 1879 design by Archibald Cary Smith) was chosen from four sloop candidates and successfully defended the cup.\n1885–1887: The NYYC Rule.\nIn response to the unsuccessful Canadian challenges, the in 1881 to require that challenges be accepted only from yacht clubs on the sea. The Deed was further amended to provide that challenger yachts must sail to the venue on their own hull. Furthermore, Archibald Cary Smith and the NYYC committee devised a new rating rule that would govern the next races. They included sail area and waterline length into the handicap, with penalties on waterlines longer than . Irish yacht designer John Beavor-Webb launched the challengers \"Genesta\" (1884) and \"Galatea\" (1885), which would define the British \"plank-on-edge\" design of a heavy, deep and narrow-keel hull, making for very stiff yachts ideal for the British breeze. The boats came to New York in 1885 and 1886 respectively, but neither would best the sloops \"Puritan\" or \"Mayflower\", whose success in selection trials against many other candidates proved Boston designer Edward Burgess was the master of the \"compromise sloop\" (lightweight, wide and shallow hull with centerboard). This design paradigm proved ideal for the light Yankee airs.\nIn 1887, Edward Burgess repeated his success with the \"Volunteer\" against Scottish yacht designer George Lennox Watson's challenger \"Thistle\", which was built in secret. Even when the \"Thistle\" was drydocked in New York before the races, her hull was draped to protect the secret of her lines, which borrowed from American design. Both \"Volunteer\" and \"Thistle\" were completely unfurnished below decks to save weight.\n1889–1903: The Seawanhaka Rule.\nIn 1887, the NYYC adopted the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club's rating rule, in which Bristol, RI, naval architect Nathanael Herreshoff found loopholes that he would use to make dramatic improvements in yacht design and to shape the America's Cup's largest and most extreme contenders. Both Herreshoff and Watson proceeded to merge Yankee sloop design and British cutter design to make very deep S-shape fin-keeled hulls. Using steel, tobin bronze, aluminium, and even nickel for novel construction, they significantly lengthened bow and stern overhangs, further extending the sailing waterline as their boats heeled over, thus increasing their hull speed.\nThe next America's Cup challenge was initially limited to waterline in 1889, but the mutual-agreement clauses of a new 1887 Deed of Gift caused the Royal Yacht Squadron to withdraw the Earl of Dunraven's promising Watson designed challenger \"Valkyrie\" while she was crossing the Atlantic. Dunraven challenged again in 1893, pleading for a return to the longer limit. In a cup-crazed Britain, its four largest cutters ever were being built, including Watson's \"Valkyrie II\" for Dunraven's challenge. Meanwhile, the NYYC's wealthiest members ordered two cup candidates from Herreshoff, and two more from Boston yacht designers. Charles Oliver Iselin, who was running the syndicate behind one of the Herreshoff designs called \"Vigilant\", gave the naval architect leave to design the yacht entirely as he willed. Herreshoff helmed \"Vigilant\" himself and beat all his rivals in selection trials, and defended the cup successfully from \"Valkyrie II\".\nUrged to challenge again in yet larger boat sizes, Dunraven challenged again in 1895 with a waterline limit. The Watson designed challenger \"Valkyrie III\" received many innovations: She would be wider than the defender, and featured the first steel mast. The NYYC ordered another defender from Herreshoff, which he had built in a closed off hangar and launched at night so as to conceal her construction: \"Defender\" used an aluminium topside riveted to steel frames and manganese bronze below waters. This saved 17 tons of displacement, but later subjected the boat to extreme electrolysis after the Cup races. \"Valkyrie III\" lost the first race, was deemed disqualified in the second race following a collision with \"Defender\" before the start line despite finishing first, and in turn withdrew from the contest. The unraveling of the races left Dunraven in a bitter disagreement with all parties over fairness of the cup committee concerning claims. After he asserted that he had been cheated, his honorary membership of the NYYC was revoked. Henry \"Hank\" Coleman Haff, was inducted into America's Cup Hall of Fame in 2004 for his sailing of \"Defender\" in 1895 and bringing the cup back. At age 58, Hank Haff was the oldest cup winner in the history of the race.\nThe climate was estranged until Scottish businessman Sir Thomas Lipton became the financial backer for the Royal Ulster Yacht Club's 1899 challenge. William Fife was chosen to design the challenging yacht \"Shamrock\" because of past success in American waters. The yachts increased yet again in size, and this time Herreshoff fitted a telescopic steel mast to his defender \"Columbia\", but his largest contribution was to recruit Scottish-American skipper Charlie Barr. The latter had helmed Fife designs in Yankee waters before, and he had shown perfect coordination with his hand-picked Scandinavian crew. Barr successfully helmed \"Columbia\" to victory, and Lipton's noted fair play provided unprecedented popular appeal to the sport and to his tea brand.\nAlthough upset with the \"Shamrock\", Lipton challenged again in 1901, turning this time to George Lennox Watson for a \"cup-lifter\": \"Shamrock II\", Watson's fourth and final challenger, was the first cup contender to be thoroughly tank-tested. To defend the Cup, businessman Thomas W. Lawson funded for Boston designer Bowdoin B. Crowninshield a daring project: his yacht \"Independence\" was capable of unrivaled performance because of her extremely long sailing waterline, but she was largely overpowered and unbalanced and suffered from structural issues. Furthermore, Lawson's failure to commit to the NYYC's terms for defending the Cup defaulted the \"Independence\"ʼs elimination. Herreshoff had again received a commission from the NYYC, but had failed to secure Charlie Barr to skipper his new yacht \"Constitution\". Instead, the \"Columbia\"ʼs syndicate kept Barr's crew and tried another defense. Unexpectedly, Barr led the \"Columbia\"ʼs crew to win the selection trials, and to successfully defend the cup again.\nLipton persisted in a third challenge in 1903. With the aim to fend off Lipton's challenges indefinitely, the NYYC garnered a huge budget for a single cup contender, whose design would be commissioned to Herreshoff again. Improving on the \"Independence\" and his previous designs, the new defender \"Reliance\" remains the largest race sloop ever built. She featured a ballasted rudder, dual-speed winches below decks, and a cork-decked aluminium topside that hid running rigging. The design focus on balance was exemplary, but the extreme yacht also required the skills of an excellent skipper, which defaulted choice options to Charlie Barr. Facing the equally bold challenger \"Shamrock III\", Barr led the \"Reliance\" to victory in just three races.\n1914–1937: The Universal Rule.\nDespite the immense success of the \"Reliance\", she was used only one season, her design and maintenance keeping her from being used for any other purpose than for a cup defense. The extremity of both 1903 cup contenders encouraged Nathanael Herreshoff to make boats more wholesome and durable by devising a new rule. Proposing in the same year the Universal Rule, he added the elements of overall length and displacement into the rating, to the benefit of heavy, voluminous hulls and also divided boats into classes, without handicapping sail area. This went against the American Yacht Clubs' and the British Yacht Racing Association's general desire to promote speed at all costs for cup boats, but the NYYC adopted Herreshoff's proposal. Lipton long pleaded for a smaller size of yachts in the new rule, and the NYYC conceded to seventy-five footers in 1914. Lipton turned to Charles Ernest Nicholson for his fourth challenge, and got a superb design under the inauspicious shape of \"Shamrock IV\", with a flat transom. She was the most powerful yacht that year, and the NYYC turned out three cup candidates to defend the cup: of George Owen's \"Defiance\" and William Gardner's \"Vanitie\", it was Herreshoff who designed the wisest of all contenders. His last design for the cup, the \"Resolute\", was small, which earned significant time allowance over other yachts. Barr had died, but his crew manned the \"Resolute\", which faced stiff competition from \"Vanitie\", but went on to win the selection trials, before the Cup was suspended as World War I broke out.\nShamrock IV was crossing the Atlantic with the steam yacht Erin, destined for the British Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, when Britain declared war on Germany on 5 August 1914. Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, the Commodore of the New York Yacht Club, had sent his own yacht, the Vagrant, from Rhode Island to Bermuda to meet them and escort them to the US. The Vagrant arrived on the 8th. Having no radio, the crew remained unaware of the declaration of war. Finding all navigational markers missing, the Vagrant crew attempted to pick their own way in through the barrier reef. St. David's Battery fired a warning shot to bring them to a halt. Shamrock IV and Erin arrived the next day. The America's Cup was cancelled for that year.\nThe Shamrock IV and Erin proceeded to New York, from where the Erin returned to Britain while Shamrock IV was laid up in the Erie Basin dry dock until 1920, when she received some adjustments to her build and ballast, just before the races were held. Despite \"Shamrock IV\"s severe rating, she took the first two races from the defender \"Resolute\", and came closer to winning back the Cup than any previous challenger. The \"Resolute\" won every subsequent race of the event.\n\"Shamrock IV\" was never raced again, but the universal rule drew significant appeal, especially in the small M-Class. Believing that the new rule offered a serious opportunity for the British to take the Cup, Lipton challenged for the fifth and last time at age 79, in 1929. The J-Class was chosen for the contest, to which were added Lloyds' A1 scantling rules in order to ensure that the yachts would be seaworthy and evenly matched, given the Deed of Gift requirement for yachts to sail to the match on their \"own bottom.\" The waterline length was set between and , and there would be no time allowance. Novel rigging technology now permitted the Bermuda rig to replace the gaff rig. Nicholson was chosen to design challenger \"Shamrock V\", and despite the Wall Street Crash, four NYYC syndicates responded to the threat and built a cup contender each. The venue was moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where, the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company's new naval architect Starling Burgess used his success in the M-Class and his experience as a wartime plane designer to build the Vanderbilt syndicate's defender \"Enterprise\", the smallest J-Class. Meanwhile, Herreshoff's son, L. Francis Herreshoff, designed a radical boat: The \"Whirlwind\", despite being the most advanced boat with her double-ended \"canoe\" build and electronic instruments, maneuvered too clumsily. The old 75-footers \"Resolute\" and \"Vanitie\" were rebuilt and converted to the J-Class to serve as trial horses. The \"Enterprise\"s skipper Harold Vanderbilt won the selection trials with great difficulty. When \"Shamrock V\" was revealed, she was an outdated wooden boat with a wooden mast and performed poorly to windward. \"Enterprise\" was then fitted with the world's first duralumin mast, very lightweight at , and beat her opponent soundly.\nLipton died in 1931, and English aviation industrialist Sir Thomas Sopwith bought \"Shamrock V\" with the intent of preparing the next challenge. To Nicholson's skills, he added aeronautical expertise and materials that would intensify the rivalry into a technological race. In 1934, the Royal Yacht Squadron issued a challenge for Sopwith's newly built challenger \"Endeavour\". Being steel-plated, she was less disfavoured than \"Shamrock V\", especially after a minimum mast weight limit was set to , as this made American duralumin technology less advantageous for this contest. \"Endeavour\" received significant innovations, but Sopwith failed to secure the services of his entire \"Shamrock V\" professional crew due to a pay strike. He hired amateurs to complete his team, and while the \"Endeavour\" was described unanimously as the faster boat in the Cup, taking the first two races, failed tactics and crew inexperience lost her the following four races to Vanderbilt's new defender \"Rainbow\".\nTo challenge again, Sopwith prepared himself a year early. In 1936, Nicholson designed and built the \"Endeavour II\" to the maximum waterline length allowed, and numerous updates to the rig made her even faster than her predecessor. A change in the America's Cup rules now allowed a contending yacht to be declared 30 days before the races, so both the \"Endeavour\" and \"Endeavour II\" were shipped to Newport, where the RYS held selection series before declaring \"Endeavour II\" as the challenger. Meanwhile, Harold S. Vanderbilt, taking all syndicate defense costs to himself, commissioned Starling Burgess and the young designer Olin Stephens to provide designs. They anonymously produced three designs each, and thoroughly tank-tested boat models of the six designs, until model 77-C was selected for its projected performance in light airs. The resulting defender \"Ranger\" was even more accomplished than her challenger, and Vanderbilt steered his last J-Class boat to a straight victory.\n1956–1987: The Twelve-Metre Rule.\nThe J-class yachts from the 1930s remained the default for the cup, but post-war economic realities meant that no-one could afford to challenge in this hugely expensive class. As twenty years had passed since the last challenge, the NYYC looked for a cheaper alternative in order to restart interest in the cup. In 1956 Henry Sears led an effort to replace the J-class yachts with 12-metre class yachts, which are approximately in overall length.\nThe first post-war challenge was in 1958, again from the British. Briggs Cunningham, the inventor of the Cunningham sail control device, as skipper with Sears as navigator led \"Columbia\" to victory against \"Sceptre\", which was designed by David Boyd at Alexander Robertson &amp; Sons, for a Royal Yacht Squadron Syndicate, chaired by Hugh Goodson.\nThe first Australian challenge was in 1962, when \"Gretel\" lost to the NYYC's \"Weatherly\", designed by Philip Rhodes and helmed by Emil Mosbacher.\nA second Boyd/Robertson challenger, \"Sovereign\", lost to the Olin Stephens–designed \"Constellation\" in 1964. In 1967, another Australian challenger, \"Dame Pattie,\" lost to the innovative Olin Stephens design \"Intrepid\", skippered again by Emil Mosbacher (which won again in 1970, to become the second yacht, after \"Columbia\" of 1899–1901, to defend the Cup twice).\nFor the 1970 America's Cup, interest in challenging was so high that the NYYC allowed the Challenger of Record (the original yacht club presenting the challenge accepted for the match) to organize a regatta among multiple challengers with the winner being substituted as challenger and going on to the cup match. This innovation has been used ever since, except for the default deed of gift matches in 1988 and 2010.\nAlan Bond, an Australian businessman, made three unsuccessful challenges between 1974 and 1980. In 1974 the cup was successfully defended by \"Courageous\", which successfully defended again in 1977, at which time she was skippered by Ted Turner. In 1980 the Cup was defended by \"Freedom\".\nBond returned in 1983 for a fourth challenge, complete with a symbolic golden wrench which he claimed would be used to unbolt the cup from its plinth, so that he could take it back to Australia. In 1983 there were seven challengers for the cup competing for the inaugural Louis Vuitton Cup, the winner of which would go on to the America's Cup match against the NYYC's yacht selected in their trials. Bond's yacht, \"Australia II\", designed by Ben Lexcen, skippered by John Bertrand, and representing the Royal Perth Yacht Club, easily won the Louis Vuitton challenger series, and Dennis Conner in \"Liberty\" was selected for NYYC's Cup defense.\nSporting the now famous Boxing Kangaroo flag and the controversial winged keel designed by Ben Lexcen, the hull of \"Australia II\" was kept under wraps between races and was subject to attempts by the NYYC to disqualify the boat. In the cup races, the Australians got off to a bad start with equipment failures and false starts giving the USA defenders a head start. But it was not to be a repeat of the last 132 years: the Australians came back and, despite a 3–1 deficit at the start of the fifth race, won the 1983 America's Cup 4–3 in a best-of-seven format. This was the first time the NYYC had lost the cup in 132 years and 26 challenges and opened the opportunity for other US Clubs to earn the trophy in future races. The Australians joked that they planned to run over the cup with a steamroller and rename it \"The America's Plate\".\nFor the first time since its inception the America's Cup was defended outside of the US off the coast of Fremantle. This was a new era for the cup with interest in competing being shown by many countries.\nNow representing his hometown San Diego Yacht Club, Conner returned to win the 1987 America's Cup. His yacht \"Stars &amp; Stripes 87\" earned the right to challenge by winning the 1987 Louis Vuitton Cup against an unprecedented field of 13 challenger syndicates. In the America's Cup regatta he faced defender Iain Murray sailing \"Kookaburra III\", who had beaten Alan Bond's \"Australia IV\" in the defender selection trials. \"Stars &amp; Stripes 87\" swept \"Kookaburra III\" in four straight races for the title.\nTechnology was now playing an increasing role in yacht design. The 1983 winner, \"Australia II,\" had sported the revolutionary winged keel, and the New Zealand boat that Conner had beaten in the Louis Vuitton Cup final in Fremantle was the first 12-metre class to have a hull of fiberglass, rather than aluminum or wood.\nThe 12-metre class rules stipulated that the hull had to be the same thickness throughout and could not be made lighter in the bow and stern. The other challengers demanded that core samples be taken from the plastic hull to show its thickness. At one press conference Dennis Conner asked, \"Why would you build a plastic yacht ... unless you wanted to cheat?\" Despite attempts to defuse the situation, the \"cheating comment\" added to the controversy surrounding the Louis Vuitton challenge races. Chris Dickson, skipper of the \"Kiwi Magic\" (KZ 7), took the controversy in stride and with humour, and Conner has since stated his regret over his comment. New Zealand syndicate head Sir Michael Fay's comment was that core samples would be taken \"over my dead body\". Eventually some small holes were drilled to test the hull, and ultrasonic testing was done to rule out air pockets in the construction. The boat was found to be within class rules, and the issue was set aside. Fay ceremoniously lay down in front of the measurer before the samples were taken.\nYears later, a less than contrite Conner would say he was \"glad\" he lost the race as the effort to regain the cup following his loss focused attention from more than just the narrow interest of yachting enthusiasts. Although unsaid, loss of the cup also allowed it to be won not only by the New York Yacht Club but by other US yacht clubs as well, such as Conner's own San Diego Yacht Club in future series.\n1988: The Mercury Bay Challenge.\nIn 1987, soon after Conner had won back the cup with \"Stars and Stripes\" but before the San Diego Yacht Club had publicly issued terms for the next regatta, a New Zealand syndicate, again led by merchant banker Sir Michael Fay, lodged a surprise challenge. Fay challenged with a gigantic yacht named \"New Zealand\" (KZ1) or the \"Big Boat\", which with a waterline, was the largest single masted yacht possible under the original rules of the cup trust deed. This was an unwelcome challenge to the San Diego Yacht Club, who wanted to continue to run Cup regattas using 12-metre yachts. A legal battle ensued over the challenge, with Justice Carmen Ciparick of the New York State Supreme (trial) Court (which administers the Deed of Gift) ruling that Fay's challenge on behalf of Mercury Bay Boating Club (MBBC) was valid. The court ordered SDYC to accept it and negotiate mutually agreeable terms for a match, or to race under the default provisions of the Deed, or to forfeit the cup to MBBC.\nForced to race, and lacking time for preparation, Conner and SDYC looked for a way to prevail. They recognized that a catamaran was not expressly prohibited under the rules. Multihulls, due to a lower wetted surface area and vastly lower mass, are inherently faster than equal-length monohulls. Conner, however, left nothing to chance and commissioned a cutting-edge design with a wing sail, named—as his 12-metre yachts had been—\"Stars and Stripes\".\nThe two yachts raced under the simple terms of the deed in September 1988. New Zealand predictably lost by a huge margin. Fay then took SDYC back to court, arguing that the race had been unfair, certainly not the \"friendly competition between nations\", envisaged in the Deed of Gift. Ciparick agreed and awarded New Zealand the Cup. However, Ciparick's decision was overturned on appeal and SDYC's win was reinstated. Fay then appealed to New York's highest court and lost. Thus SDYC successfully defended the cup in what observers described as the most controversial cup match to that point. (The 2010 America's Cup was a direct descendant of the 1988 cup, featuring two gigantic multi-hull yachts and would generate even more legal activity and controversy).\n1992–2007: The IACC rule.\nIn the wake of the 1988 controversies, the International America's Cup Class (IACC) was introduced, replacing the 12-metre class that had been used since 1958.\nIn 1992, for the first time, the challenger yacht club, Venice Compagnia della Vela hailed from a non English-speaking country. After winning the Louis Vuitton Cup, the Challenger Il Moro di Venezia (owned by the billionaire Raul Gardini), was defeated 4-1 by USA-23 of the \"America³\" team, skippered by billionaire Bill Koch and Olympic medalist Harry \"Buddy\" Melges.\nIn 1995, the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron syndicate Team New Zealand, skippered by Russell Coutts, first won the challenger series in \"NZL 32\", dubbed \"Black Magic\" because of her black hull and uncanny speed. Black Magic then easily swept Dennis Conner's Stars &amp; Stripes team, in five straight races to win the title for New Zealand. Although team Young America's cup candidate yacht \"USA-36\" was defeated in defender trials by Stars &amp; Stripes' \"USA-34\", the San Diego Yacht Club elected to defend the cup with \"USA-36\" crewed by Stars &amp; Stripes. The run-up to the 1995 Cup was notable for the televised sinking of \"oneAustralia\" during the fourth round robin of the Louis Vuitton challenger selection series, with all hands escaping uninjured. The 1995 defender selection series also had the first mostly female (with one man) crew sailing the yacht \"USA-43\", nicknamed \"Mighty Mary\".\nOn 14 March 1996, a man entered the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron's clubroom and damaged the America's Cup with a sledgehammer. The man, Benjamin Peri Nathan, was charged and found guilty of criminal damage and sentenced to 34 months imprisonment (reduced to 18 months on appeal). The damage was so severe that it was feared that the cup was irreparable. London's Garrards silversmiths, who had manufactured the cup in 1848, painstakingly restored the trophy to its original condition over three months, free of charge. In 2003, an extra 20 cm was added to the cup's base to accommodate the names of future winners.\nAt Auckland in 1999–2000, Team New Zealand, led by Sir Peter Blake, and again skippered by Russell Coutts, defeated the Italian Prada Challenge from the Yacht Club Punta Ala. The Italians had previously beaten the \"AmericaOne\" syndicate from the St Francis Yacht Club in the Louis Vuitton Cup final. This was the first America's Cup to be contested without an American challenger or defender.\nDuring the Twelve-Metre era, the New York Yacht Club, citing the Deed language that the Cup should be \"perpetually a Challenge Cup for friendly competition between foreign countries\", had adopted several interpretive resolutions intended to strengthen nationality requirements. By 1980, these resolutions specified that besides being constructed in the country of the challenger or defender, a yacht had to be designed by and crewed by nationals of the country where the yacht club was located. Globalization made it increasingly difficult to enforce design nationality rules, and starting in 1984, the Royal Perth Yacht Club began relaxing this requirement. Numerous members of the New Zealand AC 2000 team became key members of the Swiss 2003 \"Alinghi\" challenge, led by biotechnology entrepreneur Ernesto Bertarelli. To satisfy the crew nationality requirements, New Zealand team members of Alinghi took up residence in Switzerland.\nIn 2003, several strong challengers vied for the right to sail for the cup in Auckland during the challenger selection series. Bertarelli's team representing the Swiss yacht club, Société Nautique de Genève (SNG), beat all her rivals in the Louis Vuitton Cup and in turn won the America's Cup in a five-race sweep. In doing so, Alinghi became the first European team in 152 years of the event's history to win the cup.\nFor the 2007 challenge, SNG rescinded all interpretive resolutions to the deed, essentially leaving \"constructed in country\" as the only remaining nationality requirement. This allowed the next event, the 2007 defense of the cup, to be held in Valencia, Spain. It was the first time since the original 1851 Isle of Wight race that the America's Cup regatta had been held in Europe, and in a country different from that of the defender (necessary because Switzerland, despite having huge lakes and a national passion for sailing, does not border a \"sea or arm of the sea\" as specified in the Deed). Eleven challenging yacht clubs from 9 countries submitted formal entries. The challenger selection series, the Louis Vuitton Cup 2007, ran from 16 April to 6 June 2007. Emirates Team New Zealand won the challenger series finale 5–0 against Italians Luna Rossa and met \"Alinghi\" between 23 June and 3 July 2007. Ernesto Bertarelli's Team- Alinghi successfully defended the America's Cup 5–2, under the colors of SNG.\n2010: The Golden Gate Challenge.\nAfter Société Nautique de Genève successfully defended the trophy in the 32nd America's Cup, they accepted a challenge from Club Náutico Español de Vela, a Spanish yacht club formed expressly for the purpose of challenging for the cup and keeping the regatta in Valencia. When SNG and CNEV published their protocol for the 33rd America's Cup, there was criticism over its terms, with some teams and yacht clubs calling it the worst protocol in the history of the event. Golden Gate Yacht Club (GGYC) then filed its own challenge for the cup and also filed a court case asking that CNEV be removed as being unqualified under the deed of gift, and that GGYC be named the challenger, being the first club to file a conforming challenge.\nThere followed a long and acrimonious legal battle, with the New York Court of Appeals finally deciding on 2 April 2009 that CNEV did not qualify as valid challenger, and that the GGYC was thus the rightful challenger.\nSince the two parties were unable to agree otherwise, the match took place as a one-on-one Deed of Gift match with no other clubs or teams participating.\nThe match was sailed in gigantic, specialized multihull yachts in a best-of-three race series in Valencia, Spain from 8 to 14 February 2010. The rigid wing sail of the challenging trimaran \"USA-17\" provided a decisive advantage, and it won the 2010 America's Cup in two straight races.\n2013–2017: The catamaran rules.\nThe Challenger of Record for the 34th America's Cup was Club Nautico di Roma, whose team Mascalzone Latino had competed in the challenger selection series for the 2007 America's Cup. In September 2010, the GGYC and Club Nautico di Roma announced the protocol for AC34, scheduling the match for 2013 in a new class of boat, the AC72, a wing-sailed catamaran. Paralleling the \"Acts\" of the 32nd America's Cup—a series of preliminary events in different venues leading-up to the actual event—a new series, the America's Cup World Series was to be run using AC45 class boats (smaller one-design versions of the AC72s), in various world venues in 2011 and 2012.\nOn 12 May 2011, Club Nautico di Roma withdrew from the competition, citing challenges in raising sufficient funds to field a competitive team. As the second yacht club to file a challenge, the Royal Swedish Yacht Club assumed the duties of the challenger.\nRumors of stable hydrofoiling of an AC72 were confirmed when Team New Zealand's AC72 yacht \"Aotearoa\" was seen to be sailing on hydrofoils in August 2012. This triggered a technology race in foil development and control. The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron won the right to sail in the America's Cup match easily beating the Italian and Swedish challengers in the Louis Vuitton Cup. The resulting match between the US and NZ was the longest on record both in calendar time, and the number of races, with the Golden Gate Yacht Club staging an improbable come-from-behind victory, winning eight straight races to defend the cup and beat New Zealand 9–8.\nOracle Team USA was defending the America's Cup 26 May27 June 2017 on behalf of the Golden Gate Yacht Club in Bermuda where racing took place on the Great Sound. Preliminary races were held in Portsmouth, Gothenburg, and Bermuda in foiling AC45s. After the 2013 America's Cup, the Golden Gate Yacht Club accepted a notice of challenge from the Hamilton Island Yacht Club, with whom a new protocol and a smaller wingsail foiling catamaran class rule were proposed in cooperation with participating challengers. The Hamilton Island Yacht Club withdrew from the America's Cup in July 2014, citing unanticipated cost in mounting its challenge.\nThe exiting challenger of record was replaced by a challenger committee, where decisions are made by popular vote. When an even smaller 50ft wingsail foiling catamaran class rule amendment was voted in April 2015, Luna Rossa Challenge also withdrew, citing significant costs wasted on the development of the larger vessel. Yachts from France, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK remained in the competition to challenge for the cup. In June 2016, for the first time in history, an America's Cup race included fresh water sailing, when preliminary races were held on Lake Michigan and based in Chicago, Illinois. Emirates Team New Zealand won the 2017 Louis Vuitton Cup and then challenged the defender, Oracle Team USA. New Zealand won the America's Cup with a score of 7 to 1.\n2021 America's Cup.\nThe 36th iteration of the America's Cup saw the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron defend the cup in Auckland New Zealand in the early southern autumn in March 2021, with the challenger series, the Prada Cup, sailed in the summer between December 2020 and February 2021. For the 2021 America's Cup, a new design rule, the \"AC75\" AC75 was agreed between the Defender (the Royal NZ Yacht Squadron, Emirates Team New Zealand) and the Challenger of Record (Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli). The AC75 would be a 75' foiling monohull with common design components of the canting foil mechanics and software, and a limit of a total of 6 foil and rudder \"packages\" during the complete campaign. The Challenger was Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, the winner of 2021 Prada Cup. The start of AC36, scheduled for 6 March 2021, was delayed to 10 March due to COVID-19 restrictions in place in Auckland.\nEmirates Team New Zealand sailing AC75 \"Te Rehutai\" successfully defended the 36th America's Cup in Auckland New Zealand on 17 March 2021, beating the Italian challenger Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli by 7 victories to 3 victories. Despite being sailed in light and testing conditions (wind speeds never exceeded 15 knots well within the 21 knots allowed) on the Hauraki Gulf, the new AC75 boats reliably and continuously foiled at speeds well in excess of 30 knots on both windward and leeward legs. A fantastic spectacle was put on and off water with thousands of spectator boats, and thousands more land based spectators. The racing courses were in the inner Hauraki Gulf, well positioned for land-based viewing - particularly the \"Stadium Course\", course \"C\" which was the scene of the best race of the regatta with a come-from-behind victory for the defender. Great sporting respect was noted by both teams during the post competition team interviews.\nOn 19 March 2021, Emirates Team New Zealand confirmed that the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron has accepted a Notice of Challenge for the 37th America's Cup (AC37) from the Royal Yacht Squadron Racing, represented by INEOS TEAM UK, which will act as the Challenger of Record for AC37. The following statement was made :\n\"The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron have received and accepted a challenge for the 37th America's Cup from our long-standing British friends at Royal Yacht Squadron Racing.\" Said Aaron Young – RNZYS Commodore. \"It is great to once again have the RYSR involved, given they were the first yacht club that presented this trophy over 170 years ago, which really started the legacy of the America's Cup. Along with Emirates Team New Zealand, we look forward to working through the details of the next event with them.\"\nA Protocol Governing 37th America's Cup will be published within eight months including the provisions outlined in this release."

        "text": "The 1926–27 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey season was the 10th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Benjamin Dubois in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nBefore the season began, Notre Dame had to contend with the loss of their coach. Tom Lieb had taken at Wisconsin and was replaced by Benjamin Dubois. With the team having been hamstrung in each of the previous three seasons due to poor weather conditions, the club arranged a large number of away games and began far earlier than they had before.\nThe first match for the Irish came before Christmas and saw then face an amateur squad from Chicago. A lack of practice and several new faces caused the team to lose but they did not look out of place on the ice. Notre Dame had better results after the winter break when they headed east and played two more amateur clubs. The games showed improving results with the Irish earning a tie then a win as they headed into the long-awaited showdown with the Ivy League powerhouses. Against Harvard, the Irish were completely outmatched. Snub Murphy stopped 65 shots in the game but the final score was still a 0–7 drubbing from the Crimson. The following night, Notre Dame was at the new Madison Square Garden and only played marginally better against Yale.\nThe team returned home after the decisive defeats and tried to fix their issues before the match with Michigan State. Against an inferior opponent, Notre Dame was able to get its first intercollegiate win of the year. The Irish were in command for most of the game and gave faint hope that he early-season struggles had been resolved. The next match was Notre Dame first (and last) home game of the season and saw a solid Michigan College of Mines team in South Bend for the first time. The Huskies got the jump on the Irish and scored twice in the first. After adding a third at the start of the second period, the Notre Dame defense firmed up and stopped all further attempts. However, the offense never got on track and finished the game without a single goal.\nPoor weather forced a game with Marquette to be cancelled and the Irish didn't get back onto the ice until they headed north on their second road trip. The first stop was in the Upper Peninsula and a pair of games against MCM. The Huskies blanked Notre Dame for a second time in the first match, winning 0–4. The third game between the two saw Notre Dame finally get onto the scoresheet but they had to abandon their stingy defense to do so and ended up losing 3–6. With no hope of a western championship, the team headed west to Minneapolis to face the vaunted Minnesota Gophers. While the first game went to form, with the Irish being shutout for the sixth time that season, the seniors responded brilliantly in the rematch. Pinky Martin opened the scoring with his final collegiate goal while Bud Boeringer and Murphy combined to stymie the Gophers. Murphy made 39 saves to earn a stunning win while captain Hicok ended the season with a goal just before the final buzzer.\nUnfortunately for Notre Dame, this season confirmed their worst fears. Even when the school was willing to invest more money and send the team on long sojourns, it wasn't enough. The lack of an enclosed and/or artificial rink meant that the team was completely at the mercy of the elements. Over a four-year span, the team had played just 4 games at home and that was hardly enough to capture the interest of the student body. With no arena prospects on the horizon, the program was shuttered and would not resurface for more than 40 years.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Rugby Sound Festival",
        "text": "The Rugby Sound Festival is an annual music and cultural festival held in the city of Legnano, in the Metropolitan City of Milan, in the Lombardy region of Italy. Founded in the 1980s, the festival has evolved to host diverse musical genres from both local and international performers.\nThe festival's lineup includes a range of musical genres, including rock, folk, pop, hip hop, indie, rap and electronic dance music. The festival is now managed by Shining Production, which combines musical and street food offerings.\nHistory.\nThe Rugby Sound Festival was founded in the early 1980s. It was created as the Parabiago Rugby team's end-of-year party. The festival became accessible to the public from 2000 and has become one of the most important festivals in northern Italy. In 2012, the festival organizers decided that the increasing popularity required professional management and started a collaboration with Shining Production. The organizers began collaborating with external professionals from diverse fields including communication, sponsorship, advertising, and street food. This allowed the festival to gain attendance and popularity. The Rugby Sound Festival held in 2023 had the largest number of visitors in the festival's history and became known as the \"record\" edition. The event was attended by 70,000 individuals and tickets sold out in 12 days, establishing it as one of the most popular festivals in Italy.\nThe Parabiago Rugby Team.\nThe Parabiago Rugby team was created in 1948 by Pietro Dallù with Nino Cataldi as the first president. In two years the team was promoted to the first division (Serie A). Over 200 members of the Parabiago Rugby team, including men and women, subsequently formed a group named \"Squadra dei 200\" to promote sport and teamwork, and continues to actively contribute to the Festival by participating in security.\nFestival Locations.\nLibero Ferrario Stadium.\nFrom 2000 - 2007 the Rugby Sound Festival was held at the Libero Ferrario Stadium, a football stadium located at Viale Guglielmo Marconi in the city of Parabiago. The stadium was originally opened in 1933 in honor of the cyclist Libero Ferrario and hosts Parabiago's home games, with a capacity of 700 seats.\n\"Venegoni - Marazzini\" sports court.\nFrom 2008 to 2016, the Festival was held at the Parabiago Rugby team's sports center, \"Vengoni - Marazzini\" Sports Court in Via Carso in the city of Parabiago. The centre has been home to Rugby Parabiago since 1985 when the club relocated from its previous headquarters, the \"Libero Ferrario\" Sports Centre. It is a conceptual modern construction that has been regularly updated and improved. It has spread across an area of approximately 38,000 m2 to the southwest of the municipal jurisdiction.\nVisconti Castle.\nFrom 2017 - 2023 the Festival has been held at the Visconti Castle (Legnano) (also known as San Giorgio Castle) in Lombardy. The castle is located on raised ground to the south of Legnano (part of the Metropolitan City of Milan) and is situated on a small island created by the Olona river. The precise location of the 'Rugby Sound Festival' is P.zza della Concordia, 1, 20025 Legnano (MI).\nOrganization.\nSince 2016 the Rugby Sound Festival has been organised with the collaboration of Shining Production, the Comune di Legnano and Parabiago Rugby, who provide volunteer support.\nInternational and local artists are contacted in October and continue through November, with a concentration on international artists and groups until December. Italian artists are sourced immediately after the Sanremo Music Festival, which puts a hold on activities until February. The final names of the various artists are finalised between February and April. In response to increasing numbers the organisers developed a VIP experience and enhanced checkout procedures to shorten wait times.\nFestival security organisation involves the Polizia di Stato, Municipal Police, Carabinieri, Guardia di Finanza, Protezione Civile, Italian Red Cross and Agenzia di Sicurezza. It is supported with the aid of a surveillance system and emergency preparations. Security management for the 2023 Festival was the responsibility of Deputy Commissioner Ilenia Romano.\nThe Festival organization includes maintaining rules aimed at discouraging inappropriate behavior, alcohol abuse and violence.\nStreet Food Parade.\nThe Street Food Parade is organized by \"Associazione Culturale Le Officine\", a cultural organization that operates mainly in the provinces of Varese and Milan. The event consists of numerous food trucks coming from all over Italy, with particular regard to traditional Italian street foods. The event was held in Legnano for the first time in October 2016, and more than 30,000 people attended. Because of the unexpected popularity of the event, many food trucks ran out of food.\nThe success of the 2016 event led to cooperation between Shining Production and \"Associazione Culturale Le Officine\" to combine the music festival and food parade to realize \"an event inside the event\" In 2019 a portion of the island was assigned to the Street Food Parade for the duration of the festival. This allowed the visitors of the festival to try the different street foods while attending the musical events of the festival. The initiative was continued for successive editions of the festival.\n2023 Festival \"Record\" Edition.\nThe 2023 Rugby Sound Festival at Legnano Castle island ran from 29th June to 10th July and included concerts, performances and free DJ sets at the end of the night. It had a record attendance of 70,000 people, with a total of six sold-out performances, two of which sold out three weeks before the start. The event achieved The festival was structured as follows: "

        "text": "The UNB Reds men's ice hockey team is an collegiate ice hockey team representing the UNB Reds athletics program of University of New Brunswick. The team is a member of the Atlantic University Sport conference and compete in U Sports. The team plays their home games at the Aitken University Centre in Fredericton, New Brunswick.\nHistory.\nStudents at UNB have been associated with ice hockey as far back as 1880. The first organized game occurred in 1897 when an informal team played against a Canadian Army Company. A second team wasn't organized for another 5 years but, once the Reds hockey team reappeared, the school recognized the club as official representatives of the university.\nBy 1905 enough other schools had picked up the game for New Brunswick to help found the Maritime Intercollegiate Hockey League (MIHL). However, just three years later, the league was rocked by allegations of St. Francis Xavier knowingly using what some felt were ineligible players (there was no governing body of the sport at the time). UNB, along with Acadia and Mount Allison, withdrew from the league and formed their own rival circuit, the Maritime Inter-provincial Intercollegiate Hockey League (MIIHL). The leagues would remain separate until after World War I but the three rogue teams would continue to award a trophy until its retirement in 1928.\nDuring its first 50 years of existence, the UNB Reds played in both collegiate and senior levels of hockey, often at the same time. it wasn't until the late-50's that the team played exclusively as a college program. The then-renamed Red Devils had success in the early 60s and appeared in the second iteration of the University Cup in 1964. After Pete Kelly's retirement in 1966, the team flagged and saw middling results for most of the next 25 years. UNB didn't really recover until the arrival of Mike Johnston in 1989 and he soon had the team back at the top of the conference. UNB won four consecutive Division titles in the mid-90s but they weren't able to parlay that success into a national tournament appearance. After Johnston's departure, the team continued to perform well, finally winning a conference championship in 1997 and then achieved their ultimate goal of a national title the following year.\nIn 2000, Gardiner MacDougall was named head coach and would go on to lead the team to an unparalleled level of success. Over the next 23 seasons, the Reds would win 9 national championships, 12 conference championship and capture 16 consecutive (and counting) league titles.\nMoniker.\nOriginally the school's athletic teams were referred to as simply \"UNB\", however, they were also called \"Red and Black\" or \"The Hillmen\" from time to time. In January of 1958, the student newspaper began to assign specific names to each of the school's varsity programs. They began referring to the ice hockey team as \"Red Devils\". While the fans would accept this change, the school ignored the nickname until the 80s when the name began to appear on team jackets. Unhappy with having a different name for each of its programs, the university decided to have one brand for the athletic department. In 1991, the school selected 4 possible names and allowed students and alumni to vote for the new name. The final result was overwhelming with \"Varsity Reds\" receiving 66% support. The school kept the moniker until 2018 when they rebranded as \"Reds\" while also changing the color scheme.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSenior and collegiate play.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\"\nCollegiate only.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\"\n&lt;br&gt;\nNotable alumni.\nFour players, Darryl Boyce, Kevin Henderson, John LeBlanc and Philippe Maillet, have played in the National Hockey League.\nSee also.\nUNB Reds women's ice hockey"

        "title": "2024 Alpine Skiing World Cup – Women's slalom",
        "text": "The women's slalom in the 2024 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of eleven events, including the final. The slalom season began with the traditional \"reindeer\" opening races in Levi, Finland on 11-12 November 2023. Defending champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States repeated as champion, her eighth victory in the discipline, tying the record for most victories in one discipline.\nSeason summary.\nThe traditional opening slalom races in Levi, which have not been won by someone other than the duo of Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States and Petra Vlhová of Slovakia since the race was cancelled in 2015, held true to form when Vlhová won the first one and Shiffrin won the second. For Shiffrin, this was her seventh race victory at the venue. Shiffrin then won the slalom at Killington, her sixth victory there in slalom in seven starts, and established a 70-point lead in the discipline for the season. In the final event before Christmas, though, Vlhová edged Shiffrin at Courchevel, with no one else finishing within two seconds of her, which reduced Shiffrin's lead in the discipline to 50 points. However, Shiffrin won the last slalom of the year (in Lienz) by over 2.3 seconds against the field, with Vlhova fifth, stretching Shiffrin's season lead to 105 points.\nIn the first race of 2024, in the fog and rain of Kranjska Gora, Shiffrin struggled with the conditions and failed to complete her first run. Vlhová took full advantage, winning the race and closing her deficit in the discipline down to 5 points. However, the two races during the week of 15 January decided the season, as Schiffrin won both: first in Flachau, Austria, edging Vlhová in a mid-week night race, and then in Jasná, Slovakia, where Vlhová, skiing less than 20 km from her childhood home, suffered a season-ending ligament tear, leaving Shiffrin with a 125-point lead over Vlhová and a 228-point lead over her closest active competitor, Lena Dürr of Germany (who finished seventh), with only three races remaining in the discipline for the season.\nHowever, while recovering from ligament sprains, Shiffrin missed the next race in Andorra, which was then won by Sweden's Anna Swenn-Larsson for her second career victory. But Shiffrin returned for the last race before finals in Åre and posted the fastest time on each run to win by well over a second and clinch the season championship in the discipline.\nFinals.\nThe World Cup finals in the discipline took place on Saturday, 16 March 2024 in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup slalom discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship in the discipline, plus any skiers who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, were eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 earned World Cup points. In this race, the winner of the women's slalom Junior World Championship (Dženifera Ģērmane) was already eligible as one of the top 25 skiers in the discipline for the season, and no skier with at least 500 points who wasn't otherwise eligible chose to compete. Due to injuries to Vhlová and Wendy Holdener, only 23 skiers competed.\nAlthough Shiffrin had already clinched the discipline championship, she also won the final for her 97th total World Cup victory (and 60th victory in slalom) in her final race of the season. By placing 15th in the final (the final scoring position, worth 16 points), Dürr finally edged past the injured Vhlová (by 3 points) for second in the discipline for the season."

        "text": "The 1925–26 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey season was the 9th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Tom Lieb in his 3rd season and Hector McNeil in his 1st.\nSeason.\nNotre Dame received welcome news at the start of the season with the weather dropping in late December. The freeze allowed the team to get on the ice as soon as they returned from the winter break while a temporary rink was built between Badin and Walsh halls. The team practiced as often as they could ahead of their opening game but clear skies turned the CMA rink into a quagmire. The ice had turned to slush and forced the two to play on the local lake. Though the conditions were marginally better, cloud cover combined with a lack of lighting forced the game to be called after just 15 minutes. Luckily, the Irish had gotten off to a fast start and their three goals were enough for the win.\nPoor weather conditions persisted in the region and the team was only able to get three practice sessions in ahead of their next match. The Badin Hall rink was unsuitable for use so the team had to use St. Mary's Lake once more. Despite the adverse conditions, Notre Dame and Marquette gave the fans a tremendous show with 12 goals in the match. Much to the home crowd's delight, the Irish came out on top thanks to the program's best offensive performance in almost 4 years. Captain Timmins led of the scoring and was joined by McSorley and Stadel with each netting a pair. Many of their goals came after spectacular passes from Hicok who ended the scoring and even Boeringer was credited with goal, albeit into his own goal. Notre Dame tried several times to set up a return game with Culver but weather would not permit any of those attempts to succeed and the rematch was eventually abandoned.\nAfter the exam break, the Irish set out on a road trip. Their first stop was at Wisconsin and the match was delayed due to soft ice. Once the rink was in a usable state the two battled on the rough surface and found it difficult to generate offense. McSorley finally broke the tie early in the second but a Wisconsin marker soon thereafter knotted the game once more. The third was played to no effect and while both teams were able to continue, the fading light forced the matched to end without overtime. Two days later the Irish were up in Minneapolis taking on the top western team. Notre Dame gave Minnesota everything they had and had a lead after a 3-goal second period. Unfortunately, the Gophers would not go quietly and, after tying the game in the third, Notre Dame needed to battle in overtime to settle the match. Minnesota was able to use its superior numbers by deploying an entirely new set of attackers. While the weren't as strong as the starters, fresh legs allowed the substitutes to quickly put Minnesota in front. After catching their breaths, the starters were swapped back in for the second overtime and extended the Gopher margin, leading to a win for the home squad. The Irish had apparently spent everything they had in the first match because the offense was entirely absent the following night.\nOn their way back home, Notre Dame stopped in Milwaukee for a rematch with Marquette. Neither team was able to score in the first two periods as both goaltenders were outstanding. McSorley finally broke through early in the third period and put the Irish ahead. A few minutes later, Coogan, the Blue and Gold's netminder, tried to clear the puck from the front of his cage only to see the rubber rebound off a skate and into the goal. Marquette scored late in the period but was unable to get the equalizer, giving Coogan the unfortunate distinction of scoring a game-winning goal on himself. Continue warm weather prevented any further games from being played but Notre Dame was finally able to produce a winning season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Ice hockey in Oklahoma",
        "text": "Oklahoma has a mixed relationship with ice hockey in the United States. Several professional teams have called the Sooner state home with some having extended stays, however, ice hockey has yet to catch on at the grassroots level.\nHistory.\nAn unlikely destination for ice hockey due to both its warm climate and modest population (28th in the nation in 2022), Oklahoma didn't have its fist major ice hockey team until 1964. Seeking to increase its footprint in hockey's the suddenly expanding sphere of influence, the Toronto Maple Leafs established the Tulsa Oilers as a farm team in the CPHL which had started a year earlier. The following year the Minneapolis Bruins, a subsidiary of the Boston Bruins, relocated to the state and became the Oklahoma City Blazers. In their first year of play the Blazers defeated Tulsa in the for the league championship and kicked off a rivalry between the two. The championship would remain in Oklahoma for four years, being won by one or the other during that time, but by 1970 the teams began to lose their strength. Once the Bruins withdrew from the Blazers in 1972, the team folded. Oklahoma City went without a pro team for a year before Toronto moved the Oilers to OKC and renamed them as the 'Oklahoma City Blazers'. Immediately following the Oilers departure, a second franchise of the same name was created. Though it began as an independent, it would eventually fall under the oversight of the Atlanta Flames.\nThe new Tulsa team won the league title in 1976 and managed to establish itself with the community. The same could not be said for the new Blazers. After a good first season, the team declined and by 1976 the Maple Leafs cut the franchise loose as a financial drain. The Colorado Rockies stepped in as sponsors but the Blazers sank to the bottom of the league in 1977 and then folded. A year later the CHL returned to Oklahoma City with the Oklahoma City Stars. The team was run by the Minnesota North Stars for the first three seasons and saw some improvement in that time. After switching to the Calgary Flames in 1981, the team flatlined and finished 29 games under .500. That turned out to be the final year for the Stars, who were never able to establish the same kind of rivalry the Blazers had had with the Oilers. Tulsa, meanwhile soldiered on and traded one parent club for another until 1984 when the CPHL (then called the 'CHL') suspended operations along with all of its league members.\nIn 1992, the CHL name was revived and both the Tulsa Oilers and Oklahoma City Blazers were resurrected. While neither had any official connection to the earlier iterations other than their names, the two were able to continue the tradition of minor league hockey in Oklahoma. In the new league's first final, the Oilers defeated the Blazers and instantly rekindled the rivalry between the two fan bases. Three years later Oklahoma City won the championship and then added a second in 2001. The Blazers routinely finished ahead of the Oilers in the standings for existence but the team found itself a victim of its own success. When rumors of a potential AHL team in Oklahoma City surfaced in 2009, the Blazers withdrew their lease extension and folded after the season. Just over a year later, the Oklahoma City Barons made their debut but the new team didn't enjoy the same level of interest as the Blazers. Despite producing winning records every year and making two trips to the league semifinals, the Barons continually suffered from poor attendance and by 2015 the team relocated due to financial losses.\nIn the meantime, the Oilers continued in the CHL until that league folded in 2014. This time, however, Tulsa was able to survive by joining the ECHL. The change to a new league also brought about a chance in the team's fortunes as the Oilers routinely produced winning records in the first decade with the ECHL.\nTowards the end of the Barons' tenure in OKC, the city got its first junior team when the Oklahoma City Jr. Blazers began in 2014. The team played in the WSHL for six seasons but saw both the franchise and the league cease operations in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the wake of their disappearance, a different junior team from Wisconsin assumed the mantle of the Jr. Blazers. A year later, they restyled themselves as the Oklahoma City Ice Hawks. Once season later, the NAHL announced that they would be moving into the region in 2022. In order to forestall a fight that they would likely lose, the Ice Hawks moved to New Mexico and OKC got a new junior team in the Oklahoma Warriors.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nOklahoma's history with minor league hockey had helped the state produce a few notable players despite a very low level of engagement (Only about 1,000 residents were registered with USA Hockey in 2022). Unsurprisingly, most notable players were born in and around Oklahoma City and Tulsa, the two towns that have sported established teams."

        "title": "2024 Alpine Skiing World Cup – Women's super-G",
        "text": "The women's super-G in the 2023 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of nine events, including the final. One super-G on 10 December in St. Moritz was canceled, but it was rescheduled as a second super-G in Zauchensee on 12 January. As discussed in the season summary below, three more cancellations took place during February, reducing the season to eight races, but one downhill was then converted to a super-G to produce the final total of nine.\nSeason summary.\nThe first event in this discipline, which did not take place until 8 December 2023 in St. Moritz, Switzerland, was easily won by three-time defending downhill champion Sofia Goggia, who triumphed by almost a second over the field. The follow-up race on the same slope was canceled due to continuing heavy snowfall. \nIn the next event, 2022 discipline champion Federica Brignone of Italy notched her third victory of the season in a race that only 32 of the 57 starters were actually able to complete, a result that kept Goggia in first place for the season. However, the two races after that, both in the Austrian resort of Altenmarkt-Zauchensee in mid-January, were won first by Cornelia Hütter of Austria and then by four-time (2014, '16, '21, '23) discipline champion Lara Gut-Behrami of Switzerland (her 20th career win in the discipline, placing her second all-time among women), with Hütter second, moving Hütter and Gut-Behrami into the top two positions in the discipline for the season.\nTwo weeks later in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Gut-Behrami won her second straight super-G (her sixth win at Cortina -- and her 41st victory overall), and, when Hütter failed to finish, Gut-Behrami grabbed the season lead in the discipline by just 10 points, but with Brignone and Goggia also still within 85 points of the lead. However, the super-G scheduled for the first week of February in Garmisch-Partenkirchen was then cancelled due to warm weather. However, even the time off didn't affect the proliferation of injuries, with Goggia requiring immediate surgery after breaking two bones in her right leg while doing giant slalom training in Italy, putting her on the sidelines for the rest of the season, while 2019 discipline champion Mikaela Shiffrin was still out after her crash in Cortina.\nThe last month of the season contained four super-Gs before the finals. In the first, in Crans Montana, Switzerland, downhill specialist Stephanie Venier of Austria, who had finished second behind Gut-Behrami at Cortina, upset the field to record her first super-G win, with Brignone second, Hütter fifth, and Gut-Behrami sixth, reducing Gut-Behrami's lead over Hütter to just five points, and also moving Brignone within 34 and Venier within 94 in the discipline. However, heavy snowfall in Val di Fassa, Italy prompted cancellation of both super-Gs scheduled there at the end of February, leaving only two races in the season. But, when the next-to-last downhill of the season, in Kvitfjell, had both planned training runs, on 29 February and 1 March, cancelled by heavy snowfall, the downhill could not be run (as at least one training run prior to the race is required); instead, the race was converted to a super-G to replace one of the canceled races in that discipline, creating back-to-back super Gs on 2 and 3 March. Gut-Behrami won the first race and was second the next day behind Brignone in a race delayed repeatedly by fog, allowing Gut-Behrami to open a 69-point lead over Hütter and a 74-point lead over Brignone, with just the finals remaining. \nFinals.\nThe World Cup final was held Friday, 22 March 2023 in Saalbach, Austria. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup Super-G discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship in the discipline, plus any skiers who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, were eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 earned World Cup points. However, shortly after winning the Junior World Championship, 20-year-old Swiss skier Malorie Blanc required season-ending surgery to repair a tear of her anterior cruciate ligament, forcing her to join past discipline champions Corinne Suter and Shiffrin, plus Goggia and fellow Swiss speed skiers Joana Hählen and Jasmine Flury, on the sidelines for the final. Also, no 500-point skiers who were not otherwise eligible chose to compete, leaving the race with a field of 21 starters.\nBecause of her huge lead going into the final, all Gut-Behrami needed to do was place no worse than 8th to clinch the season crown, and she actually placed seventh, thus winning her fifth super-G season title to tie Katja Seizinger and her former rival Lindsey Vonn for most titles in the discipline; meanwhile, versatile Czech snowboarder and Alpine skier Ester Ledecká won the race, her first Alpine win since missing the entire 2022-23 Alpine season due to injury."

        "text": "The 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event was an event hosted by Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, who invited his counterpart Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese for a Test match to celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties on 9 March 2023, exercising Cricket diplomacy.\nThe 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event was a celebration of the strong ties between India and Australia, which have been forged over many years through the shared love of cricket. The event was also an opportunity to promote sports diplomacy and to encourage people from both countries to come together and celebrate their friendship.\nIt was the fourth and final test match of the 2023 iteration of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, and the match was drawn after Australia declared their second innings. India won the series 2-1.\nBackground.\nDiplomatic Ties.\nForeign diplomatic relations between Australia and India are well-established, with both nations sharing a \"Comprehensive Strategic Partnership\" since both were part of the British Empire. Both are members of the Commonwealth of Nations, and share political, economic, security, lingual and sporting ties. Besides strong trading &amp; migration and culture, sports such as cricket have emerged as a strong cultural connection between the two nations.\nOn 02 April 2022, India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (IndAus ECTA) was signed between the two countries to enhance bilateral economic cooperation and increase trade. The agreement was signed by Piyush Goyal, Union Minister of Commerce and Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Textiles, Government of India and Dan Tehan, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Government of Australia in a virtual ceremony, in the presence of Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi and the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison.\nPM Albanese visited India in March 2023. During the visit, he also led a trade delegation, which included Trade Minister Don Farrell and Resources Minister Madeleine King, after the implementation of the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) between Australia and India on 29 December 2022. It was during this trip when Albanese attended the \"75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event\".\nCricketing Ties.\nIn 1996, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy was created, a test series played between Australia and India, named after 2 legendary test players - Sunil Gavaskar of India and Alan Border of Australia. India has won the trophy ten times, while Australia has won it five times with one series ending in a draw. The event took place in the 2023 edition of the series.\nIndia and Australia have also participated in other major global cricket tournaments and are both ICC member nations. Australia has won 6 Cricket World Cups while India has 2; while both each have won 1 T20 World Cup and 2 Champions Trophies.\nThe Event.\nThe Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel reached earlier to inspect the stadium. Banners of the two prime ministers and players of both sides were put up.\nAlbanese later announced that his country and the Indian government have finalized the Australia-India Education Qualification Recognition Mechanism. He made the announcement at a program where it was officially announced that Australia's Deakin University would set up an international branch campus at GIFT City in Gujarat's Gandhinagar. He also announced the completion of the ECTA agreement.\nThe event began with the two prime ministers singing the national anthems of their respective countries and shaking hands with the players of both teams. They then visited a gallery showcasing glimpses of 75 years of cricket friendship between the two countries. The two PMs visited the \"Hall of fame\" museum inside the stadium.\nAfter the gallery visit, the two prime ministers took a lap of honor around the stadium in a specially designed golf cart. They were greeted by loud cheers from the crowd, who waved Indian and Australian flags. The Prime Ministers met the playing teams and motivated them for the game, as well as handed over caps to their respective team captains - Rohit Sharma of India and Steve Smith of Australia. Before the start of the match, traditional display of Garba was showcased in front of the dignitaries and the crowd gathered.\nThe Prime Ministers were presented with portraits of themselves - Modi was presented his by BCCI secretary Jay Shah while Albanese was presented his by BCCI President Roger Binny.\nThe event concluded with the two prime ministers tossing the coin to start the Test match. The coin for the toss was specially designed for the occasion. They sat in the presidential gallery of the stadium and witnessed some of the initial moments of the match.\nWhile the event was hailed by the BJP, the ruling party in India, it was opposed by opposition; with INC leader Jairam Ramesh tweeting: “Doing a lap of honour in a stadium you named after yourself in your own lifetime - height of self-obsession.”\nThe Match.\nDescription.\nFirst Australian Innings.\nAustralian captain Steve Smith (In the Absence of Pat Cummins) won the toss and elected to bat first. Travis Head and Usman Khawaja embarked on an opening partnership before Ravindra Jadeja caught Head off Ravichandran Ashwin. Skipper Smith attempted a rebuilt but was dismissed for 38 by Jadeja, while Mohammed Shami removed two off-strikers. However, Khwaja went on to score 180 and Cameron Green scored his maiden century, with Khawaja being dismissed short of a double hundred. As Green departed for 114, A late order partnership between Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy saw Australia set a commanding total for 480, with Ashwin taking the wickets of the remainder of the batters, bringing up his thirty-second five wicket haul in international cricket. He became not only the highest wicket taker for India in games against Australia, but also the highest wicket taker in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\nFirst Indian Innings.\nRohit Sharma and Shubman Gill opened India's account, adding 74 runs for the first wicket. After scoring his twenty-first run, Sharma became the sixth Indian to cross 17,000 runs in international cricket. Sharma scored 35 before Cheteshwar Pujara came and went with a contribution of 43, as Gill went on to 114, scoring just his second ever century, as India began piling their own numbers as compared to Australia. He was joined by Virat Kohli, who scored his first test century in more than three years after a slump in form. He, like Khwaja missed his 200 meekly but came in handy as with him India surpassed the Australian total. Jadeja, KS Bharat and Axar Patel added runs as India finished on 571, setting up a lead of 91. Lyon and Matthew Kuhnemann took three wickets each; Lyon again regained the top spot for the highest-number of wickets in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. He also became the highest wicket taker for an overseas bowler in India.\nSecond Australian Innings.\nOn the last day of the match, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne scored 90 and 63 (not out) runs respectively for Australia. Travis, on the verge of scoring a century, was bowled by Axar. The score for Australia in their 2nd innings was 175 runs for the loss of 2 wickets, one each for Ashwin and Patel, as Axar became the fastest Indian bowler to take fifty test wickets in terms of balls bowled (2205). With less time remaining and two massive totals from both sides on the board, the match was headed for a certain draw. In order to win the match and level the series, Australia needed to quickly take a lead and declare, giving India an imposing target. As a result, both captains decided to draw the match at the start of the 78th over. The score for Australia in their 2nd innings was 175 runs for the loss of 2 wickets, one each for Ashwin and Patel.\nOutcome.\nVirat Kohli was the player of the match for scoring 186 runs. With this match drawn, India won the series with 2-1 and retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the fourth time in succession. Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja received joint player of the series award with the former making 86 runs and taking 25 wickets, and the latter making 135 runs &amp; taking 22 wickets, respectively. This was the second time that both of them had won this award. After the match, Kohli presented his signed jerseys to Khawaja and Carey as a symbol of friendship, after the Australian team gave Pujara a signed kit earlier in the series for playing in his 100th test."

        "title": "Ice hockey in New Mexico",
        "text": "New Mexico has had very little impact on ice hockey in the United States. Only a few attempts have been made to increase the visibility of the sport in the Land of Enchantment and most have failed.\nHistory.\nAs one of the most southern and most sparsely populated states (New Mexico didn't have 1 million residents until the 1960s) New Mexico was largely ignored in ice hockey circles for 60 years after achieving statehood. It wasn't until the mid-70s that the Central Hockey League took a chance and placed a team in the state. The Albuquerque Six-Guns debuted in 1973 at the Tingley Coliseum with the plan of having them serve as a farm team for the Kansas City Scouts. However, because the Scouts would not begin play until the following year, the team was forced to build its roster from scratch. Unsurprisingly, the Six-Guns were the worst team in the CHL that year, winning just 16 of their 72 games. The lack of success didn't help the team earn many fans and the club folded after the year.\nA second attempt at expanding ice hockey in the state wasn't made for 20 years. The vacuum ended in the mid-90s when the New Mexico Scorpions were founding members of the Western Professional Hockey League. The team started well, winning the regular season championship in its first season. The fast start helped to endear the team to the local fan base and the Scorpions were able to draw an average of at least 4,000 for its first 5 seasons. While the WPHL collapsed in 2001, the Scorpions were absorbed into the Central Hockey League and continued to enjoy broad support, seeing their annual attendance numbers trend upwards. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough for ownership and the team folded after the 2005 season. Hoping to save the franchise, former NHLers Dave Ellett and Brian Savage bought the team name and brought hockey back to the state with the inaugural game at the Santa Ana Star Center in 2006. However, the year away and a move to outside of Albuquerque proper proved disastrous for the club. The team drew about 3,200 per night in its return and saw those numbers sink lower in each of the next two seasons. In 2009, the team folded due to a myriad of problems, not least of which being a lack of interest by the locals.\nJunior hockey was brought to New Mexico in 1996 as well with the debut of the New Mexico Ice Breakers. The team had a mildly successful run for 5 years in the Western States Hockey League but ceased operations in 2001. Immediately following the dissolution of the Scorpions, junior hockey returned following the relocation of a team from Texas. The New Mexico Renegades were also members of the WSHL but hurt their chances at establishing themselves by being one of the worst teams in the league. The Renegades finished at or near the bottom of their division for each of their five years in Rio Rancho. The team never produced a winning record and on three occasions couldn't even get to 10 wins on the year. During their existence, the Renegades had to compete for fans as a second junior team, the New Mexico Mustangs arrived in 2010. The Mustangs were only slightly more successful on the ice but even worse off financially. After just 2 seasons, the club suspended operations and was later sold to a group that moved the franchise to Minnesota.\nFollowing the end of the Renegades, the state was left without a team until 2019 when the New Mexico Ice Wolves were founded. The team could hardly have picked a worse time to start as the COVID-19 pandemic cut their inaugural season short and then play all of their home game in Texas the following year due to health restrictions. However, the team was able to survive the inauspicious start and reached the league semifinals in their third season. With the franchise finally able to keep itself afloat, it expanded in 2022 by adding a sister team of the same name in the NA3HL.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nDue to the paucity of ice hockey rinks for much of its history, New Mexico has produced very few players who have achieved any notability in ice hockey."

The Cougars, led by fifth-year head coach Brian Barone, played their home games at the First Community Arena in Edwardsville, Illinois as members of the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC).\nPrevious season.\nThe Cougars finished the 2022-23 season 19–14, 9–9 in OVC play to finish in a tie for sixth place. As the No. 6 seed in the OVC tournament, they defeated Southern Indiana in the first round before losing to UT Martin.\nSIUE guards Ray'Sean Taylor were honored as \"All-Ohio Valley Conference\" selections. Taylor was named to the \"All-OVC First Team\", while Minor earned a spot on the \"OVC All-Newcomer Team\".\nSeason forecast.\nNine players return from the 2022–23 squad. They are joined by one freshmen, two transfers from junior colleges, and two transfers from other Division I programs.\nIn a vote of Ohio Valley Conference head men's basketball coaches and communication directors, SIUE was picked to finish 2nd in the 11 team Ohio Valley Conference.\n\"2023-24 OVC Men's Basketball Predicted Order of Finish\"\n1. Morehead State (20 first-place votes) – 200 points\n2. SIUE - 162\n3. Tennessee State (2) - 153\n4. UT Martin - 149\n5. Southeast Missouri - 124\n6. Tennessee Tech - 120\n7. Little Rock - 85\n8. Western Illinois - 80\n9. Southern Indiana - 63\n10. Lindenwood - 40\n11. Eastern Illinois - 34\nGuards Ray’Sean Taylor and Damarco Minor and forward Shamar Wright were named to the 12 member \"2023-24 Preseason All-OVC Men's Basketball Team\".\nRegular season.\nIn their non-conference schedule, the Cougars won all five home games and two neutral court games, but they lost all six road games. \nIn their conference schedule, the Cougars won seven and lost two at home but only won two while losing seven on the road. They finished sixth in the conference, earning the #6 seed for the OVC Tournament. \nPostseason.\nIn voting by league head coaches and communications directors prior to the OVC Tournament, Cougar guard Damarco Minor who has averaged 15.7 points and 8.4 rebounds per game and who was an \"OVC All-Newcomer\" selection last year was named to the \"All OVC First Team\". \nIn the first round of the OVC Tournament, the 6th seeded Cougars met seventh seed Eastern Illinois and won 68-57. They broke a 4-4 tie to take the lead, added a 10-0 run, and led the rest of the game. Trailing by 17 at the half, Eastern took a run at the Cougars as the second half started and put on a tight press defense to cut their deficit to six points. SIUE never faltered, stretching the lead back to eleven and mostly maintaining that margin. Ray'Sean Taylor led four players in double figures with 25 points, with 18 in the first half including a three point buzzer beater. Damarco Minor had his fourth straight and 11th double-double of the season with 16 points and a career high 14 rebounds. Both of the Wright twins were in double figures with Shamar scoring 14 and Lamar 11. \nIn the OVC Tournament quarterfinals, SIUE met third seeded conference co-champion Morehead State. The Cougars got off to a slow start, missing their first four shots and sank only two of their first 11 tries from the field. The Eagles hit only four of their first dozen shots, but they picked up the pace for a thirteen point 34-21 halftime lead. SIUE played closer in the second half, but the Eagles took a fifteen point win 78-63, and Morehead State improved to 24-8 and advanced to the OVC semifinals where they met No. 2 seed and fellow regular-season co-champion UT Martin. Ray'Sean Taylor again led the Cougar's scoring with 19 points and moved into fifth place all-time in SIUE scoring with 1,314 points. Shamar Wright added 12 points and is alone in third place in Cougar scoring with 1,549 points, and he is the all-time leader in games played with 154. Lamar Wright is second in games played with 143 and has 978 career points.\nRoster.\nSource \nSchedule and results.\nSource=\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n \n!colspan=9 style=| Ohio Valley Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| OVC Tournament"

The points were totaled from the top 13 results of the first 16 races, with lower totals being better. If a sailor was disqualified or did not complete the race, 11 points were assigned for that race (as there were 10 sailors in this competition). The top sailor at that point competed in the final race, while the second and third in the semi-final and the others in the quarter-final. \nMateus Isaac from Brazil finished third in the preliminary regatta, but won the semi-final and the final race to claim the gold medal. Ethan Westera from Aruba dominated the preliminary phase and achieved a direct spot in the final final race, where he finished second. Noah Lyons from the United States received the bronze medal.\nResults.\nThe results were as below.\nRace M is the medal race."

He left the club the next year to join Sydney University, where he was studying dentistry. In 1945, Johnson starred as a fly-half in University's premiership team.\nJohnson was capped twice for the Wallabies on the 1946 tour of New Zealand, against the All Blacks in Dunedin and NZ Maori in Hamilton, playing out of position at inside centre. Further selection eluded him, although Johnson was considered likely to make the 1947–48 tour of Britain and France had he not chosen to prioritise his studies."

He missed the 1st Test against New Zealand with a torn leg muscle, but recovered in time for the match against NZ Maori, which was retrospectively awarded Test status to become his first Wallabies cap.

        "title": "Nassau County International Cricket Stadium",
        "text": "Nassau County International Cricket Stadium is a cricket ground being constructed on the grounds of Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, New York, on Long Island. \nIt is being constructed as a modular, temporary venue for the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, during which it will host eight matches. Following the tournament, the modular architecture will be removed, leaving only the field. The venue will be overseen by T20 World Cup USA—the host committee representing matches hosted in the United States during the tournament.\nBackground.\nIn November 2021, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup would be played in the West Indies and the United States. A joint bid was submitted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket following two years of preparation, forming part of a strategic partnership between the two associations.\nIn July 2023, the ICC shortlisted four venues in the United States, which included Lauderhill, Florida (Central Broward Park); Morrisville, North Carolina (Church Street Park); Grand Prairie, Texas (Grand Prairie Stadium); and New York City (Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx). However, the proposed site was criticized by Bronx residents; a group known as the Van Cortlandt Park Alliance was opposed to the venue, citing potential ecological impact, and concerns over the tournament preventing public access to the park for an extended period.\nOn September 22, 2023, the ICC announced that the three U.S. tournament sites would be Fort Lauderdale, Grand Prairie, and a temporary, 34,000-seat stadium at Eisenhower Park on Long Island.\nThe need for a temporary stadium was necessitated by the relative lack of cricket stadiums in the United States, and especially in the New York City area—the United States' most populous region; cricket has usually been considered a niche, international sport, with its most prominent fanbase coming from the diaspora of regions (particularly South Asia) where cricket is considered a mainstream sport.\nDesign and construction.\nThe stadium's design was unveiled by the ICC on January 17, 2024, with construction beginning that week. Designed by Populous, it will utilize a modular architecture, constructed by Arena Event Services, and reuse grandstands that had previously been deployed for events such as golf tournaments and Formula One's Las Vegas Grand Prix. \nThe stadium's outfield, drainage and pitch construction is being overseen by LandTek Group—a company that has worked on playing surfaces for New York's Citi Field and Yankee Stadium, and various NFL stadiums. The outfield will use Kentucky bluegrass, and the drop-in pitch will use Tahoma bermudagrass surfaces prepared in Florida in consultation with the Adelaide Oval's head groundskeeper Damian Hough. The pitches posed particular challenges due to the limited timeframe, and the logstical aspects of the construction process; six of the ten trays needed to be shipped from Adelaide, the grass had to be grown in Florida's warmer climate due to New York's cold winter, and the pitches will have to be transported by semi-trailers with protective blankets to protect them the grass and soil from wind and the different climate conditions along the East Coast. Hough noted that \"I've never moved a pitch further than from Adelaide Oval to Karen Rolton Oval, so moving them for two days on a fleet of semi-trailers certainly throws up a few different issues.\" \nThe stadium is expected to be completed in May 2024, and begin hosting warm-ups and testing in the week of May 14. It will host its first tournament match on June 3, between South Africa and Sri Lanka. Following the tournament, the stands and modular infrastructure will be taken down by the end of July, leaving the cricket ground intact. The natural grass pitch will be replaced by artificial turf to ease maintenance.\nDespite the short turnaround time between completion and its first match, ICC head of events Chris Tetley stated that he was confident in the project due to his trust in the companies involved, and that warm-up events would allow the organizers to \"know from an operational perspective how all of the functional teams that will come together to run the stadium need to interact on an event day with people coming through the turnstiles.\" \"ESPNcricinfo\" observed that the Nassau County stadium would likely be the first venue to have ever hosted an ICC event without having previously hosted an international match beforehand."

        "title": "National Basketball Training Center",
        "text": "The National Basketball Training Center (NBTC) is the official grassroots basketball program of the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas Inc. Its objective is to identify, prepare, and develop young players. It started out as a training program for the Philippines' national basketball teams. They then developed the NBTC League, a nationwide tournament that features the best high school teams from all over the country and since 2016, has also involved international teams. The NBTC also held a Coaches' Convention until 2019, but is now set to be revived in 2024.\nHistory.\nThe program was established in 2007 by the BAP-Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas Inc., as a training program for boys and girls who could compete in the 2010 Youth Olympics. Eric Altamirano and Alex Compton were appointed to head the program, which included scouting the US and Canada to look for players who could join the program. They had experience running a basketball program, as they had also organized a Nike Elite Camp. They also did skills training camps in three different cities. \nAltamirano and Compton wanted to reach out to more rural areas, so they thought of developing a school-based league. In 2008, the NBTC Developmental League, a 16-and-under boys' tournament, was formed, with Altamirano serving as its tournament director. 29 teams participated in the inaugural tournament. During the tournament, certain players were called up for the SEABA Youth tournament pool. They also gave out training modules that were used in different basketball camps around the country. A team of NBTC players also placed fourth in the 2009 FIBA Asia Under-16 Championship.\nIn 2011, the NBTC launched a youth basketball program for public school students ages 14 to 17. They also continued to conduct more workshops, and produce more training modules and instructional videos. \nIn 2012, the NBTC set up a Jr. Elite League, for grade school players 12-and-under, which AMA Computer University won. They also signed a partnership deal with the MVP Sports Foundation. With another partnership with SM in 2016, the NBTC got more media exposure.\nIn 2015, the NBTC organized a 3x3 tournament. It wasn't held again until the 2018–19 season of the NBTC National Championship in hopes of helping the country accumulate points in order to increase its FIBA 3x3 rank and qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nIn 2017, they also put together a basketball camp known as the \"Elite 60\". The following year, three campers were invited to the Batang Gilas pool for the 2018 FIBA Under-17 World Cup.\nThe NBTC's operations were put on hold in the middle of the 2019–20 season of their league due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They were able to resume operations in 2022 with the Global Games, a series of international qualifiers for Filipinos in different parts of the world. In 2023, they launched a girls' high school tournament, with Mau Belen as tournament director and featured eight teams. Fil-Nation Select-USA won the inaugural tournament.\nNBTC League.\nIn 2008, the NBTC Developmental League, a 16-and-under tournament, was formed, with Altamirano serving as its tournament director. 29 teams participated in the inaugural tournament, with 24 from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, and five from the NCR. Since then, hundreds of high school teams and clubs from all over the country have joined as well as several teams from overseas. Through the tournament, local and international basketball talents have been discovered and developed.\nThe tournament also holds the NBTC All-Star Game, which features 24–30 of the best high school players in the country. In earlier years, tryouts were held to see who would take part in the event. Beginning in 2018, the top 24 high school players based on the NBTC's rankings were chosen to play in the event. The event also features a slam dunk contest, three-point shootout, and skills challenge.\nCoaches' Convention.\nIn the early years of the NBTC, Altamirano and Compton traveled to different provinces throughout the country to conduct clinics for players and coaches. After realizing it would be better to bring the coaches to Manila, they held a three-day National Coaches' Convention in 2011 which was attended by 200 coaches and included speakers such as Tim Cone, Chot Reyes, and Ricky Dandan. Attendance to the convention is mandatory for coaches participating in the NBTC League. In 2012, it became a joint project of the NBTC and the MVP Sports Foundation.\nIn the last conference held in 2019, over 1,500 coaches attended, including those from public schools in partnership with DepEd. Speakers at that year's conference included Metta World Peace, Baldwin, and Rob Beveridge. Another convention was scheduled for 2020, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is now set to be revived in March 2024 in partnership with the SBP Coaches' Academy. \nSponsors.\nThe NBTC was first sponsored mainly by Nokia and TAO Corp. In 2011, Energen sponsored the public high school program, while Seaoil sponsored the private high school program. Seaoil sponsored the NBTC for three years. In 2015, with Seaoil letting go of sponsorship, SM Sports Development took over as principal sponsor. Chooks-to-Go joined SM as a title sponsor in 2019."

        "title": "Ice hockey in the District of Columbia",
        "text": "The District of Columbia has a small but expanding relationship with ice hockey in the United States. With the Washington Capitals serving as the flagship franchise in the region, ice hockey has seen steady growth in the Washington, D.C. area.\nHistory.\nDue to its modest winters, ice hockey was a relative unknown in D.C. until the opening of Riverside Stadium in 1938. While it was not primarily an ice rink the multi-purpose arena could be flooded for that purpose. That enabled Georgetown to found a varsity ice hockey team the following season. 1939 also saw the city get its first professional team when the Washington Eagles joined the Eastern Hockey League. Two years later the Uline Arena was completed and the new building served as the home for the Washington Lions. Competition between the Eagles and Lions was fierce in 1942 but eventually the new club won out and the Eagles folded. Compounding problems was the entry of the US into World War II and that caused both the Hoyas and the Lions to suspend operations for the duration.\nThe Hoyas returned in 1946 but it was another year before the reappearance of the Lions. The late return did no favors to the team and Washington finished dead-last in league standings in back-to-back campaigns. To make matters worse, the Lions operated as an independent club in and did not have a parent team to help bail them out of their dire financial situation. After the Lions announced that they were ceasing operations in 1949, the Uline arena changed its policies and no longer allowed ice hockey games to be played. The loss of the venue forced Georgetown to suspend its ice hockey team, leaving the region without an active ice hockey club.\nThe changes didn't last and a second Washington Lions franchise was started in 1951. They returned to the Uline arena, however, Georgetown didn't try to restart its program at the time. The Lions played for five seasons, pausing briefly when the Eastern Hockey League went dark in 1953–54, but were only able to achieve a modest level of success. After the franchise was bought by Harry Glynne III, and Jerry DeLise, the club changed its name to the 'Washington Presidents' and played for another three seasons before stopping for good.\nIn June 1972, the NHL announce that Washington was one of two cities that would receive an expansion team in 1974. Abe Pollin, the owner of the Washington Bullets, announce his plan to build a new arena in nearby Landover, Maryland that would open in time for the Washington Capitals' first season. The team debuted at the Capital Centre in October 1974 an kicked of the worst season in the history of the NHL. Washington was just 8 of its 80 games that season and the club would not produce a winning record for nine seasons. Fortunately, Pollin was able to keep the team's head above water during their early struggles. Whereas many other new teams were forced to move to new locales, The Capitals remained in the D.C. area and became one of the leagues better teams in the 1980s. While Washington was able to achieve regular season success, playoff wins eluded the franchise. Washington made the postseason every year from 1983 through 1996 but only once advanced past the second round, often losing to lower-seeded teams. Despite a surprise run to the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals, the Capitals were not a hot ticket by the end of the 20th century and the team was bought by Ted Leonsis.\nNew ownership brought about new management and the team brought in several big name players, chief among them was 5-time scoring champion Jaromír Jágr. The changes did not bear fruit and by 2004 the team traded most of its players in order to undergo a rebuild. That summer, Washington won the draft lottery, enabling them to select Alexander Ovechkin with the first selection. The arrival of Ovechkin brought about a sea change as his battles with Sidney Crosby (who was on Washington's chief rival, Pittsburgh Penguins) generated a renewed interest in both the team and the game. Since 2005, interest in the sport has flourished in the region, culminating with the franchise's first championship in 2018.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nWashington D.C. has seen a few of its locals achieve notability in the sport. However, because of the city small footprint, nearby regions in Maryland and Virginia a usually included when discussing the impact of the sport on the region. Of those players who are from D.C. proper, about as many were raised elsewhere as inside the borders of the district."

He debuted for the Wallabies in the 1949 home Tests against NZ Maori and won more caps on that year's successful tour of New Zealand, the first Bledisloe Cup series win over the All Blacks since 1934.\nIn 1950, Baxter was seriously injured in an accidental explosion on the \"HMAS Tarakan\" berthed on Sydney Harbour, which killed seven sailors. Suffering severe burns to his back and legs, he was unconscious for a week and close to death, spending a total of nine months in hospital.\nBaxter defied doctor's expectations to return to rugby union, playing further Bledisloe Cup series in 1951 and 1952."

        "title": "List of Le Moyne Dolphins men's basketball seasons",
        "text": "The men's basketball team of Le Moyne College is referred to as the Le Moyne Dolphins, and they play in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the Northeast Conference (NEC). The Dolphins have played their home games on Ted Grant Court at the Le Moyne Events Center in DeWitt, New York since 1962.\nThe Dolphins played their first basketball game at home on December 7, 1948, a 41–39 loss to Siena. Le Moyne's first victory came on the road at Hobart in the Dolphins' second game.\nIn 1950, Le Moyne became a charter member of the Eastern Catholic Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (ECIAC). After only one season, the ECIAC ceased publicizing itself as a conference and became an association of its member schools with no basketball champion crowned, leaving Le Moyne an independent again for 1951–52.\nIn 1955, Le Moyne became a charter member of the new Middle Eastern College Athletic Association (MECAA). The MECAA included teams that were also members of other conferences, a practice not uncommon at the time. When the NCAA split its members into the College Division and University Division in 1956, the MECAA included four teams (St. Francis (NY), Iona, St. Bonaventure and Siena) that were placed into the University Division, while Le Moyne and Saint Peter's were placed into the College Division. St. Francis was also a member of the Metropolitan New York Conference, and St. Bonaventure was also a member of the Western New York Little Three Conference. Nevertheless, all six schools initially continued their affiliation with the MECAA after the split. Le Moyne remained a member of the MECAA, until it was dissolved following the 1975–76 season. The MECAA awarded its championship based on regular-season winning percentage and did not conduct a post-season tournament. The Dolphins took the title seven times during their 21 seasons of membership, the most championships of any conference member. Since conference membership crossed NCAA divisions, the MECAA champion was not awarded an automatic bid to any NCAA tournament. In December 1960, the MECAA conducted an in-season Christmas tournament that included five of its six teams as well as three non-members. Le Moyne defeated Saint Peter's, Iona and Long Island to win the tournament title.\nLe Moyne became a Division II institution, when the College Division was split in 1973. Following the dissolution of the MECAA, the Dolphins played as an independent until joining the Mideast Collegiate Conference (MECC) in 1983, and remained a member of that conference, until it dissolved in 1991. Le Moyne won two MECC regular-season titles and one conference tournament during their eight years in the league.\nAfter playing the 1991–92 season as an independent, Le Moyne joined the New England Collegiate Conference (NECC) in 1992. The Dolphins won the NECC tournament in 1996, their final season in the league.\nIn 1996, the Dolphins joined the Northeast-10 Conference (NE10), where they remained until beginning reclassification to Division I as a member of the NEC in 2023. During their 26 seasons over a span of 27 years in the NE10 (the 2020–21 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Le Moyne won four regular-season conference championships and two conference tournaments.\nPostseason results.\nThe NCAA tournament started in 1939, and the number of teams invited to participate has expanded a number of times over the years. Between 1939 and 1950, the tournament had only eight teams, and then, between 1951 and 1956, the number of participants varied between 16 and 25 teams. Le Moyne was never selected to participate in the tournament prior to the split of the NCAA into divisions.\nThe first College Division tournament was held in 1957, and Le Moyne was first selected to participate in 1959. The College Division tournament became the Division II tournament in 1974. Le Moyne participated in the tournament 13 times between 1957 and 2023.\nSince Le Moyne started its transition to Division I in 2023, it will be eligible to be selected or qualify for the Division I tournament starting in 2028, after its four-year transition period has been completed. , 68 teams participate in the tournament each year.\nThe National Invitation Tournament (NIT), meanwhile, began in 1938, with only six teams. It expanded several times, reaching a peak of 40 participating teams between 2002 and 2006. After the split of the NCAA into divisions, the NIT had no rule that prevented College Division (or, later, Division II or Division III) teams from participating. In fact, Southern Illinois won the 1967 NIT in their final season as a College Division team. Nevertheless, after 1967, all NIT participants have been either University Division or Division I teams. Starting in 2006, the first year the NIT was operated by the NCAA, only Division I teams may be invited to the NIT. Le Moyne has never been invited to participate in the NIT. The Dolphins may not be selected to play in the NIT until 2028, when their transition period will have been completed. The NIT includes 32 teams per tournament .\nThe College Basketball Invitational (CBI) and CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT) are postseason tournaments that select Division I teams that are not participating in either the NCAA tournament or the NIT. Since the CBI and CIT are not operated by the NCAA, they may invite transitioning Division I teams to participate, and Le Moyne was eligible starting with the 2024 tournaments. In the past, both the CBI and the CIT have invited transitioning teams to participate."

At the beginning of World War II, the Phipps family left for Sydney and lived in the now heritage listed Briars estate in the suburb of Wahroonga. He was educated at Barker College along with his three brothers, Bob, John and Peter, who all played first-grade rugby for Gordon.\nAn outside centre, Phipps made his first-grade debut for Gordon in the 1950 grand final loss to Manly. He was capped 11 times for the Wallabies between 1953 and 1956, without missing a Test match.

        "title": "Mitchell Evans (motocross racer)",
        "text": "Mitchell Evans (born 10 November 1998) is an Australian professional Motocross racer. Evans has competed in the FIM Motocross World Championship since the 2019 season, initially in the MX2 class but more recently in MXGP.\nHe has represented Australia at the Motocross des Nations three times, included within this is a third-place finish with the team at the 2022 edition. Evans is a two-time podium finisher in the MX2 class of the FIM Motocross World Championship and has had stints as a factory rider for both Honda and Kawasaki.\nBefore competing in the World Championship, Evans won the MXD championship in Australia in 2016. He was runner-up in the MX1 class of ProMX in 2018.\nEvans is the younger brother of Richie Evans, who has also raced motocross professionally in Australia.\nCareer.\nJunior career.\nEvans first began riding on his families farm in North Queensland with elder brother Richie as well as future Australian Supercross Champion Jackson Richardson. Throughout his early competitive years on smaller capacity machines he regularly competed against other future international stars of his generation including Wilson Todd, Jed Beaton and Hunter Lawrence. In 2010, he represented Australia at the FIM Motocross Junior World Championship in France finishing sixth overall in the 65cc class. Two years later, he again attended the event – this time in the 85cc class, finishing ninth overall.\nIn 2014, while riding for the official KTM Australia team, Evans was able to win two titles at that season's Australian Junior Motocross Championship. The following year he would partner Wilson Todd at the GYTR Yamaha team to compete in the MXD class nationally. His first season in the class was hampered by injuries, but in 2016 he was able to end the year as champion of the class. Following this, when he had already started racing the supercross series domestically, Evans received a last minute call-up to represent his nation at the 2016 Motocross des Nations due to an injury picked up by Jed Beaton. At just 17 years of age and with only five days notice before the event, Evans formed part of the Australian team that would ultimately finish eighth overall.\nProfessional in Australia.\nFor the 2017 season, Evans moved to the Serco Yamaha team in the MX2 class of the Australian Motul MX Nationals and the Australian Supercross Championship. He was immediately competitive in the MX2 class, finishing on the podium at the opening round and going through a four-race winning streak at one point during the season. He went into the final round still in contention for the title, but ultimately would finish third in the final standings. In that season's Australian Supercross Championship, he would suffer multiple vertebrae fractures in his lower back and two fractures to his pelvic bone after a mid-air collision with Aaron Tanti.\nFollowing this, Evans moved team, manufacturer and class for 2018, signing for the Raceline KTM team to race in the MX1 class. In his rookie season on a 450, Evans was able to record several podium finishes to eventually come away as runner-up to runaway champion Dean Ferris. On the back of this, Evans was chosen to represent Australia at the 2018 Motocross des Nations in Red Bud. As the Open class rider on a 450, Evans finished tenth and fourteenth in the main races on the Sunday to contribute to his nation finishing fourth overall.\nWorld Championship career.\nAs a result of his results in Australia and at the 2018 Motocross des Nations, Evans received attention from the FIM Motocross World Championship paddock, particularly from the Honda 114 Motorsports team. After being released from his contract with Raceline KTM in Australia, Evans signed for the factory-supported team ran by Livia Lancelot to drop back down to a 250 and race in the MX2 class for the 2019 FIM Motocross World Championship season. He adapted quickly to this, podiuming at the pre-season Lacapelle Marival International event before finishing third overall at the opening round of the World Championship season. After podiuming on his Grand prix debut, he picked up a second podium later in the season in Portugal, before missing several mid-year rounds due to injury and ultimately finishing eleventh in the standings.\nThese performances were enough for Evans to be promoted to the factory Honda Team HRC for the 2020 FIM Motocross World Championship in the MXGP class, returning to a 450. Like the previous season, he again had a strong opening round, finishing third in the very first race of the year. After a dip in form over the next three rounds, he started to become a consistent top-six rider as the season progressed. At the first race of the Spanish round, Evans suffered a big crash while running in fourth resulting in an injury to his left wrist. After missing the rest of the 2020 season, it was hoped that Evans could return to racing for the 2021 MXGP championship. However, complications with the healing of his wrist injury meant that additional surgery was required. This produced the nightmare situation for Evans where he also missed the entire 2021 season.\nDespite his injury woes, Team HRC retained Evans for the 2022 FIM Motocross World Championship season. He was able to compete at every round of the MXGP championship in 2022 and despite such a long time away from competitive action, managed to produce some noteworthy performances. Running regularly up towards the front of the pack, recording several top-six finishes and winning the Saturday qualifying race in Sweden all contributed to Evans finishing tenth in the final standings. Following this, Evans was selected to compete at the 2022 Motocross des Nations for Australia alongside the Lawrence brothers. After finishing fourth in his Saturday qualifying race, Evans and his teammates were able to finish third overall in the final standings after Sunday's main races.\nFor the 2023 FIM Motocross World Championship, Evans moved to Kawasaki, where he competed for their factory team alongside Romain Febvre. He endured a tough start to his season, missing the first four rounds due to a thumb injury sustained pre-season. Upon his return he gradually improved and placed sporadically inside the top-ten, with a single sixth place in the second race in Germany being his best result. Persistent pain from his old wrist injury meant Evans missed the final two rounds of the season after struggling in the Turkish round. By this time, it had already been announced that Evans' time with Kawasaki had come to an end after a single season, with his spot being taken by Jeremy Seewer in 2024.\nHonours.\nMotocross des Nations\nProMX\nAustralian Junior Motocross Championships"

        "title": "2024 Alpine Skiing World Cup – Women's overall",
        "text": "The women's overall competition in the 2024 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of 39 events in four disciplines: downhill (DH) (8 races), super-G (SG) (9 races), giant slalom (GS) (11 races), and slalom (SL) (11 races). The schedule initially was planned to consist of 45 events, but two downhills on the Matterhorn in mid-November 2023 were cancelled due to high winds and not rescheduled. As noted below in the season summary, four more speed races scheduled for February were also cancelled, reducing the total number of season events to 39 (with 4 downhills and 2 super-Gs having been cancelled).\nAfter an injury to two-time defending champion (and five-time overall champion) Mikaela Shiffrin, the season championship became a battle between 2016 overall champion Lara Gut-Behrami of Switzerland and 2020 overall champion Federica Brignone of Italy, which went down to the technical races at the finals in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria before Gut-Behrami triumphed for her second overall title, eight years after her first. In addition, Gut-Behrami also won the super-G and giant slalom disciplines and was leading in the downhill discipline going into the last race of the finals, giving her the chance to tie the women's record of four titles in one season, held jointly by Americans Shiffrin (2019) and Lindsey Vonn (2010 and 2012) and Slovenian Tina Maze (2013) -- although only Shiffrin did it without a championship in the combined discipline, which Gut-Behrami was also trying to do. However, in that last race, Gut-Behrami lost the downhill discipline title to Cornelia Hütter of Austria, which nevertheless left her with three titles, including a discipline record-tying fifth in super-G.\nAs is the case every fourth year, there were no other major FIS events (world championships or Olympics) taking place during this season. The fifth and sixth existing disciplines, parallel (PAR) and Alpine combined (AC), were eliminated from future World Cup schedules due to a lack of participation or interest in staging these events, and a new event that had been contemplated on the tentative schedule for the season, a team combined (which had been planned for 16 February 2024 at Crans Montana), was also eliminated and replaced with an additional downhill. Thus, for the second straight season, only the four major disciplines were contested.\nSeason summary.\nThe early season: former overall champions come to the fore.\nThe first three races to be held during the season were all technical events (a giant slalom and two slaloms) and saw three former overall champions (and the top three finishers from 2023) emerge victorious: 2016 champion (and 2023 runner-up) Lara Gut-Behrami of Switzerland; 2021 champion (and 2023 third place) Petra Vlhová of Slovakia; and two-time defending champion (and five-time overall champion) Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States. The next two technical events (in the US, a giant slalom and a slalom) were won by Gut-Behrami and Shiffrin (her record 90th win overall), enabling Shiffrin to open an 84-point lead for the season over Vlhová. The following two races, both giant slaloms, which ended the North American portion of the season, were both won by 2020 champion Federica Brignone, moving her into fourth place overall—which meant that the only four former women's overall champions still active occupied the top four places for the season.\nThe speed events (downhill and super-G) did not begin until the eighth event of the season, with three races in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The first race was easily won by three-time defending downhill champion Sofia Goggia, who triumphed by almost a second over the field. The win moved Goggia into sixth place in the season. However, Shiffrin beat Goggia in the next event, a downhill, and moved into a 195-point lead for the season over Brignone, who was third.\nThe next two races were speed races at Val d'Isère; Shiffrin skipped the downhill, and Brignone won the super-G, which Shiffrin failed to finish, moving Brignone to within 63 points of Shiffrin's lead. However, the last race before Christmas was another slalom, and Shiffrin's runner-up finish moved her overall lead back over 140 points. And then the final two races of 2023, both at Lienz, were a giant slalom and a slalom, both won by Shiffrin after huge first runs, which gave her 93 total World Cup victories and stretched her lead for the season over Brignone to 263 points and over Vlhova to 328 points.\nMiddle season: the last two overall champions are injured.\nThe new year started in the rain and fog of Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, where Shiffrin struggled on the soft snow conditions, but her overall lead remained at over 200 points. Shiffrin then missed a three-race weekend (two super-Gs and a downhill) at Zauchensee due to personal illness. However, as the races had three different winners (Sofia Goggia in the downhill and Cornelia Hütter and Gut-Behrami in the super-Gs), the closest competitor to Shiffrin remained Brignone at 140 points behind. Shiffrin then recovered in time for the weeknight slalom in Flachau, which she won to increase her lead to 227 points over runner-up Vlhová and also tie Ingemar Stenmark's record for career podiums in one discipline (81, also in slalom. \nThe next race (a giant slalom at Jasná) took place about 17km south of Vlhová's hometown, but unfortunately featured Vlhová suffering a season-ending injury near the beginning of her opening run, which made Gut-Behrami (320 points behind) and Brignone (322 points behind) into Shiffrin's closest active pursuers. Shiffrin then won the slalom the next day to all but clinch the season championship in that discipline -- and break Stenmark's record for career podiums in one discipline.\nHowever, in the very next race of the season, a downhill at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, Shiffrin herself sprained a couple of ligaments, including her left MCL, in a crash that took her into the safety netting around the course; although she did not sustain season-ending ligament damage, she immediately cancelled her three planned appearances in the following week of racing and was unclear when she would return after that. In keeping with the season, both downhills there were won by different racers; five different women have won the five downhills to this point of the season, while Gut-Behrami, who moved into third in the discipline after Brignone crashed immediately after Shiffrin, also moved into the runner-up spot overall, 295 points behind Shiffrin. The plethora of crashes and serious injuries (including several other season-ending injuries) at this point in the season was contributing to a movement to require World Cup skiers to wear cut-proof underwear, described by one source as \"made of resistant polyethylene substances that are said to be stronger than steel or Kevlar on a per-weight basis\", to prevent cuts from their ski edges during such crashes. In the final race of the weekend, four-time super-G discipline champion Gut-Behrami took advantage of Shiffrin's absence by winning her second straight super-G to close to within 195 points of Shiffrin. \nThe stretch run: the two prior overall champions battle for the lead.\nTwo days later, with Shiffrin still out, Gut-Behrami also won a giant slalom in nearby Kronplatz, which not only moved her into sixth place for all-time World Cup victories among women with 42, but also cut down Shiffrin's overall lead to 95 points. The following two races, a downhill and a super-G scheduled for the first week of February in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, were then cancelled due to warm weather, giving Shiffrin and the other injured skiers another week to recover. However, even the time off didn't affect the proliferation of injuries, with Goggia, who was again leading the downhill discipline, requiring immediate surgery after breaking two bones in her right leg while doing giant slalom training in Italy, putting her on the sidelines for the rest of the season as well. At the next race, a giant slalom in Soldeu, Andorra, Gut-Behrami won again, coming from ninth after the first run to edge Alice Robinson by one-one-hundredth of a second to accomplish two goals: (1) taking the overall lead from Shiffrin (by 5 points); and (2) virtually clinching her first career discipline title in giant slalom (with a 135-point lead over Brignone with just two races to go, and no one else still in contention). One commentator noted that Shiffrin had won her first overall championship in 2017 when Gut-Behrami, who was leading, was injured in February and missed the rest of the season, and Shiffrin came from behind to win; the question still was whether this year would be the reverse. And Gut-Behrami had won her only championship the year before, in 2016, when the same thing happened to overall leader Lindsey Vonn, ending her season -- ironically at Soldeu.\nIn the next race, the first of two downhills at Crans Montana, Switzerland on 16 February, Gut-Behrami won again, in front of the home crowd, and stretched her lead over Shiffin to 105 points. At about the same time, Shiffrin issued a statement saying that she didn't plan to return until the giant slalom and slalom at Åre, Sweden, on 9-10 March, the week before the World Cup finals. When Gut-Behrami placed third the next day, she took over the season lead in the downhill discipline as well, giving her the current lead in every discipline except slalom as well as the overall lead. With a sixth-place finish in the third race, a super-G, Gut-Behrami's lead over Shiffrin grew to 205 points, while Brignone, who was second, closed to within 81 points of Shiffrin. Heavy snowfall in Val di Fassa, Italy prompted cancellation of both super-Gs scheduled there at the end of February, leaving only eight races in the season.\nAt the beginning of March, two speed races were held in Kvitfjell, but heavy snowfall wiped out both practice runs for the downhill, forcing back-to-back super-Gs to be held. Gut-behrami won the first race and was second the next day behind Brignone in a race delayed repeatedly by fog, moving Brignone past the still-absent Shiffrin into second place by 59 points, but still behind Gut-Behrami by 326 points. Shiffrin then announced that she would return for no more than three of the remaining six races in the season, meaning that she would not be able to catch Gut-Behrami, whom she congratulated for her \"stunning\" season, including five victories during Shiffrin's absence. That left Brignone as the only remaining threat to Gut-Behrami, and she rose to the occasion: in the next race, a giant slalom at Åre, Brignone rallied from over a second down after the first run to post the fastest time on the second run and win, which allowed her to close within 286 points. The next day, Shiffrin finally returned from her injury (after missing eleven races in total) and posted the fastest time on each leg of the slalom at Are, not only winning the race by over a second but also clinching her record-tying eighth victory in the discipline.\nFinals.\nThe last events of the season are scheduled for the World Cup finals at Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria. This season, for the first time, the finals will take place over two weekends—16-17 March 2024 for the technical events and 22–24 March 2024 for the speed events—with the last race for the women (the downhill) taking place on Saturday, 23 March. Only the top 25 in each discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship in each discipline are eligible to compete in the finals, with the exception that any skier who has scored at least 500 points in the overall classification is eligible to participate in any discipline, regardless of her standing in that discipline for the season. \nAfter only 8 races, on 8 December, Shiffrin had reached the 500-point milestone for the season; by 27 January 2024 (24 races), eight skiers (Shiffrin, Vhlová, Gut-Behrami, Brignone, Goggia, Sara Hector (Sweden), Hütter, and Michelle Gisin (Switzerland)) had already reached that standard. Ultimately, heading into the finals after 35 races, 14 skiers had scored at least 500 points in all disciplines: the eight already named plus Marta Bassino (Italy), Stephanie Venier (Austria), Ragnhild Mowinckel (Norway), Alice Robinson (New Zealand). Zrinka Ljutić (Croatia), and Lena Dürr (Germany). At that point, the only skiers with points in all four disciplines were Brignone, Shiffrin, Gisin, and Emma Aicher (Germany).\nIn the first race in the new finals format, Shiffrin, who had already clinched the slalom discipline championship, won the slalom final for her 97th total World Cup victory (and 60th victory in slalom) in her final race of the season. In the next race, giant slalom, Brignone began the day 282 points behind Gut-Behrami with only a maximum of 300 points left. Because of the special scoring rules for the finals, the only way for Brignone to win at least a share of the season title involved two steps: (1) Brignone winning all three of the remaining finals (worth 300 points), and (2) Gut-Behrami not finishing higher than 14th in any one race (worth 18 points) and not finishing in the top 15 in the other two (worth 0 points), giving both women a season total of 1,672 points. Brignone lived up to her part of the challenge, winning the first race by almost a second and a half. However, Gut-Behrami finished that final in 10th (worth 26 points), giving her the overall season championship (208 points ahead and only 200 points remaining).. In the last women's race at finals, the downhill, Gut-Behrami's chance of winning four season titles (overall, super-G, giant slalom, and downhill) ended when she finished almost two seconds behind Cornelia Hütter, who began the race in fourth place in the season rankings, which surprisingly gave Hütter the downhill discipline crown."

        "title": "2024 Alpine Skiing World Cup – Women's giant slalom",
        "text": "The women's giant slalom in the 2024 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup included eleven events, including the final. The season opened in Sölden, Austria on 28 October 2023. After an injury to defending champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States, the season championship became a battle between Lara Gut-Behrami of Switzerland and Federica Brignone of Italy, which went down to the last race of the season at the finals in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria before Gut-Behrami triumphed.\nSeason summary.\nThe opening race in Sölden was won by Gut-Behrami, who finished in second place in the discipline last season (her best-ever season finish in the GS discipline). Gut-Behrami followed up that victory by winning the second race in Killington as well. However, both of the next two races in Tremblant, Canada (Quebec) were won by 2020 discipline champion Brignone, who thus moved into second, narrowly behind Gut-Behrami, for the season, with defending discipline champion Shiffrin in third for both races and for the season. \nBack in Europe after Christmas, Shiffrin won the giant slalom at Lienz for her 92nd career victory overall, with Brignone second and Gut-Behrami sixth, moving Brignone into the discipline lead by 35 points over her Swiss rival and 80 points over the American, with everyone else over 150 points behind. However, the first post-Christmas race in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia took place in pouring rain and slushy conditions and was won in an upset by Valérie Grenier of Canada, with Gut-Behrami gaining twenty points on Brignone and closing to just 15 points behind. The next race went into the Low Tatras of Slovakia, about 17km south of the hometown of former overall season champion and current discipline contender Petra Vlhová, but unfortunately featured Vlhová suffering a season-ending injury near the beginning of her opening run. Despite that, the race was won convincingly by Sweden's Sara Hector, with only Shiffrin and New Zealand's Alice Robinson finishing within four seconds of her combined time; meanwhile, sixth-place Gut-Behrami grabbed the overall discipline lead by 25 points over Brignone, who also failed to finish her first run.\nWith Shiffrin also out with an ligament sprain (which turned out to be serious enough that she never returned during the season), Gut-Behrami then blew out the field in Kronplatz, winning her third giant slalom of the season by over a second over Hector and Robinson and opening an 85-point lead over Brignone with only three events remaining. At the next race, a giant slalom in Soldeu, Andorra, Gut-Behrami won again, coming from ninth after the first run to edge Alice Robinson by one-one-hundredth of a second to virtually clinch her first career discipline title in giant slalom, with a 135-point lead over Brignone with just two races to go, and no one else still in contention. However, in the penultimate race at Åre, Brignone rallied from over a second down after the first run with the fastest time on the second run to win the race and remain alive for the championship at 95 points behind Gut-Behrami with just the finals remaining.\nFinals.\nThe World Cup finals in the discipline took place on Sunday, 17 March 2024 in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup giant slalom discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship in the discipline, plus any skiers who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, were eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 earned World Cup points. In this race, the winner of the women's giant slalom Junior World Championship (Britt Richardson) was already eligible as one of the top 25 skiers in the discipline for the season (tied for 25th), and two skiers with at least 500 points who weren't otherwise eligible chose to compete (Michelle Gisin and Lena Dürr). Due to injuries, four qualifiers (Shiffrin, Vhlová, Grenier, and Sofia Goggia) did not compete, leaving a field of 24 skiers.\nBecause of the special scoring rules for the finals, the only way for Brignone to win the season title over Gut-Behrami involved two steps: (1) Brignone winning the final (worth 100 points), and (2) Gut-Behrami not finishing in the top 15 in the final (worth 0 points), giving Brignone a 5-point victory. Brignone lived up to her part of the challenge, winning the race almost a second and a half composite over Alice Robinson. However, skiing cautiously, Gut-Behrami finished the final in 10th (worth 26 points), giving her both her first discipline championship in giant slalom (by 21 points) and the overall season championship (208 points ahead and only 200 points remaining)."

        "text": "The Le Moyne Dolphins men's basketball team plays at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the Northeast Conference (NEC). The Dolphins originally did not play within any athletic conference.\nIn 1950, Le Moyne became a charter member of the Eastern Catholic Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. After only one season, the ECIAC ceased publicizing itself as a conference and became an association of its member schools with no champion crowned, leaving Le Moyne an independent again for 1951–52.\nIn 1955, Le Moyne became a charter member of the new Middle Eastern College Athletic Association (MECAA). The MECAA included teams that were also members of other conferences, a practice not uncommon at the time. When the NCAA split its members into the College Division and University Division in 1956, the MECAA included four teams (St. Francis Brooklyn, Iona, St. Bonaventure and Siena) that were placed into the University Division, while Le Moyne and Saint Peter's were placed into the College Division. St. Francis was also a member of the Metropolitan New York Conference, and St. Bonaventure was also a member of the Western New York Little Three Conference. Nevertheless, all six schools initially continued their affiliation with the MECAA, after the split. Le Moyne remained a member of the MECAA, until it was dissolved following the 1975–76 season. The MECAA awarded its championship based on regular-season winning percentage and did not conduct a post-season tournament. The Dolphins took the title six times during their 21 seasons of membership, the most championships of any member. Since conference membership crossed NCAA divisions, the MECAA champion was not awarded an automatic bid to any NCAA tournament. In December 1960, the MECAA conducted an in-season Christmas tournament that included five of its six teams as well as three non-members. Le Moyne defeated Saint Peter's, Iona and Long Island to win the tournament title.\nLe Moyne became a Division II institution, when the College Division was split in 1973. Following the dissolution of the MECAA, the Dolphins played as an independent until joining the Mideast Collegiate Conference (MECC) in 1983, and remained a member of that conference, until it dissolved in 1991. After playing the 1991–92 season as an independent, Le Moyne joined the New England Collegiate Conference (NECC) in 1992. In 1996, the Dolphins joined the Northeast-10 Conference (NE10), where they remained until beginning reclassification to Division I as a member of the NEC in 2023. The Dolphins play their home games on Ted Grant Court in the Le Moyne Events Center.\nThere have been nine head coaches in the history of Le Moyne basketball. The program has played 1,886 games across 74 seasons from the program's inaugural 1948–49 campaign through the end of the 2022–23 season.\nTommy Niland had the longest tenure at Le Moyne, coaching for 25 seasons, and is the all-time leader in games coached (536) and wins at the school (326). Niland led the Dolphins to six NCAA tournament appearances, the most of any Le Moyne head coach.\nThe current head coach is Nate Champion, who played for the Dolphins from 2010 to 2014."

The points were totaled from the top 9 results of the first 10 races, with lower totals being better. If a sailor was disqualified or did not complete the race, 18 points were assigned for that race (as there were 17 sailors in this competition). The top 5 sailors at that point competed in the final race, with placings counting double for final score. The sailor with the lowest total score won.\nErika Reineke from the United States dominated the regatta to finish ahead of his opponents for the title. Sarah Douglas from Canada was the runner-up and Luciana Cardozo from Argentina received the bronze medal.\nResults.\nThe results were as below.\nRace M is the medal race."

        "title": "1922–23 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1922–23 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey season was the 6th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Paul Castner in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nHopes were high for the program as it entered its 6th season. With an intercollegiate title already under its belt, the Irish hockey team was gearing up for another run when they encountered a common problem for many colleges; poor weather conditions. Because Notre Dame home venue, built next to Badin Hall, was an-open air rink, no amount of planning or preparation could stop warm weather from derailing a season. ND had started the year with designs on an eastern road trip to establish themselves as a national power rather than just a regional one but with the team unable to practice, all of those idea were discarded and the club scrambled to find some way to get on the ice.\nNotre Dame wasn't able to play its first game until early February and the team looked out of sorts. Against Culver Academies, a local prep school, the Irish struggled to score and needed overtime to settle matters. Fortunately, Notre Dame escaped with a win. The team then managed to convince Michigan to take a leap of faith and come to South Bend for a match. The Irish, who had been able to get a decent amount of practice in ahead of time, looked far better against the Wolverines. Tom Lieb starred in goal, turning aside several scoring chances while Spike Flinn, Frank McSorley and Norm Feltes chipped in enough goals for the Irish to carry the day.\nJust two days later, the team began an extended road trip and first headed up to Minnesota. While the team had initially scheduled the Gophers as an opponent, their hastily rearranged slate put an end to those plans. Instead, the Irish opened their road swing with a match against St. Thomas and they found themselves in a tough fight. Castner made his first appearance of the season and he was buoyed by stellar play from Percy Wilcox but the Irish could not solve the Tommies' defense and lost 1–2. It was the first intercollegiate loss for the Irish in over two years and, because they didn't play the Minnesota Gophers, put them in jeopardy of losing their crown. Seemingly reinvigorated by their precarious position, Caster's hat-trick the following evening led Notre Dame to a win.\nTwo days later, Notre Dame was in Houghton, Michigan taking on the Michigan College of Mines. Flinn and Wilcox were staunch in their defensive efforts holding the Huskies to just 3 goals in 2 games. Meanwhile, Castner continued his offensive heroics and led the Irish to a pair of easy victories. The team took a bit of a rest afterwards before swinging down to Ann Arbor. In the rematch with the Wolverines, Castner netted 4 goals and was by far the best player on the ice. The following day saw the team make a short jaunt across the border and play in their first international game when they took on Assumption. Castner was equal to the task, recording a hat-trick in the game but the rest of the Irish were overmatched. Notre Dame had its worst defensive performance of the season and allowed 6 goals to the home team. Fortunately, the game did not affect Notre Dame's chances for the intercollegiate crown as the Irish still only had one loss domestically. Notre Dame returned home that night and ended their season with a rematch against St. Thomas. The game was just as tight as the earlier match and ended with the same score, fortunately, this time the Irish were able to come away as the victors.\nNotre Dame had an enviable record, however, the Irish had a problem. Both Notre Dame and Minnesota had just one loss on the year. While the Gophers had a tie, they also had more wins to their credit. Compounding matters, Minnesota had wins in all of their season series while Notre Dame was tied with St. Thomas 1–1. That final factor tipped the scales in favor of the Gophers and left Notre Dame as the runners up for the Western Intercollegiate Championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Ice hockey in Alabama",
        "text": "Alabama has a checkered history with ice hockey in the United States. Like many states of the deep south hockey did not arrive in any organized fashion for many year and, when it did, the sport had a hard time establishing itself in the gulf coast state.\nHistory.\nThe earliest appearance of ice hockey in the state occurred in Birmingham when the Toronto Toros moved to become the Birmingham Bulls. The team played for another three seasons in the World Hockey Association before the league was forced to fold. During the NHL–WHA merger, the Bulls had hopes that they would be accepted into the NHL, however, no proposals that included Birmingham were ever seriously considered by the NHL. Knowing that they would not join the major leagues, Birmingham searched for a different home and managed to secure a spot in the Central Hockey League, a top-tier minor league. The team was unable to adjust to their new circumstances and began experiencing financial difficulties. The Bulls were forced to suspend operations mid-way through the 1980–81 season.\nThe state wasn't without a team for long as two successive attempts were made to bring hockey back to Birmingham. However, neither the Birmingham South Stars nor the second Birmingham Bulls lasted more than a year. Instead it was the University of Alabama in Huntsville that proved to be the savior of ice hockey in Alabama. Due in part to the number of out-of-state personnel who worked in the area as aerospace and defense industries, Huntsville had an appetite for the sport and fielded a club team as far back as the late 1970s. The team at Hunstville was so popular that the school decided to promote it to varsity status in 1985 and, just two years later, it was such a welcome spectacle that Governor George Wallace declared Huntsville to be the \"Hockey Capital of the South\" in 1987.\nIn spite of their difficulties scheduling opponents and the cost of running a program so far away from any of their opponents (their closest contemporaries were hundreds of miles away), Alabama Huntsville quickly became a player on the national stage and appeared in the 1992 Division II national championship. Two years later the team became just the fifth program to complete a season with an undefeated record since World War II and was only the second (after Cornell in 1970 and Bemidji State in 1984) to win a national title in the process. After a second championship in 1998, Huntsville raised their program to Division I but found themselves mired in mediocrity. The Chargers had a few good years but were mostly relegated to the lower levels. Even when the team won their league championship and made the NCAA tournament, they did so with losing records and lost both games. After the collapse of the men's division of College Hockey America in 2010, UAH was forced to play as an independent for three seasons.\nIn 2013 the major conference realignment enabled the Chargers to join the WCHA but the team had lost all of its momentum in the interim. Over an 8-year span, Alabama Huntsville never finished better than 7th in the conference and posted losing records every year. The team never came close to finishing any season with an even record and slipped further from the thoughts of even the local sports fans. By 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic his an already reeling program and the school announced that the team could not continue unless it received $750,000 in donations. It took less than a week for the funds to be raised, however, The school's distance from the rest of their conference opponents led to UAH facing another existential threat. In 2021, the bulk of WCHA teams decided to leave the conference and reform as the CCHA. The primary reason for this was to reduce the travel costs as the conference had members in Alaska and Alabama while seven of its members were situated around the great lakes. Alabama Huntsville applied for membership in the CCHA, hoping to convince the other teams to keep the Chargers as members but their petition was eventually denied. Once their last appeal went for naught, UAH announced that the program would be ceasing operations but, because enough funding had been secured in the interim, the program would be reinstated as soon as they could find a conference to accept the program.\nDuring the heyday of the UAH Chargers, several attempts at establishing minor league hockey were made. In 1992, a team relocated to Birmingham and became the second Bulls franchise. Art Clarkson, the owner of the Birmingham Barons, brought the team from Cincinnati and the next year had a local rival wen the Huntsville Blast arrived from Virginia. The two teams played one another in the first round of the ECHL playoffs that year but their rivalry was short-lived. Huntsville moved out of state after the year, leaving Birmingham as the only professional team in the state. A year later, however, that situation was remedied when the Mobile Mysticks were founded. The Mysticks had some success but began to see falling attendance almost immediately. The team stated with an average of more than 5,300 in their first season but average attendance fell every year afterwards save one. Going 0–7 in their first three playoff series didn't help matter and by the time the 21st century rolled around Mobile was getting less than 3,500 per game. The bottom fell out in 2002 with an average of about 2,600 and, with the team failing to make the postseason, the franchise suspended operations after the year.\nStarting the same year as the Mysticks, the Huntsville Channel Cats were founding members of the SHL, winning the inaugural league championship. When the league folded after the year, Huntsville had enough of a presence to continue and joined the CHL. The team was one of the top teams in the league over the next few years and won their second championship in 1999. The late 90s saw a change in ownership for both Birmingham and Huntsville; Clarkson sold the Bulls in 1997 and the team soon became a laughingstock. In 2000, the team lost 18 in a stretch of 20 games and were forced to forfeit several games for using ineligible players. Diminishing attendance eventually forced Charles Felix to sell the team to George Shinn, owner of the Charlotte Hornets, and the team was moved to New Jersey. Huntsville, meanwhile, was sold to John Cherney after their second championship and one of his first orders of business was to chance the team's name. Entering the '01 season, the team was rechristened the 'Tornado' but instead of engendering support, all the new name did was rankle fans. Many were survivors of the 1989 tornado that had killed 21 residents and were unhappy with the rebranding. Compounding matters was the departure of many fan-favorite players while the team had its worst on-ice performance since its inaugural season. The Tornado lasted just one season before leaving the CHL amid Cherney's threat to move out of the Von Braun Center if he did not get better game dates. After two years away, the team resurfaced with the old Channel Cats name as members of the new South East Hockey League. Huntsville won the regular season and playoff championship but the league folded after the season.\nThat summer the SPHL, a brand-new minor league, was seeking to found teams and came to an arrangement with the Von Braun Center about a new franchise in Huntsville. When the Huntsville Havoc began in 2004, their appearance brought an end to the Channel Cats' stay and caused the old franchise to cease operations. While the Havoc had an inauspicious start, the team did eventually capture the interest of the fan base and trended upwards in their attendance figures over their first 15 seasons. Three league championships in that time helped the Havoc consistently draw above the league average and allowed them to survive the rocky period during the pandemic. The success of the Havoc led to the SPHL expanding to Birmingham in 2017 and the resurrection of the 'Bulls' name. The third Birmingham Bulls saw a decent amount of success in their first few seasons, making the league finals twice in six years. Art Clarkson was integral in bringing the team back and was managing partner for the first few years. He stepped down after their first run to the title game and died later in 2019.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nWith low statewide engagement (just over 2,000 players were registered as members of USA Hockey in 2023), Alabama has been able to produce just a few notable players. Unsurprisingly, the only two native Alabamians to reach the NHL both hail from Huntsville."

He played for the Minneapolis Marines professional football team and later was their owner and general manager when they played in the National Football League (NFL). Dunn also served as the NFL's vice president.\nPlaying career.\nBefore he joined the Minneapolis Marines, Dunn played halfback for the Minneapolis Cedars sandlot team from 1904 to 1906. In 1907, he joined the Marines, another sandlot team at the time, and he played mostly halfback. Dunn played with the Marines semi-professional and independent professional teams through 1919. He took over management of the team in 1915.\nDuring World War I, Dunn volunteered to serve in the 4th Infantry of the Minnesota National Guard and played on that unit's Company B service team.\nNFL career.\nIn 1921, Dunn and his business partner, Val Ness, purchased a franchise for the Marines in the American Professional Football Association (now the NFL). League owners elected Dunn vice president of the NFL in 1922, a position he would hold through the 1928 season.\nDunn and his partners entered the Minneapolis Marines into NFL competition through 1924 but then withdrew the team. From 1925 to 1928, Dunn continued to serve as vice president of the NFL while he attempted to restart the team as the Twin City Lumberjacks, or to sell his NFL franchise to other interests. In 1927 and 1928, Dunn assembled a Minneapolis Marines team to play NFL exhibition games.\nIn 1929, Dunn and his partners renewed their NFL franchise and renamed the team the Minneapolis Red Jackets. The team played two seasons in the NFL, and in 1930, at midseason, Dunn and his partners sold most of the player contracts to the Frankford Athletic Association who used players from both the Frankford Yellow Jackets and Minneapolis Red Jackets to play out the schedules for both teams.\nPersonal life.\nThe youngest of seven children, including five brothers, Dunn was the son of a Minneapolis businessman, Thomas Dunn, an Irish-born woollen mill operator who came to Minneapolis in 1869 to run the North Star Woollen Mill.\nJohn Dunn was a bookkeeper by trade when he joined the Minneapolis Marines and later worked as a railway postal clerk for the Chicago Great Western Railway, and for several years, he was Minneapolis district superintendent of postal transportation. At some point, he started managing the Clef Camp resort near Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Dunn was vice president of the Minneapolis College of Music, while his wife, Marion, was dean of the Minnesota chapter of the American Guild of Organists."

The match resulted in New Zealand's first loss in a home Boxing Day Test, mainly due to an 11-wicket haul from Shoaib Akhtar.\nFrom 2004 to 2013, the Boxing Day Test was not held, as New Zealand Cricket prioritized limited-overs fixtures during the holiday period due to scheduling preferences and diminishing Test attendances. During this period, ODIs and T20Is replaced the Boxing Day Test.\nIn 2014, the Boxing Day Test returned at Hagley Oval in Christchurch, a shift from its traditional venue, to facilitate an uninterrupted sequence of ODIs before the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The notable event of the 2014 Test was New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum's innings of 195 runs from 134 balls against Sri Lanka, setting a national record for the fastest century at the time.\nFrom 2015 to 2017, Christchurch's Hagley Oval hosted One Day Internationals for the Boxing Day event. In 2018, New Zealand Cricket reintroduced the Boxing Day Test at the same venue, marking a return to the longer format.\nIn 2020, Boxing Day Test match was hosted by Bay Oval in Mt Maunganui.\nOn several occasions, New Zealand has played as the touring side in Australia's or South Africa's annual Boxing Day Test matches, and on such occasions no Test was held in New Zealand. In addition, in December 2022, during New Zealand's tour of Pakistan, the first Test of the series in Karachi began on Boxing Day, and was dubbed a 'Boxing Day Test' by some media in New Zealand."

        "text": "The 2024 Daytona 500 was a NASCAR Cup Series race and the 66th running of the event. It was held on Monday, February 19, 2024, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States. It was the first race of the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series season. It was originally supposed to be run on February 18, but was postponed due to rain. \nWilliam Byron of Hendrick Motorsports won the race after Ross Chastain and Austin Cindric, who were running second and third, crashed in the tri-oval coming to the white flag when the former tried to pass Byron for the lead. It was the first Daytona 500 win for Hendrick since 2014. After an early crash, the race was clean until the Big One with nine laps to go. 23 cars were involved in that pileup which brought out the red flag.\nReport.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of three superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the other two being Atlanta Motor Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees.\nQualifying.\nJoey Logano scored the pole for the race with a time of 49.465 and a speed of . Michael McDowell also qualified second and will appear on the front row for the race. Anthony Alfredo of Beard Motorsports and David Ragan of RFK Racing were the two open cars that qualified for the race via qualifying. \nBluegreen Vacations Duel.\nThe Bluegreen Vacations Duels are a pair of NASCAR Cup Series races held in conjunction with the Daytona 500 annually in February at Daytona International Speedway. They consist of two races 60 laps and 150 miles (240 km) in length, which serve as heat races that set the lineup for the Daytona 500. Both races sets the lineup for positions 3–32. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd–numbered positions on pole qualifying day. The second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even–numbered positions. Positions 33–36 are filled by the four drivers that posted the fastest lap in pole qualifying that didn't lock in a position in the Duel's. Positions 37–40 are set by the four cars highest in the 2019 owner's points that didn't lock in a position in the Duels and weren't among the cars that posted the four fastest timed laps in pole qualifying.\nPractice.\nFirst practice.\nDenny Hamlin was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 45.575 seconds and a speed of .\nFinal practice.\nFinal practice was canceled due to weather conditions.\nRace.\nStage 1.\nPole sitter Joey Logano led the first lap of the race as he and Michael McDowell were side by side. McDowell led lap 2, Logano led lap 3, and McDowell led lap 4 before Logano got infront of McDowell on lap 5. At the same time, the first caution flew for a multi car crash through the tri-oval. It started when John Hunter Nemechek was getting pushed by Brad Keselowski when Keselowski hit Nemechek at the wrong angle and turned Nemechek down into Harrison Burton. Burton spun down right infront of Carson Hocevar and both Burton and Hocevar spun in the wet infield grass. They both then spun back up where Burton came up right infront of Ryan Preece, Kaz Grala, and Austin Dillon while Hocevar spun up infront of Jimmie Johnson. Grala, Burton, and Hocevar's races all came to an end. Many cars including Joey Logano decided to pit for fuel but Christopher Bell, Ryan Blaney, and Daniel Hemric did not pit and Bell led the field to the restart on lap 12. Bell and Blaney were side by side for the lead for multiple laps with Bell leading all of them until lap 31 when Blaney would get infront of Bell and took the lead. On lap 40, Joey Logano took the lead. On the same lap, Logano and some others pitted giving the lead to Michael McDowell. On lap 42, Chase Elliott attempted to take the lead but failed to get infront of McDowell. Elliott tried again on lap 43 and was able to get infront of McDowell on lap 44. But on that same lap, Josh Berry took the lead. Elliott would take it back a lap later. Elliott and others would pit on lap 55 giving the lead to Bubba Wallace. Wallace would pit on lap 56 giving the lead to Noah Gragson. Gragson would pit on lap 60 giving the lead to David Ragan. Both Ragan and Ryan Preece stayed out and ended up losing the lead to the faster oncoming pack led by Kyle Busch and Busch took the lead on lap 63. On the last lap of stage 1 on lap 65, Chase Elliott took the lead. Elliott would hold on and win stage 1.\nStage 2.\nKyle Larson won the race off of pit road and he led the field to the restart on lap 71. On lap 72, Larson was racing with Josh Berry for the lead when a third line led by Joey Logano went by them and Logano took the lead. On lap 85, Todd Gilliland raced side by side with Logano for the lead until lap 87 and couldn't take the lead. Gilliland would take the lead from Logano on lap 93. Martin Truex Jr. attempted to take the lead on lap 95 but failed to get infront of Gilliland. On lap 109, Bubba Wallace took the lead but got passed by Kyle Busch on the same lap and Busch took the lead. Ryan Preece took the lead on lap 111 but immeadietly went to pit and gave the lead back to Busch. During that pair of pitstops, Josh Berry got turned into his pit box by John Hunter Nemechek. Busch and others would pit on lap 114 giving the lead to Kyle Larson. Larson and others would pit on lap 115 and would hold on to the lead with the big gap the pack he was in had. On lap 118, Austin Cindric took the lead. Larson took the lead on lap 120 but was immeadietly passed by Cindric. Kyle Busch got side by side with Cindric on lap 121 and Busch led lap 123 but Cindric took it back. Busch would lead lap 129. On the last lap of stage 2 on lap 130, Cindric took the lead but his teammate Ryan Blaney took the lead from Cindric in turns 3 and 4 and Blaney would win stage 2.\nFinal stage.\nDuring pit stops, Kyle Busch's left front wheel was not secured when he left his pit box. Fortunately, the wheel did not fall off and Busch was able to make it back to pit road to get it secured. Austin Cindric won the race off of pit road and he led the field to the restart on lap 137. Both Cindric and Bubba Wallace ran side by side with Wallace leading lap 137, Cindric leading lap 138, and Wallace leading lap 139. The racing began to intensify during this span. On lap 140, A. J. Allmendinger took the lead from Cindric and Wallace. Both Tyler Reddick and Chris Buescher attempted to take the lead from Allmendinger on the same lap but failed to get infront of him. On lap 148, Corey LaJoie took the lead but Allmendinger led that lap. LaJoie got infront again on lap 149 but was passed by Kyle Busch to the line and Busch took the lead. LaJoie would take the lead with 50 laps to go. With 49 to go, Denny Hamlin took the lead. Busch would lead with 48 to go before Hamlin took the lead the following lap. With 39 to go, Busch went to get in line behind Corey LaJoie off of turn 2 but smacked the wall in the process but did not lose a lot of momentum. With 38 laps to go, Joey Logano took the lead from Hamlin. With 30 to go, Hamlin got infront of Logano but was passed immeadietly by Logano. \nOn Lap 178, the final scheduled pit stops (all under the green flag) took place. With the way pit stops take place on superspeedways, the teams typically pitted by manufacturer. Toyota teams primarily pitted on Lap 178, but Denny Hamlin was unable to make the commitment. On Lap 179, Hamlin, Justin Haley, and Kyle Busch pitted (three different manufacturers) as a trio. Ford teams pitted on Lap 181, including Logano's, which gave the lead to Ross Chastain's Chevrolet. Chastain led a group of Chevrolet teams in the final pit stop on Lap 182, and with a stronger pack, maintained the lead. After the three packs merged, the intensity of the racing picked up, and the bump drafting tactics became \"slam drafting,\" creating serious pushes to create momentum. On Lap 186, defending champion Ricky Stenhouse Jr. took the lead but was passed by Daniel Suárez, who took the lead. With 13 to go, William Byron attempted to take the lead but Ross Chastain made a 3 wide pass and Chastain took the lead with 13 to go. With 11 to go, Joey Logano attempted to take the lead but failed to get infront of Chastain.\nOn Lap 192, the aggressive racing picked up on the backstretch. Keselowski and Logano were on the outside attempting to slingshot past Chastain for the lead. As Chastain made an aggressive block, Keselowski stayed behind him while Logano stayed outside. It created a third lane in the middle where William Byron and Alex Bowman were located, with Bowman pushing Byron. The overaggressive push sent Byron into Keselowski on the inside, turning Keselowski in front of the entire pack, the fourth caution of the night and the first for incident since Lap 5. The wreck collected 23 cars and involved Austin Cindric, Kyle Larson, Brad Keselowski, Chase Elliott, Noah Gragson, Denny Hamlin, Ryan Blaney, Chase Briscoe, Chris Buescher, Martin Truex Jr., Christopher Bell, Joey Logano, William Byron, Daniel Hemric, Todd Gilliland, Ryan Preece, Erik Jones, Tyler Reddick, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Alex Bowman, Ty Gibbs, Anthony Alfredo, and Daniel Suárez. The red flag flew for the mess which lasted for 15 minutes and 27 seconds before it was lifted. The race would restart with 4 laps to go with Chastain leading. Both William Byron and Ross Chastain fought hard side by side for the lead with Byron leading the laps until with 2 to go when Chastain fell back. With 2 to go off of turn 4, Chastain had a big run on Byron and went to the inside of Byron to take the lead coming to the tri-oval. Byron makes a block moving to the outside. Chastain turns down in front of Austin Cindric, with both spinning through the tri-oval while the track was still under green, with NASCAR hoping both cars will straighten up and let the race finish. Byron then crosses the start-finish line to start Lap 200, signaling the race will conclude at the end of the lap. Cindric slides up and NASCAR presses the button to signal the fifth caution period, which ends the race. William Byron and Alex Bowman were side by side when the caution was signaled, meaning NASCAR would use instant replay review to determine the leader at the time of the caution period was started. Two minutes later, NASCAR declared William Byron the winner and Bowman finished in second. This was the first time the No. 24 has been in victory lane in the Daytona 500 since Jeff Gordon in 2005. The win was also a special moment for Hendrick Motorsports as it was 40 years ago to the date Hendrick Motorsports ran its first ever race in NASCAR at the 1984 Daytona 500. Christopher Bell, Corey LaJoie, and Bubba Wallace rounded out the top 5 while A. J. Allmendinger, John Hunter Nemechek, Erik Jones, Noah Gragson, and Chase Briscoe rounded out the top 10.\nRace results.\nStage Results.\nStage One\n\"Laps:\" 65\nStage Two\n\"Laps:\" 65\nFinal Stage Results.\nStage Three\n\"Laps:\" 70\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince 2001—with the exception of 2002, 2004, and 2006—the Daytona 500 have been carried by Fox in the United States. The booth crew consisted of longtime NASCAR lap-by-lap announcer Mike Joy, Clint Bowyer, and 2007 Daytona 500 winner Kevin Harvick. Jamie Little, Regan Smith, and Josh Sims handled pit road for the television side. 1992 and 1998 Daytona 500 winning crew chief Larry McReynolds provided insight on-site during the race.\nIn Canada, it aired on CTV Television Network for the first time since 1996.\nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the Motor Racing Network who have covered the Daytona 500 since 1970—and simulcast on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. The booth crew consisted of Alex Hayden, Jeff Striegle, and 1989 Cup Series champion Rusty Wallace. A special guest, Doug Rice, was also briefly part of the broadcast booth to commemorate his final year working for the Performance Racing Network, and call play-by-play for a few laps. Longtime turn announcer Dave Moody was the lead turn announcer, calling the race from atop the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 2 when the field races through turns 1 and 2. Mike Bagley worked the backstretch for the race from a spotter's stand on the inside of the track &amp; Dillon Welch called the race when the field races through turns 3 and 4 from the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 4. On pit road, MRN was operated by Steve Post, Kim Coon, Brienne Pedigo and Jason Toy."

        "title": "Diary of a cricket",
        "text": "Diary of a cricket (Vietnamese: Dế Mèn phiêu lưu ký) is a Vietnamese children novel written by Tô Hoài. The novel is about a cricket named Mèn and his adventure in a human village and the animal kingdom. The cricket protagonist was originally featured in a 1941 short story by Hoài's \"Con Dế Mèn\" (\"The Cricket\") to the Tân Dân Publishing House, which corresponds to the first three chapters of the modern edition. Around that year, he then wrote second story eponymously titled \"Dế Mèn phiêu lưu ký\" (\"Diary of a cricket\"), which corresponds to the last seven chapters, and later editions of the novel merged it with \"Con Dế Mèn\".\nPlot.\nMèn, a cricket, born alongside two siblings, is separated from them after only two days according to the cricket family's tradition, and he relishes the independence it brings. Mèn, mischievous and playful, inadvertently causes the tragic death of Choắt (Mèn's neighbor, another cricket) by teasing Cốc (cormorant).\nAs Mèn remorsefully contemplates his actions, he is unexpectedly caught by two human children and lost independence. He is forced to fight against other insects for the children's amusement and was malnourished. A harsh lesson from Xiến Tóc (longhorn beetle) involving cutting of Mèn's antennae, led to Mèn's transformative awakening and growth in maturity. One day, while Mèn was trapped in a matchbox and the children's are playing soccer, Mèn seizes an opportunity to break free Freed from captivity, on the way Mèn goes back home, he rescued Trò (moth) from a group of spiders that bullied her due to her family's debt.\nMèn meets his mother and relatives again after the first adventure. While on the way visiting his older siblings, Mèn seeks a companion for a new adventure and encounters Dế Trũi, whom he had previously saved from peril.\nThey become sworn brothers and \"set sail\" on a leaf, only to encounter treacherous waters and almost died from hunger and exhaustion before reaching the \"coastline\". On land, Mèn and Trũi are welcomed by the inhabitants of Đầm Lầy (swampy animal village), however, soon they leave due to the boastful and distasteful Cóc (toad) và Ếch Cốm (frog). They then travel to Cỏ May (grassy area), a region known for its martial spirit, where they win the fight against Bọ Ngựa và Bọ Muỗm (leader of the mantis and bush cricket clans respectively). Mèn and Trũi become leaders of the respective clans. Due to a territorial dispute with the more dominant grasshopper clan in the winter, Trũi is jailed by the clan leader Châu Chấu Voi ('elephant' grasshopper).\nMèn then leaves and embarks on an independent journey. Many seasons later though, Mèn still do not find Trũi. He meet Xiến Tóc again, who has cut his antenna, now bored with life and plays with butterfly and cicada prostitutes. Xiến Tóc tell Mèn that Châu Chấu Voi is a person of good nature and Trũi is still in good health. Shortly after Mèn leaves, he is caught by Trả (bird) and forced to become a servant. Trũi and the Châu Chấu Voi clan then rescued Mèn. Mèn realized that the purpose of an insect's life is to collaborate on shared goals and coexist peacefully with the animal kingdom. He sent a message about that realization to the ants, which then spread the message to the entire animal kingdom.\nAfter the second adventure, he returns to his home. Mèn's mother and older anemic brother are now deceased. Mèn another brother, who was very stern and denied Mèn's invitation to join his adventures, now became much more manly. In the last chapter, Mèn reflects on his life and is in preparation for his third adventure.\nReception.\nAs told by Hoài, the novel is influenced from his involvement with Vietnam's communist movement during his teenage years, and as such the cricket protagonist features a strong adventurous and driven personality.\nThe novel is very popular in Vietnam and is considered a classic of Vietnamese children books. In 2020, Kim Dong Publishing House's text-only edition of Diary of a cricket has been reprinted 87 times, the most out of all books by the publishing house. The novel has been translated to many languages. Theater adaptations of the novel have been performed in Ho Chi Minh City in 2018 and 2023."

Two years later, in 1994, the venue shifted to Kingsmead Cricket Ground in Durban. Durban's Kingsmead remained the predominant venue for the event until 2011, when the Test was hosted at Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town.\nIn 2018, the venue was shifted to SuperSport Park in Centurion, reflecting changes in preferences and attendance patterns."

        "title": "Self-Portrait with Skeleton",
        "text": "Self-Portrait with Skeleton is an oil on canvas painting by the German painter Lovis Corinth, from 1896. It is held in the Lenbachhaus, in Munich.\nDescription.\nThe painting depicts Corinth and the skeleton as the two protagonists: they are near each other, with the panorama of the city of Munich in the background, seen through the wide studio window. The painting cuts off the bodies at chest height and therefore only shows their upper parts. According to Charlotte Berend-Corinth's catalog raisonné, the canvas depicts “Corinth in front of a large studio window, in a pale blue checked shirt.\"\nThe painter presents himself in a realistic way, with little or any idealization. He wears a mustache and short, dark hair, marked by a receding hairline, as well as a light-colored checkered shirt with a dark tie. The skeleton is suspended from a pole with a bracket in the skull and is slightly lower than the artist. A studio window in the background illuminates the scene and places the two figures in backlight. The window runs across the entire width of the painting and consists of small fields, of which two rows of four fields each are partially visible. One of these metal-framed windows is open. This pane, which opens into the room towards the viewer, is located directly behind Corinth and thus visually moves him forward. The metal frames of the window panes form two crosses that can be seen to the right and left of Corinth. A third window cross is hidden by the skeleton. The window offers a view of a white-gray sky. In the lower half of the lower row of windows, buildings, roofs and church towers can be seen in an ocher tone. The smoking chimneys indicate industry.\nCorinth's signature can be found on the upper right edge of the picture in fine letters and is therefore actually very untypical for him. In a cartouche he wrote in German: \"Lovis Corinth./ 38 J. a. 1896.\" (English: Lovis Corinth./ 38 years old 1896.) The “J.” stands and indicates its age, the “a.” for anno and indicates the year. This signature is interpreted as a reference to the frontal \"Self-Portrait\" of Albrecht Dürer (c. 1500) who served as a model.\nInfluences and interpretation.\nCorinth is believed to have painted the \"Self-Portrait with Skeleton\" in response to the \"Self-Portrait with Death Playing the Fiddle\" (1872), by the Swiss painter Arnold Böcklin, who was widely admired back then in Germany. Böcklin depicted the skeleton in his work as a live figure, he plays the violin while the artist listens to it. He wanted to illustrate the fact that life is finite, similarly to a Memento mori, and at the same time, death served as his muse. In this context, he was quoting motifs that had been used frequently in visual arts since the Middle Ages. Hans Thoma also adopted the motif of the skeleton as a muse in his \"Self-Portrait\" (1875). Here a skull decorated with a laurel wreath looks over the artist's shoulder and above his head, in the branches of a tree, sits the god Cupid.\nCorinth took the motif of the skeleton but placed it in a completely new context. He presents a skeleton, as was normally used back then as a teaching model for anatomical demonstrations in medicine, lifeless and in the form of an object that had been stripped of all threat and symbolic power. The skeleton as a utensil can only be kept upright by hanging it on an iron stand. The connection to reality is reinforced by the real depiction of a big city with smoking chimneys that enters through the window into the brightly lit room. By depicting himself with the skeleton, the artist shows the clear and natural limitation of life through death, in which there is no mysticism.\nThe current work is one of the most famous of his numerous self-portraits. This painting was created when he was not yet at the peak of his popularity, and before his important move from Munich to Berlin. In the same year, he also created \"View from the Munich-Schwabing Studio\", which shows a thematic connection with this self-portrait, through the depiction of the view from his studio window.\nContext.\nCorinth had been painting self-portraits regularly since 1886, but the skeleton does not appear in any other of them. He would return to the motif of the hanging skeleton depicted with him, twenty years later, and five years after his stroke, in 1916, in \"The Artist and Death\". This time, there isn't a studio window visible, but instead, as a darker metaphore, a goat skull in the form of a trophy that hangs on the wall at the background.\nIn his later graphics and drawings, created after the German defeat at World War I, in 1918, death in the form of a skull appears very often. He gives death a threatening symbolism, which is missing in this painting. This is particularly impressive in the portfolio with six drypoint etchings, published under the name \"The Danse Macabre\", in 1921. In all six pictures, the people depicted are confronted with death in the form of a skull.\nProvenance.\nThe painting had been in the possession of Dr. A. Ulrich, since 1899. It was later sold by him to the Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus, in Munich."

On 1 November 2017, they officially confirmed their proposed cities and venues.\nThe preliminary round groups would take place in Antwerp, Montpellier, Nantes, Strasbourg, Madrid (who replaced León as a host city due to them not meeting all the requirements) and Santander. The venue in Antwerp was considered too small but was given an exception due to Belgium being a smaller handball nation. The main round would be in Nantes and Bilbao, with the final weekend in Paris. \nHungary and Slovakia.\nHungary and Slovakia both submitted a joint application for the event.

They were originally going to bid alongside Germany for 2022, but the Germans decided to shift away from the project to focus on a solo bid for 2024. Their project was designed to show small nations can host big tournaments sustainably. The bid had full backing from the Danish and Swiss governments. In June 2018, Denmark and Switzerland both played a friendly to further promote their bid. The chairman of the Danish federation, Per Bertelsen, said the bid had a good chance of winning.\nThe main rounds would be in Zürich and Herning, while the final weekend would be in Herning.\nHowever, shortly before the vote, they withdrew their bid for 2022 for unknown reasons.\nBelarus and Russia.\nIn late 2016, Belarus and Russia was reported to have a meeting together talking about a possible bid.

        "text": "Parnell Rugby League Football Club were a rugby league club in Auckland. They competed from 1918 (though more officially 1921) until 1930 before amalgamating with City Rovers at the start of 1931. They represented the Parnell suburb in inner Auckland.\nHistory.\n1918 Tentative start.\nAlthough the Parnell club did not officially form until 1921 they did in fact compete in the 1918 season, fielding two teams. Their sides were in the 4th and 6th grades. Prior to the start of the season they asked the Auckland Rugby League if they could affiliate with Grafton. It was decided to leave the arrangement to the Grafton club. The reason Parnell had asked to affiliate was that they had been late to register as a club. Parnell then tried to affiliate with Newton Rangers. The Auckland Star in reporting on the matter wrote the “Parnell Club requested permission to affiliate with Newton. Owing to nominations being closed, thus barring Parnell from entering teams, the Northcote club offered to forego their nominations in the 4th and 6th grade, so as to allow the Parnell club to participate in the competitions. Affiliation was then granted to the Parnell Club, and the offer of Northcote for the transference of nominations was referred to the Junior Advisory Board”. The New Zealand Herald then said that the league had granted affiliation with the Newton club.\nParnell's first ever games were against City Rovers on May 4 at Victoria Park at 1pm (6th grade), and Grafton Athletic at the Auckland Domain at 3pm (4th grade). The 4th grade side to play in their first match was: Richardson, Freeth, Frye, Hales, Keenan, Hodgson, Gallagher, Lawrence, Baggstron, Bines, Chitty, McLure, Pemberton, Lownes, Crocker, Shorter, Harding, and Gedye. While the 6th grade side was: Hodgson, Simpson, Smith, Taylor, McKay, Peters, Johnston, Packman, Iverson, Green, Kelly, Molloy, Brown, Meehan, Fowler, and Bethell. The 4th grade side lost to Grafton 11 to 8, and the 6th grade side lost to City 3 to 0. The matches were preseason games and the competition did not properly start until 2 weeks later on May 18 with the 4th grade team losing to Sunnyside 12–6 at the Devonport Domain and the 6th grade side losing to City 11–0 at Victoria Park. The results for the lower grade competitions were not consistently reported with the 4th grade side losing all 5 of their games where the score was reported while 3 other scores were not reported. They withdrew from the competition after 9 rounds. The 6th grade side only had 6 results reported from 15 games, showing a win, a draw, and 4 losses. Their win was against Richmond Rovers by 6 points to 0 on June 8.\nThe club did not field any teams in the 1919 season or the 1920 season.\n1921 Parnell League Football Club.\nThe Parnell rugby league club formed as a stand-alone entity on July 7, 1921. The first annual meeting was held in the Carlaw Park meeting rooms with “about 60 attending”. The following were elected officers:- Patron, Hon. A. Myers, M.P.; president, Mr. H. Aisken; vice presidents: Messrs. J.S. Dickson, M.P.; J.J. Sullivan, T. Markwick, J. Keenan, Harry Donovan, and J. Smith; chairman, Mr. Archibald Roy Turner; vice-chairman, Mr. Cameron; committee, Messrs. Gordan Percival Graydon, A. Keenan, H. Holt, G.W. Green, E. Gallaugher, Thomas Edward Cargill, and D.B. Stock. Arthur Myers was the M.P. for the Auckland East electorate at this time and had been the mayor of Auckland from 1905 to 1909. While James Samuel Dickson was the M.P. for Parnell from 1911 to 1928.\nThe 1921 season was in its later stages and the club entered teams in the 4th grade competition, and 2 sides in the 6th grade A and B competitions. They played their first game against Kingsland Rovers on July 16 in the 4th grade at Grey Lynn Park at 3pm, while their 6th grade B side played Richmond at Grey Lynn Park also at 2pm. In August they also entered a 3rd grade side which drew 3–3 with Ellerslie United on August 13. On August 30 they held a Euchre and Dance evening at St. Benedict's Hall with their honorary secretary, Gordon Huia Seagar publishing the newspaper notice. Seagar was the younger brother of George Seagar and older brother of Allan Seagar who both played rugby league for New Zealand. Then on October 30 the club held their annual picnic on Motutapu Island, travelling there by ferry.\nLadies sides (Parnell Pioneers and Parnell Rivals).\nRemarkably considering the club was in its infancy they embarked on a bold effort to form and field women's teams. They very nearly managed to do so however officials with the Auckland Rugby League shut it down. On July 11 the club posted an advertisement which stated “Parnell Ladies League Football Club, A meeting of ladies will be held in the Methodist Hall, Manukau Road, Parnell (a few doors below Murray's Chemist), at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, July 12. All lady enthusiasts invited to attend. Archibald Turner, founder of the Parnell Club, will preside”.\nThe meeting saw a large number of ladies attend and it was decided to play a match between two teams named the \"Parnell Pioneers\" and the \"Parnell Rivals\" at Carlaw Park on July 16 as curtain raiser to the Roope Rooster 1st grade men's games. Over 40 young ladies enrolled, with the majority aged from 16 to 20. They would play two quarters and wear the black and white jerseys of Parnell. It was said that a dozen more offered their services in other capacities. The Herald wrote “there was an English girl who had played “soccer” for the famous “Lyons” team in London, a public school teacher, several school girls, and a number of working girls. They were, on the whole, neat and well built, with an appearance that suggested speed and nippy play more than weight”. While the Auckland Star said a silver shield “similar to the Monteith Shield competed for by the men, had been donated, and members of the Auckland league management committee had donated a football, and were providing assistance in supplying jerseys”. A set of caps had also been donated to be awarded to the winning side while Ivan Culpan, the ARL secretary explained “that the league wished to provide instruction every evening this week, so that the girls would make a good showing in their initial effort”. Mr. E. Stallworthy, a member of the management committee had offered to coach the team and he advised the girls to “breast up to the barrier and not be timid”, with one girl replaying “no fear we won’t”. They placed “four matrons in charge” to “supervise the girls”. They were Mrs. E. McDowell, Mrs. G.W. Green, Mrs. Evelyn Schulze, and Mrs. Tate while club officers were to be elected at a meeting the following night on July 13. At the end of the July 12 meeting a demonstration of play was made on “a model field”.\nIn the meantime there was discussion in the medical community about whether females should be playing rugby union or rugby league at all. A female team had formed in Wellington to play rugby union though had not yet played, while another was proposed for Christchurch. The Star newspaper had approached “several Christchurch medical men” and all of them had said that females should not be playing the contact sports as it “would prove prejudicial to their future health”. On July 13 at the Auckland Rugby League meeting they decided to “defer the application of the Parnell Ladies’ League Club for affiliation until a sub-committee had interviewed local doctors, and the league had thus been put in possession of medical advice upon the matter”. James Carlaw, chairman of the league said “it had apparently been taken for granted that the ladies would play a match on Saturday as a curtain raiser to the men’s game. That was unfortunate, because the true facts of the position were that some officers of the league had attended the meeting of lady enthusiasts in Parnell, and had given information. But they were not there in any official capacity, and the proposal to have a ladies’ club, and to have the ladies play a game, was now officially before the league for the first time”. Carlaw himself was initially against the idea though wished to consider it more while George Hunt thought “football as played by men was far too strenuous a game for girls”, and Ted Phelan said “football was not the proper game for women, who were not built right for such a strenuous pastime”. Carlaw then said “it would be a terrible judgment upon the league if they granted the ladies’ teams permission to play, and then one of the girls was killed or seriously injured”.\nIn the meantime the ladies had been practising on Parnell borough reserve which was situated opposite Campbell Park. Observers noted “tackling low was noticeable by its absence. The result of this, the first essay of the ladies, is not known, but the contestants seemed to thoroughly enjoy the outing. Blouses and bloomers were the prevailing costumes affected, and apparently the much discussed “shorts” are still too much of an innovation. There was a referee on the ground, and line umpires were also in evidence, but the control of the game was not by any means arbitrary”. Days later, on July 20 the Auckland Rugby League officially put an end to any hopes of the ladies being able to play under their oversight. Both sides put forward their arguments but “the request was declined”. Speaking for the right for the ladies to play was “a matron, two girls, together with male members of the Parnell club”. A member of their deputation said “they had already held a practice match in which 64 scrums were held, and were convinced that the game under the suggested modified rules was suitable for girls”. Also Mr. Archie Ferguson, president of the referees committee accompanied them and “explained the modifications of the game… he said tackling, charging, scrum work and playing the ball rules had been altered so as to prevent the rough and tumble of the game”. In the past week more members had joined and their numbers were now up to 65 and it was remarked that girls who were currently playing soccer “were anxious to take up the league game and that girls at Onehunga were practising in anticipation of entering a competition”. Mr Fielding on the committee thought that a trial game could be played under the modified rules with doctors invited to witness the game, however after discussion under committee the amendment was lost on the votes, and the motion that the request of the deputation be declined was carried”.\nOn August 23 the ladies held a special meeting at “the Matron’s Home, No. 8 Constitution Hill” to discuss a match with Canterbury who were based in Christchurch. The Parnell ladies honorary secretary who published the notice of the meeting was G.W. Green. Over the remainder of the year they continued to meet and held euchre and dance evenings at St. Benedicts Hall, East Street, featuring Hawthorne's Orchestra. Their honorary secretary, T. Cargill advertised for a general meeting of the “Parnell Ladies’ League Football Club” on October 27 at the Parnell Methodist Schoolroom. Then at the start of the 1921 season they held their second annual meeting at Newmarket Hall on April 20. The outcome of the meeting was not reported and they were not mentioned again with interest likely waning with no official fixtures or competition for them to play in.\n1922 Member growth.\nThe 1922 season saw Parnell field teams in the 3rd, 4th, and 6th B grades. The 3rd grade team won 4 of their 9 matches that had scores reported and finished mid table, the 4th grade team also finished in the middle of the standings with 4 wins from 10 reported games. Their 6th grade team in the B section only had 7 results reported and won 3 and lost 4 of those. Their second annual meeting has been held at the Methodist Hall on Manukau Road in Parnell on March 1 with G.H. Seagar their honorary secretary at the time the meeting was being organised. Following the meeting it was reported that many new players had been enrolled and they had initially hoped to field 5 teams and enter a side in the senior grade. They had also been trying to entice players in the Newmarket area to join the club. It was planned to organise a working bee to make a new playing ground at Campbell's Point, where a practice match would be played on March 25. Their officers elected for the year were: Patron, Mr. John Albert Endean; president, Mr. H. Asken; vice presidents, Messrs. S. Donaldson, J. Cleave, A. Secombe, E. Sullivan, G. Green, L. Heard, J. Keenan, R. Lewis, G. Johnstone, T. Watts, J. Pound, P.R. Colebrook, J.S. Bringham, J.L. Scott, P. Philcox, R. Martin; chairman, Mr. A.R. Turner; hon. secretary, Mr. G. Seagar; club captain, Mr. G. Cameron; treasurer, Mr. F. Hunter; committee, Messrs. G.P. Graydon, W. Western, W. Porter, J. Boyle, J. Western, P. Auger, C. Clark, F. Jagger, L. Smith, S. Davies, A. Riley”. Their patron, John Albert Endean was the son of John Endean who had \"made money\" gold mining overseas. He lived in the family house which still exists on Symonds Street.\n1923 Four teams.\nIn 1923 Parnell fielded 4 teams, 1 more than the previous season. They had teams in the 3rd grade, 4th grade, and 2 teams in the 6th grades (1 in the A and 1 in the B section). Their 3rd grade side came mid table, while the 4th grade side had a good year winning most of their games to finish around 3rd in an 11 team competition. Their 6th grade team in the A section finished towards the bottom of the table while the team in the B section won 8 and lost 4 of their games with a draw in another to finish near the top of the table. In February they held a meeting once again looking at forming a senior grade side. It was at the rugby league meeting rooms on Swanson Street with A.R. Turner still chairman, and J. Tilton the secretary. They met again on March 22 at the same venue to hold their annual meeting. On June 4 they had a “Grand Concert And Dance” in “aid of equipment fund” at St. Mark's Hall in Remuera. At the conclusion of the season the club went to Brown's Island (Motukorea) on Sunday, December 9.\n1924.\nAt their annual meeting in 1924 Parnell saw a “very large attendance”. They elected John A. Lee as their patron. He was a very prominent socialist in New Zealand and a Labour Party M.P. from 1919 to 1940. Other officers elected were Mr. H. Askin as president, Archibald Ray Hoyte Turner (chairman), vice chairman was Mr. J. Weston, F. Hunter (treasurer), J. Tilton (hon. secretary), and Tilton was also the delegate to the junior management committee. For the 3rd consecutive season the club tried to form a senior team and on February 20 they held a meeting looking for prospective players. A meeting for juniors looking to join the club was then held on February 28. They met once more in mid March at Newmarket Hall on King Street with a request for all intending players to attend. They ultimately fielded teams in the same grades as the previous season (3rd, 4th, and each of the 6th grade sections). The 3rd grade team had 8 results reported of which they won 6 to finish near the top of the competition. The 4th grade side won 4 of their reported 6 games while the two 6th grade teams finished mid table.\n1925 (3 Teams).\n1925 saw a slight reduction in playing numbers with teams entered in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades however it was arguably their strongest year in terms of results to date. There was relatively little coverage of specific details of the club other than an advertisement for all players to weigh in at Carlaw Park on April 19 and for a practice on the following Saturday. In the 3rd grade competition the Parnell side won 6 matches and lost 6 matches with 4 results not reported. Their 4th grade side had a very good season finishing 2nd in a 12 team competition. They had 10 wins and 4 losses with 2 other results not reported. The noticeable thing about their season was their high scoring. They won games 16–0, 13–0, 35–5, 44–0, 33–0, 37–0, 34–3, 18–2, and 21–0 in amongst their handful of defeats. They made it to the semi final of the knockout competition where they lost to Athletic on October 3. Two of their 4 losses came at the hands of the Richmond Rovers side which went through the season undefeated (8-9 and 3–13). The Parnell 5th grade team also performed well winning 5 of their 7 games which had results reported. They lost the knockout final to City Rovers by 16 points to 13 on October 3 which was played as a curtain raiser to the game between Auckland Province and Queensland.\n1926 Entry in B Division (Seniors) and first title.\nThe 1926 season was historic for the club for they managed to field a senior team for the first time. The side played in the newly formed B Division. They also fielded sides in the 3rd grade intermediate competition and the 4th grade. The clubs annual meeting was held at Donovan's Gymnasium on March 9. The gym was a well known facility in the Parnell area with the Donovan family heavily involved in rugby league in its formative decades. Harry Donovan ran the gym and had been on Parnell's committee in 1921. The meeting showed the club was financially stable with a “credit balance of £9 12/, and assets valued at £58 8/, a total of £68”. At the meeting they decided to enter a team in the “senior B grade competition” with practice commencing on the following Saturday. Their officers for the season were: President, Mr. John A. Lee, M.P.; vice presidents, Messrs. Meehan, Rushton, Heard, Peters, McHugh, Petrie, White, Waite, Miller, Muller, Varella, Hunter, Green, Jones, Davies, Holt; hon. secretary, Archibald Turner; delegate to Junior Management Committee, Mr. L. Hilburn; committee, Messrs. Turner, Hunter, Hilburn, Ghent, Pearson, Cocayne, Lawrence, Davies, and Simpson. The club held a practice in mid April at their ground at Campbell's Point followed by a meeting.\nThe senior side struggled winning just 3 of their 12 games and finishing last of the 6 teams although they were relatively competitive in nearly all of their matches. In Round 6 Parnell defaulted to Ellerslie with the club secretary saying \"the fact that five men are on the injured list and that others have had to leave town to seek work in the country were the chief factors\". Stan Clark played for them and would later transfer to the City Rovers in 1929 to experience first grade football and from there he was selected for New Zealand in 1930, going on to play 9 matches for them over 3 years. Their first ever 'senior' match was played against Ellerslie United on April 24 on the No. 2 field at the Auckland Domain and refereed by Les Bull, one of the most prominent referees of the era. Their side was named: Herbert, Brockliss, Southwell, Clark, Griffiths, Hooker (2), Robinson, Binns, Nelson, Lawrence, Faulkner (2), Payne, Patton, Wilson, Smith, Worms, Russell, Perry, Simpson, and White.\nTheir 3rd grade intermediate side saw few results reported, winning 3, losing 2 with 3 other results unknown however they withdrew from the competition after July 17. Their 4th grade side went one better in 1925, winning the competition with 12 wins, 1 draw, and 1 loss from their 14 games. Once again they outscored their opponents heavily most weeks. Their team which was named to play in their opening game on May 1 was Meehan, Loft, Leek, Walsh, Pearson, Tate, Simpson, Sloman, Herring, Clapham, Clough, Stewart, Collins, and Callender.\nThe club also fielded a schoolboys team. The Parnell school was situated at the site of the present day Fraser Park, close to the old Carlaw Park site. It was later demolished due to its unsuitability for a school and rebuilt at the present day site on St Stephens Avenue where the St Stephens Māori school had been situated. They themselves also sought a more suitable site and moved to Bombay, south of present day urban Auckland. The schoolboys side played 5 matches, winning 2 and losing 3 in a somewhat informal competition with sides joining as the weeks went by. On October 7 the Auckland Star published a letter by Parnell secretary stating: “In reference to Mr. Frank Murphy's [headmaster of the school] letter on school boys playing league football, and on refusal to recognise same, I have to note the contents, and in reply I wish to state that I interviewed the master and he raised no objections, mentioning, however, that he would not be a party to consenting to the boys playing. I then saw some of the boys who were eager to play league, and the game was then arranged. Mr. Murphy’s letter does not alter the fact that the majority of the boys in the school team that played against Otahuhu were the same boys that played rugby union all this season.\n1927.\nIronically after their most successful season the Parnell club only fielded 2 sides in the 1927 competitions. They were in the B Division and 3rd grade intermediate competitions. Their B Division team won 3 games, drew 1, and lost 7 to finish 4th in the 7 team competition. It featured two very strong sides in Ellerslie and Kingsland with Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers also competitive, and 4 other clubs who struggled somewhat, though the majority of Parnell's losses were by extremely narrow margins. They scored 103 points and conceded 131. Parnell were defeated by Kingsland Rovers 13-8 in the knockout competition with Kingsland having finished runners up in the championship weeks earlier. Their annual meeting was at Donovan's Gymnasium once more on March 17 at 7.45pm. John A. Lee presided over the meeting with \"a large attendance\". It was said that “financially the club was in a strong position, there being a credit balance of £18 7s. Assets amounted to £69”. Parnell's officers elected for the season were: Patron, Mr. H. A. Lee M.P.; chairman, Mr. F. Hunter; honorary secretary, Archibald Turner; treasurer, Mr. G.H. Davies; delegate to Auckland, Mr. P. Barry; delegate to Junior Management Committee, Mr. L. Heilburn; committee, Messrs. Ralph Brockliss, Wilson, Thompson, O'Brian, Anderson; vice-presidents, same as last year, with power to add; club captain, deferred until next meeting. The club held a practice on April 9 at their ground at Campbell's Point at 2 pm. It was reported that in a practice match that W. Riley had badly injured his shoulder and would “be incapacitated for some weeks”. On July 9 the Parnell senior side travelled to Rotorua and played the local side, winning 27–3. The Sun newspaper reported that “the Parnell team had a splendid trip to the hot pools centre last weekend making the journey by The Sun service car, which landed them back on Sunday night, in plenty of time to start work again bright and early on Monday morning”. They went on to say that Turner of the Parnell club said “they have first-class material in Rotorua, and it only wants a few more visits from metropolitan sides to give the Rotorua men a bit more experience, and they will take a lot of beating”. They also hoped to visit Rotorua again before the end of the season.\nTheir 3rd grade side won 3 games, drew 1 and lost 4, but had 9 results unreported so it is unknown how they fared overall.\n1928.\nThe 1928 season saw Parnell once again only field 2 teams, in the B Division and 3rd grade competition. As Auckland continued to grow the number of young people living in the central Auckland area proportionally reduced so they would have had a reduced pool of young players compared to other suburbs. Their senior team was coached by W. Little and finished 5th in the 7 team B Grade competition which now competed for the Norton Cup. Parnell's season started promisingly with a win over Māngere United 13 to 5, a 12–12 draw with eventual champions Grafton Athletic, and then wins over Point Chevalier (14-8), and Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers (7-5). The first match of the season against Māngere was on the number 2 field at Carlaw Park which was of course situated in the suburb of Parnell. The majority of their home matches were played on the Auckland Domain or the ‘Outer Domain’ section of it which is adjacent to the museum. They then fell away though losing 5 straight games and ultimately finished with a 4 win, 1 draw, 6 loss season. They also lost their first game in the knockout competition to Point Chevalier 13–6 on September 22. Their 3rd grade team withdrew from the competition after defaulting their 11th round match despite having been competitive to that point, finishing with 4 wins and a draw along with 4 losses.\nThe annual meeting was at “Donovan’s Gymnasium, 1st section, Parnell” once more, on March 15. The meeting showed a cash balance of £30 2/11, and assets of £57 10/. The club unfortunately lost their ground due to the council creating an outlet road for eastern traffic which went through the property. The club was now forced to make arrangements to use the Auckland Domain for training purposes. The officers elected for the season were: Patron, Mr. John A. Lee, M.P.; vice presidents, same as last year, with four added; chairman, Mr. T. Wells; treasurer, Mr. George Davies; hon. secretary, Mr. G. Smith; senior delegate to Auckland Rugby League, Mr. P. Barry; junior delegate, Mr. L. Heilburn; club captain, Mr. Ralph Brockliss; coach, Mr. W. Little; committee, Messrs. Wells, Turner, George Davies, Brockliss, Stan Clark, W. Little, Richard Sloman, McArthur, Ritchie, McLure, and Anderson. (Leo) Ralph Brockliss has previously played for Newton Rangers senior side earlier in the decade and was now aged 30. His son, Morris (Morrie) Brockliss played for Marist in the 1940s. The club advertised that trainings at the start of the season would be on the Domain, Tuesday and Thursday at 7.30pm.\n1929 One team.\nBy 1929 Parnell was only able to field one team. They were their B Division team and they finished second to last in the championship winning just two of their 10 games. Both of their wins came against the last placed Māngere United. In the Stallard Cup played after the championship they lost 3 games, had a match postponed and then forfeited their final game of the season. Their annual meeting had been held at Donovan's Gymnasium on March 14 with their honorary secretary still A.R. Turner. The club had a credit balance of £25 and chairman George Davies presided over the annual meeting. Their patron was John A. Lee once more, with others elected being: chairman, Mr. George Davies; treasurer, Mr. George Davies; secretary, Mr. A.R. Turner; delegate to A.R.L., Mr. George Davies; coach Mr. Ralph Brockliss; club captain, Mr. Richard (Dick) Arthur Sloman; committee, Messrs. Hosking, Ritchie, Clark, Peachey, Brockliss, Sloman, O’Donnell, and Pearson. Ralph Brockliss had moved from captaining the side to being their coach with Richard (Dick) Sloman becoming captain. He had played for Parnell for several years and was in their 6th grade team in 1921 before progressing to the senior side of 1927. The senior side held a practice at the start of the season at Carlaw Park. At the end of the season the side travelled to Huntly to play the local side. They lost 24–16 with their standout players being Hine and Anderson.\n1930 Partnership with Akarana.\nThe 1930 season saw Parnell field a team in the B Division again but they also joined forces with the Akarana club to field teams in the 3rd intermediate, 4th, and 5th grades. The senior side only fared slightly better than the previous year, winning 4 of its 12 games (2 more than 1929) to finish second to last once more.\nAs in previous years the annual meeting was at Donovan's Gymnasium in Parnell with Archibald Turner continuing in the position of honorary secretary. The meeting was held on March 10. At the meeting a vote of thanks was given to George Davies who had been their senior delegate to the ARL. He was resigning to take up a place in the neighbouring Newmarket league club. It was mentioned that the club had made a practice of sending a team away each year and that they had given “a good account of themselves”. They had a cash balance of £30 in the bank and gear to the value of £11. It was also said that many new members had joined the club and the “outlook for the 1930 season is very promising”. The election of officers saw positions go to John A. Lee who was again patron; chairman, Mr. F. Hunter; secretary and treasurer, Archibald Turner; delegate to ARL, Mr. T. Wells; club captain, Richard Sloman; coach, Ralph Brockliss.\nThe combined junior sides with Akarana did well. The 3rd grade intermediate team won 6 and drew 1 of their 12 games to finish mid table, while the 4th grade team won 12 games, drew 3, and lost 5 of their matches to finish second in a 12 team competition. Their 5th grade side won 5 of their 14 games to finish low on the table.\nThe club held fortnightly dances at the Municipal Hall in Newmarket. At the June 4 evening the music was provided by Walter Smith's Orchestra who were performing “Old-Time and Jazz”.\nAt the end of the season the team travelled to Hikurangi in a ‘party of 20’. They went by motorcar and played a Northland side on October 11. The players to travel were McLaren, Richard Sloman, O’Donnell, Kerr-Stipney, Iverson, Perry, Alderton, Maher, Green, Ellis, Jones, Shortland, Bracegirdle, Reid, G. Munce, and Ragg, and were accompanied by Archibald Turner. The match was played on Hikurangi Recreation Park with the Northland City team assembled at fairly shirt notice. Willie Shortland and Perry from the Parnell side played for the local team. The Northland side won 25–12 in an open encounter which was said to be the best passing and handling effort seen in the area that season. The Northland side was fairly strong and included several members of the areas full Northland representative team including Rod Hamilton, Claude Hamilton, N Dunn, J. Crackett, Eddie Cunningham, E O’Callaghan, and C O’Callaghan.\n1931 Amalgamation with City Rovers.\nOn April 12 the club held a meeting for all “players and intending players” at Carlaw Park. It was reported in late April that the club had amalgamated with the City Rovers club and that several of their players would be strengthening the ranks of the City first grade side. The management committee of the ARL had been notified by the Parnell secretary, which was now Richard Sloman that the amalgamation had taken place. After the start of the season former Parnell players Kerr and Munce had both debuted for the City senior grade side in the Fox Memorial Shield competition. A.R. Turner became the manager of the City senior side in 1932, and then later in the same year he managed the Auckland team."

        "title": "List of double centuries scored on first-class cricket debut",
        "text": "In cricket, a century is a score of 100 or more runs in a single innings by a batsman. Scores of more than 200 runs are still statistically counted as a century, although these scores are referred to as double century (200–299 runs). A double century is regarded as a landmark score for batsmen and a player's number of double centuries are generally recorded in their career statistics. First-class cricket, the longest version of the game after Test cricket, involves two innings per side in a match and scheduled to last for up to three or more days. An individual scoring a double century on his first-class debut is considered a notable achievement by critics.\nThe first player to score a double century on first-class debut is English batsman Tom Marsden, who scored 227 runs in the second innings. He achieved the feat on 26 July 1826, while playing for Sheffield &amp; Leicester, against Nottingham during the 1826 English cricket season. English batter David Sales made 210 runs in the third innings, while playing for Northamptonshire on 27 July 1996, against Worcestershire during the 1996 County Championship. He did this at the age of 18 years 234 days, becoming the youngest player to score a double hundred on first-class debut, and also in the County Championship. Sakibul Gani of Bihar claimed the highest individual score in an innings on first-class debut till date, scoring 341 runs against Mizoram, on 18 February 2023, during the 2022–23 Ranji Trophy. With this, he also became the first cricketer to hit a triple century on first-class debut. Hanif Kunrai of Kunar Province scored 200 runs off 189 balls, recording the fastest double century in an innings on first-class debut. He set the record on 17 February 2023, while playing against Kandahar Province, during the 2018–19 Mirwais Nika Provincial 3-Day. The highest unbeaten score on first-class debut till date is 267, which has been achieved by Ajay Rohera of Madhya Pradesh in December 2018, against Hyderabad. Indian batsman Gundappa Viswanath made 230 runs on his first-class debut, for Mysore against Andhra in the 1967–68 Ranji Trophy. He also scored 137 runs on his Test debut, against Australia, on 20 November 1969. With this, he became the first and only cricketer to score a double century on first-class debut as well as a century on Test debut.\nThe feat has been accomplished by 25 players on 25 occasions as of December 2023. No batter has been able to score a double hundred in both innings on first-class debut so far. Mike Powell's score of 200* for Glamorgan against Oxford University, in June 1997, is the first and only instance of a player achieving the landmark on a losing cause. 13 players from India have reached the milestone so far, the most for any country in the history."

The first appearance of the women's national team of the Republic of Macedonia in the official international competitions took place only 6 years later during the qualifying tournament of the European Championship 1999 (category \"B\"). In their debut match on May 31, 1998, they defeated Finland 3:1 on the road. The next three games in their group, was the defeating against Turkey twice and one from Greece, and then they withdrew from the competition.\nLater the Macedonian national team only occasionally participated in official international competitions under the auspices of FIVB and CEV. The team has twice participated in the European Championship qualifiers (2001 and 2009), as well as in the 2014 World Championship qualifiers. In the ranking of European national teams, North Macedonia is low ranked. The reason for this is that volleyball in this small European country lags behind the popularity of such game sports like football, handball and basketball."

In 2006, the Gibraltarian hosted one of the group stages of the European Championship qualifying tournament (Small Countries Division) Zone, but they were defeated by the teams of Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, losing both matches with a score of 0:3 and failing to score more than 11 points in any of the 6 sets played.\nAfter a disappointing performance at the 2011 Island Games, where the Gibraltar volleyball team finished in 12th place, the Gibraltar national team did not participate in international competitions for 6 years.\nIn June 2017, the Gibraltar team was once again among the participants in the volleyball tournament of the Island Games held on the Swedish island of Gotland. After suffering 4 defeats in four matches in their preliminary stage group, the Gibraltarians managed to beat the Guernsey national team 3:0 in their last match for the 9th place. It is interesting that the position of the central blocker of the Gibraltar national team for many seasons is played by the president of the national volleyball association Emma Labrador."

On the tour of Argentina later that year, Carson had to withdraw from the 1st Test with sunburn, handing a debut to Phillip Cox. He had to wait until 1980 to regain his place, featuring in another win over the All Blacks in Sydney, with his second half try helping to seal the match. The recall of veteran scrum-half John Hipwell prevented Carson from gaining further caps."

It was her second major singles title. Sabalenka did not lose a set during the tournament, and lost only 31 games in total. Sabalenka became the first player to defend the title since Victoria Azarenka in 2013.\nThis tournament marked the first time in the Open Era that multiple Ukrainians reached the quarterfinals at a singles major. Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska became the first qualifier to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open since Christine Matison in 1978, and the first of any major since Emma Raducanu in the 2021 US Open. Yastremska was also the first Ukrainian, male or female, to reach the semifinals at this major and only the third to do so, at any major, after Elina Svitolina and Andrei Medvedev.\nThe loss of Azarenka to Yastremska in the fourth round guaranteed a first-time major finalist from the top half of the draw; Zheng emerged to become that player. Zheng became the second Chinese player to reach that level at a singles major, after Li Na. Zheng also became the second player in the Open Era to beat six unseeded players en route to the final after Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in 1995, and the third player to do so at any major (after Sánchez Vicario and Martina Hingis at 1996 and 1997 Wimbledon, respectively, with still the 16 seeds draw in place). By reaching the final, Zheng made her debut in the top ten of the WTA rankings, at No. 7.\nFor the first time in the tournament's history, there were six former champions in the main draw: Sabalenka, Naomi Osaka, Sofia Kenin, Caroline Wozniacki, Angelique Kerber, and Azarenka.\nThe defeat of world No. 1 Iga Świątek by Linda Nosková in the third round marked the earliest loss by a top seed at the Australian Open since 1979, and the first time that the top seed failed to make the round of 16 since the tournament became a 128-player draw in 1988. Nosková was the first teenager to defeat a world No. 1 at a major since Petra Kvitová defeated Dinara Safina at the 2009 US Open. The five top-10 seeds to reach the third round were the fewest since 1988. Only seven seeded players reached the fourth round; this was the worst performance by seeded players since the draw was expanded to 128 players in 1988, and the worst overall since 1985.\nElena Rybakina and Anna Blinkova played the longest tiebreak in a major singles match in the final set of their second-round match. Blinkova won the tiebreak 22–20. \nThis marked the final Australian Open appearance of 2022 finalist Danielle Collins, as she announced that 2024 would be the final year of her career. She lost to Świątek in the second round.\nSeeded players.\nThe following are the seeded players. Seedings are based on WTA rankings as of 8 January 2024.

The Waco Indians were immediately preceded in minor league play by the 1919 Waco Navigators, who ended the tenure of Waco Texas League teams.\nAfter a three-season hiatus, minor league baseball returned to Waco in 1923, as the Waco Indians became charter members of the six-team Class D level Texas Association.

Waco ended the season a record of 59–80, placing sixth in the Texas Association standings. Playing under managers Ray Falk, H. House, Bill Reynolds and Warwick Comstock, Waco finished 20.5 games behind the first place Mexia Gushers in the final standings.

Waco finished 18.0 games behind the first place Corsicana Oilers in the final standings as the league held no playoffs. After departing Waco during the season, Otto McIvor became manager of the Austin Rangers.\nJoining another league, Waco did not return to the Texas Association and were replaced by the Terrell Terrors franchise in the six-team league.\nWaco, Texas continued minor league play in 1925 in a new league, as the Waco Cubs began another tenure of Waco teams in rejoining the Class A level Texas League. The Class A level was the highest level of minor leagues in the era\nThe ballpark.\nThe Waco Indians teams hosted home games at Katy Park. The ballpark began hosting minor league teams in 1905 with the Waco Tigers and continued as a minor league ballpark through 1956, with the Waco Pirates of the Big State League as the final team. The ballpark was located adjacent to Cotton Place Fairgrounds. It was of the Baylor Stadium in the era and was located at Jackson Avenue &amp; South 7th Street at Webster Avenue &amp; South 8th Street in Waco, Texas.\nWhen Katy Park opened for baseball on April 6, 1905, President Teddy Roosevelt was on hand and gave a speech at the ballpark.\nIn 1929, Babe Ruth and the New York Yankees played an exhibition game at the ballpark against the Waco Cubs.\nOn May 5, 1930, the first night baseball game in Texas took place at Katy Park in a contest between the Negro leagues' Kansas City Monarchs and the local Waco Black Cardinals, utilizing the Monarchs' portable light system. The Monarchs won the game by the score 8–0.\nThe original ballpark was razed in the 1960s and became a parking lot. In 2020, the former ballpark site became a part of the \"Magnolia Market at the Silos\" and was returned to a ballpark. The new ballpark at the site is called \"Katy Ballpark at the Silos.\""

The winners were Denmark, Norway and Sweden.\nBidding timeline.\nThe bidding timeline was as follows:\nBids.\nOn 11 May 2021 it was announced that the following nations sent in an official expression of interest:\nOn 20 October, the final bids were presented. The Switzerland bid was withdrawn, leaving the Scandinavian bid unopposed.\nDenmark, Norway and Sweden.\nThe Scandinavians decided to all bid for an EHF Euro together for the first time ever, under the slogan Scandinavia Connect. Their bids' aim is to use innovation and modern-day technologies to help Handball have a bright future.\nThe Swedish Handball Federation president, Frederik Rapp, stated “the commitment to finding sustainable solutions across all industries and areas of life is very clear in all of Scandinavia. To connect the Scandinavian approach and experience in sustainability with European handball is so valuable. Finding more sustainable solutions for future events could be a real game-changer for the future of our sport”.\nWhile the Danish counterpart, Per Bertelsen said “We believe we can build on the positive momentum we see in our sport. Together, we can deliver a world-class event that will be a true celebration for European handball”.\nThe main round would be held in Malmö and either Copenhagen or Herning. The final weekend would be in the Jyske Bank Boxen in Herning. Every other venue will host preliminary round matches.\nThese are the following 9 venues included in the Scandinavian bid:\nDenmark\nNorway\nSweden\nVenue that was deemed not suitable for tournament and is no longer part of the bid:\nWithdrawn bids.\nSwitzerland.\nBefore joining up with Spain and Portugal, Switzerland submitted a solo bid, under the slogan New heights For Handball. The preliminary round would be in Basel, Lausanne and Zürich, while the main round groups would be in Lausanne and Zürich. The final weekend would be held in Geneva. Every venue met the EHF's requirements. The Swiss' solo bid ended since Switzerland joined the Spain and Portugal bid for 2028.\nThe 5 venues that were proposed for Switzerland's bid are the following:\nFrance and Switzerland.\nIn August 2020, France and Switzerland first stated an interest to applied to be the hosts of the 2026 and 2028 European Men's Handball Championship. While later, in October 2020, the French Handball Federation officially announced their intent to submit a joint bid with Switzerland. However, the bid quietly failed to materialise and Switzerland applied as a solo bid.\nBelarus, Lithuania and Poland.\nAs early as the 29 October 2018, Belarus and Poland considered bidding together. Then, on 19 February 2019, information was learnt stating that a joint bid from Belarus, Lithuania and Poland was in the works. On 18 September 2019, president of the Belarusian federation, Vladimir Konoplev, stated that he would try and get support from the post-Soviet countries, Lithuania would lobby for the Scandinavian countries' support, and Poland would receive Central Europe's support. Their bid was included in the list of nations that were interested in bidding. However, their bid deteriorated due to tensions between Belarus and the others two countries and their bid was not included as an official candidate for the 2026 EHF Euro.\nOther countries.\nThe following country stated an interest to the EHF, but they never made a formal bid and very few details were shared about their application:\nHost selection.\nAs only the Scandinavian bid remained it was unanimously selected at the 14th EHF Extraordinary Congress on 20 November 2021."

        "title": "Takapuna Rugby League Football Club",
        "text": "Takapuna Rugby League Football Club were a rugby league club in Auckland. They competed from 1921 until 1925. They represented the Takapuna suburb on the North Shore of Auckland.\nHistory.\n1921 Takapuna Rugby League Football Club.\nA club had previously existed in the Takapuna area and was named Pupuke however they only lasted for the 1917 season before ceasing to exist and had no obvious connection to the Takapuna club which formed 4 years later.\nIt was reported at the Auckland Rugby League meeting on March 9, 1921, that “a meeting would be held at Takapuna this evening [March 10] for the purpose of forming a league club there”. On March 12 they posted advertisements in the Auckland Star and New Zealand Herald that they were holding a general meeting on Tuesday, March 15 in the Parish Hall in Takapuna. With all interested and intending players requested to attend. The notice was published by W. Dowle, their honorary secretary. Dowle was Wilfred Wesley Dowle who was aged 21 at the time.\nThe club entered teams in the 5th and 6th grades. The 5th grade side only had 3 games reported with a win and 2 losses. While the 6th grade side playing in the A section had 4 results reported which were all losses. The 5th grade team's first ever match was a preseason game against Kingsland Rovers on April 30 at Takapuna. The club's first ever competition games were on May 7 with both the 5th and 6th grade teams both playing at Takapuna. The 6th grade team played at 2pm against City Rovers with Mr. Belcham refereeing. They lost the match 16–0. While the 5th grade team played their neighbouring club, North Shore Albions at 3pm but the result was not reported. The 5th grades first reported result was in their second match against Otahuhu on May 14, losing 7 to 2. Their only reported win came at the Auckland Domain #2 field against Manukau on July 23 when they won 5–0 with a try to Hyland which was converted by Holmes.\n1922 Fifth grade champions.\nThe 1922 season saw Takapuna only field one team which played in the 5th grade. The team performed particularly well and won the championship, lifting the Endean Memorial Shield in the process. Many results were not reported during the year however of the results reported Takapuna won 7 and lost 1 of the games that had results submitted to the newspapers. At the start of the season they held practices at the Show Grounds with their last preseason practice on April 29. Their honorary secretary was still Wilfred Dowle. The showgrounds were located close to the present day Takapuna Golf Course.\nThey began the year with a 13–2 win over Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers on May 6 at Northcote which was based at Stafford Park at this time. They then had wins over Richmond on May 13 by 17 points to 5, before a default win over Marist Old Boys on May 20. They beat Manukau 12–11 on June 10 and then beat Ponsonby United 12-0 a week later. On July 15 they defeated Marist 14–0 with the scorers reported. They were Paul, Petit, Gibbons, and Sweetman. On July 22 they lost to Richmond 8–3 with Holmes scoring their try however the league ordered the match to be replayed. The ARL said “an appeal by Richmond against a decision of the junior committee that the fifth grade game Richmond v. Takapuna be replayed was upheld, on the ground that the question was on a matter of fact in which the referee's decision must be held to be final”. On August 5 Takapuna beat Manukau 16-8 however the Manukau club appealed the decision of the junior management committee not to grant a replay of the match and the management committee agreed with a replay ordered. No reason was given for the appeal.\nOn August 26 the club got to play most likely its first ever game on Carlaw Park which had been opened the previous season. The match was their rescheduled game against Manukau on the number 2 field at 2pm with Mr. Rogers refereeing. The following week Takapuna played Richmond in the match to decide the championship at Carlaw Park no. 1 at 1.45pm. The game was the curtain raiser to the Auckland match against South Auckland. The result of the game was not reported.\nA Cadet competition was also being held involving military cadets and A team from Takapuna joined the competition mid season on July 8. They played 9 games but only had 2 results reported which were both losses.\n1923 Fifth grade.\nThe 1923 season saw Takapuna only field one team again which was once more their fifth grade side. This year they finished runners up to their rivals Richmond. Takapuna won 9 games with a draw and 3 losses and didn't compete in the knockout competition at the end of the season. They held their annual meeting at Greenwood's Gymnasium at Hall's Corner on Thursday, March 29. Their honorary secretary was W. Allen. Then on the 31st of May they held “an important general meeting” in the Takapuna Borough Council Chambers with the notice posted by honorary secretary J. Wilson. On June 9 they defeated Richmond 9–0 with Warman, Stewart, and Paul scoring tries for Takapuna. The following week their team list for their upcoming game against Newton Rangers was published. Previously they had never done this. The team was Wilson (2), Holmes (2), Warman (2), Davis, Polkinghorne, Coleman, Gibbons, Stewart, Ogilvie, Hicks, Cruther, Paul, and Morrison. Takapuna won the game 9–0 at the Auckland Domain with Stewart scoring 2 tries and W. Wilson 1. A week later they beat Northcote 6–3 with Holmes and Coleman scoring their 2 tries.\nAt the conclusion of the championship the New Zealand Herald published the points of the respective leading teams: “the fifth grade competition has been won by Richmond 20 points, with Takapuna, 19 points, second. City, 16, and Newton, 14, are next in order”. The season was somewhat controversial however as Takapuna contested a loss to Richmond a week earlier by 7 points to 0. On August 22 it was reported that “an appeal was received from the Takapuna club against the finding of the junior management committee in a protest against the Richmond fifth grade team on the ground that the Richmond team had played a man who had not been regraded from a higher grade. The finding of the Junior Management Committee was upheld”. They were not finished however and protested once more with it being sent to the Junior Board to be forwarded to the New Zealand Rugby League on September 19. The New Zealand Rugby League then dismissed the protest the following week for “being out of order”.\nAt the conclusion of the season the club held a general meeting on November 22 at Marshall's Billiard Saloon. Their honorary secretary J. Wilson advertised the meeting.\n1924 (Fourth Grade).\nIn 1924 the Takapuna club promoted their solitary team to the 4th grade. They struggled in the competition and in July withdrew when they had 1 win, 1 draw, and 4 losses. Their annual meeting was at Marshall's Billiard Saloon on March 6.\nAt the beginning of the season the Auckland Rugby League applied for permission to play games at the Takapuna Racecourse (on the centre field). They were however sent a letter from the Takapuna Jockey Club that no grounds would be available or the season for football.\nTakapuna's first game of the season was against the newly former United Suburbs club at Birkenhead on May 11. They won by 11 points to 5 at Takapuna. Their team had been published in the Auckland Star prior to the match and was: Richards, Ogilvie, Coleman, Gassey, Davies, Edwards, Warman, Paul, Polkinghorne (2), Hicks, Tatton, Gibbons, Thomas, Morrison, Bennett, Sherritt, and Lawrence. On June 14 they played Parnell at Carlaw Park as one of the curtain raisers to the Auckland game against the touring Australian University side. They began to seriously struggle at this point of the season losing to Ellerslie 29–3 at the Ellerslie Racecourse ground. Then on July 12 they were thrashed by Ponsonby United 59–0 at Birkenhead. Every single member of the Ponsonby side reportedly scored and this was the last match of the season which Takapuna played. They were drawn to play Marist the following week at the Outer Domain but no result was reported and they were not drawn to play any further fixtures.\n1925 Takapuna Pacific.\nIn 1925 the Takapuna club failed to field a team however late in the year a \"Takapuna Pacific\" side entered the 4th grade competition featuring several of the Takapuna players from the previous season. It is unclear if they were the same club however given the Auckland Rugby League made no mention of a new club being registered they were most likely ostensibly the same club. Their team to play on 8 August was Wheatley, Herbert, S. Wagstaff, T. Blomfield, Brawn, Patrick, R. Webster, Cryer, L. Wagstaff, Hyland, Neville, Overington, Bennett, Chester, C. Stewart, Warman, T. Webster, and Hawera. They played Ponsonby in the 4th grade knockout competition on August 15 and lost 23–0 at Takapuna. In other team lists \"L. Crutcher\", \"Veitch\", \"Patrick\", \"R Smith\", and \"Nicholson\" were named.\nOn September 19 they were thrashed by Athletic 40-3"

        "text": "Frank Milton Duncan (born November 16, 1956) is an American former professional football player who was a safety for the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the San Francisco State Gators, earning All-American honors in Division II in 1978. Duncan was selected by the Chargers in the 12th round of the 1979 NFL Draft. After playing three seasons with San Diego, he played three more in the United States Football League (USFL) with the Oakland Invaders and New Jersey Generals.\nEarly life.\nBorn in San Francisco, Duncan attended Jefferson High School in Daly City, California. He played college ball as a strong safety at San Francisco State University. As a senior in 1978, Duncan was only a second-team all-conference selection in the Far West Conference, though he was named a Division II All-American. He played in the East–West Shrine Game, recording a game-high 11 tackles.\nProfessional career.\nDuncan was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the 12th round of the 1979 NFL Draft with the 321st overall pick. Their final pick of the draft, Duncan thought his chances were \"slim\" to make the team. After the Chargers told him that he had been waived on August 27, 1979, he went home and began packing. However, he was re-signed by San Diego the next day. Injured veterans Louie Kelcher and Doug Wilkerson, for whom the team had cleared room on their 45-man roster, were then placed on injured reserve, opening space. \"Some day [Duncan] will be a starter, and not too long\", predicted Chargers head coach Don Coryell.\nIn Duncan's first two seasons with the Chargers, he played 19 games without a start. He missed 12 games as a rookie in 1979 due to back and ankle injuries. Playing on special teams in 1980, his 74 combined blocks and tackles on special teams coverage were second on the team behind Hank Bauer. In 1981, new San Diego defensive coordinator Jack Pardee named four new starters on defense. Only the cornerbacks remained the same in the secondary, with Duncan and Bob Gregor replacing Pete Shaw and Mike Fuller as safeties. In week 2 against Detroit, Duncan stepped in front of the Lions' Freddie Scott and intercepted a pass from Gary Danielson at the Chargers' one-yard line with one second remaining in the game, preserving a 28–23 win for San Diego. In October, Duncan was placed on injured reserve after spraining his ankle against Baltimore. He was cut by the Chargers prior to the start of the 1982 season. He then played in the USFL for the Oakland Invaders and New Jersey Generals.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1995, Duncan was convicted of felony battery and a misdemeanor battery charge in an attack of his girlfriend during an argument in his parents' home in Daly City. He was sentenced to eight years in prison."

The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs will advance to the next round. If the aggregate score is level at the end of normal time of the second leg, extra time will be played, and if the same number of goals is scored by both teams during extra time, the tie will be decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nThe video assistant referee (VAR) will be used in the third qualifying round and the play-off round.\nIn the draws for each round, teams will be seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots containing the same number of teams.

As the identity of the winners of the previous round may not known at the time of the draws, the seeding will be carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advances to the subsequent round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient advances, it will simply take the seeding of its opponent.

On 20 June 2018, the day the host was supposed to be confirmed, the EHF voted to delay the awardment of the hosting rights.\nSecond bidding process.\nIn April 2019, the EHF reopened the bidding process. On the 20 September 2019, there were 3 new bids.\nAustria, Hungary and Switzerland.\nIn June 2019, the Hungarians first stated an interest in bidding, and had already started negotiations with Austria and Switzerland. Austria and Switzerland are vying to host the event for the first time, while Hungary are trying to it for the third time, after 2004 and 2014. Their slogan is Stronger together.\nThe main rounds would be in Debrecen and Budapest, with the final weekend in the MVM Dome in Budapest.\nThese are the proposed venues:\nAustria\nHungary\nSwitzerland\nCzech Republic, Poland and Slovakia.\nCzech Republic, Poland and Slovakia filed an application, under the slogan So close. All three have never hosted an EHF Women's Euro.\nThe main rounds would be in Bratislava and Katowice, while the final weekend would be in Kraków. The rest will host preliminary round matches.\nThese are the proposed venues:\nCzech Republic\nPoland\nSlovakia\nRussia.\nRussia is asking to be the organisers of the EHF Women's Euro, which they have never hosted. Venues in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Krasnodar and Rostov-on-Don have been proposed for the championship. Although, two weeks later, the Krylatskoye Sports Palace in Moscow and the Basket-Hall in Krasnodar were both taken out as the EHF weren't impressed with the arenas. The Irina Viner-Usmanova Gymnastics Palace in Moscow and the Sportcomplex Zvezdny in Astrakhan replaced them.\nThe main round groups would be held in the Sibur Arena and VTB Arena, with the final weekend in Moscow at the VTB Arena.\nThese were the proposed venues in Russia's bid:\nVenue which was originally included, but taken out:\nHost selection.\nThe host announcement took place on 25 January 2020 at the EHF Extraordinary Congress in Stockholm. The winners were Austria, Hungary and Switzerland, who defeated the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia bid, 28–21, in the second round.\nPossible hosting change.\nOn 12 January 2023, the Hungarian government's chancellery minister, Gergely Gulyás, announced that Hungary would withdraw as hosts due to financial reasons. A few days prior, the Austrian Handball Federation was informed by the Hungarians about the decision to withdraw. The other co-hosts, Austria and Switzerland, now wanted to negotiate with the EHF about how the tournament will be held. On 28 January, the European Handball Federation released a statement concerning the issue, and said that they were amazed and surprised with the decision to potentially withdraw as co-hosts. On 16 March 2023, the EHF announced a change to the organisation structure of the championships. Hungary remained as a co-host, but played a reduced part in the hosting of the competition, including the whole portion of the tournament at the MVM Dome in Budapest (one main round group and the final weekend) being axed and replaced by Vienna. During all the uncertainty, Romania had stated that they would be able to host the tournament if the original hosts could not."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Vermont",
        "text": "Vermont has a long history with ice hockey in the United States. Despite the state's sparse population, its location in New England placed Vermont in the middle of ice hockey circles, particularly at the college level.\nHistory.\nThe close proximity to Canada afforded Vermont with a very close view of ice hockey as far back as the 19th century. Several local clubs were arranged but nothing formal occurred until 1909. One of those amateur teams was put together by a group of students at Norwich University. After garnering some interest from the student body, the school gave its blessing to the program and the first sanctioned team in Vermont hit the ice the following year. Unfortunately, a lack of facilities left the Cadets scrambling to find available ice and eventually forced the program to be suspended in 1913. After World War I, ice hockey returned to the state when Middlebury began its men's program. They were joined that season by Saint Michael's which, aside from cutting down on travel costs, provided each with a local rival. With an increasing number of rinks in the state, Norwich was able to secure a home venue and return in 1925. That same year, the state's flagship university, Vermont also hit the ice, giving the state a solid foundation with the sport. However, after the great depression the cost of business became too much. During the 1930s, Norwich, Vermont and Saint Michael's were each forced to suspend operations. Only Middlebury was able to carry on through the difficulties.\nEventually the financial situation improved and Norwich returned to the ice by the end of the 30s. Just as the others were considering revivals of their own, World War II broke out and all programs were mothballed in the early 40s. Once the war had ended, Middlebury and Norwich restarted in short order with Saint Michael's making an abortive attempt in the 50s. The Catamounts, however, did not get back onto the ice until the 1960s. Despite the long wait, the team was very successful in its return, winning three league championships over a 5-year span. Vermont promoted its program to the top division in 1974 and has remained there ever since, albeit with less success. In the meantime, Middlebury flited with a championship in the late 1970s, however, because the school was a member of NESCAC, they were forbidden from playing in national tournaments. Despite that barrier, ice hockey in Vermont was flourishing in the late 70s and eventually the granite state became a foursome once more when Saint Michael's was able to bring its team back in 1982.\nIn the mid-90s, the NESCAC changed its rules and finally allowed its member school to participate in national tournaments. Within a year, Middlebury won its first championship and proceeded to win the next four as well. The Panthers became the first team in college hockey history to win five consecutive championships. Spurred on by their long-time rival, Norwich was able to win its first championship in 2000, ending Middlebury's run. In the first decade of the 21st century, five additional Division III national titles were won by Middlebury and Norwich, making the state the center of D-III ice hockey.\nThe success of the men's programs led to increased interest from other quarters. Middlebury was the first Division II or III college to found a women's team, playing its inaugural season in 1981. The other Vermont schools were slower on the uptake but by 2006 each of them was sporting a women's program as well. With so much college hockey going on in the state, eventually the sport spilled over into different branches. Vermont high schools had long sported varsity programs but the state did not receive its first formal junior team until 2000. The Green Mountain Glades were members of the Eastern Junior Hockey League, a Tier III league, and survived for over a decade before relocating to Maine. Two years after their departure, a second low-level junior team arrived. The Vermont Lumberjacks continued to call the state home, as of 2023, and have been relatively successful on the ice.\nIn terms of professional hockey, Vermont has seen very little interest. With the state's most populous city being Burlington at just north of 44,000 residents (ranked 870th in the nation in 2020), Vermont just doesn't have enough people to support a pro team. To date, only one attempt was made and it proved to be rather disastrous; the Vermont Wild played during the fall of 2011. At the start the team performed about as well as could be expected for an expansion team but their attendance figures were woeful. Playing out of the 1,000-seat Green Mountain Arena, the Wild only could get about 1/4 of the venue filled. The showing was so dismal that the team only played 10 of their scheduled 53 games before folding.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nNotable players by city.\nVermont has a very high level of engagement with ice hockey. In 2022, 0.663% of the population was registered with USA Hockey, or about 1 in every 150 people. That was good enough for 4th in the nation, ahead of traditional hotbeds like Massachusetts and Michigan. With the state's low overall population that only translates to approximately 4,000 people, however, that hasn't stopped several Vermont natives from making a name in the sport."

        "text": "Golf House Tennessee is the name given to an ante-bellum house in the suburbs of Nashville, Tennessee that serves as home of the non-profit \"Tennessee Golf Foundation\". It houses the offices all of the state's golf associations. The historic house is the focal point of a sprawling complex that administers amateur golf, professional golf, women's golf, junior golf, turfgrass research, and the Tennessee Golf Hall of Fame, among others. \nIn the late 1980s, Tennessee's amateur golf organization and its professional golf organization were competitors, and their relations were often antagonistic. A particular bone of contention was over which group would secure the potential profits in computerized golf handicapping services. After years of squabbles and frosty relations, an executive, Dick Horton, who had worked for each of these two organizations, with intimate knowledge of both, was able to convince them of advantages of merging operations. The concept, begun about in 1990, required extraordinary fundraising efforts because neither of the merging entities had much money. Philanthropic aid from Jack Lupton and Vince Gill was vital. The project's success in Nashville drew national attention, and served as a model that was later adopted by several U.S. States. The amateurs consisited of the TGA (Tennessee Golf Association); the professionals consisted of the PGA Tennessee (branch of the Professional Golf Association). The combination became the \"Tennessee Golf Foundation\", which began operations in the Golf House Tennessee facility in 1995. In 2000, the TGA(men) and WTGA (Women's Tennessee Golf Association) merged, making one governing body at Golf House Tennessee for all amateur golf in the state.\nThe Golf House Tennessee complex includes:\nFunding.\nChattanooga philanthropist and Coca-Cola heir Jack Lupton pledged $5 million to the project, provided that the foundation would raise money from other sources that would create an endowment fund. Thus, the Tennessee Golf Foundation, a non-profit, was incorporated in 1990 with Dick Horton as president.\nCountry Music Hall of Fame member Vince Gill played a vital role in the success of Golf House Tennessee. Gill, a scratch golfer, became very interested in raising funds for the foundation. He began hosting an annual golf tournament in 1993 known as \"The Vinny\" (The Vinny Pro-Celebrity Golf Invitational), whose primary beneficiary is the Tennessee Golf Foundation. As of 2018, tournament had raised over $8 million for Junior Golf to pay for staffing of the golf academy and for \"The First Tee\" projects and the Vince Gill Junior Tour. Gill received the PGA Distinguished Service Award in 2003, the PGA's highest honor."

        "text": "The 1924–25 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey season was the 5th season of play for the program. The Terriers were coached by Chippy Gaw in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter an abysmal season the year before, the athletic department decided to hire a new coach and were able to get Chippy Gaw from Princeton. Gaw's success with the Tigers recommended him for the job, however, the team did not get off to the best start. The first game with MIT was a hard-fought battle that with Goldfine scoring the first goal of the season. Julius Kontoff sandwiched a pair of goal around a MIT marker while the elder Kontoff and Viano held back the Engineers. However, with less than 2 minutes remaining, Tech was able to tie the match for a third time and send it into overtime. Neither squad could score in the 10 minutes that followed and the game was declared a draw. After both sides had agreed to a rematch later in the year, BU ran into the buzz saw that was Harvard. After a slow first period, BU began to play Harvard physically, hoping to get the Crimson off of their game. Harvard responded in kind and the rest of the game saw a consistent march to the penalty box. At one time in the third period, five players were sitting in the sin bin. Unfortunately for BU, the tactic didn't work and the Crimson were able to solve the Terriers' defense 6 times en route to a comfortable win. Viano netted the lone goal for BU in the match. Just before the winter break, BU renewed hostilities with their inaugural opponent, Boston College. Don Martin was the star of the game, turning aside every salvo from the Eagles while a solo rush from Viano ended up netting the first game-winner on the year.\nOnce the players returned from the break, they het the road for a 2-game swing through New York. Hamilton, one of the strongest teams in the country, proved too much for the Terriers. The offense faltered and was unable to get a single goal in the game. As if to makeup for the lack of scoring, the following night forward unit finally earned their stripes when Lawless and Scott each recorded a pair to lead the team to a 7–2 win. The victory proved to be a turning point for the program as it started the first winning streak in program history. The next game saw Scott and Ling with two goals apiece to mark the first time the program had won consecutive games in its history.\nThe rematch with MIT was just as close as the first, despite the absence of the Kontoff brothers, but the game saw Gregoire come into his own by netting both goals in the 2–1 win. At the end of the month, BU went on another journey through New York but this time was able to come back unscathed with wins against Army and Briarcliff Lodge. Captain Morey Kontoff was still away from the team when it took on New Hampshire in early February but the team didn't appear to notice as they easily handed the Wildcats, who were hampered by a lack of practice. Gregoire's hat-trick led the way for the team's sixth consecutive win. The game was also notable for the debut of Martin on the defense.\nWith the team already assured of their best season in program history, the team faced a very tough challenge in its final two games. With Martin back in the cage, the team played host to the Elis and their defense was tested throughout the game. Morey Kontoff, who was finally back with the club, opened the scoring in the first. The Terrier defense then set up a nigh-impenetrable wall for the remainder of the game and turned aside a myriad of Bulldogs chances. Yale's offense was too powerful to completely stop but BU held the Elis' to just 2 goals on the night. Unfortunately, the Yale defense was equally impressive and with Kontoff's marker being the only goal that the Terriers could get, the team fell to the eventual Intercollegiate Champions. Boston University ended the year with a rematch against BC and the Eagles were looking for revenge. Martin was again the star of the game, however, this time he was bested by Boston College. The Terrier offense never got going in the match and the team was shutout for the second time on the year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The team is a member of the Atlantic University Sport conference and compete in U Sports. The team plays their home games at the J. Louis Levesque Arena in Moncton, New Brunswick.\nHistory.\nJust 2 years after the founding of the Université de Moncton, the school began sponsoring men's ice hockey as a varsity sport. The Aigles Bleus (Blue Eagles) had a difficult time getting off the ground, remaining at or near the bottom of the standings for their first 8 seasons. 1973 saw not only the program's first winning season but also its first playoff appearance. The team steadily built itself into a power over the remainder of the decade and won four consecutive league championships in the early 1980s. During that stretch, the Aigles won back-to-back national championships, the second of which came in front of their home fans. For the rest of the 20th century, Moncton was one of the top colleges in the Maritimes, winning five more AUAA titles and 2 more national crowns.\nSince the start of the 21st century, Moncton has come back to earth. Since they won two league titles in the mid 00s, the team had been a middling program and has produced more losing seasons than winning ones.\nSt. Joseph's.\nThe University of Moncton was formed by the amalgamation of three colleges in 1963. One of those three schools, the University of St. Joseph's College, had previous fielded a varsity ice hockey team. The records for St. Joseph's are incomplete and muddled as the program also competed as a senior team during their existence.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSt. Joseph's.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\"\nMoncton.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\"\nSee also.\nMoncton Aigles Bleues women's ice hockey"

The statues are located in Buffalo (in front of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery), Trujillo (in the \"Plaza Mayor\") and Lima (in the \"Parque de La Muralla\"). The latter two cities are Pizarro's places of birth and death, respectively.\nThe statues represent the conquistador Francisco Pizarro mounted on a horse and dressed for fighting with armor and sword. Pizarro is famous for having led the Conquest of Peru in the 16th century and having founded the city of Lima on January 18, 1535, establishing what would become the Viceroyalty of Peru.\nStatues.\nStatue in Buffalo.\nIt was the first of the statues to be made. Cast in Paris in 1910 using the lost wax technique by the French master Marcello Valsuani, caster of works by artists such as Renoir and Picasso. The work measures just under 1.80 m in height and can currently be admired on the front of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, an institution to which it was donated by the artist and his wife.\nStatue in Trujillo.\nThe equestrian statue of Francisco Pizarro located in Trujillo, province of Cáceres, was exhibited in the Dome Room of the \"Grand Palais\" in Paris in 1927 and later moved to the conqueror's hometown. It was presented on June 2, 1929, in the atrium of the Church of San Martín in the Plaza Mayor, in an event in which the then dictator and president of the government, General Miguel Primo de Rivera and Prince Alfonso de Orleans were present, as well as the then United States ambassador to Spain and the Peruvian minister plenipotentiary, Eduardo S. Leguía. The space for its placement was chosen by the sculptor's widow, who traveled years before, in April 1925, to Spain for this purpose.\nStatue in Lima.\nThe statue of Lima was inaugurated on January 18, 1935, on the occasion of the celebration of the fourth centennial of the founding of the city. The sculpture was a donation from the sculptor Rumsey's widow and had arrived from New York City. The statue's original location was the atrium of the Lima Cathedral.\nIn 1952 it was moved to the Plaza Pizarro, and in 2003 it was relocated to \"Parque de La Muralla\", without the pedestal with which it was inaugurated and that it had throughout its history, being placed on a concrete base.\nHistorical discrepancies.\nThere are certain elements that make one doubt that the conquistador Pizarro is faithfully represented by the rider of the statue or, at least, that it is a historically correct sculpture.

        "text": "The 2024 Japanese Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 MSC Cruises Japanese Grand Prix 2024) was a Formula One motor race held on 7 April 2024 at the Suzuka International Racing Course in Suzuka, Japan. It was the fourth round of the 2024 Formula One World Championship. It was won by polesitter Max Verstappen driving for Red Bull, with teammate Sergio Pérez and Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz Jr. behind him. Yuki Tsunoda of RB scored a point, the first Japanese Formula One driver to do so at their home race since the 2012 edition of the race.\nBackground.\nThe event was held across the weekend of 5–7 April at the Suzuka International Racing Course in Suzuka for the 34th time in the circuit's history. The Grand Prix was the fourth round of the 2024 Formula One World Championship and the 49th running of the Japanese Grand Prix. The edition was the first time that the event was held as an early-season round, a departure from its traditional schedule between September and November. The move was part of Formula One's regionalisation efforts, which put the Japanese Grand Prix between the Australian and Chinese Grands Prix.\nChampionship standings.\nAhead of the weekend race, Max Verstappen led the Drivers' Championship with 51 points, four points from Charles Leclerc in second, and five from his teammate Sergio Pérez in third. Red Bull Racing led the Constructors' Championship with 97 points, separated from Ferrari by 4 points and from McLaren by 42, in second and third, respectively.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race. Ayumu Iwasa made his Formula One practice debut for RB, driving in place of Daniel Ricciardo in the first free practice session.\nTyre choices.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C1, C2, and C3 tyre compounds (the three hardest in their range) designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively, for teams to use at the event.\nPractice.\nThree free practice sessions were held for the event. The first free practice session was held on 5 April 2024, at 11:30 local time (UTC+9), and was topped by Red Bull driver Max Verstappen ahead of his teammate Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz Jr. of Ferrari. The session was red-flagged after Williams' Logan Sargeant lost control of his car and hit the wall, breaking his front wing. The second free practice session was held on the same day, at 15:00 local time, and was topped by Mclaren's Oscar Piastri ahead of Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes and Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. The damp conditions prevented most drivers from completing a run, and only five set competitive lap times. The third free practice session was held on 6 April 2024, at 11:30 local time, and was topped by Verstappen ahead of his teammate Pérez and George Russell of Mercedes.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was held on 6 April 2024, at 15:00 local time (UTC+9).\nRace.\nThe race was held on 7 April 2024, at 14:00 local time (UTC+9), and was run for 53 laps.\nRace report.\nPolesitter Max Verstappen, driving for Red Bull, led the race into the first corner before a crash involving Daniel Ricciardo and Alexander Albon neutralised the race for over twenty minutes while the tyre barriers had to be repaired. Following the red flag period, the race restarted with a standing start on lap three. On lap 12, Sauber driver Zhou Guanyu retired due to a gearbox problem, the third retirement of the race. Verstappen remained unchallenged, eventually making his pit stop on lap 16. This handed the lead of the race to Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, but Verstappen, who had a significant tyre advantage, closed the gap to Leclerc and by lap 20 retook the lead. By that point, it became clear that Leclerc was performing a one-stop strategy on his medium tyres, and swapped to hards by the end of lap 26. Leclerc's one-stop strategy would prove effective, while the Mercedes drivers of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell, who had swapped to hards during the red-flag period, were struggling with tyre degradation. A brief yellow flag period was observed on lap 42, after Logan Sargeant in the sole remaining Williams drove into the gravel at turn 9, but was able to reverse back on track and continue. As the race entered its final laps, Carlos Sainz Jr. overtook Leclerc for the last spot on the podium behind Verstappen's teammate Sergio Pérez. Russell attempted to overtake Oscar Piastri at turn 16 in the closing laps; Piastri temporarily maintained his position, but on the final lap Russell successfully overtook Piastri to finish in seventh. Yuki Tsunoda of RB scored one point in tenth, the first Japanese Formula One driver to score a point at their home race since Kamui Kobayashi's podium at the 2012 Japanese Grand Prix.\nRace classification.\nNotes\nChampionship standings after the race.\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | \n! scope=\"col\" | Constructor\n! scope=\"col\" | Points"

        "title": "2024 Alpine Skiing World Cup – Men's overall",
        "text": "The men's overall in the 2024 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of 35 events in four disciplines: downhill (DH) (8 races), super-G (SG) (7 races), giant slalom (GS) (10 races), and slalom (SL) (10 races). The season was originally scheduled with 45 events, but the first three events of the season (a giant slalom on the glacier at Sölden and two downhills on the Matterhorn) were cancelled due to high winds and heavy snowfall. The cancelled giant slalom was subsequently rescheduled for Aspen on 1 March, and one of the canceled races from Zermatt-Cervinia (the Matterhorn) was rescheduled to Val Gardena/Gröden on 12 December. As discussed under \"Season Summary\" below, there were additional cancellations and reschedulings after the opening races.\nAs is the case every fourth year, there were no other major FIS events (world championships or Olympics) taking place during this season. The fifth and sixth current FIS disciplines, parallel (PAR) and Alpine combined (AC), were eliminated from future World Cup schedules due to a lack of participation or interest in staging these events, and a new event that had been contemplated on the tentative schedule for the season, a team combined (which had been planned for 20 January 2024 at Kitzbühel), was also eliminated and replaced with an additional downhill. Thus, for the second straight season, only the four major disciplines were contested.\nSeason Summary.\nBecause of the three straight cancellations to start the season, the only race held before December 2023 was a slalom at Gurgl, won by the Austrian skier Manuel Feller, who thus held the overall lead. The next three races after that, speed events scheduled for Beaver Creek in the U.S., were also cancelled due to high winds and heavy snowfall, bringing the total to six cancellations with only one race held. When the second race was finally contested, all-discipline skier (and 2021 slalom champion) Marco Schwarz of Austria took over the overall lead by finishing second again, with Feller in second overall. However, the very next race, a slalom, was again cancelled due to overnight rains followed by new snow and high winds, bringing the number of cancelled races to seven (and now including each of the four disciplines).\nThe first speed races were finally held on 14–16 December, and the \"battle of the Marcos\" was finally underway. Swiss two-time defending overall champion Marco Odermatt's two third-place finishes in the first two speed races propelled him past Schwarz, who only managed a fifth, and into the overall lead by 15 points. At Alta Badia, Odermatt extended his dominance in giant slalom to six in a row, winning both races and jumping out to a lead over Schwarz of 92 points, with everyone else at least 250 points down. However, Schwarz's victory in the next race, a slalom (the only discipline in which Odermatt does not compete) moved Schwarz into the overall lead for the season by 8 points. In the very next race, a downhill in Bormio, the \"Battle of the Marcos\" came to an end for the season, when Schwarz suffered a season-ending knee injury, while Odermatt finished second and reclaimed the lead. Odermatt's victory in a super-G the next day gave him the season lead in every discipline except slalom and a lead of almost 400 points over his closest competitor who was still active, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde of Norway. Odermatt continued his season-long giant slalom winning streak at Adelboden, extending his lead over Kilde to over 400 points.\nThe men's tour then headed to the classic courses of Wengen for the Lauberhorn races (two downhills, a super-G, and a slalom) and Kitzbühel for the Hahnenkamm races (two downhills and a slalom). In Wengen, Odermatt increased his lead by winning both downhills and finishing second in the super-G, but the bigger news were season-ending crashes for two former overall season champions: first, in the super-G, Alexis Pinturault of France, and then, in the second downhill, Kilde, which put the second of Odermatt's main rivals out for the season and left Cyprien Sarrazin of France, a former giant slalom skier turned speed specialist, in second place among Odermatt's still-active rivals. In the five speed races in Wengen and Kitzbühel, Sarrazin won three and finished second in the other two, drawing him to within 500 points of Odermatt – but no closer, because Odermatt won the other two, finished second twice and third once, thus allowing Sarrazin an overall gain of only 40 points. When Odermatt won the super-G at Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Sarrazin failed to finish, Odermatt's lead over Sarrazin in the overall championship went back over 600 points. Odermatt also won the giant slalom at Bansko, while the slalom scheduled the next day was rained out and not rescheduled.\nUnfortunately for Sarrazin, he then became the latest skier to suffer an injury, this time in training, which forced him to miss at least the next two speed races on the World Cup circuit and for all intents and purposes ended his chances to catch Odermatt. After the races in Kvitfjell, with only 11 races (maximum 1,100 points) remaining in the season, Odermatt held a lead of over 900 points against all competitors. When Odermatt then won the next race, a giant slalom at Palisades Tahoe, USA (his 10th consecutive victory in the discipline), he clinched the overall championship for the season -- his third straight -- with a month (10 races) still to go. The following week at Aspen, Odermatt won two more giant slaloms, but the best performance of the weekend was turned in by his Swiss teammate Loïc Meillard, who placed second in both giant slaloms and then won the slalom on Sunday to move into third place overall for the season, just 3 points behind slalom season champion Manuel Feller. However, the last races before the finals, the technical races scheduled for Kranjska Gora, were cancelled due to a lack of snow (giant slalom) and heavy rains (slalom), which pushed the showdown for second place to the finals.\nFinals.\nThe last events of the season are scheduled for the World Cup finals at Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria. This season, for the first time, the finals will take place over two weekends—16-17 March 2024 for the technical events and 22–24 March 2024 for the speed events—with the last race for the men (the downhill) taking place on Sunday, 24 March. Only the top 25 in each discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship in each discipline are eligible to compete in the finals, with the exception that any skier who has scored at least 500 points in the overall classification is eligible to participate in any discipline, regardless of his standing in that discipline for the season. However, only six racers (Odermatt, Feller, Meillard, Sarrazin, former overall champion Henrik Kristoffersen, and speed specialist Vincent Kriechmayr) were able to reach that 500-point threshold prior to the finals. Due to the reduced field, only the top 15 in each discipline will earn World Cup points.\nComing into the finals, Odermatt, with 9 victories in giant slalom and 2 in each of downhill and Super-G, had already tied the all-time men's record of victories in a season with 13. However, while leading the giant slalom final during his second run, Odermatt missed a gate, handing the victory (and overall second place for now) to his Swiss teammate Loïc Meillard. Meillard then finished fourth in slalom and second in super-G to clinch second place for the season, relegating Feller to third. Finally, continuing the season-long string of cancellations, the downhill final was also cancelled due to heavy snow and winds, meaning that ten men's races were cancelled and not made up during the season. However, the cancellation gave Odermatt the season title in downhill, and he had already won the titles in super-G and giant slalom, meaning that Odermatt became the fourth man to win four season-long titles, joining Jean-Claude Killy (1967), Pirmin Zurbriggen (1987, who won five titles if combined were included), and Hermann Maier (2000, 2001)."

        "title": "2024 Alpine Skiing World Cup – Men's downhill",
        "text": "The men's downhill in the 2024 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of eight events. The season had been planned with thirteen downhills, but two scheduled downhills on 11/12 November 2023 on the Matterhorn, running from Switzerland (Zermatt) into Italy (Cervinia), were canceled for the second straight year, this time due to heavy snowfall and high winds (unlike the year before, when the cancellation was due to lack of snow), and only one has been rescheduled (at Val Gardena on 12 December). The two downhill races after that, scheduled in the U.S. at Beaver Creek, Colorado, were also cancelled for the same reason, although they still may be rescheduled—meaning that the downhill season had not completed a race as of early December despite having had four scheduled, with the next attempt being the rescheduled race at Val Gardena/Gröden. One of the Beaver Creek races was rescheduled at Wengen on 11 January 2024. As described in the season summary, two February downhills at Chamonix, France were cancelled later in the season, reducing the total races in the discipline to nine. In the last race of the World Cup season, the final was also cancelled, meaning that seven men's downhills were cancelled during the season and only two of those were rescheduled.\nSeason summary.\nAfter the cancellations, the season began with the make-up at Val Gardena/Grõden, which was won (in a huge upset) by American Bryce Bennett (who did not start in the top 30), edging out two-time defending discipline champion Aleksander Aamodt Kilde from Norway and two-time overall champion Marco Odermatt from Switzerland. In the next race, on the Stelvio in Bormio, overall World Cup leader Marco Schwarz of Austria suffered a season-ending knee injury, and Switzerland's Marco Odermatt, who finished second, took over first place in the discipline for the season. The season then became a battle between Odermatt and French skier Cyprien Sarrazin, who won both of the downhills in Kitzbühel, Austria to move into second, just six points behind Odermatt, who had previously won the two downhills in Wengen, Switzerland. \nHowever, just when a French skier moved into contention for the discipline title, the upcoming two races in France (at Chamonix, 2-3 February) had to be cancelled due to a lack of snow and a too-warm forecast, which left just two more downhills on the discipline schedule for the season -- one in Norway in February, and then the season finals in March. And then Sarrazin was injured during training and had to miss the downhill in Kvitfjell, Norway, which was won by Niels Hintermann of Switzerland, while his teammate Odermatt finished seventh and opened a 42-point lead over Sarrazin with just the season finals remaining.\nFinals.\nThe season final was scheduled to take place on 24 March at Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria. For the first time since the finals began in 1993, the downhill was the last event of the finals instead of the first, with the women's race being held on Saturday and the men's on Sunday. Only the top 25 in the downhill standings and the downhill gold medalist at the Junior World Championships (Livio Hiltbrand of Switzerland) were eligible to compete in the downhill finals, with the exception that any skier who has earned at least 500 points in the overall standings was eligible to compete in any discipline, regardless of his standing in the downhill for the season. Due to the reduced field, only the top 15 earned points. Because Hiltbrand was competing in (and winning, despite starting the final in fifth place) the European Cup downhill season championship this week, he and the injured Kilde and Florian Schieder of Italy did not enter finals, while one 500-point skier (Loïc Meillard) did, setting the race field at 25.\nHowever, on race day heavy snow and wind caused the final to be delayed by two hours and then cancelled (and not postponed, as it was scheduled for the same day as the season-ending ceremonies). Accordingly, Odermatt, who was leading by 42 points, won the season crown, giving him the overall title and three discipline titles for the season. "

        "text": "Kenneth Charles Moore (May 11, 1917 – December 1, 2003) was an American football lineman. He played college football for the West Virginia Wesleyan Bobcats and appeared in seven or eight games for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He also had stints with the Cincinnati Bengals of the American Professional Football Association (APFA) and the Jersey City Giants of the American Association (AA).\nEarly life and college career.\nMoore was born on May 11, 1917, in Clarksburg, West Virginia. He attended Washington Irving High School and was their only alumnus to play in the National Football League (NFL). He attended West Virginia Wesleyan College and began playing for the Bobcats as a freshman in 1935, lettering. He began as a center and also played defensive end as a sophomore in 1936. He was one of the players who assisted in \"bringing fame\" to West Virginia Wesleyan that year by defeating Duquesne.\nAs a junior, Moore played both center and tackle and began receiving All-America attention. \"The Raleigh Register\" described him as the \"obstreperous iron man center\" and \"a champion in the making ... [he] has been the spearhead of the Methodist line so far and much dependence [is] placed on his dependable shoulders ... [p]robably if a record of individual tackles made thus far had been kept, the ubiquitous Clarksburg, W. Va., product would topple that of his teammates, so consistently has been his brand of ball.\"\nMoore was nicknamed \"Cave Man Kenny\". He was moved to quarterback to begin the 1938 season to give more \"beef\" to the backfield, but then returned to the line as a guard. He missed time due to injury that year. The \"Hinton Daily News\" summarized his college football career as follows: \"The fast-charging, hard-hitting tactics of the ubiquitous Moore established [him as one of] Wesleyan's ... outstanding centers the school has turned out during the past three decades.\" The paper noted that he was selected to All-State teams, was mentioned as an All-American, and was chosen to various All-Opponent teams. In addition to football, Moore also played basketball at West Virginia Wesleyan.\nProfessional career.\nMoore signed with the Cincinnati Bengals of the American Professional Football Association (APFA) following his college career, but did not appear in any games for them. He then signed with the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) as an undrafted free agent and was sent to their farm team, the Jersey City Giants of the American Association; he appeared in nine games, eight as a starter, and was named second-team All-AA at right guard. He was promoted to New York in October 1940 and appeared in seven or eight games for the team in the 1940 NFL season. He became a free agent prior to the 1941 season and did not sign with another team.\nLater life.\nMoore served in the United States Navy. He was a special agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for 25 years and was for 10 years the head of security at Calder Race Course. He lived in Miami for a time after his football career and spent the last 22 years of his life in Port St. Lucie, Florida. He was a member of the Elks Lodge, Moose Lodge, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Sandpiper Bay Golf Club and American Legion. Moore died in Jupiter, Florida, at age 86, on December 1, 2003."

The first event of the season was not scheduled until 3 December 2023 in Beaver Creek, and six of the eight races were scheduled to be complete by the end of January 2024. However, as described below, the first race in Beaver Creek was canceled and not rescheduled.\nSeason summary.\nThe Super-G scheduled in Beaver Creek was cancelled due to high winds, as all three men's events over that weekend were cancelled for the same reason. When the first race of the season was finally held in Val Gardena/Gröden on 15 December, 2021 discipline champion Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria edged both his teammate Daniel Hemetsberger and defending discipline champion Marco Odermatt to seize the early lead in the discipline race, although Odermatt took over first in the overall competition..In the next event, Odermatt won and took over first in the discipline standings as well.\nThe next three super-Gs, all in January 2024, were won by three different skiers; Cyprien Sarrazin of France; Nils Allègre of France (his first World Cup podium); and Odermatt again. With his victory, Odermatt opened up a 121-lead in the discipline for the season, with only two races (200 points) to go. However, in Kvitfjell, the last race in the discipline before the finals, Kriechmayr triumphed while Odermatt only tied for third, giving Kriechmayr, now just 81 points behind Odermatt, at least a mathematical shot at the discipline crown.\nFinals.\nThe World Cup discipline final took place on Friday, 22 March 2024 in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria. Only the top 25 in the Super-G discipline ranking and the winner of the Junior World Championship in Super-G (Max Perathoner of Italy) were eligible to compete in the final, except that any skier who has scored at least 500 points in the overall classification for the season could participate in any discipline, regardless of his performance in that discipline during the season. Because of the reduced field size, only the top 15 finishers in each discipline scored points. Due to injuries during the season, Hemetsberger and two Norwegians -- Adrian Smiseth Sejersted and former discipline champion Aleksander Aamodt Kilde -- were unable to compete in the finals, and no 500-point skiers who were not otherwise eligible chose to compete, so the final field consisted of 23 racers.\nIn the final, Stefan Rogentin of Switzerland, who hadn't finished better than seventh all season, edged his countrymen Loïc Meillard and Arnaud Boisset for the top step of the podium, which gave Odermatt, who finished fifth, his second consecutive season title in the discipline."

        "text": "The men's giant slalom in the 2024 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of ten events, including the final. The original schedule included 12 events, but two were canceled during the season. Switzerland's Marco Odermatt, the two-time defending champion. not only won his third straight championship but completely dominated, winning 9 of the 10 races in the discipline.\nSeason summary.\nThe first giant slalom of the season, scheduled as usual on the Rettenbach glacier in Sölden, Austria in October, had to be cancelled due to high winds, although 47 skiers had already completed their first run. The cancelled race was subsequently rescheduled for Aspen on 1 March 2024. The first race of the season was actually held in Val d'Isère in early December, and Marco Odermatt continued his dominance from the prior two seasons; as of this race, he has now won 13 of the last 19 World Cup giant slaloms, including four in a row. At Alta Badia, Odermatt extended his dominance to six giant slaloms in a row, winning both races in an unusual Sunday-Monday pairing. Odermatt then continued his dominance by winning the giant slaloms in Adelboden, Schlamding, and Bansko, making him 6-for-6 in giant slaloms for the season and giving his a winning streak of nine straight World Cup giant slaloms. When Odermatt next won the first two giant slaloms in the U.S. (Palisades Tahoe and Aspen), he clinched the discipline title for the season, and he then won the final Aspen giant slalom to stretch his winning streak in the discipline to 12 straight, including all 9 in the current season, leaving him 2 short of Ingemar Stenmark's all-time record of 14 straight in one discipline. The penultimate giant slalom in Kranjska Gora was cancelled due to lack of snow, setting the stage for a four-way battle for the other two spots on the podium at finals, with only 23 points separating second from fifth.\nFinals.\nThe World Cup finals in men's giant slalom took place on Saturday, 16 March 2024, in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup giant slalom discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship in the discipline, plus any skiers who had scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, were eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 finishers earned World Cup points in the discipline.\nComing into the finals, Odermatt (undefeated for the season) seemed about to match Stenmark's record of winning all 10 giant slaloms in a season, set in the 1979 season (45 years ago). However, while leading the race during his second run, Odermatt missed a gate, ending his pursuit of Stenmark's record and handing the victory to his Swiss teammate Loïc Meillard, who thus finished second in the discipline for the season, with Filip Zubčić of Croatia third."

        "text": "The 1886 Women's tennis season was a tennis circuit composed of 57 national, regional, county, and regular tournaments. The season began in February in London, England, and ended in December in Napier, New Zealand.\nSummary of season.\nFrom 1888 until 1912 Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), grew in status and influence to become the de facto international tennis governing body before the proper International Lawn Tennis Federation commenced operations. Despite the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) forming in 1881 a good seven years before the LTA, it was the British body that set laws, settled disputes and organized the increasingly complicated tournament calendar before the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) formed in March, 1913.\nAfter the formation of the ILTF the world tennis circuit going forward was a highly organised and structured network of national and international tournaments. Most tennis tournaments were usually mixed events for men and women, and the women's international tennis circuit certainly up to 1923 was composed mainly of tournaments on the British and European Circuits. After the USNLTA joined the ILTF this would later change with more and more tournaments being staged globally. Women tennis players on the world circuit up to the open era were funded by their national associations enabling them to travel and take part in international tournaments.\n1886 sees a decrease in the number women's singles events being held as the tennis circuit continues to form. The 1886 women's tennis season began on 3 February with the Hyde Park Court Covered Courts Tournament, London, Hyde Park Court. In May 1886 at the first major event of the year the Irish Championships played at the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club in Dublin, Ireland. Ireland's May Langrishe wins the singles title for her third and final title defeating the up-and-coming Louisa Martin, she also picks up the mixed doubles title with Eyre Chatterton. The ladies doubles event is won by Connie Butler and Louisa Martin. In terms of draw size the West of England Championships was the largest tournament of the year with a draw of 46 across three events.\nIn June 1886 at the second major tournament of the year, the Northern Championships played at the Liverpool Cricket Club in Liverpool, featured a full schedule of events the singles title going to Maud Watson defeating Lottie Dod in straights sets, the women's doubles event was won by the sister pairing of Ann Dod and Lottie Dod who defeat a Miss Cliff and May Langrishe in the final, the mixed doubles event is won by Margaret Bracewell and William Renshaw who defeat Lottie Dod and Harry Grove in the final.\nIn July at the 1886 Wimbledon Championships the world's first major tennis tournament, Blanche Bingley defeats two-time defending champion Maud Watson in straight sets to claim her first major title.\nIn August at the U.S. National Championships played on the outdoor Grass courts at the Newport Casino in Newport, Rhode Island there was still no women's championship events staged. The season ended on 30 December 1886 at the first New Zealand Championships, Napier, New Zealand played on grass.\nSeason results.\nPrior to the creation of the International Lawn Tennis Federation and the establishment of its world championship events in 1913 the Wimbledon Championships, the U.S. National Championships, the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships and the Northern Championships were considered by players and historians as the four most important tennis tournaments to win.\nKey\nJanuary.\n\"No events\"\nFebruary.\n\" * (denotes doubles) ** (denotes mix doubles)\" \nMarch.\n\"No events\"\nApril.\n\"No events\"\nNovember.\n\"No events\"\nTournament winners (singles).\nThis is a list of winners by the total number of singles titles won for 1886 major titles in bold:"

        "text": "The Saint Mary's Huskies men's ice hockey team is an ice hockey team representing the Saint Mary's Huskies athletics program of Saint Mary's University. The team is a member of the Atlantic University Sport conference and compete in U Sports. The team plays their home games at the Dauphinee Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nHistory.\nSaint Mary's ice hockey program had a difficult start, though at first it was entirely of their own making. The team joined the Maritime Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1929 and promptly won the conference tournament that season. However, the school's administrators were not enamored by the Huskies' exploits. Three years later, when Saint Mary's had a chance for a second championship, the team was forbade from participating as the final game occurred during Lent. The following year, the Huskies withdrew from competition since the order remained in force. Due to Ash Wednesday falling later in 1935, the Huskies were able to return to play for two year but again withdrew prior to the 1937 postseason since Lent began on February 10. However, by 1940 Saint Mary's had relented on its prohibition and allowed the team to compete through the holiday season.\nNow that it had persisted over the objections of its own administration, the ice hockey team then had to survive the difficulties brought upon by World War II. The MIAA conference had seen more than half of its nominal members suspend play for the duration of the war. Saint Mary's was one of just three schools to attempt to continue on but by 1944 the program had to finally admit defeat and halt play. Their suspension lasted just one season, however, and the team returned in the fall of 1945. Saint Mary's return didn't last long, and the team left the MIAA after 1948. The Huskies remained out of competition for several years, returning in 1954 when college teams shifted away from senior hockey. The time off had not done Saint Mary's any favors as he program was a shell of its former self. The Huskies muddled through the next decade before withdrawing from the MIAA in 1964.\nAfter a three-year hiatus, Saint Mary's returned in style, finishing second in the conference upon their return. The team then reeled off seven consecutive league championships and finished as national runners-up four years in a row. The Huskies came back down to earth after their unprecedented run but still remained a power in the conference for several years. In 1984, however, disaster struck the program; At the conclusion of the season, Saint Mary's was getting ready for the postseason when the program was ruled to have used an ineligible player. Wayne Fortune had played 11 games for the Saginaw Gears, a professional team, the year before. The Huskies were forced to forfeit all of their 13 wins and officially finished last with a record of 0–24. The controversy had a chilling effect on the program and Saint Mary's spent the next several years wallowing at the bottom of the standings.\nThe Saint Mary's ice hockey program didn't really recover until the close of the 20th century when it won its first regular season title in over 20 years. Two years later, the team captured a conference championship and returned to the national tournament for the first time in nearly 30 seasons. Saint Mary's would then slowly ramp up performance, culminating with a pair of league championships and its first national championship by the end of the decade. Since then, Saint Mary's has maintained a regular position near the top of the conference standings and made several more trips to the national tournament.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSenior and collegiate play.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\"\nCollegiate only.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\"\n&lt;br&gt;\nSee also.\nSaint Mary's Huskies women's ice hockey"

        "text": "The 1887 Women's tennis season was a tennis circuit composed of 100 national, regional, county, and regular tournaments. The season began in January in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand, and ended in December in Christchurch, New Zealand.\nSummary of season.\nFrom 1888 until 1912 Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), grew in status and influence to become the de facto international tennis governing body before the proper International Lawn Tennis Federation commenced operations. Despite the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) forming in 1881 a good seven years before the LTA, it was the British body that set laws, settled disputes and organized the increasingly complicated tournament calendar before the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) formed in March, 1913.\nAfter the formation of the ILTF the world tennis circuit going forward was a highly organised and structured network of national and international tournaments. Most tennis tournaments were usually mixed events for men and women, and the women's international tennis circuit certainly up to 1923 was composed mainly of tournaments on the British and European Circuits. After the USNLTA joined the ILTF this would later change with more and more tournaments being staged globally. Women tennis players on the world circuit up to the open era were funded by their national associations enabling them to travel and take part in international tournaments.\n1887 sees an increase in the number women's singles events being held as the tennis circuit continues to form. The 1887 women's tennis season began on 2 January with the Farndon Park Open, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. In May 1887 at the first major event of the year the Irish Championships played at the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club in Dublin, Ireland. England's Lottie Dod wins the singles title defeating Maud Watson, she also picks up the mixed doubles title with Ernest Renshaw. The ladies doubles event is won by Louisa Martin and Florence Stanuell. In terms of draw size the West of England Championships was the largest tournament of the year with a draw of 56 across three events.\nIn June 1887 at the second major tournament of the year the Northern Championships played at the Northern Lawn Tennis Club in Manchester Lottie Dod collects her second major title beating Maud Watson in straights sets, the women's doubles event is won by the sister's Ann Dod and Lottie Dod who defeat a Louisa Martin and Florence Stanuell in the final in three sets, the mixed doubles event is won by Irish pair Louisa Martin and Tom Campion who defeat Lottie Dod and Harry Grove in the final.\nIn July at the 1887 Wimbledon Championships the world's first major tennis tournament, Lottie Dod completes a clean sweep all the British and Irish major tournaments, when she defeats defending champion Blanche Bingley in straight sets to claim her third major title.\nIn September at the U.S. National Championships a women's event is staged for the first time at the Philadelphia Cricket Club, PA and was played after the men's tournament had ended. 17-year-old Philadelphian Ellen Hansell became the first women's champion, defeating Laura Knight in straight sets. The season ended on 24 December 1887 at the New Zealand Championships, held in Christchurch, New Zealand played on grass.\nSeason results.\nPrior to the creation of the International Lawn Tennis Federation and the establishment of its world championship events in 1913 the Wimbledon Championships, the U.S. National Championships, the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships and the Northern Championships were considered by players and historians as the four most important tennis tournaments to win.\nThis is a calendar of all known official events that were administered by national, regional, provincial, state, and county lawn tennis associations in the year 1887, with player progression documented from the quarterfinals stage where historical sources have permitted.\nKey\nJanuary.\n\" * (denotes doubles) ** (denotes mix doubles)\" \nApril.\n\"No events\"\nTournament winners (singles).\nThis is a list of winners by the total number of singles titles won for 1887 major titles in bold:"

        "text": "The 1928–29 MIT Engineers men's ice hockey season was the 28th season of play for the program. The Engineers were coached by Bill Stewart in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nWith many returning players from the previous season, MIT had a decent outlook on the year and got into action with an exhibition match in early December. The extra workout was designed to get the team into shape for its opening match with Boston University since the team had not been able to get onto the ice until late November. Despite being favored in the match, the Engineers' offense failed and weren't able to get a single goal against the Terriers. The defense performed well but couldn't stop the team from opening the year with a loss. The team had little time to address their problems as their annual tilt with Harvard was just four days away. Sure enough, Tech was overwhelmed by the Crimson. While Riley allowed 9 goals, Crosby was able to finally get one for the Engineers.\nAfter the inauspicious start, coach Stewart had five days to get his team prepared for Norwich and changed up the forward unit. Team captain George White was moved to wing with Crosby assuming his old position at center. Cullinan was shifted up from defense to the other wing with Peene now serving as a reserve. Hazeltine took over the vacant position on the blueline next to Lucey. Those changes, combined with a weaker opponent, led MIT to its first win of the season in spectacular fashion. Crosby led the way with two goals and an assist and had the game so well in hand by the third period that Stewart was able to finish out the game with alternates, substituting nearly the entire team. The team headed into the winter break with their spirits high and hadn't lost any of that moxie upon their return. Their first road game of the year saw MIT score another 5 goals, leading to a win over New Hampshire. The team had only two alternated for the match but both got in on the scoring. Peene assisted on Hall's opening goal and the latter added a second on an individual play in the second. The team built a 5–0 lead after two periods and were content to play defense for the remainder of the match. UNH managed a late goal but that only prevented Riley from earning a second consecutive shutout.\nUnfortunately, due to the heavy demand for ice time at the Boston Arena, the Engineers didn't have another game on their schedule until February. With nearly a month off, the team did what it could to stay in shape and continued their winning streak when they met Army for their second road game. Just as they had in the New Hampshire game, MIT used a strong second period to establish a solid lead before playing defense in the final 20 minutes. All 5 goals came from different players with Ford and Lucey joining in on the exploits of the starting forwards. 10 days later, the team's streak came to an abrupt end when they met Princeton. The Tigers were on a 12-game heater heading into the match and continued their stellar play by overpowering the Engineers. Even with a solid defensive performance Princeton still managed to get 7 goals past Riley and skated away with a relatively easy win.\nMIT was able to shake off the loss during their trip north into Maine. The team first defeated Bowdoin 1–0 with the score being close only due to the inspired play of the Bears' netminder. The following evening, the team met Bates during the Bobcat's winter carnival and the two were neck-and-neck throughout the 2 hour match. Lucey and Crosby each gave MIT a lead but their hosts were able to tie the match soon afterwards. In the waning moments of the game, Hall scored the winning marker, stunning the home crowd. Due to their late return from the trip, the rematch with BU was delayed to the 21st but Tech's offense fared no better than the first game and the team lost 1–3.\nThe final two game of the year came in early March on a southerly road trip. Using a bus rather than the typical train, the team was able to send their entire 16-man team which included Cullinan, who had been injured during the BU match. When the game began, however, the Brunos leapt out to an early lead, scoring three goals before the Engineers knew what hit them. The defense recovered after that initial salvo but the offense remained silent until the third. White and Crosby cut into the lead in the final frame but the Engineer rally ran out of time and MIT fell by a single goal. The following night, the team was in Philadelphia, facing a Penn squad that hadn't won any of its 11 games to that point. Despite the recent result, MIT got off to a slow start once more but the offense took less time to make an appearance. Hall and Deyermond scored to give the team a 2–1 lead in the second. Their advantage didn't last long as the Quakers tied the match in the middle frame before retaking the lead in the third. Nothing that MIT sent towards the cage got past the Penn goalie and his spectacular play ended MIT's season with a loss.\nLaurence Horan served as team manager with.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Coromandel Old Boys Rugby League Club",
        "text": "The Coromandel Old Boys Rugby League Club was a rugby league club in Auckland, New Zealand which existed from 1922 to 1925. They competed in the Auckland Rugby League 3rd grade competition in each season. They represented players who had moved to the Auckland area from the Coromandel Peninsula, ostensibly as the gold rush era finished.\nHistory.\n1922 formation.\nRelatively little was reported on the club during their four seasons in the Auckland Rugby League competition aside from their fixtures which were published weekly in the Auckland Star and New Zealand Herald. On February 15, 1922, The Auckland Rugby League held their weekly management committee meeting and said that “affiliation was granted to a new third grade club to be called Coromandel Old Boys, with the colours red, white, and blue”. A club had existed representing Thames Old Boys named Thames Old Boys League Football Club from the Thames area on the Coromandel Peninsula from 1915 to 1920, though it is unclear if there was a connection between the two clubs. They had worn white, black, and blue and none of their players or official were mentioned in connection to the new Coromandel Old Boys club. On February 27 they published an advertisement in the Auckland Star requesting intending players and supporters to attend a meeting at the ABC Printing Works 116-120 Albert Street on Thursday, March 2 at 8pm with their honorary secretary being N.J. Armstrong.\n1922 season.\nTheir first ever match was a preliminary season game against Point Chevalier on April 29 at Carlaw Park #2 field with Mr. Chapman refereeing. The result of the match was not reported. A week later on May 6 they played their first official competition match against Parnell again on the #2 field at Carlaw Park. The referee this time was L. Hemming however once more the score was not reported as was often the case for lower grade games in this era. Their next games were against City Rovers on May 13 at the Auckland Domain and Richmond Rovers on May 20 at their opponents ground at Grey Lynn.\nOn June 10 for their game against Kingsland Rovers at Kingsland their team list was published in the Auckland Star. It included the names: Wiles, Gatland (2), Hamilton, Senior, Breen, Carroll, Hewson, Morrinson, McVeigh, Legge, Wharfe, Nixon, Johns, and Gardener. They lost the match though no score was reported. Two more games followed against City Rovers A and B teams with the second at Walker Park in Point Chevalier.\nTheir first match to have a score reported was a 5–2 win over North Shore Albions who were known as “Devonport United” at this time following a merger with Sunnyside two years earlier. The game was played at the Auckland Domain #4 field at 2pm on July 15. Gatland scored their try with it converted by Park. Their last five matches of the season saw three heavy defeats to Ponsonby United on July 29 (2-38), Point Chevalier (0-37), and Richmond Rovers (0-25), with the scores against Newton Rangers and Ellerslie United not reported. With their last loss to Ellerslie they withdrew from the competition following round 14. With many results not reported across all sides it is unknown exactly where they finished but it would have most likely been near the bottom of the 11 team competition.\n1923 Season.\nIn 1923 season saw Coromandel once again enter a side in the 3rd grade. They performed perhaps slightly better with two reported wins and three losses. They lost their first game of the season to Ellerslie 0–3. On May 19 their team list was published for their Victoria Park game with the Victoria Cruising Club. It was: Masters, Senior, Surtees, Legge, Foley, Wharfe, Breen, Wiles, Chapman, Gould, Bright, Fraser, Hamilton, Gatland (2), and Hudson with the side losing 8–2. Their first reported win was against Newton Rangers on June 16 though it was a default victory. A month later on July 28 they beat Parnell 5–3 at the Ellerslie Racecourse. McCarthy scored their try and Gould converting. Their final game of the year was a 33–0 loss to Ponsonby to finish midtable in the 14 team competition\n1924 Season.\nOnce more Coromandel fielded a third grade side. As was the case from previous years most results were not reported. Their annual meeting was held on March 6 at the Trades Hall (Room D) at 8pm. Their honorary secretary was once more N.J. Armstrong. They played 11 games with a win and 2 losses their only scores stated in the newspapers. They opened the season with a match against Manukau Rovers on April 26 at Waikaraka Park in Onehunga. They played the same opponent a week later with their team list published: Miller, McCarthy, McGregor, Cross, Cole, Lye, Breen, Fraser, Chapman, Craig, Dixon, Lydon, Gatland, Gamble, Matindale, Otto, Hamilton. They won their third game with a 13–7 win over Ponsonby on May 10 at Māngere. They lost to Kingsland 0–3 on May 24 on the Outer Domain. Their other reported score for the year was a heavy 5–38 defeat to City who comfortably won the competition. Their last game of the year was a knockout competition loss to Athletic.\nOn June 27 they went on a semi regular excursion to the Coromandel. Their honorary secretary was R. Breen, one of their players.\n1925 final season.\nThe 1925 season was to be Coromandel's final season in the Auckland Rugby League competition. They actually only survived 8 matches before dropping out. Their name was at times reported as being “Coromandel United” rather than Coromandel Old Boys. They held their annual meeting on March 5 at the League Rooms at Carlaw Park with N.J. Armstrong their honorary secretary however at their meeting on March 19 at McNeil's Billiard Rooms in Newton with all players requested to attend, R. Breen was listed as their new honorary secretary. Their first game of the season was against Point Chevalier on May 9. They lost 0–11 at their opponents Walker Park venue. The team list was: Jones, Lindsay, Leathart, Marshall, Galvan, McGregor, Lye, Buckley, Senior, Chapman, Fraser, Gould, Lydon, Cross, Cole, Blucher, Bishop, Masters, and Coll. They also lost to Otahuhu Rovers 5–10 on May 16, and then to New Lynn 0–6 on May 23 at New Lynn. They played other games against Athletic, Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers, City, Richmond, and finally Kingsland on July 11 at Māngere. This was their last fixture before they withdrew from the competition and ceased to exist as a club failing to enter any teams in 1926.\nPlaying records.\nThe results are incomplete. The \"New Zealand Herald\" and \"Auckland Star\" published the fixture list each week with details, but results were only sent to the newspapers sporadically during the season, so these records have been compiled from the known results."

The Engineers were coached by Bill Stewart in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nWhen MIT hit the ice for their first preseason practice in early November, coach Stewart had more than 40 candidates to pick from. He would have to completely remake the defense as all three of last years' starters had graduated. With nearly a month before their first game, the team had ample opportunity to round into form. Despite this, the team was not expected to threaten the defending intercollegiate champions, Harvard. Sure enough, the Crimson controlled the game from start to finish, handing the Engineers a rather embarrassing 0–9 defeat. Tech had nearly another month before their next game and, though they had the winter break in between, coach Stewart tried to address some of the problems that had been pointed out in the loss. Unfortunately, the team came up against another of the nation's top squads and was handed a second drubbing, this time by Dartmouth.\nThings continued to trend in the wrong direction in the third game. Yale was another of the teams vying for a championship and they proved their mettle with a 1–12 steamrolling of the Engineers. While the team felt the absence of Duplin in the match, its doubtful that a full-strength MIT would have fared much better against the Elis. With only terrible results on their resume, the team packed it in for the remainder of January and didn't have another game scheduled until after the exam break. Upon their return, Bill Cullinan, who had been on last year's squad, returned to school and was eligible to play once more.\nUnfortunately for the team, the weather began to warm towards the beginning of February and caused the team to cancel their next four games. The team could only practice and wait for better conditions but, in the end, they were only able to play one more game on the year. In mid March the team took a trip south to play Brown. Taking advantage of their weak opponent, MIT was finally able to get its first win of the year. Crosby, Donahue and White each scored in the game to send the seniors off in style.\nPaul Donahue served as team manager with.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The NCAA Season 75 basketball tournaments are the Philippines' National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments for basketball in its 1999–2000 season. Jose Rizal College hosted the season, starting with an opening ceremony held at the Araneta Coliseum on July 18, 1999, followed by a quadruple-header.\nMen's tournament.\nElimination round.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's playoffs\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's playoffs\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nThe top 2 teams had the twice-to-beat advantage, where the top 2 teams have to be beaten twice, while their opponents just once, to progress.\n(1) San Sebastian vs. (4) Letran.\nThe Knights forced a rubber match by winning the first game. Letran led by 14 early in the second half. However, San Sebastian converted seven three-point field-goals to tie the game at 61-all. Letran then closed on the Stags' shooters and allowed them just one basket moving forward to force a Game 2. Letran then won Game 2.\n(2) JRC vs. (3) UPHR.\nUPHR was leading early in the second half when JRC had a 20–5 run that blew the game wide open for good. The Heavy Bombers' win marked their first finals appearance since 1972.\nFinals.\nIn Game 1, Letran ran to a 15–5 start, only to have JRC mount their own 13–4 run. The Knights kept the lead at halftime, 46–43. With five minutes left in the second half, Letran guard John Prior fouled out, setting John Dale Valeña to score 10 points to put JRC up. With 2:08 left in the game and with the Heavy Bombers up 74–72, Letran's defense caused JRC to miss shots. A free-throw from Kerby Raymundo, named Most Valuable Player prior to the game, cut the JRC lead to one. Raymundo then forced Ariel Capus to throw up an airball, which led to Aldin Ayo scoring on a lay-up to put the Knights in the lead. Both teams then failed to score in the ensuing possessions, setting up a final possession for JRC, where Valeña missed a lay-up to give the Knights the Game 1 victory.\nOn the next game, Letran again started well, erecting a 13–2 lead early in the first half. JRC cut the lead down to four at 13–9, but the Knights then had another 27–11 run; Letran eventually had a 44–26 lead at halftime. At halftime, fracas ensued when Letran supporters rained debris on JRC cheerleaders, causing the game to be delayed by an hour. JRC never got close in the second half. With 3 minutes remaining, and with Letran leading 83–60, Letran's John Prior elbowed John Dale Valeña in the face, in front of the JRC bench. Valeña then threw a punch on Prior at the nape, then the JRC supporters rained debris on the court, causing the game to be delayed again. JRC coach Boy de Vera wanted to finish the game, but was overruled by JRC officials, conceding the game to Letran. Knights coach Binky Favis later said \"It would have been a sweeter victory if the game finished, but a championship is a championship.\"\nJuniors' tournament.\nFinals.\nArmed with the twice-to-beat advantage after winning all 14 elimination round games, San Beda was beaten for the first time in the season by Mapua, extending the series. In the deciding Game 2, Magnum Membrere led the Red Cubs to the juniors' championship."

Certain tournaments were given \"ranking\" status, with the results at those events contributing to a player's world ranking. The events that made up the 1976–77 snooker season were the first to award players with ranking points. Originally, the world rankings were decided based only on results in the World Snooker Championship, but other events were later added. The system used for the 2023–24 snooker season was first used in the 2010–11 season, where players won ranking points based entirely on prize money won from these events. The rankings are based on the prior two seasons, with eight revisions after specific tournaments throughout the season. These revisions are used as official rankings, with points awarded in the current season overwriting those from two years prior.\nRonnie O'Sullivan began the season as the highest ranked player, with a lead of 9,500 points over second-ranked 2023 World Champion Luca Brecel. O'Sullivan has retained the position throughout the season so far.\nRevision dates and seeding cut-offs.\nThe world rankings are updated at specific revision dates following each ranking tournament. On these dates, the ranking points from the latest 2023–24 season ranking event are added, while those from two years ago in the 2021–22 snooker season are removed from a player's total. The revision dates are also used for seeding of following ranking events.\nRanking list.\nThis table contains the rankings after each revision points, which were used to determine the seedings for subsequent tournaments.

        "text": "Olivia Olson (born November 2, 2005) is an American basketball player who has committed to play for Michigan women's basketball. She is a five-star basketball recruit and one of the top players in the 2024 class. She has competed in basketball for Team USA at the 2021 FIBA Under-16 Women's Americas Championship and the Nike Hoop Summit. She is a 2024 McDonald's All-American. In 2023, she won Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) state championships as a senior goalkeeper in soccer and as a junior guard in basketball for Benilde-St. Margaret's. She helped Benilde defend their basketball title in 2024. She earned Minnesota Miss Basketball and Minnesota Gatorade Player of the Year recognition.\nHigh school career.\nOlson has trained with her father Chris from a young age; practicing her ball-handling skills. She began playing varsity basketball in eighth grade. As an eighth grader for Benilde-St. Margaret's, she tallied 40 points against a talented DeLaSalle High School team. She also played varsity soccer as an eighth grader, but sat out her junior season before returning as a senior goalkeeper. By January 2021, the freshman had 17 athletic scholarship offers and was the number 9 prospect in the national class of 2024. She averaged 23 points as a freshman. Late in her sophomore season, she was the number 3 ESPN-ranked prospect of the national class of 2024 with over 40 college scholarship offers. She averaged 22.8 points as a sophomore.\nOn September 8, 2022, Olson gave a verbal commitment to Kim Barnes Arico and the Michigan Wolverines after the program reached its first two NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament Sweet Sixteen appearances in 2021 and 2022 and the 2021–22 Michigan Wolverines, posted the best season in school history. National class of 2023 top-30 prospect, Taylor Woodson, from Minnesota had also committed to Michigan by September 2022. She was the first top-40 player in the national class of 2024 to give a verbal commitment. Olson led her school to a 2023 MSHSL Class 3A State Championship averaging 25.6 points, 12.6 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game.\nOn November 8, 2023, she signed her National Letter of Intent (NLI) to play college basketball at Michigan. In November, she was the goalkeeper for the MSHSL Class 2A state champion soccer team. Then, on November 25, 2023, she broke a bone in her left hand in the season opener and did not return to action until January 4, 2024, when she posted her 2000th career point. Her father's Twitter explained that Olson's surgery required 2 plates and 12 screws. Ranked at number 15 in the national class of 2024, she is the second (to number 11-ranked incoming Michigan freshman classmate Syla Swords) highest-ranked recruit in program history at the time of signing her NLI. The class of 2024 was the highest ranked class in school history (ranked number 4 on signing day).\nAt the MSHSL Class 3A State Championship tournament, Benilde-St. Margaret's won its three games by margins of 35, 31 and 23 to defend its championship. In the championship game, Benilde-St. Margaret's (who was seeded first and ranked second) faced DeLaSalle High School (who was ranked first and seeded second). Olson had 30 points, 15 rebounds and 6 assists.\nShe was named to the April 2, 2024 McDonald's All-American Girls Game at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. Olson, along with incoming freshman Swords, are the program's first high school signees to earn the honor. Olson and Liv McGill were the eighth and ninth Minnesotans named McDonald's All-Americans. She has also been selected for the April 13 Nike Hoops Summit at the Moda Center in Portland Oregon. During her senior year she averaged 24 points, 10 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 3.6 steals through 28 games and was named Minnesota Gatorade Player of the Year. She was also awarded Minnesota Miss Basketball. Although she was not a big scorer in the McDonald's All-American Game, MaxPreps writer Aaron Williams used the phrase \"The highlight reel dish of the night\" to describe her pass to her future Michigan teammate Swords. The play received lots of public praise, with ESPN's color commentator mentioning it as possibly \"the prettiest play we've seen all game\".\nNational team career.\nOlson has represented the United States women's national under-16 basketball team, winning a gold medal at the 2021 FIBA Under-16 Women's Americas Championship. She was one of only 3 15-year-olds selected for the team.\nPersonal life.\nBy her high school freshman season, she had about a dozen landscaping customers. Her father and brother, Morgan, kept her business running while she was training with and playing for Team USA in 2021."

        "text": "Golf Links Estate is a residential housing estate with an area of approximately 59 hectares located in the Melbourne suburb of Macleod in Victoria, Australia. It is bounded by the Hurstrbridge railway line to the west, Strathallan Estate to the north, Greensborough Highway to the east and the suburb of Rosanna to the south.\nHistory.\nThe Golf Links Estate traces its origins to the colonial land sales in the Colony of Victoria, when Crown Portions 9 and 10 in the Parish of Keelbundoora, County of Burke (covering modern-day Macleod and Bundoora) were sold to Neil McLean on 5 February 1840 for £816. After purchase, Neil McLean named both properties ‘Strathallan’. McLean's brother, Malcolm, took over the land in 1842, but then returned to Scotland with his wife and children in the late 1850s, leaving an agent in control. Much of the flatter land was cleared of vegetation for farming aside from some of the large River Red Gums (\"Eucalyptus camaldulensis\"). The agent leased portions of the land to several tenant farmers for grazing, dairying, and other activities.\nCharles Henry James MLC purchased the Strathallan estate from the McLean family in December 1888 for £234,000 but his purchase was subject to protracted legal battles and disputes that continued until 1891, by which time Mr. James was bankrupt. Ownership of a large portion of the property (covering all of Crown Portion 9 and a little of Crown Portion 10) then transferred to the Commercial Bank of Australia in 1902.\nThe Commercial Bank of Australia subdivided the land into three portions. On 18 December 1908, the bank sold the northernmost and central sections to Edith Jessie Macleod. The southern portion of the bank's holding was sold to Michael Le Grand in 1911.\nLe Grand died on 12 July 1914 and bequeathed his estate to his wife Annie Le Grand. She obtained title in 1916. In 1919, Le Grand sold her remaining interests to the Freehold Assets Company Limited, who organised to have the area surveyed for subdivision into the Golf Links Estate. The surveyor was James George Gillespie.\nThe estate is notable because of the large area of land that the developers set-aside for parks and recreation around the Macleod railway station.\nLand sales.\nLots in the Golf Links Estate were first advertised for sale in 1921 and were marketed by Coghill &amp; Haughton.\nThe estate included several hundred residential lots as well as two-dozen shop sites, situated around parklands adjacent to the Macleod railway station. This area became Macleod Park and the shops became the Macleod Village Shopping Centre.\nOther features.\nThe Golf Links Estate contains several community assets, current and former, including:\nEtymology.\nThe Golf Links Estate is named after the former Rosanna Golf Links that originally bordered the south of the estate. This area is now known as Rosanna Park."

        "text": "West Virginia has had very little impact on ice hockey in the United States with one exception. The Wheeling Nailers have been an unqualified success for a state that might otherwise be a non-entity in ice hockey circles.\nHistory.\nThe first team to call West Virginia home were the Huntington Hornets of the IHL. The team played in the Veterans Memorial Fieldhouse but were immediately beset by low attendance figures. Within a few months Ernie Berg, the team's owner, was already looking for a new home and the Hornets lasted just one season. The state was largely ignored over the succeeding 30 years but a second attempt was finally made in the early 1990s. The Winston-Salem Thunderbirds relocated to Wheeling and became the Wheeling Thunderbirds. The team debuted in 1992 and promptly advanced to the league finals. The immediate success helped the team establish itself in its new home and begin to build a following. Due to a trademark dispute with the Seattle Thunderbirds, the team changed its name to 'Nailers' in 1996 but the biggest change was yet to come. In 1998, the franchise signed an affiliation deal with the Pittsburgh Penguins that helped stabilize their finances. The team has seen some success over the years and they have remained a consistent (albeit low) draw at the WesBanco Arena.\nA year after the arrival of the Thunderbirds, a second ECHL team was founded in Huntington. The Huntington Blizzard weren't nearly as successful as their northern counterparts and saw just one winning season in the first six campaigns. The novelty of the team quickly wore off as attendance dropped from 3,700+ in the first two years to the low 2,000s afterwards. The team was finally able to achieve some success in their seventh year but by then it was too late. The team folded in 2000 and was later moved to Texas.\nDespite the demise of the Blizzard, having two minor-league teams in the state helped to convince some of the local high schools to sponsor varsity hockey. Beginning with Wheeling Park High School in 1995, high school hockey has slowly taken hold in the state. Due to the few number of teams that played, most competed in other states' leagues, notably Pennsylvania, but in 2018 that began to change. That year the West Virginia Hockey League was formed to increase the presence of the teams in the state. While most still play in external leagues during the regular season, they convene a few times each year and compete for a state championship.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nOnly a few West Virginia natives have achieved any notability in the sports but only one was raised in the Mountain State."

        "title": "1925–26 MIT Engineers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1925–26 MIT Engineers men's ice hockey season was the 25th season of play for the program. The Engineers were coached by Bill Stewart in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nMIT had made great strides the year before but still had a disappointing season. In order to continue their improvement, Bill Stewart was brought in as the program's new coach. He was a local Baseball and ice hockey coach and referee who had several years experience coaching high school hockey. One thing he found upon his arrival was that the team already had a good pair of starting defensemen. Deke Crandall and Bill Berkeley had been the team's two best defenders a year before and began as the main guardians for team captain Johnny Deignan. Hard practices had the team in shape for the opening match but the Engineers were no match for the fearsome offense possessed by Boston University. Time and again the Terriers swept down the ice and while the defense did turn aside many attempts, poor play from Deignan saw the Terriers score on many attempts. After the captain was pulled for backup Richards, the scoring decreased but MIT could not mount a successful reply and lost 1–5. The team was back on the ice a week later against Boston College and had even less success. Despite a visible improvement to their offense, BC's defense was unfazed and limited the Engineers to but a few rushes up the ice. Randell's solo goal was the only think that interrupted the deluge of Eagle goals and MIT fell 1–7.\nAfter the lopsided loses, coach Stewart changed the lineup by moving Berkeley to the forward unit with Brooks taking over on the blueline. The with MIT being able to carry the puck up the ice more consistently, the pressure on the defense was lessened and the Engineers were more successful in holding back Harvard. Deignan was back in goal and looked far sharper with a reduced workload. While he made 11 saves in the first period, he only had to contend with five afterwards and kept his team in the match until the final buzzer. The new-look Engineers fought hard and held a scoreless tie until the Crimson deployed their greatest advantage; numbers. Harvard used 18 different players in the game, allowing the team to play hard at all times and still have fresh legs on the ice. It was only after deploying a second platoon that Harvard managed to score. Even with that handicap, MIT allowed just two goals and showed a vast improvement over their first two contests.\nThe team then disbanded for the winter break and reconvened after Christmas. They took a short jaunt to Amherst to face Massachusetts Agricultural and used their early-season experience to great effect. While originally scheduled for the 6th, the game was delayed for three days due to inclement weather but the adverse conditions didn't hamper the Engineers in the slightest. Weissner got the ball rolling in the first with his second goal of the year while Berkeley and Freeman added scores in the second. Crandall saw to it that very few Aggie chances got on goal, allowing Deignan and Richards to combine for the shutout. The following week the team got a chance for revenge with a rematch against Boston University. Demonstrating just how far they had come in such a short time, MIT held the Terriers off of the scoresheet for over two periods thanks to wonderful performances by Crandall and Richards. The Engineers were held without a goal for most of the game as well but finally broke through in the third when Brooks deflected a puck in off of the goaltender's skate. Randell doubled the team's lead a few minutes later and MIT then pulled back to hold off the BU attack. One goal managed to leak through Richards but the defense held and the team had their second win 2–1.\nDue to the exam period, the team's next game wasn't for almost a full month and the Engineers had to fortify themselves with early-morning practice in the meantime. The team kicked off its return with a trip up to Maine and with the team expected to win after its recent performances, coach Stewart changed up the lines. With Brooks and Berkeley swapping spots (defense for wing), MIT found itself with a surprising fight on its hands. A much improved Bowdoin team was able to score three goals on Richards. Fortunately, Randell was able to spur the offense with a pair of goals, the final being the game-winner. After their narrow escape, MIT was expecting an easier game from a down Bates team that had won just one of their 6 games to that point but the Bobcats shocked all onlookers by scoring 5 goals in the match. The Engineers appeared to be tired after such a strenuous game the night before and the defense could not hold off the home squad. Goals from Brooks, Randell and Weissner gave the Engineers three separate 2-goal leads but none of them held and the team fell 4–5.\nMIT returned home for a brief respite before head back out again, this time travelling to face Dartmouth. Unfortunately for the Engineers, they were no match for the vaunted Indians and were overrun by the Green juggernaut. Randell nabbed the lone goal for Tech in an otherwise deflating game. Due to the quick turnaround, the rubber match with BU that had been slated for the 18th was delayed until later in the season. MIT was expecting to go on another road trip, this time to the west, but games against Syracuse and Union were cancelled due to a lack of ice.\nThe final game with BU occurred on March 1 and turned out to be one of the strangest games ever played. Both teams appeared to be sleeping through the first two periods with no real fight being shown by either squad. BU was eventually able to summon up some offensive punch and scored in the second period. After 30 minutes of play, George V. Brown, the owner of the Boston Arena, decided that he had seen enough and ended the game. Despite his assertions, Brown had no authority over either team or the referee and Frank Synott, who was the official for the match, did not follow Brown's order. Neither did the Engineers, who were looking to overcome the 1-goal deficit in the third period. However, Boston University had followed the orders and did not appear on the ice for the third period. With only one team on the ice, Synott blew the whistle and started play. MIT scored multiple goals against no opponent but coach Stewart soon ordered his team to cease and went into the BU locker room to convince the players to return to play. While many were already in their street clothes, they did agree to play out the final period and eventually the game was resumed at 11:30. Stewart had the goals that were scored during the Terriers' absence voided as he did not want to win by forfeit and the few remaining fans were rewarded by a spirited effort in the final 15 minutes. Both teams redoubled their efforts and fought a pitched battle that resulted in many penalties and one more goal but that too was in BU's favor. The match ended with a 0–2 defeat for the Engineers but both the team and Stewart were commended for their sportsmanship.\nRichard S. Carroll served as team manager with Herbert Whiting and Arnold Archibald as his assistants.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2026 FIFA World Cup final will be the final match of the 2026 World Cup, the 23rd edition of the premier competition for men's national soccer teams organized by FIFA. The match is scheduled to be played at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, near New York City, on July 19, 2026.\nBackground.\nFIFA announced the date of the final on March 16, 2023. The host of the final, MetLife Stadium, was announced by FIFA on February 4, 2024. The announcement was originally anticipated for late 2023, but was delayed amid planning difficulties.\nVenue.\nThe selected host venue for the final is MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, west of New York City. During the tournament, FIFA will refer to the venue as \"New York New Jersey Stadium\" due to their sponsorship policies. MetLife Stadium has primarily been used by the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL) since it opened in 2009. It has a listed capacity of 82,500 seats and previously hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014 and the Copa América Centenario final in 2016. The stadium will host seven other matches during the World Cup and is expected to use the Meadowlands Rail Line, a shuttle train with no regular service, and a new, $35 million busway to transport attendees from the nearest transit hub at Secaucus Junction.\nThe United 2026 bid—composed of the United States, Mexico, and Canada—was chosen to host the 2026 World Cup by FIFA during the 68th FIFA Congress on June 13, 2018. The bid planned to use 16 host cities spread across the three countries, with all matches from the quarterfinals onward played in the United States. The venue for the final was not confirmed at the time, with MetLife Stadium named an early frontrunner due to its proximity to New York City and prior experience as host for major sporting events. Its main competitor was SoFi Stadium, a new stadium in Inglewood, California, near Los Angeles, which was among the ten U.S. stadiums announced in June 2022. The Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, the host of the 1994 men's final and 1999 women's final, was not chosen due to its age.\nSoFi Stadium was designed primarily for American football with a field that is wide—narrower than FIFA's recommended dimensions. According to media reports, the stadium's owner, Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, was also unhappy with the revenue-sharing deal proposed by FIFA and threatened to cancel their plans to host World Cup matches. In early 2023, AT&amp;T Stadium in the Dallas area emerged as a potential host for the final due to its higher capacity of 90,000 seats and scheduled renovations to accommodate a wider field. In January 2024, MetLife Stadium announced similar plans to widen its field for the World Cup by removing 1,740 seats in the corners. According to \"The Athletic\", the selection of MetLife Stadium came as a \"surprise\" to local officials, who organized a small viewing party for the announcement. Dallas's bid had been favored—and rumored as the winner in January—and included a simulcast of the match at two nearby venues to increase ticket revenue."

His teammate at the Southern club Dave Trevathan was selected as his half-back partner and they played together in all three of the Test matches. He shouldered some of the blame for a 1–2 series loss and never got another international opportunity.\nSimon was the son-in-law of All Black Alfred Eckhold, marrying his daughter Hilda in 1938."

        "title": "2023–24 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2023 season began on January 13, 2024, and concluded with Super Bowl LVIII on February 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada with the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the San Francisco 49ers. This was the first postseason since 1998 not to feature either Peyton Manning or Tom Brady, as they both played their final NFL games in the 2015 and 2022 seasons, respectively.\nIn the Wild Card round, the No. 7 seed Green Bay Packers defeated the No. 2 seed Dallas Cowboys, becoming the first No. 7 seed ever to win a playoff game. The Detroit Lions won their first playoff game since 1991 by defeating the Los Angeles Rams.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs became the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls since the New England Patriots successfully did so in 2003 and 2004. In addition, it marked the first postseason since the 2016–17 playoffs that the Super Bowl went into overtime.\nSchedule.\nThe playoffs began with Wild Card Weekend on January 13–15, 2024. The Divisional round was played on January 20–21, with the winners of those games advancing to the Conference Championship games on January 28. Super Bowl LVIII was played on February 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 13, 2024.\nAFC: Houston Texans 45, Cleveland Browns 14.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Browns and Texans. During the regular season, the Browns defeated the Texans 36–22 in Houston in Week 16. Deshaun Watson, who was the starting quarterback for Cleveland since 2022, suffered a season-ending injury in Week 10. He was the starting quarterback for Houston from 2017 to 2020. In the third quarter, Joe Flacco threw back-to-back interceptions that were returned for touchdowns. This was the Texans' first playoff win since the 2019 season.\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 26, Miami Dolphins 7.\nThis was the fourth postseason matchup between the Dolphins and Chiefs, with Miami winning all three previous contests. The most recent playoff meeting between these two teams was in the 1994–95 Wild Card round, which Miami won 27–17. It was the first postseason clash between the two teams in Kansas City since Christmas Day 1971, which remains the longest NFL game played; the Dolphins won that game 27–24 after two overtime periods. During the regular season, the Chiefs defeated the Dolphins 21–14 in a neutral-site game in Frankfurt, Germany in Week 9. This was the first game where Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill returned to Arrowhead Stadium since he left the Chiefs. With a kickoff temperature of , this became the fourth coldest NFL game in history. With the Lions winning their playoff game against the Rams the next day, Miami became the team with the longest playoff game win drought.\nWith 28 million viewers watching, Peacock recorded their busiest day in history on January 13.\nSunday, January 14, 2024.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 48, Dallas Cowboys 32.\nComing in as huge underdogs, the Packers stunned the Cowboys and won 48–32.\nAfter getting the ball first after electing to receive the opening kickoff, the Packers drove 75 yards in almost 8 minutes, capping the drive with an Aaron Jones touchdown run from 3 yards out to go up 7–0. After the teams traded punts, cornerback Jaire Alexander intercepted a ball off of Dak Prescott deep in Cowboys' territory. At the beginning of the second quarter, the Packers cashed in on the turnover with another Aaron Jones touchdown run, which came from one yard out, to go up 14–0. Following a Cowboys' punt, the Packers drove 93 yards and capped it when Dontayvion Wicks caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from Jordan Love, although the extra point was missed, leaving the score at 20–0. On the next drive, Prescott threw another interception that was returned 64 yards for a touchdown by Darnell Savage with 1:50 remaining in the 1st half to extend the Packers' lead to 27–0. The Cowboys did rebound to score a touchdown on the last play of the half when Jake Ferguson caught a 1-yard pass from Prescott, cutting the lead to 27–7.\nIn the second half, the Packers extended their lead to 32 points, 48–16, with 10:23 left in the 4th quarter, before the Cowboys scored back-to-back touchdowns and two successful 2-point conversions to reduce the deficit to 16 points. However, the Cowboys eventually turned the ball over on downs on their last drive with less than 20 seconds left, sealing the Packers' victory. With the win, the Packers improved to 6–0 at AT&amp;T Stadium all-time (including their win in Super Bowl XLV) and became the first seventh seed to beat a second seed since the playoffs expanded to 14 teams in the 2020 season. Conversely, the Cowboys became the first second seed to lose against a seventh seed since it expanded to 14 teams in the 2020 and it snapped the Cowboys' 16-game home win streak.\nThis was the ninth overall postseason matchup in the rivalry between the Cowboys and Packers. The postseason series between the two teams had been tied 4–4, with the most recent meeting being in the , which the Packers won 34–31 in Arlington. The teams did not meet in the 2023 regular season.\nNFC: Detroit Lions 24, Los Angeles Rams 23.\nThis was the second overall postseason meeting between the Rams and Lions. The first came in the 1952 National Conference Championship, which the Lions won 31–21 in Detroit. It was the Lions' first home playoff game since 1993 and only their third since winning their last NFL title in 1957. It was also their first playoff game at Ford Field. This game was also notable for being the first postseason clash between Matthew Stafford and Jared Goff, the starting quarterbacks for the Rams and Lions respectively. Each had previously played for the other team before being traded for each other prior to the 2021 season. The Rams and Lions did not meet during the regular season.\nThe Lions wound up victorious by a final score of 24–23, their first victory in a postseason game since 1991 and only their second in the Super Bowl era. In his first game in Detroit as an opposing player, Stafford completed 25 of 36 passes for 367 yards and two touchdowns. Meanwhile, Goff completed 22 of 27 passes for 277 yards and a touchdown. Los Angeles Pro Bowl receiver Puka Nacua set a rookie record for receiving yards in a postseason game with nine catches for 181 receiving yards while also scoring a touchdown. Amon-Ra St. Brown was Detroit's leading receiver with seven catches for 110 receiving yards. Although neither team turned the ball over, the Rams were undone by an ineffective red zone offense: zero touchdowns in three red zone trips, while Detroit converted all three of its red zone trips into touchdowns.\nWith this victory, the Lions no longer had fewer playoff victories in their own stadium than another NFL team, as they equaled the Pittsburgh Steelers who had won Super Bowl XL at Ford Field. The victory, combined with the #2-seeded Cowboys' loss to the Packers earlier that day, also meant that the Lions would host two games in a single postseason for the first time in franchise history. This was the first playoff victory by a team from Detroit since 2013, when the Detroit Tigers won an ALDS matchup against the Oakland Athletics.\nMonday, January 15, 2024.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 31, Pittsburgh Steelers 17.\nThis was the fourth playoff matchup between these two teams; Pittsburgh won two out of the first three. The most recent playoff meeting occurred during the Divisional Round of the 1995–96 postseason, which Pittsburgh won 40–21. The Steelers and Bills did not meet during the regular season. The game was originally scheduled to be played on January 14 at 1:05 p.m. EST, but was delayed due to a state of emergency and travel ban declared in Western New York as a result of a massive snowstorm, marking the first time an NFL playoff game was postponed since the 2016–17 playoffs, a game that also featured the Steelers.\nThe first half was dominated by Buffalo, with a Josh Allen touchdown pass to both Dawson Knox and Dalton Kincaid respectively. Allen also had a career-long and franchise playoff record 52-yard touchdown run to put the Bills up 21–0. The Steelers made it a closer game in the second half, getting as close as 24–17 off of a blocked field goal and several touchdowns, before the Bills took a two-score lead on a Khalil Shakir touchdown grab to secure the victory, 31–17.\nNFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 32, Philadelphia Eagles 9.\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting between the Eagles and Buccaneers, with the Buccaneers winning three of the previous five. The most recent postseason meeting between two teams came in the 2021 NFC Wild Card Game, which the Buccaneers won 31–15 in Tampa. In the regular season, the Eagles defeated the Buccaneers in Tampa by a score of 25–11 during Week 3. This would end up being Jason Kelce's final game before his retirement a month later.\nThe Buccaneers made the only scoring plays in the first quarter, off a Chase McLaughlin field goal and David Moore touchdown for 10 unanswered points. The Buccaneers and Eagles traded field goals in the second quarter, after which Dallas Goedert scored a touchdown for Philadelphia. The Eagles attempted a two-point conversion using their signature \"tush push\", but the Buccaneers were able to pull them away. Tampa Bay's defense prevented the Eagles from scoring for the rest of the game, with the Buccaneers scoring two times in the third quarter off a safety on Jalen Hurts and a touchdown from Trey Palmer, in which the Eagles' poor tackling efforts facilitated his 56-yard run to the end zone. Chris Godwin scored a touchdown for Tampa Bay in the fourth quarter as the Buccaneers completed their 23-point blowout of the defending NFC Champions.\nDivisional playoffs.\nThis was the first time that a team seeded below No. 2 (in this case, the No. 3 Detroit Lions) has hosted a divisional playoff game.\nSaturday, January 20, 2024.\nAFC: Baltimore Ravens 34, Houston Texans 10.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Ravens and Texans. The Ravens won the first matchup, the 2011 AFC Divisional Game, by a score of 20–13 in Baltimore. In the regular season, the Ravens defeated the Texans by a score of 25–9 in Baltimore in Week 1. Despite a ragged offensive start in the first half, The Ravens outscored the Texans 24–0 in the second half and advanced to their first AFC Championship game since 2012 with a 34–10 rout.\nThough not getting a takeaway nor recording a sack on rookie quarterback C. J. Stroud, the Ravens defense dominated Houston. They did not allow any offensive plays by Houston inside the Ravens' 25 yard line nor gave up an offensive touchdown. Houston's only points came by a field goal and a punt return touchdown in the first half. The Baltimore crowd noise also caused a litany of Houston pre-snap penalties.\nLamar Jackson had two passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns as he improved to 2–3 in playoff games and 1–2 in home playoff games. This was also the Ravens' first home playoff win since the 2012 AFC Wild Card round.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 24, Green Bay Packers 21.\nAfter losing Deebo Samuel to injury early in the first quarter, the 49ers narrowly edged out the Packers 24–21.\nIn the third quarter, the Packers benefited off a 41-yard pass interference penalty on Ambry Thomas and a 73-yard kickoff return from Keisean Nixon, leading to two touchdowns and a successful two-point conversion to take a 21–14 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Following a field goal from Jake Moody, Anders Carlson missed a 41-yard field goal with six minutes left in the game, and the 49ers were able to capitalize on the opportunity as Brock Purdy led his team on a game-winning drive. Although he had a sluggish performance throughout the game, Purdy completed 6-of-7 passes on the drive before Christian McCaffrey delivered the game-winning touchdown. With a minute left on the clock, Jordan Love attempted a final drive but was intercepted by Dre Greenlaw to seal the 49ers' third consecutive NFC Championship Game appearance (and their fourth in the last five seasons). Greenlaw caught Love's two interceptions of the night.\nThe 49ers got their first win when they entered the fourth quarter trailing by five points or more under head coach Kyle Shanahan.\nThis was the tenth postseason meeting in the rivalry between the Packers and 49ers, an NFL record for the most playoff matches between two teams. The most recent postseason matchup came in the 2021 NFC Divisional Game, which the 49ers won 13–10 in Green Bay. The 49ers and Packers did not meet in the regular season. Additionally, this was also the first-ever 1 seed v 7 seed playoff matchup in NFL history.\nSunday, January 21, 2024.\nNFC: Detroit Lions 31, Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Buccaneers and Lions. The Buccaneers won the first meeting, which came in the 1997 NFC Wild Card Game, by a score of 20–10 at Houlihan's Stadium in Tampa. In the regular season, the Lions won the meeting between the two teams by a score of 20–6 in Week 6 in Tampa. Derrick Barnes intercepted Mayfield with 1:39 remaining to seal a Lions victory. The Lions advanced to the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 1991. This marked the first time since 1957 that the Lions won two playoff games in a season. For the second week in a row, the crowd broke a decibel record at Ford Field.\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 27, Buffalo Bills 24.\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting in the rivalry between the Bills and Chiefs. The Chiefs lead the postseason series 4–2 against the Bills. The last meeting between the two came in the 2021 AFC Divisional Game, which the Chiefs won 42–36 in overtime in Kansas City after the Chiefs offense drove down the field in the final 13 seconds of regulation to score the game–tying field goal. In the regular season, the Bills defeated the Chiefs 20–17 in Kansas City during Week 14.\nIn the highly anticipated game, the teams traded the lead five times. After the fifth lead change, in which the Chiefs scored a touchdown to take a three-point lead, the Bills attempted a fake punt after failing to pick up a first down after three tries on the ensuing series, but it failed. A play later, Kansas City advanced the ball down to Buffalo's 3-yard line with a great opportunity to extend their lead to two scores. However, Kansas City wide receiver Mecole Hardman fumbled the ball out the side of the end zone for a touchback, thus allowing Buffalo to regain possession and remain in the game. After the teams traded punts, the Bills advanced the ball into Kansas City territory, but their drive stalled in field goal range. In a play that evoked memories of the missed game-winning field goal attempt by Scott Norwood in Super Bowl XXV, Buffalo kicker Tyler Bass proceeded to miss his field goal attempt wide right, thus allowing Kansas City to take over with their three-point lead still intact. Kansas City then picked up a first down on their next possession to drain the clock and seal the victory.\nThe game drew the most average viewers of any divisional round game in history, with an average of 50.4 million viewers and a peak of 56.3 million viewers. The previous record of 48.5 million average viewers was established in the . The game also became the most streamed event in Paramount+ history.\nConference championships.\n\"Per an annual rotation used by the NFL since 1997 and made official in 2002, the AFC Championship Game was the first game being played at 3:05 p.m. EST, followed by the NFC Championship Game at 6:40 p.m. EST.\"\nSunday, January 28, 2024.\nAFC Championship Game: Kansas City Chiefs 17, Baltimore Ravens 10.\nThis was the first time the Baltimore Ravens have hosted an AFC Championship Game in franchise history. Additionally, this was the first AFC Championship since 2017 not hosted by the Kansas City Chiefs. This is also the sixth straight AFC Championship Game appearance for the Chiefs.\nThis was also the second postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Ravens. The first meeting came in the 2010 AFC Wild Card, which the Ravens won 30–7 in Kansas City. The two teams did not meet in the regular season.\nAt the end of a scoreless third quarter, Lamar Jackson threw a 54-yard pass to Zay Flowers, who was then called for a 15-yard penalty after taunting over L'Jarius Sneed. As the drive carried over into the fourth quarter, Flowers received a pass from Jackson near the end zone, but Sneed forced a fumble for a touchback. The next Ravens drive reached the red zone, but ended in an interception by Deon Bush as Jackson attempted a pass to a triple-covered Isaiah Likely.\nThis game averaged 55.5 million viewers with a peak of 64 million viewers becoming the most viewed AFC championship game in history, as well as the most watched non Super Bowl CBS program since the 1994 Winter Olympics.\nNFC Championship Game: San Francisco 49ers 34, Detroit Lions 31.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the 49ers and Lions. The postseason series was split 1–1 between the two teams. The most recent postseason matchup between the two came in the 1983 NFC Divisional Round, which the 49ers won 24–23 at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. The 49ers and Lions did not meet in the regular season, this was the second NFC Championship appearance for the Lions and first since 1991, in which they lost to the Washington Redskins. This is the third straight season and fourth time in the last five seasons that the 49ers have reached the NFC Championship Game.\nThe Lions started off with an explosive offensive push that saw them score a touchdown within the first two minutes of the game; they would score two more touchdowns and a field goal to take a 24–7 lead at halftime. Although the 49ers' only managed a Christian McCaffrey touchdown in the first half, they proceeded to score 27 unanswered points off of huge plays: a 51-yard pass from Brock Purdy was recovered by Brandon Aiyuk as it deflected off Kindle Vildor's helmet on a touchdown drive, which was immediately followed by a fumble recovery off of Jahmyr Gibbs that the 49ers converted into another touchdown drive. In the fourth quarter, the Lions unsuccessfully attempted a fourth down conversion instead of going for a field goal, proving costly as the Lions would ultimately lose by three points. Both the 49ers and Lions got touchdowns after that point, but the Lions onside kick attempt with 56 seconds left was unsuccessful, allowing the 49ers to win.\nThe 24–7 halftime lead blown by the Lions mirrors a 49ers' 24–7 halftime blown lead in the 1957 NFL Western Conference Championship game against the Lions, who later went on to win the 1957 NFL Championship Game against the Browns that season. The Lions’ collapse in the NFC Championship entered football lore as part of the Curse of Bobby Layne superstition used to explain the Lions championship drought since 1957. In addition, the 17 point comeback ties for the largest comeback in NFC Championship history.\nSuper Bowl LVIII: Kansas City Chiefs 25, San Francisco 49ers 22 (OT).\nThis was the second meeting in the Super Bowl between the Chiefs and the 49ers. The Chiefs and 49ers previously met in Super Bowl LIV in 2019, which the Chiefs won 31–20 in Miami to win their first of two Super Bowls in the Andy Reid era and first overall since Super Bowl IV in 1969. The 49ers sought their first Super Bowl victory since 1994 and their sixth overall, which would have tied them for first with the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots. The Chiefs won the game in a thrilling OT finish with a pass from Patrick Mahomes to Mecole Hardman. The Chiefs became the first team to win consecutive Super Bowls since the Patriots did so in 2003 and 2004. The Chiefs and 49ers did not meet in the regular season.\nMedia coverage.\nThree of the Wild Card games aired on NBC this postseason, which held the rights to the Saturday afternoon game under its annual rotation with CBS and Fox since 2020, the Sunday night game under the third year of a separate seven-year deal, and the Saturday night game, which was streamed exclusively by Peacock under a one-year deal. Peacock's game was sold on a stand-alone basis, as the league separated it from the broader TV rights deals that began this season. This marked the first time that an NFL playoff game was exclusively carried nationally by a streaming platform. ESPN entered its third year of their five-year deal for the Monday night Wild Card game, which was simulcast on ABC and the \"Manningcast\" alternative telecast on ESPN2. The remaining two afternoon games were carried by CBS and Fox.&lt;ref name=\"fox/cbs\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nUnder the new TV deals, the four broadcast television partners will now each air one Divisional Playoff game per season, with ESPN/ABC took over that slot that was previously rotated between CBS and Fox. CBS and Fox retained the exclusive rights to broadcast the AFC and NFC Championship Games, respectively.\nCBS televised Super Bowl LVIII this season, to be followed by Fox, NBC, and ESPN/ABC under a new annual Super Bowl rotation. Nickelodeon also had a youth-friendly broadcast of the game. CBS also has sub-licensed the Spanish-language rights for Super Bowl LVIII to TelevisaUnivision, replacing ESPN Deportes, who held the agreement for the three previous Super Bowl games aired by CBS.\nIn addition to having exclusive coverage of the Saturday night Wild Card game, Peacock also streamed NBC's other games. All of CBS' games streamed on Paramount+, and all ESPN/ABC's games streamed on ESPN+. The league's streaming service NFL+ streamed every postseason game on mobile devices only, regardless of broadcaster.\nInternational coverage.\nPrior the 2023 season, DAZN signed a ten-year agreement to distribute the NFL Game Pass International service, which offered live NFL playoff games. In select countries, the NFL has also signed local media rights deals as follows:"

        "title": "Ihumātao Rugby League Club",
        "text": "The Ihumātao Rugby League Club was a rugby league club in Auckland, New Zealand which existed from 1922 to 1923. They competed in the Auckland Rugby League 2nd grade competition in each season and had a third grade side in 1923. They represented the Ihumātao area in the Māngere suburb in Auckland.\nHistory.\n1922 formation.\nVery little was reported on the club during their two seasons in the Auckland Rugby League competition aside from their fixtures which were published weekly in the Auckland Star and New Zealand Herald. On April 4, 1922, the Auckland Rugby League management committee held their weekly meeting and reported that they had accepted the application of a new club called the “Central Mangere Club”, and they would enter a team in the second grade. The team was however exclusively named “Ihumata” for their existence and were ostensibly a Māori football side. It was a misspelling of their area's Māori name and was corrected at a later date. Over the same period another Māori team existed in the area and was originally named “Mangere Rangers” (1915-1923) before later changing to Māngere United League Football Club in 1924.\n1922 season.\nThe Ihumatao clubs first ever game was against North Shore Albions who at this time were named Devonport United following a merger with Sunnyside two years earlier. The match was played at the Auckland Domain on May 6 on the #2 field at 3pm with H Clayton refereeing. They had a bye the following week before playing their second match as the Domain, again on the #2 field, this time against City Rovers on May 20. They lost by 14 points to 0 to the eventual champions. Their 3rd game was against Otahuhu Rovers on June 10 at their home area of Māngere. The result of the match was not reported. They then had matches against Northcote &amp; Birkenhead at the Auckland Domain, Otahuhu at Otahuhu, and Manukau Rovers at the Mangere Trotting Ground. None of these results were reported.\nOn July 10 as part of the Auckland Winter Show's festivities several teams competed in events, including the Tug-of-War. The New Zealand Herald wrote “the great attractions during the evening were the tug-of-war competitions. There were three teams left in the finals, these being Marist Brothers’ League Football, Tramways, and the Ihumata Maori Football. Marist Brothers and Tramways pulled off for the first prize, the former proving victorious after a good struggle. The Maori team then pulled Tramways for second prize, and were defeated. Their first reported win on the rugby league field came in their next match, against Richmond Rovers at the Mangere Trotting Ground on July 22 at 3pm. The Auckland Star gave their try scorers as Paul (2 tries), and Wilson junior. Both of these players would go on to play for the Māngere United side in the senior grade from 1924 onwards. Over the coming weeks they had a 37–9 win against Ponsonby United in a game at Mangere on July 29, and a win against their neighbouring Māngere side by 18 points to 8 on August 5 with the well known referee Les Bull in charge. They concluded the championship with games against Manukau at Manukau, Ponsonby on the Auckland Domain, and Māngere at the Māngere Trotting Ground. Only the result of the game with Ponsonby was reported which they lost 27 to 2. Of their 14 matches played they had 3 reported wins and 3 losses with the other 8 scores unknown. It is likely that they finished roughly mid table in the 11 team competition. In the knockout competition they lost 15–13 to Manukau on September 9 at Manukau, likely the present day Waikaraka Park. Then on September 30 they played at Carlaw Park # 2 against Ponsonby in a curtain raiser to the Roope Rooster final between Ponsonby and Athletic. The Auckland Star wrote brief comments about the match but the newspaper scan in Papers Past is almost illegible, though it appears the score was possibly Ponsonby 26, Ihumatao 21.\nOn September 16 an Auckland Junior representative side played a match against the Wednesday Representatives, a side made up of the company teams which played midweek. Wilson jun. of the Ihumātao team was selected in the side on the wing. They lost 16 to 8 though Wilson set up a try for second rower Pennycock for the Junior rep team after he “snapped up the ball in his own twenty-five and ran clean through the Wednesday team. On reaching the fullback he passed to Pennycook who scored under the posts” for Perry to convert.\n1923 season, second and third grade sides.\nIn 1923 Ihumatao fielded sides in the second and third grades. They opened their season with games against Marist at the Auckland Domain #2, and Manukau #2 against Kingsland respectively on May 5.\nThe second grade side only had 4 of their 14 championship matches reported during the season which were a 16–8 loss to City on May 12, a 13–3 loss to Otahuhu on June 2, a 7–5 win over Ellerslie United on June 23, and a 16-14 los to Kingsland Rovers on June 30. On September 1 and September 15 they played knockout games against Otahuhu and Ellerslie respectively with neither score reported.\nThe third grade side played 12 games but only 4 results were reported, all losses. They were heavily defeated by Ponsonby on May 19 by 48 points to 0. They lost to Point Chevalier 22–3 at Victoria Park on June 9 and then to Parnell. Their final reported result for the season was a 32–0 loss to Manukau on July 28.\nOn September 29 the Auckland Junior representative side played a match at Huntly. Daniels of the Ihumatao side was chosen as a late replacement in the side for the match. Their last game of the season was in the Foster Shield knockout competition on October 6. They were defeated by Manukau 14 points to 5.\nThe Ihumātao club did not enter any sides in the 1924 competitions. The other Māngere side applied successfully to enter a team in the first grade competition and Paul and Wilson junior of the Ihumatao team both represented them. It is possible that the area was not able to support more than one team at this time, especially with the Manukau club also based nearly in the Onehunga suburb.\nPlaying records.\nThe results are incomplete. The \"New Zealand Herald\" and \"Auckland Star\" published the fixture list each week with details, but results were only sent to the newspapers sporadically during the season, so these records have been compiled from the known results."

        "text": "The 1924–25 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey season was the 8th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Tom Lieb in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nEntering the year, Notre Dame was hoping for a cold winter to help banish the memory of a terrible season in '24. Instead, what they got was more of the same. The team wasn't able to get any on-ice practice until mid-January and even then it was insufficient. On a positive note, many of the team's new players did have a decent amount of experience that would help once the Irish were able to play a match. While Notre Dame was unable to play at home, they only had to take a short trip down the road for the first game when the team took on Culver Academies. Hicok opened the scoring in the second and Stadel added another a few minutes later but other than that short outburst, the Irish had trouble getting their offense in order. The lack of firepower cost Notre Dame when Culver scored twice in the third to tie the match. Two uneventful overtimes did nothing to chance the score and the game was called when the light began to fade.\nThe warm winter forced the team to try and cram as many games as they could onto their schedule in February, however, five of the eight games they arranges were eventually cancelled. It was only during their trip to Minneapolis that the Irish were able to play any games the rest of the season. The first game, against St. Thomas, was fought on even terms and the two goals from captain McSorley left the team with its second consecutive tie. After a day off, the Irish came up against western power Minnesota and their defense was outstanding. Notre Dame kept the Gophers from scoring a single goal in regulation, however, the Irish offense wasn't able to capitalize and overtime was needed once more. Minnesota finally manage to break through with two goals in the extra session to take the match but Notre Dame had a chance for redemption the following night. Hicok ended the team's goal drought but Minnesota was one goal better in regulation, sweeping the games and handing the Irish another winless season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Ice hockey in Kentucky",
        "text": "Kentucky has a negligible history with ice hockey in the United States. Several attempts have been made over the years to establish ice hockey in the state, however, all have failed within a few years.\nHistory.\nWith its proximity to other hockey-rich states like Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, Kentucky has long been seen as a potential expansion site for several leagues, however, The Bluegrass state has rarely made any investment in the game. Starting as far back as the late 1940s, minor professional hockey has tried to find a home in Kentucky. The Louisville Blades were the first attempt, arriving as part of the IHL's major expansion in 1948. Though they won the league championship their first season, the team saw fit to leave for the USHL the following season. The Blades were far less successful in their new home, both on the ice and in the ticket booth. After finishing 6th out of 7 teams the Blades folded. A few years later, the IHL tried to make Louisville work a second time with the Louisville Shooting Stars. The Stars were terrible in their first season, finishing in 8th place and disbanded after the year. The end of the decade saw the IHL make a third attempt at the state when the Huntington Hornets moved to Louisville. The team had a winning record in its first three seasons and won the league championship in 1959, however, nothing the team did on the ice captured the interest of the fan base and the Louisville Rebels ceased to exist after their third season.\nAfter the multiple failed teams, Kentucky was left without an established team for 30 years. It wasn't until the mass expansion of the game in the 1990s that further attempts were made. The first was with the Louisville Icehawks in 1990. As a member of the recently formed ECHL and managed to sign an affiliation deal with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Playing out of the 6,600-seat Broadbent Arena, the team looked to have all the ingredients for a successful minor league team. The first two seasons saw the team produce decent records and advance out of the first round of the postseason, however, after missing the playoffs in year three, the team tumbled down the standings and ended the year 28 games under .500. Though they managed to win their first round series that year, the team was already in dire straits financially and suspended operations after the season. The Broadbent Arena wasn't without a hockey team for long as the Louisville RiverFrogs were founded in 1995 as a second attempt by the ECHL. After a successful first season, the Frogs missed the playoffs for two consecutive years and were then sold after the 1998 season. The new owners promptly moved the team to Florida.\nIn the meantime, ice hockey expanded beyond the borders of Louisville when the AHL placed an expansion team in Lexington. The Kentucky Thoroughblades played out of the Rupp Arena, the home of Kentucky Wildcats basketball, but managed to achieve modest success despite their locale. As a farm team for the San Jose Sharks, the Thoroughblades saw several future NHL players pass through its roster. The success of the team on the ice helped convince the AHL to place a second team in Louisville after the departure of the RiverFrogs and the league added the Louisville Panthers in 1999. In 2000, the two played one another in the first round of the playoffs, which was hoped to be the beginning of a local rivalry that could generate interest in the sport. Unfortunately, the Panthers collapsed during their second season and after finishing dead-last in the standings the team suspended operations. The dominoes continued to fall with the Thoroughblades finishing the year with an average attendance of less than 4,500 (down from the 7,800+ they commanded in 1998) and the team moved to Cleveland.\nAfter a year without a professional team, an ECHL team relocated to Lexington, using the Rupp Arena once more. The Lexington Men O' War had a moderately successful season but saw little promise in their gate receipts with less than 2,400 average attendance. The team went dormant after the season and later moved to Utah. As of 2023, no further attempts have been made to establish ice hockey in the state.\nTeams.\nProfessional Timeline.\n \nPlayers.\nThe dearth of ice hockey teams in the state and the near total lack of established junior programs have left Kentucky with one of the lowest engagement rates in the country. With less than 2,000 people registered as members of USA Hockey in 2023, in is the bottom fifth nationwide and is even worse when adjusted for population percentage (0.041%). Unsurprisingly, no player from Kentucky has yet to achieve any notability in the sport."

        "text": "The Hutt Valley cricket team represented the Hutt Valley in the Wellington region of New Zealand between 1928 and 1999. It competed in the Hawke Cup, which it won four times. Cricket in the area is now part of Cricket Wellington.\nHistory.\nCricket was played in the Hutt Valley in the early 1860s, when a Wellington team travelled to Hutt and defeated a Country Districts team in a match played \"in Mr. P. Laing's paddock\". The first Hutt Valley Cricket Association was formed early in 1899 by delegates from the Petone, Waiwetu, Western Hutt and Johnsonville clubs. They agreed that matches should be arranged against Wellington and Wairarapa. In the first match, held in Greytown later that season, Wairarapa beat Hutt Valley by 72 runs. In the first season, 1899–1900, Petone United were premiers, while Waiwetu, Koro Koro, Western Hutt, St Augustine's and Upper Hutt also competed.\nThe association lapsed after a few seasons and was not revived until 1928. It was affiliated with the New Zealand Cricket Council in 1947, thus becoming eligible to compete in the Hawke Cup.\nPlayers from Hutt Valley were always eligible to play for Wellington in the Plunket Shield. In their first Hawke Cup match, an elimination match in December 1947, Hutt Valley defeated Wairarapa, the Wellington representative Jimmy Kemp scoring 209 not out and Cedric Muir taking 12 wickets. This success qualified Hutt Valley to play in the challenge matches in 1948–49. In their first challenge match, against Wanganui in December 1948, their batting, led by Kemp and John Reid, another Wellington player, who shortly afterwards made his Test cricket debut, took them to victory. Hutt Valley then resisted several challenges until Hawke's Bay defeated them in April 1950.\nHutt Valley next won the Hawke Cup in 1955–56, when their captain, Ian Upston, took 14 wickets in the match against Wanganui. Their third victory came against Nelson in 1967–68, when George McConnell took 12 wickets and made 60 in the first innings, the only fifty in the match. They won their fourth and last victory in a high-scoring match against Nelson in 1995–96, when the captain, Selwyn Blackmore, scored 146 opening the batting.\nMany Hutt Valley players represented Wellington in the Plunket Shield. Aside from John Reid, who captained the Test team from 1956 to 1965, a number of players also represented New Zealand in Test cricket during their careers with Hutt Valley. They included Bob Blair, Bruce Morrison, Artie Dick and Ewen Chatfield.\nThe Hutt Valley Cricket Association and the Wellington Cricket Association amalgamated in 1999, thus ending Hutt Valley's independent existence and its participation in the Hawke Cup. Several teams from Hutt Valley now compete in the senior Wellington competitions."

        "text": "The 1890 Women's tennis season was a tennis circuit composed of 81 national, regional, county, and regular tournaments. The season began in January 1890 in Chepauk, India, and ended in January 1891 in Dunedin, New Zealand.\nSummary of season.\nFrom 1888 until 1912 Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), grew in status and influence to become the de facto international tennis governing body before the proper International Lawn Tennis Federation commenced operations. Despite the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) forming in 1881 a good seven years before the LTA, it was the British body that set laws, settled disputes and organized the increasingly complicated tournament calendar before the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) formed in March, 1913.\nAfter the formation of the ILTF the world tennis circuit going forward was a highly organised and structured network of national and international tournaments. Most tennis tournaments were usually mixed events for men and women, and the women's international tennis circuit certainly up to 1923 was composed mainly of tournaments on the British and European Circuits. After the USNLTA joined the ILTF this would later change with more and more tournaments being staged globally. Women tennis players on the world circuit up to the open era were funded by their national associations enabling them to travel and take part in international tournaments.\n1890 sees an increase in the number women's singles events being held as the tennis circuit continues to form. The 1890 women's tennis season began on 8 January with the first Southern India Championships staged at Madras, India. In May 1890 at the first major event of the year the Irish Championships played at the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club in Dublin, Ireland. Ireland's Louisa Martin wins the singles title beating fellow countrywoman Lena Rice, she also picks up the ladies doubles event partnered with Florence Stanuell, and completes a clean sweep by winning the mixed doubles with Grainger Chaytor.\nIn mid June 1890 the change in scheduling is continued when the U.S. National Championships are held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club, PA, defending champion Bertha Townsend loses her title to Ellen Roosevelt in straight sets.\nLater the same month the third major tournament of the year the Northern Championships played at the Liverpool Cricket Club in Liverpool Mary Steedman is the new Northern Champion beating Beatrice Wood in two sets, in the women's doubles event final Florence Mardall and Mary Steedman defeat Miss Quin and Miss Scrivener in straight sets, and the All England Mixed Doubles Championship event, is won by Katherine Hill and James Baldwin who defeat Mary Steedman and George Hillyard in the final.\nIn July at the fourth and final major event of the season the 1890 Wimbledon Championships the world's first major tennis tournament, Irish player Lena Rice reaches the final for the second year, but this time takes the title, when she defeats May Jacks in the final. The season ended on 3 January 1891 at the New Zealand Championships, held in Dunedin, New Zealand which began on 30 December 1890 and was played on grass.\nIn terms of draw sizes the Northumberland Championships with 18 entrants was the largest open ladies singles draw for 1890, the Irish Championships with 27 entrants across three disciplines singles, doubles and mixed was the largest major event of the year and was the joint largest open event of the year along with the Sussex Championships and South of England Championships also with 27 entrants. The largest event outside of Europe was the New South Wales Championships.\nSeason results.\nPrior to the creation of the International Lawn Tennis Federation and the establishment of its world championship events in 1913 the Wimbledon Championships, the U.S. National Championships, the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships and the Northern Championships were considered by players and historians as the four most important tennis tournaments to win, together effectively making an early incarnation of the Grand Slam events we know today.\nKey\nTournament winners (singles).\nThis is a list of winners by the total number of singles titles won for 1890 major titles in bold:"

        "text": "Lacrosse sixes (also known as World Lacrosse Sixes) is a variant of lacrosse played outdoors with six players on each side. The game follows similar rules to traditional field lacrosse, with modifications and a shorter game time, and is considered to be more fast-paced. Sixes has been described as a hybrid discipline of field and box lacrosse as well as a different sport entirely.\nLacrosse sixes was created in 2021 by World Lacrosse, the global governing body for lacrosse, in a bid to achieve lacrosse's participation in the Olympic Games. It will make its Olympic debut in 2028.\nHistory.\nOn May 18, 2021, World Lacrosse announced a version of field lacrosse that would be formally known as \"World Lacrosse Sixes\". Sixes was developed in order to reduce barriers to entry for lacrosse (such as cost and field size), encourage global growth, and to fit within the framework of future Olympic participation. World Lacrosse has also stated that the format would provide more parity in international lacrosse.\nThe format's first use at a major international sporting event came at the 2022 World Games in Birmingham, Alabama. \nIn 2023, lacrosse sixes was added to the program of the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, marking the first time any variety of lacrosse has been a medal event since 1908. Lacrosse sixes' Olympic inclusion parallels that of rugby sevens and 3x3 basketball, also smaller-scale versions of established sports.\nIn 2026, the first world championship events in lacrosse sixes will be held for both men and women. World Lacrosse has also announced plans for an annual Sixes World Series held across different continents.\nBeginning in 2023, the Professional Lacrosse League has run a lacrosse sixes event known as the Championship Series.\nRules.\nLacrosse sixes has similar rules for men and women but preserves some minor differences, such as the amount of contact allowed. \nThe major rule differences as compared to traditional field lacrosse are as follows:\nLacrosse sixes is viewed as less accessible for defensive field lacrosse players due to the lack of long poles, as well as face-off specialists."

        "text": "Delaware is almost a non-entity when it comes to ice hockey in the United States. With virtually no organized hockey presence beyond the high school level, Delaware has little to no impact on the sport.\nHistory.\nAs one of the smallest and least populous states, Delaware has yet to be the focus of any concerted effort by the ice hockey community. Internally, a dozen high schools play varsity hockey and have sent several players into the college ranks but very few have achieved anything of note.\nThe first formal ice hockey team in the state never actually played in Delaware. The Delaware Federals were created in 2011 as an emergency replacement by the Federal Hockey League after the Vermont Wild folded just 10 games into the season. Because the team didn't have a home arena for games or practices, the entirety of their existence was spent on the road. The Federals played 13 games before the league abandoned the experiment and simply cancelled the rest of the Vermont/Delaware schedule.\nThe State remained without an organized team until the FHL returned in 2019. The Delaware Thunder began play that season and had their home venue, the Centre Ice Rink expanded to 700 seats for their arrival. While the team was able to survive the COVID-19 pandemic, the Thunder were not successful on the ice. In 2023, the team lost 28 consecutive games, setting a new record for professional teams in North America. After the season, the Delaware State Fair, which owned the Centre Ice Rink, didn't offer the team a new lease, forcing the franchise to look elsewhere. Because the Thunder could not find a home in time for the start of the following season, they temporarily withdrew from the league while they resolved their arena situation.\nPlayers.\nDespite the states proximity to Pennsylvania and New Jersey, both of whom have long histories with ice hockey, only one person from Delaware has yet achieved any notability in ice hockey. Mark Eaton was born and raised in Wilmington and even attended John Dickinson High School but he had to travel to Pennsylvania to play high school hockey as the level of competition in the diamond state was insufficient."

        "text": "The 1924–25 MIT Engineers men's ice hockey season was the 24th season of play for the program. The Engineers were coached by Gerald Wiggett in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nMIT began their season in early November with former players Flint and Taylor putting the Engineers through their paces. While the team was only able to get ice time at 7:00 am, the team used the Boston Arena to the utmost and worked themselves into a cohesive unit. Just before the first game, the school hired Gerald Wiggett as the head coach and he arrived in time to make the final cuts. The Engineers started slow and found themselves down by a pair midway through the first. A long-distance shot from Randell just before the end of the period cut the lead in half. After Freeman tied the game at the midway point, Boston University regained their lead just 27 seconds into the third. MIT continually attacked the Terrier goal but were turned away time and again. With less than 2 minutes remaining, Morton finally broke through to tie the match and send it into overtime. Despite a concerted effort in two additional 10-minute periods, neither team was able to score and the game was declared a draw. BU requested a rematch immediately afterwards and while MIT agreed, a date for the second contest was not set until later.\nAfter surpassing their entire offensive output of last season in just one game, MIT looked ready to take on their old nemesis and met Harvard the following week. The Engineers were expecting a hard fight from the Crimson and that's exactly what they got. Unfortunately, it was more than the team could handle; Harvard's much faster team kept MIT off of the scoresheet until the third period and managed to score the first 6 goals of the match. While the Engineers held the Crimson at bay in the first, a 4-goal second period all but ended the match. Moulton's two goals in the third made the final result a bit less embarrassing but the game was Harvard's from start to finish.\nThe team had nearly a month to prepare for the next match as the winter break put most colleges on pause until after Christmas. When MIT returned the did so against another top program and had a similar result to the Harvard game. Dartmouth was easily able to outpace the Engineers and send them back to Massachusetts with another 5-goal defeat. Though the loss was undeniable, it was an improvement over the 1–11 drubbing that they had received from the Indians the year before.\nAfter another week of practice, MIT hit the road for a match with Army. The team looked like it had forgotten about their earlier defeats and played as well as it had all season. Unfortunately, the poor state of the ice prevented outstanding play and the Engineers were forced to restrict themselves to plodding along the soft ice. Randell scored the only goal for Tech and when regulation ended in a tie both teams agreed that the ice wasn't up to any more skating and agreed to call the match a draw. On their way home, the team played a match at the Briarcliff Lodge.\nThe following week, MIT was finally able to play off the tie with Boston University. The second game was just as close as the first with Randell opening the scoring in the first. BU nabbed two goals in the second to take the lead and were then able to ride the stellar play of their goaltender to a narrow victory. With Tech still looking for its first win of the season, they took a second trip to New York and met Cornell on Cayuga Lake. MIT had to defend the windy end of the rink but Berkley and Crandall played tremendously and held the Big Red back. Morton and Randell each scored to give MIT just enough offense for the win. The next night the team was in the much more comfortable Russell Sage Rink and enjoyed the fast ice. Weisser opened the scoring on a pass from Morton while Berkley's solo effort gave the Engineers a 2-goal lead. Deignan was a pillar in goal, stopping more than 50 shots in the game, but he couldn't keep everything out of the net. Hamilton scored twice to force overtime but MIT reversed the momentum and Morton scored in the first 90 seconds of extra time. Deignan and the defense combined to prevent any further goals and MIT skated away with their second win.\nMIT was looking to keep its winning streak alive when it headed up to Maine in February, however, a warm spell rendered all available rink unusable. After being unable to find any place to play, MIT had to return home without anything to show for their trip. The team rounded out its season with a game against the nation's top team, Yale. The game was marred by poor ice that slowed down both teams but the Elis, unsurprisingly, proved to be the victors. The Bulldogs started strong with three goals in the first but MIT's defense responded afterwards. Yale scored just once in the final two periods and MIT acquitted themselves well against the eventual intercollegiate champions.\nCharles E. Poore served as team manager with Richard Carroll, James Cassidy and Gordon Jacoby as his assistants.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "2024 Alpine Skiing World Cup – Women's downhill",
        "text": "The women's downhill in the 2024 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of eight events, including the final. The tentative schedule called for eleven events, but a new event, the team combined, which was scheduled for 16 February 2024 in Crans Montana, was cancelled and converted into an additional downhill on the final schedule, increasing the planned schedule to twelve. However, as discussed below in the season summary, cancellations reduced that number during the season. The season champion was Cornelia Hütter of Austria, ending a string of three straight season triumphs by Sofia Goggia of Italy, who was injured just after the midpoint of the season but still finished third.\nSeason summary.\nThe first two downhills of the season were scheduled for 18 and 19 November 2023 on the \"Gran Becca\" course on the Matterhorn, which crosses an international border between the start (Zermatt, in Switzerland) and the finish (Cervinia, in Italy); the course name comes from the local dialect in Valtournenche, in which the Matterhorn is called “Gran Becca”, meaning “big peak”. However, the first downhill of the season was cancelled due to high winds on the Matterhorn, and its rescheduling or replacement is currently not planned. The scheduled race the next day also was cancelled due to high winds, and its rescheduling or replacement is also not planned, reducing the season to ten events.\nAs a result, the first downhill was held in St. Moritz, Switzerland on 9 December, and visibility deteriorated so badly during the break after the first 30 skiers that the remainder of the race was canceled after 35 skiers; three of the five after the break failed to finish. However, the race was official since the 30 skiers had already gone, and it resulted in an upset victory for two-time defending overall champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. (only her fourth downhill win of her all-time record 91 total victories). However, Shiffrin only competed in one of the next four downhills, in Cortina, in which she crashed and was injured, and those four downhills were won by four different skiers from four different countries: Jasmine Flury of Switzerland; three-time defending discipline champion Sofia Goggia of Italy; Stephanie Venier of Austria; and Ragnhild Mowinckel of Norway. The wide distribution of results left Goggia in the overall lead at the halfway point of the season, with an 89-point lead over Venier with four races to go.\nThe following downhill, scheduled for the first week of February in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, was then cancelled due to warm weather, giving the many injured skiers on the World Cup circuit another week to recover. However, even the time off didn't affect the proliferation of injuries, with discipline leader Goggia requiring immediate surgery after breaking two bones in her right leg while doing giant slalom training in Italy, putting her on the sidelines for the rest of the season along with Swiss skiers Joana Hählen and Corinne Suter and Canadian skier Valérie Grenier, while Shiffrin also was still out after her crash in Cortina. In the first race back after Goggia's injury, at Crans Montana in Switzerland, Swiss star Lara Gut-Behrami became the sixth different winner in six races for the season, and her victory moved her to within 41 points of Goggia's season lead. and three other racers -- Venier, Flury, and Cornelia Hütter of Austria -- closed to within 100 points. The next day, a seventh different winner, Marta Bassino of Italy, took advantage of an early start time on a melting course to claim the top step of the podium ahead of Brignone and Gut-Behrami; however, Gut-Behrami took over the season lead in the discipline (with just two races to go), giving her the current lead in three of the four disciplines as well as the overall lead.\nThe next-to-last downhill of the season, in Kvitfjell, was scheduled for 2 March, but both planned training runs, on 29 February and 1 March, were cancelled by heavy snowfall, which meant the downhill could not be run (as at least one training run prior to the race is required); instead, the race was converted to a super-G to replace one of the two races in that discipline cancelled the prior week.\nFinals.\nThe World Cup finals in women's downhill were held on Saturday, 23 March 2024 in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria. For the first time since the finals began in 1993, the downhill was the last event of the finals instead of the first, with the women's race being held on Saturday and the men's on Sunday. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup downhill discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship in the discipline (Victoria Olivier of Austria), plus any skiers who had scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, were eligible to compete in the discipline final, and only the top 15 earned World Cup points. Due to injuries, six qualified skiers (Goggia, Shiffrin, Flury, Hählen, Grenier, and Laura Gauché of France) missed the finals, and one non-qualified skier with 500 points (Alice Robinson) opted to compete, so the final consisted of 21 racers.\nGut-Behrami carried a lead of 68 points over Venier and 72 points over Hütter into the final, so she only needed to tie for eighth (worth 32 points) to clinch the season title. Hütter, skiing twelfth, moved into first by half a second, but Gut-Behrami, skiing just two racers later, played it too safe and was almost two seconds behind, giving Hütter only the second downhill win of her career (about six-and-one-half years after her first, at Lake Louise in 2017) and the discipline crown for the season."

On the 9th, Saudi Arabia announced that it had submitted the official letter of intent, and signed the declaration to FIFA to bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup, and that over 70 different member associations had already pledged their support for its bid.\nPotential venues.\nThe official list of stadiums is yet to be confirmed, but it is reported that the tournament might be held in Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Qiddiya, Ḥaʼil, Neom, Najran, Abha, Al Hofuf, Al Khobar, Al Qatif, Taif and Buraidah, since stadiums in some of those cities are in development or renovation to meet FIFA World Cup standards for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup."

        "text": "The 1928–29 Union Skating Dutchmen men's ice hockey season was the 16th season of play for the program. The Skating Dutchmen represented Union College and were coached by Harold A. Larrabee in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nUnion received some welcome news at the start of the season as the city decided to build a new temporary ice rink atop the tennis courts in Central Park. The hope was that the new, larger rink would allow the team to be better prepared when it went on the road. More good new came in the form of the large contingent of players who appeared at the first practice of the season. While eleven of the twenty five candidates were freshman and would not be eligible to play until after the February exams, the continued interest would help keep the sport alive on campus. After the new year, Union's President, Frank Parker Day, announced that the school would adopt a new rule barring freshmen from participating in varsity sports. This policy had already been in effect at other institutions and was not unexpected, however, it would not come into effect until the following fall semester and didn't immediately affect the team.\nThe team's initial contest was supposed to be against Cornell at the start of the month. Unfortunately, several members of team came down with Influenza and the match was cancelled. While the team recovered, they were able to get some additional practice time in and get themselves better prepared for their first game. The Dutchmen made their first appearance of the season at Williamstown and looked equal to the task for most of the game. Union kept touch with Williams in the first two periods and entered the third tied at 1-all. Here, the superior depth of the Ephs came into play as Williams made many substitutions in the final frame and the fresh legs enabled the Purple to score four goals in quick succession to take the match. Union was then forced to cancel their match with Rensselaer due to a lack of ice.\nThe last game for the team before the midterm break was against Hamilton and the Garnet produced their best performance to date against the Continentals. While Hamilton gained an early edge, Union's defense didn't allow the blue and buff to get out of range. Henafelt knotted the score at the start of the second period while a goal from Hedinger soon after gave the Dutchmen the lead. Union held the edge until the waning moments of the third when Hamilton managed to slip the puck past Foster and send the match to extra time. After neither team could score in the first overtime, Hamilton potted two in the second overtime to take the game but Union had already proved themselves to be a much improved team.\nAfter the exam break, Union returned to the ice and met Colgate at home. Carr, a freshman, was inserted into the lineup at center with team captain Bob Beale moving to wing. Two other freshmen, Drake and Catone, got onto the ice as well but it was the veterans that were the heroes for the Dutchmen. Captain Beale led off the scoring while a pair from Henafelt gave Union the win. Foster stopped 19 shots for the Garnet's first victory in almost two calendar years. A second match with RPI the following day was cancelled due to soft ice and the two were unable to renew their rivalry.\nUnion ended its season with a pair of games that gave the fans hope for future seasons. First, the Dutchmen were forced to play St. Lawrence on Rensselaer's rink but rather than being disadvantaged by the large surface, the Garnet thrived with the open ice. Union fired 30 shots on goal and only due to the stellar play of the Larries' netminder did the game end in a draw. Henafelt, Bob Beale and Jack Beale each scored in the game. The strong contingent were able to play the final game at home and walloped St. Stephen's 8–1. Captain Beale and Hedinger each had a hat-trick while Carr recorded the first goal of his career. The superiority of the Union squad was apparent all night and the only goal they surrendered came with under a minute to play when Townsend had replaced Foster in goal.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1929–30 Union Skating Dutchmen men's ice hockey season was the 17th season of play for the program. The Skating Dutchmen represented Union College and were coached by Harold A. Larrabee in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nAfter years of contending with unsuitable conditions at the Central Park Rink, Union officials finally allowed a temporary rink to be built on campus. After the side boards were set up, the flooding began in early December when the weather became cold enough for the ice to form. The rink was able to be built thanks to a gift from H. Russell Ryder and was named in his honor. After practice was well underway, coach Larrabee was invited to represent Union at the hockey rules meeting of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The meeting was of particular interest as professional hockey had just introduced significant rule changes, particularly with regard to passing and offside. College teams were expected to keep their current rules in place and wait to change until the kinks had been worked out.\nOnce the team returned from their winter break, they found that the weather was still unkind despite their new home. The opening match with Cornell had to be cancelled due to a lack of ice, which had happened the year before as well. The school staff went to work trying to get the ice into a usable condition. Luckily, a cold spell at the end of the week enabled Union to open the season against Connecticut Agricultural. School President Frank Parker Day was on hand to drop the ceremonial first puck for the new rink and then watch as Union won its first game with a solid performance. With lineup full of veteran players, the Dutchmen attacked the Aggies relentlessly and a pair of goals from Henafelt was more than enough to carry the day. The following evening, the team took on St. John's and, while they faced a tougher opponent, the Dutchmen were no less successful. Two more goals from Henafelt paced all players and Union was off to a fast start with two wins in as many days.\nDuring the exam break, the Garnet travelled up to Vermont to take on Norwich and were locked into a tight battle. Kahn was the only Dutchmen to find the back of the net and the team relied on Foster to keep them in the match. A 10-minute overtime wasn't able to settle matters and, with the light fading, the game was called a draw. The subsequent match with Amherst was cancelled due to poor ice conditions and left the team with little practice time ahead of the game at Cornell. To make matters worse, one of the team's top defensemen, Harry Hedinger, was ruled ineligible for the rest of the year. Forbes was tasked with taking his spot while Savage was set to be used as a replacement for Werle, who was constantly handicapped due to having his stick on the wrong side. Nothing, however, prepared the team for the offensive onslaught that Cornell led with and the Big Red charged out to an insurmountable lead in first. Kahn netted the only goal for the Dutchmen in an otherwise terrible game.\nAfter warm weather caused the cancellation of three more games, the Dutchmen were able to end the season with a trip to Philadelphia. The total lack of ice ahead of the game left the team slow and rusty but they put forth a valiant effort. Union held the Quakers to 2 goals in the first two periods but their lack of conditioning caught up to them in the third when Penn got the puck behind Foster seven different times to turn the match into a route.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The Lehigh Mountain Hawks men's ice hockey team is a college ice hockey program that represents Lehigh University. The program currently operates as a club team at the Division I level but the university previously sponsored varsity ice hockey.\nHistory.\nAfter the construction of the Albeth Ice Rink in 1939, Lehigh was able to add a varsity program, furthering the expansion of college ice hockey in the Philadelphia area. The team was one of handful of clubs at the time and, while most were classified as club organizations, they were all able to play one another after reaching an agreement with the Philadelphia Arena. The league shuttered in 1942 due to World War II and remained dormant after the war's end. Lehigh, however, restarted its program in 1946 and continued on for over a decade. On the ice, the team was able to get some success in the early-50s. However, due to Albeth being an open-air rink that was designed for figure skating, the Engineers had a hard time scheduling home games. By the mid-50s, the Engineers were down to playing just a few games per year and eventually the athletic department decided against continuing the program after 1956. In spite of the lack of support, the team continued on as a club sport for several years.\nLehigh had its second revival in 1969 as the proliferation of College Division was skyrocketing. The team joined ECAC 2 upon their return and, two years later, becoming an inaugural member of ECAC 3. Lehigh produced a few good seasons in the mid-70s but the team's success did not last. For most of their time in ECAC 3, Lehigh was in the bottom half of the standings and never made an appearance in the conference tournament. After a short break in the early 80s, the school gave the program one more chance at varsity status but four more years with little to show for its efforts consigned the team to demotion. \nAfter returning to club status in 1986, the team had continued as unofficial representatives of the school. As of 2024, the team is a member of the ECHA and coached by Josh Hand.\nSeason-by-season results.\nVarsity.\nSource:"

        "text": "The 1923–24 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey season was the 7th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Tom Lieb in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nWith the departure of Paul Castner due to graduation, the leadership of the Notre Dame ice hockey team passed to Tom Lieb. Lieb had also graduated but he stuck around to earn a graduate degree and accepted the role on top of duties as an assistant with the football team. The bigger question for the team was how it would move forward after losing several of its top players. Aside from Castner, the Irish would also need to replace Percy Wilcox and Spike Flinn. The task of leading the team fell to Frank McSorley and the captain sought to keep Notre Dame as one of the top western teams.\nThe first match at Michigan was a good test for the inexperience Irish and the defense was at least up to par. Notre Dame held the Wolverines off of the scoresheet for the first half and look every bit the match of the favored home team. Though ND fell 1–3, the team was well positioned to have a good season. The following week the Irish took a road trip to Pittsburgh to play a local semi-pro team. The Irish didn't play as well as they had against Michigan but the strength of their opponent made those results far from disappointing.\nWhen Notre Dame returned home they found that the weather had once again interfered with the team's plans. The rink at Badin Hall was unusable and they had to scramble to find a suitable alternative. A rink was hastily built atop St. Mary's Lake to the west of campus and by the time the amateur club from Chicago arrived, the team had hardly been able to get in any practice time. The visitors skated rings around the Irish and handed the team another defeat. Michigan arrived for a rematch after the exam break and got off to a quick start with 2 goals in the opening frame. While the Irish were able to net one in the period, the Wolverines played the rest of the match using 4 players as defensemen. Despite the best efforts, the Irish were unable to pierce through the stonewalling and fell 1–2.\nWarming conditions made St. Mary's unusable afterwards and Notre Dame was unable to schedule any further games, leaving the team winless on the year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Ice hockey in Kansas",
        "text": "Kansas has a passing relationship with ice hockey in the United States. While there has been an increased presence in the state since the 1980s, Ice hockey remains mostly a curiosity in the Sunflower State.\nHistory.\nWhile there have been amateur clubs in Kansas since at least the 1950s, the state did not receive its first established club until 1980. The Edmonton Oilers chose to place one of their minor league teams in Wichita, inaugurating the Wichita Wind in 1980. While the team made a surprising appearance in the CHL final that season, the team never really caught the eye of the public. After winning a division title in year two, the Wind switch affiliation to the New Jersey Devils and dropped to the bottom of the standings in 1983. With both the team and league in financial difficulty, the Wind moved to Montana the following year and left Kansas without an ice hockey team for almost a decade. Wichita saw the second attempt at expansion into the state with the Wichita Thunder hitting the ice in 1992. The team quickly rose to the top of the Central Hockey League, winning the league championship in both 1994 and 1995. While the team was unable to capture a title afterwards, they still remained a fixture in the community while other franchises attempted to succeed in the plains state.\nThe sport branched out in 1998 when the Topeka ScareCrows were founded. Hoping to build a local rivalry with the Thunder, the ScareCrows were largely invisible in their three seasons in Kansas. The team made the playoffs twice but never advanced past the first round. After the club folded in 2001, a junior team with the same name was founded and played in the USHL, the top junior league in the country. The second Scarecrows weren't any more successful than the first and they moved away in 2003. A year later, another pro team moved to Topeka and became the Tarantulas. This third team lased just one season before folding.\nThree prior failed attempts didn't stop yet another team from trying to establish a team in Topeka. 2007 saw the introduction of the Topeka RoadRunners but this time the new team was able to get enough support from the locals. The RoadRunners won three division titles in their first four years, and were consistently one of the best teams in the NAHL for a decade. The team's fortunes changed in the late teens but they were still able to survive after being purchased by Lamar Hunt Jr. in 2018. After being rebranded as the 'Pilots', the team was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Plans to have the team play in Kansas City were shelved and the franchise was mothballed for the entire season and later moved to Texas after Hunt sold the club.\nDuring the RoadRunner's successful stay, two other attempts at founding junior teams in the state were made. The Wichita Jr. Thunder hoped to build in the appeal of the established club and slowly built themselves into a contender. In the club's fifth season, they won the league championship and looked to be well on their way to increasing the footprint of hockey in Wichita. Unfortunately, the team was unable to sustain that success and sunk to the bottom of the standings immediately afterwards. The Jr. Thunder was just 22 games over the next three seasons before the team was forced to shut down for the pandemic. When the league restarted in 2021, Wichita was nowhere to be seen and remain a dormant franchise. A less successful attempt was made in Topeka when the Capitals were founded in 2013. The team lasted just two years before relocating due to an impasse during lease renewal.\nSince the early 90's, the Wichita Thunder remain the only team that has been able to survive in Kansas, doing so in spite of the collapse of their original league and a subsequent move to the ECHL.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nWith a low overall population (36th in the US), low engagement (just 0.059% of the population is registered as members of USA Hockey) and little historical impact from the sport, Kansas has produced very few native players. Just one person born in Kansas has achieved any notability in the sport, however, Si Griffis was raised in Western Ontario."

        "title": "US Avignon Le Pontet 84 Rugby",
        "text": "Union Sportive Avignon Le Pontet 84 Rugby was a rugby union team representing the neighbouring cities of Avignon and Le Pontet, Vaucluse, France. It was the product of the 1998 fusion of Jeunesse Sportive Avignonaise and US Le Pontet Rugby. It went bankrupt in 2020, and was succeeded in the market by a new entity, simply called Avignon Le Pontet Rugby.\nUSAP 84 Rugby could trace its lineage to US Le Pontet XIII, a championship-winning rugby league team, which merged with US Le Pontet's rugby union section following a conflict with the French Rugby League Federation in 1989. It also claimed the unofficial legacy of rugby union team Entente Sportive Avignon Saint-Saturnin, which Jeunesse Sportive Avignonaise replaced.\nHistory.\nUS Le Pontet Rugby.\nThe organization was founded as a rugby union operation in 1919. It was part of eponymous multisports club US Le Pontet, sometimes credited Union Sportive Pontétienne. It switched codes in 1935 for the newly imported game of rugby league, and was a pioneer for the sport in the Provence region.\nThe club's rugby union team was revived in 1965 as a separate branch, although it went through bouts of inactivity during the 1970s. Meanwhile, the rugby league section rose to prominence in the 1980s under president Alain Cortade, the city's future mayor, reaching five championship finals in a row, of which it won two. In addition, it reached two Coupe de France (Lord Derby Cup) finals, winning both.\n1989 clash with FFRXIII.\nThe club was the dominant force again during the 1988-89 campaign, but their consecutive losses in that season's championship and Coupe de France finals were marred by a string of on-field incidents and objections to the federation's ensuing disciplinary actions. To protest what it saw as institutional bias, the team decided to boycott the European Club Challenge, a new competition pitting the French champion (Le Pontet had qualified by virtue of their previous year's title) against British champion Widnes RLFC for the right to challenge the Australian Rugby League champions in the inaugural World Club Challenge, on two days notice. As a result, the French federation suspended the club for twelve months, and its leadership was banned from the sport. In retaliation, the rugby league team ceased its activities and merged with the rugby union section of US Le Pontet.\nThe rekindled union team was soon promoted from 3rd Division to 2nd Division in 1990, and again to 1st Division in 1992. However, the club imploded from the resulting financial strain before it could even finish its fist season at that level, and had to restart in the lowly Division d'Honneur.\nJeunesse Sportive Avignonaise.\nJeunesse Sportive Avignonaise was founded in 1992, largely to resume the developmental activities of Entente Sportive Avignon Saint-Saturnin following that club's bankruptcy the previous year.\nFusion of US Le Pontet Rugby and Jeunesse Sportive Avignonaise.\nIn 1998, US Le Pontet Rugby merged with Jeunesse Sportive Avignonaise, and took the name Le Pontet Avignon Rugby Club 84 (PARC 84)—84 being the administrative number of the Vaucluse department. It adopted a yellow and blue scheme, which mixed the traditional colors of both cities. In 2004, the club changed its name to US Avignon Le Pontet 84 Rugby at the request of former US Le Pontet boss, and now Le Pontet mayor, Alain Cortade, who wanted to unify several Avignon/Le Pontet joint teams across different sports under the same \"US Avignon Le Pontet 84\" brand.\nBankruptcy and rebirth as Avignon Le Pontet Rugby.\nIn 2020, the club, which had been suffering from financial difficulties since 2016, went bankrupt. A successor entity was created by a new executive team, under the name Avignon Le Pontet Rugby."

        "text": "The China national bobsleigh team () is the selection representing the People's Republic of China in international bobsleigh competitions.\nThe team has participated in two editions of the Winter Olympic Games.\nHistory.\nDue to the lack of interest in winter sports, China's debut in the Winter Olympics took place only in Lake Placid 1980. Moreover, the sport of bobsleigh was seen as an expensive elite sport and thus not in line with the ideal of the socialist athlete, so much so that the Soviet Union national bobsleigh team only debuted at Sarajevo 1984 Winter Games; moreover, the Chinese Taipei national bobsleigh team representing Taiwan competed there for the first time. This led to the establishment of the Chinese Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association, which affiliated with the Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT) in 1984. For these reasons, although bobsleigh has been a sport included in Olympic events since the first edition in Chamonix-Mont-Blanc 1924, the Chinese bobsleigh team was established only after Beijing was awarded the organisation of the XXIV Olympic Winter Games of Beijing 2022. Due to its late start, China had neither tracks nor sleds of domestic production, thus having to resort to foreign-made equipment. In November 2015, the Chinese Olympic Committee appointed the German Manuel Machata as head coach of the Chinese bobsleigh team, entrusting him with the task of selecting the future Chinese bobsledders from other sports, together with Edwin van Calker. The first competitions were held in February 2016 in Calgary, Canada where the first Chinese National Bobsleigh Championships were held also in November of the following year.\nIn 2018, Chinese bobsledders appeared for the first time at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea but recorded poor results: 26th place in the four-man event(out of 29 crews) and 26th and 29th places in the two-man event (out of 30 pairs).\nAlso in 2018, a first bobled track began in China: the Yanqing National Sliding Centre also known as the 'Flying Snow Dragon' track (雪游龙S, xue yu long) in Dazhuangke village. In July 2018, team coaches were replaced, hiring Canadian Pierre Lueders (former coach of South Korea's national bobsleigh team that won Olympic silver in Pyeongchang 2018) and German André Lange.\nIn March 2021, the Winter Sports Centre of the General Administration of State Sports commissioned the automotive company FAW Group and the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation to study and build new Chinese bobsleds. After just 200 days of work, a new bobsled all \"made in China\" was unveiled on 31 December that year, described 'as fast as lightning, as light as a swallow, and as strong as a rock'.\nAt the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, the best results were recorded by women: 6th and 9th place in the women's monobob event, 11th and 22nd in the women's doubles; Chinese men came 14th and 22nd in the doubles, 16th and 17th in the four-man bobsleigh event.\nOn 18 February 2023, during the Sigulda, Latvia event of the IBSF World Championships 2023, female bobsledder Ying Qing finished third in the monobob event, allowing her to finish within the top ten in the final Women's ranking of the 2023 Bobsleigh World Cup."

He scored two tries for Brisbane against the touring 1951 All Blacks and was also selected for Queensland, with an injury preventing his state debut.\nO'Neill, capped four times for the Wallabies, made the 1952 tour of New Zealand, where he played on the wing in both Test matches against the All Blacks. He was unavailable for the 1953 tour of South Africa due to his medical studies but played against the Springboks in the home series three years later, gaining further Test caps in Sydney and Brisbane, this time as a fullback. While his Test appearances were as a fullback and winger, O'Neill was considered best suited to flyhalf."

        "text": "Brian Bernard Johnson (29 April 1930 — 25 July 1966) was an Australian rugby union international.\nJohnson, born in Coffs Harbour, was the younger brother of Wallabies centre Paul Johnson. He attended St Mary's Cathedral College in Sydney and made his first-grade debut for Gordon in 1949, winning a premiership that season.\nCapped nine times for the Wallabies, Johnson debuted in 1952 as a flanker in a home series against Fiji. He had a large role in a win over the Springboks in Cape Town on the 1953 tour of South Africa, which was their first post war loss. Starting the match at number eight, Johnson had to play a period on the wing to cover for the injured John Solomon, with his performance hailed in the press. He also twice toured New Zealand during his Wallabies career.\nJohnson, who moved to New Guinea during the 1950s, died in Goroka at the age of 36. He had been running a coffee plantation on the island and was also heavily involved in local rugby league, captain-coaching the Goroka team."

He gained an England cap against Scotland at Twickenham in 1969, when he substituted an injured Keith Fielding on the right wing after 30 minutes. His move to rival club the Rugby Lions later that year was controversial, causing Coventry to cancel future fixtures between the sides.

        "text": "Al-Shorta SC Basketball is a professional basketball team based in Baghdad, Iraq. It is a part of the Al-Shorta SC multi-sports club, whose origins date back to 1932. The team has won three Iraqi Basketball Premier League titles, most recently in the 2014–15 season, and has won one Iraqi Basketball Perseverance Cup title.\nAl-Shorta have previously reached the quarter-finals of the FIBA Asia Champions Cup, and have finished in fourth place at the Arab Club Basketball Championship and fifth place at the WABA Champions Cup. Al-Shorta finished in fourth place in the West Asia sub-zone in the 2023–24 West Asia Super League.\nHistory.\nSports teams began to form within the Iraqi Police force in 1932, starting with the football team. Basketball teams were formed under the names Madaris Al-Shorta (Police Schools) and Al-Quwa Al-Siyara (Mobile Force), and both teams participated in the Young Men's Muslim Association Cup in 1951. After the foundation of the Iraqi Basketball Association, a regional league system was established for basketball teams in Baghdad and its neighbouring cities, and it was decided that an Al-Shorta Select team would represent the Police in the top division.\nAl-Shorta Select reached the final of the Baghdad Basketball First Division Championship in 1961, but lost the championship game 62–73 to Al-Hawat. Al-Shorta Select participated in the Iraqi Liwas Basketball Cup in 1962, a competition played between select teams from different Iraqi provinces, losing their opening group match 36–58 to the Baghdad Civilian Select team. Al-Shorta Select also played matches against visiting foreign teams, including a match with the Lebanese Middle East Airlines team in Baghdad in April 1963, and a match with the American Military team on 22 November 1965 which they lost 71–107. In 1966, Al-Shorta Select lost the final of the Republican Cup by a score of 69–79 against the Armed Forces Select team.\nIn 1974, a clubs-only policy was introduced to Iraqi football, which led to the establishment of Al-Shorta Sports Club, and the club was officially registered with the Ministry of Youth and Sports in 1978. The Iraqi Basketball Premier League (the first nationwide league of basketball clubs in Iraq) was established in 1980, and Al-Shorta finished in third place in the inaugural season behind winners Al-Jaish and runners-up Al-Karkh.\nAl-Shorta won their first league title in the 1994–95 season under the leadership of coach Jabbar Kamil, and they retained the league title in the 1995–96 season, with their captain Abbas Khudhair being named the Player of the Season. In 2012, Al-Shorta participated in the Arab Club Basketball Championship and finished in fourth place. Al-Shorta won their third league title in the 2014–15 season, defeating Al-Karkh in the best-of-three final series after a three-point field goal from DeAndre Rice in the final seconds of the third game which Al-Shorta won 90–89.\nTheir title win qualified them for the 2015 Arab Club Basketball Championship and the 2016 FIBA Asia Champions Cup, reaching the quarter-finals of both tournaments, as well as the 2016 WABA Champions Cup where they finished in fifth place. From the 2016–17 season until the 2022–23 season, Al-Shorta reached the final of the Iraqi Basketball Premier League six times consecutively, but lost each time to Al-Naft. Al-Shorta won their first Iraqi Basketball Perseverance Cup title in 2022 by defeating Dijlah Al-Jamiea 87–80. Al-Shorta entered the FIBA West Asia Super League for the first time in the 2023–24 season and finished in fourth place in the West Asia sub-zone.\nPlayers.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section begin=roster /&gt;\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;"

        "title": "Ice hockey in Nevada",
        "text": "Nevada has seen tremendous interest in ice hockey recently. The appearance and success of the Vegas Golden Knights has placed the sport on at the forefront for growth in the state.\nHistory.\nNevada, as with many other mountain-west states, was overlooked by the ice hockey community for decades. With low population density and a dry, arid climate, Nevada was left without a local team until the mid-1990s. The Las Vegas Thunder arrival in 1993 brought ice hockey to the Las Vegas region, and the team was an instant success on the ice. The Thunder won two regular season titles in their first three years and were able to command crowds of nearly 8,000 per game at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center. The team was not nearly as successful over the next three seasons and the Thunder saw their average attendance drop down to just over 5,000 in 1999. The quick decline changed the relationship between Las Vegas and the owners of their arena (UNLV) and the team found itself searching for a new home after the season. When no venue was found, the franchise ceased operations.\nIn the interim, a few other hockey teams appeared throughout the state but none survived into the 21st century. After a few years without a pro team in the silver state, the ECHL arrived with the Las Vegas Wranglers in 2003. Just like the Thunder before them, the Wranglers shot out of the starting gate and reached the conference finals four times in their first six seasons. While the team wasn't able to win a championship, their early success did endear them to the fans and create a loyal pool of supporters. Unfortunately, just like the Thunder, the team was forced out of their home in 2014. The Orleans, which allowed the Wranglers to use the Orleans Arena for over a decade, decided to end the teams lease following the conclusion of the 2014 season. When Las Vegas was unable to find a new home for the following season, they suspended operations while searching for a permanent home. Plans for a new arena never came to pass as the team faded into history.\nShortly after the official demise of the Wranglers, plans were put into place to take advantage of the dearth of hockey in the state by Bill Foley. After securing deposits for more than 13,000 season tickets in the summer of 2015, Foley was one of two prospective bids that were advanced beyond the first phase. After a year's time to review, the NHL announced that they were formally accepting Foley's bid and awarded Las Vegas with a new franchise beginning in 2017.\nVegas had been one of the fastest growing cities in the United States, rising from a population of about 8,000 in 1940 to well over 500,000 by the early 21st-century. However, by 2017 the city was still missing a major professional sports team. This was largely due to the fact that Las Vegas was the central hub for gambling in the US and most leagues had a long-standing ban on wagering due to its past connections to match fixing through organized crime. With the rise in both legality and popularity of sports betting in the 21st century, Las Vegas had become less of a taboo town and the NHL was the first of the four major sports leagues to place a team in the region. The Vegas Golden Knights debuted in October 2017 and had the cities' major circuit all to themselves. That season saw major events that generated interest in the team.\nThe first, tragically, was the Las Vegas Strip shooting that saw a gunman kill 60 people while they were attending a music concert. Nine days later, at the franchise home opener, the Golden Knights held a ceremony in honor of the victims and served as a rallying point for civic pride for the remainder of the season, similar to what the Boston Red Sox had done following a terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon in 2013. Vegas went so far as to retire the number 58 in honor of the fifty eight people who had died immediately following the attack.\nSecondly, and on a much happier note, the Golden Knights ended up producing the best season in the history of any expansion team in North American pro sports history. While most new teams finish with poor records and typically miss the postseason, Vegas took advantage of several personnel miscues by other teams and put together a roster that was able to compete straight away. The Golden Knights won the Pacific Division title in their first season and proceeded to march all the way to the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals. While the team was unable to win the cup that year, the shocking success led to a huge amount of publicity and interest in the team. Vegas continued as one of the better teams for the next seral years and made its second championship appearance in 2023, this time managing to win the Stanley Cup. In the meantime, Vegas had founded a minor league team and placed it in nearby Henderson, Nevada, while an unaffiliated junior team had started up in the Vegas suburb of Summerlin South.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nAs Las Vegas has been the center of ice hockey in the state, its perhaps unsurprising that the majority of players have come from the area. While Nevada does not have a long history with the sport, it has nonetheless produced several players of note."

        "text": "Idaho has seen scant interest from ice hockey in the United States. In spite of small investments, the state has seen a decent amount of engagement from residents.\nHistory.\nIdaho was one of several Rocky Mountain states that was ignored by the ice hockey community at large for many years. It wasn't until the mid-1990s that the gem state received its first professional team. For its third season, the West Coast Hockey League add the Idaho Steelheads as part of its 5-team expansion. The team was middling at best during its first three seasons but that didn't seem to deters fans. The Steelheads averaged just shy of 5,000 per game and they rewarded the patience of the locals when the team reached the league finals in both 2001 and 2002. However, in 2003 the team faced an uncertain future when the WCHL collapsed. Fortunately, the remaining six teams were accepted into the ECHL and the Steelheads promptly won the league championship. After a second title in 2007, the team remained one of the better ECHL clubs but they faced a few problems. Following the Great Recession in 2008, the team saw its attendance figures drop below 4,000 and didn't see any significant recovery for a decade. While the Steelheads managed to survive the downturn, most of their former WCHL compatriots did not. One after another, all of the ECHL's western additions failed, and by 2017 only three ECHL were left in the western half of the United States. Despite losing most of their rivals, Idaho soldiered on and saw its attendance figures swell. Even after the team was forced to cease operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, Idaho brought in move than 5,000 fans per game for the first time in its history in 2022.\nHoping to bank on the success of the pro team, a few attempts were made at placing junior teams in the area. The Idaho Rattlers lasted for parts of three seasons, suspending operations in December 2006. A little over two years later, a more successful attempt was made with the Idaho Jr. Steelheads. The team was an immediate hit, finishing second in their division in their inaugural season before winning 8 consecutive division crowns. In that span the Jr. Steelheads won three overall league titles and five Western States Hockey League Championships. A conflict over their name with the pro Steelheads led the junior club to rebrand as the IceCats in 2017 but the change didn't amount to much. Despite their unqualified success, the team became less of a draw and saw a few as 50 fans per game on some nights. With volunteers and staff feeling the effects as well, the team suspended operations in 2018.\nThe state was left without a junior team for several years but it finally returned in 2023 with the debut of the Idaho Falls Spud Kings.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nThough the sport has only recently seen investment in the sport, Idaho has decent engagement numbers. As of 2022, 0.225% of residents were registered with USA Hockey, putting the state in the middle third of the nation and right between Pennsylvania and Illinois. While the low overall population means that only amounts to 4,600 people, a few native Idahoans have gone on to achieve notability."

The following season, he took the same role with another expansion team – the Columbus Checkers. He left the team after its inaugural season to become the administrative coordinator of the Muskegon Mohawks. In 1969, Gallagher started another IHL team, the Flint Generals. He sold the team in 1975 and retired to Florida.\nWhen commissioner Bill Beagan left the IHL for the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League, Gallagher came out of retirement to serve as interim commissioner for the remainder of 1978–79 season.\nAmateur Hockey Association of the United States.\nGallagher was the longtime vice president of the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (now USA Hockey).

After coming into the team for Cyril Burke, who had been a Wallabies regular since the end of the war, Cox played four consecutive internationals, including a win over the All Blacks in Christchurch. A fractured ankle then cost him a place on the 1953 tour of South Africa and thereafter the selectors alternated between him and Burke as preferred scrum-half.

He also played rugby league for Eastern Suburbs.\nA native of Wagga Wagga, McMullen was educated at Wagga Wagga High School and played both codes growing up.\nMcMullen, a rugby union scrum-half, toured New Zealand with New South Wales Country in 1960. It was his performance against the touring All Blacks two years later, in New South Wales' one-point win at the Sydney Sports Ground, that earned him Wallabies selection as a reserve for the 2nd Test. After being picked for that year's reciprocal tour of New Zealand, McMullen displaced Ken Catchpole to debut at scrum-half in the 1st Test in Wellington.\nFrom 1964 to 1967, McMullen played first-grade rugby league for Eastern Suburbs, mainly as a halfback.\nMcMullen died of a brain tumour in 1986 at the age of 44."

        "text": "The Quebec Challenge Cup (French: \"Coupe challenge Québec\") is a curling challenge trophy. It has been continually contested since 1874, and is thought to be the oldest competitive sport trophy in North America, and the second oldest amateur sporting event in the world. It is competed between curling clubs who are members of Curling Québec and the Ottawa Valley Curling Association.\nFormat.\nAs a challenge trophy, the cup is competed between two clubs: one that currently holds the trophy, and the club that is challenging for it. The competition involves a 10 end \"double rink\" curling game, where both clubs field two teams to play against the opposing club. The final results are based on cumulative scoring on the two sheets. In the case of a tie, the team that is defending the trophy retains it. The defending team hosts the challenge. There are currently 52 clubs that compete for the trophy, and nine challenges per season, which occur every two to three weeks. Clubs must follow the rotation schedule to compete for the trophy, meaning a wait of 5–7 years per challenge.\nThe Cup is run by the \"Canadian Branch\", the former governing body of curling in Quebec, from when it was a branch of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club in Scotland. The Canadian Branch is now a separate curling body that oversees competitions among clubs in the Ottawa Valley Curling Association, the Grand National Curling Club and Curling Québec.\nHistory.\nThe Quebec Curling Club bought a silver trophy meant to \"foster inter-club play\" among clubs in the Dominion of Canada on January 19, 1874, for $400 or $700. The first competition was held on February 16, 1874, and involved playing 18 ends with iron stones, instead of the granite rocks used in today's curling. The host Quebec Curling Club team, skipped by William Barbour and William Brodie defeated the Montreal Caledonian Club skipped by W. McGibbon and W. Wilson, 56–37 (Barbour defeated McGibbon 23–19, and Brodie defeated Wilson 33–18). The following season, the two clubs faced off again on January 19 with the same skips. The Quebec Club retained the title, defeating Caledonia 58–38 (Wilson winning 23–21 over Brodie and Barbour winning 37–13 over McGibbon). Nine days later, the Caledonian Club finally won the trophy, beating Quebec by a single point, 46–45. The Montreal Thistle Club then won it before Quebec took it back before the end of the season. In its history, the cup has been challenged for over 1000 times. For the 1000th challenge, instead of the regular challenger versus defender game, the event featured eight clubs from the OVCA competing against eight clubs from Quebec, with Quebec winning by a combined score of 70 to 56.\nTraditions.\nThe cup involves many alcohol traditions. One such noted tradition is that following the match, the cup is filled with a rusty nail cocktail (Scotch and Drambuie) and passed between competitors. Following the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, this tradition has been altered, with the drink being poured out into glasses for each competitor instead. Another tradition involves taking a break after five ends to drink, and having the team's leads take a shot of scotch before the game. The host also provides a post-game dinner for both teams.\nEligible clubs.\nSome clubs no longer exist, but still pay dues to the Canadian Branch and so can still compete. The clubs listed on the rotating schedule are: Cornwall, Ottawa, Windsor, Lennoxville, Montreal West, Hudson Whitlock, Brockville, Navy, Baie-D'Urfé, Winchester, Almonte, Prescott, Border, Mont-Bruno, Glengarry, RCMP, Lancaster, Alexandria, Renfrew, Lachine, Otterburn Legion, TMR, Arnprior, North Grenville, Pembroke, Deep River, Laval-sur-le-Lac, Carleton Place, Carleton Heights, Huntingdon, Ottawa Hunt, Cowansville, Governor General's, Manotick, Lanark Highlands, Pakenham, Pointe-Claire, Morrisburg, Danville, Lacolle, Richmond, Sherbrooke, Celanese, Metcalfe, Bedford, Glenmore, St. Lambert, Sutton, Dalhousie Lake, Ormstown, Bel-Aire and Royal Montreal."

Since 1982, the association has been a member of the FIVB and the CEV.\nFor the first time the Northern Ireland women's national team was formed in 1983 to participate in the traditional Spring Cup tournament, which had been held since 1962 for men and (for women – since 1973) on the initiative of volleyball federations from Western European countries. The debut for the Northern Irish team was unsuccessful, they finished in the 12th place among 12 teams.\nFrom 1986 to 1991, the British Isles Volleyball Championship was held, and the Northern Ireland team was a regular participant in this tournament. Their best result so far was the 2nd place, taken in 1989.\nThe debut of the Northern Ireland women's national team in official international tournaments under the auspices of the FIVB and CEV took place only in May 2013, when the Northern Irish first entered the World Championship qualifying tournament. In their qualifying group in Kortrijk, Belgium, the team lost to all three of their opponents with the same score of 0:3, and in the games against Switzerland and Belgium they failed to score more than 10 points in any of the games, and the second set against the Swiss team ended with the result of 2:25 (!). The ratio of games was slightly better only in the match against the Portuguese national team.\nSuch a disappointing result did not discourage the leadership of the national association, and a year later the Northern Ireland national team for the first time took part in the qualifying tournament of the European Small Nations Championship. In the opening match of their qualifying group Northern Ireland achieved their first victory, defeating their southern neighbors – the national team of Ireland . In the other four matches the Northern Irish were defeated by the national teams of Scotland, Malta and Cyprus, failing in any of the sets of these matches to overcome the 15 points.\nThe Northern Ireland national team performance was poor in the qualification of the 2017 European Small Nations Championship, which was held in June 2016 in Luxembourg. This stage of the championship was also the first round of qualifying for the 2018 World Championship. In all three matches played against the teams of Luxembourg, Scotland and Iceland, the Northern Irish suffered a heavy defeats, with the 2nd set of the match with the Scots it was lost with a score of 04:25, and in the match against the Icelandic national team the total scores was only 27 points."

Based on the 2011 novel of the same name by Deborah Levy, the film stars Christopher Abbott, Mackenzie Davis and Ariane Labed. The film revolves around Joe and Isabel, whose marriage is dying when Kitti, a naked stranger is found floating in the pool at their holiday villa. It is described as \"a surreal and darkly comic journey into the unresolved traumas that lurk in the shadows of all our lives.\" The film is a co-production between companies based in the United Kingdom and France. \nThe film competed in Tiger Competition at 53rd International Film Festival Rotterdam, where it had its premiere on 29 January 2024.\nProduction.\nThe film is an adaptation of Deborah Levy's Man Booker Prize-nominated novel of the same name. It was introduced at Cannes film market by the Bankside films. A directorial debut of Justin Anderson, it was funded by Curzon, Cineart and Madman Entertainment's Curzon CM Development Fund.\nThe film starring Ariane Labed, Christopher Abbott and Mackenzie Davis is produced by Emily Morgan of the United Kingdom's Quiddity Films, Andy Starke of Rook Films, Paula Linhares and Marcos Tellechea of Brazil's Reagent Media and Giorgos Karnavas and Konstantinos Kontovrakis of Greece's Heretic and Leontine Petit and Erik Glijnis of Lemming Film. It began filming in October 2022 in Greece.\nRelease.\nThe film had its world premiere at 53rd International Film Festival Rotterdam on 29 January 2024.\nThe film produced by Anti-Worlds, Quiddity Films, Reagent Media and Heretic in co-production with Lemming Film, is distributed by Bankside Films, WME and UTA.\nReception.\nVictor Fraga writing in DMovies rated the film with 3/5 and wrote, that through \"at times, \"Swimming Home\" drowns in its own extravagance and conceit, nevertheless, Justin Anderson’s debut feature will please many cinephiles, and it likely won’t be his last.\" Peter Bradshaw reviewing for \"The Guardian\" rated the film with 2 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Justin Anderson's film insists on a bafflingly unsexy and uninteresting type of erotic tension and conflates the result with a supposed repressed agony from the Bosnian war – which is invoked in the most glib and perfunctory way.\" Wendy Ide writing for ScreenDaily stated that \"\"Swimming Home\" is a striking but willfully confounding experience.\" Ide opined, \"It will not be for everyone, and the knotty symbolism of the storytelling may be better suited to its original form as a novel than to this film.\" She felt that \"there’s a disconcerting, jarring quality to the story that is hard to shake – this is likely to be a conversation starter at further festivals and could find a home with a curated streaming platform.\"\nDavid Katz reviewing for Cineuropa wrote that the film \"is set in a filmic world several degrees away from real, from the tart and stilted repartee of the actors’ dialogue to its later sequences in a fetish-dance club and nudist lagoon that feel like landscapes of the unconscious.\""

When I potted the pink I tried to enjoy the moment.\" The loss meant that Robertson's ranking has dropped out of the top 16, a position he had held since 2006. He also had to qualify for the World Championship for the first time since 2006. Robertson described the loss as \"tough one to take\", commenting on social media that he \"played three brilliant frames [from 34 behind] but wasn't meant to be, just a centimetre out here or there on and couldn't get through.\"\nFinal.\nThe final was a best-of-19-frames match, being played over two on 24 March, officiated by Zhu Ying, between Trump and Ding.

Ding narrowed the score to 13 at the mid-session interval, but Trump won the next four frames, making breaks of 59, 79, and 78, to extend his lead to 71. Ding made the first century break of the match in the last frame of the session, a 106, to trail 27.\nIn the second session, Trump won the opening frame with a 130 break, and scored 35 in the 11th frame, but fouled when a red went into the pocket as the cue ball into the after he potted the blue, and Ding took the frame with a break of 84. Trump closed to one frame from victory at 93 with a 106 break in the 12th frame, and Ding won frame 13 to narrow the score to 94 at the mid-session interval. When play resumed, Ding potted a difficult long red, but he missed the routine black in the following shot. Trump capitalised on the error to make a 58 break before missing a red to the , and Ding narrowed the score to 5258, helped by 16 foul points conceded by Trump from a on the last red. Ding went from an attempted long red, allowing Trump to capture the frame and match 104, winning his second World Open and successfully defending the title.\nIt was Trump's fifth ranking title of the season, following his three consecutive wins at the 2023 English Open, the 2023 Wuhan Open, and the 2023 Northern Ireland Open, in addition to the 2024 German Masters. The win marked Trump's third time winning five or more ranking events in a single season, having previously done so in the 2019–20 and the 2020–21 seasons. The only other players that have achieved the feat were Stephen Hendry in 1990–94, Ding in 2013–14, Selby in 2016–17, and Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2017–18. It was also Trump's 28th career ranking title, matching the tally of Steve Davis. Trump said after the match: \"Ding had been playing really well this week so I thought it was going to be tough. I managed to dig in during the afternoon and get a good lead, then played my best stuff of the tournament tonight. I didn't want to give Ding the chance to start winning frames and let the crowd get behind him.\" He added: \"As I have got older I have learned not to punish myself when I miss easy balls. So much of snooker is in the head, if you can be in the right space mentally then you have a big advantage. I am a lot more consistent in that respect these days.\"\nMain draw.\nThe draw for the tournament is shown below.

        "text": "The 1923–24 RPI Engineers men's ice hockey season was the 21st season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nFor the first time since before the war, Rensselaer was left without a hockey coach. After the departure of Leroy Clark, the squad was ostensibly run by team captain John Reuther. He, along with the team manager, put together a normal slate of games for the Engineers and the team set about practicing once the weather became cold enough. Unfortunately, while the team was able to get some practice in, their match with YMCA College had to be postponed. That meant Middlebury would be the first opponent of the season and that couldn't have turned out better for RPI. The Engineers won the match 2–0 and then prepared themselves for YMCA the following week. The game was held in a snowstorm but the ice was good enough to see Rensselaer earn its second victory of the year.\nWith the program on the cusp of its first winning season in 17 years, RPI had a 2-week break before they hit the road and met Hamilton. Unfortunately, in the interim, Reuther was forced to leave the team. Dureau was appointed acting captain but was unable to prevent RPI from being routed in the match. While the team may have been able to mollify itself with the fact that the Continentals were one of the best programs in the country, their subsequent opponents could not say the same. A week later, still without their captain, the team faced Cornell and were completely swept off of the ice. The Big Red scored 13 goals and, while Bolieau scored once for RPI, it didn't make the final score any less embarrassing. The final game was little better and Rensselaer resumed their capital district rivalry against Union with an 0–7 drubbing.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "West Side Park was the name of two different baseball parks in Jersey City, New Jersey in the early 20th Century. Both parks were also called Skeeters Park in reference to the long-time nickname of the teams, the \"Jersey City Skeeters\", so called because of the many mosquitoes (\"skeeters\") which lived in Jersey City's marsh lands.\nFirst ballpark.\nThe first West Side Park was the home of the Jersey City Skeeters of the Eastern League from 1902 through 1905.\nThe ballpark's location was given in local newspapers as \"West Side Avenue and the foot of (or 'end of') Belmont Avenue.\" The city directories gave a less precise location, \"West Side Avenue.\" The lot was leased from the Jersey City Golf Club.[Jersey City News May 7, 1902, p. 1] [Jersey City News September 29, 1902, p. 7] [Jersey City News October 18, 1902, p. 7]\nIts location has also been given as \"West Side Avenue (east); Belmont Avenue (south); Marcy Avenue (west); and Duncan Avenue (north).\"\nThe 1903 club was successful, winning the league championship for the only time in the club's years of operating along West Side Avenue.\nWhen the Hudson County Park Commission began to develop a new public park in 1904, the ballpark stood in the way of its planned entrance road. In 1905, the city informed the Skeeters they would have to find another venue by 1906.[Jersey Observer and Journal, July 28, 1905, p. 1]\nThe new city park was also dubbed West Side Park. The potential for confusion was mitigated by the papers often referring to the ballpark as \"West Side Park baseball grounds\". The public park was eventually renamed Lincoln Park, in 1930.\nSecond ballpark.\nThe second West Side Park ballpark was the home of the Jersey City Skeeters of the Eastern League / International League from 1906 through 1915, and then again from 1918 through 1933.\nThe ballpark's location in city directories from 1908 onward was given as \"Jersey City Baseball Grounds, West Side Avenue corner Fisk Street.\" It was about mile southwest of the previous ballpark.\nNewspapers reported the location as \"West Side and Culver Avenues.\"[Jersey Observer and Journal, July 28, 1905, p. 1][Courier-News 7-29-1905 p. 5][Jersey Observer and Journal, April 18, 1906, p. 2][Jersey Journal 5-1-1998 p. 31]\nIts precise location, as shown in Sanborn maps, was West Side Avenue (northwest, first base); Bay View Avenue (not a through street there) and then Culver Avenue (northeast, third base); buildings and Hudson Boulevard (now JFK Boulevard) (southeast, left field); and Audubon Street (southwest, right field). Fisk teed into West Side Avenue from the west, near the main grandstand entrance.\nThe Skeeters struggled financially, and in 1916 they moved to another city. They were revived in 1918 but then moved again after the 1933 season as the Great Depression combined with their lack of on-field success compelled them to move permanently.\nOne attempt to impact attendance was to shorten the home run distances. The original ballpark's dimensions were rather expansive. In 1928, left field was reduced from to , and right field from to .[Berkshire Eagle, Apr 6, 1928, p.31]\nLater.\nAfter the Skeeters folded, the ballpark site was acquired by the school later known as New Jersey City University. They had already constructed their main building east of the ballpark in 1927. After they demolished the ballpark, they constructed a number of additional campus buildings on the block.\nWhen minor league baseball returned to Jersey City in the late 1930s, the new Jersey City Giants occupied the recently-built Roosevelt Stadium. The Giants would win the IL titles for 1937 and 1949."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Iowa",
        "text": "Iowa has become one of the key regions for junior ice hockey in the United States.\nHistory.\nDespite being next door to hockey-mad Minnesota, Iowa's relative lack of natural ice surfaces made it difficult for the sport to catch on in the Hawkeye state. The low population density also meant that there were few locales that could support an artificial ice rink. These factors contributed to the state not receiving its first major ice hockey team until the late 1950s. At the time, the United States Central Hockey League, a senior league that operated mostly out of Minnesota, saw many of its previous teams cease operations in 1958. In order to keep the league alive, several new clubs were started, including the Des Moines Ice Hawks. The franchise survived for three years before the league rebranded itself as the United States Hockey League and became a semi-pro circuit. The Ice Hawks changed their names to the Des Moines Oak Leafs and got a big boost when the Des Moines Ice Arena opened its doors in November 1961. The club remained with the USHL for two years before leaving to join the fully professional International Hockey League in 1963. The team had some success over the years, reaching the finals in '65 and '71 but it wasn't until after they changed their named to the Des Moines Capitols that they won a league championship. Success, however, came too late for the team and after one more season they ceased operations.\nMeanwhile, the USHL saw potential in Iowa and continued to expand with the addition of the Waterloo Black Hawks in 1962. The Black Hawks were an instant success, winning the league championship in their second season to begin a run of five consecutive titles. The USHL then added the Sioux City Musketeers in 1972 but Waterloo remained at the forefront, adding three more titles in the 70s. In 1979, the USHL was operating as mostly an afterthought behind at least 4 other professional leagues (NHL, AHL, IHL and CHL). In order to keep the league alive, the teams switched from senior hockey to junior hockey. At the time, junior hockey circuits were run almost exclusively out of Canada aside from U.S. high school programs. However, because the major Canadian Hockey League league paid their players a stipend, the NCAA had ruled that participating players were ineligible to play college hockey. The USHL stepped in to fill the void, becoming the first major junior league in the US. After its inaugural season in 1979–80, the league continued its expansion into Iowa with the Black Hawks relocating and becoming the Dubuque Fighting Saints. The Hennepin Nordiques, who had only been around for a year, then moved to Waterloo, taking over the name and ensuring that there was no loss of ice hockey in Black Hawk County. That same year, the USHL returned to the capitol with the Des Moines Buccaneers.\nWith four team spread across the state, the USHL was now primarily located in Iowa, a situation that became even more noticeable when a team in Wisconsin folded in 1981 and was replaced by the North Iowa Huskies in 1983. While there was a rapid expansion with junior hockey, Iowa was largely ignored by the professional ranks. Because the Capitols had failed to catch on and the Iowa Stars had lasted just one year, no teams were willing to take another gamble in the midwestern state. Unbothered by the lack of professional hockey, the USHL remained the premier league in Iowa and was buoyed by the on-ice success of its many teams. Dubuque and Sioux City combined for four championships in the 1980 but the 90s belonged to the Buccaneers. Des Moines won 3 championships to go with 4 regular season titles. Not everything was successful, however, and the USHL did go through some perturbations around the turn of the century.\n1999 saw the Huskies relocate to Cedar Rapids, where they found more success. The Fighting Saints, however, were not so lucky. The team had fallen on hard times in the late 90s and owner, Brian Gallagher, decided to relocate to Oklahoma in 2001. The move did not pan out and the team lasted just one more season before disbanding. Dubuque would not be without a team for long as the Dubuque Thunderbirds began play in 2001. Though they played at a lower level than the USHL, the team was an unqualified success. The Thunderbirds won four championships in two leagues during their 9-year existence but, critically, they had a massive amount of fan support. In their final three years, the team drew over 32,000 in total attendance which accounted for about 40% of the Central States Hockey League's figures. The sizable crowds convinced the city to build a new rink and began construction of the Mystique Ice Center in 2009. The following season the Thunderbirds ceased operations, bowing out in favor of the second Dubuque Fighting Saints franchise and the return of major junior hockey. The team announced its appearance by winning the league championship in its inaugural season and followed that with a second two years later.\nWith junior hockey proving to be such a success in Iowa, professional hockey did eventually return when the Dallas Stars placed their AHL affiliate to Des Moines in 2005. The arrangement lasted three years before the Stars ended their affiliation, citing travel costs. The team then came under the purview of the Anaheim Ducks and was renamed \"Iowa Chops\". After the season, the team was suspended by the AHL for violating league by-laws by being used as collateral for a loan. After losing their affiliation with the Ducks, the team was sold to the Dallas Stars and relocated to Texas.\nIowa was left without pro hockey for four years until the Minnesota Wild relocated their main affiliate to the region. The Iowa Wild played their first game in 2013 and played in the same building as the Stars/Chops (the Wells Fargo Arena). While the team has not seem much on-ice success, the Wild consistently draw crowds of 6,000 or more to their games. The stability of the state's hockey franchises eventually led to the ECHL's arrival in 2021 when the Iowa Heartlanders were introduced. The state received its first college hockey program in 2023 due in part to unfortunate circumstances at another university. Due to financial problems, Finlandia University was forced to close after the 2022–23 academic year. The athletic department was able to make an arrangement with the University of Dubuque to absorb both its men's and women's ice hockey programs with most of its players transferring in the process.\nTeams.\nJunior.\nInactive.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nThe existence of several junior teams across the state has given many communities access to local rinks and allowed the state to produce several players of note. Despite this, Iowa still has a relatively low level of engagement with the sport as less than 4,000 residents were registered with USA Hockey in 2022."

        "title": "2023–24 Northeast Conference men's basketball season",
        "text": "The 2023–24 Northeast Conference men's basketball season began with practices in October 2023, followed by the start of the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's basketball season on November 6. Conference play started in early January and ended on March 2, 2024. This was the 43rd season of Northeast Conference men's basketball. Merrimack was the defending regular-season and conference tournament champion. Due to Merrimack's ineligibility as a team transitioning from Division II, Fairleigh Dickinson represented the conference in the 2023 NCAA tournament and advanced to the second round.\nCentral Connecticut and Merrimack were co-champions of the 2023–24 NEC regular season, giving Merrimack the title in two straight years.\nThe NEC tournament was held in March with the higher-seeded team hosting each game. The top eight teams in the conference standings qualified for the tournament. Wagner defeated Merrimack in the tournament final to win the program's second NEC tournament title and advance to the NCAA Division I tournament for the second time in school history. Wagner's only previous NEC tournament title and NCAA tournament appearance came in 2003.\nWagner received the overall no. 68 seed of the 68 teams in the NCAA tournament but defeated Howard in the First Four for the program's first ever NCAA tournament victory. The Seahawks then fell to North Carolina in the first round.\nThis was the final season for two NEC members. Merrimack and Sacred Heart will leave the conference after the 2023–24 school year to join the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. At the same time, Chicago State will join the NEC after two seasons as a Division I independent, and Mercyhurst will begin its transition from Division II as a new member of the NEC.\nOffseason.\nAt the conclusion of the previous season, St. Francis Brooklyn, a charter member of the NEC, discontinued its entire athletic program.\nOn March 21, 2023, Fairleigh Dickinson head coach Tobin Anderson was named the head coach at Iona, replacing Rick Pitino who had departed for the head coaching position at St. John's. Anderson's assistant, Jack Castleberry, was immediately promoted to Fairleigh Dickinson's head coaching position.\nLe Moyne College joined the Northeast Conference from the Division II Northeast-10 Conference effective July 1, 2023. Le Moyne is not eligible for the NCAA tournament until the 2027–28 season, when its four-year reclassification period ends.\nEffective for the 2023–24 academic year, NEC teams transitioning from Division II are eligible for the NEC tournament during the entirety of their transition periods. If a reclassifying institution wins the NEC tournament championship, the tournament runner-up will be awarded the NEC's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. If two reclassifying teams reach the final of the NEC tournament, the conference will stage an automatic qualifier game between the two non-advancing semifinalists. Previously, transitioning NEC teams were eligible for the conference tournament only during their third and fourth transition years. The rule change results in Stonehill and Le Moyne being eligible for the 2024 NEC tournament, since Stonehill is in its second transition year, and Le Moyne is in its first.\nPreseason.\nPreseason coaches' poll.\nThe table below shows the preseason rankings of NEC teams based on a poll of the conference's coaches as well as each team's preseason Pomeroy ranking among the 362 Division I teams.\nPreseason All-NEC team.\n\"Source:\" \nRegular season.\nEarly-season multi-team events.\n\"Source:\" \nPre-conference season notes.\nOn November 6, 2023, the season's opening night, Fairleigh Dickinson returned to action following their historic upset and run in the 2023 NCAA tournament in the head coaching debut of Jack Castleberry. Jo'el Emanuel recorded his first career double-double, which included career highs of 24 points and 11 rebounds, to lead the Knights to a 92–86 road win at Buffalo.\nThe following night, Le Moyne made its debut as an NEC member and a Division I program. Darrick Jones Jr. hit a three-pointer from the top of the key early in the game at Georgetown for the Dolphins' first points scored as a Division I program. Ball State transfer Kaiyem Cleary led Le Moyne with 11 points, all in the second half, and seven rebounds, but it was not enough as the Dolphins fell to the Hoyas, 94–57.\nMax Zegarowski matched his career high with six three-pointers and scored 21 points and grabbed eight rebounds to lead Stonehill to a 57–44 victory over Army West Point in the Skyhawks' home opener on November 9.\nLe Moyne used first-half runs of 16–2 and 20–2 to build a 47–15 lead and never looked back on their way to a 105–46 victory, their first as a Division I program, over Division III SUNY Canton in their home opener on November 13. Five Dolphins had double-figure scoring games led by Kaiyem Cleary with 21 points, Nate McClure with 16, Darrick Jones Jr. with 13 and freshman AJ Dancler with 12. Redshirt freshman Nate Fouts made his collegiate debut and scored 11 points with three assists and two blocked shots. Cleary shot 8 for 10 from the field, while adding seven rebounds and two steals in just 16 minutes. McClure hit six of his seven shots, including 4-for-5 shooting from three-point range. Dancler grabbed five rebounds and dished out five assists. The Dolphins shot 32-for-37 on two-point field goals for the game, including 15-for-16 in the first half.\nIn a November 15 game dubbed the Battle of the Bracket Busters, Fairleigh Dickinson hosted Saint Peter's, a team which made an unexpected run of its own to the Elite Eight at the 2022 NCAA tournament, upsetting both the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in their region along the way. The matchup between the North Jersey neighbors was the first to be broadcast on YES as part of the Knights' new local television contract. Fairleigh Dickinson shot 7-for-13 on three-pointers in the first half and built a 43–34 lead at the break. The Peacocks used a 9–0 run to cut the Knights' lead from 13 down to four with 2:39 to play. Nursing a two-point lead in the final minute, Fairleigh Dickinson failed to score, and a three-pointer by Michael Houge gave Saint Peter's a 70–69 lead with nine seconds on the clock. Knights head coach Jack Castleberry elected not to call time-out. DeVante Jamison, who finished with 11 points, five assists and three steals, took the ensuing inbounds pass, dribbled up the floor and was fouled in the act of shooting with 2.3 seconds remaining. Jamison hit both free throws, and the Knights held on for a 71–70 victory. Ansley Almonor led Fairleigh Dickinson with a game-high 21 points, and Jo'el Emanuel scored 16 on 6-for-7 shooting from the field.\nNico Galette came off the bench to score 21 points, including the 1,000th of his career, on 9-for-11 shooting and pull down six rebounds to lead Sacred Heart to an 89–75 home win over Binghamton on November 21. Tanner Thomas added 16 points and six rebounds for the Pioneers.\nLater that evening, Le Moyne recorded its first victory over a Division I opponent as a Division I program, an 80–70 win at Cal State Northridge in the Dolphins' opening game of the Golden State Hoops Jam, a multi-team event sponsored by Pacific. Luke Sutherland led the Dolphins with 24 points and five rebounds. Le Moyne started five graduate students for the first time in the program's history, and they responded by sprinting to an 11–4 lead to start the game, getting early scoring from Sutherland, Nate McClure (12 points, four rebounds and three steals for the game) and Isaiah Salter. After Le Moyne fell behind, 15–12, Mike DePersia (eight points, nine assists, four rebounds and three steals for the game) sparked a 19–2 run with a pull-up jump shot. The Matadors got no closer than three points behind the rest of the way. The Dolphins closed out the game with strong free-throw shooting, finishing the game 31-for-34 from the free-throw line.\nSaint Francis used an 8–0 run to close out its 62–61 win at Lehigh and give head coach Rob Krimmel his 150th career victory on November 29. Trailing, 61–54, with under two minutes remaining, the Red Flash defense forced two turnovers and three missed shots to shut out the Mountain Hawks the rest of the way. Saint Francis was also helped by two missed free throws by Lehigh. Cam Gregory was fouled in the act of shooting a three-pointer with 10.2 seconds remaining and hit all three free throws to erase Lehigh's two-point lead and provide the winning margin. The Red Flash were led by freshmen Aaron \"Ace\" Talbert (12 points in 32 minutes off the bench) and Aidan Harris, who secured 15 boards, including the rebound on Lehigh's attempted game-winner in the closing seconds.\nThat same evening, Central Connecticut registered the largest margin of victory by an NEC team in a road game in nearly two years, when they won, 79–51, at Army West Point. Kellen Amos led the Blue Devils with 17 points and added three blocked shots. Jordan Jones scored 15 points, shooting 7-for-13 from the floor, and added five rebounds and three steals for Central Connecticut.\nOn December 2, Fairleigh Dickinson, Saint Francis and Wagner all overcame double-digit deficits to record road victories. Joe Munden Jr. scored 19 points and had three steals to help Fairleigh Dickinson overcome NJIT's 12-point lead and earn a 71–68 victory. DeVante Jamison added 17 points on 7-for-13 shooting, and Jo'el Emanuel had 14 points and eight rebounds for the Knights.\nBobby Rosenberger III had 19 points and three steals to help Saint Francis erase a 20-point lead, which was still at 14 points with less than eight minutes to play, and defeat American, 75–73. Cam Gregory scored 14 points and added three steals for the Red Flash.\nWagner got 13 points each from Melvin Council Jr. and Javier Ezquerra and overcame a 16-point Stony Brook lead to earn a 60–59 victory. The Seahawks used a 10–0 run in the early stages of the second half to cut the Seawolves' lead to 43–42 and took their first lead of the game at 48–47, when Council scored with 8:55 to play. Stony Brook regained the lead at 59–58, but two free throws by Tyje Kelton with 1:19 remaining put Wagner back on top. Neither team scored the rest of the way.\nWagner made two defensive stands in the closing minute to secure a 62–59 victory at Coppin State on November 6. Leading by one point, the Seahawks forced the Eagles into an off-balance shot with 25 seconds remaining. A layup by Zaire Williams, who finished with a game-high 21 points, extended the Wagner lead to three with 12 seconds to play. Melvin Council Jr. (13 points) and Keyontae Lewis (11 points) then crowded Camaren Sparrow at the three-point line on Coppin State's final possession and forced an air ball.\nDeVante Jamison's driving layup with 1:16 to go gave Fairleigh Dickinson a 72–69 lead at Manhattan on November 8. The Knights hit their free throws down the stretch to secure a 76–71 victory in a game the Jaspers led by 12 points with 8:39 to play. Ansley Almonor led the Knights with 24 points and added eight rebounds. Jamison finished with 12 points, eight assists and three steals.\nLuke Sutherland scored an NEC season-high 35 points in the inaugural Battle of the Interstate at Binghamton, but it was not enough as Le Moyne fell, 91–79. Sutherland was 12-for-17 from the field, including 5-for-7 from beyond the arc, and hit all six of his free throws. His 35 points were the most by a Le Moyne player since the Dolphins' current head coach, Nate Champion, scored 35 in a November 2013 game that went to overtime. Sutherland also had three rebounds, three assists and two blocked shots. The Bearcats were presented a newly minted trophy to commemorate their victory in front of Binghamton's largest home crowd in nearly two years.\nLe Moyne hosted a Division I opponent for the first time since an 88–75 loss to Siena in 1991, and for the first time since becoming a Division I program on December 16, when they faced Dartmouth. With the Big Green leading, 8–7, the Dolphins went on a 15–6 run to open an eight-point lead with nine minutes to go in the first half. Kaiyem Cleary had the first eight of the 15 points, and Luke Sutherland scored the final seven during the run. A Trent Mosquera three-pointer stretched Le Moyne's lead to nine points at 32–23 with 4:15 left in the half. However, Dartmouth closed the half with a 13–4 run that tied the score at 36 at the break. The game remained tight in the opening stages of the second half, but the Dolphins closed the game with a 32–9 run over the final 13:12, which included a stretch of 15 straight points scored by Le Moyne. Sutherland had 11 of the 15 points, including three three-pointers and a layup. The Dolphins held the Big Green scoreless over the final 2:51 to secure an 80–54 victory, their first win over an Ivy League opponent. Sutherland finished the game with 24 points, while shooting 10-for-15 from the field and 4-for-8 from behind the arc, and added four rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block. Cleary contributed 19 points, shooting 4-for-6 from the floor and 3-for-4 from three-point range, while collecting six rebounds. Nate McClure had 12 rebounds for the Dolphins.\nLater that day, Central Connecticut snapped Division I's second longest home winning streak at 20 games, when they won, 57–54, at UMass Lowell. Following a timeout with 6.2 seconds remaining in a tie game, Joe Ostrowsky found Jordan Jones, who had been freed up by a Tre Breland III screen, in the corner, and Jones buried a three-pointer with three seconds to go to give the Blue Devils a 57–54 lead. The River Hawks' three-point attempt at the buzzer was unsuccessful. Jones shot 7-for-14 to earn a game-high 15 points and added five rebounds. Breland scored 11 points off the bench and shot 3-for-4 from three-point range.\nConference season notes.\nLIU, picked 7th in the pre-season coaches' poll and entering league play on a seven-game losing streak, shocked the NEC by winning their first two games of the conference season. On January 4, the Sharks dominated the first half against Wagner and had a 17-point lead at the break. LIU extended the bulge to 26 points with under 13 minutes to play, but the Seahawks suddenly responded with a 33–6 run over the next 10 minutes and took a 67–66 lead on Javier Ezquerra's jump shot with 2:16 remaining. Tai Strickland, who finished with 23 points and three steals, hit a three-pointer with 1:13 showing on the clock to put the Sharks back in front. Neither team was able to score the rest of the way, and LIU held on for a 69–67 home victory. Eric Acker had 14 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for the Sharks. Tahron Allen had 16 points for Wagner, while Melvin Council Jr. added 15 points, eight rebounds and five assists and Ezquerra had 13 points, nine assists and two steals.\nTwo days later, behind Eric Acker's 23 points and Tai Strickland's three key layups in heavy traffic in the closing three and one-half minutes, LIU earned a 73–68 win at Stonehill. Strickland finished with 20 points, five rebounds and three steals. Max Zegarowski had 18 points and two steals for the Skyhawks.\nMerrimack opened the conference slate with a pair of home victories over teams that are expected to contend. Jordan Derkack's 21 points, five rebounds, six assists and three steals led the Warriors to a 60–56 win over Fairleigh Dickinson on January 4. Merrimack's defense limited the Knights to 32.8% shooting and only three points in the closing 4:52. Ansley Almonor led the Knights with 17 points and nine rebounds, while Sean Moore added 14 points, 10 rebounds and two steals.\nMerrimack's defense was just as tight two days later, limiting Sacred Heart to 2-for-18 shooting from three-point range, while hitting 13 triples of their own on 52% shooting from beyond the arc and ran away with an 82–58 victory. Jordan Derkack had 27 points and seven rebounds, and Devon Savage added 18 points on six 3-pointers and four steals. Nico Galette had 22 points, eight rebounds and two steals for the Pioneers.\nCentral Connecticut opened their conference season on the road at Stonehill on January 4, with a 74–59 win. The Blue Devils used hot 53.6% shooting in the second half to outscore the Skyhawks, 44–30, and break open what was a close game at the break. Allan Jeanne-Rose led Central Connecticut with 22 points and added eight rebounds, while Kellen Amos contributed 20 points on 8-for-14 shooting and added three steals. Chas Stinson had 17 points, eight rebounds and two steals for Stonehill.\nLe Moyne played its inaugural NEC game on January 6, at Fairleigh Dickinson. Down by 10 points with less than 12 minutes to play, the Dolphins went on an 18–0 run, sparked by freshman AJ Dancler, who scored eight of his 10 bench points during the run. Kaiyem Cleary had 23 points and eight rebounds for Le Moyne. Sean Moore led the Knights with 20 points and 12 rebounds.\nCentral Connecticut emerged from its January 15 showdown with Merrimack as the only NEC team unbeaten in league play by earning a 75–70 home victory over the Warriors. The Blue Devils closed the first half strong and held an eight-point lead at the break. Central Connecticut extended the lead to 18 points with just over 10 minutes to play, when Merrimack embarked on a 15–3 run that cut the lead to six. Two key baskets by Kellen Amos, who finished with 12 points, in the later stages of the second half kept the Blue Devils afloat. However, Jordan Derkack, who finished with 16 points, scored seven straight points for the Warriors. After Merrimack's full-court press forced a turnover that led to a layup by Adam \"Budd\" Clark, the lead was only three points with 18 seconds to go. Allan Jeanne-Rose, who had a game-high 24 points and pulled down eight rebounds for the Blue Devils, sank four free throws in the closing seconds to secure the victory for Central Connecticut. Jayden Brown contributed 15 points for the Blue Devils. Adam Clark added 15 points and eight assists for Merrimack.\nThe name of Fairleigh Dickinson's home arena, originally called the Rothman Center, was changed on January 18, 2024, to the Bogota Savings Bank Center.\nCentral Connecticut put their undefeated conference record on the line, when they entertained Le Moyne on January 19. The Dolphins made their intentions clear right from the start: They were going to shoot three-pointers, and they scored all their points in building an early 12–5 lead on four triples. The Blue Devils battled back after the slow start and took their first lead, 34–33, 13 seconds before halftime. Kaiyem Cleary's free throws with half a second to play gave Le Moyne a 35–34 lead at the break. The Dolphins went on a 13–4 run, sparked by Nate McClures's six points during the spurt, to build a 53–43 lead with 14:04 to play. Facing a 10-point deficit, Jordan Jones scored six points within three and a half minutes to lead a 10–0 Central Connecticut run to tie the game at 58 with less than eight minutes remaining. With the Blue Devils holding a 69–67 lead, Darrick Jones Jr. and Mike DePersia hit back-to-back three-pointers to put Le Moyne ahead 73–69 with 1:52 on the clock. Jordan Jones hit a three-pointer to tie the game at 73 with 54 seconds remaining. After an empty possession for Le Moyne, Central Connecticut called timeout with 23 seconds left. Jordan Jones's layup attempt was off the mark and rebounded by Le Moyne's Nate Fouts, who threw an outlet pass to DePersia. DePersia's bounce pass to a cutting McClure led to a go-ahead layup with 1.2 seconds to go. The Blue Devils' inbounds pass was intercepted by Cleary, giving the Dolphins a 75–73 victory. McClure finished the game with 13 points, shooting 5 for 9. Jordan Jones led the Blue Devils with 22 points and added seven rebounds and four assists. The Dolphins' defense held Allan Jeanne-Rose, who entered the game as the leading scorer in NEC play, to just seven points. Cleary was Le Moyne's leading scorer with 19 points, and he added eight rebounds, three assists, four blocks and three steals.\nCentral Connecticut's loss opened the door for either Merrimack to take sole possession of first place or Wagner to move into a first-place tie. The Seahawks used a 15–4 run over the first five minutes of the second half to take the lead for good on their way to a 71–64 victory, ending the Warriors' 13-game home winning streak. Wagner was led by Melvin Council Jr., who had 15 points and 13 rebounds, freshman Seck Zongo, who had a career-high 15 points on 5-for-7 shooting while adding seven rebounds, and Javier Ezquerra, who had eight points, seven assists and no turnovers. Jacob O’Connell had 26 points and four blocks for Merrimack.\nSacred Heart defended their home court, earning a 66–61 victory over Wagner on January 21, to retain a share of first place. Joey Reilly scored 21 points and three steals for the Pioneers. Melvin Council Jr. led the Seahawks with 14 points and added six assists and two steals.\nCentral Connecticut bounced back from their loss to Le Moyne with a 72–63 road win at LIU to remain in a first-place tie. Allan Jeanne-Rose got back on track, scoring 19 points on 7-for-12 shooting from the floor for the Blue Devils. Tana Kopa had 24 points, three steals and three blocked shots for the Sharks.\nIn a January 25 game nationally televised on ESPNU, first-place Central Connecticut got 19 points and seven assists from Jordan Jones and a double-double from Kellen Amos, who had 16 points on 7-for-12 shooting and 10 rebounds, to earn a 76–60 road victory against Fairleigh Dickinson. The Blue Devils improved to 4–0 in NEC road games this season. Sean Moore had 16 points and eight rebounds, and Ansley Almonor added 16 points and four assists for the Knights.\nLater that evening, Sacred Heart fell out of a tie for first place, losing, 75–71, at Saint Francis. The Red Flash started five freshmen for the first time in program history and became the first Division I team to do so this season. Two of those freshmen, Eli Wilborn and Aaron \"Ace\" Talbert, made key layups in the final three minutes to aid the Saint Francis cause. The Red Flash were led by sophomore Miles Webb, who came off the bench to score 19 points and add seven rebounds and three blocked shots. Nico Galette had a double-double in the losing cause for the Pioneers with 15 points, 13 rebounds and two steals. Alex Sobel was Sacred Heart's high scorer with 17 points, and he added six rebounds, four steals and three blocked shots.\nCentral Connecticut overcame a nine-point deficit with four minutes to play to earn a 69–68 overtime victory against Wagner on January 27, to remain in the top spot in the NEC standings. Two Blue Devils free throws by Jordan Jones, who had 16 points and five assists, with 12 seconds to play tied the game and sent it to the extra session. Kellen Amos hit a three-pointer to put the Blue Devils ahead, 69–68, with 51 seconds left in overtime, and the Seahawks were unable to score the rest of the way. Amos finished the game with 17 points and five rebounds. Javier Ezquerra had a game-high 22 points for Wagner, which also got a double-double from Keyontae Lewis, who had 13 points and 11 rebounds.\nKaiyem Cleary scored 43 points on January 27, to break Le Moyne's single-game individual scoring record, first set on January 7, 1955, and the Dolphins cruised to an 87–74 victory over LIU. Cleary's 43 points were the most scored by a player in regulation and the third most scored by a player in a single game in Division I this season. Cleary was 14 for 25 from the floor, including 6 for 10 from beyond the arc, and shot 9 for 9 from the free-throw line. He also led Le Moyne in rebounds with seven and had a pair of blocked shots. Despite shooting 0 for 6 from three-point range, Luke Sutherland scored 16 points and added five rebounds for the Dolphins. Cleary's attention-grabbing point total outshined the performance of Tai Strickland, who had a big follow-up game after his buzzer beater two nights earlier gave the Sharks a 63–60 win over Stonehill. Strickland finished the game with 34 points, seven rebounds and three assists in a losing cause.\nAfter Central Connecticut delighted their home crowd by building a 14-point lead in the first half, the Blue Devils survived a furious comeback by Saint Francis on February 1, to extend their lead in the NEC standings to a full game. The Red Flash took a 60–59 lead on a pair of Wisler Sanon II free throws with 3:10 to play. Allan Jeanne-Rose, who scored Central Connecticut's final six points of the game, put the next three points on the board to give the Blue Devils a 62–60 lead with 2:58 on the clock. A Bobby Rosenberger layup 21 seconds later tied the game at 62. Jeanne-Rose connected on the second of two free throws to give Central Connecticut the lead with 2:22 remaining. Each team followed with three empty possessions, until Miles Webb grabbed a rebound of a missed Blue Devils shot with seven seconds to go, but the Red Flash turned the ball over, and Central Connecticut held on for a 63–62 victory. Kellen Amos led the Blue Devils with 13 points and added seven rebounds. Jeanne-Rose had 12 points and five rebounds. Carlos Lopez Jr. had a game-high 22 points for the Red Flash. Sanon had 13 points and seven rebounds.\nIn a February 3 matchup of the NEC's top two teams, Merrimack got 22 points and six assists from Jordan Derkack and moved into a first-place tie with Central Connecticut, beating the Blue Devils, 71–68 in North Andover. The win gave the Warriors a split of the season series with the Blue Devils, with each team winning at home. Merrimack built a 14-point lead and were up by 10 points with less than four minutes to play, but six straight points by Allan Jeanne-Rose cut the lead to 70–66 with 39 seconds remaining. A Kellen Amos steal led to Jordan Jones making a trip to the free-throw line, where he sank both shots to trim the lead to 70–68 with 26.9 seconds on the clock. Tre Breland then came up with another steal for the Blue Devils. After a timeout, Jeanne-Rose drove the lane, but his layup was blocked by Jacob O’Connell. Adam \"Budd\" Clark hit one of two free throws to extend the Warriors' lead to 71–68 with eight seconds to play. Jones put up a three-point attempt at the buzzer, but it was short, and Merrimack held on. Jeanne-Rose finished with a game-high 23 points and added six rebounds and two blocked shots. Tre Breland III had 14 points, nine rebounds and two steals for Central Connecticut. Jones scored 11 points and had seven assists and four steals. Devon Savage had 15 points for Merrimack.\nCentral Connecticut got a gorilla off their back on February 8, earning a home win over Sacred Heart, 77–70, and ending their 15-game losing streak against their in-state rivals.

Once the contest was underway, it featured 25 lead changes and 21 ties. Fairleigh Dickinson had a lead in the final minute until Tana Kopa's basket with 33 seconds to play tied the game at 79 and sent it to overtime.

        "text": "The 1888 Women's tennis season was a tennis circuit composed of 65 national, regional, county, and regular tournaments. It was the 13th annual season since the first women's tennis tournaments were held in 1876. The season began in February in Auckland, New Zealand, and ended in December in Napier, New Zealand.\nSummary of season.\nFrom 1888 until 1912 Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), grew in status and influence to become the de facto international tennis governing body before the proper International Lawn Tennis Federation commenced operations. Despite the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) forming in 1881 a good seven years before the LTA, it was the British body that set laws, settled disputes and organized the increasingly complicated tournament calendar before the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) formed in March, 1913.\nAfter the formation of the ILTF the world tennis circuit going forward was a highly organised and structured network of national and international tournaments. Most tennis tournaments were usually mixed events for men and women, and the women's international tennis circuit certainly up to 1923 was composed mainly of tournaments on the British and European Circuits. After the USNLTA joined the ILTF this would later change with more and more tournaments being staged globally. Women tennis players on the world circuit up to the open era were funded by their national associations enabling them to travel and take part in international tournaments.\n1888 sees a decrease in the number women's singles events on the previous year being held as the tennis circuit continues to form. The 1888 women's tennis season began on 27 February with the|Auckland Association Championships in Auckland, New Zealand. In May 1888 at the first major event of the year the Irish Championships played at the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club in Dublin, Ireland. England's Blanche Hillyard wins the singles title for the first time compatriot Bertha Steedman two sets to love. The ladies doubles event is won by English sister's Bertha Steedman and Mary Steedman, and in the mixed doubles Margaret Bracewell partnering Ernest Wool Lewis defeat the English/Irish pairing of Bertha Steedman and Hugh Cairns. In June 1888 sees a change in scheduling when the U.S. National Championships held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club, PA are brought forward this month, Bertha Townsend sweeps away title holder Ellen Hansell in straight sets.\nLater at the end of June the third major tournament of the year the Northern Championships is played at the Liverpool Cricket Club in Liverpool sees Lottie Dod retain her title beating Irish Champion Blanche Hillyard in straights sets, the women's doubles event is won by the sister's Ann Dod and Lottie Dod who defeat the English/Irish pairing of Margaret Bracewell and May Langrishe in the final. The All England mixed doubles event is won by Blanche Hillyard and Ernest Renshaw defeating Lottie Dod and John Charles Kay on their way to the title. In June Ireland's Connie Butler wins the Scottish Championships in Edinburgh against England's Ann Dod, and at the Welsh Championships in Penarth Blanche Hillyard takes the title against Miss N Pope.\nIn July at the 1888 Wimbledon Championships the world's first major tennis tournament, Lottie Dod successfully defends last years title, when she defeats Blanche Hillyard in straight sets to claim her second major title of the season. The season ended on 30 December 1888 at the New Zealand Championships, held in Napier, New Zealand played on grass.\nSeason results.\nPrior to the creation of the International Lawn Tennis Federation and the establishment of its world championship events in 1913 the Wimbledon Championships, the U.S. National Championships, the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships and the Northern Championships were considered by players and historians as the four most important tennis tournaments to win.\nThis is a calendar of all known official events that were administered by national, regional, provincial, state, and county lawn tennis associations in the year 1888, with player progression documented from the quarterfinals stage where historical sources have permitted.\nKey\nJanuary.\n\"No events\"\nFebruary.\n\"No events\"\nTournament winners (singles).\nThis is a list of winners by the total number of singles titles won for 1888 major titles in bold:"

Their bids' aim is to use innovation and modern-day technologies to help Handball have a bright future.\nThe Swedish Handball Federation president, Frederik Rapp, stated “the commitment to finding sustainable solutions across all industries and areas of life is very clear in all of Scandinavia. To connect the Scandinavian approach and experience in sustainability with European handball is so valuable. Finding more sustainable solutions for future events could be a real game-changer for the future of our sport”.\nWhile the Danish counterpart, Per Bertelsen said “We believe we can build on the positive momentum we see in our sport. Together, we can deliver a world-class event that will be a true celebration for European handball”.\nThe main round would be held in Oslo or Trondheim in Norway and either Copenhagen or Herning in Denmark. The final weekend would be in the Telenor Arena in Oslo, marking the first time Norway has hosted the final of the EHF Women's Euro (they were going to host the final in 2020, but withdrew altogether due to Covid-19).

The institution was enlarged gradually over the years, until 1930, when it became a local-authority-run Public Assistance Institution for caring for the elderly, infirm and chronically sick. During the Second World War it was used as a hospital under the Emergency Hospital Service. From 1948 the site was taken over by the newly-established National Health Service (NHS) and named St Luke's Hospital.\nSt Luke's primarily functioned as an infirmary, though a nurses' training school opened there in 1951, and child development services were moved there in 1982. In the early 1990s the decision was taken to close St Luke's and move its services to nearby St Cross Hospital, which was enlarged at the same time. By April 1993 all of the patients had been transferred, and St Luke's was closed.\nIn 1994 the site was sold to housing developers, who demolished most of the buildings for a new housing development called Morton Gardens. Only the former workhouse boardroom remains. The site of the hospital is now covered by housing, a general practice surgery, and an NHS clinic called the Orchard Centre."

The Irina Viner-Usmanova Gymnastics Palace in Moscow was the only arena that did not meet the EHF's requirements and thus was axed.\nThese were the proposed venues in Russia's bid:\nVenue which was originally included, but taken out:\nDenmark, Norway and Sweden.\nHaving first stating an interest as two separate bids (Denmark and Norway and a Swedish solo bid) the Scandinavians decided to all bid for an EHF Euro together for the first time ever for EHF Euro, under the slogan Scandinavia Connect. Their bids' aim is to use innovation and modern-day technologies to help Handball have a bright future.\nThe Swedish Handball Federation president, Frederik Rapp, stated “the commitment to finding sustainable solutions across all industries and areas of life is very clear in all of Scandinavia. To connect the Scandinavian approach and experience in sustainability with European handball is so valuable. Finding more sustainable solutions for future events could be a real game-changer for the future of our sport”.\nWhile the Danish counterpart, Per Bertelsen said “We believe we can build on the positive momentum we see in our sport. Together, we can deliver a world-class event that will be a true celebration for European handball”.\nThe main round would be held in Oslo or Trondheim in Norway and either Copenhagen or Herning in Denmark. The final weekend would be in the Telenor Arena in Oslo, marking the first time Norway has hosted the final of the EHF Women's Euro (they were going to host the final in 2020, but withdrew altogether due to Covid-19). Every other venue would host preliminary round matches.\nHowever, they withdrew their 2026 bid to focus on their 2028 application, and ended up winning the hosting rights for 2028 unopposed.\nThese are the following 9 venues included in the Scandinavian bid:\nDenmark\nNorway\nSweden\nVenue that was deemed not suitable for tournament and is no longer part of the bid:\nHost selection.\nAs only the Russian bid remained it was unanimously selected at the 14th EHF Extraordinary Congress on 20 November 2021. Sergey Shishkarev called the awarding of the hosting rights as a historic moment.\nWithdrawal.\nAfter the war in Ukraine started, the EHF said they would monitor the situation. But on 4 July 2023, the championships were taken away from Russia. After the statement, Shishkarev said they would pursue future IHF World Women's Handball Championships and EHF Euros.\nSecond bidding process.\nAfter it was decided that Russia would not host the event, the EHF reopened the bidding process.\nNew bidding timeline.\nThe new timeline is:\nOn 25 August 2023, the EHF announced the new bids.\nOn 25 October, the EHF announced the official bids. Spain withdrew their application, while Slovakia joined Romania's bid.\nCzech Republic and Poland.\nCzech Republic and Poland confirmed a joint letter of interest to bid. Speaking after this announcement, Czech Handball president, Ondřej Zdráhala, noted that Poland was a experienced and reliable partner and also said that Spain is their biggest rival in the bidding process. Czech Republic and Poland submitted an official joint bid for the event with the slogan Follow the way. Polish federation president, Henryk Szczepański, saying:\nWhile the Czech counterpart, Ondřej Zdráhala, said:\nIn regards to venues, Ondřej Zdráhala had originally stated that the idea was to have Katowice, Ostrava and Wrocław as host cities. However, when the EHF announced the official bids, the venues changed to Brno, Lubin and Katowice. The preliminary round would be held Brno, Lubin and Katowice, the main round in Brno and Katowice, and the final weekend in Katowice.\nThese are the proposed venues for the bid:\nCzech Republic\nPoland\nRomania and Slovakia.\nAfter starting off as a solo bid, Romania teamed up with Slovakia for a joint bid. Prior, it was rumoured that Romania would be given the hosting rights automatically, although this never materialised. The final weekend would be in Cluj-Napoca.\nHowever, shortly after they announced proposed facilities, the EHF told Romania that the arenas in Pitești and Bistrita were too small and did not meet the requirements. While at the same time, the EHF reacted favourably to adding the Oradea Arena in Oradea instead. \nAnother issue aroused when the arena in Bucharest was considered too old and did not meet requirements.\nThese are the proposed venues:\nRomania\nSlovakia\nVenues that were axed, having originally been included:\nTurkey.\nTurkey filed an application for the first time since 2016. The final weekend would take place in the Sinan Erdem Dome in Istanbul.\nThese are the venues for the Turkish bid:\nHost selection.\nOriginal host announcement.\nThe hosts were originally going to be announced on 28 January 2024 in Cologne, but the EHF decided to delay the announcement to April while also inviting every bidding nation to a meeting in mid-February. \nPotential alternative hosting plan.\nDuring the meeting in mid-February, Romanian media reported that a possible five-country co-hosting plan was being negotiated by all five bidding countries and the EHF after it was reported that none of the three bids fulfilled all the requirements. The reported plan entails that each nation would host one preliminary round group, with the exception of Romania who would host two, the main round would be held in Poland and Romania, while the Poles are considered the favourites to host the final weekend as they have the biggest arena.\nHost announcement.\nOn 8 March 2024, the EHF announced all five countries, Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Turkey, as co-hosts. This marks the second time a sports tournament has been held in more than four countries, after UEFA Euro 2020."

        "text": "The 1889 Women's tennis season was a tennis circuit composed of 63 national, regional, county, and regular tournaments. The season began in January in Madras, India, and ended in December in Dunedin, New Zealand.\nSummary of season.\nFrom 1888 until 1912 Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), grew in status and influence to become the de facto international tennis governing body before the proper International Lawn Tennis Federation commenced operations. Despite the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) forming in 1881 a good seven years before the LTA, it was the British body that set laws, settled disputes and organized the increasingly complicated tournament calendar before the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) formed in March, 1913.\nAfter the formation of the ILTF the world tennis circuit going forward was a highly organised and structured network of national and international tournaments. Most tennis tournaments were usually mixed events for men and women, and the women's international tennis circuit certainly up to 1923 was composed mainly of tournaments on the British and European Circuits. After the USNLTA joined the ILTF this would later change with more and more tournaments being staged globally. Women tennis players on the world circuit up to the open era were funded by their national associations enabling them to travel and take part in international tournaments.\n1889 sees a slight decrease in the number women's singles events being held as the tennis circuit continues to form. The 1889 women's tennis season began on 8 January with the first Southern India Championships staged at Madras, India. In May 1889 at the first major event of the year the Irish Championships played at the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club in Dublin, Ireland. Ireland's Louisa Martin wins the singles title beating defending champion Blanche Hillyard, she also picks up the ladies doubles event is won patnered with Florence Stanuell. In the mixed doubles Lena Rice and Willoughby Hamilton defeat Blanche Hillyard and Harold Stone. In terms of draw size the South of England Championships was the largest tournament of the year with a draw of 30 across two events.\nIn mid June 1889 the change in scheduling is continued when the U.S. National Championships are held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club, PA, Bertha Townsend successfully defends her title in the challenge round by defeating Lida Voorhees in straight sets.\nLater the same month at the third major tournament of the year the Northern Championships played at the Northern Lawn Tennis Club in Manchester, England Lottie Dod successfully defends her title beating Blanche Hillyard in three sets, in the women's doubles final sisters Bertha Steedman and Mary Steedman defeat another sister pairing Ann and Lottie Dod in straight sets, and the All England Mixed Doubles Championship event, is won by Lottie Dod and John Charles Kay who defeat Blanche Hillyard and Ernest Renshaw in the final.\nIn July at the fourth and final major event of the season the 1889 Wimbledon Championships the world's first major tennis tournament, Blanche Bingley takes the title, when she defeats upcoming Irish player Lena Rice in three very close sets to win her third major title. The season ended on 30 December 1889 at the New Zealand Championships, held in Dunedin, New Zealand that was played on grass.\nSeason results.\nPrior to the creation of the International Lawn Tennis Federation and the establishment of its world championship events in 1913 the Wimbledon Championships, the U.S. National Championships, the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships and the Northern Championships were considered by players and historians as the four most important tennis tournaments to win, and together effectively making an early incarnation of the Grand Slam events we know today.\nKey\nTournament winners (singles).\nThis is a list of winners by the total number of singles titles won for 1889 major titles in bold:"

        "title": "Dutch Masters of Motocross",
        "text": "The Dutch Masters of Motocross (DMoMX) is the premier domestic Dutch Motocross series, sanctioned by the Koninklijke Nederlandse Motorrijders Vereniging.\nThe series runs annually throughout spring each year and typically consists of 3-4 rounds. The premier classes are the 500cc and 250cc but there are also classes for younger riders on 125cc and 85cc motorcycles.\nUp to the end of the 2015 season, the series was known as the Open Dutch Motocross Championship (ONK). The series was renamed in 2016 in a bid by the KNMV to increase the international status of the championship and attract more riders from the FIM Motocross World Championship. The ONK championship resumed in 2017 separately to the Dutch Masters of Motocross, with the series catering for national-level riders predominantly.\nHistory.\nUnder the original guise of the Open Dutch Motocross Championship, the first national motocross championship took place in 1949, running annually up until the end of the 2015 season. After a fall in the interest of international riders in competing in the series over the previous seasons, the national federation (KNMV) took the decision reconstruct the series from the 2016 season onwards.\nThis resulted in the renaming of the championship to the Dutch Masters of Motocross and the changing of the championship classes to the following:\nIn its opening season, the championship consisted of five events but in recent years it has had three events. Jeffrey Herlings has been the most successful rider since the re-structuring of the championship in 2016, picking up five titles.\nEvent Format.\nRounds of the Dutch Masters of Motocross typically have a single day format. Each class has a combined free and timed practice session in the morning, with the times from the timed practice session acting as the qualifying positions for the main races. Following on from this, all four classes have two races each, with the overall winner being the rider with the highest aggregate score from those races. The senior classes (500cc &amp; 250cc) have 25 minute plus one lap races whilst the junior classes (125cc &amp; 85cc) have 20 minute plus one lap races.\nPoints are awarded to finishers of the main races, in the following format:"

        "title": "1935 French Rugby League Cup final",
        "text": "The 1935 French Rugby League Cup final was the inaugural final of the French Rugby League Cup (French: \"Coupe de France de Rugby à XIII\"), the country's original and premier knockout competition for the sport of rugby league football. It took place on 5 May 1935, at Stade Jacques-Thomas in Toulouse.\nPre-game.\nVenue selection.\nEarly into the season, newspaper \"Paris-soir\" relayed information from French league secretary Maurice Blein, suggesting that the final of the 1934-35 French Rugby League Cup could be hosted in Paris. By early 1935, it was widely being reported that the final would be taking place in Toulouse, a crucial market for French rugby, whose control could reshape the balance of power between the two codes. and sports daily \"L'Auto\" posited that it would \"likely not take place in Paris\". After Lyon-Villeurbanne qualified for the final, its president Joseph Pansera claimed that his stadium offered better amenities and revenue prospects than Stade Jacques-Thomas, the only league-friendly venue in Toulouse, and that XIII Catalan had agreed to play in Villeurbanne. Again, Paris-soir called the Villeurbanne move a done deal. But other papers printed a rebuke by the league, saying that neither Paris nor Villeurbanne had ever had been under serious consideration, and that only Bordeaux—where earlier games had drawn large crowds—would be considered as a possible alternative to Toulouse.\nFollowing much speculation, the league upheld its decision, and on 30 April ordered both teams to play in Toulouse.\nPossible date change.\nIn April, the French league was called upon by the RFL to send the French national team to Leeds on 6 May for a game against an England and Wales select squad, organized in honor of King George V's Silver Jubilee. It was initially announced that the French Cup final would be moved one week earlier, on 28 April, to present the best possible roster for the event. but this was quickly rescinded. Galia expressed interest in postponing the final, but this did not come to pass either, possibly to avoid going head-to-head with the final of the French Rugby Union Championship, which was played at Toulouse's Stade des Ponts Jumeaux the following weekend. The Cup final kept its original 5 May date and the Team France traveled without players from the two finalist clubs. Both teams arrived in Toulouse by train in the evening of the day before the final.\nWeather disruption.\nOn the eve of the game, the roof protecting the main stands was torn off by wind bursts, and torrential rains poured over the city for a large part of game day, offering less than enticing conditions to prospective attendees. Tickets cost between 5 and 15 francs apiece, but some who had booked at the higher price to be seated under a roof filed complaints when they found it gone. Members of the press were also left to work under the rain.\nCurtain raiser.\nAt 13:15, Stade Jacques-Thomas' resident organization Gallia Club de Toulouse (not relation with Jean Galia), recent converts to rugby league who were not participating in the championship, played an exhibition against a team from Espéraza as a curtain raiser to the final. The Espéraza squad featured several defectors from the nearby US Quillan union club that had been at the center of a shamateurism controversy a few years earlier, and of which several French league pioneers were alumni. Gallia Club won by a score of 35–0.\nGame summary.\nLike the semifinal played on the same ground, the final was refereed by retired union international Albert Dupouy of Bordeaux, although his officiating was looser in the climactic game. Despite not being announced on the pre-game roster, René Barnoud was inserted in the middle of Lyon's threequarter line, while Lucien Lafond, who was previously assigned to the position, was moved to the forward lines.\nThe game started at a breakneck pace. XIII Catalan put on 7 points in the opening eight minutes. They notched a penalty kick by François Noguères right at the start of the game, followed by a try from Jean Azais. The conversion attempt failed, and they narrowly missed on a second try by Aimé Barde, but Noguères kicked a 35-metre drop from a narrow angle soon after. That would be all the offensive success they would get for the entire game. Lyon opened their scoring 17 minutes in via a Robert Samatan try, which was converted, followed by a drop kick from Henri Marty at the 25th minute, which brought the score to a 7–7 tie. The rest of the first period and the initial part of the second saw Lyon assert their dominance, with sporadic counterattacks by the Catalans. However, they had to wait until the 60th minute to break through. Barbazanges started an offensive rush at the 50 metre line, then passed to Laurent Lambert for slick corner try, which was converted. In the final eight minutes, Lyon provided another offensive flourish with tries by Amila and Barnoud, both converted, sealing the score at a hefty 22–7.\nOutside of Perpignan's early push, pre-game favorites Lyon dominated the action. Despite being overmatched, the Catalans' forward pack earned praised for its tenacity, especially Gilbert Ponramon. But its offense was no match for Lyon's, especially their most talented player Robert Samatan, who found vindication on Toulouse soil, a few years after his falling out with rugby union's Stade Toulousain, where he had been forbidden from playing at his preferred position. The play was quite rough in the second half, with XIII Catalan suffering the brunt of it, successively losing top offensive contributor François Noguères, Roger Ramis and Aimé Barde for significant chunks of the game. Lyon's Lucien Lafond was expelled for his hit on Barde. The game received moderately positive reviews, largely due to Lyon's quality roster, but the standard of play was somewhat compromised by the heavy rain.\nUS Lyon-Villeurbanne.\nFullback: Henri Marty&lt;br&gt;\nThreequarters: René Barnoud, Antonin Barbazanges, Gaston Amila, Laurent Lambert&lt;br&gt;\nHalfbacks: Robert Samatan (fly-half), Charles Mathon (scrum-half)&lt;br&gt;\nForwards: Gustave Genevet (lock), Joseph Griffard, Joseph Perrin (second row), ? Barcella or Lucien Lafond, Auguste Anclades or Lucien Lafond, Paul Piany or Lucien Lafond (front row)\nXIII Catalan.\nFullback: Jean Cassagneau&lt;br&gt;\nThreequarters: Aimé Barde, François Noguères, Roger Ramis, Jean Azaïs&lt;br&gt;\nHalfbacks: Serre Martin (fly-half), Philippe Ascola (scrum-half)&lt;br&gt;\nForwards: Gilbert Ponramon (lock), André Bruzy, Octave Triquera (second row), Georges Fontvieille, François Forma, Louis Sayrou (front row)\nGame against Challenge Cup winners.\nThanks to cooperation between the French and English leagues, both French Cup and English Challenge Cup finals took place on the same weekend and, to support the new French tournament, it was decided that the Challenge Cup winners would travel to metro Paris the following weekend to face their gallic counterparts in a special unification game. The RFL representative, Castleford, narrowly beat Lyon-Villeurbanne by a score of 24–21. It is prior to that game, rather than directly after the Coupe de France final, that RFL representatives handed over to the French the trophy that would become the emblem of their main knockout competition, the Lord Derby Cup."

The lack of ice hockey teams and players in the state is a direct result of three unavoidable factors: First, Hawaii is the most southerly state in the U.S. with only outlying territories such as Puerto Rico being closer to the equator. This means that any and all ice surfaces would have to be enclosed and artificial. Second, Hawaii is the fourth smallest state, but with much of its land mass consumed by mountains, volcanoes and beaches, there is very little space to build an ice rink. Third, and perhaps most importantly, Hawaii is so far away from continental US that it is impractical for other teams to travel to the islands.\nTeams.\nAs of 2023, no attempts have yet been made to establish an ice hockey team on the Hawaiian islands.\nPlayers.\nHawaii has the lowest engagement rate with ice hockey in the United States. Hawaii had just 279 residents registered with USA Hockey in 2022, accounting for approximately 0.002% of its population."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Utah",
        "text": "Utah has a growing interest with ice hockey in the United States.\nHistory.\nUtah had its first big introduction to the game with the debut of the Salt Lake Golden Eagles in 1969. The club was a member of the WHL and got off to a slow start by finishing last in the standings in this first two seasons. 1972 saw huge changes for the team as it suddenly became competitive, reaching the league championship, but it was also the beginning of the end for the league. The early 1970s saw massive amounts of westward expansion by both the NHL and WHA that caused many teams in the WHL to fold. 1974 was the final year of operation for the WHL, however, Salt Lake was one of the teams that was still round to be absorbed by the Central Hockey League. The Eagles responded to the adversity by winning the league championship in their first season. They continued to be one of the top teams in the CHL and won two more titles in the early 80s. \nBy 1984 the CHL had declined to the point of bankruptcy but the Eagles still remained popular in their home town. Despite losing the backing of their then-parent club (Minnesota North Stars), the team jumped to the International Hockey League in 1984. The new league was a step up in terms of competition, with the IHL playing just below the NHL, but the Eagles were quick on the uptake. After winning the league championship in 1987, the Eagles signed an affiliation deal with the Calgary Flames and repeated their title run the following season. In the ensuing years, however, the team began to flag in the standings and became a middling team by the mid 90s. In 1994 Larry H. Miller, who had purchased the team in 1989, sold the Eagles to a group out of Detroit. Despite the loyal and established fanbase, the franchise was moved out of Utah before the next season.\nAfter a year without a team, Salt Lake City welcomed its second franchise when the Utah Grizzlies arrived from Denver. The team had already won a league championship before their arrival but recommended itself the old Eagles fans by capturing the title in 1996. While the Grizzlies remained one of the better teams in the IHL for the remainder of the decade, they were unable to get any further successes in the playoffs. Despite the lack of postseason performance, attendance figured remained high with the team routinely seeing crowds above 7,000. After the IHL folded in 2001, the Grizzlies were absorbed by the AHL, previously the IHL's chief rival. The team saw even less on-ice success in the early 21st century and by the middle of the first decade their fans were beginning to disappear. In 2005 the team saw its average crow size drop below 5,000 for the first time and then suspended operations after the season.\nNot willing to miss out on a ready market, a local group purchased the right to the Grizzlies name as well as a mothballed ECHL franchise and made sure that the E Center had ice hockey available for the 2005–06 season. Though they started slow, the second franchise played very consistently over the years, making the postseason for eleven consecutive years. While the team was unable to win a title in that time, the fanbase rewarded the team by seeing its attendance numbers rise from 3,800 in 2006 to over 5,600 in 2018.\nDuring the residency of the second Grizzlies franchise, junior hockey arrived in Utah when the Ogden Mustangs relocated from California. While it wasn't the first junior team to call the state home, it was the first to last more than one season. The Mustangs swiftly became one of the best teams in the Western States Hockey League, finishing either second or first in their division for 7 consecutive years. In 2019 and 2020, Ogden won the league regular season title, capping off back-to-back runs to the league championship game. After the WSHL went dormant during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Mustangs left to join the USPHL and have continued their strong play (as of 2023).\nOn April 18, 2024, the NHL announced that it would relocate the Arizona Coyotes to Salt Lake City following the sale of the team to Utah Jazz owner and Real Salt Lake co-owner Ryan Smith. The relocation is not a traditional situation, as the Coyotes franchise was deactivated for the next five seasons while they try and secure a new arena, while Utah is considered an expansion team in a similar situation to the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens of the NFL.\nPlayers.\nThe long-time presence of professional ice hockey in Salt Lake City has helped the region build the local ice hockey community and resulted in several players of note from the state. However, the rest of the state remains largely unaffected by the game. This has resulted in Utah having a lower level of engagement (0.114% of its population is registered with USA Hockey) than most of its mountain-west neighbors."

        "text": "The 1925–26 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey season was the 6th season of play for the program. The Terriers were coached by Chippy Gaw in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nBU entered the season looking to sustain the level of play from the previous year. IN the first game, the Terriers looked like a well-oiled machine with many returning players leading the effort. Don Martin was stellar in goal while Lawless, Scott and Gregoire routinely breaking through the MIT defense. Even the alternates got into the action with Kontoff ending the night's scoring. Coach Gaw then had two weeks to get the team into shape for their match with Harvard. Martin ended up having the best performance of his career, pitching a shutout against the vaunted crimson and giving BU its first ever win against the cross-town rivals.\nJust before new year's, Boston University played host to one of Canada's top college teams but the Terriers weren't as ready for Toronto as they had been for Harvard. The Varsity Blues piled 8 goals into the BU cage and didn't surrender a one. After the embarrassing defeat, the team played in a fugue over their next two games. In the rematch with MIT the team slept-walked through the first two periods and only woke up when they found themselves down by a pair in the third. Scott managed to cut into the Engineers lead but there wasn't enough time to mount a proper comeback. The team looked better in their next match but they weren't able to distance themselves from Williams at any point in the match. Ling and Scott combined to give the team a lead in the second but it didn't last and BU went without a goal in the entire second half of the game.\nAfter the failures on offense, coach Gaw changed his lineup by dropping Gregoire back to defense, moving team captain Ling up to left wing and starting Kontoff at right wing. The new-look Terriers responded with a dominant game over Bowdoin including a hat-trick from Gregoire. Martin split the shutout with his understudy, Silverberg. The following day the team took a trip to Buffalo to face the Nichols Club, a semi-pro outfit. After dropping the match they stopped off in Ithaca on their way home for a match with Cornell. Though they won the game, Gregoire netted the only goal of the match and all of the offensive lessons from the Bowdoin match seemed to have been forgotten. The final game before the exam break saw the Terriers make their debut on Broadway when they appeared at the newly opened Madison Square Garden. Their anemic offense didn't serve the Terriers well and the team fell to the St. Nicholas Hockey Club in a lopsided match.\nWith the offense no longer working, the team shifted its attentions to the defensive side of the puck and looked far better in their game with Boston College. From the start of the match the Terriers hit the Eagles hard and often. With the two playing for a trophy donated by Harvard's legendary coach, Alfred Winsor, the match was close throughout. Gregoire got the opening goal on a lucky bounce when he fired the puck from 3/4 the length of the ice. BC's goaltender was unable to keep sight of the puck and only knew it was coming towards him when it hit near his feet and bounded into the goal. Silverberg, who was starting in goal, played a terrific game by stopping many good chances from the Eagles but he couldn't save everything and BC tied the game at the end of the second. By the third period both teams were visibly tired from the rough match and a quick shot out of a scramble in front of the net found its way into the BU cage. A few nights later the team travelled to West Point to shutout Army but then lost their first match after returning home.\nThe Terriers had to wait over two weeks for their next game but were finally able to settle the season series with MIT at the beginning of March. The game was fairly listless through two periods with only a goal from Jack Lawless on the scoresheet. During the second intermission, George V. Brown, the owner of the Boston Arena, decided that the game wasn't worth continuing and he ordered the match called. BU and the crowd then got ready to leave, however, Brown did not have the authority to end the match and referee Frank Synott along with MIT refused to comply. When the puck was dropped for the start of the third, BU was still packing their things in the locker room and MIT scored several goals into an empty cage. After continued with the farce for a few moments, MIT's coach, Bill Stewart, called a halt to play and sent the team manager into the dressing room to convince the Terriers to return to the ice to finish the match. After a shot time, Gaw and the team agreed and the game was resumed at 11:30. In the meantime, Stewart had the scorekeeper erase the goals then had been scored by the Engineers as he did not want to win by default. The final 20 minutes of the match saw a much improved effort from both teams and were a sight for the few remaining fans. One more goal for BU was scored in the final frame and allowed the Terriers to claim supremacy for the year.\nFor their penultimate game, the Terriers got a rematch with Boston College and Silverberg made sure the Eagles would not get the better of him. With help from Ling and Viano on defense, every shot from BC went for naught and two markers from Lawless were more than enough to carry the day. The win ensured that the two were even not only on the season but also had to share honors for the Winsor trophy with each having scored 7 goals in the matches between themselves and Harvard. The final game for the Terriers came a week later against an amateur club, the Tech Beavers, which resulted in a loss.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The season currently includes 16 singles title events, two doubles title events, and a non-title team event.\nOn November 1, 2023, the PBA and Fox announced that the 2024 season will have over 60 hours of live coverage on Fox and FS1 networks. Multiple standard title events move to FS1 from previous streaming-only broadcasts, and Fox terrestrial stations will have eight broadcasts, the most since Fox acquired PBA broadcast rights in 2019.\nSeason overview.\nAs in 2023, the final rounds of all five major events will be broadcast live on over-the-air network television (Fox network). This includes the finals of the PBA Players Championship on January 15, the U.S. Open on February 4, the USBC Masters on March 31, the PBA World Championship on April 21 (part of the five-event PBA World Series of Bowling XV in Allen Park, Michigan), and the PBA Tournament of Champions on April 28. All five majors will pay out a $100,000 top prize. Also scheduled for the Fox network will be a PBA All-Star event with Fox NASCAR at the Shriners Children's 500 in Avondale, Arizona.\nFrom February 5 to March 3, there are four “classic series” events which each award a standard title. The final round of these events will be broadcast on FS1. The 2024 season will also see the return of the PBA Playoffs, which was last hosted in 2022.\nThe PBA League Elias Cup team competition returns with a revised format, and the new moniker \"PBA Elite League\". While the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals broadcasts on FS1 remain in September, as in 2023, there will be season-long qualifying events at the first 14 PBA Tour stops. The league is reduced to eight teams of six players (from ten teams of five players previously), and head-to-head Baker matches throughout the season will reduce the field to six teams prior to the September 15 quarterfinals.\nOn July 31-August 2, the PBA will host its first-ever mixed trios event in Jonesboro, Arkansas. The event will feature trio teams pairing PBA, PBA50 and PWBA players.\nTournament summary.\nThe events currently scheduled for the 2024 PBA season are shown below. Major tournaments are in bold. Career PBA title numbers for winners are shown in parentheses (#). Winner's share prize money is shown in US dollars ($), except where indicated.\nTour points are awarded for most events. Besides the season-ending Harry Smith PBA Points Winner award, points are one consideration for Player of the Year voting and also affect eligibility and seeding for the PBA Playoffs (2024 points only) and PBA Tour Finals (with 2023 points)."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Mississippi",
        "text": "Mississippi has an inglorious history with ice hockey in the United States. Though a few teams have attempted to call the state home since the 1990s, few have met with any success.\nHistory.\nLike many other states in the Deep South, Mississippi did not see its first official ice hockey team until the 1990s. The rise and expansion of the ECHL brought the Mississippi Sea Wolves into being in 1996 and the team saw some interest from the locals. After two seasons, the attendance figures began to dwindle but the team put together a tremendous season and won the league championship in 1999. Despite the title, and continued success on the ice, the Sea Wolves dropped from over 6,000 per game in the 90s to just over 3,000 in 2003. Even with their attendance halved, the team soldiered on and began to see slight improvements in the mid-2000. However, the destruction brought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 damaged the team's home rink, the Mississippi Coast Coliseum. The franchise was forced to go dormant for two years while it was repaired but the Sea Wolves did finally return in 2007.\nWhile the team saw modest crowds that year, their poor performance began to see the attendance dwindle and by the end of their second year back the financial situation was no longer tenable. After the team folded in 2009, the SPHL decided to try its hand at in the region and founded the Mississippi Surge. The new team played in the same arena as the Sea Wolves and started off similarly as well. The Surge won the league championship in its second season but, just like the previous franchise, they weren't able to get the locals to buy in after the title. The Surge managed to hang on for five years but, with low attendance figures in each season, the team ceased in 2014. After the Surge were sold and moved to Virginia, the coast region was left without a hockey team for eight years. That void was finally filled by the arrival of the Federal Prospects Hockey League, a single-A minor league, who brought back the Mississippi Sea Wolves. While the new team had no formal connection with the earlier club, they used a similar color scheme and tried to back on local nostalgia to help the new franchise.\nA few years after the original Sea Wolves began, a second ECHL team appeared when a franchise relocated and became the Jackson Bandits. The team had a difficult start but began to perform well in its second season, finishing second in their division. After a second good season in 2002, Bernard Ebbers sold the team after he was forced to resign as CEO of WoldCom during an investigation that would eventually lead to his conviction for fraud. While the new owners had nothing to do with Ebbers, the team suddenly saw its attendance figures drop to almost half of what they had been in 2000. With the Bandits unable to sustain themselves, and the prospect of a new arena fleeting, the franchise folded after the year.\nIn the far northern reaches of the state, two different attempts were made at placing a hockey team in Mississippi. The Tupelo T-Rex began play in 1998 as members of the WPHL. The team played well enough to be invited to join the CHL in 2001 when the two leagues merged but the team's owners declined. The CHL responded by exerting a non-compete clause that was part of the merger, barring the T-Rex from playing in the region for the next five years. In order to get around this problem, the team reorganized as a junior team but those efforts only lasted for two seasons. In 2003 an attempt was made to circumvent the CHL clause by joining the newly-formed ACHL, however, the league had its own troubles and was unwilling to get into a legal fight with the CHL.\nPart of the reason for the animosity from the CHL was that one of its founding teams, the Memphis RiverKings, had moved a few miles south in 2000 and were then located in northwestern Mississippi. They had hoped that the inclusion of the T-Rex would give the two a geographic rivalry that would increase fan interest but the WPHL franchise ruined those plans. Instead, the team that would eventually become the Mississippi RiverKings soldiered on by itself and became one of the top teams in the league. They won the league championship in 2002 and 2003 and saw modest but consistent crowds for over a decade in the Magnolia State. Unfortunately, the CHL began to have financial problems after the Great Recession and the RiverKings decided to jump to the SPHL in 2011. While their new league continued after the collapse of the CHL in 2014, the RiverKings saw their crowds shrink to just over 2,200 per game. The loss in revenue forced the team to suspend operations in 2018 and, while no official word was ever given, the franchise is effectively defunct.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nMississippi has one of the lowest engagement rates in the nation with just 0.008% of residents registered with USA Hockey as of 2022. That year, Mississippi had the least number of registered players in the nation (260). Despite this, the Magnolia State does have one home-grown player of note. Reagan Rust was introduced to the game in a local league organized by the Mississippi RiverKings and had to make 12-hour commutes to participate in an elite ice hockey program in Pittsburgh. Despite the difficulties, she was able to earn a scholarship to play NCAA Division I and later became the first Mississippi resident to play major professional ice hockey."

        "title": "1934–35 French Rugby League Cup",
        "text": "The 1934–35 Coupe de France de Rugby à XIII was the inaugural edition of the Coupe de France de Rugby à XIII (), the country's original and premier knockout competition for the sport of rugby league football. It coincided with the holding of the inaugural French Rugby League Championship. US Lyon-Villeurbanne won the tournament, beating Perpignan-based XIII Catalan in the final. One week after the tournament's conclusion, the winning team was presented with a championship trophy donated by Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, and the competition later became known by its name, the Coupe Lord Derby.\nFormat.\nThe Coupe de France was initially projected to feature all professional and some amateur clubs, with competition starting on 9 December 1934. However, as the difference in playing standard between the two classes was deemed too high at this early stage of the game's development, it was decided that this inaugural edition would only include the ten teams from the French professional championship. The competition was abridged from five rounds to four, and all games were played in the year 1935. Select amateur clubs would be included the following year, and the French Rugby League would create a second competition, initially called Coupe de France Amateur and today known as Coupe de France Albert-Falcou, specifically for amateur clubs in 1937.\nA preliminary round was organized involving the four lowest ranked teams in the regular season of the French championship. Following this, a draw was held on 5 February 1935 at Hôtel Régina in Toulouse during an assembly of the French Rugby League, which determined the quarterfinal matchups. The seeding of the semifinals was predetermined, and teams were not re-seeded or re-drawn. Host cities were chosen by the league on a per-game basis. Paris was considered as a host city, early on for the final, and later for a semifinal, but all games were ultimately staged in the southern half of the country.\nEarly rounds.\nThe embattled S.O. Béziers, which was struggling in the championship standings, did not take the field for its preliminary round fixture in Perpignan, and the match was cancelled at the last minute, with the referee and fans already inside XIII Catalan's Stade du Vernet. According to contemporary press, Béziers purposely no-showed the game in order to aggravate the opposing side, due to a personal conflict between executives of both organizations. Béziers only received a warning, and was told the club could be expelled if this happened again.\nThe quarterfinal between Villeneuve and Bordeaux on marked the first league game ever played in Toulouse, the epicenter of French rugby. French league pioneer Jean Galia originally tried to book downtown Toulouse's Parc des Sports, but the price tag was too high, and he had to make do with Stade Jacques-Thomas, an undersized and off-center venue. The stadium had to be refurbished and expanded on very short notice, with work scheduled as late as the eve of the fixture. A radio broadcast was arranged, and agreements with local transportation companies were negotiated to improve access on game day. It proved a resounding success, drawing at least 12,000 patrons for a gate of more than 70,000 francs, the best in the French game's short history. However, the league was criticized for grossly overbooking the stadium, which may partly have been a product of unauthorized admissions, as some sources quoted attendance as high as 15,000 when including those. The small press box also could not hold all attending journalists. In the second half, the crowd started spilling over from the cramped stands onto the field, leading to a strip of about 10 × 100 metre being unusable by the players. The quality of the pitch was also criticized, and more work was done on it to bring it to an acceptable level in time for the upcoming semifinal between Paris and XIII Catalan. Therefore, the event got mixed reviews despite public interest, with some questioning whether future games would draw as well. The Toulouse semifinal was indeed not as successful, which was blamed on the first game's mess, as well as a more competitive Easter date.\nThe quarterfinal between Lyon and Roanne was also controversial. The planned referee defaulted on his assignment, and his hasty replacement by the name of Rousset failed to assert control over the game. When he chose to award a contentious try to Lyon-Villeurbanne's Robert Samatan at the end of the first period, the Roanne players refused to return to the pitch for the second, and forfeited the game in protest. An angry mob of paying patrons attempted to storm the visiting team's locker room. The situation was defused when they were promised free admission to a future championship game against Pau two weeks later.\nThe semifinals saw the competition's most anticipated clash, between the pre-season's two most hyped teams, Lyon-Villeurbanne and Villeneuve-sur-Lot. Villeneuve, which had dominated the regular season, had by then established itself as the favorite. The loss therefore came as a bitter disappointment for the club, which indicated that it would have to consider reinforcements for the season's final stretch. Jean Galia, who had planned to retire after that season, announced that he would continue playing to get his hands on the cup.\nFinal.\nIn the final, again played in Toulouse and hampered by torrential rain, XIII Catalan managed to keep the score even by the end of the first half. However, they collapsed in the second against heavy favorites Lyon-Villeurbanne, who took the tournament's inaugural edition by a wide margin of 22–7.\nGame against Challenge Cup winners.\nThanks to the cooperation of the French and English leagues, both Coupe de France and Challenge Cup finals took place on the same weekend and, to support the new French tournament, it was decided that the Challenge Cup winners would travel to Paris the following weekend to face their French counterparts in a special unification game. The RFL representative, Castleford, narrowly beat Lyon-Villeurbanne by a score of 24–21. It is prior to that game, rather than directly after the Coupe de France final, that RFL representatives handed over to the French the trophy that would become the emblem of their main knockout competition, the Lord Derby Cup."

        "text": "The 2024 Masters (officially the 2024 MrQ Masters) was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place from 7 to 14 January 2024 at Alexandra Palace in London, England. The second Triple Crown event of the 2023–24 snooker season, following the 2023 UK Championship and preceding the 2024 World Championship, the tournament was the 50th edition of the Masters, which was first held in 1975. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by online casino MrQ, the tournament was broadcast by the BBC, Eurosport, and Discovery+ domestically, and by multiple other broadcasters internationally. The winner received £250,000 from a total prize pool of £725,000.\nThe top 16 players in the snooker world rankings, as they stood after the UK Championship, were invited to the event. Judd Trump was the defending champion, having defeated Mark Williams 108 in the 2023 final, but he lost 56 to Ali Carter in the quarter-finals. Ronnie O'Sullivan defeated Carter 107 in the final to win a record-extending eighth Masters title and 23rd Triple Crown title. He became the oldest Masters winner, aged , surpassing Stuart Bingham, who was 43 years and 243 days old when he won the 2020 event. O'Sullivan already held the record as the tournament's youngest winner—set 29 years earlier at the 1995 event—which gave him the distinction of simultaneously becoming the youngest and oldest Masters champion. \nThe tournament produced 27 century breaks, including two maximum breaks. Ding Junhui made the first maximum in his first-round match against O'Sullivan, and Mark Allen made the second in his quarter-final match against Mark Selby. These were respectively the fourth and fifth maximum breaks in the tournament's history. In his quarter-final match against Allen, Carter became the first player to make three consecutive century breaks at the Masters. Carter made a record nine centuries in the tournament, surpassing the previous record of eight set by O'Sullivan at the 2007 and 2009 events.\nOverview.\nThe 2024 Masters was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place from 7 to 14 January 2024 at Alexandra Palace in London, England. The second Triple Crown event of the 2023–24 snooker season, the tournament was the 50th edition of the Masters, which was first held in 1975 for 10 invited players at the West Centre Hotel in London. John Spencer won the inaugural event, defeating Ray Reardon on a in the deciding frame of the final. The Masters is the second-longest-running professional snooker tournament after the World Snooker Championship, and has been staged at Alexandra Palace since 2012. The most successful player in its history has been Ronnie O'Sullivan, who had previously won the title seven times, most recently in 2017.\nThe 16 highest ranked players in the snooker world rankings after the 2023 UK Championship were invited to participate in the single-elimination tournament. The defending champion was English player Judd Trump, who won his second Masters title at the previous year's event by defeating his Welsh opponent Mark Williams 108 in the final. As defending champion, Trump was the first seed, while Luca Brecel was seeded second as the reigning World Champion. The next six players in the world rankings were seeded third to eighth, allocated fixed positions in the , and drawn randomly against the remaining eight participants. The first-round draw was made during the UK Championship final. Matches were played as the best of 11 until the final, which was played as the best of 19 frames held over two .\nParticipants.\nThe event featured the top 16 players in the world rankings, as they stood after the UK Championship. Zhang Anda, who entered the top 16 for the first time after winning his maiden ranking title at the 2023 International Championship, was the only Masters debutant. After failing to qualify for the previous two Masters tournaments, Ding Junhui qualified for the 2024 event when he regained his place in the top 16 by reaching the UK Championship final. Hossein Vafaei, who made his Masters debut the previous year, was ranked 17th after losing to O'Sullivan in the UK Championship semi-finals, and did not qualify for the 2024 event.\nBroadcasters.\nThe tournament was broadcast in the United Kingdom by BBC Sport, and in Europe (including the UK and Ireland) by Eurosport and Discovery+. It was broadcast in China by China Central Television and streamed by Huya and Migu. It was broadcast in Hong Kong by Now TV, in Brazil and the United States by DAZN, in Pakistan by Fastsports, in Malaysia and Brunei by Astro SuperSport, in Taiwan by Sport Cast, in Thailand by TrueVisions, and in the Philippines by Premier Sports. In all other territories, the event was streamed by Matchroom Sport.\nPrize money.\nThe winner of the event received £250,000 from a total prize pool of £725,000. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nSummary.\nFirst round.\nThe first-round matches were played from 7 to 10 January as the best of 11 frames. Luca Brecel, the reigning World Champion, faced 2023 semi-finalist Jack Lisowski, who moved into a 40 lead at the mid-session interval with breaks of 70, 100, 96, and 69. Although Brecel reduced Lisowski's lead to 42 with breaks of 80 and 72, Lisowski produced breaks of 63 and 68 to secure a 62 win. Lisowski's 100 break in the second frame was his 300th century break in professional competition. Having recently reached the final of an exhibition event in Macau, Lisowski commented: \"I think I found something in China because I was really struggling [this season] and I was really scared coming here because I did not know which Jack was going to turn up.\" Brecel expressed frustration with his form, saying: \"It was terrible. If I keep playing like this then you will see me in 2025 Q School.\"\nShaun Murphy, the 2015 champion, played Masters debutant Zhang Anda. The match was level at 11, but Murphy capitalised on Zhang's positional errors in the third and fourth frames to take on a 31 lead at the mid-session interval. Murphy also took the fifth frame with a break of 86. Zhang closed to 42 with a 69 break, but Murphy made breaks of 71 and 89 to win the last two frames for a 62 victory. Murphy commented that Zhang had \"been one of the best players of all season\" and that if he had played badly, \"he would have turned me over. With that in mind I've worked very hard in the background.\" In defeat, Zhang commented \"Shaun played better than me tonight. I missed some very simple shots and he took his chances to win the game.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan, a seven-time winner, faced the 2011 champion Ding Junhui. The players had met at the 2023 UK Championship final, where O'Sullivan defeated Ding 10‍7 to capture his eighth UK title. O'Sullivan took a 40 lead, making breaks of 67, 87, and 106. After the mid-session interval, Ding responded with breaks of 61 and 92, and then a maximum break of 147, to narrow O'Sullivan's lead to 43. It was the fourth maximum in the tournament's history, the seventh maximum of Ding's professional career, and the second time Ding had made a maximum at the Masters, having previously done so at the 2007 event. However, O'Sullivan then made breaks of 127 and 93 to secure a 63 victory. Afterwards, O'Sullivan called Ding's maximum break \"unbelievable\" and called his opponent a \"magnificent player\" and a \"delight to watch.\" Ding said: \"To make a maximum was amazing, it has been a long time since I felt like that.\"\nMark Williams, a two-time winner, played 2020 finalist Ali Carter. The score was level at 22 at the mid-session interval. Williams made a 93 break in frame 5 to lead 32, but Carter produced back-to-back century breaks of 118 and 133 to take a 43 lead. Williams tied the scores at 44 with an 86 break, but Carter took the last two frames with breaks of 61 and 73 to secure a 64 victory. Carter said after the match: \"All parts of my game were good. I potted a lot of tricky balls tonight and that was pleasing.\"\nDefending champion Judd Trump faced 2018 finalist Kyren Wilson. Kyren established a 30 lead as he made breaks of 65 and 76. Trump then won five frames in a row to lead 53. However, Wilson won the next two frames to level the score to 55 and force a . Wilson made a break of 51 in the deciding frame, before running out of and missing a pot on a tricky . This allowed Trump to pot the same red and make a of 65 to win the frame on the last , and take the match by 65. Trump commented: \"I felt nervy from the start and my wasn't good. Under pressure in the clearance at the end, I shortened my backswing, it was more of a 'stab' but that helped with my position.\"\nNeil Robertson, another two-time winner, played two-time runner-up Barry Hawkins. The players had contested the 2022 final, with Robertson winning 104. The score was level at 11 after two closely contested frames that lasted over an hour. Hawkins won three frames in a row to lead 41, but Robertson made back-to-back centuries of 117 and 110 to narrow Hawkins's lead to 43. Hawkins then took the eighth and ninth frames with breaks of 69 and 57 to win the match 63. He said after the match: \"It didn't come easily tonight and everything was a bit of a struggle. I tried my hardest and that is all you can do out there really.\"\nMark Allen, who had suffered five consecutive first-round defeats at the Masters since winning the 2018 event, faced two-time champion John Higgins. Higgins made breaks of 83 and 80 to lead 31 at the mid-session interval, but Allen won 4 frames in a row to lead 53, making a century break of 123 in the 8th frame. Higgins won frames 9 and 10 with 58 and 61 breaks to level the score at 55 to force a decider, which Allen took with a break of 86 to secure a 65 victory. Allen commented: \"I was edgy all day but then 55 was the calmest I felt. This was a big hurdle for me to get over, having lost all of my first round games since I won it. The positive I can take from today is how good I felt in the last frame.\"\nMark Selby, a three-time winner, played Robert Milkins, who made his third Masters appearance and his first in 9 years. Milkins had never won a match at the Masters, having lost in the first round to O'Sullivan in 2014 and Robertson in 2015. Selby produced breaks of 119, 53, and 63 to lead 40 at the mid-session interval. Milkins narrowed the score to 41 with an 88 break in the fifth frame, but Selby won the next two frames with breaks of 70 and 74 for a 61 victory. Selby said after the match: \"[Milkins] had a good chance in the first frame after I missed an easy black. If he wins the frame there he settles and it is a totally different game. Thankfully he missed, I settled first and managed to kick on from then.\"\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played from 11 to 12 January as the best of 11 frames. In the first quarter-final, O'Sullivan faced Hawkins. The players had previously contested the 2016 final, which O'Sullivan won 101. O'Sullivan opened the match with a break of 88, but Hawkins led 32, having made breaks of 74 and 56 in the fourth and fifth frames. Despite missed pots by both players, O'Sullivan won three of the next four frames to lead 53. In the ninth frame, Hawkins missed a pot while on a break of 50, and O'Sullivan made a 77 clearance to win the match 63. After the match, O'Sullivan apologised to Hawkins for his poor performance, saying: \"I felt bad for [Hawkins]. I just dragged him down to my level. That's the most awful standard of snooker.\" Hawkins commented: \"[O'Sullivan] was there for the taking. I had plenty of chances but I didn't take them. It's frustrating but I didn't deserve to win.\"\nMurphy played Lisowski in the second quarter-final. Murphy won the first frame with a 75 break and Lisowski took the second with a 74. Murphy won the next four frames, making breaks of 131, 76, and 123, to lead 51. Lisowski took the seventh and eighth frames to narrow the score to 53, but Murphy won the ninth frame on the last black to complete a 63 victory. \"You just never feel safe against [Lisowski] because he's a huge talent,\" Murphy said afterwards. Lisowski commented: \"I didn't feel great, but I just kept clinging on. [Murphy] finished strongly.\"\nThe third quarter-final was played between Trump and Carter. The scores were level at 2–2 at the mid-session interval, Carter having made breaks of 85 and 103 in the first and third frames and Trump an 80 in the second. Carter won two consecutive frames with breaks of 71 and 64 to lead 42, but Trump made a century break of 129 in the 7th frame, despite a wasp being attached to his waistcoat throughout, and also won the eighth and ninth frames to lead 54. However, Carter won the tenth frame with a 43 clearance and made a 64 break in the decider to secure a 65 victory. Carter commented that he \"lost [his] composure for a couple of frames\" but was \"delighted to make an unbelievable clearance to force a decider.\" Trump said that \"[Carter] played well and I struggled.\" He added that he was \"disappointed\" but that Carter \"deserved to win.\"\nAllen and Selby contested the last quarter-final. Selby won the first two frames, but Allen made a maximum break in the third frame, after running out of position multiple times and making difficult recovery pots. It was the third maximum of Allen's professional career, the fifth in the tournament's history, and the second made in that year's event, following the maximum by Ding in the first round. Allen became the first player from the UK or Ireland to make a maximum break in the 50-year history of the tournament, as the previous four maximums at the Masters had all been made by overseas players—Canada's Kirk Stevens in 1984, China's Ding in 2007 and 2024, and Hong Kong's Marco Fu in 2015. Selby made a break of 82 in the 4th frame and took the fifth frame to move 41 ahead, but Allen won four frames in a row, making breaks of 56 and 103 in the sixth and seventh frames, to lead 54. Selby won the 10th frame to force a decider, which Allen took to secure a 65 victory. The match finished at 00:15 GMT on 13 January. Commenting on his maximum break, Allen said: \"To do it here at the Masters was very special. It wasn't the best cue ball [control] in the world but it made it more exciting for the crowd and a bit more nerve-racking for me, but I'm glad I've finally done it for the fans.\"\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 13 January as the best of 11 frames. O'Sullivan played Murphy, the first time the players had faced each other at the Masters. O'Sullivan won the first two frames, but Murphy won the third with a century break of 131. O'Sullivan took the fourth frame after a to lead 31 at the mid-session interval. Murphy narrowed the score to 32 with another century break of 100, but O'Sullivan made breaks of 90, 71, and 62 to win three frames in a row and capture a 62 victory. It was O'Sullivan's 14th win in 15 semi-final appearances. He commented afterwards: \"At the start there were a few mistakes but I cleaned it up a little bit—and I need to do that these days, because I can't pot as well as these guys but I can make breaks among the balls and make up for it that way.\" Murphy said: \"He was just too good—simple as that. If he plays like that, you may as well give him the trophy now.\" Murphy, who received criticism for participating in the BBC commentary team for the previous night's quarter-final between Allen and Selby, insisted that the late finish of that match had not affected his semi-final performance, saying: \"If I thought [commentating] was detrimental to my life I wouldn't be doing it.\"\nCarter played Allen in the other semi-final. Allen won the first frame after a safety exchange, but Carter made breaks of 71, 100, 101, and 105 to win four frames in a row and lead 41. In doing so, Carter became the first player to compile three consecutive century breaks at the Masters. Allen responded with a century in the sixth frame, and also won the seventh to close the score to 43. However, Carter took the next two frames, after a 42-minute ninth frame, which was halted briefly for a medical emergency in the crowd, to secure a 63 victory. Carter commented: \"I really got it going in the middle there and felt really good and [Allen] showed what a great player he is with a good [century break].\" Allen said: \"I just came up against an opponent that played well. I got myself back into the game at 43 but I couldn't kick on from there. Well done to [Carter].\"\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 14 January as the best of 19 frames held over two sessions, between O'Sullivan and Carter. The final was officiated by Ben Williams. O'Sullivan contested his 14th Masters final, having won 7 and lost 6 previously, while Carter competed in his second, having lost the 2020 final to Stuart Bingham. The two players had met 25 times previously in professional play. Carter had won only 3 of those matches, and only once in a match held as a best-of-seven or longer, in the second round of the 2018 World Championship. It was the third time the players had contested a Triple Crown final, having previously met in the 2008 and 2012 World Championship finals, both of which O'Sullivan won.\nO'Sullivan won the opening frame of the first session, but Carter made a century break of 106 in the second, and won the third frame to lead 21. O'Sullivan responded with a break of 125 to level the scores at 22 at the mid-session interval. Carter won the fifth frame with a century break of 122, before winning frame six. O'Sullivan made a break of 86 in the penultimate frame, but Carter made a 74 break in the eighth frame to lead 5–3 after the first session.\nIn the evening session, Carter extended his advantage to 63 by winning the ninth frame, but O'Sullivan won the next with a break of 58. He also won the 11th frame, and then made a break of 64 to tie the scores at 66 at the mid-session interval. Carter made a century break of 127 in frame 13, his ninth century break at the tournament, breaking O'Sullivan's record of eight at the 2007 and 2009 events. However, O'Sullivan won the next two frames to take the lead at 8–7, before making a break of 89 to move one frame from victory. Carter's missed on a in frame 17 let O'Sullivan complete a 107 victory and win a record-extending eighth Masters title and 23rd Triple Crown title. He became the oldest Masters winner, aged , surpassing Bingham, who won the 2020 event aged . He already held the record as the youngest winner at the Masters, having won the 1995 event aged 19 years and 69 days.\nSpeaking after the match, O'Sullivan commented that Carter had played poorly in the second session, but said that Carter would have had to \"scrape me off the table\" to win. Carter however said he was \"gutted\", but spoke positively about reaching the final for a second time. Having lost his third major final to O'Sullivan, Carter quoted Jimmy White, who said \"he's beginning to annoy me\" after losing his fourth World Championship final to Stephen Hendry in 1994. O'Sullivan announced that would take two months away from the sport and miss some tournaments: \"Too much intense snooker for me is not good. I now need to back off and consolidate, and get some fun in the game.\"\nO'Sullivan's wins at the 2023 UK Championship and 2024 Masters marked the second time he had won two Triple Crown events in the same season; he had previously accomplished this in the 2007–08 season when he won the 2007 UK Championship and 2008 World Championship. It gave him the prospect of capturing all three Triple Crown events in the same season, a feat previously accomplished by three other players: Steve Davis in 1987–88, Hendry in the 1989–90 and 1995–96 seasons, and Williams in 2002–03. Commenting on this prospect, he said: \"I've never been driven by titles or numbers. I could still win [the 2024 World Championship], but at the moment I feel like I am having to squeeze everything out just to get a result which is hard, but I am a competitor so I will keep fighting.\"\nTournament draw.\nNumbers in parentheses after the players' names denote the players' seedings, whilst players in bold denote match winners. All matches were played as the best of 11 frames except the final, which was played as the best of 19 frames.\nControversies.\nThe event was held at Alexandra Palace back-to-back after the 2024 PDC World Darts Championship. Both events had match play interrupted by insects. In the first round match between Mark Williams and Ali Carter, a fly landed on a red ball, which Williams was lining up for a pot. The match between Neil Robertson and Barry Hawkins was paused to allow referee Rob Spencer to remove a wasp from the table. In his quarter final match against Carter, Judd Trump made a century break of 129 in the seventh frame, while having a wasp attached to his waistcoat throughout. Trump commented: \"It's gone on a little bit too long now, they need to find a way to get rid of it, just to make it easier for the viewing public.\" Ronnie O'Sullivan criticised the venue, calling it \"disgusting\" and saying it \"makes [him] feel ill\".\nThe venue was often praised for its passionate crowd. However, during the quarter-final match against Robert Milkins, a clattering sound from the audience caused Mark Selby to miss a red. An enraged Selby swung his cue in the air, and later called the noise \"brain-dead\". The crowd also drew sharp criticism from Carter after the final. The match was frequently disturbed by shouts from the audience. A frustrated Carter called them \"some morons\" after the match, saying: \"You've got people shouting when you are on your shot and saying stupid things at important times because half of them haven't got enough brains, it's ridiculous.\"\nIn the post-match interview following the final, Carter accused O'Sullivan of \"snotting all over the floor\", calling it \"outrageous behaviour from a top professional\". O'Sullivan responded with a series of expletive-laden tirades, saying that \"To have to play snooker against someone like that is a nightmare\" and claiming that Carter needed to \"sort his life out\". He brandished a middle finger and said that \"[Carter] can sit on it as far as I'm concerned.\" O'Sullivan, who is involved in a disciplinary dispute with the sport's governing body, the WPBSA, is being reviewed by the World Snooker Tour for the outburst.\nCentury breaks.\nThere were 27 century breaks made during the tournament. The highest of these were the two maximum breaks, the first by Ding Junhui in the opening round, and secondly by Mark Allen in the quarter-finals. The nine century breaks made by Carter were the most made by any player at a single Masters tournament."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Louisiana",
        "text": "Louisiana has seen many failed attempts to expand ice hockey within its borders. While many teams have met unfortunate ends, a concerted effort has allowed a few teams to establish themselves in the state.\nHistory.\nLouisiana was effectively an afterthought for the ice hockey community until the 1990s. When the sport began expanding south at the end of the 20th century, the Bayou State was one of the main targets for minor professional leagues. The Louisiana IceGators were the first team to call the state home. When they debuted in 1995, the IceGators were very successful in the ticket booth; after drawing more than 9,000 fans on average for their inaugural season, the team saw crows of over 11,000 for years two and three. The immediate success induced the ECHL to relocate a dormant franchise to Baton Rouge in 1996 and then place a third team in the state in 1997. With the Baton Rouge Kingfish and New Orleans Brass both in action, the year-old WPHL decided to get into the action and expanded eastwards with the Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs, Monroe Moccasins and Lake Charles Ice Pirates beginning play in 1997 and the Alexandria Warthogs following a year afterwards. A state that had virtually no history with ice hockey suddenly found itself with seven different minor league teams but the shine had already worn off.\nThe initial success of IceGators soon fell away and the attendance figures for the club dropped precipitously after 1999. While those figures didn't adversely affect the team well into the 21st century, the other clubs had not started out in such a charmed position. The Kingfish, who were mired in mediocrity for the stay in Louisiana, began with crowds numbering 6,000 but saw that number diminish every year. The Brass, on the other hand, posted winning records every year and their march to the quarterfinals in year two allowed the team to move into the much larger New Orleans Arena. Their attendance figures swelled but soon relaxed to less than 5,000. While that number was still enough to keep the team afloat, the team was offered a poison pill when the New Orleans Hornets arrived in 2002. The NBA franchise got the state (the owners of the Arena at the time) to force the Brass to cover the cost of converting the building from basketball to hockey and back as a condition of remaining at the venue. Though the team was solvent, they would not have been able to afford the additional expense and were forced to search elsewhere for a home. To make matters worse, the Municipal Auditorium, the original home of the team, had just finished a renovation that had included the removal of the icemaking equipment. With no viable buildings available the team folded and the rest of the ECHL teams fell like dominoes.\nIn the meantime, the WPHL had fared even worse. While the Mudbugs were one of the leagues best teams, winning three consecutive championships and commanding more than 4,000 in attendance in each of their first four seasons, the Warthogs were only able to stick around for two years while the Ice Pirates and Moccasins each saw dwindling ticket sales and folded in 2001. That season saw the collapse of the entire league and while that could have meant the dissolution of the Mudbugs as well, the team was able to stay alive when the WPHL merged with the CHL. The team not only survived but flourished in their new league, routinely winning their division while making several deep playoff runs. In the mid-2000s, the Mudbugs were seeing over 5,000 fans per game but their finances took a hit during the Great Recession. After 2008, the team saw its crowd diminish to less than 3,500 and, despite winning the league championship in 2011, the team could no longer afford to operate.\nIn 2005, junior hockey arrived in the state in the form of the Cajun Catahoulas. The team was never successful, winning just 19 games in three years before relocating. After the recession, the SPHL sought to bring the IceGators back in 2009. Despite using the same venue as the previous incarnation, the Cajundome, the team could barely draw more than 2,000 fans per game, well below the league average. Even success on the ice was unable to bring more people into the building and the IceGators got what they hoped was good news when the Cajundome closed for renovations in 2016. The team suspended operations for the season with intent of returning once the venue reopened, however, in the interim the team shut down its business department and website. In 2018 the franchise was sold and moved to the Quad Cities.\nAfter the departure of the second IceGators, another revival occurred in the state when the Shreveport Mudbugs returned. While the new team played junior hockey and had no formal connection to the prior club, they used the same venue, colors and logo while also bringing back former Mudbug Kārlis Zirnis as the team first head coach. The team was an instant hit, just like their namesake, and they won the league championship in their second season. A second title followed after the COVID-19 pandemic and helped establish the team as a fixture. Baton Rouge was the next city to see a return of ice hockey when the Baton Rouge Zydeco were founded in 2023.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nIn spite of the myriad professional team that have called the state home, Louisiana residents have a very low level of engagement. Less than 300 people were registered with USA Hockey in 2022 placing the state 50th in the nation in terms of both total and population percentage."

        "text": "The 1929–30 MIT Engineers men's ice hockey season was the 29th season of play for the program. The Engineers were coached by Bill Stewart in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nMIT began the season at the beginning of December when the team held its first meetings. With team captain Bill Cullinan hanging around for an extra season, the team was full of experienced players but coach Stewart saw fit to find new uses for some of his returning charges. Dan Lucey was moved from defense to center with new man Peterson assuming defensive responsibilities. Riley, who had been in goal for the entire '29 season, found himself being challenged by sophomores Coleman and Whiston but the veteran was in net for the opening match. Boston University, who had become an annual foe, was first on the slate. The Terriers had already been on the ice for 6 weeks and were expected to win the match but Riley had a whale of a game and limited BU to just a single goal. Hall's marker in the second proved to be the game winner and MIT won its season opener for the first time in seven years.\nThe team had over three weeks off before their next match and they spent as much time as they could getting ready for their nemesis, Harvard. Unfortunately, the team was no match for the Crimson and no matter how hard the Engineers tried, they could not match the speed of their cross-town rivals. Peterson, Ford and Hall were notable for their many sallies up the ice but only Ben Hazeltine managed to score for Harvard in an otherwise dismal affair. After a match with Williams was cancelled, the team had just the game with Northeastern before the exam break. Lucey opened the scoring in the first but the Huskies soon had the score tied once more. Riley turned in another stellar performance in the second half of the game, routinely stopping everything that was sent his way. The near-shutout performance allowed Peterson to score the winning goal in the second but it was the play on the penalty kill that was the story of the match. MIT saw a constant march of its players to the box during the match and at one point gave NU a 5-on-3 advantage for nearly 2 minutes. Riley was able to weather the storm and earned MIT its second victory.\nThe Engineers took their first road trip of the season during the break and met Clarkson up in the north country. The match had been rescheduled from the 10th due to warm weather but the time off did not favor the Engineers. Tech was trounced by the Knights and were shutout for the only time on the season. The team was able to swiftly recover and banish the aftertaste of the embarrassing loss by defeating St. Lawrence and New Hampshire on consecutive nights. The team ended its travels with a match at Princeton. The team looked much better at the Baker Rink than they had the year before and kept the score close. While the defense performed well, Hall's lone goal was the only marker for Tech and not enough to stave off defeat.\nThe team had a few weeks off to recover from the hectic schedule and played their final game of the season at Brown. Hall scored in the first to match an opening score from the Bears but, once again, that was the only offense the team could muster and MIT ended the year with a loss and allowed another possible winning season to slip through their fingers.\nPaul A. Davis served as team manager with.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Despite the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) forming in 1881 a good seven years before the LTA, it was the British body that set laws, settled disputes and organized the increasingly complicated tournament calendar before the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) formed in March, 1913.\nAfter the formation of the ILTF the world tennis circuit going forward was a highly organised and structured network of national and international tournaments. Most tennis tournaments were usually mixed events for men and women, and the women's international tennis circuit certainly up to 1923 was composed mainly of tournaments on the British and European Circuits. After the USNLTA joined the ILTF this would later change with more and more tournaments being staged globally. Women tennis players on the world circuit up to the open era were funded by their national associations enabling them to travel and take part in international tournaments.\nThe 1969 ILTF women's tennis circuit began on 1 January with the Border Championships, East London, South Africa. In the four most important tournaments of the year Margaret Court defeated the defending champion Billie Jean King in the final to win the women's singles tennis title at the Australian Open. It was her eighth Australian Open title and her fourteenth major title overall. In Paris French Open at Roland Garros. Margaret Court defeated Ann Jones in the final to win the women's singles tennis title. It was her third French Open title, her second major title of the year, and her fifteenth major overall.\nIn early summer in London, England at the Wimbledon Championships Britain's Ann Haydon Jones defeated the three-time defending American champion Billie Jean King in the final, to win the ladies' singles tennis title. It was her first Wimbledon title, and her third and last Grand Slam singles title overall. In New York the final Grand Slam tournament of the year is played at the US Open Australia's Margaret Court defeated Nancy Richey in the final, to win the women's singles tennis title. It was her third major singles title of the year, her third US Open singles title and her sixteenth singles major title overall. The circuit ended on 28 December 1969 at the Michel Bivort Cup tournament, Paris, France that was played indoors.\nSchedule.\nThis is a calendar of all official events that were administered by the International Lawn Tennis Federation in the year 1969, with player progression documented from the quarterfinals stage where sources permit. The table also includes Grand Slam events, and tournaments on the African, Asian, Australasia, Central American &amp; Caribbean, European, and South American ILTF regional circuits, as part of the annual world tennis circuit. Team events such as the Federation Cup and Wightman Cup are included.\nWorld rankings.\nThese are the Top 10 World Rankings for 1969 by tennis journalists, magazines and authors. WTA Rankings did not begin until 1974/75.\nTournament winners (singles).\nThis is a list of winners by the total number of singles titles won for 1969:"

        "text": "The 2024 Players Championship (officially the 2024 Johnstone's Paint Players Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 19 to 25 February 2024 at the Telford International Centre in Telford, England. The 14th ranking event of the 2023–24 season, following the Welsh Open and preceding the World Open, it was the second of three events in the Players Series, following the World Grand Prix and preceding the Tour Championship. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by Johnstone's Paint, the event was broadcast by ITV and ITVX domestically, by Eurosport and Discovery+ in Europe, and by other broadcasters worldwide. The winner received £125,000 from a total prize fund of £385,000.\nThe event featured the top 16 players on the one-year ranking list as it stood after the Welsh Open. Shaun Murphy won the 2023 event, defeating Ali Carter 104 in the final, but he failed to qualify for the 2024 edition. The 2022 winner, Neil Robertson, and the reigning World Champion, Luca Brecel, also failed to qualify.\nPlayers Championship debutant Zhang Anda reached his third ranking final of the season, and his career. But Mark Allen defeated Zhang 108 to win a second Players Championship title, his second ranking title of the season after the 2023 Shoot Out, and the 11th ranking title of his career.\nThe tournament produced 21 century breaks. Allen compiled three century breaks in a row during his first-round win over Mark Williams, including the tournament highest break of 146.\nFormat.\nThe event took place from 19 to 25 February 2024 at the Telford International Centre in Telford, England. It featured the top 16 players on the one-year ranking list as it stood after the 2024 Welsh Open.\nThe matches were played as the best of 11 frames until the final, which was the best of 19 frames, played over two . The 2023 champion was Shaun Murphy, who defeated Ali Carter 104 in that year's final. However, Murphy finished in 26th place on the one-year ranking list after his loss in the qualifying round at the Welsh Open, and thus failed to qualify for the 2024 event. The 2022 winner, Neil Robertson, and the reigning World Champion, Luca Brecel, also failed to qualify for the event, as they finished the Welsh Open ranked 68th and 39th respectively on the one-year list.\nBroadcasters.\nThe event was broadcast by ITV and ITVX in the UK; Eurosport and Discovery+ in Europe (excluding the UK and Ireland); Liaoning TV, Migu, and Huya in Mainland China; Now TV in Hong Kong; Astro SuperSport in Malaysia and Brunei; TrueVisions in Thailand; Sportcast in Taiwan; Premier Sports Network in the Philippines; Fastsports in Pakistan; and Matchroom.live in all other territories.\nPrize fund.\nThe event featured a prize pool of £385,000 with the winner receiving £125,000. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nSeeding list.\nUnlike other events where the defending champion is seeded first, the reigning World Champion second, and the rest based on the world rankings, the qualification and seedings in the Players Series tournaments are determined by the one-year ranking list. The below list shows the top-16 players with the most ranking points acquired during the 2023–24 season, as of after the 2024 Welsh Open:\nSummary.\nFirst round.\nThe first-round matches were played from 19 to 21 February as the best of 11 frames. Facing two-time champion and top seed Judd Trump, Chris Wakelin opened the match with a century break of 120.

Higgins won the first frame with a 102 break, and leveled the match at 22 at the mid-session interval. Ding made a 125 break to lead 32, and a 127 break to tie the scores at 44. Higgins took the ninth frame, then made a 100 break after a to win the tenth frame and the match 64. Higgins commended his opponent, saying: \"It's a brilliant win, because I've always struggled with Ding. It is good to get the better of him in the last couple of matches we have faced each other. I rate him so highly.\"\nThree-time World Champion Mark Williams played Mark Allen, winner of the 2016 event. Allen won the first three frames with consecutive century breaks of 146, 112, and 102. The 146 break was the highest break of the tournament. Williams won the next two frames, but Allen took three of the next four with breaks of 94, 70, and 68 for a 63 victory. Allen described his performance as \"the best I've played since winning the Champion of Champions.\" The fourth seed Gary Wilson, who had advanced to a career high of 12th in the world rankings after his Welsh Open victory the previous week, faced Hossein Vafaei, who made his second appearance at the tournament. The scores were tied at 44, but Wilson won the next two frames, making a 95 break in the tenth, to secure a 64 victory.\nWorld number one and second seed Ronnie O'Sullivan played Zhou Yuelong.

Zhou opened the match with a 77 break and led 21, but O'Sullivan won five consecutive frames, making a 136 break in the sixth, to win 62. Commenting on his return to tournament play after withdrawing from the Welsh Open, O'Sullivan said: \"I'm just trying to get away with playing as least as I can,\" describing his appearance at the Players Championship as \"a bit of paid practice\". Ali Carter, runner-up at the previous year's event, faced Tom Ford. The first two frames produced century breaks of 116 from Carter and 113 from Ford. The scores were tied at 22 at the mid-session interval, but Carter took four frames in a row to win 62.\nBarry Hawkins, the winner of the 2014 event and runner-up in 2022, played four-time World Champion Mark Selby. The match was tied at 22 at the mid-session interval, and Hawkins won frame five with a 91 break to lead 32. However, Selby took four consecutive frames to win 63. The third seed Zhang Anda faced Noppon Saengkham, with both players making their Players Championship debut. Saengkham made a 99 break in the third frame to lead 31 at the mid-session interval, and Zhang won the next three frames for a 43 advantage. Saengkham won frames eight and nine with breaks of 94 and 60 to re-take the lead at 54, but Zhang leveled the score to force a decider, which he won with a 65 break for a 65 victory.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played from 21 to 23 February as the best of 11 frames. Trump played Carter in the first quarter-final. Earlier in the season, Trump defeated Carter 107 in the 2023 Wuhan Open final, and Carter won their quarter-final encounter at the 2024 Masters in a decider. The score was level at 22 at the mid-session interval. During the fifth frame, the cue ball was replaced by referee Leo Scullion, as both players agreed it was too light. Trump made a break of 115 in the sixth frame, but was trailing 35 after frame eight. Trump narrowed the score to 45, however, Carter won frame ten on the last black, after a on the , to secure a 64 victory. Carter commented: \"I'm very close to my best. I'm 45 this year and I'm in the top eight of the world, which isn't bad.\"\nThe second quarter-final was played between Allen and Wilson. Allen made breaks of 84, 63, and 75 to lead 31 at the mid-session interval. Wilson leveled the score at 33, but Allen won three of the next four frames to capture a 64 victory. Allen commented: \"There were some long and drawn out frames. I felt Gary [Wilson] got the better of that. I should have closed it out 63, but I made a really good break in the last frame when the balls were awkward.\"\nIn the third quarter-final, Selby faced O'Sullivan. Selby won all four frames before the mid-session interval with breaks of 65, 91, 81, and 105, and took the fifth frame to lead 50. O'Sullivan was leading the sixth after making a 58 break, but Selby a long and went on to win the frame on the last black, for a 60 victory. O'Sullivan's loss ended his run of 16 consecutive match wins, which included his tournament wins at the 2023 UK Championship, 2024 Masters, and 2024 World Grand Prix. Selby said after the match: \"To beat Ronnie [O'Sullivan] in any tournament is a great scoreline, to beat him in the way I did, I am very, very pleased. It was more or less faultless.\" He added: \"If you can't get up for playing Ronnie [O'Sullivan] with a full crowd, which he always brings, then you are in the wrong game. That is where you want to test yourself. You see where your game is at when you are put against the best. At the moment my game seems to be in a good place.\"\nZhang and Higgins contested the fourth quarter-final, in the first professional match between the two. The first frame was interrupted when a member of the audience fell ill, and the arena was evacuated. When play resumed, Higgins took the frame after both players missed chances to win. However, Zhang won five frames in a row with breaks of 102, 79, 84, 104, and 95 to lead 51. Higgins won the next three frames to narrow the score to 45, but Zhang took frame ten to capture a 64 victory. Commenting on the win over Higgins, who he described as his childhood hero, Zhang said: \"I played pretty well, because I wanted to show what I can do in front of my hero. I was very dedicated to the job and I was able to concentrate on each shot. Even when he was coming back at me, I wasn't feeling nervous and I was very much enjoying watching his performance.\"\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 23 and 24 February as the best of 11 frames. Allen played Carter in the first semi-final. They shared the first two frames to draw the match at 11. Century breaks of 108 from Allen and 106 from Carter leveled the scores again at 22. From 33, Allen made breaks of 73 and 65 to lead 53, and went on to take the ninth frame on the last black for a 63 victory. Allen commented on the prospect of facing either Zhang or Selby in the final, saying: \"From a completely selfish point of view, I'd rather play Zhang Anda. Just because that keeps Selby's losing streak going a little longer.\" He added: \"Looking at the Tour Championship, China [World Open] and the World Championship, you want someone like Selby's confidence to be as low as possible.\"\nZhang faced Selby in the second semi-final. Zhang won all four frames before the mid-session interval, making breaks of 129, 80, 69, and 84, to lead 40, Selby having only potted a single ball. In the fifth frame, Zhang was leading by 560 but missed a pot, allowing Selby to make a of 62 and win the frame on the last black. Selby won two more frames to trail 34, and made a 113 break in frame nine to trail 45. He then capitalised on Zhang's multiple mistakes in the tenth frame, winning on the to force a deciding frame. Zhang took the lead with a 50 break, and went on to win the frame after Selby missed a tricky into the , claiming a 65 victory. By reaching his third career ranking final, which were all within the 2023–24 season, Zhang became the second Chinese player to make three ranking finals in a single season, since Ding in the 2013–14 season. Zhang commented: \"He's [Selby's] a top player and I needed to bring my best to win, which I did before the mid-session. I was chased all the way. We both knew the brown in the last frame was a pressure shot. He could have won by potting it, but it wasn't easy.\"\nFinal.\nThe final was contested between Allen and Zhang on 25 February as the best of 19 frames over two , with Jan Verhaas officiating. In the first session, Zhang won the 37-minute-long opening frame, then made breaks of 82 and 70 to lead 30. However, Allen took the next three to level the match at 33, making a 101 break in the sixth, the only century break of the match. Zhang took the lead again at 43, but Allen won the eighth frame on the last black to leave the scores even at 44 at the end of the session.\nThe first four frames of the second session were shared to level the match at 66 at the mid-session interval, as both players made multiple errors and struggled to win frames in a single . When play resumed, Zhang made a 30 break before inadvertently potting a red when into the of reds off of the , and Allen took the frame with a break of 64, the second of only two 50+ breaks he made in the match. Allen won the 14th frame on the last black, and the 16th on the last to lead 97. The 37-minute-long frame 17 went to Zhang, but Allen won the next to capture a 108 victory. It was Allen's second Players Championship title, his second ranking title of the season after the 2023 Shoot Out, and the 11th ranking title of his career. Allen commented: \"It was tough all day and with how well Zhang has played all week, I think I actually dragged him down a little bit. I gave it everything, my safety was good, it really kept me in the match. It wasn't a lot of fun to be involved in but I'm really happy to be standing here as the winner.\" He added: \"This is what I've always wanted to do. Picking up one tournament every two or three seasons wasn't where I wanted to be. I always wanted to be a consistent winner.\"\nTournament draw.\nNumbers in parentheses after the players' names denote the players' seedings, and players in bold denote match winners. All matches were played as the best of 11 frames except the final, which was played as the best of 19 frames.\nCentury breaks.\nA total of 21 century breaks were made in the tournament."
