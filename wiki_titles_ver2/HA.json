        "text": "Charles Ray Jefferson (born May 5, 1957) is a former American football defensive back who played for the Houston Oilers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at McNeese State University.\nJefferson was born on May 5, 1957, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He attended Capitol High School and is one of three of their alumni to play in the NFL. He began attending McNeese State University in 1975. As a sophomore in 1976, Jefferson helped McNeese win their first Southland Conference championship while reaching the Independence Bowl. He was the team leader and conference leader with seven interceptions on the season and placed seventh in the nation in that category, being a unanimous first-team choice on the all-conference team. He also received selection to the Louisiana Sports Writers Association All-Louisiana team.\nJefferson again led McNeese in interceptions in 1977 and was named second-team all-conference. As a senior, he led the team in interceptions, with six, for the third straight year and also led the conference in that category, being a unanimous first-team All-Southland choice. He ended his collegiate career with 19 interceptions, which ranked second in school history and in the top 10 all-time in state history as of 2014.\nSelected by the Denver Broncos in the fourth round (105th overall) of the 1979 NFL Draft, Jefferson was placed on injured reserve before the season began. He was waived in October and claimed off waivers by the Houston Oilers. He appeared in five regular season games as a backup and later played in the team's two playoff games, for seven combined appearances in the 1979 season. He became among the first 10 NFL alumni in McNeese history. Jefferson was placed on injured reserve to begin the 1980 season. He was waived prior to the 1981 season.\nJefferson was named in a poll to the Southland Conference 1970s All-Decade team in 2013 and one year later was inducted into the McNeese State Hall of Fame. He wrote a book on his life, titled \"Memoirs: The Legacy of a Professional Football Player\", in 2019."

The Hoosiers represent Indiana University Bloomington in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference.\nIndiana began competing at a varsity level in 1971, as an independent in the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), which was serving as the governing body for women's college sports at the time. Indiana joined the Big Ten Conference beginning with the 1982-83 season. The same year the Big Ten Conference began sponsoring women's basketball, the second year of the NCAA governing women's sports, and the first as the sole governing body, as the AIAW folded after the 1981-82 season.\nThe NCAA has recorded individual scoring and rebounding totals since it began sponsoring women's sports championships. However, it did not officially record the other statistics included in this page until later. Assists were first officially recorded in women's basketball in the 1985–86 season. Blocks and steals were first officially recorded in 1987–88. Nonetheless, Indiana's record books include players in these stats going back to the 1975-76 season, except for steals which it began tracking the following season.

Fogarty (November 18, 1918 – August 17, 1969) was an American football executive who served as the general manager of the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1951 until his death prior to the 1969 season.\nEarly life.\nFogarty was born on November 18, 1918, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the son of John Fogarty, the long-time head groundskeeper for Forbes Field, and had six siblings. He graduated from Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh and later attended Duquesne University. While at Duquesne, he played for the Duquesne Dukes ice hockey team. He later played hockey for a team in Wilkinsburg in the late 1940s.\nFogarty served in World War II as a lieutenant. He took part in the Normandy landings on D-Day but was wounded in the leg and captured as a prisoner by the Nazis. While being transported to a prisoner of war camp, Fogarty was able to escape and fought with the Free France resistance group before returning to his unit.\nExecutive career.\nFogarty began his affiliation with the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL) in 1946 after the war. He began as an auditor and bookkeeper with the team and also worked for the boxing club owned by Steelers founder Art Rooney and his friend. By early 1951, he had been promoted to assistant treasurer. The Steelers general manager John Holahan resigned in June 1951 and Fogarty, aged 32, became one of his replacements; initially manager tasks were divided between him, Ed Kiely (publicity director) and Joe Carr (ticket manager), with Ray Byrne also assisting in training camp. Fogarty was in charge of player affairs and contracts. The Steelers compiled a record of 4–7–1 in Fogarty's first year in the position.\nBy 1953, Fogarty had become official general manager of the team. He ultimately served 18 years as the general manager of the Steelers and became known as \"Art Rooney's right hand man\" – the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" noted that \"he knew more about the inner workings of the local football team than anyone around.\" Under his leadership, the Steelers had an overall record of 93–129–10, which included six seasons at .500 or better, and a best mark of 9–5 in 1962 for a second-place finish in their division.\nOutside of the Steelers, Fogarty also was known for his efforts to promote handball and hockey in the area; he served as the head coach of the Pittsburgh Knights, an all-star team in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Hockey Association.\nPersonal life and death.\nFogarty was married and had three children. He was a member of the American Legion, Loyal Order of Moose, North Side Elks and Pittsburgh Athletic Association.\nOn August 16, 1969, Fogarty attended the wedding ceremony of his daughter and went home after midnight complaining of chest pains. He suffered a heart attack shortly after and died at the Pittsburgh Hospital early on August 17, aged 50. Al Abrams of the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" commented that \"all of us lost a good friend and a fine gentleman ... Of all the people I have met in sports locally, there wasn't a nicer man than Fran Fogarty. Never did I hear him say an unkind word about anybody. His friendly grin and greetings will be missed as much as his ability to handle the bookkeeping duties.\""

        "title": "OUAA men's ice hockey tournament",
        "text": "The Ontario University Athletic Association ice hockey tournament was an annual conference championship held between member teams.\nHistory.\nAfter the realignment of the Quebec–Ontario Athletic Association, Ontario Intercollegiate Athletic Association and Ottawa-St. Lawrence Conference in 1971, the Ontario University Athletic Association was born. The league began with 14 teams arranged into four divisions .The inaugural postseason tournament invited eight teams with the top four from each division automatically qualifying for the playoffs. The quarterfinal matches were all played within the same division while the semifinals were played cross-division.\nThree division league.\nBeginning in 1976, the OUAA was divided into three divisions: East, Central and West. The inaugural tournament under this new arrangement was a convoluted affair. The top two teams from each division would make the tournament while the third place team with the best record would also be allowed entry. The team with the best record would receive a bye into the semifinal round, however, there was a slight issue. Because the teams played an unbalanced schedule with the central playing three games against division foes, the east four games and west five, the divisional records were not interchangeable. However, despite this, the OUAA still used the point system to determine the league champion rather than winning percentage. This resulted in Western Ontario receiving a bye while Toronto had the best overall record. The seeding was set up so that the two other division winners were placed in the same semifinal bracket. The two second-place teams with the worst record were set against one another and placed in the bracket with the team that received the bye. Of the remaining two teams, the one with the worst record was set against the second-best division winner. This convoluted process was abandoned after one season and replaced with another that was just as unfathomable. In 1977 the bye was eliminated and instead the best two third place teams would make the tournament. The third place teams were set against the second place teams from their own divisions in the quarterfinal round while the top two division winners were placed on opposite sides of the bracket. In order to reduce travel, the division that did not advance a third place team was separated so that they would play the nearest of the other division winners. This resulted in York and Ryerson (both located in Toronto) being set against one another in the quarterfinal round despite both being division champions. This rather unique arrangement persisted for three seasons before the loss of three conference members caused the league to revert to a single division with six teams making the postseason.\nOver the course of a decade, the OUAA began to shift from single-elimination rounds to best-of-three. 1978 saw the final round become a 3-game series with the semifinal following in 1980. It wasn't until the tournament was expanded back to an eight-team bracket in 1987 that the quarterfinal round became best-of-three as well. The following season, The QUAA collapsed and all four teams were absorbed into the OUAA. The league reverted to three divisions and expanded the playoffs to include twelve teams. The format was arranged so that the top four teams in each division would play in their respective division brackets. The winners would advance to the league semifinal along with the losing team with the best record. The first two rounds were best-of-three series while the final two were single-elimination. This setup lasted two years and was altered when McMaster suspended its program. Beginning in 1990, the OUAA switched to two divisions and alternated its postseason between 12- and 8-team formats. The additional first round series were single-elimination while the succeeding round remained best-of-three. Starting in 1992, the championship game was switched to single-elimination.\nFour division league.\nIn 1994, the two 8-team divisions were split and the league was now arranged into four 4-team divisions. The top three teams from each division made the postseason with the division champions advancing to the quarterfinal round. First and second round matches were all played within the divisions and the final four was arranged so that both the eastern and western halves would be represented in the championship game. In this format, only the quarterfinal round was best-of-three with all other round being single-elimination. The OUAA changes its name to Ontario University Athletics (OUA) in 1998.\nTournaments.\n1979.\n&lt;br&gt;\n1980.\n&lt;br&gt;\n1988.\n&lt;br&gt;\n1989.\n&lt;br&gt;\nReferences.\nMen's Hockey Champions"

The company Titan OY was founded in Tampere, Finland in 1966 by (1936–2021), and began by making alpine skis. Later in its first year of operations, Titan began manufacturing ice hockey sticks. Until the 1960s, hockey stick manufacturing was seen primarily as carpentry. Tiitola, an engineer by training, introduced science and technology to the design and production of sticks.\nIn 1972, Tiitola sold Titan OY to the sporting goods company Karhu, which then changed its name to Karhu-Titan. Karhu continued to manufacture Titan sticks, and then in 1979 transferred production to its partly-owned Canadian arm, Karhu-Titan Canada Ltd. That same year, Karhu signed a deal with Wayne Gretzky to use Titan sticks exclusively. The company made a specially-designed model for him that he used until 1990, at which point he switched to an Easton two-piece aluminium stick.\nIn 1998, Karhu Canada, which had been renamed the Sports Holdings Corporation, was purchased by SLM International, which was renamed The Hockey Company the following year. At this time, the Titan brand was mostly phased out. In 2004, Reebok purchased The Hockey Company, then in 2005, Reebok was purchased by Adidas. In 2017, Adidas sold all of its hockey operations, which were consolidated in the subsidiary Sport Maska Inc., to the private equity firm Birch Hill Equity Partners. Although Sport Maska's main brand is CCM, occasionally it makes retro sticks and apparel using the Titan name."

        "text": "Golf clubs, in the context of establishments, refer to venues that encompass golf courses and often additional facilities such as clubhouses, dining areas, pro shops, and golf practice ranges. These clubs can range from public access courses, where anyone can play for a fee, to private clubs with restricted membership and exclusive access.\nHistory.\nThe concept of golf clubs dates back to the 15th century in Scotland, with the establishment of the Old Course at St. Andrews in 1552 being one of the earliest known instances. The formal organization of golf clubs began in the 18th century, with The Royal Burgess Golfing Society which holds claim to being the oldest golf society in the world. Additionally, the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, founded in 1744, is also often cited as the oldest golf club. Initially, these clubs were exclusive gatherings of the elite, but over time, they evolved to cater to a broader segment of society.\nRole in golf development.\nGolf clubs play a crucial role in the social and professional development of the sport by providing venues for competition, fostering talent through access to high-quality coaching and junior programs, and contributing to the game's governance through adherence to rules and handicapping systems.\nTypes of clubs and memberships.\nGolf clubs are primarily categorized into private, semi-private, and public clubs.\nMembership models.\nMembership models vary widely among golf clubs, from equity memberships where members own a share of the club, to non-equity models where members pay fees for access without owning a stake. Some clubs offer lifetime memberships, while others operate on an annual renewal basis.

On the way to New Zealand, England will also play a match against Japan at the Japan National Stadium in Tokyo.\nThe tour was first reported by \"The Times\" in December 2022, shortly after England coach Eddie Jones was sacked and replaced by Steve Borthwick by the Rugby Football Union (RFU). Although Southern Hemisphere tours have typically been played on a three-test basis, as in the 2014 tour; the 2016 and 2022 tours of Australia; and the 2018 tour of South Africa, all Northern Hemisphere touring teams (with Scotland being an exception) returned to two-tests.\nThe tour will be the England's first tour since touring Australia in 2022, and their first tour of New Zealand since 2014. It is expected to be Steve Borthwick's first tour as coach of England. Borthwick was previously the England captain when they toured New Zealand in 2008, losing the series 2–0. It will also be the first set of fixtures for New Zealand's new coach, Scott Robertson."

        "title": "Billy Fitzgerald (lacrosse)",
        "text": "William James Fitzgerald (February 20, 1888 – June 30, 1926) was a Canadian field lacrosse player. He played professional lacrosse with the Toronto Lacrosse Club and Vancouver Lacrosse Club in the early 1900s, and was a member of Vancouver's 1911 Minto Cup-winning squad. Fitzgerald served as men's lacrosse coach at Hobart College, and later worked as a lacrosse referee. Canada's Sports Hall of Fame inducted Fitzgerald in 1961, and the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame honored him four years later.\nBiography.\nFitzgerald was born in St. Catharines, Ontario. In 1904, he started playing lacrosse as an offensive player. His \"Dictionary of Canadian Biography\" profile states that \"he often carried the ball, and was an excellent passer and shooter.\" Fitzgerald became a player on the St. Catharines Athletics, an amateur team, three years later. St. Catharines, the reigning amateur lacrosse champions in the province, went undefeated during Fitzgerald's time with the club, which lasted two seasons. The team was the Globe Shield champion in both of Fitzgerald's seasons with them.\nFitzgerald became a professional lacrosse player in 1909 and joined the Toronto Lacrosse Club. His exploits earned him recognition as far away as British Columbia, which led to Vancouver Lacrosse Club owner Con Jones attempting to sign Fitzgerald for the 1911 season. In an attempt to improve his club to make a run at a Minto Cup championship, Jones signed both Fitzgerald and Newsy Lalonde; Fitzgerald got a $5,000 contract. With Fitzgerald, Vancouver won the 1911 Minto Cup. In 14 appearances during the campaign, he tallied 15 goals. Following the season, Fitzgerald returned to the Toronto Lacrosse Club, as its contract offer exceeded the best one made by Jones. Having promised to beat out Vancouver by $500, Toronto paid $4,000 for Fitzgerald's services in 1912.\nAfter one year with Toronto, Fitzgerald was again a target of Jones, who made Toronto a $1,000 offer for his rights. However, Fitzgerald had starting building houses in St. Catharines as a carpenter, and decided to skip the 1913 season due to high building demand in the town. Fitzgerald returned to the Toronto club in 1914, although World War I affected the sport in Canada. Fitzgerald briefly returned to western Canada to play again for Vancouver Lacrosse Club in three games, scoring five goals. That year, he accepted a position in the United States as head coach of the Hobart College lacrosse team. When Fitzgerald sought to re-enter the U.S. for the 1916 season, he was initially denied entry into the country, but Hobart won an appeal. After a period in which he played semi-professionally in St. Catharines, Fitzgerald competed for a professional team in Cornwall, Ontario, in 1919. In later years, he worked as a coach and referee in St. Catharines, and with multiple college teams. Professional lacrosse entered a period of declining popularity, and Fitzgerald found himself unable to take part in local amateur competition, having competed as a professional for years. He did play in 1921 for the Victoria Capitols and in 1924 for the Vancouver Terminals, scoring a combined eight goals in nine appearances.\nFitzgerald had a surgical procedure to remove gallstones in June 1926, and came down with peritonitis, which caused his death on June 30 at the age of 38. In 1950, Canadian writers participated in a vote to choose the country's best lacrosse player of the century to that point. Fitzgerald placed second in the balloting, behind Lalonde. Canada's Sports Hall of Fame inducted him in 1961. The Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame honored him in 1965 as a founding member."

In the 2022–23 season, he scored 11 tries as Jersey won the Championship title for the first time in their history – including a try in the decisive 43–15 win against Ampthill.\nOn 29 September 2023, Hadfield was made redundant, along with the rest of the Jersey Reds playing squad and staff, after the club ceased trading and went into administration. However, a week later, he found a new club, signing for reigning Premiership champions Saracens – initially on a short-term deal, which was later extended until the end of the 2023–24 season. Hadfield made his Premiership debut away at Exeter Chiefs in October 2023, while his first Premiership tries arrived in the reverse fixture against Exeter in January 2024, when he scored a brace on the way to a 40–22 victory."

He returned to the field as a senior in 2002 where ran for 1,194 yards and 11 touchdowns, making him the only player in Conference USA history to rush for 1,000 yards in three seasons.

He finished just 12 yards away from the program rushing record. Nix received a kidney transplant from his brother Marcus in 2003 and sued Pfizer. and Merck &amp; Co, the makers of the anti-inflammation drugs that caused his kidney disease.

He was a five-time Canadian university (\"CIAU\") First Team All-Canadian, the only player in Canadian university basketball history to achieve this feat. In the 1985–86 season, he was named the CIAU's player of the year and in this year, lead the CIAU in scoring with 27.2 ppg. He was named the Great Plains Athletic Conference (\"GPAC\") player of the year four consecutive years (1983-1986); was a five-time GPAC All-Star; and in the 1986–87 season, he led the GPAC in scoring with 23.3 ppg. In the 1986–87 season, he led Brandon University to its first basketball national championship and in this year, was named the CIAU National Tournament MVP. He finished his university career with 4,259 points and 1,179 rebounds. After university, he enjoyed a successful professional career in Ireland and in the World Basketball League with the Calgary 88's and Saskatoon Slam.\nCarson has been inducted into the Canada West Hall of Fame, Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame, Manitoba Basketball Hall of Fame, and Brandon University Sports Hall of Fame.\nUniversity career.\nCarson played for the Brandon University Bobcats from 1982 to 1987. He was named a five-time First Team CIAU All-Canadian, the only athlete in Canadian university basketball history to achieve this accomplishment. For context, only one other athlete in Canadian basketball university history, David Coulthard, was a five-time All-Canadian; however, Coulthard's first All-Canadian award was to the Second Team. Further, besides Carson and Coulthard, only four other athletes were four-time First Team All-Canadians: Karl Tilleman, John Stiefelmeyer, Charles Fortier and Philip Scrubb.\nIn the 1985–96 season, Carson was awarded the CIAU's Mike Moser award as the nation's player of the year. He was the first of only three Brandon Bobcats to receive the award. That year, Carson led the CIAU in scoring with a 27.2 ppg average.\nIn his senior season in 1987, Carson led the Bobcats to win the program's first national championship. This was also only the second time in which a team from Manitoba won the national championship, the first being the Manitoba Bisons in 1976 led by Martin Riley. Carson played an \"instrumental role\" in the Bobcats qualifying for the CIAU tournament that year; he scored 34 points in the GPAC championship game, resulting in a win for Brandon and subsequent qualification for the national tournament.\nIn this 1987 national championship game, which was also the final game of Carson's university career, Carson finished with a game-high 38 points along with a steal and an \"emphatic dunk\" in the closing seconds. This championship game was also historic in that it was the first time in CIAU basketball history in which a team started five black players in the national championship game. This year, Carson was named the CIAU tournament MVP. This was the second time Carson was named to the CIAU Tournament All-Star team, the first being in 1984.\nAdditionally, Carson was named the GPAC Player of the Year four consecutive seasons (1983-1986). He was named a GPAC All-Star all five seasons of his university career. In the 1986–87 season, Carson was the GPAC scoring champion with a 23.3 ppg average.\nCarson finished his university career with 4,259 career points and 1,179 rebounds. Throughout all of the different tournaments in which he competed as a Bobcat, Carson was named as a tournament all-star 21 times and tournament MVP 11 times.\nProfessional career.\nAfter his university career, Carson enjoyed a successful professional career in Ireland and in the World Basketball League with the Calgary 88's and the Saskatoon Slam.\nPost-career Awards.\nCarson was inducted into the Canada West Hall of Fame in its first induction class (2019); the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame (2007); the Manitoba Basketball Hall of Fame (2001); the Brandon University Sports Hall of Fame (1996); and has been nominated to the Canada Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1986, the university retired his number 42, being the first Bobcat player to have his uniform retired.\nIn addition to his personal hall of fame inductions, his 1987 Bobcats team, along with the 1988 and 1989 Bobcats teams after his graduation, were inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame (2019); the Manitoba Basketball Hall of Fame (2005); and the Brandon University Sports Hall of Fame (2014).\nPersonal life.\nCarson was born on September 20, 1959. He is originally from Huntsville, North Carolina, USA. Carson later settled in Calgary and returns to Brandon often to partake in alumni games and support the Bobcat program by being involved in youth camps and homecoming events."

McGill, Queen's and Toronto arranged to play one another on a consistent annual basis to determine which among them was the best college team. At the time, all three continued to participate in other senior leagues but this was the first formal differentiation for college programs. At the start of the conference, a provision was made for a playoff to determine the conference champions but only if there was a tie at the top of the standings. The Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (CIAU) continued as a three-team circuit for several years until Laval–Montreal joined in 1907. A year later, the league was one of the circuits that was allowed to participate for the inaugural Allan Cup, which was eventually won by Queen's.\nThe first time the playoffs were needed was in 1910 when three teams tied for the league title. Ottawa was selected to host the games as it was a neutral site, however, not every team was accepting of the situation. Because it was a three-way tie, two teams were required to play in a semifinal match. Despite having the greatest number of goals scored and the widest margin of victory during regular season play, Toronto was set to play McGill while Queen's, the defending champion, received a bye to the final. Toronto protested this decision and withdrew from competition. Queen's then defeated McGill to win the first conference tournament in league history. In 1911, after the addition of a 5th league member, the conference split itself into divisions. The English-speaking teams (group 1) continued to play their season schedule to determine the best of the three. The two French-speaking teams (group 2) played two games against one another to determine their champion. The winner of the two groups would then meet for the championship, establishing a planned postseason for the first time.\nAfter two years, both French-speaking schools discontinued their programs and the league returned to its previous structure; a three-team league with a playoff used when needed. In 1915, due to the outbreak of World War I, the league suspended play until 1919. Once the war was over, all three teams returned to the league and it continued as it had immediately before the conflict. The league continued apace for most of the 1920s, however, 1928 saw the CIAU undergo a drastic change. Prior to the season, Queen's left the league due to financial constraints. Even with the reduced schedule and travel, Montreal experience problems during the season and saw only about 50 people attend its last home game. Montreal would leave after the year dropping league membership down to just 2 teams. The 2-team conference persisted for four years before Montreal rejoined the league in 1932 but they withdrew once more the following season. One year on, Queen's returned to the conference but that too lasted for just one season. In 1936 both Montreal and Queen's rejoined the league and, to help the financial situation, the four team entered into a partnership with the Quadrangular League where four Ivy League schools from America would play each Canadian school once per season. While the initial returns were good, attendance figured for the international games soon fell off and Montreal withdrew from the circuit in 1939. The International arrangement ended the next season when all of the Canadian programs suspended play due to World War II and was not continued after the war.\nCollegiate only.\nSometime between 1953 and 1955, the league changed its name from CIAU to QOAA (Quebec-Ontario Athletic Association). This was also the time when most Canadian colleges ended their senior-level play and focused solely on playing other colleges. The QOAA didn't seem to take much notice, as their membership and scheduling didn't change, for the next several years. Queen's briefly returned in 1960 but the conference saw its biggest change yet two seasons later. 1962 brought four new colleges to the league, swelling its ranks to eight teams. The QUAA divided itself into east and west divisions but geography had little bearing on the allocation. The original 4 teams were all placed in the East division while the newer teams found themselves in the west. This situation lasted for two seasons before Ontario Agricultural ended its program as the college was being merged into the University of Guelph. The year off saw the QOAA abandon the division format and, since each team played the others twice during the season, no playoff was used for 1964. Curiously, Toronto, as conference champion, declined to participate in the national tournament, which was in its second year of existence that season, and the bid was instead given to Montreal. The following year, Guelph joined the conference along with Western Ontario. While the conference remained one division, a 4-team playoff was instituted. However, prior to the start of the postseason, all four school indicated that they did not want to participate in the national tournament and the conference did not send a representative in 1965. In 1966 the conference did not hold a postseason tournament but the member schools did drop their opposition to taking part in the University Cup. The next season, with enough lead time, the QOAA tournament returned.\nIn 1968, with the addition of three more schools, the conference was once more split into two divisions. The playoff was rearranged so that the winners of each division would play the second place team of the opposing division in the semifinals. The conference and format remained unchanged for the next 5 years. In 1971, a sizable shit occurred where the three conferences that spanned Ontario and Quebec were rearranged along provincial lines. The new conferences were the Ontario University Athletic Association and the Quebec University Athletic Association.\nTournaments.\n1903.\n\"no playoff\"\n1904.\n\"no playoff\"\n1905.\n\"no playoff\"\n1906.\n\"no playoff\"\n1907.\n\"no playoff\"\n1908.\n\"no playoff\"\n1909.\n\"no playoff\"\n1910.\n&lt;br&gt;\n1913.\n\"no playoff\"\n1914.\n\"no playoff\"\n1915.\n\"no playoff\"\n1916–1919.\n\"League suspended due to World War I\"\n1921.\n\"no playoff\"\n1922.\n\"no playoff\"\n1923.\n\"no playoff\"\n1924.\n\"no playoff\"\n1925.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"no playoff\"\n1926.\n\"no playoff\"\n1928.\n\"no playoff\"\n1933.\n\"no playoff\"\n1935.\n\"no playoff\"\n1937.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"no playoff\"\n1938.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"no playoff\"\n1939.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"no playoff\"\n1940.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"no playoff\"\n1941–1945.\n\"League suspended due to World War II\"\n1948.\n\"no playoff\"\n1949.\n\"no playoff\"\n1950.\n\"no playoff\"\n1951.\n\"no playoff\"\n1952.\n\"no playoff\"\n1953.\n\"no playoff\"\n1954.\n\"no playoff\"\n1955.\n\"no playoff\"\n1956.\n\"no playoff\"\n1957.\n\"no playoff\"\n1958.\n\"no playoff\"\n1959.\n\"no playoff\"\n1960.\n\"no playoff\"\n1961.\n\"no playoff\"\n1964.\n\"no playoff\"\n1966.\n\"no playoff\"\nReferences.\nMen's Hockey Champions"

By 1988, he was appointed as vice president for finance and worked under general manager Russ Thomas. In December 1989, Thomas announced his retirement and Schmidt was appointed in a new joint position of executive vice president and chief operating officer. Vice president of player personnel Jerry Vainisi was speculated to succeed Thomas, but they fell out over the course of the season, resulting in Schmidt's promotion. Because of his lack of football experience, Schmidt was not considered a general manager, so the Lions allowed their head coaches to run football operations during his tenure.\nSchmidt's position with the Lions coincided with the rise of running back Barry Sanders. However, the Lions struggled to find a franchise quarterback to accompany Sanders, despite drafting Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware in the first round, who ended up as a third-string behind Rodney Peete and Erik Kramer. In back-to-back off-seasons, Schmidt passed on Joe Montana and Warren Moon, perceiving them to be too old; Montana continued his career with the Kansas City Chiefs, while Moon's career lasted until 2000. Schmidt instead opted for free agent Scott Mitchell, who had backed up Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins, but his time in Detroit is considered to be largely unsuccessful. In January 2001, Schmidt resigned from his role with the Lions, a day after Matt Millen was announced as the new general manager. In his ten seasons as executive vice president, the Lions made the playoffs on six occasions but never made it to the Super Bowl, coming up short in the .\nIn 2006, Schmidt joined the Baker Group, a financial planning company based in Southfield, Michigan. He currently serves as vice president and heads the company's Western Florida Office."

        "text": "Olympic gold medals for alpinism were awarded in conjunction with Olympic Games in 1924, 1932 and 1936 for the greatest mountaineering achievement within the four preceding years.\nHistory.\nMedals for feats of alpinism were initially floated as part of the first Olympic Congress in 1894, where it was suggested by the committee tasked with drawing up a list of sports. A prize for alpinism (as well as game hunting) was considered for the 1912 Olympic Games, but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided against it for several reasons, including practicability, risk to human life and the lack of an exceptional feat of alpinism between 1908 and 1911.\nThe first alpinism medals, in 1924, were given to the members of the unsuccessful 1922 British Mount Everest expedition led by Charles Granville Bruce. They were given out at the closing ceremony of the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, but bore the inscription of the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. 21 people: the thirteen British expedition members, seven Sherpas who died during the ascent and one Nepalese soldier (Tejbir Bura) were awarded medals. There is some doubt as to whether all awardees, or the Sherpas' families, received them.\nAfter no medals were given out in 1928, the 1932 prize was awarded to German brothers and for being the first people to ascend the northern wall of the Matterhorn on August 1, 1931. Toni died on May 16, 1932 while attempting to climb the Wiesbachhorn, but Franz and his father accepted medals on behalf of both brothers in a ceremony on September 5, 1932.\nIn 1936, medals were given to Swiss-German climber Günter Dyhrenfurth and his wife Hettie for \"a series of remarkable ascents and scientific expeditions in the Himalayas\". According to Olympic rules, only single performances could be considered, so the award was \"de facto\" for the pair's 1934 expedition, in which Hettie broke the women's altitude record by climbing 7313 meters. Despite the 1936 Summer Olympics being held in Berlin, Hettie being Jewish, and the pair having left Germany due to Adolf Hitler's rise to power, the German members of the IOC did not file any objections. Günter, who was also one-quarter Jewish, traveled alone to Berlin to accept the award during the 1936 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. The Dyhrenfurths were nonetheless left out of the Official Report of the Games, which caused Günter to send a letter of protest to the publisher.\nThe IOC agreed to end the prize for alpinism in 1946, following a request from the Swiss. In 1988, the Olympic Order was presented to Reinhold Messner and Jerzy Kukuczka, the first two people to climb all fourteen eight-thousanders. Messner declined the award, citing mountaineering as a creative activity and not a competition, while Kukczka accepted it, though simultaneously distinguished it from a real Olympic medal.\nMedal table.\nThe award from 1924 could be characterized either as for Great Britain or a mixed team (since the expedition was British-led, but some recipients were Indian or Nepalese). These medals are regardless not considered by the IOC to be equivalent to regular Olympic medals."

        "text": "Kate Martin is an American professional basketball player for the Las Vegas Aces of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). She played college basketball at Iowa.\nEarly life.\nMartin was born on June 5, 2000, and grew up in Granite City and Edwardsville, Illinois. She is the youngest of three children born to teachers, Matt and Jill Martin. Since the age of five, she attended summer basketball camps at University of Iowa, hanging out with the players, coaches, and staff.&lt;ref name=\"verbal com/coach J\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up, Martin slept with an Iowa women's basketball poster above her childhood bed. She started playing basketball at age five, participating in local recreational leagues and playing pickup at the YMCA. Martin also played tackle football in elementary school and later took up volleyball. Her dad was one of her first coaches, coaching her and her siblings' basketball teams up until the 7th grade as well as Martin's 4th grade football team. In middle school, Martin began attending “Junior Hawk” and Iowa basketball camps every summer as a participant. In fourth grade, Martin joined her local Amateur Athletic Union basketball program and would go on to play for the Blue Star St. Louis (now known as the Napheesa Collier Elite) throughout high school. In seventh grade, Martin led her basketball team to the 2012 Illinois Elementary School Association (IESA) Class 4A state championship game, losing by 3 points in the final. That same year, she helped her middle school volleyball team win the 2013 seventh-grade IESA Class 4A state championship in straight sets. The following year, her basketball team would claim victory at the 2013 eighth grade IESA Class 4A state championship, finishing with an undefeated 28-0 season, while her volleyball team would place third at the 2014 eighth grade state championship.\nHigh school career.\nMartin played four years of varsity basketball for Edwardsville High School in Edwardsville, Illinois, under head coach, Lori Blade. During her freshman season, Edwardsville went 30-1, winning the Southwestern Conference (SWC), regional, and sectional titles before falling to the eventual state champions, Benet Academy (and Martin's future Iowa teammate, Kathleen Doyle), in the Class 4A state quarterfinals. As a freshman, she did not see many minutes on the court, coming in off the bench and averaging 6.6 points and 3.4 rebounds per game. Her game continued to mature, and she made herself into a guaranteed starter for her remaining 3 years at Edwardsville. During her sophomore year in postseason play, Martin helped Edwardsville defeat Rock Island High School in the sectional championship by holding their freshman guard, Brea Beal, pointless in the first quarter. Despite Martin's 13-point contribution in the game, her team would suffer a second straight state quarterfinal loss to Benet Academy, the eventual back-to-back 2016 state champions. Martin earned Class 4A All-State fourth-team accolades from the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association (IBCA).\nAs a junior, Martin surpassed 1,000 career points and averaged 12.9 points, 5.2 rebounds, 2.9 assists, and 2.7 steals per game. The number 1 ranked Edwardsville team finished their 2016-17 season with a 32–1 record, reaching the Class 4A state championship final where they were upset by Geneva Community High School, losing 41-40 with a last-second shot. Martin was named to the IBCA All-State Class 4A second-team and was selected as an Associated Press (AP) All-State honorable mention at the conclusion of her junior season. As a senior, Martin averaged 16.2 points, 5.9 rebounds, 2.88 assists, and 2.13 steals per game with 63.9 field-goal, 50.9 three-point, and 80 free-throw percentages. As team captain, Martin led the number 1 ranked Edwardsville team to their fourth consecutive SWC, regional, and sectional titles, and their second consecutive super-sectional championship title. Her team finished the 2017-18 season with a 30–2 record and reached their second consecutive Class 4A semifinal, ultimately finishing fourth in post-season tournament play. At the end of her senior year, Martin's class finished with an overall record of 122-6, going undefeated at home all four years. Martin led her team with the most points, rebounds, and assists during her senior season and ended her high school basketball career with the fourth-most points (1,518) in Edwardsville High School history. She received the 5th most votes for Illinois Miss Basketball 2018 award (losing the honor to Beal) and was named to both the Associated Press and the IBCA Class 4A All-State first-teams as a senior.\nMartin also played 4 years of varsity volleyball as an outside hitter at Edwardsville. She helped lead her team to 108 wins, 2 SWC titles, 2 regional championships, and a sectional championship. She finished her high school volleyball career with a new school record for career block assists (194) and was also named to the All-SWC first-team her senior year.\nRecruiting.\nMartin was first recruited by NCAA Division I basketball programs during her sophomore year of high school, receiving an offer from Bradley. During her high school career, she also received offers from DePaul, Illinois, St. Louis, and Wisconsin. During her junior year, she was recruited by Iowa as a 2-3 (shooting guard/small forward). On her car ride home from her official weekend visit at Iowa, Martin called the coaching staff and verbally committed to the Hawkeyes. She announced this verbal commitment on Twitter in May 2017. Martin formally signed her letter of intent in November 2017 and received a full athletic scholarship from the university. By the end of her high school career, Martin was considered a three-star recruit with a scouting grade of 90 by ESPN. In interviews, Martin has stated playing for Iowa was, \"always the goal\" and that committing to play there was \"a no-brainer.\" In sixth grade for an English assignment, she wrote a letter for her future self to be opened after graduating high school in which she wrote, \"Hi Kate. When you're reading this, I hope you have committed to play basketball at the University of Iowa.\"\nCollege career.\nMartin redshirted her first season at Iowa in 2018–19 due to an ACL tear. After playing limited time in 2019–20 while still recovering, she began starting and became team captain in 2020–21. She received the nickname \"the Glue\" for her leadership and versatility. She won the Iowa Big Ten Sportsmanship Award every year from 2021 to 2023. She helped Iowa reach the 2023 NCAA championship game in her fifth year. She recorded seven points, seven rebounds, and two assists in Iowa's upset of South Carolina in the semifinals.\nProfessional career.\nWNBA.\nAfter completing her final season of eligibility with Iowa, Martin declared for the 2024 WNBA draft. Martin attended the ceremony in Brooklyn, New York in support of her former Iowa teammate, Caitlin Clark, being selected as the first pick overall in the draft. From the audience, Martin was selected in the second round as the eighteenth overall pick of the 2024 WNBA draft by the Las Vegas Aces.\nOn April 22, 2024, Martin was signed to the Aces' rookie scale contract.\nOff the court.\nPersonal life.\nMartin's father, Matt Martin, played college football at Western Illinois University. She has an older sister, Kennedy, who played basketball at Truman State, and an older brother, Trevor. Martin's maternal aunt, Julie Fitzpatrick, is married to Iowa assistant coach, Jan Jensen.\nMany of Martin's aunts and uncles are former college athletes: Julie Fitzpatrick played basketball for Drake (scoring over 1700 career points), Tom Fitzpatrick played football for Drake, Matt Fitzpatrick played basketball for St. Ambrose, and Mitch Martin played football for Western Illinois.

        "title": "List of Detroit Lions Pro Bowl selections",
        "text": "The Detroit Lions are a professional American football team based in Detroit, Michigan. The Lions compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the North Divison of the National Football Conference (NFC). The franchise was founded in Portsmouth, Ohio, as the Portsmouth Spartans and joined the NFL on July 12, 1930. After being purchased by George A. Richards in 1934, the franchise was relocated to Detroit and renamed to the Detroit Lions in reference to the city's Major League Baseball franchise, the Detroit Tigers. The team plays its home games at Ford Field in Downtown Detroit.\nStarting with the 1938 NFL season, the NFL instituted an All-Star Game that pitted the league's championship team against a team made-up of the best players from the remaining teams. Five of these exhibition games were played, with the last occurring after the 1942 NFL season before the NFL reduced the number of teams and games in the season due to players serving in World War II. The first official Pro Bowl occurred in 1951 following the 1950 NFL season. From the 1950 season until the 1969 season, the exhibition game was played between teams representing the Eastern and Western Conferences of the NFL. After the American Football League (AFL) merged with the NFL in 1970, the game was played between teams representing the NFC and the American Football Conference (AFC). The conference team format remained until 2014 when the NFL shifted to a fantasy football format with teams selected by captains from the full pool of Pro Bowl selectees. This format only lasted for three seasons before it reverted back to the conference team format from the 2016 to 2021 NFL seasons; this period included the cancellation of the 2021 Pro Bowl due to the COVID-19 pandemic (teams were still selected and players were still recognized as Pro Bowl selectees). Starting with the 2023 Pro Bowl after the 2022 NFL season, the NFL again changed the format; instead of playing an exhibition game, the Pro Bowl was converted to series of skill competitions that culminated in a non-contact flag football game.\nPro Bowl selections are made by a cumulative vote by three groups that hold equal weight: coaches, players and fans. Based on the results of the vote, each team is filled out based on generic positions on offense, defense and special teams. Prior to the institution of the Pro Bowl Games in 2023, the players with the most votes were named starters, while the remainder of the selectees were reserves. In the event that a Pro Bowl selectee is unable to participate in the Pro Bowl, either due to health reasons or the fact they are playing in the Super Bowl right after the Pro Bowl, alternates are named in the players' place. These players are still considered official Pro Bowl selectees. The coaching staffs for each team have been selected in various ways, with the common option being the coaching staffs of the team with the best record in each conference who were not going to the Super Bowl given the honors. With the onset of the Pro Bowl Games, the NFL now selects the coaching staffs for the flag football game. Players for each team are paid for their participation, with a higher sum going to the winning team. Throughout the life of the Pro Bowl, awards have been given out to recognize the best player or players of the game. From 2016 to 2022, an award was given to an offensive and defensive most valuable player (MVP).\nThe Lions have had representatives at the Pro Bowl every year since 1950 except for nine seasons. The Lions first selections in the inaugural Pro Bowl in 1951 were Cloyce Box, Lou Creekmur, Don Doll, Thurman McGraw, and Doak Walker. Linebacker Joe Schmidt and running back Barry Sanders are tied for the team record for most Pro Bowl selections with 10, while Yale Lary (nine selections), and Lou Creekmur (eight selections) round out the top four. Four Lions have been given a Pro Bowl MVP award. The most recent Pro Bowl selections for the Lions were Jahmyr Gibbs, Aidan Hutchinson, Sam LaPorta, Frank Ragnow, Jalen Reeves-Maybin, Penei Sewell, and Amon-Ra St. Brown for the 2024 Pro Bowl Games."

The match was the first Challenge Cup to be played in the super cup format as a one-off game, contested by the winners of the previous season's NWSL Championship and NWSL Shield. It featured NJ/NY Gotham FC, champions of the 2023 National Women's Soccer League, and San Diego Wave FC, winners of the 2023 NWSL Shield. The match was played on March 15, 2024, and was hosted by Gotham FC at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey. The match was acted as an curtain raiser to the 2024 season, and was broadcast on Amazon Prime Video, marking the start of the platform's coverage of the NWSL.\nThe San Diego Wave defeated Gotham 1–0, with an Alex Morgan goal in the 88th minute.\nBackground.\nThe NWSL Challenge Cup was created as a league cup tournament in 2020 as a return to competition after the 2020 NWSL regular season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The competition was successful enough to be brought back in 2021, though played prior to the start of the NWSL's regular season. This format continued in 2022, but was changed in 2023 to take place during the league's regular season. However, with more regular season matches taking place due to the league being expanded from 12 to 14 teams in 2024, the NWSL decided to scrap the league cup format. Instead, the competition was reformatted to be a one-off super cup match, to be contested by the winners of the NWSL Championship and NWSL Shield from the previous season. Should the same team win the NWSL Shield and Championship, the fixture will be a rematch of the previous NWSL Championship. The game will act as an opener to the league season, played the day prior to the first regular season matches.\nThe competition will continue to be sponsored by UKG. The company will award $3,500 in prize money to each player of the winning team, while each player of the losing team will receive $2,200. The most valuable player will be awarded an additional $2,000.\nMatch.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "title": "German Gymnastics Federation",
        "text": "The German Gymnastics Federation (official German name: (DTB)) is the umbrella organization of the German gymnastics associations and clubs. \nHistory.\nThe DTB was founded in 1848 at the first German gymnastics day in Hanau. The first German gymnastics festival was held 1860 in Coburg. In 1868, the DTB was changed into the German gymnasts ( (DT)). Additionally, the social-democratic working gymnastics association (Arbeiterturnerbund (ATB)) was founded in 1893, which was renamed to be the working gymnastics and sport association ( (ATSB)) in 1919, and was later forbidden during the Nazism in Germany. In 1933, the DT tried to become another part in the sphere of the Nazi Party, alongside the already existing \"Sturmabteilung\", a paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party. The DT could not be established, however, because it did not claim high-performance sport as its main goal thus interfering with the Nazi Party's requirements of dominance of the best males through sports. The DT was dismissed in 1935 because of the \"Gleichschaltung\" of the Nazi Party. After World War II, on 13 September 1947, the first unofficial German Championship in Artistic gymnastics was held in Northeim. At this event the working committee of German gymnastics ( (DAT)) was founded, which paved the way for the re-establishment of the DTB in Tübingen. In 1952, the DTB already had 900,000 members participating in more than 6100 sport clubs. The first German gymnastics festival () took place in 1953 in Hamburg.\nIn 2005, the first international German gymnastics festival was held in Berlin. The next one was 2009 in Frankfurt am Main, followed by the third one 2013 in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region. In 2017, it took place in Berlin again, with the slogan “how colorful is that”.\nIn 2003, the DTB organized the Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships in Hannover (16. – 19. of October). Four years later, the EnBW gymnastic world championships were held in Stuttgart (1. – 9. of September). In 2010, the Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships were organized by the DTB in Bremen (15. – 18. of April) followed by the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships one year later in Berlin (4. – 10. of April). The next big event following were the Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championships held 2015 in Stuttgart. The most recent big events organized by the DTB were the 2019 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Stuttgart, and the 2022 European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Munich as part of the 2022 European Championships. \nThe first gold medal in an international world championship competition for the DTB was won by the German national team at the Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships 1986 in Paris. This success was repeated in 2001. Pauline Schäfer-Betz won the first single event gold medal for the DTB on balance beam at the 2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Montreal. This made her the second German woman to win a single-event gold medal at an international competition after Maxi Gnauck, who won the gold medal on uneven bars for the GDR at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\nOrganisation.\nThe DTB is a registered association, which is led by a committee of 10 people. Since 2016, Dr. Alfons Hölzl has been taking over as president of this association, making him the successor of Rainer Brechtken. The administrative office is in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.\nBesides the federal committee, the DTB is split up in 22 regional member associations, 20 of which are gymnastics associations. North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria each have more than one association.\nThe Academic gymnastics association ( (ATB)) and the Bavarian gymnastics and playing association are special members of the DTB.\nThe German gymnastics federation is regionally structured in smaller gymnastic districts, counties, and regions. On a national level, it is part of the German Olympic Sports Confederation because of its function as an umbrella Organisation. Internationally, the DTB is a member of the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and a founding member of the European Gymnastics (UEG), existing since 1982.\nGuidelines.\nIn 2004, at the national gymnastics day in Berlin, the DTB published its guidelines which is a statement of the focus of its work:\nBased on these guidelines, the DTB tries to standardize its work as sports federation while focusing on these main goals and interests. A result of this standardization that can already be seen in the newly developed categories children's gymnastics, \"Gymwelt\" (gymnastics world), and \"Turnen!\" (gymnastics).\nOrganisations of the German Gymnastics Federation.\nGerman gymnastics festival club.\nOne of the main responsibilities of the DTB is the organisation of gymnastic festivals. The German gymnastic festivals include around 100,000 participants and was additionally made an international event in 2005. The international version of the German gymnastics festival is the biggest competitional and popular sports event worldwide. To facilitate the administration of the gymnastics festival, the DTB created the German gymnastic festival club, which is a registered association whose function is the organization of those events. \nThe last international German gymnastics festival was held 2017 in Berlin (3. – 10. July). There was supposed to be another one in 2021, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next international German gymnastics festival will be held 2025 in Leipzig.\nGerman youth gymnastics.\nThe German youth gymnastics ( (DTJ)) is the youth organisation of the DTB. The DTJ is one of the biggest youth organisations in Germany, including over 2 million members.\nThe guidelines the DTJ is following are:\nQuality certificates.\nIn 1994, the German Gymnastics Federation created the quality certificate \"Pluspunkt Gesundheit.DTB\". This certificate was created to honor high-quality health programs. To be awarded with this certificate, certain criteria need to be met.\nControversies.\nCoach Gabriele Frehse was accused of physical and emotional abuse and abuse of power, a process which is known as the (gymnastic scandal of Chemnitz)."

        "text": "The Indonesian Basketball League awards a championship trophy (or cup) to the winning team at the end of each year (league).\nThe most recent team that won the championship in the 2023 season is Prawira Bandung. After they last won a championship in the year 1998 beating Aspac Jakarta 55-45, precisely 25 years ago.\nHistory.\nIndonesia Muda and Halim Kediri (Early Years).\nIndonesia Muda (IM) was the team to win the championship in the first year of Kobatama, making they're team a powerhouse in the early years of the league. Halim Kediri was their main rival.\nASABA Jakarta (Start of a Dynasty).\nBut the rivals changed as ASABA Jakarta was founded. A club that would later change names to Aspac Jakarta and then Stapac Jakarta, gained attention to these teams. ASABA went on to being the best team in 1988 and 1989 season.\nPelita Jaya (The Bakrie Team).\nBut then Pelita Jaya Jakarta came to the map, and they successfully won championships three years in a row, which is 1990 till 1992. But after that, ASABA went on to stop them being the champions in the 1993 season.\nPanasia Indosytec Bandung (First Appearance).\nPanasia Indosytec Bandung went on winning championships in the 1994, 1997, and 1998 season. And Aspac on 1995 and 1996.\nSatria Muda (Erick Thohir).\nIn 1999, Satria Muda Jakarta appeared that was bought by Erick Thohir from Dudi Gambiro. And later on went to winning the championship on the same year.\nInterestingly enough, Satria Muda Jakarta won that championship even after having a bad season in 1998.\nAspac then won the Kobatama in 2000 till 2002. But, Satria Muda was the main competitor playing against them in the 2001 and 2002 Final.\nThe IBL Era.\nAfter the Kobatama era ended, in 2002, there is a strong desire among Indonesian basketball people to form a more independent and professional league.\nThen, in 2003, Indonesian Basketball League (IBL) was born. This is the first time that the management of the basketball competition has been handed over to an independent operator.\nAspac then, won the championship in some IBL edition. After doing so in 2003, the club won the trophy again in 2005 after losing to Satria Muda in the 2004 final.\nAfter 2005, Satria Muda was unstoppable. They were able to become champions in the 2006 to 2009 edition and Aspac remained the main challenger.\nOnly Panasia's reincarnated club, Garuda Bandung, is able to disrupt the dualism of Satria Muda and Aspac. Having a line of great players such as Kelly Purwanto, I Made “Lolik” Sudiadnyana, Denny Sumargo, and others, they challenged Satria Muda in the final, even though they ultimately lost.\nDBL Era.\nOverall, the IBL era went poorly to the point that changing operators was considered normal. The excitement of the competition has waned in recent years.\nFinally, 10 participating clubs came to the company that usually organizes inter-high school basketball competitions, PT Deteksi Basket Lintas (DBL) Indonesia. The club believes that DBL Indonesia can revive the passion for Indonesian basketball competitions. The reason is, they are able to turn competition between schools into an industry.\nDBL Indonesia also agreed to take over the competition. Then, they rebranded and changed the name of the competition from IBL to NBL Indonesia. Indonesian basketball fans call the Indonesian NBL era the most beautiful period in the history of Indonesian basketball competitions.\nThe audience's enthusiasm returned to the Kobatama era and the early years of IBL. The clubs that qualified for the final were more varied, as the number of participants increased to 12. The final between Satria Muda and Aspac has only occurred twice in the Indonesian NBL, respectively in 2011-2012 and 2013-2014.\nCLS Knights Indonesia and Pelita Jaya succeeded in disrupting the dominance of these two clubs. CLS reached the final of the 2011-2012 NBL, while Pelita Jaya, 2012-2013 and 2014-2015. Unfortunately, the title of champion is still contested by Satria Muda and Aspac. Satria Muda dominated NBL 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2014-2015. Aspac lifted the trophy the following two seasons.\nIn this way, from Kobatama 1999 to NBL Indonesia 2014-2015, only Satria Muda and Aspac were able to emerge as champions. This record seems to emphasize the rivalry between the two teams which is said to be the greatest in national basketball history.\nReturn of IBL (IBL Reborn).\nIn the middle of the 2015 NBL Indonesia competition, PT DBL Indonesia confirmed that it would not extend its contract as manager of the professional league. Thus, the end of the Indonesian NBL which made a big impression on the minds of Indonesian basketball fans. At the end of 2015, PERBASI entered into a collaboration with a new operator, Starting5 Sports and Entertainment. IBL returned to the name of the competition. The first year of IBL reborn produced something that many people were waiting for, namely the birth of champions outside of Satria Muda and Aspac.\nAt the 2016 season, CLS Knights Surabaya successfully won the championship. The opponents they faced in the final were not Satria Muda or Aspac, but Pelita Jaya. Using the best of three system, CLS won with a series score of 2-1. This title is the only one for the club based in Surabaya.\nPelita Jaya finally managed to break they're title drought since winning Kobatama 1991-1992. The team, which at that time was coached by Panasia legend, Johannis Winar, beat Satria Muda in the final.\nMeanwhile, in 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, two rulers once again dominated the national basketball competition. Satria Muda smothered Pelita Jaya, 2-1. \nAspac, which changed its name to Stapac after the merger with Stadium Jakarta, dominated the 2018-2019 IBL season.\nOne of the breakthroughs in the second IBL era was the return of foreign players being allowed. This makes competition more even. Clubs that previously had mediocre status, such as NSH Jakarta and Pacific Caesar Surabaya, were able to move up in class. Both of them advanced to the top four of the 2018-2019 IBL season. Don't forget Hangtuah, who was finally able to reach the semifinals in the 2017-2018 IBL.\nUnfortunately, the second era of IBL was marred by problems. One of them is the financial crisis that hit the Starting5.\nWinners.\nKOBATAMA Champions.\nBelow is a list KOBATAMA champions from the first edition in 1982 to the last edition in 2002.\n2003–2009: IBL early years.\n\"Italic\" indicates the club is withdrew or no longer play.\n2010–2015: NBL era.\n\"Italic\" indicates the club is withdrew or no longer play.\n2016–present: Back to IBL.\n\"Italic\" indicates the club is withdrew or no longer play."

        "text": "The 2024 Jannik Sinner tennis season officially began on 14 January 2024, with the start of the Australian Open in Melbourne.\nYearly summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nSinner started his year at the Australian Open, where he beat Botic van de Zandschulp, Jesper de Jong, Sebastián Báez, Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev (all in straight sets) to reach his second Grand Slam semifinal and first at the Australian Open. In the semifinals, he upset world No. 1 and defending champion Novak Djokovic to advance to his first major final, becoming the first player not to face a break point against Djokovic in a completed major match. His victory over the world No. 1 was Djokovic's first defeat at the Australian Open since 2018. He became the first Italian player to reach the singles final at this major and the third man, after Adriano Panatta at the 1976 French Open and Matteo Berrettini at the 2021 Wimbledon Championships, to reach a major final in the Open Era. In the final, he came from a two-set deficit to beat Daniil Medvedev to become the first Italian player, male or female, to win the Australian Open singles title, and the third man to win a Major (the second of which is in the Open Era), the first in 48 years. His victory over Medvedev meant he became the second player to win the Australian Open after losing the first two sets in the final, after Rafael Nadal, who also beat Medvedev in 2022.\nAs the top seed at the Rotterdam Open, he recorded his 200th win in the quarterfinals, after Milos Raonic retired with a hip injury with Sinner leading by a set, becoming the first player born in the 2000s to accomplish this feat. After defeating Tallon Griekspoor in the semifinal and Alex de Minaur in the final, Sinner rose to a new career high of No. 3 in the world, becoming the highest-ranked Italian player in history. Sinner also became the first male player since Lleyton Hewitt, in 2001, to win his debut event as Grand Slam champion. At the 2024 BNP Paribas Open, with a victory over 25th seed Jan-Lennard Struff to reach the fourth round, he recorded his 17th consecutive match win, the longest ATP level streak for an Italian player in the Open Era. Sinner extended this to 19 consecutive wins (16–0 in 2024) by defeating Jiří Lehečka in the quarter-final. Prior to his semifinal defeat to Carlos Alcaraz, Sinner had won 36 of his past 38 matches, dating back to the 2023 China Open.\nAt the 2024 Miami Open, Sinner defeated Grigor Dimitrov in the final to win his second Master’s 1000 title; as a result, he climbed to a career high (and Italian record) ranking of No. 2 in the world. Sinner improved his 2024 ATP match record to 22–1.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Jannik Sinner in 2024\nSingles matches.\n \nSchedule.\nPer Jannik Sinner, this is his current 2024 schedule (subject to change).\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nJannik Sinner has a ATP match win–loss record in the 2024 season.

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—which in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who national media members select. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2024 NCAA Women's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) for the 2023–24 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. Both AP and USBWA choose three teams, while WBCA lists ten honorees.\nA consensus All-America team in women's basketball has never been organized. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by AP, USBWA, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and \"Sporting News\" to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus All-America men's basketball team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, a consensus women's All-America team couldn't be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named different teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. \"Sporting News\" does not select an All-America team in women's basketball.\nBy selector.\nAssociated Press (AP).\nAnnounced on March 20, 2024. The teams are selected by the same 28-member media panel that votes on the AP poll during the season. Of note:\nAP Honorable Mention.\nHonorable mention selections are those who did not make one of the first three teams, but received at least one vote from the media panel.\nUnited States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA).\nThe USBWA announced its 15-member team, divided into first, second, and third teams, plus honorable mention selections, on March 15, 2023. Vote totals were not released.\nWomen's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA).\nAnnounced on April 4, 2024.\nAcademic All-Americans.\nCollege Sports Communicators (known before the 2022–23 season as the College Sports Information Directors of America) will announce its 2024 Academic All-America team on April 17, 2024."

        "title": "Wayne Cook (American football)",
        "text": "Wayne Cook (born April 13, 1971) is an American former college football player who was a quarterback for the UCLA Bruins. He led the Bruins to their first Rose Bowl in eight years during the 1993 season. Cook ended his UCLA career ranked third in Bruins history in touchdown passes (34). An undrafted free agent after college, he briefly tried out for the National Football League (NFL) with the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals.\nAfter his playing career, Cook became a high school teacher and golf coach. He joined the UCLA football radio broadcast team as a sideline reporter in 2002.\nEarly life.\nGrowing up in Newbury Park, California, Cook was a fan of the Arizona Wildcats. His father, Ken, played college football for the Wildcats as a tight end and defensive tackle and was the most valuable player and team co-captain of their 1962 team. Cook attended Newbury Park High School, where he was a three-sport athlete in football, basketball and baseball. Basketball was his favorite. He figured that playing three sports increased his chances of earning a scholarship, but he was not sure which sport it would be in.\nCook played football for his father, who was Newbury Park's head coach. In Cook's junior year, their football team was 1–8–1 while he dealt with a sore left shoulder, undergoing arthroscopic surgery after the season. In basketball, he led the team in rebounding for the second consecutive year. Playing first base in baseball, he had a .337 batting average and led the team with 28 runs.\nIn his senior year, he completed 16 of 29 passes for 141 yards and carried 10 times for 62 yards in a 6–6 tie in their season opener against Agoura. UCLA head coach Terry Donahue attended the game (his daughter was an Agoura cheerleader) and was impressed with Cook's play. Days later during practice, Cook fractured his right wrist when a teammate fell on his thumb. He missed three weeks, rushing his comeback and playing with his hand heavily taped. His production dipped, ending the season 91 of 189 passing (48.1%) for 1,197 yards and eight touchdowns but only three interceptions in seven games. In basketball, Cook led Ventura County in scoring with 22.3 points per game and also averaged a team-high 10.0 rebounds, the third straight season he led the team. He finished ranked fourth on the school's career rebound list with 536.\nCook wanted to play college football for Arizona, but they tended to run under new coach Dick Tomey's option offense, while Cook was a pro-style quarterback. After his injury, schools stopped recruiting him, and UCLA was the only Pac-10 program that remained interested. The Bruins offered him a scholarship after Newbury Park's season finale, a 21–14 win over Royal in which he completed 10 of 13 passes for 127 yards.\nCollege career.\nCook signed a letter of intent to play football at the University of California, Los Angeles, who days later landed two of the country's top quarterback recruits, Bert Emanuel and Tommy Maddox. Maddox became the starting quarterback in 1990, while Cook was on the scout team, emulating the upcoming opposing quarterback. Maddox excelled for two seasons before leaving for the 1992 NFL draft. A rangy quarterback, like Maddux, at and , Cook was named the starter in 1992, but suffered a season-ending injury in the first game against Cal State Fullerton. He completed eight of 13 passes for 155 yards and a touchdown in the game. He underwent reconstructive surgery for the torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, and the Bruins finished the season 6–5 with Ryan Fien and Rob Walker playing quarterback.\nThree days before the 1993 season opener, Cook was named the starter over Fien and Walker. The Bruins began the season 0–2 for the first time since 1971, losing the season opener against California that ended with a Cook interception at the Cal 28-yard line with 15 seconds remaining. The following week, he threw for a season-low 134 yards in a one-point loss to No. 8 Nebraska. However, UCLA emerged as a Rose Bowl contender, winning seven in a row, with Cook tying the single-game school record of four touchdown passes and becoming the first Bruin to reach the mark in consecutive games. He was out injured when they lost 9–3 to Arizona State. Cook was hurt the previous week when Washington State's DeWayne Patterson was offside and flattened him, injuring his right kidney and sending him to the hospital. The Bruins had scored 322 points in its first nine games with Cook before being held to a field goal in the loss without him. He returned the following week and threw for a touchdown and ran for another in a 27–21 win over USC, snapping a 10-game losing streak in their crosstown rivalry when the Rose Bowl was at stake for both teams. Cook became the first quarterback in eight years to lead UCLA to the Rose Bowl since Matt Stevens in 1985.\nThe Bruins lost 21–16 to Wisconsin in the 1994 Rose Bowl. On first and 10 from the Wisconsin 18-yard line with 15 seconds left in the game and no timeouts remaining, Cook ran the ball for three yards but was tackled and time expired. The play was intended to be a pass into the end zone, or spiking the ball and stopping the clock if it was not open. However, Cook said he \"saw an opening and my natural instinct took over which was to run the ball. It was the wrong play.\" He finished 28 of 43 passing for 288 yards and a touchdown. The Bruins committed six turnovers, with Cook losing two fumbles and throwing an interception. They finished the season 8–4, and Cook completed 165 passes in 297 attempts for 2,067 yards, 18 touchdowns and just four interceptions. UCLA head coach Terry Donahue said that \"what's been the most impressive about Wayne Cook is his touchdown-to-interception ratio\". Fifteen of his scoring strikes were to All-American receiver J. J. Stokes, including a 95-yard pass against Washington that was the longest play in UCLA history. Cook received honorable mention for the All-Pac-10 team.\nUCLA was hampered by injuries in 1994, and lost six straight games. Fans were calling for Cook to be benched midseason. With Stokes back healthy, the Bruins recovered to win their next two games against Stanford and Arizona State, scoring a total of 90 points, more than in their entire losing streak. Cook threw for a career-high 380 yards and again tied the school record with four touchdowns to beat Arizona State 59–23. In their season finale, UCLA upset USC 31–19, their fourth straight win against their rivals. The loss denied the Trojans a berth in the Rose Bowl, while Cook became the first Bruins quarterback in 35 years to defeat the Trojans in consecutive seasons. In three straight wins to end the season, he was 52 of 72 passing for 894 yards and eight touchdowns.\nCook finished his career with 352 completions on 612 attempts (57.3%) for 4,753 yards. At the time, his 34 touchdown passes ranked third in UCLA history behind Tom Ramsey (50) and Troy Aikman (41). He had a 13–10 record as a starter.\nProfessional career.\nOn the final day of the 1995 NFL draft, Cook signed with the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent. He participated in two mini-camps before being cut. The 49ers invited four quarterbacks to training camp, choosing the veteran Cary Conklin over Cook to join Steve Young, Elvis Grbac, and Bob Gagliano. Cook then signed with the Arizona Cardinals. He entered training camp with three other quarterbacks—veterans Dave Krieg and Mike Buck and fellow rookie Stoney Case, a third-round draft pick who was roommates with Cook at the Blue-Gray Game. The Cardinals cut Cook ahead of the league's 60-player-limit deadline.\nLater years.\nAfter football, Cook became a social science teacher and golf coach at Chaparral High School in Temecula, California. In 2002, he started working part-time as a sideline reporter for UCLA football's radio broadcasts."

In the subsequent days, guards George Washington III and Dug McDaniel entered the NCAA transfer portal. They were followed by center Tarris Reed and forward Youssef Khayat on March 19. \nOn March 23, Michigan hired former Florida Atlantic head coach Dusty May to be their next head coach. On April 4, McDaniel announced he would transfer to Kansas State. The same day, May hired former Georgia assistant Akeem Miskdeen and former Oklahoma State head coach Mike Boynton to his coaching staff. Forward Will Tschetter became the first player to announce his return to the team, and forward Terrance Williams II decided to both enter the transfer portal and declare for the 2024 NBA draft. On April 9, Youssef Khayat announced his departure for Bowling Green. On April 11, George Washington III removed his name from the transfer portal, becoming the second player to return to the team. \nThe same day, May hired former Saint Mary's associate head coach Justin Joyner to the coaching staff. On April 16, May hired two former assistants from Florida Atlantic, Drew Williamson and Kyle Church, to complete his coaching staff. When the NCAA expanded coaching staff limits from 3 to 5 assistants in 2023, it determined that the two additional coaches may engage in coaching activities but may not recruit off campus. On April 17, Tarris Reed announced he would transfer to the back-to-back defending national champion UConn Huskies. On April 18, May formally presented his staff with clarifying titles for Kyle Church (assistant coach/general manager) and Drew Williamson (assistant coach/director of player development), which are different from the other three assistant coaches that have no secondary title, and presenting Brandon Gilbert as special assistant to the head coach. \nOn April 19, high school prospect Justin Pippen gave a verbal commitment to Michigan, May’s first commitment as head coach. Two hours later, Rubin Jones announced he would come to Michigan as a graduate transfer from North Texas where he had been a Conference USA All-Freshman (2021) and All-Defensive (2023) selection. He was May's first transfer portal commitment. On April 20, Michigan secured its second transfer portal commitment under May, as 2024 Ivy League Tournament MVP Danny Wolf of Yale committed to the Wolverines. Wolf was ranked as the #24 overall ranked prospect in the transfer portal and was a first-team All-Ivy League selection (2024). The following day, April 21, Tre Donaldson of Auburn committed to the Wolverines, Michigan’s third transfer portal acquisition. Donaldson was a four star transfer prospect, ranked #81 overall. On April 22, Michigan received a transfer commitment from former archrival Ohio State guard, Roddy Gayle Jr. He was Michigan’s fourth transfer portal addition in as many days. Gayle was rated as a four star transfer portal prospect, ranked #53 overall (number 6 shooting guard). As a high school recruit he was ranked as the #50 overall prospect (number 3 shooting guard) in the national recruiting class of 2022. That same day, four star sophomore forward Sam Walters of Alabama became Michigan’s fifth transfer portal commitment. \nOn April 23, high school guard Lorenzo Cason committed to the 2024 recruiting class, giving Dusty May and Michigan seven total commitments in five days. On April 29, Vladislav Goldin, Russian born former Florida Atlantic University starting center, withdrew from the NBA draft process to join his former head coach in Ann Arbor, giving Dusty May eight new off season commitments in the month of April. Goldin was a second-team All-American Athletic Conference (2024) and third-team All-Conference USA (2023) selection, ranked as the #38 overall player in the transfer portal. On the same day, Washington III re-entered the NCAA transfer portal. On April 30, Nimari Burnett officially announced he would be staying in Ann Arbor, the second tenured Wolverine to return, along with Tschetter. Burnett and Goldin were teammates and both members of Texas Tech’s 2020 recruiting class. Hours after Burnett’s announcement, Williams II informed the team that he would transfer to USC for his final season.\nRecruiting classes.\nOn November 8, 2023, Michigan signed four-star guards Christian Anderson Jr. and Durral Brooks to their National Letter of Intent (NLI). Following the firing of Juwan Howard in 2024, Michigan lost top 50 ranked commit Khani Rooths on March 18, and signee Christian Anderson on March 29. On April 19, Justin Pippen, the son of Scottie Pippen, became the first high school or transfer portal commitment for Dusty May and the highest ranked high school recruit May had ever landed. Pippen was a late riser, entering the rankings in the fall of his senior year at 191 and rising to number 60 by the years end. On April 23, former Florida Atlantic signee and three star guard Lorenzo Cason followed Dusty May to Michigan, pledging his verbal commitment.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=\"\"|Non-conference regular season\nSource:"

It is operated in a similar fashion to the men's college National Invitation Tournament (NIT) and is run by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The similarly-titled Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) is unaffiliated with the NCAA.\nFormat.\nThe NCAA announced the creation of the WBIT on July 17, 2023, with the first edition to be held in 2024. The WBIT supplies an additional 32 funded opportunities for postseason play, providing gender parity to men's college basketball, which has the NCAA-owned NIT. The existing non-NCAA postseason tournaments, the Women's National Invitation Tournament and Women's Basketball Invitational, are \"pay-to-play\" events where teams must pay a fee to the event sponsor, in addition to travel costs.\nThe \"first four out\" of the NCAA tournament will be the top four seeds of the WBIT. All regular season champions who were not otherwise invited to the NCAA tournament, and are eligible for NCAA-sponsored postseason play, are automatically selected for the WBIT, similar to the rule in the men's NIT prior to 2024. The top eight schools host first and second-round games. Only the top 16 teams are seeded, with the remaining 16 teams placed as close to their schools as possible. Unlike the NCAA tournament, geographical considerations for each team on a given seed line are considered, so that the No. 2 seeds are placed as close to the No. 1 seeds, and so forth. The higher seeded school will be able to have home court advantage until the final four round, which is held at a designated site. In 2024, this site was Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, which also hosted the semifinals and final of the 2024 men's NIT."

He then enrolled at Siena in 1986, where over the next four years he would become a Siena Hall of Fame player. As a freshman Robinson averaged 9.8 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 2.7 assists and was named to the North Atlantic Conference (now called America East Conference) All-Rookie Team. As a sophomore he increased two of his three averages while amassing 13.7 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. They won the NAC title regular season title but lost in the conference tournament, thus did not get a bid to the 1988 NCAA tournament.\nIn 1988–89, Robinson's junior season, Siena repeated as conference regular season champions, but this time they won the NAC tournament and earned a berth into the 1989 NCAA tournament. The 14th-seeded Saints pulled off one of the upsets of the tournament by defeating 3rd-seeded Stanford in the first round, 80–78. They lost in the round of 32 to 11th-seeded Minnesota, 67–80, however. For the year, Robinson averaged a team-leading and career-high 19.8 points per game, along with a career-high 5.8 rebounds, and 2.1 assists. He was named to the All-North Atlantic First Team and was bestowed the honor of North Atlantic Conference Player of the Year.\nThe summer between Robinson's junior and senior years, Siena left the North Atlantic Conference to join the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC). While Robinson did not earn all-conference accolades in his new conference, he still averaged 14.9 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game. On January 18, 1990, he scored 23 points to surpass Eric Banks (1,432 points) as Siena's all-time leading scorer. Robinson finished his career with 1,657 points, which has since been surpassed as the number one spot at Siena but as of 2023–24 is still in the top ten all-time.\nSiena inducted Robinson into their athletics hall of fame in 1996. In 2010, he was selected to the Upstate New York Basketball Hall of Fame."

Hobart successfully defended its championship by defeating Trinity 2–0. They became the first team to win consecutive championships since St. Norbert in 2011 and 2012.\nQualifying teams.\nIn January, the NCAA approved the addition of a 13th bid for this season's NCAA tournament. The move was done to keep the ratio of 1:6.5 bids per Division III programs and, with the revival of MCLA, that necessitated 13 teams being part of the tournament field. The selection process remained unchanged and teams were sill selected according to the following manner: (Pool A) nine teams received bids as a result of being conference tournament champions from conferences that possessed an automatic bid, (Pool C) four additional teams received at-large bids based upon their records.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured four rounds of play. All rounds were single-game elimination.\nBecause there were four western bids, those teams were all placed into the same bracket. The remaining nine (eastern) teams were arranged so that the top three teams received byes into the quarterfinal round. The eastern teams that began in the first round were sorted as follows: the fourth eastern seed would play the ninth eastern seed with the winner advancing to play the third eastern seed; the fifth eastern seed would play the eighth eastern seed with the winner advancing to play the second eastern seed; the sixth eastern seed would play the seventh eastern seed with the winner advancing to play the first eastern seed. The four brackets were arranged so that the winner of the one containing the first overall seed would play the winner of the bracket with the fourth overall seed. The higher-seeded team played host in all first round and quarterfinal matches."

        "title": "National Basketball Referees Association",
        "text": "The National Basketball Referees Association (NBRA) is the labor union that represents National Basketball Association (NBA), G League, and Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) referees. It was founded in 1977.\nHistory.\nThe National Basketball Officials Association was formed in 1973 to improve the labor environment for NBA referees. The association became a labor union in 1977. Originally formed as the National Association of Basketball Referees, the union settled on its current name during its negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement.\n1977 Strike.\nLed by Richie Phillips, the NBRA's first major action was an effort to win a collective bargaining agreement. The NBA was contracting officials individually at that point. The 24-member union decided to strike during the 1977 playoffs, for maximum visibility. Phillips called a strike on April 10, the last day of the regular season. The union was seeking higher wages, severance, and arbitration for fired officials. The NBA PLayers Association had a no-strike clause at that point, and they refused to strike in solidarity. Some players and coaches felt the game was improved by their absence.\nThe NBA responded by hiring replacement referees from the Eastern Basketball League and elsewhere. Costing only $300 per game, plus a $40 per diem, the NBA made do with scabs until their inferior officiating caused complaints from players and fans. The NBA agreed to recognize the NBRA as a negotiating partner and the two eventually agreed to a contract.\n1983 Strike.\nWhen their first CBA expired in 1983, the NBRA asked for a 48% wage increase. Referees' starting salary was $24,000, and they averaged $40,000, while NBA players averaged $248,000. As before, the NBA replaced them, and the results were so poor that Dick Young wrote, \"The fill-in officials are brutal. I thought I was watching...a steel cage match. Palming? I don't believe these substitute refs know what palming is. And traveling? Forget it. There is no such violation...Next thing you know, the NBA players will be putting the ball under their arm like a running back.\"\nThe strike lasted from the beginning of the season until December 16.\n1995 Lockout.\nThe NBA locked out the referees because the NBRA rejected the league's request for a no-strike clause in their contract. The NBA was offering a 30% wage increase over 5 years from the 1995–96 season, while the union was asking for a 70% increase in the first year of a new contract. The NBA again used replacement referees and reduced the size of game crews from 3 officials to 2.\nUnder Fred Slaughter, the NBRA held out until early December. In a 27–26 vote (with 2 members not voting), the union agreed to a new 5-year contract that would see starting salaries increase to $90,000 and top salaries to $328,000.\nWNBA.\nIn 2017, the NBRA negotiated the WNBA's first collective bargaining agreement with its referees. The contract resulted in a 66% wage increase and a 401(k)."

The sport was contested for a second time in the 1966 GANEFO in Phnom Penh, Cambodia (1st Asian GANEFO) prior to the collapse of the GANEFO organization in the 1970s.\nSince the Chinese national badminton team were not able to compete in international events in the 1960s due to not being affiliated with the International Badminton Federation, the Chinese team were only allowed to compete in GANEFO badminton events. The Games gave the Chinese team a platform to shine as Chinese players managed to reach the finals in every discipline."

Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2024 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), \"The Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose three teams, while AP and USBWA also list honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2024 College Basketball All-American team will be determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nIndividual All-America teams.\nBy team.\nAP Honorable Mention:\nUSBWA Honorable Mention:\nAcademic All-Americans.\nCollege Sports Communicators (known before the 2022–23 season as the College Sports Information Directors of America) will announce its 2024 Academic All-America team on April 16, 2024."

        "text": "The 2024 NCAA Division I women's basketball championship game was the final game of the 2024 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. It determined the champion of the 2023–24 NCAA Division I women's basketball season and was contested by the Iowa Hawkeyes from the Big Ten Conference and the South Carolina Gamecocks from the Southeastern Conference. The game was played on April 7, 2024, at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland, Ohio. South Carolina defeated Iowa 87–75 to capture the third national championship in program history. Iowa finished as runner-up for the second season in a row.\nIowa scored the game's first ten points and led by seven points at the end of the first quarter behind an NCAA championship-record eighteen points from Caitlin Clark. South Carolina started the second quarter scoring seven consecutive points to tie the game, 27–27, and South Carolina's Kamilla Cardoso gave her team the lead with five minutes left in the half. Shots made by both teams kept the game close and the Gamecocks took a three-point lead into halftime after baskets by Te-Hina Paopao and Raven Johnson. The South Carolina lead was stretched to nine points shortly into the third quarter and a Johnson three-point field goal pushed it to eleven points before a layup by Sydney Affolter brought the Hawkeyes' deficit back to nine. The start of the fourth quarter saw South Carolina take a thirteen-point lead, shortly followed by three-pointers by Clark and Gabbie Marshall. The end of the fourth quarter saw a 7–0 run by South Carolina that finalized their championship victory, 87–75.\nSouth Carolina's Cardoso was named Most Outstanding Player (MOP) following her 15-point, 17-rebound performance in the championship game. Iowa's Caitlin Clark became the first player to score 30 points or more in two championship games.\nParticipants.\nIowa Hawkeyes.\nThe Hawkeyes, representing the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, were led by head coach Lisa Bluder in her 24th season at the school. Ranked No. 3 in the AP preseason poll, they won their first three games of the season, including a neutral site win over No. 8 Virginia Tech in Charlotte, North Carolina, before suffering a loss to Kansas State. They participated in the Gulf Coast Showcase, where they defeated Purdue Fort Wayne, Florida Gulf Coast, and avenged their loss to Kansas State. In Big Ten conference play, the Hawkeyes defeated Michigan State 76–73 on a three-point buzzer beater by Caitlin Clark and scored home victories over No. 14 Indiana and No. 2 Ohio State. They finished 15–3 in the conference, with those losses coming on the road to Ohio State and Indiana, along with Nebraska, which rallied from 14 points down in the 4th quarter to send Iowa home with a defeat. Caitlin Clark earned consensus national player of the year honors. The Hawkeyes received the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten tournament, where they defeated Penn State, Michigan and Nebraska en route to their third consecutive conference tournament championship.\nIowa received the Big Ten's automatic invitation to the NCAA tournament by virtue of their conference tournament championship and were selected as the No. 1 seed in the Albany Regional 2. The Hawkeyes hosted first- and second-round games at their home arena, Carver–Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, and they defeated No. 16 seed Holy Cross in their first-round game. The other first-round game played in Iowa City saw No. 8 seed West Virginia defeat No. 9 seed Princeton, and Iowa defeated West Virginia by ten points in the second round to advance to the regional semifinal. There, they faced and defeated No. 5 seed Colorado at MVP Arena in Albany, and took down No. 3 seed LSU 94–87 in a rematch of the previous year's national championship game. That game drew 12.3 million viewers, at the time the most ever for a college basketball game – men's or women's – on ESPN. They won 71–69 over Connecticut in the national semifinal establishing a new viewership mark at 14.2 million viewers to reach the national championship game for the second year in a row.\nSouth Carolina Gamecocks.\nThe Gamecocks, representing the University of South Carolina in Columbia, South Carolina, were led by head coach Dawn Staley in her 16th season at the school. They began the season No. 6 in the AP Poll's preseason rankings and elevated to No. 1, securing twenty-three of thirty-six first place votes, by November 13 after two early wins over No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 14 Maryland. South Carolina earned further non-conference wins over AP-ranked teams against No. 24 North Carolina and No. 11 Utah, and the Gamecocks entered conference play with a 12–0 record. The team completed a perfect 16–0 season in conference play with only two games decided by a single-digit margin (9-point win at No. 9 LSU and an 8-point win at home over Tennessee). South Carolina also won a non-conference game over No. 11 UConn on February 11 and finished the regular season with a 29–0 record.\nSouth Carolina received the SEC's automatic invitation to the NCAA tournament by defeating Texas A&amp;M, Tennessee, and No 8 LSU to secure the conference tournament championship and were selected as the No. 1 seed in the Albany Regional 1. Like Iowa, the Gamecocks hosted first- and second-round games at their home arena, Colonial Life Arena in Columbia, and they defeated No. 16 seed Presbyterian in their first-round game. The other first-round game played in Columbia saw No. 8 seed North Carolina defeat No. 9 seed Michigan State, and South Carolina defeated North Carolina by 47 points in the second round to advance to the regional semifinal. There, they faced and defeated No. 4 seed Indiana at MVP Arena in Albany, and advanced No. 3 seed Oregon State 70–58 to reach the Final Four for the fourth consecutive season. They won 78–59 over NC State in the national semifinal to reach the national championship game for the second time in three seasons, and are looking to finish as the 10th unbeaten national champion in women's NCAA basketball. Entering this game, South Carolina has won 79 of 80 games with the only loss coming to Iowa in the 2023 national semifinal round.\nGame summary.\nThe game began with South Carolina winning the opening tip, and Iowa opened the game's scoring with a three-point jump shot made by Iowa's Kate Martin twenty-two seconds in. Another made shot by Martin was followed by jumpers by Sydney Affolter and Caitlin Clark, giving Iowa a 10–0 lead to begin the game. South Carolina's first made shot came nearly three minutes into the game on a Kamilla Cardoso layup. Clark attempted six free throws over the next minute and a half of game time, making five, along with a layup and a three-point shot; South Carolina scored on shots by Te-Hina Paopao, Cardoso, and Chloe Kitts. With Iowa leading 20–9, neither team scored for nearly a minute before Sania Feagan broke the drought with a layup, followed by a layup by MiLaysia Fulwiley. After two free throws by Martin, South Carolina scored on shots by Fulwiley and Tessa Johnson and narrowed Iowa' lead to two points. Clark ended the quarter with two consecutive jump shots, giving Iowa a 27–20 lead. Clark's eighteen points in the first quarter was an NCAA championship record. The second quarter began with South Carolina scoring seven unanswered points via Johnson and Cardoso, tying the game at 27 points apiece. Affolter scored Iowa's first points of the quarter on a three-point jumper two minutes in. The teams then traded baskets and South Carolina took a two-point lead with Cardoso's made layup with 4:58 remaining in the half. Stuelke reestablished Iowa's lead but Kitts tied the game again with a free throw, though shots made shortly after by Stuelke and Martin put Iowa back ahead by four points. The teams traded the lead for the remainder of the quarter and the Gamecocks finished the half with made shots by Paopao and Raven Johnson and took a three-point lead into halftime.\nThe Gamecocks began the second half with possession of the ball and extended their lead to nine points in short order with made shots by Kitts and Paopao; a Clark jump shot with 7:15 left marked Iowa's first points of the half and narrowed South Carolina's lead to 55–48. The teams traded field goals for the next few minutes, with South Carolina maintaining the lead. Consecutive three-point shots by Johnson and Bree Hall extended the Gamecocks' advantage to ten points; after Martin made two free throws for Iowa, Johnson made another three-pointer to put her team ahead by eleven. After an Iowa timeout, Affolter made a layup with fifty-one seconds remaining in the third quarter to narrow the deficit to nine points; the quarter ended with no further scoring and South Carolina took a 68–59 lead into the final quarter. South Carolina's lead expanded to thirteen points with eight minutes remaining in the game. A Clark three-pointer a minute later made the score 76–67, and Marshall made a three-pointer of her own shortly afterwards to narrow the deficit to six points. Made shots by Martin and Affolter kept the Gamecocks' lead to five after a Hall jump shot, though South Carolina scored the next seven points on shots by Paopao, Cardoso, Watkins, and Johnson. Leading 87–75, South Carolina was able to run the remaining time off of the clock and secure a national championship victory.\nMedia coverage.\nFor the second consecutive season, the championship game was televised in the United States by ABC, with Ryan Ruocco on play-by-play commentary, Rebecca Lobo as the analyst, and Holly Rowe as sideline reporter. ESPN presented Megacast coverage of the game—with alternate broadcast \"The Bird &amp; Taurasi Show\" with Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on ESPN and ESPN+, along with rail cam and data-enhanced (\"Beyond the Rim\") broadcasts on ESPN+\".\"\nNielsen ratings reported that the final was seen by 18.7 million viewers—the largest-ever audience for a women's basketball game in the United States, and an 89% year-over-increase over 2023. It was the third consecutive tournament game to break the record in a single week, following the Elite Eight match between Iowa and LSU on April 1 (which had drawn 12.3 million viewers) and the Final Four match between Iowa and UConn on April 5 (who had drawn 14.2 million viewers). The game was the most-watched basketball game of any kind broadcast by an ESPN network since 2019. It was the second most-watched non-Olympic women's sporting event ever broadcast on live U.S. television, behind only the 2015 Women’s World Cup final.\nAftermath.\nSouth Carolina's national championship victory marked the first undefeated national championship season in Division I women's basketball since UConn in 2016. Kamilla Cardoso was named Most Outstanding Player (MOP)."

        "text": "The \"Valorant\" tournament for the 2023 Southeast Asian Games was held on May 8 to 10 at the Olympia Mall in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. This is the inaugural appearance of the title in the games, in which there were joint gold medal winners, as well as joint bronze medal winners. \nIndonesia and Singapore took home joint gold medals following the controversial gold medal match which was marred by an alleged in-game bug abuse. There were no silver medals awarded, however, as the Philippines and Vietnam took home bronze medals despite the former winning the bronze medal match.\nThe tournament consisted of single round-robin group stage and a single-elimination playoff stage.\nParticipating teams.\nThere are six nations that participated in the \"Valorant\" tournament.\nGroup Stage.\nAll matches were a best-of-1 series, and the top four teams after the group stages qualified for the semifinals.\nKnockout stage.\nSemifinals.\nWinners advanced to the gold medal match, while losers were relegated to the bronze medal match.\nGold medal match.\nThe gold medal match was marred by controversy after a protest from Indonesia was raised, saying that the Cypher camera placement by one of the players of Team Singapore, Ingram Tan, was used to gain an unfair advantage. However, this was refuted by Singapore's Tidus Goh, stating that the rulebooks stated that 'as long as the camera is viewable and able to be destroyed by both teams, it is legal, furthermore according to the rulebook, the penalty depends if the bug had an impact on the round'. He also revealed fully through TwitLonger on what happened onsite during the controversy. The camera placement has stirred a debate within the Valorant Southeast Asian community, with mixed opinions on it. With this, the tournament officials were forced to suspend play at the start of the 15th round of the second game with Singapore already leading the series after winning Game 1 earlier, leading to review the potential bug abuse. \nAfter an initial lengthy review, the tournament officials decided to roll back and replay the game to round 14, with Singapore leading 9–4. However, Indonesia disputed this, claiming that the bug occurred on that round. A new set of ruling was then sent out at 4am that the match be replayed at round 11, with the score being tied at 5–5. Just when the play is about to resume at 8am the next day, Team Indonesia told the organizers that they would forfeit the series, saying that 'it was unfair that the rules had not made clear'. With the result, the second game was abandoned with the scoreline of 10–4 as is, and giving the 2–0 win to Singapore. The spokesperson of the Singapore Esports Association, Janet Su, stated in an interview that the SEA Games Organizing Committee offered both teams to become joint-gold medalists of the tournament, in which Singapore accepted in the spirit of sportsmanship.\nViewership.\nThe tournament had the highest peak viewership of 44,324 live viewers in the tournament particularly during the controversial gold medal match between Singapore and Indonesia, and the tournament also averaged 11,829 viewers throughout the tournament."

        "title": "Whanganui cricket team",
        "text": "The Whanganui cricket team (previously spelt Wanganui) represents the Whanganui District on the south-west coast of New Zealand's North Island. It also covers the adjoining areas of Rangitikei, Ruapehu and Waverley.\nThe team's governing body, Cricket Whanganui (formerly the Wanganui Cricket Association), has its headquarters at Victoria Park in the town of Whanganui. It is one of the 21 teams from around New Zealand that compete in the Hawke Cup. Since its first match in the competition in the 1912–13 season, Whanganui has won the title six times. \nHistory.\nEarly days.\nThe first cricket match in Wanganui was played on 31 December 1847 between two teams of soldiers. The Wanganui Cricket Club was formed in the 1850s. The Wanganui and Rangitikei cricket clubs played each other regularly in the 1860s.\nWanganui achieved a notable success when their team of 22 defeated the touring Australian XI in February 1881 at the Racecourse Ground. The pitch was hard and bumpy, and the Wanganui selectors had made sure they selected the district's best fieldsmen. With all 22 of them on the field at once, \"their numbers and agility were too much for the Australians\". Wanganui also had William Barton, who was working in the Bank of New Zealand in Wanganui, and was considered the best batsman in New Zealand at the time; he scored 44 of the 85 runs Wanganui required to win. Australia did not lose another match in New Zealand until 1967.\nAfter abortive attempts in the 1880s and early 1890s, the Wanganui Cricket Association was formed in 1896. At first it had only five competing teams: Wanganui A and B, United, and Collegiate School I and II. It affiliated with NZCC in 1898, C. R. Clark of Christchurch representing the Association as delegate. \nHawke Cup.\nWanganui first competed in the Hawke Cup in 1912–13. Captained by Hugh Butterworth, they won their elimination match against South Taranaki by an innings and 394 runs. They first won the title in 1913–14, when they beat South Auckland, thanks to the all-rounders Chester Holland, Bill Bernau and James Hussey. On the basis of his form for Wanganui, Holland was selected to represent New Zealand against the touring Australians later that season. Wanganui held the Hawke Cup against several challenges and kept it through the hiatus caused by World War I before losing narrowly to Poverty Bay in March 1919. \nWanganui were the strongest team in the Hawke Cup in the 1920s. Playing until 1928, Chester Holland established a record for Hawke Cup challenge matches of 189 wickets which has never been equalled. He also took 10 for 35 against South Taranaki in 1922–23, which is still the only instance of ten wickets in an innings in Hawke Cup challenge matches. Bill Bernau also continued playing for Wanganui, showing such good all-round form that he was included in the New Zealand team to England in 1927 based purely on his matches for Wanganui. \nThe captain for much of the 1920s was George Orr, of whom the New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese wrote that he \"not only proved himself a very sound batsman but seemed by his successes to inspire the others\". Also a fine slips fieldsman, Orr later coached Wanganui to the Hawke Cup title in the 1940s.\nWanganui was one of the original constituent associations that made up the Central Districts team, which began competing in the Plunket Shield in the 1950–51 season. The two Wanganui players in the inaugural team were Harry Cave and Don Beard. While still occasionally playing for Wanganui, Cave captained the New Zealand Test team in the mid-1950s. Captained by Ron Thomas, Wanganui held the Hawke Cup between January 1953 and December 1955.\nAs of the 2023–24 season, there are nine senior clubs in the association: Combined Whanganui, Kaitoke, Marist, Marton Saracens, Renegades, Taihape, Tech, Whanganui United and Wicket Warriors."

As with previous tournaments the Festival of World Cups served as part of the build-up to the main competition and was expected to include the wheelchair competition. In May 2016, the World Cup organising committee raised concerns over financial support for the festival, but by September the England team still anticipated that the wheelchair event would take place in Sydney, Australia. All the teams were European apart from the hosts and holding the tournament in Australia came to be considered financially unviable. In November 2016, the RLIF announced that the wheelchair tournament would be held in France in order to maximise the number of teams taking part. The cost of travel was an issue for participating nations and in the Welsh Parliament it was noted that Wales were dependent on sponsorship and donations in order to take part. In March 2017, the Australian team received from the NRL towards their transport costs.\nIn April 2017, the French Rugby League Federation announced that the tournament would take place between 20 July and 28 July with the final taking place at the Parc des Expositions in Perpignan.\nVenues.\nThe venues for the tournament were all in the Occitania region in southern France:\nTeams.\nThe seven teams that took part in the tournament were the four semi-finalists from 2013 (Australia, England, France and Wales) who were placed in Group A and Italy, Scotland and Spain in Group B.

        "text": "Le Stade de Wimbledon is a French film directed by Mathieu Amalric, which premiered at the Locarno Film Festival in August 2001, followed by a general release in France on February 13, 2002. The director's second feature, this is a faithful adaptation of Italian writer Daniele Del Giudice's 1983 homonym novel, which, contrary to what its title suggests, is the story of a personal and literary quest in the Italian border town of Trieste. The film's main protagonist is actress Jeanne Balibar, who also acts as narrator.\nWell-received by the critics, this work, with its distinctive aesthetic and rhythm, has enabled Mathieu Amalric to be seen by the profession and the public alike as a director in his own right in French auteur cinema, and not just as one of its leading players. The film's selection as one of the nine finalists for the 2002 Prix Louis-Delluc is just one element in this recognition.\nSynopsis.\nIn the streets of Trieste, Italy, a young woman sets out to find a writer, Bobi Wohler, who never published a book during his lifetime, apart from his Italian translations of the works of Robert Musil and Franz Kafka. This ghost-writer died in the 1960s and became a figure in the literary and intellectual milieu of this border town, which was nourished by the triple cultural influence of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the turn of the century, Italy at the beginning of its unity, and post-war Yugoslavia. Bobi Wohler frequented Italo Svevo, Eugenio Montale and James Joyce.\nOver the course of an entire year, she makes four trips to the city (one per season), each lasting one day, interviewing old booksellers and people close to Wohler for her work, in an increasingly personal, quasi-metaphysical quest whose real reasons are not revealed - although it is probably academic research in nature. Her journey ends in London, England, where she meets Ljuba Blumenthal, a former companion of the writer, to whom she submits her work. After an unsuccessful one-night stand in an English pub, she wanders the deserted bays of Wimbledon stadium's center court.\nProduction.\nScript.\n\"Le Stade de Wimbledon\" is Mathieu Amalric's second feature film. It is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Daniele Del Giudice, originally published in 1983 -and winner of the Viareggio prize for first novels- but used in part in an original translation by Jean-Paul Manganaro made for the film, in which he portrays a woman, played by his then partner Jeanne Balibar, in search of a work and a writer who never published in his lifetime. The novelist and director were inspired by the real-life story of the Triestine poet and writer Roberto \"Bobi\" Bazlen (1902-1965), who became the film's \"Bobi Wohler\". For Mathieu Amalric, this poetic search is that of a fantasized and therefore necessarily unfulfilled artistic ideal but also a desire to make a quasi \"investigation of Jeanne [Balibar] and light.\"\nMathieu Amalric's choice of novel was a matter of chance, as he decided to adapt the first book he came across at random. To do so, he picked a book from the library of the country home of Étienne and Françoise Balibar, Jeanne Balibar's parents in the same way that Jean-Yves Dubois, the main character in Mange ta soupe (1997), did in a scene from his previous film. The desire and challenge of adapting this difficult, action-free novel about an impossible quest also took shape in the director's mind, given that Trieste is \"virgin territory\" for cinema, with no past references and far removed from the clichés and images of Italian cities. Its use in cinema therefore opens up the possibility of new discoveries, and more strongly stimulates an imagination nourished by the diversity of this border city with its many influences, languages and cultures. Another important element of the adaptation is the filmmaker's choice to transform the novel's main character - who is a man - into a woman, following a suggestion by Jeanne Balibar, initially made in jest, to star in her partner's film, and with the enthusiastic agreement of Daniele Del Giudice.\nThe film was produced by Paulo Branco, who, at Mathieu Amalric's request, authorized him to begin shooting part of the film on the sly, under the pretext of location scouting in Trieste, without having yet secured the required financing or finalized the entire project. The total budget for the film was around 3 million francs.\nFilming and post-production.\nShooting took place mainly in the Italian city of Trieste in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, over a period of a year and a half, at a rate of one week's shooting per quarter, to respect the seasons mentioned, and in the chronological order of the main scenes in order to preserve these elements of the novel. A large number of scenes were shot with a very limited crew of just a few people, depending on the light and the mood of the moment on the set, whether that of Jeanne Balibar or that of the director through his desire and his view of his actress, without prior preparation or special administrative authorization. Mathieu Amalric directs his crew with his annotated book in hand and occasionally calls Daniele Del Giudice to clarify certain passages or the reality of certain locations. With \"Le Stade de Wimbledon\", the director declares:\"I wanted to get to the heart of cinema, its core. It was like a command to myself\" \n-Mathieu Amalric, February 2002In agreement with his cinematographer Christophe Beaucarne, Mathieu Amalric decided to shoot in 35 mm with very low-sensitivity film, using natural light according to the conditions of the moment and without artificial lighting. In addition to the streets and squares, the main city locations used for filming included Trieste main railway station, the city's synagogue, Caffè San Marco and Caffè Tommaseo, the Galleria Fabris restaurant, Trieste bookshops including Antiquaria Umberto Saba and the city library, Trieste's unisex beach on the molo Fratelli Bandiera, Miramare Castle, and the apartments of people who actually knew Roberto Bazlen. The part of the film set in England was shot in the streets and neighborhood of Wimbledon in London, including Wimbledon Park tube station, as well as in Streatham for the B&amp;B, and in Clapham for the pub scene. The film's final scene was shot almost in flight at the \"All England Club\" hosting the Wimbledon tournament, due to the lack of filming permission received by the production.\nDuring editing, voice-overs were added, essentially excerpts read from the novel adapted by Jean-Paul Manganaro, as well as a few quotations from Roberto Bazlen himself. For the film's soundtrack, Mathieu Amalric asked Grégoire Hetzel to write an original score, which the composer entitled \"Wimbledon Gates\", and which was directly inspired by a work of minimalist music, \"China Gates\" (1977), by John Adams. The piece is performed on piano by Jérôme Ducros, who had already played the passages from \"Bach's Partitas\" that formed the soundtrack to the director's previous film, Mange ta soupe (1997).\nFestival presentations and national releases.\n\"Le Stade de Wimbledon\" was first presented to the public at the 54th Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland on August 12, 2001, closing the \"Cinéastes du présent \" section, and at the Rotterdam International Film Festival on January 24, 2002. The film was widely released in France on the big screen on February 13, 2002, with twenty copies distributed. The same year, it was presented in New York at the \"\"Rendez-Vous with French Cinema\" on March 8, and in Argentina at the Mar del Plata International Film Festival on March 12.\nThe film's theatrical run since its release in 2002 has been accompanied by 36,809 admissions in Europe, most of them in France with 34,277 spectators.\nOn June 4, 2007, \"Cahiers du cinéma\" published the film on a double DVD in the \"Deux films de...\"\" collection, along with the director's first film, \"Mange ta soupe\" (1997). The film is complemented by an 18-minute bonus documentary, a veritable \"work in its own right\" entitled Malus, presenting the creative work surrounding the film - preparatory notes, fittings, location scouting, and an interview with the Italian novelist - and a \"mishap\" experienced by Mathieu Amalric during the editing and mixing of Wimbledon Stadium.\nCritical reception.\nMathieu Amalric's adaptation of Daniele Del Giudice's novel was judged to be convincingly faithful to the spirit of the book. For \"Les Inrocks\", the Wimbledon Stadium is a \"strange, poetic work\", with which the film critic, enthusiastically, considers that Mathieu Amalric has totally succeeded in \"overcoming the formidable hurdle of the second film, but also [given] confirmation of a true filmmaker's eye \". This observation is shared in the same journal by Serge Kaganski, for whom Amalric is no longer just an actor, but has become a \"very good filmmaker\" who must be perceived as such \"in the eyes of the public \", as well as by the editors of \"Cahiers du cinéma\" and \"Positif\", for whom this film confirms the hopes placed in Amalric as a filmmaker. Jean Antoine Gili, Positif's specialist on Italian cinema, adds that this work achieves a beautiful \"narrative development\" and the \"portrait of a character in hollow\" without falling into \"pure intellectual data\", thanks to a \"figurative concretization\" that relies on the way Trieste is filmed as a central subject \"that secretes mystery and strangeness \", while Cahiers du cinéma similarly concludes that, to the question \"how do you film emptiness? \"the director proposes the solution of permanent displacements in space and time within the city, where the \"own pulsation\" of each place is depicted. Philippe Azoury, the first French critic to review the film at Locarno, wrote in \"Libération\" that he \"came away from this journey full of a beautiful, dark Adriatic melancholy \". In their 2003 Annuel du cinéma, Les Fiches du cinéma describe the film as a \"philosophical and literary quest for the self\" served up by a \"magnificent Jeanne Balibar, both determined and dreamy\". The book underlines the director's desire to make a work about \"the emptiness and vertigo of decided non-creativity\", which results in a film that is \"mobile, physical, yet introspective and contemplative, with a powerful charm\", and is particularly enthusiastic about its \"rigorous direction\" and \"beautiful framing and lighting \". \"Télérama\" magazine sees in this film a \"surprising self-portrait of the filmmaker as... Jeanne Balibar\", pointing out that this work reveals the filmmaker's \"sort of maladjustment to practical reality, a reluctance to inhabit the immediate present in favor of the before or after \". In a similar vein, the weekly highlights the work of cinematographer Christophe Beaucarne, whose \"elegant framing and natural lighting\", combined with that of composer Grégoire Hetzel, help create a \"beautiful film on its own\" with \"acute sensations \". The work's mastery of shots has been compared to that of films by Michelangelo Antonioni or Wim Wenders.\nRelatively negative, the critic from \"La Dépêche du Midi\" considers that the director's approach of making \"cinema out of nothing [...] isn't always enough\", resulting in \"emptiness\" despite the \"elegance [and] 'intelligence'\" of his filming style. The same reticence was expressed in similar terms in \"L'Express\" on the DVD release in 2007, which noted that the film \"lacks [a] little surprise to be completely convincing\", despite the luminous presence of Jeanne Balibar.\nIn the English-speaking world, reviews are divided. In the UK, Le Stade de Wimbledon was well received, described as \"a typically European film of ideas and mood, which is a beautiful, open, enigmatic fable\", aptly likening its ending to that of Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow-Up (1966). When the film was released in the U.S. in March 2002 at the \"Rendez-Vous\" Festival of French Cinema at Lincoln Center in New York, the reception was more decided. On the one hand, IndieWire's critic enthused about the film, calling it \"the most valuable discovery [of the festival], [...] small on plot, big on ideas\", noting in particular the \"sincere, delicate style, genuine tenderness [...] or deep love for each of the characters\". In contrast, Variety considers the film \"an arty treat that seems to outlast its meager 70 minutes\" made for independent film festivals, judging - in a major departure - that the \"painterly photography is either unnecessarily oblique or captivatingly mysterious\".\nAnalysis.\nBook survey.\nWhile the Wimbledon Stadium remains a film of self-inspection - described by one academic in 2009 as Mathieu Amalric's \"autoscopy by proxy\", an analysis confirmed by Amalric himself - in which an author examines the need for, and motivations behind, literary and, more broadly, artistic creation, it is also, on the filmmaker's part, a film in the negative of his previous, highly autobiographical opus, \"Mange ta soupe\" (Eat Your Soup), released in 1997. In contrast, both are about books and their approach: the overflow of books in the first feature, to the point of suffocation in the literal sense with the collapse of a library and the burial of the main character, is followed by an absence of books in the second; the second film, on the other hand, replaces a desperate search for non-existent books and an \"en-quête\" into an unpublished writer in a city paradoxically teeming with illustrious literary ghosts; a film \"\"en plein\" on the question of remembrance is followed by a film \"en creux\"\" on the search for a missing person. To this can be added the film's transformation of the name \"Bazlen\" into \"Wohler\", which is highly significant phonetically, without it being obvious to whom it belongs - the writer Bazlen, the novelist Del Giudice or the filmmaker Amalric (or all of them at once), while noting that the latter has often declared, in his own regard, that he acts like a \"vampire\" in the making of his films.\nFilmmaker Arnaud Larrieu offers an analysis in which he considers this work to be a \"portrait film\", but one that is constructed in a complex way, since it is not played out as a two-way mirror (that of the model and the artist depicting him), but as a four-way one, involving the young woman and her quest for authorship, as well as the city of Trieste and the filmmaker's own quest. The magazines Positif and Télérama make a similar analysis, calling the transposition of Daniele Del Giudice into Mathieu Amalric and himself into Jeanne Balibar \"highly productive of meaning \". As she is not named once in the entire film, just as the narrator-investigator was not named in the novel, \"Elle\" is all the more able to embody several beings at once, in a reflexive manner, as her person is further effaced behind the meaning, nature and object of her literary quest. Apart from the apparent solitude, perhaps even emotional solitude, that surrounds the investigator, nothing indicative of her private life, experiences or personality shines through, thus further reinforcing the pre-eminence of the film's fundamental object (the quest) over its subject (the woman who carries it out). To transpose this into the image, Mathieu Amalric imposes on the viewer, from the very start of the film, to follow, a few meters back, the evolution of the different stages of this search, filming Jeanne Balibar from behind as she movesor in long travellings. To do this, he uses the cinematic codes of the detective story: a quasi-police investigation, with written or voice-over reports; a transformation of Bobi Wohler's character into a virtual MacGuffin; strolls through the city streets, like a detective in a raincoat.\nThe importance of location and light.\nTo address these themes, the city of Trieste, with its particularly rich literary past, offers a significant setting used by Daniele Del Giudice at the heart of his novel, and fully preserved by the director for his film, which maintains the mystery of the city, its \"own palpitations\" with multiple confluences and influences, marked by the history of Mitteleuropa. However, despite the softness of the lights and the passing of the seasons, the mystery of Triest is not devoid of an element of anguish, which is particularly evident in the windsurfing scene at sea, where the narrator suddenly sees a figurative - and perhaps reflective of her personal life - abyss opening up beneath her, as indicated by her cry of anguish in the London night after a failed evening in a pub - that marks a climax with the state of her own research and her confrontation with the absence of totally satisfactory answers and reasons to explain Bobi Wohler/Bazlen's literary rejection. This state of unaccomplishment, this fictional psychological stage that gave the novel its title, reaches a climax at the end of the narrator's quest, when she finds herself facing the emptiness of the Wimbledon tennis center court (and alone with herself), where even the lines of the playing court are absent, like a totally blank page, to be written or never written. Jean-Paul Manganaro, in a study published in 2001, underlines this constancy of \"impediment, failure and incompletion\" in Daniele Del Giudice's work, which is marked by \"wandering, the wandering of the narrator in her own history\" within the research she has undertaken - which brings more questions than answers, and whose subject, Bazlen, becomes \"vanifie\" as it progresses - and by the \"fractioning\" of spaces, whether place or journey, into smaller spaces.In numerous interviews, Mathieu Amalric has also stressed the importance of natural light in the city at the time of shooting. Apart from a few location scouts for certain scenes in which the sun's reflections play on the walls (in the cafés), the main thing was to \"catch the world's photogenic light \" as and when it presented itself, as we wandered the streets, beaches and places of Trieste. Light thus becomes one of the director's strategies for \"filming the void \" - that is, the absence of books, writers and history - thus making full use of the specificity of cinema vis-à-vis literature.\nSee Also.\nNovel: Le Stade de Wimbledon by Daniele Del Giudice \nShort film: Malus by Mathieu Amalric"

        "text": "The Guelph Gryphons men's ice hockey team is an active ice hockey program representing the Guelph Gryphons athletic department of the University of Guelph. The team has been active since the formation of the college in 1964 and is currently a member of the Ontario University Athletics conference under the authority of U Sports. The Gryphons play at the Gryphon Centre in Guelph, Ontario.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nOne of Guelph's predecessor schools, the Ontario Agricultural College, began fielding an ice hockey team at least as far back as 1898. As a small school, OAC played at the intermediate level of the Ontario Hockey Association but only did so sparingly. In the early 20th century, the Redmen also played in the Intermediate Intercollegiate Series but, as most colleges did, suspended play for the duration of World War I. After the war, OAC would play off an on for much of the 1920s and 30s. In the early 40s, the team attempted to play through World War II but eventually suspended play in 1945.\nReturn to play.\nIn 1950, Ontario Agricultural College resumed play but remained an independent program. Its unclear at this time whether or not the school still operated at the intermediate level or if they had joined the senior level of college hockey yet. OAC soldiered on with their club for over a decade before finally joining the Quebec–Ontario Athletic Association in 1961. The team played for two seasons before sitting out the 1964 years while the University of Guelph was being formed.\nOntario Veterinary College.\nThere is some indication that the Ontario Veterinary College played as a member of the Ontario Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1964. Records from Toronto Metropolitan include two matches against 'OAVC' in 1964, which could have been a combined team from OAC and OVC. In any event, the league played at the intermediate level and is not officially recognized by the university.\nGuelph.\nOnce the first official team from Guelph hit the ice, the Gryphons found themselves with a tough row to hoe. The new club rejoined the QOAA and saw lean years for the duration of the 1960s. It wasn't until 1970 that the Gryphons were able to get out of the conference cellar and they weren't able to produce a winning season until 1972, the first year of play in the OUAA. Over the course of the 70s, Guelph steadily improved and the team won its first league championship in 1976. Guelph finished as runners-up for the national title that year and returned to the tournament in both 1979 and 1980. Afterwards, the program flagged and saw mostly losing seasons until the early 1990s.\nChampionship.\nThe Gryphons rebuilt into a powerhouse, routinely winning their division while making several trips to the league final. Guelph won two OUAA championships in the mid-90s and appeared in 4 national tournaments in 5 years. Their successful run culminated with the 1997 CIAU championship. Afterwards, Guelph remained a strong team in the conference but they spent most of the next 20 years failing to make the national series. In 2015, Guelph won a stunning league championship despite having a losing record in the regular season. The Gryphons continued their inspired run and finished with the bronze medal at the 2015 CIS University Cup. Before the decade was out, Guelph made two more appearances in the national tournament but neither saw them win a game.\nSeason-by-season results.\nIntermediate and collegiate play.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\"\nSenior collegiate play.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\"\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The Ontario Intercollegiate Athletic Association ice hockey tournament was an annual conference championship held between member teams.\nHistory.\nWith college hockey expanding in Canada throughout the 1950s, many colleges in Ontario were looking to establish themselves but faced a difficult challenge. The major programs of the day would not have given their newer, smaller counterparts much room with which to grow. An intermediate league, the Ottawa–St. Lawerence Conference, had already been formed but many other programs did not want to take on the expense of travelling several hundred miles for second-tier collegiate games. By 1958, enough programs were operating in southern Ontario to form a new intermediate league. The Ontario Intercollegiate Athletic Association began with five teams around the western edge of Lake Ontario. The league remained unchanged for four years when two teams left for the top tier Quebec–Ontario Athletic Association. In their place, five new programs were added in 1962. After the league's first season as an team-conference, the OIAA petitioned to receive a bid to the U Sports men's ice hockey championship. The league's bid was rejected and the conference responded by disbanding mid-way through the following year. In the summer of 1964, the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union reconsidered their position and agreed to invite the OIAA champion to participate.\nWhen the league reformed, the teams were divided into two groups and the winner of each group would play for the league championship. After two teams withdrew that offseason, the group format was abandoned, as was the tournament. The OIAA would award the championship to the team that finished with the best regular season record for four years before restarting the tournament in 1970. In 1971, the four leagues in Ontario and Quebec were realigned along provincial borders and the OIAA ceased to exist.\nTournaments.\n1964.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"no playoffs\"\n1966.\n\"no playoffs\"\n1967.\n\"no playoffs\"\n1968.\n\"no playoffs\"\n1969.\n\"no playoffs\"\nExternal links.\nConcordia Stingers Championships"

The team has been active since the late 1960s and is currently a member of the Ontario University Athletics conference under the authority of U Sports. The Badgers play at the Meridian Centre in St. Catharines, Ontario.\nTeam history.\nHistory.\nBrock founded its ice hockey program in 1967 and joined the Ontario Intercollegiate Athletic Association (OIAA). While the team struggled to win on the ice, the Generals made CIAU history in just their second year. Michael Nicholson was named team captain for the '69 season, becoming the first black player to captain a Canadian college program. In spite of their landmark captain, the team struggled to win for many years. After joining the Ontario University Athletic Association in 1971, the disparity in play only became more stark and Brock went through another five years of futility.\nIn 1977, after going winless the year before, Brock suddenly produced its first winning season and made their first playoff appearance. Unfortunately, that success was short-lived and the team did not have another winning campaign for 11 years. Once the 1990s rolled around, the Badgers finally found their footing and started looking like they belonged in the conference. While the team found modest success in the early part of the 21st century, it wasn't until 2008 that the Badgers were finally able to make their first appearance in the national tournament. \nSeason-by-season results.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\""

        "text": "The 1925–26 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 9th season of play for the program. The Eagles were coached by Fred Rocque in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nAfter the departure of Charles Foote as head coach, the Eagles welcomed Fred Rocque back as their bench boss. The biggest task at the outset was getting a very raw into shape as most of the experienced players had graduated the previous spring. The team played well in their opening match of the year, albeit against weak competition. Several days of hard practice followed in order to get ready for the invaders from the north. Just before Christmas, the team arranged a game against Pere Marquette, an amateur club made up of BC alumni, and the new boys looked be the equals of Eagle teams past. Unfortunately for the Eagles, their next opponent was one of the best amateur teams in all of Canada and they were unable to halt the attack from Toronto.\nThe next two games for the Eagles came at the brand new Madison Square Garden and they displayed a fine form by winning two games against Canadian colleges. Mullowney, one of the few returning starters, was particularly noteworthy against Montreal, scoring twice while also holding the Carabins' offense at bay. The team's difficult slate of games caught up to them afterwards, however, and BC dropped each of their next five matches. By the time the team halted for the exam break the once-high hopes for the season had been shattered. Even worse, a match with Army had to be scrapped on account of the weather, leaving Boston University as the only American college left on their schedule. A rematch with Pere Marquette to end the first half of the season capped off the losing streak and saw few in attendance, though the explanation given was that students were busy studying.\nUpon their return from the break, the team got into a pitched battle with rival BU. The game was a fast, physical affair that saw many checks thrown by both sides but neither team was willing to give an inch. Mike Dee, getting his first turn as the starting netminder, but things got off to a poor start when a puck leaked through his legs for the first goal. Afterwards, Dee made up for the mistake with an inspired performance that allowed the Eagles to gain and hold the lead. Red Groden tied the match in the second while Ed Mullowney scored the winning marker in the third to give BC the lead for the Winsor Cup.\nA week later, the team took a trip north to Montreal for a pair of games. After losing to an amateur team on the first night, the Eagles salvaged the weekend with a win over Loyola thanks to Cronin and Groden both scoring twice in the match. The Eagles had a long layoff before their next game but hard practices from coach Rocque prevent any rust from accumulating. The third match with Pere Marquette was just as tightly contested as the others but this time BC was able to come away with a draw. The following night, with bragging right on the line, BC was swamped by BU, due in no small part to the absence of Frank Mahoney. The Eagles held firm for the first part of the game but were dealt a second blow when Mullowney was cut above the knee by one of his teammates. After he was taken to the hospital for treatment, Boston College was a shell of itself and Boston University took full advantage. BU scored three times in the third to take the match and tie the season series.\nTwo weeks later, the team's season came to a close when they met the Canadian amateur champion, Ottawa Burgs. The win ended the season on a high note but the lack of intercollegiate matches left the Eagles unable to compete for a championship with their peers.\nGeorge L. O'Brien served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "1977 United States Boxing Championships Series",
        "text": "The 1977 United States Boxing Championships Series, also known internationally as the Ring Magazine Scandal was a controversial professional boxing tournament which was organized by American boxing promoter Don King, and which involved fights that were telecast on American television network ABC. The tournament was ultimately cancelled because a duo composed of New York City writer Malcolm \"Flash\" Gordon and television sportscaster Alex Wallau discovered that there were many fraudulent concerns around it, including falsified boxer records and fighter rankings.\nBoxing magazine \"The Ring\" was also involved, as one of their assistant editors fixed ratings at that magazine to make certain boxers look better to viewers.\nBackground.\nMalcolm \"Flash\" Gordon was a boxing writer from Sunnyside, New York, who published a boxing zine named \"Tonight's Boxing Program and Weekly Newsletter\" from his apartment in Queens from the 1960s to the mid 1980s. He would handle these zines personally outside the Madison Square Garden before fight shows at the coliseum.\nMeanwhile, in the United States, 1976 had been their year of their Bicentennial celebration. 500,000 people had viewed the U.S. Capitol's bicentennial parade that year and Americans were, generally speaking, still in a festive mood when 1977 arrived. There was a palpable sense of patriotism in the country during this era. Don King, the promoter from Cleveland, Ohio, decided to capitalize on that patriotism as well as on the success of five Americans in amateur boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics (Sugar Ray Leonard, Leon and Michael Spinks, Howard Davis and Leo Randolph, each of whom had won gold medals) so he created the tournament.\nTournament.\nAmong the boxers who fought in the tournament was Minnesota's noted heavyweight contender, Scott LeDoux. LeDoux fought Johnny Boudreaux, an American of African descent, on February 13, 1977, at the Halsey Field House in Annapolis, Maryland. He lost by unanimous eight-rounds decision despite dropping Boudreaux in round three. Edwin Viruet, a Puerto Rican boxer, also fought as part of the tournament in the lightweight division on that program, knocking out Tommy Rose in four rounds. Two more bouts that were part of the U.S. championships took place on that program: one was a Middleweight contest, Leo Saenz vs. Casey Gacic, and the other one was a featherweight one between Richard Rozelle and Davey Vazquez.\nA melee ensued after the decision was announced for the Boudreaux-LeDoux bout, where LeDoux punched Boudreaux on camera and television broadcaster Howard Cosell's hairpiece fell off. LeDoux claimed that he had been told about the fight's result beforehand and that Boudreaux was among a group of fighters managed by King, Paddy Flood and Al Braverman, who (the fighters) had been previously assigned to win the tournament fights. The contest caused a grand jury investigation.\nOn March 6, 1977, bouts took place at the Marion County Institution, a jail in Marion, Ohio. That day's fights included a non-tournament bout by Puerto Rican Wilfred Benitez as well as tournament fights involving such boxers as Ruben Castillo, Stan Ward of California and others. Joe Louis, the former world heavyweight champion, was ringside and former heavyweight contender Pete Rademacher was the referee of one of the contests.\nThe FBI, an American federal investigative group, initiated an investigation soon after the February 13 show. In addition, a boxer named Kenny Weldon alleged that he had to pay $2,300 dollars out of his purse to be allowed to participate.\nMalcolm Gordon, the New York City boxing writer, meanwhile, had begun to notice that small-time boxing managers had begun to be associated with Don King, and he also noticed those managers' club fighters had begun to climb on the rankings of \"The Ring\" magazine. Alex Wallau of ABC also noticed the trend. Wallau began to worry about the quality of the boxers King was feeding ABC for their televised matches. Separately, Gordon began his own investigation into the matter.\n\"The Ring\", the prestigious boxing magazine, had been involved in the scandal since 1976, because one of the magazine's then assistant editors, Johnny Ort, had been elevating boxer rankings since 1976 and publishing about fights that never took place for those boxers, and so then updating those boxers' fight records to reflect such non-existent bouts in order for them to be accepted into the tournament by ABC. Gordon and Wallau discovered this.\nAnother prominent boxer who participated at the tournament was Floyd Mayweather Sr. Future WBC world Super-Lightweight (Junior Welterweight) champion Saoul Mamby also participated; on April 2 (the same day of Ruben Castillo's semi-finals fight), he beat Mike Everett in a semi-final of the series' Super-Lightweight tournament at San Antonio, Texas by a ten-rounds unanimous decision, with Mamby allowed to compete despite being one pound over that division's weight limit of 140 pounds.\nCancellation.\nOn April 14 of 1977, ABC, which had paid $1.5 million dollars for the rights to cover the tournament on television, announced they would suspend all future broadcasts of fights included in the tournament, one day before a semi-finals card would be held in Miami, Florida, following the allegations made by Weldon and other boxers and the internal investigation led by Gordon and Wallau. \nAfter Gordon and Wallau's evidence was presented to Roone Arledge of ABC, the United States Championship tournament was cancelled. The scandal would lead to the eventual resignation of New York State Boxing Commissioner James A. Farley Jr., who had lent his name to the championship tournament's fights.\nAftermath.\nMalcolm \"Flash\" Gordon kept publishing his newsletter until the middle 1980s. He allegedly became a recluse and is suspected of having died around 2017.\nWallau went on to become a two-time Emmy Award-winning producer and director of ABC's sports coverage. He worked primarily on ABC's boxing coverage with announcer Cosell. In 1986, after Cosell's retirement, Wallau became ABC's boxing analyst. He was honored by the Boxing Writers Association of America as the top television boxing journalist in his first year.\nWallau moved into management under Bob Iger in 1993 and was named president of ABC in 2000, with oversight of 11 divisions, including Entertainment, News, Sports, Finance &amp; Sales. In 2007, he joined the Walt Disney Company's Corporate Strategy, Business Development &amp; Technology Group as senior strategic advisor. In 2017, he moved to the new DTCI division which created new streaming services including Disney+. He retired in 2020.\nHe has served on the board of directors of ESPN, the Ad Council and the Paley Center for Media. In 2006, Wallau was honored by UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center with their Humanitarian Award. Wallau is a cancer survivor.\nKing continued to promote fights well into his 90s. \nABC's coverage of professional boxing fights continued for decades."

        "text": "The Rome Romans were a minor league baseball team based in Rome, Georgia. Between 1910 and 1916, the \"Romans\" played as members of the Class D level Georgia–Alabama League, winning the 1916 league championship. The team continued Georgia–Alabama League play in 1917 known as the \"Rome-Lindale Romans\" followed by Rome teams of the 1920 and 1921 Class D level Georgia State League.\nThe Rome Romans hosted home minor league games at the Rome ballpark, then called \"Hamilton Park,\" on the site of today's Barron Stadium.\nThe Rome Red Sox of 1950 and 1951 seasons followed and preceded today's Rome Emperors team of the South Atlantic League, who began play in 2003 as the Rome Braves.\nHistory.\n1910 to 1917 - Three leagues, one championship.\nThe 1903 \"Rome Romans\" first appeared in references as members of the four-team Alabama–Georgia League. No information about the Rome team or league rosters and records are known. League teams had collegiate players on their rosters. Players were housed with host families, as the Anniston Invincibles team dominated the league compiling a 42–11 record before disbanding due to the lack of competition among the rest of the teams.\nThe Rome Romans began minor league play in 1910 and were followed by the Rome-Lindale Romans who played in 1917 as members of the Class D level Georgia–Alabama League. The Rome team proceeded to play the 1920 and 1921 seasons as members of the Class D level Georgia State League.\nThe \"Romans\" nickname for the baseball team correlates to local history, as the city is named for Rome, Italy. A Roman labyrinth was constructed in Rome, Georgia in honor of their Roman lineage.\nIn 1910, the Rome Romans began minor league play when the Romans team was formed and became charter members of the six-team Class D level Southeastern League. The Asheville Moonshiners, Gadsden Steel Makers, Johnson City Soldiers, Knoxville Appalachians and Morristown Jobbers teams joined with Rome in beginning league play on June 8, 1910.\nEnding the 1910 season with a record of 44–41, Rome finished in a fourth-place tie with Anniston, who had the identical record. Playing the Southeastern League season under managers Joe Patton, C.G. Milford and Walter Justus, Rome ended the season 8.5 games behind the first place Knoxville Appalachians in the final standings. Roy Thrasher, who split the season between Ashville and Rome, won the league batting title, hitting .324 and also led the league in stolen bases.\nThe 1911 Rome Romans continued Southeastern League play, with only the Gadson team joining Rome in returning to the league, as four new franchises were added. Gadson and Rome were joined by the Anniston Models, Decatur Twins, Huntsville Westerns and Selma Centralites teams in the six-team league, which began play on May 8, 1911. The 1911 Rome team was also called the \"Hillies\" and Rome was the only league team not located in Alabama for the 1911 season. With a record of 47–54, Rome placed fourth out of the six teams, playing under managers Carlton Beusse and Danny Burt. First place Anniston finished 18.0 games ahead of Rome in the final standings of the Southeastern League, which held no playoffs\nOn August 3, 1912, Georgia native Carl East made his professional debut with the Rome Romans as a pitcher. East advanced and made the major leagues as a pitcher with the St. Louis Browns in 1915. Then, after being sent back to the minor leagues, East left pitching and became an outfielder and again advanced to play for the 1924 Washington Senators. In 1924, East left the Senators to take a more lucrative contract with a team in Beloit, Wisconsin. East once had an outfield collision with future Baseball Hall of Fame member Jocko Conlan while playing in the minors in 1920. East was knocked unconscious in the collision, but remained in the game and hit a single, double, and home run.\nThe 1912 Rome Romans continued play as members of the Southeastern League, but the league folded before the end of the regular season. The league began play on April 5, 1912. After beginning the second half of the split-season schedule on July 22, the league disbanded August 2, 1912. The league folded with the following official second half standings: Gadsden (7–4), Talladega Highlanders (5-5), Selma (5–6), and Rome (5–7). Rome ended the 1912 season with an overall record of 40–43, finishing in fourth place, as Matty Matthews served as manager. The Romans ended the season 9.0 games behind first place Gadsen.\nFollowing the folding of the Southeastern League, 1913 Rome Romans played one season as members of the six–team, Class D level Appalachian League. After the conclusion of the 1912 season, the Morristown Jobbers team of the Appalachian League relocated their franchise to Rome for the 1913 league season and Rome joined the new league. It would ultimately be the only season for Rome as members of the league. The Bristol Boosters, Cleveland Counts, Johnson City Soldiers, Knoxville Reds and Middlesboro Colonels teams joined the Rome Romans in beginning league play on May 8, 1913.\nThe Rome Romans placed fifth in the 1913 Appalachian League final standings. Rome ended the 1913 season with a record of 45–56 as Jack Reidy served as manager. The Romans finished 19.5 games behind the first place Johnson City in the final standings, as the league held no playoffs. John Cochran led the Appalachian League with 20 home runs. His 87 runs and 151 total hits also led the league. After the season, the Appalachian League reduced to four teams for the 1914 season and Rome did not return to the league, which played with the Harriman Boosters, Knoxville, Middlesboro Colonels and Morristown Jobbers teams in 1914 before disbanding during the season.\nWith the Appalachian League reducing to four teams, the Rome Romans continued play in 1914, as the ream became members the eight-team Class D level Georgia–Alabama League. The league expanded from six teams to eight teams. The returning Anniston Moulders, Gadsden Steel Makers, LaGrange Terrapins, Newnan Cowetas, Opelika Opelicans and Talladega Indians were the returning member teams and joined with the expansion Rome Romans and Selma River Rats in beginning league play on May 5, 1913.\nThe Romans placed fifth in the final standings as the league expanded from six teams to eight teams for the 1914 season. The Romans ended the 1914 season with a record of 45–56, to finish in fifth place out of the eight teams. Playing the season under returning Manager Jack Reidy, Rome finished 3.0 games behind the first place Selma River Rats in the final standings. Player manager Jack Reidy led the league with 76 runs scored and 117 hits.\nThe 1915 Alabama–Georgia League played a shortened season, ending play on July 14, 1915. The Newnan Cowetas were in first place when the season ended and Rome placed fourth. The Romans ended their shortened 1915 season with a record of 27–31, placing fourth out of the six league teams. Manager Art Burleson managed the team. Rome ended the season 11.0 games behind first place Newnan in the final standings. Rome's George Cochran scored 47 runs to lead the Alabama–Georgia League.\nDespite folding during the season before, the Georgia–Alabama League reformed in 1916, playing a planned shortened season and the Rome Romans captured the league championship. The league folded on July 22, 1916, with Rome in first place in the league standings. Playing the season under manager Frank Manush, the Rome Romans ended the season with a record of 41–26, finishing 3.0 games ahead of the second place Newnan Cowetas in the final standings, as the league ended play early as scheduled on July 22. Ben Shaw of Rome lead the league with 89 total hits and Rome pitcher Joseph Wiley tied for the Georgia–Alabama League lead with 15 wins. \nThe Georgia–Alabama League continued play in 1917, and the renamed \"Rome-Lindale Romans\" were the defending champions in the six-team league. Remaining based in Rome, the team was named in partnership with nearby Lindale, Georgia and continued play at the Rome Ball Park. On May 23, 1917, the Georgia-Alabama League folded. In the brief season, the Rome-Lindale team finished with a record of 9–9 to place fourth in the final standings when the league stopped play. Playing the brief season under manager Daniel Overton, the Romans finished 4.0 games behind the first place Anniston Moulders in the final standings. The Georgia-Alabama League did not return to play in the 1918 season. The Georgia–Alabama League did not return to play in 1918 and there were only ten total minor leagues that played the season in 1918 due to World War I.\n1920 to 1921 - Georgia State League.\nThe 1920 Rome Romans resumed minor league play, as the team became members of the reformed six–team Class D level Georgia State League. The Carrollton, Cedartown Cedars, Griffin, LaGrange and Lindale Pepperells teams joined Rome in beginning league play on May 20, 1920.\nPitcher Red Lucas played for Rome in 1920. Living in Nashville, Tennessee in 1920, where his father worked in a factory, Lucas was 20-years old and pitching in an amateur Nashville City league. Major league pitcher Tom \"Shotgun\" Rogers saw him pitch and subsequently took Lucas to a try-out in 1920. He was signed to a contract with Bartow Polkers in the Florida State League but was quickly released. Back in Nashville and in attendance at a local ballgame, Lucas received a telegram telling him to report to Rome in the Georgia State League immediately. Rome signed him and he finished the 1920 season with the team. Lucas played for the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates in a seventeen-year major league career. Lucas gave up home run number 712 to Babe Ruth on May 25, 1935, the day Ruth hit his last three career home runs. Lucas is in the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.\nRome finished the 1920 season with a record of 50–40. The Romans placed second in the Georgia State League standings, playing the season under manager Tim Bowden, Rome finished 5.0 games behind the first place Carrollton team in the final standings of the six-team league.\nOn August 13, 1921, pitcher C.

Rome finished with a record of 50–48, placing fourth in the 1921 standings of the eight-team league. Playing under manager James C. Fox, Rome finished 17.5 games behind the first place Lindale team in the regular season standings. In the league playoff, the LaGrange team defeated the Lindell 4 games to 1 to win the championship. The Georgia State League permanently folded after the 1921 season, leaving the Rome team without a league membership for nearly 30 years.\nRome next hosted minor league play in 1950, when the Rome Red Sox rejoined the eight-team Class D level Georgia–Alabama League after a 33-season absence from the league. Despite being called the \"Red Sox,\" the 1950 team was a minor league affiliate of the Washington Senators. The Alexander City Millers, Carrollton Hornets, Griffin Tigers, LaGrange Troupers, Newnan Brownies, Opelika Owls and Valley Rebels joined the Red Sox in 1950 league play.\nThe Georgia–Alabama League permanently folded following the 1951 season. Rome was without minor league baseball until 2003, when the Rome Braves began play as members of the Class A level South Atlantic League.\nThe ballpark.\nIn the seasons between 1910 and 1921, the Rome minor league teams hosted minor league home games exclusively at the Rome Ball Park. The site of the ballpark and athletic field was originally known as \"Hamilton Field\". The newly built stadium portion of the parcel was renamed \"Barron Stadium\" in 1925 after local businessman William F. Barron, who helped acquire the property, which had been private. Barron's father was also a local business man and founded the a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Rome in 1901. Today, the site remains an athletic facility for Rome high school and youth teams and is home to Barron Stadium, named for the Barrons.

The ballpark is located at 755 Braves Boulevard in Rome, Georgia."

Rumored future sites for the event included Mexico City, Tokyo, Caracas, and Seattle.\nHowever, the event was a financial disaster.

A member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Stephens was an honor society student at Columbia and was named the football team's most valuable player as a senior in 1977, graduating in 1978 with a degree in economics.\nStephens went unselected in the 1978 NFL Draft, but was signed as an undrafted free agent by the New York Jets to play wide receiver. He made the team out of training camp as a return specialist. He appeared in six games and had three kickoff returns for 42 yards with a long of 16, although in one game he had a 68-yard return that was called back by penalty. He was placed on injured reserve in October, ending his season. He was the team's returner in preseason in 1979 but was released after fumbling a kickoff."

The French were beaten 19–21, with Blond giving away a costly nine-points through penalties. He was considered fortunate not to have been sent off in the second half for a shove on referee Les Peard.\nIn 1994, Blond played in the series-securing 2nd Test win over the All Blacks at Eden Park on the tour of New Zealand.

        "title": "World Baseball Classic Rules",
        "text": "Table introducing The World Baseball Classic Rules\nEligibility.\nIn addition to the standard rules of baseball, the World Baseball Classic employs the following additional rules:\nA player is eligible to participate on a World Baseball Classic team if any one of the following criteria is met:\nPitch counts.\nA pitcher cannot pitch more than:\nA pitcher can still finish a batter's plate appearance even if the limit is reached, but must come out after completing the plate appearance.\nA pitcher cannot pitch until:\nMercy rules.\nTo prevent one-sided contests, games are ended early if one team is ahead by:\nThese mercy rules do not apply during the knockout stage.\nDesignated hitter.\nThe designated hitter rule applies for all games.\nExtra innings.\nFrom 2009 through 2017, starting with the 11th inning, teams automatically start with runners on first and second base. The baserunners are the players in the two batting order positions previous to the leadoff batter for the inning (or substitutes called in to pinch-run for those players). Organizers put this rule in place starting with the 2009 tournament, although originally, it did not come into effect until the 13th inning. The intention behind the rule is to help ensure extra-inning games end in as timely a manner as possible, reducing the chance of seeing marathon extra-inning games that place undue strain on players, particularly pitchers. As no extra-inning games in either the 2009 or 2013 WBCs reached the point where the rule came into play, it took until the 2017 WBC for it to affect a game's outcome. There were three such games in 2017, and all three were decided in the 11th inning.\nIn 2023, the rule was changed to bring the WBC in line with Major League Baseball. The 2023 World Baseball Classic rules and regulations reads: \"For any inning beginning with the 10th inning, the Federation Team at bat shall begin the inning with a runner on second base. The batter who leads off an inning shall continue to be the batter who would lead off the inning in the absence of this extra-innings rule. The runner on second base shall be the player (or a substitute for such player) in the batting order immediately preceding the batter who leads off the inning.\"\nVideo replay review.\nBeginning in the 2023 World Baseball Classic, video review is available for all situations as it would be during a Major League Baseball regular season game.\nRun differential.\nUnlike regular season play, where the number of runs by which a team wins a game is not relevant, the number of runs by which a WBC team wins may be relevant if a tie later develops in the standings. In such cases, teams are ranked by their Team Quality Balance, which rewards them for scoring by as many runs as possible, and for winning with as few of their batters getting out as possible when batting in the bottom of the inning. This caused problems during the 2013 WBC, where one game spawned a bench-clearing brawl between the Canadian and Mexican teams (Canadian hitter Chris Robinson had bunted for a base hit after Canada had already taken a large lead, causing Mexican pitcher Arnold Leon to throw three consecutive pitches at the next hitter, Rene Tosoni).\nThese tiebreakers were changed starting in the 2017 WBC to be \"fewest runs allowed per inning of defense in head-to-head games\", which still places an emphasis on scoring as many runs as possible (whilst also allowing the fewest runs as possible)."

The event was sponsored by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and at the urging of Major League players in the wake of King's assassination in 1968.\nTaking place in Dodger Stadium, the game involved 23 current and future Hall of Famers participating as players, coaches, and managers. Each of the then-24 Major League Baseball teams sent two players and teams were divided up into \"East\" and \"West\". The East won the game by 5–1 with Ron Fairly being named MVP of the game. Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King, was on hand to throw the ceremonial first pitch. Also in attendance was Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball.\nBackground.\nSoon after the assassination of Martin Luther King, a number of major league players wrote to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), asking what they could do to honor the memory of King. In November 1968, Joseph Peters, the sports project director for the SCLC, wrote to William Eckert, then the Commissioner of Baseball:\nInitially meant to held in 1969, the game was postponed to 1970 at the request of the SCLC to allow for more time to prepare and organize. It was announced that the game would be held in Dodger Stadium, with each of the 24 Major League Baseball teams sending out two players. Further, teams were to be divided by Eastern and Western divisions. The proceeds from the game would go to programs of the SCLC and The King Center being established in Atlanta.\nPlayers and managers were selected by the Los Angeles chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Joe DiMaggio, recently retired from his role as executive and coach for the Oakland Athletics, was chosen as the manager of the East. He subsequently chose Billy Martin, Hank Bauer, John McNamara, and Satchel Paige as his coaches. Roy Campanella was chose to manager the West and chose Sandy Koufax, Stan Musial, Don Drysdale, Don Newcombe, and Elston Howard as his coaches. Campanella put on his Dodgers jersey for the first time since his last game, before the automobile accident which left him wheelchair bound.\nGame.\nPre-game ceremonies.\nThe game was held on March 28, 1970. During the pre-game ceremonies, a recording of King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech was played over the Dodger Stadium loudspeakers and remarks were made by Reverend H. H. Brookins, president of the SCLC West, SCLC president Reverend Ralph Abernathy, and by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. Pitcher Mudcat Grant sang the national anthem and Coretta Scott King threw the first pitch.\nIn attendance were numerous African-American firsts in Major League Baseball in various capacities: Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball, attended the game as a spectator; Larry Doby, the first African-American to play in the American League, attended the game in uniform (at the time, he was coach with the Montreal Expos); the home plate umpire was Emmett Ashford, the first African-American umpire in the Major Leagues.\nPlayers voluntarily attended to play in the game despite the fact that spring training was ongoing. Notably, Willie Mays flew from Japan where the San Francisco Giants were playing exhibition games, later saying: \"It was too important to pass up.\"\nGame play.\nTom Seaver, starting pitcher for the East, and Bob Gibson, coming in on relief, shut out the West for six innings. Ron Fairly and Ron Santo both hit solo home runs for the East, giving them an early lead. Grant Jackson threw a scoreless seventh before giving up a run to the West. On the top of the eight, Mudcat Grant allowed three runs in the eighth, giving the East the lead: Al Kaline singled to open the inning, Lou Brock doubled to score Kaline, and Roberto Clemente doubled to score Brock.\nThe East won the game 5–1, with Fairly being named the game's MVP. He was presented the MVP trophy by Coretta Scott King."

Teams are seeded based on their performance within the conference, and teams with identical conference records are seeded using a tiebreaker system. \nAs is the case since 2020, reseeding teams does not occur at any point before the semifinals."

        "text": "Charles Delahaye, also known as \"Biboche,\" (born July 24, 1825 and died 1906) was a jeu de paume player in 19th-century France. \nBackground.\nHenri Delahaye, Biboche's father, kept a court in Amiens and previously had a court in Geneva. With his father's tuition, Biboche's game soon improved and by the age of 15 he was attached to the court in the Passage Sandrié. Here, he played with J. and the amateur, M. Mosneron, and soon came second in prowess only to Barre himself. His prime was in 1850-60. He was known as the best living teacher of the gamę, and as the able and courteous manager of the French courts. In 1848 he defeated Peter Tompkins at Hampton Court and in 1851 twice defeated his son, , at Oxford and James Street.\nBiboche eventually became maître paumier (palm master) of the \"Passage Sandrié, and on its demolition in 1861 took over the Tuileries Gardens court, retiring thirty-four years later in 1896.\" Similar to other great professionals, he was fond of bizarre handicaps and once played a \"match wearing the full dress uniform of the National Guard, wielding his racket in his right hand and a musket with fixed bayonet in his left.\"\nIn 1861, Napoleon III tasked Delahaye with overseeing the construction of the Jeu De Paume. Delahaye commissioned Melchior Viraut to design the building and it opened on January 15th, 1862. Fifteen years later, Delahaye had Viraut design a second court on the East side of the building. Unfortunately, Delahaye's court fell into disuse by the early twentieth century and became an exhibition space in 1909."

He has also coached at Graceland University, Western New Mexico University, Clarion University, and Angelo State University.\nCoaching career.\nGraceland.\nThomas served as a graduate assistant defensive backs coach for the 2009 season, following his playing career.\nWestern New Mexico.\nThe following year, Thomas began coaching the wide receivers coach for the Western New Mexico Mustangs as a graduate assistant. After two seasons, he moved back to the defensive side of the ball, coaching the defensive backs, while also adding special teams coordinator duties. Prior to the 2014 season, Thomas was again promoted. He served as the defensive coordinator for the 2014 and 2015 seasons. He was the youngest defensive coordinator in college football, at the age of 27 in 2014. During his time with the Mustangs, Thomas coached at least seven all-conference performers.\nClarion.\nFor the 2016 season, Thomas joined the staff at Clarion as the defensive coordinator. He took over a young defense, starting four different freshmen for at least five games each. The following season, the youth movement paid off as the Golden Eagle defense ranked second in the PSAC West in total defense and third in passing defense. Three of Clarion's four all-conference selections were from the defensive side. The next year, led by Preseason All-American selections, Brandon Vocco and Alec Heldreth, the Golden Eagles were top 16 in the nation in interceptions, takeaways, red zone defense, and opponent fourth down conversions. They finished the year with 4 more all conference players.\nAngelo State.\nThomas spent the 2019 and 2020 seasons at Angelo State as the co-defensive coordinator, special teams coordinator, and defensive backs coach. With his help, the Rams defensive units third nationally in scoring defense, fifth in defensive pass efficiency, and tenth in interceptions.\nMaryland.\nThomas joined the Maryland staff as a special teams quality control coach for the 2021 season. The following season, he briefly joined the staff at Florida before rejoining the Terrapin staff as the special teams coordinator and outside linebackers coach.\nPlaying career.\nThomas was a stellar athlete during his time at Graceland. In football, he started at cornerback for the Yellowjackets all four seasons. Additionally, Thomas earned all-conference honors his final three seasons. In the football offseason, he starred for the Yellowjacket Track and Field team, becoming an indoor track All-American in the 60-meter dash and breaking the school record in the 100-meter dash with a blazing time of 10.52 seconds.\nPersonal life.\nOriginally from an area of poverty in Orlando, Florida Thomas attended Graceland, in part, as an avenue to break out of the cycle. The relationships built while at the Lamoni, Iowa school continue to influence his life. He met his wife, Razanna, while at Graceland, as well as getting his start in coaching from one of his former Yellowjacket coaches, Adam Clark, whom he worked for both at Western New Mexico and Angelo State.\nThomas earned dual degrees in physical education and health from Graceland in 2009, and a master's degree in educational leadership from Western New Mexico in 2014. He and his wife have three children."

This remains the last title game appearance for California.\n1960 marked a high point for Ohio State in basketball, as while the team would make the Final Four and the championship in the years since, they would fail to win another title. The Buckeyes would return to the national championship game the next year and in 1962 as the number-one ranked team in the nation both times, but they would be upended by in-state foe Cincinnati in both games. The Buckeyes also returned to the national championship in 2007, also as the number-one ranked team in the nation, but they would lose to Florida, bringing their record in the championship game to 1–4."

        "text": "The Caribbean Professional Baseball Confederation (), or CPBC, is the body responsible for organizing the Caribbean Series, an annual club baseball tournament contested by the winter league baseball champions of the Caribbean and Latin American region. Four professional winter leagues are full members of the CPBC, and various others have been invited to participate in the tournament. It also administers the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame.\nThe CPBC is an independent organization, not affiliated with the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), which is otherwise recognized as the authority for international baseball tournaments.\nHistory.\nCBPC was formed in Havana on April 12, 1948 by representatives from the winter leagues of Cuba, Panama, and Puerto Rico. This group would be joined shortly thereafter by Venezuela. At the time, the group considered expanding its membership to Nicaragua, Honduras, and Colombia, though this did not occur before the first Caribbean Series was hosted in 1949. Its creation was sponsored by National Association president George Trautman, who ensured that the various winter leagues were affiliated with MLB-affiliated Organized Baseball.\nAfter the Cuban League was dissolved in the wake of the Cuban Revolution, the Caribbean Series was suspended, and the confederation went dormant. However, it was reorganized for the 1970 Caribbean Series with three teams, the Dominican Republic replacing Cuba and Panama (whose professional league had also ceased operations).\nMembership.\nThe original Cuban League and the Panamanian Professional Baseball League were both founding members of the federation in 1948, but their membership lapsed when the Caribbean Series was suspended after 1960.\nControversies.\nThe confederation has drawn controversy over the participation of non-CPBC members in the Caribbean Series. After Colombia was not invited to the 2024 Caribbean Series in Miami, the Colombian Baseball Federation (FCB) claimed that the CPBC had requested a fee of $200,000 to enter the series, after Colombia had already paid a $100,000 fee with the expectation of joining the CPBC as a full member. FCB president Pedro Salzedo Salom accused the CPBC of selling invitations to the highest bidder. Salzedo also alleged that the regime of Daniel Ortega offered $1 million to secure the participation of a Nicaraguan team in the 2024 tournament.\nReportedly, CPBC organizers were unhappy with Cuba and Colombia's participation in the 2023 Baseball Champions League Americas, a WBSC-sponsored club tournament.\nCommenting on the exclusion of Cuba from the 2024 tournament, CPBC President Juan Francisco Puello Herrera acknowledged that commercial factors were taken into account, but denied that they were the main reasons. \"Economic factors are essential, as is the sporting aspect, since good baseball will make this stadium fill up again like it did during the World Baseball Classic.\""

        "text": "The Queen's Gaels men's ice hockey team is an ice hockey team representing the Queen's Gaels athletics program of Queen's University at Kingston. The team is a member of the Ontario University Athletics conference and compete in U Sports. The Gaels play their home games at the Memorial Centre Arena in Kingston, Ontario.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nThe earliest recorded game for Queen's came in 1884 but its unclear if the match was officially sanctioned by the University or not. In 1886, a group of students from Queen's arranged a match against fellow undergraduates from the Royal Military College. The game took place on Kingston harbor and is typically regarded as the first game between two teams from Ontario. The two schools have been rivals ever since, the oldest such rivalry in the sport. The young program played when it was able to find the time and opposition but as stabilized when it became a founding member of the Ontario Hockey Association. Playing senior hockey at the time, Queen's won a league championship in 1895 and challenged the Montreal Hockey Club for the Stanley Cup. They were reportedly outmatched in the game and lost 1–5. Four years later the team had its second opportunity for the cup when they faced the Montreal Shamrocks in 1899. This match went about as well as the last with Queen's losing 2–6.\nAllan Cup.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Queen's joined with McGill and Toronto to form the first college conference in Canada. Queen's won two league championships in the first four years of play and leveraged their second intercollegiate title into a third challenge for the Stanley Cup. The Ottawa Hockey Club (later known as the 'Senators') easily dismissed the school boys with a pair of victories totaling 14–28. By 1909, the sport had become such a sensation in Canada that he various teams were separated into professional and amateur ranks. The Allan Cup was created as the amateur's version of the Stanley Cup and was initially awarded to the Ottawa Cliffsides. Queen's, by winning the intercollegiate title that season, earned the first challenge for the cup and defeated Ottawa 5–4, becoming the national amateur champions in the process. Queen's retained possession of the cup for a year and, after repeating as intercollegiate champs, they received their first challenge from the Cliffsides. Queen's cemented their place as the better of the two with a second win but were then beset by St. Michael's College and fell 4–5. Queen's returned to intercollegiate play afterwards and, though they were champions again in 1914, they did not challenge for the Allan Cup.\nInterwar years.\nIn 1915 the college schedule was cancelled due to World War I and Queen's rejoined the OHA for the duration. After the war, the Tricolour, as they were then known, returned to the intercollegiate conference but found they had been outpaced by Toronto. Over an 8-year span, Queen's would not post a winning record and eventually they withdrew from the league altogether. Queen's returned to the OHA in 1929, playing two seasons before suspending play due to financial constraints. Queen's was able to restart its program in the mid 30's and joined a new international intercollegiate league. Queen's played well in the four seasons of league play but the arrangement ended with the outbreak of World War II.\nTransition period.\nQueen's returned to play after the war but had fallen even further behind their contemporaries. The newly christened 'Golden Gaels' posted dismal records for five years, routinely finishing last in the conference, and withdrew in 1950. After one season in the OHA, which was no better, the program was suspended for the remainder of the decade. The Gaels returned to play in 1960 and joined the Quebec-Ontario Athletic Association. They were a middle of the pack team for most of the next two decades and remained with the Ontario side when the conference was realigned in 1971. 1981 saw Queen's win its first conference championship in over 65 years and the Gaels made their first appearance in the national tournament.\nLong recovery.\nAfter the title, Queen's had a few good years in the early 80s but slipped into the bottom half of the conference by the middle of the decade. After 1984, Queen's did not post a winning record for over 20 years and didn't fully regain their previous form until 2014. The Gaels finally returned to the national tournament in 2017 and won their second league championship two years later.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSenior and collegiate play.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\"\n&lt;br&gt;\nCollegiate only.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\"\nSee also.\nQueen's Gaels women's ice hockey"

The cup feature the 27 departmental teams across the country vying for the title, which will be defended by 2020 champions WAPDA. \nInitially scheduled to be held throughout 2023, the second phase will be held in May 2024 after almost 15 months of inactivity. \nBackground.\nThe tournament took place after a gap of nearly three-and-a-half years because of the Pakistan Football Federation's suspension by FIFA due to a power struggle within the Pakistan Football Federation. FIFA lifted the ban imposed on PFF after the legitimate Normalization Committee body was restored.\nThe tournament was announced briefly after departmental sports in Pakistan were restored in August 2022 by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Many of the departmental clubs were disbanded following the shutdown of departmental sports in Pakistan in September 2021. Departmental teams were then restricted to the PFF National Challenge Cup, following their controversial participation in the Pakistani domestic league setup in the previous years. A PFF official stated that from now on, there will be separate competitions for departments and clubs. When a domestic league is held, it will be solely for clubs.\nThe PFF Constitution stated that all departmental players need to be “affiliated with a club”, with some teams taking advantage of it such as POPO FC, which had their team playing the Challenge Cup under the department with the name of Mamsons Builders. Lyallpur FC competed under the name of Otto Cranes.\nFormat.\nIn the first phase, teams, bracketed in seven groups, will compete on home and away basis. The leading two teams from each group and the two best third-placed sides will progress to the round of 16. The first phase was held at Karachi, Lahore, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad, Peshawar, Quetta, Chaman, Rawalpindi and Islamabad simultaneously. \nThe second phase was set to be conducted from May 1 to 12 in 2023 at a centre yet to be decided. It was postponed to kick off on the 21st of October until 6 November 2023. After an uncertain inactivity almost 15 months after it began, the National Challenge Cup knockout stage was finally announced to reach its end in Lahore from May 1 to 12 in 2024. The venue was ultimately shifted to Islamabad.\nTeams.\nThe 27 teams participating in the tournament are as below: \nFirst phase.\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGwadar Port Authority withdrew due to their internal issues.\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup G.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "title": "Skeleton panda sea squirt",
        "text": "Clavelina ossipandae, the skeleton panda sea squirt or skeleton panda ascidian (), is a species of colonial ascidian (sea squirt), a group of sessile, marine filter-feeding invertebrates. Originally discovered near Kume Island in Japan by local divers, pictures of the animal attracted attention in the media for its appearance prior to its formal taxonomic description in 2024.\n\"C. ossipandae\" lives at around of depth, anchored to the surface of coral reefs with strong currents. It lives in colonies of one to four transparent individuals or zooids measuring up to each. Individuals in a colony are linked through connections called stolons, and originate from a single organism reproducing asexually, although they are also capable of sexual reproduction.\nAmong sea squirts, \"C. ossipandae\" is most recognizable for its white horizontal blood vessels, giving it a skeleton-like appearance, and black frontal dots of unknown function, that have been compared to a panda's eyes and nose. After it was featured on television programs and social media, a crowdfunded expedition sampled specimens of the animal in 2021. The researchers formally described it three years later.\nHistory.\nAlthough the skeleton panda sea squirt was not formally described at the time, pictures of it were shared by local divers from Kume Island in Japan's Ryukyu Archipelago around 2017, notably Shunji Terai, whose diving shop drew in tourists interested in seeing the creatures. Popular on social media such as Twitter, the animal was also featured in television programs, by NHK as well as commercial broadcasters.\nThe images attracted the attention of Hokkaido University tunicate expert Naohiro Hasegawa, who encountered them on Twitter in 2018 and recognized the animal as distinct from other ascidian species. Supported through crowdfunding, a team of Japanese researchers led by Hasegawa sampled it in 2021 from the rocky outcrop of Tonbara, off Kume Island, which is only accessible in winter because of tidal currents and wind. In a 2024 paper announcing the discovery, the team formally described it as the new species \"Clavelina ossipandae\". Four specimens, colonies of one to four individuals each, were collected. They were later deposited in the Invertebrate Collection of the Hokkaido University Museum in Sapporo.\nEtymology.\nThe generic name \"Clavelina\", Latin for \"little bottle\", refers to the shape of zooids (individual members of the colony) in the genus. The specific epithet \"ossipandae\" is derived from Latin (bone) and \"panda\". Like the common name, it refers to the white rib-like markings on the sides of the zooid, as well as to the black and white patterns on its front part, resembling the face of the giant panda.\nDescription.\n\"Clavelina ossipandae\" is a small colonial tunicate, found in colonies of one to four zooids. Unlike in the related genera \"Euclavella\" and \"Nephtheis\", zooids are free, although they extend from a basal mass and are connected to each other through vascular stolons. Individual zooids have been reported to be up to long, with sampled specimens ranging from long.\nAnatomy.\nEach zooid is covered in its own transparent tunic, which like in most sea squirts possesses two visible openings, the oral and atrial siphons. The oral siphon, through which food particles are drawn into the pharynx, is surrounded by 10 oral tentacles. The pharynx is the main cavity in which food is filtered, funneled through a dorsal tubercle with a ciliated slit-like opening. The back side of the pharynx is lined with a series of tongue-shaped dorsal languets that help transport food, while an endostyle, another organ assisting in filter-feeding, is present on the front side below the oral siphon. The esophagus connects the pharynx to the stomach in the middle of the abdomen, followed by a tube-like intestinal loop. The latter leads to the anus, where waste is expelled through the atrial siphon.\nThe tunic is divided into thoracic and abdominal segments, almost equal in length, although the thoracic tunic is thinner and softer than its abdominal counterpart. The thorax bears 10–11 pairs of longitudinal muscle bands, with 2 running from the abdomen to the endostyle, 5–6 to the oral siphon and 2–4 to the dorsal side.\nPatterns.\nSpecimens bear several white transverse blood vessels along their length, running through their gills, giving the appearance of a series of ribs. The black endostyle is visible below the oral siphon, as well as a mid-dorsal black line below the atrial siphon.\n\"C. ossipandae\" is also recognizable by the black markings on its white anterior portion (a central dot between the oral and atrial siphons, surrounded by two lateral bands), uniquely distinctive in the genus \"Clavelina\". Two other species in the genus are known to bear similar patterns, although they differ in color, being dark blue on light blue in \"C. moluccensis\" and blue on yellow in \"C. viola\". The role of these markings remains unknown.\nLife cycle.\n\"C. ossipandae\" specimens are hermaphroditic: they possess both ovaries and testicular follicles, attached to the left side of the intestine beyond the stomach. A brood pouch is present on the back of the thorax, where eggs and larvae develop. Like in all tunicates, larvae are motile and tadpole-shaped. They measure around in length, of which the tail comprises . The larval body is divided into a frontal plate, with three adhesive papillae, and a trunk bearing an ocellus and an otolith. The adhesive papillae help the larva anchor on a solid substrate, metamorphosing into a sessile adult. Like other colonial sea squirts, \"C. ossipandae\" can also reproduce asexually through budding, forming colonies of genetically identical, connected zooids.\nTaxonomy.\nSeveral morphological traits were used to identify the skeleton panda sea squirt as a member of genus \"Clavelina\". Namely, the zooids are free rather than fully embedded, the larvae lack the tubular structures in their adhesive organs characteristic of the related genus \"Pycnoclavella\", and the number of spiracles (10–14) is consistent with the range seen in \"Clavelina\" species (8–20).\nThrough sequencing of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from the holotype and a paratype, \"Clavelina ossipandae\" was identified as the sister species of \"C. australis\" inside the genus \"Clavelina\".\nDistribution and ecology.\nThe species is known to live in waters off the coast of Kume Island, Japan, where both the original reports and the later samples were obtained. Colonies were observed at depths of , anchored to coral reefs, and are believed to live specifically in areas with fast currents. It is the first species of ascidian known from Kume Island, although other specimens have been collected from the locality and are awaiting description as of 2024.\nWhile its feeding habits are not known with certainty, \"C. ossipandae\" has been assumed to consume phytoplankton like related filter-feeding ascidians."

The initial product was the Senior Intercollegiate League, however, that conference lasted for only one season. Eventually, several schools in Ontario and Quebec banded together to form the Ottawa–St. Lawerence Conference. Initially, the league was considered an intermediate conference (roughly equivalent to Division II in the U.S.) and included the second team from McGill. By the early 1960s, however, the conference had grown in strength and prestige and was included in the inaugural CIAU national tournament. In 1971, the three conferences in Ontario and Quebec were realigned according to provincial lines and the OSLC ceased to exist.\nInitially, the conference did not have a formal playoff structure to determine the league champion. The OSLC would only hold a playoff if there was a tie for the league champions at the end of the regular season. No playoffs were held in the first 12 years of conference play as no tie ever occurred. In 1962, the conference formalized a postseason for the first time, pitting the top two teams in a single-elimination game for the championship. The tournament was expanded to four teams the following season and remained in place for the duration of the conference.\nTournaments.\n1950.\n\"no playoffs\"&lt;br&gt;\n1951.\n\"no playoffs\"\n1952.\n\"no playoffs\"\n1953.\n\"no playoffs\"\n1954.\n\"no playoffs\"\n1955.\n\"no playoffs\"\n1956.\n\"no playoffs\"&lt;br&gt;\n1957.\n\"no playoffs\"&lt;br&gt;\n1958.\n\"no playoffs\"&lt;br&gt;\n1959.\n\"no playoffs\"&lt;br&gt;\n1960.\n\"no playoffs\"\n1961.\n\"no playoffs\"&lt;br&gt;\nExternal links.\nConcordia Stingers Championships"

The team was made up mostly of sophomores and was the last squad selected to play in Madison Square Garden's famed NIT, which had a 12-team field and at that time, was more prestigious than the NCAA tournament. Early on in the NCAA Tournament's days, which began in 1939, teams were allowed to participate in both it and the NIT. The NCAA later ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, to avoid having another double champion.\nPeople took notice when the Beavers thrashed defending champion San Francisco 65–46 in the opening round. CCNY then faced 3rd-ranked and two-time defending national champion Kentucky and their 7-foot center, Bill Spivey, in the second round. Kentucky was a racially segregated school from the Southeastern Conference, and several Kentucky players refused to shake hands with the black and Jewish CCNY players before the game. This incensed the CCNY players, who then proceeded to embarrass the Wildcats by an 89–50 score, handing Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp his worst loss ever. The blowout win over Kentucky was even more impressive due to the fact that Kentucky had won the national championship in 1948, 1949, and would do so again in 1951. A Cinderella Team had now emerged in the tournament. CCNY then defeated Duquesne 62–52 in the semi-final round. In the NIT title game, the Beavers squared off against top-ranked Bradley, who had All-American Paul Unruh and the 5'8\" speedster, Gene \"Squeaky\" Melchiorre. CCNY came out on top 69–61 to win the NIT title. Ed Warner of CCNY was awarded Most Valuable Player honors.\nAfter winning the NIT title, the Beavers were immediately selected to participate in the NCAA tournament. In the opening round, the Beavers upset second-ranked Ohio State, 56–55. The Beavers then defeated fifth-ranked North Carolina State 78–73 in the Final Four to reach the national championship game.\nBradley Braves.\nThe Braves were the top-ranked team in the nation going into both the NIT and NCAA tournaments. They were led by All-American Paul Unruh and the 5'8\" speedster, Gene \"Squeaky\" Melchiorre. They made it all the way to the NIT tournament final where they would face unranked CCNY, and were surprisingly upset by a 69–61 score. In the NCAA tournament, the Braves defeated UCLA in the opening round, and then defeated Baylor in the Final Four to reach the national championship game, where they would again be pitted against CCNY.\nGame summary.\nSource:\nAftermath.\nAfter winning the national title, CCNY was implicated in a point-shaving scandal. Players had taken money from gamblers in the point-shaving scandals during the 1948–1949 season and also during some regular-season games in the 1949–1950 season. No games were fixed during the post-season tournaments.\nThe scandal involved CCNY and six other schools, including three others in the New York Metropolitan Area: New York University, Long Island University (LIU) and Manhattan College, spreading to Bradley University, the University of Kentucky and the University of Toledo, involving 33 players in all, as well as organized crime. Head coach Nat Holman was cleared of any wrongdoing. Among the CCNY players taken into custody were All-America forward Ed Warner, center Ed Roman, and guard Al Roth, the three stars of CCNY's starting five that won both the NIT and national championships. The police had set up an undercover operation. The arrests were made in Penn Station when the players returned from Philadelphia, after CCNY had defeated Temple University, 95–71.\nThe scandal prompted the suspension of the basketball program. The school was moved from Division I to Division III and was banned from playing at Madison Square Garden. As a result of these sanctions, the CCNY basketball program was de–emphasized, and the school has never again appeared in either the NCAA or NIT tournaments. CCNY is the only NCAA Basketball Championship team that is no longer a member of Division I."

The team did well in its inaugural season, finishing 10 games above .500 while reaching the league finals. For the second season, the team was renamed 'Nutmegs' after Connecticut, the nutmeg state. The rebranding didn't help their attendance figures but, more likely, the main culprit was their fall in the standings.

        "text": "The 1924–25 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 8th season of play for the program. The Eagles were coached by Charles Foote in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nBefore the start of the season, Charles Foote delayed signing on for a second season with the Eagles, however, he was unable to keep himself away. Francis J. \"Jack\" Culhane was elected captain at the end of the previous year and led a squad that was largely unchanged from the previous season. BC's chief complaint from '24, a lack of reserves, was addressed by the addition of several new players as well as the return of Rocky Curry from appendicitis. While Boston College was still forced to schedule most of its games with amateur clubs and Canadian colleges, as the preeminent US schools still refused to meet the Eagles, the team rekindled its budding rivalry with Boston University with a pair of games.\nBC kicked off the season just before Christmas against BU but found themselves on the wrong end of an 0–1 score. BC then played four games against visiting Canadian colleges and, though they kept the score close, lost three consecutive matches. BC finally ended their downwards spiral with a resounding victory over Queen's. While the offense finding its game was largely responsible for the victory, local lore attributed the change to Jack Fitzgerald's new haircut. During the 4-game losing streak, Fitzgerald had sported a von Hindenburg haircut and, convinced by $15 bet from his teammates, Fitzgerald agreed to shave his head completely before the match. The victory was the turning point of the season for the Eagles.\nAfter an exhibition match with a collection of local college All-stars, BC went dormant for the exam break and gave time enough for Eddie Spang to arrange a trip north. Beginning in late January, the Eagles travelled to Canada, finally accepting the invitation from the northern colleges. Unfortunately, the trip ended up being cancelled and the Canadians were once more forced to travel to Boston. Instead, two amateur teams were swiftly scheduled but the Eagles rolled over their opponents regardless. Fitzgerald was nigh unbeatable over a 4-game stretch that saw him surrender just a single goal. The new-look Eagles were then tested when McGill arrived in mid-February. The results mirrored the earlier meeting between the two but BC was still unable to defeat the Redmen. The Eagles responded well the following week, downing Montreal in a pair of games to end the month with a winning record.\nThe team ended the year with three games against amateur teams in March. First was a rematch with the Boston Athletic Association that saw a tightly contested match head into overtime. The B.A.A. scored a quick goal and forced the Eagles to play the remainder of the session with six attackers but all was for naught and the Eagles were defeated. A few days later, the Montreal AAA arrived in town and BC put a much sturdier defensive effort. The 3–1 victory ensured the team of a winning record on the season. The final game was the rubber match with B.A.A. and gave the rabid crowd a show. The teams exchanged goals at the start of the match but the amateurs pulled ahead just before the end of the period. The Eagles had to weather a barrage of shots in the middle frame and managed to keep the score at 1–2. It was much the same in the third, with Fitzgerald turning aside everything that was sent in his direction, but the Eagles still needed a goal to tie. With just 3 minutes to play, Eddie Mullowney raced down the ice and fired a hard shot wide. The puck rebounded off of the back wall and settled off to the side of the cage. Mullowney was the first to reach the puck and fired it from a difficult angle into the net for the tying goal. Three 10-minute overtime sessions were play but no further scoring occurred. After 75 minutes of hard, fast play, the game was called, leaving the better of the two squads undecided.\nEdmund Spang served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Only the players listed in these squads below were eligible to take part in the tournament, which were revealed in full on 7 February 2024.\nThe age listed for each player is as on 15 February 2024, the first day of the tournament and the names of the players shown are, in most circumstances, that of the \"FIFA Display Names\" listed on the official squad document issued by FIFA.\nGroup A.\nUnited Arab Emirates.\nCoach: Victor Vasques\nEgypt.\nCoach: Moustafa Ziedan\nAbdoo Elshafei was withdrawn from the squad with injury on 14 February and replaced by Hossam Salama.\nUnited States.\nCoach: Francis Farberoff\nNick Perera (caps 94; goals 114) was withdrawn from the squad with a left knee injury on 12 February and replaced by Andres Navas.\nItaly.\nCoach: Emiliano Del Duca\nGroup B.\nSpain.\nCoach: Cristian Mendez\nIran.\nCoach: Ali Naderi\nTahiti.\nCoach: Teva Zaveroni\nArgentina.\nCoach: Herman Magrini\nGroup C.\nSenegal.\nCoach: Mamadou Diallo\nBelarus.\nCoach: Nico Alvarado\nColombia.\nCoach: Santiago Alzate\nJapan.\nCoach: Teruki Tabata\n\"Note: Teruki Tabata is coach per FIFA; Ozu Moreira is player-coach per the Japan Football Association, whilst Tabata is listed as assistant coach.\"\nGroup D.\nBrazil.\nCoach: Marco Octávio\nOman.\nCoach: Talib Al Thanawi\nPortugal.\nCoach: Mário Narciso\nRui Coimbra was unavailable for selection for a second consecutive World Cup, this time due to recovery from a detached retina.\nThe squad did not contain at least one of the legendary trio of Alan, Madjer or Belchior for the first time since the 1997 World Championships, making this just the second of the 19 times Portugal have appeared at a world cup of beach soccer that this is the case.\nMexico.\nCoach: Francisco Cati\nStatistics.\nOverall, 192 players have travelled to the United Arab Emirates to compete in the tournament.

        "text": "The Quebec Universities Athletic Association ice hockey tournament was an annual conference championship held between member teams.\nHistory.\nAfter the realignment of the Quebec–Ontario Athletic Association, Ontario Intercollegiate Athletic Association and Ottawa-St. Lawrence Conference in 1971, the Quebec Universities Athletic Association was born. The league began with 8 teams and, despite the name, one was located in Ontario (Royal Military College). The inaugural postseason tournament included four teams with all games being single-elimination. The league began to contract almost immediately when Montreal suspended play after just one season. RMC left after the second year and, although they were replace by Macdonald, that reprieve lasted for just one year. The conference briefly included a quarterfinal round but, with both Macdonald and Sherbrooke leaving after 1974, the conference abandoned that format. One year later, Loyola and Sir George Williams merged, leaving the QUAA with four members schools.\nBefore the start of the 1975–76 season, Laval restarted its program, bringing the league back up to five teams. At this point, the league shifted their postseason format so that all rounds were best-of-three. One year later, the conference appeared to have stabilized when they added Quebec–Chicoutimi. After being penalized for using an ineligible player in 1977, Laval suspended play for a full year before returning. In their absence, the conference expanded the final series into a best-of-five format. The addition of Ottawa in 1979 brought the conference nearly back to what they had at the start but the gains were short-lived.\nIn 1982, Bishop's suspended its program and Laval followed suit a year later. While the conference was barely holding together at this point, the playoffs were still expanded to be best-of-five for all series, though that format lasted for one tournament. After Quebec–Chicoutimi suspended its program in 1986, the conference lasted just one more year before all existing members were absorbed into the Ontario University Athletic Association. The final championship for the conference was a best-of-seven series.\nReferences.\nMen's Hockey Champions"

Each match is scheduled for up to two days. The first edition of the competition was held in 2022–23. The tournament sees three teams competing, each representing one of the three major rivers of Bangladesh. \nHistory.\nFollowing the success of Bangladesh in 2018 Women's Twenty20 Asia Cup, plans were going on to establish a two-day red-ball match for women since August 2018. In April 2021, the International Cricket Council awarded permanent women's Test status to Bangladesh women's national cricket team. The lack of a domestic first-class cricket competition for women prevented Bangladesh to start playing Test matches. The 2022–23 edition is the first-ever women's multi-day competition in Bangladesh, launched by the Bangladesh Cricket Board in March 2023. In March 2023, the tournament was inaugurated by the chairman of BCB women's wing Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, at Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna. The competition was introduced to prepare women cricketers for Test cricket and adapt themselves with the longer version.\nThe first edition of the tournament took place from 30 March to 8 April 2023 in a round-robin format. All the matches ended in a draw and thus the championship was clinched by Team Meghna in terms of quotient."

        "text": "The 2024 Major League Cricket players' draft was held on March 21, 2024, ahead of the 2024 Major League Cricket season. The draft was held virtually. An additional draft is scheduled to be held on June 16, 2024 to complete the squads.\nHowever, the draft was not broadcast and a recap of the event was released by the Major League Cricket through their social media platforms.\nThe draft was conducted over 10 rounds divided on the basis of salary cap, using the \"snake\" format. Out of the 125 players in the draft list, 20 players were drafted.\nRules.\nThe draft is exclusive to domestic players, like the previous season, however teams are able to announce newly signed players during the draft.\nEach team were allowed to have a minimum of nine domestic players and maximum of ten, with a mandatory U23 player in their squads. Until all the teams had passed, the draft round continued in the snake format. Each team could draft two players in each level, if they had enough purse available.\nSalary cap.\nThe draft had fixed salary caps for each round, with the highest being $75,000 in the first round and the lowest being $5,000 in the Rookie (U23) round.\nDraft order.\nThe draft pick order was based on the reverse order of the teams' finishing positions in the 2023 season standings. Los Angeles Knight Riders had the first pick, if the team did not have enough purse to draft a player, they were automatically passed to the next team.\nRetained players.\nTeams were set a deadline for the end of February 2024 to announce overseas and domestic player retentions for the season, with a maximum of nine overseas slots allowed in each team. Any remaining domestic players would be available to be picked by teams during the main draft.\nOn February 15, 2024, the retained overseas players' lists were announced. On March 1, 2024, the domestic player retention list was announced.\nDraft selections.\nNo players were drafted by the teams in the third, fourth and fifth rounds. So, the 6th pick of the draft was directly made in the sixth round.\nOverseas signings.\nThe following players were directly signed by teams ahead of the 2024 season."

        "title": "Ottawa Gee-Gees men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Ottawa Gee-Gees men's ice hockey team is an ice hockey team representing the Ottawa Gee-Gees athletics program of the University of Ottawa. The team is a member of the Ontario University Athletics conference and compete in U Sports. The Gee-Gees play their home games at the Minto Sports Complex in Ottawa, Ontario.\nHistory.\nExactly when the school first supported an ice hockey team is unclear. Students from Ottawa had been organizing teams since the beginning of the 20th century, however, it's not until 1910 that records indicate a varsity team. Even then, records are spotty, with Ottawa fading in and out of the historical record prior to World War I. What is known is that Ottawa was ranked as the top Canadian college team in 1914 and met Hobey Baker-led Princeton for the first international intercollegiate championship. Ottawa captured the title in overtime 3–2.\nReferences to Ottawa's hockey team don't reappear until the late 20s when they joined the local city junior league. The Gee-Gees remained members of that organization until the mid-50s. During that stretch, Ottawa also played in the city's senor league for about a decade, but its unclear if they did so with the same team or a separate squad.\nOttawa didn't officially return to varsity collegiate play until 1961 when they joined the Ottawa-St. Lawrence Conference (sometimes called Ottawa-St. Lawrence Athletic Association). After seven years in the league, Ottawa joined the Quebec-Ontario Athletic Association and then remained with the Ontario contingent when the three regional conferences were rearranged along provincial lines. In 1979, Ottawa moved to the Quebec Universities Athletic Association, as they were closer geographically to the Quebec colleges than they were several of the Ontario schools. While the change provided Ottawa with the opportunity tot win their first championship in 1985 as well as their first appearance in the national tournament, the league collapsed in 1987 after several schools suspended operation. The remainder of the league was absorbed by the Ontario University Athletic Association, where Ottawa has remained since.\nScandal.\nIn February 2014, the Gee-Gees were in Thunder Bay to take on Lakehead. A woman (referred to as M. S.) met Taylor Collins, one of the Ottawa players, at a bar for a romantic encounter. According to her subsequent statement to the police, after the two met at a bar, Taylor disappeared and she was accosted by two of his teammates, David Foucher and Guillaume Donovan. M. S. alleged that she was sexually assaulted by the two players and the charge brought about a swift reaction. The University of Ottawa suspended its men's team in March and head coach Réal Paiement was fired. Foucher and Donovan were formally charged with sexual assault in August and the university twice extended the program's suspension, cancelling the next two seasons in their entirety.\nThe trial began more than four years after the reported incident and lasted for approximately two weeks. Justice Chantal M. Brochu heard testimony from seven people including the alleged victim, M. S., as well as Foucher, Donovan and Paiement. During the trial, M. S. was reported to have lied on the witness stand which contributed to Justice Brochu setting her testimony aside. Ultimately, Foucher and Donovan were acquitted of the charges on June 25 and the Crown decided not to appeal the decision.\nThe 22 players who were not charged with sexual assault filed a class-action lawsuit against both the university and its president, Allan Rock, for defamation in January 2015. The initial filling claimed that the plaintiffs were more concerned with the image and reputation of the university than the damage that would be caused by cancelling a season and alleging implicitly that the players who were not charged had been involved in criminal activity. While the initial demand was for $6 million, the two sides eventually settled for $350,000 in compensation.\nAftermath.\nThe school decided to restart the team in 2016 and hired Patrick Grandmaître to rebuild the program. Ottawa would remain dogged by the scandal for several years with opposing players and fans chanting slogans like \"No means no\" even when they weren't on the ice. The team was able to play through the difficult times and swiftly returned to prominence. Ottawa managed to earn an appearance in the 2020 national tournament for just the third time in program history, however, their first match was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSenior and collegiate play.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\"\nCollegiate only.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\"\nSee also.\nOttawa Gee-Gees women's ice hockey"

The tournament will be held March 5–13, 2024 at campus sites of the higher seeds. The winner will receive the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.\nSeeds.\nAll ten teams in the conference qualified for the tournament. The teams were seeded by record in conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records.\nThe first tiebreaker is the head-to-head records of the tied teams. If teams remain tied, the tied teams' records against the highest seeded Patriot League team not involved in the tie are compared, provided each of the tied teams played that team at least once. If the tied teams have identical winning percentages against the highest seeded team, the process works its way down the standings. If the teams remain tied, the NCAA NET rankings available on day following the conclusion of Patriot League regular-season play are used. In the event tied teams have identical NET rankings, the tied teams' winning percentages against non-Patriot League common opponents are compared. If the tie involves three or more teams, and one or more teams are superior or inferior to the others after any step, but two or more teams remain tied, the multiple-team tiebreaker process continues and does not revert to a new two-team or multiple-team tiebreaker.\nOnce a team is eliminated from a multiple-team tiebreaker, either by demonstrating superiority or inferiority to the remaining tied teams, it is treated as if it had not been involved in the initial tie for the purposes of applying the remaining steps in continuing the tiebreaker procedure, and such team is seeded according to the tiebreaker result. This point was relevant in applying the tiebreaker procedure to break the four-way tie for second place in 2024. Boston University had a 4–2 record in head-to-head games against American, Bucknell and Lafayette, earning the no. 2 seed. Bucknell had a 2–4 head-to-head record, causing them to be seeded no. 5. American and Lafayette each had 3–3 head-to-head records, leaving them in a tie for the no. 3 seed. American and Lafayette each split their season series with no. 1 seed Colgate. Lafayette earned the no. 3 seed by virtue of their 1–1 record versus no. 2 seed Boston University, while American was 0–2 against the Terriers.\nIf teams involved in the initial tie were ignored in applying subsequent tiebreaker steps, American would have been the no. 3 seed, based on their 1–1 record against Lehigh, superior to Lafayette, who were 0–2 versus the Mountain Hawks. \nIf Boston University and Bucknell were treated as a group of tied teams, since they both finished 10–8 and tied for second place, in applying subsequent steps of the tiebreaker, the tie would not have been resolved at this step, since American and Lafayette each had 2–2 records versus Boston University and Bucknell. The procedure would have continued to the next step, the teams' records against no. 6 seed Lehigh, which American would have won. "

The ruling vacated six of Colorado's conference wins, revising the Buffaloes' conference record from 7–7 to 1–13. This caused Colorado to drop from a fifth-place conference standing to last.\n Joe Harrington coached the first 14 games of the season, going 5–9 and 0–3 in conference play before resigning. Ricardo Patton was named interim coach and went 7–20 and 3–13 in conference for the remainder of the season."

It will be held in August–September 2025 in a host nation to be determined.\nStarting with this edition, the tournament will be expanded to include 24 teams instead of the 16 teams of previous editions, following the decision adopted by FIVB in June 2023.\nIran are the defending champions.\nCompetition formula changes.\nIn June 2023 during a three-day meeting in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, the FIVB Board of Administration approved the proposal made by its Volleyball Council to increase the number of participating teams to 24 in its Age Group World Championships (U19 and U21 in both genders). Consequently, the distribution of quotas by confederation for the Women's U21 World Championship was modified regarding previous editions, ensuring one automatic quota for the defending champion and assigning two quotas based on the corresponding FIVB Age Group World Ranking.\nThe new competition formula was in line with the one adopted for the 2023 FIVB Volleyball Boys' U19 World Championship, which was also contested by 24 teams.\nHost selection.\nOn 28 March 2024, FIVB opened the bidding process for member associations whose countries were interested in hosting one of the four Age Group World Championships in 2025 (i.e., U19 Boys' and Girls' World Championships and U21 Men's and Women's World Championships). The expression of interest of the member associations had to be submitted to FIVB by 30 April 2024, 18:00 CEST ().\nQualification.\nA total of 24 national teams will qualify for the final tournament. In addition to the host team and the defending champions who qualified automatically, 20 other teams will qualify through five separate continental competitions which were required to be held no later than 31 December 2024. Two remaining teams will enter the tournament via the Men's U21 FIVB World Ranking (as of 31 December 2024) among the teams not yet qualified.\nThe slot allocation per confederation was set as follows:"

Unlike the able-bodied events, a different system means no guaranteed places are created, but a swimmer wishing to be considered needs to meet a qualification time known as a 'nomination time', calculated on a points basis within their classification.\nThe following para-swimmers gained a nomination time in these events:"

All of the turbines are manufactured by General Electric. It uses an air-cooled condenser to reduce water draw. It is located on a 193-acre former industrial area, the former Mid-Hudson Recycling Center, which was destroyed in a massive 1996 fire. It is fueled by natural gas supplied from a trunk pipeline, one of many that are located along the east coast. Its power is sold into the electric wholesale market administered by the NYISO."

Organized baseball in Cuba originated with the Cuban League in 1878, which was dissolved during the Cuban Revolution and replaced by the Cuban National Series in 1961. Since 2022, the National Series has been supplanted as the island's top division by the Cuban Elite League.\nEarly organized Cuban baseball was dominated by teams from the Havana metropolitan area. The most successful teams were Club Habana (which won a record 30 championships, including the first tournament in 1879) and Almendares. In the modern-era of Cuban baseball, starting with the establishment of the National Series in 1961, teams from other parts of the country have enjoyed more success, although Industriales of Havana still hold the most titles (12).\nFor the entire history of the Cuban League and National Series up to 1985, the champion was determined by win-loss record. The 1985–86 season was the first to incorporate a postseason, in the form of a double round-robin system between four teams; this system has been maintained, with slight changes, up to the present day."

        "title": "Joe Gray (American football)",
        "text": "Joseph Arlo Gray (November 8, 1915 – May 11, 1999) was an American football back. Nicknamed the \"Gray Ghost\", he played college football for the Oregon State Beavers and was selected in the first round (10th overall) of the 1938 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, but never played professionally.\nEarly life.\nGray was born on November 8, 1915, in Aurora, Oregon, and later moved to Portland as a youth. He attended Roosevelt High School Portland and then enrolled at Oregon State College (now Oregon State University) in 1934. At Roosevelt, he won three varsity letters on the football team and two on the baseball team, being a two-time first-team All-Portland Interscholastic League (PIL) selection as a back.\nCollege career.\nGray played football and baseball at Oregon State. Up until his freshman year of college, his passing was reported to be poor, but \"[coach] Lon Stiner took him in hand, told him to hold his balance and keep on the ground when tossing and now [Gray] can pass anything from a milk bottle to a watermelon,\" one newspaper commented. By his sophomore year, Gray had developed into a \"sensational halfback\", being described as \"outstanding in every game\" while being noted as a triple-threat man who could pass, run and punt. He tied for the scoring lead in the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) and helped the Oregon State Beavers compile a record of 6–4–1. The United Press (UP) named Gray an honorable mention on their 1935 All-Coast football team.\nIn summing up Gray's sophomore season, the Associated Press (AP) reported that he was \"probably the most outstanding all-around sophomore halfback in the coast conference ... His passing arm was the magic wand of the Beaver's aerial circus, and he scintillated at ball carrying. Seldom did he fail to twist loose at least once a game for a kick return of 50 yards or more. His change of pace and ability to remain on his feet carried him farther than many speedier backs.\" That year, he received the nickname \"Gray Ghost\" from an announcer, which he afterwards was commonly known by. A reporter for the \"Corvallis Gazette-Times\" said it was \"Not a bad name, either, as many opposing tacklers are willing to bet that Joe is just an apparition who can't be brought down.\" He received his nickname because, as one said, \"He was an elusive runner, it was like he wasn't there anymore, like a ghost.\"\nGray remained one of the best players in the conference in 1937, being among their leading scorers again as the Beavers ultimately compiled a record of 4–6. United Press (UP) noted that he was \"the coast's best passer and ... a grand open-field runner.\" At the end of the season, Gray was named second-team All-Coast, despite having been injured for a portion of the year.\nGray continued to be a top player as a senior in 1937. He was considered one of the greatest backs produced in the Northwest in years and was praised as the best Oregon State runner and passer in history up to that point. \"The Oakland Post Enquirer\" stated that he \"personally acts as 75 percent of the Oregon State offense\" and called him as being \"in a class by himself\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" described him as having a \"heart of a true champion\" and praised him for having \"just about everything\", noting that \"He's a rugged, 60-minute player, kicks well, can run with the ball and plays a bang-up game on defense. But it is when he starts pitching the pigskin that Joe really comes into his own. For two years he's been baffling rival teams with his sharpshooting and it is a dull afternoon when Joe doesn't turn one or more throws into a touchdown.\" Although the Beavers only compiled a record of 3–3–3, Gray was named first-team All-Coast and was selected a second-team All-American. He played at the Chicago College All-Star Game and at the East–West Shrine Bowl.\nLater life and death.\nGray was selected in the first round of the 1938 NFL draft – 10th overall by the Chicago Bears – but declined their offer to work as an agriculture inspector, in part from a knee injury. He worked with the Oregon Department of Agriculture starting in 1938 and remained there until retiring in 1980, having risen to the post of administrator of the food and dairy division. He served in the United States Army and was awarded a Bronze Star Medal. Gray was a member of the Elks Lodge and the American and Western Food and Drug Officials Administration. He was married and had two children. Gray died on May 11, 1999, at the age of 83, in Marion, Oregon.\nGray was inducted into the Oregon State Athletic Hall of Fame in 1991 and into the Portland Interscholastic League Hall of Fame in 2020."

The winner receives an automatic bid to the U Sports men's ice hockey championship.\nHistory.\nFour division league.\nIn 1997, the OUAA changes its name to Ontario University Athletics (OUA). Coinciding with the rebranding was a change to the playoff format. The OUA used the same qualifications as the OUAA had; the four division winners received byes into the quarterfinal round while the second- and third-place teams met in the first round. The first round was changed to a two-game series where if the teams remained tied after the two matches than a 20-minute mini-game was used as a tiebreaker (mini-games are unofficial matches that are not counted for any statistical category). The Divisional Finals were also altered, becoming a best-of-five series. This format lasted for only one year and the following season the mini-game was replaced by a regular best-of-three series while the second round went from best-of-five to best-of-three.\nThe playoff format remained constant for several years but saw a small change in 2005. The OUA paired the eastern and western divisions for the postseason. The four division champions were still given byes into the second round, however, the remaining four teams for each bracket were selected based upon their regular season record and seeded accordingly. Additionally, the division final round was now also changed to a best-of-three series.\nTwo division league.\nIn the later half of the 00s, OUA added three more schools to the lineup. After the arrival of Nipissing, the league abandoned the cumbersome four division format and switched to eastern and western halves. Additionally, the tournament was expanded to 16 teams with all beginning play in the division quarterfinal round. The league also would hold a third place game in alternating years starting with 2012. When the national tournament expanded to 8 teams in 2015, it began offering three automatic bids to the OUA, causing the conference to make the third place game a permanent fixture.\nAs a result of the restrictions during the 2021–22 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league was temporarily rearranged into four division. Additionally, all rounds were switched to single-elimination for this season. Furthermore, the teams were not reseeded after the first round due to the short time between matches. After the COVID restrictions ended, the league contracted its tournament, limiting entry to 12 teams and giving byes to the top two teams from each division.\nTournaments.\n1998.\n&lt;br&gt;\n2005.\n&lt;br&gt;\n2021.\n\"Season cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic\"\n2022.\n&lt;br&gt;\nReferences.\nMen's Hockey Champions"

        "title": "National Women's Basketball Association",
        "text": "The National Women's Basketball Association (NWBA) was an American women's basketball league that intended to play its first full regular season in 1986–87. Headquartered in Lake Wylie, South Carolina—a suburb of Charlotte, North Carolina—and owned by Howard Hanson, the league planned to start with eight teams, primarily in the Southeastern United States. It struggled to sign marquee players because of concerns about its amateur status and consequent effects on Olympic eligibility, and ticket sales were slow. While several exhibitions were held, a key financial backer failed to fulfill his commitment, and no regular-season games were played. The league, indebted, formally canceled the season by the end of 1986.\nAnnouncement.\nThe formation of the league was unveiled in April 1986. Its owner, Howard Hanson, declared that the league would avoid the financial pitfalls that doomed two prior attempts—the Women's American Basketball Association and Women's Basketball League—by controlling costs. The eight teams would be centrally owned by the league for several years, and the teams would pay salaries of $10,000 to $18,000 to their twelve players. Games would be played on weekends only in a regular season extending from November through May. There would be an all-star game in January and playoffs in May, with all eight teams qualifying.\nIn early June, the league held a territorial draft, assigning players to teams based on their college locations in a process similar to that used by the United States Football League. The concept was to draw fans based on players who had played college basketball in the same general area. Cheryl Miller was selected first overall, but Miller—who became aware of the NWBA only by reading newspaper reports—refused to play in the new league because she could make more from commercial endorsement deals than the $18,000 maximum salary. With no coaches formally hired, the draft was conducted by the league office. Kim Boatman of \"The Knoxville News-Sentinel\" criticized the draft as evincing unfamiliarity with women's college basketball, noting that many talented players were ignored and that the Southeastern Conference was underrepresented. Later that month, the league held tryouts in Charlotte; Orange County, California; Hartford, Connecticut; and Tulsa, Oklahoma, to search for players.\nSeveral teams moved or changed names in the planning stages. The Cincinnati Tiger-Cats had been relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, as the Tennessee Tigercats by late May. By that same time period, the Virginia Mermaids, to play in Richmond, had been renamed the Express. Some cities, though small, were chosen for their support of women's college basketball. For instance, Monroe, Louisiana, had good support for the women's teams at Northeast Louisiana University, and Louisiana Tech University was 30 minutes away.\nThe most drastic move came from the Iowa franchise—announced as the Iowa Aces, to play in Cedar Rapids, at the 7,500-seat Five Seasons Center. That news came as a surprise to management of the Five Seasons Center, which had not heard from the team. The center's commissioners worried that the Aces would face poor ticket sales in light of competition from Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball in nearby Iowa City and high school sports; its manager pointed out that the arena was booked for key February and March dates by such events as the Home Show and Country Art Fair. By mid-June, the league was analyzing moving the team out of Cedar Rapids, though Bruce Mason—a former assistant coach at Drake University who had been involved with the WBL's Iowa Coronets—doubted that arrangements could be made there.\nIn August, the league announced at a press conference that Wanda Ford, a star at Drake, was considering signing with the Iowa team, which had been renamed the Pride of Iowa and moved to Des Moines. However, Ford was still concerned about losing her amateur status—and thus her eligibility to compete in the 1988 Summer Olympics—were she to sign with the league. Other big names, like Kamie Ethridge and Fran Harris, opted to wait for the league to obtain this status. An October 3 deadline for an announcement on the matter came and went. Ultimately, Ford chose to play in Italy, preserving her amateur status and Olympic eligibility. Cindy Brogdon, the anticipated star player for the Georgia Peaches, opted out two weeks before the season was to start.\nFinancial issues and cancellation.\nFinancial concerns continued to hang over the new league. In July, Leonard Laye of \"The Charlotte Observer\" wrote a feature story that included troubling signs of the league. No contracts had been signed for any of the venues. Deadlines to hire coaches had come and gone, and announced hirings of Richard Keast in Georgia and Charlotte Mason in Texas failed to materialize; additionally, the league was late to sign any players. For others, such as Pat Summitt, the poor track record of startup women's basketball leagues was enough to cause concern. Acting commissioner Wayne Fulcher claimed that the league had enough investor backing to run a season without gate receipts or television contract money, but the league was reticent to discuss its finances.\nSeason ticket sales started very slowly. By early September, the league had sold just 50 season tickets, each worth $200, across its markets. The league's offering struggled to coexist with more popular, and often cheaper, college season ticket packages in the same markets. For instance, in Knoxville, the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers sold season tickets for $50, but even after cutting prices, a full season of Tigercats basketball cost $150. To cut expenses, the league office moved to smaller quarters in Pineville, North Carolina, another Charlotte suburb. Fulcher stated that, for the Virginia Express to break even, the team would need to attract 1,000 fans. Another way the league hoped to raise money was by selling a \"founder's package\", consisting of a T-shirt, medallion, and certificate. The league contacted college programs and asked them to buy the packages so players could resell them. Bernadette McGlade, the head women's basketball coach at Georgia Tech, derided the concept as \"like something from grammar school, making money for a class trip\"; Howard Hanson later said it was a mistake not to seek corporate support first.\nAs the season approached, some teams were in much better shape than others, and several teams began playing exhibitions. On October 19, the league held a jamboree exhibition event in Charlotte, which was intended to feature all eight teams. Only four teams played: Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia. The Pride of Iowa also made the trip but not to play; the franchise still needed players to fill out its roster, with only six signed players as of October 3. Its office telephone had been disconnected, and the Veterans Memorial Auditorium—which demanded money up front because the defunct Coronets still owed the arena—began booking other events on dates scheduled for the team's home games. California, Louisiana, and Texas did not make the trip, per commissioner Fulcher, \"to work on promotions in their area\"; the primary reason Texas failed to show was that the team had no point guard on its roster. The event, which the league hoped would attract as many as 1,000, was reported by the league to have an attendance between 300 and 400; Stan Olson of \"The Observer\" cited a headcount of 188. The league sent a bus to Knoxville to pick up the Tigercats; by the time it got there, it was running on empty, forcing coach Gina DiCicco to pay for gas.\nMichael Kramer, a California investor contacted in August, failed to fulfill his $2.6 million investment commitment in the NWBA. As a result, at an October 25 meeting in Atlanta, the league postponed the start of the season from November 1 to December 5; Kramer stated he was trying to raise the money, while teams were not informed of his withdrawal for 30 days, preventing them from securing other funding sources. Unpaid bills were piling up, including hotels, telephone service, and liability insurance through Mutual of Omaha. With the postponement, Dave Wolter, head coach of the California Stars, told \"The Observer\" that the team had ceased practicing and he had resigned, with his lone paycheck bouncing; Gina DiCicco announced that all local operations of the Tennessee Tigercats had folded, and half of her ten-player squad had departed. Texas Twisters coach Gary Orr's lone paycheck also bounced, as did several player paychecks. Orr was $10,000 in debt after running the Twisters for two months. On November 21, the postponement became indefinite; the league abandoned its headquarters, and the telephones there were disconnected.\nThe Carolina Blaze were the last team to stay together, through the end of 1986, but coach Angie Rinehart folded the team after no movement toward starting the season took place. The league formally canceled its operations at the end of January 1987, some $150,000 in debt. Molly Bolin, hired as an assistant commissioner, recalled the league never reimbursed her for travel to the Iowa press conference. Fulcher, the acting commissioner, reported that he was still under contract but not being paid.\nTeams.\nThe NWBA intended to field eight teams:\nA ninth team was cited as a possibility for Columbia, South Carolina, if enough season tickets were sold there."

Starting in 2012, France has toured Argentina in a two-test series in the year directly following the Rugby World Cup (RWC). However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 tour was cancelled.\nReported in April 2023, the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR) announced key dates for the 2023–24 season, with news of a French tour of Argentina. As the tour is only on a two-test basis, speculation mounted over a possible third match against either Chile or Uruguay. A match against Uruguay was confirmed in April 2024. France will also play a match against a World XV at the San Mamés Stadium in Bilbao, Spain, as a pre-tour warm-up on 22 June.\nAs well as being toured by France more than any other team, France is also Argentina's most-played fixture, having faced each other more than 50 times. It is also expected to be France coach Fabien Galthié's first tour of Argentina, and the first international tests for new \"Pumas\" coach Felipe Contepomi, who captained Argentina against France on their 2012 tour."

        "text": "P. Sean Jackson (born ) is an American former college basketball player for the Ohio Bobcats and Princeton Tigers. He was the 1992 Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year and earned first team All-Ivy League recognition for both the 1990–91 and 1991–92 Princeton Tigers teams. He earned three Ivy League basketball championships as a player. In high school, he led Vinson High School to the 1986 West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission (WVSSAC) Class A state basketball championship as a junior and a one-point 1987 Class AA basketball championship game loss as a senior. He earned multiple All-state recognitions in both basketball and baseball. Vinson won the Class A state baseball championship in 1986 and was Class A baseball runner up in 1985.\nJackson holds the Princeton records for single-season three-point shots (95), and consecutive games with a three-point shot (56). He has also set the Ivy League record for single-season three-point shots made in conference games (56). He is listed among the all-time career three-point field goal percentages in the NCAA annual record book. Jackson formerly held Princeton records for both career and single-game three-point shots made. The Ivy League record book is silent on a possible consecutive games with a three-point shot record. After basketball, he had a career as a highly rated internet analyst.\nHigh school career.\nAs a sophomore, Jackson posted 35 points for Vinson in a 1985 WVSSAC Class A tournament game against Notre Dame, which ranked tied for 8th in State Class A history as of 2014. As a junior, Jackson led Vinson High School of Huntington, West Virginia to the 1986 WVSSAC Class A state championship game victory over Notre Dame. As a senior, he led the school to a 1987 Class AA championship game loss against Central High School of Wheeling, West Virginia. Both his 1986 and 1987 teams finished 26–1 with the 1986 team winning the championship game by a 96–80 margin and the 1987 team losing 59–58. As a senior, he averaged 25.6 points per game. Vinson's home arena was the storied Vinson Gymnatorium. During Jackson's 3 years as a varsity basketball starter the team went 72–4, while he was named first team All-State as both a junior and senior. He had athletic scholarship offers from Delaware, Charlotte and James Madison. \nJackson also played baseball while in high school. He had been twice named All-State in baseball by April 1987 (before his senior season). Vinson won the WVSSAC Class A state championship over Van in 1986 and was Class A runner up to Coalton in 1985.\nCollege career.\nJackson played his freshman season for the 1987–88 Ohio Bobcats men's basketball team before sitting out a season and transferring to Princeton. That team included two future National Basketball Association players: Paul Graham and Dave Jamerson. \nJackson became the first transfer student of the Pete Carril era at Princeton for the 1989–90 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team, which was Carril's 23rd season at Princeton. The team was coming off of an Ivy League championship season that was highlighted by a 1989 NCAA tournament with the memorable 1989 Georgetown vs. Princeton game. At the time of that game, Jackson had been on campus as a student sitting out of athletic competition for a year due to the transfer rules at the time. As a redshirt sophomore transfer, Jackson stepped into the role that had previously been played by Bob Scrabis and was one of the key players on the team. He and George Leftwich gave Princeton one of the quickest backcourt combinations in recent school history. Jackson earned Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Week on January 7, 1990. The Princeton record book omits Jackson's January 8, 1990 rivalry game 24-point 7–8 three-point field goal performance against , but \"The Harvard Crimson\" and \"Philadelphia Daily News\" noted it, giving him a share of the school single-game three-point shots made record until Matt Lapin made 8 against on February 24, 1990. He averaged 11.1 points per game that year. That year's Tigers included Ivy League Player of the Year Kit Mueller. The team won the Ivy League regular season and entered the 1990 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament with a 13-seed. They lost to 4-seed Arkansas 68–64. Jackson opened the game with a pair of three point shots as Princeton held early leads of 10–2 and 20–9. They still led 56–55 lead with 6:25 before surrendering the lead and the game.\nJackson's February 8, 1991, 5–5 three-point shot performance against stood as a shared school and shared Ivy League record for single-game three point shots without a miss until Sydney Johnson set the current school record (6) six seasons later. He earned Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Week on March 4, 1991. As of the 2015–16 season, his 56 three-point shots made during the 1990–91 Ivy League 14 conference game schedule stood as an Ivy League conference single-season record. Jackson's 95 three-point shots made led the Ivy League. Mueller repeated as Ivy Player of the Year. Jackson credits Mueller as the biggest reason for the team's continuing success. Jackson's three-point shooting efforts supported Mueller and resulted in an undefeated 14–0 conference record for the 1990–91 Tigers, which was the first undefeated Ivy League season by any school since the 1975–76 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team. Following the season, he was named First Team All-Ivy League honoree for the 1990–91 team. That year, the team repeated for a third consecutive season as Ivy League champions to earn a bid to the 1991 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as 8-seeds where they lost to Villanova 50–48.\nAs a redshirt senior for the 1991–92 Tigers, Jackson served as co-captain with Matthew C. Eastwick, and George H. Leftwich. On January 4, 1992, after Princeton fell behind 46-36 with 7:34 time remaining against , Jackson helped Princeton close out the game on an 11-point run (including 2 Jackson three-point shots) to finish with 20 points and a perfect 4-4 three-point second half. He earned his final Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Week recognition on January 7, 1992. His 84 three-point shots made led the Ivy League. Jackson was the leading scorer of the 4-time Ivy League champion Tigers. He was again named First Team All-Ivy League honoree and was named 1992 Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year. The 1991–92 team earned a fourth consecutive Ivy League championship and went to the 1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a 11-seed against Syracuse. Jackson went into the tournament with the third best three point shooting percentage in the nation (48.1%). Jackson led the team in scoring with 13 points, but the team lost 51–43.\nJackson's single-season totals of 95 (1990–91) and 84 (1991–92) three-point shots made are first and second in the 2023 Princeton record book. His streak of 56 consecutive games with a made three-point shot still stands as a school record, according to the same source. Jackson's 3-year total of 235 three-point shots made was a school record for career three-point shots made until Brian Earl set the current record in 4 years with 281 seven seasons later. His 243/528 (46.02%) career three-point shooting percentage was listed 10th in the annual update of the top 25 listing in the NCAA's 2022-23 Division I Men's Basketball Record book. When he established his three-point shot records, the three-point line was at , but for the 2008–09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, the line was extended to . For the 2019–20 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, the line was further extended to .\nPost-collegiate.\nAfter graduating from Princeton in 1992, Jackson attended Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in the Chicago metropolitan area to attain an Master of Business Administration before moving to begin his career in Nashville. During his time in business school, he began playing in competitive 3x3 basketball with John W. Rogers Jr., Mueller and Craig Robinson. The team won many tournaments and qualified for the world championships. In a 2001 Best on the Street: 2001 Analysts Survey published in \"The Wall Street Journal\", Jackson, who held the title of director of stock research at SunTrust Equitable Securities Corp., the investment-banking [sic] subsidiary of SunTrust Banks Inc. was ranked as \"third in Internet stock-picking\" among analysts on Wall Street.\nPersonal life.\nAs of 2010, Sean and Suzanne Jackson lived in Tennessee with their 9-year-old competitive youth golfing son named Zach and 7-year-old basketball-loving son named Luke."

        "text": "The 2024 Indianapolis 500, branded as the 108th Running of the Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge for sponsorship reasons, is a 500-mile (804.5 km, 200 lap) race in the 2024 IndyCar Series, scheduled for Sunday, May 26, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, United States. The month of May activities will formally begin on Saturday, May 11 with the Sonsio Grand Prix on the combined road course. Practice on the oval is slated to begin on May 14. Time trials will take place on May 18–19, while Carb Day, the traditional final day of practice, along with the Pit Stop Challenge, will be May 24.\nJosef Newgarden of Penske Racing enters the race as the defending winner. Four-time winner Hélio Castroneves is attempting to become the first five-time race winner, and five-time polesitter Scott Dixon has the chance to tie Rick Mears for most career Indy poles (six). For the first time since 2014, a driver will attempt \"Double Duty\". Kyle Larson, the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series champion, will attempt to compete in both the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on the same day.\nRace background.\nThe Indianapolis 500, commonly called the Indy 500, is held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a paved oval superspeedway. The track, built in 1909, is a rounded rectangle, with four distinct turns of identical dimensions, connected by four straightaways (two long straightaways and two \"short chutes\"). The turns are banked at 9°12', considered modest for oval track standards in the U.S. Traditionally, the field consists of 33 starters, aligned in a starting grid of eleven rows of three cars apiece. Drivers race 200 laps, counter-clockwise around the circuit, for a distance of . The first \"500\" was held in 1911, and the race has been held continuously except during World War I (1917–1918) and during World War II (1942–1945). The track is nicknamed the \"Brickyard\", as the racing surface was paved in brick during the fall of 1909. The track surface has long since been paved over in asphalt, with most of the original bricks remaining deep underneath. A single yard of bricks remains exposed at the start/finish line.\nThe event is contested by \"Indy cars\", a formula of professional-level, single-seat, open cockpit, open-wheel, purpose-built race cars. The race is the most prestigious event of the IndyCar calendar, and one of the oldest and most important automobile races in the world.\nThe race is sanctioned by INDYCAR, and pays points toward the NTT IndyCar Series championship. The drivers come from a broad range of racing experience, with many having climbed the ladder of the \"Road to Indy\". Some drivers arrive at Indy with previous experience in Sports car racing (IMSA, SCCA), NASCAR, and Formula One.\nIn the event of a rain delay, the race will be halted and postponed until precipitation ceases, and the track is dried. The race is considered official once more than 50% of the laps have been completed (i.e. 101 laps). In case of rain or darkness, officials can end the race early if more than 101 laps have been completed; if fewer than 101 laps have been recorded, the resumption will be scheduled for the next possible day. The track does not have permanent lighting, making it unsuitable for night racing. If there is a late-race caution period, the race does not employ a green-white-checker rule to extend the race beyond its advertised distance. However, at the officials' discretion, a late-race red flag may be used to help provide for a finish under green flag conditions.\nSponsorship.\nOn May 25, 2022, it was announced that online financial services company Gainbridge reached a multiyear agreement to extend their presenting sponsorship of the Indianapolis 500. The extension was for an undisclosed length. This will be the second year under the current deal. Gainbridge originally signed a four-year deal which was in place from 2019 to 2022.\n2024 IndyCar Series.\nThe 2024 Indianapolis 500 will be the fifth points-paying race (and sixth overall) of the 2024 NTT IndyCar Series season. Josef Newgarden initially won the season opener at St. Petersburg, but on April 24 he was disqualified for violating push-to-pass parameters. Pato O'Ward was declared the winner. Álex Palou won the non-points event at the Thermal Club, Scott Dixon won at Long Beach and Scott McLaughlin won at Alabama. The championship season will continue, and the month of May activities will begin, with the Sonsio Grand Prix on the IMS road course.\nRace schedules.\nThe 2024 IndyCar Series schedule was announced on September 25, 2023, with the Indianapolis 500 scheduled for Sunday, May 26. Practice, time trials, and other ancillary events are scheduled for the two weeks leading up to the race. The Speedway hosted an eclipse-viewing event on April 8 in conjunction with Purdue University, followed by the annual Open Test held on April 10–11. The test days will include additional rookie orientation sessions and refresher tests as needed. The Sonsio Grand Prix, including the Indy NXT and other Road to Indy races, will serve as the opening weekend of track activity on May 10–11.\nEntry list.\nAll entries will utilize a spec Dallara IR18 chassis with universal aero kit and 2020-adopted aeroscreen. Honda (HRC) and Chevrolet (Ilmor) are the current engine providers. Firestone is the exclusive tire supplier. There are currently 35 confirmed entries for the race, including eight former winners and seven race rookies.\nFour-time race winner Hélio Castroneves will attempt to make his 24th \"500\" (all consecutive), leading all active drivers. Former winner Tony Kanaan retired after the 2023 race, and 2019 winner Simon Pagenaud will not participate, as he is still recovering from injures suffered in a crash at Mid-Ohio in July 2023. 2021 NASCAR Cup Series champion Kyle Larson will attempt to make the race and become the fifth driver to complete \"Double Duty\", racing the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day.\nCallum Ilott substituted for the injured David Malukas in the No. 6 Arrow McLaren entry during the April Open test. Malukas was later released by the team before the 500; his replacement has not yet been named.\nTesting and Rookie Orientation.\nRookie rules for the Indianapolis 500 include the mandate that a driver pass a supervised high-speed oval test before he/she is allowed to participate in the official Rookie Orientation Program (ROP) at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Approved venues for the initial high-speed oval track test include Texas Motor Speedway, Homestead–Miami Speedway, and a few other select venues.\nThe Rookie Orientation Program at Indianapolis consists of three phases. For phase 1, each driver was required to complete ten laps between , while demonstrating satisfactory car control, proper racing line, and safe interaction with other cars on the circuit. The laps do not have to be consecutive. Phase 2 was fifteen laps between , and phase 3 was fifteen laps over . Veteran drivers that have not competed in an IndyCar oval race since the previous year's Indy 500 are required to take a refresher test. The refresher test consists of phase 2 and phase 3 of the aforementioned rookie test.\nRookie Orientation - October 2023.\nThe Rookie Orientation Program was held October 11–12, 2023. Four drivers were scheduled to participate: Marcus Armstrong, Linus Lundqvist, Tom Blomqvist and 2021 NASCAR Cup Series champion Kyle Larson. Armstrong, Lundqvist, and Blomqvist had each participated the previous month in high-speed oval rookie test at Texas, which gave them eligibility to participate. Rookie Kyffin Simpson was ineligible to participate, having yet to complete the Texas test. The officials ruled that Larson exempt from the Texas test due to his extensive experience on high-speed ovals in NASCAR competition.\nArmstrong, Lundqvist, and Blomqvist each passed all three phases of the rookie test on Wednesday. The three drivers completed a total of 285 laps without major incident. Lundqvist reportedly suffered some mechanical problems, but was able to return to the track and finish his test. Larson, who is preparing to do \"Double Duty\", arrived and completed his test on Thursday. Larson took his first ever laps in an Indy car, logging a total of 72 laps without incident.\nHybrid testing - October 2023.\nA private offseason test was held October 12–13, 2023 for hybrid energy recovery system testing. Two Honda teams, Andretti Global (Colton Herta &amp; Marcus Ericsson) and Chip Ganassi Racing (Álex Palou) and two Chevrolet teams, Arrow McLaren (Alexander Rossi &amp; David Malukas) and Team Penske (Will Power) participated. The six drivers completed a total of 1,325 laps with no incidents reported.\nOval evaluation testing (Phoenix) - February 2024.\nRace rookie Kyle Larson conducted an oval evaluation test with Arrow McLaren at Phoenix Raceway on February 5. It was Larson's first time driving an Indy car since he participated in rookie orientation the previous October. Larson completed 172 laps without major incident. During his final stint, Larson reported that he nearly spun out in turn one, but was able to regain control of the car.\nRookie oval test (Texas) - March 2024.\nThe series hosted a high-speed oval rookie evaluation test at Texas Motor Speedway on March 27. Three drivers participated: Kyffin Simpson, Christian Rasmussen, and Nolan Siegel. Veteran drivers Ed Carpenter and Álex Palou were also there in compliance with Series rules to shake down their team cars and establish a base setup. Rasmussen completed 134 laps, Kyiffin completed 202 laps, and Siegel completed 146 laps. All three drivers completed their evaluations and were approved to take the Rookie Orientation Program at the April Open Test at Indianapolis.\nOpen Test Day 2 — Thursday April 11, 2024.\nThe second scheduled day of the Open Test was cancelled due to rainfall throughout the day.\nBroadcasting.\nThe race will be carried live on television in the United States on NBC Sports, except in Indianapolis due to long standing blackout policies, where it will be shown tape delayed on WTHR. Peacock will also be blacking out streams of the race itself."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Tennessee",
        "text": "Tennessee has seen slow but steady growth with ice hockey since the late 1990s. Since the arrival of the Nashville Predators, the sport has grown in the Volunteer State far faster than most other southern states.\nHistory.\nBeginning in the mid 60s, Tennessee was the target for expansion with minor professional ice hockey teams. The three largest cities in the state, Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville all received teams during this time. There was some mild success on the ice but none of the teams were able to capture the public interest and all were gone within a decade. Aother than an abortive attempt in the early 1980s, the state remained without an established team for over 15 years.\nA second concerted effort brought the sport back to the Volunteer State in the form of the Knoxville Cherokees. The team had four winning seasons in nine years and never made it past the first round of the playoffs, however, the Cherokees were still able to bring in crowds of increasing size. By 1997 the average attendance had risen from about 2,100 per game to nearly 3,500 and was continuing to trend upwards. Though the team moved to Florida in 1997, their box office success helped to bring two other teams to the state. The Memphis RiverKings arrived with great fanfare in 1992, drawing crowds of more than 5,000 for their first two years. Afterwards, the attendance figures steadily declined over time but remained strong enough for the team to stick around for 15 years. In that time, Memphis was a pair of league championships before moving just across the border to Southaven, Mississippi.\nIn 1989, the Nashville Knights had a strong start just like the RiverKings, however, their attendance declined at a much quicker rate. The team survived for seven seasons before relocating to Florida. Not willing to give up on the market, a CHL team began in 1996. The Nashville Ice Flyers / Nighthawks saw modest attendance figures for their two years of existence but the team was playing on borrowed time as plans to begin the Nashville Predators had kicked off in early 1997.\nUpon their arrival, the Predators were one of several new teams in the south, along with the Carolina Hurricanes, Florida Panthers, Dallas Stars and Tampa Bay Lightning. However, the team was unable to form any rivalry with their southern counterparts as the team was placed in a division with Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis. The team also failed to make the postseason for the first five years and, while that wasn't entirely unexpected, it did nothing to help the growth of the sport in the region. Nashville made its first postseason appearance in 2004 but then saw any gains they had made be washed away by the NHL lockout. Nashville began to see much greater success after 2005 and finished with a winning record for seven consecutive seasons. After the arrival of P. K. Subban in 2016, Nashville made its first trip to the Stanley Cup Finals and followed that up by winning the Presidents' Trophy the next season. Aside from his prowess on the ice, Subban was also important for be the first black leader for the franchise and sell itself to the sizable minority community in the state.\nThroughout its history, Tennessee had never been home to a single college ice hockey program but that changed in 2023. Tennessee State announced that it was starting a club ice hockey team in 2024 and would hope to promote it to varsity status in the near future. While those plans in an of themselves weren't unique, Tennessee State is a HBCU and would be the first of its kind in the nation to ice a team. Additionally, Tennessee State would be just the second college in the south to support a varsity program if their plans come to fruition, with the only other previous team being Alabama–Huntsville.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nDue in no small part to the dearth of junior hockey in the state, Tennessee has produced very few home grown players. However, the state has seen an increase in the number of players with Tennessee falling in the middle third in the nation with just under 5,000 residents registered with USA Hockey in 2022. By percentage, that accounts for approximately 0.07% of the population, or about 1 in every 1,400 people."

        "text": "The fourth series of Race Across the World began airing on 10 April 2024. Each two-person team was required to complete the route from Japan to Indonesia without using air travel, and was given a budget equal to the cost of the air fare. Contestants were provided with only a map, travel guide and GPS tracker.\nOn 27 March 2024, the BBC announced that the fourth series of Race Across the World would begin airing on 10 April. The five pairs of competitors are Brydie and Sharon, Alfie and Owen, Stephen and Viv, Eugenie and Isabel and Betty and James.\nOverview.\nThe fourth series of \"Race Across the World\" is a race over that takes place entirely in Eastern Asia, commencing in Sapporo on the island of Hokkaido in Japan and finishing on the island of Lombok in the Indonesian archipelago of Lesser Sunda.\nThe race had seven checkpoints with enforced rest periods, with contestants only finding out the next destination on departure from a checkpoint. The first team to arrive at the final checkpoint wins £20,000.\nTeams were given a budget of £1,390 per person – the equivalent air fare for travelling the race route. Contestants were not permitted to subsidise their budgets, but short-term opportunities allowed them to work for money or bed and board. Contestants were not given access to telephones or internet.\nResults summary.\nColour key:\nRoute.\nThe checkpoints in the fourth series were:\nRace summary.\nLeg 1: Sapporo, Japan → Nara, Japan.\nHaving checked in at the Gokoku shrine the race started in earnest at 2 pm from Odori Park in the city of Sapporo on the northernmost Japanese island of Hokkaido, with the first leg finishing south in the old imperial capital, Nara, on the main island of Honshu.\nIn an added twist to the usual rules, the teams were not permitted to use any Shinkansen (bullet trains) whilst in Japan.\nThree teams took a train to the nearby port of Tomakomai. Eugenie &amp; Isabel managed to catch an overnight ferry across the Tsugaru Strait to Sendai, whilst both Brydie &amp; Sharon and Betty &amp; James took the last ferry of the night to Hachinohe. The next day, Brydie &amp; Sharon headed towards Tōnō en route to Tokyo, while Betty &amp; James caught a train to Sendai, on the east coast of Honshu. Already in Sendai, Eugenie &amp; Isabel decided to avoid Tokyo, the only team to do so, fearing the capital to be very expensive, and so took a bus to Niigata on the west coast. Betty &amp; James took an excursion to Matsushima Bay before heading to Tokyo to work cleaning rickshaws. \nAlfie &amp; Owen were the first pair to reach the capital having arrived by bus where they witnessed a baby crying contest at the Naki Sumo festival before continuing to Mount Fuji by bus. There, on day 4, they undertook work cleaning at the campsite they had pitched their tents at. Having lost their map and stranded in the countryside, the pair backtracked to Tokyo before heading to Kyoto the next morning by bus.\nMeanwhile Stephen &amp; Viv visited an Onsen in Aomori before heading to Tokyo and onward to a job harvesting wasabi at a farm in Hotaka in exchange for bed and board. One of the farmers then dropped the pair at Matsumoto station where the pair caught a train to Kashihara, just south of Nara. In Tokyo, Brydie &amp; Sharon took a train to Toba to wait on tables at a restaurant run by the local Ama women, whilst Betty &amp; James proceeded directly to Osaka. \nEugenie &amp; Isabel took a ferry to the small island of Sado in the Sea of Japan to visit the Myosenji Buddhist temple. Once back on Honshu they caught a bus to Kanazawa and then a train to Nara. Once the teams had arrived in Nara, they had to find their way to the Gango-ji temple before receiving instructions to the checkpoint which was at the Nara hotel. Finding themselves in a foot race with Alfie &amp; Owen, Eugenie &amp; Isabel beat them by a matter of minutes.\nLeg 2: Nara, Japan → Sokcho, South Korea.\nThe race restarted on day 7 to Sokcho in South Korea, a country which could only be reached by taking a ferry across the Korea Strait, from Hakata on the Japanese island of Kyushu to the port city of Busan. \nBetty &amp; James were the only team to cross onto the island of Shikoku (via the Great Naruto Bridge), where they helped trim some Japanese Acers to be used as garnish on Japanese food. They then caught a bus onward to Tokushima station where they just missed the only train of the day to Okayama delaying them for twenty-four hours. Brydie &amp; Sharon had gone directly to Okayama to work aboard a fishing boat on the Seto Inland Sea but were also stranded for a day due to the lack of trains.  \nAlfie &amp; Owen made their way to Kobe where the latter wanted to sample the famous Kobe beef despite Alfie’s concerns about the impact it would have on their budget. Much to Alfie’s relief and joy, the proprietor of the restaurant comped the meal. Afterwards the pair checked into a capsule hotel for the night. The next day they were repeatedly advised by the locals that reservations onward to Hakata should be made online. Stymied without internet access, a good samaritan eventually made the reservations on their behalf. \nStephen &amp; Viv headed to northern Kansai in search of work repairing a thatched roof in exchange for bed and board. However, poor weather meant they were unable to repay their hosts hospitality due to safety concerns, so they insisted on cleaning the shrine instead. Afterwards the pair backtracked to Osaka and caught an overnight bus to Hiroshima. Already in Hiroshima, in search of a job opportunity as they had depleted almost a third of their entire race budget, were Eugenie &amp; Isabel. There they paid their respects at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park after which they did a one hour shift in an Okonomiyaki restaurant, but instead of cooking, the duo found themselves washing dishes to due their late arrival.\nOn day 8, Alfie &amp; Owen found themselves on the same ferry crossing as Eugenie &amp; Isabel. On their arrival at the Hakata ferry port, Stephen &amp; Viv were disappointed to learn that they had missed the only two daily crossings and would now have to wait until the next day, when they were caught up by both Brydie &amp; Sharon and Betty &amp; James. \nOn arrival in South Korea, Alfie &amp; Owen immediately commenced traversing up the Korean peninsula by buses hugging the eastern seaboard, whereas Eugenie &amp; Isabel replenished funds by working at the Jagalchi Fish Market alongside the Ajummas (old lady vendors). When the other three teams finally made it to Busan, Betty &amp; James caught the last bus to Seoul but Brydie &amp; Sharon opted to spend a night in the city before making their way to Daejeon the next day to work collecting chestnuts. Stephen &amp; Viv meanwhile headed across the peninsula to Jeonju Hanok Village to work a shift dishwashing at a restaurant that specialised in Bibimbap. \nOn day 11 Eugenie &amp; Isabel finally headed to Sokcho on a direct bus service, whilst Alfie &amp; Owen were killing time by visiting Haesindang Park in Samcheok. In Sokcho the teams were advised to take a taxi to the Seokbong Ceramics Museum of Art. From there it was onto the Cheongchojeong and finally to the checkpoint. Alfie &amp; Owen opted to walk in a bid to conserve funds and found themselves finishing four hours behind Eugenie &amp; Isabel. When the other three teams finally arrived the overall positions had not changed, however the time differential between first and last place had grown to over thirty hours. \nLeg 3: Hanoi, Vietnam → Phnom Penh, Cambodia.\nThe race restarted on days 14 and 15 when the teams were transferred by air to Hanoi in Vietnam. It was revealed that the checkpoint was in Phnom Penh, capital city of Cambodia, to the south, and that the team finishing last on this leg would be eliminated.\nAll of the teams decided to head south towards Da Nang. Three teams aimed for Ho Chi Minh City whilst the other two opted for the Lệ Thanh – Ou Ya Dav border crossing near Pleiku in the central highlands.\nFirst to leave, having lost their map and still in need of replenishing their budget, Eugenie &amp; Isabel decided to initially make for Ninh Binh by bus to work washing motorcycles. Not soon after Alfie &amp; Owen started their journey to Ho Chi Minh City by catching an overnight train to Da Nang. The next day both Betty &amp; James and Stephen &amp; Viv also headed there by the cheaper but somewhat ironically, faster bus. In Da Nang, Betty &amp; James caught up to Eugenie &amp; Isabel when both teams found themselves at the same bus station headed to Pleiku. In Pleiku both pairs crossed the border to Banlung on the same bus service. Being the first day of a Cambodian national holiday, onward transport options were limited and the two teams parted ways. Betty &amp; James' attempt at earning money at a rubber plantation in a small village were scuppered by torrential rainfall and they were stranded there waiting for the weather to clear.\nMeanwhile, Stephen &amp; Viv continued onto Nha Trang from Da Nang by rail on their way to Ho Chi Minh City. Arriving after 30 hours, the pair took time to recuperate at the local mud baths before heading first to Da Lat where they stayed overnight in a glamping tent before working a shift picking coffee beans on a coffee plantation for their bed and board and then onto Ho Chi Minh City by bus where they hoped to catch an onward connection to Chau Doc. In Chau Doc, they learnt of a ferry that traversed up the Mekong River to Phnom Penh but needed to take a taxi to catch it. \nHaving detoured through Hoi An, once in Ho Chi Minh City, Alfie &amp; Owen worked in a nightclub, whereas Brydie &amp; Sharon headed further south to Can Tho to work at a floating market before taking a taxi to the border. The former pair crossed into Cambodia at the border village of Kaam Samnor and hitched a lift to the capital. Also in Phnom Penh, but having arrived via a very expensive taxi journey were Betty &amp; James. The teams were first given instructions to proceed to Wat Phnom and then by Tuk Tuk across the Japanese Bridge to a park containing the Neang Prachha Barami (clever woman) statue. Thereafter made their way to the checkpoint at the Sokha Hotel with Alfie &amp; Owen arriving first on day 18 of the race. The last pair to arrive were Brydie &amp; Sharon and therefore eliminated.\nLeg 4: Phnom Penh, Cambodia → Mae Sariang, Thailand.\nThe race continued from Phnom Penh in Cambodia with the fourth leg finishing in Mae Sariang, Thailand."

It will be held in August–September 2024 in a host nation to be determined.\nStarting with this edition, the tournament will be expanded to include 24 teams instead of the 16 teams of previous editions following the decision adopted by FIVB in June 2023.\nChina are the defending champions.\nCompetition formula changes.\nIn June 2023 during a three-day meeting in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, the FIVB Board of Administration approved the proposal made by its Volleyball Council to increase the number of participating teams to 24 in its Age Group World Championships (U19 and U21 in both genders). Consequently, the distribution of quotas by confederation for the Women's U21 World Championship was modified regarding previous editions, ensuring one automatic quota for the defending champion and assigning two quotas based on the corresponding FIVB Age Group World Ranking.\nThe new competition formula was in line with the one adopted for the 2023 FIVB Volleyball Boys' U19 World Championship, which was also contested by 24 teams.\nHost selection.\nOn 28 March 2024, FIVB opened the bidding process for member associations whose countries were interested in hosting one of the four Age Group World Championships in 2025 (i.e., U19 Boys' and Girls' World Championships and U21 Men's and Women's World Championships). The expression of interest of the member associations had to be submitted to FIVB by 30 April 2024, 18:00 CEST ().\nQualification.\nA total of 24 national teams will qualify for the final tournament. In addition to the host team and the defending champions who qualified automatically, 21 other teams will qualify through five separate continental competitions which were required to be held no later than 31 December 2024. Two remaining teams will enter the tournament via the Women's U21 FIVB World Ranking (as of 31 December 2024) among the teams not yet qualified.\nThe slot allocation per confederation was set as follows:"

        "text": "The 2024 World Masters of Snooker (officially the 2024 Riyadh Season World Masters of Snooker) was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place from 4 to 6 March 2024 at the Global Theatre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and part of the Riyadh Season festival in the entertainment district Boulevard City within Riyadh, the event was the first professional snooker tournament held in Saudi Arabia, and the inaugural staging of the World Masters of Snooker. It introduced a new 20-point gold ball called the \"Riyadh Season ball\", which could only be after a player had completed a maximum break of 147 to extend the break to 167. The event was broadcast locally in the Middle East and North Africa and worldwide. The winner received £250,000 from a total prize fund of £785,000.\nThe event featured 12 players, including the top ten players on the snooker world rankings, with the reigning World Champion, Luca Brecel, as the top seed, as well as two local wildcard players, Ali Alobaidli from Qatar and Omar Alajlani from Saudi Arabia.\nWorld number one player Ronnie O'Sullivan won the event, defeating Brecel 52 in the final, capturing his fifth professional title of the 2023–24 season.\nThe tournament produced 16 century breaks. O'Sullivan made six, the most of any player. The highest break was a 138 made by Ding Junhui. No player successfully compiled a maximum break for a chance to pot the new \"Riyadh Season\" gold ball. John Higgins made an attempt in his second-round match against Mark Williams, potting all 15 with , but lost and missed the to end the break at 120. Higgins was defeated in the quarter-finals by eventual winner O'Sullivan 04. Despite the match starting at 1:48am local time, O'Sullivan made breaks of 135, 129, 102, and 82 to complete the whitewash, with Higgins having not potted a single ball in the whole match. In another quarter-final match, Mark Allen recovered from 02 and 13 behind to beat Mark Selby 43, winning the on the last black.\nOverview.\nIn December 2019, World Snooker Tour (WST) announced a 10-year deal with Saudi Arabia, including ranking tournaments that will be hosted in the country. However, no snooker tournaments were held in Saudi Arabia in the next four years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2024, WST announced a new non-ranking tournament called the World Masters of Snooker, scheduled to take place from 4 to 6 March 2024 at the Boulevard Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It was the first professional snooker tournament to be held in Saudi Arabia.\nFormat.\nAll matches were played as the best of seven frames except the final, which was played as the best of nine frames.\nThe matches were played under regular snooker rules, but the event introduced a new gold ball worth 20 points, called the \"Riyadh Season ball\". The gold ball was placed on the centre of the , in line with the , , , and balls. It could only be after a player had completed a maximum break of 147, to extend the break to 167. It would be a four-point foul if the gold ball were potted earlier in the , or hit before the . The gold ball stayed on the table as long as it was possible for either player to complete a maximum break, then it was removed from the table until the next frame.\nParticipants.\nThe event was originally planned to feature ten players, including the top eight players on the snooker world rankings, with the reigning World Champion, Luca Brecel, seeded first, and the rest based on their rankings. It also features two local wildcard players, Ali Alobaidli from Qatar and Omar Alajlani from Saudi Arabia. On 29 February, WST announced that the tournament was expanded to 12 players, with the addition of world number nine and ten, Ding Junhui and John Higgins.\nBroadcasters.\nThe tournament was broadcast locally with Arabic commentary across the Middle East and North Africa by MBC Action, MBC Egypt, Saudi Sport, webook, and Shahid. It was also broadcast by Eurosport and Discovery+ in Europe (including the United Kingdom and Ireland); by Migu and Huya in Mainland China; Now TV in Hong Kong; Astro SuperSport in Malaysia; TrueVisions in Thailand; Sportcast in Taiwan; Premier Sports Network in the Philippines; Sportstars and Vision+ in Indonesia; Skynet in Myanmar; Hang Meas in Cambodia; and DAZN in all other territories.\nPrize money.\nThe event featured a total prize pool of £785,000. An additional prize of $500,000 (about £395,000) would have been given to the first player to compile a 167 break. However, no player was able to do so and the prize was not collected. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nTournament draw.\nNumbers in parentheses after the players' names denote the players' seedings, and players in bold denote match winners. All matches were played as the best of seven frames except the final, which was played as the best of nine frames.\nControversies.\nThe announcement of the event, hailed as a \"huge breakthrough\" by WST chairman, Steve Dawson, was met with criticism accusing Saudi Arabia of sportswashing. Amnesty International criticised snooker's involvement in Saudi Arabia, amid its human rights abuses. Peter Frankental, Amnesty International UK's Economic Affairs director, said: \"It was just a matter of time before Saudi Arabia's huge sportswashing machine sucked in snooker along with almost every other major world sport. If the likes of Ronnie O'Sullivan and Judd Trump play in Riyadh, they shouldn't hesitate to speak out about human rights.\" Some players have also criticised WST of overly focusing on events featuring the top players. Amateur player Steven Hallworth tweeted: \"Was starting to lose sleep with worry that the top eight players might run out of events and cash soon, thank God for this.\"\nThe introduction of the 20-point gold ball was criticised by \"The Independent\" journalist Luke Baker, who called it a \"ludicrous gimmick\" and \"the sign of a desperate sport\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" chief sports writer Oliver Brown described the Saudi invention as \"warping the very rules of the game for its own hubristic ends\", calling it \"frivolous, tasteless, wretched\".\nFormer World Champion Shaun Murphy, however, defended the event and the gold ball, saying: \"the new promoters in Saudi will want their event to stand out and be different. At the end of the day you'd rather have the event than not.\" Murphy added: \"if we (WST) only traded with countries with perfect human rights records, it would be a very, very small pool to pick from... We wouldn't be trading with the UK either.\"\nCentury breaks.\nA total of 16 century breaks were made in the tournament."

        "text": "The 2024 Masters Tournament was the 88th edition of the Masters Tournament and the first of the men's four major golf championships held in 2024. The tournament was played from April 11–14 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, United States. Scottie Scheffler won his second Masters and major, four strokes ahead of runner-up Ludvig Åberg, who was playing in his first major. Scheffler became the fourth-youngest two-time winner of the tournament and the second player, after Tiger Woods in 2001, to win both the Masters and The Players Championship in the same calendar year. \nCourse.\nThe only change to the course for the 2024 tournament was the lengthening of the second hole by ten yards.\nField.\nParticipation in the Masters Tournament is by invitation only, and the tournament has the smallest field of the major championships. There are a number of criteria by which invitations are awarded, including all past winners, recent major champions, leading finishers in the previous year's majors, leading players on the PGA Tour in the previous season, winners of full-point tournaments on the PGA Tour during the previous 12 months, leading players in the Official World Golf Ranking, and some leading amateurs.\nCriteria.\nThere were three changes to invitee criteria between the 2023 and 2024 tournaments. The first was to add the current NCAA Division I Men's Individual Champion a spot in the field, provided that he remains an amateur at the time of the tournament. In addition, Augusta National clarified that players who qualify for the Tour Championship must remain eligible to play in that event in order to qualify for the Masters. Also, with the PGA Tour returning to a calendar-year season schedule, Augusta National noted that winners of fall PGA Tour events would continue to qualify for the Masters.\nThe below list details the qualification criteria for the 2024 Masters Tournament and the players who have qualified under them; any additional criteria under which players qualified are indicated in parentheses.\n1.

Special invitations\nPar-3 contest.\n\"Wednesday, April 10\"\nRickie Fowler won the par-3 contest with a score of 22 (−5). There were five holes-in-one recorded, by Sepp Straka, Luke List, Gary Woodland, Viktor Hovland, and Lucas Glover.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, April 11, 2024\"&lt;br&gt;\"Friday, April 12, 2024\"\nInclement weather delayed the start of the tournament until 10:30 am Eastern time. As a result, 27 players did not complete the first round on Thursday.\nThe 8th hole, a par 5, saw a record-breaking total of 53 par-breaking scores, including 50 birdies and 3 eagles, the highest ever recorded on this hole in Masters history. \nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 12, 2024\"\nBy making the cut, Tiger Woods set the record for most consecutive cuts made at the Masters, at 24. Phil Mickelson made the cut for the 28th time, surpassing Raymond Floyd and Bernhard Langer to move into solo fourth place for most cuts made at the Masters, trailing only Jack Nicklaus (37), Fred Couples (31) and Gary Player (30).\nRookie Ludvig Åberg posted the lowest score of the round, a 69, and advanced to a solo 7th place.\nBryson DeChambeau, before making a birdie on the 13th hole, moved a large directional sign that was in his line of play.\nPatrick Cantlay achieved two eagles on par 4s, marking only the fourth instance in history that a player has recorded two par-4 eagles in a single Masters Tournament, the last being Brandt Jobe in 2006.\nThe cut came at 150 (+6), with 60 players advancing to the weekend. Notables to miss the cut included 2015 champion Jordan Spieth, 2020 champion Dustin Johnson, reigning U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark, Open champion Brian Harman, and World No. 6 Viktor Hovland. Two-time major champion Justin Thomas played his last four holes in seven-over to miss the cut by one shot.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 13, 2024\"\nScottie Scheffler, beginning the round in a three-way tie for the lead, chipped in for birdie on the first hole. After a double bogey on the 10th, Scheffler holed a 31-foot eagle putt on the par-five 13th, the only eagle recorded on that hole during the round. He also birdied the 15th and 18th to finish at seven under following a 71 (−1) to take a one-shot lead into the final round.\nCollin Morikawa birdied his first three holes in a three-under round of 69 and finished at six under, one shot back of Scheffler. Max Homa, tied for the lead at the start of the round, didn't make a birdie in a one-over 73 and fell two back at 5 under. Bryson DeChambeau was also atop the leaderboard to begin the round but hit his third shot in the water on the 15th and made double bogey. He holed out for birdie on the 18th to finish at three under and four shots back of Scheffler. Ludvig Åberg, making his Masters and major championship debut, was four under on his round until a bogey at the 14th. He then left his third shot on the 15th short and three-putted from just off the green for another bogey. He shot 70 (–2) and ended up at four under.\nNicolai Højgaard moved into sole possession of the lead following a run of three straight birdies from holes 8 to 10, but he then made five straight bogeys including hitting into the water on both the 13th and 15th and finished at two under.\nTiger Woods carded a 10-over-par 82 for the third round, his highest score ever in a major championship.\nNo eagles were recorded on the par-5 15th hole through the first three rounds, marking only the second time in the past 50 years that No. 15 has failed to produce an eagle by this point in the tournament. Shane Lowry scored an eagle on the par-4 14th hole, marking the first eagle on this hole since Martin Kaymer in 2016.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 14, 2024\"\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler shot a four-under 68 to win his second Masters title in the last three years by four shots over runner-up Ludvig Åberg.\nScheffler began the round with a one-shot lead and birdied the third hole to go two shots ahead. He then bogeyed the fourth after hitting his tee shot over the green. Max Homa birdied the second, his first birdie in 34 holes, to get within one of the lead, while Åberg hit his approach on the seventh to four feet and made birdie to also get within one of the lead.\nScheffler bogeyed the seventh to create a three-way tie with Åberg and Collin Morikawa at six under, while Homa joined the lead with a two-putt birdie at the par-five eighth. Both Scheffler and Morikawa birdied the eighth to get to seven under, while Åberg holed a 36-foot birdie putt on the ninth to again tie. Scheffler then hit his approach on the ninth to within a foot for another birdie to get to 8 under and again in sole possession of the lead going to the second nine.\nAll three challengers then fell from contention. Morikawa hit his second shot on the ninth into a greenside bunker and couldn't advance on his third, ending up with a double bogey to fall three shots behind. He found the water on his approach at the 11th and made another double bogey. Åberg also hit into the water on the 11th for a double bogey. Homa got back within one with a close approach to the 10th, but his tee shot on the 12th flew over the green into the bushes and he was forced to take a drop. He made a double bogey on the hole to fall three shots behind.\nScheffler birdied the 10th, his third birdie in a row, to get to nine under and open a two-shot lead. Despite a bogey on the 11th, Scheffler two-putted for birdie at the par-five 13th and hit his second shot on the 14th to within four feet for another birdie to reach 10 under. He then made a nine-foot birdie putt on the par-three 16th to get to 11 under. Pars on his final two holes allowed him to close out the tournament with a four-shot victory.\nÅberg birdied the 13th and 14th to get back to seven under and finish four back of Scheffler in his Masters and major championship debut. Morikawa and Homa both finished at four under for the tournament, in a tie for third place along with Tommy Fleetwood.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nSource:"

        "text": "The Eliot Staples Bering Sea Ice Classic is a snow golf tournament held annually on the third Saturday of March on frozen Norton Sound in Nome, Alaska. Founded in 1983, sixteen teams of four players participate. It has a $50 entry cost that contributes to a Lions Club scholarship fund. The course consists of six holes. Par is 42, and the lowest score that has been achieved, as of 2010, is 23. It coincides with the ending of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in the city. It is one of the northernmost golf tournaments in the world.\nHistory.\nThe event was founded in 1983 by Eliot Staples, the namesake of the tournament.\nThe event is affected by the Arctic sea ice decline, as rising sea levels may cover up some parts of the golf course.\nEvent.\nThe course's fairway is of snow-covered ice. The putting green is a small carpet rolled over the uneven ice near each hole.\nThe event starts in mid-morning, behind the city's Breakers Bar. They tee off on Nome's seawall, using bright green or orange golf balls for easier visibility. Balls frequently roll into ice cracks or are lost in snow drifts. As the tournament is the only golfing event in the year, supplies are mostly reused or improvised. Many clubs are very rusty and shot glasses and shotgun shells are used for tees. The holes consist of dug-in coffee cans, less than apart. After the third hole, golfers take a break at the Polar Bar. It is an accepted practice to steal a partner's ball and make a lot of noise while someone is playing.\nIf a player hits a polar bear, they receive a three-stroke penalty. If a player successfully rescues the ball and survives, however, five strokes are subtracted."

        "title": "2022 League of Legends World Championship final",
        "text": "The 2022 \"League of Legends\" World Championship Final was a \"League of Legends\" (\"LoL\") esports series between T1 and DRX on 5 November 2022 at the Chase Center in San Francisco, California, United States. It marked the twelfth final of a \"LoL\" World Championship. Both T1 and DRX were two of four representatives from the League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK) at the tournament, the others being Gen.G and DWG KIA. It was T1's first appearance in the final since the 2017 edition and the first time a play-in team made a tournament run to the final, with DRX starting their tournament from the play-in stage as the LCK's fourth seed, barely qualifying through the regional qualifiers.\nThe series was a best of five and was played in front of 18,000 spectators, with 5.1 million concurrent peak viewers, which was the highest in the tournament's history at the time. The series ended 3–2 in favor of DRX after a back-and-forth five-game series, and was considered the completion of a Cinderella run by commentators, with many regarding it as one of the greatest finals in the history of League of Legends.\nDRX's top laner Hwang \"Kingen\" Seong-hoon earned Most Valuable Player honors. The series marked the first international victory for DRX and support Cho \"BeryL\" Geon-hee's second world championship, making him the only two active players alongside Lee \"Faker\" Sang-hyeok, who also played in the series in his fifth finals appearance, to have more than one world championship after winning the title with DWG KIA in 2020. It also marked the first world championship for ADC Kim \"Deft\" Hyuk-kyu, who was reportedly in his final year of professional play before eventually deciding to continue his playing career, and his second international title after winning the 2015 Mid-Season Invitational with Edward Gaming, whom DRX also faced en route to the finals and were the defending champions heading into Worlds.\nBackground.\n\"League of Legends\" is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed by Riot Games. Each year, Riot hosts a World Championship (Worlds) featuring the most successful teams globally throughout the year-long season. The 2022 Worlds, the twelfth edition of the World Championship, as with its predecessors, was played on the map \"Summoner's Rift\", a play-field featuring three lanes defined by their locationtop, middle, and bottomand two jungle quadrants, mirrored diagonally down a neutral zone known as the river. Summoner's Rift is played by ten players, five per team, through an isometric perspective as players control characters, known as \"champions\", split between five roles respective on their location on the map: top, jungle, middle, attack damage carry, and support. The latter two are both played in the bottom lane. The two teams are referred to as red and blue. The red team spawns in the top right and the blue team spawns in the bottom left.\nIn professional play, players choose their champions during champion select. This consists of four phases: banning phase and picking phase, both of which occur twice. The blue team starts, banning one champion at their discretion. This is then interchanged between the teams until six total champions have been banned, three per team. Blue side then picks their first champion, followed by red side selecting two champions before blue side completes the first phase of picking and banning by also locking in two champions. The teams then begin the second banning phase, starting with red side. The teams interchange until four additional champions have been banned, for a total of ten. Red side also initiates the second picking phase by selecting one champion. Blue side then responds by picking two champions before red side finalises the process by locking in the final champion.\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to destroy the enemy team's Nexus. This is accomplished through leveling up and purchasing items with gold, the in-game currency. In the lanes there are turrets and inhibitors, defensive objectives for the opposing team to destroy (at least one must be destroyed for the Nexus to take damage), as well as a constant stream of minions that can be killed for gold and experience. Similarly, the jungle contains monsters that reward gold and experience upon defeating them. In the river, there are two major neutral objectives. The Rift Herald spawns on the top side of the river and on death, rewards the team with an active item that respawns the Rift Herald, dealing significant damage to the opposing team's defensive structures. At 20 minutes in, the Rift Herald disappears and is replaced by Baron Nashor. Baron Nashor provides the team that kills it with substantial buffs. On the bottom side of the map, dragons spawn. Random elemental dragons that provide small permanent buffs to the acquiring team continue to spawn until 35 minutes in, at which point the Elder Dragon will spawn that upon being slain, provides the team with a powerful temporary buff. Gold and experience points are also obtained through killing these neutral monsters.\nRoute to the final.\nT1.\nHeading into the 2022 Worlds Final, T1 was in the midst of an international title drought since their last major international championship, that being the 2017 Mid-Season Invitational. The team's last Worlds title came during the 2016 edition, which was coincidentally the last Worlds to be held in North America, when T1, then known as SK Telecom T1, won their third world championship after beating Samsung Galaxy, 3–2. A year later, they failed to defend their title as they were defeated by the same team in a 3–0 sweep. Since then, the team won the 2019 League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK) Spring and Summer Splits, as well as the 2020 Spring Split. However, T1 failed to make it to the finals of the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational, the 2019 and 2021 League of Legends World Championship, as well as not qualifying for the 2018 and 2020 editions of Worlds. In November 2020, T1 signed Ryu \"Keria\" Min-seok as their new support for the 2021 season, transferring from DRX. Around the same time, toplaner Choi \"Zeus\" Woo-je and jungler Mun \"Oner\" Hyeon-jun were called up from the T1 Academy to the main roster. ADC Lee \"Gumayusi\" Min-hyeong had been called up in November 2019. In early December 2021, T1 announced their roster for the 2022 LCK season.\nT1 was one of the most dominant teams throughout 2022, both domestically and internationally. In the LCK, they would go on a perfect 18–0 record in the 2022 Spring Split, qualifying outright to the semifinals. This was an achievement no other LCK team has accomplished until that point. In the playoffs, T1 would complete the sweep against Kwangdong Freecs in the semifinals before beating Gen.G in the finals with a scoreline of 3–1 to win the Spring Split. T1's victory qualified them for the 2022 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI), which would be hosted by South Korea. In that tournament, T1 would finish the group stage with another perfect record of 6–0, qualifying them for the tournament's rumble stage. In the rumble stage, T1 had a mixed start, going 2–2 in their first four games before winning five of their last six games to finish the rumble stage as the second seed with a 7–3 win-loss slate. In the semifinals, T1 beat G2 Esports with a 3–0 sweep to qualify for their first MSI Final since the 2017 edition of the event. However, they would suffer a 2–3 defeat to League of Legends Pro League (LPL) representative Royal Never Give Up in the finals. In the Summer Split, T1 would finish as the second seed with a 15–3 win-loss record, qualifying them outright for the semifinals where they would beat DWG KIA with a 3–2 series win. However, the team would suffered a 3–0 sweep in the finals against Gen.G. Despite the loss, T1 garnered the most championship points, giving them an outright qualification to the 2022 World Championship. This would mark T1's eighth Worlds appearance and their third as T1.\nIn the group stage, T1 was seeded into Group A alongside defending champions Edward Gaming, Fnatic, and Cloud9. After their win over EDG in their first game of the tournament, they suffered a loss to Fnatic in their next game. However, T1 finished the group stage on a four-game winning streak, topping the group with a 5–1 win-loss record. Having advanced from groups into the knockout stage, T1 avenged their MSI 2022 finals loss against Royal Never Give Up in the quarterfinals, 3–2, before beating JD Gaming with a 3–1 series win to advance to their fifth \"League of Legends\" World Championship Final.\nDRX.\nPrior to the 2020s, DRX had won two League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK) titles — 2017 Summer as \"Longzhu Gaming\" and 2018 Spring as \"Kingzone DragonX\", a runner-up finish at the 2018 Mid-Season Invitational and a quarterfinal appearance at the 2017 League of Legends World Championship. However, with the turn of a new decade, also came struggles for the team, both domestically and internationally. Despite another runner-up finish at the 2020 Summer Split, DRX failed to make it past the quarterfinals in three splits from 2021 to 2022. Moreover, the team suffered a 2–16 record in the 2021 Summer Split, a far cry from their Spring Split performance in the same year where they finished with a 9–9 win-loss slate. After the 2021 season, the team saw a major roster change, as Cho \"BeryL\" Geon-hee, previously of DWG KIA and was coming off two consecutive Worlds finals appearances, joined as their new support. Veteran ADC Kim \"Deft\" Hyuk-kyu would return for his second stint with the team, transferring from Hanwha Life Esports, and Kim \"Zeka\" Geon-woo joined as the team new midlaner, transferring from the LPL's Bilibili Gaming. All three players would join toplaner Hwang \"Kingen\" Seong-hoon and jungler Hong \"Pyosik\" Chang-hyeon for the 2022 LCK season, the latter of which was the longest-tenured player in the team at the time.\nThe newly revamped roster would have a slow start to the 2022 Spring Split, losing their first three games before nailing their first victory of the split against Kwangdong Freecs. However, despite eventually finishing fourth with an 11–7 win-loss record, DRX would lose to the same team in the quarterfinals, 2–3. After the Spring Split and the 2022 Mid-Season Invitational, the Summer Split commenced. Here, DRX would finish the first two weeks with an undefeated record, eventually finishing with a 9–9 win-loss slate. The team would once again reach the quarterfinals as the 6th seed, but they suffered a 1–3 defeat to Liiv Sandbox. After the domestic season, DRX still had a chance to make it to the 2022 World Championship through the LCK Regional Finals, which determined the third and fourth seeds from the LCK to qualify for Worlds. The team was placed in the lower-bracket semifinal against KT Rolster and won with a result of 3–2, before beating Liiv Sandbox in the lower-bracket final with a similar scoreline to notch the last LCK spot in the tournament. This would mark the team's third Worlds appearance and their second as DRX, having qualified for the 2017 edition as \"Longzhu Gaming.\"\nDRX was seeded into Group B in the play-in stage alongside 2022 MSI champions Royal Never Give Up, MAD Lions, Saigon Buffalo, Isurus, and Istanbul Wildcats. With dominant performances from players such as Zeka, DRX finished first in their group, qualifying them for the group stage with an undefeated 5–0 record. The team was then placed in Group B of the group stage, alongside Top Esports, Rogue, and GAM Esports. Despite a loss to Rogue in their opening match, the team went on a four-game winning streak before losing to TES in their final game, setting up a tiebreaker match between Rogue and DRX, with the latter winning to secure the top spot in the group, qualifying for the quarterfinals. Having progressed into the knockout stage, DRX pulled off a reverse sweep against then-defending champions Edward Gaming in the quarterfinals, before beating fellow LCK team Gen.G in the semifinals with a 3–1 series win to reach the 2022 \"League of Legends\" World Championship Final, setting up an all-LCK final against T1.\nBackground and pre-series.\nT1 and DRX were alongside Gen.G and DWG KIA in representing the LCK. This series marked the first time Faker and Deft had faced each other in the Worlds Finals, as both players attended the same school during their high school years in , with Faker making his fifth appearance and Deft making his first. Moreover, this series was also DRX's first appearance in the finals, despite them having made two quarterfinal appearances in past World Championships. The Finals were a best-of-five series, with the first team to win a total of three games being crowned the champions.\nThe series was held on 5 November 2022 at the Chase Center in San Francisco, California, United States. In November 2021, Riot Games announced the venue as the host of the finals before a Golden State Warriors home game against the Toronto Raptors. The event was livestreamed via Twitch.tv and YouTube, as well as through the official LoL Esports website. Prior to the commencement of the games, Riot held an opening ceremony featuring performances from musical artists that had collaborated with League of Legends throughout the year. This began at 17:00 local time (). The ceremony began with Edda Hayes performing \"The Call,\" as the T1 and DRX players were initially presented to the crowd. The song was released in conjunction with the start of the game's twelfth season. This was immediately followed by Jackson Wang, performing \"Fire to the Fuse,\" a collaborative track between 88rising and League of Legends. Finally, the 2022 World Championship promotion song \"Star Walkin\" was performed by Lil Nas X, with the T1 and DRX players being presented once more to the crowd along with the Summoner's Cup at the center of the stage as the opening ceremony concluded. Throughout the ceremony, holographic projections were cast onto several portions of the stage.\nThe English streams were cast by Clayton \"CaptainFlowers\" Raines, Marc \"Caedrel\" Lamont, and Sam \"Kobe\" Hartman-Kenzler. The Korean streams were cast by Chun \"Caster Jun\" Yong-jun, Lee \"CloudTemplar\" Hyun-woo, Kang \"KangQui\" Seung-hyeon, and Jo \"CoreJJ\" Yong-in.\nTeam line-ups.\nNeither team made any line-up changes going into the finals. T1's coaches were Bae \"Bengi\" Seong-woong and Kim \"moment\" Ji-hwan, while DRX's coaches were Kim \"Ssong\" Sang-soo and Lee \"Mowgli\" Jae-ha.\nSeries.\nGame 1.\nThe champion selection phase for the first game commenced shortly after the conclusion of the opening ceremony. T1 were on blue side which gave them the opportunity to ban and pick the first champions of the game. In the first banning phase, T1 opted to ban Akali, Sejuani, and Ashe, while DRX banned Yuumi; a champion that had a perfect win rate throughout the tournament; Lucian; and Caitlyn. Following the first ban phase, T1 first picked Varus, for Gumayusi who had won every game he's played when picking the said champion leading up to the finals. DRX responded by picking Aatrox; for Kingen; and Viego; for Pyosik. For the remaining picks of the first pick phase, T1 chose Yone for Zeus; a pick meant to counter the Aatrox selection; and Renata Glasc for Keria, and DRX chose Sylas for Zeka as their final pick. Before the second pick phase, DRX banned Ryze and Graves, and T1 banned Rell and Ezreal. As DRX were on red side, they got the first pick of the second pick phase, selecting Heimerdinger for BeryL. For their last two draft selections, T1 selected Lee Sin; for Oner; and Azir; for Faker, the latter of which as a counter to DRX's selections in top and jungle and was Faker's best champion in the tournament heading into the finals. DRX's last pick was Sivir for Deft.\nGame 1 ended in 31:10 minutes, with a final kill scoreline of 15–5, in favour of T1.\nGame 2.\nFor the first banning phase of the second game, DRX chose to ban Lucian for the second time, Ryze, and Renata Glasc; while T1 opted to ban Yuumi, Caitlyn for the second straight game, and Sejuani, also for the second straight matchup. As DRX were on blue side for the first time in the match, they got the first pick of the first picking phase, locking in Varus for Deft. T1 responded by picking Ashe for Gumayusi; a champion that was banned by T1 in the first game; and Aatrox for Zeus. For their last two picks before the second banning phase, DRX chose Heimerdinger for BeryL for the second-straight game, and Camille for Kingen. T1 concluded the first picking phase by selecting Lux for Keria. DRX then banned Nocturne and Azir, who was played by Faker in the first game; getting the highest K/D/A of 6/1/4; and T1 banned Akali and Kindred, the latter being the champion Pyosik has a perfect win rate at this point in the tournament until DRX's defeat in Game 1. T1, now on red side; chose Graves for Oner; and DRX selected Viego for Pyosik; another champion whom he had a perfect record with in the tournament leading up to the finals; and Sylas for Zeka. T1's final pick of the draft was Viktor for Faker.\nGame 2 was the longest game of the series, ending after 46:11 minutes, with a close final kill scoreline of 17–13, in favour of DRX.\nGame 3.\nThe first banning phase of Game 3 was similar to that of the first game, with T1 opting to ban Akali, Sejuani, and Ashe; while DRX banned Yuumi, Lucian, and Caitlyn, who remains banned at this point in the series for the third consecutive time. Now at blue side once again, T1 selected Varus for Gumayusi for the second time in the match. DRX countered with two bottom lane picks; Kalista for Deft and Renata Glasc for BeryL, the first time both champions were paired in the series. For their final two selections before the second banning phase, T1 locked in Azir for Faker; a champion critical in their team's Game 1 victory; and Karma for Keria. For the third consecutive game, Sylas was picked by DRX for Zeka. T1 then banned Aatrox; a champion Kingen had a 3–1 record in the tournament until their Game 1 loss; and Kindred; whom Pyosik has a perfect win rate on. Meanwhile, DRX opted to ban Yone and Lee Sin. Beginning the second picking phase, DRX selected Viego; for Pyosik; to which T1 would respond by selecting Graves; for Oner; considered a counter to DRX's low-range composition; and Gragas; for Zeus. DRX then locked in Ornn; for Kingen; matching the Gragas as top-lane tanks.\nGame 3 ended in 32:11 minutes, with a tied final kill scoreline of 12-12.\nGame 4.\nT1 were at match point and a win would seal their fourth World championship. Returning to blue side, DRX again had the opportunity to ban and pick the first champions of the game. In the first banning phase, DRX banned Lucian, Ashe, and Ryze; a champion Faker has used in two victories in T1's semifinal win over JD Gaming with a KDA of 3.0. For T1, they opted to ban Caitlyn; for the fourth consecutive game; Yuumi, and Heimerdinger. DRX began the first picking phase, selecting Varus for Deft; a champion that has not lost a game and has been a crucial selection for both teams at this point in the series. T1 responded by locking in Kalista for Gumayusi; and Sejuani for Oner; meant to deny Pyosik a champion that pairs well with other champions such as Aatrox and Akali. For their final pick before the second banning phase, DRX selected Renata Glasc for BeryL; as a response to the Kalista pick; and Azir for Zeka. For their final selection before the second banning phase, T1 picked Soraka for Keria, which casters described as a \"utility\" pick. Before the second pick phase, DRX banned Viktor and Yone; limiting Faker to a melee champion and denying Zeus a counter to Aatrox; while T1 banned Kindred and Viego; the latter of which Pyosik has used in all three games. T1 then selected Akali for Faker, to which DRX responded by picking Aatrox for Kingen; and Maokai for Pyosik; meant to counter T1's picks in both middle and bottom lanes. Fiora was T1's final selection; for Zeus.\nGame 4 was the shortest game of the series, ending at only 28:44 minutes, with a tied final kill scoreline of 14–4, in favour of DRX.\nGame 5.\nHeading into Game 5, no team has won a game from red side. As they were on the said side in Game 4, T1 was on blue side whilst DRX was in red. The first banning phase saw T1 opting to ban Akali, Heimerdinger, and Renata Glasc, while DRX banned Yuumi, Lucian, and Lux in a surprising move. It was the first time in the series that Caitlyn was not banned by either team. In the first picking phase, T1 selected Karma for Keria. DRX responded by locking in Azir for Zeka; Faker's best champion; and Caitlyn for Deft, a champion he has a perfect win rate on and as a response to the Karma selection; leading the casters to speculate an impending surprise support pick for DRX. For their next two picks, T1 selected Varus for Gumayusi and Viktor for Faker. Concluding the first picking phase was DRX picking Aatrox for Kingen, a champion he has used twice at this point in the series. For their final two bans, DRX banned Yone and Lee Sin, while T1 banned Sejuani and Kindred; the latter of which was described as a \"pocket pick\" for Pyosik. For the second picking phase, DRX locked in Bard for BeryL in a surprising selection; as a counter to the immobility of T1's selections in both middle and bottom lanes. In their final two picks, T1 chose Viego for Oner and Gwen for Zeus; and DRX locked in Hecarim for Pyosik to round out the draft. The final two selections were met by loud cheers from the audience at the Chase Center.\nGame 5 was the second game of the series to reach 40+ minutes, ending at 42:09 minutes, with a final kill scoreline of 19–10, in favour of DRX, who would win their first world championship title.\nPost-series.\nThe tournament had a base prize pool of US$2.225 million. Of this, the winners, DRX, received 22% ($489,500) of the pool. For coming second, T1 was rewarded 15% ($333,750). As with previous world champions, DRX worked directly with Riot's visual department to release skins for their chosen champions, with one per player. The skins imitate the team's design, hence DRX's skins were mostly colored in blue and showed its logo on recall animations, as well as signatures from each player. The chosen champions were Aatrox, picked by Kingen; Kindred, picked by Pyosik; Malphite, Akali by Zeka; Caitlyn, picked by Deft; Ashe, picked by BeryL; and Maokai, picked by Lee \"Juhan\" Ju-han, the team's substitute jungler who made two appearances for the team during the play-in stage, meeting Riot Games' criteria. He also made an appearance in DRX's first group stage match against Rogue. For the first time, a prestige skin was also released with Kingen's Aatrox, commemorating his Finals MVP award during the tournament.\nIn the build-up to the 2023 \"League of Legends\" World Championship, which South Korea hosted, Riot Games released the tournament's promotional song, \"Gods\" (stylized in caps), which was performed by South Korean girl group NewJeans. The song's music video featured Deft as the main protagonist, showcasing his past World Championship stints up until the 2022 edition, famously showing him facing his former teammates on his road to the world championship (Tian \"Meiko\" Ye in EDG, Choi \"Doran\" Hyeon-joon in Gen.G, and Ryu \"Keria\" Min-seok in T1).\nIn the following season, DRX would fail to qualify for the 2023 edition of Worlds after losing to Dplus KIA (formerly known as DWG KIA) in the 2023 LCK Regional Finals. Weeks after the 2022 Worlds Final, DRX announced that the contracts of Kingen, Pyosik, Zeka, Deft, and BeryL had expired. Deft would stay in the LCK, joining Dplus KIA for the 2023 season, as well as Kingen and Zeka, both joining Hanwha Life Esports. Pyosik moved to the League Championship Series in North America, joining Team Liquid. BeryL was the only player to resign with DRX for the following season, while Juhan also stayed with the team. However, heading into the 2024 LCK season, three former members of the DRX squad teamed up once again as Deft, Pyosik, and BeryL all signed with KT Rolster.\nT1 kept the same roster for the 2023 LCK season, finishing as runners-up in both Spring and Summer Splits and making the semifinals of the 2023 Mid-Season Invitational in London. Despite not winning a domestic title, the team would have the most championship points, securing qualification for the 2023 edition of Worlds. T1 would finish their group Swiss stage campaign with a 3–1 record, losing only to the LCK's first seed, Gen.G in the 1-0 bracket. Having qualified for the knockout stage, T1 went through teams from China's \"League of Legends\" Pro League (LPL), sweeping LNG Esports 3–0 in the quarterfinals, defeating 2023 MSI champions JD Gaming in the semifinals, 3–1, in a rematch from the last tournament, and scoring another sweep against Weibo Gaming in the finals, 3–0, to win their record-extending fourth world championship in their sixth finals appearance. Top-laner Choi \"Zeus\" Woo-je would earn Finals MVP honors in the tournament. T1 was also famously the only team from the LCK to qualify for the semifinals, as fellow quarterfinalists Gen.G and KT Rolster failed to advance, losing to Bilibili Gaming and JD Gaming, respectively."

        "title": "North Island rugby league team",
        "text": "The North Island rugby league team is a rugby league team that represents the North Island of New Zealand. They first played in 1920 against the touring England team in Napier, Hawke's Bay. However the primary purpose of the side was to play against the South Island team, with the match often serving as a trial type match to chose the New Zealand international side.\nInter island matches.\n1920.\nThe England team was touring New Zealand following their tour of Australia where they had played 13 matches. They played Auckland, Rotorua, South Auckland (Waikato), New Zealand, and King Country, before a match was organised for them against a North Island team at Napier in the Hawke's Bay on August 4. The North Island team was relatively weak with only 8 of the 13 players chosen being New Zealand representatives when ordinarily the entire side would have been national representatives. The side included 5 local Hawke's Bay players (Pat Burrows, Edmund Downing, Percival Exeter, Con McCarthy, and Henry Pring). Aside from a loss to Auckland in their first game the England side made short work of all domestic opposition, including this North Island side who they thrashed 46-5.\n1925.\n1925 saw the first ever 'proper' North Island rugby league team match in what was to become a near annual fixture over the ensuing decades. The match was played in \"unfavourable conditions\" at Carlaw Park before 4,000 spectators, making \"good football out of the question\". The match was largely a battle of the forwards though North Island backs Lou Brown, Ben Davidson, and Horace Dixon all crossed for tries. Forward Ernie Herring had an outstanding game scoring a hat trick. Frank Delgrosso struggled with his goal kicking in the conditions, converting just one of their 7 tries. Neil Mouat scored all of the South Island's points with a try and 3 penalties. At halftime Neville St George came on for the North Island after Alf Townsend retired with a broken rib.\n1926.\n The entire North Island team was composed of Auckland players with the exception of Wally Desmond from Wellington. Unlike the previous season which saw just 4,000 attend the match the crowd for the 1926 edition was an enormous 18,000 with the match described as \"brilliant\". The South Island backs were said to be \"Herculean\", \"fighting like tigers\". The northern backs were far to clever though and they put on several tries with the margin likely to have been larger if not for Peckham and Cole leaving the field through injury in the second half leaving them 2 players short.\n1929.\nLen Scott was injured during the match and replaced by Allan Seagar for the North Island while for the South Island Sanders was injured and replaced by Doogan. In past years the North Island team was dominated by players from the Auckland competition however the North Island team on this occasion featured players from outside Auckland such as Ted Meyer, Dick Trautvettor, Bob Stephenson, Joe Menzies, Tom Timms, and Tassie Bergan.\n1930.\nFor the North Island v South Island trial the Devonport and Ponsonby clubs gave permission for their jerseys to be worn by the respective sides. Mick O’Brien of the South Island team broke his tibia late in the match.\n1931.\n The North Island had one of their largest ever wins over the South Island. Pat Meehan of the Marist club scored 4 tries, with New Zealand internationals Claude List (3), Edwin Abbott (2), Hec Brisbane (2), and Alan Clarke also scoring. Clarke also kicked 5 conversions and a penalty for 15 individual points. For the South Island Falgar scored 2 tries, with Johnny Dodds scoring a try and kicking their lone conversion.\n1932.\nJim Amos left the field with an injured shoulder for the South Island team and was replaced by E O'Brien. Bert Cooke made his North Island debut and played brilliantly, scoring three tries for the winners in front of a crowd of 15,000. He had only recently converted to rugby league but his performance was instrumental in his selection for the New Zealand test team. Len Scott also scored three tries with Claude List crossing for one. Albert Laing converted three of the North Island's seven tries. Laing also made his debut for New Zealand after his effort, while Scott and List also gained New Zealand selection once more after having debuted for New Zealand in 1928. For the South Island J. Devonport and E. Hamberger scored a try each. Jim Amos had kicked two goals before being replaced. Jonas Masters kicked their other three goals.\n1934.\n The match was described as \"by far the most brilliant North-South match seen in Auckland for many years\". The South Island led 13-3 at the half time break before a magnificent rally by the North Island saw them overcome the deficit and draw level following tries to George Tittleton and Bert Cooke, both of which were converted by R.E. Smith from the Hawke's Bay. The North side extended their lead through tries to Cliff Satherley, Wally Tittleton, Cooke, and then Lou Hutt before the South Island scored a consolation try to Billy Glynn.\n1935.\nThis was the 10th inter-island match stretching back to 1925. The North Island had won 7, the South Island had won 1 in 1929, with a draw in 1930. Roy Bright, Wilf Hassan and McNeil (Richmond) were selected to play for the North Island but were unavailable. The North Island had 3 players debuting, Bill Telford, Ted Mincham, and W. Large (Hawke's Bay).\n1936.\nDuring the match Reg Haslam was running with the ball when he began falling into a hole which had fallen into the ground. In the meantime he had passed the ball and play moved away but was forced to stop once the referee realised what had happened. It had formed near a drain where the water had washed away the soil beneath the ground. A ball boy was photographed standing in the hole ‘buried’ to his waist. The gate receipts for the match were £608 19/ with 15,000 in attendance at the match and the trial curtain-raiser.\n1938.\nBrian Riley was initially named to play for the North Island side but as he was unable to get leave from work to potentially tour Australia if selected he was replaced in the North Island side. The result showed the absolute domination of the Auckland competition over other parts of New Zealand with 12 of the 13 players drawn from the Auckland club competition. Joe Cootes was the only player from outside Auckland, playing in Wellington. For the North Island Des Herring scored 3 tries, and Rangi Chase 2, with 7 other players (Gordon Midgley, Walter Brimble, Jack Satherley, Joe Cootes, Angus Gault, Jack Brodrick, and Clarry McNeil) also crossing the line. Jack Smith kicked 10 conversions and also kicked a penalty. The only scorer for the South Island was P. Scott who kicked a penalty.\n1939.\nWally Tittleton was chosen as the North Island captain while Rex King captained the South Island.\n1944.\nThis was the first time since 1939 that the North Island v South Island match had been played. The North Island won comfortably scoring 9 tries to 3. Roy Nurse was the only North Island player who had previously played for them with the other 12 on debut. Ralph Martin had played for Manukau from 1940 to 1944 had moved to Wellington during the year for his army training and had joined the Korodale club and also represented Wellington following that point. Hawea Mataira had originally been selected but was travelling to Wellington with the Auckland Waterside Workers team to play in their annual fixture with Wellington Waterside and was replaced by Ririnui but then on match day he himself was replaced in the side by Wellington's F. Andrews who was in his first year of rugby league. Owen Brooks from the Waikato had a remarkable day scoring 3 tries and kicking 8 conversions for a personal tally of 25 tries. Joe Murray from the Manukau club also scored 3 tries. Pouvi (Robert) Salaia, one of the first Pacific born players involved in New Zealand rugby league, scored for the North Island. For the South Island New Zealand international John Newton scored twice and Ces Davison converted all three of their tries.\n1945.\n The South Island team featured 2 Wellington players (F Moses and Hector Mallinder) for the first time in its history, rendering it a South Island team in name only. G Moyes, chosen at lock from Waikato was unavailable as he was feeling unwell so his place was taken by Fred James of the City side and he played well scoring 2 tries. Veteran Arthur Kay played for the North Island in the centre position. He was in his 13th season of senior rugby league having debuted for Ponsonby in 1933. The crowd was estimated at between 15 and 20,000 which was the largest seen at the ground for many years.\nRepresentation by province (1920-1945).\nJim Laird is the only player to represent the North Island for more than one province (Waikato in 1932, and Auckland in 1935)."

It will be their first season as members of the Big 12 Conference.\nPrevious season.\nThe Wildcats finished the 2023–24 season 27–9, 15–5 in Pac-12 Conference play, winning their 18th and final Pac-12 regular season title and overall 1 seed in the Pac-12 tournament. They lost their semifinal match up against eventual tournament champion Oregon 68–75.

They lost in the Sweet Sixteen to number 6 seed Clemson 72–77.\nOffseason.\nCoaching staff changes.\nAs of April 2024, the Wildcats had no coaching staff changes.\nDepartures.\nDue to COVID-19, the NCAA ruled in October 2020 that the 2020–21 season would not count against the eligibility of any basketball player, thus giving all players the option to return in 2022–23. Additionally, any players who have declared for the 2024 NBA draft—including seniors, who must opt into this year's draft—have the option to return if they make a timely withdrawal from the draft and end any pre-draft relationships with agents.

Established in 1884, it was the first sporting club for women in Singapore.\nHistory.\nThe club was established in 1884 by solicitor Alexander Leathes Donaldson of the law firm Donaldson &amp; Burkinshaw. In May, the government permitted the club to occupy Dhoby Green, which was located at the corner of Bencoolen Street and Orchard Road, after which a pavilion was constructed, painted and furnished on the grounds for $632. The club was endorsed as the Ladies Tennis Club in July and was led by a committee comprising five women and two men. The club's rules were drawn up and passed during a meeting at the Town Hall on 29 September. By then, the club had 69 subscribers, with seven courts at Dhoby Green. The club was rather exclusive and admittance was hard to come by. The clubhouse was located on Penang Lane. Men were allowed in the club but only as subscribers; only women could obtain membership. Then colonial secretary of the Straits Settlements Cecil Clementi Smith and his aunt were invited to become an honorary member and the lady patroness respectively. The first competitive match held at Dhoby Green took place on 1 December.\nIn 1905, a new clubhouse was built at Dhoby Green. By then, the club had expanded to include 12 tennis courts and two croquet courts, as well as a $5,000 pavillion, and had over 270 members. However, by the 1920s, many other clubs had begun offering tennis, and the club's membership began dwindling. The club closed in July 1932, and Dhoby Green was taken over by the YMCA on 1 August."

        "text": "The 2024 CONCACAF Nations League final was a soccer match to determine the winner of the 2023–24 CONCACAF Nations League. The match was the third final of the CONCACAF Nations League, an international tournament contested by the men's national teams representing the member associations of CONCACAF, which covers North America, Central America, and the Caribbean.\nThe United States defeated Mexico 2–0 to claim the title for the third straight time.\nVenue.\nThe match was played at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, United States.\nRoute to final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away; N: neutral site).\"\nUnited States.\nThe United States were the defending champions of the Nations League after winning it back-to-back in 2021 and 2023 to Mexico and Canada respectively.\nThe Americans opened their defense of the Nations League title having to secure a two-legged quarter-final win against Trinidad &amp; Tobago to advance to both the CONCACAF Nations League Finals and to qualify to the 2024 Copa América, which was hosted on home soil. The first leg was played on 16 November 2023 in the Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas. The match ended up in a 3-0 victory for the United States with late goals from Ricardo Pepi, Antonee Robinson and Giovanni Reyna, which gained them a three-goal-lead before playing the second leg. Four days later, on the Hasely Crawford Stadium, Port Spain, the Americans got shocked by the Soca Warriors, which defeated them 2-1 in a match which was initially won by the visitors after an Antonee Robinson goal in the 25th minute which gave them a lead that was later reverted with two goals from Reon Moore and Alvin Jones in the 43th and 57th minute respectively. Nevertheless, the aggregate was 4-2 in favour of the Americans, which gave them the pass to both the CONCACAF Nations League Finals and the Copa América, whilst Trinidad and Tobago had to gain his pass to the latter tournament against Canada.\nThe United States earned a 3–1 victory against Jamaica in the semifinal played in AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, in a match they were initially losing by a Greg Leigh header that struck into Matt Turner's left top corner after just 33 seconds. The Americans could only get an equalizer 95 minutes after, when a corner kick was headed by Miles Robinson but deflected on Cory Burke into Andre Blake's goal, which led the game into extra time, in which Reyna, who was subbed on at half-time, assisted Haji Wright, who was subbed on in the 63rd minute, two times in the 96th and 109th minute to put the United States into its third consecutive Nations League final.\nMexico.\nThis was Mexico's second Nations League final, having lost the 2021 edition against the United States 3-2. In the 2023 edition, Mexico were eliminated in the semi-finals by the United States 3-0, though Mexico went on to win 3rd place after defeating Panama 1-0.\nEl Tri's 2024 campaign started against Honduras in the quarter-finals. That first leg was played in the Estadio Nacional Chelato Uclés, in Tegucigalpa, in which Honduras shocked Mexico, defeating them 2-0 with goals from Anthony Lozano and Bryan Róchez, which required Mexico to avenge the result at home or else fail to qualify for both the 2024 Nations League Finals and the 2024 Copa América. Four days later, the second quarter-final leg took place in the Estadio Azteca, Ciudad de México. Mexico dominated the match from the beginning, but couldn't score until Luis Chávez converted a free kick in the 43rd minute, followed by a crucial late equalizer in the aggregate in the 10th minute of stoppage time in the second half by Edson Álvarez. That led the game into extra time and eventually penalties, in which Mexico prevailed by 4-2, assuring its qualification to the semi-finals.\nMexico defeated Panama 3-0 in the semifinal played in the AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, with the latter controlling the majority of the game and having more possession than El Tri, but failing to capitalize on its chances and eventually conceding three times with Edson Álvarez, Julián Quiñones and Orbelín Pineda scoring to guide Mexico into the second Nations League final in its history.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nMexico arrived to the final missing Julián Araujo which suffered an injury in the previous match against Panama and was thus replaced by Jorge Sánchez, which was the only change in the starting lineup on the final in relation to the one from the semi-final match. As with the starting lineup from the past match, Jaime Lozano was widely criticized for choosing América's Henry Martín instead of young Feyenoord top scorer Santiago Giménez. The United States recovered Sergiño Dest, who was suspended due to a double yellow received during the second leg of the quarter-final match against Trinidad &amp; Tobago on 20 November 2023. Tyler Adams was announced to be in the starting XI which marked his return to the USMNT after being ruled out due to a year-long hamstring injury. Tim Ream returned to the starting XI after being replaced by Miles Robinson in the match against Jamaica and, after their performance against the latter, Giovanni Reyna and Haji Wright replaced both Malik Tillman and Folarin Balogun.\nThe match started with United States controlling the ball and the majority of the possession, which nearly materialized in the 5th minute when Christian Pulisic controlled the ball in the penalty area and could get past César Montes and Johan Vázquez to end up making a close-range shot which was saved by Guillermo Ochoa. Mexico's most prominent attack came in the 22th minute when Jesús Gallardo attempted a throw-in into the United States penalty area that, after a header, landed in Luis Chávez's feet and made a weak shot at the right of Matt Turner which was controlled. In the 38th minute, Sergiño Dest attempted a solo run in which he dribbled Luis Chávez and Érick Sánchez and attempted a long-range shot which past upon the crossbar. Right before half-time, in the 45th minute, Tyler Adams attempted a long range shot which struck right into Ochoa's right top corner to make it 1-0 for the United States, and entered half time leading the score. \nGregg Berhalter made a substitution at half, subbing off Adams and bringing onto the field Johnny Cardoso. The match continued to be a United States monologue, which frustrated Mexican players which had to draw upon several fouls to gain possession back, this resulted in Johan Vázquez, Edson Álvarez and Uriel Antuna gaining a yellow card in an 8-minute span between the 55th and the 63rd minute. Mexico's second attack in the whole match came in the 61st minute, when a long ball from Ochoa landed in the three-quarter line and was headed by Hirving Lozano to Henry Martín which controlled the ball to the edge of the goal area and shot it wide. The second goal from the United States came two minutes after, when Christian Pulisic dribbled his way into the penalty area and his cross was rejected by Vázquez only for Giovanni Reyna to intercept the ball and struck it from the edge of the penalty and putting it in Ochoa's right bottom corner. Immediately after the 2-0, Jaime Lozano brought onto the field Santiago Giménez and Orbelín Pineda for Uriel Antuna and Érick Sánchez respectively, whilst Berhalter replaced Haji Wright with Folarin Balogun. In the 71st minute, Giménez fell in the area at the same time Antonee Robinson cleared the ball near his chest, which gained Mexico a penalty that was later revised by the VAR and issued Giménez a yellow card for simulating the foul. The rest of the match the United States handed possession for a while, which gave Mexico the opportunity of making a few shots on goal that went wide. In the 88th minute, another close range shot was saved by Ochoa, this time from Johnny. After having to stop the match several times due to homophobic chants, the match was ended in the 99th minute, after only adding up 6 minutes. Giovanni Reyna was awarded the man of the match.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;"

        "title": "Papatoetoe Rugby League Football Club",
        "text": "The Papatoetoe Rugby League Football Club was a rugby league club in Auckland, New Zealand which existed for 4 years from 1929 to 1932. They competed in the Auckland Rugby League lower grade competitions. They were made up of players from the suburb of Papatoetoe in South Auckland. At the time of their existence the area was rural, while today due to urban sprawl it has become a populated suburb of Auckland.\nHistory.\nPapatoetoe Schoolboys.\nSchoolboys (1926).\nThe first mention of a rugby league team in Papatoetoe was in fact 3 years before their clubs formation and was a schoolboy team formed from schools in the area. It was the first ever year that schoolboy rugby league had been played in Auckland with games only beginning towards the end of the year in September. Papatoetoe schoolboys played a drawn game with Otahuhu on October 16, 1926, at Carlaw Park. The match was a curtain raiser to the Roope Rooster final between Richmond Rovers and Devonport United (North Shore Albions). Their two tries were scored by Manning and Pinfold. It was stated that as well as including players from the Papatoetoe Primary School they also \"included a number of the Papatoetoe Orphanage boys\". The two school matches had been refereed by G. McCowatt, and Bill Mincham who had played for Auckland in 1915. His son Ted Mincham later played for New Zealand. The Auckland Star said that they 4 schoolboy teams that had played the curtain raisers \"gave a good exhibition of football, making the play open, and throwing the ball about at every opportunity. It is intended next season to have a schoolboys' competition. Already a set of caps for the winners and a valuable cup have been offered for competition\". Their only other match for the year was a 16–8 defeat to a Richmond West schoolboy side in the rugby league strong hold of Grey Lynn.\nSchoolboys (1927).\nThe Papatoetoe schoolboys team of 1927 played in a much more organised competition with 10 games played. They won 4 and lost 6, scoring 40 and conceding 138. Their first win was against Otahuhu on May 28 when they won 6–0. On June 4 the Papatoetoe schoolboys played Richmond at Carlaw Park as one of the curtain raisers to the senior mens game. The Papatoetoe side also played a game against Otahuhu a day earlier at Carlaw Park as a curtain raiser to the Devonport v Richmond senior mens game on Kings Birthday.\nSchoolboys (1928).\nIn 1928 the Papatoetoe schoolboys team finished mid table. They beat Māngere Schoolboys 8–0 on June 30, and Ellerslie 14-0 a week later on July 14, but their other reported results were a 0–30 loss to Newmarket and a 0–22 loss to Richmond Schoolboys on August 18.\n1929 Inaugural Papatoetoe club season.\nIt was reported in the Sun newspaper on April 5, 1929, that during the week “an enthusiastic and well-attended meeting was held in the Papatoetoe Town Hall” to “discuss the advisability of forming a rugby league football club in Papatoetoe. The day the club had officially formed as in fact Tuesday, April 2. The convenors of the meeting were Mr. J. Gedye and Mr. Claude Gartside Culpan, and they explained the reasons for calling the meeting. It was then unanimously decided to form a club which would be called “Papatoetoe Rugby League Football Club”. They had decided to field three teams in the Auckland Rugby League competitions with a practice held on the following Saturday when official team coaches Joe Bennett and J. Gedye would meet the players. Mr. Ivan Culpan, secretary of the Auckland Rugby League also visited during the evening to give some advice. The same evening that the club was formed a deputation from the club “waited on the Papatoetoe Town Board and asked that they be allowed a portion of the local sports areas for the playing of the competition games. The board realising that the progress of the district warranted progress in sport, gave the deputation a very favourable hearing”. The Town Board had received the deputation on the Tuesday indicating that the initial meeting may have taken place on Monday, 1 April. The Town Board was said to have referred the matter to the “Reserves Committee”. The following officers were elected to their inaugural committee:- Patron, Mr. Arthur William Hall, M.P.; president, Mr. W. Civil; secretary, Mr. Claude Culpan; treasurer, Mr. J. Gedye; committee, Messrs. J. Bennett, R. Harper, L. Pinfold, Clarence Gartside Culpan, jun., R. Bennett; coaches, Messrs. J. Bennett and J. Gedye. Their coach, Joe Bennett was a New Zealand international rugby league player from 1920 and had played at senior and representative level from 1910 to 1920 in Auckland.\nThe Papatoetoe Town Board decided a few weeks later, at their May 1 meeting that they would “invite a conference of league and rugby football organisations to discuss provision of playing areas” for the 1929 season. The following evening the codes met and it was “decided to ask the respective organisations to make applications for grounds on the following basis: rugby union, 2; rugby league, 1; hockey, 1”. In the meantime the Papatoetoe club had been unable to gather enough players for three teams and was only able to enter one team, which would play in the 6th B Grade. However they did also field a team in the schoolboys competition. On May 1 the club requested assistance from the Auckland Rugby League in the purchase of jerseys, with the matter referred to the finance committee, giving them the power to act. Although not mentioned at the time it was later mentioned that the clubs colours were blue and gold.\nTheir first ever match was against Richmond B at the Papatoetoe Recreation Ground at 2pm on May 4, 1929, with Mr. W. Weston refereeing. The team struggled, losing 37–0, however the Richmond club was the strongest junior club in Auckland in the 1920s and 30s and the Richmond B team would go on to win the grade undefeated, thrashing most teams by similar scores. The first ever Papatoetoe team was published in the New Zealand Herald and was: R. Docherty, Leonard Leaning, Alexander Bow, A. Culpan, R. Field, T. Fielder, Stanley Lusby, Kenneth Pennell, J. Harvey, George Mains, Samuel Pinfold, G. Hamilton, Ronald Leaning, and T. Greer. They performed creditably in the 1929 season, finishing 6th in the 9 team competition, with 5 wins, a draw, and 8 losses, scoring 140 points and conceding 215.\nOn June 15 the first ever senior game of rugby league was played in Papatoetoe when Otahuhu and Point Chevalier Senior B teams met at the Papatoetoe Recreation Ground. The two teams were first and second on the table and finished that way at the end of the season. A crowd of 1,000 interested onlookers turned up to see Otahuhu upset the leaders 10–6. The Auckland Star wrote that “it was a wise move to play a senior match at Papatoetoe, and it is to be hoped that the Auckland League will send teams more often to the district”.\nTo raise money and foster club spirit the club held a series of “progressive card evenings” in the club's rooms, with the first held on Thursday, August 8. It was reported that Mr H. McMechan and Mr. Barrington won prizes at the first event. It was reported in mid November that “in view of the success of [the] card evenings held weekly during the winter months…, it was decided at a function held in the Renown Hall on Thursday evening to continue the evenings for a further period. An average attendance of about forty people was reported by the committee”. On November 2 the league club entered an 880-yard relay team in the opening carnival of the Papatoetoe Amateur Athletic and Cycle Club at the recreation ground. In early October the Papatoetoe Town Board “sought the cooperation of the Auckland Rugby League in a gala day attraction at the opening of the band rotunda” at the Wallace Road Park Reserve on December 14. The league referred the matter to the Papatoetoe League Club for report. The Wallace Road Reserve was situated behind the Papatoetoe Town Hall on the present day site of the Allan Brewster Leisure Centre.\n1930 Season (4th, 5th and Schoolboy Grades).\nThe 1930 season saw Papatoetoe field teams in the 4th and 5th grades as well as a schools team. On May 6 a conference was held by the Papatoetoe Town Board with representatives of the league club, the rugby union club, hockey club, cricket club, and amateur athletic and cycling clubs. The meeting was to discuss the paying of fees by the clubs for the use of sports areas in the town district. The suggestion by the Town Board was that the clubs would be charged £7 10s for a playing area for a season. The clubs “expressed the opinion that the charge was not excessive, considering the work the board intended to carry out, but they questioned the ability of their clubs to find the money”.\nOn Thursday evening, May 22 the club held an “old time dance” at the Papatoetoe Town Hall with music supplied by the Papatoetoe Old Time Orchestra. The hall was decorated in the clubs colours of blue and gold with Mr. J. Henderson and W. Postlewait “in charge of the floor”. The club was congratulated by patron, and M.P. A.W. Hall on the progress that they had made since their inception. Competition dances were held along with a Euchre tournament which was won by Mrs. F. Lusby and Mr. Lusby. At the same event the club's secretary, Mr. Claude Gartside Culpan said three teams had been entered for the season and training was being given to thirty schoolboys. Claude Culpan was a brother of Ivan Culpan, long time secretary of Auckland Rugby League, and Nelson Culpan who was on the New Zealand Rugby League board. Ultimately they didn't field 3 adult teams but did field one more than the previous season with two sides playing.\nThe 4th Grade team only won around 3 of their matches, losing 9 to finish near the bottom of the standings. Likewise the 5th Grade team struggled, reportedly winning 2 matches and losing 12. Their team for the 7th of June match was Hely, McCauley, Leaning (2), Pinfold, Pennell, Hamilton, Hyland, Billington, Paterson, Marshall, Fielder, Graham, Matson, and Lusby. Their primary schools side performed much better, winning at least 5 of their games, drawing 1, and losing 4 to finish relatively high in the 18 team standings.\nOn December 4 the club held their final card evening of the year at the Renown Hall in Papatoetoe. Their card season had run from May to December, and a “large attendance of players and supporters of the club” was present. Treasurer Mr. Laurence Lovett presented the prizes for the evening and reported that the club had had a successful season financially. Their patron, the Reform Party M.P. Arthur Hall made a lengthy speech about the comparison's between parliament and sports which was quoted in part in the Auckland Star on November 3.\n1931 season (3rd Open, 4th, 7th, and Schoolboy Grades).\nAt their 1931 annual meeting in mid April a large attendance of players and supporters was present. With F. Healy presiding the report and balance sheet showed that the club was in a sound financial position. The following officers were elected:- Patron, Mr. Arthur Hall, M.P.; president, Mr. J. Franklin; vice presidents, Messrs. Eric Holdsworth Burton, W. Balderson, G. Cregan, F.E. Carr, H.C. Ernest, William Dulihanty, P. Dawson, J. Walker, W. Young, Thomas Richard Smytheman, William Nesbitt, B.L. Liversy, F. White, Albert George Grinter, P.E. Suttie, W. Willcox, C.J. Mahon, J. Gedye, P.W. Walker, Dr. James Jefcoate Valentine and Alfred Barrett Jameson; secretary, Mr. Laurence William Lovett; assistant secretary, Mr. C. Patterson; auditor, Mr. Neville St George; chairman of committee, Mr. J. Kidd; club captain, Mr. Joseph Henderson; coaches, Messrs. Laurence Lovett, Gallaher, Coon, Henderson; executive committee, Messrs. J. Kidd, E. Leaning, C.G. Culpan, F. Healy, E. Morris, N. Harris, W. Coon, R. Marshall, and J. Henderson. Their auditor, Neville St George was a former New Zealand rugby league international who was still playing senior rugby league at this time but nearing the end of his career. He was living in Papatoetoe at the time despite playing for the North Shore Albions based in Devonport where he had grown up. They decided to nominate five teams for the season, third grade open, fourth grade, fifth grade, sixth grade, and schoolboys.\nAlmost immediately after being named patron once more, Arthur Hall collapsed while in Wellington due to an intracerebral hemorrhage on April 16 and died 2 days later at Wellington Hospital aged 50.\nVery few results were reported during the season. Of the 3rd grade open sides 12 matches only 3 results were reported. They were a 27–0 loss to Marist Old Boys on June 20, a win by default over Glen Lynn on July 4, and a 17–0 loss to Richmond Rovers on July 11. They then lost to Ponsonby United in the first round of the knockout competition on September 5. Their team for their first match of the season was Abbott, Campbell, Dawson, Billington, McDonald, Pinfold, Dockerty, Rawson, Mattson (captain), Pennell, Linburn, Culpan, Fowler, Green, and McKenzie. Their 4th Grade side finished towards the bottom of the standings with just one reported win (5-0 v Papakura on June 27), and 9 losses. The win over Papakura was played at Prince Edward Park in Papakura and a small piece describing the match was published in the Franklin Times. Their winning try came in the second half after they broke out and followed up a kick to score near the posts. The Papatoetoe 7th Grade team faired a little better, winning 3 matches, drawing 2, and losing 4, with 6 other results not reported. This meant that they finished around mid table in the 8 team competition. Their primary school team had 5 wins reported and just 1 loss with 9 scores not reported meaning they likely finished in the first 3 out of 10 sides competing.\nOn June 3 the club published a notice in the Auckland Star newspaper thanking Mr. R. Hatton for his donation for their jersey fund, while they posted a similar notice on the same day in the New Zealand Herald thanking Mr. R. Hilton. On July 24 the club held their annual ball at the Papatoetoe Town Hall. The hall was decorated in their blue and gold colours with Mr. J. Franklin, the club president welcoming visitors. While Messrs. Laurence Lovett, J. Smith, J. Henderson, Rawlands, and Kidd in charge of the programme.\n1932 Final Season (5th grade, Schoolboys).\n In 1932 the Papatoetoe club only fielded a single side in the adult grades, which was in the 5th Grade, and their schoolboys team once more. The 5th Grade team struggled and reportedly only won one match, 13–0 against Akarana on August 27, and 12 losses where they struggled to score any points. Their schoolboys side was also not particularly competitive, winning 2, losing 9, and having 8 results not reported to finish near the bottom of the standings. Following the season the club no longer fielded any teams and rugby league was not represented by any clubs in the area until the Papatoetoe Panthers club formed decades later which is based at Kohuora Park in Papatoetoe.\nTeam Records.\nMost Senior Team.\nThe season record for the most senior men's team in the club."

The club once again managed to get promoted to Serie B1 in 2016. \nIn 2018 Volley Group Roma acquired the rights to play in Serie A2 from another club, San Lazzaro, which had financial problems. After just one season in Serie A2 the club was relegated back to Serie B1. However, Volley Group Roma got the chance to continue playing in Serie A2 when the club Zambelli Orvieto announced that it would abandon the league.\nIn the summer of 2019 Volley Group Roma formed a joint partnership with the men's volleyball club A.P.D. Roma and the club changed its name to Roma Volley Club. In the 2020–2021 season Roma Volley Club won the Serie A2 promotion pool and was for the first time promoted to Serie A1.

Her success continued at the Sydney Tennis Classic with a lopsided defeat of reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu, in the first round. She subsequently withdrew from the tournament citing a thigh injury. She reached a career-high ranking of No. 12, on 17 January 2022.\nHer remaining early hardcourt season saw little progress with a second-round retirement and a walkover at the Australian Open and St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy, respectively, and a first-round loss at the Qatar Ladies Open. Her \"Sunshine Double\" (Miami and Indian Wells) saw improvement with a quarterfinal appearance at the Indian Wells Open against Maria Sakkari and a third-round appearance to Jessica Pegula at the Miami Open.\nHer clay-court season began with a second-round loss to Anhelina Kalinina after a first-round bye at Charleston. Following this, she represented Kazakhstan as the team's top seed and won both of her singles matches in a tie against Germany securing a berth in the finals later in the year. The remainder of her clay-court season saw little achievement as she failed to advance into the quarterfinals at the Stuttgart Open, Madrid Open, Italian Open, and French Open.\nRybakina's grass-court season in the lead up to Wimbledon saw a second-round loss to Shelby Rogers at the Rosmalen Open followed by a first-round bye and a second-round loss to Lesia Tsurenko at the Eastbourne International. At the Wimbledon Championships, she reached her second Grand Slam quarterfinal, defeating CoCo Vandeweghe, Bianca Andreescu, Zheng Qinwen and Petra Martić. Then she reached the semifinals at a Major for the first time, defeating Ajla Tomljanović in her quarterfinal match. She became the first Kazakhstani singles player (male or female) to reach the semifinal of a Grand Slam. Then she reached her first Major final, after defeating Simona Halep in straight sets, becoming the youngest Wimbledon finalist since Garbiñe Muguruza in 2015. After dropping the first set, she defeated Ons Jabeur in three sets to secure her first major title. She became the youngest woman champion since the 21-year-old Petra Kvitová in 2011. She was the fourth-youngest active Grand Slam champion, older only than Iga Świątek, Bianca Andreescu and Emma Raducanu. Rybakina's Russian nationality and previous international representation of Russia became a matter of public discourse in the aftermath of her success at Wimbledon 2022, where Wimbledon had banned athletes representing Russia and Belarus due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russian state media celebrated Rybakina's win as a national victory despite her longstanding decision not to represent the country of her birth.\nThe North American hardcourt season began with early round losses at the Silicon Valley Classic (first round) and Canadian Open (second round). Her US Open preparations continued at the Cincinnati Open where she advanced to the quarterfinals and was defeated by Madison Keys. Her season continued next with an entry to the US Open as the 25th seed; however, she lost in the first round to qualifier Clara Burel.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Elena Rybakina in 2022.\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head match-ups.\nRybakina has a WTA match win–loss record in the 2022 season.

        "title": "List of Baseball Academic All-America Team Members of the Year",
        "text": "The following is a list of the annual selection by College Sports Communicators (CSC), known before the 2022–23 season as the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA), and its Academic All-America sponsor of the individual athlete selected as the most outstanding of the annual Baseball Academic All-America selections. Between 1996 and 2011, one winner each was chosen from both the college and University Divisions for all twelve Academic All-America teams including football. The Academic All-America program recognizes combined athletic and academic excellence of the nation's top student-athletes. The University Division team included eligible participants from National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I member schools, while the College Division team included scholar-athletes from all of the following: NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), Canadian universities and colleges and two-year schools.\nBeginning in 2012, CSC revamped its award structure. The University Division was renamed \"Division I\". Since then, NCAA Divisions II and III have had their own separate All-Americans. The College Division consisted only of non-NCAA institutions through the 2017–18 school year, after which it was effectively replaced by an NAIA division restricted to members of that governing body.\nCurrently, each team selects Academic All-District honorees in eight geographic districts across the United States and Canada. The districts are as follows: – District 1 (CT, MA, ME, NH, NY, RI, VT), District 2 (DC, DE, KY, MD, NJ, PA, WV), District 3 (NC, TN, VA), District 4 (AL, FL, GA, PR, SC), District 5 (IL, IN, MI, OH), District 6 (AR, IA, LA, MN, MO, MS, MT, ND, SD, WI, WY), – District 7 (CO, ID, KS, NE, NM, NV, OK, TX), District 8 (AK, AZ, CA, HI, OR, UT, WA, Canada). First team All-District honorees make the All-America team ballots. Currently, all twelve Academic All-American teams (men's and women's basketball, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's track &amp; field, men's baseball, women's softball, men's American football, women's volleyball and men's and women's at-large teams) have four Academic All-Americans of the Year, one from each division. In each of the four divisions (NAIA, Division I, Division II, and Division III), one of the twelve sport-by-sport Academic All-Americans of the Year is selected as the Academic All-America Team Member of the Year for that division.\nHistory.\n, Johns Hopkins University (31) has had the most baseball Academic All-America honorees, just ahead of Bucknell University and Notre Dame University with 30 each. While Bucknell has had an athlete win this award, neither Notre Dame's nor Johns Hopkins' athletes have been recognized with this award.\nOn August 7, 2012, Division III honoree Drew Golz of Wheaton College became the first Baseball Academic All-America Team Member of the Year to be named Division III Academic All-America Team Member of the Year. That same year Golz had been named Men's Soccer Academic All-America Team Member of the Year, becoming the first male student-athlete to be named Academic All-America Team Member of the Year for two different sports in the same year. The next day, Division II honoree Bryan Lippincott of Concordia University, St. Paul became the Division II Academic All-America Team Member of the Year. Thus, for the 2011–12 academic calendar, baseball had the Academic All-America Team Member of the Year for two of the four Divisions. The most recent baseball awardee that was named overall Academic All-America Team Member of the Year is John Coleman of Division III Clarkson University. Like Golz, Clarkson was named Academic All-America Team Member of the Year, having been previously named Academic All-America Team Member of the Year in basketball. Coleman was the third and second male two-sport honoree, following Golz in 2011–12 and Cynthia Capp of West Virginia Wesleyan who earned the honor in volleyball (1990) and softball (1991).\nWhen the Division I level was known as the University Division, it had repeat back-to-back winners in 2000 &amp; 2001 and 2002 &amp; 2003 with Casey Myers (of Arizona State Sun Devils baseball) being followed by Jeff Leise (of Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball). In 2001 and 2002, Douglas Hargett of University of North Alabama was the first College Division repeat winner before the College Division was split. Since Division II and Division III were split from NAIA, two-year and Canadian schools, Conner Combs repeated for the Division III East Texas Baptist Tigers in 2016 and 2017.\nTables of winners.\nNames in bold indicate winners of the all-sports Academic All-America award."

The runner-up of previous season and table topper of this season, Delhi Capitals played in the final against the winner of this season's Eliminator, Royal Challengers Bangalore to decide the winner of the 2024 season.\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore won the match and the maiden title by defeating Delhi Capitals by eight wickets.\nBackground.\nOn 14 February 2024, the BCCI announced the schedule for the 2024 season of the Women's Premier League. Bengaluru and Delhi hosted the whole season with the playoffs and the Final being played at the Arun Jaitley Cricket Stadium, New Delhi.\nRoad to the final.\nDelhi Capitals began their campaign with a loss against Mumbai Indians, in their first game at the Chinnaswamy stadium in Bangalore. However, they regained momentum by securing victories against UP Warriorz and Royal Challengers Bangalore, propelled them forward with 4 points. Their winning streak continued as they won against Gujarat Giants and Mumbai Indians, accumulating a total of 8 points, as they moved to the Delhi leg of the league stage. Despite a loss against UP Warriorz, they managed to top the table with two successive wins against Royal Challengers Bangalore and Gujarat Giants. They made it to the finals as the leaders of the points table at the end of the league stage.\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore commenced their league stage campaign with a win against UP Warriorz, followed by a victory against Gujarat Giants, before losing to Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians back to back. They had a mixed showing in the second segment of the league stage in Delhi, winning two games while losing two games to Gujarat and Delhi. They made it to the playoffs stage where they defeated Mumbai Indians in the eliminator game to make it to the finals.\nMatch.\nDelhi Capitals innings.\nDelhi Capitals Women won the toss and elected to bat first against Royal Challengers Bangalore Women. The innings kicked off with promising starts from Meg Lanning and Shafali Verma, but soon faced a setback when Lanning fell victim to a lbw delivery by Shreyanka Patil after scoring 23 runs. Verma, however, showcased a brilliant display of batting, scoring 44 runs off just 27 deliveries, including 2 fours and 3 sixes, before being caught by Georgia Wareham off Sophie Molineux's bowling. The batting order suffered a collapse with quick dismissals of Jemimah Rodrigues, Alice Capsey, and Marizanne Kapp, all falling without adding any significant score, and the Capitals at 81 for the loss of six wickets. Despite contributions from Radha Yadav, Minnu Mani, and Arundhati Reddy, the team struggled to build partnerships. For the Royal Challengers, Patil and Molineux claimed 4 and 3 wickets respectively, while Asha Sobhana also chipped in with 2 crucial dismissals.\nDelhi Capitals Women managed to post a total of 113 runs in their allotted 20 overs, with Shikha Pandey remaining unbeaten on 5 runs. However, the innings was marked by a lack of substantial partnerships and a flurry of wickets, causing their run rate to stagnate around 6.10. Royal Challengers Bangalore Women's bowlers displayed a disciplined performance, and ensuring regular breakthroughs.\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore innings.\nChasing 114 to win, Royal Challengers Bangalore Women embarked on their innings with Smriti Mandhana and Sophie Devine at the crease. Mandhana anchored the innings with a knock of 31 runs off 39 deliveries before being caught by Arundhati Reddy off Minnu Mani's bowling. Devine, on the other hand, provided the much-needed impetus to the innings, scoring a brisk 32 runs off 27 deliveries before being dismissed lbw by Shikha Pandey. However, their partnership laid a solid foundation for the chase. Ellyse Perry took charge of the innings thereafter, displaying her experience and skill to remain unbeaten on 35 runs off 37 balls, steering her team closer to victory. Richa Ghosh scored a quickfire 17 runs off 14 deliveries, ensuring there were no hiccups towards the end of the innings. Royal Challengers Bangalore Women chased down the target with 3 balls to spare, finishing at 115/2 in 19.3 overs, clinching the championship title of the 2024 Women's Premier League.\nRoyal Challengers' Sophie Molineux was declared the player of the match.\nScorecard.\nFall of wickets: 64/1 (S.

        "title": "John Sterling (baseball)",
        "text": "John Albert Sterling (September 1865 – November 10, 1908) was an American baseball player who played one game for the 1890 Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association. Until 2023, Sterling was known to baseball historians by only his last name.\nEarly life.\nSterling was born in Philadelphia to Jesse and Henrietta Sterling (née Brown) in September 1865. His birth registration lists his name as John Pierce Sterling. Sterling was raised in Philadelphia and was the oldest of five brothers. In the 1880 census, his middle name was given as \"Albert.\" At fourteen years old, he was recorded as being home instead of attending school. His father, a sailmaker and Civil War veteran, was afflicted by rheumatism and his mother was a homemaker. That same year, his father was charged with \"beating and abusing\" his mother. His mother alleged that Mr. Sterling had knocked her down.\nBaseball career.\nSterling began the 1888 season with a minor league club in Minneapolis. By May 22, however, he was released along with teammate Frank Graves. He next joined the Jackson, Michigan club of the Tri-State League but was released in early June along with Ed Flynn. In July, Sterling was playing for a minor league team in Ashland, Pennsylvania when he was signed by the St. Louis Browns. Before appearing in any games, however, Browns treasurer Jim Gifford arranged for him to pitch to Browns catchers Jack Boyle and Jocko Milligan. The catchers were not impressed and Sterling was given his release without having appeared in a game. The following year, Sterling returned to Pennsylvania to play for Charlie Mason's minor league Philadelphia Giants.\nPrior to the 1890 season, Sterling was one of roughly 300 players who responded to a circular issued by National League president Nicholas Young, making it known that he was interested in joining the league. Sterling may also have been the pitcher for a team of locals picked to play an exhibition against the Athletics prior to the start of the 1890 season.\nSterling began 1890 with Charlie Mason's minor league club in Allentown but, by early June, he had parted ways with the dysfunctional club which would later fold midseason after Mason abandoned it in July. On June 10, 1890, the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" reported that Sterling was seeking a tryout with manager Jack Clements of the Philadelphia Phillies. Instead, two days later, Sterling settled for a contract with Tom York's Albany club in the New York State League. York was replaced by William Primrose in early July and \"The Sun\" reported that the majority of the team's players were expected to be released. A day later, the \"Albany Morning Express\" reported that Sterling had been released, ostensibly due to drunkenness.\nPhiladelphia Athletics.\nIn 1890, the Philadelphia Athletics were one of three professional baseball teams in Philadelphia, which hosted the Phillies and the Players' League club also known as the Philadelphia Athletics. By July, the club had not been able to fully pay its players. In September, William Whitaker announced the club was bankrupt and ownership was transferred to Billy Barnie, who also owned and managed the Baltimore Orioles. Barnie released most of the team's players and signed many of them to the Orioles. Others abandoned the team voluntarily. The Athletics, as a result, filled out their roster with players who had limited playing experience and who agreed to receive a portion of ticket sales instead of a salary. Sterling was one of those players. He pitched the entirety of a rain-shortened, five-inning game against the Syracuse Stars on October 12, 1890 in front of only twenty spectators in Gloucester City, New Jersey. Sterling, who pitched \"in a black cloth suit, with low cut vest and white stand-up collar\" allowed 12 runs in his five innings of work. Sterling would never appear in another professional baseball game. It was the final loss in a 21-game season-ending losing streak for the Athletics and the final game in franchise history. Owner and manager Bill Sharsig announced the following day that the team would be disbanded for good.\nPersonal life.\nSterling married his wife, Maggie (née Brady), in 1887. Their first son, also named John, was born in Pennsylvania in January 1891. By the late 1890s, Sterling was working as a minstrel performer, singing \"comic songs\" and coon songs. On June 28, 1899, Sterling's wife gave birth to their second son, William, in Gloucester City. In the 1900 census, Sterling's occupation was listed as \"Musician.\" By that point, he was living with his family in a rented home in Gloucester City.\nSterling became active in Democratic Party politics in New Jersey in the early 20th century. In 1901, he was one of the party's nominees for Justice of the Peace for Gloucester City. In September 1904, he was nominated by the party to be the city's Overseer of the Poor. After a recount, Sterling won the position by ten votes, a margin of less than one percent. He served in that position for a year. In 1905, he was on the losing end of a ten-vote margin in the election for Constable of Gloucester City. That year, his occupation was listed in the New Jersey state census as \"Laborer.\" Two years later, he was floated as a possible candidate for the city's Chief of Police.\nLater life and death.\nSterling's father died in November 1904 after suffering a paralytic stroke in an old soldiers' home in Erie, Pennsylvania, across the entire state of Pennsylvania from Sterling. In August 1908, Sterling filed a personal injury suit seeking $5,000 in damages () after being seriously injured in a fall on a sidewalk in Gloucester City.\nOn November 10, Sterling was reported to be lying at home seriously ill. He died the same day. He was remembered in the \"Courier-Post\" as \"an all-around athlete\" and \"quite a pugilist.\" He was remembered in the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" as \"a well-known minstrel and Democratic politician.\" His funeral was well attended by the Democrats of Gloucester City. He was interred in the city's Union Cemetery. A few days later, Sterling's mother also passed away at her home on the same street. The \"Philadelphia Inquirer\", which described her as \"the largest woman in Gloucester,\" speculated that grief over the death of her son, a \"well-known minstrel and Democratic politician ... doubtlessly hastened her death.\"\nIdentification.\nSterling, along with McBride, Stafford and Sweigert, was one of four Athletics who appeared in their only Major League game on October 12, 1890. For years, these players were conflated with other baseball people of the era who shared their last names. Lacking any evidence to confirm these identifications, however, the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) determined in 2007 that their biographical information would be removed and that their given names would be reclassified as unidentified. The only clue as to Sterling's identity came from the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\"'s coverage of the game which identified him as a \"young man of Camden.\" Camden \"County\", New Jersey is across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, where Sterling was born, and home to Gloucester City, where Sterling was living by the 1890s.\nIn February 2023, Sterling was identified for the first time in a report by SABR. Researchers tracked him from team to team between 1888 and 1890 and were able to corroborate many details of his life via his obituary and genealogical records. SABR published a biography of Sterling by Tim Hagerty on its website that year."

This was the 51st season of Division III college ice hockey.\nRegular season.\nAfter the closure of Finlandia University the entire ice hockey program (men's and women's) was transferred to the University of Dubuque.\nMCLA restarted its ice hockey program this season, returning to the ice for the first time since 2003.\nLittle East.\nPrior to the start of the season, the Little East Conference announced that it would begin sponsoring ice hockey for the first time. The conference projected to begin play in the 2025–26 season and would coincide with the return of Keene State's ice hockey program. The other five Little East members who already field teams are Massachusetts–Boston, Massachusetts–Dartmouth, Plymouth State, Southern Maine and Vermont State Castleton. Because the conference would begin play with six member teams, the Little east would immediately receive an automatic bid for the NCAA tournament.\nPairWise Rankings.\nThe PairWise Rankings (PWR) are a statistical tool designed to approximate the process by which the NCAA selection committee decides which teams get at-large bids to the 16-team NCAA tournament. Although the NCAA selection committee does not use the PWR as presented by USCHO, the PWR has been accurate in predicting which teams will make the tournament field.\nFor Division III men, all teams are included in comparisons starting in the 2013–14 season (formerly, only teams with a Ratings Percentage Index of .500 or above, or teams under consideration, were included). The PWR method compares each team with every other such team, with the winner of each “comparison” earning one PWR point. After all comparisons are made, the points are totaled up and rankings listed accordingly.\nWith 85 Division III men's teams, the greatest number of PWR points any team could earn is 84, winning the comparison with every other team. Meanwhile, a team that lost all of its comparisons would have no PWR points.\nTeams are then ranked by PWR point total, with ties broken by the teams’ RPI ratings, which starting in 2013–14 is weighted for home and road games and includes a quality wins bonus (QWB) for beating teams in the top 20 of the RPI (it also is weighted for home and road).\nWhen it comes to comparing teams, the PWR uses three criteria which are combined to make a comparison: RPI, record against common opponents and head-to-head competition. Starting in 2013–14, the comparison of record against teams under consideration was dropped because all teams are now under comparison."

Based in Oklahoma City, they operated within the American Hockey Association for three seasons before folding due to financial difficulties.\nHistory.\nIn 1933, Noel Lyons purchased the rights to start a franchise in Oklahoma City from the American Hockey Association. The team debuted in November of that year, playing out of the second Oklahoma Coliseum (the first was destroyed by fire in 1930). The team was unsuccessful in its first season, losing nearly twice as many games as they won. The Warriors changed from a red and white color scheme to green and white for the start of the second season but the new look did not bring about any changes on the ice.\nEntering the team's third season, Lyon's sold the club to Harry E. Turner who would in turn transfer the club to Dutch Seebold during the year. That season saw the team finally produce a decent season but, in the midst of the great depression, the team was very short on cash. With seven games left on its schedule, Seebold sold the club to Pete Mitchell, the Warriors' player/coach. He moved the team to Minneapolis on March 12 but the change in locales was unable to save the franchise and the Warriors disbanded after the year."

The tournament began as a four-team invitational, but is expected to expand to an eight-team league format by 2028.\nThe inaugural tournament was held in 2023 in Mérida, Mexico. It was won by the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks of the American Association.\nParticipants.\nWhile the Caribbean Series is generally limited to Latin American winter league teams, BCL Americas includes the champions of the top-level independent (i.e. not affiliated with Major League Baseball) summer leagues in Mexico and the United States.\nCuba and Colombia had previously participated in the Caribbean Series, but both were dropped after the 2023 edition of the tournament."

After graduating in 1927, he became the team's head coach. From 1927 to 1931, he coached the \"Wonder Five\" of Matty Begovich, Mac Kinsbrunner, Max Posnack, Allie Schuckman, and Jack \"Rip\" Gerson. The group compiled a 88–8 record and led the university to national prominence. He also served as the school's baseball coach and athletic director. He resigned unexpectedly in 1936 without giving a reason. \nIn 1937, Freeman became basketball head coach at St. Thomas College (now known as the University of Scranton). He left the school after one season to become athletic director at Iona Preparatory School, where he had coached football since 1928. In 1938, he became an assistant basketball coach at Long Island University. He succeeded Clair Bee as the school's baseball coach the following spring. In 1941, he became head basketball coach at Power Memorial Academy. In 1947, Freeman returned to the University of Scranton following the in-season resignation of John \"Les\" Dickman. He resigned after two losing seasons and rejoined the athletic staff at LIU, where he remained until the school dropped its basketball program in 1951 following a point shaving scandal.\nFreeman served as an assistant coach under one of his former players, Frank McGuire, at the University of North Carolina and University of South Carolina. McGuire called Freeman \"the best assistant coach in the business\" and gave him much of the credit for the success of the Tar Heels national championship team. In between his stints at the two schools, Freeman was a scout for the Houston Colt 45s.\nFreeman resigned after the 1972–73 season, but remained involved with the South Carolina program as a consultant and adviser. He died on February 14, 1974 at Providence Hospital in Columbia, South Carolina."

        "text": "Richard Williams (born 1945) is a former American basketball coach. Currently, he serves as special assistant to the head coach at Southern Miss.\nEarly life.\nWilliams was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi and attended Mississippi State University as a freshman in 1963. Williams began his coaching career as a volunteer coach for seventh grade basketball while working as a math teacher. He worked in a variety of positions in coaching in schools such as Montelbello Junior High and South Natchez. He served as a part-time coach on the staff of Bob Boyd beginning in 1984.\nCoaching career.\nWilliams was hired in March 1986. He served as the head men's basketball coach at Mississippi State University through the 1997–98 season, compiling a record of 191–163. His 191 victories are the second most of any head coach in Mississippi State Bulldogs men's basketball program, history, bested only by his former assistant, Rick Stansbury. Williams's 1991 squad won the Southeastern Conference regular season championship and made the 1991 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament for the first time since 1963 and just second time in school history, where they lost in the first round to Eastern Michigan. \nDuring his tenure, the Bulldogs beat Kentucky for the first time in school history, doing so in the 1994-95 season. His 1995 squad made the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament, but his 1996 squad would go further. The Bulldogs won the 1996 SEC men's basketball tournament with an 84-73 victory over Kentucky (who had not lost an SEC game all season) to win their first SEC title and first overall conference tournament since 1923. Playing as a 5 seed in the Southeast Region of the Division I tournament, they beat 12-seed VCU 58–51 and 13-seed Princeton 63–41 to face the #1 seed Connecticut in the Sweet Sixteen. They won 60–55 to set their first Elite Eight matchup against #2 seed Cincinnati. They beat the Bearcats 73-63 to win the Regional championship. In the Final Four, they were matched against Syracuse, who beat them 77–69. The team was the first (and currently only) team from the state of Mississippi to reach the Final Four of the NCAA Division I Tournament. He received two SEC Coach of the Year awards. \nOn March 12, 1998, Williams resigned as the head coach at Mississippi State two years removed from his Final Four appearance, citing burnout.\nAfter leaving Mississippi State, Williams coached the Memphis Houn'Dawgs of the American Basketball Association (ABA), the Jackson Rage of the World Basketball Association (WBA), and at his alma mater, Pearl High School in Pearl, Mississippi. He served as the director of basketball administration at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) in 2008 and in 2009 he was named the director of basketball administration and program coordinator for the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball team on a volunteer basis. Williams was an assistant coach for Arkansas State under John Brady from 2010 to 2014. Williams served as the color commentator for the Mississippi State basketball team's radio broadcasts from the 2014–15 season through the 2019–2020 season."

The first meeting between the two occurred on 2 February 1923 and was largely recurring afterwards.\nHistory.\nBoth RMC and Army were earlier adopters of ice hockey programs in their respective countries. After World War I, the first conflict that included both Canada and the United States on the same side, the two academies were looking to strengthen ties to one another. In 1921, Brig. Gen. Douglas MacArthur wrote a letter to Maj. Gen. Sir Archibald Macdonell, suggesting the two institutions arrange a meeting between their respective ice hockey teams. Two years later the details were finalized and RMC travelled to West Point for the inaugural meeting. The match was held on Stuart Rink a natural, seasonal surface and kicked off a rivalry between the two schools that has endured for over a century.\nIn the first 15 years of the annual rivalry, RMC held the distinct advantage, going 14–0–1 from 1923 to 1938. Army was able to earn its first victory in 1939 but then the series was suspended during World War II (RMC did not field a team during the war except for a single game against Army in 1942). When the Reds returned in 1949, Army found itself as the better of the two and closed the gap in the series record. RMC would not win back-to-back games until the early 1980s but that stretch was fleeting for the Paladins. Army put together several winning streaks over the years and eventually took the lead in the series in the 1990s. The series was halted after 2006 and did not resume until 2011. Upon its return, Army won eight consecutive matches, their longest streak to date, before RMC stopped the run in 2020. From 2021 through 2023, the annual games were cancelled in large part due to the COVID-19 pandemic but the two finally resumed the series in 2024.\nGame results.\nFull game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1998–99 season."

        "text": "The World Masters of Snooker is a professional snooker non-ranking tournament held at the Global Theatre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and part of the Riyadh Season festival in the entertainment district Boulevard City within Riyadh, the inaugural 2024 event was the first professional snooker tournament held in Saudi Arabia. The tournament introduced a special 20-point gold ball called the \"Riyadh Season ball\", which could only be after a player had completed a maximum break of 147 to extend the break to 167.\nThe event features a total prize fund of £785,000, with the winner receiving £250,000, the second highest top prize in professional snooker, tied with The Masters and after the World Championship. The 2024 event also had a $500,000 (about £395,000) prize for the first player to compile a 167 break, but it was not given as no players achieved the feat, and the prize was increased to $1,000,000 (about £785,000) for the 2025 event.\nThe defending champion is Ronnie O'Sullivan, who defeated Luca Brecel 52 in the 2024 final, capturing his fifth professional title of the 2023–24 season.\nHistory.\nIn December 2019, World Snooker Tour (WST) announced a 10-year deal with Saudi Arabia, including ranking tournaments that will be hosted in the country. However, no snooker tournaments were held in Saudi Arabia in the next four years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2024, WST announced a new non-ranking tournament called the World Masters of Snooker, scheduled to take place from 4 to 6 March 2024 at the Boulevard Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It is the first professional snooker tournament to be held in Saudi Arabia, amid the country's growing investment in various sports.\nFormat.\nThe matches were played under regular snooker rules, but the event introduced a new gold ball worth 20 points, called the \"Riyadh Season ball\". The gold ball was placed on the centre of the , in line with the , , , and balls. It could only be after a player had completed a maximum break of 147, to extend the break to 167. It would be a four-point foul if the gold ball was potted earlier in the , or hit before the . The gold ball stayed on the table as long as it was possible for either player to complete a maximum break, then it was removed from the table until the next frame.\nThe 2024 event featured 12 players, including the top ten players on the snooker world rankings, with the reigning World Champion, Luca Brecel, seeded first, and the rest based on their rankings. It also featured two local wildcard players, Ali Alobaidli from Qatar and Omar Alajlani from Saudi Arabia.\nControversies.\nThe announcement of the event, hailed as a \"huge breakthrough\" by WST chairman, Steve Dawson, was met with criticism accusing Saudi Arabia of sportswashing. Amnesty International criticised snooker's involvement in Saudi Arabia, amid its human rights abuses. Peter Frankental, Amnesty International UK's Economic Affairs director, said: \"It was just a matter of time before Saudi Arabia's huge sportswashing machine sucked in snooker along with almost every other major world sport. If the likes of Ronnie O'Sullivan and Judd Trump play in Riyadh, they shouldn't hesitate to speak out about human rights.\" Some players have also criticised WST of overly focusing on events featuring the top players. Amateur player Steven Hallworth tweeted: \"Was starting to lose sleep with worry that the top eight players might run out of events and cash soon, thank God for this.\"\nThe introduction of the 20-point gold ball was criticised by \"The Independent\" journalist Luke Baker, who called it a \"ludicrous gimmick\" and \"the sign of a desperate sport\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" chief sports writer Oliver Brown described the Saudi invention as \"warping the very rules of the game for its own hubristic ends\", calling it \"frivolous, tasteless, wretched\"."

He later attended the Newport College of Technology, part of the University of Wales, Newport, receiving a degree in metallurgy. He moved to the U.S. in 1967 to work for a crucible steel business in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He grew up playing association football (soccer) and tried out for the local Pittsburgh Phantoms of the short-lived National Professional Soccer League (NPSL), making the team while appearing in three matches as an inside forward.\nWatson was introduced to American football by a close friend and began practicing to be a placekicker after the Phantoms folded in late 1967. He attended a kicking camp hosted by the Dallas Cowboys and run by Ben Agajanian; Watson performed well enough to be signed by the team. He only appeared in preseason for the team and later requested a release. He tried out for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1969 and received a contract, later being sent to the Ohio Valley Ironmen of the Continental Football League (CoFL). He was 7-of-20 on field goal attempts and made all 32 of his extra point attempts with the Ironmen, scoring a total of 53 points while having a long of 41 yards.\nAfter returning to the Steelers in 1970, Watson played through preseason but was ultimately released in favor of Gene Mingo; however, after Mingo struggled late in the season, Watson was re-signed and played in the final four games. He made 5-of-10 field goal attempts and converted 7-of-8 extra point tries, scoring 22 points while his longest kick was 45 yards. He was released prior to the 1971 season in favor of Roy Gerela.\nAfter his stint with the Steelers, Watson played from 1971 to 1973 with the Youngstown Hardhats of the Midwest Football League (MFL), setting league records with a 56-yard field goal and 90-yard punt. He joined the Chicago Fire of the World Football League (WFL) in 1974, making 4-of-7 field goal attempts including a league-record 53-yard kick. He then played for their WFL successor, the Chicago Winds, in 1975, before retiring.\nWatson was married. He died on March 1, 2024, at the age of 81."

        "title": "Frank Fitzgerald (American football)",
        "text": "Frank Joseph Fitzgerald Sr. (August 15, 1919 – October 20, 2014) was an American football executive. He served as a general manager in the National Football League (NFL) for the team sequentially known as the Boston Yanks, the New York Bulldogs, the New York Yanks and the Dallas Texans from 1948 to 1952. He later worked in the radio business and announced NFL Draft picks for the Houston Oilers, later renamed to the Tennessee Titans.\nEarly life.\nSeveral primary documents listed Fitzgerald's birth date as August 15, 1919, in New York City; however, media sources frequently gave birth dates in 1920 or 1921. In October 1940, he enlisted in World War II; at the time, he was listed as being unemployed. He served for the United States Army Air Corps. In January 1942, Fitzgerald married in New York City to Adelaide Collins, the daughter of Ted Collins, Kate Smith's talent manager.\nExecutive career.\nTed Collins became the owner of the Boston Yanks of the National Football League (NFL) in 1944, and in 1946, he hired Fitzgerald to the team. Fitzgerald was the team's \"publicity man\" by 1947. He moved to Boston, Massachusetts, in mid-1948, and that year became the team's general manager, taking over the duties of Arthur Sampson. He was just 28 years old when he took over the team's management. That year, the team compiled a record of 3–9 and finished last in their division.\nThe franchise was moved to New York in 1949 and became the New York Bulldogs, with Fitzgerald remaining as general manager. They totaled a record of 1–10–1 in 1949 and were renamed the New York Yanks in 1950. The team went 7–5 for a third-place divisional finish in 1950, but then went 1–9–2 the following year and again finished last. Collins sold the team in 1952 and they became the Dallas Texans; new owner Giles E. Miller retained Fitzgerald as general manager and also gave him the role of vice president, being considered the unanimous choice based on recommendations by Collins and NFL commissioner Bert Bell. However, one month later, Fitzgerald resigned; a reporter for the \"Dallas Times-Herald\" noted that \"he was presented with a Western hat, but it was apparent that the hat did not fit ... Frank was a big city man and wasn't any more sold on the Texans than the Texans were on him.\" Al Ennis succeeded him, with the Texans ultimately going 1–11 that year and folding, becoming the most recent NFL team to fold.\nFitzgerald left football in 1953. He later recalled his experiences as a football executive: \"There was so much bidding over the players that the All-America Conference merged with the NFL in 1950. The Cleveland Browns, the old Baltimore Colts and the San Francisco 49ers went in. We combined some of the players and became the New York Yanks in 195[0]. I found myself making deals with men like Paul Brown and Art Rooney. Professional football was just beginning to gain ground.\" He also compared the modern NFL Draft to the old days: \"We had the first drafts In a room no bigger than a closet. Owners traded players on a handshake and their word was their contract. The first time Paul Brown of Cleveland asked one of the owners to sign a contract everyone was shocked and offended.\" He said that: \"We never had a war room – just a bunch of notes, and we'd go to a hotel room and make trades over a table. It was much easier.\"\nLater life.\nAfter his NFL career, Fitzgerald received a job as a salesman for NBC Radio Network. He then produced syndicated radio shows until retiring in the 1980s. While in the NFL, he became friends with trainer Bobby Brown who later introduced him to Floyd Reese; Reese and Fitzgerald became friends. When Reese became an executive with the Houston Oilers (later Tennessee Oilers / Titans), he gave Fitzgerald a role in 1991 as the person who announced the team's NFL Draft selections to league officials. He continued serving in this role with his son, Frank Jr., through at least 2010.\nFitzgerald died on October 20, 2014, at the age of 95. His son continued the practice of announcing the Titans' draft picks in 2015."

        "text": "Brian Smith (born 1979) is an American football coach and former player. He is the defensive coordinator and safeties coach at Rice University. He has also coached at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the University of Michigan, and in the NFL with the New York Jets and the Philadelphia Eagles.\nCoaching career.\nUMass.\nSmith began his coaching career at his alma mater, UMass as the outside linebackers coach in 2004. For the next two season, he moved to the offensive side, coaching the Minutemen wide receivers. Among the players he mentored was all-pro and pro bowl NFL receiver Victor Cruz.\nNew York Jets.\nPrior to the 2007 season, Smith began his eight-year tenure with the New York Jets of the National Football League. His first two seasons, while on Eric Mangini's staff, Smith served as an offensive quality control coach. In 2009, Smith was retained by newly hired head coach Rex Ryan, and moved to the defensive side of the ball as a defensive quality control coach. He worked with the Jets defensive backs for the next six seasons, including being promoted to assistant defensive backs coach for the 2014 and 2015 seasons. He mentored cornerback Dee Milliner, who won NFL defensive rookie of the month honors.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nFollowing Ryan's firing with the Jets, Smith moved on and joined Chip Kelly's Philadelphia Eagles staff as the assistant linebackers coach. Kelly was fired with two games left in the season, and Smith was again on the move.\nMichigan.\nIn 2016, Smith joined Jim Harbaugh's Michigan staff as the safeties coach, re-uniting him with Don Brown, who had recently been hired as the Wolverines defensive coordinator. Smith had both played for Brown when he was the defensive coordinator for the UMass Minutemen and coached with him when Brown was the head coach.\nIn Smith first season, he helped both of Michigan's starting safeties, Lano Hill and Dymonte Thomas, achieve All-Big Ten honors. Additionally, Smith helped coach a defense that led or ranked second in the NCAA in seven defensive categories, including pass defense, pass efficiency defense, first and third down conversions allowed and scoring defense. The Wolverines allowed 28 red zone trips all season, which was the fewest in the nation. Smith's defensive back group defended 68 passes, with 13 interceptions and three pick-sixes, including one from Hill and the unit allowed only 11 passing touchdowns all season. The defense led the Big Ten in eight categories and only allowed a 43.6% average completion percentage for opposing quarterbacks.\nRice.\nIn early December 2017, it was reported that Smith was leaving Michigan to become the defensive coordinator on Mike Bloomgren's inaugural Rice Owls football staff. The two had previously worked together for four seasons with the Jets, and Smith knew early on that he wanted to be a coordinator on Bloomgren's staff when the opportunity arose.\nSmith initially coached the Owls' safeties, in addition to his coordinating responsibilities, for two seasons. He then took over the linebackers room for the 2020 though 2022 seasons, before moving back to the safeties again. Smith's defenses have consistently been as good or better than any Rice defense in this century.\nPlaying career.\nSmith was a four-year letter winner and a three-year starter for the UMass Minutemen as a strong safety and cornerback. A team captain as a senior, he also earned All-Atlantic 10, All-New England, and All-ECAC honors for his play. In addition to his on-field prowess, Smith excelled in the classroom, earning academic all-conference honors three times. Smith was a starter on UMass's 1998 team that won the Division I-AA National Championship.\nPersonal life.\nOriginally from Wilmington, Delaware, Smith graduated cum laude with a degree in accounting."

        "title": "2024 Major League Baseball uniform controversy",
        "text": "Beginning in the 2024 season, Major League Baseball (MLB) adopted a new template for its uniforms, designed by Nike and produced by Fanatics, officially titled the Nike Vapor Premier. The new uniforms have been subject to much controversy and criticism. While some players have praised the new uniform's feel and mobility, other players and fans have complained that the jerseys are cheaply made.\nBackground.\nFrom 2005 to 2019, MLB uniforms were manufactured by Majestic Athletic, which was purchased by Fanatics in 2017. Nike and Fanatics began designing the new uniforms in 2018, with more than 300 players undergoing body scans to analyze how the players wore the jerseys. In 2020, Nike agreed to take over the MLB's uniform contract and Fanatics would instead oversee the distribution of merchandise to consumers. During the 2023 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Nike debuted the new Vapor Premier template.\nControversy.\nDesign.\nControversy arose surrounding the new pants designed for the uniforms, which were made of very thin and partially see-through fabric. The issue was brought to further attention after a photo of San Francisco Giants infielder Casey Schmitt modeling the uniform went viral due to the revealing nature of the tight pants. The translucency of the pants was also showcased when Shohei Ohtani posed for a photo, and his jersey tail could be seen through the pants. In a video posted by the Seattle Mariners of catcher Cal Raleigh, his jersey could clearly be seen tucked in through his pants. During a spring training game between the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers, a not-safe-for-work photo of an unnamed Padres player began to surface, revealing the player's \"sensitive areas\". During a St. Louis Cardinals spring training game, pitcher Miles Mikolas and other Cardinals players' jerseys appeared to be two distinctly different shades of gray.\nSupply.\nThe new uniforms have also been subject to supply shortages, with teams on occasion not receiving them during the season. Controversy arose after it was revealed that there was a shortage of pants and that Cincinnati Reds personnel would have to wear pants from previous seasons during the remainder of spring training. The Texas Rangers and Milwaukee Brewers were forced to push back the use of their City Connect uniforms from April 5 to April 26 because both teams had not received the uniforms from Fanatics. On April 29, New York Mets outfielder Brandon Nimmo admitted that the reason the Mets had not worn their standard blue or black jerseys a month into the season was that the team had not received the pants that coordinate with the jerseys.\nReactions.\nPlayers.\nSome players have defended the new jerseys because of their better fit and improved mobility. Baltimore Orioles catcher Adley Rutschman stated that the uniform would \"make a difference during those hot summer games when I'm in full gear\" and Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. stated that the jerseys, \"fit better and feel lighter\", in an MLB press release. Seattle Mariners pitcher Logan Gilbert praised the jerseys for their thinness and described them as \"feeling great\". MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred maintained that the jerseys would become popular and affirmed that the jerseys were designed by Nike and not Fanatics.\nOn the other hand, many players have criticized the jerseys for their appearance and quality. Upon reporting to spring training, one Baltimore Orioles player was reported to have compared the new jerseys to knockoffs from TJ Maxx. In an interview, Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Trea Turner said that \"everyone hates\" the new jerseys. Phillies pitcher Matt Strahm noted that the players' names were printed smaller on the back and the league should not try to \"fix what's not broken\". Los Angeles Angels outfielder Taylor Ward described the jerseys as looking like papery replicas that did not meet the standard for Major League uniforms. Boston Red Sox reliever Zack Kelly compared the numbers to iron-ons and publicly expressed his desire for the uniforms to be changed.\nFans.\nMany fans have expressed their outrage with the new uniforms, criticizing their cheap looks and the seemingly transparent pants. Fans have also displayed dismay over the changes to the font and overall quality of the new uniforms. One fan posted a screenshot of a photo from Michael Chavis' Instagram of his new jersey to X (formerly known as Twitter), to which the Fanatics customer support account responded. The now deleted reply stated, \"Hey there, it looks like we dropped the ball on this one\", before proceeding to request a direct message for more information. Some fans have drawn comparisons between the new uniforms and the \"Seinfeld\" episode \"The Chaperone\", in which George Costanza proposes to Yankees manager Buck Showalter that the team would perform better with new cotton uniforms. The controversy also added to ongoing concerns by National Hockey League fans that their jerseys may suffer from quality drops following Fanatics' ten-year jersey exclusivity deal starting with the 2024–25 NHL season.\nNike and Fanatics.\nIn response to input provided by teams, Nike stated that different options will be evaluated in an effort to \"lessen the moisture-related aesthetic color differences\". Michael Rubin, founder of Fanatics, expressed his belief that the issues with the uniforms are being unfairly blamed on Fanatics, going on to say, \"we're getting the shit kicked out of us\".\nAftermath.\nIn late April 2024, the Major League Baseball Players Association sent a memo to players stating that the uniforms would be overhauled, at the latest by the start of the 2025 season, hoping to rectify many of the complaints aimed at Nike's Vapor Premier template. These included a return to the larger name lettering, fixing the mismatched shades of grey for jerseys and pants, examining the Vapor Premier's \"propensity to collect sweat\", and a fix for the pants with a return to \"the higher quality zipper used in 2023\" and addressing their see-through nature. The MLBPA \"placed the blame on Nike\" and the Vapor Premier uniform, claiming \"Nike was innovating something that didn't need to be innovated\", while \"absolv[ing] Fanatics\"."

        "text": "The McGill Redbirds ice hockey team is an ice hockey team representing the McGill Redbirds and Martlets athletics program of McGill University. The team is a member of the Ontario University Athletics conference and compete in U Sports. The Redbirds play their home games at the McConnell Arena in Montreal, Quebec.\nHistory.\nIn 1873, James Creighton, along with several students from McGill, reportedly attempted to play a version of lacrosse on the Victoria Skating Rink. Shortly thereafter, Creighton drew up the first set of rules for \"ice hockey\". While its unknown if this story is true, what is known is that two years later, Creighton led two contingents of McGill students onto the Victoria Rink for the first indoor ice hockey game in history. The Montreal Gazette was on hand to report on the inaugural match with took place between two 9-man teams. Initially there was some fear for the safety of spectators as previous similar games had shown a tendency for a ball to fly about in a dangerous manner. However, fears were allayed when Creighton announced that a flat, wooden disk would be used instead. The matches were well received by the audience and within a few short years, McGill formed its first official team.\nIn what is believed to be another ice hockey first for McGill, the 1881 team posed for a team photograph and is the earliest existing image of a squad. Two years later the for ice hockey tournament was played at the Montreal Winter Carnival. McGill won the world's first ice hockey championship and received the Winter Carnival Cup, which is on display at the McCord Stewart Museum in Montreal. McGill would continue to participate in the tournament until the Carnival's discontinuation in 1889.\n1886 saw the first official ice hockey league formed when five teams from Montreal (including McGill) joined to start the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA). By the mid-1890s, ice hockey was beginning to spread south of the border and a barnstorming troupe of American college students from various universities took a trip through Canada the first international ice hockey game took place on February 23, 1894 and saw McGill defeat the American squad 14–1.\nJust after the start of the 20th century, McGill partnered with Queen's and Toronto to create the first collegiate conference in Canada. From then until the mid 1950's, McGill would play both college- and senior-level ice hockey, winning several championships along the way. In 1954, however, most Canadian schools switched entirely to college matches and McGill became an inaugural member of the Quebec-Ontario Athletic Association (QOAA). The team continued on with the conference until 1971 when the leagues were realigned along provincial borders and McGill joined the newly-created Quebec Universities Athletic Association. The league remained in place for the better part of two decades but, by the end of the 1980s, league membership had fallen to just four schools. In 1987, McGill, along with the other surviving programs, joined the Ontario Universities Athletics Association and have been an associate member ever since.\nThe upheaval during those years did not help McGill and the one lofty program had fallen on hard times. However, by the mid-90s, McGill began to recover its former strength and started posting good records. Postseason success eluded the Redmen until the 21st century and the team won its first conference championship in 2008. Several more titles followed and McGill was eventually able to capture a national championship in 2012.\nMoniker.\nBeginning in 1927, the McGill athletic teams were known as the 'Redmen'. While this was initially intended as a reference to the hair color of the school's founder, James McGill, the allusions to native peoples were unavoidable. Unofficially, the team was referred to as the 'Indians' during the 1950s and 60s while native iconography was included on jerseys up until it was forcibly removed in 1992. Despite the change in imagery, the name remained until a referendum by the student body overwhelmingly supported a change in the nickname. The athletic department went without an official moniker for its men's teams from April 2019 to November 2020 when 'Redbirds' was announced as the program's new name.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSenior and collegiate play.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\"\n&lt;br&gt;\nCollegiate only.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\"\nSee also.\nMcGill Martlets ice hockey"

        "text": "The Equestrian Portrait of Joachim Murat, King of Naples is an oil on canvas painting by the French neoclassical and pre-romantic painter Antoine-Jean Gros, created \"c.\" 1808-1812. It is held at the Louvre, in Paris. \nHistory.\nMarshal Joachim Murat had several equestrian portraits made of his likeness. Gros knew him well, having met in Milan during the first Italian campaign in 1796. Murat commissioned him the large painting \"The Battle of Aboukir\", which was exhibited at the Salon of French Artists of 1806, before being transferred to the Royal Palace of Naples, where Murat moved in the Summer of 1808, when he was made king of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\nThe current painting was shown at the Salon in Paris in 1812. Simultaneously with this portrait, Gros was commissioned to paint the \"Surrender of Capri\", but the project remained at the sketch stage after the fall and execution of Murat, in 1815.\nDescription.\nMurat is shown in a three-quarters view, riding a harnessed chestnut horse, in a seaside landscape. A tiger skin serves as a saddle cloth. A smoking volcano appears on the right in the distance and a column of smoke on the left.\nThe King of Naples prances in a colorful uniform where the red cord of the Legion of Honor is superimposed on the blue color of the royal order of Naples.\nThis portrait reflects the ambiguous position of Murat as king of Naples, since the Bourbons, who had been expelled from Naples, retained control of half of the kingdom, the island of Sicily, defended by the British fleet. Murat was only the head of state of a satellite kingdom of the French Empire, from which he would try to emancipate himself, while maintaining his loyalty to Napoleon.\nThe tiger skin placed on the purebred Arabian horse raising the dust of a desertic landscape recalls Murat's personal bravery during the Egyptian campaign; the silhouette of the Vesuvius, however, places the painting in the Bay of Naples. The cannonade at the sea on the left in the background certainly represents the attack on Capri, taken back from the British in October 1808. Commissioned from Gros in 1812, the portrait is also a history painting and a vector of political propaganda: it represents Murat as conqueror of his own kingdom, replaying the successful capture of Capri to better mark the failed capture of Sicily in the fall of 1810, due to lack of support from Napoleon.\nProvenance.\nThe portrait was acquired by donation by the Louvre Museum in 1973; it previously belonged to Prince Joachim Murat."

        "text": "The 2024 Esports World Cup (EWC) is the first edition of the Esports World Cup, an annual international esports tournament replacing Gamers8, run by the Esports World Cup Foundation. The event will take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from July 4 to August 24, 2024, and will feature 20 events in 19 different video games titles. It will have the largest prize pool in esports history at over .\nBackground.\nIn October 2023, Saudi Arabia announced the inaugural Esports World Cup as the successor of Gamers8, the Saudi Esports Federation's previously existing esports festival, set to take place in Riyadh. The event was developed as a part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, a plan led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman aimed at diversifying the country's economy and reducing reliance on oil.\nThe initial five game titles were announced on February 20, 2024, with a 19th event in \"Apex Legends\" added on April 12. The events will take place in a venue that features four separate esports arenas. The Esports World Cup will encompass 20 tournaments across its 19 competitive titles. Each tournament will adhere to its unique format and rules, contributing to a larger competition known as the Club Championship. For the Club Championship, each participating club can select the games they wish to compete in, and the club with the best overall performance across various game championships will be named the EWC Club Champion.\nResponse.\nThe announcement of the 2024 Esports World Cup was met with a mixed response due to concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record. Saudi Arabia's significant investment in the esports scene, amounting to billions of dollars, has led to a rapid expansion of the industry within the country. However, these developments have occurred against a backdrop of ongoing international scrutiny regarding Saudi Arabia's human rights record, particularly concerning LGBTQ+ rights, women's rights, and its handling of dissent.\nIn March 2024, esports organization Ex Oblivione announced their decision not to participate in the \"Overwatch 2\" competition at the 2024 Esports World Cup. The team expressed concerns about the lack of necessary accessibility for all members of their community and the potential exclusion of their fans from participating in the event alongside them. This decision received a mixed response from their followers and the community, with some expressing support for their stance while others criticized the organization.\nPrize pool.\nThe 2024 Esports World Cup will have a prize pool of over , the largest prize pool in esports history. The prize money will be broken down into four categories: Club Championship, Game Championships, Qualifiers, and MVP Awards. The Club Championship will award $20million to the top 16 teams based on their overall performance, while each of the 20 Game Championships will have a combined prize pool of over $33million. Teams will compete for more than $7million during qualifying events, and the MVP of each event will be awarded $50,000."
