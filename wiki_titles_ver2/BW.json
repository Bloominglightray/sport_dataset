        "text": "John Murray Anderson (born March 28, 1957) is a Canadian former ice hockey right winger. He was the head coach of the Chicago Wolves of the International Hockey League (IHL) and American Hockey League (AHL) from 1997 to 2008 ,again from 2013 to 2016. Anderson also serves as interim head coach for the Wolves in 2023. In the National Hockey League (NHL), he is a former head coach of the Atlanta Thrashers and assistant coach of the Phoenix Coyotes and Minnesota Wild. He played 12 seasons in the NHL for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Quebec Nordiques, and Hartford Whalers.\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, Anderson played in the 1969 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Wexford, Toronto. Anderson was the captain of his junior team, the Toronto Marlboros.\nAnderson was drafted in the first round, 11th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1977 NHL Entry Draft. He played 814 career NHL games, scoring 282 goals and 349 assists for 631 points from 1977–78 until 1988–89. Anderson was beginning to establish himself during his third season in Toronto when the club made a four-player trade with the Vancouver Canucks that brought winger Rick Vaive and centre Bill Derlago to Toronto. Anderson was paired with the two new acquisitions to form a high scoring line for the Maple Leafs. His best statistical season was the 1982–83 season, when he set career highs with 49 assists and 80 points. Following the 1984–85 season, the fourth year in a row that Anderson had scored 30-or-more goals for the Maple Leafs, he was traded to the Quebec Nordiques for defensemen Brad Maxwell.\nAnderson continued to be a valued goal scorer with Quebec and had scored 21 goals when he was traded to the Hartford Whalers. Anderson then ended the 1985–86 season in Hartford with 25 points in 14 games following the trade, finishing the season with 29 goals and 74 points before scoring another 13 points in ten playoff games. The following year, his first full year with Hartford, Whalers sniper Sylvain Turgeon battled injuries and Anderson filled in as the top left wing on the team. He hit the 30-goal plateau for the fifth and final time of his career finishing with 31 goals and 75 points, good for the third highest point total on the team. Anderson scored the winning goal against the New York Rangers on April 4, 1987, to give the Hartford Whalers their only division championship. He played two more years in Hartford before playing the last five seasons of his career in the minor leagues, primarily the International Hockey League, where he was a solid goal scorer.\nPost-playing career.\nAnderson coached the 1995–96 Winston-Salem Mammoths to the Southern Hockey League finals during the league's only season where they lost to the Huntsville Channel Cats. In 1996–97, Anderson coached the Quad City Mallards to their first Colonial Hockey League championship in the franchise's second season.\nIn 1997, Anderson was hired as the head coach of the Chicago Wolves in the International Hockey League (IHL) and later in the American Hockey League (AHL). He became the Wolves' all-time coaching leader in wins with 371 and for postseason victories with 80. Anderson led the Wolves in winning the Turner Cup and Calder Cup four times in his initial eleven seasons at the team's helm. His team was crowned league champions in 1998, 2000 in the IHL and 2002 and 2008 in the AHL. Anderson coached the American gold medal-winning team in the 2007 Jewish World Cup hockey tournament in Israel.\nOn June 20, 2008, Anderson was named as the fourth head coach of the Atlanta Thrashers. On October 10, 2008, Anderson won his first game as an NHL coach 7–4 against his good friend Bruce Boudreau's Washington Capitals. On April 14, 2010, Anderson was released as head coach of the Thrashers after two seasons.\nOn July 12, 2011, Anderson became an assistant coach for the Phoenix Coyotes. On July 10, 2013, Anderson was rehired as the head coach of the Chicago Wolves. After leaving the Wolves in 2016, he joined the Minnesota Wild as an assistant head coach until 2018. In February 2022, he agreed to join the Bakersfield Condors of the AHL as an assistant coach for the remainder of the 2021–22 season.\nFor his achievements with coaching the Wolves, he was named to the AHL Hall of Fame in 2019.\nAnderson also helped establish John Anderson's, a diner best known for its \"Banquet Burger\", as well as its $4 breakfast special. The original restaurant is located at Victoria Park Ave. and Van Horne Ave. in Toronto, Ontario."

        "text": "Robert E. Carpenter Jr. (born July 13, 1963) is an American former professional ice hockey center who was recently head coach of Kunlun Red Star of the Kontinental Hockey League. Prior to that he played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 18 seasons from 1981–82 until 1998–99. In his NHL career that spanned 18 years, Carpenter played 1,178 games, scoring 320 goals and 408 assists for 728 points. He has the distinction of being the second American-born hockey player to be selected in the first round of the NHL Entry Draft (Mike Ramsey was the first), and the first player to play in the NHL directly from high school after being drafted. Carpenter was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, but grew up in Peabody, Massachusetts.\nPlaying career.\nCarpenter was selected third overall in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft out of St. John's Preparatory School in Danvers, Massachusetts. In the February 23, 1981 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\", Carpenter was featured in a cover story that chronicled his potential. During his first tour with the Capitals, he would have his best statistical season during 1984-85 when he scored 53 goals and 42 assists and was the first US-born player to score 50 goals in a season. He was invited to play in the 1985 NHL All-Star game and he also participated in the 1984 and 1987 Canada Cup tournaments as a member of Team USA.\nPrimarily due to his clashes with head coach Bryan Murray, the Capitals traded Carpenter to the New York Rangers in the deal that sent Mike Ridley and Kelly Miller to Washington during the middle of the 1986–87 NHL season. Later in the season, he would be dealt again, to the Los Angeles Kings in the trade that sent Marcel Dionne to the Rangers. He finished the 1986–87 season with the United States team at the 1987 Ice Hockey World Championship tournament in Moscow after the Kings were eliminated in the first round of the 1987 Stanley Cup playoffs. Carpenter represented the US nationals for the final time in the 1987 Canada Cup.\nCarpenter was traded to the Boston Bruins during the 1988–89 NHL season, and a year later he would help guide the Bruins to the NHL Stanley Cup Finals. By this stage of his career, Carpenter was contributing more as a defensive-minded center than the high-scoring superstar whom he was once projected to be.\nCarpenter signed with the Capitals in 1992 and spent one season in his second tour with the team that originally drafted him. In 1993, he signed with the New Jersey Devils, where he would play for the final six seasons of his NHL career. It was during his time with the Devils that he would help the team win their first Stanley Cup in the lockout-shortened 1994–95 NHL season. After retirement, Carpenter stayed on as an assistant coach, winning two more cups with New Jersey in 2000 and 2003.\nPost-retirement.\nHe is currently the Director of Program Development for the Valley Jr. Warriors of the Eastern Junior Hockey League. His work for the Toronto Maple Leafs since the fall of 2009 consists of being a development coach for players from the time they were drafted into the organization until they turn professional, scouting US College and QMJHL hockey, and steering free agents Toronto's way.\nHe lives with his wife and has three children, all of whom participate in sports. His oldest child, his daughter Alex Carpenter, is on PWHL New York and won Olympic silver in 2014 with the United States women's national ice hockey team, in addition to five IIHF Women's World Championship gold medals. His son Robert III \"Bobo\" had a 2 year entry level contract with the New York Islanders as of 2019 and played two seasons for their AHL affiliate. He scored his first AHL goal in the third period of his first game. He now plays in the ECHL.\nIn 2016, Carpenter ran the Boston Marathon in three hours and 47 minutes, having taken up training for the event after leaving a job with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In 2017 he ran the event a second time, pushing Denna Laing, women's hockey player who was paralyzed in the 2016 Outdoor Women's Classic game, in a special racing wheelchair; they finished with a time of 4:32:30."

It was founded in 1856 by members of the long-disbanded Argonauts Club wishing to compete at Henley Royal Regatta.\nIt is regarded as one of the most successful rowing clubs in Britain and its patron was Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1856 at the instigation of Herbert Playford, A. A. Casamajor and Josias Nottidge for the purpose of promoting rowing on the river Thames and winning medals at Henley Royal Regatta. These three formed part of the crew that won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley in 1857. LRC is the second oldest of the non-academic type in London; the oldest is Poplar Blackwall and District Rowing Club having taken that status from Leander Club which gradually migrated from 1897 to 1961 to Henley on Thames in Oxfordshire.\nThe club and its members were fundamental in the setting up and evolution of the Metropolitan Regatta\nIt is one of the seven founding clubs of the Remenham Club at Henley and was one of five clubs which retained the right to appoint representatives directly to the Council of British Rowing. This right was removed from those five clubs in September 2012.\nModern day.\nPhelan Hill was the cox of the Rio Olympic Games in 2016 Gold Medal Open eight. Jess Eddie was in the Women's eight that won the Silver Medal at Rio Olympic Games in 2016\nSophie Hosking the Gold Medal winner and Rob Williams competed for Great Britain at the London Olympic Games in 2012 in the women's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nThe club won the Wyfolds in 2011 and also provided half of the oarsmen in the composite international lightweight crews that won the Club Quads in 2007. Most recently, they also won the Wyfold Challenge Cup again in 2023.\nTwo of its members, James Lindsay-Fynn and James Clarke, competed in the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 as part of the Lightweight Men's Coxless Fours. Nick Strange and Ben Helm competed in the Lightweight double sculls and Lightweight four at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996.

It occupies the space over the rowing tank that dated back to the 1920s, the old men's changing room and the old gym. The design specification required a low carbon footprint resulting in a modern passive ventilation system among other items. At the opening some of the membership commented that \"at least one can now close the holes in the walls\".\nMembers.\nFormer members of the club include the British racing driver Graham Hill, the Formula One World Champion in 1962 and 1968 and only driver to win the Triple Crown of Motorsport. From 1952 to 1954, Hill rowed in twenty finals with London, usually as stroke of the crew, eight of which resulted in wins. He also stroked the London eight for the highly ranked clubs/composites cup at Henley Royal Regatta. He used the colours of the club as his motor racing helmet design, as have his descendants, Formula One World Champion racing driver son, Damon, and Formula Renault driver Josh.\nCurrent club members include international rowers for Great Britain, Ireland and Germany, and include: \nThe former chief coach was Australian silver medallist Paul Reedy."

        "title": "Women's Cricket World Cup",
        "text": "The ICC Women's Cricket World Cup is the sport's oldest world championship, with the first tournament held in England in 1973. Matches are played as One Day Internationals (ODIs) over 50 overs per team (though the first five championships, from 1973 to 1993, were played at 60 overs per team). There is also another championship for Twenty20 International cricket, the ICC Women's T20 World Cup.\nThe World Cup is currently organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Until 2005, when the two organisations merged, it was administered by a separate body, the International Women's Cricket Council (IWCC). The first World Cup was held in England in 1973, two years before the inaugural men's tournament. The event's early years were marked by funding difficulties, which meant several teams had to decline invitations to compete and caused gaps of up to six years between tournaments. However, since 2005 World Cups have been hosted at regular four-year intervals.\nQualification for the World Cup is through the ICC Women's Championship and the World Cup Qualifier. The composition of the tournament is extremely conservative – no new teams have debuted in the tournament since 1997, and since 2000 the number of teams in the World Cup has been fixed at eight. However, in March 2021, the ICC revealed that the tournament would expand to 10 teams from the 2029 edition. The 1997 edition was contested by a record eleven teams, the most in a single tournament to date.\nThe twelve World Cups played to date have been held in five countries, with India and England having hosted the event three times. Australia is the most successful team, having won seven titles and failed to make the final on only three occasions. England (four titles) and New Zealand (one title) are the only other teams to have won the event, while India (twice) and the West Indies (once) have each reached the final without going on to win.\nHistory.\nFirst World Cup.\nWomen's international cricket was first played in 1934, when a party from England toured Australia and New Zealand. The first Test match was played on 28–31 December 1934, and was won by England. The first Test against New Zealand followed early the following year. These three nations remained the only Test playing teams in women's cricket until 1960, when South Africa played a number of matches against England. Limited overs cricket was first played by first-class teams in England in 1962. Nine years later, the first international one day match was played in men's cricket, when England took on Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nTalks began in 1971 about holding a World Cup for women's cricket, led by Jack Hayward. South Africa, under pressure from the world for their apartheid laws, were not invited to take part in the competition. Both of the other two Test playing nations, Australia and New Zealand were invited. Hayward had previously organised tours of the West Indies by England women, and it was from this region that the other two competing nations were drawn; Jamaica and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. To make up the numbers, England also fielded a \"Young England\" team, and an \"International XI\" was also included. Five South Africans were invited to play for the International XI as a means of compensation for the team not being invited, but these invitations were later withdrawn.\nThe inaugural tournament was held at a variety of venues across England in June and July 1973, two years before the first men's Cricket World Cup was played. The competition was played as a round-robin tournament, and the last scheduled match was England against Australia. Australia went into the game leading the table by a solitary point: they had won four matches and had one abandoned. England had also won four matches, but they had lost to New Zealand. As a result, the match also served as a de facto final for the competition. England won the match, held at Edgbaston, Birmingham by 92 runs to win the tournament.\nResults.\nFifteen teams have qualified for the Women's Cricket World Cup at least once (excluding qualification tournaments). Three teams have competed at every tournament, the same three sides who have won a title: England, Australia and New Zealand.\nDebutant teams.\n† ‡\nOverview.\nThe table below provides an overview of the performances of teams over past World Cups, as of the end of the 2022 tournament. Teams are sorted by best performance, then by appearances, total number of wins, total number of games, and alphabetical order respectively.\n† ‡"

In 2017, became an associate member.\nHistory.\nCricket has been played in Corfu since 1823 but remains a minor sport in Greece, with almost no media coverage around the country. Cricket was brought to Greece by the British who occupied the Ionian Islands for 50 years, leaving in 1864. Most of the players and coaches are Corfu Greeks, but there are also some Pakistanis and Afghanis playing, one max per club eleven in competitions. There are also some Australian Greeks from Melbourne who play. Greece came runners-up in the 2005 European Affiliates Championships that took place August of that year. However the Greek team was relegated to the fourth division in the European Championships, and banned from playing for a year, due to an alleged irregularity as one of the Melbourne Greeks had left behind his Greek passport (the decision was contested by the Hellenic Cricket Federation).\nIn early September 2012 the European Division 2 T20 Championships were held in Corfu.

Germany won the highest number of gold medals (11) and led in overall medals (29) for the third consecutive Games. Latvia and Slovakia won the first medals in their Winter Olympic history.\nSpeed skater Cindy Klassen of Canada won five medals (one gold, two silver and two bronze) and was the most medalled athlete at the Games. Biathlete Michael Greis of Germany and short track speed skaters Ahn Hyun Soo and Jin Sun-Yu, both of South Korea, tied for the most gold medals, with three each.\nChanges in medal standings.\nOne athlete was stripped of an Olympic medal during these Games. Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva won a silver medal in the 15 km race, but tested positive for carphedon and lost her medal. Germany's Martina Glagow was given the silver medal and fellow Russian Albina Akhatova (who was caught doping in 2009 and missed the 2010 Olympics) won the bronze.\nIOC retesting.\nThe IOC has retested nearly 500 doping samples that were collected at the 2006 Turin Games. In 2014, the Estonian Olympic Committee was notified by the IOC that a retested sample from cross-country skier Kristina Šmigun had tested positive. On 24 October 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency Athletes' Commission stated that Šmigun, who won two gold medals at the Turin Games, would face a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing before the end of October. In December 2017, IOC announced that re-analysis of samples resulted in no positive cases.\nMedal table.\nThe medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically."

Attackers do not need any technical skills in order to perform this method, and keen observation of victims' surroundings and the typing pattern is sufficient. In the early 1980s, shoulder surfing was practiced near public pay phones to steal calling card digits and make long-distance calls or sell them in the market for cheaper prices than the original purchaser paid. However, the advent of modern-day technologies like hidden cameras and secret microphones makes shoulder surfing easier and gives the attacker more scope to perform long-range shoulder surfing. A hidden camera allows the attacker to capture the whole login process and other confidential data of the victim, which ultimately could lead to financial loss or identity theft. Shoulder surfing is more likely to occur in crowded places because it is easier to observe the information without getting the victim's attention. \nThere are two types of shoulder-surfing attack: direct observation attacks, in which authentication information is obtained by a person who is directly monitoring the authentication sequence, and recording attacks, in which the authentication information is obtained by recording the authentication sequence for later analysis to open the device. Apart from threats to password or PIN entry, shoulder surfing also occurs in daily situations to uncover private content on handheld mobile devices; shoulder surfing visual content was found to leak sensitive information of the user and even private information about third parties.\nCountermeasures.\nGaze-based password entry.\nThe basic procedure for gaze-based password entry is similar to normal password entry, except that in place of typing a key or touching the screen, the user looks at each desired character or trigger region in sequence (same as eye typing). The approach can, therefore, be used both with character-based passwords by using an on-screen keyboard and with graphical password schemes as surveyed in. A variety of considerations is important for ensuring usability and security. Eye-tracking technology has progressed significantly since its origins in the early 1900s. State of the art eye trackers offers non-encumbering, remote video-based eye tracking with an accuracy of 1˚ of visual angle. Eye trackers are a specialized application of computer vision. A camera is used to monitor the user's eyes. One or more infrared light sources illuminate the user's face and produce a glint – a reflection of the light source on the cornea. As the user looks in different directions the pupil moves but the location of the glint on the cornea remains fixed. The relative motion and position of the center of the pupil and the glint are used to estimate the gaze vector, which is then mapped to coordinates on the screen plane.\nResearchers proposed ways to counter shoulder surfing on mobile devices by leveraging the front-facing camera for gaze-based password entry. For example, GazeTouchPIN and GazeTouchPass combine gaze input in the form of eye movements to the left/right, and touch input by tapping on-screen buttons. These methods are more secure than traditional touch-based input (e.g., PIN and Lock Patterns) because they require shoulder surfers to (1) observe the user's eyes, (2) observe the user's touch input, and (3) combine the observations.\nPainting album mechanism.\n\"Painting album mechanism\" is an anti-shoulder surfing mechanism, which has characteristics of both recall and recognition graphical techniques. Rather than using a regular PIN or password involving alphanumeric characters, users select a sequence of colors or pictures to unlock the system. The order of the colors and pictures selected during the sign-in process has to match with the order at the registration. This anti-shoulder surfing security method was developed based on survey results of users' affinity of choices, and through observation on the way children paint pictures. The resulting mechanism was developed from the survey of user choices, and the outcome created three input schemes, named Swipe Scheme, Colour Scheme, and Scot Scheme, which are the methods for password creation. Each input scheme is not identical, and it is up to the user to choose the input scheme they prefer. Swipe Scheme is implemented in Microsoft Windows 8, and in later versions, it is known as Picture Password; however, it has drawn criticism for requiring the user to use a secure enough gesture.\nSecret tap method.\nFor access to sensitive information with a low risk of shoulder surfing, the secret tap method is a technique that does not expose the authentication information during entry, even if other individuals try to view the input process. Additionally, the risk of camera recordings also poses a threat. Therefore, it is necessary to make the authentication process more complex in order to prevent authentication information from being stolen. For example, smartphones use biometrics such as fingerprint scanning or facial recognition which cannot be replicated by a shoulder surfer.\nThe secret tap authentication method can use icons or some other form of system. The goals of a secret tap system are:\nComparison of risks between alphanumeric and graphical passwords.\nThe primary benefit of graphical passwords compared to alphanumeric passwords is improved memorability. However, the potential detriment of this advantage is the increased risk of shoulder-surfing. Graphical passwords that use graphics or pictures such as PassFaces, Jiminy, VIP, Passpoints or a combination of graphics and audio such as AVAP are likely all subject to this increased risk unless somehow mitigated in implementation. The results indicate the fact that both alphanumeric and graphical password-based authentication mechanisms may have a significant vulnerability to shoulder-surfing unless certain precautions are taken. Despite the common belief that nondictionary passwords are the most secure type of password-based authentication, our results demonstrate that it is, in fact, the most vulnerable configuration to shoulder-surfing.\nPIN entry.\nPersonal identification number (or PIN for short) is used to authenticate oneself in various situations, while withdrawing or depositing money from an automatic teller machine, unlocking a phone, a door, a laptop or a PDA. Though this method of authentication is a two step verification process in some situations, it is vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks. An attacker can obtain the PIN either by directly looking over the victim's shoulder or by recording the whole login process. On items such as mobile phones with glass, glossy screens, the user could leave smudges on the screen, revealing a PIN. Some highly advanced attacks use thermal cameras to see the thermal signature of the PIN entered. Thermal attacks take advantage of heat fingerprints remaining on keys after the authenticating person is done entering the secret. So, various shoulder surfing resistant PIN entry methodologies are used to make the authentication process secure. Examples include PIN pads with built-in privacy shields. Another example used in ATMs and some entry systems is that of the use of metal PIN pads, making thermal camera attacks nearly impossible due to their material, shielding, reflectivity or internal heating. The transfer of heat through wiping with warm objects or hands is found effective to counter thermal attacks in experiments.\nCountermeasure testing.\nThe cognitive trapdoor game has three groups involved in it: a machine verifier, a human prover, and a human observer. The goal of each group is that a human prover has to input the PIN by answering the questions posed by the machine verifier while an observer attempts to shoulder surf the PIN. As the countermeasures are by design harder to easily usurp, it is not easy for the observer to remember the whole login process unless the observer has a recording device.\nVirtual reality.\nA user could wear a virtual reality headset to mitigate the issues of shoulder surfing; however, gesture controls, buttons pressed, and voice commands could still be attacked."

        "text": "John Leo Harrington (born July 12, 1936) is an American retired business manager and former executive in Major League Baseball (MLB). He was president of the Boston Red Sox from 1987 through 2001, also acting as CEO during much of the time the Red Sox were owned by the JRY Trust (1992–2001).\nEarly life and career.\nHarrington graduated from Boston College in 1957, and received his MBA there in 1966. After college, he was an officer in the U.S. Navy, then worked for both the General Accounting Office and NASA. He eventually became an accounting professor at Boston College until 1970, where he was hired by Joe Cronin, president of the American League, to be the league's controller.\nBoston Red Sox.\nAfter Cronin retired, Harrington was hired by Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey as treasurer of the Red Sox. Yawkey died in 1976 and was eventually replaced by his wife Jean, who sold the team in 1977 to a syndicate headed by general partners Buddy LeRoux and Haywood Sullivan. To gain approval of the sale by the American League, Mrs. Yawkey joined the ownership group in 1978 as its third general partner and club president. Harrington left the team to work for Governor Edward King of Massachusetts and then for a Lloyd's of London insurance affiliate. But he eventually returned to the Red Sox in the mid-1980s, during a period of strife between LeRoux and his partners, and became an important advisor to Mrs. Yawkey. Harrington also became the first non-owner to be the team's president, a position he held during 1987–2001.\nCEO.\nAfter Jean Yawkey's death in 1992, as trustee of the JRY Trust, Harrington arranged for the Trust to buy out the shares of Sullivan, the last remaining general partner. He completely overhauled the front office, bringing in general manager Dan Duquette from the Montreal Expos. Under Harrington's leadership the team compiled one of the best records in baseball; the team won the 1986 American League Championship Series; won the American League East division in 1986, 1988, 1990 and 1995; and won the Wild Card in 1998 and 1999.\nHarrington was instrumental in acquiring Pedro Martínez, Manny Ramírez, Jason Varitek, Tim Wakefield, Johnny Damon, Derek Lowe and other stars. Harrington built a new spring training facility in Fort Myers, Florida, and broadened the reach and popularity of Red Sox majority-owned New England Sports Network (NESN). He was responsible for bringing the All-Star Game to Fenway Park in 1999. He also played key roles within Major League Baseball. He was the lead negotiator for baseball owners during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, and led the development of both interleague play and the creation of the Wild Card playoff format.\nControversies.\nDuring Harrington's tenure, the Red Sox were also embroiled in several controversial episodes. In 1997, All-Star pitcher Roger Clemens acrimoniously left the team to sign as a free agent with the Toronto Blue Jays, where he won a fourth Cy Young Award.\nAlso in 1997, after infielder Wil Cordero was arrested on domestic assault charges, a half-dozen Red Sox front office members made a show of support on Cordero's behalf by appearing in court at his arraignment. Weeks later, Harrington initially refused to accept the terms of a negotiated settlement between the MLBPA players' union and the owners' Player Relations Committee to allow Cordero to return to the team. However, Harrington relented after the union threatened to file a grievance and owners' counsel advised him he was unlikely to prevail in court. Cordero's return drew criticism from women's rights advocates, and Cordero ultimately pleaded guilty to the charges after the season.\nIn December 1997, Harrington and the club faced charges of racial bias and harassment after a black former employee of the team claimed a framed photo of himself and his fiancee was defaced with a racial epithet. The following month, a civil rights advocate who offered to mediate a settlement for the club abandoned those efforts, accusing Harrington of rebuffing him and failing to deal in good faith. The case led to a hearing before the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) and was ultimately settled.\nBallpark.\nIn 1999, Harrington proposed the idea of moving the Red Sox into a new ballpark that was scheduled to be built adjacent to Fenway and even named \"New Fenway Park\", (similar to what would happen to Yankee Stadium in 2008). This idea was wildly controversial, as many Red Sox fans consider Fenway \"a national treasure\" of sorts. Harrington was quoted as saying that, \"It would be easier to fix the Leaning Tower of Pisa than Fenway\". The team set aside $415 million of $545 million allotted for the new ballpark, with the public financing the rest, estimated at $130 million. The baseball world had seen the closure of Tiger Stadium that same year, and many hoped Fenway would avoid the same fate. After much outcry from the public, the team was sold prior to the 2002 season to an ownership group, New England Sports Ventures, headed by John W. Henry, Tom Werner and Larry Lucchino, bringing a close to Harrington's time with the Red Sox.\nLater life.\nHarrington has been chairman of the Yawkey Foundation since 2007.\nHarrington was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2002, and the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame in 2019. In 2018, Boston College dedicated the Harrington Athletics Village at Brighton Fields, home of the college's softball and baseball fields, in his honor."

From 2012 through 2018, he managed the Norfolk Tides of the International League, Triple-A farm system affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles. His 2018 season with Norfolk was his 14th season as a Triple-A manager; Johnson formerly helmed the Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League (2005–09), and the Omaha Royals (1998) and Omaha Golden Spikes (1999) of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League.\nJohnson was a first baseman for the Kansas City Royals and Montreal Expos during his brief Major League Baseball (MLB) playing career from 1982 to 1984. He threw and batted right-handed, and was listed at tall and . Johnson was also a former first base coach of the Boston Red Sox of MLB in 2010 and 2011.\nPlaying career.\nJohnson was a native of Long Beach, California. When in high school, he turned down football scholarships to UCLA and Fresno State University, and instead chose to play baseball at Fresno State. Johnson was originally drafted by the California Angels in the 13th round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. He was named to the 1978 College Baseball All-America Team by the American Baseball Coaches Association. He graduated from Fresno State before being drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the 24th round, with the 595th overall pick, in the 1978 MLB draft. He made his major league debut with the Royals on September 12, 1982. On December 15, 1983, the Royals traded Johnson to the Montreal Expos for Tom Dixon.\nJohnson played in 22 major league games over parts of three seasons, batting .261 with 12 hits, including two doubles and two runs batted in. He played 830 games in the minor leagues, most of them at the Triple-A level.\nCoaching and managerial career.\nKansas City Royals.\nShortly after his playing days ended in 1985, Johnson became a coach in the Royals' minor league system. He served as a coach within the Kansas City organization for six seasons, before becoming a manager.\nJohnson made his managerial debut with the Baseball City Royals (Class A) of the Florida State League in 1992. He managed the Memphis Chicks for one season in 1994 leading them to a 75 win season. He won Texas League Manager of the Year honors in 1995, after guiding the Wichita Wranglers (Double-A) to the playoffs. Three years later, he reached Triple-A as manager of the Omaha Royals, and in 1999 he led that club to a first-place finish in the Pacific Coast League. In total, Johnson posted six winning seasons in his eight years managing in the Royals' organization.\nBoston Red Sox.\nJohnson joined the Boston Red Sox organization in 2000 as manager of the Sarasota Red Sox (Class A) of the Florida State League. In 2002, Johnson was promoted to Double-A as manager of the Trenton Thunder of the Eastern League. When the Red Sox switched Double-A affiliations to the Portland Sea Dogs in 2003, he moved with them and was manager of the Sea Dogs for the next two seasons. His 2003 club went 72–70 and missed the Eastern League playoffs by just a game and a half. In 2004, Johnson once again had Portland near .500 for much of the year before finishing at 69–73 and in a tie for 4th-place in the Eastern League Northern Division. From 2005 to 2009, Johnson served as manager for Boston's Triple-A affiliate, the Pawtucket Red Sox.\nOn November 23, 2009, Johnson was appointed as first base coach for the major league Red Sox. He held the post for two seasons, but on October 5, 2011, Johnson was fired from the Red Sox staff following the departure of manager Terry Francona.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nJohnson was next appointed manager of the Norfolk Tides, Triple-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles, and led them to back-to-back winning seasons in 2012 and 2013. In 2015, he managed the Tides to a division title and was named the International League Manager of the Year. The 2018 campaign marked his seventh consecutive year as Norfolk's manager, and he holds the franchise record for games won as a manager (491). During the year, Johnson was named the winner of the Orioles' Cal Ripken Sr. Player Development Award, but at the close of the season, he was released by the Baltimore organization as it underwent a significant front-office transition amid the departures of general manager Dan Duquette and manager Buck Showalter.\nJohnson's minor league managerial record was 1,752–1,770 (.497) over 25 seasons.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson and his wife, Daphne, had five children.\nHis son Chris was drafted in the 37th round by the Red Sox in June 2003 but instead opted for college; and was later drafted by the Houston Astros. Primarily a third baseman, Chris Johnson spent a dozen years in professional baseball, including all or parts of eight seasons (2009–16) in the majors with five teams. He had a breakout season in 2013 with the Atlanta Braves, finishing second in the National League batting race at .321. He also led the Braves in doubles (34) and finished second on the club in hits (165). Chris spent part of the 2017 season reunited with his father as a member of the Triple-A Tides in the Baltimore organization.\nJohnson took an emergency leave from his coaching duties with the Red Sox on August 1, 2010, after his youngest daughter was seriously injured when hit by a car while horse riding.

        "text": "Eric Simms (born 2 August 1945) is an Indigenous Australian former professional and national representative rugby league footballer who has been named among the nation's finest of the 20th century. His primary position was at although he could also play as a . Simms played his entire first grade career for South Sydney with whom he won four premierships and was top point-scorer for four consecutive seasons.\nIn August 2008, Simms was named at fullback in the \"Indigenous Team of the Century\". Simms set several records in his playing days, some which still stand. He was a notable goal-kicker (field, penalty and conversion) who once kicked five field goals in eleven minutes (in a match against Penrith in 1969). It has been said of Simms, and specifically his ability to kick field goals, that he's \"one of the few men whose influence was such it single-handedly changed the game\".\nEarly life and education.\nEric Simms was born in Karuah, New South Wales on 2 August 1945, the eldest son John (Jack) Simms, an Ullugundy Island man, who came to Karuah to live for a while before moving to La Perouse in Sydney. Eric's mother was born Gwendoline May Cook and became Gwendoline Ping when her own mother remarried. Eric and his sister, Beverley, grew up on the former Aboriginal reserve at Karuah, raised by his mother and stepfather, Fred Ridgeway, along with six other younger brothers and sisters. Simms had a total of thirteen siblings although some died at birth.\nEric attended Karuah Public School, and Raymond Terrace High School where \"he was taught the art of goalkicking by Les Leggatt, sportsmaster\".\nPlaying career.\nSimms moved to La Perouse where he played for La Perouse Panthers Junior Rugby League Football Club in the 1964 premiership-winning team. He was a 19-year-old truck driver when he was signed for South Sydney in 1965. He played in the centres for Souths’ grand finalist team which lost to St George (128) before a then record crowd of 78,056; Simms scored the last points in the game with a penalty goal.\nSimms went on to play 206 first grade games, including grand final winning teams in 1967, 1968, 1970 and 1971, scoring a total of 1,841 career points. In 1969, he broke the record for the most points scored in a premiership season with 265, previously held by Dave Brown of Eastern Suburbs. He held the record until broken by Mick Cronin over a decade later.\nIn 1973 he overtook Keith Barnes' record for the most points scored in an NSWRFL career (1,519); Simms' eventual total of 1,841 stood as the new career record for ten seasons until it was surpassed by Graham Eadie in 1983.\nClub records.\nSimms set and still holds a number of South Sydney club records:\nSimms is fifth place in the number of most first grade matches: John Sutton (309*), Nathan Merritt (218), Bob McCarthy (211), Craig Coleman (208), and Eric Simms (206).\nWorld Cups 1968, 1970.\nIn the 1968 Rugby League World Cup, Simms gained the distinction of becoming the fourth Aboriginal to represent Australia in rugby league. He scored 50 points in four games at the 1968 World Cup, a record which still stands today.\nHe played in the 1970 World Cup in England two years later and scored 37 points in total. The final, played at Leeds in November, 1970 has been described \"as the most savage international ever played\" and \"a running brawl\"; after the full-time whistle, with Australia having won, Simms offered a handshake to the English winger, John Atkinson, who responded by head-butting Simms.\nCoaching career.\nAfter the 1975 season, Simms moved to Crookwell, New South Wales, with his wife Sue and three children, Brendon, Kristie and Simone where he was captain-coach in 1976 until an arm injury (sustained in a tackle) forced his playing retirement at age 31. He coached Crookwell in 1977 and returned to Sydney where he coached the La Perouse team in 1978.\nGoal kicking prowess.\nSimms is regarded as one of the greatest goal kickers in Rugby League.\nRon Coote has said that Simms' kicking ability was a combination of talent and hard work: \"Eric would get to training and stand on the halfway line and Clive Churchill would stand under the posts ... . Eric would practise field goals from halfway one after the other for half an hour. Bang, bang, bang straight over. He hardly ever missed.\"\nSimms has said: \"Of course anyone can do it in training but it's harder when people are charging at you and the crowd is booing.\nOften I'd have to kick from weird angles under all sorts of pressure. Against Wests once I remember Mick Alchin coming around from the scrumbase to flatten me just as I took a shot. He hit me so hard that I went up in the air and came down flat on my back. But I was watching the ball go between the posts. I must have timed the kick just right.\"\nOf the field goal rule change, he has said: \"I never really believed the league changed the rule because of me ... . But over the years so many people told me I was the cause that there must be something to it.\"\nAwards and honours.\nIn 2001 he was named in the \"Indigenous Team of the Century\" at the \"Eric Simms Challenge - A Tribute to Indigenous Rugby League\", Redfern Oval, June 2001. The team was chosen by a panel chaired by then Senator Aden Ridgeway, a former South Sydney junior league player and then deputy leader of the Australian Democrats in the Australian Senate; other panel members were Ian Heads (rugby league journalist and historian), Frank Hyde, Roy Masters and David Middleton (a rugby league historian). The Eric Simms Challenge was described by the Rabbitohs' marketing manager as \"a salute to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island players, past and present\" and was a match between the NRL Rabbitohs team and a representative Aboriginal team, the Murdi Paaki Warriors, a development side from western New South Wales (\"from the Queensland border, across to Burren Junction in the east, to Gulargambone in the south-east, through to Bourke, Cobar, Ivanhoe and down to the Victorian border\").\nLife after league.\nIn 1977, Simms returned to the family home, Chifley Sydney where he started work on the wharves, an industry in which he has worked for more than 30 years. He worked at Port Botany where the demands of shift work put an end to his coaching days and his rugby league career. By 1997, he was a foreman for P&amp;O on the White Bay wharves at Port Sydney. In September 2008 he was living in a southern Sydney suburb and working at the Rozelle wharves.\nEric Simms married Charlene. They have two children. Simms has three children to first wife Sue."

In the bronze-medal match, France's Arnaud Di Pasquale defeated Switzerland's Roger Federer, 7–6(7–5), 6–7(7–9), 6–3. It was Russia's first medal in the event as an independent country (though Russian player Andrei Cherkasov had taken bronze as part of the Unified Team in 1992). France and Germany won their first medals in the event since 1924 and 1912, respectively.\nThe tournament was played at the Tennis Centre, Sydney Olympic Park, in Sydney, Australia. There were 64 players from 32 nations. Nations were able to enter up to four players each, up from three in prior Games.\nThe United States' Andre Agassi was the reigning gold medalist from 1996, but he did not participate.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th (medal) appearance of the men's singles tennis event. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. Demonstration events were held in 1968 and 1984.\nThe number one seed was Marat Safin of Russia, with Americans Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi (the defending champion) not playing in the Games. Two of the eight quarterfinalists from the 1996 tournament returned: bronze medalist Leander Paes of India and quarterfinal loser Wayne Ferreira of South Africa.\nBenin, Belarus, Bolivia, Costa Rica, and Thailand each made their debut in the event. France made its 10th appearance, most among all nations, having missed only the 1904 event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze-medal match. Matches before the final were best-of-three sets, with the final being best-of-five sets. The 12-point tie-breaker was used in any set, except the third (or the fifth in the final), that reached 6–6."

        "text": "John Stephen Bunting (born July 15, 1950) is an American former football coach and player. As a linebacker, he played college football at North Carolina and spent eleven years with the Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football League (NFL) from 1972 to 1982. He was the head coach at North Carolina from 2001 to 2006. He was inducted to the Greater Wilmington Sports Hall of Fame in 2016.\nPlaying career.\nBunting grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland and graduated from Springbrook High School in 1968. He was a starting linebacker for the University of North Carolina from 1969 to 1971 under Coach Bill Dooley. In 1971, Bunting earned All-Atlantic Coast Conference honors and helped lead the Tar Heels to their first outright ACC title, in 1971.\nHe had an eleven-year NFL career as a linebacker with the Philadelphia Eagles from 1972 to 1982, and he played in Philadelphia's Super Bowl XV game against the Oakland Raiders. Bunting then played for the Philadelphia Stars of the United States Football League from 1983 to 1984.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring as an NFL player, Bunting moved into the coaching ranks. He served as a defensive assistant for three NFL teams: Kansas City Chiefs, St. Louis Rams, and the New Orleans Saints. As the Rams' co-defensive coordinator (along with Peter Giunta), he played a key role in leading that team to their victory in Super Bowl XXXIV. From 1988 to 1992, he served as head coach at Rowan University (known as Glassboro State during his first three seasons), compiling a 38-14-2 record.\nIn December 2000, UNC athletic director Dick Baddour decided to hire him as the school's head football coach, replacing the fired Carl Torbush.\nIn his first season, Bunting led the Tar Heels to an 8-5 record and a victory over Auburn in the 2001 Peach Bowl. However, his teams since were highly inconsistent. Bunting compiled an overall record of 27 wins and 45 losses over six seasons, and notched only two winning records in ACC play. Bunting did manage UNC's first victories over a team ranked in the top 10 of a major media poll in school history. In his first game as head coach, the Tar Heels beat nine-time defending ACC champion Florida State 41-9; the Seminoles were ranked sixth in the AP Poll at the time. After the 2003 season, a season in which the Tar Heels did not appear in a bowl game, Bunting was a coach in the final Blue-Gray All-Star Classic. In 2004, the Tar Heels defeated Miami 31-28 on a last-second field goal by Connor Barth; the Hurricanes were ranked fourth at the time in the AP poll. On the other end of the spectrum, his 2005 team was routed 69-14 by Louisville, one of the worst losses in modern Tar Heel history.\nDuring his final season (2006), his team had a record of 3-9, while averaging over 23 fewer points per game than their opponents.\nBaddour fired Bunting on October 22, 2006, but allowed Bunting to finish out the season. His last home victory on November 18, 2006, against North Carolina State University, broke a seven-game losing streak, and he was able to close out his career one week later with a 45-44 win over the Duke Blue Devils.\nSince his split with North Carolina, Bunting has been working as a commentator and announcer for college football.\nPersonal life.\nBunting is married to Dawn Bunting and he has two children from his first marriage. They live in Naples, Florida."

        "text": "George William Wilson, Sr. (February 3, 1914 – November 23, 1978) was a professional football end and later a coach for the National Football League (NFL)'s Detroit Lions and the American Football League (AFL)'s Miami Dolphins. Wilson attended and played football at Northwestern University. He went undrafted in 1937, before being signed by the Chicago Bears. Wilson played for ten seasons with the Bears, compiling overall record of 111 pass receptions, 1,342 receiving yards, and fifteen touchdowns. He was a member of the Bears during their five appearances in the National Football League Championship Game from 1940–1943 and 1946. Additionally, he was selected for the NFL All-Star Game from 1940–1942. He also played one season of professional basketball for the Chicago Bruins in 1939–40. Wilson won seven championships combined as a player and coach.\nHis coaching career began with the Bears in 1947, when he became an assistant coach to George Halas. After just two seasons with Chicago, Wilson left in 1949 for another assistant coaching position with the Detroit Lions, a division rival of the Bears. Prior to the 1957 season, he succeeded Buddy Parker as head coach. In his first year as head coach, Wilson guided Detroit to an 8–4 season and victory in the 1957 NFL Championship Game, the most recent league championship for the Lions. For his efforts, Wilson was awarded the first Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year Award. He remained with the Lions until 1964, though they were unable to replicate their success of 1957. Wilson then served for one year as an assistant coach to the Washington Redskins in 1965. Shortly after the season ended, Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie hired Wilson as the first head coach of the new AFL franchise in 1966. His son, George Wilson Jr., was a starting quarterback during the team's first season. Wilson, Sr. was unable to obtain a winning record in his four seasons with Miami. He was fired in February 1970 and replaced by Don Shula.\nAfter being fired as head coach of the Miami Dolphins, Wilson retired from football and entered the construction and real estate business in South Florida. By 1978, he moved back to Michigan, where he died of a heart attack in Detroit on November 23, 1978.\nFootball.\nPlaying career.\nHe attended and played football at Saint Johns Northwestern Military Academy in Delafield, WI during high school as well as Northwestern University for college. Wilson was a member of the 1936 Wildcats team, which won the Big Ten Conference championship. After going undrafted in 1937, he was signed by the Chicago Bears later that year. Although Wilson participated in all eleven games of his rookie season, he started only two games. He recorded just one reception for 20 yards in 1937. The following season, Wilson recorded his first career touchdown. From 1940 to 1942, he was selected for the NFL All-Star Game, today known as the Pro Bowl, and was First-team in 1942. Wilson was a member of the Bears during their five appearances in the National Football League championship Game from 1940 to 1943 and in 1946, with the team winning in all but 1942. Listed as a starting right end for the 1940 NFL Championship Game, Wilson threw a tremendous block which took out two Redskin defenders as Bill Osmanski broke away for the Bears first score during their historic 73–0 rout of the Washington Redskins.\nDuring the 1943 season, Wilson recorded a career-high 293 yards receiving and 5 touchdowns. In the 1943 NFL Championship Game, Wilson caught three passes for 29 yards in the club's 41–21 defeat of the Redskins. He had similar regular season performances in 1944 and 1945. In the former, he caught 24 passes for 265 yards, including 4 touchdowns. In 1945, Wilson recorded a career-high 28 receptions, for 259 yards and 3 touchdowns. He retired as a player following the 1946 season, compiling an overall record of 111 pass receptions, 1,342 receiving yards, and 15 touchdowns.\nCoaching career.\nWilson began his coaching career with the Bears in 1947, when he became an assistant coach to George Halas. He spent just two seasons with Chicago, before taking an assistant coaching position in 1949 with the Detroit Lions, a division rival of the Bears. Before the 1957 season began, he succeeded Buddy Parker as head coach, who abruptly resigned on August 12. Wilson instituted an 11 p.m. curfew for his team while issuing $50 per hour fines for violators and doing bed checks at training camp. He described his manner as such: \"I joke around a lot, but there's only one way to play football and that is to beat down the other guy.\" The crackdown policy was modified to be tougher when the team had a middling run of preseason games, but it did not stop Wilson from having to bail out his quarterback Bobby Layne from an arrest on drunk driving in the middle of the night.\nIn his first year as head coach, Wilson guided Detroit to an 8–4 season and a 59–14 victory over the Cleveland Browns in the NFL championship game, still the most recent league title for the Lions. For his efforts, Wilson was the first recipient of the Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year Award. In January 1958, he also served as the Western Conference head coach for the first nationally televised Pro Bowl, while Parker, then head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, led the Eastern Conference. The Western Conference defeated the Eastern Conference by a score of 26–7.\nIn 1960, Wilson hired Don Shula as the defensive coordinator, who later succeeded him as head coach of the Miami Dolphins. The Lions were 7–5 in and advanced to the first edition of the third-place Playoff Bowl, where they defeated the Browns 17–16. Detroit's record was slightly better in 1961 at 8–5–1, went to the Playoff Bowl again, and soundly defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38–10. Despite finishing the 1962 season with 11 victories and 3 defeats – the best win–loss record during Wilson's tenure – they failed for the third consecutive season to edge the Green Bay Packers in the NFL Western Conference, but won a third straight Playoff Bowl, this time 17–10 over the Steelers.\nWilson remained with the Lions through 1964, though they were unable reach another NFL championship game after 1957. He resigned on December 23, two days after his five assistant coaches were fired by ownership, and was succeeded by former Lions player Harry Gilmer. Upon his resignation from the Lions, Wilson had compiled a record; only Wayne Fontes had more wins as head coach of Detroit. He then served for one year as an assistant coach under Bill McPeak with the Washington Redskins in .\nOn January 29, 1966, Joe Robbie named Wilson the first head coach of the American Football League's first expansion franchise, the Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins finished their first season with a record of 3–11, tying the 1961 Minnesota Vikings and the 1966 Atlanta Falcons for the then-best record for an expansion team. Of the four starting quarterbacks during the Dolphins' inaugural year, one was Wilson's son, George Wilson Jr., who led them to their first win, a 24–7 victory over the Denver Broncos. However, after a poor season performance, he was traded to the Broncos, then soon released on July 15, 1967.\nMiami improved slightly in 1967 and 1968, going 4–10 and 5–8–1, respectively. After the 1968 season, Wilson's three-year contract expired, leaving uncertainty if he would coach the team in 1969. Robbie stated \"George has done a good job with players. That is his strong point. That doesn't mean he's weak in other aspects, but he handles players well.\" Wilson was signed to a new one-year contract on December 18, 1968. In February 1969, Wilson promised \"continued improvement\" for the team at a luncheon honoring the new draftees, while Miami mayor Stephen P. Clark presented him a plaque for \"untiring efforts to bring Miami a championship football team.\" However, the Dolphins regressed to 3–10–1, worst in the AFL; Wilson was fired two months later on February 18, 1970, and was succeeded by Baltimore Colts' head coach Shula.\nAlthough Wilson's record with Miami was an unimpressive , several draft picks and trades during his tenure allowed the Dolphins to acquire players who were instrumental in the team's success in the early 1970s, including drafting Bob Griese and Larry Seiple in 1967, Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick in 1968, and Bill Stanfill and Mercury Morris in 1969, as well as trades for Nick Buoniconti and Larry Little in 1969 and Paul Warfield in 1970.\nWilson's career record as a head coach was , and was 2–0 in the postseason.\nInitially, Wilson was critical over his removal as head coach and replacement with Shula. Following the 1970 and 1971 seasons, he attempted to repudiate the public perception that Shula built a strong team, stating that \"As far as I'm concerned, he took over a ready-made team.\", before adding \"I was fired when the team was ready to go.\" In criticism directly aimed at Shula, Wilson remarked, \"I also helped him get the Baltimore Colts head coaching job (in 1963).

But I got him to take Shula.\" However, any tension between them faded after Wilson congratulated Shula following the Dolphins victory in Super Bowl VII and after he invited Shula for a round of golf at his newly purchased golf course in July 1973.\nIn 1980, Wilson was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. Among the other three inductees was Alex Karras, a former Lions player whom he coached.\nBasketball.\nPlaying career.\nA 6'1\" forward, Wilson played in the National Basketball League (a forerunner to the NBA) during the 1939–40 season. He averaged 1.1 points per game in 16 games for the Chicago Bruins.\nFilm career.\nWilson appeared as himself in \"Paper Lion\", a 1968 sports comedy film starring Alan Alda as writer George Plimpton, based on Plimpton's 1966 nonfiction book of the same title, depicting his tryout with the Detroit Lions. The movie premiered in Detroit on October 2, 1968, and was released nationwide the week of October 14, 1968.\nPersonal life.\nHe and his wife, Claire, had four daughters and one son, George Wilson Jr. After being fired from his coaching position at the Miami Dolphins, Wilson entered the construction and real estate industries and also operated a golf course near Miami. In 1978, Wilson moved back to Michigan and intended to eventually live in a house he built in Howell, but died before doing so. On November 23, 1978, Wilson Sr. suffered a heart attack and died at Sinai-Grace Hospital in Detroit at the age of 64."

        "title": "Sweden at the 2006 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Sweden sent 112 athletes to the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin trying to win their first gold medal since the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer. A total of 99 athletes were selected, and they competed in nine of the fifteen Winter Olympic sports. When the medals were summed up, Sweden had managed seven gold medals, two silver and five bronze, making it Sweden's best result ever in the Winter Olympics in terms of both medals and gold medals earned, and gave Sweden a 6th place in the medal table.\nSweden won gold medals in five different Winter Olympic sports, shattering the previous record of two.\nMedalists.\nThe following Swedish athletes won medals at the games:\nAlpine skiing.\n2004 and 2005 World Cup overall champion Anja Pärson won bronze medals in the women's combined and downhill, before claiming her first Olympic gold medal in the slalom. Anna Ottosson also earned a medal, winning the second run in the women's giant slalom to claim bronze.\nNote: In the men's combined, run 1 is the downhill, and runs 2 and 3 are the slalom. In the women's combined, run 1 and 2 are the slalom, and run 3 the downhill.\nBiathlon.\nAnna Carin Olofsson, who had switched from cross-country skiing to biathlon just four years earlier, became the first Swedish woman to win a gold medal in biathlon. Olofsson also won a silver in the sprint event. The men's relay team fell short of a medal in a photo finish, having greatly hurt their chances by missing 12 shots.\nCross-country skiing.\nA total of fifteen athletes – ten men and five women – were selected, making the cross-country squad the largest excluding the ice hockey teams.\nEmelie Öhrstig was the defending World Champion at the women's sprint event, but that was in classical style, and she failed to make the final in Turin. Björn Lind, leader of the men's cross-country World Cup in sprint, was more successful, winning the gold medal and then pairing with bronze medalist Thobias Fredriksson to win the team sprint event as well.\nThe women's sprint team of Lina Andersson and Anna Dahlberg joined their male counterparts in winning gold, while the men's 4 × 10 km relay claimed the only Swedish medal from a distance event, a bronze.\nCurling.\nIn the men's event, three-time World champion Peja Lindholm had a strong start, opening the tournament 3–0, including a win over eventual gold-medalists Canada, but fell off as the week continued, losing six consecutive games to finish out of the medal round.\nOn the women's side, Anette Norberg, the 2005 World champion, and a six-time European champion, led her team to the top spot in the round robin. The Swedes then survived a close game with Norway in the semifinal, winning with a single point in the final end. In the gold medal game, Norberg's rink had a comfortable lead, but saw Switzerland storm back to tie and force an extra end. In that extra, Norberg converted a difficult double takeout to win the gold medal.\nMen's.\nTeam: Peja Lindholm (skip), Tomas Nordin, Magnus Swartling, Peter Narup, Anders Kraupp (alternate)\nWomen's.\nKey: The hammer indicates which team had the last stone in the first end.\nFigure skating.\nKristoffer Berntsson, the lone Swedish figure skater in Turin, finished 23rd in the men's event.\nKey: CD = Compulsory Dance, FD = Free Dance, FS = Free Skate, OD = Original Dance, SP = Short Program\nFreestyle skiing.\nFour moguls skiers represented Sweden in the freestyle disciplines, with the best finish coming from Sara Kjellin in the women's event. Kjellin sat in bronze medal position with only a single skier to come, but that skier was eventual winner Jennifer Heil, leaving Kjellin just short of a medal.\nIce hockey.\nThe Swedish men's team suffered an early setback when it lost 5–0 to Russia, but wins over Kazakhstan, Latvia and the United States meant that the team was guaranteed a quarterfinal spot entering the final round-robin game with Slovakia. This game stirred up controversy, with head coach Bengt-Åke Gustafsson suggesting that the team might not play for a win, in order to set up a quarterfinal matchup with underdog Switzerland. Ultimately, the Swedes did lose the game, though the IIHF supervisor \"didn't see anything special\". The team then picked up comfortable wins in the medal round, beating the Swiss 5–2 and the Czech Republic 7–3, setting up a gold medal final with local rivals Finland. The Swedes fell behind after the first period, but a pair of goals in the second left the game tied going into the final 20 minutes. Nicklas Lidström then scored early in the third, giving the Swedes a 3–2 lead that would hold, and giving the country its first Olympic hockey title since 1994. Thousands of fans greeted the victorious team upon their return from Turin, with many of the NHL players stopping in Stockholm before returning to their club teams.\nThe women's team managed to advance to the medal round in the Olympic tournament, but an 8–1 loss to Canada only seemed to enhance the perception that women's hockey had few competitive teams. In the semifinals, the Swedes faced the United States, and fell behind 2–0 early in the second period. However, the Swedes then rallied, scoring twice to tie the game, and shut down the favoured Americans, forcing a shootout to decide the game. Swedish goaltender Kim Martin stopped four American shooters, while Pernilla Winberg and Maria Rooth scored for Sweden. This was the first game in which any team other than Canada had beaten the United States, and made Sweden the first team outside the top two to advance to a major final. The final was not as close, with Canada pulling out to a 4–0 lead by the halfway mark. Still, earning silver medal was a significant accomplishment for the Swedish women.\nSnowboarding.\nThirteen snowboarders represented Sweden across the three events, but only one, Maria Danielsson, earned a top-ten finish, which Danielsson did in the women's snowboard cross.\nNote: In the final, the single best score from two runs is used to determine the ranking. A bracketed score indicates a run that wasn't counted.\nKey: '+ Time' represents a deficit; the brackets indicate the results of each run.\nSpeed skating.\nIn the 1000 metres, Erik Zachrisson blocked Russia's Dmitry Dorofeyev, who was ahead of the pace of gold medalist Shani Davis at the time. Zachrisson ended up being disqualified."

        "title": "Nickelback (American football)",
        "text": "In American football, a nickelback is a cornerback or safety who serves as the additional defensive back in a nickel defense. A base defense consists of two cornerbacks and two safeties, making the nickelback the fifth defensive back on the field, thus tying the name of the position to the name of the North American 5-cent piece.\nUsually the nickelback will take the place of a linebacker, so if the team had been in a 4–3 formation, the four defensive linemen would remain, alongside only two linebackers and now-five defensive backs, creating a 4-2-5 formation. However, some teams will replace a lineman rather than a linebacker, creating a three linemen, three linebacker and five defensive back alignment, a 3–3–5 formation. If an offensive team always uses three or more wide receivers, a defense may turn to a nickel defense for their base package on most plays. Usually extra defensive backs, such as a nickelback, are substituted into the defense in situations where the opposing offense is likely to attempt a forward pass, such as 3rd-and-long, or when extra receivers are substituted into the opposing offense.\nThe nickelback is the third cornerback or safety on the depth chart. The nickelback is generally not considered a starting position because the starting formations for most defenses are either a 3-4 or a 4-3, in which only two cornerbacks and two safeties are utilized. Defensive formations with three or more cornerbacks (or three safeties) are used often enough that a nickelback will usually see moderate playing time (particularly in the modern, pass-oriented NFL) as well as subbing in for the starting corners. In certain packages (or if injuries depleted the depth chart), smaller free safeties or strong safeties can fill the spot of nickelback, as well. Their role may become that of a pass rusher from outside the box.\nIn Canadian football or CFL, where five defensive backs are considered the norm, the position is known as a defensive halfback."

The Azerbaijani delegation consisted of two athletes, an ice dancing team of American-born Kristin Fraser and Russian-born Igor Lukanin. They finished the competition in 19th place. As of the conclusion of these Olympics, Azerbaijan has never won a Winter Olympics medal.\nBackground.\nThe National Olympic Committee of the Azerbaijani Republic was created in 1992 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 1 January 1993. Azerbaijan has sent delegations to every Olympics since the 1996 Summer Olympics, first entering the Winter Olympics in Nagano in 1998. While the nation has won many medals in the Summer Olympics, they have never won a medal in the Winter Olympics.

Teymur Jafarov, an assistant of the National Olympic Committee, carried the flag for the closing ceremony.\nFigure skating.\nKristin Frasier is from in Montclair, New Jersey, while Igor Lukanin was born in Yekaterinburg, Russia. They had previously, as a team, represented Azerbaijan at the 2002 Winter Olympics. At the time of the Turin Olympics, Frasier was 25 years old, and Lukanin was 30 years old. The ice dancing event took place over three phases, each held on a separate days. There were 24 teams taking part in the competition. On 17 February, in the compulsory dance, the Azerbaijanis scored 27.27 points. Two nights later, they scored 43.83 points in the original dance, while the following evening they scored 77.14 points in the free dance. Their combined score of 148.24 points put the Azerbajiani team in 19th place.\nKey: CD = Compulsory Dance, FD = Free Dance, OD = Original Dance"

        "text": "Robert William Brown (born April 10, 1968) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger. \nHe is best known for his time spent playing for the Pittsburgh Penguins from his debut in 1987 until 1990, and then again from 1997 until 2000. Between and following these stints, Brown shuffled between minor league teams in the International Hockey League (IHL) and other NHL teams, including the Hartford Whalers, Chicago Blackhawks, Dallas Stars, and Los Angeles Kings.\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, he played in the 1981 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Oshawa.\nBrown was a prolific scorer at the junior level, averaging over two points per game during his junior career. In particular, Brown flourished in 1986-87 winning multiple awards including Most Valuable Player (West), Top Scorer (West), and the inaugural WHL Plus-Minus Award. Brown also set the current Western Hockey League records for both assists and points with 136 and 212 respectively. He was also named CHL Player of the Year for the 1986-87 season. Brown won a gold medal as a member of Team Canada at the 1988 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\nBrown was drafted 67th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. His best statistical NHL season was the 1988–89 season, when he played on a line with Mario Lemieux; placing fifth in league scoring, he set career highs with 49 goals, 66 assists, 115 points, 24 power play goals, 6 game-winning goals, and a +27 plus/minus rating. He was also the starting right winger for the 40th National Hockey League All-Star Game. The next season, he scored at a point-per-game average, registering 80 points in 80 games. Brown was traded on December 21, 1990 to the Hartford Whalers for Scott Young. In parts of two seasons, Brown had 73 points in 86 games for the Whalers before being traded on January 24, 1992 to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for Steve Konroyd. Brown finished the 1991-92 season playing 25 games for Chicago registering 16 points. In 1992-93, Brown split time with the Chicago Blackhawks and their minor league team the Indianapolis Ice. During the next few years, Brown would sign contracts with the Dallas Stars and Los Angeles Kings, but mostly played in the IHL. Brown led the IHL in scoring for three years and was awarded the James Gatschene Memorial Trophy for league MVP in 1993-94. His scoring production at the IHL level did not go unnoticed and on October 1, 1997 Brown returned to the Pittsburgh Penguins, signing a contract as a free agent. Brown played the next three seasons there, playing a total of 190 games while contributing 87 points. Brown then returned to the minors, ending his career with the Chicago Wolves of the AHL in 2003.\nBrown served as a colour commentator for the Edmonton Oilers pay-per-view, and currently is an analyst on 630 CHED for Edmonton Oilers games. He also became a hockey instructor with the St. Albert Sports Academy, St. Francis Xavier Hockey Academy, and NAX Hockey Academy.\nPersonal life.\nBrown was born in Kingston, Ontario, but grew up in St. Albert, Alberta. \nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Rugby (UK Parliament constituency)",
        "text": "Rugby is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since its 2010 recreation by Mark Pawsey, a Conservative.\nHistory.\n1885–1918: The Petty Sessional Divisions of Rugby, Southam, Burton Dassett and Kingston, and Kenilworth (except the parishes of Lillington and Milverton).\n1918–1945: The Rural Districts of Farnborough, Monks Kirby, Rugby and Southam, the Rural District of Brailes (except the parishes of Ilmington and Stretton-on-Fosse), the parishes of Charlcote, Combrook, Compton Verney, Eatington, Kineton, Loxley, Moreton Morrell, Newbold Pacey, Wellesbourne Hastings and Wellesbourne Mountford in the Rural District of Stratford-on-Avon, and the Urban District of Rugby.\n1945–1950:\n1950–1974: The Municipal Borough of Rugby and the Rural District of Rugby.\n1974–1983: The borough of Rugby and the rural district of Rugby as altered by The West Midlands Order 1965 and The Coventry Order 1965.\n2010-: The Borough of Nuneaton and Bedworth ward of Bulkington, and the Borough of Rugby wards of Admirals, Avon and Swift, Benn, Bilton, Brownsover North, Brownsover South, Caldecott, Earl Craven and Wolston, Eastlands, Fosse, Hillmorton, Lawford and King's Newnham, New Bilton, Newbold, Overslade, Paddox, and Wolvey.\nBetween 1950 and 1979, Rugby was a consistent Labour-Conservative marginal, often bucking the national swing (for example, William Price held the seat for Labour with an increased majority in 1970 while the Wilson government was defeated). Since its recreation in 2010, the seat has produced solid Conservative majorities.\nBoundaries.\nWhen first created in 1885, the Rugby division consisted of the Petty Sessional Divisions of Rugby, Southam, Burton Dassett and Kington, and Kenilworth except the parishes of Lillington and Milverton. The division as recommended by the Boundary Commissioners had a population of 49,291 in the 1881 Census.\nBoundary changes in 1918 expanded the constituency to the south, while removing some areas near Leamington Spa. The constituency was defined as consisting of the Urban District of Rugby, the Rural Districts of Farnborough, Monks Kirby, Rugby and Southam, together with the majority of Brailes Rural district (excepting only the two parishes of Ilmington and Stretton-on-Fosse which were in a detached part of Warwickshire). Finally, the division included several parishes which were in the east of Stratford-on-Avon Rural District: Charlcote, Combrook, Compton Verney, Eatington, Kineton, Loxley, Moreton Morrell, Newbold Pacey, Wellesbourne Hastings and Wellesbourne Mountford.\nWhen changes were made to constituency boundaries in 1945 to split up some extremely large constituencies, Rugby was affected by the recommendations made as a result of the growth in electorate in the Coventry constituency. It gained some areas to the east of Coventry which had already been added to Rugby Rural District but were previously part of Nuneaton division. This change added about 2,000 voters. The constituency was considerably reduced in area in boundary changes which came into effect in 1950, being reduced to simply the Municipal Borough of Rugby and the Rural District of Rugby. No alteration in boundaries was made as part of the First Periodical Review of Boundaries in 1954, and in the Second Periodical Review which came into effect in 1974, the definition remained the same although changes in local government boundaries meant that a minor change was made.\nThe Third Periodical Review of constituency boundaries expanded the Rugby constituency to the west. The constituency lost 6,545 of its 60,909 electors, in and around the villages of Ansty and Wolvey, to Nuneaton. It then gained 16,600 electors from Kenilworth, resulting in its renaming as Rugby and Kenilworth.\nParliament accepted the Boundary Commission's Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies which slightly altered this constituency for the 2010 general election since which it has electoral wards:\nProposed.\nFurther to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, enacted by the Parliamentary Constituencies Order 2023, from the next general election, due by January 2025, the constituency will be composed of the following (as they existed on 1 December 2020):\n\"Very small changes to align boundaries with those of wards in the Borough of Rugby.\"\nConstituency profile.\nThe constituency consists of Census Output Areas of two local government districts with similar characteristics and that forming the bulk has a working population whose income is slightly above to the national average and lower than average reliance upon social housing. At the end of 2012 the unemployment rate in the constituency stood as 2.3% of the population claiming jobseekers allowance, compared to the regional average of 4.4%.\nThe borough contributing to the bulk of the seat has a quite low 17.5% of its population without a car, 19.6% of the population without qualifications contrasted with a high 28.2% with level 4 qualifications or above by way of illustration. In terms of tenure 69.5% of homes are owned outright or on a mortgage as at the 2011 census across the district.\nElections.\nElections in the 1940s.\nGeneral Election 1939–40:\nAnother general election was required to take place before the end of 1940. The political parties had been making preparations for an election to take place from 1939 and by the end of this year, the following candidates had been selected; \nReferences.\nCraig, F. W. S.

        "text": "Joseph Lawrence Roth (May 29, 1955 – February 19, 1977) was a college football player and All-American quarterback for the California Golden Bears. Roth played the 1976 season knowing he was dying of melanoma; he died in February 1977, three months after his last regular season game and just weeks after playing an all-star game in Japan. His jersey, number 12, is the only one ever retired by the California Golden Bears football program.\nBiography.\nA 1973 graduate of Granite Hills High School in El Cajon, Roth led Grossmont College of El Cajon to an undefeated season and state title in 1974, and transferred to the University of California, Berkeley in 1975.\nOriginally a back-up, he started the fourth game of the 1975 season, and led the Golden Bears to the Pac-8 title as co-champions. Cal led the nation in total offense, gaining the same yardage both passing and rushing with 2,522 yards each.\nIn 1976, Roth was a pre-season favorite for the Heisman Trophy. The season was more tumultuous, and towards the end of the year Roth's performance started to drop, but he was named an All-American and finished ninth in the Heisman Trophy voting.\nAfter the season ended, he revealed that halfway through it he had been diagnosed with terminal melanomaapparently the metastasis of a mole removed from his face several years earlier. Despite his deteriorating physical condition, he honored his commitments to play in both the Hula Bowl and the Japan Bowl.\nAccording to a friend's reminiscence, during the Japan Bowl festivities Roth had agreed to sit for a thirty-minute autograph session; but finding, at the end of the scheduled time, hundreds of children still waiting, he continued to sign until every child had an autograph, after which he left the building and vomited. \nBy mid-February he was in the hospital, where (in the words of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\")\nRoth died at age 21 on February 19, 1977.\nHonors.\nNFL commissioner Pete Rozelle opened the 1977 NFL Draft in early May with a moment of silence for Roth.\nPosthumously, Roth received the Berkeley Citation in 1977, awarded to those \"whose attainments significantly exceed the standards of excellence in their fields and whose contributions to UC Berkeley are manifestly above and beyond the call of duty.\" In 2000, he was inducted into the University of California Athletic Hall of Fame.\nSeveral awards are named for him, including the Joe Roth Award, for the high school player in the San Diego area who best demonstrates courage; the Joe Roth Memorial Award, given to the San Diego County junior college football player who best exemplifies high academic standards and athletic excellence; the Joe Roth Memorial Award, which was given as the MVP award for the Japan Bowl; and the Joe Roth Award, given to the Cal football player who best demonstrates courage, attitude, and sportsmanship.\nCal football designates each year's home game against either USC or UCLA as the Joe Roth Memorial Game. Cal wore throwback uniforms similar to those the Bears wore during Roth's career for the 2007 Roth Memorial Game and will continue to do so, starting in 2017. The Bears also occasionally wear Roth-era road throwbacks when playing at USC and UCLA.\nA documentary, \"Don't Quit: The Joe Roth Story\", was released in 2015."

        "text": "Cricket fighting is a hobby and gambling activity involving the fighting of male crickets. Unlike blood sports such as bullfighting and cockfighting, cricket fighting rarely causes injuries to the animals. It is a popular pastime in China and dates back more than 1,000 years to the Tang dynasty. However, the sport has been losing its popularity in China.\nHistory.\nCricket fighting was nurtured by Tang dynasty emperors more than 1,000 years ago, and later popularized by commoners. In the thirteenth century, the Southern Song dynasty prime minister Jia Sidao wrote a how-to guide for the blood sport. Jia's obsession with cricket fighting is believed to have contributed to the fall of the empire. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) China's Communist government banned cricket fighting as a bourgeois predilection, but it is now undergoing a revival among a younger generation eager to embrace traditional Chinese pastimes.\nCulture.\nCricket season begins in summer and championships take place after the autumn equinox in late September. In Beijing, the Association for Cricket Fighting organizes cricket fighting events and championships.\nWhile it is illegal in China to gamble on cricket fights, the fights themselves are legal and occur in most big cities in China. Crickets are sold openly in street markets, with more than a dozen cricket markets in Shanghai alone. In 2010 more than 400 million yuan (US$63 million) were spent in China on crickets.\nHotels in Macau have held cricket fights where bets up to thousands of patacas were waged on a single fight. Prized crickets have become famous, with funeral services on their death.\nIn Hong Kong, the popularity of cricket fighting has declined since the 1950s and 60s, partly due to pesticides reducing the supply of fighters. In 2004, a champion cricket could cost more than $2,500. Lesser fighters could be bought from bird stalls for up to $30, or searched for in rural areas.\nCare and breeding.\nThe best crickets are from a few counties in northeastern Shandong Province. Crickets have pedigrees and would be carefully bred by knowledgeable keepers. Each cricket must be kept in its own clay pot and their diets include ground shrimp, red beans, goat liver, and maggots. Before fight night, female crickets are dropped in the pot to increase the male's fighting spirit.\nFlight and anger.\nCrickets fights are arranged according to weight class. In a fighting container, handlers stimulate their cricket's antennae using a straw stick, causing the crickets to become aggressive. When both crickets are sufficiently agitated, a divider separating the pair will be lifted, and the two crickets will begin the match. The loser is the cricket that first begins avoiding contact, runs away from battle, stops chirping, or is thrown from the fighting container.\nStudies done indicate that the sense of \"flying\" encourages a cricket's fighting spirit. In one such study, a losing cricket put back into the ring will only go back to fight one out of ten times. If crickets are shaken and thrown in the air repeatedly, they will fight again six out of ten times.\nTournaments.\nThe Yu Sheng Cup, another national cricket fighting tournament, is held annually outside the Xilai Ranch in Lühua during the National Day holiday in early October, with a purse of ."

In his first final appearance in 1904 he lost in three straight sets to compatriot Holcombe Ward.

        "text": "Thomas Malone (born March 29, 1984) is a former American football punter. He was signed by the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent in 2006. He played college football at Southern California. He is the cousin of NFL Punter Robert Malone.\nMalone has also been a member of the New England Patriots, New York Sentinels, Seattle Seahawks, Sacramento Mountain Lions, and St. Louis Rams.\nEarly years.\nMalone went to Temescal Canyon High School. After beginning his football career at wide receiver he became a punter after discovering that he could kick the ball far better. After looking at USC, Stanford and Washington, he chose USC. He graduated a semester early and enrolled at USC in the spring of 2002.\nCollege career.\nMalone entered the 2002 season as USC's first true freshman starting punter in ten years, playing all 13 games and averaging 42.1 yards on his 62 punts. He made the All-Freshman Team in several publications. In the 2003 season, the sophomore again appeared in all 13 games, averaging 49.0 yards (breaking the previous USC record) on his 42 punts. Malone earned first-team All-American honors from ESPN.com, SI.com and Collegefootballnews.com, becoming USC's first-ever All-American punter. Malone was a lead contender for the national punting title, but because of USC's very efficient offense that year he was five punts shy of having the NCAA-required minimum 3.6 punts per game to be listed—his 49.0 average was 1.0 yards above the national leader.\nGoing into his junior season, Malone had become a fan favorite due to the novelty of having an All-American punter at a school that dominated offensively. A USC fan began a humorous and well-meaning \"Malone4Heisman\" campaign that received attention from both his teammates (including that year's actual Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart) and major sports media outlets. It was this campaign that dubbed Malone \"the Bomb\".\nDuring the 2004 season, Malone again appeared in all 13 games, he averaging 43.8 yards on 49 punts. He ranked ninth nationally in punting (43.8, first in Pac-10) and was a semifinalist for the 2004 Ray Guy Award. His performance at the 2005 FedEx Orange Bowl earned him a place on CBS Sportsline.com's All-Bowl Team.\nIn the summer before his senior season, Malone injured his right hip during workouts which limited his ability to practice during the season. During his final season, the USC offense performed better than it had in his previous seasons: averaged 50 points a game and only allowing Malone 30 punts in 12 games, lower than any previous season. USC did not punt during his final home game, a 66-19 offensive explosion against rival-UCLA. Despite the step backwards, Malone took things well saying, \"From a team standpoint, this could not have gone better. It's the most fun you could ever imagine. From a personal standpoint, it's been a little frustrating.\" He graduated from USC in 2006 with a degree in political science.\nProfessional career.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nMalone was signed by the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent on May 5, 2006, but was waived by the team on July 9, 2006.\nNew England Patriots.\nThe New England Patriots signed Malone to their practice squad on December 20, 2006. When former USC teammate Mario Danelo died in January 2007, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick gave him a week off and paid to send him to the funeral. He was re-signed to a future contract on January 23, 2007, but was waived on August 22, 2007. He was then signed to the Patriots' practice squad on September 10, 2008, waived from it on September 15, 2008, and re-signed to the team's practice squad on November 26, 2008. He was waived on May 5, 2009, but re-signed on June 1, 2009. He was waived again on August 1, 2009.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nMalone was signed by the Seattle Seahawks on February 13, 2010. He was waived on April 28, 2010."

        "text": "The 1994–95 UEFA Champions League was the 40th edition of UEFA's premier European club football tournament, and the third since its rebranding as the UEFA Champions League. The tournament was won by Ajax of the Netherlands with a late goal in the final against defending champions AC Milan of Italy. Ajax won the competition without losing a game, either in the group or the knock-out stage, clinching the title for the first time since 1973.\nCompared to the previous edition of the European Cup, radical changes were made to the format of the tournament, due to a recently expired contract that bound UEFA to the EBU for the transmission of the final. This gave occasion for a general review of the format, which attracted the interest of new and financially well-off private television companies. This edition included four groups of four teams each in the group stage, up from two groups of four teams each in 1993–94. It was also the first year in which eight teams advanced to the knock-out stage and the first of three years in which the champions of smaller nations entered the UEFA Cup instead of the Champions League. It was also the first time that this competition was known as the UEFA Champions League from the first to the last match of the competition: in two previous seasons, the UEFA Champions League involved the matches played between the second round and the European Cup final.\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia's entrants were unable to participate for the third season in a row due to the UN economic sanctions. Milan were the defending champions, but were defeated by Ajax in the final.\nTeams.\n24 teams entered the competition: the UEFA Champions League holders, Milan, who also won their domestic league, as well as the 23 best-ranked national champions according to UEFA club ranking. The title holders and the other 7 best-ranked national champions received a bye to the group stage, while the national champions ranked 9–24 entered in the qualifying round. The remaining national champions were only allowed to participate in UEFA Cup.\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows. The draw was held in Geneva, Switzerland on 20 July 1994, where qualifying round pairs as well as group formations were drawn. The knockout phase pairs were made automatically by a predetermined bracket.\nQualifying round.\n!colspan=\"5\"|Group A\n!colspan=\"5\"|Group B\n!colspan=\"5\"|Group C\n!colspan=\"5\"|Group D\nGroup stage.\nTen of the sixteen participating teams made their UEFA Champions League group stage debut: AEK Athens, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Casino Salzburg, Dynamo Kyiv, Hajduk Split, Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Steaua București. Two of these teams, Benfica and Dynamo Kyiv, had previously contested the 1991–92 European Cup group stage. Casino Salzburg, Hajduk Split, Manchester United and Steaua București were the first teams to qualify for group stage from Austria, Croatia, England and Romania respectively.\nIt was also the last edition of the Champions League that saw teams in the group stage awarded two points for each win, with one point awarded for each draw.\nKnockout stage.\nSemi-finals.\n "

The victory gave Agassi the fourth of five components of the career Golden Slam; his later win at the French Open made him the first man to complete the career Golden Slam in singles. It was the United States' first gold medal in the event since 1924 and its third overall, equaling Great Britain's record. It was Spain's second consecutive silver medal. In the bronze medal match, India's Leander Paes defeated Brazil's Fernando Meligeni, 3–6, 6–2, 6–4. It was India's first Olympic tennis medal.\nThe tournament was held at the Stone Mountain Tennis Center in Atlanta, Georgia, of the United States of America. There were 64 competitors from 36 nations. Nations had been limited to three players each since the return of tennis to the Olympic program in 1988.\nSwitzerland's Marc Rosset was the reigning gold medalist from 1992, but he retired from his third round match against Renzo Furlan.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th (medal) appearance of the men's singles tennis event. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. Demonstration events were held in 1968 and 1984.\nThe number one seed was Andre Agassi of the United States. Two of the eight quarterfinalists from the 1992 tournament returned: gold medalist Marc Rosset of Switzerland and bronze medalist Goran Ivanišević of Croatia.\nArmenia, the Czech Republic, Ecuador, Slovakia, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela each made their debut in the event. France made its ninth appearance, most among all nations, having missed only the 1904 event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament, but with some significant changes from 1988 and 1992. A bronze medal match was held, unlike the previous two Games. Matches before the final were reduced to best-of-three sets instead of best-of-five sets. The 12-point tie-breaker continued be used in any set, except the third (or the fifth in the final), that reached 6–6."

The Andorran delegation consisted of three competitors, two in alpine skiing and one in cross-country skiing. Roger Vidosa provided Andorra's best performance at these Games, with a 27th-place finish in the men's slalom alpine skiing event. As of these Games, Andorra has never won an Olympic medal.\nBackground.\nThe Andorran Olympic Committee was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1974. They first participated in Olympic competition at the 1976 Winter Olympics and have taken part in every Summer and Winter Olympics since. Coming into 2006, Andorra had never won a medal in either the Summer or Winter Olympics. The Andorran delegation to Turin consisted of three competitors: alpine skiers Roger Vidosa and Alex Antor, and cross-country skier François Soulié. Antor was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony, while a ceremony volunteer carried the flag for the closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nAlex Antor was 26 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics, and had previously represented Andorra at the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics. Roger Vidosa was 21 at the time of these Games, and would later go on to represent the nation at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. On 12 February both competitors took part in the men's downhill; Antor finished in a time of 1 minute and 55 seconds, which placed him 39th, and Vidosa completed the course in a time of 1 minute and 59 seconds, good for 50th place, out of 53 skiers to finish the race. The gold medal winning time was 1 minute and 48 seconds, put up by France's Antoine Dénériaz.\nOn 14 February, both men participated in the three-run combined event. Antor finished the downhill portion in a time of 1 minute and 43 seconds, but failed to finish the first of the two slalom runs and was eliminated from the competition. Vidosa finished the downhill run in 1 minute and 46 seconds, and the two slalom runs in 48 seconds and 47 seconds respectively. This meant his overall time was 3 minutes and 21 seconds for the three runs, which put him into 28th place, behind Ted Ligety's gold medal time of 3 minutes and 9 seconds.\nAntor took part in the super-G on 18 February, but failed to finish the race. On 25 February both men skied the two-run slalom. Antor failed to finish the first run, while Vidosa finished it in a time of 59.8 seconds. He would improve his time in the afternoon, completing his second run in 54.1 seconds. Vidosa's total time of 1 minute and 54 seconds placed him 27th, behind Benjamin Raich's gold medal winning time of 1 minute and 43 seconds.\nNote: In the men's combined, run 1 is the downhill, and runs 2 and 3 are the slalom.\nCross-country skiing.\nFrançois Soulié was 27 years old at the time of these Olympics, and would represent Andorra again four years later in Vancouver. On 12 February, he took part in the 30 km pursuit event, which consisted of 15 kilometers of classical style immediately followed by 15 kilometers of freestyle racing, with a timed pit stop in between to change skis. Soulié finished the first 15 km in a time of 45 minute and 19 seconds, but was unable to finish the rest of the race. Five days later, he finished the Men's 15 km classical in a time of 44 minutes and 42 seconds, ranking him 71st out of 96 classified finishers.

        "text": "Rugby is played in Cardiff in both rugby league and rugby union forms.\nCardiff RFC and the Arms Park.\nBetween 2003 and 2009 there were two rugby union teams based at Cardiff Arms Park. The Cardiff Blues represented the region in the Celtic League and Heineken Cup, whereas Cardiff RFC represented the city in the Welsh Premier Division. From the start of the 2009–10 season, the Cardiff Blues relocated to the Cardiff City Stadium in the Leckwith area of the city. In May 2012 the Blues relocated back to the Arms Park. Cardiff Blues were renamed to \"Cardiff Rugby\" for the 2021–22 season.\nRugby Union Clubs in Cardiff.\nCardiff has around 23 clubs playing in the WRU national league system. As well as Cardiff RFC, playing in the Welsh Premiership, National Championship side Glamorgan Wanderers RFC play in the Ely area and are a well established first class club having been part of the old Merit Table structure.\nOther WRU affiliated clubs in the Cardiff area are:\nCardiff Metropolitan University RFC,\nRhiwbina RFC,\nFairwater RFC, Old Illtydians RFC, Llandaff North RFC, Rumney RFC, \nCardiff HSOB RFC, St. Peters RFC\nLlandaff RFC,\nCanton RFC,\nWhitchurch RFC,\nLlanrumney RFC,\nTongwynlais RFC, \nPentyrch RFC, \nCaerau Ely RFC,\nLlanishen RFC,\nCathays RFC,\nSt. Josephs RFC, Cardiff Saracens RFC,\nSt. Albans RFC and .\nCardiff University RFC though affiliated, do not play in the WRU league structure and instead compete in the BUCS Leagues for university sides. The side compete in the annual Welsh Varsity Match against Swansea University RFC, the biggest varsity game outside of Oxford – Cambridge in the UK.The match is the highlight of the university sporting year and is played at alternating high-profile venues including, Liberty Stadium in Swansea, Cardiff Arms Park and the Millennium Stadium. The university's Medical School runs its own separate team, Cardiff Medicals RFC which competes in separate competitions and in 2015 are the current UK Medical School Rugby Champions. Former players include current Welsh international Jamie Roberts.\nCIACS.\nAnother side, Cardiff Internationals Athletic Club normally shortened to CIACS (pronounced \"kayaks\") were formed in the docks area of the city, known as Tiger Bay in 1946. CIACS has always reflected the multicultural nature of the docks area, hence the name Cardiff Internationals. The club is best known for having produced Billy Boston, who went on to become a rugby league footballer in the 1950s. The club represents the Grangetown, Cardiff Bay, Butetown and the Docks areas.\nThere are many other recreational non-affiliated sides playing in the city, including Cardiff Bus RFC, players being employees of the local transport authority.\nCardiff Demons.\nRugby league in Cardiff was represented by the successful men's Cardiff Demons RLFC side, a team that produced a handful of Super League players including Elliot Kear and Lloyd White as well as many other Welsh internationals in its short existence. They played at four grounds in and around the Cardiff area. Having previously been at Taffs Well RFC, Old Penarthians RFC, and St. Albans RFC, they finally settled at the St Peters RFC ground in the East of Cardiff. Past players include current Welsh Rugby Union internationals Gethin Jenkins and Andy Powell. The club's finest achievements came through getting through to the fourth round of the Challenge Cup in 2000, bowing out to Keighley Cougars and as winners of the Rugby League Conference National Shield in 2004, beating South Yorkshire side Moorends-Thorne Marauders in the final a competition for amateur clubs based outside the traditional 'heartland' of the sport.\nIn 2021, the 'Demons' name was resurrected for a new women's side, managed by Wales Rugby League to compete in the RFL Women's Super League South Western Conference, along with The Golden Ferns and Cornish Rebels. Demons won the inaugural title by defeating Eastern Conference Winners Army Rugby League 30–26 in the grand final, with a winning score in the last play of the match.\nCardiff City Rugby League.\nIn 2014, it was decided that the two open Rugby League sides in the city, Cardiff Demons and Cardiff Spartans would merge to form a new club, Cardiff City RLFC. The two clubs, both previously playing their open age sides in the Welsh Conference, would run two open age sides in the 2015 season, playing home games at Cardiff Arms Park, as well as develop the junior sides based at Llandaf North and Rumney. For 2017, Cardiff Blue Dragons Rugby League has entered into a partnership with Glamorgan Wanderers to play at The Memorial Ground. Cardiff Blue Dragons RLFC is now the largest Rugby League club in Wales with age grades up to senior sides for both male and female players. The men's team continues to play in the South Wales Premier.\nCardiff Metropolitan University Rugby League.\nCardiff Metropolitan University/UWIC RLFC were consistently one of the best university sides in Great Britain having won the national title twice in the early part of this century. They have produced a number of players for Cardiff Demons and the successful Wales Students side. The side will resume playing in the BUCS Leagues in 2016.\nThe University of South Wales, which has a campus in Cardiff, also fields Rugby Union and Rugby League sides usually playing at the University Sport Park in Treforest.\nIn 2023, Cardiff University established a men's Rugby League team playing in the Midlands and West 1 RFL division.\nCardiff's rugby league history.\nThe first attempt to bring rugby league to the capital was in 1949 when a Welsh League was formed. Cardiff were joined by teams from Amman Valley, Llanelli, Aberavon, Bridgend, Ystradgynlais, Neath and Pontarddulais.\nCardiff were champions of the first competition in 1949–50 but were denied a double after Ystradgynlais beat them in the Final. Llanelli were winners of the competition the year after but that didn't stop Cardiff being elected to the Rugby Football League Championship in 1951.\nThe League at the time consisted of 31 clubs in one division who each played a 36-game season. Cardiff finished 30th with a record of 5 wins and 31 defeats – only Liverpool City were below them.\nWith that the club and Welsh Rugby League at club level, was wound up for 30 years.\nIn 1981, Cardiff City Blue Dragons were formed and played out of Ninian Park, Cardiff under the management of David Watkins. The club enjoyed reasonable success and attracted high-profile Rugby Union converts such as Steve Fenwick, Tommy David, Brynmor Williams and Paul Ringer. In 1984 the club was moved to Bridgend where it lasted one more season before folding.\nThe success of Wales at international level in the 1990s led to the formation of South Wales. Coached by Clive Griffiths and managed by Mike Nicholas, the team played at Morfa Stadium, Swansea, Aberavon RFC's Talbot Athletic Ground and at Cardiff Arms Park.\nHowever, the club only lasted one season in Rugby League's debut summer season of 1996. Finishing fifth in Division Two, the club had high hopes that it would be awarded a Super League franchise and although a strong case was put forward by Nicholas and Griffiths the Super League clubs refused to award it a place for the coming season and the club was wound up but the Cardiff Demons under-21 academy side were formed the year after. This side lasted for four seasons and were then replaced by an open-age side who played in the Rugby League Conference.\nDuring 2014, the two main Rugby League clubs in Cardiff, Cardiff Demons and Cardiff Spartans, voluntarily merged to create a new club, Cardiff City RLFC. The kit and badge created for the new side pay homage to the Blue Dragons side of the early 1980s. For the 2017 season, Cardiff ARLFC play their home games at Glamorgan Wanderers RUFC (Memorial Ground), in the Ely suburb of the city. The club also runs a successful age grade set up, at U13, 15s and 17s, as well as Masters and Women's Rugby League. training on Tuesdays and Thursdays."

        "text": "John Joseph Barry (April 26, 1887 – April 23, 1961) was an American shortstop, second baseman, and manager in Major League Baseball, and later a college baseball coach. From through , Barry played for the Philadelphia Athletics (1908–1915) and Boston Red Sox (1915–1919).\nPhiladelphia Athletics.\nBorn in Meriden, Connecticut, Barry spent his nearly entire tenure in the big leagues on winning teams, first the Philadelphia Athletics and later the Boston Red Sox. Athletics manager Connie Mack signed Barry off the campus of the College of the Holy Cross to play shortstop on what would become his famous $100,000 infield. The unit, one of the most famous groups of teammates in baseball history, consisted of first baseman Stuffy McInnis, second baseman Eddie Collins, and third baseman Frank Baker. The group was critical to the Athletics winning the American League pennant in 1910, 1911, 1913 and 1914, and World Championships in 1910, 1911, and 1913.\nBoston Red Sox.\nIn 1915, the year after the Boston Braves swept the Athletics in the World Series, Red Sox owner Joe Lannin paid $8,000 for Barry's services, as Mack was dismantling the team. Upon joining the Red Sox, he hit just .262 but played reliable defense at shortstop, proving to be the last piece of the puzzle in what was to be another pennant-winning team. He played in the World Series in 1915 and 1916 for the Red Sox. Acknowledged as the team's on-field leader, he became a player-manager in 1917, leading the team to a 90-win season and a second-place finish to the Chicago White Sox. In the war year of 1917, manager Jack Barry chose to enlist and on October 18, 1917, Jack and four other Red Sox players, who had enlisted as yeomen in the naval reserve, were called to active duty and ordered to report for duty on November 3, 1917. He served all of 1918 in the military. After poor play in 1919, he decided to retire rather than be sold away in another fire sale following Harry Frazee's decision to sell his shortstop back to the Athletics.\nIn an 11-season career, Barry posted a .243 batting average with 10 home runs and 429 RBI in 1223 games.\nHoly Cross.\nBarry became the head coach at Holy Cross in 1921, and continued in that position for 40 years until his death in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts at age 73. During his tenure, he posted the highest career winning percentage (.806) in collegiate history, and won the 1952 College World Series. He was among the initial class of inductees to the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in . In 2007, he was an inaugural veteran inductee of the College Baseball Hall of Fame along with Lou Gehrig, Christy Mathewson, and Joe Sewell. In 1943 he became Holy Cross' acting athletic following the death of Tom McCabe and remained in that role until Gene Flynn returned from the United States Army in 1946."

        "text": "Certified and recognized cycling records are those verified by the Union Cycliste Internationale, International Human Powered Vehicle Association and World Human Powered Vehicle Association, Guinness World Records, International Olympic Committee, World UltraCycling Association (formerly Ultra Marathon Cycling Association), the UK Road Records Association or other accepted authorities.\nMost records have been completed under special rules and circumstances, such as being motor-paced, on terrain advantageous for speed (such as downhill or low-friction surfaces), or using highly aerodynamic cycles (for example, recumbent bicycles). As cycling is a diverse activity with vast differences between equipment, disciplines, and terrain, there is no one record that can popularly be considered a benchmark for “fastest cyclist”. The hour record is generally considered the most prestigious, due to its long history and standardization of rules.\nSpeed record on a bicycle.\nThe table below shows the records people have attained while riding bicycles.\nHistory of unpaced records.\nThe International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA) acts as the sanctioning body for new records in human-powered land, water, and air vehicles. It registers non-motor-paced records (also called unpaced), which means that the bicycle directly faces the wind without any motor-pacing vehicle in front.\nOn land, the speed record registered by a rider on a 200-meter flying start speed trial was by the Canadian Sam Whittingham riding the Varna Tempest, a streamliner recumbent bicycle in 2009, at Battle Mountain, Nevada. His record has been surpassed by 0.5 km/h by Sebastiaan Bowier of the Netherlands in 2013 setting the new record of . The record was again surpassed on 19 September 2015 by Todd Reichert by riding the ETA, a streamlined recumbent bicycle at from the team behind the AeroVelo Atlas human-powered helicopter. Todd Reichert broke his own record again on September 17, 2016, to set a speed of at the 2016 WHPSC.\nThe female record holder for this same category was Lisa Vetterlein, who reached in 2005. This record was beaten by Barbara Buatois of France, when she reached at Battle Mountain in 2009. She subsequently achieved at the 2010 running of the Battle Mountain event. This record was beaten on 13 sept 2019 by Ilona Peltier of France, at at the 2019 WHPSC event.\nHistory of motor-paced records.\nMotor pacing is a type of cycling record where a pace vehicle is modified by adding a tail fairing to keep the wind off the cyclist who is riding behind it. This type of record was invented by Charles \"Mile-a-Minute Murphy\" who drafted a train to set a record in 1899. A mile of plywood sheets was attached to the railroad ties, so Charles would have a smooth surface riding behind the train.\nIn 1928, Leon Vanderstuyft from Belgium reached 122 km/h riding behind a motorbike at a velodrome. Alexis Blanc-Garin from France set the record to 128.20 km/h in October 1933 riding behind a motorbike. Albert Marquet, from France, reached 139.90 km/h riding behind a car in 1937. On 22 October 1938, Alfred Letourneur reached 147 km/h at a velodrome in Montlhéry, France, riding behind a motorbike. On 17 May 1941 Letourneur broke the record again, reaching on a Schwinn bicycle riding behind a specially equipped midget racer, on a Los Angeles freeway near Bakersfield, California.\nThe first to surpass 200 km/h was the Frenchman Jose Meiffret in 1962, when he reached behind a Mercedes-Benz 300SL car on a German motorway.\nAllan Abbott, a cycling enthusiast and motorcycle racer, elevated the motor-paced bicycle speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats, reaching in 1973. John Howard, Olympic cyclist and Ironman triathlon winner, reset the record to , also at the Bonneville Salt Flats, on 20 July 1985.\nFred Rompelberg from Maastricht, Netherlands was the holder of the motor-paced speed world record cycling with from 1995 to 2018. He used a special bicycle behind a dragster of the Strasburg Drag Racing Team at the Bonneville Salt Flats.\nDenise Mueller-Korenek claimed a women's bicycle land speed record at at the Bonneville Salt Flats on 10 September 2016. Mueller was coached by former record holder John Howard. On 17 September 2018, again at Bonneville, she took the outright world record, riding a special KHS bike with a 62Tx12T gear (488 gear-inches) to a new overall record top speed of 183. behind a converted rail dragster with a fairing.\nHistory of downhill records.\nDuring the last decade of the 20th century, two Frenchmen, Éric Barone and Christian Taillefer, set the speed record descending on snow several times. On 28 March 2015, Éric Barone reached at Vars ski resort, France, besting his own record from 2000, using a specially designed prototype bicycle. In 2017 Barone achieved a new downhill record on snow reaching 227.72 km/h using a prototype bicycle.\nUsing a serial production bicycle, as opposed to prototype bicycles, the record holder is Markus Stöckl from Austria. He set a world speed record in 1999 on snow, descending at at Les Arcs. On 14 September 2007, Stöckl rode an Intense M6 mountainbike down the ski slope of La Parva, Chile, reaching the current record of .\nThe top descending speeds have always been obtained on snow. Apart from that, the ashes of a volcano have been the other surface used. In November 2001, Éric Barone descended on the Cerro Negro volcano in Nicaragua at , beating his previous record achieved in Hawaii in 1999. Barone believed he could do more, and returned to the same location on 12 May 2002 when he reached on a serial production bicycle and , on a prototype bicycle, a world record. Markus Stöckl did beat the serial production bicycle record in 2011 when he reached on a volcano in Nicaragua and again in 2017 when he reached down a volcano in Chile. The prototype bicycle record, on a volcano, still belongs to Barone.\nHour records.\nThe hour record for bicycles is the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour on a bicycle. The most famous type of record is for upright bicycles meeting the requirements of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). Hour-record attempts are made in a velodrome, frequently at high elevation for the aerodynamic benefit of thinner air. Between 1997 and 2014 the UCI retrospectively restricted hour record competitors to roughly the same equipment as was used by Eddy Merckx in his 1972 record. In 2014, the UCI changed the hour record rules to permit using any upright bike allowed for endurance track events. However, other retrospective changes to hour record regulations are why the current hour records are not the farthest absolute distance.\nThe UCI hour records are:\nAnother type of record registered by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA) and the World Human Powered Vehicle Association (WHPVA) is for human-powered machines, typically fully streamlined recumbent bicycles. These feature a lower frontal area than a UCI bicycle due to their recumbent seating design of the rider. They enclose the rider and machine in aerodynamic shapes made of carbon fiber, Kevlar, or fiberglass to reduce air resistance. A further type of record is for partially streamlined recumbents, which are open but have either a windshield in front or a streamlined tail-box in the rear. This is registered by the World Recumbent Racing Association (WRRA).\n24 Hours record.\nPlease note that some records are made with at least one of the following beneficial factors: streamlined bicycles, being part of a 4x4 relay team, being in other aerodynamically favorable conditions such as behind trucks, special support teams, supplements etc. Different race locations (including elevation), weather conditions, etc. all do come into play. \nLong-distance records.\nPembroke to Great Yarmouth.\nPembroke to Great Yarmouth is the traversal of the whole width of the island of Wales and England between two extremities; Starting in Pembroke in the West and finishing in Great Yarmouth in the East. The record is also known as the Side to Side record. The distance by road using the traditional route is and the records are maintained by the Road Records Association. Some of its current records are:\nLand's End to John O'Groats.\nLand's End to John O'Groats is the traversal of the whole length of the island of Great Britain between two extremities; in the southwest and northeast. The distance by road using the traditional route is and the records are maintained by the Road Records Association. Some of its current records are:\nReturn journey between Land's End and John O'Groats.\nBen Rockett claimed to have set a record of 141h 8m 0s for an upright bicycle from Land's End to John O'Groats to Land's End, being the return journey of Land's End to John O'Groats. The distance by road using the traditional route is . The precise route he took is not clear as his website says the distance ridden was . Its status as a record however was dubious as no recognised authority certified the record.\nIn September 2017 James MacDonald set a Guinness world record, starting and finishing at John O'Groats. Guinness certified the record as covering in 5 days 18 hours and 3 minutes, beating Rockett's time by 3 hours and 5 minutes.\nOn 3 September 2020, Marcia Roberts became the first female to record the journey starting at Lands End, by bike, in a time of 11 days, 13 hours &amp; 13 minutes and set a Guinness World Record. On 16 July 2023, Louise Harris successfully completed the return journey in 10 days 5 hours, breaking the original record by over 1 day 8 hours.\nOne Thousand miles.\nOn 13 March 1940 Pat Hawkins set the 'World 1,000 mile record' in Perth, having ridden the distance in 4 days, 8 hours and 7 minutes, cutting 9 hours 53 minutes off Vera Unthank's record.\nUltra Marathon.\nRace Across America, an ultra marathon bicycle race across the United States that started in 1982. The fastest average speed records are:\nSeven days.\nOn Sunday 17 March 1940 Pat Hawkins, an 18-year-old female from Western Australia, set the 'World Seven Days record' in Perth, having ridden to surpass the previous best () set by Mrs Valda Unthank of Hastings, Victoria. Hawkins also broke the West Australian records for one, two, three, four, five, six and seven days, plus surpassing the Australian professional men's record of Ossie Nicholson. No authority appears to maintain this record, however notable distances ridden in seven days include:\nOne month.\nThere are 2 authorities currently recognising this record, Guinness World Records and World Ultra Cycling Association (formerly the UltraMarathon Cycling Association). Tommy Godwin rode in July 1939, on his way to setting the World Endurance record for a single year however no authority has recognised this as a record. Current record holders are:\n100,000 Miles.\nOn 11 July 2017, 24-year-old Amanda Coker set a new \"Fastest completion of 100,000 miles by bicycle record, doing so in 423 days. Coker's record improved by 77 days on Tommy Godwin's prior record of 500 days set in May 1940. The record was certified by the Guinness Book of Records and the Ultra Marathon Cycling Association (now the WUCA).\nWorld Endurance record for distance in a calendar year.\nMen's record.\nIn 1911 the weekly magazine \"Cycling\" began a competition for the highest number of 100-mile rides or \"centuries\" in a single year. The winner was Marcel Planes with 332 centuries in which he covered . The inspiration for the competition was said to be the efforts of Harry Long, a commercial traveller who rode a bicycle on his rounds covering every part of England and Scotland and who covered in 1910. The world record for distance cycled in a year began in an era when bicycle companies competed to show their machines were the most reliable. The record has been officially established nine times. A tenth claim, by the English rider Ken Webb in 1972, was disallowed. Apart from the 1911 competition organised by \"Cycling\", there was no authority that set rules for record attempts nor certified the mileage ridden. In 1937 the League of Victorian Wheelmen declined a request by Ossie Nicholson for patronage for his attempt on the record. Nicholson's response was to appoint a committee to supervise his attempt. The mileage had been traditionally verified by way of a sealed milometer and cards signed by upstanding members of society such as police officers or postmasters.\nIn November 2014 the UltraMarathon Cycling Association announced that it would recognise a new record category for the highest annual mileage in a year, and set rules for the record. All of the previous record holders from Marcel Planes to Tommy Godwin rode a double-triangle diamond frame bicycle, and their rides all commenced on 1 January. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association decided, however, to permit any bike type except for faired recumbents, and that an attempt may start on any day of the year running for 365 consecutive days. Odometers and cards were replaced by GPS recording and live tracking devices such as the SPOT Satellite Messenger.\nIn 2015, three cyclists commenced an attempt to beat the record set by Tommy Godwin. Briton Steve Abraham started his attempt on 1 January, American Kurt Searvogel, nicknamed Tarzan, started 10 January, and Australian Miles Smith started on 18 June. Abraham was hit by a moped rider on 29 March 2015, breaking his leg above the ankle. After two weeks' recovery, Abraham resumed cycling gradually, using just one leg to pedal a recumbent trike. Having lost so much distance, he launched a concurrent attempt on the record starting on 8 August 2015, however he announced on 22 January 2016 that he had ended his concurrent attempt. Abraham rode in his calendar year attempt. Smith ceased his attempt on 13 November 2015. Searvogel managed to overcome weather, injury and also married his one-woman support crew Alicia Searvogel, breaking Godwin's mark with five days to spare. Cycling Weekly reported a surprising number of people were less than charitable about Searvogel's amazing feat. Searvogel planned his attempt to hit his final mileage of 76,076 miles exactly, writing \"The number is significant in that it took 76 years and 76,076 miles to take the record from the British – The spirit of 76 lives on\". This UMCA record is also recognized as a Guinness World Record.\nWomen's record.\nDuring 1938 Billie Dovey, the English 'keep fit girl' of the 1930s, achieved a record . Contemporary advertising shows that she rode a Rudge-Whitworth bicycle and relied on Cadbury milk chocolate for energy. Dovey combined the attempt with a lecture tour, often finishing her ride and then giving a fitness lecture in the evening.\nIn February 1942 Pat Hawkins, the holder of the 'World Seven Days record', claimed to have ridden in Perth, West Australia, despite having missed seven weeks riding. A few days later the claim was withdrawn due to discrepancies in her logs. The press had reported her campaign in relation to Billie Dovey's record, to wit, \"after ten weeks she had recorded compared to Mrs Dovey's .\" She would have reached Dovey's record after 36 weeks, three days, one hour and 20 minutes. The endeavour was sponsored by Bruce Small Pty Ltd.\nIn 2016, Kajsa Tylen broke the record, exceeding Dovey's mileage on 24 November, with over a month of the year left to go. Guinness did not ratify Billie Dovey's record, and had set a target of over 50,000 km. Tylen cycled all over the UK and Europe, encouraging others to join her every day, and make 'sweat pledges' of support. Tylen set the Guinness World Record for females at .\nOn 5 April 2017, the 326th day of her year-long record attempt to ride more miles in a year than anybody ever, Amanda Coker broke the women's, as well as the overall mileage record, when she exceeded Kurt Searvogel's previous record of . The Guinness Book of World Records certified Coker's record at the end of her record-breaking day at . Coker completed her year-long mileage record with .\nOn June 4, 2016, Alicia Searvogel became the first woman over 50 years of age to make an attempt the Highest Annual Mileage record. On June 3, 2017, Searvogel finished her attempt with a total of . While she fell short of breaking Amanda Coker's overall woman's record, Ms. Searvogel was awarded the highest annual mileage record, and highest month mileage record in the 50–59 age category by the UMCA (now WUCA).\nRoad bicycle racing records.\nThe following is a list of Road bicycle racing achievements and records:\nWheelie records.\nThe longest bicycle wheelie in one hour is , and was achieved by Manuel Scheidegger (Switzerland) in Bern, Switzerland on 12 September 2020.\nKurt Osburn (nicknamed \"Wheelie King\") from California, United States is the Guinness World Record holder for Longest Bicycle Wheelie, riding on the back wheel of a bicycle. On 8 August 1998, he rode a wheelie for a record 11 hours at the Anaheim Convention Center, California. In June 2012 David \"Pixie\" Robilliard failed to break the record.\nFrom 13 April to 25 June 1999, Kurt rode 2,839.6 miles from Hollywood to the Guinness World Records Experience in Orlando on one wheel, also for a Guinness World Record, becoming the first person in history to ride a bicycle wheelie coast to coast. During his attempt he rode an average of 50 miles per day, sometimes with winds in excess of 40 miles per hour. Other facts: He cycled on the 110 Highway, had 4 flat tires (on the rear tire of course), over 1.8 million pedal revolutions from start to finish, and was chased by dogs almost daily.\nAround the world.\nTo qualify for the relevant Guinness World Record one must satisfy various requirements, such as total distance travelled, pass through two approximate antipodal points, provide specified evidence, etc."

        "text": "The Croatia national handball team () represents Croatia in international men's team handball competitions and friendly matches. The handball team is controlled by the Croatian Handball Federation (HRS).\nCroatia won one World Championship, but never won the Euros, lost three finals, one to rivals France, one to Denmark, and one to Spain. The Croatian national team that won the 1996 Olympic gold medal was often credited as the biggest upset in history of handball, with handball making its debut appearance. The Croatian national team won a so-called \"international double\" after winning both the gold medal at the Olympics (2004) and the World Championship (2003), beating Germany in both finals.\nSome of their biggest rivals are neighbours Slovenia, Hungary and Serbia. Germany are also called rivals of the handball team, although matches between Germany and Croatia have been met with Croatian dominance, Germany only winning once in their nine meetings, and Croatia winning seven times. Mediterranean side Spain have also been called as close rivals, having played 23 games with them, the most out of any sides the Croatians have played within handball. However, the French are often remarked as Croatia's biggest-ever rival in handball, due to both countries' successes. In recent history though, Croatia often suffered eliminations at the hands of the French.\nHistory.\nHandball in Austria-Hungary (1904–1918).\nThe word handball in the Croatian region was first used by Franjo Bučar, describing the German game Schleuderball in the journal \"Sokol\" 1904. The earliest documented forms of playing handball in these areas appear in 1911 in the gymnasium of Pazin, which is among other things due to the fact that programs for education in Istria, as part of the then Austrian coast, coming from the education center in Graz. In Croatia, at the time handball was in high school programs closing ceremony. It was a kind of Czech handball extended from the Czech Republic, where it was adopted by the Osijek and Vukovar students from Prague.\nBetween the two world wars (1918–1941).\nIn the early beginnings of the Croatian handball, venues played field handball and handball. Students were still more attracted to field handball, because the little handball were played on makeshift courts without the right door, as opposed to the field handball, which is played on the existing football fields. During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia first public handball match in the Croatian region was played and in the wider neighborhood. It was played in a high school in Varaždin 29 May 1930 under the guidance of physical education teachers Zvonimir Šuligoj. Since that game, until 1950, in Croatia and Yugoslavia publicly played exclusively field handball, on the football field with eleven players on each side. In high school in Zagreb on 1 June 1935, opened the first handball courts in Yugoslavia.\nThe establishment of Croatian Handball Federation and the first Croatian national team (1941–1945).\nAt the beginning of World War II Kingdom of Yugoslavia disintegrated. Most of the territory inhabited by Croats on 10 April 1941, it became part of the newly formed Independent State of Croatia (NDH). As part of the new state on 2 October 1941 in Zagreb for the first time in history the Croatian Handball Federation (HRS) was established.\nThe place of foundation is recorded to be at the Croatian Sports home in Jurišićeva, Zagreb. HRS is the umbrella organization of handball in the ISC coordinated the work of a dozen clubs and until 1944 organized national championships. In the state of NDH was established the first Croatian handball team. The first training for practice-match team NDH was held on 12 October 1941 between the two teams selected from the head coach Dragutin Pehe. His first and only international match this team played on 14 June 1942 with Hungary in Budapest where they lost 0:9. This field handball match was played in front of 30,000 spectators at the then NEP Stadium (since 2002 Ferenc Puskás Stadium) was a prelude meeting of the football teams of the same name. The best handball player in the field was the goalkeeper Branko Kralj. Under the direction of the coach Ante Škrtić, the players for Croatia were Vlado Abramović, Irislav Dolenec, Žarko Galetović, Zvonko Leskovar, Todor Marinov, Viktor Medved, Krešo Pavlin, Vlado Šimanović Stjepan Širić, Josip Žitnik and reserve goalkeeper Zdenko Šurina. HRS stopped functioning in 1944 because of the war in World War II.\nHandball in SFR Yugoslavia (1945–1991).\nWhen the 1945 World War II ended, the territory of the Independent State of Croatia was included in the newly established SFR Yugoslavia.\nImmediately after that began the reconstruction of the war abandoned handball in Yugoslavia, and that same year founded the Committee for handball Gymnastics Association Croatian, and in May 1948 the Committee for handball Gymnastics Association of Yugoslavia. Operation HRS is restored on 19 December 1948, in which he, in accordance with the national policy of the new Yugoslav state, name changed in the Croatian Handball Association (RSH). Handball Federation of Yugoslavia (RSJ) was established on 17 December 1949 in Belgrade by pooling national and provincial associations, and it became a member of the International Handball Federation (IHF) in 1950.\nAfter the end of World War II, most field handball players of NDH completed courses and became instructors or referees in handball. Some of them have become members of the field handball national team of Yugoslavia and played in its first international match, played on 19 June 1950 at the stadium in Stadion Kranjčevićeva in Zagreb, against Belgium. Yugoslavia won 18:3 playing with nine players from Zagreb, one from Split and one from Sarajevo.\nSince the end of World War II until the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, the best Croatian handball players in field and team handball played for the national team of Yugoslavia. With this national team Croatians have performed at 17 major competitions and won seven medals. These are two Olympic gold medals, the Olympic bronze, world gold, world silver and two bronze world. Among the other famous trophy, in this period they won 5 gold medals in five appearances at the Mediterranean Games (1967, 1975, 1979, 1983 and 1991), two gold and one bronze medal at the World Cups held in 1971, 1974 and 1984 in Sweden, 2 bronze medals at handball Super League held in 1981 and 1983 in Germany and silver at the 1990 goodwill Games in Seattle.\nAt the World Junior Championship in 1987 in Rijeka there was created a nucleus generation that will define the nineties and bring some of the most beautiful handball stories for the Croatian national team. Alvaro Načinović, Iztok Puc, Vladimir Jelčić and other predominantly have won this championship playing for Yugoslavia, and their talent and knowledge are later incorporated as seniors in the first Croatian success after independence of the country.\nModern Croatia national handball team (1991–present).\nOfficial formation and first competitions (1991–1996).\nCroatia on 30 May 1990 began the process of creating the independent state, and soon established and modern Croatian handball team. The first international match of the Croatian handball team was played on 14 January 1991 in Zagreb, in Kutija Šibica. It was a friendly match with Japan which ended in a draw 23:23. The team was coached by Josip Milković with assistant coach Lino Červar and the players were Patrik Čavar, Tonči Peribonio, Vlado Šola, Ivica Obrvan, Nenad Kljaić, Iztok Puc, Ratko Tomljanović, Bruno Gudelj, Željko Zovko, Stjepan Obran, Tomislav Farkaš, Robert Ipša, Ivo Glavinić and Goran Stojanović.\nThe dissolution of Yugoslavia that followed, Croatia gained full independence on 8 October 1991 the Croatian Handball Association (RSH) in 1992 restored the original name of the Croatian Handball Federation (HRS), and on 10 April 1992 became a member of the International Handball Federation (IHF), and 23 July 1992 members of the European Handball Federation (EHF).\nTaking fourth place at the 1990 World Championship in Czechoslovakia the Yugoslav national team was placed among the nine best teams of the tournament, which acquired them the right to participate in the upcoming 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. Because of the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, this team was disqualified, and should it was supposed to be specified who will replaced them in the games. Since the Croatian Olympic Committee (COC) was provisionally recognized on 17 January 1992 by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and since Croatia had already on 22 May 1992 become a member of the United Nations, Croatian handball players had conditions to perform at the Olympic Games in 1992. This unfortunately did not happen. Although Croatia in terms of game was handball superpower, it was decided that Yugoslavia would be replaced by Iceland at the games as they finished tenth at the 1990 World Championship. Adverse effects of certain officials in the IOC prevented even the option of maintaining an additional qualifying tournament like the one held for the Croatian basketball players. Croatia also missed the 1993 World Championship in Sweden, because the World Championship in 1990 was an elimination tournament for this championship.\nThe following years, in spite of the short history of the country brought the Croatian team very significant results in important competitions. Croatia won its first official competition at the Mediterranean Games in 1993 in Languedoc-Roussillon, France, Croatia won gold. At the first ever European Championship in 1994 held in Portugal the team was led by Zdravko Zovko they won their first medal at this first major international competition. The group stage ended with Croatia finishing behind then powerful Russians, but in front of the French, led by the famous Jackson Richardson. In the semi-finals, the Swedes were better and Croatia played the third place match and won in a dramatic match against Denmark. Sweden won the tournament demolishing the Russians in the final with 13 points. A year later at the 1995 World Championships in Iceland Croatia relatively went easily from group stage to the quarter final where there was brought a rarely seen drama. Tunisia was defeated after penalty shootout. Then the team beat Egypt in the quarter finals and Sweden men's national handball team in the semi-finals. In the final they the French were too big an obstacle for Zovko guys won their first Croatian World Championship silver medal. Sweden won the bronze defeating Germany. The next year at the European Championship in 1996 in Spain, Croatia, was led by Abas Arslanagić. Croatia lost took fifth place with victory over the Czech Republic where the match was led by Vladimir Nekić because Arslanagić quit after Croatia failed to enter the semi-finals. The championship was won by Russia.\nGold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics.\nOn the second Olympics in which Croatian athletes performed under the banner of the Croatian flag and won their first gold medal. This was won by the athletes who were least expected to win it, handball players. They were sent off to Atlanta without hope, because at the European Championship in 1996 they had finished in a weak fifth place, and relations in the national team were bad. Coach Abas Arslanagić quit during the end of the European championship and the national handball selection was filled with confrontation and fights. 38 days before the Olympic Games, the team was taken over by coach Velimir Kljaić, whose statement: \"Will go back swimming if we don't win a medal\" no one took seriously.\nBefore the Olympics there were still problems. Preliminary matches didn't offer much optimism. A few days before the start of the handball tournament a friendly encounter with Algeria was not played to the end. The Croatian players left the court because the Algerians went too far with their abusive playing and hurt three players, Goran Perkovac, Slavko Goluža and Nenad Kljaić.\nThe opening match of the Olympic games against Switzerland was tough. A victory was achieved in an already lost match. The Swiss led by as much as 6 goals, but then the goal was kept safe with a superb save from Venio Losert who just during the Olympic Games celebrated his 20th birthday. Making it a minimal victory, scoring in the 55th second before the end of the match, Patrik Ćavar brought a stellar victory.\nThe next two matches against Kuwait and hosts United States were easy victories. This was followed by the decisive encounter to enter the semi-finals, where there were only the two first-placed teams from each group.\nThe match with the then current Olympic and European champions Russia had a shocking finale. The Russians were leading by four points, but the Croats were arriving. The last minute was not for the faint of heart, but from the \"Russian roulette\" though the Croats came out as winners. One her of this triumph for the semi-finals was Valter Matošević. 40 seconds before the end of the match, when the result was 24:24, he defended a penalty shot from Torgovanov. Another hero was Božidar Jović, who just 3 seconds before the siren rang scored the winning goal.\nThe last match in the group was with the Swedes. This was the one in which yoneou could choose an opponent in the semi-finals, but Kljun omitted Patrik Ćavar, Iztok Puc, Zlatko Saračević and Irfan Smajlagić from the match. Croatia was defeated with nine goals difference, but without their poker aces there wasn't much to expect. The defeat did not have larger significance, except that it took to save face. In the semi-finals they waited for the French who were World Champions. Croatian handball showed the best possible way to respond to defeat in the final of the 1995 World Championship in Iceland. Engaged and disciplined, Croatian players did a great job and ensured the silver medal the same brightness as did the water polo team.\nIn the grand finale again Croatia faced the Swedes. In the semi-finals they defeated Spain, who later won the bronze medal. It was a great generation that only needed an Olympic gold medal to complete their collection. They probably hoped that Croatia was not with those who were missing against Sweden would not much raise the quality that they could be threatened. In the end their plans were foiled, and the Vikings failed to win. After starting 0: 1 followed by a brilliant game from the players Kljaić chose and the series of 6:1. The defense was solid and impenetrable and the attack varied and deadly. Perkovac great led his boys and Božidar Jović was the revelation of the tournament. Worried only in the final Zlatko Saračević was not playing properly, but Kljaić brought the perfect replacement, Zoran Mikulić. Although the Croatians twice led with seven goals difference, the second half offered drama. Swedes switched to defense 4–2 which created big problems. Decreased the difference and 6:30 minutes before the end came at just hit behind. Croatian handball players still in those crucial minutes they had never trembled hands.\nThirty seconds before the end of the line player Nenad Kljaić scored a crucial goal for the final 27:26 and brought a glorious victory. With the sound of sirens was created indescribable celebration and parquet Georgia Dome in front of 25,000 visitors in the hall and millions of TV viewers, which is today known caterpillar gold handball. It was the biggest win in the history of Croatian sport. The handball players were not yet aware of this gold they had placed around his neck President of the Croatian Olympic Committee Antun Vrdoljak, who previously predicted 6 Atlanta medal and otherwise announced \"As running from the day he was born\" at Zagreb's main square. Still not running, but the handball players after returning from Atlanta to thousands of fans being greeted at the airport and on Jelačić Square. And they did the famous caterpillar crawl.\nA series of poor results (1996–2002).\nAfter winning the Olympic gold medal on 4 August 1996 it was followed by a slow decline in the Croatian national team and the change of generations in which the handball players were far from winning a medal. It started when Croatia was knocked-out in the round of 16 of the World Championships. In Japan in 1997, Croatia was knocked out by Spain 31:25 and was ranked in 13th place. In Egypt 1999 they were knocked-out by Yugoslavia 30:23 leaving Croatia in 10th place. In France 2001 the national team would lose in the next round after two extra time (4 × 5 minutes) stopped Ukraine 37:34 (29: 29/33: 33) finishing in 9th place. At the European Championships in 1998, 2000 and 2002 finished in 8th, 6th and 16th place. Croatia in 2000 hosted the European Championship, they had high expectations from this tournament but they weren't fulfilled. After the defeat from Slovenia in the match for fifth place Croatia took only 6th place and failed to qualify for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. The national team is also lost its ability to defend the gold from Atlanta in Sydney.\nFirst Červar era (2002–2010).\nOnce the team reached bottom with their results, being ranked last or in 16th place at the 2002 European Championship, in March 2002 the Federation entrusted Lino Červar and with him the team that suffered a seven-year drought medal in two years was created into the world champions and Olympic winners. In the period between these two gold medals Croatia is still ranked 4th place at the European Championships in 2004 in Slovenia. With Červar in charge Croatia would be at the top of the handball world.\nWith the arrival of Lino Červar and a maturing exceptionally talented new generation including a young Ivano Balić, the revival of the national team culminated at the 2003 World Championship. The start of the competition was disastrous. Croatia lost in their first match to Argentina who was at the time a punching for serious national teams in official competitions. Although the first half led with 5 goals, but 14 minutes before the end of the match conceded 6 goals. At the end of the match, Croatian handball players fired five successive attacks, and Mirza Džomba 20 seconds before the end missed the equalizer. How Croatian players badly played that match was proven by the fact they missed 6 penalty shots. During halftime of the second match against another underdog Saudi Arabia Croatia was losing with 2 differences and was playing desperately. Yet the team found strength to win this match. The turning point was marvelous – the group's dramatic victories in the end against giants Russia, France and Hungary securing first place to the second part where the Croats were convincing against Egypt and Denmark. In semi-finals the match went into overtime (4 × 5 minutes) defeating the Spaniards 39:37 (26: 26/31: 31) and in the grand final they outscored Germany 34:31 and won their first title of world champions and wrote surely one of the most beautiful story's in the history of Croatian sport.\nIn January 2004 Croatia played at the 2004 European Championship in Slovenia. They got to the semi-finals where they were knocked out by the hosts 25:27. They finished in fourth place losing the third place match to Denmark 27:31.\nIn Summer 2004 the Olympics were held in Athens. The national team continued its dominating play and were undefeated in all eight matches played. They defeated Iceland, Slovenia, South Korea, Russia, Spain, Greece and Hungary before getting to the final. In a dramatic final Croatia defeated Germany 26–24 and with the title of world champions they won the Olympic gold. In the last 5 minutes of the match went a goal ahead for Croatia, and then Nikša Kaleb who had not scored no goal with 3 consecutive goals sealed a great victory. The gold was an even greater success considering the fact that Croatia traveled to Athens without their best line player Renato Sulić who was recovering from a car accident, without important defense player Tonči Valčić and without Patrik Ćavar who was ill.\nRivalries.\nCroatia has developed several handball rivalries. Their most played rivalry is against France, which is often considered to be one of the biggest modern handball rivalries since the end of the Cold War, since Croatia, Denmark, Spain and France are the most successful nations in handball both in Europe and worldwide. Their second biggest rivalry is with neighbors Slovenia, whom they played 14 times, winning 9 games and losing 5. In recent years, a rivalry with Spain has also developed, sometimes called the Mediterranean derby. Other rivalries include Denmark, Poland, Germany, Serbia and Hungary.\nResults at international competitions.\nPrior to 1991, Croatia men's national handball team played as a part of Yugoslavia men's national handball team.\nCroatia played its first match on 14 January 1991 in Zagreb. Team's first opponent was Japan and the match ended tied 23–23.\nMedal count (major competitions).\nUpdated after 2023 World Handball Championship\n Champions   Runners-up   Third place   Fourth place  \nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nSquad for the 2024 European Men's Handball Championship.\nHead coach: Dagur Sigurðsson\nStatistics.\nTop scorers.\n\"Players that played for Croatian National Handball Team after the breakup of Yugoslavia and&lt;br&gt;collected 100+ caps combined for Yugoslavian and Croatian National Handball Teams.\"\nRecord against other teams.\n\"As of 20 March 2021\" \nBiggest wins.\n\"Double digit goal difference\"\nAwards.\nThe Croatia national handball team has received numerous award throughout the years."

        "text": "West Germany's Steffi Graf defeated Argentina's Gabriela Sabatini in the final, 6–3, 6–3 to win the gold medal in Women's Singles tennis at the 1988 Summer Olympics. With the win, Graf completed the Golden Slam, having also won all four majors earlier in 1988. The final was a rematch of the U.S. Open final earlier that year, where Graf also prevailed to complete the Grand Slam. The United States' Zina Garrison and Bulgaria's Manuela Maleeva-Fragnière won the bronze medals. It was the first medal in the event for West Germany, Argentina, and Bulgaria (each making their debut in the event), while the United States had previously earned medals in both of its prior appearances in 1900 and 1924.\nThe tournament was held from 23 September to 1 October at the Seoul Olympic Park Tennis Center. There were 48 competitors from 26 nations. Each nation had only one pair. There was no bronze-medal match.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the women's singles tennis. A women's event was held only once during the first three Games (only men's tennis was played in 1896 and 1904), but has been held at every Olympics for which there was a tennis tournament since 1908. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 and 1984.\nWest Germany's Steffi Graf had just become the fifth person to win the Grand Slam and was also the unofficial defending Olympic champion, having won the 1984 demonstration event (the official reigning gold medalist from 1924, Helen Wills, had retired from tennis 50 years earlier).\nOf the 26 competing nations, 18 made their debut in the event. France and Great Britain each made their fifth appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament. Unlike previous Olympic tournaments, no bronze-medal match was held. All matches were best-of-three sets. The 12-point tie-breaker, common by 1988, was used in the Olympics for the first time.\nSeeds.\nAll seeds received a bye to the second round."

        "text": "Karl Adam (2 May 1912 in Hagen – 18 June 1976 in Bad Salzuflen) was one of the most successful and innovative German rowing coaches. Although he was never an active rower himself, he helped win 29 medals at major rowing events, including three Olympic gold medals, two world and five European Championships.\nEarly life.\nAdam was born on 2 May 1912 in Vorhalle; at the time an independent district but since 1929, it belongs to the city of Hagen. He received his secondary education at the Oberrealschule in Hagen. In 1931, he started studying towards a teaching degree in the subjects mathematics, physics, and physical education. After obtaining his degree, he joined the in Berlin in 1937. That year, he became student world champion in heavyweight boxing in Paris. World War II finished his sporting career and Adam received serious injuries in Normandy, France. After a time in hospital, he became a prisoner of war with the French forces. In 1948, he had his first job as a teacher at the in Ratzeburg, Schleswig-Holstein. It was at the Lauenburgische Gelehrtenschule that he was put in charge of school rowing.\nCoaching career.\nAdam was co-founder of the Ratzeburg Rowing Club in 1953 and head of the Rowing Academy there. He never rowed and learned the rowing and sculling techniques by reading and observation in the late 1930s. He was a competitive boxer and a Student World Champion in 1937. He accompanied the German rowing team to the 1956 Summer Olympics as sculling coach. Germany performed poorly, and Adam returned determined to revolutionise their program to improve performance.\nA great innovator of rowing and training techniques, Adam's methods had a major impact on the further development of rowing. His rowing technique became known in the rowing world as the \"Ratzeburg\" style. Adam was the first to adapt fartlek, also known as speedplay, and interval training from track (athletics) as well as heavy weight training to rowing. He pioneered a new, more efficient, oar design and was the first coach to use \"bucket\" or \"German\" rigging. He wrote that he did NOT object that his rowers were using anabolic steroids. But it ought to be the decision of the rower himself. Officials, the coaching and medical staff should inform of the advantages and dangers, but never tell the athlete which decision to take.\nDeath.\nAdam died suddenly and unexpectedly on 18 June 1976 in Bad Salzuflen."

        "title": "John Boles (baseball)",
        "text": "John E. Boles Jr. (born August 19, 1948) is an American former professional baseball front-office executive, manager in minor league and Major League Baseball, and college baseball head coach. As of , he was the senior adviser to the general manager for player development for the Kansas City Royals.\nBoles spent two terms— (July 11–end of the season), and (–May 28, 2001)—as manager of the Florida Marlins, compiling a win–loss record of 205–241 (.460). He also served two separate terms as a member of the Royals' front office, held executive positions with the Marlins, Montreal Expos, Los Angeles Dodgers and Seattle Mariners, and was a manager in both the Chicago White Sox and Royals organizations.\nEarly career.\nBoles graduated from Leo Catholic High School in Chicago in 1966, and Lewis University, Romeoville, Illinois, in 1970. He did not play professional baseball, and began his career as a college baseball coach at St. Xavier University (1973–79) and the University of Louisville (1980–81). He joined the White Sox system as manager of their Rookie League affiliate, the GCL White Sox, in 1981.\nBy 1986, Boles had risen through the ranks in his managerial career to Triple-A. Having grown up as a White Sox fan, Boles wanted the chance to coach or manage his hometown team. In , ChiSox third-base coach Jim Leyland was appointed manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. White Sox skipper Tony La Russa wanted Boles to be Leyland's replacement, but Ken Harrelson, newly named the club's director of baseball operations, hired Doug Rader instead. So Boles departed for the Royals' organization as manager of Triple-A Omaha. After one season, he was promoted by the Royals' general manager, John Schuerholz, to director of player development.\nMeanwhile, former White Sox executive Dave Dombrowski (also forced out of the organization by Harrelson) had moved on to the Montreal Expos, where he eventually became general manager. In , Dombrowski hired Boles as the Expos' vice president/player development. At the end of the season, Dombrowski was recruited by the National League's new expansion team, the Florida Marlins, to become their first general manager. Boles accompanied Dombrowski to Florida as the Marlins' first vp/player development.\nManagerial career.\nBoles was still in that position in 1996 when, on July 7, Marlins manager Rene Lachemann was fired, and Boles was named interim manager. He led the Marlins to a 40–35 record in the second half of that season. However, during the offseason, then-Marlins owner H. Wayne Huizenga decided to sign several marquee free agents to make a run at the World Series. In addition to Gary Sheffield, Jeff Conine, Édgar Rentería, Robb Nen and Kevin Brown, among others, who were already with Florida, the Marlins signed free agents Alex Fernandez, Moisés Alou and Bobby Bonilla—then named Jim Leyland, highly successful with the small-market Pirates (with three National League East Division titles from 1990 to 1992), as manager. Leyland's signing returned Boles to his previous position as vp/player development. The talented 1997 Marlins then won the National League pennant and the World Series.\nA year after the championship season, Huizenga—intent on selling the franchise—ordered a \"fire sale\" in which nearly every marquee player was traded away. Leyland remained the manager, and in , he led the team to a dismal 54–108 record, making the team the first defending World Series champion to lose 100 games the next season. After the season, Leyland resigned to manage the Colorado Rockies, and Boles returned to manage the Marlins for the season. He led them to a 64–98 record that year, then followed it up with an improved record of 79–82. But on May 29, 2001, one day after relief pitcher Dan Miceli publicly criticized Boles, citing the fact that the Marlins' manager had never played professional baseball, Boles was fired. At 22–26, the Marlins were in third place in the NL East, eight games out of the lead. He was replaced by special assistant to the general manager Tony Pérez.\nPost-managerial career.\nThe Marlins also were undergoing massive front-office changes, with Huizenga's successor as owner, John W. Henry, selling the team and Dombrowski leaving to become president of the Detroit Tigers. In , Boles resumed his executive career. He was hired by the Dodgers as senior advisor for baseball operations. Then, in , he joined the Mariners as special assistant to the executive vice president and general manager, serving also as a scout. In , he rejoined the Royals as a senior advisor to general manager Dayton Moore.\nHis son, Kevin Boles, is a manager in Minor League Baseball with the Binghamton Rumble Ponies."

        "title": "Formula 1 Powerboat World Championship",
        "text": "The Formula 1 Powerboat World Championship (also F1) is an international motorboat racing competition for powerboats organised by the Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM) and promoted by H2O Racing, hence it often being referred to as F1H2O. It is the highest class of inshore powerboat racing in the world, and as such, with it sharing the title of F1, is similar to Formula One car racing. Each race lasts approximately 45 minutes following a circuit marked out in a selected stretch of water, usually a lake, river, dock, or sheltered bay.\nQualifying periods decide the formation of the grid, and timing equipment records the performance of competitors to decide the final classification and allocation of championship points.\nHistory.\nThe concept of a single unified championship for inshore powerboats had been conceived three years previously in 1978 when David Parkinson, an experienced PR manager, was offered the support of Mercury Marine, one of his clients, if he could establish such a series. The concept became the Canon Trophy, sponsored by another of Parkinson's clients, Canon Inc.\nA steady escalation in engine development between Mercury and arch-rival OMC was already underway as the Canon Trophy was formed, and this arms race ultimately resulted in massively powerful V8 engines being used and led to the creation of the OZ class. Each manufacturer offered as many as half a dozen drivers with a free supply of these OZ class engines in a bid to succeed. The OZ engines differed from the ON class which was centred around a standard 2-litre capacity and consequently OZ machines, with their superior power, swept all before them. Matters came to a head when, in an attempt to extract an even greater advantage, Renato Molinari turned up with two engines on the back of his boat at the Italian Grand Prix. A petition was signed by 28 drivers in 1980 to outlaw the OZ boats and the Formula ON Drivers Association (FONDA) was born. Mercury withdrew their T4 engine and the split was confirmed. OZ and ON classes would have their own championships in 1981.\nSomewhat understandably, both championships attempted to use the title of Formula 1 to market themselves as the pinnacle of powerboat racing. For much of 1981 however it was largely irrelevant. John Player had chosen to support the OMC-powered OZ championship, giving it not only an advantage in speed and technology, but also marketing. The championship was still in its early stages with a small grid, but FONDA's ON class was not much better either and was effectively the remains of the Canon Trophy. Journalists of the period continued to use the familiar terms of ON and OZ to avoid confusion, and it was only when the UIM stepped in to sort out the mess that resulted in the OZ class being awarded Formula 1 status, with the ON class given the consolation title of \"World Grand Prix\". Thus, with the backing of the drivers' association behind it, the FONDA World Grand Prix Series entered into a period of being overshadowed by its bigger, faster brother, the Formula 1 World Series.\nBy bringing together the financial support and marketing ability of John Player Special, as well as the clarity and consistency of a championship with an established event structure, one which focused on sprint races rather than a mixture that included endurance races in previous years, the category allowed for a relatively stable environment in which the top powerboat teams and drivers could compete. A fixed points system made comprehension easy for spectators, with it matching its motor racing equivalent with 9, 6, 4, 3, 2, and finally 1 point on offer for the top six finishers.\nSafety was always looming large in the background of the F1 series. The ever-increasing speeds of the 3.5-litre V8s, as OMC continued to refine them, meant that surviving a 'big one' was becoming less and less likely. In 1984, matters reached a tragic conclusion when Tom Percival was the last of four drivers to lose their lives in the space of a matter of months. Cees van der Velden pulled his three-boat Benson &amp; Hedges-backed team from the final three races of the season, and Carlsberg cancelled their partnership with Roger Jenkins, having told the 1982 champion, \"another death or serious injury, and they were out\". OMC were able to pull together a depleted field to see out the season, but the writing was on the wall. It was the beginning of the end for Formula 1 as the OZ class.\nKeen to keep the championship running however, OMC gave the F1 World Series a facelift. With Benson &amp; Hedges vacating the series' title sponsorship, in came Champion to create the Champion Spark Plug F1 World Series, and a new Belgian promoter, Pro One, was tasked with turning the series around. Prize money was significantly increased to attract drivers and a greater presence in the United States was sought. Following the trends in hydroplanes with seat belts and safety cells, boat designer Chris Hodges introduced the first iteration of his safety cell which paved the way for a revolution in boat safety and Bob Spalding won the title driving for the Percival Hodges team. On the outside, it appeared as if Formula 1 was set for a new period of growth, until OMC uncovered the level of spending that Pro One had undertaken to raise the profile of the championship. Rumours suggested the promoter had spent the promotion budget for the next three years in a single season. Figures of $4–5 million were passed around. OMC called time on the whole European operation at the end of 1985 and in 1986, based solely in North America, the F1 World Series was wound down before it was completely assimilated into the domestic US championship.\nFrom 1987 to 1989, there was no official Formula 1 championship. The FONDA World Grand Prix Series continued to operate with title sponsorship from Budweiser and benefitted from F1's demise in Europe as drivers moved back over. In simple terms Mercury's two litre formula had outlasted OMC's monster 3.5-litre V8s but the reality was far more complex than that. In the United States, Formula 1 lived on, but as far as the world stage was concerned, the powerboat community once again turned to David Parkinson, who having established the Canon Trophy back in 1978, was still at the helm of the FONDA series into which it had evolved. With no other challenger unlike ten years previously, the UIM reinstated the Formula 1 category to World Championship status and in 1990 the FONDA World Grand Prix Series became the Formula 1 World Championship.\nDavid Parkinson continued to manage and promote the championship until the end of 1993, at which point he handed over to Nicolo di San Germano, who continues to lead the series to the present day. Di San Germano has overseen a period of continued improvements in driver safety, managed the championship through multiple economic downturns and seen a shift in focus for the series away from Europe towards the Middle East and Asia, driven by a need for financial stability. The cost has been a heavy one in the eyes of many traditional fans based in Europe as calendars and grid sizes have shrunk but the attraction remains – the series will return to Portugal and France in 2015 and there is a focus on four-stroke technology to finally overhaul the decades-old two-stroke engines that have dominated the sport since the very start.\nFormat.\nInaugurated in 1981, F1 powerboat racing is a Grand Prix style event, in which teams compete around the world each season. In the 2013 season, a total of 23 drivers and 9 teams entered at least one race, with 16 boats competing full-time. The races take place along a track of approximately 350 meters with multiple turns, over which the boats can reach 250 kilometers per hour (155 mph). The races are longer than most powerboat races at approximately 45 minutes, but still shorter than many car races.\nBoats.\nF1 racing uses tunnel hull catamarans that are capable of both high speed and exceptional manoeuvrability. Overall, the boats weigh 860 pounds (390 kilogrammes), including 260 pounds (118 kilograms) of engine. They are 20 feet (6 metres) long and seven feet (2 metres) wide, keeping weight low through extensive use of carbon fiber and kevlar. The tunnel hull design creates aerodynamic lift due to a 'wing' formed by the deck and under surface of the hull. This increases lift and reduces drag, so that at speed only a few inches of the boat touch the water, leading to the high speed possible with these hulls.\nF1 boats are powered by a Mercury Marine V6 two stroke that burns 100LL Avgas at a rate of 120 liters (32 \ngallons) per hour, generating over 400 horsepower at 10,500 rpm. This engine can propel the boats to 100 km/h (62 mph) in less than two seconds and to a maximum speed of over 250 km/h (155 mph).\nSafety.\nAlthough F1 boats have not changed much in appearance since the start of the event, the construction and safety has been dramatically improved from the original open-cockpit plywood boats.\nThe first major development was the hard composite cockpit capsule designed to break away from the rest of the boat in a crash. This also inaugurated the practice of securing the drivers to their seats with a harness. First developed by designer and racer Chris Hodges, this system was optional for a time due to the opposition of the drivers but, after it saved several drivers in major crashes, the UIM mandated it for all boats. In the early 1990s F1 boat builder Dave Burgess introduced a canopy that fully enclosed the cockpit to protect the driver from the full force of water in a nose-dive, similar to the system used in Unlimited hydroplanes a decade earlier. In the late 1990s boat builder DAC introduced an airbag situated behind the driver that prevents the cockpit from completely submerging if the boat flips.\nThese specific changes in safety features were also accompanied by a progression of lighter and stronger composite hulls that also reduced the hazards of racing. F1 drivers now also wear a HANS Head and Neck Restraint device similar to that worn by their Formula One automobile racing counterparts to combat head and neck injuries.\nAs of the 2007 season, all boats are required to have a protective crash box installed. Potential future safety features include collapsible bows that would deform rather than penetrate another hull.\nDrivers.\nBefore obtaining a Super License to drive an F1 boat, drivers undergo a stringent medical and also an immersion test. This involves being strapped into a mock F1 cockpit. The cell is flipped over and the driver has to make his escape while being judged by safety officials.\nCoverage.\nThe series is broadcast live to over twenty countries.\nNeil Perkins (journalist/press officer) works as the H2O Racing content writer and produces reports on all of the events.\nFormula-4s.\nF-4s is the support class of F1 and has been a part of the series since 2010. Every team has one F-4s boat. The class has two single races per race weekend. The boats use a Mercury 60 HP stock EPA engine and reach a top speed around 120 km/h.\nF-4s runs 113 kilo 4 stroke motors rev-limited to 6250 RPM on very short tunnels. The top speed in competition is 120 km/h.\nRelated series.\nThe USF1 Powerboat Tour is a domestic US-based competition using powerboats that are very similar to those in the F1H2O World Championship. For some years the series co-existed alongside the Mercury-supported ChampBoat series which was formed in 2002 but which had ceased to exist by 2013. Terry Rinker dominated the ChampBoat series with four titles in 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2008.\nAdditional domestic F1 powerboat championships have been held in Australia, Argentina and South Africa."

        "title": "Equestrian events at the Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Equestrian sports were first included in the Olympic Games in the Summer Olympics of 1900 in Paris. They were again included in 1912, and have been included in every subsequent edition of the Games. The Olympic equestrian disciplines are dressage, eventing, and show-jumping. In each discipline, both individual and team medals are awarded. Women and men compete on equal terms.\nTogether with the equestrian component of Modern Pentathlon, it is the only Olympic event that involves animals. The horses are considered to be athletes as much as the riders.\nThe international governing body for equestrian sports is the Fédération Équestre Internationale. The first Olympics held under its authority were in 1924.\nHistory.\nParis Games.\nEquestrian events were first held at the 1900 Paris Olympic Games, although it did not include any of the disciplines seen today. There were 4 different equestrian events jumping, high jump, long jump, and mail coach.\nThe polo competition consisted of 4 teams made up of players from Britain, France, Mexico, Spain, and the United States.\nGrand Prix Jumping, which was similar to today's show jumping event, for which 45 competitors entered, though only 37 competed. The first and second place was taken by riders from Belgium (1. Aimé Haageman on Benton, Illinois, 2. Georges van der Poële riding Winsor Squire), while a French rider, Louis de Champsavin, on his mount Terpsichore, got the third place.\nThe High Jump competition resulted in a tie between French rider Dominique Gardere on Canela and Italian Gian Giorgio Trissino on Oreste, with both of their horses clearing 1.85 meters, and the bronze was given to Constant van Langendonck of Belgium, whose mount, Extra Dry, cleared 1.70 meters. However, Constant van Langendonck and Extra Dry were able to clinch the gold in the Long Jump competition, clearing a distance of 6.10 meters. Trissino and Oreste won the silver, clearing 5.70 meters, and M. de Bellegarde of France won the bronze with the 5.30 meter jump by his mount Tolla.\nReturn of equestrian competition.\nEquestrian competition was dropped from the 1904 Olympic Games, and owed its return to Count Clarence von Rosen, Master of the Horse to the King of Sweden, for bringing it back. The 1906 IOC Congress agreed to his proposal to add dressage, eventing, and show jumping to the program of the upcoming 1908 Olympic Games in London. However, due to problems with the newly formed International Horse Show Committee, they were not introduced until the 1912 Games in Stockholm and only a polo event was held in 1908. These three disciplines would be held at every Summer Olympic Games through to the present day.\nParticipation of non-officers and women.\nUntil the 1952 Summer Olympics, only commissioned military officers and \"gentlemen\" were permitted to compete in the Olympic equestrian disciplines, which had the effect of excluding all women and all men serving in the military but not holding officers' commissions.\nIn 1952, however, all men were permitted to compete in all equestrian disciplines, and women were permitted to compete in Dressage. Women were later permitted to compete in Jumping in 1956 and in Eventing in 1964. Since then, equestrianism has been one of the very few Olympic sports in which men and women compete with and directly against one another. In team competition, teams may have any blend of male and female competitors, and are not required to have minimum numbers of either sex; countries are free to choose the best riders, irrespective of sex.\nPolo, driving and vaulting in the Olympics.\nDriving events were included in the inaugural 1900 Olympic Games.\nPolo was also included in 1900 Games, but unlike driving it would be held an additional 4 times: at the 1908 London Games, the 1920 Antwerp Games, the 1924 Paris Games, and the 1936 Berlin Games. The 1908 Olympics had just 3 polo teams, all representing Great Britain. The 1920 Games included a team from Belgium, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States, with Great Britain again winning the gold medal. It was not until 1924, after Argentina sent a team to Paris, that the gold changed hands. Argentina also won gold at the 1936 Olympic Games.\nVaulting was only held once, at the 1920 Antwerp Games. Vaulting included both a team and an individual competition, with the entrants having to perform movements at the canter and at the halt, both with a saddle and bareback. Three nations sent teams: the gold medal-winning Belgium, France, and Sweden. The individual competition was again made up of competitors from only Belgium, France, and Sweden, with Belgium's M. Bouckaert winning gold medal, and the silver and bronze medals going respectively to France's M. Fields and M. Finet.\nDressage in the Olympic Games.\nDressage has changed dramatically since the 1912 Olympics. The dressage horse no longer has to jump, but the test on the flat has become increasingly difficult, emphasizing the piaffe and the passage. Today's horses are specifically bred for dressage and have movement far more extravagant when compared to the horses of the early 20th century.\nOnly individual medals were awarded at the 1912, 1920, and 1924 Games, with team medals awarded at all Olympics following that point.\n1912 Stockholm Olympics.\nThe 1912 Stockholm Olympics held the first Olympic dressage competition, featuring 21 riders from eight countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States). Dressage horses were required to perform three tests: a test on the flat, a jumping test, and an obedience test.\nThe test on the flat could only be a maximum of ten minutes in length and was ridden in what is now called the \"small arena,\" a 20 meter by 40 meter space. The difficulty was much less than it is today, similar to the USDF Fourth Level. The test, as it is today, scored each movement on a 0–10 scale. Required gaits included the \"free\" and \"easy\" walk, the \"slow\" and \"extended\" trot, and the \"slow\" and \"extended\" canter, all of which were to be performed on both reins. The horse also had to demonstrate \"ordinary turns,\" small circles at the slow trot, 8-meter circles at the canter, figure-eights at the canter (both performing a flying change in the center, as well as without a flying change, the second circle being at counter canter), four or more flying changes on a straight line, turn on the haunches, and reinback. At this time, piaffe, passage, and all other haute ecole movements were not allowed (including the airs above the ground and the Spanish Walk). Extra points could be earned if the rider rode with both reins in one hand, especially if this were performed at the canter.\nAdditionally, all dressage horses were required to jump four obstacles which were a maximum of 1.1 meters high, and another fence with a 3-meter spread. They were then asked to perform an \"obedience test,\" riding the horse near spooky objects.\nRiders were required to wear informal uniform if they were military officers, or black or pink coats with silk hats if they were civilians. Horses had to be ridden in a double bridle, and martingales and bearing reins were prohibited.\n1920 Antwerp, 1924 Paris, 1928 Amsterdam, and 1932 Los Angeles Olympics.\n17 riders from 5 countries participated in the dressage competition at the 1920 Antwerp Olympic Games. The test was now ridden required to be ridden from memory, and was held in a slightly larger arena (50m by 20m).\n\"Slow\" was changed to \"Collected\" on the test sheet. Collected walk, trot, and canter were required, as was extended trot posting followed by collected trot sitting. A 5-loop serpentine was introduced, to be ridden at the canter, both with flying lead changes and with counter-canter loops. The counter change of hand with flying changes was also introduced, as was 4-, 3-, 2-, and 1-tempi changes. The halt was performed through the walk, and followed by a salute.\nThe Paris Games had 24 riders competing from nine countries. The test was similar to that used for the 1920 Games.\nThe 1928 Olympics saw an increase in the time allowed for the test, from 10 up to 13 minutes. Riders lost 2 points per second over the time.\nThe most significant change at the 1932 Los Angeles Games was the introduction of the piaffe and passage.\n1936 Berlin Olympics.\n29 riders from 11 countries participated. The test length increased again to 17 minutes.\nThe test included an 8-second halt, half-turns on the haunches at the walk, riding with reins in one hand at the trot, \"ordinary\" and extended trot while posting, a 5-loop canter serpentine with each loop 8-meters in diameter, the canter pirouette, four-, three-, two-, and one-tempi changes, and the piaffe and passage. The highest coefficient for the test was bending on two-tracks at the collected trot and collected canter.\n1948 London Olympics.\n19 riders from 9 countries competed. Due to World War II, there was not sufficient time to prepare the dressage horses for the 1948 Games. Therefore, piaffe and passage were not placed on the tests. However, half-pass, renvers, canter pirouettes, and tempi changes were included, with the highest coefficient on the one-tempis.\nLater Olympic Games.\nToday, the format for the dressage competition begins with a Grand Prix test to determine the winners of the team competition. The top 25 competitors in the Grand Prix then perform a second test, the Grand Prix Special, which is shortened and emphasizes the piaffe and passage. The top 13 of this group then goes onto the Grand Prix Freestyle (first introduced at the 1996 Olympics), which is written by each individual rider according to strict guidelines, and set to music. These scores help determine the individual medalists.\nThe test has remained relatively unchanged, except for the fact that renvers is no longer included in the Grand Prix and Grand Prix Special Classes.\nEventing in the Olympic Games.\nIntroduced in 1912, three-day eventing originally only allowed active military officers to compete, and only on mounts either owned by themselves or by their military branch.\n1912 Stockholm Olympics.\nThe competition was held over 5 days. Day 1 was the Endurance Test, consisting of on roads (with a time allowed of 4 hours, giving a speed of approx. 230 meters per minute), immediately followed by a 5 km cross-country course at a speed of 333 meters per minute. Time penalties were given for exceeding the time allowed, but no bonus points were given for being fast.\nDay 2 was a rest day, before the horses set off on the Speed Test on Day 3, over a steeplechase course that was 3.5 km with 10 plain obstacles, at 600 mpm.\nDay 4 was the Jumping Test (\"Prize Jumping\"), which consisted of 15 obstacles, maximum 1.3 meters high and 3.0 meters wide.\nDay 5 was the Dressage Test (\"Prize Riding\"), which was similar to the individual dressage test that year, except the horses were not required to do figure-eights, flying changes, or the jumping and obedience tests that were required of the dressage horses.\nHorses had to carry at least 80 kg and had to be wearing a double bridle. Riders were required to be attired in informal uniform.\n1920 Antwerp Olympics.\nThere were significant changes in the format for the 1920 Olympics, most notable was the removal of the dressage test. 25 riders from 8 nations competed.\nHorses began on Day 1 with a 45 km roads and tracks test to be completed in 3.5 hours. This was followed by a 5 km cross-country test, with 18 obstacles between 1.1–1.15 meters high, with a time limit of 12.5 minutes.\nDay 2 consisted of a second roads and tracks test that was 20 km, with a time limit of 1 hour. The horse was then examined by a vet, and eliminated if lame or too exhausted to continue. The horse then went on to do a 4,000 meter steeplechase at 550 mpm. Unlike the previous year, speed was rewarded, with riders earning 1/2-point if they rode it at 600 mpm and 1 point if it was ridden at 650 mpm (this system of bonus points was eliminated in 1971). They were penalized 1 point for every second under the time. A new rule was also instituted which eliminated riders after three refusals, run-outs, or falls.\nThe jumping test consisted of 18 obstacles, a maximum of 1.25 meters high, on a 1,150 meter course. There was a 3-minute time limit, again rewarding speed with an extra 1/2-point for every second under the time, adding 1/4-point for every second over. Unlike today's show jumping tests, some obstacles had to be cleared multiple times during the test, at a different part of the fence each time. Riders gained points for refusals, run-outs, falls, and going off-course.\nThe required weight was reduced to 75 kg, where it would remain for several decades. Riders could also wear dark or \"pink\" coats instead of informal uniform attire. All riders had to wear cream breeches and silk hats.\n1924 Paris Olympics.\nThe 1924 Games again changed the format to what would be seen today. 44 competitors from 13 countries took part.\nDressage was held over two days due to the large number of entries. The test was now required to be held in a 20x60 meter arena, and a time limit was instituted (10-minute 30 seconds maximum). Riders had to demonstrate the walk, the \"ordinary\" (working) trot both rising and sitting, the \"slow\" (collected) trot, the extended trot, the \"ordinary\" and extended canter. They also had to show small circles, the halt, reinback, and counter-canter. There was new rule this year that required a double bridle but would not allow martingales, bandages, or bearing reins. Riders could now wear hunt caps in addition to silk hats.\nThe cross-country test on Day 3 was similar to what is now called the \"long format\" test, and was a true endurance test, taking 2 hours, 1 minute, and 47 seconds. It consisted of 5 phases. Phase A was a 7 km roads and tracks test at 240 mpm, followed by Phase B, a 4 km steeplechase at 550–600 mpm, then Phase C, a second roads and tracks at 240 mpm that was 15 km long. The horse then went on the 8 km cross-country test (Phase D) at a speed of only 450 mpm. Unlike today, the rider then had to complete a 2 km canter on the flat at 333 mpm (Phase E, which was abolished in 1967).\nThe 4th day held the jumping test.\n1928 Amsterdam Olympics.\nThis Olympic Games was similar to the 1924 Olympics. A few changes were made, however. In dressage, the time limit was raised to 11 minutes, and competitors lost 2 points for every second over this limit. Endurance day saw an increase in the steeplechase speed from 550 to 600 mpm. Stadium jumping rules changed to specify the course- 12 obstacles to be ridden at 375 mpm, with the competitor losing 1/2-point for every second over time.\nThe format and rules remained relatively unchanged through the 1932 Olympic Games.\n1936 Berlin Olympics.\nThe Berlin Games saw new rules designed to help protect the horse, mostly regarding the use of performance-altering drugs, especially stimulants and sedatives. Additionally, horses that were exhausted or lame following the endurance test were to be eliminated.\nThe weight requirement of at least 165 lbs, previously required for all rides, was dropped for the dressage phase, although it remained for stadium jumping and the endurance test. Scoring of the Stadium phase was weighed to make it significantly less important than the Endurance test.\n50 riders competed in the eventing competition, but only 27 finished, mostly due to one particular fence on cross-country (see Equestrian at the 1936 Summer Olympics).\n1948 London Olympics.\nThe 1948 Games had 46 entrants, including competitors from Argentina, Portugal, and Brazil. Dressages tests now included half-pass at the trot. The endurance test was reduced to 22 km of roads and tracks, a 3.5 km steeplechase, and 8 km on cross-country (a total of 33.5 km).\nOlympics through the 1990s.\nOlympic Games from 1952 to 1996 saw few changes in format or rules. Dressage introduced the single flying change.\nThe Endurance test also saw some changes. Steeplechase speed increased to 690 mpm. Cross-country was shortened by 2 km and required 32–34 fences that were a maximum of 1.2 meters in height and was to be ridden at the heightened speed of 570 mpm. Additionally, the 75 kg required for jumping was reduced to 70 kg for the 1996 Games and abolished two years later.\nWomen were allowed to ride in equestrian events in 1952. However, it was not until Helena du Pont competed for the United States at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics that eventing saw its first woman representing her country.\nThe 1996 Games also provided a testing grounds for new methods of cooling the horses after cross-country, including misting fans, and added an additional hold during Phase C to ensure the horses were cooling properly. Also during this time was an extensive study performed on the event horses at the Games to study the effects of heat and different methods of cooling. These studies provided a great deal of valuable information, debunking several myths, and the results have been useful to horsemen outside of eventing as well. This was the first time where an extensive veterinary study was conducted in conjunction with the Games.\n2004 Athens Olympics.\nThe traditional Endurance test, known as the \"classic format,\" included roads and tracks (Phase A and C), steeplechase (Phase B), and cross-country (Phase D). At the 2004 Olympics, the \"short format\" was introduced, removing phases A, B, and C from the endurance day. This was intended to reduce the amount of space needed to hold an Olympic-level competition, thereby helping to ensure that the sport was not ousted by the IOC from the Olympics. This format has drawn criticism from various members of the sport but is now considered to be the \"standard\" competition format at all levels.\nShow jumping in the Olympic Games.\nIn 1900, show jumping allowed both military and non-military riders (and their mounts) to compete, excluding military school horses. Today, it is open to both sexes on any horse.\nCourses have also changed considerably. Early fences were built more naturally, rather than the brightly colored poles that are today's standard. Fences were smaller, and courses were not as technical.\n1912 Stockholm Games.\n31 riders from 8 countries competed. Each team could have a team of 4 riders with 2 alternates (with the team scoring using only the top 3 riders), and enter 6 riders in the individual competition with 3 alternates.\nThe course consisted of 15 obstacles and 29 jumping efforts- as many of these obstacles were jumped more than once, which is no longer allowed today. The maximum height was 1.4 meters (4.7 feet), water could be 4 meters (7.3 feet) max in width. The course also included a ditch, stone wall, post-and-rail, brush, and triple-bars, and was ridden at a speed of 400 mpm.\nScoring was very different from today, with the riders trying to \"gain\" points. Each jump was worth 10-point, and riders could lose points for various disobediences and mistakes:\nLike eventing, all horses had to carry at least 165 lbs in weight. Riders were required to wear informal uniform if the rider was an officer, a black or \"pink\" coat with silk hat or hunt cap if a civilian.\n1920 Antwerp and 1924 Paris Olympics.\nThe course at the 1920 Games was 800 meters in length with 14 obstacles, all of which were 1.3–1.4 meters high. The water was a maximum of 4 meters in width. 25 riders from 6 countries competed.\nChanges in scoring included:\nThe 1924 Paris Olympics was similar to the Antwerp Olympics, except the course consisted of 15 obstacles. 43 competitors from 11 countries competed.\n1928 Amsterdam Olympics.\n46 riders from 16 nations competed over a 16-obstacle course.\nChanges in scoring included:\n1932 Los Angeles Olympics.\nOnly 11 riders from 4 nations competed (United States, Mexico, Japan, and Sweden), due to the state of the world economy, a continued shortage of quality horses, and the cost of transporting European horses to the United States. The 18-obstacle course consisted of 20 jumping efforts. Maximum height increased from 1.4 to 1.6 meters (5.3 feet). Maximum width of the water increased from 4 to 5 meters (16.5 feet).\n1936 Berlin and 1948 London Olympics.\n18 nations competed over a 17-obstacle course at the 1936 Games, and the gold and bronze medals were determined using a jump-off. The course had 20 efforts, including a narrow gate, open ditch, double oxer, and a wall.\nAll rules stayed the same except for:\nThe 1948 London Olympics had 44 riders from 15 nations competing, including for the first time Brazil, Ireland, Denmark, and Finland.\nFormat, courses, and scoring today.\nThe format of today's Olympic Show Jumping competition is over 4 rounds.\nThe maximum height allowed on today's course is 1.65 meters (5.6 feet), width is a maximum of 2 meters (6.7 feet) for oxers and 2.2 meters (7.2 feet) for triple bars. Water has increased in width to a maximum of 4.5 meters (14.9 feet). The total length is only 500–600 meters, shorter than the earlier years.\nScoring is simpler and has changed to a penalty system, with each rider incurring \"faults.\" 4 faults are assessed for a knockdown or if the horse lands in the water or on its edge. The first disobedience incurs 3 faults and the second results in elimination. Fall of horse or rider also results in elimination. Elimination in the individual competition does not prevent a rider from competing in the team competition.\nLocation of the equestrian events.\nOccasionally, the equestrian competitions have been held away from the main Games. This has occurred at the:\nRules.\nAge requirements\nRiders are required by the Fédération Équestre Internationale to be a minimum of 16 years old to participate in dressage classes and 18 for show jumping and eventing due to the increased risk posed to both rider and mount. All horses must be at least 9. There is no maximum age.\nNumber of horses and riders\nQuotas of horse/rider pairs vary between Games and between each discipline. Currently, each National Federation may enter a team of 4 riders on the jumping team (one of which is a reserve), 5 on the event team (no reserves), and 3 riders on the dressage team.\nDrug rules\nDue to a great deal of drug abuse, drug rules for horses were instituted at the 1972 Munich Olympics (although there was no testing at that Games). Currently, there are very strict rules regarding what drugs may be used on the equine athletes of equestrian competition.\nVeterinary inspections\nAll horses at the Olympics must undergo a veterinary inspection before the Games to ensure they are in good health and not carrying any disease. Veterinary inspections may also occur throughout the Games.\nMedal table.\nSources:\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Updated after the 2020 Summer Olympics\"\nMedals per year.\n\"Note: Dark gray squares represent years in which the NOC either did not exist or did not compete in the equestrian portion of the Olympic Games.\""

        "title": "Jeff Green (basketball)",
        "text": "Jeffrey Lynn Green (born August 28, 1986), nicknamed Uncle Jeff, is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). As of 2023, he has played for 11 NBA teams in 15 seasons.\nA forward, Green played three seasons of college basketball for the Georgetown Hoyas. After entering the 2007 NBA draft, he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Boston Celtics. In 2008, following his rookie season, Green was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. Green underwent successful open-heart surgery in 2012 and continued his playing career. In 2023, as a member of the Denver Nuggets, Green won his first NBA championship.\nEarly life.\nGreen was born in Cheverly, Maryland, to Jeffrey Green Sr. and Felicia Akinkugbe. He was raised in College Park, Maryland and then attended Northwestern High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, where he led the NHS Wildcats to the state basketball championship in 2004.\nCollege career.\nGreen was recruited to Georgetown University by coach Craig Esherick in 2003. Esherick was fired before Green arrived on campus and John Thompson III was hired as the new coach. The two top recruits of Esherick's tenure, Green and center Roy Hibbert, were the key components of Thompson's future success. Thompson stated in a Sports Illustrated interview: \"You'll stop and think when I say this, but it's true: Jeff Green is the smartest player I've ever coached. You would know this better than most: that's a hell of a statement.\"\nGreen won the 2005 Big East Rookie of the Year award along with Rudy Gay of the University of Connecticut. He was named to the All-Big East Second Team in 2006 along with teammate Roy Hibbert. In 2007, Green was named the Big East Player of the Year. He and Hibbert were unanimous selections to the All-Big East First Team. After his 30-point performance in the 2007 Big East tournament semifinal against Notre Dame and his 21-point performance in the championship against Pittsburgh, Green was named Most Outstanding Player of the tournament, as the Hoyas won their first Big East title since 1989. He led the Hoyas to the Final Four of the 2007 NCAA tournament, beating Belmont and Boston College in the first two rounds. Green beat Vanderbilt with a game-winning shot after a controversial no-call in the game's closing seconds as well as fearlessly leading the Hoyas to victory against No. 1 seed UNC in a stunning second-half comeback victory and bringing the Hoyas back to their first Final Four since Patrick Ewing led them to the 1985 National Championship game. The Hoyas eventually lost to Greg Oden and the Ohio State Buckeyes, bringing their remarkable title run to a close as well as Green's collegiate playing career, as he chose to forgo his senior year and entered the NBA draft. Green spent the next four summers taking classes at Georgetown and graduated in 2012 with a degree in English and a minor in theology.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle SuperSonics/Oklahoma City Thunder (2007–2011).\nOn June 28, 2007, Green was selected with the fifth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. He was later traded to the Seattle SuperSonics alongside Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West in exchange for Ray Allen and Glen Davis. On April 6, 2008, Green scored a career-high 35 points against the Denver Nuggets. Green made the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 2008 after averaging 10.5 points, 4.7 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 80 games.\nThe Sonics were sold and moved to Oklahoma City before the start of the 2008–09 season, becoming the Thunder. In January 2009, Green hit his first career game-winner, lifting the Thunder to a 122–121 win over the Golden State Warriors. In the 2009–10 season, Green played and started in all 82 games. On December 1, 2010, Green set a new career-high with 37 points against the New Jersey Nets.\nBoston Celtics (2011–2015).\nOn February 24, 2011, Green was traded, along with Nenad Krstić and a 2012 first-round pick, to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Kendrick Perkins and Nate Robinson. Green recorded a double-double in his first start as a Celtic against the Washington Wizards on April 11, 2011, recording 20 points, a career-high-tying 15 rebounds, four assists and two steals. Green improved his field goal percentage after the trade to the Celtics, shooting 48.5 percent from the floor in 26 games after shooting 43.7 percent with the Thunder.\nOn December 10, 2011, following the conclusion of the NBA lockout, Green re-signed with the Celtics. Eight days later, his contract was voided by the Celtics after a routine physical examination detected an aortic aneurysm. He subsequently underwent heart surgery in January 2012 and missed the entire 2011–12 season. Former teammate Kevin Durant dedicated his season to Green. Green used his downtime not only to rehab from surgery but to complete his coursework at Georgetown, graduating in May 2012 with a degree in English and a minor in theology.\nOn August 22, 2012, Green signed with the Celtics.

        "title": "MAAC men's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The MAAC men's basketball tournament (popularly known as the MAAC Tournament) is the conference championship tournament in basketball for the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC). The tournament has been held every year since 1982, the MAAC's first season. It is a single-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season records. The winner, declared conference champion, receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA men's basketball tournament. The MAAC did not receive its automatic bid from the NCAA until 1984.\nThe tournament has used several formats in its history, though seeding in all formats has been based strictly on conference record (with tiebreakers used as needed). When the tournament began in 1982, the conference had six members: Army, Fairfield, Fordham, Iona, Manhattan, and Saint Peter's. It used a standard single-elimination bracket that gave the 1 and 2 seeds a first-round bye into the semifinals, with the bottom four seeds playing in the first round at the highest seeded team's home court. The semifinals, and championship games were played at the Meadowlands Arena until 1990, when it was moved to the Knickerbocker Arena. The conference used this setup in the 1982, 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1989 tournaments. After the 1989 tournament, each game would be played at a venue chosen by the league. 1982, 1984, and 1985 also implemented a consolation game played by the losers of the semifinal round.\nIn 1984, the conference expanded to eight teams, adding La Salle and Holy Cross, and no longer giving the 1 and 2 seeds first round/quarterfinal byes. In 1990, the conference expanded again, adding Canisius, Loyola MD, Niagara, and Siena to bring the number of teams to twelve. To compensate for this, the MAAC was broken into North and South divisions. 1991 saw the conference lose Army, Holy Cross and Fordham to the Patriot League, thus bringing the total number of members to nine. This tournament setup used an 8 vs 9 play-in game in the first round. This setup continued for two seasons until La Salle left the MAAC for the Mid Western Collegiate Conference, bringing current membership to eight teams again.\nStarting in 1993, the MAAC went back to the previous setup for eight teams, 1 vs. 8, 4 vs. 5, 3 vs. 6, and 2 vs. 7. This system was used until 1998, when the MAAC expanded yet again, adding Marist and Rider from the NEC. With ten teams, a first round play-in format was used, with the bottom four teams playing a first round \"play-in\" game. The 1 seed would play in the quarterfinals against the highest remaining seed from the first round. This format was used until 2003, when the MAAC implemented a new format, and expanded to the bottom six teams playing in the first round, and giving the 1 seed a bye into the semifinals. The reasoning was to place a significant premium on in-season play. In 2007, they ended the change, citing the NIT awarding bids to conference regular season champions who fail to win their conference's tournament championship. Instead of the 1 seed playing the highest remaining seed from the first round, the MAAC used a basic bracket style. 7 vs. 10 and 8 vs. 9 in the first round, with the 8/9 winner facing the 1 seed, and the 7/10 winner facing the 2 seed. This continued through 2013, when the MAAC expanded once more.\nIn the spring of 2014, the MAAC added Monmouth and Quinnipiac from the Northeast Conference, while losing Loyola MD to the Patriot League. This brought the MAAC to eleven members, and the first round was again expanded to include the bottom six teams competing in the play-in round. As of 2022, this is the current system being used."

Aksel Lund Svindal and Giorgio Rocca were each first-time winners in super-G and slalom respectively. Svindal edged Hermann Maier by only 2 points, denying the \"Herminator\" a sixth super-G crown.\nOn the women's side, Janica Kostelić of Croatia won her third overall and slalom World Cup titles. She won 9 races to become only the third skier ever to win races in all 5 disciplines in a single season (joining Marc Girardelli and Petra Kronberger). Kostelić amassed 1970 World Cup points, a new women's record and second only to Hermann Maier's 2000 points in 2000. Although Anja Pärson failed to win her third straight overall crown, she won 8 races while capturing her third giant slalom globe, and her 1662 points would have been enough to win the overall in any of the previous 6 seasons.

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2001 followed the system in use since 1995. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players and elected two: Kirby Puckett and Dave Winfield. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions and selected two people from multiple classified ballots: Bill Mazeroski and Hilton Smith.\nInduction ceremonies in Cooperstown, New York, were held August 5 with Commissioner Bud Selig presiding. \nThe BBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1981 or later, but not after 1995; the ballot included candidates from the 2000 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1995. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2001 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 16, 2001. The ballot consisted of 32 players; 515 ballots were cast, with 387 votes required for election. A total of 3258 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.33 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote (25 votes) would not appear on future BBWAA ballots, and under then-current rules were also eliminated from future consideration by the Veterans Committee. A change in Hall policy later in 2001 restored the eligibility of players dropped from BBWAA balloting for Veterans Committee consideration.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated with a dagger (†). The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The 13 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nJosé Rijo, who received only one vote, resumed his major league career in 2001-2002; he again became eligible on the 2008 ballot.\nBoth selections, Kirby Puckett of the Minnesota Twins and Dave Winfield of the New York Yankees, were late-1980s/early-1990s star hitters. Puckett is best known for leading the Twins to the World Championship before being forced to retire due to glaucoma.\nThe newly-eligible candidates included 21 All-Stars, five of whom were not on the ballot, representing a total of 65 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 12-time All-Star Dave Winfield, 10-time All-Star Kirby Puckett, 8-time All-Star Lance Parrish, 6-time All-Star Don Mattingly and 5-time All-Star Lou Whitaker. The field also included 2 MVPs (Mattingly and Kirk Gibson), 2 Rookies of the Year (Whitaker and Dave Righetti), and one Cy Young Award winner (Steve Bedrosian).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Scott Bankhead, Kevin Bass, Bud Black, Jerry Browne, Steve Buechele, Danny Cox, José DeLeón, Scott Fletcher, Tom Foley, Jim Gott, Atlee Hammaker, Brian Harper, Greg A. Harris, Billy Hatcher, Dwayne Henry, Tim Hulett, Chris James, Bill Krueger, Mike LaValliere, Manuel Lee, Candy Maldonado, Mike Moore, Rob Murphy, Matt Nokes, José Oquendo, Spike Owen, Mike Pagliarulo, Gerald Perry, Dennis Rasmussen, Randy Ready, Franklin Stubbs, Mitch Webster, and Bill Wegman.\nVeterans Committee.\nThis was the final meeting of the Committee on Veterans established by the Hall of Fame in 1953. It met in closed sessions, as always, to elect as many as two executives, managers, umpires, and older major league players—the categories considered in all of its meetings.\nThe older players eligible were those with ten major league seasons beginning 1946 or earlier; those who received at least 100 votes from the BBWAA in some election up to 1992; and those who received at least 60% support in some election beginning 1993. Players on Major League Baseball's ineligible list were also ineligible for election.\nBy an arrangement since 1995 the committee separately considered candidates from the Negro leagues and from the 19th century with authority to select one from each of those two special ballots.\nIt elected two people, second baseman Bill Mazeroski from the 1960s and pitcher Hilton Smith from the Negro leagues.\nThe Board of Directors reformed the system radically with new rules enacted in August. Formerly 15 members appointed to limited terms, the new Veterans Committee would comprise all living members of the Hall and recipients of the Spink and Frick awards to writers and broadcasters. In particular the new members were 61 living Hall of Famers, 13 living recipients of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award, 13 living recipients of the Ford C. Frick Award, and three members of the previous committee whose terms had not yet expired.\nElections for players retired more than 20 years would be held every other year and elections for (managers, umpires and executives) would be held every fourth year. The first cycle for both categories would be in 2002 and 2003 for induction in 2003.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nRoss Newhan received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nFelo Ramírez received the Ford C. Frick Award honoring a baseball broadcaster."

He was the head football coach at Memphis State University—now known as the University of Memphis—from 1975 to 1980. Williamson served as the head coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1990 to 1991.\nCollege career.\nWilliamson was an end under legendary Alabama coach Bear Bryant for the 1961 and 1962 seasons. He caught Joe Namath's first touchdown pass at Alabama. He was one of five players who testified to an Alabama Legislative Committee after \"The Saturday Evening Post\" ran an article claiming that Georgia head coach Wally Butts had conspired with Bryant to throw a football game. Both Bryant and Butts later were awarded money in libel suits against the paper. Williamson was the 55th pick in the 1963 American Football League Draft, drafted by the Boston Patriots, but he chose to stay at Alabama as a coach, helping the Tide win National Championships for the 1964 and 1965 seasons.\nAfter a two-year coaching stay at the University of Arkansas, Williamson returned to Alabama for 1970 to 1971 before leaving for Arkansas again (from 1972 to 1974). Williamson then left for Memphis State University, becoming head coach (1975–1980). Williamson's teams finished 7–4 (1975, 1976), 6–5 (1977), 4–7 (1978), 5–6 (1979), and 2–9 (1980). Williamson was honored with the Southern Independent Conference Coach of the Year award twice. After being fired from Memphis, Williamson spent several years as the executive director of the Bluebonnet Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nWilliamson returned to coaching in 1983, when he was hired as an assistant for the Kansas City Chiefs under new coach John Mackovic. Mackovic was fired following the 1986 season and replaced by special teams coach Frank Gansz, who opted not to retain Williamson. He moved to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, working under fellow former Alabama player Ray Perkins as offensive coordinator. When Perkins was fired late in the 1990 season, Williamson was named interim head coach. He led the team to a 1–2 record to close the season, but the Bucs showed enough promise under his watch that the \"interim\" tag was removed ahead of the 1991 season. The momentum did not last, however. The Bucs never recovered from a 1–8 start and ultimately finished 3–13, the team's ninth-consecutive 10-loss season and their worst record since 1986. Williamson was fired at the end of the season.\nWilliamson was the receivers coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1992 to 1994 under David Shula. Williamson left in 1995 to join the newly formed Carolina Panthers as receivers coach.\nIn 2000, Williamson was named assistant head coach under George Seifert; he was later named offensive coordinator as well, after Bill Musgrave resigned four games into the season. After the 2001 season, Williamson returned to coaching the receivers under new head coach, John Fox. During his tenure with the Panthers, Williamson became known as one of the top receivers coaches in the NFL. He developed Muhsin Muhammad and Steve Smith into Pro Bowl mainstays.\nWilliamson announced his retirement on January 18, 2010, after 15 seasons with the Panthers. He was the last member of the original 1995 staff still with the team.\nPersonal life.\nWilliamson and his wife, Norma, had two grown children, Rich and Caroline. Williamson was living in Charlotte, North Carolina at the time of his death. He died on September 21, 2015."

        "text": "Roger Smith (born 20 January 1964) is a former tennis player from the Bahamas.\nSmith turned professional in 1987. The right-hander reached his highest singles ATP-ranking on 1 August 1988, when he became World Number 96 making him the highest singles ranked Bahamian in history along with Mark Knowles.\nCareer highlights.\nSmith played for Ohio State University for four years finishing his collegiate career in 1986. While a senior, he earned All-America honors. Also, he won the Ohio Inter-Collegiate Championship by besting a scrappy sophomore from Bowling Green State University, Ken Bruce, in a thrilling final 4−6, 6−2, 6−1. Bruce would go on to win the singles title the next year.\n1986.\nSmith played two singles and one doubles matches in Davis Cup for the then Caribbean Davis Cup team in March in a tie against Brazil losing to Cássio Motta in four sets and in doubles partnering Doug Burke in live rubbers. He did not appear in any tour grand prix or challenger events and finished the year ranked (on 29 December) World No. 482 and No. 610T in doubles.\n1987.\nSmith won his next Davis Cup match, in a tie played in Nassau, in four sets over Chilean Robinson Ureta, but lost the deciding rubber to Ricardo Acuña in five sets, as the Caribbean lost in their final tie as a team 2−3. (From then Caribbean nations have competed separately.) Smith reached the finals of the Coquitlam Challenger, partnering Puerto Rican player Juan-Oscar Rios. He reached the second round of the 1987 US Open defeating Marián Vajda before losing to Jim Grabb, and won two tournaments in November – the 1987 Bossonnens Challenger in singles, defeating Alexander Mronz in the final, and the Munich Challenger in doubles partnering Tony Mmoh. The final Nabisco Grand Prix ranking release for the year had Smith ranked World No. 146 in singles and No. 219 in doubles.\n1988.\nSmith went up on World No. 8 Yannick Noah 2 sets to love before losing 14−16 in the fifth in the first round of the 1988 Australian Open. He and partner Paul Wekesa reached the semi-finals in doubles of the grand prix tournament in Washington. The following week Smith famously knocked off World No. 1 Ivan Lendl in the second round of the Volvo International in Stratton Mountain, Vermont, 6−2, 6−3, in a match Lendl, forced by the grand prix tour to play this tournament, seemingly tanked. Smith went on to reach the quarters, losing to Darren Cahill in three sets. This result saw Smith reach his career high singles ranking of World No. 96 making him the highest ranked Bahamian in history alongside Mark Knowles.\nIn October, Smith and Wekesa won the Tel Aviv Challenger, defeating Patrick Baur and Mronz. Roger finished the year World No. 154 in singles and No. 148 in doubles.\n1989.\nIn his second tournament of the year, Smith reached the semi-finals of Auckland Outdoor grand prix event, defeating home country favourite Kelly Evernden in the quarters before falling to World No. 26 Amos Mansdorf. At the Australian Open, Smith managed to take the second set before losing in four to World No. 5 Stefan Edberg. The following month, Smith helped the Bahamas Davis Cup team win their first-ever tie, 5−0 over Venezuela. Smith handily defeated Juan Carlos Bianchi in the first rubber before combining John Farrington to win the doubles 10−8 in the fifth. (Farrington was chosen over a then still 17 years of age Mark Knowles, who won the second singles rubber). In April, the Bahamas equalled this success, winning 5−0 over the Dominican Republic, as Smith again won the first rubber and the doubles partnering Farrington. In May he competed for the first time in the main draws at Roland Garros, losing soundly in straight sets to an up-and-coming Michael Stich, and in doubles partnering Brad Pearce. In his next tournament however, the Bristol Open, Smith and partner Nduka Odizor reached the semi-finals. Despite going winless in grand prix events, he continued to have success in doubles during the North American hard court season, reaching the semi-finals of the Player's International in Canada and the third round of the US Open, on both occasions partnering Frenchman Jean-Philippe Fleurian. Then in October playing with Todd Nelson, Smith reached the finals of the grand prix event in Toulouse and the semi-finals in Vienna. Then in November Smith finally found success in singles, winning the Bossonnens Challenger, for the second time in three years. In the final he defeated future World No. 2 Petr Korda in three sets. On 18 December, Smith was World No. 187 in singles and No. 95 in doubles.\n1990.\nSmith defeated Evernden for a second time before losing to World No. 5 Edberg in three sets at the Lipton International in March. In doubles the week prior, he and Todd Nelson reached the final of the Martinique Challenger. At Key Biscayne, the same partnership went out in the second round. In July in Davis Cup, the Bahamas disappointingly lost to Barbados 1−4. Smith was upset by World No. 1048 Richard Ashby in straight sets in the first rubber, while in the crucial doubles rubber Smith and Farrington lost to Ashby and Bernard Frost 4–6 in the fifth.\nAfter not getting past the second round in doubles in events leading up to August, Smith and partner Shane Burr reached the quarters in New Haven Grand Prix before reaching the quarters of the US Open playing alongside Andrew Castle. Smith's success in doubles continued as he and partner Otis Smith reached the finals in his next tournament, the Coquitlam Challenger in September. In Brazil in October/November, Smith won the Rio de Janeiro Challenger, reached the finals of the Ilheus Challenger, and the semis in São Paulo and Itaparica, all partnering Swede Tobias Svantesson. Then in Bossonnens, Smith won again, this time playing with Michiel Schapers. In singles he reached the quarter-finals in Rio de Janeiro and Bossonnens, but otherwise had an uneventful year. He finished 1990 World No. 261 in singles and No. 78 in doubles.\n1991.\nSmith's high doubles ranking allowed him to compete in all the big tournaments of the Australian tennis season, the American indoor season, outdoors in Florida, and the European clay court season, but he and partners Castle (2), Odizor (1), Tomás Carbonell (1), Svantesson (7), and Shelby Cannon (1) failed to get past the second round until he and Cannon reached the semis in Bologna in May. They lost in the first round of the French and then Smith and Schapers did likewise at Wimbledon.\nSmith redeemed himself from the previous year's disappointment in Davis Cup by first winning all three of his live rubbers to see the Bahamas past Costa Rica 4−1 in February. The following month saw a rematch with Caribbean rival Barbados, played at Carnival Crystal Palace. Smith opened with an easy win over Lionel Eli before Farrington lost in four sets to Ashby. Ashby and Frost won the doubles over Smith and Farrington, 14–12 in the fifth, to give the visitors a 2–1 match lead. Smith next defeated Ashby 7–5, 7–5, 5–7, 6–4, leaving Farrington to beat the unheralded Eli, but not before some drama, 6–2, 5–7, 6–7, 6–4, 6–4. The Bahamians run would come to an end at the hands of Colombia in July on red clay in Cali. Although Smith and Farrington managed to take the doubles rubber in straight sets, Maricio Hadad beat Smith in the opening rubber in four sets while Álvaro Jordan beat Roger in five in the deciding fourth rubber.\nSmith's poor run continued during the summer and it was not until September that he won a tournament, in Brasília partnering Cannon. Here Smith saw his first singles action (in a tournament main draw, at any rate), reaching the third round. In earlier October he and Cannon reached the final of the Ponte Vedra Challenger. Smith again played October on the Brazilian challenger circuit, in doubles, but lost in each tourney in the first round. In singles, once again, playing in Bossonnens brought him fortune, as he reached the semi-finals. In December at the Guan Challenger he reached the quarters. On 23 December, Smith's ATP singles ranking was World No. 307 whilst in doubles he was No. 104.\n1992.\nAfter opening the year with a first round doubles loss at the Australian Open, Smith helped the Bahamas defeat the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States 4−1 and then Peru 3−2, to begin a run that would see the tiny Caribbean nation reach World Group Qualifying Round in the autumn of 2003. The win over OECS was not an easy one as it took Smith four sets to dispatch with Gavaskar Williams in the opening rubber. Farrington lost the next match in five sets to Vernon Lewis but redeemed himself as he and Smith took the doubles rubber in four. Smith then needed to be on top of his game to defeat Lewis 6−2 in the fifth. The following month saw Smith the hero as he won the fifth and deciding rubber, handily as it turned out, over Carlos di Laura. Things started badly however as Smith lost the opening match to tour veteran Jaime Yzaga, as he surrendered a two sets to one lead. The now 20-year-old Mark Knowles took the second handily over Di Laura before teaming with Smith to easily defeat the Peruvians in doubles 3, 2, and 3. Knowles was forced to retire up 2 sets to 1 on serve in the fourth, leaving Roger to mop up for the win.\nOn tour, Smith continued a run of first and second round defeats in doubles while in singles he managed to reach one final before July, the Itu Challenger in Brazil, which he lost to Robbie Weiss. July saw the Bahamas next Davis Cup tie and success, as they defeated Venezuela in Caracus 5−0. Smith easily defeated the home side's second choice Maurice Ruah 2, 3, and 1 while the fast emerging Knowles handled former Wimbledon junior champion Nicolás Pereira 2, 3, and 4. Smith and Knowles then wrapped the win up taking the doubles rubber over Ruah and Pereira in four sets. The end of July saw Smith qualify for the main singles draw at the 1992 Summer Olympics, where he was defeated in the first round by Russia's Andrei Cherkasov. In doubles, he and Knowles lost in five sets to the top-seeded team of John Fitzgerald and Todd Woodbridge.\nSmith and Knowles played the next two weeks on tour as a team, reaching the finals at the Pescara Challenger and the second round of the Segovia Challenger, while in singles in the later tournament Smith reached the quarters. The following week Smith and partner Roberto Saad the final of the Istanbul Challenger. Two weeks later at Flushing Meadows Smith and partner Wekesa lost in the opening round. During the autumn he reached three semi-finals however, partnering Knowles, Daniel Marcos, and Wekesa respectively. He finished the year strongly in singles reaching the final of the Kuala Lumpur-2 Challenger to Chris Wilkinson and in the semis in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Smith was on the last ranking release for the year World No. 175 in singles and No. 198 in doubles.\n1993.\nSmith began the year smartly reaching the final of the Wellington Challenger in doubles partnering Knowles and the second round in singles. In February Smith won two of three rubbers he competed in as the Bahamas upset Chile in Santiago 3−2. He opened with a straight sets win over Felipe Rivera while Knowles retired from his match against Sergio Cortés while up two sets to one and 2–1 in the fourth. Smith and Knowles won the doubles however, handily, 2, 1, and 3. Smith, however, lost his next rubber, to Cortes 3−6, 1−6, 3−6. This left Knowles to be the hero, as he dismissed Rivera easily 2, 3, and 1. This win allowed the Bahamas to reach America Group 1 semi-finals against Uruguay the following month, with the winner advancing to play the World Group qualifying round, to be played in September. Smith got matters rolling with a decisive win of Diego Pérez in the opening match. In the second rubber Knowles eked out a 5-set win over Uruguay No. 1 Marcelo Filippini. The two Bahamian stars then wrapped the tie up winning the doubles in four sets.\nSmith reached the first or second round in a handful of challenger events before taking June off. In July, a refreshed Smith reached the semi-finals of the Aptos Challenger, losing in that round to a young Patrick Rafter. In August he and partner Jean-Philippe Fleurian won the Istanbul Challenger, while the following week in Segovia Smith and Maurice Ruah reached the final. Then in early September he and Bryan Shelton won the doubles title of the Azores Challenger. To qualify for the Davis Cup 1994 World Group the Bahamas needed to upset the Andre Agassi-led U.S. away, in a tie held in late September in Charlotte, North Carolina. The opening tie pitted Agassi and Smith with the later coming up second best 2−6, 2−6, 3−6. In the second rubber, Knowles was up two-sets to one on MaliVai Washington when, again, he retired from the match. This meant the Bahamian tandem needed to win the doubles match to keep their faint hopes for an upset alive. They took the first set in a tie-break but succumbed in four.\nSmith bounced back from the Davis Cup disappointment to reach the finals of the Monterrey Challenger, partnering Frenchman Fleurian. The following week he reached the semi-finals of the Ponte Vedra Challenger, while one week later he reached the semis of the Caracas-3 Challenger. Smith finished the year strongly reaching the semi-finals of the Hong Kong Challenger, partnering Kenny Thorne. The final ATP ranking release had him at No. 224 in singles and No. 132 in doubles.\n1994.\nSmith began the year by qualifying for the Australian Open and losing in the first round against 10th seed Magnus Gustafsson in a five-set thriller 6–3, 5–7, 2–6, 6–2, 2–6. After playing in two more ATP tournaments in Mexico and Miami, he solely played ATP challenger events from March to August with his best result coming at the Puerto Vallarta Challenger where he made the semifinals.\nAfter failing to qualify for the French Open and Wimbledon, Smith returned to the tour at the Canada Masters where he won his first round match but lost in the second round to 14th seed MaliVai Washington in three sets. After playing in New Haven where he lost to world No. 8 and eventual champion Boris Becker, he qualified for the US Open in what would be the best result of his career. He won the first and second rounds to play the defending champion and world No. 1 Pete Sampras in the third round. He surprisingly won the opening set but lost the next three set to lose the match 6–4, 2–6, 4–6, 3–6.\nSmith would finish the rest of the year by playing in more challenger events with his best result coming at his last tournament of the year at the Sao Luis Challenger where he made the final but lost in three sets. He also made the finals of the doubles draw partnering João Cunha e Silva and won in three sets which would be his best doubles result of the year.\n1995–2002.\n1995 saw a severe dip in form and rankings for Smith in both singles and doubles. His singles ranking dropped from 161 at the beginning of the year to 743 at the end of the year and he failed to make one challenger final in both singles and doubles.\nIn 1996, Smith won his third and last doubles title at the Shanghai Open once again partnering fellow Bahamian Mark Knowles where they beat 2nd seed Jim Grabb and Michael Tebbutt in the final in three sets. In doubles that year, he would also make the third round of the US Open partnering Shelby Cannon and win the last challenger title of his career at the Tanagura Challenger.\nIn 1997, Smith played both his last singles and doubles ATP tournaments. His last singles came at the Japan Open after he qualified for the main draw but lost in the first round to fellow qualifier Olivier Delaître in three sets. His last doubles match came after he played in a few more ATP doubles tournaments in 1997 including the US Open, his last grand slam, and the Presidents Cup where he and German Karsten Braasch made the semifinals as the top seed. He played his last ATP doubles tournament and ATP tournament in both singles and doubles at the Romanian Open where he partnered Jeff Tarango and lost in the first round to Luis Lobo and Javier Sánchez in straight sets.\nFrom 1998 to 2000, Smith would only play in Davis Cup matches. He dropped out of the ATP rankings in singles in August 1998 and doubles in November 1998. He received a wildcard into the qualifying draw of the 1999 US Open but lost in the first round to 31st seed Christian Vinck in straight sets.\nIn May 2002, Smith played his last singles tournament at an ITF tournament in Jamaica where he won his first round match against Ryan Russell in straight sets but lost in the next round to a young Gilles Müller in three sets. One month later in June, he played his last doubles tournament and last career tournament in both singles and doubles. He partnered American Kiantki Thomas and made the semifinals before losing to Luke Bourgeois and Alun Jones in straight sets. The results did put him back into the ATP rankings in both singles and doubles, but he dropped out of both in May and June 2003."

        "title": "Grand Slam (rugby union)",
        "text": "In rugby union, a Grand Slam occurs when one team in the Six Nations Championship (or its Five Nations predecessor) beats all the others during one year's competition. This has been achieved 42 times in total, for the first time by Wales in 1908, and most recently by the Irish team in 2023. The team with the most Grand Slams is England with 13.\nIt can also apply to the U20 and Women's Six Nations Championships.\nIn another context, a Grand Slam tour refers to a touring side – South Africa, Australia or New Zealand – which plays fixtures against all four home nations (England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales) during their tour. If the tourists win all of those matches, they are said to have achieved a Grand Slam. This has been done nine times, first by South Africa in 1912–13, and most recently by New Zealand in 2010.\nFive and Six Nations Grand Slams.\nIn the annual Six Nations Championship (among England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy), and its predecessor the Five Nations Championship (before Italy joined in 2000), a Grand Slam occurs when one team beats all of the others during one year's competition. The Grand Slam winners are awarded the Six Nations trophy (as tournament winners), but there is no special grand slam trophy – the Grand Slam is an informal honour recognising a Championship-winning team which has won all their games.\nA Grand Slam was therefore available in a total of 97 seasons to date. Grand Slams have been achieved 42 times – 13 by England, 12 by Wales, 10 by France, 4 by Ireland and 3 by Scotland. (Italy, involved in the tournament since 2000, have yet to win a Grand Slam.)\nTwo consecutive Grand Slams have been won by Wales in 1908–1909, by England in 1913–1914, 1923–1924 and 1991–1992, and by France in 1997–1998. No team has yet achieved three consecutive Grand Slams.\nPrior to 2000, each team played four matches, two at home and two away from home. Following the inclusion of Italy in 2000, each team plays five matches, two at home and three away in one year, and the opposite in the following season. When Wales won the Grand Slam in 2005, it was the first time that the feat had been achieved by a team that had played more matches away than at home. This was repeated by Ireland in 2009 and 2023, by England in 2016, and by Wales in 2019.\nSince 2017, the Six Nations Championship has used bonus points. A team that wins the Grand Slam will get three bonus points. This eliminates the possibility of a Grand Slam winner losing the championship on bonus points.\nThe introduction of bonus points has also led to the possibility of a team achieving a Super Grand Slam or Perfect Grand Slam of five bonus point wins. To date, no team has achieved this feat. A related concept is the Simple Grand Slam or Boring Grand Slam, where a team wins all five of their games without achieving a four try bonus in any of them. Wales achieved this feat in 2019. \nTable of Grand Slam winners.\n\"* In 1908 and 1910 matches with France were played, although they were not part of the Championship.\"\nGrand Slam tours.\nA Grand Slam tour is one in which a touring national team from , , or plays Test matches against all four home nations (, , and ). If the tourists win all four of these games, they are said to have achieved a Grand Slam.\nSome Grand Slam tours also include a Test match against ; South Africa achieved a \"Five Nations Grand Slam\" in 1912–13 and 1951–52.\nGrand Slams by touring teams have been achieved nine times: four times each by South Africa and New Zealand, and once by Australia.\nAustralia is the only country to have lost against all four home nations during a Grand Slam tour, on their 1957–58 tour. Australia also lost to France on that tour.\nAfter 1984, Southern Hemisphere sides started to tour the British Isles more frequently, but to play fewer Tests on each tour, and thus there were no Grand Slam tours between 1984 and 1998. However, since 1998 Grand Slam tours have again become quite common, as the number of Tests on each tour has increased. The All Blacks' tours of 2005 and 2008 were originally planned to include only three Test matches; the late inclusion of matches against Wales and England respectively turned these into Grand Slam tours."

        "text": "The Royal Adelaide Golf Club (often referred to as Seaton) is a private Australian golf club located in the Adelaide suburb of Seaton, northwest of the city centre.\nThe links at Seaton has been the venue for many international and interstate matches and championships. Royal Adelaide has hosted the Australian Open nine times, most recently in 1998 when Greg Chalmers took home the trophy, carding an even-par 288. The Women's Australian Open was first played at the course in December 1994, won by Annika Sörenstam, and returned in February 2017 where it was won by Jang Ha-na. It has also hosted the Australian Amateur 19 times, the South Australian Open 13 times, and the Adelaide Advertiser Tournament 10 times.\nThe course record was originally established by American Marty Bohen in 1977. Bohen shot a 63 (−10) during the final round of the 1977 South Australian Open.\nClub history.\nThe first golf club in Adelaide was founded in 1870 by David Murray MP, John Lindsay MP, John Gordon, J. T. Turnbull, George and Joseph Boothby and around 15 others. The Governor, Sir James Fergusson was club patron. An inaugural game of 14 holes (7 holes played twice) was played on the Adelaide Racecourse (later renamed Victoria Racecourse) on 15 May 1870, when Lindsay and John Gordon tied for first place. A nine-hole course was laid out and a greenkeeper appointed, but when Fergusson was recalled in 1873, membership in the Adelaide Golf Club declined and folded around 1876.\nRoyal Adelaide Golf Club was founded in August 1892 on the North Parklands. In 1906, the Golf Club was moved to land in Seaton, a northwest suburb of Adelaide. The western boundary along Frederick Road is approximately a mile (1.6 km) east of the shore of Gulf St Vincent."

        "text": "Boxing gloves are cushioned gloves that fighters wear on their hands during boxing matches and practices. Unlike \"fist-load weapons\" (such as the ancient cestus) which were designed as a lethal weapon, modern boxing gloves are non-lethal, designed to protect both the opponent's head and the fighter's hand during a bout. Sparring and other forms of boxing training have their own specialized gloves.\nHistory.\nAncient Middle-Eastern and Egyptian depictions of boxing showed contests where fighters had a band supporting the wrist. Early depictions of gloves in boxing date back to Minoan Crete . The use of hand protection in fighting contests undertaken for sport has been known since Ancient Greece. However, the gloves were very different from those of modern boxing, as was the sport itself. In Ancient Greece, it was common practice to tie strips of leather round the hands for protection. In Roman times, this developed into the gladiatorial cestus, with metal added to the gloves to inflict greater damage. The oldest surviving example of boxing gloves date to around AD 120, coming in the form of two non-matching leather bands that were recovered from excavations at the Roman fort of Vindolanda. The brutality of the sport caused the boxing to be banned in AD 393.\nBoxing experienced a revival in Britain around the 17th century. Many bouts were fought with bare knuckles and with no standard rules until Jack Broughton introduced boxing rules known as Broughton's Law in the 18th century, where the gloves were used for practice purposes only. However, many boxers still chose to fight with bare knuckles until 1867 when gloves were mandated by the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.\nModern boxing gloves started showing up towards the end of the 1890s. Over one hundred years of engineering and testing by some of the biggest boxing manufacturers and sport names have helped create safe, durable equipment. Modern boxing gloves include mesh palm, velcro, leather-based stitching, suspension cushioning and new padding for the boxer. The International Boxing Association approves new designs of gloves according to rules around weight and the amount of leather, padding and support allowed.\nFeatures.\nBoxing gloves usually come with either lace-ups or velcro. In velcro gloves, the velcro acts as a second handwrap that adds more stability to the wrist. Lace-up gloves provide a more snug and secure fit, but unlike velcro gloves, require assistance from another person to lace, and are usually wrapped with tape before the match. Lace-up gloves can be converted to velcro gloves using a hook and loop converter.\nThree types of padding commonly used in boxing gloves are horsehair padding, foam padding or a mix of both. Foam padding gloves use latex and PVC foam with shock absorber. Horsehair gloves last longer than foam padding gloves and are environmentally friendly, but are less protective.\nIn amateur boxing matches, glove color is restricted to red or blue, often with a white \"scoring area\" at the knuckles to help judges see and record points from a proper punch.\nBoxing gloves are worn over hand wraps, which help stabilize the fist area against injuries such as the eponymous boxer's fracture of the fifth metacarpal. The hand wrap is usually made from cotton and is available in either or .\nSafety.\nThe impact of gloves on the injuries caused during a fight is a controversial issue. Hitting to the head was less common in the bare-knuckle era because of the risk of hurting the boxer's hand. Gloves reduce the number of cuts caused, but a report by the British Medical Association concluded that gloves do not reduce brain injuries and may even increase them, because the main cause of injury is acceleration and deceleration of the head, and fighters wearing gloves are able to punch harder to the head. Gloves may reduce the number of eye injuries, especially if they are thumbless, but retinal tears and detached retinas still occur to boxers wearing modern gloves.\nData for the number of fights and deaths from the bare-knuckle era is incomplete, and there were many differences in rules and medical care. Bare-knuckle boxing matches were usually fought until one fighter could not continue, with bouts sometimes lasting hours, and a few fighters dying after they were carried to their mark to restart the fight when they would otherwise have been unable to continue. (The London Prize Ring Rules later specifically stated that a fighter must \"walk to his own side of the scratch \"unaided\"\" (emphasis added) or lose the fight.) Bare-knuckle rules also allowed grappling and throws, and some deaths were caused by a fighter hitting their head on a stone or rail.\nWeighted training gloves.\nWeighted training gloves are sometimes used in order to add resistance to punching exercises. Such gloves standardly range between one and three kg. As their usage over time typically increases the boxer's strength in that range of movement, they are used to increase the speed and power of a punch; in order to achieve this, their usage may be alternated with normal unweighted punching practice. Care is taken that the muscular adaption for the weight does not impair the normal punching action. Light dumbbells are sometimes used on a similar basis to weighted gloves.\nIllegal modification of boxing gloves.\nOn 16 June 1983 at Madison Square Garden, New York City, Luis Resto unexpectedly beat the previously undefeated Billy Collins Jr. An investigation found Resto's gloves had been illegally modified, with padding removed by his trainer, Panama Lewis. As sport journalist Oliver Irish summarized, \"Lewis served two years of a six-year prison sentence for assault, conspiracy, tampering with a sports contest and criminal possession of a deadly weapon (Resto's fists)\".\nInfluence of boxing gloves in other fight sports.\nOpen-fingered and open palm MMA gloves or grappling gloves, which are frequently used in mixed martial arts bouts, are not boxing gloves. Similar to the wrist-supporting, closed-thumb, broken-knuckle \"kempo gloves\" popularized by Bruce Lee's 1973 movie \"Enter the Dragon\", they provide some padding to the person wearing the glove, but leave the fingers and the palm area open and available for intricate wrestling and grappling maneuvers such as clinch fighting, which are illegal in the sport of modern boxing."

        "text": "John Henry (also known as \"Jack Henry\") (born March 14, 1946) is a former American football coach. His National Football League (NFL) coaching career began with the Pittsburgh Steelers during Chuck Noll's final two seasons as head coach (1990–91). \nBiography.\nPrior to his NFL career, Henry was a college coach for twenty-one years with stops at West Virginia University, Wake Forest University, and Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), his alma mater. Henry also coached for three years on the high school level. He is a graduate of Chartiers Houston High School in Houston, Pennsylvania and IUP. He holds a master of science degree from West Virginia University. \nAfter Henry's time with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Henry moved on to coach at the University of Pittsburgh (1993–1995) and with the Detroit Lions (1997–1999). While in Detroit, his offensive line helped Barry Sanders to rush for more than 2,000 yards. \nFollowing his time in Detroit, he signed on with Jim Haslett to coach the offensive line for the New Orleans Saints. During his time in New Orleans, the Saints won a playoff game for the first time in the franchise's history and had a 1,000-yard rusher for five consecutive years, which was also a franchise first. He was then named assistant head coach and run game coordinator in his later years with the club. \nAfter a disappointing playoff loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the San Diego Chargers organization announced that Henry's contract would not be renewed when it expired in February 2009. During the 2006 season Henry's line cleared the way for LaDainian Tomlinson to lead the NFL in rushing as well as setting a new NFL record for touchdowns with 31. \nHenry has retired and settled in Greensburg, Pennsylvania."

Pat is the brother of Greg Hickey.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Brantford, Ontario, Hickey was drafted 30th overall by the New York Rangers in the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft. Nicknamed \"Hitch\", Hickey was additionally drafted 18th overall in the 1973 WHA Amateur Draft by the Toronto Toros, for whom he played his first two professional seasons in the World Hockey Association (WHA). Joining the Rangers for the 1975–76 NHL season, Hickey went on to play 646 career NHL games, scoring 192 goals and 212 assists for 404 points. A popular player during his time with the Rangers, Hickey played on a line with Swedish stars Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson, in part because of his speed and scoring ability.\nHickey was later part of a high scoring line in Toronto, along with Rick Vaive and Bill Derlago.\nPost-hockey career.\nHickey began his financial service career as an account executive with the New York City investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert upon retirement from the National Hockey League in 1985. In 1988, he was appointed general manager of the New Haven Nighthawks, the Los Angeles Kings' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, and was subsequently awarded \"Executive of the Year\" honours in 1992, for his management of an independent franchise and initiation/completion of the AHL expansion plan. For six years, Hickey was active at the ownership level as well as serving the AHL on finance, marketing and NHL liaison &amp; development committees as a league governor.\nHickey has been extensively involved in developing youth outreach programs. He was an early volunteer supporting Dave Wilk who co-founded Ice Hockey in Harlem, an after school program that blends academics and sport. Hickey has played a critical role in developing relationships between the financial services community and the NYR Seeing Kids Achieve, Triumph and Excel (S.K.A.T.E.) Foundation, (now Garden of Dreams Foundation), the Brantwood Foundation, and Ice Hockey in Harlem. Hickey has served on the board of directors of Ice Theatre (of New York) International, Hillfield Strathallan College and is a board member of the New York Rangers Alumni Association, as well as liaison to the NHL Alumni Board of Directors.\nHickey is an investment advisor and registered institutional representative with RBC Dominion Securities and has been based in Hamilton, Ontario for 17 years.

        "title": "John Beckwith (baseball)",
        "text": "John Christopher Beckwith (January 10, 1900 – January 4, 1956), nicknamed \"the Black Bomber\", was an American infielder in baseball's Negro leagues.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Louisville, Kentucky, Beckwith was the younger brother of fellow Negro leaguer Stanley Beckwith.\nMajor league career.\nOver a career that spanned three decades, Beckwith with his signature 38-inch bat, routinely batted over .300 against official Negro league competition. Beckwith got his major league start with the Chicago Giants as a twenty-year-old in 1920. They played as a travelling team, which resulted in two last place finishes in their first two seasons as founding members of the Negro National League. However, Beckwith was a bright spot for the team, batting .285 in 1920 and .371 in 1921. Rube Foster of the Chicago American Giants decided to purchase him for his team after the 1921 season. Beckwith responded by batting .358 in 67 games with 52 runs batted in as the Giants won the league pennant that year. He played one more season with the team, batting .304 in 72 games with 77 runs batted in. In 1927, he unofficially bashed 72 home runs against all-comers (he hit 54 HRs in 1928). Beckwith went to Baltimore in 1924 to play for the Black Sox of the Eastern Colored League. He played 33 games and batted .371. In 1925, he batted .404 in fifty games with fifteen home runs. However, it was not enough to win the batting title, as Oscar Charleston trounced him with an .427 average (he also finished second to Charleston in home runs). It was the first and only time Beckwith finished in the top two for batting. Beckwith played 26 games for Baltimore before being shifted to the Harrisburg Giants in 1926 for 28 games. He batted .332. He stayed with Harrisburg for 1927 and batted .353 in 67 games. He left the league and returned to the Negro majors in 1929 with the American Negro League. He played 56 games (47 with the Homestead Grays and nine with the New York Lincoln Giants), batting .386 with sixty runs batted in. He played sporadically in Negro baseball afterwards, playing two games for the Newark Browns in 1932, one for the Newark Dodgers in 1934, and six for the Grays in 1935.\nBeckwith served as a pitcher on five occasions (with one start), throwing 22.1 total innings and allowing eight runs. The rifle-armed player would start at seven other positions in the field in 3,394 total innings of play, with third base (1,422.1) and shortstop (805) being his primary positions. A dead-pull hitter, Beckwith had one of the quickest bats around. In fact, opposing defenses sometimes employed an over-shift on the infield—a rare occurrence versus a righty. In 1921, the 19-year-old became the first basher to hit a ball over the laundry roof behind Crosley Field.\nBeckwith also took up managing, doing so for three different teams. He managed the Black Sox in 1925 to a 25–18–1 record before being replaced by Pete Hill. In 1927, he went 38–31 for the Giants for a second-place finish. In 1932, he managed four games for the Newark Browns of the East-West League (all losses) before the team folded. In later years, he played for the Palmer House Indians () and Brooklyn Royal Giants ()\nLegacy.\nBeckwith ranked among the Negro leagues' career leaders in batting average, home runs, RBI and slugging percentage (.583). Primarily, he ranked in the top ten in a variety of statistics, such as Wins above replacement (WAR) six times (ranking as high as third in 1925), batting average five times, on-base percentage four times, slugging percentage six times, and home runs seven times.\nStanding 6-foot-3, and weighing upwards of 220 pounds, John Beckwith was one of the mightiest sluggers to ever take the field. Pitcher Scrip Lee, who faced both men, declared that \"Babe Ruth and Beckwith were about equal in power.\" The legendary Ted \"Double Duty\" Radcliffe claimed that \"nobody hit the ball any farther than [Beckwith]—Josh Gibson or nobody else.\" Babe Ruth himself said that “not only can Beckwith hit harder than any Negro ballplayer, but any man in the world.” In one year, he hit a 460-foot blast in Griffith Stadium; the ball would've gone farther had it not been stopped by a 40-foot high sign. Beckwith, who Turkey Stearnes called \"one of my favorite ballplayers,\" made his last known Negro league appearance in 1938. \nBeckwith died in New York City, six days before his 56th birthday.\nExternal links.\n and Baseball-Reference Black Baseball stats and Seamheads "

        "title": "Ray Price (rugby)",
        "text": "Raymond Alan Price (born 4 March 1953) is an Australian former dual-code international rugby union and rugby league footballer. He was nicknamed “Mr Perpetual Motion” for his hard, intimidating style of play in league at lock forward. Price played rugby league for Sydney's Parramatta Eels club, with whom he won four NSWRL premierships, a Dally M Medal and a Rothmans Medal. He also played in State of Origin for New South Wales.\nEarly life.\nPrice was raised in western Sydney and educated at Cumberland High School. He is the son of former North Sydney Bears player Kevin Price, and nephew of Norths and Manly-Warringah test forward Peter Diversi.\nPrice was married in 1976 to Christine Minns of Villawood NSW, they had 2 children together, son Benjamin Price born in 1978 and daughter Kasey Price born in 1980. He has 3 grandsons from this marriage. He was divorced in 1996 after 20 years of marriage.\nPlaying career.\nRay Price began his career playing rugby union for Junior Club Dundas Valley, played senior rugby union for the Parramatta Two Blues, New South Wales Waratahs and represented the Wallabies in seven Tests, as flanker/breakaway, between 1974 and 1975, scoring four tries. One of these was against the New Zealand All Blacks, when, following a wayward penalty kick, Price wrested the ball from an in-goal defender, and scored. During the 1975 England rugby tour of Australia, Price was so intimidating off the back of the lineout, that English flyhalf Alan Old stood more than from the scrumhalf.\nAfter this, Price moved to play rugby league for the Parramatta Eels and was an instant sensation with his courage and high work rate. Although Parramatta lost the grand final that year, Price played consistently well throughout, and he only improved in the following three seasons, maintaining his form even in the fiery and successful assault of the St. George pack in the 1977 Grand Final Replay (which Parramatta lost 0–22). Despite being controversially sent off in the 1978 minor semi-final, it was no surprise when Price was chosen to go on the 1978 Kangaroo tour.\nIn July of that year his international rugby league début in the 2nd Test against New Zealand in Brisbane saw him become Australia's 36th dual code rugby international following Geoff Richardson and preceding Michael O'Connor.\n1979 proved to be Price's finest year, for he won the Rothmans Medal and the \"Rugby League Week\" Player of the Year awards and was established as the premier in Australia, a place he was to hold until the mid 1980s. Although his form at club level never reached quite the same standard of his first four seasons, his high work rate and chasing of Peter Sterling's kicks made Price an integral part of Parramatta's hat-trick of premierships in 1981-1982-1983. Though he had been superseded by both Wayne Pearce of the Balmain Tigers (who had been moved into the second row in test and NSW teams since 1982/83) and Paul Vautin of Manly-Warringah as Australia's premier , Price was still at his best in 1985, winning the Dally M \"Lock of the Year\" for the fourth successive year and the Rugby League Week \"Player of the Year\" award for the second time. That same year, Price became the first rugby league player to win the Order of Australia Medal (OAM).\nWith Parramatta winning their second premiership in succession, Price was an automatic selection for the 1982 Kangaroo Tour. Coached by Frank Stanton, the 1982 Kangaroos went through their tour of Great Britain and France undefeated, becoming the first Kangaroo touring side to achieve the feat. As a result, the 1982 Kangaroos became known as The Invincibles. Price played in the first two Ashes tests against Great Britain and was named Man of the Match in the Kangaroos 27–4 win in the second test at Wigan's Central Park ground. A knee injury would keep him out of the final test against the Lions at Headingley in Leeds as well as the two test series against France. He also played in the pre-tour test against Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby. Australia won its first ever test against the Kumuls 38–4.\nFollowing the enforced retirement of incumbent NSW and Australian captain Max Krilich due to a persistent neck injury in 1983, Ray Price was given the captaincy of NSW for the 1984 State of Origin series. Although Queensland won the series 2–1, there was a strong public push, especially within the Sydney media and from the NSWRL, for Price to be named as Australian captain for the upcoming Ashes series against Great Britain. However, with a view to the future, the Australian Rugby League named Queensland captain (and vice-captain of the 1982 Kangaroos) Wally Lewis as the new test captain. Price retired from representative football following the final test of the 1984 Ashes series, played in front of 18,756 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Australia won the match 20–7 and the series 3–0. Following the game, Price gave his No. 13 (Lock-forward) jumper to Pearce in a symbol of passing the torch.\n1986 was planned to be (and was) his last season with the Eels and he celebrated with an unprecedented fifth straight win of the Dally M \"Lock of the Year\" and a premiership win in the grand final.\nAfter moving into the media with 2UE for two years, Price made a comeback at age thirty-six with English club Wakefield Trinity (Heritage No. 1103). He stayed for one season (1989–90) and played 25 games, scoring 6 tries. However, after one season, he sought and obtained election to the Parramatta board, but his comments about the club's decline in the early 1990s were widely criticised and he lost his place in 1994.\nPost football.\nOn 12 December 2006, Price revealed he was suffering from bowel cancer. He appeared on \"The Footy Show\" on 16 June 2007 and declared that he had beaten the aforesaid cancer. Price married into the Kellett family. Ray Price is retired and lives in Northern NSW with his wife Sandy. He is a regular on the local golf courses and is still actively involved in charity work for organisations, including Men of League."

Grace accepted the offer and became the club's secretary, manager and captain. As a result, he severed his connection with Gloucestershire CCC during the 1899 season. The club played first-class matches between 1900 and 1904.\nThe club's home ground was Crystal Palace Park Cricket Ground in south London. Some of the leading players of the time played matches for the club while continuing to play for their usual teams, among them CB Fry, JWHT Douglas, Albert Trott and Ranjitsinhji. The increase in the importance of the County Championship, Grace's own inevitable decline in form (given that he was over fifty years old) and the lack of a competitive element in the matches led to a decline in attendances and consequently meant the team lost money. The final first-class matches were played in 1904 and the enterprise folded in 1908.\nIn 2004 the club was relaunched by former Essex, Somerset and Leicestershire wicketkeeper-batsman Neil Burns as a mentoring organisation for the development and support of cricketers."

Along the way, the route also passed through Belgium and Spain. It was won by Spanish rider Alberto Contador.\nThe Tour was marked by doping controversies, with three riders and two teams withdrawn during the race following positive doping tests, including pre-race favourite Alexander Vinokourov and his Astana team. Following Stage 16, the leader of the general classification, Michael Rasmussen, was removed from the Tour by his Rabobank team, who accused him of lying about the reasons for missing several drug tests earlier in the year.\nThe points classification, indicated by the green jersey, was won for the first time by Tom Boonen, who had failed to complete the previous two Tours after leading the points classification at times during each. The mountains classification, indicated by the polkadot jersey, was won by Mauricio Soler in his first Tour appearance.\nThe general classification, indicated by the yellow jersey, was closely contested until the final time trial on stage 19. The top three riders, Alberto Contador in the yellow jersey as the leader, Cadel Evans in second, and Levi Leipheimer in third, were separated by only 2:49, with both Evans and Leipheimer recognized as far superior time trialists to Contador. In the end, each rider held his place after the final time trial, but with considerably slimmer margins, as the Tour ended with the smallest-ever spread of only 31 seconds among the top three riders. Alberto Contador also won the young rider classification, indicated by the white jersey, as the best young (under age 25) rider.\nTeams.\nA total of 21 teams were invited to the 2007 Tour de France. Each team sent a total of nine riders to participate in the Tour, which brought the starting total of the peloton to 189 riders. The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place at Trafalgar Square in London, the day before the opening prologue held in the city.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nUCI ProTour teams\nInvited teams\nPre-race favourites.\nAfter the retirement of seven-time winner Lance Armstrong and with Ivan Basso and Floyd Landis not entering the Tour, the bookmakers' favourite to win the 2007 Tour de France was Alexander Vinokourov, who was unable to start in 2006 due to lack of team members, but did win the 2006 Vuelta a España. The main challengers were expected to be the 2006 Tour de France second-place finisher Andreas Klöden; and Alejandro Valverde, who dropped out of the 2006 Tour de France after a crash, but came second to Vinokourov in the 2006 Vuelta a España.\nRoute and stages.\nThe organisers of the Tour and London mayor Ken Livingstone announced on 24 January 2006 that the start of the Tour would take place in London. Livingstone noted the two stages would commemorate the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, saying \"Having the Grand Départ on the seventh of July will broadcast to the world that terrorism does not shake our city.\"\nThe routes for the Prologue in London and the first full stage through Kent, finishing in Canterbury, were announced on 9 February 2006 at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre. This was the first time the \"Grand Départ\" was in the United Kingdom and the third time the Tour visited the United Kingdom, including Plymouth in 1974 and two stages in Kent, Sussex and Hampshire in 1994.\nTour director Christian Prudhomme unveiled the 2007 route in Paris on 26 October 2006. In total, the route covered . The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col de l'Iseran mountain pass on stage 9.\nRace overview.\nDoping cases.\nThe first scandal arrived when it was made public on 18 July that rider Patrik Sinkewitz from the had tested positive one month before the Tour started. Sinkewitz had already withdrawn from the race having incurred an injury during the 8th stage. The scandal was big enough to prompt German TV broadcasters ZDF and ARD to drop their coverage.\nThe Tour was dealt a major blow when the first-place team withdrew from the race on 24 July 2007, after team member and pre-race favourite Alexander Vinokourov from Kazakhstan tested positive for an illegal blood transfusion. Vinokourov's teammates Andreas Klöden and Andrey Kashechkin were in 5th and 7th place respectively at the time.\nAt the start of the 16th stage on 25 July, some teams made a protest against the laxness of the official attitude to doping in the race. After the stage, race officials announced that team member Cristian Moreni of Italy had tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone, and the Cofidis team withdrew from the race.\nSpanish cyclist Iban Mayo tested positive for EPO on the second rest day of the Tour, on 24 July.\nFrench prosecutors wanted to start a legal case against Vinokourov, Mayo and Moreni, and requested the UCI to hand over the doping samples. The UCI refused to give them, and in May 2011 the investigation was stopped.\nOther incidents.\nGerman cyclist Marcus Burghardt collided with a Labrador Retriever during Stage 9. The bike struck the dog on its backside, which buckled the front wheel and threw Burghardt over the handlebars onto the road.\nA second incident involving a dog occurred on Stage 18. Sandy Casar and Frederik Willems were in a four-man break when Casar collided with a dog running across the road, causing both him and Willems to fall. Casar was able to rejoin the break with the help of Axel Merckx despite receiving road rash on his right buttock, while Willems returned to the peloton. Casar went on to win the stage.\nAfter Stage 16, overall leader Michael Rasmussen was fired by his team, , for violating team rules after he told the team that he was in Mexico with his wife in June, then being sighted training in Italy by Italian journalist Davide Cassani. Rasmussen disputed this claim, maintaining that he was in Mexico. Thus, at the start of stage 17 there was no holder of the yellow jersey. Afterward the lead and the jersey were transferred to 's Alberto Contador. Rasmussen later in 2013 confessed to doping from 1998 to 2010, including at the 2007 Tour de France.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were four main classifications contested in the 2007 Tour de France, with the most important being the general classification. The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification was considered the winner of the Tour. There were no time bonuses given at the end of stages for this edition of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awards a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists get points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and is identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organization categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reach the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe fourth individual classification was the young rider classification, marked by the white jersey. This classification was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1987.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team is the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow numbers.\nThe super-combativity award was given to Amets Txurruka. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 9. This prize was won by Mauricio Soler.\nUCI ProTour rankings.\nRiders in the UCI ProTour (therefore not members of the wildcard entries or ) are awarded UCI ProTour points for their performance in the Tour de France. The winner of a stage receives 10 points, second receives 5 points and third 3 points. UCI ProTour points are also awarded for high places in the final classification, with 100 points for the overall winner."

He devised for it the \"man on man\" heat system where just two surfers competed in each heat (where before four or even six was normal). Prior to 1977, man on man surfing was devised and successfully conducted by kneeboarders under the direction of Peter Ware and Peter Berry.

Some sources credit Edward Stratemeyer with writing unspecified books in the series Another source cites John W. Duffield as the author of the last nine books in the series.\nCharacter career.\nJoe Matson began playing baseball when he was just a kid. From then on, baseball was all he cared about. During various school teams he was on, rival players were sore at him but they never gave him any real trouble until he got to high school and college. They tried various things, such as kidnapping and framing. However, the \"villains\" are usually found out. Meanwhile, his mother wanted Joe to go to college, so he went on to Yale. However, \"Momsey\" really wanted Joe to be a pastor, but in truth Joe only went to Yale for baseball. He was picked up by a scout and made it to the minors, and after just one year was sent to the majors. Even though rivals still attempted to \"lay him up,\" and they were almost never found out or arrested. When Joe found out who was causing him trouble, he gave them a good thrashing. He eventually became a great pitcher and hitter, as well as the captain of the New York Giants, who are now the San Francisco Giants. [cite]\nPersonal life.\nBaseball Joe has one sister, Clara. She falls in love and eventually marries Jim, Joe's best friend. Baseball Joe's mother, who he calls Momsey, wishes Joe had higher hopes than just playing baseball, but she changes her mind after she finds out how well paid Joe is.

Coached and captained by Frank Hauff from 1962 to 1965, the Bombers immediately took control of St. Louis rugby, winning the Missouri Rugby Union Championship in their first two years and five out of their first six. From 1964 to 1965 the Bombers were undefeated and shut out all league opponents.\nIn those early days the Bombers played a rugged style of rugby. This was characterized by the coaching philosophy of the day, as quoted from the 1972 Missouri Rugby Union yearbook. \"We would rather teach someone who likes to hit how to play rugby, than teach someone who likes to play rugby how to hit\". \nThe Bombers attracted many talented athletes and rugby players during the 1970s and 1980s, but finished as runner-up to the powerful and now defunct St. Louis Falcon's RFC for most of the two decades. Though the Bombers won several tournament titles during this period, the biggest matches were always against the Falcons. There was never a dull moment when the Bombers and Falcons stepped on the pitch to do battle. The tremendous Bomber tradition of playing hard rugby, supporting your club mates, and having a lot of fun doing it was built during this time. \nIn 1985 the Bombers realized the importance of bylaws to guide the organization. Jim Boggeman, Ron Laszewski and a few others created the St. Louis Bomber RFC bylaws that are used by the club today. \nThe Bombers put one on the Falcons and won a hard fought Missouri Rugby Union Championship in 1980.\n1990s–present.\nTurning the corner in 1988, the Bombers won the first in a string of Missouri Rugby Union Championships, and have won this Championship in every year but three. This includes sweeping 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, divisions of the Missouri Rugby Union in every year except one since 1996. The Bombers have also shown well in the USA Rugby Western Club Championships, winning the Championship in 2001. \nAn exchange program with top-level rugby clubs in New Zealand, such as Auckland Marist and North Harbour Marist, has strengthened the Bombers player ranks over the years. Several Bombers have taken advantage of this opportunity to hone their rugby skills and knowledge, while living in a terrific rugby culture such as New Zealand. At the same time, several Kiwis have made the long trek over the pacific to St. Louis to play hard rugby and just play hard. \nA commitment to compete against the top clubs from across the country, and a strong winning record versus these clubs, keep the Bombers rated as one of the top Rugby Clubs in America.\nThe Bombers are consistently represented on the USA Rugby Western Select Territorial Team and always have players competing for coveted spots on the USA Eagles National Team. Past Eagles include Jim Dierker, Ron Laszewski, John McBride, Chris Schlereth, Danny Fernandez and John Tarpoff. \nJohn McBride has had the challenging and rewarding job of coaching the Bombers after legend Ron Laszewski. During Ron's tenure, the Bombers have consistently performed at high levels.\nThe Bombers have a strong network of alumni in St. Louis and across the country that continue to support and follow the club's activities and successes. Successful on and off the field, the St. Louis Bombers Rugby Football Club continues to grow and improve since its inception in 1962. With dedication and hard work the Bombers strive to compete at the highest levels in American rugby.\nSponsorship.\nThe Bombers have individual sponsorships. These consist of several secondary sponsorships from local and regional businesses."

        "title": "Lonnie Smith (baseball)",
        "text": "Lonnie Smith (born December 22, 1955) is an American former Major League Baseball left fielder. He made his debut for the Philadelphia Phillies on September 2, 1978, and later played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Kansas City Royals, Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Baltimore Orioles. He overcame bouts with drug abuse to become one of the top base-stealers in baseball during the 1980s, with the seventh-most steals. He played on five pennant-winning teams, three of which won the World Series.\nPlaying career.\nMinor Leagues.\nSmith began his minor league career with Auburn in the New York–Penn League in 1974. The following year, he led the league with 150 hits, 114 runs, and 56 stolen bases while playing for Spartanburg. In 1978, he led the league with 66 stolen bases while playing for Oklahoma City and scored 106 runs the following year again with Oklahoma City.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nAfter brief trials with the Phillies in 1978 and 1979, Smith broke into the team's lineup in , batting .339 in 100 games. The Phillies won the National League pennant and defeated the Kansas City Royals in the World Series. Smith's performance was strong enough for him to finish third in the Rookie of the Year balloting following the season. He continued to play well in the strike-shortened season, hitting .324.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nSmith was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in November 1981, for Lary Sorensen, in a deal which eventually netted the Phillies Bo Díaz. Smith continued to hit well in , and to have a good on-base percentage. In fact, 1982 was a high-water year for Smith in several different ways:\nSmith was in the MLB All-Star Game for the only time in his career in 1982. He had a batting average of .307, and on-base percentage of .381.\nHe led the National League with 120 runs scored, which was the only time that he scored 100+ runs in a season during his major league career.\nSmith also set career highs in 1982 with 592 at-bats, 182 hits, 35 doubles, and 257 total bases during the regular season.\nHe also ranked second in the National league with a career-high 68 stolen bases, but he was also caught stealing a career-high 26 times. The Cardinals' manager, Whitey Herzog, had ordered his fastest players to attempt to steal bases whenever possible as part of his strategy for winning.\nAll of the above pushed Smith all the way up to second place in voting for the regular-season National League Most Valuable Player for 1982. That season, outfielder Dale Murphy of the Atlanta Braves won the National League MVP award, tying for the lead in runs batted in and walloping 36 home runs.\nSmith batted a healthy .321 during the 1982 World Series, and he helped the Cardinals to defeat the Milwaukee Brewers, four games to three.\nTowards the end of his first season with the Cardinals, Smith infamously attacked the Phillie Phanatic. Despite his speed, Smith was known for occasionally tripping and falling while running. He attributed this to being \"pigeon-toed\" as a child. During a series between the Cardinals and the Phillies in September 1982, the Phillie Phanatic began mimicking Smith at close range before the game, doing belly-whops on the turf. Tired of the mocking, Smith tackled the Phanatic, reportedly injuring the mascot's ankles. Despite this, Smith was still allowed to play, so when he took his position in left field, Phillies fans started throwing beer bottles at him. Rather than seeking shelter, Smith turned around, threw up his arms, and taunted them, daring them to hit him, which none did.\nSmith continued to play well during , batting .321 (which placed him second in the National League only to Bill Madlock's .323), but in just 130 games, to again draw some MVP votes. However, this baseball season was struck with his first bout with illicit drug abuse, which sidelined him for a month at mid-season during a highly publicized rehabilitation stint at the Hyland Center in St. Louis.\nSmith returned to the Cardinals after his time on the bench in 1983, and he remained with them through the end of the baseball season.\nKansas City Royals.\nSmith was traded to the Royals in exchange for outfielder John Morris on May 17, 1985. The Royals were able to fill their left field spot with Smith; they had lacked an everyday player since the departure of Amos Otis two years earlier. Smith's past met his present following the regular season, when he hit .333 in the 1985 World Series to lead the Royals to a seven-game upset of the favored Cardinals. When Smith took the field in Game 1 of the 1985 World Series, he became the first player in MLB history to play in the World Series against a team that traded him away within the same season.\nPittsburgh drug trials.\nSmith testified in the Pittsburgh drug trials of September 1985. As with other major league players, he was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony. In February 1986, Smith, along with six other players, was determined to have been a prolonged drug user who had also facilitated distribution to other players, and was suspended for a full season. All the suspended players were allowed to continue playing under the condition that they donated ten percent of their base salaries to drug-related community service, submitted to random drug testing, and contributed 100 hours of drug-related community service.\nSmith went on to have his best season in three years in , but saw his playing time reduced during the season.\nIn July 1987, Smith told the \"Kansas City Times\" that under his agreement with the commissioner of baseball, he was supposed to be tested six to eight times per-year but had not been tested so far during 1987. More so, he strongly disagreed with Commissioner Ueberroth that professional baseball was free from illicit drugs.\nFollowing the 1987 season, Smith had trouble finding a new team to play with, and he came to think that then-Royals general manager John Schuerholz had blackballed him. By his own account, Smith was depressed and also addicted to cocaine when he considered murdering Schuerholz, and even purchased a pistol for that purpose. Smith had second thoughts about committing such a serious crime, however, and he dropped the idea entirely.\nAtlanta Braves.\nDuring March of , then-Atlanta Braves general manager Bobby Cox (who would be succeeded by Schuerholz during Smith's time in Atlanta) offered Smith a contract to play there. During Spring training, he made it to the team's 25-man roster, but he batted just .237 in limited playing time that season. However, in 1989, he cracked the starting line-up for the Braves' outfield, and he went on to accomplish one of his best baseball seasons ever. During that season, Smith had a batting average of .315, and also had a career-high total of 21 home runs. Smith also led the National League with a .415 on-base percentage. Smith finished 11th in the voting of N.L. Most Valuable Player, and he was awarded the MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award.\nSmith continued to be a regular outfielder for the Braves during the next two seasons, batting .305 in and .275 in . Smith's play in 1991 helped the Braves improve from their National League West last-place finish in 1990 to winning the National League pennant in 1991, resulting in a World Series appearance for the first time since 1958, when the Braves were based in Milwaukee.\n1991 World Series.\nSmith committed a base-running blunder very late in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series versus the Minnesota Twins. Smith was on first base with no outs in the eighth inning of this scoreless game. Then the Braves' batter Terry Pendleton struck a line-drive double to left field. It appeared that Smith should have been able to score on this hit, but as he was rounding second base he paused, then having to stop at third base. Smith later stated that he had lost sight of the baseball against the ceiling of the Metrodome, though replays from the TV coverage of the game showed that the Twins' second baseman Chuck Knoblauch and shortstop Greg Gagne had potentially deceived Smith; Knoblauch pretended to throw to Gagne for a force, but didn't actually have the ball.\nRegardless of the cause, Smith only advanced to third base. After a ground-out (the runners could not advance) and an intentional walk (which loaded the bases), Smith was forced out at home plate in a double play, leaving the Braves scoreless. The score remained 0–0 through the end of the ninth inning.\nThe Twins went on to score one run in the bottom of the tenth inning, taking the game 1–0, and winning the World Series four games to three. Smith hit three home runs in the Series.\nLater career.\nSmith remained with the Braves through the end of the season, and he helped the Braves win the National League pennant once again, though they lost the World Series four games to two against the Toronto Blue Jays. Smith hit a grand slam in game five of that series.\nNext, Smith departed from the Braves, and he signed up with the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he played one season. He was acquired by the Baltimore Orioles from the Pirates on September 8, 1993 in a transaction that was completed six days later on September 14 when a pair of minor leaguers, outfielder Stanton Cameron and left-handed pitcher Terry Farrar, were sent to Pittsburgh. Primarily used as a pinch-hitter, Smith played in his final major league game on August 10, 1994, in the Orioles' last game before that year's strike. He was granted free agency for the last time the following October 24.\nCareer statistics.\nIn 1613 games over 17 seasons, Smith compiled a .288 batting average (1488-for-5170) with 909 runs, 273 doubles, 58 triples, 98 home runs, 533 RBI, 370 stolen bases, 623 base on balls, a .371 on-base percentage and a .420 slugging percentage. His career fielding percentage was .964. In five World Series and six playoff series, Smith hit .278 (57-for-205) with 28 runs scored, 4 home runs and 17 RBI.\nBaseball historian Bill James wrote about Lonnie Smith's difficulties playing defense. He wryly stated that Smith should have had a post-retirement career teaching (so-called) \"defensive recovery and cost containment\" since he had excelled at recovering from defensive difficulties in the outfield.\nRetirement.\nAfter retiring from pro baseball, Smith married once more, and he and his wife returned to Atlanta to reside. They became the parents of three children. Smith briefly re-entered national attention in 2006, when he told \"The State\", a newspaper from Columbia, South Carolina, about his notion to murder Schuerholz 18 years earlier.\nOn June 18, 2015, sportswriter Jon Bois published a video documentary on Lonnie Smith and his history throughout his career, including the cocaine habits, near murder of Schuerholz, and his redemption with the Braves."

        "title": "The Baseball Network",
        "text": "The Baseball Network was an American television broadcasting joint venture between ABC, NBC and Major League Baseball (MLB). Under the arrangement, beginning in the 1994 season, the league produced its own broadcasts in-house which were then brokered to air on ABC and NBC. The Baseball Network was the first television network in the United States to be owned by a professional sports league.\nThe package included coverage of games in prime time on selected nights throughout the regular season (under the branding Baseball Night in America), along with coverage of the postseason and the World Series. Unlike previous broadcasting arrangements with the league, there was no national \"game of the week\" during the regular season; these would be replaced by multiple weekly regional telecasts on certain nights of the week. Additionally, The Baseball Network had exclusive coverage windows; no other broadcaster could televise MLB games during the same night that The Baseball Network was televising games.\nThe arrangement did not last long; due to the effects of a players' strike on the remainder of the 1994 season, and poor reception from fans and critics over how the coverage was implemented, The Baseball Network was disbanded after the 1995 season. While NBC would maintain rights to certain games, the growing Fox network (having established its own sports division two years earlier in 1994) became the league's new national broadcast partner beginning in 1996.\nBackground.\nAfter the fallout from CBS's financial problems from their exclusive, four-year-long (lasting from 1990 to 1993), US$1.8 billion television contract with Major League Baseball (a contract that ultimately cost the network approximately $500 million), Major League Baseball decided to go into the business of producing the telecasts themselves and market these to advertisers on its own. In reaction to the failed trial with CBS, Major League Baseball was desperately grasping for every available dollar. To put things into proper perspective, in 1991, the second year of the league's contract with the network, CBS reported a loss of around $169 million in the third quarter of the year. A decline in advertiser interest caused revenue from the sale of commercials during CBS's baseball telecasts to plummet. All the while, CBS was still contractually obligated to pay Major League Baseball around $260 million a year through 1993. Before Major League Baseball decided to seek the services of other networks, CBS offered US$120 million in annual rights fees over a two-year period, as well as advertising revenues in excess of $150 million a season.\nAs part of MLB's attempt to produce and market the games in-house, it hoped to provide games of regional interests to appropriate markets. Major League Baseball in the process, hoped to offer important games for divisional races to the overall market. Owners also hoped that this particular technique, combined with the additional division races created through league expansion (the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins had begun play the year prior) and the quest for wild card spots for the playoffs (1994 was the first year of three divisions for each league and would have been the first year for the wild card) would increase the national broadcast revenue for Major League Baseball in the foreseeable future. On May 28, 1993, Major League Baseball's owners overwhelmingly approved a new network television deal without CBS involved.\nAfter a four-year hiatus, ABC and NBC (who last aired \"Thursday Night Baseball\" games and the Saturday afternoon \"Game of the Week\" respectively) returned to Major League Baseball under the umbrella of a revenue sharing venture called The Baseball Network. Under a six-year plan (with an option for two additional years), Major League Baseball was intended to receive 85% of the first US$140 million in advertising revenue (or 87.5% of advertising revenues and corporate sponsorship from the games until sales topped a specified level), 50% of the next $30 million, and 80% of any additional money. Prior to this, Major League Baseball was projected to take a projected 55% cut in rights fees and receive a typical rights fee from the networks. When compared to the previous television deal with CBS, The Baseball Network was supposed to bring in 50% less of the broadcasting revenue. The advertisers were reportedly excited about the arrangement with The Baseball Network because the new package included several changes intended to boost ratings, especially among younger viewers.\nArranging broadcasts through The Baseball Network seemed, on the surface, to benefit NBC and ABC (who each contributed $10 million in start-up funds) since it gave them a monopoly on broadcasting Major League Baseball games. The deal was similar to a time-buy, instead of a traditional rights fee situation. It also stood to benefit the networks because they reduced the risk associated with purchasing the broadcast rights outright (in stark contrast to CBS's disastrous contract with Major League Baseball from the 1990–1993 seasons). NBC and ABC were to create a loss-free environment for each other and keep an emerging Fox, which had recently made an aggressive and ultimately successful $1.58 billion bid for the television rights for National Football Conference games (thus, becoming a major player in the sports broadcasting game in the process), at bay. As a result of Fox's NFL gain, CBS was weakened further by affiliate changes, as a number of stations jumped to Fox from CBS (for example, in Detroit, WWJ-TV replaced long-standing CBS Affiliate WJBK when Fox moved there from WKBD).\nKey figures involved in the creation and production for The Baseball Network:\nThis wasn't the first time that Major League Baseball considered creating its very own television network. Back in 1988, then commissioner Peter Ueberroth contemplated creating an all-baseball basic cable channel that would show as many as four games each night. Ueberroth wanted to set up a national cable package for one or two nights a week without undercutting the value of some teams' local television deals. This of course, would soon happen when Major League Baseball signed a deal to broadcast games on ESPN, but prior to this, Ueberroth envisioned the owners pooling games already being shown on regional pay-television services. Viewers would see (and pay for) the telecast of the team in their market if a game was scheduled; otherwise, they would be sent games of regional or divisional interest. Eventually, baseball could have also shared the channel with the NHL or NBA in the off-season. It wasn't until January 1, 2009 (nearly 14 years since the cancellation of the Baseball Network) that an all-baseball cable channel, MLB Network (created and backed by MLB) would finally come to fruition and would prove to be much more successful than the ill-fated Baseball Network.\nCoverage.\nThe Baseball Network kicked off its coverage on July 12, 1994, on NBC with the All-Star Game from Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. This was NBC's first telecast of a Major League Baseball game since Game 5 of the 1989 National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs on October 9 of that year. The NBC broadcast team consisted of Bob Costas on play-by-play, with Joe Morgan and Bob Uecker as analysts. Costas, a veteran presence at NBC, had been the network's secondary baseball play-by-play announcer behind Vin Scully during the 1980s. Morgan, who was also working for ESPN at the time, had spent two years at NBC in the mid-1980s and two years at ABC from 1988 to 1989. Uecker, the longtime voice of the Milwaukee Brewers, returned to national television for the first time since he worked for ABC in the 1970s and early 1980s.\nGreg Gumbel hosted the pre game show; this was one of his first assignments for NBC after having left CBS Sports following that network's coverage of the 1994 College World Series. Gumbel had also previously served as the secondary play-by-play announcer (behind Sean McDonough) for CBS's baseball coverage, calling the 1993 American League Championship Series along the way with Jim Kaat. Helping with interviews were Hannah Storm (reporting from the American League dugout) and Johnny Bench (reporting from the National League dugout). The 1994 All-Star Game reportedly sold out all its advertising slots. This was considered an impressive financial accomplishment, given that one 30-second spot cost US$300,000.\nPeoria's NBC station WEEK-TV suffered misfortunes of significant transmitter difficulties throughout most of the 1994 All-Star Game, forcing WEEK's signal to be knocked off the air until one hour after the conclusion. The station would later air an abbreviated version of the game the following weekend due to its transmitter problems on NBC's live broadcast.\nABC, meanwhile, was able to have its primary broadcast team from 1989 return intact. Al Michaels served as the play-by-play announcer once again. Tim McCarver, who had just spent four years at CBS, returned as an analyst along with Jim Palmer. On the subject of Michaels returning to baseball for the first time since the Loma Prieta earthquake interrupted the 1989 World Series, Jim Palmer said, \"Here Al is, having done five games since 1989, and steps right in. It's hard to comprehend how one guy could so amaze.\"\n\"Baseball Night in America\".\nAfter the All-Star Game was complete, ABC took over coverage with what was to be their weekly slate of games. ABC was scheduled to televise six regular season games on Saturdays or Mondays in prime time. NBC would then pick up where ABC left off by televising six more regular season Friday night games. Every \"Baseball Night in America\" game was scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. Eastern Time (or 8 p.m. Pacific Time if the game occurred on the West Coast). A single starting time gave the networks the opportunity to broadcast one game and then, simultaneously, cut to another game when there was a break in action.\nThe networks had exclusive rights for the twelve regular season dates, in that no regional or national cable service (such as ESPN or superstations like Chicago's WGN-TV or Atlanta's WTBS) or over-the-air broadcaster was allowed to telecast a Major League Baseball game on those dates. \"Baseball Night in America\" (which premiered on July 16, 1994) usually aired up to fourteen games based on the viewers' region (affiliates chose games of local interest to carry) as opposed to a traditional coast-to-coast format. Normally, announcers who represented each of the teams playing in the respective games were paired with each other. More specifically, on regional Saturday night broadcasts and all non-\"national\" broadcasts, TBN let the two lead announcers from the opposing teams call the games involving their teams together.\nGames involving either of the two Canadian-based MLB teams at the time, the Toronto Blue Jays and Montreal Expos, were not always included in the \"Baseball Night in America\" package. Canadian rightsholders were allowed to broadcast the games. When TSN (which owned the cable rights to the Blue Jays and Expos) covered the games in Canada, they re-broadcast the \"BNIA\" feed across their network. Typically, if the Blue Jays were idle for the day, the Expos would be featured on TSN. Also, CBET (the CBC affiliate in Windsor, Ontario) would air Blue Jays games if the Detroit Tigers were not playing at home that night or if the Blue Jays were scheduled to play in Detroit. Whether or not the game would air in the opposing team's market would depend on which time zone they were from, or if they shared a market with another team.\nAll of the 1994 games aired on ABC; due to the strike NBC was unable to air its slate of games, which were supposed to begin on August 26.\nPostseason coverage.\nIn even-numbered years, NBC would have the rights to the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series while ABC would have the World Series and newly created Division Series. In odd-numbered years, the postseason and All-Star Game television rights were supposed to alternate. When ABC and NBC last covered baseball together from 1976 to 1989, ABC had the rights to the World Series in odd-numbered years while NBC would cover the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series in said years. Likewise, this process would alternate in even numbered years, with ABC getting the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series in years that NBC had the World Series.\nThe networks also promised not to begin any World Series weekend broadcasts after 7:20 p.m. Eastern Time. When CBS held the television rights, postseason games routinely aired on the East Coast at 8:30 p.m. at the earliest. This meant that Joe Carter's dramatic World Series clinching home run in 1993 occurred after midnight in the East. As CBS' baseball coverage progressed, the network dropped the 8 p.m. pregame coverage (in favor of airing sitcoms such as \"Evening Shade\") before finally starting its coverage at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The first pitch would generally arrive at approximately 8:45 p.m.\nABC won the rights to the first dibs at the World Series in August 1993 after ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson won a coin toss by calling \"heads.\" Ken Schanzer, who was the CEO of The Baseball Network, handled the coin toss. Schanzer agreed to the coin toss by ABC and NBC at the outset as the means of determining the order in which they would divide up the playoffs.\nWhat separated The Baseball Network from previous television deals with Major League Baseball, and was by far the most controversial part of the deal, was that not all postseason games (aside from the World Series) were guaranteed to be shown nationally. To increase viewership by preventing games from being played in the afternoon (the league was the only professional sports league in the country to play postseason games on weekday afternoons), the National League and American League's division and championship series games were instead played simultaneously in primetime, and affiliates could only air one game each night, which were again determined regionally. If one playoff series had already concluded, the remaining games would be aired nationally.\nKen Schanzer, The Baseball Network's president said \"We've been given a responsibility to broadcast the games regionally and, within that context, we tried to come up with a plan that makes it as exciting as possible\". On that end, The Baseball Network implemented a strategy that included cutting in to one game with highlights from other games—sometimes between batters, and more often, between pitches. Therefore, viewers watching one divisional series or League Championship Series game would often see action continuing on one reduced screen while a clip from another game is shown on another screen and vice versa. The theory was that by inserting highlights, even live action from other games, into the natural lulls, The Baseball Network could produce an exciting, technology-enhanced experience. Despite the frustration of not being able to see both League Championship Series on a national level, the 1995 LCS averaged a 13.1 rating.\nBesides the 1994 All-Star Game and Game 6 of the 1995 World Series, arguably, the most famous Baseball Network broadcast was Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series between the New York Yankees and the Seattle Mariners, broadcast on ABC. It ended with the Mariners winning in 11 innings (via Edgar Martínez's game winning double), to clinch both their first postseason series win, and their first ever trip to the American League Championship Series. However, because the public would only be permitted to see one postseason game per day, the Division Series between the Mariners and Yankees would only be seen in its entirety by 20% of the country. Meanwhile, 30% could see the Braves-Rockies series, 27% could see the Reds-Dodgers series, and 23% could see the Red Sox-Indians series.\nFor example, in New York City, WNBC-TV broadcast the first two games of the Yankees-Mariners series, while WABC-TV aired the final three contests. In the neighboring Hartford–New Haven television market in Connecticut, NBC affiliate WVIT aired the first two games of the Boston–Cleveland series, but ABC station WTNH would alternate with the Yankees in Game 3, the Red Sox in Game 4, and the Yankees in Game 5.\nIn Ohio, NBC stations in Cleveland, Steubenville, Columbus, Toledo, and Youngstown would get to see the Red Sox–Indians series. Viewers of WLWT in Cincinnati and all other cities would receive the Reds–Dodgers series. The remaining telecasts, on WSYX, the ABC affiliate in Columbus, would be of the Indians series. In South Dakota, viewers would get the Braves-Rockies series, while North Dakotans would have access to the Red Sox-Indians series. Only about 20% of the country in itself, had access of the 15-inning long second game of the Mariners-Yankees series.\nCriticisms.\nA major problem with \"Baseball Night in America\" was the idea that viewers could not watch \"important\" games. Marty Noble put it in perspective by saying \"With the \"Network\" determining when games will begin and which games are made available to which TV markets, Major League Baseball can conduct parts of its pennant races in relative secrecy.\" What added to the troubles of The Baseball Network was the fact that \"Baseball Night in America\" held exclusivity over every market. This most severely impacted markets with two teams, specifically New York City (Mets and Yankees), the Greater Los Angeles Area (Dodgers and Angels), Chicago (Cubs and White Sox), the San Francisco Bay Area (Giants and A's), and to a lesser extent, the state of Texas (Houston Astros and Texas Rangers). For example, if \"Baseball Night in America\" showed a Yankees game, this meant that nobody in New York could see that night's Mets game and vice versa.\nFurthermore, Chicago's NBC affiliate, WMAQ-TV was unable to televise any Friday night Cubs game from Wrigley Field. Even though Wrigley Field had lights installed and was capable of holding night games since 1988, a city ordinance at the time, prohibited regular season Friday and Saturday night games to be played there. The Baseball Network regardless, owned the broadcasting rights to those entire dates.\nThings got so bad for The Baseball Network that even local broadcasters objected to its operations. KSMO-TV in Kansas City, the primary over-the-air station for the Kansas City Royals, went as far as to sue the Royals for breach of contract resulting from their broadcasts being \"overexposed\" and violating its territorial exclusivity. Worse yet, even if a market had only one team, the ABC or NBC affiliate could still not broadcast that team's game if the start time was not appropriate for the time zone. For example, if the Detroit Tigers (the only team in their market) played a road game in Seattle, Oakland or Anaheim beginning at 8 p.m. Pacific Time (a late game), Detroit's Baseball Network affiliate (either WXYZ-TV or WDIV, depending on the network which held the rights to the game) could not air the game because the start time was too late for the Detroit area (11 p.m. Eastern Time). Detroit viewers only had the option of viewing the early game of the night.\n\"Sports Illustrated\" columnist Tom Verducci for one, was very harsh on The Baseball Network, dubbing it both \"America's regional pastime\" and an \"abomination.\" ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson, in announcing the dissolution of The Baseball Network, said \"The fact of the matter is, Major League Baseball seems incapable at this point in time, of living with any long term relationships, whether it's with fans, with players, with the political community in Washington, with the advertising community here in Manhattan, or with its TV partners.\"\nWhile on assignment at the 1993 World Series, CBS Sports broadcaster Sean McDonough told the \"New York Times\" that The Baseball Network's strategy of regionalizing the playoffs irked him because with both League Championship Series now being played simultaneously, no market would be able see both games; rather, the two playoff series would be regionalized into areas of natural interest. The only exception would be Games 6 and 7 of the two series, which would have staggered starting times. McDonough said that certainly didn't account for people who move. McDonough added that if a Boston native like him moved to Atlanta and the Red Sox were in the playoffs (which would incidentally, actually happen under the watch of The Baseball Network in 1995), then it was too bad. He also believed that his call of Sid Bream's slide to clinch the National League pennant for the Atlanta Braves in Game 7 of the 1992 National League Championship Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, wouldn't have had the impact if you couldn't see the whole game, to see what led up to it. To put things into further perspective, McDonough believed that even with a staggered starting time from the American League Championship Series game, many fans would not have seen parts of Game 7 of the 1992 NLCS had it been broadcast under The Baseball Network's regionalized plan.\nShortly after the start of the strike, Stanford University's Roger Noll argued that the Baseball Network deal (and the bargain-basement ESPN cable renewal, which went from $100 million to $42 million because of their losses) reflected \"poor business judgment on the part of management about the long-run attractiveness of their product to national broadcasters.\" He added that the $140 million that owners expected to share for the 1994 season (before the strike) from TBN was underestimated by \"one-third to one-half\" and fell below the annual average of $165 million needed to renew the TBN deal after two years. Meanwhile, Andy Zimbalist, author of \"Baseball and Billions\", and a players' union consulting economist, insisted that baseball could have done better than the TBN deal with some combination of CBS (which offered $120 million last-ditch bid for renewal), Fox and TBS. Baseball shut out CBS and could have waited longer before closing them out.\"\nFive years after The Baseball Network dissolved, NBC Sports play-by-play announcer Bob Costas wrote in his book \"Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball\" that The Baseball Network was \"stupid and an abomination.\" Costas further wrote that the agreement involving the World Series being the only instance of The Baseball Network broadcasting a nationally televised game was an unprecedented surrender of prestige, as well as a slap to all serious fans. He also acknowledged that the most impassioned fans in baseball were now prevented from watching many of the playoff games that they wanted to see, as all playoff games had been broadcast nationally for decades. Costas added that both the divisional series and the League Championship Series now merited scarcely higher priority than regional coverage provided for a Big Ten football game between Wisconsin and Michigan. When Costas was preparing call the 1995 American League Division Series between Boston-Cleveland for NBC, he told the \"New York Times\" that \"It's baseball's objective to market itself nationally, but TBN makes it a local sport.\" Costas added \"Baseball says the wild card is supposed to save baseball, but TBN shows you as little as possible.\"\nAccording to Curt Smith's book, \"The Voice – Mel Allen's Untold Story\", the longtime New York Yankees broadcaster and \"This Week in Baseball\" host was quoted as saying \"You wonder how anything would be worse [than CBS]. What kind of show cancels a twenty-six-week-season's first fourteen weeks?\" (in response to TBN's tagline, \"Welcome to the Show\").\nDuring the 1995 Division Series, the fan frustration with The Baseball Network was so bad that the mere mention of it during the Mariners–Yankees ALDS from public address announcer Tom Hutyler at Seattle's Kingdome brought boos from most of the crowd. To further put things into perspective, 55% of the country was able to get the American League Championship Series (Cleveland-Seattle) while 45% got the National League Championship Series (Atlanta-Cincinnati) for at least the first two games on ABC.\nProduction overview.\nWhile ABC and NBC would provide some production personnel and their own announcers for the games, all of would be coordinated from the office of Ken Schanzer, the chief executive officer of The Baseball Network and former executive vice president for NBC Sports. The graphics, camera placements, and audio quality were intended on looking and sounding about the same on both networks.\nWhen critiquing The Baseball Network's coverage of the 1995 postseason, Jerry Trecker of the \"Hartford Courant\" wrote that the broadcasts suffered from having too many men in the booth, sloppy camera work, and a lack of consistency in graphics. Trecker also felt that the ABC and NBC crews during the World Series, spent too much time in story-telling and not enough in nuts-and-bolts game setup. Instead, the coverage according to Trecker, proceeded as if fans have followed the game with the same attention as in the past. As for the graphics, Trecker argued that not only were the game graphics provided by The Baseball Network not there all the time as was the case with ESPN's, but it was too big.\nTrecker would however, praise ABC's production of the 1995 All-Star Game in Arlington. He said that the broadcast crew of Al Michaels, Jim Palmer, and Tim McCarver paced their broadcast as if they had never been away, and the different looks, especially ground level cameras, had always been a trademark of effective work by ABC. ABC also according to him, made effective use of graphics to recap season leaders. ABC Sports' technical coverage as a whole, included 21 cameras from all vantage points, including one in the Goodyear Blimp, and an unmanned camera directly above home plate. Coaches would wear wireless microphones.\nTrecker did however, point out that times, the broadcasters seemed to be ahead of the production people, especially when they wanted to talk about Raul Mondesi's speed getting to a drive into the right field corner. They never showed it. Trecker also believed that ABC's usage of dugout reporters (in this case, Lesley Visser, John Saunders, and Rick Dempsey), even in showcase games like the All-Star Game, was overkill. Visser in particular, was singled out for asked such lengthy questions of Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hideo Nomo that it was almost farcical when his answers came back in translation.\nFor the 1995 World Series, ABC and NBC shared 17 cameras and 13 tape machines, two of the \"Super Slo-Mo\" variety.\nSponsorships.\nAmong the key sponsors for The Baseball Network were Anheuser-Busch, MCI Inc., Sherwin-Williams, Texaco, and Russell Athletic. The sponsorship with Anheuser-Busch in particular, was worth over $20 million for two years with an option of a third. Budweiser was announced as the presenter during the starting line-up were announcements during The Baseball Network's telecasts. According to Busch Media president Tony Ponturo, Anheuser-Busch liked The Baseball Network's idea of broadcasting games, including the Division Series and League Championship Series regionally instead of to the entire nation all at once.\nOther sponsors for The Baseball Network included Gillette, Avis (who paid The Baseball Network approximately $6.5 million), Chevrolet, Fruit of the Loom, Gatorade, General Motors (who was expected to pay The Baseball Network at least $40 million), Upper Deck, and Toyota. Chevrolet in particular, sponsored the \"player of the game\" award that would be announced towards the end of the telecasts.\nAll in all, The Baseball Network was said to have more than 20 corporate sponsors and advertisers. In the event of a strike, these sponsors either had the option of taking back the money that they otherwise, would've used to support The Baseball Network and be able to spend it elsewhere or, they would've been able to delay any spending on baseball telecasts until the strike was resolved. At the time of the actual strike's start on August 12, 1994, The Baseball Network was reportedly able to sell approximately $130 million in advertisement time. Unfortunately, about $100 million of that was expected to run through the entire postseason, including the World Series, which would ultimately be canceled on September 14, 1994.\nDownfall and demise.\nThe long-term plans for The Baseball Network began to crumble after players and owners went on strike on August 12, 1994. In addition to the cancellation of that year's World Series, ABC was denied its remaining \"Baseball Night in America\" telecasts and NBC was shut out of its game broadcast slate (which in 1994, was scheduled to begin on August 26) altogether. It is known that ABC's lead broadcast team of Al Michaels, Jim Palmer, and Tim McCarver were scheduled to broadcast a game between the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers the week that the strike began.\nBoth networks elected to dissolve the partnership with Major League Baseball on June 22, 1995. Both networks figured that as the delayed 1995 baseball season opened without a labor agreement, there was no guarantee against another strike. Under the terms of the agreement, it could be voided by any party if the venture did not produce a minimum of $330 million in revenue over the first two years.\nABC Sports president Dennis Swanson, in announcing the dissolution of \nThe Baseball Network, said: \nOthers would argue that a primary reason for its failure was its abandoning of localized markets in favor of more lucrative and stable advertising contracts afforded by turning to a national model of broadcasting, similar to the National Football League's television package, which focuses on localized games, with one or two \"national\" games.\nThe Baseball Network's contract stipulated that negotiations could only take place with NBC and ABC for 45 days, starting on August 15, 1995. But with NBC and ABC's refusal to continue after the 1995 season, baseball had to look at its future options. In October 1995, when it was a known fact that ABC and NBC were going to end their television deal/joint venture with Major League Baseball, preliminary talks rose about CBS returning. It was rumored that CBS would show Thursday night games (more specifically, a package of West Coast interleague games scheduled for the 11:30 Eastern/8:30 Pacific Time slot) while Fox would show Saturday afternoon games. CBS and Fox were also rumored to share rights to the postseason. In the end, however, CBS's involvement did not come to pass and NBC became Fox's over-the-air national television partner. Whereas each team earned about $14 million in 1990 under CBS, the later television agreement with NBC and Fox beginning in 1996 earned each team about $6.8 million.\nTo salvage the remains of the partnership, ABC and NBC elected to share coverage of the 1995 postseason including the World Series. ABC wound up broadcasting Games 1, 4, and 5 of 1995 World Series while NBC would broadcast Games 2, 3, and 6 (which turned out to be the decisive game). Had the 1995 World Series gone to a seventh game, it would have then been broadcast by ABC. Game 5 of the 1995 World Series was the final Major League Baseball game to be broadcast on ABC until the 2020 postseason.\nAl Michaels would later write in his 2014 autobiography \"You Can't Make This Up: Miracles, Memories, and the Perfect Marriage of Sports and Television\" that the competition between the two networks could be so juvenile that neither ABC nor NBC wanted to promote each other's telecasts during the 1995 World Series. To give you a better idea, in the middle of Game 1, Michaels was handed a promo that read \"Join us here on ABC for Game 4 in Cleveland on Wednesday night and for Game 5 if necessary, Thursday.\" Michaels however, would soon follow this up by saying \"By the way, if you're wondering about Games 2 and 3, I can't tell you exactly where you can see them, but here's a hint: Last night, Bob Costas, Bob Uecker, and Joe Morgan [NBC's broadcast crew] were spotted in Underground Atlanta.\" Naturally, Bob Costas soon made a similar reference to ABC's crew (Michaels, Jim Palmer, and Tim McCarver) on NBC.\nAftermath.\nIn the end, the venture lost US$95 million in advertising and nearly $500 million in national and local spending. The Baseball Network generated only about $5.5 million per team in revenue for each of the two years that it operated. To put things into proper perspective, in 1993 alone, CBS generated about $14.7 million per team. Much of this could possibly be traced back to the strike causing a huge drop in revenue, which in return caused baseball salaries to decrease by approximately $140,000 on average in 1995.\nBoth ABC and NBC soon publicly vowed to cut all ties with Major League Baseball for the remainder of the 20th century, and Fox signed on to be the exclusive network carrier of Major League Baseball regular season games in 1996. However, NBC backtracked and kept a postseason-only schedule — with the exception of even-numbered years when NBC had the rights to the All-Star Game — signing a deal to carry three Division Series games, one of the League Championship Series (the ALCS in even numbered years and the NLCS in odd numbered years; Fox televised the other LCS in said years), and the 1997 and 1999 World Series respectively (Fox had exclusive rights to the 1996, 1998 and 2000 World Series). Beginning in 2001, Fox became the exclusive broadcast network for the World Series.\nFox's end of the new contract (which the network paid US$575 million for the initial five-year contract) restored the Saturday afternoon \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts during the regular season (approximately 16 weekly telecasts annually that normally began on Memorial Day weekend), although it continued to offer a selection of games based on region, with usually three regionalized telecasts airing each week.\nWith ABC being sold to The Walt Disney Company in 1996, ESPN picked up daytime and late-evening Division Series games with a provision similar to its National Football League games, in which the games would only air on network affiliates in the local markets of the two participating teams. ESPN's Major League Baseball contract was not affected then, but would take a hit in 1998 with the new National Football League contract. It was rumored that ABC would only offer Major League Baseball about $10 to $15 million less per year than what CBS was reportedly willing to offer for the 1996 season. At the time, it was reported that Major League Baseball was expecting a combined total of over $900 million in rights fees from two networks.\nIn 2012, Fox would revive the \"Baseball Night in America\" title (previously used for The Baseball Network's games) for a series of Saturday night games. Unlike The Baseball Network, Fox did not carry every game that was scheduled for a given Saturday, only choosing five to six games to distribute to its affiliates.\nAs far as the primary announce teams for The Baseball Network were concerned, they mostly went their separate ways. Al Michaels remained at ABC until 2006 (his final assignment for ABC Sports was Super Bowl XL), when he moved to NBC to become the voice of their Sunday night NFL coverage. Tim McCarver joined Fox as its primary analyst alongside Joe Buck and stayed there until his retirement from national television broadcasts in 2013. Jim Palmer, meanwhile, would rejoin the Orioles as their television analyst, where he still remains.\nNBC's primary crew remained in place for two more years. Bob Uecker would leave following the 1997 World Series, but Bob Costas and Joe Morgan would continue calling games until NBC's contract expired following the 2000 season. The network's final game at the time, was Game 6 of the 2000 American League Championship Series. Major League Baseball coverage would ultimately return to NBC in 2022 via a deal with the network's streaming service, Peacock. The first game of the agreement, between the Chicago White Sox and the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park was broadcast nationally on NBC — the first since 2000.\nCostas has since become the lead broadcaster for MLB Network (as previously alluded towards, MLB Network's self-produced, live \"MLB Showcase\" telecasts could be seen as a spiritual successor to The Baseball Network's broadcasts), while Morgan kept working for ESPN until the end of the 2010 season.\nOn July 8, 2011, Al Michaels and Bob Costas teamed up (with the two announcers alternating between play-by-play and color commentary) to call a game between the New York Mets and San Francisco Giants on MLB Network. It was Michaels' first appearance as a primary announcer on a baseball telecast since Game 5 of the 1995 World Series on ABC (as previously mentioned, Michaels had called Games 1, 4 and 5 of that series with Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver, while Costas called Games 2, 3 and 6 with Joe Morgan and Bob Uecker for NBC). Michaels and Costas also made appearances on SportsNet New York and Comcast SportsNet Bay Area during the game's middle innings, since the MLB Network broadcast was blacked out in the Mets' and Giants' respective home markets.\nOn September 28, 2020, it was announced that ABC would carry at least four Wild Card Series games for the expanded 2020 Major League Baseball postseason. Produced by ESPN, they marked ABC's first national MLB broadcasts since 1995. And then on July 7, 2021, ESPN announced that a \"Sunday Night Baseball\" game between the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox, scheduled for August 8 from Wrigley Field would air exclusively on ABC. This was the first regular season Major League Baseball game to be aired on ABC since August 19, 1995. It was also announced that Al Michaels, would join in on the broadcast via FaceTime during the fourth inning.\nAnnouncers.\nAs previously mentioned announcers who represented each of the teams playing in the respective games were typically paired with each other during games on regular season \"Baseball Night in America\" telecasts. For example, if a game featuring the Texas Rangers playing against the Chicago White Sox aired on \"Baseball Night in America\", then a local Rangers announcer like Steve Busby would announce the broadcast with a local White Sox announcer like Ken \"Hawk\" Harrelson. In effect, ABC and NBC had to contract many non in-house announcers due to so many games being regionally televised.\nAlso as previously mentioned, ABC used Al Michaels, Jim Palmer, Tim McCarver, and \"Lesley Visser\" as the lead broadcast team (Brent Musburger, CBS alumnus Jim Kaat, and \"Jack Arute\" became the secondary team for ABC). Meanwhile, NBC used Bob Costas, Joe Morgan, Bob Uecker, and \"Jim Gray\" as their lead broadcasting team. John Saunders was the studio host for ABC's \"Baseball Night in America\" coverage. Hannah Storm hosted NBC's studio show for the lone season in which the network was able to participate in The Baseball Network; Greg Gumbel was NBC's studio host for its coverage of the 1994 All-Star Game (as previously mentioned). In 1995, Gumbel became the secondary play-by-play announcer for NBC (working with Joe Morgan on the National League Championship Series) behind Bob Costas. Dick Enberg was supposed to be the secondary play-by-play announcer in 1994 for NBC, but by the following season, his other commitments for NBC such as golf and football rendered him unavailable to broadcast baseball.\nLikewise, the original plan would've called for Costas to work with Uecker and for Enberg to work with Morgan on \"Baseball Night in America\" telecasts during the regular season and early round postseason games. When the question aroused regarding why NBC didn't rehire Costas' old broadcast partner, Tony Kubek (for whom Costas worked with on the \"Game of the Week\" and NBC's bi-yearly coverage of the ALCS from 1983–1989), it was insinuated that Kubek was simply too independent-minded for NBC officials to tolerate. According to Costas, while he originally wanted to work with Kubek again, NBC simply wanted to go into a different direction after being away from baseball for nearly five years.\nPrior to Game 3 of the 1995 World Series, Cleveland Indians slugger Albert Belle unleashed a profanity-laced tirade at NBC reporter Hannah Storm as she was waiting in the Indians' dugout for a prearranged interview with Indians lead-off man, Kenny Lofton. On the same day, Belle snapped at a photographer near the first base line during batting practice. Belle was ultimately fined US$50,000 for his behavior towards Storm. This particular World Series was remembered for baseball television history being made twice by Storm. Prior to Game 2, she became the first female sportscaster to serve as solo host of a World Series game, and after Game 6, she would be the first female sportscaster to preside over the presentation of the Commissioner's Trophy to the World Series champions.\nRatings.\nRatings for both seasons of the \"Baseball Night in America\" regular season coverage were substantially higher than CBS's final season in 1993 (3.8) or any subsequent season on Fox. \"Baseball Night in America\" earned a 6.2 during the strike-shortened 1994 season and a 5.8 in 1995."

        "text": "Shaun Terrance McDonald (born June 30, 1981) is a former American football wide receiver. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the fourth round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He played college football at Arizona State.\nMcDonald has also played for the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers.\nEarly years.\nMcDonald is a 1999 graduate of Shadow Mountain High School in Phoenix and was a 1999 Honorable Mention All-America by USA Today. He also earned All-state honors as a kick return specialist and all-conference as a wide receiver and kick specialist as a junior. He was a three-year starter and had five kickoff returns for touchdowns as a senior before missing one-third of his senior season with a broken fibula. As a senior, he had 800 yards receiving (30 yard average), 1,700 all-purpose yards, added seven kick returns for touchdown, and averaged 46 yards per kick return. As a junior, he returned four kickoffs of 90 yards or longer for touchdowns. He still holds the state record for most kickoff returns for touchdowns with 14. He lettered three times in football and four times each in soccer and track and field.

        "text": "Switzerland competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. This was the confederation's largest Winter Olympics team ever, because two ice hockey teams qualified (men and women).\nAlpine skiing.\nSwitzerland won three medals in alpine skiing, with the best performance a silver from Martina Schild in the women's downhill. Bruno Kernen finished 17th in the final men's downhill training run, but improved in the race itself, winning the bronze medal.\nNote: In the men's combined, run 1 is the downhill, and runs 2 and 3 are the slalom. In the women's combined, run 1 and 2 are the slalom, and run 3 the downhill.\nBiathlon.\nMatthias Simmen earned Switzerland's only top 25 finish in Biathlon, as a near-clean shooting performance left him solidly positioned in the men's pursuit.\nBobsleigh.\nMartin Annen piloted the Switzerland-1 sled in the two-man and the four-man, and in both events won a bronze medal. In each case, his team fell behind on the third run, but then performed well on the final run to earn a medal.\nCross-country skiing.\nThe Swiss cross-country team had only a single top-10 finish, a 7th place from the men's relay. The women's relay team, which earned a bronze medal in Salt Lake City, finished 11th.\nCurling.\nIn the men's event, 2006 European champion Ralph Stöckli finished the round robin at 5 wins, one short of the mark needed to progress to the medal round. On the women's side, Mirjam Ott, who won a silver medal as a third in 2002, made the final in 2006 as well, this time as a skip. Her rink finished second in the round robin before beating Canada in the semifinals. In the final, the Swiss managed to tie the game in the 10th end, forcing an extra, but Swedish skip Anette Norberg made a difficult shot to leave the Swiss with silver again.\nMen's tournament.\nTeam: Ralph Stöckli (skip), Claudio Pescia, Pascal Sieber, Simon Strübin, Marco Battilana (alternate)\nWomen's tournament.\nKey: The hammer indicates which team had the last stone in the first end.\nFigure skating.\n2005 World champion Stéphane Lambiel was one of the few medal challengers to have two consistent performances, and his 4th-placed free skate and 3rd-placed short program were good enough to earn him a silver medal.\nKey: CD = Compulsory Dance, FD = Free Dance, FS = Free Skate, OD = Original Dance, SP = Short Program\nFreestyle skiing.\n2005 World Championships silver medalist Evelyne Leu sat 5th after the first jump in the |women's aerials final, but on her second jump, she put up the highest score of the competition, earning her a gold medal.\nIce hockey.\nThe Swiss men's team had the two biggest upsets of the Olympic ice hockey tournament, beating the 1998 and 2002 gold medalists, the Czech Republic and Canada in back-to-back games. The win against Canada was the first time the Swiss had beaten that nation in an international competition, and required a stellar goaltending show from Martin Gerber, who earned a shutout. The team made the medal round, but lost in the quarter-finals to eventual champions Sweden. The women's team was less successful, losing each of its first four games before eventually finishing 7th.\nLuge.\nNeither Swiss luger managed to challenge for the top positions.\nNordic combined.\nNo individual Swiss athlete finished in the top 20 in Nordic Combined, but the team put on a strong run in the last two legs of the cross-country portion to finish fourth, though they were more than a minute back of a medal spot.\nNote: 'Deficit' refers to the amount of time behind the leader a competitor began the cross-country portion of the event. Italicized numbers show the final deficit from the winner's finishing time.\nSkeleton.\nMaya Pedersen-Bieri won gold at both the 2001 and 2005 World championships, and comfortably took the Olympic title, winning by more than a full second and being the only woman to complete a run in less than a minute. Her 59.64 second time in the first run was a new women's track record at Cesana Pariol. Gregor Stähli was fifth after the first run, bu when others ahead of him faltered, he put together a solid run to earn a bronze medal.\nSki jumping.\nSimon Ammann, a double gold medalist in Salt Lake, could not recapture that form in Turin, where his best finish was 15th in the large hill event. Andreas Küttel was pre-qualified in both events, but poor second jumps in both left him outside the medals.\nNote: PQ indicates a skier was pre-qualified for the final, based on entry rankings.\nSnowboarding.\nThe Swiss Olympic team won four medals in snowboarding, more than in any other sport. Three of these came in the parallel giant slalom, as the Swiss swept the golds in both the men's and women's events. Daniela Meuli was seeded 6th after the qualifying run, but overcame deficits twice to make the final, and then won after her German opponent fell. Philipp Schoch earned his second consecutive gold medal in the men's event, winning the final against his brother Simon. In the women's snowboard cross final, Tanja Frieden was the beneficiary of American Lindsey Jacobellis's fall on the final hill, sweeping past the American to claim the gold medal.\nNote: In the final, the single best score from two runs is used to determine the ranking. A bracketed score indicates a run that wasn't counted.\nKey: '+ Time' represents a deficit; the brackets indicate the results of each run."

        "title": "Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association",
        "text": "The Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) is a volunteer organization that serves as the governing authority for all sailing competition at colleges and universities throughout the United States and in some parts of Canada.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nThe first college sailing club to be formed in the United States was the Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, established in Branford, Connecticut in 1881, three years before the founding of the Oxford University Yacht Club at the University of Oxford in 1884 followed by the Cambridge University Yacht Club at the University of Cambridge in 1893, the Harvard University Yacht Club in 1894, and Brown University Yacht Club in 1896. \n20th century.\nHarvard and Yale held a sailing event in 1911, but this was a long-distance 'cruise' rather than a fleet or team race, and only one Yale yacht attended the event. Organized intercollegiate fleet racing began in 1928 between just a few schools in Eight-Metres for the Oliver Hay Trophy, now known as the McMillan Cup.\nThe Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) was formed June 16, 1930, as the Inter-Collegiate Yacht Racing Association (ICYRA).\nThe first inter-collegiate dinghy fleet event, the Boston Dinghy Club Challenge Cup, took place with 34 entrants in 1930 in parallel with the founding of the ICYRA. There was also a major sailing event between Princeton and Dartmouth in 1934, but details of its format are not recorded.\nThe initial emphasis of the ICSA was very much on fleet racing, rather than team racing, but during the 1930s, team racing between individual colleges started to emerge, with 2 to 4 colleges meeting up, each fielding 2 to 5 boats. Collegiate dinghy sailing blossomed in 1934–36 with initiatives taken by Princeton with its 'Tiger' dinghies (1934), MIT (the famous Pavilion was founded and built in 1935 at the instigation of Walter C. \"Jack\" Wood), and Brown (1936). The first ICSA dinghy fleet regatta took place in the spring of 1937 at the MIT Pavilion and was won by MIT, with Brown, Cornell, Harvard, Princeton, Williams, and Yale also competing. \nIn the fall of 1937, 19 colleges took part in another ICSA dinghy regatta at the MIT Pavilion. The Morss Trophy was also first awarded in 1937, being won by MIT\nFollowing World War II, collegiate sailing spread across the U.S. and parts of Canada, with ICSA membership rapidly growing to modern numbers. George O’Day (Harvard), Harry Anderson (Yale) and Bill Cox Sr. (Princeton) helped develop the ICYRA team race rules in the 1940s, and these were the forerunners of the NAYRU (now US Sailing) and International Yacht Racing Union (later International Sailing Federation) team race rules.\nA regional team racing championship, four-a-side format, first took place in 1950 in the New England District for the Leonard M. Fowle Trophy, a separate trophy from the new Fowle Trophy that is awarded to the best overall collegiate team. National team racing for the Walter Cromwell Wood Bowl, four-a-side format, commenced in 1970 between teams formed with sailors within a particular ICSA district or 'conference', and, since 1977, individuals from one college. The University of Rhode Island was the first winner of the current team racing championship in 1977.\n21st century.\nIn 2011, a group of Canadian University teams formed the Canadian Intercollegiate Sailing Association (CICSA), based on the ICSA's model. CICSA's two most successful teams, Queen's University and McGill University, also compete in the ICSA.\nTeams.\n36 schools launch fully funded varsity teams, while the other 163 are club teams.\nVarsity teams are:\nStructure.\nThere are 7 conferences with 200 teams competing in college sailing. The conferences within ICSA schedule and administer regattas within their established regions:\nEach conference is supervised by a Graduate Secretary and an executive committee, which comprises both graduate and undergraduate students. Both the Graduate Secretary and the executive committee are elected by representatives from each school in the conference. Each conference conducts local and intersectional regattas and holds district championships in both the fall and the spring.\nChampionships.\nThe conference or district championships allow schools to qualify for the Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships.\nICSA College Sailing Hall of Fame.\nThe ICSA College Sailing Hall of Fame was established in 1969. The Hall of Fame is located in the Robert Crown Sailing Center at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.\nICSA Hall of Fame Awards.\nThere are several awards that are bestowed upon collegiate sailors at the end of every full racing season:\nParticipation.\nICSA seeks to promote the sport of sailing throughout North America and encourage participation in the sport among young people. Although both varsity and club teams compete fiercely to qualify for district championships and nationals, the overall goal is to promote sailing and have fun on the water. Thus, most college sailing programs do not require previous sailing experience and encourage widespread participation among students. However, most schools also value students who have high school sailing experience.\nInstruction.\nAs education and training have been two cornerstones of the ICSA since its inception most college sailing programs offer general instruction to the student body, and in some cases the general public. Often college sailing programs serve to introduce many people to the sport of sailing.\nMany college sailors have gone on to race in the America's Cup as well as in the Olympics.\nCorporate partners.\nVanguard Sailboats was an official partner of ICSA for many years and the boatbuilder annually sponsored the ICSA National Championships. More recently, LaserPerformance was the official sponsor."

        "text": "The South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association (SAISA) is a conference in the Intercollegiate Sailing Association and was founded April 25, 1964. SAISA encompasses a geographic area that includes Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and northern Alabama. There are 33 active members, which include both public and private universities. \nCompetition.\nThe conference participates in both fall and spring college sailing season. There are coed, single handed, women's, match racing and team racing regattas nearly each weekend. \nCoed Dinghy Events.\nDinghy regattas sailed on FJs and 420s are the main events and focus of the conference. The regular season of each semester begins with a conference wide regatta called the SAISA Open. Then, each division has \"Points\" events, of which there are four or five North Division Qualifying Events and five or six South Division Qualifying Events. These events determine the points a team will receive to qualify for the championship. After regular season events, 18 teams will qualify for the \"SAISA Open Conference Championships\". The host of the championship rotates between divisions each season. A certain number of berths are then given to the conference for participation in the subsequent \"Atlantic Coast Dinghy Championship\" and the Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships\nOther Events.\nEach semester there are also several independently organized regattas, Men's Single handed Championship, Women's Single handed Championship, Women's Dinghy regattas and Championship, Team Race Championship, and Match Race Championship. SAISA also participates in Intersectional regattas against other conferences each year. "

        "title": "Super Bowl XLVI",
        "text": "Super Bowl XLVI was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion New York Giants and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2011 season. The Giants defeated the Patriots by the score of 21–17. The game was played on February 5, 2012, at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, the first time that the Super Bowl was played in Indiana.\nIn addition to winning their fourth Super Bowl in team history, the Giants set a new record for the lowest regular season record (9–7, win percentage of 56.3%) by a Super Bowl champion. The Patriots entered the game with a 13–3 regular season record, and were also seeking their fourth Super Bowl win. This was a rematch of Super Bowl XLII, which New York also won, spoiling New England's run at a perfect 2007 season. The Giants and the Patriots also played in Week 9 a few months earlier, with the Giants winning on the road 24–20.\nThe Giants jumped to a 9–0 lead in the first quarter of Super Bowl XLVI before the Patriots scored 17 unanswered points to take a 17–9 lead in the third quarter. But the Giants prevented the Patriots from scoring again, and two consecutive New York field goals chipped away New England's lead, 17–15, late in the third quarter. The Giants capped off an 88-yard drive with running back Ahmad Bradshaw's 6-yard game-winning touchdown with 57 seconds left in the game. Eli Manning, who completed 30 of 40 passes for 296 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time in his career. He became the third consecutive quarterback to win the award after Aaron Rodgers in Super Bowl XLV and Drew Brees in Super Bowl XLIV. He was also the first Giants quarterback to start and win two championship games since Ed Danowski in 1938.\nThe broadcast of the game on NBC broke the then record for the most-watched program in American television history, previously set during the previous year's Super Bowl. Super Bowl XLVI was watched by an estimated average audience of 111.3 million US viewers and an estimated total audience of 166.8 million, according to Nielsen, meaning that over half of the American population watched at least some of the initial broadcast. The game also set the record for most tweets per second during a sporting event, with 13.7 million tweets from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. (PST).\nBackground.\nPer convention as an even-numbered Super Bowl, the Patriots as the AFC representatives had the home team designation. Super Bowl XLVI was the sixth Super Bowl in which the two teams had competed in a previous Super Bowl matchup, as the Giants and Patriots had previously met in Super Bowl XLII. Both head coaches (Tom Coughlin and Bill Belichick) and both starting quarterbacks (Eli Manning and Tom Brady) returned from Super Bowl XLII.\nHost selection process.\nThree cities presented bids for the game:\nNFL franchise owners selected the Indianapolis bid at their meeting on May 20, 2008, in Atlanta.\nA labor dispute had threatened the postponement or cancellation of the game during the spring and summer of 2011; league officials had set contingency plans to postpone the game one week if it had been necessary to postpone regular season games into the second week of January. Since the dispute was resolved well before the start of the regular season, no postponements were implemented, and the game remained as originally scheduled.\nThis was the first Super Bowl to be played in Indianapolis, and only the fourth time that the Super Bowl has been played in a cold-weather city, after Detroit (XVI and XL) and Minneapolis (XXVI). Downtown Indianapolis, the home of Lucas Oil Stadium, featured an outdoor Super Bowl Village and other programs at the Indiana Convention Center.\nTeams.\nNew York Giants.\nWorking around a series of injuries, the Giants ended with a 9–7 record during the regular season and returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2008, winning the NFC East and finishing the season as the NFC's No. 4 seed. Finally back to full strength, the Giants entered their week 17 matchup with the Dallas Cowboys with both teams tied for the division lead with 8–7 records. The Giants took a 21–0 first half lead and while the Cowboys closed the gap to make the score 21–14 early in the 4th quarter, the Giants held on to defeat the Cowboys 31–14, clinching the divisional title and a playoff berth.\nNew York's offense was led by Super Bowl XLII winning quarterback Eli Manning, in his seventh season as the team's starter. Manning set new career highs in nearly every statistical category in 2011, throwing for a franchise record 4,933 yards and 29 touchdowns, with 16 interceptions, giving him a 92.9 passer rating. His top target was receiver Victor Cruz, who caught 82 passes for a franchise record 1,536 yards (3rd in the NFL) and 9 touchdowns. But he had plenty of other targets, including Hakeem Nicks (76 receptions, 1,192 yards, 7 touchdowns), Mario Manningham (39 receptions and 523 yards in 12 games) and tight end Jake Ballard (38 receptions, 604 yards).\nAlthough not on the field for four games due to injury, running back Ahmad Bradshaw was the team's leading rusher with 659 yards and 9 touchdowns. He was also a reliable weapon in the passing game, hauling in 34 receptions for 267 yards and two touchdowns. Brandon Jacobs also made contributions on the ground, rushing for 571 yards and 7 touchdowns.\nNew York's defensive line was led by defensive ends Justin Tuck, Jason Pierre-Paul and Osi Umenyiora. Pierre-Paul racked up 86 combined tackles and ranked fourth in the NFL with 16.5 sacks, earning him the only Pro Bowl selection on the Giants defense, while Umenyiora, limited to 9 games because of injury, recorded 9 sacks and 2 forced fumbles. The Giants secondary was led by Corey Webster, who intercepted a career-high 6 passes. Defensive backs Kenny Phillips and Aaron Ross added four interceptions each, while safety Antrel Rolle picked off two passes and led the team in combined tackles with 96.\nThe Giants joined the 2008 Arizona Cardinals and 1979 Los Angeles Rams as the only other team to advance to the Super Bowl with fewer than ten victories since the NFL expanded to a 16-game season in 1978, and the only one of those three to win the Super Bowl they had advanced to. They have won six consecutive playoff games away from their home stadium, dating back to their victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2007 Wild Card round. That includes their Super Bowl XLII victory over these same Patriots, although that game was played at a neutral site (and the Giants were the designated \"away\" team for the game). The 2011 Giants are the first team in NFL history to reach the Super Bowl after having been outscored by their opponents in the regular season (394 points scored, 400 points allowed).\nNew England Patriots.\nThe Patriots finished with a 13–3 record, winning the AFC East and clinching the AFC's No. 1 seed in the playoffs. New England lost 2 consecutive games to the Steelers and Giants in week 8 and 9 respectively, before rallying to win their remaining eight games.\nBack at the helm of the offense was 12-year quarterback Tom Brady, who earned his 7th Pro Bowl selection. Starting every game of the season, Brady completed 65.6% of his passes for a career-high 5,235 yards (the second highest total in NFL history at the time) and 39 touchdown passes, with just 12 interceptions and a rating of 105.6. Brady also added 109 yards and three scores on the ground. His main weapon in the passing game was Pro Bowl receiver Wes Welker, who led the NFL with 122 receptions (22 receptions ahead of second place) for 1,569 yards and 9 touchdowns. New England also had two of the best tight ends in the NFL: Pro Bowler Rob Gronkowski, who set new tight end records for receiving (1,327 yards) and touchdown catches (17); and Aaron Hernandez, who caught 79 passes for 910 yards and 7 touchdowns, while also rushing for 45 yards. Another big element of the passing game was veteran receiver Deion Branch, who caught 51 passes for 702 yards and 5 scores. Receivers Chad Ochocinco, Tiquan Underwood, Julian Edelman, and Matthew Slater made minor contributions to the passing attack; the latter two also served as emergency defensive backs. Edelman was also a superb punt returner, returning 28 punts for 296 yards and a touchdown.\nNew England had several key contributors in the ground game. Their main rusher was BenJarvus Green-Ellis, who rushed for 667 yards and 11 touchdowns. Running back Stevan Ridley added 447 yards and a 5.1 yards per carry average. Danny Woodhead contributed 351 yards with a 4.6 YPC average, and gained another 437 yards returning kickoffs. New England also had a solid offensive line, which was anchored by Pro Bowl guards Logan Mankins and Brian Waters. With all these weapons, New England ranked third in the NFL with 513 points.\nThe Patriots' defensive line featured two Pro Bowl selections: Vince Wilfork, who generated 3.5 sacks, two interceptions, and one forced fumble; and Andre Carter, who contributed 10 sacks and forced two fumbles. Defensive End Mark Anderson was also a major force on the line, earning 10 sacks and two forced fumbles of his own. Behind them, Rob Ninkovich excelled at linebacker, gaining 74 tackles, 6.5 sacks, and two interceptions. In the secondary, cornerback Kyle Arrington had a breakout season. After recording just one interception in his first three years, Arrington picked off 7 passes in 2011 to lead the NFL in that category, while also making 88 tackles. Linebacker Jerod Mayo led the team in tackles with 95.\nWith the victory in the 2011 AFC Championship Game Brady and head coach Bill Belichick became the first quarterback-head coach combination to reach the Super Bowl five times, surpassing the record held by Terry Bradshaw and Chuck Noll of the Pittsburgh Steelers' 1970s Super Bowl teams. Belichick tied Tom Landry for second most appearances as a head coach in the Super Bowl, behind only Don Shula's six.\nSeason and playoffs.\nThe Patriots and Giants faced each other in New England during the regular season; the Giants won that game, 24–20. Incidentally, the Giants and Patriots had also faced each other in New York during the regular season prior to Super Bowl XLII with the Patriots winning that regular season matchup and the Giants going on to win that Super Bowl. Super Bowl XLVI marked the 13th Super Bowl that was a rematch of a regular season game. The loser in the regular season had been 7–5 in these games prior to Super Bowl XLVI.\nThe Giants finished the season as the NFC East champion and the No. 4 seed in the conference. The Giants defeated the No. 5 seed Atlanta Falcons in the Wild Card round 24–2, the first playoff game at MetLife Stadium. Eli Manning threw for 277 yards and 3 touchdowns with no interceptions, while the Giants defense shut down the Falcons, with the only Falcons points coming from a safety given up by Manning's intentional grounding penalty in his end zone.\nThe Giants then moved on to face the No. 1 seed and the defending Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers in the divisional round. The Giants never trailed in the game, winning 37–20. One of the key plays in the game was a Hail Mary pass by Manning to Hakeem Nicks, giving the Giants a 20–10 lead at the end of the first half. As they did to 2007 MVP Tom Brady and the Patriots' record-breaking offense, the Giants generated significant pressure on Packers quarterback and season MVP Aaron Rodgers, sacking him four times and disrupting his talented receiving corps. This was the first time in NFL history a 15–1 team failed to make it past the divisional round in the playoffs.\nThe Giants then faced the No. 2 seeded San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. After a series of defensive standoffs in the fourth quarter, the game went into overtime. Both teams continued to struggle on offense, until Giants linebacker Jacquian Williams stripped the ball from 49ers wide receiver Kyle Williams after a punt return. The Giants recovered the ball at the 49ers 24-yard line, setting up a 31-yard field goal attempt by Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes. Unlike Cundiff earlier that day, Tynes' kick was successful, giving the Giants a 20–17 victory.\nAs the No. 1 seed in the AFC, the Patriots earned a first-round bye and home field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. In the divisional round, the Patriots defeated the Denver Broncos 45–10. The Patriots dominated the game throughout, setting new franchise postseason records for total yards (509), points (45), and margin of victory (35). Tom Brady completed 18 of 25 passes for 246 yards and a postseason record five touchdowns in the first half. The Patriots defense had a breakout performance: Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow was held to just 9 of 26 completions and was sacked five times.\nIn the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots faced off against the No. 2 seeded Baltimore Ravens. Brady was out-dueled by Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, who threw for more yards and touchdowns on the same number of completions and attempts. Nevertheless, the Patriots managed to take a 23–20 lead in the fourth quarter on a 1-yard run by Brady. With 1:44 left in the quarter, The Ravens got the ball back with one last chance to tie or win the game, driving all the way to the Patriots 14-yard line. But the Patriots managed to hold them there, with cornerback Sterling Moore breaking up two consecutive Ravens pass attempts in the red zone, including one in the end zone. Facing fourth down, the Ravens attempted a 32-yard field goal by kicker Billy Cundiff that would tie the game and possibly bring it to overtime. Cundiff missed the kick wide left, allowing the Patriots to advance to the Super Bowl.\nSuper Bowl pre-game notes.\nThe Patriots, as the designated home team, had a choice of wearing their home navy blue jerseys or their white away jerseys. Briefly, there was speculation that the Patriots might wear the white away jerseys in order to switch the jerseys from Super Bowl XLII, where the Patriots wore dark blue and the Giants wore white. Also, the Giants were 4–0 in playoff games in their white away jerseys since the 2007 season. However, the Patriots announced on the Monday following the Conference Championship Games that they would be wearing their customary navy blue home jerseys as the home team in Super Bowl XLVI.\nHospitality experts speculated that \"Indianapolis will have seen the most severe hotel price gouging in Super Bowl history.\" The city has 6,000 hotel rooms, fewer than typical for a Super Bowl host city. Some rooms in downtown Indianapolis reportedly cost more than $4,000 a night. By contrast, rooms close to the stadium in previous Super Bowls were usually available for about $200. The room shortage and high prices caused some attendees to plan to stay in Chicago, 180 miles away, and ride buses to events.\nBecause the Giants and Patriots drew their fan bases from New York City and Boston respectively, the Super Bowl echoed the fierce rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball. Tom Brady said of the rivalry: \"There is a great rivalry...between Boston and New York...When I got to the team, it was always Red Sox-Yankees. We've had some pretty meaningful games against the Giants over the past few years, so I don't think anyone is disappointed that it's the Giants.\"\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the game was televised nationally by NBC, including local NBC stations WNBC in New York City and WHDH in Boston.\nAl Michaels called play-by-play for NBC, marking the eighth time that he was behind the microphone for a Super Bowl and the second time he called a Super Bowl for NBC (Michaels had previously done play-by-play for Super Bowls XXII, XXV, XXIX, XXXIV, XXXVII, and XL for ABC and Super Bowl XLIII for NBC). Cris Collinsworth was the color analyst for the game, his second Super Bowl as a game analyst and first since he was in the booth for Super Bowl XXXIX for Fox. Michele Tafoya was the sideline reporter. Bob Costas and Dan Patrick (who also presided over the trophy presentation ceremony) hosted the pregame, halftime, and postgame coverage for NBC with \"Football Night in America\" analysts Tony Dungy and Rodney Harrison and special guest analysts (who were seated next to Costas during the pre-game festivities), Aaron Rodgers and Hines Ward. Also helping out on NBC's broadcast were reporters Alex Flanagan, Liam McHugh, and Randy Moss and NFL insiders Mike Florio and Peter King.\nAdvertising.\nAll commercials for the game sold out by Thanksgiving 2011, at an average price of $3.5 million per thirty-second ad, by far the highest rate for Super Bowl advertising in the event's history. At least one thirty-second advertisement commanded a price of $4 million.\nAnti-abortion activist Randall Terry has said he was planning to run an advertisement featuring graphic photos of aborted fetuses during Super Bowl XLVI. Terry was not allowed to air the ad nationwide, given that the networks have a policy under equal time rules to reject all political and issue related advertising during the Super Bowl. He was able, however, under the then-current Federal Election Commission \"reasonable access\" rules, to force up to 35 local stations (those located in states in which the Democratic Party primaries are within 45 days of Super Bowl Sunday; Terry entered the primary as a dummy candidate primarily for the purpose of this advertisement) to run the advertisement uncensored, regardless of whether it meets Standards and Practices or Federal Communications Commission guidelines. The FCC ruled against Terry on February 3, two days before the game, when NBC owned-and-operated WMAQ-TV in Chicago refused to air the ad, citing the same equal-time statutes and the fact that Terry did not appear to be a \"bona fide\" candidate. The largest station to allow Terry to air his advertisement was WHDH in Boston, Massachusetts.\nAn advertisement from Pepsi featured Melanie Amaro, the winner of season one of the Fox series \"The X Factor\". Other confirmed advertisers included Doritos (continuing its user-generated \"Crash the Super Bowl\" contest), Bridgestone, Volkswagen (a 60-second spot advertising the third-generation Beetle featuring dogs barking to the tune of \"The Imperial March\"), General Motors (four for Chevrolet; including a commercial featuring \"We Are Young\" by fun. that led to a massive sales spike; and one for Cadillac), Toyota, Hyundai, Acura (featuring Jerry Seinfeld in an ad for the NSX), Kia Motors (advertising the Optima with a spot starring Adriana Lima), Audi (parodying the \"Twilight\" series with an ad for the S7), Honda (starring Matthew Broderick in a reprisal of the lead role in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\"), newcomers Dannon Yogurt and Century 21 Real Estate, Teleflora, Mars, Incorporated (introducing the M&amp;M's brown spokescandy), The Coca-Cola Company, CareerBuilder.com (reprising their chimp advertisement campaign), Cars.com, Skechers, Relativity Media (running four advertisements for \"Act of Valor\"), Paramount Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, and Universal Pictures. Anheuser-Busch has purchased nine slots during the game. An ad for Old Milwaukee beer featuring Will Ferrell aired a single time on only one station in Nebraska.\nDisney's ad for its upcoming \"John Carter\" was seen as exacerbating concerns about the expensive tentpole film's marketing that had been raised by its teaser the preceding August. While admitting he was \"pleasantly surprised\" by it, \"Collider\"s Adam Chitwood said he was \"still not convinced that the general audience has a handle on what the film's about.\" An executive at a competing studio said the trailer strongly reinforced concerns that the film had experienced serious production problems that adversely affected its quality and box-office prospects. \"It's like, 'Guys, this is your Hail Mary?'\" The ad's ineffectiveness was cited as one of many reasons the movie failed upon its release the following month, leading Disney to take a $200 million writedown on the film. \nChrysler aired a two-minute half time advertisement titled \"Half Time in America\", produced by the Wieden+Kennedy agency and narrated by Clint Eastwood. The ad drew the criticism of several leading U.S. conservatives, who suggested that its messaging implied that President Obama deserved a second term and, as such, was political payback for Obama's support for the federal bailout of the company. Both Chrysler chief marketing officer Olivier François and Chrysler Chairman and CEO Sergio Marchionne denied that the ad was intended as a politically oriented message. Overall, the ad was considered one of the better ones that aired during the game.\nThere has also been some conjecture regarding the possible plagiarism of Australian band John Butler Trio's song \"Zebra\" by Yogurt giant Dannon. Spokesman for the band, Tom McNamara, commented that the band was currently exploring their proprietary rights with regards to the similarity of the tune to the band's hit single.\nMatthew Broderick reprised his \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" role in a Honda commercial aired during this Super Bowl which featured the Oh Yeah song. A teaser for the ad had appeared two weeks prior to the Super Bowl, which had created rumors of a possible film sequel. It was produced by Santa Monica-based RPA and directed by Todd Phillips. AdWeek's Tim Nudd called the ad \"a great homage to the original 1986 film, with Broderick this time calling in sick to a film shoot and enjoying another day of slacking.\" On the other hand, \"Jalopnik\"s Matt Hardigree called the spot \"sacrilegious\".\nInternational.\nNFL International televised the game to viewers outside of North America, with Kenny Albert and Joe Theismann calling the English language feed.\nStreaming.\nThis was the first legal online streaming of a Super Bowl telecast in the United States, available on computers via NFL.com and NBCSports.com, and mobile devices via Verizon Wireless's NFL Mobile app.\nAs part of \"Operation Fake Sweep\", Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, seized and shut down 16 websites that had provided access to pirated Internet television feeds of NFL games on February 2, in an action similar to the crackdown they had implemented the previous year. For the first time, domains in the .tv top-level domain were also seized, despite that TLD's allocation to Tuvalu.\nRadio.\nSuper Bowl XLVI was carried nationwide on radio over the Dial Global radio network, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason as color analyst, and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters. Locally, the game was broadcast by the New York Giants Radio Network flagship (WFAN) and the New England Patriots Radio Network flagship (WBZ-FM). Bob Papa called the game for the Giants with Carl Banks as his analyst and Howard Cross as sideline reporter, while Gil Santos was at the microphone for the Patriots with Gino Cappelletti as analyst and Scott Zolak as sideline reporter. Santos and Cappelletti returned for their sixth Super Bowl as broadcast team for the Patriots while Papa and Banks called their third and second Super Bowls, respectively, for the Giants. This was the first Super Bowl broadcast for the Giants not to feature longtime analyst Dick Lynch, who had retired from the team's radio booth following the 2007 season and died in 2008. As per the NFL's rules, all the other stations in the Giants and Patriots radio networks (as well as WCBS-AM in New York, which serves as a preseason overflow station for the Giants) carried Dial Global's feed.\nBBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra produced its own radio broadcast, with Darren Fletcher, Rocky Boiman, and Greg Brady announcing.\nEntertainment.\nPregame.\nThe Indiana University Marching Hundred performed during the pre-game show.\nOn January 12, 2012, it was reported that former \"American Idol\" winner Kelly Clarkson would sing the National Anthem at Super Bowl XLVI. It marks the fourth time in the previous five years that an \"American Idol\" contestant has performed the national anthem (joining Carrie Underwood, Jennifer Hudson and Jordin Sparks). Clarkson was accompanied by the Indianapolis Children's Choir. Husband-and-wife country musicians Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert performed \"America the Beautiful\" as part of the ceremonies. American Sign Language translation for both songs was performed by Rachel Mazique, the currently reigning Miss Deaf America.\nThe coin toss ceremony featured the recent inductees to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Curtis Martin, one of the inductees, was originally selected to toss the coin, but in what NESN described as \"a rather awkward scene\", referee John Parry ended up flipping the coin himself while Martin stood beside and watched. The Patriots won the toss, the first AFC team to do so in the Super Bowl in 15 years. Because the coin toss landed on heads, the pizza chain Papa John's offered free pizza to millions of Americans who participated in a promotional contest.\nHalftime.\nWord had leaked as early as October 2011 that Madonna would be the performer for the Super Bowl halftime show, with M.I.A. and Nicki Minaj performing as well; all three are featured on Madonna's new single \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" which was performed as part of the show. The league confirmed Madonna as the performer on December 4. Other collaborators on the project included LMFAO, Cee Lo Green, long time Madonna collaborator Jamie King, Cirque du Soleil, and Moment Factory. M.I.A. came under controversy for giving the middle finger during the performance of \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\", which was caught by the broadcast feed. The gesture was given when she appeared to sing \"I don't give a shit\", although it was hard to hear clearly if the expletive was said, stopped short, or cut off, as the censor unsuccessfully tried to blur the screen to cover the gesture. The setlist included an Egyptian-themed \"Vogue\" with costumes by Givenchy, a medley of Madonna's \"Music\" and LMFAO's two largest hits (\"Party Rock Anthem\" and \"Sexy and I Know It\", with the LMFAO singers remaining fully clothed, unlike in the latter song's music video), followed by her then-current single \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\", excerpts from \"Open Your Heart\" and \"Express Yourself\" (in a duet with Green), and the finale, \"Like a Prayer\", also featuring Green. Green and Shelton (who sang \"America the Beautiful\" as part of the pregame show) are both judges on the NBC TV series \"The Voice\", which the network broadcast after the game. It broke the record for the most viewed Super Bowl halftime show ever, defeating Michael Jackson's previous record, with 114 million viewers throughout the world.\nGame summary.\nFirst quarter.\nThe Patriots won the coin toss and deferred. This ended a stretch of 14 consecutive Super Bowls in which the NFC team won the coin toss.\nNew York opened the game with a drive to the Patriots' 33-yard line, threatening to score first. After giving up a 19-yard reception to Giants wide receiver Hakeem Nicks, New England's defense stepped up to prevent a score: defensive lineman Brandon Deaderick sacked Eli Manning for a 2-yard loss, then Giants running back Ahmad Bradshaw was tackled behind the line of scrimmage on a blitz by Patriots cornerback Kyle Arrington. On third down, New England defensive end Mark Anderson sacked Manning, pushing the Giants out of field goal range and forcing a Giants' punt.\nNew York got a boost from punter Steve Weatherford, whose 36-yard kick pinned the Patriots back at their own 6-yard line. On the Patriots' first offensive play, Tom Brady attempted a play action pass, but a heavy rush from Giants defensive lineman Justin Tuck forced a deep throw into the middle of the field, with no receiver anywhere near it. Brady was flagged for intentional grounding, and since he was in the end zone when he threw the pass the play resulted in a safety, giving New York a 2–0 lead. It was the first safety in a Super Bowl since the Arizona Cardinals scored one in Super Bowl XLIII. After receiving the free kick, New York drove 78 yards in 9 plays—including a key 24-yard run by Ahmad Bradshaw—and increased their lead to 9–0 on Manning's 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Victor Cruz.\nOn the following drive, Brady completed passes to BenJarvus Green-Ellis for 7 yards, Deion Branch for 15, and Wes Welker for 19, moving the ball to the Giants' 31-yard line.\nSecond quarter.\nNew York managed to stop the drive at their own 11-yard line, but Stephen Gostkowski kicked a 29-yard field goal for New England's first score early in the second quarter.\nThe Giants punted on the next drive, then held the Patriots to a three-and-out. When New York's next drive stalled, Weatherford's 51-yard punt gave the Patriots possession on their 4-yard line. Brady, however, completed eight consecutive passes for 71 yards, and threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to running back Danny Woodhead, giving the Patriots a 10–9 halftime lead, the same halftime deficit the Giants faced against the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI. The drive went for 14 plays and covered 96 yards, tying the record for the longest drive in Super Bowl history.\nThird quarter.\nNew England took the second half kickoff and started out strong: Brady completed a 21-yard pass to Chad Johnson (his only reception of the postseason and Brady's longest pass of the game), and two rushes by Green-Ellis gained 25 yards to the New York 33-yard line. Brady eventually finished the 8-play, 79-yard drive with a 12-yard touchdown pass to second-year tight end Aaron Hernandez, increasing New England's lead to 17–9.\nStarting the following drive from their own 35-yard line after Jerrel Jernigan's 34-yard kickoff return, New York responded with a drive to Patriots' 20-yard line where Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes converted a 38-yard field goal, cutting the score to 17–12.\nOn the next drive, New York forced a three-and-out—including a Justin Tuck sack of Brady on third down—and Will Blackmon returned Zoltan Mesko's 43-yard punt 10 yards to the Patriots' 47-yard line. New York subsequently drove back into scoring range on a drive that utilized several different players, including a 12-yard reception by seldom used tight end Bear Pascoe to reach the New England 9-yard line. On third down, however, a sack by New England's Anderson and Rob Ninkovich forced New York to settle for another Tynes field goal, making the score 17–15 with 35 seconds left in the third quarter.\nFourth quarter.\nOn the second play of the fourth quarter, the first turnover of the game occurred when Giants linebacker Chase Blackburn stepped in front of tight end Rob Gronkowski and picked off a deep Brady pass at the New York 8-yard line. New York then drove to the Patriots' 43-yard line, but were stopped there and had to punt. New England took the ball back at their own eight-yard line with less than ten minutes in the fourth quarter. With 4:06 left in the game, New England snapped the ball at the Giants' 44-yard line on 2nd-and-11 and Tom Brady threw to an uncovered Wes Welker. However, Brady's pass was high and Welker was unable to reel it in while falling to the ground, crucially preventing a huge gain. New England's drive stalled on the Giants' 44-yard line and they were forced to punt, after which Brady's wife supermodel Gisele Bündchen famously blamed Welker, saying her husband could not both \"[T]hrow and catch the ball.\" The television footage of the game showed Bill Belichick exhorting his defense to focus on stopping Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks, and to force the Giants to go to secondary options Mario Manningham and Pascoe.\nThe Giants took possession from their own 12-yard line with 3:46 left in the game and one timeout. On the first play, in what would end up being one of the key plays of the game, Manning completed a deep pass along the left sideline to Manningham for a 38-yard gain to midfield (the longest play from scrimmage in the game), which would later draw comparisons to his pass to Tyree in Super Bowl XLII. New England coach Bill Belichick challenged the catch, but the call on the field stood and it cost him his team's first timeout. Two more completions from Manning to Manningham gained another 18 yards. Manning then completed a 14-yard pass to Nicks on the New England 18-yard line at the two-minute warning. Two plays later, New England called their second timeout with 1:03 left after Bradshaw's one-yard run gave New York a 2nd down and goal on the six-yard line.\nOn the second down play, which \"Sports Illustrated\" later called \"perhaps the strangest play in Super Bowl history\", Bradshaw's path to the end zone was clear as the Patriots chose to let him score. Once he realized what was happening, Bradshaw tried to stop running at the one-yard line, but his forward momentum carried him over the goal line and the Giants took the lead on the uncontested touchdown run. The intentionally surrendered touchdown gave the Patriots 57 seconds to score again, and they went into their final drive trailing by a 21–17 count after the Giants failed an attempted two-point conversion.\nThe game's final drive began on the New England 20-yard line. Brady's first two passes fell incomplete and then he was sacked by Tuck on third down, leaving the Patriots 16 yards from a first down and forcing them to use their final timeout. Facing heavy pressure in the pocket, Brady eluded linebacker Michael Boley and then threw a bullet to Deion Branch. Branch caught the ball and ran out of bounds at the 33-yard line for a first down. An 11-yard completion from Brady to Hernandez advanced the ball to the Patriots' 44, followed by a twelve-men on the field penalty against the Giants, which moved the ball to the Patriots' 49 with 9 seconds left. After an incomplete pass, Brady, on the game's final play, threw a Hail Mary pass intended for Hernandez in the end zone, but the ball was deflected by Giants defenders. Tight end Rob Gronkowski dove with outstretched arms toward the ball but was still a yard away when it hit the ground, ending Super Bowl XLVI and giving the Giants their fourth Super Bowl win in franchise history.\nStatistical overview.\nFor the Giants, Manning completed 30 of 40 passes for 296 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. Bradshaw was the top rusher of the game with 72 yards and a touchdown, also catching two passes for 19 yards. Nicks was the top receiver with 10 receptions for 109 yards. Blackburn, who had been cut by the Giants earlier in the season before being re-signed, had 6 total tackles and an interception. Tuck made 3 tackles and two sacks. For New England, Brady completed 27 of 41 passes for 276 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, becoming the first quarterback to throw a touchdown pass in five separate Super Bowls. His top target was Tight End/H-Back Aaron Hernandez, performing in a role similar to the one he played at Florida, catching 8 passes for 67 yards and one score. A 2011 4th-Round selection, Hernandez's stellar performance in the game would only add to the tragedy when his career was cut short by a self-destructive spiral into crime, resulting in his conviction in 2013 for the murder of Odin Lloyd. Fellow second-year TE Rob Gronkowski, who came into Super Bowl XLVI battling a severe ankle injury, tallied 2 catches for 26 yards and Welker, despite the infamous drop, finished with 7 receptions for 60 yards and two carries for 21. Defensively, linebackers Jerod Mayo and Brandon Spikes each had 8 solo tackles, 3 assists, and a forced fumble.\nWith the win the Giants became the fifth team to win at least four Super Bowls, while the Patriots became the fourth to lose four. At the time, Brady had yet to win in Lucas Oil Stadium and had not won a game in Indianapolis since 2007, when the Patriots defeated the Indianapolis Colts on their way to a perfect regular season. Belichick dropped to 3–2 as a head coach in the Super Bowl, while Tom Coughlin won his second Super Bowl in as many tries. Some news organizations, among them \"The St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", said that their victory made them NFL's version of the 2011 World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals, saying that these two championship teams that had been given the last rites by many near the end of the season, emerged as champions at the end. Eli Manning was the only quarterback to throw for more than 4,900 yards and win a Super Bowl in the same season until Patrick Mahomes threw for 5,250 yards and won Super Bowl LVII during the 2022 NFL season.\nThe Giants became the first team to have won Super Bowl games broadcast on all four U.S. national networks (CBS, ABC, Fox, and NBC).\nThe Giants and Patriots became the 3rd and 4th teams (after the Oakland Raiders and Pittsburgh Steelers) to appear in Super Bowls in four different decades (both in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s) and the second and third to appear in Super Bowls in four consecutive decades (joining the Pittsburgh Steelers). The Giants became the first and only team in Super Bowl history to win Super Bowls in four different decades (1986, 1990, 2007, 2011). The Patriots became the first and only team in Super Bowl history to lose Super Bowls in four different decades (1985, 1996, 2007, 2011).\nDan Shaughnessy said in a piece in \"The Boston Globe\" about Boston on the loss to the Giants under the headline, \"History Repeats\": \"Instead of celebrating a grand slam–championships in every major sport over a period of four years and four months–New Englanders are spitting out pieces of their broken luck, bracing for the avalanche of grief from the New Yorkers they envy so badly.\"\nThe Giants went into the half trailing 10–9. The Giants have trailed at halftime in all of their Super Bowl appearances, trailing 10–9 to the Broncos, 12–10 to the Bills, 10–0 to the Ravens, and 7–3 to the Patriots.\nThis would be the fourth time in the Giants' five Super Bowl appearances that they faced their AFC opponent earlier during the regular season. In every season in which the Giants have won the Super Bowl they have faced their AFC Super Bowl counterpart previously during the regular season.\nThe Giants are now 4–0 in Super Bowls in which Bill Belichick has been on the sidelines. Belichick was the Giants' defensive coordinator for their first two Super Bowl victories, and the opposing head coach in their last two. Three of the Giants' victories have come against AFC East teams, with the Giants having defeated the Buffalo Bills and Patriots twice.\nThe Giants continued their winning streak in road playoff games with their win in Super Bowl XLVI. The team won every playoff game they played away from their home stadium (Giants Stadium and MetLife Stadium) from 2007 to 2011. Prior to this run, last time the Giants were defeated in a game away from the Meadowlands was in 2006, when they were defeated by the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round. This streak came to an end in the 2016–17 NFL playoffs, where the Giants were defeated 38-13 by the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field in the Wild Card round. Two of the Giants' road playoff victories during this streak occurred at Lambeau.\nThis was the second Super Bowl, after Super Bowl X, resulting in a final score of 21–17 with the winning score including a safety and a missed extra point as part of its 21-point total (although in this case it was a failed 2-point attempt while in the earlier case it was a blocked kick).\nThis was the 5th set of teams to have a rematch in Super Bowl history and overall the 6th rematch. The others were the Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins, who met in Super Bowl VII and Super Bowl XVII; the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers, who met in Super Bowl X, Super Bowl XIII, and Super Bowl XXX and are the only teams to meet in the Super Bowl more than twice; the San Francisco 49ers and Cincinnati Bengals, who met in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII; and the Cowboys and Buffalo Bills, who met in Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII and are the only teams to face each other in two consecutive Super Bowls; and later the Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles becoming the 6th set of teams to have a rematch in Super Bowl history and 7th overall, meeting in Super Bowl LII after previously meeting in Super Bowl XXXIX.\nFinal statistics.\nSources: NFL.com Super Bowl XLVI, Super Bowl XLVI Play Finder NYG, Super Bowl XLVI Play Finder NE, The Football Database Super Bowl XLVI\nIndividual statistics.\n1Completions/attempts\n2Carries\n3Long gain\n4Receptions\n5Times targeted\nStarting lineups.\nSource:\nOfficials.\nThis was the last game officials wore the traditional white knickers.

        "title": "Marc Wilson (American football)",
        "text": "Marc Douglas Wilson (born February 15, 1957) is an American former professional football quarterback who played for 10 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the Oakland / Los Angeles Raiders. He played college football for the BYU Cougars, where he won the Sammy Baugh Trophy. Selected by the Raiders in the first round of the 1980 NFL Draft, Wilson spent seven seasons with the team. In his final two seasons, he was a member of the New England Patriots. Wilson was inducted to College Football Hall of Fame in 1996.\nEarly years.\nWilson was born in Bremerton, Washington. Raised in the greater Seattle area, he attended Shorecrest High School in Shoreline, Washington.\nCollege career.\nWilson attended Brigham Young University, where he played for the BYU Cougars football team from 1976 to 1979 and was one of the first in BYU's celebrated line of quarterbacks. Cougars coach LaVell Edwards operated a passing-oriented offense that allowed his quarterbacks to throw the ball almost every single down. Thus, Wilson was able to pile up huge passing numbers in an era when most teams mainly focused on running the ball. Wilson received a bachelor's degree in Economics from Brigham Young University in 1980. In 1996, he received an executive MBA from the University of Washington.\nHe first got a chance to start in the fifth game of the 1977 season, replacing All-American Gifford Nielsen, who had gone down after four contests with an injury. During that 1977 season, his sophomore year, he threw for seven touchdown passes in one game against Colorado State University, his first start. After that, he started most of BYU's games over the next two-and-a-half seasons, racking up a 22–4 record, though he did yield a few starts to budding star Jim McMahon. In 1979, he threw 250 completions for 3,720 yards and 29 touchdown passes, becoming the school's first consensus All-American. Highlights of his 1979 season included leading the team to an undefeated regular season and a berth in the Holiday Bowl, where he shared the MVP trophy with Indiana University cornerback Tim Wilbur in BYU's 38–37 loss. He finished fourth in the nation in passing efficiency, third in the Heisman voting, and was named the Senior Bowl MVP. Wilson's success paved the way for McMahon, Steve Young, Robbie Bosco, Ty Detmer, and other BYU quarterbacks, all of whom had similar performances in Edwards' system.\nFootball career.\nWilson was selected in the first round of the 1980 NFL Draft by the Oakland Raiders. As a rookie, he was a backup alongside Jim Plunkett on the Raiders to Dan Pastorini. A fractured leg injury for Pastorini opened the door for Plunkett because of his experience over the rookie, which resulted in a trip to Super Bowl XV and a victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. The following year, Wilson would start nine games for the Raiders following a season ending injury to Plunkett. He won five of those games while throwing for 2,311 yards on 14 touchdowns to 19 interceptions. In 1982, he was the backup to Plunkett during a strike shortened NFL season consisting of only nine games. In 1983, he became the starting quarterback for the Raiders in the middle of the season after Plunkett was benched for ineffectiveness, but it lasted just three games before a broken shoulder against the Kansas City Chiefs knocked him out for the entire season. The Raiders, led by Plunkett, would go on to a Super Bowl XVIII victory against the Washington Redskins. \nIn 1984, he was the starter for ten games and won six of them while throwing for 2,151 yards with fifteen touchdowns to seventeen interceptions. He finished the regular season with a broken thumb suffered during a matchup against the Chicago Bears, but was benched in favor of Plunkett for the playoffs, where the Raiders lost in the wild card round. Following another injury to Plunkett in Week 3 of the 1985 season, Wilson had his first (and as it turned out only) chance to play as the regular starter. He started thirteen games and led the Raiders to eleven wins and an AFC West title while throwing for a career high 2,608 yards with 16 touchdowns to 21 interceptions. He made the start in the AFC wild card game against the New England Patriots. He threw 11-of-27 for 135 yards with a touchdown and three interceptions.\nIn 1986, he started eight games and threw 1,721 yards with 12 touchdowns to 15 interceptions with the Raiders rotating Plunkett and Wilson as the starting quarterback. He closed out his Raiders career in 1987 as the starter for seven games (two wins) while throwing for 2,070 yards with 12 touchdowns to eight interceptions. He moved on to the Patriots (after being cut by the Green Bay Packers in training camp) in 1989 and started 10 games in two seasons combined. He retired at the age of 33 in 1990."

        "title": "Lacrosse in Australia",
        "text": "Lacrosse in Australia is a minor sport, with a long and proud history dating back to 1876, with a small but dedicated community of participants and volunteers. The established centres for lacrosse are in the greater metropolitan areas of Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth. In these cities there are organised weekend field lacrosse competitions for men and women at senior and junior levels, played over the winter months (April until September). In the off-season, there are informal box lacrosse and sofcrosse competitions, though the majority of players in Australia are mostly of the field lacrosse type. Some lacrosse is also played in Sydney, South East Queensland, Canberra, Ballarat and Bendigo, it is very much at the developmental level.\nLacrosse in Australia is now governed by a single governing body, Lacrosse Australia (LA), known until 2021 as the Australian Lacrosse Association, following the merger of Lacrosse Australia and Women's Lacrosse Australia, who had until 2008 governed the men's and women's versions of the games independently. The move to a unified national body was precipitated by the withholding of funds by the Australian federal government.\nHistory.\nMen's lacrosse.\nVictoria.\nThe pioneer of lacrosse in Victoria (and Australia as a whole) was a Canadian, Lambton L. Mount. He came to the Victorian goldfields as a fourteen-year-old with his family in 1853 but it was not until 1875 that he was moved to revive his early boyhood memories of lacrosse. After watching the football final between Carlton and Melbourne in that year it occurred to him that lacrosse was a superior game.\nIn April 1876 Mount wrote to the Australasian Newspaper to announce that he was arranging to import forty lacrosse sticks from Canada and intended to start lacrosse and establish the Melbourne Lacrosse Club. He succeeded and the first practice match of this club took place on 22 June 1876 between 15-20 players at Albert Park. The Melbourne club continued to promote the sport and arranged matches between the \"Reds\" and \"Blues\" in Albert Park during 1877-78. By 1879, four clubs had been formed with some 120 players. These four clubs Melbourne, Fitzroy, South Melbourne and Carlton formed the Victorian Lacrosse Association in July 1879 for the purpose of coordinating matches. The Governor of Victoria G. A. C. Phipps, was the inaugural Patron.\nSouth Australia.\nLacrosse began in South Australia with the formation of the Adelaide Lacrosse Club on Friday, 6 April 1883 at the Prince Alfred Hotel. Practice was held by the club in the South Parklands. By 1887 North Adelaide (who still exist today), Noarlunga and Knightsbridge (located in what is now Leabrook) had joined Adelaide to play regular games in the city, and the South Australian Lacrosse Association (now Lacrosse SA) was formed in 1888. Nobel Prize winning Professor Bragg, a founding member of the North Adelaide club established University in 1889.\nLacrosse soon spread around the fledgling province, and the game grew in popularity in the small city of Adelaide and through the country towns, with large crowds recorded at the race course fixtures. Teams were formed at Port Pirie, Jamestown, Port Augusta, Port Germein, Gawler, Kapunda, Angaston, Riverton and Murray Bridge.\nWestern Australia.\nThe introduction of lacrosse into Western Australia was the indirect consequence of gold discoveries in the Eastern Goldfields. Perth was a major gateway to the goldfields as well as Western Australia's commercial hub. The city's population tripled from just 8,447 in 1891 to 27,553 ten years later. C Atkins, the part owner of a sport store in Barrack Street, took the lead in establishing lacrosse in Perth. On 15 May 1896, \"The Inquirer\" and \"Commercial News\" reported that the sports store had lacrosse sticks for sale, and Atkins made contact with two recently arrived lacrosse players from the eastern states, Fred Parsons and Fred Wingrove. At the meeting held at the United Service Hotel and called at the instigation of Atkins, the lacrosse pioneers Parsons &amp; Wingrove helped form two clubs, Perth and Fremantle, in 1896. Two further clubs, Mercantile (based on a merchandising warehouse) and Cottesloe (later Banks) were formed in 1897. A formal competition commenced in 1898 with Mercantile winning the first premiership in that year.\nThe first report of lacrosse being played in the Eastern Goldfields was in May 1898 when teams called Kalgoorlie and Mines (whose home was the town of Boulder) met. During 1899, a \"Coastal\" team visited the Goldfields where local devotee Arthur O'Connor was nurturing the sport – principally from Coolgardie. This exhibition game became a regular feature of the Western Australian sporting calendar until 1914, when a downturn in the gold industry and the outbreak of World War I signalled the end of the Eastern Goldfields Lacrosse Association. After the Great Depression of the early 1930s the Eastern Goldfields Lacrosse Association was re-established in 1935 and existed for another four years when World War II caused men to join up. Later attempts to revive the game after the war failed.\nQueensland.\nThe Brisbane Lacrosse Club was formed following a meeting at the YMCA on Monday 2 May 1887, and following the formation of a club at Ipswich and the imminent formation of one at South Brisbane, The Queensland Lacrosse Union was formed following a meeting at Lennon's Hotel on Tuesday 14 February 1888. In 1888 the Savage Lacrosse Club held a smoke social and annual meeting. Photographic records exist of interstate teams in 1889, 1904, 1905 and 1906. In July and August 1906 two interstate games were played against Victoria, the first game was won by Victoria 16–12. In the second game Queensland defeated Victoria 15–6.\nA club had formed at Rockhampton in 1903. In 1907 there were various lacrosse clubs in the Brisbane metropolitan area. Photographs dated 1907 are labelled with the club names of Ottawa, Mohican, Delaware, Buffalo, Iroquois, Toombul and Wallaroo. In 1908 an association had been formed at Toowoomba, with a local competition running for several years.\nThe Kalinga Park sporting grounds were opened in 1910 with the support of local sporting clubs including the Kalinga Lacrosse Club. \nBy the 1920s lacrosse was being played at Norman Park after being promoted by the Wilson family of Waratah Foundry fame.\nThe Nudgee Lacrosse Club also had a field at the Nudgee Boorah Ring in the 1920s and 1930s.\nDespite this early success, lacrosse in Queensland was reduced to a small group of enthusiasts in the post World War II era. By the 1980s, all existing lacrosse clubs had disappeared. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), lacrosse was played on an occasional basis in the Brisbane, Surfers Paradise and Townsville areas. A Queensland Lacrosse Association was in operation with the support of expatriate Victorians and local enthusiasts.\nRecent efforts by the Queensland Lacrosse Association have resulted in new lacrosse clubs being formed in Brisbane (2009), the Gold Coast (2011), Toowoomba (2011) and the Sunshine Coast (2012). Additionally, student clubs have been formed at James Cook University campuses in Cairns (2013) and Townsville (2014), and the University of Queensland in Brisbane in 2016.\nNew South Wales.\nLacrosse was introduced into New South Wales (NSW) on 19 July 1883 after a meeting of gentlemen at Ramford's Cambridge Club Hotel led to the formation of the Sydney Lacrosse Club. \"The Manly Daily\" records the local lacrosse club as having won their season in 1930. Other early lacrosse clubs included Burwood District, Balmain, Camden, Granville, Marrickville, Mohican, Mosman, Newtown, North Sydney, Petersham, Stanmore, St Stephen's Institute, University, Waverly and Wentworth. Lacrosse games were played on the Sydney Cricket ground in the 1930s; a NSW state team existed during this same period. The sport was sufficiently strong for a visiting Canadian team from Vancouver to tour Sydney in 1934. Lacrosse was also played at Glebe prior to World War II. Lacrosse in Sydney in the early period included an A and B division and competition was held for the Lassetter's Cup.\nA Broken Hill Lacrosse Association existed in 1909, this included a YMCA Lacrosse Club.\nLacrosse was revived in NSW during the early 1990s by a small dedicated group of men and women. Initially this involved games of mixed lacrosse at Neutral Bay. A men's team competed successfully at the Paradise Lacrosse Tournament on the Gold Coast under the name \"Basically Naked\". Junior lacrosse began with a pilot at Gordon with the employment of two development officers, this saw up to 60 juniors playing modified lacrosse, some of whom went on to play the full version of the game. With the employment of a Development Officer by Lacrosse Australia, based in Sydney, it was hoped that the junior and senior games would take off. Teams/clubs were set up in Pennant Hills, Concord, Woollahra, Mosman and Sutherland. Games were more often than not held at Centennial Park in Sydney, although in the beginning the venue was Edgecliff, with some exhibition games held at Concord, Mosman and Sutherland.\nTasmania.\nIt was reported in the Hobart Mercury that lacrosse was played in Tasmania in the mid-1880s, with the New Town Lacrosse Club calling for new members in 1884. In 1906 a number of lacrosse games were played by Victorian-based teams against Northern and Southern Tasmanian teams. In 1916 the Northern Tasmania Lacrosse Association abandoned the premiership competition due to the enlistment of men for the war effort. Lacrosse players were amongst those who were wounded or killed in the war. In 1932 a Tasmanian team played Victoria as a curtain raiser to the North versus South Football game. In the \"Hobart Mercury\" of 29 April 1940 it was lamented that although lacrosse had flourished prior to the Great War it had now died out.\nWomen's lacrosse.\nPre-war.\nWomen's lacrosse in Australia can trace its history as far back as 1904, when Miss Gwynneth Morris, a physical education teacher at Merton Hall, Melbourne Church of England Girl's Grammar School, introduced the sport as part of the school's commitment to team sports.\nIn 1907, ladies were practising lacrosse in the West Australian Goldfields under the tutelage of men from the Kalgoorlie Lacrosse Club.\nThe earliest recorded women's lacrosse club, the St George's Ladies' Lacrosse Club, was formed in 1913 in New South Wales, soon followed by a club at Manly. By 1914 there were four clubs, and a competition was in place. The NSW ladies' competition was suspended in July 1915, presumably in relation to the First World War, with no further reporting of competition after that date.\nBy 1930, girls' lacrosse was being instructed by Miss Louie Hardy at St Peter's Collegiate Girls' School and Girton House School in South Australia. In 1931, the South Australian Lacrosse Association discussed the introduction of women's lacrosse in the state.\nIn 1936, the Victorian Women's Amateur Lacrosse Association was formed. Games were centred around teams from the YWCA and Williamstown. By 1940, war time conditions saw the sport go into recession.\nRe-establishment.\nIt took until 1962 for women's lacrosse in Victoria to recommence. With support from Mal Taylor of the Williamstown Lacrosse Club 4 teams were formed (Williamstown 2, Footscray and Malvern). Mrs Joy Parker (former secretary of the Victorian Women's Amateur Lacrosse Association) became president of the newly reformed women's association. The South Australian Women's Lacrosse Association was also formed around the same time, with competition commencing in 1962. With lacrosse sticks in Australia in short supply, the South Australian Women's Lacrosse Association sold 12 women's sticks to the Victorian association for £4.\nIn 1962, Mal Taylor noted an advertisement in an Adelaide paper for women to play lacrosse. Mal used this as an avenue to create an interstate match. Under the guidance of Mrs Joy Parker, the Australian Women's Lacrosse Council (AWLC) was formed. Mrs Parker became the inaugural President following the first interstate match between Victoria and South Australia with Mrs Titter Secretary and Mrs L Rolley Treasurer.\nIn 1965, the Men's Lacrosse carnival was held in Perth, Western Australia and the AWLC were invited to play their annual interstate match between Victoria and South Australia during this carnival. The Western Australians were persuaded to form an Association and at the same time to join the AWLC. (Coincidentally they also entered into what became the first Women's Lacrosse Championship).\nGrowth.\nIn 1975, the Tasmanian Women's Lacrosse Association was formed in Hobart. In 1978, Tasmania became a full member of the AWLC and entered their first official team in the Championships in Perth in 1978.\nThe Senior National Championships have been held on a yearly basis since 1978 with South Australia reigning supreme from 1985 through until 1996 when Victoria defeated them for the first time in the final for 12 years; a monumental win for Victoria and an end to a 12-year awesome victory stretch by South Australia.\nIn 1970, the first Under 16 National Championship was held and in 1982, the first U19 interstate match was played between South Australia and Victoria at the Senior Nationals in Adelaide.\nLacrosse in Australia today.\nLocal competitions.\nAt present, the main centres for lacrosse are in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, with each city hosting multi-division club competitions in their respective metropolitan areas. Each of these cities have State League competitions for both men and women, which attract overseas players (the majority from the United States) who are hosted by local clubs to help strengthen their teams as well as develop junior lacrosse programs. The majority of teams, both senior and junior, in lacrosse competition throughout Australia are club teams, with a small few school and university teams that participate in club competition.\nInterstate competition.\nInterstate competition, a legacy from the time when Australia consisted of its separate colonies, is a feature of many sports in Australia, lacrosse being no exception. Competitions are typically held as an annual week-long carnival, with the venue rotated between states. The \"Nationals\" are a highlight of the Australian lacrosse calendar, and feature the best lacrosse talent in the country with games played to a very high standard.\nThe first ever Interstate (then Intercolonial) match in Australia took place in Brisbane in 1887, with New South Wales defeating their hosts Queensland by 1 goal to nil. In 1888 Victoria defeated South Australia 5 – 1 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the first match between these two colonies. In 1910 the first Australian interstate lacrosse carnival was held at the MCG.\nAt the senior and under 18 age level, each state sends its select representative team. At under 15 level, a national tournament exists whereby member states send anywhere between one and three representative teams, in an effort to level out the competition between stronger and developing lacrosse regions. At present there are national carnivals at the senior, under 18 and under 15 levels for both men and women. Often a number of these events are held concurrently at the same venue.\nThe Australian Lacrosse League was introduced in 2004 to replace the senior men's national carnival by instead having state teams play each other twice, with double-headers (a Saturday and Sunday game) played over three weekends. Each state hosts one double-header and travels for the other. The two teams with the best win–loss record over the round-robin tournament progress to the final, played on the weekend following the last round-robin match. Currently, the strongest lacrosse-playing states of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia compete in the ALL, but the long-term goal of the league is to include a team from every Australian state. After four years, however, a lack of support from South Australia and Victoria due to the increasing cost of participating the ALL-style competition saw the national championship revert to the traditional carnival format in 2008.\nThe first Australian Club Lacrosse Championships was contested in Adelaide on 7 June 2008. The women's championship was won by the Newport Ladies' Lacrosse Club of Victoria, while the men's championship was won by the Woodville Lacrosse Club of South Australia. The success of the inaugural event has led to the club national championships returning in 2009 with an expanded format, involving the premiers of the three major lacrosse playing states, plus a wildcard entry from one of those states to create a final four format. Due to the moving of the Nationals to the June long weekend, the 2013 Championships were held on 5 and 6 October 2013. Despite being held after the end of the 2013 season, it featured the respective state premiers of the 2012 season. Wembley declined the invitation to send its women's team, while Williamstown's men's team were a last minute withdrawal from the men's tournament. The women's event was a two-team affair with a single championship match, Brighton (SA) claiming its fourth successive Australian Club Championship with a victory over Newport (Vic). SA's Glenelg Lacrosse Club filled the vacancy left by Williamstown (Vic), competing with local rivals Brighton and WA's Bayswater and Wembley Lacrosse Clubs for the men's title. Bayswater became the first team from Western Australia to win the Australian Club Championship in defeating Brighton.\nAustralia in international competition.\nIn 1907 Australia's first international lacrosse match against Canada was played at the MCG before a crowd of 14,000.\nAustralia has an important presence in the international scene, consistently finishing in the top three of the men's world championships, though have never won the trophy. At the 2014 World Lacrosse Championship, Australia finished outside the top three for the first time at the senior level, finishing in fourth spot (behind Canada, the United States and the Iroquois Nationals). They have also been the runner-up at the first three Under-19 Men's World Lacrosse Championship.\nAustralia's national women's teams have fared even better. Despite having only a small fraction of the playing pool of other countries, Australia have won two senior women's world championships (in 1986 and in 2005), as well as the inaugural Under 19 world championship in 1995. The main rival to Australia in international women's competition is the United States.\nThe World Men's Lacrosse Championships have been held in Australia three times – in 1974 (Melbourne), 1990 (Perth) and 2002 (Perth), while the Women's Lacrosse World Cup has been held once in Australia, hosted in Perth in 1989."

The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) held an election to select from among recent players; Ozzie Smith was elected.\nThe Veterans Committee did not hold an election; the 2001 rules changes provided that elections for players retired over 20 years would be held every other year, with elections of non-players (managers, umpires and executives) held every fourth year. The Committee held elections in 2001 for players who were active no later than 1979. The next Veterans Committee election, for both categories, was in 2003.\nThe induction ceremonies were held on July 28 in Cooperstown, with Commissioner Bud Selig presiding.\nThe BBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1982 or later, but not after 1996; the ballot included candidates from the 2001 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1996. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2002 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 8, 2002. The ballot consisted of 28 players; 472 ballots were cast, with 354 votes required for election. A total of 2810 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.96 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote (24 votes) will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The one candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The 8 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nLuis Tiant was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly-eligible players included twelve All-Stars, one of whom (Steve Howe) was not on the ballot, representing a total of 49 All-Star selections. Among the candidates were 15-time All Star Ozzie Smith, 8-time All Star Andre Dawson, 6-time All-Star Alan Trammell and 5-time All Star Tim Wallach. The field also included two Rookies of the Year (Dawson and Steve Howe), one Cy Young Award winner (Frank Viola) and one MVP (Dawson). Finally, Ozzie Smith holds the record for Gold Gloves at Shortstop, with thirteen.\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Mike Aldrete, Joe Boever, Chris Bosio, Mark Carreon, Rob Deer, Mark Eichhorn, Félix Fermín, Marvin Freeman, Lee Guetterman, Chris Gwynn, John Habyan, Mel Hall, Steve Howe, Dion James, Mike Kingery, Kirk McCaskill, Roger McDowell, Rich Monteleone, Jeff Parrett, Alejandro Peña, Dick Schofield, Zane Smith, Milt Thompson, and Dave Valle.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nJoe Falls received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award\nhonoring a baseball writer. (The award was voted at the December 2001 meeting of the BBWAA, dated 2001, and conferred in the summer 2002 ceremonies.)\nFord C. Frick Award.\nHarry Kalas received the Ford C.

        "title": "Joe Cunningham (baseball)",
        "text": "Joseph Robert Cunningham Jr. (August 27, 1931 – March 25, 2021) was an American baseball first baseman and outfielder who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago White Sox, and Washington Senators from 1954 to 1966. He batted and threw left-handed, and was a two-time All-Star.\nCunningham batted .291 with 980 hits over 1,141 career games. He finished his career with more walks (599) than strikeouts (369).\nEarly life.\nCunningham was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on August 27, 1931, and was raised in Saddle River Township (since renamed as Saddle Brook, New Jersey). He attended Lodi High School in nearby Lodi and was signed as an amateur free agent by the St. Louis Cardinals before the 1949 season.\nProfessional career.\nCunningham played four seasons in the minor leagues from 1949 to 1951, and the first part of the 1954 season. He served in the military for two years during the Korean War. He made his MLB debut on June 30, 1954, at the age of 22, batting 2-for-5 with his first major league home run and five runs batted in (RBI) in a 11–3 win over the Cincinnati Redlegs. In his first four major league games, Cunningham became the first Cardinals player to hit at least two home runs. This feat was equaled 62 years later on April 6, 2016, when Jeremy Hazelbaker also hit two home runs in his first four games.\nCunningham's 1959 season was arguably his best individual year. He led the National League in on-base percentage at .453 and batted .345 to finish second to Hank Aaron for the NL batting title. He was selected to both the first and second All-Star game that season.\nCunningham was traded from the Cardinals to the Chicago White Sox after the 1961 season in exchange for long-time star Minnie Miñoso. Although his first season as the White Sox first baseman was successful, Cunningham would never fully recover from a broken collarbone suffered in a collision on June 3, 1963. He played only 89 games in 1964 and 95 games in 1965, with his batting average dropping to .231 and .229, respectively. He played his final major league game on April 17, 1966, at the age of 34.\nIn a 12-season career, Cunningham posted a .291 batting average (980-3362) with 64 home runs, 525 runs scored, and 436 RBI in 1141 games played. His on-base percentage was .403 (#48 all time) and slugging percentage was .417. He compiled a .989 fielding percentage. His primary position was first base, in which he played in 608 games. He also played in the outfield, appearing in 404 games in right field and 46 games in left field. Cunningham collected 599 walks in his career and struck out only 369 times.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter retiring as a player, Cunningham returned to the Redbirds and managed in their farm system at the Class A level from 1968 to 1971. He was subsequently appointed as director of sales of the Cardinals in 1972. In that capacity, he oversaw the establishment of the group and season ticket departments. He was also influential in starting up team programs such as community nights and high school games at Busch Memorial Stadium. He went on to work as a coach for the Cardinals during the 1982 season.\nCunningham acted as the Cardinals' community relations director in the early 1990s. He collaborated closely with schools in the St. Louis area and in devising the \"Say No To Drugs\" program (which later became the Fredbird &amp; Friends Elementary School Program). In recognition of his work for the franchise, the Cardinals dedicated a new section of Busch Stadium as \"Cunningham Corner\" in 2015.\nPersonal life.\nCunningham was married to Kathe Dillard for 60 years until his death. One of their two sons, Joe III, played in the minor leagues from 1984 to 1988 and also worked as a batting instructor and manager in the Cardinals' farm system.\nCunningham died on March 25, 2021, at his home in Chesterfield, Missouri. He was 89."

        "text": "Sean Joseph Morey (born February 26, 1976) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Brown Bears. He was selected by the New England Patriots in the seventh round of the 1999 NFL Draft. Morey also played for the Philadelphia Eagles, Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals. He won Super Bowl XL with the Steelers against the Seattle Seahawks.\nEarly years.\nMorey graduated from Marshfield High School of Marshfield, Massachusetts in 1994. Because of his light weight, Morey did not receive a scholarship offer from his dream school Boston College and had a partial scholarship offer from Northeastern University, so he decided to attend Hebron Academy. At Hebron, Morey led the football team to win the New England Prep School Class D Championship in 1994. He would win All-Evergreen League Team, Evergreen League MVP, and Class D New England Player of the Year while playing football for Hebron. He played both wide receiver and defensive back while in high school.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from Hebron Academy, he attended Brown University, where he finished with an Ivy League record 251 receptions for 3,850 yards and 40 touchdowns, and was voted Ivy League player of the year in 1997 — when he caught 74 passes for an Ivy League-record 1,434 yards and 15 touchdowns. Sean was one of seven Brown players selected as First-Team All-Ivy League in 1998, including Stephen Campbell (WR), Zack Burns (TE), Tim Hevesy (C), James Perry (QB), Alex Pittz (CB) and Ephraim \"Fry\" Wernick (DL). Sean Morey finished his career second in all-time receiving yards in Division I-AA behind only Jerry Rice. After his college career, Sean was the first Brown player to have his number retired. He also earned a degree with honors in organizational behavior and management.\nMorey won the Ivy League Bushnell Cup in 1997.\nProfessional career.\nNew England Patriots.\nMorey was originally selected with the 35th pick of the seventh round of the 1999 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. He remained with the Patriots until the end of the 2000 season, with the majority of his time being spent on the practice squad.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nIn 2001 Morey joined the Philadelphia Eagles where he would become 2003 Special Teams MVP. That same year he was nominated for Dr. Z's (\"Sports Illustrated\") All-Pro team as a special teams player. Also in 2003, Morey became the 12th player in NFL Europe history to catch 3 touchdown passes in a game while playing for the Barcelona Dragons.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nThe Steelers acquired Morey September 6, 2004 as an unrestricted free agent. He was captain of special teams for Pittsburgh. Morey's role for the Steelers was mostly special teams; he did not usually line up at wide receiver. In 2006, Morey's role expanded because of injuries to wide receivers Hines Ward and Cedrick Wilson. He finished the season with just 2 receptions (bringing his career total to 3), but also contributed with his blocking and with his work on special teams. He collected a team-high 21 special teams tackles while also returning eight kickoffs for 202 yards (25.3 yard avg.). In a Week 11 24-20 victory over the Browns, he had a 76-yard kickoff return.\nArizona Cardinals.\nThe Arizona Cardinals signed Morey on March 15, 2007 to a three-year free agent contract. Morey rejoined ex-Steeler coaches Ken Whisenhunt (head coach), Russ Grimm (assistant head coach / offensive line) and Kevin Spencer (special teams) in Arizona.\nThe Cardinals released Morey on March 17, 2008, but re-signed him on March 26.\nMorey blocked a punt in overtime against the Cowboys on October 12, 2008 that was run in by teammate, Monty Beisel, for the game-winning touchdown. It was the first time in NFL history that a game was ended in overtime by a blocked punt that resulted in a touchdown.\nMorey was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2008 as a special teamer.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nMorey signed with the Seattle Seahawks on March 29, 2010. He never played a game for them, however, announcing his retirement due to concussions just hours before the start of training camp on July 31.\nCoaching.\nIn February 2014, Morey accepted the head coach position for the Sprint Football team at Princeton University. For the two previous years, he was a Department of Athletics Fellow for general administration at Princeton. Princeton shut down the sprint football team after two seasons with Morey as coach; Morey failed to win a single game as coach of the Tigers, continuing a 16-year-long losing streak.\nNow, Morey is a high school football coach at Notre Dame High School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey as a Defensive Coordinator.\nConcussion activism.\nIn May 2014, Morey, along with a group of plaintiffs, filed a formal objection to the National Football League Players' Concussion Injury Litigation and Proposed Settlement being overseen by US District Court Judge Anita Brody. The objection sought to highlight what some players see as a narrow scope of the settlement, claiming, among other things, that \"The settlement would have compensated only a small subset of [mild-traumatic-brain-injury-related] injuries to the exclusion of all others.\"\nPersonal.\nHis wife, Cara formerly played defense for the Brampton Thunder of the Canadian Women's Hockey League in Ontario after starting at Brown in ice hockey and field hockey. His father, Dennis, was also a semi-pro football player with several teams, including the Brockton, MA Pros, his grandfather, Joe, and his great uncle, Dick, both have been inducted to the Bridgewater State Hall of Fame for basketball. He has three daughters, Devan, Kathryn \"Kate\", and Shea \"Piper\".\nMorey was featured on an episode of the Canadian sports/comedy program \"Cabbie on the Street\", where it was revealed he lives in Toronto during the offseason. Morey appeared in \"Sports Illustrated\"'s \"Faces in the Crowd\" feature in the magazine's January 12, 1998 issue.\nMorey and his wife Cara were featured in a November 2007 episode of the HGTV show \"Divine Design\".\nIn October 2010, Morey was named co-chair of the NFL Players Association's newly formed Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury Committee. Morey suffered more than twenty concussions in his career. Morey's committee has two main goals: the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of concussions and traumatic brain injuries in active players and research into the long-term cumulative effects of such injuries on NFL players.\nOn January 31, 2014, Morey and his wife were interviewed about traumatic brain injury in football players by Melissa Block on NPR's \"All Things Considered.\""

        "text": "Michael McColly \"Butch\" Johnson (born May 28, 1954) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys and Denver Broncos. He played college football for the UC Riverside Highlanders and was selected in the third round (87th overall) of the 1976 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nJohnson attended Dorsey High School where he practiced football and track. In 1972, he finished second-place in the pole vault event at the All-City meet.\nHe accepted an athletic scholarship from Division II University of California, Riverside as a pole vaulter. In 1974, he was named to the second-team UPI Little All Coast Football team.\nIn 1975, he led the nation in receiving with 67 catches for 1,027 yards, in just eight games (he missed 2 contests with an injury), while earning All-American honors. The school dropped the football program the year after he graduated. He finished his college career with 139\nreceptions for 2,106 yards and 17 touchdowns.\nIn 2012, he was inducted into the UCR Sports Hall of Fame. The next year, he was inducted into the Riverside Sport Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nJohnson was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 3rd round (87th overall) of the 1976 NFL Draft. In 1978, he tied an NFL record with the most punt returns (9) in a game, while playing against the Buffalo Bills. He set a franchise record with 45 punt returns for 489 yards. He also returned 28 kickoffs for 693 yards (24.8-yard avg.).\nIn 1977, he alternated with Golden Richards, recording 12 receptions for 135 yards (11.3-yard average) and one touchdown. He also returned a club record 50 punts and led the team with 22 kickoff returns. At the end of the year in Super Bowl XII against the Denver Broncos, he had his most notable career highlight, a 45 yard diving touchdown reception from Roger Staubach, which is considered to be a \"Super Bowl Classic\". In the Dallas Morning News newspaper, after Super Bowl XII, on Monday, January 16, 1978, the front page photo was titled \"Outfielder Butch\", referring to his diving touchdown grab in the end zone, despite a broken thumb he suffered earlier in the game.\nIn 1978, although he couldn't earn a starting role over Tony Hill, he became the leading punt returner in franchise history while breaking again his single-season record with 51 punt returns and also placed second on the Cowboys all-time kickoff return list. He had another touchdown reception in Super Bowl XIII which the Cowboys lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, making him the second player in NFL history to score touchdowns in back-to-back Super Bowls.\nIn 1979, he fractured his right little finger in the preseason finale against the Steelers and was forced to miss the first 5 games. With both Hill and Drew Pearson having 1,000-yard seasons, his opportunities were limited. He started in the 15th game against the Philadelphia Eagles in place of an injured Pearson, and caught a deflected 17-yard pass for the decisive touchdown in the playoff-clinching victory. He also stopped returning punts and kickoffs.\nIn 1981, he started the first 6 games in place of an injured Hill, finishing the season with 25 receptions for 552 yards and 5 receiving touchdowns (tied for the team lead). He also developed a touchdown celebration known as the \"California Quake\", where he would simulate pulling guns out of holsters and proceed to shoot them and shake. It became one of the most famous individual celebrations in league history, and one of the reasons the NFL banned rehearsed end-zone touchdown celebrations.\nIn 1983, he had his best year with 41 receptions for 561 yards, but he had grown tired of his third receiver status and requested a trade. On April 12, 1984, even though Pearson had suffered a career-ending injury, the Cowboys granted his wishes and traded him to the Houston Oilers in exchange for wide receiver Mike Renfro, plus the right to swap second-round picks in the 1984 NFL Draft and the Oilers' fifth-rounder in the 1985 NFL Draft. A year later, the Cowboys used that fifth round pick to select running back Herschel Walker.\nFor a long time he was considered one of the best-backup wide receivers in the NFL, but during his 8 seasons with the Cowboys he could never earn a starter position. As the third receiver during that time, he was primarily known for his acrobatic and clutch receptions. Besides leaving as the second leading punt returner in franchise history, he also was one of two players in club history to rank in the top ten career list in both kickoff and punt return average yards.\nHouston Oilers.\nIn 1984, Johnson's outrageous personality and flamboyant on-field antics wore thin with the Houston Oilers very quickly, who after 3 deliberately poor played preseason games, traded him to the Denver Broncos in exchange of a third round draft choice (#58-Tyrone Davis) on August 20.\nDenver Broncos.\nIn 1984, he reunited with head coach Dan Reeves who was his offensive coordinator with the Cowboys. He had career highs with 11 starts, 42 receptions (third on the team) for 587 yards (second on the team) and 6 receiving touchdowns (second on the team). Against the New England Patriots, he posted 9 receptions for 156 yards.\nThe next year, an injury slowed his performance and eventually lost his starting job to Vance Johnson. He registered 8 starts, 19 receptions for 380 yards, a 20-yard average (led the team) and 3 touchdowns, but went 6 weeks late in the season without a single catch. He was released on August 18, 1986.\nJohnson played in the NFL for 10 seasons, catching 193 passes for 3,091 yards and 28 touchdowns. He appeared in 5 NFC Championship Games and 2 Super Bowls. He also tied the Super Bowl records for most fumble recoveries in one game and most career fumble recoveries (2).\nPersonal life.\nHis brother in law was the late singer-songwriter Bill Withers. Former Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke is his second cousin."

        "text": "Joshua Clell Brown (born April 29, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a placekicker in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Brown was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the seventh round of the 2003 NFL draft. He also played for the St. Louis Rams, Cincinnati Bengals and New York Giants.\nBrown was released by the Giants in 2016, after it was made public that he had admitted to an abusive relationship with his wife.\nEarly years.\nBrown was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He began his football career after his family moved from Tulsa when he was in eighth-grade and he subsequently attended Foyil High School.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nBrown was selected by the Seattle Seahawks with the 222nd overall pick in the 2003 NFL draft. On October 5, 2003, In a game against the Green Bay Packers, Brown kicked a 58-yard field goal, the longest of his career. On January 4, 2004, Brown made his postseason debut against the Green Bay Packers and kicked two field goals as well as all three PATs. On October 10, 2004, after an injury to Tom Rouen, Brown punted for the first time in his career, a 35-yarder, against the St. Louis Rams. On October 17, 2004, Brown kicked a career-high four field goals (33, 40, 28 and 31 yards) against the New England Patriots. On October 23, 2005, while playing against the Dallas Cowboys he made two field goals over 50-yards: a 55-yarder and a 50-yarder as time expired to win the game.\nOn October 15, 2006, he kicked a 54-yard game-winning field goal while time ran out against the St. Louis Rams to win the game 30–28. Although it would have been a 49-yard kick, Seattle was called for an illegal formation penalty. Unlike a false start penalty there was no 10-second run-off so Brown still had a chance to kick, albeit from 54-yards out. On November 27, 2006, he tied his career best by kicking four field goals in a snowy \"Monday Night Football\" game against the Green Bay Packers, with all four field goals made in the first half. On December 3, 2006, Brown kicked a 51-yard field goal to win the game against the Denver Broncos, making it his fourth game winning kick in the last minute in the 2006 season.\nOn February 22, 2007, the Seattle Seahawks used their franchise tag on Brown. On November 18, 2007, Brown made highlights by tackling and nearly stripping the ball from Pro Bowl kick returner Devin Hester of the Chicago Bears during a third-quarter kickoff. On January 5, 2008, Brown kicked a 50-yard career-high postseason field goal in the NFC Wild Card Game against the Washington Redskins.\nSt. Louis Rams.\nOn February 29, 2008, Brown signed with the St. Louis Rams who made him the NFL's highest paid kicker at the time. The Seattle Seahawks had offered him comparable money, but with an extra year and back loaded the whole deal. This would have made him the highest paid kicker, but he took offense to the fact that the Seahawks' contract was something Brown got offered after visiting the Rams. In an interview on Seattle sports radio station KJR 950 he stated that he had not wanted to be a \"slave to the businessman,\" a statement that was ridiculed by Seattle media and fans.\nOn October 12, 2008, Brown kicked four field goals, including the game-winning 49-yarder as time expired against Washington Redskins. On November 1, 2009, Brown threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Fells with 54 seconds remaining in the first half against the Detroit Lions. On August 13, 2011, Brown made a 60-yard field goal in a preseason game against the Indianapolis Colts. Had it been a regular season game, it would have recorded as a career long, but in preseason games stats are not recorded. The Rams cut him in April 2012 in preparation for drafting Greg Zuerlein in the 2012 NFL draft. He was in the final year of his $14.2 million five-year deal with the Rams.\nNew York Jets.\nBrown was signed by the New York Jets on May 1, 2012, to compete with incumbent Nick Folk. Brown was released by the team on August 27, 2012.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nBrown was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals on December 6, 2012, due to an injury to Mike Nugent. Brown beat out Neil Rackers and Billy Cundiff for the job. On December 23, 2012, he kicked the game-winning field goal against the Pittsburgh Steelers to send the Bengals to their first back-to-back playoff berths since the 1981–1982 seasons.\nNew York Giants.\nBrown signed with the New York Giants on March 13, 2013. In his first season, he went 23-of-26 in field goals and 31-of-31 in extra points. On December 22, 2013, Brown kicked a game-winning 45-yarder in overtime against the Detroit Lions. On October 27, 2013, he kicked a career-high five field goals against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nIn 2014 Brown signed a two-year, $2.6 million contract with the Giants. In his second season with the team, Brown went 24-of-26 in field goals and converted all 44 of his extra points. On December 6, 2015, he missed the game-winning field goal against the New York Jets in overtime. In 2015, Brown was 27-of-29 in field goals and 41-of-42 in extra points. Brown was selected to the 2016 Pro Bowl in his 13th NFL season after Stephen Gostkowski declined to participate.\nAfter the 2015 season, Brown became a free agent. On April 18, 2016, it was announced that he re-signed with the Giants. Brown reportedly received a two-year, $4 million deal. On August 17, 2016, he was suspended one game by the NFL for violating the league's conduct policy. He released a statement saying \"while I do not agree with the suspension, I will accept it. I have exhausted the appeals process and have no other options along those lines.\" The next day, he confirmed that the suspension stemmed from a domestic violence charge in 2015.\nOn October 20, 2016, the King County, Washington Sheriff's Office released documents related to a domestic violence case against Brown. In those documents, he admitted to verbally and physically abusing his then-wife, Molly. Giants co-owner John Mara told WFAN in New York City that he re-signed Brown even after he admitted to abusing her in the past. In the face of a firestorm of criticism, the Giants deactivated Brown for their Week 7 game against the Los Angeles Rams in London, and planned to revisit his status after the game.\nThe next day, in the face of further criticism, the NFL placed Brown on the commissioner's exempt list while it reviewed the documents, saying that they appeared to reference \"other instances of abuse\" separate from the one for which he was disciplined. Brown had the right to appeal this decision, but ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that he would not do so.\nThe NFL claimed that it made multiple attempts to obtain documents related to the case, only to be rebuffed by the sheriff's office. In response, King County Sheriff John Urquhart told KIRO-AM in Seattle that he'd received a letter from an investigator asking for details on the case, but he never disclosed that he was working for the NFL. For that reason, he dismissed the letter as coming from a \"yokel.\" He also claimed that any requests for information on the case would have gone directly to him had the league followed the normal channels, and \"we probably would have told them orally a little bit more about what we had\" at the time. The NFL, Urquhart said, behaved like a \"bully\" when it asked for the information in the manner that it did.\nOn October 25, 2016, the Giants released Brown. In a statement, the Giants apologized for their previous \"misguided\" approach to the situation. This move had been expected since the NFL placed him on the exempt list. That day, several sources close to the situation told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that Brown would never play for the Giants again, and that they planned to cut ties with him at the earliest opportunity.\nOn September 8, 2017, while a free agent, Brown was suspended an additional six games after the NFL continued conducting a previous investigation regarding his previous domestic violence case. Though the suspension was completed without Brown being on a team, it was believed to be the end of his career as teams were unlikely to take on the negative attention that would come with signing him.\nPersonal life.\nLegal problems.\nBrown was arrested on a fourth-degree domestic violence charge on May 22, 2015, in Woodinville, Washington. According to the police report, the victim alleged that Brown grabbed her wrist while she was picking up a phone. The victim dialed 911 and alleged an assault. The police report states the victim's wrist had \"redness\" \"and a small cut, possibly from a fingernail.\" On May 27, 2015, five days after the arrest, the charges were dropped by a prosecutor, according to a Washington state district court. Including the May 22 incident, at least eight physical assaults were reported to the police and twenty more were detailed with the King County Sheriff's Office.\nAccording to documents released by King County Sheriff's Office related to his 2015 domestic charge, Brown admitted to abusing his ex-wife. These documents were first obtained by NJ Advance Media. Some of the documents contained therapy journal entries that Brown wrote; one of the entries included Brown saying, \"I have abused my wife.\" In an email, Brown wrote, \"I objectified women and never really worried about the pain and hurt I caused them.\" The documents also contained a \"Contract for Change\" signed by Brown, his ex-wife, and counselor Jerry Price; this contract states that Brown had physically, verbally, and emotionally abused his ex-wife. Brown also admitted in the documents that he was molested as a young boy."

He was originally a seventh-round pick (226th overall) in the 2003 NFL Draft out of the University of Illinois by the Panthers.\nBorn in Chicago Heights, Illinois, USA, Young attended Rich East High School in Park Forest, Illinois, where he earned all-state honors as a quarterback.\nOriginally a quarterback, Young switched to wide receiver as a redshirt sophomore at the University of Illinois in 2000. Starting seven games that year, Young finished the season with 27 receptions for 403 yards. As a junior, Young started 11 games and finished second on the team with 50 catches for 890 yards and eight touchdowns, while averaging a team-leading 17.8 yards per catch. In his senior year of 2002, Young started 12 games and again ranked second on the team with 56 catches for 822 yards and six touchdowns. Young finished his college career ranking third on the Illini all-time list with 2,382 receiving yards and 15 touchdown receptions, and fifth with 147 receptions.\nAs a college player at Illinois, Young also played on the Fighting Illini basketball team. As a junior (2001–02), Young played in two games for the basketball team, managing to score two points in a game against Wisconsin. Young became the first Fighting Illini athlete since 1973 to appear in games for both the football and basketball teams in the same season.\nYoung was chosen in the seventh round of the 2003 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers and played seven games as a rookie. In 2006, Young played for the Frankfurt Galaxy of NFL Europe. Young finished the regular season as the team's second-leading receiver, with 31 receptions for 370 yards and 3 touchdowns in 10 games.\nIn the 2006 NFL season, Young played in two games with the Steelers and recorded his first—and only—career NFL catch (17 yards from Ben Roethlisberger).

        "title": "Super Bowl commercials",
        "text": "Super Bowl commercials, colloquially known as Super Bowl ads, are high-profile television commercials featured in the U.S. television broadcast of the Super Bowl, the championship game of the National Football League (NFL). Super Bowl commercials have become a cultural phenomenon of their own alongside the game itself, as many viewers only watch the game to see the commercials. Many Super Bowl advertisements have become well known because of their cinematographic quality, unpredictability, surreal humor, and use of special effects. The use of celebrity cameos has also been common in Super Bowl ads. Some commercials airing during, or proposed to air during the game, have also attracted controversy due to the nature of their content.\nThe phenomenon of Super Bowl commercials is a result of the game's extremely high viewership and wide demographic reach. Super Bowl games have frequently been among the United States' most-watched television broadcasts, with Nielsen having estimated that Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 had an average viewership of 114.4 million viewers in the United States, surpassing the previous year's Super Bowl as the most-watched television broadcast in U.S. history. As such, advertisers have typically used commercials during the Super Bowl as a means of building awareness for their products and services among this wide audience, while also trying to generate buzz around the ads themselves so they may receive additional exposure, such as becoming a viral video. National surveys (such as the \"USA Today\" Super Bowl Ad Meter) judge which advertisement carried the best viewer response, and CBS has aired annual specials chronicling notable commercials from the game. Several major brands, including Budweiser, Coca-Cola, Doritos, GoDaddy, Master Lock, and Tide have been well known for making repeated appearances during the Super Bowl.\nThe prominence of airing a commercial during the Super Bowl has carried an increasingly high price. The average cost of a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl increased from $37,500 at Super Bowl I to around $2.2 million at Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000. By Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, the cost had doubled to around $4.5 million, and by Super Bowl LVI in 2022, the cost had reached up to $7 million for a 30-second slot.\nSuper Bowl commercials are largely limited to the United States' broadcast of the game. Complaints about the inability to view the ads are prevalent in Canada, where federal \"simsub\" regulations require pay television providers to replace feeds of programs from U.S. broadcast stations with domestic feeds if they are being broadcast at the same time as a Canadian broadcast station. In 2016, the CRTC, Canada's telecom regulator, enacted a policy from 2017 to 2019 to forbid the use of simsub during the Super Bowl, citing viewer complaints and a belief that these ads were an \"integral part\" of the game; Super Bowl LI was the first game to fall under this policy. The NFL's Canadian rightsholder Bell Media challenged the policy at the federal appeals court, arguing that it violated the Broadcasting Act by singling out a specific program for regulation and devalued its broadcast rights to the game. While the appeals court sided with the CRTC, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned the ruling in December 2019 as a violation of the Broadcasting Act.\nBenefits.\nSuper Bowl games have frequently been among the United States' most-watched television broadcasts. In 2015, Super Bowl XLIX set an all-time record for viewership at the game, with an average of 114.4 million viewers according to Nielsen, exceeding a record set the previous year at Super Bowl XLVIII (112.2 million). Of the top twenty television broadcasts in the United States by viewership, only one program—the 1983 series finale of \"M*A*S*H\"—was not a Super Bowl, ranking in between XLIV (106.6 million) and Super Bowl XLIII (98.7 million) with 106 million viewers. The game broadcast not only attracts a wide audience, but a diverse audience spanning many demographics and age groups. For example, women have accounted for at least 40% of Super Bowl viewers. As a result, airing a commercial during the Super Bowl can be valuable for advertisers seeking an audience for their products and services.\nBecause of the overall buzz surrounding them, commercials aired during the Super Bowl receive additional airplay and exposure outside of the game as well, such as during newscasts and morning shows. Since 2000, CBS has aired an annual television special prior to the game, \"Super Bowl’s Greatest Commercials\", which showcases notable Super Bowl ads from prior games. In recent years, the network has allowed viewers to vote for their favorite Super Bowl ads to be featured during the special.\nMany viewers watch the Super Bowl primarily for the commercials. In 2010, Nielsen reported that 51% of Super Bowl viewers enjoy the commercials more than the game itself. A 2022 study by tech startup Advocado found that 42% of those surveyed tune in for the advertisements rather than the game and that 50% of those surveyed had made a purchase based on a Super Bowl ad. In 2015, Dish Network allowed the \"Primetime Anytime\" and \"AutoHop\" features on its Hopper digital video recorder, which automatically records primetime programs from the major networks and trims commercials from the recordings, to function in reverse and allow users to view a recording of the Super Bowl that skipped over the game itself and only included the commercials.\nThe popularity of video sharing websites such as YouTube has also allowed Super Bowl advertisements to become viral videos. To take advantage of this, a growing number of advertisers have elected to post previews of their commercial, or even the full-length commercial itself, online prior to the game. A notable example of this strategy occurred prior to Super Bowl XLV: on February 2, 2011, four days before the game, Volkswagen posted the full version of its \"Star Wars\"-themed ad \"The Force\" on YouTube. By Sunday, the ad had already received over 16 million views and went on to be the most shared Super Bowl advertisement ever. Ironically, until Super Bowl 50, official online streams of the Super Bowl provided by U.S. broadcasters did not include all of the commercials from the television broadcast; at Super Bowl XLIX, only 18 advertisers bought ad time within NBC's stream of the game (although NBC did post all of the ads on a Tumblr blog throughout the game). For Super Bowl 50, CBS mandated that each advertiser's purchase cover both the television and digital broadcasts, meaning that for the first time, the online stream of the game included all national commercials from the television broadcast.\nCost.\nOwing to the large potential audience, the network broadcasting the Super Bowl can also charge a premium on advertising time during the game. A thirty-second commercial at Super Bowl I in 1967 cost $37,500. By contrast, Super Bowl XLVI set what was then a record for the price of a Super Bowl advertisement, selling 58 spots (including those longer than 30 seconds) during the game, generating $75 million for NBC; the most expensive advertisement sold for $5.84 million. Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII both set the average cost of a 30-second commercial at $4 million. Super Bowl XLIX, also broadcast by NBC, surpassed that record with a base price of $4.5 million.\nMedia executives projected that the cost of a 30-second commercial could exceed $5 million at Super Bowl 50, a figure that CBS confirmed. That price would serve as a plateau for all three Super Bowls held since then; Fox would match that figure for Super Bowl LI, NBC would slightly exceed for Super Bowl LII with a $5.2 million price tag, and CBS would slightly increase that to $5.25 million for Super Bowl LIII. Super Bowl LI would also, for the first time in the game's history, feature overtime play; four ads were broadcast between the end of regulation and the start of play, including two ads seen earlier in the game, and two ads that were sold for and also seen during the post-game show. While Fox had negotiated ad sales for overtime in the event it was to occur, it is unknown whether the network charged a premium on top of the base cost. In comparison, \"Sunday Night Football\", the flagship primetime game during the regular season, had an average cost of around $700,000 for 30 seconds of time in 2017.\nThe average cost of a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl increased by 87% between 2008 and 2016, before stabilizing since then. Slightly fewer spots were sold for Super Bowl LIII than the previous game, leading to a noted increase in the number of ads aired for network programming (from CBS and CBS All Access in this case) in comparison. Fox was reported to have charged around $5 to $5.6 million for 30 seconds of commercial time at Super Bowl LIV. CBS kept the price steady at around $5.5 million for Super Bowl LV in 2021.\nAs the 2018 Winter Olympics marked the first time since 1992 that the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl were shown by the same network in a single year, NBC offered advertisers the opportunity to purchase packages of time for their ads covering both Super Bowl LII and the Olympics. NBC stated that doing so would allow advertisers to amortize their expenses through additional airplay during the Olympics. To prevent the 2022 Winter Olympics from cannibalizing advertising revenue and viewership for Super Bowl LVI, CBS agreed to exchange the game to NBC for Super Bowl LV in 2021. NBC subsequently charged between $6.5 and 7 million for a 30-second commercial, with Fox and CBS holding steady for 2023 and 2024 respectively.\nThe high cost of purchasing advertising time, on top of the cost of producing the commercial itself, has led to concerns by marketers that the increased sales that can result from a Super Bowl commercial do not recoup the cost of buying the ad time. In the early 2010s, advertisers such as Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, General Motors, and Pepsi chose to skip the Super Bowl due to the high costs of advertising—although Pepsi would return in 2013, followed by GM in 2014. As a lower-cost alternative, some advertisers have elected to purchase advertising time during the games' extended pre-game shows (which, during Super Bowl XLVIII, ranged from $100,000 to $2 million), or from individual network affiliates that are broadcasting it.\nWith the introduction of simulcasting across multiple networks for Super Bowl LVIII, CBS simulcast most of the game's commercials on its Nickelodeon children's simulcast of the game. As some of the advertisers involved adult-only products such as beer and gambling, Nickelodeon sold separate advertisements as replacements, each selling for up to $300,000 per advertisement, compared to $7,000,000 per advertisement for the main broadcast.\nSuper Bowl commercials.\nMany Super Bowl advertisements have become iconic and well known because of their quality, unpredictability, humor, and use of special effects. In recent years, advertisers have also attempted to stand out from others by producing ads with cinematographic qualities, and ads that channel emotions and real-world issues. The use of celebrity cameos has also been common in Super Bowl ads, ranging from then-unknown personalities to unexpected combinations of celebrities, such as a 2007 CBS network promo for \"Late Show\" that featured David Letterman and Oprah Winfrey—whom Letterman had conflicts with following a joke directed at her during the 67th Academy Awards, and a 2010 sequel that also included Jay Leno (who was slated to return to its competitor, \"The Tonight Show\", following a publicized conflict between NBC and Conan O'Brien).\nSeveral brands, including Budweiser, Coca-Cola, and Master Lock, have been well known for their frequent appearances as advertisers during the Super Bowl.\nEarly advertising.\nSeveral notable commercials aired during Super Bowl games during the 1970s. In a commercial during Super Bowl IV in 1970, Chicago Bears linebacker Dick Butkus endorsed Prestone, a brand of antifreeze, stating the tagline, \"Because plugging holes is my business.\" The ad marked the first highly successful celebrity endorsement in Super Bowl advertising. In 1973, lotion brand Noxzema aired a commercial starring Farrah Fawcett and quarterback Joe Namath, featuring Namath being literally \"creamed\" by Fawcett. Later in the decade, Fawcett would become better known for her role on the television series \"Charlie's Angels\".\nAt Super Bowl XI in 1977, Xerox aired an advertisement entitled \"Monks\"; starring Jack Eagle as Brother Dominic—a monk discovering that he could create copies of a manuscript using a new Xerox photocopier. Y&amp;R New York's CEO Leslie Sims described \"Monks\" as being the \"first viral ad,\" explaining that it \"was the first commercial that got people to request to see it again on TV.\" To mark its 40th anniversary, a remake of the \"Monks\" ad premiered in January 2017 (although not as a Super Bowl ad), which updated its premise to feature the company's modern product line.\nMaster Lock: \"Tough Under Fire\".\nAmong the most prominent of campaigns during early Super Bowl games were those of Master Lock. In 1965, the company had first run a television commercial demonstrating the strength of its padlocks, by having a person shoot it with a handgun in a failed attempt to breach it. The campaign was pulled after the company's advertising director, Edson F. Allen realized the stunt could be imitated by those who were unsure of the commercial's authenticity. By the 1970s, Allen discussed the possibility of reviving the concept but using a rifle rather than a handgun to make it harder to imitate. The resulting commercial would premiere in 1974 during Super Bowl VIII; despite concerns by the staff of Master Lock and their agency, Campbell Mithun, over the content of the ad, the commercial was well received by the general public.\nWhen Cramer-Krasselt took over as Master Lock's agency later in the year, the company decided to make the gun ads a tradition and began to produce new ads themed around the concept (including one featuring skeptics of previous editions of the ad, and one showcasing the company's major corporate clients) for future Super Bowls during the subsequent decades (aside from a brief hiatus in 1986 and 1987), and the early 1990s. Allen went as far as describing the ads as an \"event\" that continued to attract media attention after the game. The Super Bowl ads helped improve Master Lock's market share; from 1973 through 1994, sales had increased from $35 million per year to $200 million per year. Master Lock's yearly Super Bowl commercials accounted for nearly all of the company's annual advertising budget.\nCoca-Cola.\nAt Super Bowl XIV in 1980, Coca-Cola aired an advertisement popularly known as \"Hey Kid, Catch!\", featuring Pittsburgh Steelers All-Pro defensive lineman \"Mean Joe\" Greene being offered a Coca-Cola by a young fan—played by Tommy Okon, drinking it in one sip, and tossing the kid his game-worn jersey as repayment. The advertisement was filmed in 1979 and premiered that October, but did not gain mainstream attention until its airing during Super Bowl XIV. \"Hey Kid, Catch!\" became one of Greene's most famous roles; the ad would win a Clio Award, spawn a made-for-TV movie on NBC entitled \"The Steeler and the Pittsburgh Kid\", and be re-made for other markets with local athletes. In a 2011 poll by \"Advertising Age\", readers named \"Hey Kid, Catch!\" as the best Super Bowl commercial of all time.\nThe ad also became the subject of parodies on television series, such as \"The Simpsons\", and in other ads. At Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, Coca-Cola aired a parody of the ad for its Coca-Cola Zero brand starring Steelers safety Troy Polamalu. Continuing an ongoing theme in the promotion of Coke Zero, the ad was interrupted by a Coca-Cola \"brand manager\" accusing Polamalu of \"stealing\" their commercial; in response, Polamalu tackled him and ripped off his shirt to give to the child. In 2012, Procter &amp; Gamble aired a parody of the ad entitled \"Stinky.\" The ad saw Greene reprise his role, but having the young fan throw Downy Unstoppables fabric softener to Greene instead of Coca-Cola, and the fan rejecting his jersey because it smelled. In 2016, Joe Greene was reunited with Okon as part of a segment for CBS's \"Super Bowl's Greatest Commercials\" special.\nCoca-Cola has also used the Super Bowl for other campaigns: in 2009, the company aired new ads as part of its recently introduced Open Happiness campaign. In 2014, the company aired the multiculturalism-themed ad \"It's Beautiful\", which featured scenes of Americans of various races and ethnicities, including the first-ever same-sex couple featured in a Super Bowl commercial. However, the ad attracted due to its use of a multilingual rendition of \"America the Beautiful\" as its soundtrack. In 2015, the company aired an ad entitled \"#makeithappy\"; themed around cyberbullying, the ad featured negative comments directed towards a teen being transformed into positive messages after a technician accidentally spills a bottle of Coca-Cola on a server.\nIn 2021, amid the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Coca-Cola announced that it would skip advertising at Super Bowl LV \"to ensure we are investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times.\"\nMacintosh: \"1984\".\nAt Super Bowl XVIII, Apple Computer broadcast an advertisement for its Macintosh computer entitled \"1984\", created by the agency Chiat/Day and directed by Ridley Scott. The advertisement, which incorporated elements inspired by the novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", featured a woman wearing track-and-field clothing (including orange pants and a white shirt branded with an image of the Macintosh) sprinting into a large auditorium and hurling a large hammer into a screen (displaying a large Big Brother-like figure speaking to a massive assembly of drone-like people in the audience), concluding with the message \"On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won’t be like '1984.'\" The advertisement received critical acclaim from both viewers and critics alike for helping position the Macintosh as a unique entry into the personal computer market and is often considered to be one of the best Super Bowl advertisements of all time.\nThe ad first aired nationally during Super Bowl XVIII. As the agency wanted \"1984\" to be eligible for that year's industry awards, which were only open to ads that aired during 1983, a low-profile premiere of the ad occurred on the Twin Falls, Idaho station KMVT on December 31, 1983, shortly before midnight. Apple attempted to follow up \"1984\" the following year with a new ad entitled \"Lemmings\", to promote its Macintosh Office system. The ad, which featured blindfolded businessmen walking over the edge of a cliff in unison, was criticized for its \"dark\" theme and exaggerated premise. \"Lemmings\" has been considered to be one of Apple's worst television advertisements.\nBudweiser.\nThe beer brand Budweiser has long been a Super Bowl fixture. Its parent company Anheuser-Busch held a long-term contract with the NFL that allowed it to buy several slots of air time from the game's broadcaster each year at a steep discount, a contract that ran through Super Bowl 50; the company continues to buy multiple commercials in each game. Budweiser runs several advertising campaigns throughout each game, one of which has traditionally featured its mascots, the Budweiser Clydesdales. The Clydesdales were included in at least one Super Bowl commercial every year from Super Bowl IX in 1975 through Super Bowl LI in 2017. Budweiser's parent company Anheuser-Busch has been the most successful advertiser in the annual Super Bowl Ad Meter survey organized by \"USA Today\", having finished first on the survey fourteen times. When \"USA Today\" held an \"All-Time Ad Meter\" bracket tournament in 2014, two Budweiser commercials met in the finals; the winner was a 2008 ad spoofing \"Rocky\", which went against its 1999 ad \"Separated at Birth\", which featured a pair of Dalmatian puppies given to two separate owners, but eventually seeing each other again after one became a mascot dog on the Clydesdales' carriage.\nAs of 2015, Budweiser had won the survey thirteen times in fifteen years; its 2013 advertisement entitled \"Brotherhood\" focused on the relationship and emotional reunion of a Clydesdale with its original trainer three years after leaving to become a Budweiser Clydesdale. Prior to the game, Budweiser also invited users to vote via Twitter on a name for the new foal that would be featured in the ad. A 2014 ad entitled \"Puppy Love\" featured a similar reunion between an adopted dog and another Budweiser Clydesdale. Its most recent victory and its third in a row, 2015's \"Lost Dog\", featured a dog being rescued from a wolf by the Clydesdales.\nIn 2017, Budweiser broadcast \"Born the Hard Way\", an ad that dramatized Anheuser-Busch co-founder Adolphus Busch's emigration to the United States from Germany to establish the company. The advertisement attracted criticism and a boycott among supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, due to its pro-immigration themes (especially in the wake of an executive order which briefly restricted entry into the U.S. by residents of several countries with predominantly Muslim populations). Anheuser-Busch denied that the ad was meant to be a political message, as it had been in production for the past year, and that it was meant to \"highlight the ambition of our founder, Adolphus Busch, and his unrelenting pursuit of the American dream.\" Barring a brief appearance, the Clydesdales were not prominently featured during the ad. However, Budweiser's social media outlets promoted \"ClydesdaleCam\", a Facebook live stream of the Clydesdales watching the game in a stable and waiting to see their cameo.\nIn 2018, Budweiser broadcast \"Stand by You\", an ad that chronicled Anheuser-Busch's disaster relief program of distributing cans of drinking water from its brewery in Cartersville, Georgia. The Clydesdales were, once again, downplayed from its television spots, with the brewery only airing a 5-second bumper in the second quarter to promote its streaming ClydesdaleCam event. However, the Clydesdales were featured in several digital-oriented companion campaigns alongside the game, including ClydesdaleCam, a second, web-exclusive ad entitled \"Beer Country\", as well as themed Snapchat filters. The Clydesdales returned for Budweiser's 2019 ad, \"Wind Never Felt Better\", which promoted Anheuser-Busch's commitment to using clean energy, including wind power, as part of the production of its products.\nBudweiser has introduced other campaigns during the Super Bowl as well. During Super Bowl XXIII, Budweiser aired an episodic series of commercials known as the \"Bud Bowl\"—which featured a football game between stop motion-animated beer bottles representing Budweiser and Bud Light, with commentary by Bob Costas and Paul Maguire. Proving popular, the \"Bud Bowl\" would return at subsequent Super Bowls; it had become so popular that some viewers actually wagered on the outcome of the \"Bud Bowl\" as if it were an actual event. In 1995, Budweiser introduced the first of a series of ads featuring a group of three frogs named Bud, Weis, and Er, which only croaked their respective names. The Budweiser Frogs became one of the brand's most popular campaigns and were expanded upon at Super Bowl XXXII with a series of ads focusing on two wise-cracking lizards—Louie and Frankie—who found the frogs annoying and had hired a ferret hitman to try and kill them.\nAnheuser-Busch has aired commercials for other beer brands during the game alongside Budweiser and Bud Light, such as Beck's Sapphire and Stella Artois. At Super Bowl LI, the company re-launched Busch, and broadcast a Bud Light ad featuring the ghost of its former dog mascot Spuds MacKenzie. Michelob Ultra debuted for Super Bowl LI, with an ad starring actor Chris Pratt. Bud Light extended its medieval-themed advertising campaign (colloquially known as \"Dilly Dilly\") to the Super Bowl in 2018, with the game featuring the debut of \"The Bud Knight\"—the third installment of a \"trilogy\" of ads that led into the game (with the second, \"Ye Olde Pep Talk\", having premiered during the conference championship games but also re-aired during the Super Bowl).\nAnheuser-Busch made its largest-ever advertising purchase for Super Bowl LIII, with eight ads (one 60-second spot, four 45-second spots, and the remaining being 30-second spots) covering seven products in five brands—including Budweiser, Bud Light, Bon &amp; Viv Spiked Seltzer, Michelob Ultra, and Stella Artois. Bud Light's medieval campaign continued into Super Bowl LIII, with an ad attacking its competitors for their use of high fructose corn syrup, and the latter featuring a crossover with the HBO series \"Game of Thrones\".\nFor Super Bowl LIV, the company only purchased four 60-second spots, with one advertising both Bud Light and Bud Light Seltzer. Amid the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, it was announced that Budweiser itself would not air an ad during Super Bowl LV in 2021 (its first absence in 37 years), choosing to donate the estimated cost of a Super Bowl ad to the Ad Council to fund awareness campaigns for COVID-19 vaccines, and launch a digital campaign that would also promote vaccination. However, Anheuser-Busch still aired spots for other brands during the game, as well as its first-ever commercial for Anheuser-Busch as a company, with a total spend roughly the same as 2020.\nChrysler.\nChrysler, and the marques of its former parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (since merged into Stellantis), have made repeated appearances during the Super Bowl. From 2011 through 2014, Chrysler became known for running several notable long-form ads; at Super Bowl XLV, Chrysler aired a two-minute-long ad entitled \"Born of Fire\" to launch the Chrysler 200 and the company's new slogan \"Imported from Detroit.\" The ad featured scenes depicting the history and revitalization of Detroit, as well as local rapper Eminem and his song \"Lose Yourself.\" The ad was critically acclaimed and won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for \"Best Commercial\" in 2011.\nDuring Super Bowl XLVI, Chrysler broadcast \"Halftime in America\", a two-minute-long commercial directed by David Gordon Green, written by poet Matthew Dickman and narrated by actor Clint Eastwood. The commercial recounted the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10, set to scenes showing Americans in despair, but then in hope. The narration of the ad likened the emergence from the crisis to the second half of a football game, explaining that \"All that matters now is what’s ahead: how do we come from behind? How do we come together? And how do we win? Detroit’s showing us it can be done. And what’s true about them is true about all of us. This country can’t be knocked out with one punch. We get right back up again, and when we do the world’s gonna hear the roar of our engines.\" The ad was heavily viewed online after the game, receiving over 4 million views on YouTube within 36 hours, but also attracted due to its political overtones.\nSuper Bowl XLVII featured an ad for Ram Trucks, which adapted Paul Harvey's 1978 speech \"So God Made a Farmer.\" During Super Bowl 50, the company focused exclusively on its SUV brand Jeep. At Super Bowl LI, the company similarly focused exclusively on Alfa Romeo, as part of a campaign to re-launch the Fiat-owned brand in the United States. Super Bowl LII featured two Ram Trucks commercials, the latter featuring an extract from a 1968 speech by Martin Luther King Jr., as well as three Jeep ads.\nThe Jeep Gladiator was the focus of a spot during Super Bowl LIV, starring actor Bill Murray reprising his role from the film \"Groundhog Day\" (appropriately, given the scheduling of that year's game). The ad would net Jeep's first-ever victory on the Super Bowl Ad Meter survey.\nThe Dot-com Super Bowl.\nSuper Bowl XXXIV (2000) became notable for featuring a large number of commercials from dot-com companies, to the extent that critics dubbed it the \"Dot-com Super Bowl\" as a result. With a 30-second ad costing around $2.2 million, 20% of the commercial time sold went to dot-com companies—constituting $44 million of the $130 million spent in total on Super Bowl advertising time that year.\nNotable dot-com ads broadcast during the game included \"If You Leave Me Now\"–an ad for Pets.com which introduced the website's sock puppet mascot, a self-proclaimed \"worst commercial on the Super Bowl\" by LifeMinder.com (which consisted only of text captions on a yellow background with \"Chopsticks\" playing in the background), and \"Monkey\"—a deliberately nonsensical E-Trade ad that featured a monkey dancing to \"La Cucaracha\", and the tagline \"Well, we just wasted $2,000,000. What are you doing with your money?\" Electronic Data Systems aired an ad themed around cowboys who herded cats instead of cows.\nDespite their aspirations and the boosts in traffic they received from the ads, all of the publicly held companies which advertised saw their stocks slump after the game as the dot-com bubble began to rapidly deflate. Some of the companies that advertised during the game—including Epidemic Marketing and Pets.com, had become defunct by the end of the year, and at Super Bowl XXXV, only three dot-com companies—E-Trade, HotJobs, and Monster.com—advertised during the game.\nDoritos.\nIn 2006, Doritos began holding a promotion known as \"Crash the Super Bowl\", soliciting viewers to film their own Doritos commercials to possibly be aired during the game. At Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, an additional bonus prize of $1 million was added if any of the winning entries were named #1 on the Super Bowl Ad Meter survey results; Doritos would reach the #1 spot on the survey that year with an ad entitled \"Free Doritos\", created by Joe and Dave Herbert of Batesville, Indiana. The ad featured an office worker attempting to fulfill a prediction that he would receive free Doritos by smashing open a vending machine with a crystal ball.\nThe following year, additional prizes of $600,000 and $400,000 were added for reaching second and third place on the poll, plus an additional $1 million bonus for each if three of the ads were to sweep the top three. A 2010 finalist, \"UnderDog\", reached second place on the poll.\nAnother user-submitted Doritos ad, \"The Cowboy Kid\", finished in second place on the Ad Meter survey in 2014, winning $50,000. The contest itself was won by \"Time Machine\"; created by Ryan Thomas Andersen of Arizona and produced on a budget of only $300, the ad featured his son scamming his neighbor into giving him his bag of Doritos by claiming that he had built a time machine that was fueled by them. For winning the contest, Anderson received $1 million and an opportunity to work on set during the production of the film \"\".\nGoDaddy.\nThe domain registrar and web hosting company GoDaddy was well known for producing Super Bowl commercials featuring female spokespersons it dubbed \"GoDaddy Girls\", such as professional driver Danica Patrick, and for its 2011 ad, comedian Joan Rivers. Many of the company's planned Super Bowl ads were allegedly rejected by broadcasters due to their risqué subject matter, leading to GoDaddy instead airing a \"teaser\" ad during the game that instructed viewers to watch the uncensored version of the ad on their website.\nThe company's first appearance at Super Bowl XXXIX parodied the \"wardrobe malfunction\" that had occurred at the previous year's halftime show, featuring a woman testifying to Congress about why GoDaddy wanted to advertise during the game, but a strap of her tank top coming undone. The ad was scheduled to air twice, but its second airing was pulled in response to concerns by Fox and the NFL over its content. The following year at Super Bowl XL, thirteen ad concepts were rejected by ABC due to their content. In 2008, a GoDaddy ad entitled \"Exposure\" was rejected by Fox for using the word \"beaver\" as a double entendre. In turn, the ad was replaced with one advertising the availability of the ad on GoDaddy's website, attracting two million visits. In October 2013, GoDaddy's chief marketing officer Barb Rechterman announced that the company would no longer air provocative ads during the Super Bowl, explaining that \"our new brand of Super Bowl commercials will make it crystal clear what we do and who we stand for. We may be changing our approach, but as we've always said, we don't care what the critics think. We are all about our customers.\"\nGoDaddy's ad in 2015, \"Journey Home\", was controversial for different reasons: it featured a puppy traveling back to its owner after falling out of a pickup truck, only to learn that he had been sold to a new owner using a website built with GoDaddy. The ad was criticized by animal rights groups, who felt that it implied an endorsement of commercial puppy mills. GoDaddy quickly pulled the ad in response to the controversy; GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving explained that the ad's humor had \"clearly missed the mark.\" PETA partially praised the ad for portraying the seller as being a \"callous jerk,\" but explained that \"The sale of animals online and from pet stores and breeders should be roundly condemned, and it was today. GoDaddy did the right thing by swiftly promoting adoption.\"\nTide.\nProcter &amp; Gamble has used the Super Bowl to promote its Tide detergent. Several Tide ads for the Super Bowl have been viewer favorites and award winners, including the \"Talking Stain\" featured a yammering blotch ruining a job interview for Super Bowl XLII, and the \"Miracle Stain\" that summoned acolytes to worship a blemish appearing like Joe Montana for Super Bowl XLVII.\nTide aired an episodic three-part ad during Super Bowl LI that starred \"Fox NFL Sunday\" co-host Terry Bradshaw, where he discovers a stain on his suit right before going on air from Fox's set at NRG Stadium, prompting him to—as seen in a second commercial later in the game—quickly travel to Jeffrey Tambor's house so he could clean it with Tide. In the conclusion (aired near the end of the game), Bradshaw makes it back to the game, only for his colleague Curt Menefee to spill coffee on his shirt, with Tambor (who is watching from home) refusing to help again. To make the sequence plausibly live, it was filmed over the weeks immediately before the Super Bowl, and required P&amp;G's agency to construct a replica of Fox's actual on-field set for the game. Visual effects were used to correctly reflect the look of the stadium and the teams participating in the game.\nDuring Super Bowl LII, Tide aired a series of commercials starring David Harbour, which presented several types of commercials that viewers often see during the Super Bowl, only to reveal that they are all actually commercials for Tide because all of their clothes are perfectly clean. Some of the commercials included crossovers with ads for other Procter &amp; Gamble products, including a Mr. Clean ad aired during Super Bowl LI, and Old Spice's \"The Man Your Man Could Smell Like\" ad.\n\"Small Business Big Game\".\nAs a byproduct of the increased cost of ad time at the Super Bowl, financial software company Intuit made its debut at Super Bowl XLVIII by hosting a promotion known as \"Small Business Big Game\", in which small businesses with \"inspiring\" stories competed for a chance to earn a commercial during the Super Bowl funded by Intuit, as decided by user votes. Company CEO Brad D. Smith explained that the promotion was an extension of the company's goals to improve financial lives \"in a way that you'd never imagine going back,\" while Ken Wach, senior vice president of marketing for Intuit's Small Business Group, explained that \"normally you're looking at Budweiser ads or Chevy ads, so this was about putting small businesses on the national stage and shining the spotlight on them as heroes of the economy.\"\nThe winner of the 2014 edition was GoldieBlox, a toy company with a focus on promoting mechanical engineering to young girls. While the campaign was a success for the winner, resulting in increased prominence and sales, Wach felt that Intuit was not able to \"sustain the momentum as much as we would have liked.\" At Super Bowl XLIX, Intuit did not hold the promotion, but still aired an ad for its own TurboTax product. The contest returned in 2015 for Super Bowl 50 and was won by Death Wish Coffee.\n\"I'm going to Disney World!\".\nDisney Parks is known for an advertising campaign associated with the Super Bowl entitled \"What's Next?\", but more popularly known as \"I'm going to Disney World!\" The ads feature a player from the winning team (typically the MVP) responding with the eponymous declaration after being asked what they would do after the game. These ads typically premiere on the day after the Super Bowl. The series began following Super Bowl XXI, and first featured Phil Simms of the New York Giants. Disney has reportedly offered players $30,000 if they participate in the commercial and visit a Disney theme park (usually Disney World or Disneyland) afterward, and has extended the campaign to champion players in other sports. At Super Bowl XL (broadcast by corporate sister ABC), Disney aired an in-game commercial themed around the campaign, featuring Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Seahawks players rehearsing the line in case they won.\nCryptocurrency.\nSuper Bowl LVI (2022) featured a number of cryptocurrency exchanges making their debut as advertisers, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, eToro, and FTX on the American telecast, and BitPay on the Canadian telecast. Comparisons were made to the wave of dot-com ads at Super Bowl XXXIV, with the game being dubbed the \"Crypto Bowl\" by some media outlets. \nFTX's ad featured comedian and actor Larry David (in his first appearance in a commercial) in period costume dismissing various technological and societal achievements in history, including the wheel, American independence, Edison's incandescent light bulb, the Walkman, and finally, cryptocurrency. The ad was directed by Jeff Schaffer, whom David had worked with in the past on \"Seinfeld\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\" Ironically, the company would go bankrupt later that year.\nIn contrast, Coinbase aired an unusual 60-second ad consisting only of a QR code bouncing across a black, screensaver-like screen. When scanned, the code redirected users to a web page advertising a promotion and giveaway for new customers. Coinbase's website promptly crashed, having received 20 million hits within a minute. The ad was quickly parodied later in the night by Meta Quest, which posted a similar ad on social media to advertise a streaming Foo Fighters VR concert after the game, captioned \"Hopefully this doesn't break.\" \nBesides ads from crypto exchanges, several other ads made allusions to cryptocurrency and related concepts such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those of TurboTax and Bud Light Next respectively.\nLocal advertising during the Super Bowl.\nTo dodge the high costs of obtaining national ad time, or to broadcast more regionalized campaigns, some advertisers elect to purchase local advertising time from the individual network affiliates airing the Super Bowl, such as the Church of Scientology—who bought local ad time in major urban markets such as New York City in 2014, and the Bank of Montreal to promote its BMO Harris Bank branches. In 2024, the Scientology ad was listed 9th in the top 10 most watched Super Bowl 2024 ads by Variety, just above the Skechers commercial. In 2012, Old Milwaukee broadcast a Super Bowl ad starring Will Ferrell; as an extension of the beer's regional campaign with the actor, the ad only aired in the city of North Platte, Nebraska.\nSeveral notable local ads were broadcast during Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014. The Utah Department of Transportation used the game to broadcast a public service announcement on seat belt usage for its \"Zero Fatalities\" campaign, which featured a depiction of a child who had died in a rollover crash because he did not use a seat belt. In Savannah, Georgia, local personal injury lawyer Jamie Casino broadcast a two-minute-long advertisement on WTGS, which featured a thriller-styled retelling of how he stopped representing \"cold-hearted villains\" to avenge the 2012 Labor Day shooting death of his brother Michael Biancosino, and Emily Pickels, after a subsequent statement by former police chief Willie Lovett who claimed that there were \"no innocent victims,\" culminating with Casino digging through a grave with a sledgehammer. The commercial went viral after the game, with \"The Independent\" dubbing it the \"most metal\" Super Bowl ad imaginable. Tribune Broadcasting used local time on the Fox affiliates it owned to air an extended promo for \"Salem\", a then-upcoming series on sister cable network WGN America.\nIn 2015, Newcastle Brown Ale bought time on local NBC stations to air an ad that, as a commentary on the high cost of national Super Bowl advertising time, contained plugs for 37 other products and companies it had recruited in a crowdfunding campaign. In Savannah, Georgia, Jamie Casino aired a sequel to his 2014 ad that focused on the \"bullies\" that he had encountered throughout his life.\nSt. Louis attorney Terry Crouppen aired a local ad in 2016 in which he criticized Stan Kroenke for his decision to re-locate the St. Louis Rams to Los Angeles.\nSome Canadian companies bought local advertising time from Fox affiliates carried in the country in 2017, taking advantage of a new regulatory policy that made the Super Bowl available directly from U.S. stations via local television providers for the first time.\nIn 2018, rock musician Alice Cooper appeared in a local ad for Desert Financial Credit Union, which played upon his band's song \"School's Out\" to promote its re-branding from Desert Schools Federal Credit Union. Jamie Casino also returned with a new ad. A local Subaru dealer in Muskegon, Michigan ran a simplistic ad containing only the logos of the dealership, and the message \"Congratulations Patriots!\"—a \"last minute calculated risk\" based on odds favoring the team, given that the game was actually won by the Philadelphia Eagles.\nControversial Super Bowl commercials.\nSeveral Super Bowl commercials have been considered controversial by viewers and critics, or even outright blocked by networks' Standards and Practices departments, because of concerns surrounding their contents. Political advertising and most direct forms of issue-related advertising are usually not aired during the Super Bowl because of equal-time rules or other factors, while the NFL forbids ads for gambling, hard liquor, and banned substances from airing during any of its telecasts.\nAn exception to the lack of major political advertising during the Super Bowl occurred in 2020 for Super Bowl LIV, in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election (with the Iowa caucuses occurring the Monday immediately following the game). The campaigns of President Donald Trump and Democratic Party candidate Michael Bloomberg both bought ad time during the game, paying around $10 million each. Due to concerns from other advertisers over their commercials being aired in proximity to the campaign ads, Fox reportedly agreed to insulate these two ads by only scheduling promos for network programming to air alongside them in their respective breaks.\nJust For Feet: \"Kenyan Mission\".\nAt Super Bowl XXXIII, footwear retailer Just For Feet aired its first Super Bowl ad. In the commercial, a barefoot Kenyan runner is tracked by a group of Caucasian men in a Humvee. The runner is offered drug-laced water which knocks him unconscious; when he wakes up, the runner discovers that the men have given him Nike shoes. The runner rejects the shoes and attempts to shake them off whilst running away.\nThe ad was widely criticized for its derogatory premise; Bob Garfield described the commercial as being \"neo-colonialist,\" \"culturally imperialist,\" and \"probably racist,\" while Chuck McBride, creative director of Nike's agency Wieden+Kennedy, stated that he \"couldn't believe that they had done this.\" Just For Feet had spent $7 million on the ad, including $1.7 million for the time, and the rest on production and promotional costs. Despite its concerns about its content, Just For Feet relied on the expertise of their hired agency, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, because they assured that the ad was their best work. Just For Feet CEO Harold Ruttenberg explained to \"Salon\" that \"we took out advertisements. We gave away more than $1 million of product. Then the ad runs. And you would not believe the deluge of comments made about this company. I couldn't sleep for a solid month. And it's all because of these guys who said they knew everything.\"\nJust For Feet filed a $10 million lawsuit against Saatchi &amp; Saatchi for malpractice, alleging that the agency was damaging its reputation and goodwill through its \"appallingly unacceptable and shockingly unprofessional performance,\" which ran \"contrary to the deepest held principles of Just for Feet, which has always sought to promote racial harmony, finds racism abhorrent, and condemns drug use.\" Just for Feet filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1999, and the lawsuit was dropped. It was later found that the company had been engaging in accounting fraud.\nGeneral Motors: \"Robot\".\nAt Super Bowl XLI, General Motors aired a 60-second ad entitled \"Robot\", which was meant to promote the powertrain warranty it offered for its vehicles. Themed around an \"obsession\" with quality, the ad depicted an assembly line robot being fired for dropping a screw. After attempting several alternative careers, the robot is depicted killing itself by rolling off the edge of a bridge into a river. The sequence is interrupted to reveal that the events were just a dream and that the robot had not been fired at all. Although ranking in ninth place on the Adbowl survey, \"Robot\" received criticism for its glamorization of suicide; the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) was a notable critic of the spot, as well as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and other suicide prevention groups. The AFSP stated that \"the ad, in its carelessness, portrays suicide as a viable option when someone fails or loses their job.\" Some critics also interpreted the ad's thematics as being in poor taste, as GM had laid off 35,000 factory workers in the previous year.\nA GM spokesperson defended the commercial as being \"a story of GM's commitment to quality\" and stated that this was the \"predominant impression\" by those who had previewed it. The company would remove the bridge scene from future airings.\nFocus on the Family anti-abortion ad.\nAt Super Bowl XLIV, the non-profit evangelical organization Focus on the Family aired an advertisement featuring then-Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow and his mother, Pam. Prior to becoming pregnant with Tim, and while serving as Baptist missionaries in the Philippines, Pam had contracted amoebic dysentery and fell into a coma. She discovered she was pregnant while recovering. Because of the medications used to treat her, the fetus experienced a severe placental abruption. Doctors expected a stillbirth and recommended an abortion. The Tebows decided against it, citing their strong faith. In the ad, Pam described Tim as a \"miracle baby\" who \"almost didn't make it into this world\" and remarked that \"with all our family's been through, we have to be tough,\" after which she was tackled by Tim. The ad itself made no reference to abortion or Christianity and directed viewers to the organization's website.\nThe then-unseen ad drew criticism from some women's rights groups, who asked CBS to pull the ad because they felt it would be divisive. Planned Parenthood released a video response of its own featuring fellow NFL player Sean James. The claim that Tebow's family chose not to perform an abortion was also widely criticized; as abortion is illegal in the Philippines, critics felt that it was implausible that a doctor would recommend the procedure in the first place. CBS's decision to run the ad was also criticized for deviating from its past policy of rejecting issue and advocacy-based commercials during the Super Bowl, including those by left-leaning or perceived left-leaning groups such as PETA, MoveOn.org, and the United Church of Christ (which wanted to run an ad that was pro-same-sex marriage). However, CBS stated that \"we have for some time moderated our approach to advocacy submissions after it became apparent that our stance did not reflect public sentiment or industry norms on the issue.\"\nAshley Madison and ManCrunch.\nAvid Life Media, an operator of online dating services, has had two Super Bowl ads rejected by broadcasters. In 2009, NBC rejected an ad for the extramarital dating site Ashley Madison, which featured the tagline \"Who Are You Doing After the Game?\", from appearing during Super Bowl XLIII. Avid Life Media's CEO Noel Biderman felt the rejection was \"ridiculous,\" noting an apparent double standard of allowing advertisements for alcoholic beverages to air during NFL games despite the number of deaths attributed to them. Biderman considered the NFL demographic to be a core audience of the site, and promised to \"find a way to let them know about the existence of this service.\"\nThe following year at Super Bowl XLIV, an advertisement for Ashley Madison's sister site ManCrunch—a dating website for homosexual relationships—was rejected by CBS. The ad featured two male football fans reaching into the same bowl of chips, and after a brief pause, passionately kissing and dry humping each other, much to the surprise of another man present. Company spokesperson Elissa Buchter considered the rejection to be discrimination, by contending that CBS would not have objected to the ad had it featured a kiss between a man and a woman, and acknowledging the frequent airplay of advertisements for erectile dysfunction medications on U.S. television as a double standard. Fellow spokesperson Dominic Friesen stated that the company was \"very disappointed\" with CBS's decision, noting that the network had allowed the aforementioned Focus on the Family ad to air during the game.\nAvid Life was also accused of ambush marketing by critics, who argued that the company was intentionally submitting ads that would get rejected by broadcasters and receive free publicity from the ensuing controversy, thus removing the need to actually buy ad time during the game. However, the company denied these claims and indicated that it did have serious intentions to purchase ad time during the game if its commercials were accepted. In an article posted following the 2015 security breach of Ashley Madison, a former CBS standards &amp; practices employee stated that the ManCrunch ad had actually been rejected for its use of NFL trademarks, and not because of its content.\nPETA.\nAnimal rights activist organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, known for its salacious and shocking publicity stunts, has routinely submitted Super Bowl ads that have been rejected. Most of the advertisements have been explicitly sexual in nature. In 2018, PETA submitted an advertisement referencing religion instead, with a priest (portrayed by James Cromwell) telling a meat industry executive that he could not be forgiven for the sins of what PETA claimed were deceptive advertisements, even if he confessed. NBC expressed willingness to air the 2018 advertisement on the condition that the organization would buy additional ads during the 2018 Winter Olympics, which would have doubled the price; PETA refused and accused the network of price gouging. For the 2020 advertisement, PETA claimed that Fox rejected their advertisement because of pressure from the NFL; the advertisement that year depicted animals imitating Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protests.\nRandall Terry anti-abortion ad.\nIn 2012, Randall Terry attempted to use a provision in Federal Communications Commission policies requiring \"reasonable access\" to local advertising time for political candidates within 45 days of an election or primary, to force several NBC stations to air a graphic anti-abortion attack ad during Super Bowl XLVI that featured images of blood-covered fetuses. Following a complaint by the Chicago-based NBC-owned station WMAQ, the FCC ruled that Terry could not expect reasonable access to advertising time during the Super Bowl because of the magnitude of the event and the limited amount of local advertising time available. Furthermore, it was also found that Terry did not show enough evidence that he was a \"bona fide\" candidate eligible to receive ad time in the first place.\nChrysler: \"Halftime in America\".\nChrysler's Super Bowl XLVI ad \"Halftime in America\" was controversial due to its political overtones, especially as it came during the lead-up to the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Critics interpreted the ad as being in support of re-electing Barack Obama, suggesting that the metaphor of \"halftime in America\" symbolized the performance of Obama's first four-year term as president going into his re-election campaign, and noting Obama had supported George W. Bush's bailout of Chrysler while acting as a Democratic senator. It was also noted that the commercial's narrator Clint Eastwood had made statements against the bailouts in 2011, had stated that he \"couldn’t recall ever voting for a Democratic presidential candidate,\" and that he was a supporter of Republican candidate John McCain during the 2008 campaign. Eastwood would later appear as a surprise guest at the 2012 Republican National Convention in support of nominee Mitt Romney, addressing an empty chair meant to represent Obama.\nSodaStream.\nIn 2013, SodaStream submitted a Super Bowl advertisement directed by Alex Bogusky, which featured a pair of Coca-Cola and Pepsi deliverymen finding their bottles exploding and disappearing when another person uses the SodaStream to make their own beverages; representing a disruption of the soft drink market. The ad was rejected by CBS for its direct attacks towards the two rival companies. A \"Forbes\" writer expressed concern that the network may have had intentionally shown protectionism towards the two soft drink companies (who have been long-time Super Bowl advertisers), and drew comparisons to a recent incident where the CBS-owned technology news site CNET was controversially forced by its parent company to block Dish Network's Hopper with Sling digital video recorder from being considered Best in Show at CES 2013 because the broadcaster was in active litigation over an automatic commercial skipping feature on the device.\nAn older SodaStream commercial was shown in its place, which also featured exploding pop bottles in a similar fashion, but with no direct references to any other brand; ironically, this particular ad had been banned in the United Kingdom by Clearcast for being considered \"a denigration of the bottled drinks market.\"\nAnother SodaStream ad featuring Scarlett Johansson was produced for and aired during Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014; the supposed rejection of an initial version for containing the line \"Sorry, Coke and Pepsi\" was overshadowed by growing controversies around the company's use of a factory that was located in an Israeli settlement on the West Bank.\nCoca-Cola: \"It's Beautiful\".\nIn 2014, Coca-Cola aired a Super Bowl advertisement entitled \"It's Beautiful\"; themed around multiculturalism, the ad featured scenes depicting Americans of various ethnicities, along with a same-sex couple—the first to ever appear in a Super Bowl ad, set to a rendition of the patriotic hymn \"America The Beautiful\" with lyrics sung in multiple languages.\nThe ad was divisive, with users taking to Twitter under the hashtag \"#SpeakAmerican\" to discuss their views and opinions on its content: those against the ad argued that per the melting pot principle, Coca-Cola should not have used languages other than English, the most common language of the country, to promote its products to ethnic minorities, and former Republican Congressman Allen West stated that \"If we cannot be proud enough as a country to sing 'America the Beautiful' in English in a commercial during the Super Bowl, by a company as American as they come—doggone we are on the road to perdition.\" By contrast, others praised the ad for celebrating the diversity of the American people, but questioned its appropriateness. \"Guardian\" writer Jill Filipovic noted that the company had been increasingly targeting minorities, such as Latino Americans (who are more likely to be heavy drinkers of soft drinks because of their low cost), but questioned the act of promoting increased soft drink consumption to minority groups that already heavily consume them and are at higher risk of diabetes, comparing the ad to nicotine marketing toward women, and stating that \"before we applaud Coke's advertising diversity, we should ask: do we really want Coke to diversify?\"\nThe commercial was re-aired prior to kickoff at Super Bowl LI, eliciting similar criticism.\nNationwide Insurance: \"Boy\".\nAt Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, after an eight-year hiatus, Nationwide Insurance returned to the game with two new advertisements. The second of these advertisements, \"Boy\" (also commonly referred to as \"Make Safe Happen\"), featured a child explaining that he couldn't grow up because he had already died—followed by scenes of an overflowing bathtub (implying drowning), spilled cleaning products (implying poisoning), and a television having fallen off of a wall (implying crushed). The ad was intended to promote Nationwide's child protection campaign \"Make Safe Happen\"; operated in partnership with Safe Kids USA and Nationwide Children's Hospital, it aims to draw awareness to deaths caused by preventable household accidents.\nViewers and critics acknowledged that the subject matter of \"Boy\" was a major contrast to other, upbeat and comedic ads broadcast during Super Bowl XLIX (including Nationwide's second ad, \"Invisible Mindy\"). Reception towards the ad was overwhelmingly negative; viewers criticized the company via social media for its decision to broadcast an ad dealing with such subject matter during the Super Bowl, Amobee estimated only 12% of reactions to the ad on Twitter were positive, and it ranked near the bottom of the \"USA Today\" Ad Meter results. Nationwide CMO Matthew Jauchius defended the ad, noting that the negative response was \"a little stronger than we anticipated,\" and that \"Boy\" was intended to \"begin a dialogue to make safe happen for children everywhere.\" Jauchius later exited Nationwide two months after the advertisement aired.\n84 Lumber: \"The Journey\".\nBuilding supply company 84 Lumber debuted at Super Bowl LI with \"The Journey\"; the ad depicted a mother and daughter migrating from Mexico to the United States border, only to discover that a wall had been built on it. However, after the daughter presented a handmade version of the U.S. flag that she had made with pieces of fabric collected along the way, the two discover a giant door in the wall. The ending of the ad is accompanied by the tagline \"The will to succeed is always welcome here.\"\nThe original version of the ad was rejected by Fox, as they believed that the border wall imagery was too politically sensitive in the wake of Donald Trump's presidency, as his campaign promises included a plan to build a wall across the entire southern border. The company's agency stated that it intended to present an edited version of the ad during the game, which would direct users to watch the full, 6-minute short film on 84 Lumber's website. The company reported that its website received a total of over 6 million visits in the hour following the airing, and received over 300,000 requests in a minute after the ad aired, causing it to crash.\nGNC: \"Courage to Change\".\nOn January 31, 2017, it was reported that an advertisement for the health store chain GNC had been rejected by the NFL for broadcast during Super Bowl LI. The ad had been rejected due to the company's inclusion on a list of \"prohibited companies\" issued by the NFL Players Association; a small number of GNC's products contain DHEA and Synephrine, which are performance-enhancing substances banned by the NFL. Inclusion on this list prohibits NFL players from promoting or endorsing the company. NFL policies do not allow advertising for \"dietary or nutritional supplements that contain ingredients other than vitamins and minerals, energy drinks, or any prohibited substance.\" Advertisements for health stores are not banned, provided that they do not reference such products. GNC's advertisement featured motivational themes as part of a larger \"Courage to Change\" marketing campaign and did not make any references to specific products sold by the chain.\nOn February 2, 2017, it was reported that GNC had threatened to sue Fox over the rejection. The letter of intent stated that the contents of GNC's commercial had been \"expressly approved\" twice by Fox and that the broadcaster did not inform GNC that ads broadcast during the Super Bowl were subject to approval by the NFL or any league policies. The company stated that Fox had \"induced GNC to spend millions of dollars in production costs and in the development of a national, coordinated marketing and rebranding campaign centered around this advertisement.\"\nRam Trucks: \"Built to Serve\".\nIn 2018 at Super Bowl LII, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles marque Ram Trucks aired a commercial entitled \"Built to Serve\", as one of two Ram ads during the game. It featured an extract from the \"Drum Major Instinct\" sermon given by Martin Luther King Jr. on February 4, 1968 (exactly 50 years prior), wherein King explained the virtues of serving others. The speech was, in turn, set to footage of people using their Ram vehicles to help others.\nThe ad was widely criticized for using the words of MLK to promote a product. It was also pointed out that King had, ironically, criticized the advertising industry during the same sermon as being \"gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion,\" explaining that \"in order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey. In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car. In order to be lovely to love you must wear this kind of lipstick or this kind of perfume. And you know, before you know it, you're just buying that stuff.\" William B. Wachtel, co-founder of the Drum Major Institute, stated that \"In a twist of irony, one of the specific evils Dr. King condemned was the exploitation of the drum major instinct by advertisers, particularly car advertisers.\" \"Current Affairs\" posted a parody of the commercial on YouTube, overdubbing the original audio with this section of the speech.\nUse of the speech was approved by Intellectual Properties Management, the exclusive commercial licensor of King's estate. A representative of the organization stated that they approved the ad because its overall message \"embodied Dr. King's philosophy that true greatness is achieved by serving others.\" Although the King Center distanced itself from the ad by stating that it was not responsible for its licensing, it was pointed out that Intellectual Properties Management was based within the facilities of the King Center to begin with and thus had close ties to the family. \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Michael Hiltzik argued that King's rights should be managed by a larger group of historians and scholars through an \"open and transparent\" process, rather than just his close family, \"so at least we don't have a situation where some corporation drapes itself in King's preacherly robes while the estate issues fatuous excuses that a TV commercial embodies 'Dr. King's philosophy'.\"\nT-Mobile.\nIn 2021, T-Mobile submitted three different ads for the Super Bowl, with one of them including Tampa Bay Buccaneers players Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski. In one of the ads, Brady and Gronkowski were in a video chat with Gronkowski encouraging Brady to retire and move to Florida while Brady, who was receiving a call in a \"spotty\" network, causes him to hear that retiring would make him weak and tells to move to Florida to win another Super Bowl, which he made such decision at the end.\nAlthough none of the competing networks were mentioned in the ad, T-Mobile confirmed that the ad was banned to protect the rights with the NFL's \"official teleco sponsor,\" potentially Verizon Wireless who was the sponsor of the NFL. T-Mobile made additional edits to the commercial, including some changes in dialogue but it was banned as well. Neither the NFL nor CBS commented on the commercials. T-Mobile did air another ad with a similar concept, this time with Gwen Stefani asking out on Adam Levine.\nHe Gets Us.\nIn 2023, evangelical Christian website He Gets Us ran ads during the Super Bowl which depicted Jesus as various modern day archetypes including a cancelled influencer, a refugee, and a struggling worker in black and white. A 2024 follow-up featured Christians washing the feet of similar archetypes. The organization, He Gets Us, is supported by mostly anonymous benefactors; one of its most prominent supporters is David Green.\nThe advertisements were criticized by people on both sides on the political spectrum, with prominent Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stating that \"Jesus would not spend millions of dollars on Super Bowl ads to make fascism look benign\". On the other side of the political spectrum, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk stated that the advert pandered to liberals and said that it was \"one of the worst services to Christianity in the modern era\". The 2024 advertisement drew similar polarized responses as well as criticism from Christian pastors for taking the foot-washing ritual out of its biblical context.\nInternationally.\nThe Super Bowl commercials are generally limited to the American television broadcast of the game. This prevents international viewers from watching the game with these often iconic commercials. Online postings of the commercials on sites such as YouTube have partially alleviated the issue, along with the airing of some of the commercials during local television newscasts in other countries, while NBC posted the Super Bowl XLIX commercials on a Tumblr blog as they aired during the game for the benefit of its U.S. online stream (which did not contain all of the same ads as the television feed).\nComplaints about the U.S. Super Bowl ads are common in Canada; although U.S. network affiliates are widely available on pay television providers in the country, \"simultaneous substitution\" regulations give Canadian television networks the right to request that a U.S. feed of a program be replaced with its Canadian counterpart on these providers if it is airing a program in simulcast with a U.S. network. This rule is intended to protect the investments of Canadian broadcasters in exclusive domestic broadcast rights, and also protect Canadian advertisers who had purchased their own advertising time on the Canadian network. As a result, most American Super Bowl ads are effectively \"blacked out\" by the Canadian broadcaster. Members of Parliament Bob Nault and Wayne Easter have stated that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), Canada's telecom regulator, has only received around 100 specific complaints about Super Bowl ads in relation to the simsub rules.\nSome U.S.-based advertisers, particularly PepsiCo and Anheuser-Busch (via its Canadian subsidiary Labatt), do buy ad time during the Canadian broadcast on CTV, owned by Bell Media—the broadcasting subsidiary of Canadian telecommunications firm BCE and the current rightsholder of the game, to air at least some of their American commercials, but many Canadian advertisers simply re-air ads from their regular rotation, or air the same ad multiple times over the course of the game, neither of which is typical during the U.S. network broadcast. Reasons cited by Canadian advertisers for these practices include the additional talent and post-production fees that would be required to broadcast the American ads in Canada, and the perceived lower \"cultural resonance\" of the game for Canadian viewers as opposed to Americans. As such, and because Canada's population is approximately a tenth of the United States', advertising time costs a fraction of the price to air an ad on the U.S. broadcast: prices ranged between $170,000 to $200,000 for a 30-second slot on CTV's telecast of Super Bowl XLIX.\nOn the other hand, in the 2010s, there were a growing number of Super Bowl ads produced specifically for the Canadian broadcast: Hyundai's Canadian subsidiary began airing its own Super Bowl ads in 2010, and Budweiser produced the hockey-themed \"Flash Fans\" to air during the Canadian broadcast of Super Bowl XLVI. The following year, two Canadian companies—BlackBerry and Gildan Activewear, made their debut as U.S. Super Bowl advertisers; their ads were also broadcast in Canada alongside those by McDonald's Canada, who debuted its \"Our Food. Your Questions.\" campaign, Budweiser's internet-connected hockey goal lights, and Hyundai Canada's \"Gaspocalypse\", promoting the Sonata Hybrid. Budweiser expanded its goal light campaign for Super Bowl 50, which featured an ad introducing a -tall goal lamp used as part of a promotional campaign leading towards the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. For Super Bowl LIV in 2020, Budweiser Canada produced a commercial reviving its previous Whassup? campaign from the early-2000s.\nFor Super Bowl LIII, Unifor purchased time on the Canadian broadcast to air an attack ad, criticizing General Motors' decision to close the Oshawa Car Assembly plant. On the Friday before the game, Unifor received a letter from GM Canada requesting that the ad be pulled, alleging that it was \"designed intentionally and maliciously to mislead Canadian consumers and forever tarnish GM's reputation with them.\"\nCanadian simsub ban.\nOn January 29, 2015, the CRTC announced a proposal to forbid the invocation of simultaneous substitution on the Super Bowl telecast, thus allowing the U.S. feeds of the event to co-exist with those of Canadian rightsholders on pay television providers. The decision came as a result of a series of hearings held by the CRTC known as \"Let's Talk TV\", which explored reforms of the Canadian television industry: the Commission cited viewer frustration over the use of simsubs, especially surrounding the Super Bowl, and argued that the commercials were an \"integral part\" of the game due to their cultural significance. In March 2015, Bell filed an appeal against this decision, arguing that the move would devalue its exclusive broadcast rights to the game, and violated the Broadcasting Act, which forbids the \"making of regulations singling out a particular program or licensee.\" A report commissioned by Bell estimated that without this lucrative exclusivity, it would lose about $13.6 million per year.\nIn spite of the complaints and legal action, the CRTC issued an order on August 19, 2016, that officially implemented the new rule. On September 6, 2016, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Bell Media's lawsuit for being premature, because it was filed before the CRTC had formally implemented the rules. On November 2, 2016, Bell was granted an appeal. In the lead-up to Super Bowl LI (which would be the first game to fall under this policy), several stakeholders, including the NFL, Bell Media, local unions. as well as politicians from both Canada and the U.S., called upon the CRTC to reverse the ruling. U.S. senators Marco Rubio and Ron Johnson wrote to an ambassador that the CRTC's decision \"sends a troubling signal about the value Canada places on its largest trading partner, best customer and close friend.\" Bell had also urged prime minister Justin Trudeau to invoke section 26(2) of the Broadcasting Act (which grants the government power to require the broadcasting of programming that is \"of urgent importance to Canadians\" and had only been invoked once before to mandate the broadcast of a major speech by a prime minister) to override the CRTC policy and still require that the Super Bowl LI telecast be subject to simsub.\nCourt action on the CRTC ruling was not taken in time for the game, meaning that Super Bowl LI was the first to be available through Canadian television providers without being subject to simsub. Some Canadian advertisers, such as Leon's and Pizza Pizza, took advantage of the decision by purchasing local ad time from U.S. Fox affiliates carried in Canada, to broadcast commercials aimed at the Canadian audience. The sales manager of Spokane's affiliate KAYU-TV praised the change for helping increase demand for its limited local inventory; the station is carried on cable in the significantly larger Canadian markets of Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta.\nNeither Nielsen nor Numeris (Canada's main television ratings provider) calculate Canadian viewership of U.S. television channels, so it is unknown exactly how many Canadian viewers watched the game directly from Fox stations rather than CTV. Following the game, it was reported that viewership of Super Bowl LI on CTV, in addition to CTV Two and TSN (which simulcast the game to increase the saturation of Bell-owned properties carrying it and offered an on-air sweepstakes as a publicity stunt to attract viewers), was down by 39% over Super Bowl 50.\nOn December 19, 2017, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Bell Media's case, ruling that the CRTC's policy was reasonable. Bell Media once again filed for an appeal in January 2018, this time in the Supreme Court of Canada. In December 2019 (prior to Super Bowl LIV) the decision was overturned by the Supreme Court, which ruled that the CRTC's policy overstepped article 9(1)(h) of the Broadcasting Act (which governs must-carry rules) since it \"does not empower the CRTC to impose terms and conditions on the distribution of programming services generally.\" The court did not rule on the CRTC's ability to enact policies based on specific programs."

        "title": "Trow Ghyll skeleton",
        "text": "The Trow Ghyll skeleton is a set of human remains discovered on 24 August 1947 in a cave near Clapham in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. It was named after a prominent topographical feature located some away. Although the identity of the body has never been ascertained, it has been claimed that they were those of a German spy. The unexplained death has been described as \"the most notable\" mystery over a possible Nazi agent in Britain.\nDiscovery.\nOn 24 August 1947, two friends who were keen potholers decided to go out looking for new potholes to explore near the famous Ingleborough Cave. They were Jim Leach (23 December 1920 – 15 March 2000) who was then working as an electrician and living at Great Harwood near Blackburn, and Harold Burgess (1918 – 11 August 2000), then a motor engineer and living in Leeds. The two were good friends (known as \"Jim and Budge\") who were members of the Northern Pennine Club and later became business partners.\nAt about 12:30 pm, they discovered a small hole (subsequently named Body Pot) which was partly obscured by stones. On moving the stones to make the entrance bigger, Leach climbed down about 10 feet where he saw a pair of shoes. Looking round he then saw the skull and the rest of the body, under a large stone (although it was not resting on the body); the remains had suffered advanced decomposition and there was hardly any flesh remaining. Burgess spotted near the body a small bottle of white powder which he assumed to be flash powder.\nLeach and Burgess returned to Clapham to raise the alarm and later that afternoon returned to the cave with Police Sergeant Nock of Ingleton; the police stationed a guard outside the cave until the body could be photographed and then removed the following day. The remains were taken to Skipton mortuary and the effects found in the cave were sent to the forensic laboratory at Wakefield. The local community was quickly reassured that foul play had been ruled out as a cause of death.\nA second skeleton.\nBy coincidence, a week later on 31 August another skeleton was found not far away at Gaping Gill. These remains were unidentified but were found to be those of a man of between 25 and 35 years, who had died two or three years previously, and had been killed in a fall down the cave.\nInquest.\nThe findings of the various checks on the discovery were reported to an inquest held on 25 November at Skipton town hall before Coroner Stephen E. Brown and a jury. Leach and Burgess gave evidence of their discovery, and the police witnesses told of how they had preserved the evidence and transmitted it to the appropriate authorities. The main evidence at the inquest was given by the scientific witnesses.\nPost mortem examination.\nOn 26 August Professor P. L. Sutherland conducted a post mortem examination on the body. He found that the remains were those of a man who was tall, aged between 22 and 30 at the time of death, and that death had occurred at least two and no more than six years before. He was able to rule out broken or diseased bones as a cause of death (none were fractured or broken), although not all of them were present. The bones were entirely separate from each other and the brain had disappeared; his clothes had rotted to the point where it was difficult to distinguish them.\nForensic tests.\nLewis Nickolls of the North East Forensic Science Laboratory reported that the man had been wearing a blue shirt and tie, and a grey-blue suit with red and white stripes \"about three to the inch\". He had a tweedy herringbone overcoat, grey trilby hat, and a plum coloured scarf (which would have been over the mouth at the time of death). He also had light brown to auburn hair.\nThe most interesting evidence dealt with those of the man's possessions which had not rotted away. The glass bottle seen by Burgess turned out not to contain flash powder, but Sodium cyanide, a lethal poison. The bottle was full to the shoulder although it was possible, said Nickolls, to have extracted a lethal dose from it. An unbroken ampule of the same material was also found. Of his other possessions, the man had coins to the value of 11 shillings 5 ½ pence, with none of the coins newer than 1939. Nickolls said that the date of death would have been two years after that.\nThere were two pairs of shoes, one of which had been made in 1938 and the other in 1939. There was a mineral water bottle of a type supplied to hotels in Morecambe, Lancaster and Ingleton, and containing a blue 'crown' top not introduced until 1940. Other items found with the man included a wristlet watch, handkerchief, shaving tube, studs, toothbrush, fountain pen, propelling pencil, compass, box of matches, tablets, flashlamp, and toiletries. The man had a key but the police were unable to identify the lock which it opened.\nIdentity.\nWhen the body was discovered, wide publicity was given and several people came forward to link missing relatives to the remains. The police compiled the suggestions into a list of 18, of which four turned out to be alive, ten were ruled out for bearing no resemblance to the remains, and for the four remaining it was impossible to say whether they were the man. The inquest returned a verdict that there was insufficient evidence of cause of death and to identify the remains.\nMystery.\nAt the inquest, Nickolls had been asked about the cyanide phial and ampule and said that it was used commercially and as a poison for vermin. However, he had to admit that he had not seen the same design before. The legal historian A. W. B. Simpson, who was living in Clapham at the time of the discovery, later noted that the only known users of such an ampule were spies operating in enemy countries, who had them in order to commit suicide in the event that they were discovered.\nSimpson claimed that the individual was \"plainly connected in some way with the German secret service\" and that he was \"the most notable .. mystery\" over a German agent. He further remarked that \"Such enquiries as I have made from persons who ought to know have produced evasiveness\".\nHowever, Simpson's claims are not supported by German intelligence documents discovered after the war. According to the British domestic security service, MI5, Germany had sent around 115 agents against Britain during the course of the war. Almost all of these had been successfully identified and caught, with the exception of Willem Ter Braak – not the body found at Trow Ghyll – who had committed suicide before being captured."

        "title": "United States Bicycle Motocross Association",
        "text": "The United States Bicycle Association (USBA) was a short-lived Bicycle Motocross (BMX) national sanctioning body based in Tempe, Arizona. It was founded in March 1984 by five former members of the American Bicycle Association (ABA): Rich Mann, Dave Cook, Geoff Sims, Steve Schaefer and Rod Keeling, who became the USBA's first President. Keeling was previously the ABA's former Vice President of Marketing and prior to that a pilot with the ABA's failed air charter service. It was to last only for two and a half seasons before being brought on by the ABA early in 1986 season (the ABA itself was by then was under new ownership). \nSuccession.\nMennenga was the sole owner of the ABA at the time and directed the sanctioning body in an autocratic fashion. Mennenga filed suit against the 5 individuals for breach of contract in 1984. No contracts were ever produced by Mennenga and the suit was dismissed. Many believe that the lawsuit was an attempt by the ABA to crush the new competitors, and while unsuccessful, it did bleed time and resources from the USBA and engendered the destructive atmosphere that was to follow.\nOf the original five founders of the USBA, Dave Cook and Geoff Sims, both commercial pilots, left the company for flying jobs shortly after its creation. Soon after the 1985 USBA Grand National in October, Keeling was forced out of the USBA by the major USBA investor group, led by Ira Hall. This occurred while Hall was negotiating a merger with the potential new ABA owners and Keeling became a liability to the deal. \nThe 1985 USBA Grand National held in the Tarrant County Civic Center in Fort Worth, Texas, could arguably be recognized as the high point for the sanctioning body. With over 200 motorcycles, an indoor arena dirt track and some of the top riders participating. \nAccusations.\nThe USBA did used tactics to lure tracks away from the ABA, including track operator Gary Ellis Sr., \"father of pro racer Gary Ellis Jr.\", who ran the ABA affiliated River Valley BMX track in Sumner, Washington State. This was an unsuccessful attempt to have Ellis transfer his allegiance to the USBA from the ABA. The USBA denounced the ABA and warned of its supposed imminent demise without saying how joining the USBA would benefit the track operator and what the USBA could do for BMX as a whole. While many ABA track operators remained loyal to the ABA despite its past problems, over 160 left to the USBA, effectively dividing the ABA BMX racing world.\nABA had many creditors, some of them with substantial funds at risk that may have been involved. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was cited as a suspect since they had ongoing legal actions against them. Indeed, it was pressure from them that made the ABA file Chapter 11 even though the new owners were trying to avoid it. IRS agents were on hand observing the 1985 ABA Grand National in Oklahoma. It was very clear that they were under investigation. The IRS had easy access to the ABA's Bank records. Unless they had a court order, bugging a telephone line would be an illegal and unnecessary risk with little to gain.\nIn ill-advised move, the new USBA management had business dealings with disgraced promoter Renny Roker. This promoter who gained so much respect with his JAG World Championship series held from 1978–1982 lost all that respect with his ill-fated 1983 ESPN Pro Spectacular Series, culminating in the defaulting of the professional racer's winnings in the last race in Burbank, California, including series champion Greg Hill. His and other pro racer's checks \"bounced\" when they attempted to redeem them. For that and other infractions had made Renny Roker a pariah in the BMX World.\nThus it was a surprise for USBA who knew of Roker's soiled reputation to have dealings with him in any fashion. As much as it was ill-advised, they had an agreement with Roker that he would tape for broadcast on cable TV by the Nickelodeon network the USBA's San Diego National held in early 1986. The USBA promoted heavily in advertising that that event would be broad cast by the cable network. Many of the top BMX bicycle manufactures including Murry, Redline, GT, CW et al. sent their factory teams to that race in the hope of TV exposure for their products. Not only was that San Diego national was a typical low turnout USBA event, Roker did not appear to tape the nations for the promised TV coverage. The USBA blamed Renny Roker for making false promises to them while many suspected that the USBA used the ruse of promised national television coverage to boost their attendance levels. Whatever the truth it left many manufactures embittered toward the USBA for the rest of its existence.\nThe ending of that existence was not long in coming.\nAfter a shaky first two years of operations, it met with financial problems during 1986 which was the result of low sign ups for its nationals that plagued it from the beginning. Factors that fed this apathy by racers were poor track construction; delays in running of races; equipment failure, holding their nationals which coincided with those of the ABA and NBL. For instance during the low amateur sign up (the professionals attended in mass) Pro Series No.3 held near Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1986 the electronic starting gate broke and starts had to look back to an earlier era of BMX and manually drop the gate. This was on top of race delays and a poorly constructed, maintained and dusty track.\nIn early 1986 to obtain more members, the USBA brought the freestyle BMX National Freestyle Association (NFA) sanctioning body in early 1986 from Hutch Hi-Performance BMX, a bicycle company that had created the NFA originally in 1985. Within a couple of months the USBA itself would be bought out.\nIronically, the USBA approached the ABA with an offer of a buyout despite its own financial difficulties. The ABA itself was in financial dire straits and was in Chapter 11 financial reorganization. As it turned out, the USBA turned out to be in worse financial health and it was the ABA who would make a counter offer to buy the USBA. While the ABA was in Chapter 11, it could not buy any part the USBA or merge with it under the law as a company. However, two new stockholders of the ABA corporation at the time, Jamie Vargas and Bernie Anderson brought a 60% controlling shares of USBA stock as individuals from USBA investor Ira Hall. Bernie Anderson and Jamie Vargas had jointly bought controlling shares of stock in the struggling ABA in April 1985 from its founder and president Merl Mennenga and took control of the USBA on April 1, 1986. By all accounts were turning it around financially. They allowed the USBA to run as a separate sanctioning body for the rest of the 1986 racing season.\nThe two sanctioning bodies formally merged in 1987 after the ABA cleared Chapter 11. It inherited all of the USBA's 136 tracks and membership.\nThe last USBA sanctioned (but under ABA management) race, the 1986 Grand Nationals was held in Ft. Worth, Texas, on October 26, 1986, at the famed Cowtown track, an ABA affiliated race course. This was a next to last minute change of venue when the previously chosen site proved unsuitable. Approximately 700 racers attended in 116 motos, very well attended by USBA standards. It was by all accounts a well run race on a well received track. The short, inglorious days of United States Bicycle Association ended on an up note.\nVital statistics.\nAccording to the last issue of \"USBA Racer\", which was embedded in the January/February 1987 issue of \"American BMXer\", the last USBA sanctioned races occurred on December 14, 1986, at the Desert Downs track in Texas and the Alameda Raceway track in New Mexico.\nOperations.\nWhatever the politics and motivations, since the management were former ABA officials it is not surprising that many ABA practices carried over to the new governing body, like the use of the Direct Transfer System, in which a racer has to win just one moto or heat to transfer to the finals or Mains. In smaller races perhaps two or more racers would transfer. In larger races the rider(s) transfers not to the Main but to the semi-finals, or if necessary the quarter-finals, 1/8s and 1/16.\nThis is different from National Bicycle League (NBL) practice of using the moto or Olympic system, which has all the racers in that class run three times and their individual places average out over a points system. Those who place first through fourth highest in average moto points would then transfer to the Main, or again if necessary to semi-finals, etc.\nFor the first two seasons of its existence the USBA practiced a nearly unique system of advancement in the amateur ranks called the \"Bye\". In a Bye, if you won your class at a national level race held a day before the Grand Nationals (called a pre-race) you did not have to race the qualifying motos in the Grand Nationals. You could go directly to the semi-finals, or if the class was large, the quarter-finals, 8ths, etc. This involved very complicated paperwork integrating the previous days class winners into the semis of the Grand National competitors who worked their way up in the qualifying motos. The Bye was dropped due to this complexity for the 1986 season. This system was tried before by the National Bicycle Association (NBA) in 1974 and it also failed both for its complexity and the perceived unfairness of transferring racers to the semi-finals (or quarter finals, etc.) by not earning that position by racing the qualifying motos like everyone else had to during that event.\nOn the pro level in the ABA, NBL and USBA, the Main is run three times and the winner is determined by the lowest main point average. On the amateur level in all three sanctions the Main is just run once in winner take all fashion.\nThe USBA like the ABA also had an overall number one amateur male and female and an overall amateur cruiser number one, again different from NBL practice of awarding number ones for separate age groups.\nUnited States Bicycle Association list of National number ones.\n\"Pro Nat.#1\"\n\"Pro Cruiser Nat.#1\"\n\"Amat.

Donald falters on the fairway while his caddies Huey, Dewey, and Louie all try to \"tee\" him off, with a grasshopper and a bag of trick clubs.\nPlot.\nDonald Duck is taking his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie to a golf course to play golf. After his nephews build a stand made of sand, Donald prepares to swing but is interrupted by a tweeting songbird. Donald tells the bird to be quiet and it does. Before Donald can swing, he is interrupted again, this time by his nephews blowing into tissues. Angrily, Donald hushes them and sticks clips on their bills, only to have them thrown off and hit Donald (one in the tail). In a rage, Donald breaks his club and is offered a trick club by his nephews. Donald hits the golf ball only to find out that the \"club\" is actually a net and the ball is in the net right behind him. Donald gets another trick club which becomes an umbrella, creates a fake rainstorm, and pops out a fake bee.\nUnable to stand the tricks any longer, Donald orders his nephews off the field. They soon find a grasshopper, however, and put it in a ball to make another trick for Donald. When Donald hits the ball, it bounces away all by itself instead of rolling. Donald chases after it and drives it into the golf pond. Huey, Dewey, and Louie offer him a raft to follow it but before Donald can catch the ball, they pull a valve making the raft deflate. Donald falls into the pond headfirst and tries to hit the ball from underwater. He hits it out of the water and follows it, only to discover that there's a grasshopper in it. The grasshopper bounces away and Donald follows, only to be trapped when his deflated raft (which he is still wearing around his waist) ties up around him after he trips. His nephews then begin playing their own game, hitting their balls between poles (and using Donald's head as a bounce-off stand) to get them into the holes. In a rage after they walk over him, Donald breaks free of the raft and throws his club at them, intending to hit them on the heads, but it turns into a boomerang and hits him instead, throwing him into the hole and leaving him shouting in rage (from inside the hole).\nHome media.\nThe short was released on May 18, 2004 on \"\".\nAdditional releases include:"

        "text": "The 2006 EHF European Men's Handball Championship was the seventh tournamentof the tournament and held in Switzerland from 26 January to 5 February 2006, in the cities of Basel, Bern, Lucerne, St. Gallen and Zürich. France won the tournament, going through unbeaten after an early defeat to Spain. France's defence conceded the fewest goals per game in the entire tournament, with 192 conceded goals in eight matches. The hosts Switzerland were knocked out at the first group stage, while Denmark finished third and Croatia fourth to qualify directly for the 2007 World Championship, along with France.\nQualification.\nNote: Bold indicates champion for that year. \"Italic\" indicates host for that year.\nPreliminary round.\nGroup A.\nThis group was played in the Kreuzbleichhalle, St. Gallen (capacity: 4,500). Poland qualified first, winning the first match and then drawing the second against Switzerland despite an equaliser with 15 seconds to go, and two hours later they were joined by Slovenia, who came back from a two-goal deficit in the last ten minutes to beat Ukraine by 33–31. Switzerland and Ukraine thus played off for the last place in the main round, and the Swiss got behind from the start, trailing by 21–14 at half time. Ten minutes into the second half, Ukraine were 28–16 up, before allowing Switzerland somewhat back into it near the end. They still won 37–30, however, qualifying for the second round with zero points. Slovenia beat Poland 33–29 to carry forward four points, while Poland got two.\nGroup B.\nThe matches in this group were played in St. Jakobshalle, Basel (capacity 8,500). Germany became the first team to qualify, drawing their first match with Spain before overcoming Slovakia (who ended up by conceding 100 goals, the most in the group stage) in their second game. Spain followed soon after, beating France by 29–26 after a 17–9 lead at half time, but the French were also through as they would be ahead of Slovakia on head-to-head if the two were to end on two points each. Thus, their last match with Germany only determined how many points they would carry forward to the main round; France risked going through with nil, but after prevailing 27–25 they finished the group in second place and took two points.\nGroup C.\nThe matches in this group were held in the Sursee Stadthalle in Sursee/Lucerne. Denmark and Iceland opened with wins, and with a draw in the second round both teams qualified for the main round. Serbia and Montenegro joined them due to the head-to-head encounter rule; despite finishing level on points with Hungary after losing to Denmark in the last match, Serbia and Montenegro had beaten Hungary and thus finished ahead. Iceland lost their last match, but nevertheless carried through three points to the main round, as did Denmark.\nGroup D.\nThis group was played out in the Wankdorfhalle, Bern. Russia became the first team to qualify for the main round when they beat Portugal on 27 January. Croatia joined them later that day with a 32–28 win over Norway, and Norway and Portugal played off for the last main round spot on Sunday 29 January. Norway won that match by ten goals, thus proceeding to the main round with zero points; Russia got a full score with four points, despite nearly throwing away a five-goal lead in the last five minutes against Croatia.\nMain round.\nResults from the first group stage were carried forward into the main round.\nThe first and second placed teams from each group advance to the semifinals. The third placed team of each group advance to play for the fifth place in the tournament.\nGroup I.\nThe matches in this group were played in St. Jakobshalle, Basel. Slovenia had gone through their group with four points from their two matches, but lost initially to France, who were second after two matches. Indeed, Group B teams dominated this group; all nine matches in the second round were won by teams from Group B, and Germany's 36–22 win over Ukraine in the first round of main round play was the largest all tournament. Ukraine were thus knocked out of the semis with two games to play.\nGermany continued on the winning path the following day, taking a four-goal lead at half-time against Slovenia in a rerun of the 2004 final, before Slovenia pegged them back to 27–27 midway through the second half. The following nine minutes gave the Germans a five-goal advantage, with keeper Henning Fritz conceding one goal in those nine minutes, and with five minutes to spare Slovenia could only come back to a three-goal deficit. Nevertheless, Germany were still third in the group, as France beat Poland by ten goals and Spain were eventually pegged back to 31–29 by Ukraine after conceding five goals without reply in the last seven minutes. However, Ukraine missed a penalty shot from and Spain prevailed.\nThe final round of matches opened with Germany beating Poland by eight goals, winning the first half by 16–7 and controlling from there, as their keeper Johannes Bitter saved 21 shots. By contrast, the two Polish keepers had an aggregate of six saves. However, Germany needed either France or Spain to lose their matches, and France would not oblige; they beat Ukraine by 30–20 to qualify for the semi-finals. Spain needed a draw against Slovenia to qualify, and the teams were within two goals of each other for most of the first half. The Spanish goalkeeper made four saves in the final five minutes of the first half, allowing Spain to get a 19–16 lead, and Slovenia never came closer than two goals after that. Spain thus qualified for the semi-finals in first place, ahead of France, while Germany played off for fifth place and a spot at the 2008 European Championship.\nGroup II.\nThis group's matches took place in the Kreuzbleichhalle, St. Gallen.\nIceland took an early lead in this group after beating Russia 34–32 in the first match, which sent Russia down from first to third place. Croatia went second in the group after beating Denmark, left winger Goran Šprem settling the match when he scored two seconds before the end, while Norway were the only team without a point in this group after losing their match with Serbia and Montenegro. With 25 seconds remaining, Kristian Kjelling scored a penalty to equalise, but Milorad Krivokapić scored his only goal of the match just as the buzzer sounded to give Serbia and Montenegro the victory.\nRussia quickly recovered from the loss against Iceland, with their keeper Alexei Kostygov saving 14 of 34 shots as Serbia/Montenegro were beaten 29–21, and went top of the table ahead of Croatia – who beat Iceland by one goal, though Iceland's last two goals came in the very last minute. In the last match on 1 February, Denmark kept their semi-final hopes alive with a 35–31 win over Norway, to stay within one point of the leaders.\nThe following day saw Croatia become the first team to qualify for the semi-finals when they beat Serbia and Montenegro by 34–30; the teams followed each other until 20–20 ten minutes into the second half, when wingers Goran Šprem and Mirza Džomba scored five of six successive Croatian goals. Goalkeeper Vlado Šola saved 19 of 43 shots from Serbian players. Iceland needed a win against Norway, who had failed to win a match thus far in the tournament, and led 16–14 at half time after Norway threw away the ball on their last attack of the half and Iceland countered in a last goal. Norway came back, equalising eight minutes into the second half, and with ten minutes to go they took a three-goal lead which they never relinquished, eventually winning 36–33 to knock Iceland out of the championship. Norwegian back player Kjetil Strand scored 19 goals in the match, eight more than any other player had done in a match thus far in the tournament, and more than half of Norway's goals.\nThe final match between Russia and Denmark was now a virtual quarter-final. Russia gained a 6–3 lead after ten minutes, but were pegged back, and by the end of the half it was 13–13. In the second half, Russia suffered three two-minute suspensions within a minute, and during the three-minute period of Danish numerical superiority they went from 19–17 to 22–17. The lead never shrunk below five goals again, Denmark eventually scoring 22 goals in the second half to win 35–28 and qualify for the semi-finals in second place.\nFinal round.\nThese took place in the largest stadium to be used in the tournament, the Hallenstadion in Zürich (capacity 11,500). The first match was the fifth-place play-off, determining the final direct qualifying spot for the 2008 European Men's Handball Championship; the other semi-finalists had already qualified directly. Russia took a two-goal lead through Oleg Frolov when he gave them 6–4 in the ninth minute, and Germany failed to catch up before half-time, though they won the last eight minutes 5–3. Russia went into the break with an 18–16 lead, but failed to score for eight minutes midway through the second half, while Christian Zeitz scored four successive goals for Germany to take them into a three-goal lead, which they kept for the remainder of the match despite Eduard Kokcharov scoring two penalties with five minutes to go. Zeitz ended up with 12 goals, eight of which came in the second half.\nIn the first of the two semi-finals, France faced Croatia, and after Croatia won the first 20 minutes by 10–8 the French goalkeeper Thierry Omeyer shut the goal. Nine saves were recorded before half-time, as France went into a 12–10 lead, and a further two in the first five minutes of the second half allowed France to build a four-goal lead. They never gave it away again, as Michael Guigou netted six times in the second half to ensure a 29–23 victory.\nSpain became the second team from preliminary group B to qualify for the final, coming back from a 15–16 deficit at half time when Iker Romero scored four successive goals for Spain to bring them from 20–19 to 24–20. Denmark came within one goal, when Lars Rasmussen netted on a fast break, but three Spanish goals and two saves followed, and the Danes never came back in the match.\nDenmark won the third place play-off, however, coming back from 2–5 down to lead 16–9 at half time against Croatia and eventually winning by five goals, before France went into the final against the defending World Champions Spain. France had lost the group stage match by three goals, and Spain took a 4–1 lead after five minutes, before a four-minute rally from France brought them back in the lead. Spain were catching up for the most part of the first half, equalising four times but not taking the lead until Iker Romero scored a penalty shot in the 21st minute. France then won the last nine minutes of the half by 6–1, and went into the break with a four-goal lead.\nComing out of the break, Spain came within two goals, trailing by 20–22 when ten minutes had passed. However, they then went nearly fifteen minutes without a goal, which included a period of playing with six men against four. When Rolando Urios finally scored, France still led by 28–21 with six minutes to go, and France eventually won the match by 31–23 to win their first European Championship.\nRanking and statistics.\nTop goalkeepers.\n\"(minimum 20% of total shots received by team)\""

        "title": "Australia national baseball team",
        "text": "The Australian national baseball team represents Australia in international baseball tournaments and competitions. It is ranked as the top team in Oceania, and is the Oceanian Champion, having been awarded the title in 2007 when New Zealand withdrew from the Oceania Baseball Championship. After achieving a last (16th) place in the 2013 World Baseball Classic, its rank dropped to 13, which is the lowest rank Australia ever received. The highest rank it has achieved is 6th, and its current rank is 10th.\nThe Australian team participated in the Summer Olympic Games in 1996, 2000, and 2004, but failed to qualify for 2008. The team has also participated in both of the other major international baseball tournaments recognised by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF): the Baseball World Cup and most recently the World Baseball Classic (WBC).\nThe team is controlled by the Australian Baseball Federation, which is represented in the Baseball Confederation of Oceania (BCO). Prior to the BCO's formation, Australia competed in the Asian Baseball Championship under the Baseball Federation of Asia (BFA). Australia continues to have a relationship with the BFA; the 2011 resumption of the Asia Series includes the Australian Baseball League's champion team. Team Australia came in 6th in the 12-team 2019 WBSC Premier12 Tournament, in November 2019.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball match results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nWorld ranking.\nIn January 2009 the International Baseball Federation created a ranking system so that the nations involved in international competition could be compared independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish at the end of tournaments. The system takes into account results not only of the senior men's teams but also of junior teams. Weightings that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are based on the number of teams competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible to be represented), and in the case of continental tournaments such as the Oceania Baseball Championship the relative strength of teams eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time. Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process; the most recent was the 2009 Baseball World Cup.\nWhen the rankings were first introduced, Australia was listed at 10th position. The high-water mark was after the 2009 World Baseball Classic when they were in 9th. The lowest position they have been in the ranking since its inception is 11th. At the end of 2010, Australia had returned to their original position of 10th.\nInternational competition.\nIn January 2009 the IBAF, in releasing the first edition of the world rankings, announced the classifications of various tournaments that contributed to the rankings themselves. In doing so, they identified that of the \"world\" tournaments, there were different levels with differing levels of weighting towards the ranks: major world championships, minor world championships, world qualifying tournaments and continental championships/qualifying tournaments.\nMajor world championships.\nThere are currently three recognised tournaments that are considered \"major\" by the IBAF: the World Baseball Classic, the Summer Olympic Games and the Baseball World Cup. Of those, the Summer Olympics will be phased out of the rankings structure, as baseball will no longer be contested as an Olympic event.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\nAustralia has competed in all four editions of the World Baseball Classic. All sixteen teams that played in the 2006 edition were invited to compete in the second in 2009. By virtue of their third-place finish in their first-round pool, Australia qualified compete at the 2013 edition of the WBC.; however, they were eliminated with an 0–3 record and finished in last place overall.\nAustralia, which has not progressed beyond the first round of competition, achieved its highest finish, 9th, in the 2017 tournament. Unusual for international competition in baseball, the squads selected in the World Baseball Classic tournaments featured players active in Major League Baseball in addition to Minor League, Nippon Professional Baseball and local players. Generally players in the Major Leagues are unavailable for international representative teams due to their contracts with the respective clubs.\nUnited States, 2006.\nPrior to formally starting their campaign, Australia played an exhibition game, which they lost, against a Boston Red Sox squad at City of Palms Park in Fort Myers, Florida. This was also the site of their training camp.\nAustralia competed in Pool D—along with Dominican Republic, Italy and Venezuela—in the first round at Cracker Jack Stadium in Orlando, Florida. The other three teams were able to field a large number of Major League players. Of players born outside the United States on 2006 Major League Opening Day rosters, the Dominican Republic (85) and Venezuela (43) had more than all other countries and between them accounted for more than 57% of foreign-born players in the leagues. Italy is among the top nations in Europe and had access to Italian-American players under the eligibility rules for the tournament. Thus, Australia was considered the underdog in the pool.\nHaving failed to win any of their round-robin pool games, they finished last in their pool, and were eliminated with Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Italy, Netherlands, Panama and South Africa. The eventual champions were Japan.\nMexico, 2009.\nAustralia was based in Peoria, Arizona—the site of the Seattle Mariners spring training camp—for their preparation for the formal start of their 2009 campaign. Unlike 2006, in which they had one exhibition game, they competed against three different Major League clubs: the Seattle Mariners, the Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago White Sox. Their game against Seattle was Ken Griffey Jr.'s first game playing for the Mariners since October 1999, and was also their first victory as part of a World Baseball Classic tour.\nAustralia was drawn in Pool B for the 2009 tournament, along with Cuba, Mexico and South Africa, competing at Foro Sol Stadium in Mexico City. After beating Mexico in their opening game, they lost their next two games to Cuba and Mexico, and were eliminated from the tournament. The Australians set a WBC record against Mexico: 22 hits in a single game is more than any other team has achieved in either tournament.\nTaiwan, 2013.\nIn June 2011, it was announced that the field for the 2013 WBC would be expanded to include an additional 12 teams and that a qualifying round would be several months prior to the main tournament. The qualifying tournament involved the 12 newly invited teams, as well as the four lowest-placed teams from the 2009 tournament; all teams who did not win a game. The qualifying tournament broke the teams into four pools of four teams each, which competed in a six-game, modified double-elimination format, similar to the first round of the 2009 tournament, with the winners of the sixth game in each pool proceeding to the main tournament. Australia, having finished 12th after beating Mexico in their first game in 2009, automatically qualified for the main tournament.\nThe main tournament combined elements of both previous WBC editions. The first round was split all teams into four pools, where the teams competed in a round-robin, as was the case in the 2006 tournament. The second round used the same modified double-elimination format as used in the 2009 tournament and the 2013 qualifying tournament. The final round was contested in the same manner as both previous tournaments: the top two teams from each group in the second round qualifying for the two semi-final matches, the winners of which played in the championship game.\nAustralia was drawn into Pool B, which was held at the Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium in Taiwan. In their opener, they fell to host and qualifiers Chinese Taipei, 4–1. They followed up with a 6–0 loss to South Korea before finishing with a 4–1 defeat to the Netherlands.\nPool B Game 1\nGame 4\nGame 5\nOlympic Games.\nAustralia was the third nation, after the United States and Sweden, to participate in baseball at the Summer Olympics, making their first appearance at the 1956 Games in Melbourne, and again as part of its demonstration at the 1988 Games in Seoul. Though the sport has applied for re-admission for 2016, baseball is no longer contested as a medal event at the Olympics.\nSince baseball was first included as a medal sport at the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Australia has participated in three of the five tournaments. The best result achieved was in the 2004 Games in Athens, where Australia lost the gold medal match to Cuba to receive silver. Their medal tally puts them at 5th, equal to Chinese Taipei.\nAustralia did not send a team to the 2021 Olympic qualifiers.\nWorld Cup.\nAustralia has participated in ten of the IBAF World Cup tournaments. To date its best result has been 5th, which Australia has achieved twice in both of the most recent tournaments held—2009 and 2011. At the 2007 tournament, Trent Oeltjen became the first Australian player to be named in a World Cup All Star team, in recognition of his tournament-leading hitting and base-running statistics. Australia is currently participating in the 2011 tournament in Panama.\nUntil 1986, the World Cup was actually referred to as the \"Amateur World Series\". The Amateur World Series only made use of round-robin fixtures, with teams ranked at the end of the tournament. Australia's first appearance was in Italy in 1978. Out of the ten teams to compete, Australia finished 9th ahead of the other debuting team, Belgium.\nSince the 1988 tournament, it has held the \"World Cup\" name, with the IBAF recognising the past Amateur World Series winners as World Cup winners. With the change of name came a change in format for the tournament: a round-robin phase, followed by a knockout phase for the top four teams. (Later tournaments would see two pools used in the first phase, and an expanded knockout phase including the top four teams from each pool.) In the \"World Cup Era\", Australia has reached the final phase four times, finishing 7th in 1998, 6th in 2007 and most recently 5th in 2009 and 2011.\nPremier12 Tournament.\n2019.\nTeam Australia came in sixth in the 12-team 2019 WBSC Premier12 Tournament in November 2019.\nMinor world championships.\nThere are six separate tournaments that the IBAF currently recognises as \"minor world championships\". Of those, Australia has only participated in one senior tournament: the Intercontinental Cup. (Australia has also participated in the World Junior Baseball Championship and the World Youth Baseball Championship, both of which are also included in the same category for the IBAF rankings.)\nIntercontinental Cup.\nAustralia is one of five nations to have won the Intercontinental Cup, winning the 1999 tournament by beating Cuba 4–3 in extra innings in front of a home crowd in Sydney. It was the first time Australia had won an international baseball tournament, and through 2009 the only win outside of the Oceania Baseball Championship. The team enjoyed several individual successes as well:\nIt was only the third time Cuba had been beaten in the gold medal match in the tournament's history, having reached the tournament decider every time they have participated. Australia also shares another honour with Cuba: of the nine nations to have hosted the tournament, only Australia and Cuba have won as hosts, combining for five tournament wins from five times hosted. (Cuba in 1979, 1987, 1995 and 2002, Australia in 1999.)\nAustralia first participated in the tournament at the 1981 Intercontinental Cup, managing only one win out of their seven games, finishing 8th. Missing the 1983 Intercontinental Cup, they returned in 1985 to repeat their previous performance: 1 win, 8th-place finish. They would not reappear at the tournament until 1993 where they improved to a 5–4 record to finish in 6th position.\nAustralia's first medal performance at the Intercontinental Cup (and their first medal at a world tournament) was at the 1997 tournament. In their best performance through the preliminary round, they put together a 6–1 record losing only to eventual silver-medalists Cuba, and beating eventual gold-medalists Japan. They lost to Japan in the semi-final, but beat the United States for the second time in the tournament to secure the bronze.\nAustralia also competed in the most recent tournament in 2006. There they finished in 5th position, compiling a 3–4 record. This is likely to be the last edition of the tournament for the foreseeable future.\nContinental tournaments.\nAustralia is the second of only two nations to have participated in IBAF-sanctioned continental tournaments for more than one continent: the Asian Baseball Championship between 1971 and 1993, and the Oceania Baseball Championship since 2003. The first nation to achieve this was Guam, who competed in the Asian tournament within the same timeframe as Australia, though they were involved in the first Oceania tournament in 1999.\nAsian Baseball Championship.\nAustralia is one of thirteen nations to have participated in the Asian Baseball Championship since the tournament was first held in 1954. The last time they contested the championship was in 1993, as a result of joining the newly formed Baseball Confederation of Oceania. Though their best result was a bronze medal in the 1975, the only teams to consistently finish ahead of Australia were Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei—the top three teams in Asia, and all in the top five in the world.\nOceania Baseball Championship.\nThough scheduled to participate on three separate occasions, Australia has only contested the Oceania Baseball Championship once in 2003. The two other times, Australia's scheduled opponents—Guam in 2004 and New Zealand in 2007—withdrew from competition in the lead up to each series, both times scheduled to be held in Sydney. Australia was awarded the championship both times, and as a result represented Oceania at the 2004 Summer Olympics and at the 2007 Baseball World Cup respectively.\nHeld during late April 2003, Australia won its first continental championship, beating hosts Guam , and to win the best of five series three games to one. (Guam won the third game .)"

        "title": "Rugby League World Sevens",
        "text": "The Rugby League World Sevens, usually referred to as the World Sevens and sometimes as the World Cup Sevens, was a pre-season rugby league sevens tournament made up over the years primarily of New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL), Australian Rugby League (ARL) and mostly recently National Rugby League (NRL) teams, along with teams representing NSW Country and nations including Tonga, France, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Russia, Fiji, the US and England.\nWhen the National Rugby League was formed in Australasia in 1998 the World Sevens competition was dropped, but it returned in 2003 when Parramatta successfully defended their title from the last time in 1997.\nFormat and rules.\nThe World Sevens format saw entrants divided into eight pools. The top team in each pool progressed into the quarter-finals.\nUntil 2004, second placed teams from each pool would play each other, as would third placed teams. In 2004, when the competition was known as the \"Cougar Bourbon World Sevens\", this format changed, when only the top placed teams played for the major prize.\nEach match played up to and including the semi-finals had two 7-minute halves with extra time played in the event of tie at the end normal time. The final is longer with two 10-minute halves. In 2004, the tackle limit was reduced from 6 to 4.\nHistory.\nThe World Sevens were held at Parramatta Stadium from 1988 to 1991 and Sydney Football Stadium from 1992 to 2004, with the 1995 tournament's opening day being held at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, and the 1996 tournament's opening day taking place at Parramatta Stadium.\nWigan played in the rain-soaked 1992 World Sevens as they opted to fulfil a promise made by their club's chairman, Maurice Lindsay, to appear despite having commitments in the Challenge Cup. After a win in extra time against Cronulla in the opening match hinted at a strong challenge for the title, a poor performance and loss to the Gold Coast Seagulls saw Wigan's challenge seeming likely to fail. The group stage ended with each team in Wigan's group having won one game, but by virtue of \"most tries scored\" they proceeded to the quarter-finals, despite their chances being largely written off. John Monie, the Wigan coach, told his team, \"We've copped a bit of a bagging in the press today saying we're a typical Pommy side and can't tackle ... and the other thing was that they say 'Oh, Penrith's got the easy draw again because they're playing Wigan'\". In the event, Wigan breezed past Penrith 22–8 in the quarter-final and a Denis Betts try in extra time won the semi-final against Manly. Scorer of six tries before the game, Martin Offiah, the Man of the Series, scored four more in the final played against the Brisbane Broncos (the former club of Wigan's new recruit for 1992, Gene Miles), a game Wigan won 18–6.\n1993 saw Wigan not defending their title. Eastern Suburbs defeated Manly Warringah in the final. The Sea Eagles would go on to win both the 1994 and 1995 World Sevens defeating St George and Fiji respectively. Manly's wins actually could have been potentially embarrassing for the tournaments organisers. During these two years the Sevens major sponsor was Coca-Cola who put up the A$100,000 winners purse. At the time of their wins, Manly Warringah's major sponsor was Coke's major rival Pepsi.\nIn 1995, Canada became the first side in World Sevens not to score a point throughout the tournament. The Canadians lost to the Newcastle Knights 52–0 and New Zealand 56–0 in the group stage and to Western Suburbs 48–0 in the plate quarter-finals.\nNathan Hindmarsh was deemed Player of the Series as Parramatta stormed to victory in the 2003 competition. Parramatta beat Canberra in their quarter-final, followed by South Sydney in the semi-final. The final pitted England against a Parramatta side that flew to the lead, scoring five tries before half-time to England's one by Keith Senior. The match finished 42–18. The Plate final was won by the Bulldogs who beat New Zealand and the Bowl final was won by North Queensland who beat Fiji.\nIn 2004, the Wests Tigers took the title, winning 18–7 in the final and ending Parramatta's campaign for a third consecutive title. The Wests Tigers' first title as a merged entity gained them A$100,000 in prize money.\n2004: tournament ceases.\nThe lead-up to the 2004 tournament was disrupted by setbacks for the World Sevens. Some NRL clubs withdrew their top players. Steve Folkes, the Bulldogs coach, attacked the event, arguing that it put his players at risk of injury. Other clubs including the Wests Tigers, Parramatta and Manly continued to support the event by fielding strong sides. ARL chairman Colin Love threatened to change the rules to make it compulsory for all clubs to have their top players participate, and stated that any club which refused to do so could be hit with sanctions that involved them not being invited to participate in the following year's competition.\nThe competition's standing was further weakened by news that Channel 9 would only be broadcasting a limited highlights television programme in areas of New South Wales and Queensland, despite having rights to show the event live.\nUltimately, the fact that the 2004 tournament drew 15,000 fewer fans than the previous year led to the tournament being axed.\nThe future.\nIn the years since the tournament was indefinitely suspended in 2004 other tournaments have provided continued international rugby league sevens events.\nActor Russell Crowe hosts the Orara Valley Axemen Sevens Tournament at Coffs Harbour on the New South Wales north coast. This tournament is participated in by teams representing countries of the world, local clubs and a few clubs from Brisbane. In 2005 the Souths Logan Magpies from the Queensland Wizard Cup and the Gold Coast Titans, who entered the NRL in 2007, were two well known clubs that participated.\nIn 2008, it emerged that the World Sevens could make a comeback by 2010. The competitors in the revived competition would be international sides rather than the assorted mix of clubs, nations and other representative sides of the past. A competition between only national sides is considered to have value in growing rugby league nations to a higher skill level and the exposure to new audiences globally of the sport via broadcast coverage.\nThe other motivation for this potential change was voiced by Tas Baiteri, International Development Officer for the Rugby League International Federation, who stated: \"We would be looking at just having nations in the World Sevens. By having an Australian team means that it will not interrupt preparations for any NRL clubs\". One reason for the hiatus following the 2004 event was reluctance of NRL clubs to use so many of their first team players.\nWith proposed entrants in future competitions being national teams, the need for the tournament to be hosted in Sydney each year has been debated with some arguing that the World Sevens should be used as a tool to spread the sport further by hosting in a succession of locations globally.\nAccording to Rugby League Review, there is a possibility that the Sevens derivative could be replaced by a nines tournament should there be enough support from the rugby league authorities entering teams.\nIn 2014, the National Rugby League held the first edition of the Auckland Nines, contested between National Rugby League teams only."

        "title": "Brazil men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Brazil national basketball team () is governed by the Brazilian Basketball Confederation (), abbreviated as CBB.&lt;br&gt; They have been a member of the International Federation of Basketball (FIBA), since 1935. Brazil's national basketball team remains among the most successful in the Americas. It is the only team besides the United States, that has appeared at every FIBA Basketball World Cup, since it was first held in 1950.\nThroughout its history, the Brazilian national team has won two FIBA World Cup gold medals (1959 and 1963), three Summer Olympic Games bronze medals (in 1948, 1960 and 1964), four FIBA AmeriCup gold medals (1984, 1988, 2005 and 2009), and six Pan American Games gold medals (1971, 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2015).\nHistory.\nFirst steps.\nBasketball was initially introduced to Brazil by Professor Augusto Shaw in 1896. In 1912, he began organizing the first state tournament and in 1922 the first national team made its debut at games against Argentina and Uruguay. As in the case of football, South America was initially ahead of the rest of the world and in 1930 held the first edition of the FIBA South American Championship. In that decade, Brazilian basketball was supported by professional football clubs, to include it as a new sports section, although amateur in nature. Later, these clubs became professional and supported the national team with world-class players.\nInitial success despite budget constraints.\nIn the following years, Brazil became a regular at major international competitions. Its basketball squad participated in the first official basketball tournament at the Summer Olympics 1936 in Berlin. In 1939, the first continental championship was held in Rio de Janeiro. In the 40s, basketball was catching on more layers of society and left the elitist stigma. The sport received the ultimate accolade at the 1948 Olympic Games in London. There, against all odds, the team directed by Moacyr Daiuto (1915–1994) managed to achieve the bronze medal. The team recorded six straight wins until it stopped due to the semi-final defeat to France (33–43). In the bronze medal match, Brazil beat Mexico (52–47). They managed to feature ten amateur players. The pre-Olympic Brazil concentration was very poor in resources. After its time-consuming journey to London, the team was astonishment when they saw how the U.S. team practiced: each player with a ball. Brazil only had two for the whole team.\nThe Kanela era.\nOne of the fundamental pillars of Brazilian basketball was the boldness of its coaches. The \"father\" of them all is Togo Renan Soares, \"Kanela\" (so nicknamed for his thick white hair). Working in the shadow of the giant football, Kanela (1906–1992) understood that basketball would add more followers if it could only offer new emotions. He aimed to get the influential media involved, so the game was conceived as a spectacle based on its dynamism and aesthetics. The formula worked. Besides the national team, he coached Flamengo which chained ten titles Rio de Janeiro State Championships in a row (1951–1960). Born in João Pessoa, Paraíba, he also coached football, rowing and water polo. In his youth, he studied at a military college. His lengthy workouts alternated with authoritative teaching tone.\nRise to global dominance.\nThe unstoppable rise of basketball was confirmed at the second World Championship in Rio (1954). The Brazilian team, coached by Kanela, reached the final undefeated and proclaimed runner-up after losing to the global hegemonic basketball power from the U.S. The Brazilian team was equipped with experienced players who won the bronze medal at the 1948 London Summer Olympic Games, and supported through the arrival of two young men. These young men were Amaury Pasos and Wlamir Marques, 18 and 17 years old, respectively. The bet of the visionary Kanela would give tremendous returns in later years.\nIronically, the Brazilian player leap happened when the team was made up of willing and enthusiastic amateurs. These athletes, who were initiated into the game almost self-taught by imitation of American basketball players who had toured the country. The hard work of Kanela consisted of giving these players basic fundamentals and then lecture them on team concepts. Amaury and Wlamir were his most successful students. Especially their jump shots dazzled at the 54 FIBA World Cup. \"Their scoring was smart and technically perfect.\" said the Brazilian journalist Fábio Balassiano.\nBefore playing basketball, Amaury, who measured 1.91 m (6'3\"), had practiced swimming, athletics and volleyball, which provided him with much athletic ability. Amaury began his career playing as a typical center and power forward, but he later learned to play away from the basket, as play maker. His partner, Wlamir, was another former track runner. Standing at 1.85 m (6'1\"), Wlamir was a great shooter, had great ball handling skills, enormous agility and jumping ability, which also helped him to become an excellent rebounder. Amaury and Wlamir fit well into Kanela's system: fast pace, quick transition, and full confidence in the outside shooters.\nAfter three months of intense preparation at a Marine base, Brazil was presented at the 1959 FIBA World Championship in Chile, as a candidate for the podium. In addition to the U.S. (with a team composed of air force players), a very tough opponent emerged that had been absent in the previous tournament: the Soviet Union, the 1957 EuroBasket champions and 1956 Summer Olympics silver medalists. Kanela had the following starting lineup: Amaury Pasos as play maker, Wlamir Marques and the 33-year old veteran Algodão as wings; and Waldemar Blatskauskas and Edson Bispo at power forward and center. To complete his 7-player rotation, Kanela mostly played his bench players, small forward Jatyr Schall and point guard Pecente Fonseca. There were some minutes also for the young forward Rosa Branca, who was a great ball handler, and who later received an offer to join the Harlem Globetrotters.\nIn the first phase, victories over Canada (69–52) and Mexico (78–50), and defeat against the USSR (64–73). Brazil began the final phase of the tournament by beating Taiwan (94–76) and Bulgaria (62–53). Again, the Brazilians ran into the Soviets (63–66) who imposed their academic style and the size of players like Jānis Krūmiņš (2.18 m). In that clash, Kanela showed his most irascible side by attacking a referee. After a new triumph over Puerto Rico (99–71), a diplomatic carom returned chance to for the title back to Brazil: the USSR, an ally of China, declined to play against Taiwan (at that time Formosa), thus losing the match. Brazil depended on itself and did not fail. Historic victory over the USA (81–67, with 26 points from Wlamir) and, on the last day, an exhibition against Chile (73–49). Brazil reached the top of world basketball. The charismatic Amaury and Wlamir caught up with Pelé and Garrincha.\nRecent years.\nIn 2012, Brazil's top players included: Anderson Varejão, Tiago Splitter, Leandro Barbosa, Nenê, Marcelinho Huertas, Alex Garcia, Guilherme Giovannoni, Marcelinho Machado, and Marquinhos Vieira. Brazil has four NBA players in 2021: Cristiano Felício (Chicago Bulls), Anderson Varejão (Cleaveland Cavaliers), Raulzinho Neto (Washington Wizards) and Didi Louzada (New Orleans

        "text": "Joseph Filmore Frazier (October 6, 1922 – February 15, 2011) was an American outfielder and manager in Major League Baseball.\nHe was signed as an amateur free agent in 1941, but did not play in the major leagues until 1947. After 1947, he was traded on November 20, 1947 with $25,000, Dick Kokos, and Bryan Stephens for Walt Judnich and Bob Muncrief. He spent parts of three seasons in the majors in the 1950s, primarily with the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1956, at the age of 33, he finished his playing career after having played in 217 games.\nHe then had a successful career as a minor league manager, first in the Houston Astros organization, and then, beginning in 1968, in the New York Mets farm system. He managed in Mankato of the Northern League, then Pompano Beach in the Florida State League. He would win the pennant in 1971 with Visalia of the California League. He then went on to win league championships with Memphis and Victoria in the Texas League.\nFrazier, managing the Tidewater Tides in 1975, won the International League championship. The Tides had to win 22 of their last 33 games to finish the regular season in a first-place tie with the Rochester Red Wings. The Tides then won a one-game playoff behind the four-hit pitching of Nino Espinosa. The Tides advanced to win the Governors' Cup by defeating Charleston three games to none, and then Syracuse, three games to one. They then went on to the Junior World Series, losing to Evansville of the American Association four games to one.\nFollowing that successful 1975 season, Frazier was promoted to manager of the parent Mets on October 3, replacing interim manager Roy McMillan. At his introductory press conference, Mets General Manager Joe McDonald said, \"Joe Frazier has consistently proved to us his ability to handle players. Winning is what it's all about, and Joe Frazier is a winner.\" Frazier himself added, \"I'm the type of manager who stresses fundamentals. I think a man should go from first to third on a hit and second to home. I demand hustle. If I have my way, you're going to see a Mets' club next year that will hustle.\"\nFrazier managed the Mets to an 86–76 record in 1976, good for a third-place finish and an improvement over their 82–80 record from the previous season. But Frazier's Mets got off to a poor start in 1977, and following a 15–30 record, Frazier was replaced as Mets manager by Joe Torre, who was an active player on the Mets roster at the time.\nIn 1982 he was the manager of the Louisville Redbirds, the AAA affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. The team finished in second place with a record of 73–62. He was succeeded as manager of the Redbirds by Jim Fregosi.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet, or Ultimate Mets Database"

        "text": "John Good Reilly (October 5, 1858 – May 31, 1937), nicknamed \"Long John\", was an American first baseman in Major League Baseball who played for the Cincinnati Stars (1880) and the Cincinnati Red Stockings/Reds (–). In 1888, he hit 13 home runs with 103 RBI and a .321 batting average. During and after his baseball career, Reilly was a commercial artist for the Strobridge Lithographing Company.\nEarly life.\nBorn in 1858, Reilly was the son of a Civil War gunboat captain for the Union named Frank A. Reilly. When his father was killed at the Battle of Fort Donelson in 1862, Reilly was sent by his mother to live with some of her relatives in Illinois, and he spent the next several years there.\nWhen he was about 14 years old, Reilly returned to his native Cincinnati to take a course in lithography at a design school. He apprenticed at the Strobridge Lithographing Company, and he played his first organized baseball for the company team. Reilly showed early ability as a catcher, but by 1877, having become a professional artist with Strobridge, he began playing in the infield to avoid hand injuries that might threaten his lithography career.\nCareer.\nReilly played one season for the Cincinnati Stars in the National League (NL) and was out of the major leagues for the following two seasons, playing for the New York Metropolitans in 1882 when it was an independent team. From 1883 to 1891, he played for the Cincinnati Red Stockings/Reds of the American Association and the NL.\nHe hit 69 home runs and batted .289 during his ten-year career. Reilly was among the top ten of the all-time home run list from 1888 to 1892. His career highs in a season were 135 games played, 553 at bats, 112 runs, 170 hits, 35 doubles, 26 triples, 13 home runs, 103 RBI, 82 stolen bases, 34 walks, a .339 average, a .366 on-base percentage, a .551 slugging percentage, and 264 total bases.\nHe was also the first player to hit for the cycle on three occasions during his career, doing so twice in the American Association and once in the National League. He accomplished the feat twice in 1883 — the first on September 12 and the second exactly one week later on September 19, setting the major league record for the shortest time between cycles. His third cycle came on August 6, 1890.\nLater life.\nRen Mulford, a writer for \"Sporting Life\", reported in 1914 that Reilly was \"a rare old bachelor devoted to his art, and seldom goes to the ball yard where he once reigned a ruling favorite.\" Reilly remained employed with Strobridge until 1932, according to at least one source.\nReilly died in 1937. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame on June 23, 2012.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

It was Czechoslovakia's first medal at the event. The United States' Brad Gilbert and Sweden's Stefan Edberg won the bronze medals. It was Sweden's first men's singles Olympic medal.\nThe tournament was held at the Seoul Olympic Park Tennis Center in Seoul, South Korea. Tennis was officially re-introduced as an official sport in the 1988 Summer Olympics, after being held as a demonstration sport in the 1968 Olympic Games and 1984 Olympic Games. It was discontinued from being an official sport after the 1924 Olympic Games before its re-introduction. There were 64 competitors from 32 nations. Nations were limited to three players each (down from four before tennis's Olympic hiatus).\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth (medal) appearance of the men's singles tennis event. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. Demonstration events were held in 1968 and 1984.\nNumber one seed and the favorite was Stefan Edberg of Sweden, the winner of the 1984 demonstration event as well as the reigning Wimbledon champion.\nBermuda, Brazil, West Germany, Haiti, Israel, the Ivory Coast, New Zealand, Nigeria, Paraguay, Poland, South Korea, the Soviet Union, and Zimbabwe each made their debut in the event. France made its seventh appearance, most among all nations, having missed only the 1904 event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament. Unlike previous Olympic tournaments, no bronze-medal match was held. All matches were best-of-five sets. The 12-point tie-breaker, common by 1988, was used in the Olympics for the first time."

        "text": "The Malaysia national cricket team represents the country of Malaysia in international cricket matches. The team is organised by the Malaysian Cricket Association which has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1967.\nDuring the British colonial period, the Federated Malay States, Straits Settlements and Malaya cricket teams played regularly in Interport matches and against other visiting teams. Following Malaysian independence, the team's most frequent opponent has been Singapore in the Saudara Cup and Stan Nagaiah Trophy. Malaysia made its debut in ICC tournaments in the inaugural 1979 ICC Trophy, making regular appearances until ICC pathways were altered in the 2000s and hosting the 1997 ICC Trophy. Malaysia has regularly hosted Asian Cricket Council (ACC) tournaments and finished runner-up in the 1998 ACC Trophy. In the World Cricket League the team reached as high as Division Three, subsequently being placed in the ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League.\nHistory.\nEarly days.\nCricket has been played in what is now Malaysia since the 1880s. Various teams represented Malaya, the Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements, formed in 1884 by the British, Royal Selangor Club (RSC) is the first cricket club founded in present Malaysia (locally called a padang also in Singapore e.g. Padang, Singapore). The Singapore Cricket Club, a former affiliate of the Malayan Cricket Association, is the oldest cricket club in the region (founded in 1852).\nThe first recorded match was between Selangor and Malacca in 1887. The Selangor-Singapore series was played in 1891.\nCricket in Johor was played in the early 20th century, but the first recorded cricketing event is the visit of the Australian team led by C. G. Macartney in 1927. Penang is another historical cricket venue in Malaysia where cricket has been played from British times. The Penang Sports Club was established in the early 1900s.\nOn 6 June 1927 Malaya beat Australia by 39 runs to make history. Lall Singh became the first Malaysia-born Test player (played for India in their debut Test at Lord's against England in 1932).\nAfter World War II, cricket grew in popularity, leading to the founding of the Malayan Cricket Association (MCA) in 1948. Regional cricket associations like Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore joined and in 1963, the MCA was renamed the Malaysian Cricket Association. In 1965, the independence of Singapore led its association to leave the MCA.\nThe first team to represent Malaysia was in 1970, three years after the MCA became an ICC associate member, when it played an MCC side captained by Tony Lewis in a two-day match, losing by 230 runs. The same year, Malaysia played the first Saudara Cup match against Singapore, drawing the three-day match.\nThe Saudara Cup match continued annually, and in 1979 Malaysia participated in the first ICC Trophy, failing to progress beyond the first round, a performance they repeated in 1982 and 1986. They reached the plate competition in 1990 and 1994.\n1990s.\nThe first Stan Nagaiah Trophy was played in Singapore in February 1995 with Singapore beating Malaysia 2–1 in the three-match one-day series. After winning the Stan Nagaiah Trophy and drawing the Saudara Cup match in 1996 Malaysia hosted the first ACC Trophy tournament, finishing third in their first round group.\nMalaysia began to host major international tournaments in 1997, starting with the 1997 ICC Trophy in which Malaysia finished 16th after losing a play-off to Namibia. They played one season in Pakistani domestic cricket in 1998, losing all four of their preliminary round matches. Cricket made its first and, to date, only appearance in the Commonwealth Games later that year, with Malaysia hosting that year's games. The cricket tournament saw Malaysia participate as hosts though they lost all three of their first round matches. They reached the final of the ACC Trophy that same year, losing to Bangladesh.\n21st century.\n2000–2017.\nIn 2000, Malaysia reached the semi-final of the ACC Trophy before losing to hosts the UAE. They failed to progress beyond the first round of the 2001 ICC Trophy and lost to Nepal in the semi-finals of the 2002 ACC Trophy.\nMalaysia played their first first-class matches in 2004 as part of that year's ICC Intercontinental Cup. They lost to both Nepal and the UAE and failed to reach the semi-final stage of the tournament. Malaysia hosted the ACC Trophy in 2004, which was the first stage of qualification for the 2005 ICC Trophy and the 2007 World Cup, finishing joint seventh with Bhutan. They finished last in the ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament in 2004, thus failing to qualify for the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup. They played in the tournament again in 2005, this time finishing third.\nIn 2006, Malaysia competed in the ACC Premier League, finishing fourth. They again hosted the ACC Trophy that year, again finishing seventh after beating Qatar in a play-off.\nMalaysia have played in the ACC Twenty20 Cup thrice. They did not win a match in 2007 but finished seventh in 2009 after winning 3 Group B matches and a positional playoff against Saudi Arabia.\nIn 2011, they finished sixth after winning 4 Group A matches and losing a positional playoff against the UAE.\nIn August 2017, Malaysia won two medals in cricket at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. They won the gold medal in the 50-over tournament and the silver medal in the 20-over tournament.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Malaysia and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status. \nMalaysia played their first T20I on 24 June against Thailand during the 2019 Malaysia Tri-Nation Series.

It pitted the winners of the Eastern Sprints, the Pac-10s, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) National Championship and other crews invited at-large. The invited crews usually included Eastern Sprints and Pac-10 medalists, and Harvard and Yale. The IRA National Championship has been considered the national collegiate rowing championship since it was first held in 1895.\nThe Cincinnati Regatta was founded as a way to popularize rowing in the midwest. After the creation of the NCAA Rowing Championship for women in 1997, the Cincinnati Regatta dissolved. Seven years later, Harvard and Yale returned to the IRA, the longstanding collegiate rowing championship regatta for men and, later, for lightweight women. The NCAA championship now holds this status for openweight women.\nThe winners of the Cincinnati Regatta were as follows:"

Eastern Province played first-class cricket from 1893–94 to 2004–05, when the team was merged with neighbouring team Border to form the entirely professional franchise the Warriors.\nFrom 2004–05 the former provincial teams, such as Eastern Province, were allocated two CSA Provincial Competitions that they could participate in: the CSA 3-Day Cup and the CSA One-Day Cup. Although given first-class status, these competitions were to be only semi-professional and no longer represented the top level of domestic cricket in South Africa.\nIn 2020, domestic cricket in South Africa was restructured and the six former franchise teams were dropped. In its place was a return to the more traditional two-division league format, with a total of fifteen professional teams competing, and the semi-professional provincial cricket being subsumed (effectively becoming Division 2) . These teams are more structured around a province when compared to the previous broad franchises.

        "text": "Isabel Clark Ribeiro, a snowboarder, carried the flag at the opening ceremonies. Clark is also the Brazilian athlete who achieved the best result in the Brazilian delegation, making it to the quarterfinals in women's snowboard cross, finishing ninth overall.\nThe substitute on the Bobsleigh team, Claudinei Quirino, was a silver medalist in the Summer Olympic Games, where he finished second in Sydney with the Brazilian 4 × 100 m relay team. By participating in the Winter Games, Quirino became the second Brazilian man to have participated in both the Summer and Winter Games (the first was Matheus Inocêncio, who participated in Salt Lake 2002 and Athens 2004). On the women's side, Jaqueline Mourão became the first woman to have achieved this feat: she had participated in the mountain bike competition of Athens 2004 and in Turin 2006, she took part in the 10 km classical.\nOn 22 February, the Brazilian Olympic Committee announced, in Rio de Janeiro, that alpine skier Nikolai Hentsch was to be the flag bearer for Brazil at the closing ceremonies of the Winter Games. For the closing ceremony, all the nine athletes participating in the Games remained in Turin. The Brazilians were seated by the organization in a privileged spot: in the first row immediately behind the podium where IOC president Jacques Rogge and the president of the Turin 2006 Organizing Committee, Valentino Castellani, delivered their speeches.\nAlpine skiing.\nNikolai Hentsch competed in four of the five alpine skiing events, and had the Brazilian alpine team's best finish, placing 30th in the giant slalom.\nNote: In the men's combined, run 1 is the downhill, and runs 2 and 3 are the slalom. In the women's combined, run 1 and 2 are the slalom, and run 3 the downhill.\nBobsleigh.\nOn 13 February, the Brazilian Olympic Committee announced that Armando dos Santos' preventive antidoping test, which had been done in Brazil on 4 January, was positive for the forbidden substance nandrolone. Santos was ejected from the team, being replaced by former sprinter Claudinei Quirino, the team's substitute athlete.\nOn 18 February, the Australian Olympic Committee filed a request with the International Olympic Committee, claiming that the qualification of the Brazilian team to the Olympics was invalid, and thus the Brazilian team should not be allowed to compete. The claim of the Australian Committee revolved around the circumstances of the qualification: the Brazilians earned their spot in the Games by winning the 2006 Challenge Cup, in late January, which awarded two spots in the Olympics.\nThat event took place two weeks after Armando dos Santos' anti-doping test, which turned out to be positive, had been performed, although the result was only divulged on 13 February. In that event, New Zealand came in second, which earned them a spot in the Olympics as well, and the Australian team was third. Thus, the Australians claimed that the Brazilian result should have been canceled, given the previous – although then unknown — positive doping result of an athlete of the Brazilian team. This would have removed the Brazilian team from the Olympics and awarded Australia the spot, as the second valid result from the qualification event (New Zealand would have moved to first place). On 19 February, the IOC ruled in favor of the Brazilians, rejecting the motion from the Australian Olympic Committee.\nRun 1 – In their first run, the Brazilians' sleigh turned over coming out of Curve 14, after an error by pilot Ricardo Raschini, causing the team to finish with an exceedingly slow time. After an initial scare, the Brazilians got out of the sleigh and decided to continue in competition. No one was hurt and their sleigh was not damaged, but they had to borrow a helmet from the German team, since one of the Brazilians' was badly damaged during the accident.\nRun 3 – In what looked like a replay of Heat 1, the Brazilians once again turned over in Curve 14. Once again, pilot Ricardo Raschini miscalculated his exit of this curve, causing the sleigh to turn over. This time, the accident was slightly more violent than the original one: the sleigh was completely upside down for a few seconds, and pusher Claudinei Quirino got out of the sleigh complaining of pain in one of his arms, being taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital for detailed exams. He was released soon after, having been only medicated for the pain.\nThe event finished any faint possibility that the Brazilians could qualify for Heat 4, of which only the top 20 sleighs would participate. In an interview soon afterwards, Raschini took full responsibility for both the accidents, asking for \"the forgiveness of his team and the Brazilian people\", although reporting that insufficient training at the Olympic track was the main cause of his inability to master Curve 14. His teammates and Brazilian officials, however, were quick to show Raschini their full support, saying that no one is to blame for a competition mishappening and that they are already looking forward to Vancouver 2010. Edson Bindilatti, the brakeman, closed his statement vowing that \"the Frozen Bananas\" shall return \"in style\".\nOn another aspect of the last participation of the Brazilian team, they were able to secure a replacement helmet for second man Márcio Silva (he had had to borrow a German helmet the day before, for lack of a spare unit), having had it flown in from the United States, where the manufacturer is located.\nSnowboarding.\nIsabel Clark Ribeiro qualified for the knockout rounds in the women's snowboard cross with the 5th fastest time, but a third-place finish in her quarterfinal left her battling for 9th place. In that classification race, she was forced to race from behind after a poor start, but benefited from an accident involving all the other three participants in her race, to end up in 9th overall."

Although the inaugural edition consisted of just the doubles format, the singles were introduced from the second edition onward.

        "title": "Nottingham Outlaws (rugby league team)",
        "text": "Nottingham Outlaws are a rugby league club from the city of Nottingham, England. They were founded in 1999 and their first team plays in the Premier Division of the Yorkshire Men's League. They have a junior section and in 2006 launched an academy team. They play their home matches at their own ground at Lenton Lane Nottingham NG7. They are also known as the 'hooded men'.\nHistory of rugby league in Nottingham.\nThe first Nottingham rugby league club took part in the Southern Amateur Rugby League some time between 1965 and 1973. The club is believed to have been a university team.\nIn the late 1980s an attempt was made to introduce semi-professional rugby league into Nottingham with the creation of Nottingham City, who replaced another Nottinghamshire team, the Mansfield Marksman. In 1992-1993 they finished bottom of Division 3 of the Rugby League and were demoted to the National Conference League. They achieved the dubious honour of being the recipient of one of the widest margins of defeat in rugby league history when they lost 138–0 to Barrow in 1994. Official records\nNottingham Foresters were the first community team to form in Nottingham. They were based at The Forester pub in the city centre; the landlord was one of the founder members. When the landlord left the following year the club relocated to The Crusader pub near the Nottingham Polytechnic playing fields, where the club played, and the club changed its name to Nottingham Crusaders in 1986. The club joined the now defunct Mansfield and Nottingham Amateur Rugby League Association, which later became the EMARLA (East Midlands Amateur Rugby League Association) league, and played there until 1995. Nottingham Crusaders then played in the Yorkshire League from 1995/96 to 1998/99 but kept an A-team in the EMARLA.\nHistory of the Outlaws.\n\"Nottingham Outlaws RLFC\" were founded in 1998 when a number of players from the Nottingham Crusaders Yorkshire League outfit decided to explore the possibility of playing in the emerging Rugby League Conference. The newly founded Nottingham club took the name \"Outlaws\" in deference to the follows of local legend Robin Hood. The club colours were taken from the local Nottingham Trent University. The club joined the Northern Division of the Rugby League Conference that same year. In its early years the club were based in Wilford village at Nottingham Moderns RUFC.\nThey moved to the newly created Midlands Division in 2001. As the Conference expanded further, new Divisions were added and in 2003, the Outlaws joined the East Midlands Division.\nAfter twice winning the East Midlands division in both 2003 and 2004 they accepted an invitation to join the new Central Premier Division in 2005. This was a step-up in standard and included tough games against rugby league heartland sides in Hull Phoenix, Leeds Akkies, Bolton-le-Moors and Dewsbury Celtic.\nIn 2006 the club competed in the Midlands Premier division, finishing as league leaders and then winning the Midlands Grand Final against Coventry Bears. This set up a national semi-final against East Lancashire Lions, which they lost by 28–12. The academy team reached the Merit League final but were beaten 42-18 by the South Humber Rabbitohs.\nThe club again ran two teams in 2007, competing in the same competitions. The first team were beaten in the RLC Premier Midlands final 18-30 by Coventry Bears after finishing second in the league and the second team lost 26–32 to East Riding in the MML Shield Final. Three junior teams and a ladies team also competed for the club in 2007.\nIn 2008, the club re-located from Moderns RUFC to The Bay, training ground of Nottingham RUFC; Leeds Akkies coach Martin Crick was recruited as Head Coach and a host of new signings from the powerful Loughborough University Rugby League team. The club achieved success, taking the Midlands Premier crown from Coventry Bears in a 44–0 win before beating Carlisle Centurions in the semi-final and then West London Sharks in the final to win the Harry Jepson Trophy for the first time in the club's history. The reserve grade side also won the RL Merit League Shield. The club also fielded a women's team and juniors at under-16, under-14, under-12 and under-11. the club applied for, and were granted, entrance to the RLC National Division in 2009.\nThey made their debut in the Challenge Cup in January 2009 but lost narrowly to Loughborough University.\nIn 2012 the heartlands winter leagues switched to summer and this led to a realignment of the community game. Outlaws were one of the few non-heartland teams to maintain a position at national level, operating in the 3rd tier of the national pyramid in the National Conference League Division 3. In 2013 the Outlaws switched to play in the newly formed Conference League South. The Outlaws reached the Grand Final in the competition's inaugural season, losing out 32–24 to Sheffield-Hallam Eagles. In 2014, they were prevented from reaching a second consecutive Grand Final after a semi-final defeat away to eventual champions Valley Cougars.\nIn 2014, the Outlaws launched Project 30 - a scheme to raise money to help secure a permanent home for the club and the sport of rugby league in the city of Nottingham.\nIn 2015 they lifted the Conference league south championship by beating defending champions Valley Cougars 39–12 at Bath.\nIn 2018, the club finally secured a permanent home at Lenton Lane, the former site of the now-defunct Greenwood Meadows F.C.\nWomen's team.\nIn 2012, the women's team took part in the inaugural Women's Challenge Cup in which they reached the quarter-finals before losing to Featherstone Rovers.\nJuniors.\nNottingham Outlaws' junior teams take part in the Midlands Junior League.\nIn 2009, Outlaws under-16s were crowned Midlands Champions, leading to a number of players being selected to represent the East Midlands and later the full Midlands teams. Numerous players have since gone on the achieve this at various age groups from under-12 to under-18.\n2012 saw five Outlaws juniors being selected to tour Serbia with the Midlands under-18s.\nThe successful development of players at the club has also seen players involved with professional clubs, Sheffield Eagles, Wakefield Trinity Wildcats and Castleford Tigers."

        "text": "Eugene Lytton Scott (December 28, 1937 – March 20, 2006) was an American tennis player, tournament director, author, and publisher. His active tennis career lasted from the 1950s to mid-1970s. Scott's highest U.S. ranking as an amateur was No. 4 in 1963, and he reached as high as World No. 7 in 1967.\nEarly years.\nScott was the grandson of Dr. Eugene C. Sullivan, one of the inventors of Pyrex and chair and president of Corning Glass Works. He graduated with a BA in history from Yale University in 1960, where he was a member of Skull and Bones and lettered in tennis, ice hockey, soccer, and lacrosse. He earned a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1964.\nTennis career.\nScott's highest U.S. ranking as an amateur was No. 4 in 1963, and he reached as high as World No. 7 in 1967. At the time, he was a member of the United States Davis Cup team, and was both teammate and roommate of Arthur Ashe. They remained friends, and with Charlie Pasarell and Sheridan Snyder, founded the National Junior Tennis League in 1969. He founded the magazine \"Tennis Week\" in May 1974.\nIn 1963, he won the singles title at the Eastern Grass Court Championships in South Orange after a straight-sets victory in the final against compatriot Marty Riessen. \nScott made it to the quarterfinals of the French Championships in 1964, defeating Antonio Palafox and Marty Mulligan in a close five sets, but losing the quarterfinal to eventual finalist Pierre Darmon. Scott won the Southampton Invitation (Long Island) at the Meadow Club, defeating Michael Sangster, Dennis Ralston, and Charlie Pasarell in long close matches.\nIn 1967 Scott won the Eastern Indoor Championships at Waldwick, N.J. defeating Frank Froehling in the final in three straight sets. That same season he won the Long Island Championships at Great Neck, N.Y. defeating Dick Stockton and Peter Fishbach. At the 1967 U.S. National Championships Scott defeated Tom Gorman, Ron Holmberg in a close five sets, and Owen Davidson in the quarterfinal. In the semifinal he lost to the eventual champion John Newcombe.\nLater, Scott remained among the best players in the world in his age group. He won the USTA Men's 65 Clay Court Championships held at New Orleans Lawn Tennis Club in 2002. He won the USTA Men's 65 Grass Court Championships in September 2004 and the International Tennis Federation's Men's Super-Seniors World Individual Championships in the 65 division a week later. Scott also played real tennis at New York City's Racquet and Tennis Club.\nScott grew up in St. James, New York and played varsity hockey, track, soccer, and tennis at St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts.\nScott competed in the Davis Cup in 1963 and 1965, and his 1963 singles and doubles victories helped the United States win the Cup that year. \nAlthough Scott remained active as a court tennis player, which he played at The Racquet Club on Park Avenue, he became one of the major figures in American tennis through his publication \"Tennis Week\", which he founded, published, and edited. His editorials—perceptive, authoritative and sometimes whimsical—were considered a must read for all the game's insiders as well as a tennis public who became educated about the game as a result of reading them.\nHe was a mentor on and off court to Vitas Gerulaitis. Scott ran tournaments in New York and New Jersey for many years before taking over as tournament director of the ATP Masters at Madison Square Garden. In 1990, he was asked to start up the Kremlin Cup, an ATP event in Moscow, with a remit to produce with $1 million in sponsorship in nine months. With some assistance from the Kremlin, when Boris Yeltsin became president of Russia, Scott came up with Bayer as his first title sponsor and the tournament, played inside the vast Olympic Arena, immediately drew some of the largest crowds on the ATP tour.\nDeath and legacy.\nScott died of amyloidosis at the age of 68 and was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame (ITHF) in 2008 in the \"contributor\" category. Since 2006, the ITHF annually presents the Eugene L. Scott Award to an individual who \"embodies Scott's commitment to communicating honestly and critically about the game, and who has had a significant impact on the tennis world.\""

He was the Director of Rugby at Widnes Vikings of the Super League after being the club's head coach prior to promotion from the Championship. Cullen previously coached the Warrington Wolves as well as England. He also provides commentary for Sky Sports rugby league coverage.\nPlaying career.\nPaul Cullen joined Warrington in 1980 from local Amateur side Crosfields ARLFC , where he stayed for 17 years. He played mainly in the position at the club. Nicknamed \"psycho\", despite limited attacking flair, Cullen had an aggressive defence which made him a crowd favourite.\nCounty Cup Final appearances.\nPaul Cullen played in Warrington's 16–0 victory over St. Helens in the 1982 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1982–83 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 23 October 1982, and played right- in the 8–34 defeat by Wigan in the 1985 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1985–86 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens, on Sunday 13 October 1985.\nJohn Player Special/Regal Trophy Final appearances.\nPaul Cullen played right- in Warrington's 4–18 defeat by Wigan in the 1986–87 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1986–87 season at Burnden Park, Bolton on Saturday 10 January 1987, played in the 12–2 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1990–91 Regal Trophy Final during the 1990–91 season at Headingley, Leeds on Saturday 12 January 1991, and played left- in the 10–40 defeat by Wigan in the 1994–95 Regal Trophy Final during the 1994–95 season at Alfred McAlpine Stadium, Huddersfield on Saturday 28 January 1995.\nCoaching career.\nAfter ending his playing career in 1996, Cullen moved into coaching.

It was this success which bought Cullen an extended rein at the helm due to the loyalty of the fans despite falling short of expectations with the playing roster he had.\nIn 2006 he was appointed the Head Coach of England 'A' ahead of the Federation Shield tournament in the autumn.\nOn 26 May 2008, following a run of poor form that culminated in a 36–28 to struggling Castleford, Cullen resigned from his position as Head Coach amid heavy pressure from fans and pundits. He was the longest-serving coach in the league at the time of his departure, having spent six years in charge of the Wires and guided them to a Challenge Cup semi-final and a play-off victory.\nHis replacement at Warrington was James Lowes, who was later replaced by Tony Smith.\nWidnes unveiled Paul Cullen as Head Coach on a two-year deal on 9 March 2009. Speaking on his appointment he said \"I'm really excited to be joining Widnes. The plan is simple, we need to get Widnes into Super League where we belong\".

Sánchez Vicario became the second woman to win multiple Olympic tennis medals in singles (following Steffi Graf in 1988 and 1992); Fernández would have done so as well, but the rules had been changed since the last Games to add a bronze medal playoff match.\nThe tournament was held from 23 July to 2 August at the Stone Mountain Tennis Center, in Atlanta, Georgia of the United States of America.

A bronze-medal match was held, unlike the previous two Games. Matches were best-of-three sets. The 12-point tie-breaker continued be used in any set, except the third, that reached 6–6."

        "text": "Rugby league in the Netherlands is a minor sport played by five clubs.\nHistory.\nIntroduction.\nThe first steps of introducing Rugby League in the Netherlands were made in 1989 during the preparation for and the participation at the Tertiary Student Rugby League World Cup. The Dutch, along with the Irish, were very much the fledglings of that competition. The Netherlands Amateur Rugby League itself was in that year less than a year old, having been established only in November 1988 with Hans Modderman as its first president.\nA good deal had however been achieved in that short period and the Dutch were particularly grateful to the intensive coaching session's conducted by Tas Baitieri, Ian Harris, Phil Larder and Fred Lindop. The Dutch students were mainly first division rugby union players but keen and enthusiastic, if a little apprehensive, about their participation in the World Cup. As part of their build up to the tournament, they played against the French Army at the Royal Military Academy in Breda, which was the first rugby league match in the Netherlands and must be one of the few matches in those days played between two non-English speaking nations. In this inaugural match, Toon Boersma scored both tries for the Netherlands.\nThe team was made up of\nThe World Cup 1989 was held in York and including eight teams: the four Home Nations plus Australia, New Zealand, France and of course the Netherlands. In the group games the Dutch were defeated by Wales (10-48), France (12-42) and New Zealand (16-50). The Cup seventh vs eight final was left in which Scotland defeated the Netherlands (10-20).\nAfter that tournament there was a follow-up in November 1989 in Toulouse (France). The Dutch were invited to play a match against Toulouse Olympique which ended in an admirable draw (20-20).\nNNRLB era.\nUnfortunately it took till 2003 before the next game took place when two Netherlands sides hosted two national touring sides from Scotland. The first 13-a-side club game of Rugby League was also played in 2003 with Den Haag side Te Werve hosting Essex Eels. Also during 2003 a South Holland representative side played in the York 9's.\nTheir first entry into major competitions was in 2005 when the Netherlands entered the Rugby League European Nations Cup for the first time, losing to Georgia 34–14 but beating Serbia 26–10.\nThe Netherlands competed in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup qualifying competition alongside Russia, Georgia and Serbia. The team lost to Russia and Georgia before beating Serbia to come third in the group. The third-place finish was not enough to see the Netherlands progress in the competition.\nNRLB era.\nThe Netherlands Rugby League Bond (NRLB) was formed in 2009 and hosted rugby league nines tournaments periodically. The NRLB became a Rugby League European Federation observer member in February 2012.

        "text": "The Benson &amp; Hedges World Championship of Cricket was part of the celebrations commemorating the 150th anniversary of European settlement in the Australian state of Victoria. It was a One Day International (ODI) tournament held in Australia from 17 February to 10 March 1985. India defeated Pakistan in the final by 8 wickets.\nAll of the then seven Test match playing teams participated with matches played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Sydney Cricket Ground. The tournament saw the first matches played under lights at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. India were the reigning World Cup holders, having defeated West Indies in the 1983 Cricket World Cup Final, but the bookmakers installed West Indies as favourites. India were ultimately undefeated at the tournament, with Ravi Shastri named as the player of the tournament.\nTournament format.\nEach team was required to name a 14-player squad for the tournament. Matches were played with coloured clothing, white balls, fielding restrictions and innings limited to 50 overs.\nThe seven teams were split into two qualifying groups. Each played a round-robin with two points awarded for a win and one point for a draw or tie. Teams on equal points were separated by run rate.\nCross-over semi finals were then played with the winner from each group playing the runner-up from the other group. The losers played in the Plate Winners Final while the winners contested the Final.\nPlaying squads.\nAustralia.\nAllan Border (captain), Terry Alderman, Peter Faulkner, Rodney Hogg, Kim Hughes, Dean Jones, Robbie Kerr, Geoff Lawson, Rod McCurdy, Craig McDermott, Simon O'Donnell, Wayne B. Phillips, Kepler Wessels, Graeme Wood.\nEngland.\nDavid Gower (captain), Jonathan Agnew, Norman Cowans, Chris Cowdrey, Paul Downton, Phil Edmonds, Richard Ellison, Neil Foster, Graeme Fowler, Mike Gatting, Allan Lamb, Vic Marks, Martyn Moxon, Tim Robinson.\nIndia.\nSunil Gavaskar (captain), Mohinder Amarnath, Mohammad Azharuddin, Roger Binny, Kapil Dev, Madan Lal, Ashok Malhotra, Manoj Prabhakar, Chetan Sharma, Ravi Shastri, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Dilip Vengsarkar, Sadanand Viswanath.\nNew Zealand.\nGeoff Howarth (captain), John Bracewell, Lance Cairns, Ewen Chatfield, Jeremy Coney, Jeff Crowe, Martin Crowe, Richard Hadlee, Paul McEwan, John Reid, Ian Smith, Martin Snedden, John Wright.\nPakistan.\nJaved Miandad (captain), Anil Dalpat, Azeem Hafeez, Imran Khan, Mohsin Khan, Mudassar Nazar, Qasim Omar, Rameez Raja, Rashid Khan, Saleem Malik, Tahir Naqqash, Wasim Akram, Wasim Raja, Zaheer Abbas.\nSri Lanka.\nDuleep Mendis (captain), Ashantha de Mel, Somachandra de Silva, Roy Dias, Vinothen John, Uvais Karnain, Ranjan Madugalle, Arjuna Ranatunga, Rumesh Ratnayake, Ravi Ratnayeke, Amal Silva.\nWest Indies.\nClive Lloyd (captain), Winston Davis, Jeff Dujon, Joel Garner, Larry Gomes, Roger Harper, Desmond Haynes, Michael Holding, Gus Logie, Malcolm Marshall, Thelston Payne, Viv Richards, Richie Richardson.\nTournament results.\nGroup A.\nThe tournament began with Australia and England playing the first ever match under lights at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, in front of a crowd of 82,494. Australia won the match by seven wickets, however neither of them would make the semi-finals.\nIndia quickly showed that it was on track to repeat its World Cup success with comfortable wins in each of its group matches, while Pakistan found a new hero in 18-year-old left-arm fast bowler Wasim Akram who took 5 for 21 against Australia.\nGroup B.\nGroup B was slightly farcical with West Indies being comfortably the number one team in world cricket at the time and Sri Lanka being comfortably at the bottom of the list of Test nations.\nThe match between West Indies and New Zealand was rained off which meant that whoever was more successful in beating up on Sri Lanka would top the group. While West Indies easily accounted for Sri Lanka on the scoreboard, fast bowler Rumesh Ratnayake forced both Richie Richardson and Larry Gomes to retire with searing bouncers.\n---- \nKnockout stage.\nSemi-finals.\nAfter the group stages, the expected outcome was that 1983 World Cup finalists India and West Indies would meet again in the final of the World Championship. India held up their end of the bargain by beating New Zealand in the first semi final, however Pakistan produced the one major upset of the tournament to beat West Indies.\nConsolation Final.\nThe third place play-off in this tournament was known as the Plate Winners Final and West Indies were awarded a plate for winning the match. Geoff Howarth was nearing the end of his time as New Zealand captain and New Zealand's upcoming test and ODI tour to West Indies, which commenced later that month, would be his last series for the country. Richard Hadlee began with a spell of 2 for 8 in 6 overs. Viv Richards then hit 51 off 61 deliveries.\n1985 World Championship of Cricket Final.\nIndia got on top early in the final with Kapil Dev reducing Pakistan to 4 for 33 before Javed Miandad and Imran Khan began a rescue act after both had been controversially given not out having edged deliveries to the wicketkeeper. 19-year-old leg spinner Laxman Sivaramakrishnan had been a revelation during the tournament and produced another superb spell in the final. Pakistan's eventual total of 9 for 176 constituted a good recovery. It was the first time, in the tournament, that India had failed to bowl out the opposition. India bagged 49 out of a maximum possible 50 wickets in the tournament.\nIndian openers Ravi Shastri and Krishnamachari Srikkanth each had wonderful tournaments and their century opening stand did most of the work for their strong batting line-up. Each were rewarded at the end of the match with Srikkanth winning the Player of the Match award and Shastri being named the player of the tournament, or as it was known, the Champion of Champions. He was awarded his prize of an Audi 100 motor car, valued at A$35,000 and immediately drove it around the MCG with his entire team sitting either in or on the car. The attendance of 35,296 in the match was the highest in Australia in a match not involving the home side.\nThis was the only instance of the World Championship of Cricket. The Indian team that won the cup was adjudged by Wisden as 'The Indian Team of the Century'."

        "text": "The South African national baseball team is the baseball team which represents the Republic of South Africa in international baseball competitions such as the World Baseball Classic and the Summer Olympics. The governing body of the team is the South African Baseball Union.\nHistory.\nOn 5 July 1931, the first inter-provincial match was played between the only two provincial teams, Transvaal and Natal, in front of a crowd of 4,000 spectators. Included in the match was Springbok cricketer Buster Nupen (Transvaal), Springbok rugby player Bill Payn (Natal) and Springbok footballer George Brunton. Springbok All-Star teams would later be based on the best of several provinces, with Transvaal, Natal, and Western Province dominating.\nIn 1933, the clash between Natal and Transvaal included Nupen and Brunton, as well as Olympic gold medal hurdler Sid Atkinson(Natal), Springbok cricketers Charlie Cawse(Transvaal), Louis Duffus(Transvaal), Eric Dalton(Natal), Syd Curnow(Transvaal) and Springbok cricket captain Jock Cameron (Transvaal). In 1934, the match between Natal and Western Province featured Springbok rugby player Gerry Brand (Western Province).\nThe South African Baseball Federation was founded in 1935, with five provincial associations including Transvaal, Natal (founded 1931), Western Province (founded 1932), Eastern Province (founded 1934), and Border.\nThe first South African All-Star team appears to be formed on 19 November 1938, when an 'All Africa team' made up of the 'combined provinces' played a US Navy team from the USS \"Boise\". South African cricketer Dudley Nourse featured for Natal a few days later , and was noted as winning 'admiration of the visitors'. Nourse would later go on to captain and manage the South African cricket team as well as later holding Springbok records for test appearances and batting average. When he was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1948, the Press Association reported Nourse 'became one of his country's leading baseball experts'. The score is recorded as 18-3 to US Navy.\nIn Cape Town, on 17 November 1945, a South African exhibition team made up of players from the Transvaal, Natal, Eastern, and Western Province provinces took on a US Navy team from the USS \"Tennessee\" and USS \"California\" battleships. 'Nearly 20,000 cheering fans witnessed the principal game, which the ships’ company was hard pressed to win by two tallies (six to four)'.\nIn Johannesburg, on 19 March 1950, the Australian cricket team ended their tour with a baseball match against a combined South African baseball team, in front of a reported record crowd of 12,000.\nThe American All-Stars (1955–56).\nDuring a visit to Battle Creek, Michigan, in the United States in July 1955, the chairman of the South African Baseball Board met with the President of American Baseball Congress to finalise arrangements for celebrating baseball's 50th year in South Africa. The three-month and unbeaten 33 game tour began on 14 November 1955, finishing in February 1956.\nThe \"semi-pro level\" American all-star team was managed by New York Yankees scout Terry Bartron and included Brooklyn Dodgers' Hall of Famer and World Series runner up (1953) Don Thompson, and Dick Stuart who went on to become World Series champion (1960), a two-time MLB All-Star player (1961), and the first first baseman in major league history to record three assists in one inning (1963).\nSeven of the 33 games were against the first-ever official South African All-Star \"test\" team, which included Northern and Southern Rhodesia.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball match results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nTournament record.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\n2006.\nSouth Africa's inclusion in the WBC was considered rather surprising by many observers. No South African player reached Major League Baseball until Gift Ngoepe did so with the Pittsburgh Pirates on 27 April 2017. The team was managed by Rick Magnante, with then MLB career saves leader Lee Smith as a coach.\nIn the team's first game, South Africa nearly pulled off an upset of Canada, a team consisting of mostly Major League Baseball players. South Africa took an 8–7 lead into the ninth inning before falling 11–8. This would be as close as the team would get to winning a game. The South Africans lost the next two games to Mexico 10–4, and to the United States in a mercy rule-shortened 17–0 rout.\n2009.\nSouth Africa competed at the 2009 World Baseball Classic in Group B with Mexico, Cuba, and Australia.\nIn game 1 South Africa were overpowered by international powerhouse Cuba, giving up 6 home runs in an 8–1 loss. The South African defence was a bright point in the match however, turning three double plays and 2 pickoffs.\nIn the group elimination match South Africa lost heavily to hosts Mexico 14–3. Although the South Africans kept it a one-run ball game heading into the 7th inning, the Mexican team pounced on the inexperienced bullpen pitchers that entered the game late on and scored 11 runs in the final three innings.\nSouth Africa finished the 2009 WBC with an 0–2 record, with 4 runs scored and 22 conceded.\n2012 Qualifier.\nFour qualifying tournaments were scheduled in 2012 for the 2013 World Baseball Classic, with one team advancing from each to join the 12 squads that had qualified previously by winning at least one game in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Each of the pools included one team with previous experience in the WBC, but which failed to win a single game during the 2009 tournament. South Africa was placed in Qualifier 1 with Spain, France, and Israel at Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Florida.\nSouth Africa lost the first game of this double-elimination tournament to dark horse Israel, 7–3. They moved into the loser's bracket where they eliminated France, 5–2 in 11 innings, after Paul Bell hit a 2-run double into left field in the top of the 11th. In the loser's bracket final, South Africa fell to eventual WBC qualifier Spain, 13–3, and was eliminated from the tournament. Minnesota Twins prospect, Hein Robb pitched 5.1 innings in 2 relief appearances, giving up 0 runs while striking out 4 batters during the qualifying tournament.\nOlympic Games.\nThe national team appeared in their first and only Olympic tournament in the 2000 Olympics. South Africa gained entry into the tournament by beating Guam 3–0 in a best-of-five Africa/Oceania playoff series. The team finished with a record of 1–6, with their only win against Team Netherlands.\nThe win against the Netherlands was thanks largely to two key players:\nThe team competed at the Africa/Europe 2020 Olympic Qualification tournament in Italy in September 2019. Among those who played for the team were Bradley Erasmus, Anthony Phillips, Darryn Smith, and Dylan Unsworth.\nAll-Africa Games.\nSouth Africa was the host of the All-Africa Games in 1999. South Africa won the gold medal with ease, by defeating all of the other national teams. In order of the wins South Africa won against Lesotho (43–0) with Ian Holness hitting 4 home runs and 14 RBIs, Zimbabwe (37–2), Nigeria (19–1), Uganda (31–0) and Ghana (28–3). South Africa was again the dominant power in the 2003 Games held in Abuja, cruising to the final where they beat Nigeria 15–0 to win Gold."

        "title": "List of Super Rugby champions",
        "text": "Super Rugby is the major professional rugby union competition in the Southern Hemisphere. The competition began as Super 12 in 1996, consisting of 12 teams from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. An extra Australian and South African team were added in 2005 and the name was changed to Super 14. A fifteenth team joined in 2011 and the competition was rebranded as Super Rugby. The current format consists of three conferences of five teams from each country. Teams play other members of their conference twice (home and away) and four teams from each of the other two conferences once. The top team in each conference and the next best three over all conferences advance to the finals. In all previous formats there were no conferences and each team played every team once, with the top four progressing to the finals. The tournament is organised and governed by SANZAAR (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentine Rugby). Super Rugby is considered a successor to the Super Six (1992) and Super 10 (1993–1995), although SANZAR did not administer those tournaments.\nCompetition structure.\n1996–2010.\nEvery season, each team played every other team once, in a round-robin. The venues for regular season matches alternated each year, therefore teams would not play one another at the same venue in consecutive seasons unless they met in the play-offs. The tournament used the rugby union bonus points system; teams were awarded four points for a win, two for a draw, and none for a loss. They received bonus points for scoring four or more tries in a match, and for a loss by seven or fewer points.\nAfter each team had completed their regular season matches, the top 4 teams qualified for the semi-finals. Semi-finals were held under a Shaughnessy playoff system; the first-placed team in the table hosted the fourth-placed, and second hosted third. The winner of each semi-final advanced to the final, held at the home ground of whichever team amassed more points in the round-robin table.\n2011–2015.\nIn 2011, Melbourne Rebels joined the Super Rugby competition, meaning that Australia, New Zealand and South Africa would each be represented by five teams. The tournament format was also changed. Teams are divided into three conferences; one per country. Each team plays other teams in the same conference home and away, and plays eight further matches against teams from other conferences, for a total of sixteen games. Each team receives two byes throughout a season; from 2014 no points are added to the team's total on the day a bye is allocated. The highest placed team in each conference qualifies for the finals stage, along with three highest scoring teams which were not conference winners. The two highest scoring teams advance straight to the semi-finals, while the 3rd to 6th placed teams play-off to decide which two teams advance to the semis. The format of the semi-finals and final is the same as that previously used in the Super 14. The bonus points system has also been retained, with the single addition that a team receives four points for each bye.\n2016–2020.\n2016 saw the tournament expand to 18 teams with the inclusion of an Argentine team and Japanese team. The South African conference was split in two with the Sunwolves in South African conference 1 and Jaguares in South African conference 2. South African conference 1 teams will play Australian and New Zealand teams in alternative years with South African conference 2 teams. Every team plays 16 games in the regular season with the top 8 teams qualifying for the quarter-finals 1 v 8 etc. with each conference winner being seeded 1–4.\n2020–.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020 Super Rugby season was suspended, and then ultimately cancelled. Regional tournaments were set up to complete the 2020 season, with Super Rugby AU played in Australia, Super Rugby Aotearoa played in New Zealand and Super Rugby Unlocked played in South Africa. The and didn't compete in these regional tournaments, while the Western Force competed in Super Rugby AU and the , and competed in Super Rugby Unlocked. Only Super Rugby AU had a final as such for 2020, with a qualifying final and then final. Following the 2020 season, the South African sides withdrew from Super Rugby, while the Jaguares and Sunwolves also left the competition. Therefore, in 2021 only 10 teams competed in Super Rugby, again in regional tournaments with the addition of Super Rugby Trans-Tasman played between both Australian and New Zealand sides. A final was added to the Super Rugby Aotearoa competition in 2021, while a qualifying final and then final was again played in Super Rugby AU. Super Rugby Trans-Tasman will also have a final.\nTournaments.\nKey.\nTeams mentioned are those that qualified for the play-off rounds. Results are written so that the score of the team in each row is mentioned first. The highlighted team won that season's Super Rugby final.\n\"Note. For 1996 and 1997, it was the policy of the South African Rugby Union to send the top four teams of the previous year's Currie Cup to the Super 12. This resulted in the , Transvaal, Northern Transvaal and Western Province playing in 1996 and the Sharks, the Gauteng Lions, Free State Cheetahs and Northern Transvaal playing in 1997. In 1998, South Africa set up four (and later five, then six) Super Rugby regions, similar to the policy adopted by the New Zealand Rugby Union. For these areas, please see Super Rugby franchise areas.\"\nRegional competitions champions.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, regionalised tournaments were played for the remainder of the 2020 Super Rugby season and the 2021 Super Rugby season.

The combined events also changed their format, replacing the points-based system used in previous years with the Gundersen method, in which ski jumping points totals were translated to time gaps for a pursuit cross-country race.

        "title": "Jason Taylor (rugby league)",
        "text": "Jason Taylor (born 2 February 1971) is an Australian professional rugby league football coach and a former professional rugby league footballer who played as a in the 1990s and 2000s.\nHe was the assistant coach of the Sydney Roosters in 2018 when the club won the premiership that year. He was also previously the head coach of the Parramatta Eels, South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Wests Tigers in the National Rugby League (NRL). A New South Wales State of Origin representative goal-kicking halfback of the 1990s and early 2000s, Taylor set a number of point-scoring and appearance records in the NRL during a twelve-year career with the Western Suburbs Magpies, North Sydney Bears, Northern Eagles and Parramatta Eels.\nBackground.\nTaylor was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nHe spent his junior years at Green Valley JRLFC and the Ashcroft Stallions JRLFC, in Sydney's south-western suburbs. He first attended Ashcroft High School before spending his late teenage years St Gregory's College, Campbelltown.\nPlaying career.\nTaylor played for Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies from 1990 to 1993. Starting from the bench for the first 2 games of the 1990 season, Taylor spent most of the season playing five-eighth outside Ivan Henjak. Still a teenager, he was often called \"baby-faced\". In what was a poor season for the Magpies, Taylor was described as \"the best of the babies\" in the NSWRL for the season.\n1991 saw the arrival of coach Warren Ryan and big-name players Andrew Farrar, David Gillespie and Paul Langmack at the Magpies. Taylor, now playing halfback, lead the team to its first semi-finals in nine years after starring in a play-off for fifth spot.\nWests made the semis again in 1992, but Taylor was temporarily benched mid-season. Ongoing conflict with Warren Ryan saw Taylor seeking an early release from his contract. The release was not granted and Taylor remained for the 1993 season. Taylor said, \"The press came up with some interesting reasons why I wanted to leave, but I prefer to keep most of them to myself because they have been pretty well resolved. One reason, however, was I thought our style of play was too restrictive, too structured and by the end of the year, very predictable. I wasn't the only player to think that way.\nRyan stated in 1993, \"I've made every effort to rectify the things that were buggering him up last year. I did the same thing with Benny Elias when I was at Balmain. Jason is very, very talented mentally. We've rectified the problem we had and taken every step to resurrect his game. And to his credit when we told him he wouldn't be released he wasn't negative at all. He's done a lot of sprint work and he's worked hard.\" Later that season, Ryan suspended Taylor from first grade after an \"outburst\" aimed at teammate Paul Langmack at half-time in a match. The Wests Magpies board later overturned the suspension.\nIn 1993, Taylor made his representative debut with City Origin, playing from the bench. Described as, \"the form player of the premiership\" in 1994, Country Rugby League general manager David Barnhill claimed that Taylor should be eligible to play for the Country team due to his time spent at St. Gregorys. He ended up playing halfback for City for the next two years.\nTaylor was also selected to play for the New South Wales team in the 1993 State of Origin series. He was chosen on the bench for all three games, but did not take the field in the first game of the series. Coach Phil Gould said, \"if anything happened to Ricky we needed a capable and experienced halfback to go in with a similar game-type to Ricky. Jason's kicking and passing game is along the same lines and would allow fellows like Daley and Fittler the same room as if they were playing with Ricky.\"\nTaylor played with the North Sydney Bears from 1994 to 1999, While at North Sydney, Taylor played a pivotal role in the team and set numerous records. Taylor also won The Rothmans medal in 1996 as being the game's best and fairest player. Taylor has scored more points for the North Sydney Bears than any other player to have been at the club with 1274 points.\nIn January 1997, Taylor was escorted from the Sydney Cricket Ground following unruly behavior at an Australian Cricket match. It was alleged that Taylor and some of his North Sydney teammates had been backing up from a bucks party the night before when they proceeded to urinate in plastic cups and throw it over patrons during a Mexican wave. Taylor was then axed as an Australia Day ambassador by Central Coast organizers.\nIn the 1997 preliminary final against the Newcastle Knights, Taylor missed 3 out of 5 conversions in North Sydney's 17–12 defeat. The most crucial when scores were locked at 12-12 after Taylor set up Michael Buettner for a try moments before. With 3 minutes remaining, Norths had a chance to play in their first grand final in 54 years if Taylor could kick that goal. The normally reliable Taylor missed the conversion and Newcastle player Matthew Johns went down the other end of the field and kicked a field goal to make it 13–12. With seconds remaining Norths frantically threw the ball around the field, Owen Craigie swooped on a loose pass and raced away to score the match winning try to make it 17–12. This was North Sydney's 4th preliminary final defeat in 6 years.\nIn the 1998 NRL season, Taylor made 26 appearances as Norths finished 5th on the table. Taylor played in both finals matches against Parramatta and Canterbury-Bankstown which ended in defeat.\nTaylor captained Norths in what would be the club's last season in the top grade. He played in North Sydney's last game in the NRL which came against North Queensland at the Willows Sports Complex. Taylor scored 2 tries and kicked 3 goals in a 28–18 victory.\nTaylor remained with North Sydney for their merger with the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles to form the Northern Eagles in 2000, but was released by the club at the end of the season.\nWithout a club for the next year, Taylor wrote a letter to Parramatta Eels coach Brian Smith and joined the club for the 2001 season. His performance that year was described as, \"close to the greatest comeback ever in big-time rugby league.\" Taylor's last match was for Parramatta at in their 2001 NRL grand final loss to the Newcastle Knights.\nWhile at Parramatta Taylor set a new point-scoring record, breaking Daryl Halligan's mark of 2,034. Between 1992 and 2000 (and across three clubs) Taylor played 194 games in succession, also a standing record, 20 games clear of Hazem El Masri's 174.\nTaylor retired with the record for most career points in the National Rugby League and its predecessors. He scored 2,107 first grade career points, a mark later surpassed by Newcastle Knights halfback Andrew Johns in July 2006, then again by Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs winger Hazem El Masri in March 2009, then once again by Melbourne Storm hooker Cameron Smith in April 2019. He retired holding the record for most first grade career goals at 942 a mark later surpassed by Cameron Smith in May 2016. Taylor was the Australian Rugby League's top point-scorer in seasons 1996 and 1997.\nCoaching career.\nParramatta Eels.\nPreviously the assistant coach at the Parramatta Eels, he was appointed as head coach in May 2006 for the remainder of the season after Brian Smith left the club following the announcement of his sacking for season 2007. When Taylor took over as Parramatta coach, the club had only won 2 of its first 8 games. Taylor then guided Parramatta on a 9-game winning streak as the club finished in 8th place on the table and qualified for the finals. Parramatta were eliminated in the first week of the finals losing to minor premiers Melbourne 12–6.\nSouth Sydney Rabbitohs.\nIt was already planned that from 2007 Taylor was to join the South Sydney Rabbitohs as an assistant coach. In August 2006, it was announced he would replace Shaun McRae as head coach of the struggling South Sydney club. In his first year at Souths he took them to a top eight finish qualifying them for the finals. It was the first time since 1989 that Souths reached the finals.\nOn 17 September 2009 it was announced that Taylor had been sacked as coach by the club due to an altercation with second-rower David Fa'alogo during end-of-season celebrations. A visibly upset Taylor appeared on the NRL Footy Show later that evening and on a number of sport programs on Sydney radio in the following days to explain his conduct and subsequent dismay at his sacking.\nSydney Roosters roles.\nIn 2011, Taylor returned to coaching with the Sydney Roosters Toyota Cup (Under-20s) team. His team made the semis in both 2011 and 2012.\nWith the sacking of Brian Smith at the end of 2012, Taylor was appointed assistant coach to new first grade coach Trent Robinson for the 2013 season.\nWests Tigers.\nOn 29 September 2014 Taylor was announced as the head coach of the Wests Tigers for the next three seasons, starting from 2015.\nOn 20 March 2017 Taylor was sacked as Wests Tigers coach. After being terminated by Wests Tigers, it was revealed that Taylor was relieved of his duties partly due to poor results on the field but also for the fact that what the media had described as \"The Big 4\" at the club would not sign new contracts if Taylor was still the coach going forwards into the future. Taylor's time at Wests was also marred by an ugly feud with long time player Robbie Farah and resulted in Farah being demoted to reserve grade and then subsequently leaving the club altogether.\nReturn to Roosters staff.\nOn 8 May 2017, the Sydney Roosters confirmed that Jason Taylor will be on-boarded as an assistant coach. Roosters coach, Trent Robinson, quickly clarified that Mr Taylor would be an assistant to the coach.\nOn 5 September 2018, Taylor was announced as the new head coach of his former club the North Sydney Bears.\nIn Taylor's first year in charge at Norths, he guided the club to a third-placed finish at the end of the 2019 Canterbury Cup NSW regular season as they qualified for the finals for the first time since 2017.\nNorth Sydney would go on to be eliminated from the 2019 Canterbury Cup NSW finals series as they lost both matches against South Sydney and Newtown.\nAfter both of the 2020 and 2021 NSW Cup seasons were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Taylor guided North Sydney to third on the table in the 2022 season. North Sydney would go on to lose both finals matches against Penrith and Canterbury.\nIn the 2023 NSW Cup season, Taylor guided North Sydney to the Minor Premiership and later the grand final where they would play against South Sydney. North Sydney lead the match with five minutes remaining before Souths scored a late try to win 22-18.\nOn 28 September, Taylor signed a two-year deal to become the new assistant coach at Canterbury."

        "text": "Escape from Alcatraz is the name for two different triathlons held in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. The Escape from Alcatraz originated in 1981 as a private club event, beginning in San Francisco and ending in Marin County. The race split in 1983 with a separate commercial event open to the public, which is now an aquathlon (having dropped the biking section of a traditional triathlon) held on a shorter course entirely within San Francisco. However, a new public triathlon, also known by the name Escape from Alcatraz, is now run by IMG.\nOriginal Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon.\nThe first Escape from Alcatraz was proposed by Joe Oakes after he participated in the 1979 Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii. The first Escape from Alcatraz race was held two years later in June 1981, with members of the Dolphin Club testing the course. The course started with a swim from Alcatraz Island in the middle of San Francisco Bay to the city of San Francisco, a bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge to Mill Valley in Marin County, and an out-and-back running course over Mount Tamalpais to Stinson Beach and back. The running course followed the course of the Dipsea foot race, but by making it an out-and-back run rather than a one-way course, became known as a \"Double Dipsea\". \nThe course has remained the same over the years and celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2015. Participants are limited to members of the Dolphin Club and The South End Club. The Dolphin Club is the host and sponsor of the event.\nEscape from Alcatraz Triathlon (IMG).\nThe annual public Escape from Alcatraz triathlon, organized by IMG, now takes place in early June. The current course consists of a swim starting near Alcatraz Island, a run from the bay to the transition zone at Marina Green, an bike ride, and an run. The run portion includes a notorious section called the \"sand ladder\" at mile five, a climb from Baker Beach back up to the road that is a combination of sand and about 400 uneven log steps. The event had about 1700 participants in 2009. Entry is by Lottery process for most of the slots and the remainder is through qualification, which done through a good rank in the previous Escape from Alcatraz, or in four other triathlon races held during the preceding year.\nWhile entry is via lottery, they give preference to previous entrants.\nThe one exception to the June timeframe was when the Americas Cup sailing event came to the Bay Area. The resulting shift to March resulted in colder than normal conditions (swim) and more challenging tides than the normal date. The impact of this was a 3 fold increase in swimmers 'rescued' from the water, many more than normal were pulled out and transported to shallow water. They were allowed to continue the event and receive medals for finishing.\nThe Escape from Alcatraz triathlon was ranked as the number-one triathlon by \"Inside Triathlon Magazine\" for 2006."

Often overshadowed by star teammates such as \"Bullet\" Joe Rogan and José Méndez, Bell was described as quiet and well-liked, known for pitching complete games. (Bell completed 74 percent of the games he started.) Bell had a 10–2 record for the 1924 Kansas City Monarchs, compiling a 2.63 ERA. The following year, Bell went 9–3 in the regular season, pitching 2 games in the World Series to a 1.13 ERA. Bell recorded a 16–3 record the next year, followed by a 13–6 record in 1927 and a 10–7 record in 1928. Bell spent the 1928-1929 winter with Havana in the Cuban League, where he was tied for the league lead in wins with nine. Bell then returned to the United States and pitched to a 14–4 record with the Monarchs, followed by a 9–3 record the next year. Bell joined the Detroit Wolves in 1932 after the demise of the Negro National League. He then signed with the Pittsburgh Crawfords, where he compiled a 16–4 record for the 1932 season. Bell then moved to the Newark Dodgers, and when the Dodgers were merged with the Brooklyn Eagles to form the Newark Eagles, he became the Eagles' manager in 1936–1937. Bell's last season in baseball was as Eagles manager in 1948.\nBaseball historian Dick Clark estimated that Bell would have averaged an 18–7 record had he played the 154-game schedule that was used in the Major Leagues at the time.

        "text": "The Challenge Cup, hosted annually by the Elite Ice Hockey League, is a cup competition for ice hockey clubs in the United Kingdom. It is one of three competitions run each season by the Elite League, the others being the league championship and the playoff championship, the latter of which follows directly from the former, and also crowns the national champion. Prior to the formation of the Elite League in 2003, the Challenge Cup was organised by the Ice Hockey Superleague. Only EIHL clubs may enter the Challenge Cup, but unlike the play-offs, the competition itself is entirely independent of the league season.\nFirst awarded during the 1997–98 season, the Challenge Cup has had numerous different formats depending on the number of teams participating and the format of other competitions run during a particular season. The first six finals were single games played at a pre-determined venue, and during the first eleven seasons of the Elite League finals were contested over two legs. The final returned to a single game in the 2014–15 season. No final was contested in 2020–21, as the season was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe current holders of the trophy Sheffield Steelers, who won the trophy having defeated the Guildford Flames 3-1 in the 2023–24 final, this is the first final held and won at a home arena for 25 years.\nHistory and Challenge Cup Final results.\n1997–2003: Superleague era.\nIn 1997 the Ice Hockey Superleague reduced the league schedule from the 42 rounds of the previous season to 28. The league had hoped to arrange a new competition involving teams from Europe, leading to the shortening of the regular season. When this failed to materialise, clubs were faced with a shortfall in their fixtures. With sponsorship from the \"Daily Express\", the Challenge Cup was launched as a result. The competition was won by the Ayr Scottish Eagles, who defeated the Bracknell Bees 3–2 in the final at the Telewest Arena. The Eagles had already won the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and the Superleague title and would go on to complete a by winning the playoff championship.\nThe regular season schedule returned to 42 rounds for the 1998–99 season and certain league fixtures were also designated as Challenge Cup semi final qualifiers. This format would prevail for the next three seasons. The final was held at Sheffield Arena between the Nottingham Panthers and the Sheffield Steelers and was won 4–0 by the Steelers with goals from Teeder Wynne, John Wynne, Ed Courtenay and an empty net goal from Ken Priestlay. The Steelers successfully defended the title in the 1999–00 season, defeating the same opposition 2–1 at London Arena.\nThe 2000–01 final was held at the newly opened Odyssey Arena in Belfast, despite calls from the Northern Ireland Assembly to postpone the game because of the foot-and mouth outbreak. The final was also put into doubt when Sheffield Steelers players threatened to strike over unpaid wages. The game eventually went ahead as planned, with the Steelers defeating the Ayr Scottish Eagles 4–2 to win a third consecutive Challenge Cup and their third title of the season. They went on to win the playoff championship, becoming the second team to win the Challenge Cup as part of a Grand Slam season.\nThe Odyssey Arena played host to the final again in 2002. The Ayr Scottish Eagles made a second consecutive appearance, this time facing the Belfast Giants. The Giants had won the Superleague title by 21 points and had defeated the Eagles in seven out of eight regular season meetings, tying the other. Furthermore, the Giants had lost just twice at the Odyssey Arena during the regular season. Despite being the underdog, the Eagles took an early 2–0 lead and went on to win the Cup with a 5–0 victory.\nThe 2002–03 season was the final season of the Superleague. The cup format was changed with a round-robin group stage at the beginning of the season. British National League side Coventry Blaze took part alongside the seven Superleague sides. Initially London, Nottingham, Sheffield and the holders Scottish Eagles (by now playing in Glasgow having dropped Ayr from their name) qualified for the semi-finals. However the Eagles withdrew from the league in November because of financial problems and their place was taken by Belfast. In the semi-finals, both played at Sheffield Arena, Nottingham defeated Belfast 3–2 and Sheffield defeated London on penalty shots after a 4–4 tie. In the final at Manchester Arena, the Steelers claimed their fourth Challenge Cup title with a 3–2 win over their arch rivals. Nottingham came from 3–0 down with two late goals but the Steelers held on for victory.\n2003–present: Elite League era.\n2003–14: Two-legged finals.\nThe following season saw the launch of the Elite Ice Hockey League in place of the Superleague. The final was changed from a single game to a two-legged tie and the first round of the competition was reverted to the system used between 1998 and 2002, with designated league fixtures counting separately as Challenge Cup games. The final brought together the Nottingham Panthers and Sheffield Steelers, the fourth time to two clubs had met at this stage of the competition. The first leg, held at the National Ice Centre, ended in a 1–1 tie. In the second leg the Panthers took an early 2–0 lead, but Sheffield fought back to level the match at 2–2, forcing overtime. After 53 seconds of the extra session, Kim Ahlroos scored for the Panthers, earning them their first ever victory in a final against the Steelers and their first cup win since 1998.\nThe 2004–05 season saw the Coventry Blaze face the Cardiff Devils in the final. The Blaze had defeated the holders Nottingham to reach the final, while the Devils defeated Sheffield, the previous season's runner-up. The first leg in Coventry was won 6–1 by the home side. The Devils took a 4–1 lead in the second leg, but the Blaze fought back to win the match 5–4 and win the cup with an 11–5 aggregate victory. The Blaze would go to win the Elite League and playoff championships, becoming the third team to win the Challenge Cup as part of a Grand Slam winning season. The two sides met again in the final a year later, with the Blaze again winning the first leg in Coventry, this time 3–0. In the second leg the Devils emerged as 4–1 winners, tying the final 4–4 on aggregate. With overtime unable to separate the two sides, the Devils lifted their first Challenge Cup following a 1–0 win in a penalty shootout.\nCoventry made their third successive appearance in the final in 2006–07, this time facing the Sheffield Steelers. For the third season running, the Blaze hosted the first leg, winning 4–3. The second leg was held at Sheffield Arena six weeks later, with the Blaze winning 5–1, regaining the cup with a 9–4 aggregate victory. The Challenge Cup was the second part of a Double won by the Blaze, the club having also secured the league championship a week earlier. The Steelers returned to the final in 2008, facing their arch rivals Nottingham Panthers. The first leg was held in Sheffield, with Nottingham securing a 6–3 win. In the second leg the Steelers took a 2–0 lead after the first period, narrowing the aggregate score to 6–5. The Panthers tied the game 2–2 and restored their three-goal advantage during the second period, but Sheffield scored twice in the third period to make the score 4–2 and again take them within one goal of tying the final. With five minutes to go, Ryan Shmyr scored for Nottingham, giving the Panthers a 4–3 deficit on the night but a 9–7 lead on aggregate. The Panthers held on to win their second Challenge Cup title."

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured New Zealand in February and March 2006 as part of the 2005–06 New Zealand cricket season.\nComing into the series the New Zealand cricket team (\"Black Caps\") and the West Indies had very different fortunes. The Black Caps won their recent ODI series with Sri Lanka 3–1 whilst the West Indies, in November, were whitewashed by the Australians 3–0 and subsequently Australia retained the Frank Worrell Trophy.\nBoth New Zealand and the West Indies were looking to win as many of the One Day Internationals as possible to improve their rankings – New Zealand and the West Indies were, as of 29 January, ranked fourth and eighth respectively. Being ranked in the top six teams meant avoiding having to compete in the preliminary round of that year's ICC Champions Trophy.\nNew Zealand vice-captain Daniel Vettori believed his side was the favourite for the series.\nThe West Indian team arrived in Auckland on 10 February. Soon after arriving West Indian coach Bennett King accused the ICC Future Tours Programme of \"benefiting the rich at the expense of the poor.\"\nThe tour consisted of 5 One Day International, 3 Tests and a Twenty20 international. The Twenty20 was Chris Cairns' last international cricket game in New Zealand colours.\nSquads.\nODI's\nLimited Overs Matches.\nTwenty20: 16 February in Auckland.\nThe New Zealanders won the toss, playing in the beige uniforms of the 80s, and sent the West Indies in. The \"Windies\" scored a modest 126–7 off their 20 overs, a run rate of only 6.30 an over. In reply, Lou Vincent scored 42 off 37, the highest score in the match. New Zealand looked to have the game in the bag, needing just 47 off nine overs. However, in the next 7 overs, Dwayne Smith and Chris Gayle had only 31 runs scored of their bowling, reducing the Black Caps to 110–8. New Zealand then required 17 to win off the last over and the game looked beyond them. A James Franklin six off the second ball changed things and off the last ball, New Zealand required 5 to win and 4 to tie with tailender Shane Bond facing. Bond hit a four, sending the game into a bowl off. The first 12 balls missed the stumps and it took two hits from last ball hero Shane Bond to break the deadlock and then a hit from Scott Styris gave New Zealand a 3–0 win in the bowl off.\nFirst ODI: 18 February in Wellington.\nNew Zealand recorded a comprehensive victory with Nathan Astle scoring 90 and New Zealand ending up on 288–9 off 50 overs. West Indies never looked like winning, with wickets falling at regular intervals, despite Ramnaresh Sarwan and Daren Ganga both scoring 50s. Vice Captain Daniel Vettori was the pick of the New Zealand bowlers with 2–29 off 10 overs.\nSecond ODI: 22 February in Queenstown.\nNew Zealand won the toss and elected to field first. Good opening spells from James Franklin and Shane Bond restricted the West Indies to 10–2 of 10.1 overs. Wavell Hinds was the only West Indian batsman who looked dangerous, scoring 76 off 88 balls. Bond was the pick of the New Zealand bowlers, who did well to restrict the West Indies to 200–9 off 50 overs. The West Indies struck back early in New Zealand's innings, leaving the hosts struggling on 13–4 after 3.2 overs. This was thanks to the bowling of Ian Bradshaw and Fidel Edwards who both got two wickets. However, sensible batting from Peter Fulton (49), Brendon McCullum (45) and vice-captain Daniel Vettori (53*) saw New Zealand home with 3 wickets in hand. Vettori was awarded Man of the match for his allround figures of 53 not out and 28–1 off ten overs.\nThird ODI: 25 February in Christchurch.\nNew Zealand won the toss and decided to bat first, going less than five an over for most of the innings. However some late hitting by Nathan Astle, who finished on 118 not out and hit three sixes off the last three balls of the innings, got New Zealand to 276–6. Ian Bradshaw was the pick of the West Indian bowlers, with 3–41 off 8 overs. In the West Indies innings, Chris Gayle scored a 23 ball 38, putting the run rate above 6 an over. However Daniel Vettori brought the Kiwis back into the game with two wickets in one over. Later on, Astle backed up his batting effort with a one handed catch on the rope. The West Indies finished all out at the end of 49 overs. Astle was named Man of the Match for the second time in three matches. New Zealand have now won the series.\nFourth ODI: 1 March in Napier.\nThe West Indies won the tost and decided to field. New Zealand got off to a good start, with an opening partnership of 106 between Lou Vincent and captain Stephen Fleming. Nathan Astle continued his fine form, with 81 runs. Debutant Ross Taylor made 15 off ten balls before being runout. Some late hitting from Brendon McCullum got New Zealand past the 300 mark. Chris Gayle and Fidel Edwards were the West Indies best bowlers, with respective figures of 3–50 and 0–23, with each bowling 10 overs.\nThe West Indies found themselves in trouble early, losing Gayle for 5. The West Indies never looked competitive, with only Runako Morton getting past fifty, going on to make 110 not out off 155. Kyle Mills was New Zealands best bowler, with 3–45 while Daniel Vettori continued his economical series, claiming 1–32 off ten overs.\nFifth ODI: 4 March in Auckland.\nNew Zealand won the toss, electing to bat, resting Daniel Vettori, Jamie How and Michael Mason who all played in the first ODI, as they had already won the series. New Zealand were in trouble early, with Lou Vincent and Nathan Astle both being dismissed before the side reached double figures. Despite 90 from Scott Styris, New Zealand failure at creating partnerships left them all out on 233. Dwayne Smith picked up 5–45.\nThe West Indies played very conservatively in the first ten overs, scoring just 10, in the hopes of not losing a wicket to Shane Bond. The West Indies then looked to score after that, with every batsmen making a contribution. The West Indies managed to get 234 in the final over, with 3 wickets in hand and 2 balls to spare.\nTest Matches.\nThird Test (25–29 March).\nDespite the Test Series already in the bag for New Zealand, West Indies started the third Test with renewed vigour until the first day was stopped after only 27 overs, with the score at 95/1. The second day seemed more promising until, after 52 overs bad rain stopped play – the third and fourth day followed suit until the game was abandoned."

        "title": "1972 World Series of Poker",
        "text": "The 1972 World Series of Poker (WSOP) was a series of poker tournaments held during early May 1972 at the Binion's Horseshoe in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was the 3rd annual installment of the World Series of Poker, and also the 2nd one to feature the freezeout structure. In comparison with the previous year's series, the number of events was cut back and the buy-ins were raised, resulting in 1 preliminary event and the Main Event both having the same buy-in of $10K (equals about $54K in 2011 U.S. dollars). The preliminary event featured 5-card stud poker and was won by Bill Boyd, the same man who won the 1971 5-card stud preliminary event. The previous years' double champion Johnny Moss was defeated early in the main event and Thomas \"Amarillo Slim\" Preston went on to win the tournament after a series of deals.\nPreliminary event.\nThe preliminary event had a very small turnout, featuring only last year's 5-card stud champion Bill Boyd, and an unknown player. The event was played out on May 7, and Boyd relieved the other player of his money, cashing for $20K. Boyd went on to win 2 more 5-card stud events in 1973 and 1974 until 5-card stud was dropped from the WSOP slate due to waning popularity.\nMain Event.\n12 people were slated to appear at the main event, but due to reportedly attractive side cash games only 8 of them appeared at the tables on May 11, the date the event was scheduled to run. Half of each player's $10K buy-in was covered by Benny Binion, who was looking to gain publicity from the event and thus draw bigger crowds into Binion's Horseshoe. The winner of previous 2 WSOP main events, Johnny Moss, took an early lead in the tournament, but soon ended up eliminated. Moss hit a set of deuces with 2-2 on a 9-7-2 flop and after a 10 came on the turn, he got all-in versus Doyle Brunson's pocket aces. However, Brunson hit a 3rd A on the river to win the hand. Moss had almost no chips left and got eliminated shortly afterwards.\nWith 4 players left on the 2nd day of the tournament, Amarillo Slim, the would-be champion, was very short-stacked with less than 2,000 chips. Beating Brunson's pocket 10 with trip 5s on a 5-5-3 flop, Slim made his way back into the game and soon saw Jack Straus eliminated. With only 3 players (Walter \"Puggy\" Pearson, Brunson and Slim) remaining, Jack Binion led news reporters and a TV crew to the poker table. At that point, Brunson and Pearson announced they did not want to win the event. Brunson was not only afraid of not being let in on future lucrative cash games if he were to be pronounced the world champion of poker, but also of a tax audit. The players struck a deal whereupon Pearson and Brunson would let Slim win the tournament, but in return they would take the cash value of their current chip stacks from Slim's prize.\nJack Binion was very cross with the outcome, as players openly changed their play to let Slim win. He held a meeting with the players in the Sombrero room of the Binion's Horseshoe, demanding that players resume fair play. Brunson laid out his reasons and Binion allowed him to withdraw from the tournament and cash his chips, while the reason for Brunson's departure was reported to be an stomachache. The sum that Brunson received in the end is disputed; some sources lay out figures as low as $20K, while according to Des Wilson, Brunson might have left the tournament with as much as half the prizepool.\nAfter Brunson left, Pearson and Slim resumed play. According to Slim, Pearson was not content with the deal and was still trying to win the tournament, but in the end Jack Binion reportedly persuaded him to soft-play Slim and thus throw the match for publicity reasons. In the final hand, Pearson raised to 700 chips with 6-6 (of unknown suits) and Slim called with . A flop of K-8-8 was seen. Slim pushed his 51K-chip stack in the pot and Pearson promptly called, both players getting all their chips in the pot. Turn and river (poker) were a deuce and an 8, respectively, and Slim won with a bigger full house. However, in the end, according to The Hendon Mob, Slim walked away from the table with winnings of mere $15K, only 3 times his investment.\nAftermath.\nAfter winning the tournament, Amarillo Slim was invited to Johnny Carson's \"The Tonight Show\" on June 12 the same year. Slim later made 10 more appearances on \"The Tonight Show\", an appearance on CBS's \"Hour\", and a cameo in the 1974 film \"California Split\". Slim's large media exposure contributed to the recognizance of the World Series of Poker and the popularization of poker in mainstream U.S. media and popular culture. The next year's WSOP was covered by CBS and over 7,000 newspaper articles were written about it. \"Time\" magazine featured an article on Amarillo Slim with an excerpt about WSOP and rules of poker."

The freezeout structure replaced the cash games, and it was kept in use ever since. 5 freezeouts were played in total—4 preliminary events and the Main Event—each featuring a different poker variant. The preliminary events required player to put up a buy-in of $1K, while the Main Event buy-in was $5K.\nMain Event.\nThere were 6 entrants to the main event, each paying $5K to enter the tournament.

He was also named Super League's coach of the year in 2006 and again in 2007.\nIn February 2007, Anderson won the World Club Challenge with St. Helens, defeating Australian champions, the Brisbane Broncos.\nHe then went on to coach St Helens to win the 2007 Challenge Cup final, defeating the Catalans Dragons 30–8 at the new Wembley Stadium.\nSt. Helens made it to 2007's Super League XII Grand Final at Old Trafford against the Leeds Rhinos, but they lost 33–6.\nIn August 2008 Anderson won the Rugby League Challenge Cup with St Helens for a third successive year beating Hull FC 28–16 at Wembley Stadium.\nHe is the brother-in-law of former Hull Kingston Rovers coach Justin Morgan.\nHe coached St Helens in their loss to the Leeds Rhinos in 2008's Super League XIII Grand Final.\nParramatta Eels.\nOn 17 November 2008 Anderson was announced the head coach of the Parramatta Eels NRL squad for three years, beginning in 2009. He guided the Eels to a remarkable 2009 National Rugby League Grand Final from a position where after 18 rounds the Eels were tipped 150/1 to win the NRL. On 25 September 2010, it was announced that Anderson's contract had been terminated with immediate effect by the club, who replaced him with Stephen Kearney.\nOn 18 October 2013, it was announced that Anderson would leave his post as NRL Referees elite performance manager to return to Parramatta in the newly created job as general manager of football operations.\nIn 2014, a report revealed that a review was conducted in order to determine whether Anderson should have been granted a contract extension as head coach back in 2011. Anderson \"had suggested his position would be untenable for the 2011 season and the level of undermining and the resultant instability would make his job impossible\", the report read. \"He was very disappointed and it was going to be a long year for all. He claimed his staff were ‘not on his bus’ and that it was a toxic environment\". The report also alleged that players had turned up to recovery sessions intoxicated or smelling of alcohol and that \"he also struggled to handle relationships that longer serving staff and players had with the board.\"\nIn 2016, Anderson along with four other board members were de-registered by The NRL and had their contracts terminated by Parramatta in the wake of the club's salary cap scandal. It was alleged that Anderson along with the other board members which the media dubbed \"The gang of five\" had been aware of or made payments to players outside of the game's rules. If found guilty of this, Anderson could face a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail for fraud.\nSydney Roosters.\nOn 30 January 2019, it was revealed that Anderson had joined the Sydney Roosters in a recruitment role. Before Anderson was allowed to join the club, the Eastern Suburbs outfit had to convince the NRL that he was a fit and proper person befitting registration. An NRL spokesman said Anderson had been approved to join Easts with some restrictions on his role after two years out of the game.\nPersonal life.\nOn 31 December 2022, it was reported that Anderson had been rushed to hospital following a surfing accident in the Central Coast area of New South Wales. The Sydney Morning Herald also reported that Anderson was on a ventilator and had been kept under supervision at Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital. Anderson experienced severe compression of his spinal cord in the accident, and, as of 28 May 2023, was an incomplete quadriplegic. He has limited mobility in much of his body, with the outlook for further improvement unclear. On August 18, 2023, Go Media Mt Smart Stadium was named in his honour as a fundraiser for One NZ Warriors' final home game of the 2023 NRL regular season against Manly Sea Eagles.\nHonours.\nDally M Coach of the Year \"2002\"\nNRL Grand Finalist \"2002, 2009\"\nChallenge Cup Winner \"2006, 2007, 2008\"\nSuper League Grand Final Winner \"2006\"\nBBC Coach of the Year \"2006\"\nWorld Club Challenge Winner \"2007\""

        "title": "Craig Bellamy (rugby league)",
        "text": "Craig Bellamy (born 3 October 1959) is an Australian professional rugby league football coach who is the head coach of the Melbourne Storm in the National Rugby League (NRL), and a former professional rugby league footballer. He is known as one of the greatest coaches in NRL history.\nHe has previously coached the New South Wales State of Origin team. Bellamy started his coaching career as assistant coach to Wayne Bennett at the Brisbane Broncos. He also writes a column for \"The Australian\".\nBellamy played his entire NSWRL premiership career with the Canberra Raiders during the 1980s, and 1990s. In Canberra he played under the coaches Don Furner (1982–87), Wayne Bennett (1987), and Tim Sheens (1988–92). Injury midway through the 1987 season saw Bellamy miss the Raiders charge to their first ever Grand Final appearance which resulted in an 18–8 loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Bellamy played from the bench in Canberra's 18–14 win over Penrith in the 1990 Grand Final at the Sydney Football Stadium.\nAfter a coaching apprenticeship as Wayne Bennett's assistant at the Brisbane Broncos, which included a win over the Wests Tigers with the \"Baby Broncos\" when Bennett and the teams stars were away on State of Origin duty. Bellamy was appointed head coach of the Melbourne Storm for the 2003 NRL season. There he has achieved great success; winning the 2007 Grand Final over Manly and the 2009 Grand Final over Parramatta, though both of these were later stripped due to extensive salary cap breaches. He also led the Storm to the minor premiership in 2011, and won his first legitimate premiership as a coach in 2012 when the Storm defeated the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. He was the coach of the New South Wales State of Origin team until he was sacked in 2010, the same year as the Storm's salary cap scandal, after three unrelenting seasons of disappointment which netted only two wins from nine matches.\nBellamy won his second recognised NRL premiership as coach with the Melbourne Storm after a dominant 2017 season in which the Storm lost only four games. In 2018 the Storm had a successful year making it to the 2018 NRL Grand Final before being beaten by the Sydney Roosters. He won his third NRL premiership with the Storm in 2020.\nHe has yet to coach a losing NRL season, maintaining a better than 50% win–loss ratio for each season he has coached. Melbourne have played finals football every year since Bellamy began coaching the side, with the sole exception of the 2010 NRL season where the club would have placed fifth on the ladder had they not been penalised for a salary cap breach. He has also never lost in round one of a season as coach. Bellamy's 22 seasons with Melbourne is the longest consecutive stint by a coach at a single club.\nBackground.\nBellamy was born 3 October 1959 in Portland, New South Wales, Australia.\nPlaying career.\nHe played his early junior football for Portland Colts. Bellamy also played for Oberon Tigers in the Country Rugby League as a teenager before moving to Macquarie United in the Newcastle Rugby League in 1979.\nThe Canberra Raiders signed Bellamy in their début season, 1982. He played the majority of his career in the centres but was also used as a utility player, appearing at times as fullback, winger, five-eighth and lock. After the Raiders won the 1989 NSWRL season's Grand Final (which he wasn't selected for), Bellamy travelled with the Raiders to England for the 1989 World Club Challenge, but didn't play in the loss to Widnes at Old Trafford.\nAfter winning the 1990 premiership with the Raiders, Bellamy spent 1991 with Turvey Park in Wagga Wagga as captain/coach in the Group 9 Competition, he was also the Riverina Rugby League Captain and also had a stint playing in England for Swinton, before returning to Canberra for one last year in 1992.\nCoaching career.\n1990s.\nIn 1995, Bellamy coached the Canberra Raiders' President's Cup team to a premiership win. In 1998 he became performance co-ordinator and assistant coach to Wayne Bennett at the Brisbane Broncos. That year they won the 1998 NRL Grand final.\n2000s.\nIn 2002, when Broncos' head coach Wayne Bennett was on State of Origin duty with the Queensland Maroons, Bellamy gained NRL experience as a head coach. Forced to field a team full of young players due to the regular side's representative commitments, the 'Baby Broncos' upset the Wests Tigers. The Tigers were a leading candidate to sign Bellamy as their coach for the 2003 season, although he ultimately joined Melbourne after Mark Murray was sacked. In his third season as an NRL coach with the Storm, Bellamy started coaching the Country Origin team with a loss in 2005. His work with Wayne Bennett extended to international level when he was appointed assistant to Bennett for the Australian Test team during the 2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament, and was often seen 'running the water' to players on the field. Bellamy was considered a leading candidate to coach the Queensland Maroons in 2006, but his selection was opposed by many former players, including Arthur Beetson, and was ultimately vetoed due to the fact he was a New South Welshman. He coached New South Wales Country to victory and his club, Melbourne won the 2006 minor premiership and reached the 2006 National Rugby League grand final, but finished as runners-up to former mentor Bennett's Brisbane Broncos. In the post season Bellamy continued as Kangaroos assistant coach, now under Ricky Stuart for the 2006 Tri Nations series. The following season Country lost but the Storm were minor premiers and reached the 2007 NRL grand final, in which they defeated the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles 34–8 to become premiers. They were however later stripped of the title by the NRL.\nIn April, 2008, Bellamy signed a five-year contract extension through to 2013 with Melbourne despite interest from the Brisbane Broncos. This signing meant that Bellamy would become the first 10-year coach in the Storm's history. After the New South Wales Blues' poor showing in the 2007 State of Origin series, Bellamy was appointed as coach for the 2008 series. In his first series in charge of NSW, the Blues lost to Mal Meninga's Maroons 2 – 1. The second and third series have also resulted in series losses, therefore posing serious questions on Bellamy's abilities to coach at representative level.\nDuring the finals campaign of the 2008 NRL season, Bellamy cost his club $50,000 after he was fined for disclosing scathing remarks and views on the NRL's decision to suspend his side's captain and goal-kicker, Cameron Smith over a controversial \"grapple tackle\" on Brisbane's Sam Thaiday. Bellamy claimed that the administration was corrupt and that bookkeepers already knew that Smith would be denied the opportunity to play for the rest of the season and furthermore along with Melbourne's CEO questioned the NRL's integrity in their opting to side-line Smith and not others who were guilty of committing similar tackles. This drew threats of legal action from the members of the NRL Judiciary.\nBellamy coached Melbourne to their 3rd successive NRL grand final, but could not repeat the feats of the previous year as his side suffered an enormous 40–0 defeat to Manly.\n2009 marked the fourth consecutive year Melbourne played in the grand final under Bellamy. Melbourne also reached the top four on the NRL ladder for the fourth consecutive year. \nCraig Bellamy coached Melbourne in their grand final win in 2009 only to be stripped of the title due to breaching the salary cap.\nBellamy was named coach of the year at the 2009 RLIF awards.\n2010s.\nBellamy left as Blues coach after the 2010 State of Origin series which resulted in a 3-0 whitewash, the first in Origin and also the Blues' first since 2000. Ricky Stuart was later named his successor. So far the Storm had not missed the finals in Bellamy's seven seasons at the helm with the exception of 2010 when they were not allowed to earn any points due to their 2009 salary cap breach. Had they been allowed to accumulate points however they would have made the top 8 again. He took them to the minor premiership in 2011, just narrowly missing out on a spot in the grand final to a loss in the preliminary final to the New Zealand Warriors. He went one better in 2012, winning the 2012 NRL grand final against Canterbury 14–4. That year he also received the Rugby League International Federation's coach of the year award for the second time.\nDespite speculation he would move to the Warriors or St George-Illawarra as coach, he signed a new three-year deal with Melbourne Storm in early 2013. He coached the team to victory in the 2013 World Club Challenge over Leeds, earning the title of world champions. Late in the 2013 NRL season during an interview with Paul Vautin for Channel 9's \"The Footy show\", it was revealed that Bellamy was an electrician by trade, though downplayed it by saying that he was \"not a very good one.\" Also during 2013 Bellamy's book, \"Home Truths: On Life, Leadership, Adversity, Success and Failure\" was published.\nOn 16 May 2014 Bellamy reached a milestone, and created a new club record, of having coached the Melbourne Storm for 300 games.\nOn 4 March 2016, Bellamy extended his stay as Melbourne Storm coach to the end of 2018.\n2020s.\nCraig Bellamy had coached the Melbourne Storm to yet another NRL Premiership title in 2020, defeating the Penrith Panthers 26–20. This was despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had his players living away from home for five months straight.\nBellamy's acknowledged genius as a coach.\nStories are legion of competent but mediocre players realising potential they never dreamed they had playing for the Melbourne Storm, and then getting lucrative offers to transfer to other clubs. Commentator Paul Kent describes how Bellamy transforms \"journeymen footballers into accomplished players.\".\nCoach, commentator and rugby league administrator Phil Gould stated:\nMelbourne’s military-like , mechanical , meticulous and clinical form of rugby league excellence, not only wins a lot of games; it stands up under pressure; it teaches individuals within the team to stand up; it makes good players of average players; great players of good players ; it turns great players into champions . Basically, it produces championship teams.\nStatistics.\n! width=\"30\"|Year\n! Team\n! width=\"30\"|Games\n! width=\"30\"|Wins\n! width=\"30\"|Draws\n! width=\"30\"|Losses\n! width=\"30\"|Win %\n!

        "title": "Mark Murray (rugby league)",
        "text": "Mark Murray (born 1 May 1959) is an Australian former rugby league footballer and coach. He represented Australia in test matches and Queensland in the State of Origin. His position of choice was . Murray has also coached in the National Rugby League and State of Origin.\nPlaying career.\nMurray, a qualified teacher, was an instrumental player in the early Queensland State of Origin sides, and played 17 games (15 State of Origin) between 1981 and 1986. He also represented his country on six occasions between 1982 and 1985 (not including one non-test international against Wales), and toured with the famous 1982 Invincibles, and made his test debut for Australia from the bench in a pre-Kangaroo Tour test against Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby in 1982, though he would not play any of the 5 tests on the Kangaroo tour against Great Britain or France.\nMurray also played in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership with the Norths Devils, captaining them to a famous premiership win over Souths in 1980 under the coaching of Kiwi Graham Lowe, before moving to the Valleys Diehards for the 1982 season to play alongside representative teammate Wally Lewis. In 1983 he shifted to the Redcliffe club and played for them up until midway through the 1986 season.\nCoaching career.\nMurray's playing career was cut short that year by an eye injury which required surgery. After coaching Redcliffe to a Woolies Trophy win and minor premiership in 1990, he was appointed coach of the Eastern Suburbs Roosters in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership between 1991 and 1994, before he was sacked mid-season and replaced by Arthur Beetson. Before his sacking, Murray had already been effectively demoted from the role as Roosters head coach, to be officially designated as \"co-coach\" with former Roosters player John Peard for much of the 1994 season.\nMurray was appointed coach of Queensland in 1999, but was released as coach after the 2000 series, in which the Maroons lost the series 0-3 and were beaten in the last match by 56–16. He and Michael Hagan are the only two coaches in Queensland's history not to have won an Origin series for the state as head coach (although Murray did coach the side in 1999 when the Maroons retained the shield and Hagan was assistant coach when they won the series in 2010). Murray also has the worst winning percentage of any Queensland coach, with only one win and one draw from six matches at 16.6%.\nMurray was also the coach of the Brisbane Norths rugby league team from 1997 to 2000, with whom he won the 1998 Queensland Cup. After the resignation of Chris Anderson as coach of the Melbourne Storm in April 2001, Murray took over the role for his second stint as a mentor in the NSWRL/ARL/NRL.\nHe was unable to repeat the success of his predecessor however, and was ultimately released in favour of Craig Bellamy after the 2002 season. He since became the CEO of the Norths club.\nPersonal life.\nOutside of rugby league, Murray has previously worked as a teacher, and has also worked in real estate."

        "title": "Nathan Brown (rugby league, born 1973)",
        "text": "Nathan Brown (born 31 July 1973) is an Australian professional rugby league football coach who was the Head Coach of the New Zealand Warriors in the NRL and former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s.\nHe played as a for the St. George Dragons and St. George Illawarra Dragons in the National Rugby League, also coaching the latter. He then spent time in the Super League coaching the Huddersfield Giants and St Helens, with whom he won the 2014 Super League Grand Final, before returning to Australia to coach the Newcastle Knights in the NRL.\nPlaying career.\nAt the end of his debut season Brown played for the St. George Dragons in the 1993 Winfield Cup Grand Final loss to the Brisbane Broncos. He also played for them in the 1996 ARL season grand final loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Brown played for the newly formed St. George Illawarra Dragons at hooker in their 1999 NRL Grand Final loss to the Melbourne Storm. He was forced to retire following a neck injury in a 2001 NRL season trial game. \nCoaching career.\nSt. George Illawarra Dragons.\nBrown was appointed coach of St. George Illawarra for the 2003 season, becoming the youngest non-playing coach in years in the NRL at age 29. During his first season, at a match on Sunday, 13 April 2003 against Manly at WIN Stadium, a frustrated Nathan Brown berated captain Trent Barrett, Brett Firman and Lance Thompson on the sideline in the 53rd minute with the scores locked up at 12-all. Brown slapped Barrett across the cheek and grabbed the jerseys of Barrett and Thompson. The incident was seen by the crowd and other players on the big screen and proved a decisive turning point as Manly ran in five second half tries to win 38–12. After the match, Brown was apologetic to Barrett and was later fined $5,000 by the NRL.\nOn 19 July 2005, Brown was fined $10,000 by the NRL after claiming that referees are biased against St George Illawarra. Brown made the comments after his team were penalised 9-3 by the referees. Despite the penalty count, St. George Illawarra still managed to defeat Manly 36–10.\nAfter finishing second in the 2005 competition, Brown's team lost the preliminary final to the eventual premiers, Wests Tigers. Following many injuries and team losses throughout the 2007 season, he was under pressure to keep his job heading into the 2008 season.\nOn 1 April 2008, it was announced that Brown would not coach St. George Illawarra in the 2009 season, which ended an association with the club that stretches back to the start of the joint venture. He was replaced by Wayne Bennett.\non 18 July 2008 it was announced that Brown had signed a 3-year deal with Super League club, Huddersfield, the same club Tigers superstar Brett Hodgson joined.\nHuddersfield Giants.\nIn his first season at Huddersfield he took the team to the 2009 Challenge Cup final.\nSt Helens.\nHe left Huddersfield at the end of the 2012 season to take control of St Helens. In his first season as coach, Brown guided St Helens to 5th place in Super League. However, they were defeated 11-10 by Leeds Rhinos in the play-offs stage of the competition.\nIn his second season, Brown guided St Helens to 1st place in Super League and victory in the Grand Final, after defeating the Wigan Warriors 14–6 at Old Trafford.\nBrown's side playing against a 12-man team for 78 minutes, after Warriors prop Ben Flower was sent off for punching Lance Hohaia in the second minute of the match. In October 2014, it was announced that Brown would leave the club to return to his native Australia, citing 'family reasons'.\nMelbourne Storm.\nIn February 2015, the Melbourne Storm announced that Brown had joined the club as a \"coaching consultant\". Based in Sydney, Brown worked on scouting assignments and provided specialist coaching for the club's s. On 9 September 2015, Brown signed a 3-year contract to coach the Newcastle Knights.\nNewcastle Knights.\nThe 2016 NRL season was Brown's first as head coach of the Newcastle Knights. In his first two seasons at Newcastle, Brown's side collected back to back wooden spoons, finishing last on the ladder. In 2018, after Newcastle defeated Brisbane, Brown claimed at the press conference that Brisbane coach Wayne Bennett was to blame for Newcastle's problems over the last few seasons. He went on to say \"I just don’t think he needs to behave like that myself but the reality is when Wayne came to town if he thought with his big head rather than his little head, I wouldn’t have had to rebuild the joint,’’. Brown went on to apologize for his remarks a few days later.\nIn June 2018, Brown signed an open ended performance based contract with Newcastle and no set term but a payout agreement should the contract end.\nIn the 2019 season, the Newcastle club won their first game, lost their next five, then won five, before going back on a five-game losing streak. This prompted discussions between Brown and club CEO Phillip Gardner, resulting in a mutual agreement that Brown would not coach the Newcastle club in 2020, but would stay on until the end of the season. However, on 27 August, the Newcastle side announced that Brown would depart the club effective immediately.\nNew Zealand Warriors.\nOn 7 August 2020, Brown was named as the new head coach of the New Zealand Warriors on a three-year deal. In Brown's first season in charge, the club finished 12th on the table and missed the finals. \nIn round 7 of the 2022 NRL season, New Zealand suffered their heaviest ever defeat losing 70-10 against Melbourne at AAMI Park. On 7 June 2022, Brown quit as head coach of the New Zealand club. Brown and the Warriors agreed to part ways immediately after he informed the club he would not be able to relocate his family to New Zealand for the long-term. Brown left the club sitting 14th on the table having lost their previous five games. Brown then confirmed to the media on the same day that his head coaching days were over. Brown went on to say \"I spoke to my family and my head coaching days are finished. I told them I am not going to appear at another club. I said, you decide whether you want me to stay for the rest of this year or not, but my head coaching days are over. I’m going into another field in rugby league and I’m going to honour my word what I said to those blokes\".\nParramatta Eels.\nIn 2022, Brown joined Parramatta as the clubs elite pathways coaching director. On 21 November 2023, Brown stepped down from his role."

        "title": "Paul Roos (rugby union)",
        "text": "Paul Johannes Roos (30 October 1880 – 22 September 1948) (also known as \"Oom Polla\" – Afrikaans for \"Uncle Polla\", \"Polla\" being a pet name for \"Paul\") was one of the first South African Springbok rugby union captains and led the first South African rugby team to tour overseas – to Britain in 1906. Roos was born near the South African town of Stellenbosch on 30 October 1880 and completed his education there.\nA devout Christian, Roos was a popular rugby player and was chosen by his own teammates to captain the 1906 tour. Throughout the tour he saw the campaign as an attempt to improve the relationship between his fellow countrymen and the British after the events of the Second Boer War.\nRugby career.\nRoos earliest recorded games of rugby were for Victoria College, for whom he played in the third team in 1897, progressing through the squads until by 1899 he was a prominent member of the first team. With no first class team in the area, he joined the Villagers in 1900, before returning to the Stellenbosch University side in 1901. By 1902 Roos was captaining the team, and led the team with great success.\nBy 1903 Roos had been selected for the Western Province team, but was such a devout Christian, he refused to play or travel on a Sunday. This led to Roos refusing to play for the Western Province team in the Currie Cup of 1904 as it would mean he would need to travel on a Sunday. The Western Province captain wrote to a professor at Stellenbosch University, where Roos lectured, to convince Roos to play. Roos' brother, Gideon Roos, followed his older brother playing for both Stellenbosch and Western Province before he himself played international rugby for South Africa.\nBefore his first international match Roos faced the 1903 touring British Isles while representing Western Province; the game ending in a 3–3 draw at Newlands. After his performance for Western Province, Roos was selected to represent the South African national team in 1903 in the final Test against the British Isles. The first two Test matches had both ended in draws, and when the South Africans won, they took their first series against a British team.\nIn 1906 Roos was part of the first overseas touring South African team. The bulk of the team was made up of Western Province players, who had recently won the Currie Cup. Roos, who was the only player not to have undertaken a trial for the match as he was seen as a certainty for the team, was elected by the rest of the players to be the team captain. After being given the captaincy, Roos addressed the team by stating, \"I would like to make absolutely clear at the outset we are not English-speaking or Afrikaans-speaking, but a band of happy South African\"; as the tour took place just several years after the end of the Second Boer War, where once teammates had fought on different sides of the conflict.\nThe tour to Britain, Ireland and France took in 29 matches, including Test games against the four Home Nations and a non-Test with the French national team. The tour began with great expectations, as the previous season had seen the Original All Blacks tour Britain with incredible success. The first 15 games were against club and county teams, with the South Africans victorious in every encounter, though they were run close by a strong Glamorgan County team. The first international encounter for the team was against Scotland, played in front of a record crowd of 30,000. Roos was forced to miss the game after he injured his collarbone in the encounter with Oxford University, and the captaincy was handed over to Paddy Carolin; the match ended in the first defeat for the South African's with Scotland scoring two tries in the second half. The Springboks were back on winning form the very next game against the North of Scotland, then travelled to Belfast to face Ireland. Roos lead his team out at the Balmoral Showgrounds. After the first half, Roos men were leading 3–12, but Ireland levelled the scores to 12–12 before a try from the wing settled the game in the South Africans' favour.\nThe game against Wales was the most anticipated of the tour. Wales had been unofficially crowned the World's best team after a Triple Crown winning season in 1905 and a win over the All Blacks in the 'Game of the Century'. The Glamorgan team that had run the South Africans close earlier in the tour had contained twelve internationals, and the Welsh were keen for revenge. Despite this, Roos was a popular figure in Wales, and with his deep impressive voice and \"pronounced Dutch accent\", he had spoken at church meetings throughout the tour; and Roos' cordial manner had paid dividends earlier in the tour after the game against Newport. South Africa beat Newport by a goal and a try to nil, and after the game the two team captains sat down at the Westgate Hotel for a post-match dinner. Roos asked Charlie Pritchard, the Newport skipper, how the Newport forwards, who were lighter than the South Africans, had stolen the ball away so many times in the scrums. The tactic, which the Welsh team had used to counter the famous New Zealand scrum, was discussed with great openness between Pritchard and Roos, and when the South Africans left the next day Roos shook Pritchard's hand at the train station and thanked him. This revelation became a controversial talking point when the Welsh press heard of it.\nThe match against Wales was set for 1 December 1906, and was played at St. Helen's Ground in Swansea. Wales selected a strong team, with Teddy Morgan and Johnnie Williams on the wings, and captained by talismanic three-quarter Gwyn Nicholls, who had come out of retirement to lead the Welsh. Roos started the match with heavy strapping to protect an injured shoulder, and several of his team were suffering from coughs and sore throats brought on by the British winter weather. Although the Welsh started at a fast pace, the South Africans soon began to launch their own attacks and the firm surface of the St. Helen's pitch played to the Springbok's strengths. Wales under performed throughout the game, and the Springbok tactic to tightly mark Nicholls and Rhys Gabe at centre prevented the pair's normal open game. South Africa scored three tries without reply, dominating the game 11–0. At the final whistle the South African supporters, assisted by Welsh fans, rushed onto the pitch and carried Roos from the field. Roos later stated that 'he considered it to be the greatest honour of his life to be borne triumphant from the ground by supporters of his beaten opponents'.\nA week later the South Africans faced England at Crystal Palace and Roos was fit enough to lead his team out against international opposition for the third time. Conditions for the match were poor; the pitch resembled a morass and a drizzle that began half an hour before the kick off continued throughout the game. After 20 minutes the ball was extremely difficult to handle and the backs from both teams found themselves unable to interact in the game with any real purpose. The game ended in a 3–3 draw, and Roos took the opportunity after the game to again address the legacy of the Boer War, proclaiming, \"...this tour will do far more to calm the troubled waters of South African life than years of legislation.\" Although a match against France was planned at the end of the tour, the game was not officially recognised, and the England encounter was Roos' final international game, ending with a record of played four, won three, drawn one.\nAs the tour headed towards its end, the South African's took control of the matches once again, beating Lancashire narrowly, but with decisive wins over Cumberland, Surrey and Cornwall. The team then returned to Wales for the last three games of the British leg of their tour. Continuing their impressive form, South Africa beat a Monmouthshire team and then Roos lead his team in a victory over Llanelli. The final game, before leaving for France, was against Cardiff, captained by Percy Bush. Several of the Cardiff players had represented Wales when the teams had met earlier in the tour, and amongst the Cardiff squad was Gwyn Nicholls, who had received much of the blame for the Welsh defeat. The conditions at the Cardiff Arms Park were worse than the England game, and after Roos lost the toss, the Welsh took advantage of the weather, using the wind to keep the ball behind the South Africans and choosing to dribble rather than handle the ball. The tour appeared to have caught up with the Springboks, who appeared slow, allowing Cardiff to score four tries without reply. For only the second time on the tour, the South Africans had been beaten, this time by a convincing 17–0 scoreline. At the after-match dinner at the Queen's Hotel in Cardiff, Roos stood to make a speech, \"It is only human to be disappointed in having been beaten... but I am glad for one man's sake that you had such a glorious success, and that is our friend Gwyn Nicholls.\"\nThe final match of the series was against a France XV, and was played at the Parc des Princes in Paris on 3 January 1907, just two days after the Cardiff defeat. Despite coming from a bad defeat played in sapping conditions, Paul Roos' team beat the French side 55–6.\nThe Springboks.\nIt was during the tour that the South African national rugby union team's nickname, \"Springboks\", was first used. At an impromptu meeting, the tour manager Cecil Carden, vice-captain Carolin and Paul Roos invented the nickname 'Springbok' to prevent the British press from inventing their own nickname. Roos told the newspaper reporters that they were to call the team 'De Springbokken', the Daily Mail then printed an article referring to the 'Springboks'. The trip helped heal wounds after the Boer War and instilled a sense of national pride in the South Africans.\nLater life.\nIn 1910 he became Rector of the Stellenbosch Boys' High School, formerly Stellenbosch Gymnasium, of which he was a former pupil and teacher. He held this post for thirty years and retired in 1940. In 1941 the name of Stellenbosch Boys' High School was changed to Paul Roos Gymnasium in his honour.\nHe was elected as a National Party member of parliament for Stellenbosch in 1948. He died on 22 September 1948."

        "title": "Beep baseball",
        "text": "Beep baseball is a form of baseball which can be played by people who are visually impaired, using a ball that beeps.\nNational Beep Baseball Association.\nThe National Beep Baseball Association (NBBA) was organized in the United States in 1976 for adults with visual impairments to play baseball. Each year, the NBBA coordinates local, state, and regional tournaments, among them the Indy Invitational in Indianapolis, Indiana; the Bolingbrook Beep Ball Bash (one of the first tournaments to offer a cash award) outside Chicago, Illinois; in some cases, a round robin tournament in Columbus, Ohio; and, more recently, a round robin tournament in the Philadelphia area. In August of each year, the NBBA sponsors a national and international invitational tournament. The 2007 World Series, as the August invitational is known, was held for the first time in a city that hosts no beep baseball team, Rochester, Minnesota. More recently, the World Series has been held in Columbus, Ohio, in 2004; Houston, Texas, in 2005; and Cleveland, Ohio, in 2006. The World Series was held in Taiwan in 2000.\nThe 2018 World Series took place in Eau Claire, Wisconsin and the 2019 event is scheduled for Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nOutside the United States.\nBeep baseball is said to have a \"strong following\" in France, Germany and Italy, and a taster event was organised at Farnham Park, England, in 2013 by BaseballSoftballUK.\nBasic rules.\nSetup and equipment.\nBeep baseball is played on a grass field with six fielders (generally a first-baseman, third-baseman, shortstop, left fielder, right fielder, and center fielder, although two-four defensive sets are not unheard-of) and one or two \"spotters\" from one team, and the pitcher, catcher, and batter from the other team. Fielders and batter are blindfolded. There is also a D.H. and D.F. (designated fielder). They must be legally blind, in most cases. However, the NBBA has a rule that, if a team cannot field the minimum six batters required to fill its lineup card, it may opt to allow up to two sighted volunteers to blindfold themselves and play as the players with visual impairments do. Catcher, pitcher, and spotters do not wear blindfolds and are usually sighted, although there have been a few who are partially blind. The ball beeps and is a modified, oversized softball. The bases are blue, nearly tall, and have mostly foam interior with electronics that cause it to buzz steadily when a switch is thrown. They are each placed from homeplate and are in the equivalent positions to first and third bases in regular baseball.\nRun scoring.\nWhen the batter hits the ball, a base operator turns on one of the two bases (first or third) for the batter to run to. If the batter touches the base before a fielder can pick up the ball, the offensive team scores a run. It takes four strikes for a batter to be out. If the ball goes beyond the two base lines or doesn't travel at least , it is foul and counted as a strike, unless it is the potential fourth strike, in which case the count holds and the batter just swings again. If a batted ball travels at least in the air over fair territory before settling, it is, upon declaration of the umpire, a home run. If the ball ceases to beep, or if it hits the pitcher, and becomes a \"dead ball,\" the count is reset and the batter swings again. A dead ball must not be touched. If it is, it is said to be back in play and the out must be recorded.\nSpotting.\nThe spotter or spotters call out a number to signify which part of the field a ball is traveling toward. Generally, the middle of the outfield is labeled 6, and either side, left and right, is numbered from 1 to 5 in a mirroring pattern. The spotter must not say anything beyond the numbered region on the field, and two spotters cannot make a call on the same play. If either case occurs, the run scores. The fielders head toward that section and listen for where the ball is specifically, often diving to the ground to get it. When a fielder picks up the ball before the batter reaches the base, the batter is out. In the rare event that a fielder catches the ball in the air before it touches the ground or other items, the side is automatically retired and the next half-inning commences. The spotter must also watch to ensure that nobody collides.\nInnings.\nBeep baseball generally has six innings. The extra innings rules used in Major League Baseball generally apply to beep baseball. If one team is up by twelve or more runs, the other team has the opportunity to have short innings in which the losing team bats every inning and the winning team fields. This is known as the twelve-run rule; when it occurs, one team is said to \"twelve-run\" another. If the other team makes up the difference, the team that had been winning gets back all their missed at-bats.\nThere are no age- or gender-based restrictions in beep baseball; people as old as 70 and as young as 12 have played.\nTeams.\nSeveral teams (over 200 teams, example of close to 50 since 2008, both past and present, some renamed) are:"

        "title": "Cricket Club of India",
        "text": "Cricket Club of India (CCI) is a cricket club in India. It is located on Dinsha Wacha Road, in Churchgate of Mumbai, India. It was conceived as India's counterpart to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). It is considered one of the most prestigious clubs in the nation. The CCI uses the Brabourne Stadium for cricket games. It is affiliated to the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\nMembership is the same as for the Royal Willingdon Sports Club, Bombay Gymkhana and Breach Candy Club: closed, and only current members' children can attain it.\nHistory.\nOn 8 November 1933, the Cricket Club of India was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee with its registered office in New Delhi. The principal object of the company was to promote sports in general and cricket in particular throughout the country.\nThe promoters and some leading men who founded BCCI five years before were the promoters of the Club. Originally, life members, who were later termed as founder members, paid Rs 100 and ordinary members paid Rs 10 for entrance and an annual subscription of Rs 15.\nThe Cricket Club of India was also the birthplace of the famous Chinese-style dish Chicken Manchurian. Restaurateur Nelson Wang claims to have invented it at the request of a customer in 1975 while working as a cook at the CCI. \nBCCI's headquarters were within the CCI until 2007 when it was moved to its current location at the Cricket centre in the premises of Mumbai Cricket Association at the Wankhede stadium. Brabourne Stadium served as the primary home ground of the Mumbai cricket team until the construction of the Wankhede Stadium in 1974.\nFirst-class cricket.\nTeams representing the Cricket Club of India played 13 first-class matches between 1935 and 1958, most of them against touring teams. Nine of the matches were played at Brabourne Stadium.\nFacilities.\nThe CCI also houses in the Brabourne Stadium, which the club owns. The CCI is an affiliated member of the BCCI like any other state association, but unlike any one of them, does not conduct cricket in the state. \nMumbai Cricket Association, Maharashtra Cricket Association and Vidarbha Cricket Association conduct cricket in Mumbai and rest of Maharashtra respectively. The stadium has one of the best cricket pitches and grounds in the region. It also has tennis courts, a swimming pool, fitness centers, a billiards room, squash courts, badminton courts, table tennis tables, cafes, bars, a library, a reading room and a banquet hall. It is very difficult to get membership into this exclusive club.\nKingfisher Open.\nIn 2006 and 2007, the CCI tennis courts hosted the Kingfisher Airlines Tennis Open, an ATP Tour tournament, previously held in Shanghai from 1995 to 2004 and in Vietnam in 2005. Kingfisher Airlines were the official sponsors. The tournament was presented by the Government of Maharashtra, India. The tournament was played from 25 September 2006 to 2 October 2006.\nICC Champions trophy.\nThe Cricket Club of India Limited staged 5 matches of the ICC Champions Trophy in 2006 including the final between Australia and West Indies played on 5 November 2006.\n2013 ICC Women's world cup.\nThe Brabourne Stadium hosted the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup along with the MIG Cricket club in Bandra, Mumbai, the DREIMS ground and the Barabati Stadium both in Cuttack. The Brabourne Stadium hosted the final of the event, where Australia comprehensively beat the West Indies.\nMembership scam.\nIn 2013, an internal inquiry set up by the club concluded that at least 11 members had gained membership of the club in the previous three years through forgery, committed in collusion with a club insider. \nSeveral CCI members later revealed that the fraud was committed by accessing the files of deceased members, whose files were lying dormant, and replacing their personal details with those of the new members.\nThe Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai police arrested two businessmen, Ketan Thacker and Nimai Agrawal, in connection with the scam."

        "text": "Brian Smith (born 14 March 1954) is an Australian rugby league coach and former player. He was also the Football Manager for the New Zealand Warriors.\nSmith played for St. George from 1973 to 1974 and for South Sydney in 1975, 1976 and 1979, appearing in a total of 31 first grade games. However, Smith is best known as a coach, having been at the helm of Illawarra, where he took over for the 1984 season, before moving to Hull, St. George, Bradford, Parramatta, Newcastle and, most recently, the Sydney Roosters and the NSW Country side. Although Smith had a successful career in Australia, he fell short of becoming a premiership winning coach, being on the losing end of all four grand finals he coached in (1992 and 1993 with St George, 2001 with Parramatta and 2010 with Eastern Suburbs.)\nPlaying career.\nIn the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership, Smith played 14 first grade games for St. George in 1974, and 17 games for the South Sydney between 1975 and 1979, appearing in a total of 31 first grade games.\nCoaching career.\nNewtown.\nSmith began coaching in 1978, coaching the Newtown under 23s team. He then joined South Sydney in 1980, also as under-23's coach. He stayed there until the end of 1982 coaching the reserve grade team in that season.\nIllawarra Steelers.\nSmith began coaching first grade rugby league in the NSWRL competition in 1984, where he became coach of the Illawarra Steelers, where he remained until the end of 1987 season. Illawarra would struggle on the field during the early days earning Wooden Spoons under Smith's tenure in 1985 and 1986. While coaching Illawarra in 1986, Smith proposed using two referees. This did eventuate in 2009.\nHull F.C..\nFrom 1988 until 1990, Smith was coach of Hull F.C. in England's Championship., In season 1988-89 Hull progressed to the Premiership Final at Old Trafford ultimately losing to Widnes. Hull led the competition when Smith left in January 1991 and went on to win the Premiership Final in May.\nSt. George.\nSmith returned to Australia to coach St. George for the 1991 season. He took the club to consecutive Grand Finals in 1992 (in which his younger brother Tony played from the Dragons' interchange bench) and 1993, losing both to Wayne Bennett's Brisbane Broncos. Smith would remain at St George until 1995.\nBradford Bulls.\nSmith returned to England for two seasons 1995 and 1996 to coach the Bradford Bulls to the 1996 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London in front of 78,550 fans. For Smith it would be another final loss as Bradford went down to St. Helens 32–40. Bradford led the match 26-12 with just over twenty minutes left to play. Bradford would go on to win major trophies across the next decade including Challenge Cups, Grand Final Premierships and World Club Challenge Finals.\nParramatta Eels.\nReturning to Australia, from 1997 until mid-2006, Smith coached the Parramatta Eels. In his first season at Parramatta, he guided the club to their first finals series in eleven years. This was followed by three consecutive preliminary final appearances in 1998, 1999 and 2000 with the 1998 preliminary final being the most notable. With less than ten minutes to play, Parramatta lead Canterbury 18-2 until Canterbury staged one of the biggest comebacks in finals history to win the match 32-20 in extra-time. \nSmith took Parramatta to the 2001 NRL Grand Final in what was the Eels first Grand Final since their 4–2 win over Canterbury-Bankstown in 1986. The club had set numerous records throughout the season as they claimed the Minor Premiership. As of the 2024 NRL season, some of these records still stand. Facing Parramatta would be the Andrew Johns led Newcastle Knights. Parramatta were raging hot favourites to win the 2001 NRL grand final but four converted and unanswered tries to Newcastle in the first 24 minutes of the game was too big a lead for Parramatta to overcome. Newcastle would go on to hand Smith his third Grand Final loss with a 30–24 win in front of 90,414 at Stadium Australia.\nIn the 2005 NRL season, Smith would guide Parramatta to another Minor Premiership and were favourites to take out the premiership that season. However, the club would suffer a shock 29-0 loss against North Queensland in the preliminary final.\nSmith became the longest-serving coach for the Parramatta Eels before he resigned as coach on 15 May 2006, with assistant coach Jason Taylor taking over as caretaker coach for the remainder of the season. During this period, Parramatta won eight club championships and made seven appearances in the playoffs.\nBradford Bulls (return).\nSmith had a short spell with his former club Bradford in an advisory role during the summer of 2006.\nNewcastle Knights.\nIn 2007, Smith took up coaching duties with the Newcastle Knights. In July 2009, he signed a deal for the 2010 with the Sydney Roosters and obtained a release from the Knights. On 15 August 2009, Smith effectively quit the Newcastle club, with understudy Rick Stone to act as caretaker coach for the remainder of the season.\nSydney Roosters.\nFor the 2010 NRL season Smith took over as Sydney Roosters coach from Brad Fittler who had been sacked the previous year. At the 2010 Dally M Awards Smith was named coach of the year. The Roosters reached the 2010 NRL Grand Final but were defeated by Wayne Bennett's St. George Illawarra Dragons. The Sydney Roosters almost became the second club in NSWRL/NRL history to go from finishing with a wooden spoon to winning the premiership in the following year.\nSmith was sacked by the club with a year still remaining on his contract at the end of the 2012 NRL season, after the Roosters finished in 13th place with an 8–15–1 record.\nEngland.\nSmith also worked as an assistant coach for Steve McNamara for the English team in their 2010 Four Nations campaign.\nUnited States.\nIn 2013, he was briefly the head coach of the USA.\nWakefield Trinity.\nOn 31 May 2015, Wakefield Trinity Wildcats announced on Sky Sports coverage of the Magic Weekend ahead of their game versus Castleford Tigers that Smith had agreed to take up the position of head coach. Former coach James Webster put Smith in touch with the club via text message. He resigned from Wakefield on 8 March 2016.\nSerbia.\nIn 2015, Smith became a consultant at the Serbian Rugby League and assisted the Serbian national team in their 2016 Qualifiers in a bid to qualify for their first ever Rugby League World Cup.\nThailand.\nOn 8 February 2017, he coached a Thailand team in a 10–44 defeat to Hungary staged at Endeavour Sports High School, Sydney.\nPersonal life.\nSmith is the older brother of former Great Britain coach Tony Smith and is father of Keegan Smith, the strength and power coach at the Roosters, and Rohan Smith, the current head coach of Leeds Rhinos and a former coach of Tonga and assistant coach at Auckland Warriors, London Broncos, Newcastle Knights, Sydney Roosters and Gold Coast Titans."

There are three main types of bowling in the game fast, spin and swing. Fielding can be manual or automatic.\nDevelopment.\nBrian Lara Cricket has pseudo-3D graphics which appears to make the perspective change when playing the game. The sound effects in the game are digitised. The game included the NVR save feature which allowed games to be stored using a battery to supply power to the memory inside the cartridge. It also claims to have hundreds of frames of animation for each sprite."

        "text": "James Richard Thomson (February 23, 1927 – May 18, 1991) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. Thomson played nearly 800 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1945 to 1958 with the Toronto Maple Leafs and Chicago Black Hawks. Thomson was a member of four Stanley Cup championship teams with Toronto and also served as captain of the team. After helping to organize a players' association for the NHL players, Thomson earned the ire of Toronto Maple Leafs' owner Conn Smythe, after which Thomson vowed to never play again for the Maple Leafs. He was traded to Chicago in the off-season and he played one season in Chicago to finish his career. He then went into business. Thomson still holds the NHL record for the most assists in a season without a goal - 29 in 1947-48.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Winnipeg, Thomson was signed by the Toronto Maple Leafs and headed to Toronto at the age of 16 to play junior hockey with the St. Michael's Majors, a Leafs affiliate in the Ontario Hockey Association. After two seasons at St. Mike's, he spent most of the 1945–46 season with the Pittsburgh Hornets in the American Hockey League before joining the Maple Leafs on a full-time basis the next year. He won the Stanley Cup with Toronto in 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1951. He and teammate Gus Mortson were known in Toronto as the \"Gold Dust Twins\".\nAt the beginning of the 1956–57 season, Thomson was named team captain, succeeding veteran Sid Smith who gave up the title after his offensive production plummeted during his one season as captain the previous year. Thomson's time with the \"C\" would be brief, as it was handed back to former captain Ted Kennedy when he made a comeback after retiring at the end of the 1954–55 season.\nThat same season, Thomson became one of the leaders of Ted Lindsay's attempt to have a players' association formed, hoping to improve players' conditions and especially to improve player pensions. Thomson was secretary–treasurer of the association and led the organizational drive within the Maple Leafs, which resulted in every member of the team except Kennedy wanting to join the association. Thomson's activities didn't go over well with Maple Leafs' president Conn Smythe, who called him disloyal, revealed his salary dating back to junior, and took him off the team during the season. At the end of the season, Thomson announced to the press that he had played his last game for Smythe and would never play hockey for Toronto ever again. During the off-season, he was sold to the Chicago Black Hawks after twelve years with the Maple Leafs. Lindsay was also traded to Chicago at the same time.\nThomson played one season in Chicago and retired in 1958 at age 31. He accepted work at his father-in-law's coal and oil company while playing for the Maple Leafs and went into the business full-time following his playing career. Thomson died of a heart attack in 1991."

An Open Division World Championships has been contested biennially since 1964, a Junior World Championships since 1980, a Masters World Championships since 2007 and a Stand Up Paddle World Championship since 2011.\nRecognition as governing body of surfing.\nIn 1982 the SportAccord, formerly known as General Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF), recognized the ISA as the world's governing body of surfing. in 1995 the International Olympic Committee granted the ISA provisional recognition. ISA was admitted into the Olympic movement at 1997 when the recognition was confirmed by the IOC.\nInternational Surfing Association (ISA) is a Member of:\nMission.\nThe ISA's mission is to make a better world through surfing, which it does through crowning World Champions, surf and SUP instructor certification, worldwide membership, grassroots development, and annual scholarships awarded to surfers in need.\nOlympic Surfing.\nOlympic Bid.\nThe organizing committee for the 2020 Games in Tokyo announced on 22 June 2015 that surfing was among the sports shortlisted for inclusion at the 2020 Summer Olympics. On 3 August 2016, during the 129th IOC Session at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, the IOC unanimously voted to include five new sports, among them surfing, to the sports program of the Tokyo 2020 Games.\nSurfing was included in the Tokyo 2020 Games on a one-off basis, and the ISA now has shifted their focused towards securing surfing's inclusion in the next editions of the Olympics, including Paris 2024 and LA 2028.\nOlympic Qualification Process.\nOn 16 March 2018, the International Surfing Association (ISA) welcomed the release by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) of the approved qualification system for Surfing's Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020, ensuring the participation of the world's best professional surfers as well as promoting universal opportunities for surfers from around the world at the Games.\nThe key elements of the qualification system are as follows:\nThe hierarchical order of qualification are as follows:\nTo see the full Qualification Process for Surfing in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, click here.\nISA World Events.\nThe ISA runs world events across all disciplines of surfing. ISA world events include:\nISA World Surfing Games.\nThe ISA World Surfing Games is an Olympic style team competition that gathers National Delegations from around the world. Each team can field up to three men and three women. The surfers compete for individual medals and the coveted Fernando Aguerre World Team Trophy, named for and donated by the ISA President.\nThe event was first held in 1964 in Manly, Australia under the name 'ISA World Surfing Championships.'\nStemming from the global growth of Surfing spurred by inclusion in the Olympic Games, the 2017 edition of the ISA World Surfing Games broke the record for country participation. The previous record was set in 1996 when 36 nations graced the shores of Huntington Beach, USA, but in Biarritz 47 countries competed, shattering the record.\nMany nations had representation in the event for the first time in history in 2017, including Afghanistan, China, Chinese Taipei, Greece, Senegal and South Korea.\nISA World Junior Surfing Championship.\nThe ISA hosted its first World Junior Surfing Championship in 1980 in Biarritz, France, where legendary surfer Tom Curren became the first ISA World Junior Champion, helping to launch his successful career. The event was held as a division of the ISA World Surfing Games until 2003, when it was held as a stand-alone event for the first time in Durban, South Africa.\nHistorically, the ISA World Junior Surfing Championship has served as a glimpse into the future stars of the sport. Past ISA World Junior Champions include the 2014 WSL Champion Gabriel Medina (BRA, 2010), Tatiana Weston-Webb (HAW, 2014, 2013), Filipe Toledo (BRA, 2011), Tyler Wright (AUS, 2010, 2009), Alejo Muniz (BRA, 2008), Laura Enever (AUS, 2008), Sally Fitzgibbons (AUS, 2007), Julian Wilson (AUS, 2006), Owen Wright (AUS, 2006), Stephanie Gilmore (AUS, 2005, 2004), Matt Wilkinson (AUS, 2004), Jordy Smith (RSA, 2003) and Leonardo Fioravanti (ITA, 2015).\nISA World Adaptive Surfing Championship.\nThe ISA World Adaptive Surfing Championship was created to give surfers with physical challenges an opportunity to compete and display their talents in a Paralympic-style, world-class competition.\nThe event has experienced unprecedented growth since the inaugural edition in 2015. The World Championship has spurred growth of the sport around the world, with nations such as France, Australia, Chile, Brazil, USA, Hawaii and South Africa holding National Championships of their own to select their National Teams to bring to California.\nThe 2017 edition shattered participation records with 109 athletes from 26 countries, more than a 50% increase from the inaugural edition of the event in 2015.\nISA World SUP and Paddleboard Championship.\nThe ISA World SUP and Paddleboard Championship is an Olympic-style, team competition that combines the disciplines of SUP Surfing, SUP Racing and Paddleboard Racing.

The event was first held in Peru (2012, 2013), with following editions held in Nicaragua (2014), Mexico (2015), Fiji (2016), and Denmark (2017).\nThrough development programs, scholarships for young SUP athletes, and promoting Championships at the national level, SUP has experienced explosive growth under the ISA's guidance, which can be observed in the participation levels seen in the World Championship that have nearly quadrupled since its inception.\nThe ISA presented both Surfing and SUP to the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee for inclusion in the Olympic Sports Program. Tokyo 2020 only elected Surfing to be included in the Games and not SUP, however achievements such as inclusion in the 2019 Pan American Games and 2017 Central American Games have added momentum to the ISA's push for inclusion in the 2024 Olympics.\nExecutive committee.\nThe ISA Executive Committee is composed of the ISA President, ISA Executive Director and four Vice Presidents. Its mission is to define ISA strategies and plans of action, “For a Better Surfing Future.” The executive committee works with the ISA staff throughout the year to develop future plans.\nCurrent Executive Committee (as of April 2018):\nISA Athletes' Commission.\nOn 24 April 2018 the ISA announced the formation of a new Athletes’ Commission to ensure that athletes’ opinions are heard at the highest level of governance in Surfing, StandUp Paddle (SUP), and all surf-related disciplines.\nFrance's Justine Dupont, who has medaled across three ISA disciplines (Shortboard, Longboard, and SUP), has been appointed the Chair of the commission.

It was opened to entries from overseas in 1964, and that year Washington-Lee High School (United States) became the first overseas crew to win the event, beating Groton School, USA, in an all-American final.\nThe inauguration of this race coincided with future queen Princess Elizabeth's first visit to the regatta, and so permission was given to name the trophy \"The Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup\".\nThe PE (as it is usually abbreviated) is one of only a few races in the regatta which does not allow composite crews to be entered, and as such each race is a straight competition between one club and another. As the most prestigious race of the school rowing year, the event attracts strong competition both from the UK and abroad. For British crews, winning the PE can be the final victory needed to win “the triple\", a prestigious achievement which comprises winning the Schools' Head of the River Race, The National Schools Regatta and finally the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup, all in the same year. The \"triple\" was first achieved in 1978 by Eton College who have subsequently achieved it a further six times (1990, 1991, 1995, 2005, 2009 and 2010). Other winners of the triple are St. Edward's School in 1984, Hampton School in 1985, 1986 and 1988, Abingdon School in 2002 and 2012, and St Paul's School (London) in 2018. Both St Pauls and Eton have also achieved a so-called \"quadruple\" by additionally winning the Youth Eights at the Head of the Charles Regatta; Eton in both 2008/09 and 2009/10 and St Paul's in 2017/18.\nOf British entries, Eton College have won the PE a total of 15 times, St Paul's School (London) 7 times, St. Edward's School 5 times, and Abingdon School, Bedford School, Hampton School, Pangbourne College and Shrewsbury School have each won the event 4 times.\nRadley College are the most frequent losing finalists having done so on 7 occasions, followed by Eton College and St Paul's School on 6 occasions. Hampton School and St. Edward's School have been the losing finalists on 4 occasions. Westminster School, The King's School Canterbury and Oundle School share the record for the most losses (4) in finals without having ever won the event.\nThe PE was opened to international crews in 1964, since when American crews have won the event 14 times (and been losing finalists 19 times), Canadian crews 7 times (losing finalists 3 times), and Australian crews 3 times (losing finalists twice). Ridley College (Canada) remain the most successful North American school in the event having won the PE 5 times in the 1970's. Holy Spirit High School, USA and St.Paul's School, Concord, USA have both won the event 3 times, St.Paul's School, Concord, USA also having been losing finalists on 4 occasions. The Australian school to have won the event most recently was Scotch College, Melbourne in 2017.\nAt the 2023 regatta, the rules for the PE were changed to allow junior crews from clubs as well as schools to enter the event.\nWinners.\nSee table below.\nRecord times.\nThe record holder for the event is St Paul's School (London), having finished the course in 6 minutes 06 seconds in the final against Eton College in 2018.

        "title": "1909 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1909 Tour de France was the seventh edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 5 July to 1 August. It consisted of 14 stages over , ridden at an average 28.658 km/h. The results were computed by points accorded finishing positions on each stage, the rider with fewest points at the end of the race winning the race. The stages were approximately the same as in the 1907 and 1908 Tour de France.\nBecause Lucien Petit-Breton, the winner of the Tour de France in 1907 and 1908, did not enter, the runner-up of 1908, François Faber, was the favourite. Faber went on to win six of the 14 stages and won the race easily.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe 1909 Tour de France was again decided by the point system: the winner of a stage received one point, the second placed cyclist two points, and so on. The cyclist with the fewest points at the end of the race was the winner.\nAfter the eighth stage, the classification was cleaned up, by removing the cyclists from the result of the previous stages and recalculating the points of the remaining cyclists. This happened again after the thirteenth stage.\nIn 1908, the cyclists had to use Tour-supplied frames; this rule was abandoned in 1909. The bicycles were still marked with a stamp, to ensure that the riders only used one bicycle.\nFor the first time, cyclists could enter the race in teams, although technically they were still considered sponsored individuals.\nIn the previous Tours, the Tour organisation had become embarrassed by cyclists urinating in front of spectators, so at the check points obligatory bathrooms were installed.\nTeams.\nThe winner of the previous two editions, Lucien Petit-Breton, was not competing in 1909. Petit-Breton expected his former teammate François Faber, who had become second in 1908, to win the race. Faber had transferred from the Peugeot team, that had dominated the 1908 edition, to the Alcyon team.\nA new record of 150 cyclists started the race. The previous Tours had been successful, and similar races were initiated in other countries (most notably the Tour of Belgium, which started in 1908 and the Giro d'Italia, which started in 1909). The Tour de France was still the major race where the best cyclists came, and it was the first large-scale invasion of foreign stars. In total, 19 Italians, 5 Belgians, 4 Swiss, 1 German and 1 Luxembourgian started the race.\nBecause cyclists could enter the race as sponsored cyclists, there were two classes of cyclists: cyclists with sponsors and cyclists without sponsors. There were seven different sponsors in the race (Nil–Supra, Alcyon, Biguet–Dunlop, Le Globe, Atala, Legnano and Felsina), with three to six cyclists. The majority of the cyclists, 112 in total, were not sponsored but were in the \"Isolé\" class, the class for cyclists without a sponsor.\nRace overview.\nThe 1909 Tour de France was considered the most difficult one so far, because of the cold temperatures, the rain and snow. The first stage was won by Belgian Cyrille van Hauwaert, the first Belgian stage victory ever. As a result, he was leading also the race, the first time in the Tour de France history that a non-Frenchman was leading the race. François Faber, the pre-race favourite, finished in second place.\nDuring that first stage, the weather had been reasonable, but at night the storm started. Faber was best fit to those conditions, and he won the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th stage, this record of five stages in a row has not been broken since. In stage two, Faber broke away halfway the stage, and rode the last 200 km alone. In the third stage (at a temperature of only 4 degrees Celsius), Faber's chain broke in the last kilometre, and he had to run his bicycle across the finish line. In the fifth stage, Faber was blown of the road by a strong wind, but remounted. Later, he was knocked down by a horse that also kicked his bicycle away. Faber remounted again, and won the stage with a five-minute margin. In the sixth stage, 20,000 fans had come to see Faber win his fifth stage in a row, which he did. The 7th stage was won by Ernest Paul, Faber's half brother. Because of the bad weather, already 50 cyclists (1/3 of the field) had quit the race at that point.\nThe Tour organisers asked Faber to calm down, in order to keep the Tour exciting. His team leader agreed and Faber slowed down and let others win stages; his leading position was never endangered.\nIn the ninth stage, Faber finished in 10th place at 46 minutes from the winner, his worst performance of the race. He was still leading the race with 26 points, whereas second placed cyclist Garrigou had 40 points.\nIt seemed impossible to beat Faber in this Tour, and the question became who would finish in second place. Gustave Garrigou was in second place, but Jean Alavoine was getting close to him. Garrigou had more experience, and remained second.\nIn the fourteenth stage, Jean Alavoine was leading when his bicycle broke, with only 10 km to go. Changing bicycles was not allowed, so Alavoine ran the last 10 km with his bicycle on his shoulders, and still won the stage with a margin of 6 minutes and 30 seconds.\nResults.\nThe Alcyon-sponsored cyclists dominated the 1909 Tour de France, winning 13 out of 14 stages. Only the 7th stage was not won by a cyclist sponsored by Alcyon, but by Ernest Paul, without sponsor.\nGeneral classification.\nThe general classification was calculated by points: at every stage, the winner was given one point, the next cyclist two points, etc. After the eighth stage, when only 71 cyclists were still in the race, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining cyclists, in accordance with their positions in those stages. Of the 150 starting cyclists, 55 finished.\nFrançois Faber is one of the youngest Tour de France winners in history at only 22 years and 7 months; as of 2019, only Henri Cornet in 1904 was younger (19 years and 11 months).\nOther classifications.\nSixth-placed Ernest Paul became the winner of the \"isolé\" category.\nThe organising newspaper l'Auto named François Faber the \"meilleur grimpeur\". This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification."

        "title": "1911 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1911 Tour de France was the ninth edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 2 to 30 July. It was composed of 15 stages over , ridden at an average speed of 27.322 km/h. The results were computed by giving each rider points according to his finishing position on each stage, and the rider with the fewest points at the end of the race won the overall competition. It was a gruelling tour, with the longest stage, 470 km long, taking almost 18 hours for the fastest riders to complete. Out of the 84 riders who started the tour, only 28 completed the race. After the introduction of the Pyrenees in the previous edition, in 1911 the Alps were first visited; for this addition, the 1911 edition has been named the first modern Tour.\nNewcomer Paul Duboc won four stages and was close to winning the Tour, but he fell sick midway through the race while he was in second place in the general classification. The winner was Gustave Garrigou, who also won two stages.\nInnovations and changes.\nIn 1910, the Tour de France included the Pyrenees mountains for the first time. That was a success, so in 1911, the Tour organisers also included the Alps. The favourite mountain of the Tour organiser Henri Desgrange was the Col du Galibier, about which he wrote \"O, col Bayard, O, Tourmalet... next to Galibier you are worthless.\" During the 1910 Tour, cyclists had protested against the inclusion of high mountains, but at the 1911 Tour, all important cyclists were present.\nWhat did not change was the points system; similar to the 1905–1910 Tours, this race was decided on points. A cyclist received points, based on their rankings. As in 1910, the points system was \"cleaned up\" two times: after the ninth stage and after the 14th stage. Cyclists who had abandoned the race were removed from the rankings of the previous stages, and the classification was recalculated.\nSince 1906, the Tour de France had crossed the German border into Alsace-Lorraine. After 1910, the German authorities did not allow this any more, so the Tour stayed in France.\nTeams.\nAs in the year before, there were two categories of riders. The best riders started in sponsored teams; there were four different teams, with 37 riders in total. The stages had checkpoints where riders had to sign, and on these checkpoints, the sponsored riders were allowed to be given food and drinks. The other category consisted of 47 isolated riders; they were not allowed to be given food or drinks during these checkpoints.\nThe previous edition had been a close battle between teammates Octave Lapize and François Faber from the Alcyon team, won by Lapize. Lapize had changed teams to the La Française team, where he was joined by former winner Lucien Petit-Breton (winner in 1907 and 1908). Petit-Breton was a late replacement for Cyrille van Hauwaert, who was not feeling healthy enough to ride the Tour.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage was won by Garrigou, a teammate of Faber at Alcyon. In that first stage, Petit-Breton had to leave the race after a series of unfortunate events. The Alcyon team also won the second stage with Masselis. The third stage was won by Faber, after a 206 km solitary breakaway. During that stage, Émile Georget was leading when he was hit by a car and fell down a ravine. In the same stage, Faber had passed a checkpoint without signing, and as a penalty he had to stop for two and a half minutes. Despite this, he still won with an advantage of 17 minutes, and took the lead in the general classification.\nIn the fourth stage, Garrigou took back the lead from his teammate Faber. At that point, Faber became insecure, as he knew that Garrigou was a good climber, while the big Faber had troubles in the mountains.\nIn the alps, Georget was the best. Garrigou finished well before Faber, and was now leading by 10 points.\nThe sixth stage, with only small mountains, was won by Faber, after a 260 km solitary breakaway, but because Garrigou came in second, he was still in the lead. In third place was Paul Duboc, a surprising newcomer.\nDuboc was the strongest in the eighth stage, and after his stage victory, he was in second place in the general classification. In the ninth stage, Faber lost contact with Garrigou in the general classification by finishing in twentieth place. Duboc won again, and had shown that he was a good climber, and was considered a favourite for the tenth stage which also included mountains, and a serious threat for Garrigou in the general classification; after this stage, Garrigou was leading with 27 points, while Duboc had 37 points. In that ninth stage, Maurice Brocco who knew that he would not win the Tour, had sold his services to another cyclist. He was removed from the race by Tour organiser Desgrange, who was against cyclists helping each other. Brocco objected against this decision, and pending the decision he was allowed to start the tenth stage from Luchon to Bayonne. In that tenth stage, Brocco attacked and finished first. After the stage, his appeal was rejected and he was removed from the race. Also in the tenth stage, Duboc collapsed just before Bayonne, probably due to food poisoning, attributed to a spiked drink. At that moment, he was leading the stage, eight minutes before the next cyclist. According to the rules, no help was allowed, so other cyclists rode by him while he was lying on the road, vomiting. Duboc was able to get on his bicycle again, and finished the stage in 21st place, which left him no hopes for the victory. Nowadays, it is thought that François Lafourcade, a cyclist who performed well in the mountains of the 1910 Tour had something to do with it, but in 1911, the first suspect was his main competitor Garrigou. Garrigou was threatened, and the Tour organisation gave him a bodyguard, and when the Tour passed Duboc's home town, Garrigou was disguised.\nDuboc regained his strengths and won two more stages, but was unable to close the gap to Garrigou in the general classification, so Garrigou became the winner of the race. At the end of the race in Paris, Duboc received a large welcome, overshadowing Garrigou. The pre-race favourites had already abandoned early in the race — 1907 and 1908 winner Petit-Breton in the first stage and 1910 winner Lapize in stage four. The winner from 1909, Faber, lasted longer, but he gave up during stage twelve.\nResults.\nGeneral classification.\nOf the 84 starting cyclists, 28 finished. The winner, Gustave Garrigou, received 5000 francs for his victory.\nOther classifications.\nThirteenth-placed Paul Deman became the winner of the \"isolés\" category.\nThe organising newspaper l'Auto named Paul Duboc the \"meilleur grimpeur\". This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification."

        "title": "1920 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1920 Tour de France was the 14th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 27 June to 27 July. It consisted of 15 stages over , ridden at an average speed of . It was won by Belgian Philippe Thys, making him the first cyclist to win the Tour de France three times. The Belgians dominated this Tour: 12 of the 15 stages were won by Belgians, and the first eight cyclists in the final classification were Belgian.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe 1919 Tour de France had been more difficult than before because of the influence of World War I on the roads and the cyclists, but in 1920, things were going back to normal, although the overall speed was only marginally higher than in 1919, the slowest Tour de France in history. In 1919 only 67 cyclists started the race, but in 1920 this had increased to 113. Although the war was over, the cycling companies were not yet able to sponsor the cyclists in the way they did before the war, so they again bundled their forces under the nickname La Sportive. The cyclists were divided in two categories, this time named \"1ère classe\" (first class), the professionals, and \"2ème classe\" (second class), the amateurs.\nThe 1920 Tour de France used the same formula as since 1910, that would also be used until 1924: fifteen stages, in total around 5000 km, around the perimeter of France, starting and finishing in Paris. In 1919, Philippe Thys had been in poor physical condition, and he did not even finish the first stage. He was ridiculed in the newspaper, and trained hard in the winter to be in better shape in 1920.\nParticipants.\nThere were 138 cyclists signed up for the race, of which 113 started the first stage. 31 of those were in the first class, the other 82 in the second class.\nFavourites were Eugène Christophe, Louis Mottiat, Philippe Thys, Gaetano Belloni, Jean Alavoine and Henri Pélissier.\nRace overview.\nThe 1920 Tour de France is described as a boring race. The weather was extremely hot, and after four stages already 65 of the 113 cyclists had quit.\nFrench favourites stopped the race early. Eugène Christophe in the 7th stage because of back pain, Jean Alavoine in the 2nd stage and Francis Pélissier in the 3rd stage. Henri Pélissier started well by winning the third stage and the fourth stage, and was the main threat for Philippe Thys who was leading the race. Then, in the 5th stage, Henri Pélissier was penalised with two minutes for throwing away a flat tire illegally. Pélissier objected to the penalty, and immediately left the race. Henri Desgrange mentioned that Henri Pélissier was not tough enough, and would never win the Tour de France. He would later win the 1923 edition.\nThe first five stages finished in a group, and multiple cyclists were leading the race with the same aggregate time. In fact, twelve of the fifteen stages finished with a group. Tour organiser Henri Desgrange did not like this, as he wanted the cyclists to ride as individuals. Thys was leading the race after the fifth stage, in the same time as Émile Masson.\nIn the sixth and seventh stage over the Pyrenees, Thys rode economically. He kept close to cyclists who could be a threat, but did not ride away. After those two stages, he led with almost half an hour before Hector Heusghem. The next stage he won, half an hour before Heusghem, so now his lead was one hour. Although Heusghem won stage nine, he did not win back any time on Thys who finished third in the same time.\nThe yellow jersey had been introduced already in 1919, but in 1920 the organisation had not awarded the jersey in the first eight stages. After Thys was still leading in stage nine, he received the yellow jersey. Tour organiser Desgrange was so unhappy with the lack of battle in the race, that he wanted to stop the race after the tenth stage, but was convinced to let the race continue.\nThe Belgians had dominated the race. Honoré Barthélémy was the best French cyclist at the eighth place. He had many falls during the race, broke his wrist and dislocated his shoulder. Barthélémy turned his handlebars up, so he did not have to bend his back. When he reached Paris, the French crowd considered him a hero.\nThe race was won by Belgian Philippe Thys. Thys had been in every breakaway, finished in the top five in every stage, winning four stages and coming in second seven times.\nResults.\nIn each stage, all cyclists started together. The cyclist who reached the finish first, was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader. From the ninth stage on, the leader in the general classification was identified by the yellow jersey.\nGeneral classification.\nThe final general classification, calculated by adding the stages times, was won by Philippe Thys."

It is usually considered to be \"the world championship for clubs\". The tournament has been dominated by the Swedish and Russian teams.\nHistory.\nThe Bandy World Cup was held every year in Ljusdal in Sweden from 1974 to 2008, at the start of the bandy season in autumn. From 2009 it has been played indoors in Sandviken because Ljusdal was waiting for an indoor arena. The outdoor ices were too unpredictable because of the weather this time of the year, so for the 2009 cup the Federation of International Bandy demanded the cup should be played indoors. It was first decided to move the cup temporarily to Sandviken for two years, but when Ljusdal still had no indoor arena, a contract was made between FIB and Sandviken to host the cup in Sandviken up to and including 2013. It was agreed that if there was an indoor arena in Ljusdal in 2014, Ljusdal may apply to host the cup again.\nThe tournament was first held in 1974 and has been called the World Cup since 1980. The full name of the cup has changed over the years, partly because of different sponsors. The first two years it was called DAF-cupen, then Dex-cupen 1976–1979 and Dex World Cup 1980–1983. 1984–1985 it was simply called World Cup Ljusdal. 1986 SJ became sponsors, so it was SJ World Cup 1986–1998. Then Ljusdal World Cup until 2001 and since 2002 it has been known as the Bandy World Cup, in 2005 additionally as Polar Bandy World Cup, since 2006 as ExTe World Cup Bandy.\nThere is also a Bandy World Cup Women for women's teams."
