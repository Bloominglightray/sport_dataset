Club teams are different from varsity teams in that the school doesn't completely sponsor the teams' expenses and the teams are not eligible to play in the NCAA's College World Series.\nThe NCBA was founded in 2000 to provide a national structure for the existing club teams. It structures the conferences, runs the NCBA College World Series (its national championship series), gathers playing statistics, assists teams in fundraising, and arranges for discounts on baseball clothing and equipment.\nThe NCBA is a division of CollClubSports which operates as a for-profit LLC with a sole proprietorship in the name of Greg \"Sandy\" Sanderson as President. Many club-sport governing bodies operate as non-profit groups in order to return the most benefit to member teams. League dues for the NCBA are $1,700 per season per team.\nThe two types of institutions that field club teams are schools that can't sponsor NCAA varsity baseball (often due to Title IX restrictions) and schools that do have a varsity team, but also have enough demand to field a second team.\nTeams.\nThe NCBA currently is divided into two divisions named Division I and II respectively. Division I is split up into eight regions with three conferences each. Division II is split up into eight districts with three conferences, each except Districts VI and VII which only have two conferences each.\nThere are currently nine schools that field both Division I and II teams:\nNCBA World Series Champions.\nDivision I appearances.\nNote: through the 2019 season."

Previously, he played in the United States Football League also as a punter for the Michigan Panthers and the Oakland Invaders. Before joining the USFL, he was expected to be a 1st-round-quality NFL draft pick, a strong hitter and blitzer who performed poorly at man-to-man coverage. He played in all 16 games for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1985, starting 10, but was cut early in training camp the next year due to inconsistency. He blamed this on burnout, having started in the Buccaneers' season opener only one week after leaving the Invaders.\nAwards.\nThe Sporting News All-League Team, 1983"

        "title": "Rugby union bonus points system",
        "text": "Bonus points are group tournament points awarded in rugby union tournaments in addition to the standard points for winning or drawing a match. Bonus points were implemented in order to encourage attacking play throughout a match, to discourage repetitive goal-kicking, and to reward teams for \"coming close\" in losing efforts. \nStandard system.\nThe most common point system is:\nIn this system, winning teams get 4 or 5 points; drawing teams 2 or 3 points; and losing teams between 0 and 2 points:\nVariant systems.\nFrance.\nThe French professional league, Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), uses a similar system in its two competitions, the Top 14 and Rugby Pro D2. After trialling the system in 2007–08, LNR adopted the new system permanently after that season.\nThe French system awards points in this manner:\nThis system prevents a losing team from picking up two bonus points in the same match, as is possible under the normal system. It also means that neither team earns a bonus point in a drawn match.\nAustralian NRC (2014–2016).\nFor its first three seasons from 2014 to 2016, the National Rugby Championship of Australia used a system somewhat similar to that of France:\nIn 2017 the NRC (including a team in Fiji) reverted to the standard scoring values of five points for a try, two for a conversion and three for a penalty or drop goal. The bonus point system therefore fell into line with the SANZAAR system widely adopted in that year.\nSANZAAR.\nIn 2016, Super Rugby in the SANZAAR countries of Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, also with a team in Japan, switched from the standard system to the original French system, i.e.\nSANZAAR extended this change to The Rugby Championship, contested by the men's national teams of its four member countries, in 2017.\nSix Nations.\nThe 2017 Six Nations Championship used the standard bonus points system on a trial basis, with the added feature that a team winning the Grand Slam would earn three extra bonus points to ensure that a grand slam winning team is guaranteed to win the tournament. Six Nations tournaments also award a bonus point to any team that scores four tries or more, regardless of the outcome, meaning that a losing team can score up to two points if they score four tries and lose by seven points or fewer.\nTables.\nBonus points are typically listed in the group standings table, as for example the BP column in 2015 Rugby World Cup Pool B:\nMore detailed tables may list losing-bonus points and tries-bonus points separately, as respectively the LB and TB columns in the 2015–16 European Rugby Champions Cup Pool 2 table:\nDetails.\nThis format was created for New Zealand's domestic competition, the National Provincial Championship, in 1995 and subsequently adopted in the inaugural Super 12 in 1996. It was first used at the Rugby World Cup in 2003, and has been the staple for international and club competition since.\nOther forms of rugby.\nRugby sevens, while still under the rugby union banner, does not use this system, and instead gives points for wins and draws. Sevens is a faster, more try-friendly game with a shorter time limit and a tendency to have runaway results. Sevens competitions are also usually one or two day affairs with an emphasis on the final bracket. All of this means there is little reason in using the bonus point system for the seven-a-side game. However, in the 2023–24 SVNS a losing bonus point was introduced for teams that were defeated by 7 points or less.\nRugby league has tried out similar bonus point systems in some competitions, but most competitions only give points for wins and draws. However, from 2007 season through to 2014, the Championship and League 1 (the two levels below Super League), primarily in England but also featuring teams in France and Wales during this time frame, gave 3 points for a win, 2 for a draw, and 1 for a loss by 12 points or fewer (this amounts to two converted tries in rugby league, which gives four points for a try instead of the five points awarded in union). This changed in the 2015 season when the points system was brought into line with that of Super League, thereby standardising the system across Britain's three professional Rugby League divisions, abandoning the bonus points system."

He is a former captain of the Albany Devils.\nPlaying career.\nLeach was drafted in the fifth round (115th overall) by the Phoenix Coyotes. After spending several years in minor hockey leagues, he signed as a free agent with the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins on September 26, 2003. While with the Bruins he appeared in his first two NHL games during the 2005–06 season, collecting no points and seven penalty minutes. Leach spent most of his time in the Bruins organization with their AHL affiliate in Providence. On July 3, 2007, he was signed as a free agent by the Tampa Bay Lightning. He played in two games for the Lightning during the 2007–08 season but spent most of the season in the AHL. On February 26, 2008 he was traded to the Anaheim Ducks. Later, during the summer of 2008 he signed with the New Jersey Devils. On November 6, 2009, Leach was claimed by the Montreal Canadiens on re-entry waivers from the Devils. On November 28, 2009, due to a high number of injuries to Canadiens forwards, Leach played forward instead of his usual defense position.\nLeach was claimed off waivers by the San Jose Sharks on December 1, 2009, and he played 28 games for the Sharks during the season. He recorded his first NHL goal in an 8 to 5 victory over the visiting Nashville Predators on March 11, 2010. He began the 2010–11 season playing for the AHL's Worcester Sharks, but on February 9, 2011, he was traded back to the New Jersey Devils along with Steven Zalewski in exchange for Patrick Davis and Mike Swift.\nCoaching career.\nLeach became an assistant coach with Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in 2014, helping the team in winning their sixth DEL Championship. On July 7, 2015, Leach was appointed as assistant coach to Mike Sullivan for the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, affiliate of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL. Leach was named interim head coach in December 2015 after Sullivan was promoted to be the head coach at Pittsburgh before settling into the position of associate head coach on a permanent basis to new Wilkes-Barre/Scranton head coach Clark Donatelli. Leach departed the Penguins after one season, eventually joining the Providence Bruins as an assistant coach on August 4, 2016. He would be promoted the P-Bruins head coach position prior to the 2017–18 season. In July 2021, the Seattle Kraken announced Leach as an assistant coach to Dave Hakstol for the Kraken's inaugural season. Leach is now looking for a head coaching job at a higher level. \nPersonal life.\nLeach is the nephew of both former NHL forward Stephen Leach and University of Maine hockey coach Jay Leach. He was married to Kathryn Tappen, an American sportscaster; they subsequently divorced."

It consists of teams representing the government and semi-government departments, corporations, commercial organisations, business houses, banks, airlines, and educational institutions.\nMatches in the competition were afforded first-class status in most seasons until 2006–07, when the domestic first-class competition was reorganised and merged into the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). From then on, the Patron's Trophy was a Grade II competition until a major reorganisation of domestic cricket in 2019 brought an end to the competition.\nFor the 2012–13 domestic season a new first-class competition, called the President's Trophy Grade I, was created for departments. It was announced as a renaming of the Patron's Trophy, and ran for just two seasons before the PCB merged the regions and departments back into a reorganised Quaid-i-Azam Trophy for the 2014–15 season.\nHistory.\nThe competition was founded in 1960–61 as the Ayub Trophy, named after then President of Pakistan, Ayub Khan. In 1970–71 the competition was renamed the BCCP Trophy, and two years later it received the title BCCP Patron's Trophy, recognising its purpose as a competition for departmental teams, as opposed to the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, which was primarily contested by teams from regional associations. A year later, in 1973–74, the Pentangular Trophy was introduced, contested by the leading teams from both competitions.\nThe President's Trophy has most often been contested by all departmental teams, but has been a mixed competition with regional associations and even all associations. Matches in the competition were afforded the first-class status until 2006–07 with the exception of between 1979 and 1983, and the 1999–2000 season. When it has not been a first-class competition, the Patron's Trophy has commonly acted as a qualifying competition for the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy by means of promotion and relegation. The competition was refounded as the President's Trophy from the 2023/24 season after a revamp of the domestic structure."

        "text": "Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2 is a tennis simulation video game developed by Now Production and published by Namco for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. It is the sequel to \"Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament.\"\nGameplay.\nThe game features many playable modes including Arcade mode and the in depth Pro tour mode in which you create a player and try to become a tennis champion. Other modes include Exhibition, Challenge and Tutorial. There are a range of courts one can play on, including those at the Australian Open (the old Rebound Ace courts), Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Along with various tennis characters, players can unlock characters from the \"Soulcalibur\" series (Cassandra Alexandra and Raphael Sorel) and \"Tekken\" series (Heihachi Mishima and Ling Xiaoyu).\nReception.\n\"Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2\" received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Ryan Davis of \"GameSpot\" said, \"PlayStation 2 owners should find plenty to like about Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2.\" \"IGN\"s Ed Lewis said of the game, \"Overall, it still isn't the best thing out there, but it's definitely a solid update and holds rather strongly by itself.\" One specific criticism of the game was that when entering the Davis/Fed-Cup styled 'World Tournament' as a player from a small nation, no realistic name generator was available for partners and other team members. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40."

        "title": "Jeff Locke (baseball)",
        "text": "Jeffrey Alan Locke (born November 20, 1987) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He previously played for the Miami Marlins and Pittsburgh Pirates, where he was an All-Star in 2013.\nEarly life.\nLocke is the son of Alan and Pam Locke and the grandson of Greta Locke. In 2003, his first year, he was a New Hampshire State Second-Team All-Star. In 2004, his second year, he was a New Hampshire State First-Team All-Star. In 2005, his junior year, he was the New Hampshire player of the year and a New Hampshire State First-Team All-Star. In 2006, his senior season, he was the New Hampshire player of the year, a New Hampshire State First-Team All-Star, co-captain of the Kennett High baseball team, and he shared the Jack Burns Baseball Award. In June 2006, Locke graduated from A. Crosby Kennett High School. Locke is the all-time leader in wins for Kennett High School.\nThe Redstone Rocket.\nLocke is nicknamed \"The Redstone Rocket\". In June 2006, \"The Conway Daily Sun\" sports editor Lloyd Jones established the nickname because of Locke's fastball, the name of his hometown (Redstone, New Hampshire, a village within the town of Conway, New Hampshire), and in reference to America's first man in space, Alan Shepard of Derry, New Hampshire, whose Freedom 7 flight was launched by a Redstone rocket.\nCareer.\nAtlanta Braves.\nLocke was the first selection in the second round in the 2006 Major League Baseball draft by the Atlanta Braves. Locke was assigned to the Gulf Coast Braves (Rookie League) upon signing with the organization on June 18, 2006. In June 2007 the Atlanta Braves assigned Locke to the Danville Braves in the Advanced Rookie Appalachian League. In November 2007, Baseball America ranked Locke No. 8 on their Atlanta Braves Top 10 Prospects list. Locke played for the Rome Braves in 2008. In December 2008, Baseball America ranked Locke No. 7 on their Atlanta Braves Top 10 Prospects list. Locke started the 2009 season with the Myrtle Beach Pelicans. On June 3, 2009, the Braves traded Locke to the Pittsburgh Pirates along with Charlie Morton and Gorkys Hernández in exchange for Nate McLouth.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nWhen Locke was acquired, the Pirates assigned him to their Class A Advanced affiliate, the Lynchburg Hillcats. In 2010, the Pirates took control of the Sarasota Reds and moved the team to Bradenton, where the club was renamed the Bradenton Marauders. Locke was assigned to the new team and was the starting pitcher in the team's second-ever game, against the Fort Myers Miracle on April 9, 2010. On July 14, 2010, Locke was promoted to the Pirates' Double A team, the Altoona Curve. In January 2011, Baseball America ranked Locke No. 8 on their Pittsburgh Pirates Top 10 Prospects list. In 2011, Locke pitched for Altoona and the Indianapolis Indians before being called up to the majors in September 2011. He made his MLB debut on September 10, 2011 against the Florida Marlins which resulted in a loss. He pitched a total of 4 games in 2011 for the Pittsburgh Pirates and went 0–3 with an ERA of 6.48 and 5 strikeouts. In November 2011, Baseball America ranked Locke No. 10 on their Pittsburgh Pirates Top 10 Prospects list. Locke recorded his first career win on October 1, 2012, giving up one run in six innings against the Atlanta Braves. In 2013, he was selected as an All-Star by San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy. Locke did not pitch in the game due to back stiffness.\nDespite making the 2013 All-Star team, Locke was demoted to the Pirates' Double-A affiliate Altoona Curve on August 28. Locke had a 2.15 ERA in his first 18 starts, but then had an 8.10 ERA over his next eight. Locke was also left off the NLDS roster.\nLocke was promoted from Altoona in a spot start on June 8, 2014 after Gerrit Cole was placed on the disabled list. After being recalled for the 2nd stint of the season Locke showed success, carrying a 2.13 ERA over his last seven starts before the 2014 All-Star Break, including a very dominant performance against his mentor, A. J. Burnett, where he picked up his second win of the season.\nIn 2015, Locke made 30 starts for the Pirates, going 8–11 with a 4.49 ERA.\nLocke began the season in the Pirates rotation, despite posting a record of 8–6, Locke's ERA stood at 5.54 and he was soon moved to the bullpen for the remainder of the season. On November 29, 2016, Locke was designated for assignment by the Pirates.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn December 12, 2016, Locke signed a one-year contract with the Miami Marlins. On the first workout day of spring training, Locke said he was feeling discomfort while tossing from 60 feet away. Locke's MRI came back clean, but on March 30, 2017 he was put on the 10-day disabled list. On June 1, 2017 Locke returned to the Marlins, and gave up one run over innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nOn July 3, 2017, against the St. Louis Cardinals, Locke surrendered 11 earned runs over 2.2 innings as the Cardinals beat the Marlins 14–6, bringing his ERA up to 8.16 for the season. In his career against the Cardinals, he had an 0–7 record. This also gave the Marlins a record of 0–6 in games started by Locke during the 2017 season. The next day, he was designated for assignment. Locke cleared waivers and was sent down to the Jupiter Hammerheads, the Marlins' Class A-Advanced affiliate, but never pitched for the team in a game.\nLocke sat out the 2018 season, dealing with a partially torn labrum in his shoulder. Although he received offers from multiple Major League teams Locke chose not to sign with another team until he felt fully healthy.\nPitching style.\nPrior to 2009, Locke used an over-the-head pitching delivery. Upon his trade to the Pirates, pitching coach Wally Whitehurst recommended that Locke change his pitching style to incorporate a turn toward first base. which would aid in deceptiveness. Locke returned to the overhead delivery during spring training in 2016, because he had gotten increasingly inconsistent results over the years by looking toward first base. Locke throws a two-seam fastball (88–95), a circle changeup (79–82), and a knuckle curveball (77–84). In 2016, Locke's knuckle curve has become more of a slurve."

The game was held on July 11, 1989, at Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California, the home of the California Angels of the American League. The game is noted for being the first in All-Star Game history to include the designated hitter. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 5–3. The game is remembered for Bo Jackson's monstrous lead-off home run to center field. Jackson was named the game's MVP. The game also featured former U.S. President and former baseball announcer Ronald Reagan sharing the NBC broadcast booth with Vin Scully for the first inning.\nThe pregame ceremonies featured Disney characters joining this year's players in sprinting onto the field for the introduction of the starting lineups. Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia Phillies, who had retired on May 29, was still elected by the fans as the starting third baseman for the NL All-Star team. Schmidt decided not to play, but he did participate in the game's opening ceremony in uniform. Doc Severinsen later led \"The Tonight Show Band\" in the playing of the Canadian and U.S. national anthems. Severinsen and The Tonight Show Band's performance of the U.S. National Anthem was the last non-vocal performance of the Anthem at the All-Star Game to date. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by longtime Angels coach Jimmie Reese.\nThis was the second All-Star Game to be played in Anaheim, which last hosted the Midsummer Classic in 1967. It would return to the by-now renovated and renamed Angel Stadium of Anaheim in 2010.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nGame summary.\nThe NL got off to a fast start off Dave Stewart in the first on RBI singles by Kevin Mitchell and Howard Johnson. The AL would counter in spectacular fashion in their half when game MVP Bo Jackson golfed the second pitch by Rick Reuschel, a low sinker, out in deep center. Wade Boggs followed with a homer to tie it.\nThe AL took the lead the very next inning when Jackson beat out a double play grounder, scoring Rubén Sierra. Jackson then stole second, making him the only player (to date) to have a home run and a stolen base in the same All-Star game. The AL expanded their lead to 5–2 in the third on RBI singles by Harold Baines and Sierra. The NL would get no closer than a run in the eighth when Von Hayes singled home Glenn Davis."

The aim of the league was to provide competitive cricket, with the hope of maintaining the interest of youngsters in the sport.\nThere were six original members of the league; Chew Magna, Chew Stoke, High Littleton, Nailsea, Whitchurch and Stanton Drew; and the first match took place on 19 April 1970 between Stanton Drew and Chew Magna. From these small beginnings, the league has grown, and now comprises over 80 teams, playing in 9 divisions.\nDue to this expansion, and the desire of teams to play on different days, in 2007 the divisional structure was reorganised into Saturday and Sunday conferences. In 2009 a Sunday Premier Division was introduced, which allowed teams from higher leagues (such as the West of England Premier League) to compete without unbalancing the rest of the divisions."

        "text": "The 1987 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1986–87 season, and the culmination of the 1987 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the Edmonton Oilers and the Philadelphia Flyers. The Oilers won the series 4–3, for their third Stanley Cup victory. This was the sixth of nine consecutive Finals contested by a team from Western Canada, the fifth of eight consecutive Finals contested by a team from Alberta (the Oilers appeared in six, the Calgary Flames in two, the Vancouver Canucks in one), and the fourth of five consecutive Finals to end with the Cup presentation on Alberta ice (the Oilers won four times, the Montreal Canadiens once). Game 7 of this series was played on May 31, which at the time was the latest finishing date for an NHL season. The record would be broken five years later when that series ended on June 1.\nPaths to the Finals.\nFor the third straight year, the Edmonton Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers finished the regular season with the two best records in the NHL. (In , the Flyers were first in NHL standings and the Oilers second; in both and , the positions were reversed.) While the Oilers' success came from their vaunted offense, the Flyers relied on grit, defensive play, and solid goaltending from Vezina Trophy winner Ron Hextall.\nThe Oilers cruised into the Finals with relative ease, losing only two games in the process. They beat the Los Angeles Kings in five games, swept the Winnipeg Jets, and then beat the Detroit Red Wings in five to win the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl for the fourth time in five years. The Flyers, meanwhile, had a much harder road. It took them six games to knock off the New York Rangers, went the full seven against the New York Islanders, and then beat Montreal, the reigning champion, in six to claim their second Prince of Wales Trophy in three years.\nGame summaries.\nThe Oilers and Flyers met in the Finals for the second time in three years. This time, Edmonton was the regular-season champion with 50 wins and 106 points, and Philadelphia was second with 46 wins and 100 points.\nThis was a rematch of the 1985 Stanley Cup Finals, where the Oilers beat the Flyers in five games. Unlike the 1985 Finals, this series went to seven games. Edmonton took the first two games at home, then split in Philadelphia. However, the Flyers won the next two games, one in Edmonton and one back in Philadelphia by one goal, to force a deciding seventh game. Edmonton won game seven to earn its third Stanley Cup in four seasons.\nDuring the Stanley Cup presentation, Oilers captain Wayne Gretzky would give the Cup to Steve Smith, who one year earlier scored on his own net a goal that led to their downfall against the Calgary Flames, their in-province rivals, in the Smythe Division Final. Ron Hextall would receive the Conn Smythe Trophy for his efforts.\nFor the first time in the Finals, both starting goalies, Hextall and Grant Fuhr, wore the full fiberglass cage mask which is now required across almost all levels of competitive hockey. Fuhr wore the original face-hugging fiberglass mask in his three previous Finals appearances before switching to the full cage in the 1985–86 season. Patrick Roy was the first goalie to wear the full cage in the Finals when he backstopped the Montreal Canadiens to victory vs. the Calgary Flames the previous year.\nMany people consider this to be one of the greatest Stanley Cup Finals of all time.\nGame one.\nWith the game tied at 1–1 after 40 minutes of play, the Oilers won thanks to third-period goals by Glenn Anderson, Paul Coffey, and Jari Kurri. Gretzky registered a goal and an assist in the onslaught as part of a 4–2 win. The Flyers outshot Edmonton 31–26.\nGame two.\nThis time, the Flyers led 2–1 after two periods. Despite matching the Oilers line for line and speed for speed, Edmonton burned Philly with a third-period goal, then on the game-winner by Kurri, who took advantage of some disorganized defensive play by the Flyers in overtime to score the game-winning goal with a wide-open chance in a 3–2 overtime victory.\nGame three.\nLooking to take a commanding 3–0 series lead, Edmonton came out firing, taking a 2–0 lead after one period on goals by Mark Messier and Coffey, then stretching it to 3–0 on Anderson's fluke breakaway goal 1:49 into the second.\nWith their backs against the wall, the Flyers began a comeback on second-period goals by Murray Craven and Peter Zezel. Early in the third, tallies 17 seconds apart by Scott Mellanby and Brad McCrimmon tied the game, then put the Flyers ahead 4–3. For the remainder of the period, the Flyers gamely kept the Oilers' potent offense at bay until Brian Propp's empty-net goal sealed a 5–3 win.\nUntil this point, no team had ever rebounded from a 3–0 deficit to win a game in the Finals, and the Flyers won their first-ever playoff game after yielding a game's first three goals.\nGame four.\nThe momentum from game three did not carry over for Philadelphia. Gretzky notched three assists as the Oilers won, 4–1, and took a three games to one series lead. In a relatively sedate affair, the most shocking event came when Flyers goaltender Ron Hextall viciously chopped his stick across the back of the legs of Edmonton's Kent Nilsson in the third period when trailing 4–1. Hextall was apparently incensed that Anderson and other Oilers had cruised through the goal crease untouched and unpenalized during the game, and took out his frustration on the last Oiler he happened to see skate by. Hextall's actions caused Nilsson no injury, but Hextall would be suspended for the first eight games of the season.\nGame five.\nEdmonton's newspapers had published plans for a future victory parade that day, and the Oilers tried to make those plans come to fruition when they beat Hextall for two quick first-period goals. Although the Flyers got one back and trailed 2–1 after one period, Hextall let Edmonton's third goal of the game, a tip-in by Marty McSorley with nearly two minutes gone in the second slip between his arm and body; time was growing short.\nFacing the end of their season, the Flyers clawed back and tied the game 3–3 on goals by Doug Crossman and Pelle Eklund. With almost six minutes played in the third, Propp fed Rick Tocchet in the slot for the go-ahead score. Hextall and the Flyers' defence clamped down on the Oilers the rest of the way and the series came back to Philadelphia.\nGame six.\nWith a chance to close out the series without the pressure of home ice, Edmonton took a 2–0 lead against a hesitant Flyers club on a disputed goal by Kevin Lowe and a stuffer by checking winger Kevin McClelland. The Oilers took control of the game in all aspects, outshooting Philly 15–5 in the opening 20 minutes. The Flyers had little chance until Lindsay Carson managed to thread a puck through Grant Fuhr's pads a little more than seven minutes into the second period. The Oilers kept the pressure on, and carried play into the third period. However, Anderson's careless high-sticking penalty with eight minutes left in regulation led to Propp's electric game-tying goal, snapping a shot high into the left corner of the net.\nEighty-four seconds later, little-used Flyer defenceman J. J. Daigneault stepped up to a dying puck inside the Oilers' blue line, and cranked the puck just inside the right post to give the Flyers a 3–2 advantage. Daigneault's goal stirred the Spectrum crowd to a frenzy providing what has been called the loudest moment in that arena's history, and the game is often nicknamed \"The Night the Spectrum Shook\". The only threat to that lead came with ten seconds left, when Mark Messier picked off Hextall's attempted clear, broke in, and took one shot into Hextall's pads and a second over the top of the net. Mark Howe knocked down a last-ditch Oiler effort at the buzzer, and the Finals headed to a seventh game for the first time since .\nGame seven.\nTwo unusual occurrences marked the opening of the game, which marked the first game 7 since 1971: the Flyers were awarded a two-man advantage one minute into the contest, and scored the first goal of the game for the first time in the Finals. Craven banked a shot off Fuhr's skate only 1:41 into the game for a 1–0 Philadelphia lead. The Flyers failed to score on the back half of the 5-on-3, and the Oilers came back six minutes later when Messier finished off a 3-on-1 with a backhander to tie the game. Kurri delivered a huge blow to Flyers victory hopes when he beat Hextall with quick wrist shot off a Gretzky pass at 14:59 into the second period, giving the Oilers a one-goal cushion. Edmonton poured it on late, outshooting the Flyers 13–6 in the middle 20 minutes and 12–2 in the third, finally getting an insurance goal on Anderson's 30-footer up the middle with 2:24 to play.\nPhiladelphia's Hextall, who had 40 saves in game seven, was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs MVP despite Edmonton's victory. His feat was the fourth time a Conn Smythe winner came from a losing team. He was preceded by Roger Crozier, goaltender with the Detroit Red Wings in , St. Louis Blues goalie Glenn Hall in , and Flyers right wing Reggie Leach in . Jean-Sebastien Giguere, also a goalie, would become the playoff MVP with the Finals-losing Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.\nThis is the most recent game seven in the Finals to have a lead change, or even a game-tying goal. All eight such games played since then (1994, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2019) had neither. This was also the last time that the champs would skate off with the Cup after winning the trophy. When the Oilers repeated the next year, they started the tradition in which everyone gathered around with the Cup in a team photo.\nBroadcasting.\nIn the United States, the series aired nationally on ESPN. However, ESPN's national coverage was blacked out in the Philadelphia area due to the local rights to Flyers games in that TV market. WGBS aired four games at the Northlands Coliseum while PRISM televised three games at the Spectrum.\nIn Canada, this was the first of two consecutive years that the English-language rights to the Cup Finals was split between the Global-Canwest consortium and the CBC. The CBC exclusively aired games one, two and six, while Global exclusively televised games three, four, and five. Game seven was then broadcast simultaneously by both networks, with each broadcaster using its own separate production facilities and on-air talent.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1987 Stanley Cup was presented to Oilers captain Wayne Gretzky by NHL President John Ziegler following the Oilers 3–1 win over the Flyers in game seven.\nThe following Oilers players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1986–87 Edmonton Oilers"

The Canadiens won the best-of-seven series, four games to one, to win their 23rd Stanley Cup, and their 17th in their last 18 Finals appearances dating back to .\nIt was the first all-Canadian Finals since Montreal lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in , the last year of the Original Six era.

It was contested between the defending champion Edmonton Oilers (in their third straight Finals appearance) and the Philadelphia Flyers. The Oilers won the best-of-seven series, four games to one, to win their second Stanley Cup. It was also the sixth straight Finals contested between teams that joined the NHL in 1967 or later. Until , this was also the last time that a team, defending champion, or runner-up appeared in the Finals for the third straight season. This was the fourth of nine consecutive Finales contested by a team from Western Canada, third of eight contested by a team from Alberta (the Oilers appeared in six, the Calgary Flames in and , and the Vancouver Canucks in ), and the second of five consecutive Finals to end with the Cup presentation on Alberta ice (the Oilers won four of those times, the Montreal Canadiens once). Game five of this series was played on May 30, which at the time was the latest finishing date for an NHL season. The record was broken two years later.\nPaths to the Finals.\nEdmonton defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3–0, the Winnipeg Jets 4–0, and the Chicago Black Hawks 4–2 to advance to the finals.\nPhiladelphia defeated the New York Rangers 3–0, the New York Islanders 4–1, and the Quebec Nordiques 4–2 to make it to the finals.\nGame summaries.\nThis was the first Stanley Cup Finals where games were scheduled for June. Had the series reached game six, it would have been played Sunday, June 2, with game seven on Tuesday, June 4. The NHL season would not extend into an actual June game until , due to a players strike.\nThis was the second and last Stanley Cup Finals to use the 2–3–2 format, long favored by Major League Baseball for its World Series and used from 1985 through 2013 for the NBA Finals. Since Edmonton went 6–0 at home during the 1984 and 1985 Finals, it was able to clinch in game five on home ice each time.\nWayne Gretzky scored seven goals in the five games, tying the record set by Jean Béliveau of the Canadiens in and Mike Bossy of the Islanders in . Grant Fuhr stopped two penalty shots. Jari Kurri scored 19 goals through the entire playoffs, tying the single-year record set by Reggie Leach of the Flyers in .\nThis was the last Stanley Cup Finals in which either starting goalie wore the old-style fiberglass mask. Both Fuhr and the Flyers' Pelle Lindbergh wore the face-hugging mask, which was introduced in 1959 by Jacques Plante. The backups, Edmonton's Andy Moog and Philadelphia's Bob Froese, wore the helmet-and-cage combination, similar to the one Billy Smith wore in leading the New York Islanders to four consecutive Cups from 1980 to 1983. The next year, the Calgary Flames' Mike Vernon sported a helmet-and-cage combo, and Montreal Canadiens rookie Patrick Roy wore a modern full fiberglass cage, the second goalie to sport that style in a Finals series after Gilles Meloche with the Minnesota North Stars in 1981. Fuhr switched to a full fiberglass cage the next season.\nThis was the first Stanley Cup Finals in which the NHL referee wore a helmet (Andy Van Hellemond). This occurred during Game 1.\nGame one.\nThe Flyers posted a 4–1 victory to open the series. Edmonton coach Glen Sather was reportedly so disappointed with his team's performance that he burned the game videotapes after watching them.\nGame two.\nWayne Gretzky's first goal of the series late in the second period snapped a 1–1 tie, and Dave Hunter added an insurance empty-netter and the Oilers drew even in the series with a 3–1 win.\nGame three.\nGretzky almost single-handedly won Edmonton the game. He scored twice within the first 90 seconds of the game, and finished off a hat trick by the end of the first period. Although the Oilers put only six shots on net over the final 40 minutes, it was enough to escape with a 4–3 win and 2–1 series lead.\nGame four.\nUnbowed, the Flyers leapt out to a 3–1 lead midway through the first period thanks to goals at even strength, on the power play and shorthanded. However, the Oilers roared back with four consecutive goals, including two from Gretzky, to win 5–3 and take a commanding series lead.\nGame five.\nAgainst backup goaltender Bob Froese, substituting for starter Pelle Lindbergh (who had been playing progressively less well over the course of the Finals), the Oilers blitzed the Flyers with a four-goal first period and sailed to a convincing 8–3 win. Gretzky and Kurri posted a goal and three assists each, while Paul Coffey and Mark Messier scored two goals apiece. Edmonton won its second consecutive Stanley Cup while the Flyers, at the time the youngest team in professional sports, took the lessons from their loss into the clubs' next Stanley Cup Finals; they lost again to the Oilers in , albeit in seven games. Wayne Gretzky won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, scoring a record 47 points this playoff year.\nBroadcasting.\nIn Canada, this was the first of two consecutive years that the English-language rights of the Cup Finals were shared between CBC and CTV. CBC televised games one and two nationally while games 3–5 were televised in Edmonton only. CTV televised games 3–5 nationally while games were blacked out in Edmonton. Had the series gone to a Game 7, then both CBC and CTV would have simultaneously televised it while using their own production facilities and crews. Dan Kelly, Ron Reusch, and Brad Park called the games on CTV.\nIn the United States, this was the fifth and final season that the Cup Finals aired nationally on the USA Network. Under the U.S. TV contracts that would take effect beginning next season, ESPN would take over as the NHL's American television partner. The USA Network would not air NHL games again until 2015 when it became an occasional overflow channel for NBC Sports' national coverage of the first two rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs.\nThe USA Network's national coverage of the 1985 Cup Finals was blacked out in the Philadelphia area due to the local rights to Flyers games in that TV market.

It was contested between the defending Campbell Conference champion Edmonton Oilers and the defending Wales Conference and Cup champion New York Islanders. The upstart Oilers won the best-of-seven series, four games to one, to win their first Stanley Cup, becoming the third post-1967 expansion team and first former World Hockey Association team to win the Cup, and also the first team based west of Chicago to win the Cup since the WCHL's Victoria Cougars became the last non-NHL team to win it in .\nIn the previous year's Stanley Cup Finals, the Islanders had swept the Oilers in four straight games. The teams met again in 1984, with the Islanders seeking their fifth consecutive Stanley Cup championship. While both teams had improved on their regular season records from the previous season, Edmonton had progressed more and finished with the best record in the NHL for the first time in their short history. However, it was New York who received home-ice advantage, as they had in since the rules in place since 1982 dictated that home-ice advantage \nwent to the conference that won the coin toss and in 1984 because the Wales Conference had more points in head-to-head play against the Campbell Conference. It was also the first time since the implementation of the 2–3–2 format the same year that a Game 5 was actually played in the same venue as Games 3 and 4 since the Islanders had swept the previous two Finals. This was the third time during the era during the era that the team with the worse record received a home-ice advantage, the other two being the 1968 and 1970. Home-ice advantage reverted to the team with the better record for the following Finals, and the Finals reverted to the former 2–2–1–1–1 format in the Finals after that.\nThis was the fifth straight Finals of teams that joined the NHL in 1967 or later. , the Islanders' four consecutive Cup wins (, , , 1983) and their appearance in the 1984 Cup Finals is an NHL record of 19 consecutive playoff series wins that currently stands unbroken. The 1984 Finals was the third of nine consecutive Finals contested by a team from Western Canada, second of eight contested by a team from Alberta (the Oilers appeared in six, the Calgary Flames in two, the Vancouver Canucks in one), and the first of five consecutive Finals to end with the Cup presentation on Alberta ice (the Oilers won four times at home, the Montreal Canadiens once in Calgary).\nThe Oilers became the fastest Canadian-based expansion team to win a major sports title by winning a title in only their fifth NHL season. The feat was eclipsed in 2016 by the Ottawa Redblacks, who won the Grey Cup in their third CFL season.\nPaths to the Finals.\nEdmonton defeated the Winnipeg Jets 3–0, the Calgary Flames 4–3 and the Minnesota North Stars 4–0 to reach the Finals.\nNew York defeated the New York Rangers 3–2, the Washington Capitals 4–1, and the Montreal Canadiens 4–2 to reach the Finals.\nGame summaries.\nNOTE: The 1984 Stanley Cup Finals were played in a 2–3–2 format, which the NBA Finals (1985–2013) and World Series (always) use, instead of the usual 2–2–1–1–1; however, the NHL would only use the format again the following season before going back to the 2–2–1–1–1 format for the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals.\nGrant Fuhr shut out the Islanders in the first game, on Long Island, with Kevin McClelland scoring the game's only goal, but the Islanders won game two 6–1. The series then shifted to Edmonton for three games. In game three, the Islanders had a 2–1 lead in the second period, but Mark Messier scored on an individual effort to tie the game. They proceeded to beat the Islanders 7–2. The Oilers, however, lost Fuhr for games four and five after the Islanders' Pat LaFontaine crashed into Fuhr on the forecheck during game three, and Fuhr was slow to get up. Andy Moog started games four and five. The Oilers won game four by the same score, with Wayne Gretzky scoring his first goal of the Finals. The Oilers then won game five by the score of 5–2 thanks to Gretzky's two first-period goals, and two Duane Sutter penalties.

It was contested by the Campbell Conference champion Edmonton Oilers in their first-ever Finals appearance and the defending Wales Conference and Cup champion New York Islanders, in their fourth consecutive and overall Finals appearance. The Islanders won the best-of-seven series, four games to none, to win their fourth consecutive and overall Stanley Cup championship.\nThis was the fourth straight Finals of post-1967 expansion teams. The Oilers, a former World Hockey Association (WHA) franchise, stunned NHL loyalists by reaching the Finals just four years after the NHL-WHA merger. The Oilers even had the better record of the two teams, although under the format in place since the previous Finals Edmonton received home ice advantage on account of being the Campbell champion, which at the time received that advantage in odd numbered years.\nThis is also the most recent time that an NHL team has won the Cup four years in a row, and also the first (and, to date, only) time a North American professional sports team has won four consecutive titles in any league competition with more than twenty teams. Even if this standard is lowered to encompass league competitions of at least sixteen teams, the Islanders are still only the third and most recent franchise to accomplish such a dynasty after the New York Yankees in Major League Baseball (who have forged two such World Series dynasties - the first in the 1930s and the second in the 1950s) and the Montreal Canadiens (whose own such dynasty immediately preceded the Islanders' prior to the merger with the WHA).\nSince 1983, no professional sports team on the continent has won four consecutive championships and no NHL team has won more than two consecutive championships (most recently the Tampa Bay Lightning in and ). This was the second of nine consecutive Finals contested by a team from Western Canada and was the first of eight consecutive Finals contested by a team from Alberta (of which the Oilers played in six and the Calgary Flames in two). Although it was not the first Stanley Cup Finals to be contested by an Albertan team (the and Finals had been contested by teams from Edmonton and Calgary respectively), 1983 saw the first Finals games played in Alberta.\nThe Oilers would credit the Islanders' subdued post-series locker room celebration—focused more on putting ice packs on their various injuries—as teaching them the level of sacrifice and dedication needed to be champions. The Oilers would go on to win four Stanley Cups in the next five seasons—and five overall by 1990.\nThe 1983 Finals was the only time between 1982 and that the Stanley Cup wasn't presented in Western Canada.\nPaths to the Finals.\nEdmonton defeated the Winnipeg Jets 3–0, the Calgary Flames 4–1, and the Chicago Black Hawks 4–0 to advance to the Finals. In eliminating Winnipeg, Calgary, and Chicago, the Oilers had won 11 of 12 games and had outscored their opponents 74–33, averaging over six goals a game and setting 16 scoring records in these three rounds. The 1983 Finals marked sixty years since an Edmonton team had last contested the Stanley Cup. The 1923 Edmonton Eskimos WCHL team played the NHL's Ottawa Senators in the 1923 Stanley Cup Finals, held in Vancouver. Ottawa won the two-game, total-goals series.\nNew York defeated the Washington Capitals 3–1, the New York Rangers 4–2, and the Boston Bruins 4–2 to reach the Finals.\nGame summaries.\nBilly Smith limited the Oilers to just six goals in the four games, and shut them out in seven out of twelve periods. Smith was also noted for his slashes and feigned injuries in that series, which made him unpopular with the \"Edmonton Journal\", which named him \"PUBLIC ENEMY NO. 1\", \"Mr. Obnoxious\", \"Samaurai [sic] Billy\", \"Jack the Ripper\" and \"a creep\". After a slash on Glenn Anderson's knee prevented him from practicing the next day, Oilers manager and coach Glen Sather unsuccessfully complained to the NHL that Smith deserved an attempt-to-injure match penalty, and then took his case to the press, suggesting that the Oilers could take out Smith. Smith responded, \"Let's face it. If Semenko runs at me and hurts me, anything could happen, and the victim could be Gretzky. If they want blood.…\" Smith did, however, earn a five-minute penalty for slashing Wayne Gretzky.\nIn game four, Smith's dive resulted in referee Andy Van Hellemond giving Anderson a five-minute penalty.\nIn his first appearance in the Finals, Gretzky assisted on four of the Oilers' six goals but failed to score himself. While no Islander was assigned to mark Gretzky, the Oilers superstar found himself checked as soon as he got the puck. The Islanders' tactics were described as a \"rope-a-dope\", using their experience and patience to hang on in the face of the Oilers' furious attack. The Islanders permitted Edmonton to take long shots from poor angles, but cleared the rebounds and kept the front of the net open so Smith could see. The Sutter brothers, Duane and Brent, led with seven and five points, respectively in the first three games. Duane played a particularly important role in the absence of Bossy in game one. Bossy netted his second Stanley Cup-winning goal.\nAfter game four, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and noticed many of the Islanders players exhausted and covered in ice packs rather than wildly celebrating, with Wayne Gretzky suggesting that this gave the Oilers inspiration that they needed in order to win next year.\nBroadcasting.\nThe series aired on CBC in Canada and on the USA Network in the United States.

        "text": "Michael Paul Benjamin (born November 22, 1965) is an American former professional baseball infielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from to and . Before entering professional baseball, Benjamin played at Cerritos College and Arizona State University, where he was an All-American in his senior season. A utility infielder in the major leagues, he played shortstop in 375 of his 818 career games. His longest stint was with the San Francisco Giants from 1989 to 1995.\nEarly life.\nA 1983 graduate of Bellflower High School in California, he played college baseball at Cerritos College and was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1985 but continued his college baseball career at Arizona State University instead of pursuing professional baseball. In 1987, his senior season at Arizona State, he had a .309 batting average, 14 home runs (HR), and 45 runs batted in (RBI). That year he was one of four Arizona State players (including catcher Tim Spehr) named to the All-Pac-10 Conference Southern Division team by the \"Arizona Daily Star\" and to the Division I All-America Team by \"Baseball America\".\nPlaying career.\nBenjamin was a third-round draft pick of the San Francisco Giants in June 1987, and by April 1989 he was playing for the Giants' Triple-A affiliate, the Phoenix Firebirds. He was said to be playing sensationally at shortstop but experiencing lower back pain.\nBenjamin made his major league debut with the Giants on July 7, 1989, and he played with the team through 1995, never appearing in more than 68 games in a season. On June 14, 1995, he tied a Giants single-game record with six hits. This was part of a stretch in which he tied the major league record for most hits in two consecutive games with ten, set a major league record for most hits in three consecutive games with 14, and tied another record for most hits in four consecutive games with 15.\nIn October 1995, Benjamin was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for pitcher Jeff Juden and a minor league player. After one season there, he was granted free agency. He signed one-year contracts with the Boston Red Sox in 1997 and 1998.

        "text": "The 1982 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1981–82 season, and the culmination of the 1982 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was played between the Campbell Conference champion Vancouver Canucks in their first Finals appearance and the Wales Conference and defending Cup champion New York Islanders, in their third Finals appearance. The Islanders won the best-of-seven series, four games to none, to win their third consecutive and overall Stanley Cup championship. This was the first time that a U.S.-based team won three straight Stanley Cups. The 1982 Canucks are one of two Stanley Cup finalist teams without any Hall of Famers on their roster (The other being the 1996 Florida Panthers).\nThis 1982 Finals took place under a revised NHL divisional alignment and playoff structure, which \"de facto\" revived the \"East vs. West\" format for the Finals that had been abandoned when the Western Hockey League folded in . It was also the first time a team from Western Canada contested the Finals since the WHL stopped challenging for the Stanley Cup (the Victoria Cougars, who had also been the last team from British Columbia to win the Cup in , played the 1926 Finals too). This would also be the first of nine consecutive Finals contested by a team from Western Canada, but it was the only one of them to feature the Vancouver Canucks; the other eight were contested by a team from Alberta (Edmonton Oilers appeared in six, Calgary Flames in two).\nWith the new \"East vs. West\" format in effect, the NHL opted to switch a 2-3-2 format for the Finals to reduce travel compared to the traditional 2–2–1–1–1 format, although that was of no effect for these Finals since the result was a four-game sweep. Also, starting this season home-ice advantage would alternate between conferences as opposed to going to the team with the better record. The latter change would also be of no effect for these Finals since for even years the Wales champion received that advantage and in 1982 their representative, the Islanders, had the better record.\nPaths to the Finals.\nVancouver, despite having a losing record in the regular season, defeated the Calgary Flames 3–0, the Los Angeles Kings 4–1 and the Chicago Blackhawks 4–1 to advance to the finals. This was their first Finals appearance.\nNew York defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 3–2, the New York Rangers 4–2, and the Quebec Nordiques 4–0 to make it to the finals for the third year in a row.\nWith New York having 118 points and Vancouver having 77, the 41-point difference between the two teams in a final round is the largest in Stanley Cup Finals history.\nGame summaries.\nThe Canucks had their best chance to win a game in the first one, as a Jim Nill short-handed marker gave them a 5–4 lead with only seven minutes to play in regulation time. However, the Islanders tied it when Mike Bossy banged home a loose puck after goaltender Richard Brodeur had collided with his own defenceman, Harold Snepsts, while trying to smother it. In the dying seconds of the first overtime period, Snepsts attempted to clear the puck up the middle, but it was intercepted by Bossy, who completed his hat trick with two seconds left on the clock to win the game for the Islanders. In game two, the Canucks led 4–3 after two periods, but the Isles came back to win again.\nThe series then shifted to Vancouver, where the Canucks were boosted by a boisterous, towel-waving Vancouver crowd and had a great first period, but failed to score on Billy Smith, who was brilliant. The Islanders went on to win 3–0, and then completed the sweep with a 3–1 victory on May 16 to win their third straight Cup and first on the road.\nMike Bossy scored seven goals in the four games, tying Jean Béliveau's record from , and won the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nNew York Islanders vs. Vancouver Canucks.\n\"Mike Bossy won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP.\"\nBroadcasting.\nThe series aired on CBC in Canada and on the USA Network in the United States. However, USA's national coverage was blacked out in the New York area due to the local rights to Islanders games in that TV market, with SportsChannel New York airing games one and two, and WOR televising games three and four.\nTechnical Difficulties.\nDuring the first period of the fourth game, WOR's broadcast experienced technical difficulties due to videotaping and editing issues causing an estimated 4 minutes and 30 seconds delay on their broadcast with a WOR identification card with text reading \"Please Stand By\" on the center of the screen. After a minute of silence, music by Alan Hawkshaw began playing with an announcer saying \"Please stand by, we're experiencing technical difficulties. As soon as they have been corrected, we shall return to our scheduled programs\". This occurred before a commercial break.\nTeam rosters.\nVancouver Canucks.\nNote: \"Stan Smyl served as the Canucks acting team captain during the 1982 Stanley Cup playoffs. Kevin McCarthy was injured late in the season and did not play in the playoffs and is listed as the official team captain.\"\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1982 Stanley Cup was presented to Islanders captain Denis Potvin by NHL President John Ziegler following the Islanders 3–1 win over the Canucks in game four\nThe following Islanders players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1981–82 New York Islanders\nAftermath.\nThe Islanders successfully returned to the Finals the following year. This time, they played the Edmonton Oilers and swept them 4–0 to capture their fourth consecutive Stanley Cup championship.\nThe Canucks, however, lost in the first round to the Calgary Flames, 3–1. The Canucks would not return to the Stanley Cup Finals until 1994, when they were defeated by the Islanders crosstown rivals, the New York Rangers, in seven games."

It was contested by the New York Islanders in their first-ever Finals appearance and the Philadelphia Flyers, in their fourth Finals appearance, and first since 1976. The Islanders would win the best-of-seven series, four games to two, to win their first Stanley Cup championship and the third for a post-1967 expansion team after Philadelphia's Cup wins in 1974 and 1975.\nPaths to the Finals.\nNew York defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3–1, the Boston Bruins 4–1 and the Buffalo Sabres 4–2 to advance to the Final.\nPhiladelphia defeated the Edmonton Oilers 3–0, the New York Rangers 4–1 and the Minnesota North Stars 4–1 to make it to the Final.\nGame summaries.\nIn game one, Denis Potvin scored the first power-play overtime goal in Stanley Cup Finals history. In game six, Bob Nystrom scored the Cup winner in overtime, his fourth career overtime goal, at the time putting him alone behind Maurice Richard's six on the all-time overtime goal-scoring list. Ken Morrow joined the team after winning the Olympic gold medal and added the Stanley Cup to cap a remarkable season.\nThe deciding game six was marred by one of the most infamous blown official calls in NHL playoff history. With the game tied 1–1, the Islanders Butch Goring picked up a drop pass from New York left wing Clark Gillies which had clearly gone back over the Flyers' defensive zone blue line into center ice. Linesman Leon Stickle waved the play as on-side, and Goring threaded a pass to right wing Duane Sutter who beat Philadelphia goalie Pete Peeters for a 2-1 New York lead. The Flyers argued vehemently to no avail. Everyone on both sides except Goring and Sutter appeared to relax as if play had been blown dead once the puck went over the blue line. Flyers captain Mel Bridgman stated the play changed the momentum of the game at a critical time even though the Flyers scored shortly afterwards to tie the score 2-2. Stickle admitted after the game that he had blown the call. Ultimately, it was the Flyers lack of discipline and the resulting Islander Power Play goals that were the difference in the series.\nThe series-winning overtime goal in game six was scored by Bobby Nystrom and assisted by fellow third liners John Tonelli and Lorne Henning. Nystrom's redirection of Tonelli's cross-ice pass from just above the Flyers left side face-off circle, floated up and over goalie Pete Peeters' blocker before the Philadelphia keeper could slide over to stop the puck. Henning's \"thread the needle\" pass was a key component, of the goal.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1980 Stanley Cup was presented to Islanders captain Denis Potvin by NHL President John Ziegler following the Islanders 5–4 win over the Flyers in game six.\nThe following Islanders players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1979–80 New York Islanders\nBroadcasting.\nBob Cole, Dan Kelly, and Jim Robson shared play-by-play duties for CBC's coverage. Cole did play-by-play for the first half of Games 1 and 2. Meanwhile, Kelly did play-by-play for the rest of Games 1–5 (Kelly also called the overtime period of Game 1). Finally, Robson did play-by-play for the first half of Games 3–4 and Game 6 entirely, he also would've called Game 7 had there been one. In essence, this meant that Cole or Robson did play-by-play for the first period and the first half of the second period (except for Game 5 in which the roles of Kelly and Robson were switched). Therefore, at the closest stoppage of play near the 10-minute mark of the second period, Cole or Robson handed off the call to Kelly for the rest of the game.\nIn the United States, the first five games were syndicated by the Hughes Television Network. Hughes used \"CBC's Hockey Night in Canada\" feeds for the American coverage. Game 6 was televised in the United States by the CBS network, as a special edition of its \"CBS Sports Spectacular\" anthology series. Dan Kelly did the play-by-play for CBS for the first and third periods as well as overtime. Tim Ryan did play-by-play for the second period while Lou Nanne served as the color commentator throughout. Game 6 remains the last Stanley Cup Finals game to be played in the afternoon (earlier than 5 p.m. local time). This would also be the last NHL game to air on U.S. network television until NBC televised the 1990 All-Star Game, and the last time the entire Finals series was broadcast on U.S. network television until ABC covered the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals."

He became the first player to win the Conn Smythe Trophy for two consecutive years. Since Parent, only two players have also won consecutive Conn Smythe Trophies: the Pittsburgh Penguins' Mario Lemieux in the Penguins' Stanley Cup wins in and and Sidney Crosby in the Penguins' and Stanley Cup championships. In the deciding game six played in Buffalo, the Sabres' offensive big guns rained shot after shot on Parent in an all-out effort to turn the series around, but Parent remained perfect. He stopped French Connection linemates Gilbert Perreault and Rick Martin on a 2–1 late in period two that had Flyers broadcaster Gene Hart screaming into his microphone:\n\"Out come the Sabres...two on one...Perreault and Martin with just Dupont back...Perrault to Martin...He's in...Shot!...save by Parent...and he hangs on!...Oh baby!\"\nThe dramatic stop by Parent took the offensive energy out of the Sabres and the Flyers scored two third-period goals to take the championship.\nFog and the bat.\nThe third game of the series was the Fog Game. Due to unusual heat in Buffalo in May 1975, and the lack of an air conditioning system in the auditorium, portions of the game were played in heavy fog. During stoppages of play, rink employees skated around the arena ice carrying bed sheets in an attempt to dispel the fog. Players, officials, and the puck were invisible to many spectators. The fog began to form just minutes after another odd incident: A bat in the arena, which flew above and around the players for the majority of the game, until Sabres center Jim Lorentz killed it with his stick. Many superstitious Buffalo fans considered this to be an 'evil omen', pertaining to the result of the series. The game continued and the Sabres won thanks to Rene Robert's goal in overtime.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1975 Stanley Cup was presented to Flyers captain Bobby Clarke by NHL President Clarence Campbell following the Flyers 2–0 win over the Sabres in game six.\nThe following Flyers players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1974–75 Philadelphia Flyers"

It was contested between the Boston Bruins and the Philadelphia Flyers. The Flyers made their first Finals appearance and the Bruins returned to the Finals for the third time in five years, having won the Stanley Cup in 1970 and 1972. The Flyers won the best-of-seven series, four games to two, becoming the first team from the 1967 Expansion to win the Stanley Cup, as well as the first non-Original Six Cup champion since the Montreal Maroons in 1935.\nPaths to the Finals.\nBoston defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4–0 and the Chicago Black Hawks 4–2 to advance to the final.\nPhiladelphia defeated the Atlanta Flames 4–0 and the New York Rangers 4–3 to make it to the final.\nGame summaries.\nIn the previous 19 games against the Bruins in Boston, the Flyers had lost 17 and tied two. Boston had the best regular season record in the league finishing one point ahead of the Flyers. The Bruins also had home ice advantage in the Stanley Cup Finals, and were made heavy favorites to win the series. A key confidence-building win late in the regular season saw the Flyers defeating the Bruins 5–3 at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.\nThe first two games at Boston Garden were full of late game dramatics. In game one, the Flyers nearly scored late in the third period to break a 2–2 tie. Bobby Orr, having saved the Flyers' shot by blocking the open Boston net with his leg, then took the puck up the ice and scored on a slapshot past goaltender Bernie Parent with a little over a minute remaining in regulation time to propel the Bruins to a 3–2 win. Game two saw the Bruins on the verge of a 2–0 series lead when Flyers defenseman Andre Dupont scored with Parent pulled with less than a minute remaining for an extra attacker to tie the score at 2–2, and Bobby Clarke scored the 3–2 game winner in overtime. It was the first time the Flyers had beaten the Bruins in Boston Garden since the first ever meeting between the two franchises.\nThe Flyers, led by Parent's play in goal, won the next two games on home ice to take a 3–1 series lead. Game five in Boston was a sloppy affair marred by many fights and penalties as Boston easily won to extend the series to a game six in Philadelphia. Before a national audience watching the game on NBC and a raucous Philadelphia crowd, Parent posted an epic 30-save shutout against the Bruins as the Flyers won the game 1–0, the series four games to two, and the Stanley Cup. Parent made a spectacular kick save to stop a tremendous slapshot from Ken Hodge with less than three minutes left to play. The blast was the Bruins' final shot of the series. Parent was named the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. The Flyers were the first of the 1967 expansion teams in the NHL to win the championship.\nCoincidentally, the Flyers were the first team to clinch the Stanley Cup at home since the Bruins did so four years earlier on Orr's famous overtime goal vs. the St. Louis Blues in Game 4. \nAftermath.\nThe Flyers Stanley Cup win triggered the largest celebration in Philadelphia sports history. Some observers of the celebration noted that they had seen that type of event in Philadelphia only once before, upon the announcement of the surrender of Japan on 14 August 1945. The day after the Flyers won the Cup, more than two million lined Broad Street for a ticker-tape parade, making it the largest championship parade in the history of Philadelphia sports. One of the fans who attended the parade was future New York Rangers goaltender Mike Richter. Richter grew up near Philadelphia in Flourtown, Pennsylvania idolizing Flyers goalie Bernie Parent.\nThe following year, the Flyers successfully returned to the Finals and captured their second consecutive Stanley Cup; this time, over the Buffalo Sabres in Buffalo, also winning in six games.\nAs for the Bruins, they lost in the first round to the Chicago Black Hawks 2–1.\nThe Stanley Cup was not won on home ice again until the Canadiens did so in 1979.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1974 Stanley Cup was presented to Flyers captain Bobby Clarke by NHL President Clarence Campbell following the Flyers 1–0 win over the Bruins in game six.\nThe following Flyers players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1973–74 Philadelphia Flyers"

        "text": "The 1972 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1971–72 season, and the culmination of the 1972 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the Boston Bruins and the New York Rangers. It was the Rangers' first appearance in the finals since 1950. The Bruins were making their first appearance since their victory in the 1970 Finals. It was the second Boston-New York Final series, the other being the 1929 Finals. The Bruins won the best-of-seven series, four games to two.\nThis was only the second Stanley Cup Finals contested by New York in which the Rangers hosted all of their home games. The first such Final, held in 1929, had lasted only two games. All other previous Finals contested by the Rangers had partly or entirely coincided with an annual circus formerly held at Madison Square Garden, compelling the Rangers to play Finals games at neutral sites and/or at the venues of their opponents.\nPaths to the Finals.\nBoston defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4–1 and the St. Louis Blues 4–0 to advance to the final.\nNew York defeated the defending champion Montreal Canadiens 4–2 and the Chicago Black Hawks 4–0 to set up an \"Original Six\" final.\nGame summaries.\nBobby Orr, who tallied 4 goals and 4 assists in the series, won the Conn Smythe Trophy for the second time. It was also Orr's second Cup-clinching goal, having accomplished both feats in the 1970 finals. Phil Esposito had 41 shots in the series but was held without a goal.\nGame one.\nGame one in Boston saw both teams play poorly. The Bruins at one point led 5–1 as Ken Hodge completed a hat trick, and Hodge and Derek Sanderson scored short-handed goals on the same Ranger power play at the end of the first period. However, the Rangers tied the game with goals from Gilbert, Hatfield, Tkaczuk, and Bruce MacGregor. With 2:16 remaining in the third period, Garnet \"Ace\" Bailey beat Rangers star defenseman Brad Park to have the Bruins prevail 6–5.\nGary Doak of the Rangers was ejected from the game after a heated argument with referee Bill Friday over a penalty he received at 18:50 of the first period.\nGame two.\nGame two had Gilles Villemure replace Ed Giacomin in goal for the Rangers. He played well, but the Bruins did too and won 2–1.\nGame three.\nIn New York, Giacomin was back in goal for game three as the Rangers won 5–2. Brad Park opened the scoring with a power play goal and scored another in the first period. Rod Gilbert also had two goals in the game.\nGame four.\nGiacomin was having trouble with a knee he injured during the Chicago series and lost game four 3–2.\nGame five.\nGame five in Boston had Villemure again replace Giacomin. Boston led 2–1 after two periods. However, Bobby Rousseau scored twice in the third period, his second at 12:45 turned out to be the winner in a 3–2 win for the Rangers.\nGame six.\nGame six in New York saw Boston play flawlessly and Gerry Cheevers picked up a shutout, 3–0. Bobby Orr's first-period marker ended up standing as the Stanley Cup-winning goal, and he also assisted on the Bruins' second goal. Orr spent 10 minutes in the penalty box after arguing with referee Art Skov but upon his return on the ice played a crucial role in killing off a penalty to the Bruins. Wayne Cashman scored two goals, one of which trickled in behind Gilles Villemure.\nAs of 2022, the 1972 Bruins are the most recent team to have won the Cup without a formal captain. John Bucyk, as the team's senior assistant captain, accepted the Cup and circled the rink in the ceremonial skate.\nBroadcasting.\n\"Hockey Night in Canada\" moved all playoff coverage from CBC to CTV (in actuality, MacLaren Advertising, the actual rights holders of \"HNIC\" at the time, worked out arrangements with CTV to move the full NHL playoffs there) to avoid conflict with the lengthy NABET strike against the CBC.\nIn the United States, CBS took a rather calculated risk in not televising the game five match on May 9 (CBS aired regular programming, including the original \"Hawaii Five-O\" in that time period on that Tuesday night). This was despite the fact that game five was a potential clincher with the Bruins up three games to one on the Rangers. CBS ultimately lucked out (since the Rangers won game five 3-2), and televised the clincher (game six) on Thursday night, May 11.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe following Bruins players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup:\n1971–72 Boston Bruins"

It was contested between the Chicago Black Hawks and the Montreal Canadiens. The Black Hawks made their first appearance in the finals since 1965, while the Canadiens had last played in and won the final in 1969. The Canadiens won the series, four games to three.\nPaths to the Finals.\nThe playoff system changed this year to allow cross-over between the divisions during the playoffs.\nChicago defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 4–0 and the New York Rangers 4–3 to advance to the final.\nMontreal defeated the defending champion Boston Bruins 4–3 and the Minnesota North Stars 4–2. This set up the first \"Original Six\" Finals since the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals.\nGame summaries.\nBrothers Frank and Peter Mahovlich starred for the Canadiens, scoring nine goals in the seven-game final series. Ken Dryden debuted for the Canadiens, while this was Jean Beliveau's last Finals appearance. He ended his career with ten championships. This was only the second time that the road team won a game seven in Finals history. The only previous time it happened was when the Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the Detroit Red Wings 2–1 in game seven in the 1945 Stanley Cup Finals in Detroit. Montreal also won the series despite losing the first two games on the road; none happened again until 2009, when the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Red Wings in game seven by the same 2–1 score after losing the first two games to the Red Wings. The next seven-game Stanley Cup Finals did not occur until the 1987 Stanley Cup Finals with the Edmonton Oilers and the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\"Montreal wins the series 4–3.\"\nCoaching controversies.\nBoth clubs would suffer public controversies regarding coaching performances, specifically accusations of mishandling star players during the series.\nChicago head coach Billy Reay would be attacked in the media by Hawks star forward Bobby Hull for his excessive employment of two little used forwards, Lou Angotti and Eric Nesterenko, as well as the injured defenceman Keith Magnuson in game seven. With a 2–0 Black Hawks lead, both Hull and Hawks star centre Stan Mikita were left on the bench for extended periods in favor of Angotti and Nesterenko, including two four-on-four situations. The wide open matchup should have favoured the frustrated Hull, who had been successfully shadowed in the series by Canadiens rookie Rejean Houle. The first two Canadien goals were tallied with the two backliners on the ice and the hobbled Magnuson was beaten one on one by speedy Montreal centre Henri Richard for the ultimate game winner.\nThe Canadiens suffered their own coaching controversy earlier in the series when head coach Al MacNeil benched alternate captain Henri Richard in game five. Following the 2-0 loss, Richard ripped MacNeil in the media calling him incompetent and \"the worst coach I ever played for.\" Accusation of favoring English-speaking players plagued MacNeil and turned the public against him. Following death threats, MacNeil and his family were assigned body guards for the final home game in Montreal. Even the eventual series victory wouldn't be enough to save MacNeil's job. He was replaced as head coach by Scotty Bowman soon after the finals.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1971 Stanley Cup was presented to Canadiens captain Jean Beliveau by NHL President Clarence Campbell following the Canadiens 3–2 win over the Black Hawks in game seven.\nThe following Canadiens players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1970–71 Montreal Canadiens"

It was contested between the Montreal Canadiens and the St. Louis Blues. The Canadiens swept the best-of-seven series in four games to win their 15th championship . It was the first Stanley Cup Finals after the NHL expansion to twelve teams. Although the series was a sweep, it was a much more intense and close-fought series than anyone had expected, as all four games were decided by one goal, two went to overtime, and the other two saw the winning goal scored in the third period. The Blues were the only first-year franchise to play for the Stanley Cup in the post-expansion era, until the Vegas Golden Knights participated in the Stanley Cup Finals a half-century later.\nPaths to the Finals.\nThis was the first Stanley Cup championship after the 1967 NHL expansion. All of the new teams were placed in the West Division, all the Original Six teams were put in the East Division, and the playoffs were organized so that divisional champions would play off for the Stanley Cup.\nMontreal defeated the Boston Bruins and Chicago Black Hawks to advance to the finals as the East Division champion.\nSt. Louis would defeat the Philadelphia Flyers and Minnesota North Stars to advance to the finals as the West Division champion.\nGame summaries.\nThe Montreal Canadiens finished first in the East Division with 94 points. The St. Louis Blues finished third in the West Division with 70 points. In this year's four-game regular season series, there were three wins for Montreal and one tie.\nComing into the series, most people were expecting the established Canadiens to blow the first-year Blues out of the water; after all, the Canadiens had dominated the East with 42 wins, while the Blues hadn't even finished with a winning record, with just 27 wins. However, what ended up happening would turn heads, as the Blues proceeded to put up a fight, riding the back of their goaltender, Glenn Hall.\nGame three.\nGlenn Hall was sensational, especially in game three when the Canadiens outshot the Blues 46–15. Wrote Red Burnett, the dean of hockey writers then: \"A number of Hall's saves were seemingly impossible. Experts walked out of the Forum convinced no other goaltender had performed so brilliantly in a losing cause.\" In the overtime of game three, Hall made a spectacular save on Dick Duff and then, standing on his head, made another save. \"It was a heartbreaker to see,\" said Burnett. \"After the saves on Duff, Bobby Rousseau came and batted home the second rebound.\" Hall's heroics even in defeat earned him the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs.\nGame four.\nWith their backs against the wall, the Blues put everything to the test, rallying from an early one-goal deficit to take the lead into the third period. However, Montreal was not to be denied and won the Stanley Cup in game four as J. C. Tremblay fired home the winning goal. When the game ended, the fans came on the ice to celebrate, and balloons, hats and programs were thrown from the stands. Jean Béliveau, in a cast and crutches from his broken ankle, with Ralph Backstrom accepted the Cup from NHL president Clarence Campbell and the players did a victory lap with the Cup.\nAftermath.\nLess than twelve minutes after the Canadiens won the Cup, Canadiens coach Toe Blake announced his retirement. He gave the reason that it had been a hard season, but the real reason was that his wife was dying of cancer and he wanted to spend his time with her. The celebration became a mournful event with players paying tribute to Blake, many in tears. He won eight Cups as the Canadiens' coach and three others as a player with the Canadiens and Montreal Maroons, the former being a record that stood for thirty-four years. None other than Bowman, the runner-up team's head coach in this Finals, would be the one to break Blake's record: he won the Cup with the Canadiens in , , , , and , with the Pittsburgh Penguins in , and with the Detroit Red Wings in , , and .\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1968 Stanley Cup was presented to Canadiens captain Jean Beliveau by NHL President Clarence Campbell following the Canadiens 3–2 win over the Blues in game four.\nThe following Canadiens players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1967–68 Montreal Canadiens"

The Bruins were making their first appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals since .\nThe Bruins won the series, four games to none. It was Boston's first Stanley Cup victory in 29 years. Bobby Orr scored the Cup-winning goal on Mother's Day against St. Louis' veteran Hall of Fame goalie Glenn Hall, with an assist from close friend and teammate \"The Turk\" Derek Sanderson, at forty seconds of overtime. The subsequent image of Orr flying through the air, his arms stretched out in victory — (he had been tripped by Blues' defenseman Noel Picard immediately after scoring the goal) — is considered the most famous and recognized hockey image of all time. With the win, the Bruins became the first American team to win the Stanley Cup since the Chicago Black Hawks in . The Blues, who had gone to the Finals their first three years in the league, would eventually lose each of the three series in four-game sweeps. St. Louis would not appear in a Stanley Cup Finals again until 2019, where they also faced (and defeated) the Bruins, ending the second-longest Finals drought in league history.\nPaths to the Finals.\nBoston defeated the New York Rangers 4–2 and the Chicago Black Hawks 4–0 to advance to the Finals.\nSt. Louis defeated the Minnesota North Stars 4–2 and the Pittsburgh Penguins 4–2.\nGame summaries.\nThe Boston Bruins tied for first in the East Division with the Chicago Black Hawks with 99 points. The Bruins lost the tiebreaker of wins with 40 to Chicago's 45. The St. Louis Blues finished first in the West Division with 86 points. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. In this year's regular-season series, there were three wins for Boston, one for St. Louis and two ties.\nAt 3:57 of the second period of game one, a hard shot from Fred Stanfield was deflected and struck Jacques Plante in the forehead of his face mask, splitting the mask in half and injuring Plante. Plante was finished for the series. Doctors later said if he hadn't been wearing the mask, he surely would have been killed. Ernie Wakely took over in goal but only held off the Bruins for a few minutes before becoming a rather easy mark for Bruins sharpshooters.\n\"The Flight\".\nThe most commonly seen video clip of Bobby Orr's famous overtime goal (\"The Flight\") in game four is the American version broadcast on CBS as called by Dan Kelly. This archival clip can be considered a rarity, since surviving kinescopes or videotapes of the telecasts of hockey games from this era usually emanate from CBC's coverage. According to Dick Irvin Jr.'s book \"My 26 Stanley Cups\" (Irvin was in the CBC booth with Danny Gallivan during the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals), he was always curious why even the CBC typically uses the CBS replay of the Bobby Orr goal (with Dan Kelly's commentary) instead of Gallivan's call. The explanation that Irvin received was that the CBC's master tape of the game (along with others) was thrown away in order to clear shelf space at the network.\nThe New England Sports Network has played the CBS video of the goal but has used the original WBZ-FM radio call with Fred Cusick and Johnny Peirson.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1970 Stanley Cup was presented to Bruins alternate captain Johnny Bucyk by NHL President Clarence Campbell following the Bruins 4–3 overtime win over the Blues in game four.\nThe following Bruins players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1969–70 Boston Bruins"

Henri Richard, a member of all seven championship teams, would score the series winner in game six in overtime. Two minutes into the extra period, Richard broke in on Red Wing goalie Roger Crozier, lost his footing on the newly resurfaced ice as he cut across the goalmouth, and sprawled into Crozier. The puck went in, and even though Crozier and the Wings protested that Richard had pushed the puck in with his hand, the goal stood.

The CBC would follow suit the following year. NBC's Stanley Cup coverage preempted a sports anthology series called \"NBC Sports in Action\", hosted by Jim Simpson and Bill Cullen, who were between-periods co-hosts for the Stanley Cup broadcasts.\nAftermath.\nThe next season, the Red Wings finished a distant fifth, 24 points out of the playoffs, marking the beginning of a 20 year slump known as the \"Dead Wings\" era. The Red Wings only made the playoffs four times in the next 20 years between 1967 and 1986, and would not return to the Stanley Cup Finals again until 1995, where they were swept by the New Jersey Devils.\nThe Canadiens would return to the Stanley Cup Finals the next season, but lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games.

Montreal defeated New York to advance to the finals and Toronto defeated Chicago.\nGame summaries.\nThe average age of the Leafs' players was 31, the oldest lineup to win the Cup. Johnny Bower was 42 and Allan Stanley was 41. Dave Keon won the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nMontreal won the opener 6–2. For the second game, Terry Sawchuk was replaced with Bower and provided the Leafs with a shutout win, 3–0. Bower was in net for game three and won 3–2 on Bob Pulford's overtime goal. This game has been described as \"one of the most exciting games ever played\".\nBower was injured before game four and Sawchuk had to replace him. Al Smith was called up from the minors to serve as back-up for the fourth and fifth games. The Canadiens defeated the Leafs 6–2 again, this time in Toronto to even the series. Sawchuk would play well in the next two games, backstopping the Leafs to the Cup.\nIn the sixth game Bower returned to the line-up as back up. Jim Pappin scored his seventh goal of the playoffs and Sawchuk stopped 41 shots helping Toronto win the Cup. Pappin had four goals and four assists in the final series. Captain George Armstrong scored the 3–1 empty-net insurance goal to put game six out of reach.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1967 Stanley Cup was presented to Maple Leafs captain George Armstrong by NHL President Clarence Campbell following the Maple Leafs 3–1 win over the Canadiens in game six.\nThe following Maple Leafs players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup.\n1966–67 Toronto Maple Leafs\nWon all 4 Stanley Cups in 6 Years with Toronto 1962, 1963, 1964, 1967.\nGeorge Armstrong, Bob Baun, Johnny Bower, Larry Hillman, Tim Horton, Red Kelly, Dave Keon, Frank Mahovlich, Bob Pulford, Eddie Shack, Allan Stanley (11 players), Stafford Smythe, Harold Ballard, John Bassett, Punch Imlach, King Clancy, Bob Haggert, Tom Nayler (7 non-players), Bob Davidson, Karl Elieff (were part of all 4 cups, but were not included on the cup each season.)"

The Leafs would suffer a second-period letdown but would win 4–2 to take the lead in the series. Because of the second period letdown, Punch Imlach would put the team through a morning practice the next morning.\nGame two.\nThe Leafs would again win 4–2 and would again have to have a morning after workout assigned by Imlach.\nGame three.\nThe series now moved to Detroit. The team was sequestered out of town in a Toledo, Ohio hotel. The Red Wings, led by rookie centre Alex Faulkner's two goals, including the winner, captured the game three–2. It was his third game-winning goal and all had been scored on Sundays. Faulkner was a native of Newfoundland and Howie Meeker, exclaimed that there would be \"dancing in the streets tonight\".\nGame four.\nThe Leafs felt that they had let game three slip away due to overconfidence and were determined to not repeat the mistake in game four. The game was close, and was tied 2–2 until with ten minutes to go Dave Keon scored. Red Kelly added another to make the score 4–2.\nOn the way to the dressing room the Leafs' players were pelted with paper cups, programs and food containers.\nGame five.\nBack in Toronto, the Red Wings kept the score close. After Keon scored a short-handed goal, Marcel Pronovost scored for Detroit to tie the game. The game and series winner was scored by Eddie Shack with seven minutes to go on a deflection. Shack had scored the goal unintentionally as he later admitted. Keon then scored another short-handed goal to put the game out of reach for Detroit.\nThe Leafs celebrated their second consecutive Stanley Cup by throwing Imlach, Harold Ballard and Stafford Smythe into the showers fully clothed. The team was given a victory parade along Bay Street with a reception at Toronto City Hall.\nAs of 2019, this is the only one of the last seven big four championship series involving a Toronto team (all of which have been won by Toronto) which did not last exactly six games.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1963 Stanley Cup was presented to Maple Leafs captain George Armstrong by NHL President Clarence Campbell following the Maple Leafs 3–1 win over the Red Wings in game five.\nThe following Maple Leafs players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1962–63 Toronto Maple Leafs"

        "title": "Cricket in Canada",
        "text": "Cricket is a minor sport in Canada which is unusual among the former Dominions of the British Empire in not having adopted cricket as a major sport—in contrast with Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa and the British West Indies.\nHistory.\nThe earliest reports of cricket in Canada date from 1785, when games seem to have taken place in Montreal. The first reference to cricket being played on an organized basis is in 1834, when a club was founded in Toronto and there are reports of matches being played in Hamilton and Guelph.\nIn 1840, there was a game between the Toronto and New York clubs. Similar strength teams played each other in 1844 in what has been called the first-ever cricket international. In 1867, Canadian prime minister John A. Macdonald and his cabinet declared cricket to be Canada’s first official sport.\nCricket Canada is the governing body of the sport of cricket in Canada. It was established in 1892 and has its current headquarters in Toronto, Ontario. The British Columbia Mainland Cricket League was founded in 1914, and is now the second-largest cricket league in North America. Cricket Canada is Canada's representative at the International Cricket Council and has been an associate member of that body since 1968. It is included in the ICC Americas region. Prior to November 2007, the organization was known as the Canadian Cricket Association.\nThe most famous Canadian cricketer is John Davison, who was born in Canada and participated in the Cricket World Cup in both 2003 and 2007. At the 2003 World Cup, Davison hit the fastest century in tournament history against the West Indies in what was ultimately a losing cause. In that World Cup he also smashed a half-century at a strike rate of almost 200 against New Zealand. One year later, in the ICC Intercontinental Cup against the USA, he proved the difference between the two sides, taking 17 wickets for 137 runs as well as scoring 84 runs of his own. In the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, Davison scored the second-fastest half-century against New Zealand. Canada has participated in the 1979, 2003, 2007 and 2011 Cricket World Cups.\nDomestic competitions.\nThe first Canadian Dominion inter-provincial cricket tournament was held in Montreal in the month of August 1964. One of the best matches of the tournament was Manitoba defeating British Columbia at Lower Canada College grounds in Montreal. \nCricket Canada organizes domestic inter-provincial cricket in Canada. In 2008, Cricket Canada has introduced two domestic competitions that are Scotia Shield U-19 and National T20 Championship. National T20 Championship is a Twenty20 format competition with eight domestic teams. Until 2006, the Under-18 National Tournament in Canada was called as Canada Cup.\nIn 2009, a new professional Twenty20 league was formed. Known as the TJT National Cricket League (TJT NCL), the league initially consisted of six teams – the Warriors, Titans, Gladiators, Royals, Chiefs, and Kings. About 90 professional cricket players were drafted from across Canada in the inaugural draft. The inaugural season commenced play August 7, 2009 at G. Ross Lord Park in Toronto. The six teams played each other in a round robin match over the season which lasted six weeks. The top four teams Gladiators, Warriors, Titans, and Kings played in semi-finals and the final match was played on September 27, 2009 between the Titans and the Kings. The 2009 TJT NCL championship was won by the Kings.\nIn 2012, the CIBC National Cricket League was introduced by Cricket Canada as the new major domestic competition played mid-summer in Toronto. Consisting of five franchise teams to represent cricketing regions across the country; Pacific Edge (BC), Western Stallions (AB), Prairie Fire (MB/SK), Central Shield (ON), Eastern Fury (Atlantic – QC, NB, PE, NS, NL). The NCL is broken up into two competition formats, a T20 competition and a One Day competition.\nIn February 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) sanctioned the Global T20 Canada, the first franchise-based Twenty20 league in North America.\nDomestic competitions in Canada include: \nCricket grounds.\nUntil September 2006, Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club Ground was the only ground in Canada approved to host official One Day Internationals. It was joined at this date by the Maple Leaf Cricket Club in King City, Ontario.\nNational team.\nWhile Canada is not sanctioned to play Test matches, the team does take part in One Day International matches and also in first-class games (in the ICC Intercontinental Cup) against other non-Test-playing opposition, with the rivalry against the United States cricket team being as strong in cricket as it is in other team sports. The match between these two nations is in fact the oldest international fixture in cricket, having first been played in 1844. This international fixture even predates the Olympics by over 50 years.\nCanada is one of the team's in Division 1 of Associate Members of International Cricket Council who has One Day International and T20 International status.\nCanadian cricket has tended to take a lower profile than most other sports, and the team tends to be composed of expatriates from more successful cricketing nations either trying to achieve a level of international experience or having been deemed too old for their respective national teams. The 2003 World Cup squad, for example, contained players born in Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, and the West Indies.\nMen's.\nCanada Senior Men's team qualified in April 2009 at the ICC World Cup qualifier held in South Africa to compete in 2011 World Cup, their third World Cup appearance in a row.\nWomen's.\nCanada has traditionally had a strong Women's team. Also The Canadian Under 19 team have competed in the Under 19 World Cup on three occasions. In 2002, they were eliminated in the first round, meaning they competed in the plate competition, in which they did not win a game. They repeated this performance in the 2004 competition. The Canadian u19 team competed in the 2014 u19 World Cup in Dubai, finishing 15th.\nThe Canadian women's cricket team made their international debut in September 2006 in a three match series of one-day games against Bermuda to decide which team would represent the Americas region in the Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Ireland in 2007. Canada started well, with a five wicket win in the first win, but Bermuda came back with 24 run win in the second. The third game went down to the wire, with Bermuda triumphing by just 3 runs."

        "title": "Hex (climbing)",
        "text": "A hex is an item of rock-climbing equipment used to protect climbers from falls. They are intended to be wedged into a crack or other opening in the rock, and do not require a hammer to place. They were developed as an alternative to pitons, which are hammered into cracks, damaging the rock. Most commonly, a carabiner will be used to join the hex to the climbing rope by means of a loop of webbing, cord or a cable which is part of the hex.\nHexes are a type of nut, a hollow eccentric hexagonal prism with tapered ends, usually threaded with webbing, a swaged cable, or a cord. They are manufactured by several firms, with a range of sizes varying from about wide. Climbers select a range of sizes to use on a specific climb based on the characteristics of the cracks in the rock encountered on that particular climb. Sides may be straight or curved although the functioning principles remain the same no matter which shape is selected; the lack of sharp corners on curved models may make them easier to remove from the rock.\nHexes may be placed either as passive or active protection. When placed passively they work like chock stones in flared cracks, like other climbing nuts, just larger and with a different shape. Active protection is achieved by orienting the webbing so that a pull causes a camming action against the rock similar to Tricams, allowing for placement in parallel cracks. They are often preferred by alpine mountaineers over spring-loaded camming devices because of their lack of moving parts and overall lower weight for the same size crack.\nThe original hexes were invented by Yvon Chouinard and Tom Frost, and called \"Hexentrics\". The \"polycentric\" hexentric was designed by Swedish–Norwegian climber Tomas Carlstrom and given to Chouinard Equipment in 1973. They applied for a U.S. patent in 1974 and it was granted on April 6, 1976. Hexes were produced by Chouinard Equipment, Ltd until 1989, when it was sold as a design to Black Diamond Equipment. They are produced and sold in much the same design today."

The United States – continuing its tradition of fielding a far from full strength squad – had its worst performance ever in the Pan American athletics competition.

        "text": "Skeleton Man is a 2004 made-for-tv slasher film directed by Johnny Martin and starring Michael Rooker and Casper Van Dien. It was aired from Sci Fi Channel on March 1, 2004. In the film, the titular Skeleton Man stalks a squad of soldiers.\nPlot.\nThe film opens with an archaeologist looking at some artifacts he has dug up from an Indian burial ground. Among these items is the skull of an Indian chief, Skeleton Man appears through a portal and kills the archaeologist. Skeleton Man then chases the archaeologist's assistant to a power plant, killing her and the two men working there.\nSkeleton Man, now on horseback, kills a soldier and chases his partner. Before being killed, the second soldier manages to record a video and send it back to his bosses. They receive it and send in Delta Force to deal with this unknown threat.\nAs they advance, a female soldier falls behind and is impaled through the chest. The team finds an old Indian man who tells them that Skeleton Man, known as Cottonmouth Joe, was a genocidal warrior who killed the old man's tribe and is now stalking the soldiers. The team pays him no heed.\nMeanwhile, Cottonmouth Joe slaughters the workers at an oil pumping station. That night, two sentries are also killed (but are technically MIA as their bodies are never found). The team's scout (Casper Van Dien) also disappears.\nThe next day, the team encounters Cottonmouth Joe. The heavy weapons specialist charges him but is killed and the team opens fire to no effect. A support helicopter of Citizen's Militia is also destroyed. One man goes to recover the heavy weapons specialist's body but finds it missing. The squad then discovers the team scout, whom they accidentally shot in the firefight (Cottonmouth Joe having captured him and put him in a location to be shot). The team tries to lure their adversary into a trap, but run out of ammo. Another trooper is killed, as is the team sharpshooter who has her skull crushed by a tomahawk.\nThe two remaining troopers (Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) and Lieutenant Scott (Sarah Ann Schultz) again try to lure Cottonmouth Joe into a trap to no avail. Skeleton man ends his pursuit of them and heads to a nearby chemical plant where he kills several workers, two guards, the manager and several scientists. The two remaining soldiers arrive and find the place surrounded by law enforcement. Captain Leary takes a sheriff's Armsel Striker and goes to confront the undead adversary. After a cat-and-mouse chase through the chemical plant, Captain Leary lures Cottonmouth Joe into a generator room and blows him up with electric current.\nAs the film's credits begin to roll, they suddenly reverse and show Skeleton Man back on his horse in the woods, thus indicating that he has survived.\nRelease.\n\"Skeleton Man\" was released on DVD by MTI Home Video on November 22, 2005. It was later released by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment on June 5, 2007 as a three-disk pack with \"Raging Sharks\" (2005), and \"Lifepod\" (1993). Echo Bridge would re-release the film multiple times in 2008, 2009, and 2010. The company would last release the film on February 7, 2012, as a part of its two-disk, \"Midnight Horror Collection\" Pack.\nReception.\nCritical reception for the film has been extremely negative with critics panning the film's plot, acting, and monster costume.\nDread Central gave the film a positive and negative review stating, \"This is one of those movies that requires two distinct ratings based on what frame of mind you’re in when you sit down to watch it. The only reason anyone should ever watch Skeleton Man is to either gawk at how unbelievably inept it is or to have bad movie night with some friends to do a little MST3K riffing at home. If you go into the movie with that attitude then I assure you it will deliver like few films you’ll ever witness. If you go into the movie looking for a legitimate movie watching experience then you better prepare yourself for one of the worst of your life. Either way, Skeleton Man is guaranteed to leave you in a state of shock and awe\"."

The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\nHistory.\nThe Big 12 tournament was first played in 1997 at All Sports Stadium in Oklahoma City, before moving to Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark the following year. The tournament has been played in Oklahoma City each year, save for 2002 and 2004, when the event was played in Arlington, Texas, at the home park of Major League Baseball's Texas Rangers. Over its 10-plus year history, the tournament has had three distinct formats.\n1997–98.\nIn 1997 and 1998, the top six teams were invited to play in a double elimination tournament with no byes for any teams. The format mirrored the regional round of the NCAA tournament at that time.\n1999–2005.\nBeginning in 1999, the tournament expanded to eight teams and followed the format of the College World Series. It consisted of two 4-team double-elimination brackets, with the winners facing off in a final championship game. The format mirrors that of the tournament format used by the Southeastern Conference, which continues to use this bracket.\n2006–2010.\nIn 2006 the tournament moved to a round-robin format. In this format, two pools of four teams play each other with the winners of each pool playing a one-game championship match. This format ended in 2010.\n2011–present.\nStarting with the 2011 Big 12 Conference baseball tournament, the tournament went back to the format used from 1999 to 2005.\nRecords.\nTeam batting\nTeam fielding\nTeam pitching\nIndividual batting\nIndividual fielding\nIndividual pitching"

The ball traveled to just from the hole. Tom Creavy made 3, Woods a 4, and Creavy went on to win 3&amp;2. Woods was one up after ten, but the 22-year-old Creavy won four of the next five holes, and halved the 16th to end the match. It was Woods' only loss in match play over a five-year period that began with three consecutive U.S. Junior Amateurs (1991–93) and ended with three consecutive U.S. Amateurs (1994–96). Creavy won the final match the next day for the MIC title and later became a leading instructor, with Se-Ri Pak among his students. His great uncle, also named Tom Creavy, won the PGA Championship in 1931, defeating Gene Sarazen in the match play final.\nOriginally a match play event, the MIC switched to 72-hole stroke play in 1998.\nLPGA Championship.\nIn August 2014, the course hosted the Wegmans LPGA Championship, a major on the LPGA Tour., with a change in date and location from Locust Hill Country Club which held the tournament in June in the previous four years.

        "text": "Kevin Craig Brooks (born February 9, 1963) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions. He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines. He was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round of the 1985 NFL Draft wit the 17th overall pick.\nEarly years.\nBrooks was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1963. He attended Mackenzie High School in Detroit, where he was an All-American and an All-state defensive lineman. He was a member of the National Honor Society and received his school's scholar-athlete award, while graduating in 1981.\nCollege career.\nBrooks enrolled at the University of Michigan in the fall of 1981 and played college football for head coach Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1981 to 1984. He played at outside linebacker as a freshman before moving to the defensive tackle position in 1982. As a sophomore, he started the first 4 games at defensive tackle for the 1982 Michigan Wolverines football team, before a knee injury against the University of Indiana sidelined him for 4 contests. He returned to start against UCLA in the 1983 Rose Bowl, making 10 tackles (second on the team).\nAs a junior, he started all 12 games at defensive tackle for the 1983 Michigan team that compiled a 9–3 record and was ranked #8 in the final AP Poll. He posted 48 tackles (seventh on the team), 6 tackles for loss and 3 sacks. At the end of the season, he was selected by the conference coaches as a first-team defensive lineman on the 1983 All-Big Ten Conference football team.\nAs a senior, he started 11 games at defensive tackle for the 1984 Michigan team. At 6'6\", 273 lbs, Brooks led the team with six sacks and 13 tackles for loss, while also making 69 tackles (fourth on the team). He was selected for the second consecutive year as an All-Big Ten player.\nDuring his college career at Michigan, Brooks recorded 156 tackles, two pass breakups and two fumble recoveries.\nProfessional football.\nDallas Cowboys.\nIn the 1985 NFL Draft the Dallas Cowboys were targeting Jerry Rice with their first round selection, but settled for Brooks (17th overall) after Rice was taken by the San Francisco 49ers. He had a disappointing rookie season, playing all four defensive line positions, registering 12 tackles and 2 sacks. His best game came against the Houston Oilers, when he replaced an injured Jim Jeffcoat in the second half, making 4 tackles and one sack.\nIn 1986, he competed with John Dutton for the left defensive tackle position, but suffered a dislocated knee cap in the preseason game against the San Diego Chargers. He lost 7 games on the injured reserve list, limiting him to 9 regular season games as a backup and 9 tackles to go along with 2.5 sacks.\nIn 1987, he became the starter at left defensive tackle after passing Dutton on the depth chart. When the players went on a strike on the third week of the season, those contests were canceled (reducing the 16-game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. On October 7, he crossed the picket line and joined the replacement team. He led the team's defensive linemen with 67 tackles, while adding 3 sacks during the season.\nIn 1988, he started 14 out of 15 games, registering 71 tackles and 5 sacks. In the spring of 1989, Brooks clashed with new head coach Jimmy Johnson, before being traded along with a fourth round draft choice (#82-Jeroy Robinson) to the Denver Broncos, in exchange for a third round draft choice (#80-Greg McMurtry).\nDenver Broncos.\nIn 1989, the Denver Broncos moved Brooks to defensive end and lasted just a few months before being released on September 4.\nDetroit Lions.\nOn September 11, 1989, he signed with the Detroit Lions and was named the starting right defensive end after Keith Ferguson was injured. He started 15 games, registering 39 tackles and 2 sacks. The next year, he appeared in only six games (4 starts) at defensive tackle and was waived by the Lions on November 2, 1990.\nBrooks retired after playing in the NFL for six seasons from 1985 to 1990. He appeared in 69 games, 45 of them as a starter. He is credited with 15.5 quarterback sacks and two fumble recoveries.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retiring from football, Brooks suffered from depression, and his weight increased to nearly 400 pounds. He underwent a gastric sleeve weight-loss procedure, lost 110 pounds, and became a celebrity spokesperson for The Alexander Center for Obesity Surgery in Dallas. He is married to Tiffany Brooks and has five children. His father is former NFL player Theodore Wheeler."

Hopkins had finished first or second in eight of the 11 NCAA championships and had been on a 22-game unbeaten streak before the final. This title was North Carolina's first in lacrosse.\nThe Tar Heels were led by coach Willie Scroggs, former Johns Hopkins' top assistant coach. North Carolina had been ranked number two in the USILA poll behind three-time defending national champion Johns Hopkins entering the tournament. Scroggs, who played midfield at Hopkins, turned the Tar Heels into national champions after only three seasons as coach.\nAnnapolis native Michael Burnett was selected USILA first team All-America. North Carolina's leading scorer, Burnett a sophomore, was among the first of a group of high-profile Maryland players recruited by Willie Scroggs to North Carolina as the school quickly built its program into a national power. Over the next decade, North Carolina would be among the top lacrosse programs, with four national titles and nine Final Four appearances.\nFor Hopkins, the prior four-year period included 53 wins against three losses, to go with three national championships. During this stretch, the Blue Jays won a record 11 straight NCAA tournament games, a record later tied by Syracuse.\nNational Player of the Year Jeff Cook scored six goals for Hopkins. Cook got Hopkins to within one goal with 45 seconds left in the game on a tremendous individual effort, stick-handling past four UNC defenders and rocketing a shot past the goaltender. Hopkins, though, lost the ensuing final face-off."

        "text": "Hugh Alexander (July 10, 1917 – November 25, 2000) was an American professional baseball player and scout. He was an outfielder during his brief playing career, but after he suffered a career-ending injury at the age of 20 he became one of baseball's most celebrated scouts.\nBorn in Buffalo, Missouri, Alexander moved to Oklahoma with his family at the age of five. Alexander the player stood tall, weighed , and batted and threw right-handed. He spent 1936 and 1937 in the lower levels of the Cleveland Indians' farm system, and batted .348 and .344 in successive seasons. Called to the Majors, he appeared in seven games for the Indians in August, getting one hit in eleven at bats (.091) and striking out five times. He returned to the Indians for a single game in September as a pinch runner. That offseason, while working his family's oil fields in Oklahoma, he lost his left hand in a drilling accident, ending his playing career. Alexander then began a very short career as a bartender.\nIn the aftermath of the accident, Alexander was immediately named a scout for the Indians; at 20, he was unusually young for the assignment and scouting jobs were at a premium during the height of The Great Depression. But the first two players he signed for Cleveland became big-league All-Stars — pitcher Allie Reynolds and outfielder Dale Mitchell. Sportswriter Allen Barra praised him as a \"superb judge of talent.\" During a 64-year scouting career, working for the Indians, Chicago White Sox, Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs, Alexander earned the nickname \"Uncle Hughie\" and would sign other stars, including Steve Garvey, Frank Howard, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell and Don Sutton for the Dodgers alone.\nIn 1984 Alexander co-founded the \"Scout of the Year Program\", which recognised the best scouts in the country each year. Alexander was awarded \"Scout of the Year\" in 1996. He retired in 1998, and died on November 25, 2000."

        "text": "John Eugene Sullivan (February 16, 1873 – June 5, 1924), was an American baseball catcher. He played professional baseball from 1900 to 1910, including two seasons in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers in 1905 and the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1908. He collected 59 putouts and 24 assists, and committed 3 errors, in 13 games as a major league catcher. He batted and threw right-handed. \nEarly years.\nSullivan in Chicago in 1873. He began playing baseball on the Chicago sandlots. \nProfessional baseball.\nMinor leagues.\nSullivan began playing professional baseball in 1899 with a club in St. Thomas, Ontario. In 1900, he played for the Kansas City Blues of the American League (one year before the league was recognized as a major league). He played catcher and first base for the Blues, compiling a .227 batting average in seven games.\nHe joined the Denver Grizzlies of the Western League in the middle of the 1900 season and remained with the club through the 1901 season. He appeared in 58 games for the Grizzlies in 1900 and compiled a .329 batting average with five triples and six stolen bases. He spent the 1902 season with the Helena Senators of the Pacific Northwest League.\nSt. Paul Saints.\nIn 1903, he joined the St. Paul Saints of the American Association. He spent three years with the Saints and helped lead the club to three consecutive American Association championships from 1903 to 1905.\nDetroit Tigers.\nSullivan was acquired by the Detroit Tigers after the 1904 season. The Tiger sent him a contract with a salary of $1,800 for the 1905 season. Sullivan tore the contract into pieces on seeing the proposed salary. He eventually reached terms with the Tigers and made his major league debut on April 19, 1905. However, he appeared in only 13 games for the club, compiling a .156 batting average and a .250 on-base percentage in 32 at bats. He also gave up four passed balls in a game against Chicago on April 23. In late May 1905, the Tigers released Sullivan back to St. Paul.\nKansas City Blues.\nIn 1906, Sullivan joined for the Kansas City Blues, then playing in the American Association. He remained with Kansas City for four seasons, batting .162 in 1906, .223 in 1907, .228 in 1908, and .219 in 1909.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nLate in the 1908 season, Sullivan was sold to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He appeared in his only game for Pittsburgh on September 5, 1908, and had only a single plate appearance. He refused to sign a contract at the proposed rate of $350 per month and was sent back to Kansas City. Sullivan told the \"Kansas City Star\" that Pittsburgh's owner \"offered me the same salary I was making in Kansas City, and that didn't go with me. . . . I'd rather play ball right here in this league where all my friends are and the only thing that would've kept me in Pittsburgh was more money.\"\nNew England League.\nSullivan concluded his playing career playing in the New England League at the end of the 1910 season.\nLater years.\nSullivan moved to Minneapolis in approximately 1919. In June 1924, he collapsed and died within three minutes while playing in a practice game of baseball at Shaw Field, Macalester College, Saint Paul, Minnesota. Heart disease, aggravated by strenuous exercise, was the cause of death. He was buried at Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois."

He was tall and he weighed .\nBaseball career.\nBorn in Meadows, Maryland, Moore was originally signed by the Dodgers in 1947. He spent almost six full years in the minors, and made his major league debut on August 1, 1952 at the age of 26.\nOrioles and White Sox.\nMoore, who today wouldn't be considered a \"control specialist\" as he walked as many as 112 batters in a season, was used both as a reliever and starter in his career, starting mostly during his time with the Orioles, to whom he'd been traded for Chico García on October 8, 1954. He also started a large number of games one year with the White Sox. He was involved in a blockbuster deal when he was sent to the White Sox, being traded with Tito Francona and Billy Goodman for Hall of Famer Larry Doby, Jim Marshall, Russ Heman and Jack Harshman.\nPerhaps his best season as a starter was 1956, while with the Orioles. That year, Moore posted a 12–7 record with a 4.18 ERA. He also completed nine games that season, a career high. He also had the ninth best hits allowed per nine innings ratio in 1956, with a ratio of 7.83:9.\nOn June 28, 1957, Moore threw the White Sox' fourth consecutive shutout, which set an American League record. Overall that year, he went 11–13 with a 3.72 ERA.\nMoore saw the only postseason action of his career as his White Sox battled the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1959 World Series. Moore only appeared in one inning in the World Series, striking out one and giving up a hit-a home run by Chuck Essegian.\nSenators/Twins.\nHe was purchased from the White Sox by the Senators in June of 1960, and it was with the Senators and Twins (the Senators relocated to Minnesota after 1960) that he became one of the better closers in the league, ranking from 1960 to 1962 third, fourth and seventh in the league in saves, respectively.\nMoore finished up his career in 1963, playing his final game on September 6 against the Chicago White Sox, striking out the last batter he faced – Cam Carreon. Overall, he was 63–59 with 560 walks and 612 strikeouts in 1072 innings. He completed 24 of the 105 games he started, shutting out five of them. Overall, he appeared in 365 games, saving 46.\nMoore had a total of six home runs in his career, with as many as three in a season. In 1956, he hit .271 in 70 at-bats. Overall, his batting average was .187 with 56 hits in 299 at-bats. He struck out 99 times and walked seven times in his entire career.\nHe had a .946 fielding percentage in his career.\nMoore died in 1995 in Clinton, Maryland.

        "text": "The Rugby League World Cup is an international rugby league tournament contested by the top national men's representative teams. The tournament is administered by the International Rugby League and was first held in France in 1954, which was the first World Cup held for any form of rugby football.\nThe idea of a rugby league World Cup tournament was first mooted in the 1930s with the French proposal to hold a tournament in 1931, and again in 1951. The tournament's structure, frequency, and size has varied significantly throughout its history. The winners are awarded the Paul Barrière Trophy, named after Paul Barrière, the French Rugby League President of the 1940s and 1950s. Three nations have won the tournament; twelve times, three times, and once. Australia has been in the final of every World Cup, except the first in 1954, when they came third, which was considered to be a complete upset with the bookmakers at the time having Australia as strong favourites.\nThe latest World Cup was held in England in 2022 after being delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHistory.\nPre–1994: Original round robin World Cup.\n1935–1960: Establishment and triennial competitions.\nThe Rugby League World Cup was an initiative of the French who had been campaigning for a competition since 1935. The idea was raised in 1951 by Paul Barrière, the President of the French Rugby League. In 1952, Rugby Football League secretary Bill Fallowfield persuaded the Rugby League Council to support the concept. At a meeting in Blackpool, England in 1953, the International Board accepted Paul Barrière's proposal that France should be the nation to host the first tournament to be officially\nknown as the \"Rugby World Cup\". In addition to the hosts, the tournament featured teams from Britain, Australia and New Zealand. The 1954 Rugby League World Cup was won by Great Britain who defeated France in Paris on 13 November to claim the title.\nFollowing the success of the maiden World Cup three years later another tournament was held in Australia, marking 50 years of rugby league in the country. Unlike the previous tournament, teams played each other in a league format. It was then decided that the team that finished first in the league would be declared the winner. Australia proved victorious on their home ground.\nAnother three years would pass until the next World Cup in 1960, this time held in England. It would be the second time Great Britain won the competition. Despite a home nation victory the World Cup suffered from poor crowds due to the live broadcast of games for the first time.\n1960–1977: Sporadic competitions.\nAfter a disappointing attendances in 1960, the World Cup would not be played for another eight years. The competition had been scheduled to be held in France in 1965, this time with the inclusion of the South African team. However, after an unsuccessful tour of Australia, the French withdrew, effectively postponing the tournament until 1968, when Australia and New Zealand hosted and the World Cup final made a return.\nThe World Cup found more success in the 70s with four tournaments being played. The first, the 1972 World Cup where the final was contested between Great Britain and Australia ended 10–10, and the title was awarded to Great Britain by virtue of their superior record in the qualifiers. Great Britain were captained by Welshman Clive Sullivan who was the first black player to captain any British national sports team. The final at the Stade de Gerland in Lyon witnessed what is (as of 2021) the last British team to win the Rugby League World Cup.\nIn 1975, the competition underwent a radical overhaul with the tournament being held across multiple confederations. Great Britain was split into England and Wales due to Wales wanting to showcase the high level of talent they had on offer that year (no Scottish or Irish players made the original Great Britain squad). This resulted in the tournament increasing from four teams to five for the first time. There was not a final held to decide the champions of the 1975 tournament and so Australia won by virtue of topping the group standings. As Australia had not beaten England in that tournament a final challenge match was hastily arranged which Australia would win 25–0.\nIn 1977, Great Britain competed again as a single entity. Although the final between Australia and Great Britain was a closely fought affair, public interest in the tournament waned due to the continuing tinkering with the format and it was not held again until the mid-1980s.\n1982–1994: No host nation.\nFrom 1985 to 1988, each nation played each other a number of times on a home and away basis with a number of these games also being considered part of various international tours that took place during the years in which these world cups were being played. At the end of that period, Australia met New Zealand at Eden Park. The match was a physical encounter, and Australian captain Wally Lewis played part of the match with a broken arm. The Kangaroos won the competition 25–12 in front of a capacity crowd of nearly 48,000 spectators.\nThis format was repeated from 1989 to 1992 (with games once again also being part of tours) and Australia won again, defeating Great Britain 10–6 at Wembley Stadium in front of 73,361 people. This crowd remained a Rugby League World Cup record (and a record for any rugby league international match) until beaten by the 74,468 crowd which attended the 2013 World Cup final at Old Trafford. The fifth nation to compete in these two tournaments was Papua New Guinea, where rugby league is the national, and most popular, sport.\n1995–present: The modern World Cup.\n1995: Birth of the modern World Cup.\nIn 1995, the competition was held in England and Wales. It was again restructured, returning to the traditional \"host / co-host\" format, and intended (like in 1954) to be a triennial competition. The tournament expanded to ten teams with Fiji, Samoa, South Africa, and Tonga making their world cup deputes. Great Britain had also split permanently into England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, although only England and Wales qualified. Unlike previous tournaments where the top two teams in the table played in the final, a knockout stage was added, with quarter and semi-finals. Due to the Super League war, players aligned with the Super League competition were not selected by the ARL to represent Australia, which meant the absence of many star players. The tournament, which was also held to celebrate the centenary of the sport, saw over 250,000 people attending the group stages and over 66,000 people attending the final, in which Australia defeated England 16–8.\n2000: Super League delay, financial issues, and hiatus.\nIntended for 1998, the next World Cup was delayed for two years due to the Super League war and the subsequent re-structuring of rugby league's international governing bodies meant that the proposed 1998 World Cup was postponed.\nIn 2000, the World Cup was held in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France, and expanded the field further, with sixteen teams entering. This tournament included a New Zealand Maori representative team, the only time this team has taken part, as well as debuts for the Cook Islands, Ireland, Russia, and Scotland. Australia won the tournament by beating New Zealand 40–12 in the final at Old Trafford, Manchester. In the same year, the first Women's Rugby League World Cup was held, with New Zealand defeating Great Britain in the final.\nNumerous issues, including poor organization and blown-out scorelines, meant that this tournament was seen as highly unsuccessful with an average attendance just half that of the previous tournament. Due to these problems the competition was put on indefinite hiatus and replaced with the Rugby League Tri-Nations.\n2008: Re-establishment and regular competitions.\nAfter the failure of the 2000 World Cup, no plans were made for another tournament until 2008 with the competition reverting to a 10-team format. The tournament also moved from every three to every four years inline with most other major international sports competitions. Australia hosted the tournament and New Zealand were crowned champions for the first time by beating the host nation at Lang Park, Brisbane. The tournament was once again seen as a success with a 91% average attendance increase on the previous competition. New Zealand became only the third team to win the world cup and the first other than Australia since 1972.\n2013: Olympic delay and tournament growth.\n2013 saw England and Wales host the tournament and expanded to 14 teams. The tournament, originally scheduled for 2012, was moved very early in its organisation to 2013 due to the United Kingdom hosting the 2012 Summer Olympics. The competition was considered the most successful competition since 1995 in terms of attendances, exposure and financial output. The tournament saw Italy and the United States play in their first world cup. Australia took the title again after defeating New Zealand in the final by a score of 34–2. The final attendance became the record international rugby league attendance at 74,468.\n2017: Continued growth.\n2017 Rugby League World Cup taking place in Australia, New Zealand and for the first time in Papua New Guinea. While Australia would claim the title once again and for an eleventh time, the tournament was considered highly successful in terms of competitiveness. The tournament would see Tonga beat New Zealand in the group stages with a score of 28–22 to top the group, the first time a team from outside the top 3 had beaten a top 3 nation in over two decades. New Zealand went on to play Fiji in the quarter-finals and lost once again with a score of just 4–2, knocking New Zealand out in the quarter-finals, the first time a tier 1 nation had exited the tournament at this early stage. Tonga played England in the semi-finals and while conceding 20 unanswered points, they would score 3 tries in just the last seven minutes to pull the score back to 20–18, eventually losing by this close margin. The final was contested between Australia and England at Lang Park, Brisbane and Australia won by just 6–0, the lowest score in world cup final history.\n2021: Further growth despite COVID-19 impact.\nEngland were chosen to host the 2021 tournament which was postponed to 2022 due to Australia and New Zealand withdrawing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. with organisers expressing a desire to see a total of one million fans attend games. This tournament saw the number of teams increased to 16 once again, with Greece and Jamaica debuting in the competition. In 2021, the women's and wheelchair competitions were given equal prominence with the men's tournament, as a result all three competition were run simultaneously for the first time. Australia again won the competition, beating final debutants Samoa 30–10. The 2021 tournament was the most watched rugby league world cup in history, and was regarded as a sporting, commercial, and social success by the IRL.\n2025/26: Hosting issues.\nA proposal was put forward in 2016 to hold the 2025 Rugby League World Cup in the United States and Canada, but in December 2018 plans for the tournament to be held in North America were scrapped due to financial concerns.\nOn 11 January 2022, it was announced France would host the tournament in 2025, however on 15 May 2023 France pulled out of hosting the tournament after the French government withdrew financial support. A day later, New Zealand announced they were considering a bid, but would possibly require a delay to 2026.\nOn 3 August, the IRL announced that the tournament would be postponed to 2026 and held in the southern hemisphere with only 10 teams taking part.\n2030.\nWith the announcement of the 2025 World Cup to 2026 came confirmation that the following competition would be held in 2030. In the announcement International Rugby League confirmed that the tournament would be held once again as a stand alone competition with the women's and wheelchair tournaments held separately.\nTrophy.\nThe World Cup trophy was commissioned by French Fédération Française de Rugby à XIII president Paul Barrière at a cost of eight million francs, and then donated to the International Rugby League Board to be used for the inaugural competition in 1954. This trophy was used and presented to the winning nation for the first four tournaments, before being stolen in 1970. After its recovery, the trophy was reinstated for the 2000 tournament.\nFormat.\nQualification.\nQualifying rounds were first introduced for the 2000 World Cup. Hosts and teams reaching the knockout rounds of the previous tournament automatically qualify for the next. The remaining spots are achieved through regional qualification tournaments, split between the four International Rugby League confederation Asia-Pacific, Americas, Europe, and Middle East-Africa. Because of a changeing number of teams making the finals and entering the qualifiers, and the unpredictability of the geographic spread of teams automatically qualifying, the format of the qualification tournament has changed with each edition of the tournament.\nFinals.\nThe Rugby League World Cup has followed a varied range of formats throughout its history as the number of teams participating has increased.\nThe current format has been in use since the 2021 tournament, in addition to the 2000 tournament. This format features 16 teams split into four groups of four playing a single round robin. Each team is awarded two points for a win and one point for a draw. The top two teams from each group qualify for the knockout stage.\nThe eight teams in the quarter-finals play each other with the four winners progressing to the semi-finals before the World Cup final. If the teams are level after 80 minutes extra time will be played and if the two teams are still level after extra time, a golden point will be played.\nThis will be temporary altered for the 2026 tournament due to its late rescheduling, the exact format to be used remains unknown.\nHosts.\nDue to the early World Cups being contested between Australia, England, France and New Zealand and the fact rugby league is most popular in these regions they have regularly hosted the World Cup between themselves. World Cups in 1985–88 and 1989–92 were all jointly hosted by the four founding nations.\nNew Zealand has never solely hosted a World Cup but they have co-hosted with Australia on three occasions with 2017 also jointly co-hosted with Papua New Guinea. England have co-hosted once with Wales in 2013 although the 2000 World Cup was played across the UK as well as some games in Ireland and France.\nFrance hosted the first World Cup in 1954 and again in 1972 as well as hosting games at the 2000 and 2013 World Cups.\nDespite the World Cup mainly being hosted by England, Australia, France and New Zealand, countries such as UAE, South Africa and the United States and Canada have applied to host the tournament in the past. \n\"NB\": England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland were not IRL nations prior to 1995, therefore the United Kingdom is used to refer to the host nation during this time regardless of the number of home nations which actually hosted.\nStadiums.\nIn total, 81 stadiums have hosted world cup games over the 14 tournaments. Headingley Stadium in Leeds has hosted the tournament the most times, having had games in 7 world cups with Central Park, Wigan and Lang Park, Brisbane having hosted 6 tournaments. 52 stadiums have hosted matches in just 1 tournament. The most stadiums used in a tournament was in 2000 when 26 stadiums were used; the stadium capacity was the highest ever at 704,400. However, the occupancy was also the lowest ever at just 37.46%.\nThe largest stadium in terms of capacity ever used was Wembley Stadium, London with a seating capacity of 90,000; the stadium was used in the 2013 tournament as the venue for the semi-final double-header. The smallest stadium ever used was also in 2013 when The Gnoll, Neath, with a capacity of 5,000 hosted a game between Wales and Cook Islands. Despite this, it was not the lowest attended game; this was in the 2000 World Cup when just 1,497 attended the game between Wales and Lebanon at Stradey Park, Llanelli.\nThe cities with the most stadiums used are Sydney and London with 4 each. Hull and Auckland are the cities with the next highest number with 3 each.\nResults.\nSummary.\nIn total, 21 teams have competed at the World Cup. Of these, only three have won the World Cup, with Australia being by far the most successful with 12 titles. Great Britain has won three titles, however since 1995 have competed separately as England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. New Zealand became only the third team to win the World Cup in 2008.\nEngland, France and Samoa are the only teams to have played in the final and not won. Wales' best result was third under the old format and have made the semi-finals twice while Fiji have appeared in three while Tonga have made the semi-finals just once.\nPapua New Guinea achieved fourth place under the old format and have made it to three quarter-finals. Four other teams; Ireland, Lebanon, Scotland and the USA have all made the quarter-finals bringing the total amount of teams to reach the knockout stage to 14.\nRecords.\nMatch attendance.\nTop 10 match attendances."

        "text": "Troy Thompson is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who last played as a or as a second rower for the Melbourne Storm in the NRL. He previously played for the Canberra Raiders.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Canberra, Australia. Thompson was educated at Dickson College, Canberra, where he represented 1997 Australian Schoolboys.\nThompson played his junior football with West Belconnen Warriors.\nPlaying career.\nThompson made his first-grade debut playing for Canberra Raiders against the Broncos in round 21 of the 2001 season.\nIn 2005 he, along with Josh Miller, won the Raiders' \"Player of the Year\" award, becoming the first joint-winners in the club's history.\nThompson was told he would not be offered another contract when his current one expired at the end of the 2010 season. This caused Thompson to publicly attack the Raiders for not offering him a further deal, to which he felt he was entitled due to playing for the club for so long.\nThis was due to Canberra having signed Brett White, a more experienced representative player who played in the same position as Thompson at a higher level for similar amounts of money.\nThompson then went on to play with Melbourne Storm after signing with them for the 2011 season. Thompson made 7 appearances for the club and his last game in first grade was a 40–8 loss against the Sydney Roosters."

        "title": "Nightcliff Baseball Club",
        "text": "Nightcliff Baseball Club Inc. is an amateur baseball club located in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. Also known as \"the Tigers\", the club was formed in 1969 and competes in the Darwin Baseball League (DBL), latterly known as Baseball NT. It is also an affiliated member of the Nightcliff Sports Club.\nOperation.\nHistorically, baseball in Australia has been an amateur sport. As such, the club operates or functions under a constitution by a committee of volunteers, elected each calendar year. The club derives its income from player registration fees, sponsorship, grants, donations and fundraising activities. Because the club is an incorporated body, it operates as a legal business entity.\nThe club is based and trains at Nightcliff Middle School, Aralia Street, Nightcliff.\nHistory.\nEstablished in 1969, Nightcliff's origins stemmed from the Darwin Chinese Recreation Club (DCRC) Red Sox. The Red Sox disbanded earlier the same year, but several former players adopted the new club. Bob Melville was elected as the inaugural President, but resigned shortly afterwards following a disagreement with another committee member. He was replaced by Alan Smith, who remained President for the remainder of the season.\nNightcliff dominated the competition throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.\nThis period was known as Nightcliff's 'Golden Era' in which the club played in 12 consecutive Grand Finals, winning 9 of them.\nMany critics argued that if Nightcliff had not entered and played two teams during the 1972/73 season, they would have easily won that premiership. The two teams finished second and third. The 1974/75 season was cancelled following Cyclone Tracy and most of the clubs records were either lost or destroyed in the cyclone. However, in late March 1975, an unofficial Grand Final was played between Nightcliff and representatives of the other five clubs. Although Nightcliff won this game, it was not officially recognised by DBL.\nNightcliff Baseball Club was a foundation member of the Nightcliff Sports Club, but the committee held its regular meetings at the Seabreeze Hotel to discuss the affairs of the club. These meetings became well known as \"High Masses\" and continued until the Seabreeze Hotel was destroyed during Cyclone Tracy in December 1974. Thereafter, the club held its meetings at the Nightcliff Sports Club.\nIn the mid- to late 1980s, the club suffered both competitively and financially, arguably from the competition swapping, in 1984, from wet-season to dry-season. Nightcliff did not compete in the inaugural 1984 dry-season competition due to lack of players, but rejoined in 1985. In 1988, the club faced financial crisis and considered bankruptcy as the DBL threatened expulsion from the league. However, a lifelong Nightcliff supporter, Kay Thrupp, provided a financial lifeline and two major fund-raising efforts secured the club's financial position.\nBetween 1985 and 1989 the club entered a 'Rebuilding Era' with an emphasis on junior player development. Ultimately, the strategy proved too successful with several home-grown players subsequently pursuing baseball careers in southern states, where their opportunities were greater. Since 1990, the club has remained competitive. The period between 1990 and 2000 was known as the 'Kendray Era' in reference to Nightcliff's star player who dominated the competition, coached and led the club. During the 1990s, Nightcliff played in seven Grand Finals, winning a further three premierships.\nIn 1989, the club built a permanent baseball field at Nightcliff High School. In 1997, the club became an incorporated body, to reflect the changing way amateur sport was being administered in Australia.\nBetween 2000 and 2006, Nightcliff played in six of the possible seven Grand Finals, but failed to win any. This period was known as Nightcliff's 'Bridesmaid Era'. This era officially ended in 2007, when Nightcliff won the Grand Final against their long-time rivals, Tracy Village, 11–4.\nIn 2010, Nightcliff created a first in Northern Territory baseball history when the club appointed a woman, Narelle Gosstray, as their senior club coach.\nGosstray, a former Australian women's baseball representative and Aussie Hearts coach, was also the first woman appointed to coach an Australian junior baseball side. She was among the recipients of the 2010-11 Australian Sports Commission's Sport Leadership Grants and Scholarships for Women to further her development as a high performance baseball coach. In her first year as coach, the Tigers made the 2010 grand final after finishing with the wooden spoon the previous year. In the final, however, Nightcliff lost to their long-time rivals, Tracy Village 6–2.\nIn 2015 Nightcliff signed another woman player, 27-year-old left-hand pitcher Amy Collins, who won a bronze medal with the Australian women's team at the 2014 World Cup in Japan, where the opposition included baseball giants the US, Canada, Venezuela, Japan and Chinese Taipei. In her first game with the Tigers, Collins pitched a 26–5 winning game over the Palmerston Reds.\nPremiers.\n13 - 1970/71, 1971/72, 1973/74, 1975/76, 1976/77, 1977/78, 1978/79, 1979/80, 1981/82, 1991, 1993, 1999 and 2007.\nRunners up.\n17 - 1969/70, 1972/73, 1980/81, 1990, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2018.\nLife Members.\nThe constitution allows for Life Membership and is awarded on the basis of outstanding volunteer service to the club. At least 10 years of predominantly non-playing service is generally considered necessary to achieve Life Membership. Current Life Members with their year of induction follow:\n Deceased\nRepresentatives.\nClaxton Shield.\nBetween 1981 and 1988, the Northern Territory competed in the national Claxton Shield competition and the following Nightcliff players represented the NT.\nAustralia.\nSeveral Nightcliff registered players have represented Australia and they appear below.\nRetired numbers.\nThe constitution allows for a player's uniform number to be retired, if that player has played 15 or more seasons at 'A' grade level with the club.

        "title": "Atlantic Coast Conference baseball tournament",
        "text": "The Atlantic Coast Conference baseball tournament, sometimes referred to simply as the ACC tournament, is the conference championship tournament in baseball for the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). In 2017, the event adopted a modified twelve-team pool play format. The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\nHistory.\nThe ACC has a history of odd formats for its baseball championship. Since 1973, the first year of the tournament, the format has changed six times. The current format is a four-group, three-team round robin tournament with the winner of each grouping playing in a single-elimination tournament for the semifinals and final.\n1973–78.\n\"See Example: 1976 Atlantic Coast Conference baseball tournament\"\nFor the first six seasons of the tournament, the ACC had seven members, resulting in a format where the #1 seed received a bye to play the winner of the #4 v #5 match-up. The first round of the tournament was single-elimination with the losers going home. After the first round, the remaining 4 teams played a traditional double-elimination-style tournament.\n1979.\nDue to conflicts with exams, the ACC opted to not hold a tournament. Instead, the regular season winner Clemson was given the conference's automatic bid to the 1979 NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\n1980–2003.\n\"Example: 1981 Atlantic Coast Conference baseball tournament\"\nBeginning with the addition of Georgia Tech to the conference in 1980, the ACC began using a format closer to that of a true double-elimination tournament with a few exceptions.\nFrom TheACC.com :\n1991–2003.\nWith the introduction of Florida State into the ACC to bring the total teams to nine, the baseball tournament added a Play-In game where the bottom two teams in the conference regular season standings played in a winner-takes-all game for the 8th spot in the regular tournament.\n2004.\nIn 2004, the ACC began using a true eight-team double-elimination tournament with the bottom two teams in regular season conference play facing each other in a single-elimination game where the winner got the #8 spot in the regular tournament.\n2005.\nIn 2004, the conference expanded to 11 teams with the addition of Miami and Virginia Tech. Beginning with the 2005 Baseball Tournament, the tournament switched from a true eight-team double-elimination to two four-team double-elimination brackets with winner of each side playing in a winner-take-all championship game. The bottom four teams in conference play faced off in a single-elimination bracket, with the winner earning the #8 spot in the tournament.\n2006.\nIn 2005, Boston College joined the conference, bringing the total number of members to 12. Instead of adjusting the tournament yet again, the tournament would remain the same format as was developed in 2005, but the ACC eliminated the play-in round.\n2007–2013.\n\"See Example: 2007 Atlantic Coast Conference baseball tournament\"\nBeginning in 2007, the ACC developed a new tournament format that eliminated the brackets altogether. This new format was a two-group, four-team round robin tournament with the winner of each grouping playing in a winner-take-all championship game. Only the top eight teams in the regular season conference standings were invited to play in the tournament.\nOn July 6, 2009, the Atlantic Coast Conference announced a decision to move three future baseball tournaments out of Myrtle Beach, citing miscommunications with the NAACP concerning the display of the Confederate flag in South Carolina. (Charlotte was included in the NAACP Boycott because Knights Stadium was in York County, South Carolina, less than five kilometers from the state line.) The 2010 ACC tournament was initially scheduled to take place at Fenway Park, but cost-containment for schools (most of whom would have to fly to Boston) was cited for moving the tournament to Greensboro.\n2014–2016.\nBeginning in 2014, with the expansion of the conference, the tournament expanded to ten teams. The four lower seeds (7 vs 10 and 8 vs 9) played a one-game play-in game to participate in pool play with the 6 higher seeds.\n2017.\nOn September 14, 2016, the ACC announced that the 2017 tournament slated to be played in Durham, NC, along with neutral site championships for seven other sports, would be moved out of the state of North Carolina due to the controversial NC House Bill 2. On October 4, 2016, it was announced that Louisville Slugger Field in Louisville, Kentucky, would be the new host venue for 2017.\nOn October 6, 2016, the ACC announced that the tournament would expand to twelve teams and have a new format. The regular season winners of the Atlantic and Coastal divisions claim the top two seeds, while the remaining seeds are determined by conference winning percentage. The teams are split up into four pools of three teams each. The pools are a round robin format, with each team in the tournament guaranteed a minimum of two games. If a pool fails to produce a team with two wins, the top seed automatically advances. The four winners of pool play then advance to a four team, single-elimination bracket to determine the conference champion.\nChampions.\nBy school.\nAll current ACC members with baseball programs have appeared at least once in the tournament. Syracuse, which joined the conference in 2013, has not sponsored varsity baseball since 1972.\n\"Italics indicate school is no longer a member of the ACC.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Updated through 2023\""

        "text": "The 1993 Giro d'Italia, (), was the 76th edition of the race. It started off in Porto Azzurro on 23 May with a split stage, with the first leg being a mass-start stage and the latter an individual time trial. The race ended on 13 June with a stage that stretched from Biella to Milan. Twenty teams entered the race, which was won by Miguel Induráin of the team. Second and third respectively were the Latvian Piotr Ugrumov and the Italian rider, Claudio Chiappucci. Indurain's victory in the 1993 Giro was his first step in completing the Giro – Tour double – winning the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France in one calendar year – becoming the first rider to repeat this feat in consecutive years.\nMoreno Argentin was the first rider to wear the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" () after winning the opening stage. Argentin held that lead for ten more days before losing it to Miguel Induráin after the conclusion stage 10. Bruno Leali stole the lead away from Indurain after the race's eleventh leg and held it until the end of the fourteenth day of racing. Indurain gained the lead after mountainous stage 14 and then held it all the way to the Giro's finish in Milan.\nIndurain became the first Spanish rider to win the Giro d'Italia in consecutive years. Amongst the other classifications that the race awarded, Italian Adriano Baffi of won the points competition, 's Claudio Chiappucci won the mountains classification, 's Pavel Tonkov completed the Giro as the best rider aged 25 or younger in the general classification, finishing fifth overall, and Ján Svorada of Lampre-Polti won the intergiro competition. Lampre-Polti finished as the winners of the team classification, ranking each of the twenty teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. Ariostea finished as winners of the team points classification.\nTeams.\nTwenty teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1993 edition of the Giro d'Italia, seven of which were based outside of Italy. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 180 cyclists. Italy (78), France (24), Spain (17), Germany (11), and Colombia (10) all had more than 10 riders. Of these, 69 were riding the Giro d'Italia for the first time. The average age of riders was 27.69 years, ranging from 21–year–old Alexandr Shefer () to 35–year–old Bruno Leali (). The team with the youngest average rider age was (25), while the oldest was (29). From the riders that began the race, 132 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams that took part in the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton included the 1992 winner, Miguel Induráin, who had not had a successful start to his 1993 campaign. He hoped to repeat as winner of the Giro and the Tour for the second consecutive year, stating \"My main objective remains the Tour de France, but I will still try to win the Giro.\" If Indurain would win the two Grand Tours in the season, he would be the fourth rider to accomplish winning the Giro and Tour in one season twice in their career. Despite this, Indurain was viewed as the favorite to win the general classification. Maurizio Fondriest () was thought to have entered in peak form after winning several races in the spring campaign, including Milan–San Remo and Tirreno–Adriatico. \"El Mundo Deportivo\" writer Javier de Dalmases believed Fondirest would be the first rider to don the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" (). Indurain felt Fondriest was the rider to watch in the race's first week.\nGianni Bugno (), who won the race in 1990, prepared at lengths for the race and was seen as a threat in the time trial stages. Bugno won only one race before the Giro started, the Grand Prix Gippingen earlier in May, but was thought to have a strong showing at the Amstel Gold Race. Author Bill McGann dismissed Bugno saying that his ability to \"win at will\" had passed. With no victories in the season, 1991 winner and 3rd-place finisher in 1992, Franco Chioccioli () was considered a dark–horse contender. Other favorites named for the race included Pavel Tonkov and 1988 winner Andrew Hampsten as contenders for the overall crown. Claudio Chiappucci was thought to be one of the most potent climbers in the race. Specifically, a \"L'Express\" writer commented that Chiappucci's performance on the Sestriere time trial in the 1992 Tour de France as an example of his climbing prowess. In addition, he had several second-place finishes in the Giro and Tour the previous year.\nFamed sprinters Mario Cipollini and Djamolidine Abdoujaparov did not compete in the race, while Dutch sprinter Jean-Paul van Poppel was going to race in the Giro but was left off the roster before it started. With the aforementioned riders' absence, Dalmases stated that Italian Adriano Baffi would likely win some of the flat stages.\nRoute and stages.\nWhile the start on Elba was announced on 9 October, the entire route for the 1993 Giro d'Italia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 14 November 1992. It contained three time trial events, all of which were individual. There were nine stages containing high mountains, of which five had summit finishes: stage 3, to Sella di Corno; stage 13, to Passo delle Erbe; stage 15, to Lumezzane; stage 17, to Chianale; and stage 20, to Oropa. Another stage with a mountain-top finish was stage 19, which consisted of a climbing time trial to village of Sestriere. The organizers chose to include one rest day. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter, contained one more rest day, more mountains, and lacked an opening time trial prologue. In addition, this race contained one fewer stage, but two more sets of half stages. For the first time since 1954, when live coverage began, the race was not broadcast by RAI. Instead it was broadcast by Reti Televisive Italiane (RTI) on the Italia 1 channel.\nThe race began with a split stage on the island of Elba, where Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled briefly in 1814. This was the first time the race began on the island of Elba. The race last visited in 1980 where the race finished in Portoferraio with a sprint finish won by Carmelo Barone. The route contained less time trials than the 1992 route, which Italian rider Claudio Chiappucci had requested. The race's fourteenth stage, which began and ended in Corvara, was named the queen stage for the amount of difficult mountains contained in the stage. Italian rider Franco Chioccioli liked that there were more points of attack in the race and believed that played into Miguel Induráin's hands.\nRace overview.\nThis edition of the Giro began with a split stage, with the morning leg consisting of an undulating course and the afternoon stage being a brief individual time trial. Moreno Argentin won the morning stage after attacking on the final climb of the day to win the leg by thirty-four seconds over the chasing peloton. The afternoon time trial navigated the streets of Portoferraio and was won by Italian Maurizio Fondriest. The Giro's second stage was relatively a flat route that culminated with a sprint finish which was won by Adriano Baffi. The next day saw the first uphill finish to the Selle di Corno. General classification hopeful Piotr Ugrumov positioned himself in the day's breakaway and attacked up the final climb to win the stage and climb to second overall.\nThe Giro's fourth stage ended with a sprint finish that was won by Italian Fabio Baldato. Jolly Componibili–Club 88's Dimitri Konyshev attacked in the closing kilometers of the fifth stage to take the win. The day of racing concluded with a sprint finish in Messina, which was won by Italian Guido Bontempi. Bjarne Riis, Giancarlo Perini, and Michele Coppolillo made up the leading breakaway as the race made its way into the stage seven finish in Agrigento. Riis and Coppolillo pulled away from Perini in the final seconds and Riis subsequently edged out Perini for the victory. The race's eighth leg came down to a sprint finish in Palermo, where Adriano Baffi bested the likes of Endrio Leoni and Fabio Baldato for the win.\nThe race's ninth stage began in Montelibretti after the race necessitated the transfer to the city during the rest day the day before. The riders were preparing for a sprint finish when Giorgio Furlan and Mario Chiesa attacked with about of racing to go. The two riders successfully fended off the chasing peloton and went on to the finish in Fabriano, where Furlan managed to beat out Chiesa for the victory. The stage 10 individual time trial began and ended in the city of Senigallia. Miguel Induráin dominated the course and gained over a minute on race leader Moreno Argentin, which allowed him to gain the overall lead of the race and don the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" ().\nStage eleven was marred by rainy weather, which caused many splits in the peloton. Fabio Fontanelli won the stage as a member of the lead group, but tenth-place finisher Bruno Leali gained a six-second race lead by finishing more than three minutes in front of overall leader Miguel Induráin. The Giro's twelfth stage began with a large climb which led to many attacks. Despite the flurry of attacks, the whole peloton eventually made it to the finish line together for a sprint finish that was won by Russian Dimitri Konyshev.\nThe thirteenth stage saw the first stage that contained mountains from the Dolomites. On the penultimate climb of the day, the Passo di Eores, a lead group broke away that contained the likes of Andrew Hampsten, Ugrumov, and Massimiliano Lelli. The riders stayed out in front over the final climb of the Passi delle Erbe, but were eventually caught by the chase group containing the race leader Leoni. Moreno Argentin edged out Lelli for his second stage victory at the 1993 Giro d'Italia. The next day's route was even more demanding as it contained two ascents of the Passo Pordoi, as well as the climbing of three other highly categorized climbs. Miguel Induráin, Ugrumov, Claudio Chiappucci, and a few other general classification hopefuls were in the leading breakaway as they crossed the Pordoi for the second time. The group rode into the finish in Corvara with race leader Leoni trailing by several minutes. Chiappucci won the sprint to the line, while Indurain regained the overall lead.\nDavide Cassani won the fifteenth stage that featured a summit finish to Lumezzane, while the general classification remained largely unaltered. The next day of racing saw a break from the mountains, with a primarily flat course that stretched from Varazze to Pontechianale. The stage ultimately finished with a bunch sprint that was won by Italian Fabio Baldato. The Giro's seventeenth stage concluded with a summit finish to Chianale. Marco Saligari won the stage by over a minute on the second-place finisher Gianluca Bortolami, while the general classification contenders finished together leaving the classification largely unchanged. Stage eighteen was a primarily flat stage that closed with a field sprint. Adriano Baffi won the field sprint and the stage, which was his third stage victory at the Giro that year.\nThe final time trial in the 1993 Giro d'Italia was in length and had a summit finish on the famous climb of the Sestriere. Miguel Induráin won the leg and extended his lead over the rest of the field. The penultimate stage featured a climb to Oropa. Second overall |Piotr Ugrumov attacked multiple times on the final climb of the day to gain time on Indurain; he attacked one last time and Indurain could not match his move. Massimo Ghirotto was the first rider to cross the finish line, with Ugrumov finishing in fifth and Indurain in tenth. Ugrumov gained 40 seconds on Indurain's lead, but it was not good enough to take it away from the Spaniard. The final stage was a primarily flat course that stretched from Biella to Milan. The leg culminated with a bunch sprint that was won by Italian Fabio Baldato. Indurain had won his second consecutive Giro d'Italia.\nSuccess in stages was limited to nine of the competing teams, seven of which achieved multiple stage victories, while five individual riders won multiple stages. The riders that won more than once were Moreno Argentin in stages 1a and 13, Adriano Baffi in stages 2, 8, and 18, Fabio Baldato in stages 4, 16, and 21, Dimitri Konyshev in stages 5 and 12, and Miguel Induráin in stages 10 and 19. won two stages with Moreno Argentin and stage 3 with Piotr Ugrumov. Ariostea won four stages, with Bjarne Riis in stage 7, Giorgio Furlan in stage 9, Davide Cassani in stage 15, and Marco Saligari stage 17. won two stages with Miguel Induráin. won three stages with Fabio Baldato. Jolly Componibili–Club 88 won two stages with Dimitri Konyshev. won two stages, stage 6 with Guido Bontempi and stage 14 with Claudio Chiappucci. also won multiple stages, with Fabiano Fontanelli in stage 11 and three stages with Adriano Baffi.\n and ZG Mobili each won one stage apiece. Maurizio Fondriest of Lampre-Polti won the stage 1b individual time trial, while ZG Mobili rider Massimo Ghirotto won the mountainous stage 20.\nClassification leadership.\nFive different jerseys were worn during the 1993 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. Time bonuses were awarded to the riders who placed in the top three on flat stages, with first, second, and third receiving 12, 8, and 4, seconds bonus, respectively. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. \"The Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Passo Pordoi. The first rider to cross the Pordoi Pass was Spaniard Miguel Induráin. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1969 were eligible for it. The intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. For each intergiro sprint, the first three riders across the line would receive time bonuses of 6, 4, and 2 seconds, respectively. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also a classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time. There was another team classification that awarded points to each team based on their riding's finishing position in every stage. The team with the highest total of points was the leader of the classification.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nAftermath.\nMiguel Induráin entered the Tour de France in July as the favorite to win the race. He would go on to win the race after taking the lead after the conclusion of the ninth stage. By winning the Tour, he became the first rider to complete the Giro – Tour double in two consecutive years. In April 2018, Indurain was placed into the Giro d'Italia Hall of Fame for his performances during the Giro d'Italia in his career. He was the sixth rider to be inducted."

        "text": "The 1994 Giro d'Italia was the 77th edition of the race. The Giro started off in Bologna on 22 May with a short stage. The race came to a close on 12 June with a flat stage that stretched from Turin to Milan. Seventeen teams entered the race, which was won by Evgeni Berzin of the team. Second and third respectively were the Italian Marco Pantani and the Spanish rider, Miguel Induráin.\nBerzin first gained the race lead after the fourth stage where he attacked on the final climb to win the day. The race's overall classification was first headed by Endrio Leoni who won the Giro's opening road stage. However, Leoni lost the lead later that day during the afternoon individual time trial to Armand de Las Cuevas. De Las Cuevas held the lead for a single stage before losing it to Moreno Argentin who won the race's second stage. Argentin held the general classification lead for two stages, before Berzin took it after stage 4. After gaining the lead, Berzin began to build upon his advantage after winning the stage 8 and 18 individual time trials and maintaining good form throughout the mountains.\nBerzin became the first Russian to win the Giro d'Italia. Berzin also won the young rider classification for the best rider aged 25 or under in the general classification. In the race's other classifications, Swiss rider Pascal Richard won the mountains classification, and Djamolidine Abdoujaparov of was the winner of the points and intergiro classifications. finished as the winners of the team classification, which ranked each of the seventeen teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. finished as the winners of the team points classification, where the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage.\nTeams.\nA total of 18 teams were invited to participate in the 1994 Giro d'Italia, of which 17 participated. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 153 cyclists. Italy had the most riders participating with 80, while Germany (12) was the only country representation by more than 10 riders. Of these, 37 were riding the Giro d'Italia for the first time. The average age of riders was 27.95 years, ranging from 21–year–old Heinrich Trumheller () to 36–year–old Bruno Leali (). The team with the youngest average rider age was (26), while the oldest was (30). The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager were introduced in front the media and local dignitaries – took place on 22 May, in the courtyard of the Bologna. Of the riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 99 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton included 1993 winner, Miguel Induráin, who came into the race having only raced twenty days during the season according to author Bill McGann. In addition, there were reports surfacing before the race that Indurain's knee was troubling him. The race did not feature Tony Rominger, who elected to ride the Vuelta a España instead. \"El País\" writer Carlos Arribas felt that Evgeni Berzin had a strong spring with his victory in Liège–Bastogne–Liège and second-place finish in the Tour of the Basque Country. Arribas felt that Russian Pavel Tonkov, who had won the young rider classification the previous two years, would challenge for the victory as his normal team leader, Maurizio Fondriest, was absent from the race due to injury.\n\"Avui\"'s Adrian R. Huber believed that Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, Adriano Baffi, and Fabio Baldato had a great chance to win a stage in the race. Notable sprinter Mario Cipollini did not participate in the race as he was still recovering from injuries sustained in the second stage at the Vuelta a España.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1994 Giro d'Italia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 13 November 13, 1993, in Milan. The race route was leaked to the press before Castellano held the official presentation. It contained three time trial events, all of which were individual. There were ten stages containing high mountains, of which three had summit finishes: stage 4, to Campitello Matese; stage 20, to Les Deux Alpes; and stage 21, to Sestriere. Another stage with a mountain-top finish was stage 18, which consisted of a climbing time trial to the summit of the Passo dello Bocco. In total, the race featured of climbing. The organizers chose to include no rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was longer, contained one less rest day, and one more stage. The race was televised in Italy by Mediaset TV.\nThere were five stages that began or ended outside of Italy. Stage 12 ended in the Slovenian city Kranj and served as the start for the race's thirteenth stage. Stage 13 ended at Lienz in Austria, and the fourteenth began there. The Giro's mountainous stage 20 ended on the slopes of Les Deux Alpes, and the penultimate stage began on the mountain the next day.\nRace overview.\nThis edition of the Giro began with a split stage, with the morning leg consisting of a flat route and the afternoon part being a flat individual time trial. Italian Endrio Leoni won the morning stage by means of a sprint finish where the speeds were so high the peloton split in the final kilometer. Armand de Las Cuevas won the afternoon time trial by two seconds over Evgeni Berzin and in the process took the overall lead away from Leoni. Stage two featured an uphill finish into the city of Osimo. Moreno Argentin attacked close to the line and was able to distance himself from the rest of the peloton and win the stage, while also taking the lead of the race. Gianni Bugno failed several times to get away from the peloton before finally breaking free on the climb into Loreto Amprutino to win the third stage.\nStage 4 featured the race's first summit finish, with a final climb to the top of Campitello Matese. While on the climb, Evgeni Berzin attacked and made his way up to the top in first place. Due to his efforts, Berzin gained the overall lead of the race. The next two stages, 5 and 6, both came down to sprint finishes that were won by Endrio Leoni and Marco Saligari, respectively. The race's seventh stage saw the Spaniard Laudelino Cubino outsprint his fellow breakaway members for the stage victory. Stage 8 was a individual time trial that stretched from Grosseto to Follonica. The race leader Evgeni Berzin dominated the time trial as he won the stage by over a minute than the second-place finisher, which also allowed him to extend his lead in the general classification.\nThe next three stages of the race were all primarily flat, had no real impact on the overall standings, and all concluded with a bunch sprint. Ján Svorada won stage nine and then stage eleven after dodging a crash that marred the stage's finish. Djamolidine Abdoujaparov out-sprinted the rest of the field to win the race's tenth stage. The Giro's twelfth stage featured a few categorized climbs as the race made its way into Slovenia for the stage's finish in Kranj. Despite the climbs, the stage ended with a field sprint that was won by Andrea Ferrigato. Italian Michele Bartoli won the race's undulating thirteenth stage by being a part of the stage's initial breakaway and then attacking later on and soloing to the stage's conclusion in Lienz, Austria.\nAs the Giro left Austria, the race began to enter the Dolomites during stage fourteen. The eventual stage winner Marco Pantani was in a chasing group on the final climb of the stage, the Passo di Monte Giovo. He attacked, bridged the gap to the leading group, and left them behind to claim his first professional victory of his career. The next stage saw Pantani win again after he rode away from the attack group on the last climb of the Valico di Santa Cristina and he then soloed to the finish in Aprica. Pantani's efforts on the day moved him up to second overall in the race. The race's sixteenth stage took a break from the mountains with the stage being primarily fled, which ultimately led to the sprint finish that was won by Italian Maximilian Sciandri. Ján Svorada won the next day's stage after attacking from the breakaway group in the closing seconds.\nThe Giro's eighteenth stage was a individual time trial that stretched from Chiavari to the summit finish on the Passo del Bocco. The race leader Evgeni Berzin won the stage by twenty seconds over Miguel Induráin. Stage 19 saw the day of racing come down to a sprint finish that was won by Massimo Ghirotto. The twentieth stage saw the Giro race through the Alps and up to the summit of Les Deux Alpes for the stage finish. The lead group up Les Deux Alpes contained the likes of Evgeni Berzin, Marco Pantani, and Miguel Induráin who had attacked each other multiple times but to no avail. The trio was later joined by Vladimir Poulnikov and Nelson Rodríguez who both eventually left them to go on for the stage win. Poulkinov edged out Rodriguez to the stage win atop the mountain. The penultimate stage of the Giro saw a summit finish atop the Sestriere. The stage saw snow and chilling temperatures which led to the general classification contenders sticking together, while Pascal Richard went on to win the summit finish and solidify his lead atop the mountains classification. The Giro's final stage came down to a sprint finish that was won by Stefano Zanini as Evgeni Berzin won the Giro d'Italia.\nSuccess in stages was limited to eleven of the competing teams, six of which achieved multiple stage victories, while four individual riders won multiple stages. The riders that won more than once were Endrio Leoni in stages 1a and 5, Evgeni Berzin in stages 4, 8, and 18, Ján Svorada in stages 9, 11, and 17, and Marco Pantani in stages 14 and 15. Jolly Componibili-Cage won two stages with Leoni.

The team achieved several victories in stage races and one-day races during the year, including a sweep of the podium at La Flèche Wallonne weeks before the start of the Giro. Team doctor Michele Ferrari was banned for life from sports in 2012 by United States Anti-Doping Agency for distribution of performance-enhancing drugs to several of his clients.\nClassification leadership.\nFive different jerseys were worn during the 1994 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. The time bonuses for the 1994 Giro were twelve seconds for first, eight for second, and four seconds for third. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. \"The Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Stelvio Pass. The first rider to cross the Stelvio was Italian Franco Vona. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1970 were eligible for it. The intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. The first three riders to cross the intergiro line in each stage would receive a six, four, and two second time bonus, respectively. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

        "text": "The 1995 Giro d'Italia took place in May and June 1995. It was the 78th edition of the event. The Giro began on 13 May with a stage that began in Perugia and ended Terni. The race came to a close on 4 June with a stage that ended in the Italian city of Milan. The race was won by the Swiss Tony Rominger of the team. Second and third were the Russian rider Evgeni Berzin and Latvian rider Piotr Ugrumov.\nMario Cipollini won the event's first leg in a bunch sprint, allowing him to be the first rider to don the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" (). The following stage was an individual time trial that was won by Rominger, who also gained enough time on Cipollini to take the race lead. Rominger built upon his lead by winning the remaining two time trial stages, along with the hilly stage 4, and retained the lead for the duration of the race. By winning the Giro he became the third Swiss rider to win the event.\nIn addition to the general classification, Tony Rominger also won the points and intergiro classifications. rider Mariano Piccoli won the mountains classification. finished as the winners of the team classification. The team points classification, a system in which the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team, was also won by Gewiss–Ballan.\nTeams.\nA total of 22 teams were invited to participate in the 1995 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 198 cyclists. Italy had the most riders participating with 85, while only Spain (28) and France (15) were represented by more than 10 riders. Of these, 81 were riding the Giro d'Italia for the first time. The average age of riders was 27.76 years, ranging from 19–year–old Sandro Giacomelli () to 35–year–old Giancarlo Perini (). The team with the youngest average rider age was (25), while the oldest was (29). Of the riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 122 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton included Evgeni Berzin, the 1994 winner. Berzin's team, , also brought Latvian Piotr Ugrumov, a two-time Grand Tour runner-up. The two riders had developed a mutual distaste for each other. \"El País\" writers Paolo Viberti and Carlos Arribas believed that Swiss rider Tony Rominger and Latvian Piotr Ugrumov were the favorites to win the race, while several named Rominger as the sole favorite. Author Bill McGann believed that Rominger and Berzin were in great form coming into the race. Specifically, Rominger returned to the Giro after a six-year absence and, more recently, coming off of a victory at the Tour de Romandie. Urgumov was seen as the primary challenger for Rominger for his performances at previous Giros and his knack for showing great form in the final week after remaining quiet in the first two weeks. Aside from Rominger and Berzin, \"El Punt\"'s Luis Simon named 1988 winner Andrew Hampsten, Russian Pavel Tonkov, and Claudio Chiappucci amongst several other riders that could challenge for the overall title.\nItalian Marco Pantani was seen by some to be a contender for to win the race. However, Pantani crashed during a training ride on 1 May and did not recover in time to participate. Two-time winner Miguel Induráin chose not to enter the race in favor of preparing for the Tour de France. Instead, Indurain rode the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. Twelve of the UCI Road World Cup top 20 ranked cyclists did not compete in the Giro d'Italia.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1995 Giro d'Italia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 12 November 1994 in Milan. It contained three time trial events, all of which were individual. There were thirteen stages containing high mountains, of which five had summit finishes: stage 8, to Massiccio del Sirino; stage 11, to Il Ciocco; stage 14, to Schnals; stage 15, to Lenzerheide; and stage 20, to Gressoney-Saint-Jean. The organizers chose to include one rest day. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was longer, contained one more rest day, and the same number of stages. The nineteenth stage was regarded as the queen stage as it featured the climbs of the Col Agnel, Col d'Izoard, and Colle di Sampeyre.\nThe race route began in Perugia and traveled throughout the southern half of Italy for the first ten stages. After the stage 10 individual time trial, the riders were transferred to Tuscany by airplane, where the race remained in the northern half of the country and proceeded to cross into the higher and tougher mountains. There were a total of three stages that started outside Italy. Stage 15 ended in the Swiss city Lenzerheide and served as the start for the race's sixteenth stage. The mountainous twentieth stage began in the French city of Briançon.\nThe nineteenth stage was originally planned to stretch from Mondovì to Briançon over . The stage finish was moved to part way up the ascent of the Col Agnel, due to avalanches. The stage finished in Pontechianale where the day's intermediate sprint had been planned after of racing. The avalanche trapped several fans that had gotten their earlier, along with their cars. Ten spectators were injured and two were taken to the hospital.\nChiappucci believed that the descents of the mountains included in the race were very difficult. An \"El País\" writer found the route to be more mountainous than in years past. In addition, the writer mentioned that the increase in mountains within the route coupled with the reduced number of time trial kilometers, including the lack of a prologue, favored Marco Pantani. Three-time winner Gino Bartali believed that the route for the Giro was harder than the same year's Tour de France course.\nRace overview.\nMario Cipollini won the race's opening stage by several bike lengths to don the race's first \"maglia rosa\" (). Cipollini lost the lead to Tony Rominger following the stage 2 individual time trial that was contested in rainy conditions. Rominger was able to gain almost a minute on each of the main general classification contenders including Piotr Ugrumov and Evgeni Berzin. The third stage was Cipollini's second stage victory as he won the bunch sprint. The fourth stage was contested on a set circuit that was covered four times. The day's breakaway managed to get a maximum of 14' 25\" before gradually being pulled in. Claudio Chiappucci attacked on the final lap but was pulled back in by the chasing peloton. Ugrumov, Berzin, and Berzin's teammate Vladislav Bobrik then attacked and managed to form a gap. Rominger chased after and caught the riders, then passed them and went on to win the stage.\nThe event's fifth leg saw a breakaway succeed; the group began with five riders and was reduced to three riders – Erik Breukink, Filippo Casagrande, and Rolf Sørensen – before the finish. Casagrande won the three-man sprint to the line to take the day. The sixth stage resulted in a field sprint that was won by Nicola Minali. The seventh stage featured an undulating stage profile, with a slight uphill finish. On the race's final incline, Rominger attacked but his move was marked by several general classification contenders. Maurizio Fondriest managed to edge out Rominger in a dash for the line which saw him gain four seconds on Rominger due to time bonuses. The eighth stage featured the first summit finish of the race, to Massiccio del Sirino. The day's breakaway was established early on in the day and managed to reach the final climb before the pursuing peloton. Stage winner Laudelino Cubino attacked with eight kilometers to go and rode solo until the finish; the time he gained during the stage allowed him to move into third overall.\nThe ninth day of racing resulted in a bunch sprint that was won by Sørensen. The next stage of the race was a forty-two kilometer individual time trial. Race leader Rominger won the leg by one minute and twenty-four seconds and increased his overall lead to three minutes over Casagrande, who was in second place overall. Enrico Zaina and Nelson Rodríguez Serna were the first two riders to reach the stage's final climb of Il Cioccio and the two stayed out in front until the finish which saw Zaina win the race to the line. With four kilometers left in the stage, Ugrumov and Berzin attempted to crack Rominger by attacking him repeatedly. After several attacks where the riders moves were marked, the riders agreed to ride to the finish together. The twelfth stage of the race saw the peloton arrive at the finish together ready for a bunch sprint. Cipollini originally won the stage but was relegated to last place on the stage after having been found to have leaned on Mario Manzoni during the dash to the line. Ján Svorada, who had come in second, was then made the stage winner.\nThe thirteenth stage saw the race begin to enter the smaller mountains within the Dolomites. The day's breakaway formed on the climb of San Valentino. As the riders approached the finish, Pascal Richard edged Oliverio Rincón for the stage victory. The following stage featured a summit finish to Val Senales after a twenty kilometer climb. With eight kilometers to go, Berzin, Rominger, Ugrumov, and Rincón were in the leading group together. Rincón attacked and was allowed to ride solo to victory. Ugrumov attacked shortly after and Rominger was only able to follow initially; however, Berzin was able to merge back with the two riders and the trio then rode to the finish together. Casagrande lost a large amount of time during the stage. Mariano Piccoli won the fifteenth leg after being a part of the day's breakaway that managed to survive until the finish. On the descent of the second to last climb, Berzin attacked in an attempt to join the breakaway. Berzin was caught before the start of the stage's final mountain pass. Ugrumov and Berzin repeatedly attacked Rominger on the final climb, but Rominger was able to neutralize each attack.\nThe sixteenth leg was a downhill stage from the Swiss Alps. A breakaway did form but was caught before the run into the finish as the peloton prepared for a sprint finish. The stage was initially won by Giovanni Lombardi, but he was deemed by race judges to have had an irregular sprint and the victory was awarded to the second placed rider Giuseppe Citterio. The next day consisted of a climbing time trial to Selvino. Rominger extended his advantage over all his competitors by winning the stage by a margin of one minute and thirty-nine seconds over Berzin. The eighteenth stage was plagued by rainy conditions throughout the undulating course. The day's breakaway consisted of sixteen riders, which Tony Rominger's Mapei team chose not to chase down. Denis Zanette and Giuseppe Guerini formed an attack group from the breakaway and rode into the finish where Zanette managed to edge out Guerini for the win. The main contenders did not have any time gaps during the stage, leaving the general classification unchanged.\nThe nineteenth leg saw a breakaway of nine riders form off the front of the peloton. While racing, the finish line of the stage was moved to Pontechinale, a location that was part way up the climb of the Col Agnel because several avalanches occurred near the summit and prevented the riders from passing. Richard was the first rider to reach the new finish line and thus won his second stage. Serguei Outschakov won the following stage after being a part of the day's breakaway that dwindled as the stage wore on; he out-raced the only other remaining member Richard to win the stage. Behind, Urgrumov attacked and was only marked by both Berzin and Rincon, while Rominger trailed behind. Berzin and Ugrumov refused to work with one another and did not extend their advantage over Rominger. Rominger wound up losing minimal time. The race's penultimate stage was marred by rain. On the second ascension of the Cuvignone, Berzin attacked and was able to distance himself; however, he gave up the attack near the summit. He attacked again on the race's final climb of Salita di Montegrino Valtravaglia. Berzin rode solo to win the stage and managed to gain twenty-five seconds on Ugrumov and Rominger. The final leg of the race was decided through a bunch sprint that was won by Giovanni Lombardi. Rominger became the third Swiss rider to win the Giro.\nThree riders achieved multiple stage victories: Cipollini (stages 1 and 3), Rominger (stages 2, 4, 10, and 17), and Richard (stages 13 and 19). Stage wins were achieved by eleven of the twenty-one competing squads, eight of which won multiple stages. Mapei–GB–Latexco had four stage wins through Rominger. MG Maglificio–Technogym won a total of three stage wins with Richard and Rolf Sörensen (stage 9). Six teams won two stages. These were Mercatone Uno–Saeco (through Cipollini), Lampre–Panaria (Fondriest on stage 7 and Svorada on stage 12), Brescialat (Casagrande on stage 5 and Piccoli on stage 15), Aki–Gipiemme (Citterio on stage 16 and Zanette on stage 18), Gewiss–Ballan (Minali on stage 6 and Berzin on stage 21), and Polti–Granarolo–Santini (Outschakov on stage 20 and Lombardi on stage 22). Kelme-Sureña, Carrera Jeans–Tassoni, and ONCE each won a single stage at the Giro, through Cubino (stage 8), Zaina (stage 11), and Rincón (stage 14), respectively.\nClassification leadership.\nFour different jerseys were worn during the 1995 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. \"The Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Col Agnel, but it was not climbed due to avalanches that prevented the riders from being able to pass on the roads. The intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey.\nAlthough no jersey was awarded, there was also a classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time. There was another team classification that awarded points to each team based on their riding's finishing position in every stage. The team with the highest total of points was the leader of the classification.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

        "text": "The 1996 Giro d'Italia was the 79th edition of the Giro. It began on May 18 with a mass-start stage that began and ended in the Greek capital Athens. The race came to a close on June 9 with a mass-start stage that ended in the Italian city of Milan. Eighteen teams entered the race that was won by the Russian Pavel Tonkov of the Panaria–Vinavil team. Second and third were the Italian rider Enrico Zaina and Spanish rider Abraham Olano.\nSilvio Martinello led the race for four of the first five stages because of his victory in the first stage and high-placing on the fourth stage. Stefano Zanini briefly took the lead away from Martinello following the third stage that featured a more mountainous stage profile. After winning the event's sixth stage, Pascal Hervé overtook Zanini for the lead for a single day, after which Davide Rebellin captured the lead with his winning efforts on the seventh day. Eventual winner Tonkov obtained the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" () when he finished the thirteenth stage. Tonkov kept the jersey for the rest of the race, except where he lost it to Olano by 46 hundredths of a second at the end of stage 20, but regained it the following day.\nIn the race's other classifications, Brescialat rider Mariano Piccoli won the mountains classification and Fabrizio Guidi of the team won the points classification and the intergiro classification. finished as the winners of the team classification, ranking each of the eighteen teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time of each team's top three riders per stage. The other team classification, the team points classification, where the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team was won by Panaria–Vinavil.\nTeams.\nEighteen teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1996 edition of the Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a \"peloton\" of 162 cyclists. From the riders that began the race, 98 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting \"peloton\" did not feature the 1995 winner, Tony Rominger. The three main contenders named by the media included: Evgeni Berzin, Abraham Olano, Pavel Tonkov. \"El País\"'s Carlos Arribas felt Olano was a contender, but questioned his ability as an elite rider. Doctor Michele Ferrari named Evgeni Berzin, Olano, and Pavel Tonkov in order of the chance of winning the race. According to Arribas, Berzin was not in great form coming into the race, but his team doctor, Gianni Mazzoni, believed he could regain the form that helped him win the Giro in 1994. Berzin also had a fully committed team to support him this year, unlike in the previous edition where he and his teammate Piotr Ugrumov did not cooperate and worked against each other. Lluis Simon of \"El Punt\" felt Olano had performed better than Berzin in the recent Tour de Romandie.\nSimon believed that with the absence of Marco Pantani due to a crash at Milano–Torino, the Italian with the best chance to win was Francesco Casagrande. It was thought that the route was designed to allow Pantani a good chance to win. Due to the large amount of mountains in the final week, Swiss Pascal Richard was thought to have a chance for a high ranking in the general classification. Latvian Piotr Ugrumov (Roslotto–ZG Mobili), at age 35, was thought to have a good chance for victory and potentially one of his last good chances to win a Grand Tour. Young Ukrainian Alexander Gontchenkov showed great potential during the early season and many thought he could be a rider to place high in the general classification. Two-time champion Miguel Induráin and Laurent Jalabert did not participate in the race.\nRoute and stages.\nOn 12 May 1995, Athens was announced as the host of the start of the 1996 Giro d'Italia in order to honor the centennial edition of the Modern Olympics. The complete race route was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 11 November 1995 in Milan. It contained one time trial event, an individual one. There were ten stages containing high mountains, of which four had summit finishes: stage 7, to Massiccio del Sirino; stage 13, to Prato Nevoso; stage 20, to Passo Pordoi; and stage 21, to Aprica. The organizers chose to include one rest day. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was longer, contained two fewer individual time trials, and the same number of stages.\nThe opening stage (known as the Grande Partenza) started in Athens, Greece, and the race stayed on Greek soil for three stages as it made its way to north-west Ioannina. The race then transferred to Ostuni located in southern Italy and the race gradually moved north. The sixth and seventh stages included a couple higher categorized climbs from the Apennines. The race continued to move north and enter the Alps starting in stage 13. The race's fourteenth stage finished in the French city of Briançon, which also served as the start for the next stage. Stage 14 included the climbing of the Col d'Izoard and the Col de la Madeleine, which was viewed as a key stage in the general classification race. After returning to Italian soil, stage 16 came to an end in the Swiss city of Lausanne, which also was the start for the seventeenth stage. The race traveled back east across Italy and going north into the Dolomites and heading west and turning south to reach the finish in Milan. In total, there were seven stages that start or finished outside Italy.\nThe 1996 route saw a decrease in the number of kilometers that were dedicated to time trials and the removal of the climbing time trial that had been a staple in years past. Lluis Simon of \"El Punt\" felt that the penultimate stage that crossed Mendola, Tonale Pass, Gavia Pass, Mortirolo, and Aprica would be the hardest of the race. Paolo Viberti, a writer for \"El País\", believed that the race would be decided by the final week when the race entered the Alps and the lengthy individual time trial.\nRace overview.\nThe opening day of racing witnessed several crashes due to the poor road conditions and encroachment from cars that resulted in the abandonment of a few riders. The day's breakaway obtained a maximum advantage of two minutes over the \"peloton\", before being caught with left. Following an unsuccessful solo-attack by Serguei Outschakov, the stage culminated with a bunch sprint taken by 's Silvio Martinello. The riders protested the conditions they were subjected to on the first stage by riding the second stage at a significantly slower pace than usual. The stage ended with a bunch sprint, won by Glenn Magnusson, that was limited in terms of organization for each team because of the narrowness of the roads. The third stage ended in the same fashion, with Giovanni Lombardi winning the day, while the race lead moved to Stefano Zanini because of time bonuses he earned for finishing high in the stage. Several breakaways formed and were caught during the fourth stage, with the final one being caught with under a kilometer remaining. Saeco took control of the \"peloton\" and successfully conducted a lead out for their sprinter Mario Cipollini who claimed victory. In addition, Martinello regained the race lead and with it, the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" ().\nÁngel Edo of team won his first sprint victory since the 1994 season on stage five. The sixth leg of the race was the first to feature several higher categorized climbs. 's Pascal Hervé won the stage by a margin of four seconds and moved into the first place in the general classification. The seventh day of racing featured the first summit finish, to Massiccio del Sirino. Latvian Piotr Ugrumov attacked with seven kilometers to go and was able to distance himself from a group of contenders that included Abraham Olano, Hervé, Pavel Tonkov, and Davide Rebellin. Berzin made a move to follow with five kilometers remaining, a move that dropped Olano and Hervé. Rebellin attacked with three kilometers to go, which only Tonkov and Stefano Faustini could mark. As the trio reached the line, Rebelling edged out the other two for the win while also obtaining the race lead. In what was thought to be an easy day in the saddle, Claudio Chiappucci and two teammates made a move with ninety kilometers left in the flat, eighth stage. The trio of riders established a large enough lead to give Chiappucci the virtual race lead. Amore &amp; Vita-Galatron and Saeco took control of the \"peloton\" and lifted the pace with under twenty kilometers left. Chiappucci's group was caught before the finish and the sprinter's set up for a field sprint, which was won by Cipollini.\nThe ninth leg featured more attacks from the Carrera team, particularly from Enrico Zaina who attacked throughout the stage's closing kilometers. The \"peloton\" finished in fragments to the numerous attacks that occurred in the final fifteen kilometers, with the winning attack coming from Zaina and Gontchenkov. Zaina dropped Gontchenkov near the finish and won the stage by four seconds over a large chasing group. The tenth leg was a mountainous stage that navigated through Tuscany. A group of six formed at the front of the race with eleven kilometers left from which Rodolfo Massi attacked and went on to win the stage. Behind the leaders, several general classification contenders made attacks, but all failed to produce any significant time gains. The eleventh stage resulted in a sprint finish won by Cipollini, as the race prepared to enter the higher and more difficult mountains. The twelfth stage witnessed the day's breakaway survive the encroaching \"peloton\" by two seconds. Fabiano Fontanelli won the sprint to the line between the surviving members of the original eight-man lead group, it was his fifth victory of the season that came from participating in a breakaway.\nPanaria–Vinavil's Pavel Tonkov won the thirteenth leg because of a move he made with three kilometers left on the final climb Prato Nevoso. Piotr Ugrumov was the only rider to mark Tonkov, but he was dropped shortly before the finish and crossed the line two seconds after Tonkov. Rebellin crossed the line 33 seconds after Tonkov and ceded the lead to Tonkov. During the mountainous fourteenth stage, the group of general contenders re-grouped after efforts by Panaria–Vinavil to bring Tonkov up to the leading group before starting the ascent of the Col d'Izoard. On the climb, Pascal Richard attacked and rode solo over the mountain, while Chiappucci made an effort to bridge the gap but failed to reach Richard. Richard won the stage, Chiappucci crossed the line 43 seconds after Richard, while several race contenders finished just seconds after Chiappucci. 1990 Giro winner Gianni Bugno won the fifteenth stage as the top ten positions of the general classification remained the same and Chiappucci being the only rider to gain time on the rest of the top ten, gaining two seconds.\nThe sixteenth leg's breakaway initially started with nineteen riders. Alexander Gontchenkov attacked out of the group and rode solo to the finish to win the stage, while time gaps between general classification contenders again did not change. Laurent Roux and Nicolaj Bo Larsen started the breakaway during the seventeenth stage and did not get caught by the \"peloton\", staying out in front for . The \"peloton\" was gearing up for a chase with around to go, but race leader Tonkov suffered an issue with his bike and chose to wait for the team car to get another bike. This incident caused the field to slow their pace and wait for the leader, which caused the group to cross the line over sixteen minutes behind the winners. The next stage was won by Cipollini by means of a sprint finish, his fourth stage of the race. The nineteenth stage was a lengthy time trial that stretched from Vicenza to Marostica. Evgeni Berzin won the stage by a single second over Spanish rider Olano. Olano's performance on the stage brought him into second place overall by one second, while Urgrumov only managed to gain six seconds on Tonkov – placing him fourteen seconds behind.\nThe twentieth stage featured several high climbs in the Alps, including the Passo Pordoi, also the sight of the stage's conclusion. As the race entered the Marmolada, the day's breakaway had been captured and a select group featuring the likes of Olano, Berzin, Zaina, race leader Tonkov, Ivan Gotti, and Ugrumov led the way. Zaina made the first move from the group, which managed to only drop Berzin. Zaina attacked repeatedly and was able to rider alone until the finish atop the Pordoi to gain his second stage win of the race. Behind, Gotti gave chase, finishing 47 seconds down. In a dash to the line, Bugno edged out Olano for third place and the accompanying time bonus; however Olano did establish a one-second margin between himself and Tonkov, allowing him to take the pink jersey by 46 hundredths. The penultimate stage was filled with more climbs in the Alps, including the Passo di Gavia and the Tonale Pass. Serious attacks by race contenders began on the penultimate climb of the Mortirolo where Zaina started attacking first. Gotti, Tonkov, and Ugrumov followed Zaina's moves, while Olano was unable to follow. By the time Olano reached the summit of the Mortirolo, he was two minutes behind the leading riders. Gotti and Tonkov eventually dropped Ugrumov and Zaina on the final climb into Aprica. Gotti won the day, while Tonkov finished three seconds later and regained the lead by over two minutes. Olano's time loss during the stage moved him into third position overall. The race's final stage resulted in a sprint finish that was won by Serguei Outschakov. Tonkov won his first Grand Tour, and was the second Russian to win the race.\nTwo riders achieved multiple stage victories: Cipollini (stages 4, 8, 11, and 18) and Zaina (stages 9 and 20). Stage wins were obtained by eleven of the eighteen competing squads, six of which won multiple stages. Saeco–AS Juvenes San Marino amassed five stages wins through Cipollini and Silvio Martinello (stage 1). MG Maglificio–Technogym had three stages wins with Fontanelli (stage 12), Richard (stage 14), and Bugno (stage 15). Team Polti also collected three stages wins through Lombardi (stage 3), Rebellin (stage 7), and Outschakov (stage 22). Three teams won two stages. Amore &amp; Vita-Galatron (through Magnusson on stage 2 and Bo Larsen on stage 17), Carrera Jeans–Tassoni (with Zaina), and Gewiss Playbus (Berzin on stage 19 and Gotti on stage 21). Five teams ended the race with one stage win: Kelme–Artiach (through Edo on stage 5), Festina–Lotus (with Hervé on stage 6), Refin-Mobilvetta (Massi on stage 10), Panaria–Vinavil (with Tonkov on stage 13), and Roslotto–ZG Mobili (Gontchenkov on stage 16).\nClassification leadership.\nFour different jerseys were worn during the 1996 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. \"The Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Passo di Gavia and was first climbed by the Colombian Hernán Buenahora. The intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey.\nAlthough no jersey was awarded, there was also a classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time. There was another team classification that awarded points to each team based on their riding's finishing position in every stage. The team with the highest total of points was the leader of the classification.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. Other awards included the most combative classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Italian Fabrizio Guidi won the most combative classification. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. and were the most successful in avoiding penalties, and so were both winners of the Fair Play classification."

        "text": "The 1997 Giro d'Italia was the 80th edition of the Giro. It began on 17 May with a mass-start stage that began and ended in Venice. The race came to a close on 8 June with a mass-start stage that ended in the Italian city of Milan. Eighteen teams entered the race that was won by the Italian Ivan Gotti of the team. Second and third were the Russian rider Pavel Tonkov and Italian Giuseppe Guerini.\nIn the race's other classifications, rider Chepe González won the mountains classification, Mario Cipollini of the Saeco team won the points classification, and rider Dimitri Konyshev won the intergiro classification. Kelme – Costa Blanca finished as the winners of the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" classification, ranking each of the eighteen teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. The other team classification, the \"Trofeo Super Team\" classification, where the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team was won by Saeco.\nTeams.\nEighteen teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1997 edition of the Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 180 cyclists. From the riders that began the race, 110 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe eighteen teams that took part in the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1997 Giro d'Italia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 9 November 1996 in Milan. It contained two time trial events, all of which were individual. There were ten stages containing high mountains, of which three had summit finishes: stage 5, to Monte Terminillo; stage 14, to Breuil-Cervinia; and stage 20, to Passo del Tonale. The organizers chose to include one rest day. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter, contained the same amount of rest days and stages, as well as one more individual time trial.\nClassification leadership.\nFour different jerseys were worn during the 1997 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. \"The Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Pordoi Pass and was first climbed by the Colombian José Jaime González. The intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

        "title": "List of boxing quintuple champions",
        "text": "A quintuple champion in boxing refers to a boxer who has won world titles in five different categories of weight.\nRecognition.\nMajor sanctioning bodies.\nThese \"Big 4\" sanctioning bodies are considered \"major\" enough to award championships. They are arranged in order of foundation:\n\"The Ring\".\nThe Ring, boxing's most respected magazine, has awarded world championships in professional boxing within each weight class from its foundation in 1922 until the 1990s, and again since 2001. \"The Ring\" champions were at one point held the linear reign to the throne, the man who beat the man. The lineal champion is also known as the true champion of the division. \"The Ring\" stopped giving belts to world champions in the 1990s but began again in 2002. \nIn 2002, \"The Ring\" attempted to clear up the confusion regarding world champions by creating a championship policy. It echoed many critics' arguments that the sanctioning bodies in charge of boxing championships had undermined the sport by pitting undeserving contenders against undeserving \"champions\", and forcing the boxing public to see mismatches for so-called \"world championships\". \"The Ring\" attempted to clear up the confusion regarding world champions by creating a championship policy that is \"intended to reward fighters who, by satisfying rigid criteria, can justify a claim as the true and only world champion in a given weight class.\" \"The Ring\" claims to be more authoritative and open than the sanctioning bodies' rankings, with a page devoted to full explanations for ranking changes. A fighter pays no sanctioning fees to defend or fight for the title at stake, contrary to practices of the sanctioning bodies. Furthermore, a fighter cannot be stripped of the title unless he loses, decides to move to a different weight division, or retires.\nThere are currently only two ways that a boxer can win \"The Ring\"'s title: defeat the reigning champion; or win a box-off between the magazine's number-one and number-two rated contenders (or, sometimes, number-one and number-three rated). A vacant \"Ring\" championship is filled when the number-one contender in a weight-division battles the number-two contender or the number-three contender (in cases where \"The Ring\" determines that the number-two and number-three contenders are close in abilities and records).\nIn May 2012, citing the number of vacancies in various weight classes as primary motivation, \"The Ring\" unveiled a new championship policy. Under the new policy, \"The Ring\" title can be awarded when the No. 1 and No. 2 fighters face one another or when the Nos. 1 and 2 contenders choose not to fight one another and either of them fights No. 3, No. 4 or No. 5, the winner may be awarded \"The Ring\" belt. In addition, there are now six ways for a fighter to lose his title: lose a fight in his championship weight class; move to another weight class; not schedule a fight in any weight class for 18 months; not schedule a fight in his championship weight class for 18 months, even if fighting at another weight class; not scheduling a fight with a top 5 contender in any weight class for two years; or retiring.\nMany media outlets and members are extremely critical of the new championship policy and state that if this new policy is followed \"The Ring\" title will lose the credibility it once held.\nLineal.\nThe Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB) hands out the official version of the lineal championship. TBRB awards vacant championships when the two top-ranked fighters in any division meet and currently recognizes legitimate world champions or \"true champions\" each weight classes. The Board was formed to continue where \"The Ring\" \"left off\" in the aftermath of its purchase by Golden Boy Promotions in 2007 and the following dismissal of Nigel Collins. After the new editors announced a controversial new championship policy in May 2012, three prominent members of the Ring Advisory Panel resigned. This three members (Springs Toledo, Cliff Rold and Tim Starks) became the founding members of the \"Transnational Boxing Rankings Board\", which was formed over the summer of 2012 with the assistance of Stewart Howe of England.\nSince 2012, lineal champions are predetermined by the \"Transnational Boxing Rankings Board\", which promotes the concept of a singular world champion per weight class. Lineal champions are listed on \"Cyber Boxing Zone\" website which list lineal champions of the \"Queensberry Era\" to date.\nMinor sanctioning bodies.\nThe International Boxing Organization (IBO) is sometimes included in the list of major boxing organizations. \nBesides the IBO, there are other sanctioning bodies. They are: World Professional Boxing Federation (WPBF), International Boxing Association (IBA), National Boxing Association (NBA).\nNote:\nList of men's quintuple champions.\nThe following is a list of quintuple champions who have held titles from one or more of the \"Big Four\" organizations (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) and \"The Ring.\"\nList of women's quintuple champion.\nThe following is a list of women’s quintuple champions who have held titles from one or more of the \"Big Four\" organizations (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) and The Ring.\nQuintuple champions that won titles in other multiple divisions.\nSome fighters of this group or club were not satisfied to win just the incredible milestone of championships in five different weight divisions but to reach immortality in six and/or seven other different divisions or categories.

        "text": "International cricket teams raised by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) have visited Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon, on 23 occasions from 1911-12 until the most recent tour in the winter of 2000-01. Eleven of the teams were England national cricket teams raised by MCC during the period when it held responsibility for Test cricket played by England. The other twelve were MCC teams \"per se\" which did not take part in Test cricket.\nBy 1911, there had been four English teams in Ceylon. Those were led by Ivo Bligh in 1882-83; George Vernon in 1889-90; Lord Hawke in 1892-93; and Andrew Stoddart in 1894-95. The Bligh and Stoddart teams were \"en route\" to Australia while the Vernon and Hawke ventures took in Ceylon as part of visits to India. In 1911-12, there was the first visit by an England Test team organised by MCC. Again, it was a case of using Colombo as a stopover \"en route\" to Australia. This team was led by Pelham Warner and played a match against a Ceylon XI which at that time was not a first-class team. After the First World War, the next team to stop in Ceylon was the 1920–21 England team, again \"en route\" to Australia and played the Ceylon XI in a match that was still not first-class.\nIn 1922–23, the first MCC team which was not a Test side visited Ceylon \"en route\" to Australia and New Zealand. Captained by Archie MacLaren, it played one second-class match in Colombo against the Ceylon XI. The 1924–25 England team, organised by MCC, played in Colombo in October 1924, in a drawn second-class match against the Ceylon XI.\nThe earliest match played in Ceylon that now has first-class status took place in February 1926 between a Ceylon XI and a visiting Bombay XI, which included future Indian Test player C. K. Nayudu. Next season, the first MCC team to play first-class matches in Ceylon was the 1926-27 side led by Arthur Gilligan. This team was essentially bound for India but in January and February 1927 it played four first-class matches in Ceylon against the Europeans XI, the Ceylonese XI, an Up-Country XI and the Ceylon national team.\nMCC-organised England teams tended to play single day games until the 1933–34 team to India concluded its tour with four matches in Ceylon, two of them first-class. In February 1962, Ted Dexter's team returning from their tour of India and Pakistan played Ceylon at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo in a three-day match. MCC won by 8 wickets. However, the MCC England teams in 1962–63 and 1965–66 played only minor matches when stopping over on their voyages to Australia. The 1965–66 team to Australia was the last to travel there by sea and so the Colombo stopovers ended.\nIn January 1969, the MCC England team visiting Pakistan came to Colombo and played Ceylon in a drawn match. By this time, the standard of cricket in the island had improved considerably and the national team was well on the way towards gaining Test status.\nAfter Ceylon became Sri Lanka and MCC stopped organising England tours, the club has only rarely visited the island. There was something of a reunion spirit in 2000–01 when an MCC team arrived for the first time since 1977, but it played no first-class matches."

        "title": "Otis Taylor (American football)",
        "text": "Otis Taylor (August 11, 1942 – March 9, 2023) was an American professional football wide receiver who played in the American Football League (AFL). He played college football for the Prairie View A&amp;M Panthers and was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fourth round (29th overall) of the 1965 AFL Draft. He was also selected in the 15th round (203rd overall) of the 1965 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles, but he chose to play in the AFL for the Chiefs where he would spend his entire career.\nProfessional career.\nTaylor was selected in the 1965 AFL draft (Chiefs) and the NFL draft, by the Philadelphia Eagles. After a famous \"baby-sitting\" incident, in which Taylor \"escaped\" from NFL scouts, he was signed for the Chiefs by their legendary scout Lloyd Wells.\nTaylor caught five touchdown passes during his rookie year, and followed that up in 1966 by leading the AFL with a 22.4 yd/catch average and finishing second in receiving yards (1,297). At season's end, he was voted First-team All-AFL and was selected for the 1966 AFL All-Star team. Taylor led the AFL in receiving touchdowns in 1967 with 11 and led the NFL in receiving yards in 1971 with 1,110. He made the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl twice and in 1971 was named Consensus All-Pro by the Associated Press (AP), the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA) and Pro Football Weekly. The PFWA also named him First-team All-Pro for the 1972 season. Taylor ranks in the Chiefs' all-time list in receptions (6th, 410), receiving yards (3rd, 7,306), receiving touchdowns (3rd, 57), and 100-yard games (20).\nTaylor combined with running back Robert Holmes for what was at the time the longest reception in Chiefs history in 1969 when he caught a pass from quarterback Mike Livingston for 79 yards, then lateraled to Holmes, who carried it another 14 yards for a touchdown. However, Taylor's most memorable highlight from that season came in the fourth and final AFL-NFL World Championship Game on January 11, 1970. After the Vikings made it a 16–7 game, Taylor caught a quick pass from Len Dawson, escaped a tackle attempt by Earsell Mackbee and ran down the sidelines for a 46-yard touchdown to close out the scoring with 82 seconds remaining in the third quarter. The Chiefs won a 23–7 upset over the NFL champion Minnesota Vikings which, prior to Super Bowl IV, had been dubbed by some as \"the greatest team in pro football history\".\n\"Otis made my job easy,\" Chiefs quarterback and Hall of Famer Len Dawson said. \"If you got the pass to Otis, you knew he'd catch it.\"\nThe Professional Football Researchers Association named Taylor to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2006.\nBen Davidson incident.\nOn November 1, 1970, the Chiefs led the Oakland Raiders 17–14 late in the fourth quarter, and a long run for a first-down run by Dawson apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson, as he lay on the ground, was speared by Raiders' defensive end Ben Davidson, who dove into Dawson with his helmet, provoking Taylor to attack Davidson.\nAfter a bench-clearing brawl, offsetting penalties were called, nullifying the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a George Blanda field goal with eight seconds to play. Davidson's hit against Dawson not only cost the Chiefs a win, but helped Oakland win the AFC West with a season record of 8–4–2, while defending world champion Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the playoffs. The very next season, the rule for offsetting personal foul penalties was changed to separate penalties during the play, and penalties after the play. The rule change was largely due to this play.\nJack Del Rio incident.\nAfter his time as a player had come to a close, Taylor became a scout for the Kansas City Chiefs. During the 1987 NFL Player's strike, Taylor was arriving at Arrowhead Stadium and was assaulted by Jack Del Rio, who was a new player to the organization in 1987 and was striking with his teammates. Del Rio mistook Taylor for a replacement player and was told Taylor was actually a Chiefs legend and retired player by fans who had come upon the assault. He later pressed charges against Del Rio and the two settled out of court.\nPersonal life.\nTaylor and his wife, Regina, had a son.\nHealth and death.\nIn 1969, Taylor began experiencing seizures. In 1990, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease dementia, which eroded his health over the following decades, until he was bedbound and largely incommunicative in his last years. His family filed a lawsuit against the NFL in 2012, believing that his medical conditions were caused by injuries he received during his playing career. He died on March 9, 2023, at the age of 80."

Favre was Smith's quarterback the first two seasons of his college career.\nNFL career.\nSmith was chosen in the first round (19th overall) in the 1992 NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons. Legend has it that Atlanta acquired this pick from Green Bay in exchange for Brett Favre, but Favre was actually traded for the 17th pick in the 1992 draft. Atlanta later traded this pick to the Dallas Cowboys. Atlanta received the 19th pick in the draft, which they used to draft Smith.\n Falcons Head Coach Jerry Glanville wanted the team to draft a defensive back and was unhappy with the choice of a running back.\nSmith got to his first training camp late, after a five-day holdout. He signed a $2.5 million contract, which was the richest in team history at the time. During his rookie season, he led the team with 87 carries and began returning kicks and punts.\nBut by his second year, still not in the favor of Glanville, Smith never played an offensive snap. The same thing happened the following season and Smith found himself a free agent after the 1994 season.\nSmith signed with the expansion Carolina Panthers, but broke his tibia and fibula in a preseason game against the Chicago Bears. He was placed on injured reserve and released the following offseason when his leg hadn't fully healed.\nSmith spent a season in the Canadian Football League with the Toronto Argonauts as an attempt to revive his NFL career. He was signed the following offseason with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1999, but Smith's career was officially over after he \"popped\" his hamstring and the Eagles released him on May 4, 1999,\nIn a 2016 interview, Smith claimed to be at peace with his NFL career being labeled a \"bust.\" \"I didn't go into the game to be a bust on purpose,\" Smith said. \"Sometimes, things just work out that way, you know.

He played professional baseball for nine years from 1921 to 1929, including two seasons in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers in 1922 and 1923. He compiled an 8–7 win–loss record and a 4.95 earned run average (ERA) in 54 major league games. He also played seven years in the minor leagues and played college baseball at Cornell University.\nEarly years.\nOlsen was born in South Norwalk, Connecticut, in 1894. He graduated from Norwalk High School in 1913 and then attended Cornell University where he played for the Cornell Big Red baseball team. His college career was interrupted by military service during World War I. After being discharged from the military, he returned to Cornell and served as the captain of Cornell's baseball team in 1919.\nProfessional baseball.\nOlsen debuted with the Tigers in 1922, appearing in 37 games — 15 as a starter and 22 as a reliever.

Olsen recalled that, when Babe stepped to the plate, he tried to rattle the rookie pitcher by calling him an SOB and telling him to \"throw the ball and duck.\" Olsen responded by calling Babe \"a big baboon\" and striking him out. An account in \"The New York Times\" confirms that Olsen struck out Ruth with two men on base in the bottom of the fifth inning and with the Tigers leading, 4-2.\nOlsen also pitched for seven years in the minor leagues, including stints with the Syracuse Stars of the International League in 1921 and 1926, the Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association in 1924, the Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association in 1924 and 1925, the Kansas City Blues of the American Association from 1925 to 1927, and the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association in 1928 and 1929.

        "text": "The 1976 Giro d'Italia was the 59th running of the Giro, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It started in Catania, on 21 May, with a set of split stages and concluded in Milan, on 12 June, with another split stage, consisting of an individual time trial and a mass-start stage. A total of 120 riders from twelve teams entered the 22-stage race, that was won by Italian Felice Gimondi of the Bianchi-Campagnolo team. The second and third places were taken by Belgian Johan De Muynck and Italian Fausto Bertoglio, respectively.\nAmongst the other classifications that the race awarded, Sanson's Francesco Moser won the points classification, Andrés Oliva of KAS won the mountains classification, and Magniflex's Alfio Vandi completed the Giro as the best neo-professional in the general classification, finishing seventh overall. Brooklyn finishing as the winners of the team points classification. The race was marred by the death of Spanish rider Juan Manuel Santisteban during the first stage.\nTeams.\nA total of twelve teams were invited to participate in the 1976 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 120 cyclists. From the riders that began this edition, 86 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the race was revealed on 30 January 1976, while a final draft of the race was released on 13 April 1976.\nRace overview.\nDuring the stage 1A on 21 May, Juan Manuel Santisteban crashed and hit his head, ultimately dying from his injuries. The Giro organisation allowed his team to let another rider take his place, but the team had no rider available so this was not done.\nPatrick Sercu would win both stage 1A and 1B, Roger de Vlaeminck would win stage 2 and the two of them would alternate between wearing the leader's jersey depending on the tie-breakers following the first few stages. De Muynck took over the lead after winning stage 6 by 0:21 over the main field following a crash which left him alone at the front as a group of eight riders were now tied for 2nd in the overall standings :05 behind. The time trial in Stage 7 was won by Francesco Moser with Gimondi placing 2nd seven seconds behind putting Moser into the Maglia Rosa as the overall leader and Gimondi in 2nd seven seconds behind Stage 8 was won by de Vlaeminck as Eddy Merckx crossed the line in 2nd which would be his highest stage placing in this final Giro of his remarkable career. Gimondi crossed in 3rd and while he was by no means a favorite for overall victory, because Moser lost nearly a minute Gimondi would wear the Pink Jersey for the first time since the 1969 Giro.\nOver the next ten stages Gimondi maintained his overall lead but on stage 19 Johan de Muynck was able to get away from him and he took over the lead by 0:16. Stage 21 was the final day in the mountains where Merckx took 2nd and Gimondi won the stage. De Muynck finished 9th, but finished in the same time so the overall situation remained the same. Stage 22a was the final ITT and it was here that Gimondi won the Giro. He finished in 6th place 0:43 behind stage winner Joseph Bruyere but 0:44 ahead of de Muynck effectively making him the winner by 0:19.\nClassification leadership.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 1976 Giro d'Italia, as well as a team competition. Four of them awarded jerseys to their leaders. The general classification was the most important and was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Giro. The rider leading the classification wore a pink jersey to signify the classification's leadership.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the top positions in a stage finish, with first place getting the most points, and lower placings getting successively fewer points. The rider leading this classification wore a purple (or cyclamen) jersey. The mountains classification was the third classification and its leader was denoted by the green jersey. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. Most stages of the race included one or more categorized climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Sella Pass, which was crossed first by Spanish rider Andrés Gandarias during stage 19. The fourth classification, the young rider classification, was a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but only considered neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). \nThe final classification, the team classification, awarded no jersey to its leaders. This was calculated by adding together points earned by each rider on the team during each stage through the intermediate sprints, the categorized climbs, stage finishes, etc. The team with the most points led the classification.\nThere were other minor classifications within the race, including the Campionato delle Regioni classification. The leader wore a blue jersey with colored vertical stripes (\"maglia azzurra con banda tricolore verticale\"). New to the race for the 1976 edition was the Fiat 131 classification, which was created in honour of Santisteban, who died during stage 1a. In all stages longer than , there would be a banner at that point in the stage to designate a special sprint. The winner of the sprint in each stage received a Fiat 131."

        "text": "The 1987 Giro d'Italia was the 70th edition of the bicycle race. It began on 21 May with a prologue in San Remo, and concluded on 13 June with a individual time trial in Saint-Vincent. A total of 180 riders from 20 teams entered the 22-stage, -long race, which was won by Irishman Stephen Roche of the team. Second and third places were taken by British rider Robert Millar and Dutchman Erik Breukink, respectively. It was the second time in the history of the Giro that the podium was occupied solely by non-Italian riders. Roche's victory in the 1987 Giro was his first step in completing the Triple Crown of Cycling – winning the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France, and the World Championship road race in one calendar year – becoming the second rider ever to do so.\nRoche's teammate and defending champion Roberto Visentini took the first race leader's \"maglia rosa\" () after winning the opening prologue, only to lose it to Breukink the following stage. Roche took the overall lead after his team, Carrera Jeans–Vagabond, won the stage three team time trial. Visentini regained the lead for a two-day period after the stage 13 individual time trial. The fifteenth stage of the 1987 Giro has been recognized as an iconic event in the history of the race because Roche rode ahead of teammate Visentini, despite orders from the team management, and took the race lead. Roche successfully defended the overall lead from attacks by Visentini and other general classification contenders until the event's finish in Saint-Vincent.\nStephen Roche became the first Irishman to win the Giro d'Italia. In addition to the general classification, Roche also won the combination classification. In the other race classifications, Johan van der Velde of Gis Gelati–Jollyscarpe won the points classification, Robert Millar of took the mountains classification green jersey, and Selca–Conti's Roberto Conti completed the Giro as the best neo-professional in the general classification, finishing fifteenth overall. Panasonic–Isostar finished as the winners of the team classification, which ranks each of the twenty teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time.\nTeams.\nA total of 20 teams were invited to participate in the 1987 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 180 cyclists. The starting peloton featured riders from 17 different countries. Italy (91), the Netherlands (16), Spain (15), Belgium (13), Switzerland (10), and France (10) all had more than 10 or more riders.\nOf those starting, 74 were riding the Giro d'Italia for the first time. The average age of riders was 26.52 years, ranging from 21–year–old Andreas Kappes from to 38–year–old Hennie Kuiper of . The team with the youngest average rider age was Magniflex–Centroscarpa (23), while the oldest was (28). The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place on 20 May, outside the Casino of San Remo. From the riders that began this edition, 133 completed the race.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nReigning champion Roberto Visentini returned to the race in 1987 to defend his crown, despite not winning many races in his spring campaign. Francesco Moser, who won in 1984 and finished in the top three in 1985 and 1986, did not participate because of a head trauma and bruises sustained in a crash in the weeks prior to the race. Spanish sports newspaper \"El Mundo Deportivo\" and Gian Paolo Ormezzano from Italy's \"La Stampa\" named several other riders as contenders for the overall classification, such as Giuseppe Saronni, then-world champion Moreno Argentin, Stephen Roche, and Robert Millar. Since team leader Greg LeMond did not participate in the race due to injuries sustained in a , \"El Mundo Deportivo\" believed Jean-François Bernard to be a dark horse. \"L'Unità\" writer Gino Sala believed Roche, Saronni, and Visentini were the top three challengers for the overall crown.\nClimbers Gianbattista Baronchelli, Éric Caritoux, Franco Chioccioli, Marino Lejarreta, and Millar were expected to contend for mountains classification. Several writers felt Argentin, Guido Bontempi, Urs Freuler, Eddy Planckaert, and Paolo Rosola all had a great chance to win a stage in the race. Mario Fossati of \"La Repubblica\" also thought that Bernard, Bontempi, and Phil Anderson could take a stage win. Anderson returned to cycling at the Giro following a lengthy battle with a virus. Due to Rolf Sørensen's victory at the Tirreno–Adriatico he was seen as an outside contender, but there were questions over his ability to climb in the high mountains.\nThere was a strong belief that the race would be a battle between Carrera Jeans–Vagabond teammates Visentini and Roche. \"El Mundo Deportivo\" stated that Visentini had the edge in the time trial discipline and sprinting, while Roche had the advantage in climbing mountains. However, unlike Visentini, Roche came into the race in great shape after winning the Tour de Romandie and placing second in the Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the Critérium International. Cycling expert and author Bill McGann thought that the race would be disputed between Visentini and Baronchelli.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1987 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public on television by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani on 21 February 1987. Covering a total of , it included five time trials (four individual and one for teams), and thirteen stages with categorized climbs that awarded mountains classification points. The course featured a total of climbing, more than the previous edition. Five of these thirteen stages had summit finishes: stage 1a, to San Romolo; stage 6, to Monte Terminillo; stage 15, to Sappada; stage 19, to Madesimo; and stage 21, to Pila. Another stage with a mountain-top finish was stage 13, which consisted of a climbing time trial to San Marino. The organizers chose to include one rest day between stages 10 and 11. When compared to the previous Giro, the race had the same number of stages – although one stage consisted of two half-stages – but was longer and contained an additional individual time trial. The sixteenth stage, which ran from Sappada to Canazei, was named the queen stage for its five categorized climbs.\nRace director Torriani was happy with the success the 1985 Giro d'Italia had when passing through the Aosta Valley and chose to include this mountainous region, which lies adjacent to the Rhône-Alpes, in the 1987 route. With the Giro's return to the valley, \"La Stampa\" and the regional cycling federation director, Maggiorino Ferrero, speculated that the stages taking place in this region would be critical in deciding the general classification. Carlo Champvillair, a climbing champion of Aosta Valley, believed it to be a well-constructed, technical race route. The time trial in San Marino, the sixth stage with the finish atop Monte Terminillo, and the stages including the Dolomites were seen by \"L'Unità\" writer Gino Sala as stages that would heavily influence the general classification. In addition, he said that the route was suited to well-rounded, strong, and durable riders. The prologue contained a descent of the Poggio, a mountain used frequently in the Milan–San Remo, and was considered dangerous by some critics. However, Torriani decided to include the descent.\nRace overview.\nThe Giro began with a prologue through the streets of San Remo. The returning winner of the Giro, Roberto Visentini, won the prologue by two tenths of a second over the Canadian rider Steve Bauer. The next race day held two stages: a stage with a summit finish, followed by a downhill individual time trial. 's Erik Breukink took the climbing half-stage win with a solo attack. His performance earned him the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" (), which he kept until the third stage. Stephen Roche won the time trial half-stage with a three-second margin over Del Tongo's Lech Piasecki. Johan van der Velde formed a lead group with about to go in the second stage, but as he posed a threat to the race lead, he was not given a large advantage and was subsequently caught by the chasing peloton from the finish. The main field remained intact for the remaining kilometers and the race geared up for a sprint finish won by Moreno Argentin.\nThe third stage was a lengthy team time trial that stretched for between Lerici and Camaiore. beat out the Del Tongo squad by fifty-four seconds to win the leg. In addition to the stage victory, Carrera Jeans–Vagabond's Roche took the overall lead. As the leading group approached the fourth stage finish line, Argentin sprinted away with to go and created a two-second gap between himself and the rider in second place that was enough to earn him a second stage win. The fifth stage was relatively flat and was used to set up the race to enter the Apennine Mountains the following day. The leg culminated in a mass sprint that was won by Panasonic–Isostar's Belgian rider Eddy Planckaert, after overcoming Paolo Rosola in the closing meters.\nRoche defended his race lead until stage thirteen, a climbing individual time trial to Monte Titano in San Marino, where he lost the pink jersey to his teammate and stage winner Visentini. Roche claimed his performance in the stage was hampered due to injuries sustained from a crash in the tenth stage. At , the fourteenth stage was the longest of the race. It was won in a mass sprint by Remac Fanini's Paolo Cimini, who overtook Rosola in the final meters.\nThe fifteenth stage saw the race enter the Dolomites and traverse three major climbs within the mountain chain. On the descent of the Monte Rest, Roche formed a leading group with two other riders after speeding away from the race leader's group. Despite orders from his team management, Roche continued with the move. The Carrera Jeans-Vagabond pack chased after the Roche group to protect the advantage of Roche's teammate and race leader Visentini. Roche crossed the finish line in twelfth place, fifty-six seconds after the stage winner van der Velde, which allowed him to don again the pink jersey by five seconds over Tony Rominger. Roche's actions, taking the race lead away from Visentini and disobeying team commands, gained him the hatred of the Italian cycling fans.\nThe sixteenth leg of the race included five categorized climbs before concluding in the municipality of Canazei. On the descent of the Pordoi Pass, van der Velde broke away and caught up to the leader on the road before winning his second consecutive stage. Meanwhile, behind van der Velde, Visentini tried several times to attack Roche on the slopes of the Passo Fedaia; however, Roche marked all of his moves and the two raced to the finish in the same group. Stage 17, the race's final day in the Dolomites, was marred by poor weather. A breakaway group of three was given a significant gap as the main general classification contenders rode behind in a collective group. Atala Ofmega's Italian rider Marco Vitali out-sprinted his two fellow breakaway members to win his first Grand Tour stage win.\nAs the eighteenth stage began, the peloton felt they deserved a rest day after three difficult stages in the Dolomites and collectively rode at a non-aggressive pace for over three-quarters of the stage. Riders began to attack and form breakaway groups with about to go; however, the sprinters' teams reeled in all attacks and prepared for a sprint finish that was eventually won by Giuseppe Calcaterra, making it the second consecutive stage win for Atala-Ofmega. During the nineteenth stage, Jean-François Bernard launched an attack after the leading group finished the climb of the San Marco Pass. Three riders joined Bernard before the start of the final climb in Madesimo, but Bernard dropped them early on in the climb and rode the final alone to win the stage. Millar and Lejarreta managed to gain over thirty seconds on Roche after they attacked on the final climb. Despite a crash within the final kilometer of stage twenty, the main field managed to hold a bunch sprint that was won by Rosola.\nIn the twenty-first leg, the general classification contenders were a part of the same leading group until the final climb to the summit finish in Pila. Lejarreta attacked from the finish and only seven other riders were able to mark, including Millar and Roche. Over later, the Spaniard attacked again and only Roche and Millar remained with him. Despite further attacks by Lejarreta, the group rode together up to the finish. With over to go, Millar unleashed a sprint that won him the stage. Millar's performance on the stay brought him to second place overall. The final stage of the 1987 Giro d'Italia was a individual time trial. Visentini, who had crashed in the previous stage, did not start and abandoned the race. Roche beat out the second-place finisher, Dietrich Thurau, by fourteen seconds to win the day and the overall race itself. In doing so, Roche became the first Irishman to win the Giro d'Italia. The other podium positions were filled by non-Italian riders for the second time in the history of the race.\nFour riders achieved multiple stage victories: Argentin (stages 2, 4, and 7), Rosola (stages 8, 10, and 20), Visentini (prologue and stage 13), and Roche (stages 1b and 22). Stage wins were achieved by seven of the twenty competing squads, five of which won multiple stages. Gewiss-Bianchi collected a total of six stage wins through two riders, Argentin and Rosola. Carrera Jeans-Vagabond achieved the same feat with individual stage wins from Bontempi (stage 12), Roche and Visentini (two wins each), and a team time trial win (stage 3). Panasonic–Isostar amassed a total of three stage victories through Breukink (stage 1a), Planckaert (stage 5), and Millar (stage 21). Atala-Ofmega also secured three stage wins, through Freuler (stage 9), Vitali (stage 17), and Calcaterra (stage 18). Gis Gelati–Jollyscarpe won two stages with van der Velde (stages 15 and 16). Fagor–MBK also collected two stage successes, with Jean-Claude Bagot (stage 6) and Robert Forest (stage 11). Remac–Fanini and Toshiba–Look both won a single stage at the Giro, the first through Cimini (stage 14), and the second through Bernard (stage 19).\nClassification leadership.\nFour different jerseys were worn during the 1987 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. The time bonuses for the 1987 Giro were twenty seconds for the first place, fifteen seconds for the second place, ten seconds for the third place, and five seconds for the fourth place on the stage. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered to be the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this edition of the Giro was the Passo Pordoi, and the first rider to cross it was Fagor–MBK's Jean-Claude Bagot. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nAftermath.\nUpon completing the final stage, Roche told the media that by winning the final time trial he felt he silenced any critics who doubted whether he should have won the race. In addition, Roche announced his intention to compete in the Tour de France in July. He won the Tour with a margin of forty seconds over the second-place finisher and thus became the fifth rider to win the Giro and Tour in the same year. In September, Roche won the men's road race at the 1987 UCI Road World Championships and became the second rider to achieve the Triple Crown of Cycling, which consists of winning two Grand Tour races and the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships in a calendar year. For his career successes in the Giro d'Italia, Roche was inducted into the race's Hall of Fame in 2014. After dropping out of the 1987 edition of the Giro, Visentini did not win any further stages or classifications in major races, and retired from cycling in 1990, at the age of 33.\n\"La Repubblica\" stated that the Italian riders had the second worst performance in the history of the Giro after 1972, since none finished inside the top four and many famous Italian cyclists failed to complete the race. Mario Fossati, of \"La Repubblica\", thought that van der Velde and Bernard performed very strongly, along with Argentin, who he said was operating on \"alternating current\". Fossati also said that Cimini and Calcaterra could have promising careers, based on their efforts during the race.\nThe 1987 Giro has become famous for the series of events involving teammates Roche and Visentini. Many writers highlight the fifteenth stage as the defining moment of the race. The \"Corriere delle Alpi\" and cycling book author Bill McGann even named it as one of the most famous in the Giro d'Italia and cycling history. On that day, Roche – who was second in the general classification and over two minutes behind race leader Visentini – attacked the lead, despite orders from his team to stop. Upon completing the stage, Visentini told the press that either Roche or himself would not start the following day, while Roche independently held a press conference from his hotel and answered questions. Carrera Jeans-Vagabond manager David Boifava ordered Roche and Visentini to stay silent. The following day, many Italian newspapers called Roche a betrayer or cheat for his actions. Despite Visentini's statement, both riders started the sixteenth stage after receiving orders from Carrera company boss Tito Tachella. In the days that followed, Italian fans threw things and spat at Roche, which led him to receive police protection until the race's conclusion. Looking back on the incident, Roche claimed that he just descended the mountain quicker than Visentini and did nothing wrong, while Visentini maintained that Roche attacked him when he should have been aiding him. Visentini accused Roche of dashing the team's morale and strategy, but some critics believed that Roche's actions were acceptable because he was the stronger rider."

        "text": "The 1978 Giro d'Italia was the 61st running of the Giro, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It started in Saint-Vincent, on 7 May, with a prologue and concluded in Milan, on 28 May, with a mass-start stage. A total of 130 riders from thirteen teams entered the 20-stage race, that was won by Belgian Johan de Muynck of the Bianchi team. The second and third places were taken by Italians Gianbattista Baronchelli and Francesco Moser, respectively. As of the beginning of the 2021 cycling season this was the last time a Belgian rider won a Grand Tour.\nAmongst the other classifications that the race awarded, Sanson's Moser won the points classification, Ueli Sutter of Zonca won the mountains classification, and Vibor's Roberto Visentini completed the Giro as the best neo-professional in the general classification, finishing fifteenth overall. Bianchi finishing as the winners of the team points classification.\nTeams.\nA total of 13 teams were invited to participate in the 1978 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 130 cyclists. Out of the 130 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 90 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the race was revealed on 8 March 1978. The start of the race was moved up one week and three stage were cancelled so the race did not interfere with the World Cup that started on 1 June in Argentina. The fourteenth stage took the race into the Venice for a time trial. As the city was not conducive to the event, four ramps were created to allow for riders to ride up and down on canal crossings, as well as one floating bridge over the Grand Canal.\nClassification leadership.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 1978 Giro d'Italia, as well as a team competition. Four of them awarded jerseys to their leaders. The general classification was the most important and was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Giro. The rider leading the classification wore a pink jersey to signify the classification's leadership.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the top positions in a stage finish, with first place getting the most points, and lower placings getting successively fewer points. The rider leading this classification wore a purple (or cyclamen) jersey. The mountains classification was the third classification and its leader was denoted by the green jersey. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. Most stages of the race included one or more categorized climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Passo Valles, which was first summitted by Italian rider Gianbattista Baronchelli. The fourth classification, the young rider classification, was decided the same way as the general classification, but exclusive to neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). The leader of the classification wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification, the team classification, awarded no jersey to its leaders. This was calculated by adding together points earned by each rider on the team during each stage through the intermediate sprints, the categorized climbs, stage finishes, etc. The team with the most points led the classification.\nThere were other minor classifications within the race, including the Campionato delle Regioni classification. The leader wore a blue jersey with colored vertical stripes (\"maglia azzurra con banda tricolore verticale\"). The Fiat Ritmo classification, which was created in honor Juan Manuel Santisteban who died in stage 1A of 1976 edition.

He started his professional baseball career in 1877, playing for the Rhode Islands of the New England League. The following season, he played in the International Association.\nIn 1879, Evans joined the National League's Troy Trojans, making his major league debut on May 1. He played 72 games that season and hit .232 with 17 runs batted in. Evans never had an OPS+ total above 98 in the majors, but he was a good outfielder with a strong throwing arm. Among outfielders, he finished among the league leaders in several defensive categories as a rookie; he was second in assists (30), second in range factor (2.54), third in putouts (153), and fifth in fielding percentage (.884).\nIn 1880 and 1881, Evans batted .256 and .241, respectively. He then played for the Worcester Ruby Legs in 1882. His batting average dropped to a career-low .213, but he led all National League outfielders in assists with 31. He moved on to the Cleveland Blues in 1883, where he was praised for his fielding. (\"Give Jake Evans plenty of pie, a comfortable siesta and his favorite dhundeen [cigar] and he'll play right second to none.\")\nIn 1884, Evans' right arm popped out of its socket as he was throwing the ball in from right field, leaving his arm in a \"fragile condition.\" Evans played the rest of the year wearing a fitted rubber cap on his arm to keep it from popping back out, and he batted a career-high .259 while leading the National League's outfielders in fielding percentage (.917). However, that was his last full season in professional baseball.\nEvans played 20 games for the Baltimore Orioles in 1885 before retiring from the game at the age of 28. He died in Baltimore in 1907 and was buried in Baltimore Cemetery."

        "title": "Australian Services cricket team",
        "text": "The Australian Services XI was a cricket team comprising solely military service personnel during World War II. They became active in May 1945 after the defeat of Nazi Germany. The team played matches against English cricket sides of both military and civilian origins to celebrate the end of the war. These matches were aimed at increasing morale in the war-ravaged English cities and as a means of reviving cricket after the conclusion of fighting.\nThe end of the war marked the start of the 1945 cricket season. Plum Warner organised a series of matches between England and Australian servicemen, known as the Victory Tests, to celebrate the end of hostilities. However, Australian cricket administrators would not accredit the three-day matches as official Test matches, arguing that there were not enough Test-level players in the armed services; Lindsay Hassett was the only Australian who had Test experience.\nThe side was composed of an amalgam of a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) team, which had already been stationed in England during the war, and another group of mostly Australian Imperial Force (AIF) soldiers from Australia. The players were deliberately stationed with each other in England for the express purpose of forming a cricket team to tour the country, with Australian prime minister John Curtin pushing for the immediate resumption of international cricket after the war was over. The team was officially a military unit, led by Squadron Leader Stan Sismey, the team's wicket-keeper.\nEngland were close to full strength, so the AIF and the RAAF teams merged to strengthen their quality. As a result, the Australian Services cricket team was formed under the leadership of Warrant Officer Lindsay Hassett to compete in the Victory Tests.\nThe Australian team, despite being split by rank and service, all took their place in the side in good spirit and not much was made of the fact that Hassett, a warrant officer who was outranked by almost every other member of the team, was appointed captain.\nThe Victory Tests were greeted by packed English grounds, and raised a lot of money for war charities. Against expectations, the Australians managed to draw the series 2–2 against an England team filled with Test cricketers. As a result, the Australian government, cricket administrators and military officials ordered the team to travel home via India to play more fundraising matches, before finishing their campaign against the Australian state teams. By the time the team arrived in Australia they were extremely tired and their performances deteriorated, leading analysts who had not seen them in England to regard them as a weak team.\nPersonnel.\nThe following cricketers played in at least one match.\nThe manager was Flight Lieutenant Keith Johnson from New South Wales.\nOnly one player in the side, future Test captain Lindsay Hassett had Test match experience. Keith Miller, Bob Cristofani, Cec Pepper, Keith Carmody, Ross Stanford, Albert Cheetham, Stan Sismey, Dick Whitington, and Graham Williams were the players who had previous first-class experience. The spinner Reg Ellis and opening batsman Jack Pettiford had not prior experience at first-class level, but played for their states in Australia after making their debut for the Services. Charles Price and Jim Workman made their debut during the Australian Services campaign and never played first-class cricket afterwards.\nKeith Miller, one of the ten inaugural inductees of the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame at the time only a batsman with Victoria, played what many consider to be his breakout series in the Victory Tests, ensuring that when he returned to Australia he would have a place in the Australian national team now referred to as \"The Invincibles\".\nIn the batting department, Miller was the top-scorer; he scored 1,447 runs in 20 matches at an average of 49.89. Hassett scored 1,434 runs at 49.44 in 18 matches and top-scored for the whole campaign with 187. Opening batsman Whitington was the only other member of the team to score more than 1,000 runs. He totalled 1,054 runs at 35.13.\nOn the bowling front, Australia was heavily dependent on its spin attack. The left arm orthodox spinner Ellis took 72 wickets at 25.02, while the leg spinner Pepper took 71 wickets at 32.47. The third highest wicket-taker was Cristofani, also a leg spinner; he took 34 wickets at 30.73. Miller was the leading paceman, taking 29 wickets at 28.96.\nFor all rounders, Pepper also scored 987 runs at 36.55, while Cristofani added 558 runs at 27.90. Pettiford scored 768 runs at 38.40 and took 22 wickets at 41.86 with his leg spin.\nGraham Williams, the team's main strike bowler, had only been released from a German prisoner of war camp weeks before the series started, and played at 31 kg (68 lb) below his pre-war playing weight. In between overs he drank glasses of glucose and water to keep his energy up, but when he was unable to bowl Miller took his place and demonstrated what a valuable pace bowler he would become in the future himself.\nOmissions.\nSome players with prior first-class experience could not be considered for selection because they could not be released from the units in which they were serving, particularly those serving in the Pacific. These included Arthur Morris, Ian Johnson and Ray Lindwall. Lindwall and Johnson went on to make their debuts for Australia in 1946 in the first post-war Test, while Morris made his debut in 1946–47 against England. All three became long-serving Australian Test players, and all three captained their country, Johnson for two years. Bill Brown had played regularly for Australia's Test team before the war, but was not available, nor was Colin McCool, who had made his first-class debut before the outbreak of war.\nChronology.\nIn England.\nThe Australians and their schedule was administered by Keith Johnson, a member of the Australian Board of Control and the New South Wales Cricket Association. During World War II, Johnson served in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the rose to the rank of Flight Lieutenant and was deployed to London, where he did public relations work at the RAAF's overseas headquarters. Officially a military unit, the team's commanding officer was Squadron Leader Stan Sismey of the RAAF, although the on-field captain was Warrant Officer Lindsay Hassett of the Second Australian Imperial Force.\nWisden Cricketers' Almanack praised the organisational work done by Johnson in arranging the services' programme in England: \"A stranger to this country, he found the programme in only skeleton form; and that the tour proved such a success from every point of view was due to his hard work and courtesy.\" The almanack reprinted in full Johnson's \"message\" of thanks to English cricket before the team sailed to India.\nThe First Victory Test started at Lord's on 19 May and was expected to usher in a new post-war era, which it hoped would be more aggressive and attractive. The last Anglo-Australian Test series before the war had featured a large number of draws due to defensive play. England won the toss and batted first. They batted steadily although none of their specialist batsmen managed to pass 57 and reached 4/205, before Miller came on as the fifth bowler and bowled his Great Massingham pilot colleague Bill Edrich for 45, precipitating an English collapse from 4/200 to 267. Paceman Albert Cheetham took 3/49, while new ball partner Williams, spinner Reginald Ellis and Charles Price took two wickets each.\nIn reply to England's 267 from 100.1 overs, Australia reached 2/82 by stumps on the opening day, with Hassett and Sismey at the crease. The next day, Sismey fell for 37, and Miller came to the crease at 3/136 and joined Hassett. Miller gradually progressed, undeterred by the fall of Hassett for 77 at 4/171. He put on 99 with Ross Stanford, who fell for 49 soon after Australia passed England's total, with the score at 5/270. \nOnce Australia had taken the lead, Miller cut loose. After spending 40 minutes in the 90s, he finished with 105 in 210 minutes, with a straight six. \"The Times\" opined that his innings was \"as good a century as has been seen at Lord's in many a long day\". \"Wisden\" said that he \"was always getting runs with the soundness characteristic of most Australians\". Harry Altham declared that \"a brilliant new star had joined the cluster of the Southern Cross\". Miller put on 87 for the sixth wicket with Pepper, and although both feel in quick succession in a collapse of 3/9, Price and Williams put on a ninth-wicket stand of 88 to take the Australian total to 455, giving them a 188-run lead, and the end of the innings marked the end of the second day's play.\nOn the final morning, England batted steadily and their Test openers Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook took the score to 52 before leg spinner Cec Pepper removed both. Jack Robertson top-scored with 84 and his Middlesex teammate Edrich scored 50 as England moved to 5/286 late in the day, an overall lead of 98. It appeared that England would be able to hold on for a draw, but they lost their last five wickets for eight runs to be all out for 294. Pepper took 4/80 and Ellis and Price two wickets each.\nThis left Australia with a target of 107. Miller and Richard Whitington were both out with only 11 runs on the board, but Hassett and Pepper put on 52 runs quickly and Australia reached their second innings target with two balls to spare. Pepper was unbeaten on 54.\nThe last pre-war series between England and Australia in 1938 had been an attritional and hard-nosed contest, but in the afterglow of war victory, the cricketers played flamboyantly with abandon in front of a packed stadium. The attractive style of cricket was widely praised by commentators and the match raised £1,935 for war relief charities.\nThe First Victory Test was followed by a month in which the Australian Services were not active as a team; the various players represented their respective RAAF teams during this time.\nThe Second Victory Test was played at Bramall Lane in Sheffield and started on 23 June, where the grandstands were damaged by German air raids. Hassett sent the Englishmen into bat, and the hosts' innings was highlighted by their captain Wally Hammond, who scored exactly 100, supported by Washbrook, who scored 63. However, Hammond's dismissal was part of a collapse that saw the home side lose their last five wickets for 38 runs. Cheetham and Pepper took three wickets each, and Ellis and Williams both captured a brace. Australia moved to be 0/23 at stumps on the first day, but lost wickets steadily on the second morning, and were all out for 147; Keith Carmody scored 42, the only contribution beyond 21 by a batsman, while George Pope took 5/58.\nIn the second innings, England went about extending their lead and Miller bowled a fast and hostile spell, hitting Test world record holder Hutton in the arm before hitting Washbrook in the head, provoking an angry crowd reaction, comparing Miller to the \"Bodyline\" spearhead Harold Larwood. He later removed Washbrook and ended with 2/28. His efforts led to calls for him to start taking his bowling seriously, instead of simply jogging in releasing the ball, especially from former South African representative Bob Crisp. Miller's spell helped reduce the hosts to 7/122, a lead of only 261, but a rearguard fightback pushed the total to 190, leaving the Australians with a target of 330. England were bowled out at the end of the second day, so the Australians had a full day's batting to reach their target.\nThe Australians started well, with their openers, Whitington and Jim Workman posting a century opening stand. However, both fell in quick succession for 61 and 63 respectively to leave the score at 2/121. Miller and Hassett took the score to 2/171 before Miller fell for eight. From then on, wickets fell steadily and Australia fell 41 runs short of the target and series was squared. For England, Dick Pollard took 5/76.\nThe Services then drew three non-first-class matches against Oxford &amp; District, HDG Leveson-Gower's XI and Yorkshire; the first two of these were one-day single innings fixtures while in the third Australia had a lead of 48 and reached 1/27 in their second innings when time ran out.\nIn the Third Victory Test at Lord's, Hammond won the toss and elected to bat. Despite his efforts in the previous Victory Test, Miller was only Hassett's fifth-choice bowler. When finally called upon, he measured out a run up. Miller struck John Dewes before uprooting his off stump. However, Hutton, on his way to a century, was holding up his end. Eventually, Miller bowled Donald Carr for four and then removed Hutton's off stump. He ended with 3/44 from 18 overs. These two wickets helped to precipitate a collapse of 7/92 as England fell from 3/162 to 254 all out on the first day. Bob Cristofani helped clean up the tail, taking 4/43.\nAustralia started their innings at the beginning of the second day. Their top-order failed and fell to 5/72, and it was up to Hassett (68), Carmody and Cristofani (32 each) to push the total to 194. Pollard took 6/75.\nMiller took the new ball in the second innings after his performances in the first innings. He bowled Dewes for a duck with an outswinger, before bowling Edrich for 58. Nevertheless, England were in a strong position at stumps on the second day at 3/118, an overall lead of 178, with Hutton unbeaten on 49. However, the home team collapsed on the final morning to be all out for 164, with Cristofani taking 5/49 and Miller taking 3/42. This left Australia a target of 225 in five hours. Sismey (52) and Workman (30) laid the foundation for the run chase with a second wicket partnership of 82. Miller came into bat at 3/104 and saw Australia to the target unbeaten on 71 with four wickets in hand. C B Fry opined that Miller's innings was \"superbly stroked and directed cover driving of the pace bowling formed the most telling and majestic feature\".\nDuring the Sunday rest day of the Third Victory Test, which came after the first day's play, the Australians beat Gravesend Sunday Club in a single inningsgame.\nAfter the Third Test the Australians played in a non-first-class match against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane. The hosts scored 243 in reply to the Australians' 232; Hassett's men were 5/162 when time ran out. They then drew with Sussex in and lost by 74 runs to the Metropolitan Police in single-innings one-day matches. They were narrowly denied a victory in the next match, against the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy were 7/139 in their second innings, with a lead of only 12, when time ran out.\nIn the Fourth Victory Test, again at Lord's, Hassett won the toss and elected to bat. Whitington scored 46 and Sismey 59. Miller came in at 3/108 and after a slow start, scored another century, taking 170 minutes to reach the mark. At the end of the first day, Australia were 5/273 with Miller and Pepper at the crease. Miller was removed for 118 the next day. He struck ten fours, all off which were driven. Pepper continued and made 57 to help Australia reach 388. Pope and Pollard took four wickets each.\nEngland's batsmen replied productively; Laurie Fishlock scored 69, Hammond 83, Edrich 73 and Washbrook 112. They reached 3/249 by stumps on the second day and declared at 7/468.\nIn the second innings, Miller came to the crease with Australia at 3/54 and still in arrears. He scored an unbeaten 35 to ensure that Australia would not collapse further and lose the match. The public reception towards the Victory Tests resulted in an additional fifth match being added to the schedule. A record attendance of 93,000 witnessed the Fourth Test at Lord's.\nIn the lead-up to the Fifth Victory Test, the Australians lost a single innings game against Northamptonshire and suffered a defeat by an innings and 89 runs North of England cricket team in a two-day match at Blackpool.\nIn the final Fifth Victory Test at Old Trafford, Australia won the toss and batted first. They collapsed to 4/66 under overcast conditions on a green pitch when Miller came to the crease. Against a swinging and seaming ball, Miller struck 14 from the first over that he faced and went on to finish 77 not out in a display that featured strong cutting and driving. However, he did not get much support from the lower order, with none of the last five batsmen passing single figures, including two run outs, and Australia could manage only 173 in 59 overs. Pollard took 4/78.\nAustralia reduced England to 2/46, but a 97-run stand by Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 3/143 before both fell for half-centuries. Nevertheless, England were already 5/162 at stumps on the first day, having almost overtaken the Australians' score.\nThe next morning, Cristofani took four wickets to dismiss England for 243 and ended with 5/55. Australia then collapsed to 6/69, still a run in arrears, when Cristofani came to the crease. He struck an unbeaten 110, while his teammates added only 41 for the remaining four wickets, as Australia were all out for 210. WE Phillipson took 6/48. England were left with a target of 141 on the final day, which they reached with six wickets in hand to square the series 2–2.\nHassett wrote at the end of the series that \"This is cricket as it should be...These games have shown that international cricket can be played as between real friends—so let's have no more talk of \"war\" in cricket\". Miller topped the batting averages for the series, with 443 runs at 63.28. His aggregate exceeded that of Hammond and Hutton, who made 369 and 380 respectively. Miller also took 10 wickets at 27.70. Of Miller's batting, Hassett said that \"as a strokeplayer he is second to none\". his exploits in military teams led some to compare him to Jack Gregory, who had broken into top-flight cricket with his exploits with an AIF team immediately after the First World War.\nThe series was regarded as an outstanding success, with a total attendance of 367,000 and bright and attacking play.\nThe English summer concluded with five more matches. The Australians defeated Nottinghamshire by 103 runs in a two-day game and Leveson-Gower's XI by an innings and 108 runs in their last first-class fixture. This was followed by a low-scoring two-day match in which Australia lost to Surrey by three wickets; 37 wickets fell for just 327 runs. Australia then won two more single-innings games against Sussex and at Middlesbrough versus the Combined Counties.\nIn India.\nDue to the unexpectedly strong success of the Victory Tests, the government of Australia, led by foreign minister Doc Evatt, ordered the Australian Services to delay their demobilisation. With the team raising so much money for war charities, the government directed them to travel home via India and Ceylon for further fundraising matches for the Red Cross.\nThe Australians faced an arduous schedule; eight of the nine matches were first-class; three were international matches, and four were against the zones of India.\nMiller, the vice-captain of the team, almost missed the trip to India after turning up late for the voyage. The servicemen arrived in Bombay and took a two-day train journey to Lahore to play North Zone. North batted first and made 410; Australia replied with 351, and Pepper top-scored with 77. He then took 5/45 in the second innings and reduced the hosts to 7/103, but time ran out and the match ended in a draw.\nThe Australians headed to Delhi with another long train journey for a match against a Prince's XI. It was a high-scoring match in hot conditions; the Indian Test players Vijay Merchant, Lala Amarnath and Syed Mushtaq Ali all struck centuries in the hosts' only innings of 401, and Hassett struck 187 and 124 not out in Australia's 8/424 declared and 5/304. Hassett then rested as Miller led the team against West Zone in Bombay. Miller top-scored with 106 in Australia's 362. The hosts replied with 9/500 declared, with Rusi Modi scoring 168, as the match ended in a high-scoring draw.\nIn the first match against India at Bombay's Brabourne Stadium, regarded as unofficial Tests, Hassett won the toss and elected to bat. Unlike the Victory Tests, these games were four days long. After Whitington fell for four, Carmody and Jack Pettiford added 177 for the second wicket, and scored 113 and 124 respectively. Australia proceeded to 2/301; Hassett scored 53, before four wickets fell in the space of 25 runs. Pepper added 95 and Workman 76, as Australia totalled 531 in almost two days of batting. Vijay Hazare took 5/109 and CS Nayudu 3/141.\nIn reply, India reached 1/82 at the end of the second day. All of their batsmen made a start, none of the top seven scoring less than 24, but only Amarnath (64) and Hazare (75) passed 50. India were out for 339 just before stumps on the third day and were forced to follow on. Four Australian bowlers took two wickets. The second innings followed a similar pattern and all of the top five Indian batsmen passed 20 without passing 70. India reached 8/239 and were only 47 runs ahead, leaving Australia in striking distance of victory, but Gul Mohammad and Amir Elahi added 51 for the ninth wicket and pushed the total to 304. This left Australia with 103 runs to win in half an hour. However, the Indian captain Merchant placed all of his fielders on the off side and instructed his bowlers to deliver the ball wide. The Australians ended at 1/31.\nAustralia were still searching for their first win of the Indian tour when they took on the Indian Universities in a non-first-class match in Pune. However, Australia managed 300 and then took only one wicket as their hosts reached 385 before declaring. Australia were 3/85 when time ran out.\nConflict hit the team after the ineffective display against the students. The team, mostly made up of RAAF personnel, had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery, and travelled across the Indian subcontinent via long train journeys. The airmen wanted to travel by air, and tried to ask Hassett and manager Keith Johnson for air travel. When this was refused, they threatened to abandon the tour or replace Lindsay Hassett, an Australian Imperial Force member, with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller, who were RAAF fighter pilots if their wish was not granted. With Bradman likely to miss the upcoming tour of New Zealand, the Services captain would be one of the leading candidates to lead Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when Squadron Leader Stan Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane already in India to transport the team. On the first flight to Calcutta, the squad survived an electrical storm that caused the plane to drop altitude.\nThe team was scheduled to play East Zone in Calcutta, but the city was gripped in deadly riots as independence activists agitated against British rule. The match went ahead, but on the first day, thousands of protestors invaded the pitch, interrupting play for an hour. Elsewhere in the city, 23 people were killed. Australia batted first and made only 107, before East Zone replied with 131. Led by Hassett's 125, Australia posted 304 to leave the hosts a target of 281. On the final day, Miller's friend Denis Compton, who was playing for East Zone while on deployment with the British Army in India, was nearing a century as his team closed in on victory. The pro-independence rioters broke through the security presence and invaded the pitch again. The leader of the demonstrators ran up to Compton and said: \"Mr Compton, you very good player, but you must stop\". In later years, Miller would quote this remark whenever Compton came to the crease in matches featuring both of them. Compton told the rioters to ask Hassett, saying that the Australian skipper controlled proceedings. Hassett smiled at the leader of the irate demonstrators and asked \"You wouldn't happen to have a cigarette, would you, old boy?\" The rioters calmed down and play resumed. Compton brought up his century with the winning runs. In 2005, the ECB and Cricket Australia decided that the player adjudged the Player of the Series in the Ashes would be awarded the Compton-Miller Medal, recognising their friendship and rivalry.\nThe second international match took place at Eden Gardens a week later. Merchant won the toss and elected to bat. Vinoo Mankad, Hazare and Modi all made half-centuries and the hosts ended with 386 on the second day. Pepper was the most successful of the Australians with 4/120. The Australian innings was set up by a second wicket partnership of 218 between Whitington (155) and Pettiford (101). Miller came in 3/312 and then hit Mankad for four sixes from five balls, before falling to the said bowler for 82. This set up Australia's total of 472. India started their second innings late on the third day, and they declared late on the final day at 4/350, after Merchant (155 not out) and Abdul Hafeez Kardar (86 not out) had put on an unbroken stand of 189. This left Australia with an unfeasible target of 266 in around an hour. The Australians reached 2/49 and the match ended in a draw.\nCaptaining the team, Miller took 3/19 and 1/8 in a match against South Zone in Madras, the Australians' only win on Indian soil, by six wickets.\nThe final match in India was the third and deciding match in the international series, at Madras. Hassett won the toss and elected to bat, but his batsmen collapsed to 5/103, when Pepper joined Hassett at the crease. The pair added 181, but their dismissals for 87 and 143 signalled the end of the Australian innings for 339 early on the second day after a collapse of 5/55. Shute Banerjee took 4/86 and Chandu Sarwate 4/94.\nIn reply, India fell to 4/110, before Amarnath (113) and Modi (203) rebuilt the innings, supported by Gul Mohammad (55) and Nayudu (64). The hosts were eventually out for 525 late on the third day. Pepper was the most successful of the Australians, taking 4/118. Australia faced an uphill task to save the match, and the opening pair of Carmody and Whitington added 133. However, wickets fell regularly thereafter and the tourists were all out for 275. Banerjee and Sarwate both took four wickets each for the second time. India then accumulated the 92 runs needed for victory, with six wickets in hand.\nIt was not a happy tour for Johnson and his men on the playing arena. They lost the three-match series against India 1–0 and recorded only one victory, against South Zone.\nAustralia ended the subcontinental part of the tour with victory over Ceylon by an innings and 44 runs. Not wanting to wait a month for the next boat and a fortnight's sea voyage, the Australians returned to Perth by hitching a ride on a B-24 Liberator. The pilot of the RAAF plane had already promised 14 friends a lift so that they would not be stuck in India for another six months, so the Australian team sat on the floor of the aircraft. They made it back to Australia despite suffering engine trouble and an overloaded plane.\nIn Australia.\nJohnson's team arrived in Australia late in 1945, but the armed services and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. The fixtures were meant to revive cricket following the war and were also used as a lead-up to the international tour to New Zealand in March 1946.\nThe Services performed poorly; after playing consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state.\nThe first match against Western Australia saw the hosts score 323, and the servicemen replied with 301; Miller top-scored with 80. The Western Australians reached 2/144 when time ran out. The second match against South Australia followed a similar pattern. The hosts replied to the Services' 314 with 319, and after Hassett's men replied with 255, the Bradman-led South Australians reached 1/130 when time ran out. Pepper took 4/100 and Ellis 5/88.\nIn the next match against Victoria at St Kilda, Hassett's men were hammered. Ian Johnson took ten wickets for the match and the hosts bowled out the Servicemen for 118 and 182 to win by an inning and 156 runs. Miller top-scored in both innings with 37 and 59.\nThe military men had another difficult time against New South Wales, as their opponents made 7/551 declared, with Test batsman Sid Barnes scoring a century. Apart from Miller, the Services batsmen struggled. Miller reached 74 as Services limped to 9/171. Services had no batsmen left with Pettiford injured and retired hurt, so O'Reilly allowed the twelfth man to Workman to be substituted in and allowed to bat, in order to give Miller a chance of making a century. Miller attacked and scored 31 of the last 33 runs, ending with an unbeaten 105, with 11 fours in 172 minutes. He earned plaudits among cricket pundits on Australian soil. Former leading Test batsman Alan Kippax opined that \"Australia has unearthed a new champion\", claiming that he was finer than Jack Gregory and saying that \"few batsmen I have watched have had his ability to blend beauty and power\". O'Reilly said that Miller's century was \"one of the best hundreds ever got against me\". The Services were forced to follow on and were bowled out for 339 to fall to another innings defeat. The Services struggled against the leg spin of Colin McCool, who took 11 wickets in a drawn match against Queensland. The hosts were 5/186 in pursuit of 190 for victory when time ran out and saved Hassett's team. In the final match against Tasmania, the Services came as close as they would to a victory on Australian soil. After taking a 97-run first innings lead, they set Tasmania 292 for victory and the hosts held on for a draw with only wicket in hand. They were 9/166 when time ran out.\nJohnson was involved in another administrative dispute during the Australian leg of the campaign. Cec Pepper, whom teammates Keith Miller and Dick Whitington regarded as one of the best all rounders in the world and a certainty for Australian Test selection, appealed for leg before wicket against Australian captain Don Bradman in the match against South Australia. The appeal was turned down and Pepper complained to the umpire, prompting Bradman, who was also a member of the Australian Board, to lodge a complaint about Pepper. Pepper was subsequently never selected for Australia. Cricket historian Gideon Haigh said that \"Johnson was clearly upset by the affair, and also by the failure of the [national] selection panel [Bradman among them] ... to send Pepper, second only to Miller as a cricketer in the Services XI, to New Zealand\". Johnson tried to intercede on Pepper's behalf to no avail, although the other board members claimed that no directive had been given to the selectors to exclude Pepper.\nThis capped a poor end to the long and taxing Australian Services campaign. As the military men played poorly in Australia, the national selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand."

        "text": "James Edward Hunter (March 8, 1954 – August 2, 2010) was an American professional football player who was a defensive back for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). Hunter was the 10th player picked in the 1976 NFL draft after playing for Eddie Robinson at Grambling. Hunter is seventh all-time for interceptions in Lions history and is still considered one of the greatest players to ever play at Grambling. His son, Javin Hunter, played for Notre Dame and was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in 2002. His grandson, Jaden Ivey played basketball at Purdue University and was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in the 2022 NBA draft. Hunter also has a daughter, Marisa Hunter. \nNicknamed \"Hound Dog\" for his long-striding running ability, Hunter made an instant impact in the NFL. The 6-foot-3, 195-pound cornerback led the Lions with seven pass interceptions and was runner-up to future Pro Football Hall of Famer Mike Haynes as NFL Rookie Defensive Player of the Year. Hunter got his first start in 1976 at free safety, subbing for another Lions’ great, Dick Jauron, who had broken his leg. He shifted to left cornerback in 1977, playing alongside another future Pro Football Hall of Famer, Lem Barney. In his seven seasons with the Lions (1976–82), Hunter led the Lions in three seasons in pass interceptions (1976, ’77 and ’80) and had 27 career interceptions. He played in 86 Lions games before a neck injury sustained late in the 1982 season ended his career.\nHunter, Jimmy \"Spiderman\" Allen, and David Hill recorded a remake of Queen's hit \"Another One Bites the Dust\" in 1980.\nOn November 14, 2019, it was announced that Hunter would be part of the 2020 Black College Football Hall of Fame induction class."

        "title": "Climbing hold",
        "text": "A climbing hold is a shaped grip that is usually attached to a climbing wall so that climbers can grab or step on it. On most walls, climbing holds are arranged in paths called routes, by specially trained route setters. Climbing holds come in a large array of sizes and shapes to provide different levels of challenge to a climber. Climbing holds are either bolted to a wall via hex-head bolts and existing t-nuts or they are screwed on with several small screws. In extreme cases, concrete anchors may be used (if putting holds on the underside of a bridge, for example).\nEarly materials.\nRock.\nIn the early stages, climbing holds were crafted by casting real rocks into concrete blocks; later, they evolved into rocks with holes drilled into them, allowing attachment to a wall. While the feel of these holds is realistic, rock holds are heavy and can polish with heavy use. Rock holds are also difficult to manufacture.\nWood.\nWood was another early hold-making material, mainly because it was inexpensive and easy to carve into various shapes. It is still used today in various forms for homemade and commercially produced hand holds. Wood holds are usually smooth and pleasant to grab, though they are difficult to wash and splintering may become a problem with age. Wolfgang Güllich made the first campus board with wooden rungs to help him train for his 9a route Action Directe. In recent years wooden holds have made a resurgence, with many companies offering wooden holds. These are usually used for steep training boards, though some climbing walls do use wooden holds alongside their resin holds\nPolyester resin.\nIn the early days, most companies that manufactured holds used a resin mixture. Early mixtures of polyester resin had issues with wear and tear, often becoming chipped and cracked. The chipped or broken edge of a resin hold can often provide an unintended place to grab that can be sharp or otherwise dangerous to the climber. Because resin holds are not flexible, they may crack if they are being tightened down on a wall that is not completely flat. Modern polyester mixes have largely overcome these problems. A final problem is the weight of resin holds. As hold sizes have grown and grown, in many cases resin has become an impractical material to use. However, using a process known as hollow-backing the weight of the hold can be dramatically reduced. Modern production methods such as hollow-backing are keeping polyester as the preferred choice for many climbing walls and hold production companies.\nOther materials.\nMachined natural stone holds are intended to give climbers a real stone feel. Due to processing costs, they are more expensive than resin holds and require extra care when installing. They are purported to be more environmentally friendly, and to bring the feeling of outdoor climbing to indoor climbing walls.\nA rubber-like backing may be placed on each hold in an effort to prevent the holds from spinning. This technique has had mixed success, as eventually the rubber backing begins to peel away from the wall, providing a similar unintended handhold as the chipped resin might. The softer mixture is more durable than a brittle resin, but with uneven climbing walls and overtightening these holds develop slow cracks that eventually render the hold useless.\n\"Synthetic rock\" (resin/rock powder mixture) combined with slippery hard plastic is another innovation. The texture of these holds is quite like outdoor rock, allowing hold shapes that would be dangerous with a more slippery material.\nCorn and soy based resins are being developed for use in climbing holds. The goal is an \"environmentally friendly\" hold material that is also light and durable.\nModern Materials.\nPolyurethane Resin.\nCurrently, a large quantity of commercial holds are made of polyurethane (often called PU or urethane in the USA) or a polyurethane mixture. PU is lighter, more flexible, and less prone to chipping and breakage than polyester or natural materials. Like polyester (PE), PU mixtures can vary, and different mixtures have different textures and strengths. It's very simple to make a quality polyester recipe, but much harder to make a top quality polyurethane. If the polyurethane is too soft it will split apart when the hold is tightened, or the bolt might get pulled through the hold, or the hold will flex on the wall or could polish (become slick) quickly. If the polyurethane is too hard it will be brittle (like polyester) and the edges could chip or it could crack when tightened (also like polyester). Some climbers believe polyurethane can become warm with intensive use, though a few moments of not being held and some brushing usually solves the problem. PU holds are generally a lot lighter than Polyester holds as PU tolerates a much thinner wall so it can be hollowed out and maintain strength whereas PE holds need to be solid or have very thick walls or they are much more prone to breaking. Polyurethane is the leading hold material in the USA. However, there is an Atlantic split with most of Europe preferring Polyester mixes. There are many reasons for this, mostly that PU is generally a newer material and Europe only recently has been exposed to quality PU mixes. Additionally, PU is generally more expensive than PE.\nFiberglass.\nIn an effort to improve the durability of climbing holds, many materials have been experimented with. Thin, hollow fiberglass holds are extremely light and strong. A desirable texture is overlaid onto the fibreglass using various methods. Early fibreglass holds had a texture made from sand mixed into paint, progressing to sand embedded into various types of resin. Modern companies have developed techniques to place polyester resin over the fibreglass, giving a hold which has all the benefits of both resin types without the downsides. The main issue with this texture is the complexity in manufacture means few companies have the ability to produce them and also the cost of these holds is relatively high. Texture longevity is also an issue.\nT-Nuts may be embedded in the fibreglass so additional holds can be bolted to the main hold.\nHold Types.\nJugs.\nThe term \"jugs\", derived from the expression \"jug-handle\", has dual meanings in the climbing world. One meaning is size based—jugs are traditionally large holds. Most jugs should have space for both hands to fit on the hold. The other meaning of jug refers to a hold's positivity or degree of concavity. A hold that is called a jug should be fairly easy to use, meaning it is either a very positive hold or it is a flat hold on a less than vertical wall (slab). Because they are easy to use, jugs are often found on beginner routes, warm-up problems, and steep walls. Jugs are also commonly used as resting or clipping holds on routes.\nMini-Jugs.\nMini-jugs are holds that are positive but much smaller than traditional jugs. They are usually intended to be held with one hand only. They are useful because they are easier to carry in a bucket than big jugs and they use less material to manufacture than larger holds do (so they are more cost effective).\nSlopers.\nSlopers are the least positive of the handholds. They slope down away from the wall with generally a smooth surface, therefore requiring the climber, for maximum friction and in order to gain maximum effectiveness of the hold, to use an open handed grip to pull against the hold and push inwards. These holds are usually considered more difficult and are typically reserved for advanced routes.\nPockets.\nPockets are holds that have a small opening, only allowing the climber to hold them with one to three fingers. Pockets can be shallow or deep. One fingered pockets are called \"monos\", and are considered extremely stressful on the tendons. Finger strength must be trained in order to use pockets effectively. Though monos are the most dangerous, all pockets load only a couple of fingers, so climbers must be careful to avoid injuring their tendons. If the edge of the pocket has a sharp radius it will feel more positive but also more uncomfortable. A smooth radius on a pocket is generally the most comfortable to climb on.\nPinches.\nPinches are holds that have two opposing faces which must be pinched (usually by the entire hand, with fingers on one side and the thumb on the other) to grip. Technically, any hold in which the use of the thumb in opposition improves the hold's positivity is a pinch. Pinches require significant hand strength to use, and are usually used on more challenging routes and boulder problems.\nEdges.\nEdges vary in size and angle. The best way to grip an edge varies in all ways to grip a hold, from open hand grip, to flex grip, and closed hand grip (which is more commonly referred to as crimping). Crimping is when an individual places their thumb over their pointer finger. It is often used as the way to refer to an edge as a \"crimp\", and there are many ways to better describe an edge- microcrimper (smallest), slopey crimper, big crimper, bad crimper, good crimper, Fred Nicole crimper (microcrimper), juggy crimper.\nThe picture to the right shows a person using a flex grip on an edge. Though the edge is being referred to as a \"crimp\" in this case, the climber is not actually crimping on the hold.\nVolumes.\nVolumes are an extremely large type of hold that any variety of holds can be attached to. The volume is attached to the wall, and it has pre-placed t-nuts in it to which other holds can be attached. Volumes were at one time made from wood, but now they are also made in a variety of materials (including fiberglass, coated wood, resin, urethane, and moulded plastic) by several climbing companies. Volumes are especially prevalent in Europe and on the World Cup circuit, where sometimes entire routes will be constructed from gigantic volumes. To imitate these textured World Cup volumes, sandpaper can be placed on homemade wooden volumes to create texture and allow climbers to make use of the volume's features."

He also played several years in the minor American Hockey League, and retired in 1990.\nBiography.\nLanthier was born in Montreal, Quebec. As a youth, he played in the 1976 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Montreal.\nA gifted junior scorer, Lanthier was selected in the third round (52nd overall) of the 1981 Entry Draft by the Canucks. In his last two junior seasons with the Laval Voisins, he was a linemate of a young Mario Lemieux. He turned pro in 1983, spending most of the 1983–84 season in the AHL, where he notched 25 goals in 60 games for the Fredericton Express. He also earned an 11-game callup to the Canucks, highlighted by scoring his first two NHL goals in his hometown of Montreal on February 9, 1984.\nLanthier continued to produce well in the AHL in 1984–85, earning another 27 games with the Canucks, in which he scored 6 goals and 10 points. He was given an opportunity to play full-time for the Canucks in 1985–86, appearing in a career-high 62 games. However, for a skill player his production proved somewhat disappointing as he recorded just 7 goals and 17 points. For 1986–87, he found himself back in the AHL, and suffered through a miserable year in which he recorded just 15 goals and failed to see any NHL action. He would rebound in 1987–88 with a monster year in the AHL, finishing 2nd in the league with totals of 71 assists and 106 points. His strong play earned him another call-up to Vancouver, where he recorded a goal and an assist in 5 games.\nIn the summer of 1988, Lanthier signed as a free agent with the Boston Bruins. However, he spent only a few months in that organization before being dealt to the New Jersey Devils. He spent the final two seasons of his career with the Utica Devils, New Jersey's AHL farm team, before retiring in 1990.\nLanthier finished his career with 16 goals and 16 assists for 32 points in 105 NHL games, all with the Vancouver Canucks, along with 29 penalty minutes."

        "text": "The 2008 LSU Tigers baseball team represented Louisiana State University in the NCAA Division I baseball season of 2008. This was the final year for the team in the original Alex Box Stadium. A new stadium was built during the season and opened on opening day of the 2009 season.\nThe team was coached by Paul Mainieri who was in his second season at LSU. In his first year at LSU, Mainieri's team posted a 29–26–1 record and failed to make the SEC tournament or the NCAA tournament.\nIn a dramatic turnaround, Mainieri led the Tigers to an unexpected appearance in the 2008 College World Series.\nPre-season.\nIn September 2007, Collegiate Baseball newspaper ranked LSU's recruiting class as the top ranked class in the nation. LSU's recruiting class included 9 players that were drafted by Major League Baseball clubs, eight High School All-Americans and three first team junior college All-Americans among the 19 players the Tigers brought in. Baseball America ranked LSU's recruiting as the #2 ranked class in the nation, behind San Diego.\nIn February 2008, the SEC baseball coaches picked LSU to finish 5th (out 6 teams) in the SEC Western Division in the 17th annual preseason SEC coaches poll.\nAlso, starting pitcher Jared Bradford was named to the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association preseason third-team All-America squad. Bradford was also named to the watchlist for the 2008 Brooks Wallace Award, which is presented to the nation's top collegiate baseball player in conjunction with the College Baseball Hall of Fame’s annual induction festivities.\nDuring the offseason, former LSU baseball head coach Jack Lamabe died. Lamabe coached the Tigers for five seasons from 1979 until 1983.\nRegular season.\nLSU entered the regular season ranked #30 in the Collegiate Baseball poll and #34 in the NCBWA poll. They dropped from the ranking after the first weekend of play which saw the team win 2 out of 3 games against Indiana. The Tigers then rebounded and went on a 9-game winning streak before losing the last two games before Southeastern Conference play began.\nIn its first conference series of the year, LSU traveled to Knoxville, TN to face the Tennessee Volunteers. The Tigers were swept 3 games to none but were competitive in all games. LSU then defeated their rival Tulane in a midweek game at home before playing host to the Arkansas Razorbacks in another conference series. The Tigers won the series 2 games to 1.\nAfter splitting two midweek games, including a tough loss to the University of New Orleans, LSU headed to Gainesville, FL for a conference series again Florida. The Tigers lost the first two games of the series but salvaged the last one and rode a 4-game winning streak until finally losing to Alabama in game two of their series. But the Tigers won the third game of the series and improved to a 5–7 record in SEC games.\nNext on the schedule was rival Ole Miss. The Tigers lost the first game 2–1 in a close matchup and then proceeded to lose the next game as well. LSU managed an 8–2 win on Sunday to avoid the sweep.\nAfter a midweek game against Nicholls State, the Tigers traveled to Maestri Field for their second of three games again the University of New Orleans. New Orleans again pulled away late and won the game by a score of 6–5.\nGeorgia then came into Alex Box Stadium for a conference series. At the time Georgia led the SEC and would eventually go on to be the SEC champions. The Tigers played the Bulldogs tough but Georgia managed to win the first two games. In the Sunday game, LSU blew a lead and allowed Georgia to tie the game and send it into extra innings. After 12 innings of play the travel curfew rule came into effect and a tie was declared.\nAfter the Georgia debacle the Tigers had a 6–11–1 conference record and looked to be on the outside looking in for the SEC baseball tournament.\nThe Tigers were able to turn things around, however, as they began a winning streak that they rode all the way to the end of the regular season and into the postseason.\nThey started the streak in New Orleans against bitter rival Tulane. They then continued it into their conference series again South Carolina, who was at that time a top-10 team. LSU managed an improbable sweep against the Gamecocks and then moved on to a series against Kentucky in Cliff Hagan Stadium. At that time the Wildcats had only lost 2 games all season in their home stadium. The Tigers again pulled off the improbably sweep and they were now sitting at 12–11–1 in conference, the first time all season that they had been over .500 in conference games.\nMississippi State came into Alex Box Stadium for the final 3 regular season games ever to be held in that stadium. The fans showed up in droves to see the Tigers sweep their third straight conference foe and send \"the Box\" out in style.\nNext up for the Tigers was their final regular season game against the University of New Orleans in the annual Wally Pontiff Jr. Classic at Zephyr Field in Metairie, LA. New Orleans had already won the previous two meeting and they were riding a 13-game win streak coming into this one. It was the longest winning streak in college baseball. LSU's streak was in second place at 12 games. It looked like New Orleans might extend their winning streak but the Tigers pulled ahead late in the game and won it.\nTheir final 3 regular season games came against a slumping Auburn team in Auburn, AL. LSU swept their 4th straight conference series and finished the regular season with a 39–16–1 record and an 18–11–1 conference record. Georgia won the outright SEC title but LSU was able to win the SEC West division title. The Tigers headed into the SEC Baseball Tournament as the #2 seed in to tournament.\nSEC tournament.\nThe Tigers entered the 2008 SEC baseball tournament on an NCAA-best 16-game winning streak. In Game 1 of the tournament, LSU faced South Carolina, a team they had swept earlier in the season. The Gamecocks took a 4–0 lead into the bottom of the 9th inning but LSU rallied to tie the game and take it into extra innings. In the bottom of the 10th inning, LSU's Blake Dean hit a walk-off home run to end the game at a score of 5–4.\nIn their second game of the SEC Tournament, LSU defeated defending tournament champion Vanderbilt by a score of 8–2. The Tigers extended their winning streak to 18 games and earned a day off before having to play their next game.\nIn LSU's third game in the tournament they faced Alabama. The Crimson Tide took an early lead but the Tigers came back to tie the game at six runs and then LSU's Blake Dean padded his tournament MVP resume by hitting a grand slam to break the tie. The Tigers went on to win the game by a score of 12–8 and moved onto the championship game.\nThe Tigers faced Ole Miss in the championship game, and like many of their games this season, they fell behind early only to rally back to win the game. LSU won the game by a score of 8–2 and claimed the SEC tournament title for the first time since the 2000 season.\nNCAA tournament: Regionals.\nOn Sunday May 25 it was announced that LSU was selected as a host site for the 2008 NCAA tournament for the 18th time in the history of the program and for the first time since the 2005 season. When the full NCAA tournament bracket was released the next day, LSU was awarded the #7 national seed in the tournament, guaranteeing them home field advantage throughout the Super Regionals as long as they won the Regional round. It was the third time LSU earned a national seed since the advent of them in 1999. In 2000 the Tigers were the #2 national seed and went on to win the College World Series. In 2003, LSU again earned the #2 national seed. They made the College World Series that year but went 0–2 and were eliminated quickly.\nIn the Baton Rouge Regional, LSU was designated the #1 seed, Southern Mississippi earned the #2 seed, the University of New Orleans, who beat LSU two out of three times during the regular season, earned the #3 seed and Texas Southern earned the #4 seed.\nLSU opened the Regional against Texas Southern in an afternoon game on Friday, May 30. LSU grabbed a quick lead in the 1st inning and cruised to a 12–1 victory. The Tigers then awaited the results of the night game between New Orleans and Southern Mississippi to find out who their next opponent would be.\nSouthern Mississippi beat New Orleans and moved on to face LSU in the night game on Saturday. The Tigers defeated the Golden Eagles by a score of 13–4 to advance to the championship round of the Regional.\nSouthern Mississippi climbed back through the losers bracket to make the championship round and face LSU again. But the Tigers again put the Golden Eagles away by winning 11–4 and moving on to the Super Regionals. The win brought LSU's winning streak to 23 consecutive games and set a new SEC record. The previous record was 22 games set by South Carolina in 2000.\nNCAA tournament: Super Regionals.\nUC-Irvine won the Lincoln, NE regional and moved on to the Super Regional to face LSU in Alex Box Stadium in Baton Rouge, LA. UC-Irvine won the first game 11–5 based on a strong performance by their ace pitcher, Scott Gorgen. The Anteaters looked to be on their way to a second straight trip to the College World Series as they took a lead into the 9th inning of game 2, however the Tigers fought back and won the game in comeback fashion by a score of 9–7. LSU wasted no time in game 3 cruising to a 6–0 lead with three consecutive home runs in the 1st inning and eventually winning the game 21–7. The Tigers celebrated the school's 14th trip to the College World Series in what was the last game in the 70-year history of Alex Box Stadium.\nNCAA tournament: College World Series.\nPrior to the start of the CWS, LSU's pitching coach, Terry Rooney, was named the new head coach of the University of Central Florida baseball team. Rooney stayed with LSU until the end of the CWS.\nLSU faced North Carolina in the first game of the 2008 College World Series. The Tar Heels defeated the Tigers by a score of 8–4, giving LSU its 5th consecutive CWS loss and sending them to the losers bracket. The Tigers faced the Rice Owls next and looked to be headed home with an 0–2 CWS record again after trailing by a score of 5–0, however, in typical Tiger fashion, LSU rallied in the bottom of the 9th inning and won the game on a 3-run double by All-American Blake Dean.\nThe Tigers then had to face North Carolina again, who had lost to Fresno State. The game started on June 19 but was delayed by weather and completed on June 20. The game went into the top of the 9th inning tied 3–3 but a grand slam home run, the first in the College World Series since 2001, gave North Carolina a 7–3 lead. LSU was unable to rally in the bottom of the 9th, and their season was ended.\nLSU Tigers in the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft.\nThe following members of the 2008 LSU Tigers baseball team were drafted in the 2008 MLB Draft."

        "text": "A set in darts consists of a sequence of legs (games) played, ending when the count of legs won meets certain criteria. Throwing first is considered an advantage in a leg, so players alternate who throws first in each leg during the set. \nGenerally, a set will consist of the best of five legs (first player to win three) – although there are some exceptions. The most notable being the World Masters, where a set is the best of three legs (first to two).\nExample.\nDuring the final of the 2007 PDC World Darts Championship, Raymond van Barneveld defeated Phil Taylor by seven sets to six in one of the most dramatic darts matches of all-time. The breakdown of how each set went is shown here.\nTaylor won the first two sets by three legs to nil, then added the third set before van Barneveld took the next two. The match continued and went to six sets all. Neither player managed to gain a two-leg advantage in the final set \"tiebreak\" so the deciding leg was played when the score reached 5–5. Before the final leg, the players threw for the bullseye with the nearest given the advantage of throwing first.\nTournaments using sets.\nIn recent years, more and more new tournaments have decided against using sets as the scoring method – preferring to use the matchplay format of best of x legs (such as in the UK Open and Grand Slam of Darts). \nCurrently the following tournaments use sets as their scoring system."

        "title": "Tony Robinson (American football)",
        "text": "Kevin Altona \"Tony\" Robinson (born January 22, 1964) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Super Bowl-winning Washington Redskins as a replacement member of their team during the 1987 players' strike. Along with other Redskins replacement players from that year, he was eventually awarded a Super Bowl ring.\nRobinson played college football at Tennessee from 1982 to 1985. After spending his first two seasons as a backup, he guided the 1984 squad to a 7–4–1 record and an appearance in the Sun Bowl. He led the 1985 \"Sugar Vols\" squad through a difficult first half of the season, and was a Heisman Trophy candidate until blowing out his right knee during a close game against Alabama. A few weeks after the season, he was arrested in Knoxville on charges of distributing cocaine, critically damaging his prospects in the NFL. He went undrafted in the 1986 NFL Draft.\nIn 1987, during the strike, Robinson played in one game for the Redskins after starting replacement quarterback Ed Rubbert was injured. He led the Redskins' replacement players to an improbable 13–7 win over a Dallas Cowboys team that featured a number of players who had crossed the picket lines during the strike. His role was loosely portrayed by both Keanu Reeves and Michael Jace in the 2000 film \"The Replacements\".\nEarly years.\nRobinson was born in Monticello, Florida, the son of Johnnie Robinson, a truck driver, and his wife, Jean. He grew up in Tallahassee, where he played football with neighborhood kids from a very young age. He played high school football at Tallahassee's Leon High School under heralded coach Gene Cox. He joined Leon's junior varsity squad as a freshman in 1978, initially playing at wide receiver, but switching to quarterback when Cox noticed how easily he could throw the ball long distances.\nRobinson was named Leon's starting quarterback during his sophomore season. The decision was controversial, not only because Robinson was an underclassman, but because he was black. Cox, who had sent a string of quarterbacks to the college ranks, brushed off the criticism, stating, \"I've always believed in playing the best player,\" and that Robinson was \"unquestionably the best.\"\nDuring his three years as Leon's starting quarterback, Robinson completed 378 of 676 passes for 6,581 yards and 75 touchdowns, and was one of the few high school quarterbacks at the time to throw for more than 2,000 yards in three consecutive seasons. With Robinson as the starter, Leon lost just four times in 33 games. During his senior season, Robinson completed 155 of 261 passes for 2,354 yards and 24 touchdowns, leading Leon to an undefeated regular season. He won \"Florida Player of the Year\" accolades, and was named to the \"Parade\" All-American team.\nCollege career.\nRobinson had initially hoped to play for Florida State, which was located just a few miles from Leon High School, and had taken several Leon players in the past. Florida State, however, showed little interest in Robinson until late in his recruitment. His high school coach, Gene Cox, suggested it was because of Robinson's race, noting that Florida State had never had a black quarterback. Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden denied this, however, stating that he was concerned with Robinson's relatively skinny frame (he was listed at 6'4\", 170 pounds, coming out of high school). \"I really didn't think he could take the pounding,\" Bowden said.\nRobinson eventually signed with Tennessee. Volunteers head coach Johnny Majors had also waffled on Robinson's recruitment, expressing concern over a roster already packed with quarterbacks, but made up his mind at the last minute and offered Robinson a scholarship. Robinson joined Tennessee's stellar 1982 recruiting class, which included future NFL players Tim McGee, Joey Clinkscales, Charles Davis, Bruce Wilkerson, and Daryle Smith.\nTennessee had signed multiple quarterbacks in 1982. After a few practices, however, most realized they would not win the starting job over Robinson. Several, including Clinkscales and Davis, found new positions, while others left the team. During his freshman year, Robinson was a backup to star quarterback Alan Cockrell, and played very little. He led Tennessee's junior varsity team to a 3–1 record, however, completing 15 of 29 passes for 412 yards and seven touchdowns, and rushing for 109 yards. Robinson remained a backup to Cockrell during the 1983 season. He received his only significant playing time in Tennessee's 37–3 win over Georgia Tech, completing 6 of 12 passes for 123 yards and a 35-yard touchdown.\n1984 season.\nDisappointed over lack of playing time, Robinson contemplated leaving the team. He was suddenly vaulted into the starting slot, however, when Cockrell decided to skip his senior year to play Major League Baseball.\nRobinson performed reasonably well in season-opening wins over Washington State and Utah, though star running back Johnnie Jones shouldered much of the offensive burden. After suffering a leg injury, Robinson missed all of Tennessee's game against Army (allowing quarterback Daryl Dickey to get his first start), and struggled in the Vols' 29–10 loss to Auburn.\nRobinson's breakout performance came in Tennessee's shootout against rival Florida on October 13, 1984. He completed a school-record 29 passes for 371 yards, including a 52-yard touchdown pass to Tim McGee in the first quarter, and a 48-yard touchdown pass to Joey Clinkscales that pulled the Vols to within a score in the fourth quarter. He also had 18 yards rushing, giving him 389 yards of total offense, which was also a school record. Tennessee's defense was unable to stop Florida's running back tandem of Neal Anderson and John L. Williams, however, and the Gators prevailed 43–30.\nRobinson delivered another strong performance in Tennessee's game against rival Alabama on October 20, 1984. With Alabama leading 27–13 midway through the fourth quarter, Robinson engineered a scoring drive which culminated with a 17-yard touchdown pass to McGee. Teammate Andre Creamer then returned a punt to the Alabama 11-yard line, and Jones scored from a yard out a few plays later to cut the lead to 27–26 with just over two minutes remaining. Majors opted to go for the two-point conversion, which Robinson scored by faking a pitch to Jones and diving over the goal line, giving Tennessee a 28–27 victory, and setting off a wild celebration at Neyland Stadium. Robinson was named \"Southeast Back of the Week\" by the Associated Press for his performance.\nIn Tennessee's 24–21 win over Georgia Tech on October 27, Robinson completed 20 of 26 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown, and connected with tight end Jeff Smith on a 31-yard, fourth-down pass late in the fourth quarter to set up Fuad Reveiz's game-winning field goal. In the Vols' 41–9 win over Memphis State two weeks later, Robinson threw three touchdown passes, including a 34-yarder to McGee and a 24-yarder to Smith, and scored on a 25-yard run. In Tennessee's 17–12 loss to Kentucky — the Volunteers' last loss to the Wildcats until 2011 — Robinson engineered a drive to the Kentucky 13-yard line late the fourth quarter, but time expired as he was trying to down the ball. Robinson threw touchdown passes of 55 yards and 19 yards to McGee to lead Tennessee to a 29–13 win over rival Vanderbilt to finish the regular season. In the 1984 Sun Bowl, with Tennessee down 28–27, Robinson led a late drive into Maryland territory, but lost the ball on a fumble, allowing the Terrapins to escape with the win.\nRobinson finished the 1984 season with 153 completions on 256 passes for 1,963 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions, falling just short of Alan Cockrell's school single-season record of 2,021 passing yards. He also rushed for 126 yards and 3 touchdowns, giving him a school-record 2,089 yards of total offense. His 61.7% completion rate also set a record, surpassing Johnny Majors' 1956 mark of 61.3%.\n1985 season.\nRobinson was named Preseason All-SEC prior to the 1985 season. He was also considered a contender for the Heisman Trophy. In Tennessee's season opener against 10th-ranked UCLA, he threw for a school record 387 yards and two touchdowns, including a 68-yard bomb to Clinkscales, and rushed for 30 yards, giving him 417 total yards to break his own school record for total offense. The Bruins rallied to score 16 points late in the fourth quarter, however, to escape with a 26–26 tie.\nOn September 28, 1985, Tennessee hosted #1 Auburn, which featured eventual Heisman winner Bo Jackson at running back. On Tennessee's first drive, Robinson broke loose for a 39-yard scramble to set up the Vols' first score. Following an Auburn turnover, Robinson connected with McGee for a 37-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Robinson engineered a third scoring drive, capped by an off-balance touchdown pass to Vince Carter. When Auburn cut the lead to 24–6 in the fourth quarter, Robinson led the Vols downfield on another scoring drive, which featured a long pass to McGee and a touchdown pass to Clinkscales. After Auburn scored again, Robinson responded with a 30-yard touchdown pass to Eric Swanson, and the Vols held on for a 38–20 win. Robinson finished with 259 yards passing and a school-record four touchdown passes. Having upstaged Jackson, Robinson was featured on the cover of the October 7, 1985, edition of \"Sports Illustrated\" under the caption, \"The Tennessee Waltz: Tony Robinson Buries Auburn.\"\nAfter a hard-fought victory over Wake Forest, Tennessee traveled to Gainesville to face #7 Florida, who had not lost since the first week of the 1984 season. Robinson completed 26 of 36 passes for 300 yards, but managed just one touchdown pass — a 20-yarder to McGee in the fourth quarter — the Florida defense successfully executed a \"bend-but-don't-break\" strategy. Late in the fourth quarter, with Tennessee trailing 17–10, Robinson led the Vols to midfield, but the drive ended when his pass was tipped by Florida defensive tackle Rhondy Weston and intercepted by linebacker Alonzo Johnson to seal the victory for the Gators.\nOn October 19, Tennessee traveled to Birmingham to play Alabama, who were ranked #15 and entered the game with a 4–1 record following a 19–17 loss to Penn State. Both offenses struggled to move the ball for most of the game, though Robinson and freshman running back Keith Davis had garnered enough offensive production to give Tennessee a 13–7 lead after three quarters. Following an Alabama turnover, Tennessee had driven inside the Alabama 10-yard line early in the fourth quarter. On a 2nd-and-1 scramble, Robinson was sandwiched between linebacker Cornelius Bennett and defensive lineman Curt Jarvis, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee. He recalled Bennett saying, \"T-man, stay down, you're hurt. I can feel it.\" Though stunned with Robinson out of the game, Tennessee regrouped and held on for a 16–14 victory.\nIn the days following the Alabama game, doctors determined that Robinson's injury would require arthroscopic surgery, effectively ending his season. While many considered Tennessee's win over Alabama a pyrrhic victory with the loss of Robinson, the team would rally behind backup quarterback Daryl Dickey, going 6–0–1 in its final seven games to win the school's first SEC Championship in 16 years. Playing in just five games, four of which were against opponents ranked in the Top 20, Robinson completed 91 of 143 passes for 1,246 yards, 8 touchdowns and 7 interceptions.\nRecords.\nRobinson completed 253 of 411 passes for 3,332 yards, 23 touchdowns, and 17 interceptions, and rushed for 195 yards and four touchdowns, during his career at Tennessee. Although he started just 15 regular season games, his 3,527 yards of total offense remained the school's 14th-highest career total as of the 2012 season. Beginning with the 1984 Auburn game, Robinson threw a touchdown pass in 13 consecutive games, a record which stood until Heath Shuler threw touchdown passes in 18 consecutive games in the early 1990s.\nRobinson's single-game record of 417 yards of total offense against UCLA in 1985 was broken by Peyton Manning, who accumulated 475 yards against Florida in 1996. Robinson's tally is now the school's fourth-highest single-game total. His 389 yards of total offense against Florida in 1984 remains the school's eighth-highest single-game total. His single-season record of 2,089 total yards was broken by Jeff Francis in 1988, and has since been surpassed several times.\nProfessional career.\nAccording to Robinson's friends, he underwent a personality change after his injury. Many of his acquaintances recalled that he became more withdrawn. In a later interview, Robinson admitted he had started using cocaine in 1985. In January 1986, a few days after Tennessee's victory in the 1986 Sugar Bowl (which Robinson watched from the sidelines), he and his roommate, former Vol fullback Kenneth B.B. Cooper, were arrested by Knoxville police in a sting operation. Robinson was subsequently charged with taking part in the sale of 30 grams of cocaine. He eventually pleaded no contest to lesser charges, and was sentenced to nine months in prison.\nHis chances for an NFL career in shambles, Robinson received an offer to play for the Richmond Ravens of the Continental Interstate Football League. He was still serving his sentence at the time, but was freed temporarily by a judge. While he was playing for the Ravens in 1987, the NFL players went on strike, leaving team owners searching for replacement players. Robinson's coach with the Ravens was a friend of Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, and recommended Robinson to Gibbs. Robinson signed with the Redskins in September 1987 as a backup to replacement quarterback Ed Rubbert.\nWith Rubbert at quarterback, the Redskins won their first two replacement games. In the third and final replacement game on October 19, 1987, the Redskins played their rival, the Dallas Cowboys in Dallas on \"Monday Night Football\". While the Redskins were playing with a roster consisting entirely of replacement players, a number of Cowboys players had crossed the picket lines—among them Tony Dorsett, Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones, and Randy White—and thus few people thought the Redskins had much of a chance. In the first quarter, Robinson's former college teammate linebacker Dale Jones injured Rubbert's throwing shoulder with a tackle. Robinson entered the game, and helped lead Washington to a 13–7 upset, completing 11 of 18 passes for 152 yards and two interceptions, and was widely praised for his handling of the offense. The game has been called one of the greatest upsets in NFL history. Redskins announcer Frank Herzog said of Robinson: \"He played a hell of game. He was the hero.\"\nPersonal life.\nRobinson was cut after the strike, and returned to finish out the season with the Richmond Ravens. After the season, he returned to Tennessee to complete his sentence. In February 1988, his agent said he was close to signing with an NFL team, but this never materialized. In 1989, he was arrested for parole violation charges. He joined the Virginia Storm of the Minor League Football System later that year. In 1991, however, he was arrested and convicted of forging stolen checks, and was sentenced to two years in prison. After his release in 1993, he returned to Tallahassee.\n\"The Replacements\", a Howard Deutch comedy inspired by the Redskins' 1987 replacement run, premiered in 2000. The main character, Shane Falco (portrayed by Keanu Reeves), was loosely based on Robinson. The casting of a white actor to play a character inspired by a black athlete generated controversy. A group of Howard University students led by Fred Outten protested the film's opening at the United Artists' theater in Bethesda, Maryland. Responding to the controversy in a subsequent interview, Robinson merely stated that he \"didn't read much into\" being portrayed by a white actor.\nFor more than a decade after his return to Tallahassee, Robinson struggled with drug use, racking up twenty-five misdemeanor charges, most of them related to drug possession. His last charge came in 2006. In a 2012 interview, he said his days of drug use were over. He noted he remained close to his brothers, Frederick and Broderick, and had started coaching Pee-Wee football.\nJosh Cody, a son of Robinson, played defensive end for UT Martin. Cody was with the Skyhawks when they played Tennessee at Neyland Stadium in 2010.\nOn October 19, 2013, Robinson returned to Neyland Stadium for the first time since 1985 for Tennessee's game against South Carolina. The move was part of an effort by first-year head coach Butch Jones and Vol for Life Coordinator Antone Davis to reach out to former players. Robinson ran through the \"T\" alongside former coach Johnny Majors. On November 9, Robinson was honored as a Vol \"Legend of the Game\" during Tennessee's game against Auburn. On April 12, 2014, Robinson played in the \"Vol for Life\" flag football game at halftime of Tennessee's annual Orange and White Game. He threw a touchdown pass, and was awarded the game's MVP trophy."

        "title": "1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 65th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 12, 1994, at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League—tying the Indians for the all-time record of most All-Star Games hosted by one franchise, as the Pirates had also hosted in 1944, 1959, and 1974 (and would again in 2006). The game resulted in the National League defeating the American League 8–7 in 10 innings. It was the National League's first win since 1987.\nThis All-Star Game also marked the inaugural telecast for The Baseball Network, a joint-venture between Major League Baseball, ABC and NBC. This was NBC's first television broadcast of a Major League Baseball game since Game 5 of the 1989 National League Championship Series on October 9 of that year.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nGame summary.\nCowboy Junkies lead singer Margo Timmins sang the Canadian National Anthem and rock singer Meat Loaf sang the U.S. National Anthem. Both were accompanied by the 1994–95 Penn State ROTC Color Guard. Then, Willie Stargell threw out the ceremonial first pitch. It was once said that \"having Willie Stargell on your team is like having a diamond ring on your finger.\"\nThe AL got on the board quickly against starting pitcher Greg Maddux. Boggs singled with one out and went to third on Griffey's double in the left center field gap. Frank Thomas the hit a sinking line shot off the glove of Tony Gwynn in center which scored Boggs and moved Griffey to third. But Maddux escaped the jam by stabbing Joe Carter's line drive up the middle and then throwing to first to double off Thomas who had taken off for second. In the bottom of the first the NL got to starter Jimmy Key with a double into the left field corner by the Cardinals' Gregg Jeffries and a sac fly by Barry Bonds who was booed lustily by his former fans in Pittsburgh.\nThe NL, who had been dominated in the All Star Games the last 2 years, appeared to be pulling away in the third inning against that season's AL Cy Young Award winner David Cone (of the Royals). Pinch hitter Jeff Bagwell hit a one-out single, Jeffries was hit by a pitch, and Tony Gwynn ripped a double into the right field corner scoring both runners (Jeffries just barely getting around the tag of catcher Pudge Rodriguez). After Bonds struck out, the Dodgers' Mike Piazza hit a two-out single scoring Gwynn to increase the margin to 4–1.\nThe first-place Expos' Ken Hill kept the AL off the scoreboard for two innings. However, in the 6th, the vaunted AL lineup broke through against Doug Drabek. Roberto Alomar singled to center, stole second, and scored on a Griffey hit (his second RBI of the night). Even though Griffey was tagged out in a rundown after his hit, the inning continued with a two-out rally. Frank Thomas singled, then came around to score thanks to an errant throw from Matt Williams on a ground out by Joe Carter. Carter then came home on a hit by the prior year's All-Star game MVP Kirby Puckett.\nWith the scored tied 4–4, the NL retaliated immediately the next half-inning when the Expos' Marquis Grissom sliced a home run down the right field line off Randy Johnson. Later in the inning, with a runner on and one out, the Pittsburgh crowd roared but then exhaled when the slap-hitting veteran Ozzie Smith nearly hit another home run off the Big Unit – missing the left field foul pole by a few feet.\nIt all appeared to unravel for the NL in the 7th, clinging to their now slim one-run lead. Astros closer John Hudek quickly gave up a single to Pudge and a walk to Mickey Tettleton. Then the Twins' Chuck Knoblauch looked to have a sure single on the AstroTurf through the left side, but Ozzie Smith made a spectacular diving stop and fired to second for the force play. The play, though, only temporarily halted the AL uprising as veteran Danny Jackson came in to relieve and got knocked around. He allowed a run-scoring double by the Red Sox third baseman Scott Cooper and a 2-run single by the Indians' Kenny Lofton.\nThe NL looked to be running out of time thanks to scoreless innings by AL pitchers Pat Hentgen of the Blue Jays and Wilson Álvarez of the White Sox. In the 9th the AL brought in veteran closer Lee Smith who had resurrected his dominant stuff one last time with the Orioles that season. He quickly walked Marquis Grissom to lead off. Then got Craig Biggio to hit a sharp grounder to third baseman Scott Cooper at third. However, Cooper double clutched ever so slightly and the AL just missed turning the double play on Biggio. This allowed Fregosi to pinch-hit slugger Fred McGriff, who he had saved up, to come to the plate as the tying run. The Crimedog promptly drove a Smith's splitter into the centerfield stands to tie up the game in dramatic fashion.\nIn the 10th the NL quickly went to work on AL reliever Jason Bere of the White Sox. Gwynn chopped a single through the box with no one out. The Expos' Moisés Alou then slammed a double that short-hopped the left center field wall. Gwynn was waved all the way home from first base and slid just under Pudge Rodriguez's tag to end the game.\nAfter the game, National League President Leonard S. Coleman Jr. made All-Star history by becoming the first African-American chief of any major league to preside over an MVP award presentation. He presented the award to Fred McGriff in lieu of the Commissioner of Baseball. This position was vacant and would not be filled until 1998 when Bud Selig, who had served as Chairman of the Executive Council since Fay Vincent's resignation in 1992, officially took the post.\nWEEK-TV transmitter difficulties.\nPeoria's NBC station WEEK-TV suffered misfortunes of significant transmitter difficulties throughout most of the game, forcing WEEK's signal to be knocked off the air until one hour after the conclusion.\nThe station would later air an abbreviated version of the game the following weekend due to its transmitter problems on NBC's live broadcast."

        "title": "Dave Meyers (basketball)",
        "text": "David William Meyers (April 21, 1953 – October 9, 2015) was an American basketball player who played for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The forward played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins. He was an All-American as a senior in 1975, when he won his second national championship with UCLA. He was drafted in the first round of the 1975 NBA draft with the second overall pick, and played four years professionally with the Bucks.\nEarly life.\nBorn in San Diego, California, Meyers was one of 11 children (six girls, five boys) of Bob and Pat Meyers. Bob was a standout basketball player at Marquette University and was the Warriors' captain in 1944–45. Meyers attended high school at Sonora High School in La Habra, California. As a senior, he averaged 22.7 points per game in leading the Raiders to the Orange League title and, in the postseason, the California Southern Section AA championship. Meyers was named AA Player of the Year.\nCollege career.\nAs a sophomore in 1972–73, Meyers played a backup role on the UCLA Bruins men's basketball team, averaging 4.9 points per game, sixth on the team, and 2.9 rebounds. UCLA won the Pac-8 title, went 30–0 and captured the 1973 NCAA championship with an 87–66 win over Memphis State. Meyers recorded four points and three rebounds in the championship game.\nAs a junior in 1973–74, Meyers became a starter on a front line with future Hall of Famers Bill Walton and Jamaal Wilkes. Meyers averaged 11.4 points and 5.7 rebounds.\nIn 1974–75, with Walton and Wilkes graduated, the Bruins reloaded and Meyers was the senior starter on a front line with two sophomores and future All-Americans Marques Johnson and Richard Washington. Meyers led the team in both scoring and rebounding with 18.3 points and 7.9 rebounds per game with a .484 field goal percentage. He won the John Wooden Award as UCLA's Most Valuable Player, and he was a consensus first-team All-American. The Bruins went 28–3 and won the NCAA championship in the 1975 NCAA Division I basketball tournament, the team's 10th in a 12-year span, with a 92–85 win over Kentucky. Meyers recorded 24 points and 11 rebounds in the championship game.\nMeyers appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1975 with the headline \"UCLA Still Best in the West.\" He was inducted into the Pac-12 Conference Hall of Honor in March 2015.\nNBA career.\nMeyers was the second overall pick in the 1975 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. Nineteen days later, Meyers, along with Elmore Smith, Junior Bridgeman, and Brian Winters, was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Walt Wesley.\nIn his rookie season of 1975–76 with the Bucks, Meyers played 72 games and averaged 22.1 minutes per game. He averaged 7.4 points, 6.2 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game. He posted a then career single-game high of 28 points in just his third NBA game, against the New Orleans Jazz.\nIn 1976–77, Meyers was limited to 52 games, but his playing time increased to over 25 minutes per game, while he averaged 9.7 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game, with a .467 field goal percentage. On April 10, 1977, he set a new personal best of 31 points against the San Antonio Spurs.\nIn 1977–78, his third season, Meyers came into his own as a starter and the Bucks, after two losing seasons, rebounded to a 44–38 record. Playing alongside his former UCLA teammate Marques Johnson, Meyers played 80 games and averaged over 30 minutes per game. Meyers posted a career-high 14.7 points per game along with 6.7 rebounds and a career-high 3.0 assists. On November 15, 1977, he upped his single-game scoring personal best to 32 points, against the Portland Trail Blazers.\nMeyers missed the 1978–79 season with a back injury.\nIn the 1979–80 season, he played 79 games and just under 28 minutes per game as the Bucks went 49–33 and won the NBA Midwest Division. Meyers averaged 12.1 points, 5.7 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game.\nAfter five NBA seasons, on April 30, 1980, Meyers made a surprise announcement that he was retiring from basketball to spend more time with his family and devote more time to his Jehovah's Witness faith.\nPersonal life.\nMeyers married his wife, Linda, in 1975. Their daughter Crystal was born a year later, and son Sean followed three years later. Meyers worked as a sales representative for Motorola and took night classes in education at National University. He received his teaching certificate and, beginning in 1988, for many years he served as an elementary school teacher at Railroad Canyon Elementary School in Lake Elsinore, California. He also served as a basketball instructor, both privately and at camps, primarily for children aged 8–12.\nMeyers died of cancer in Temecula, California, on October 9, 2015, at the age of 62.\nMeyers was the older brother of Ann Meyers, who was also an outstanding basketball player and the only woman to sign a free agent contract with an NBA team (Indiana Pacers in 1979)."

        "title": "List of boxing quadruple champions",
        "text": "A quadruple champion in boxing refers to a boxer who has won world titles in four different categories of weight.\nRecognition.\nMajor sanctioning bodies.\nThere is some dispute on which sanctioning body is considered \"major\" enough to award championships. The \"Big 4\" sanctioning bodies are always included. They are arranged in order of foundation:\n\"The Ring\".\nThe Ring, boxing's most respected magazine, has awarded world championships in professional boxing within each weight class from its foundation in 1922 until the 1990s, and again since 2001. \"The Ring\" champions were at one point held the linear reign to the throne, the man who beat the man. The lineal champion is also known as the true champion of the division. \"The Ring\" stopped giving belts to world champions in the 1990s but began again in 2002.\nIn 2002, \"The Ring\" attempted to clear up the confusion regarding world champions by creating a championship policy. It echoed many critics' arguments that the sanctioning bodies in charge of boxing championships had undermined the sport by pitting undeserving contenders against undeserving \"champions\", and forcing the boxing public to see mismatches for so-called \"world championships\". \"The Ring\" attempted to clear up the confusion regarding world champions by creating a championship policy that is \"intended to reward fighters who, by satisfying rigid criteria, can justify a claim as the true and only world champion in a given weight class.\" \"The Ring\" claims to be more authoritative and open than the sanctioning bodies' rankings, with a page devoted to full explanations for ranking changes. A fighter pays no sanctioning fees to defend or fight for the title at stake, contrary to practices of the sanctioning bodies. Furthermore, a fighter cannot be stripped of the title unless he loses, decides to move to a different weight division, or retires.\nThere are currently only two ways that a boxer can win \"The Ring\"'s title: defeat the reigning champion; or win a box-off between the magazine's number-one and number-two rated contenders (or, sometimes, number-one and number-three rated). A vacant \"Ring\" championship is filled when the number-one contender in a weight-division battles the number-two contender or the number-three contender (in cases where \"The Ring\" determines that the number-two and number-three contenders are close in abilities and records).\nIn May 2012, citing the number of vacancies in various weight classes as primary motivation, \"The Ring\" unveiled a new championship policy. Under the new policy, \"The Ring\" title can be awarded when the No. 1 and No. 2 fighters face one another or when the Nos. 1 and 2 contenders choose not to fight one another and either of them fights No. 3, No. 4 or No. 5, the winner may be awarded \"The Ring\" belt. In addition, there are now six ways for a fighter to lose his title: lose a fight in his championship weight class; move to another weight class; not schedule a fight in any weight class for 18 months; not schedule a fight in his championship weight class for 18 months, even if fighting at another weight class; not scheduling a fight with a top 5 contender in any weight class for two years; or retiring.\nMany media outlets and members are extremely critical of the new championship policy and state that if this new policy is followed \"The Ring\" title will lose the credibility it once held.\n\"Lineal\".\nThe Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB) hands out the official version of the lineal championship. TBRB awards vacant championships when the two top-ranked fighters in any division meet and currently recognizes legitimate world champions or \"true champions\" each weight classes. The Board was formed to continue where \"The Ring\" \"left off\" in the aftermath of its purchase by Golden Boy Promotions in 2007 and the following dismissal of Nigel Collins. After the new editors announced a controversial new championship policy in May 2012, three prominent members of the Ring Advisory Panel resigned. This three members (Springs Toledo, Cliff Rold and Tim Starks) became the founding members of the \"Transnational Boxing Rankings Board\", which was formed over the summer of 2012 with the assistance of Stewart Howe of England.\nSince 2012, lineal champions are predetermined by the \"Transnational Boxing Rankings Board\", which promotes the concept of a singular world champion per weight class. Lineal champions are listed on \"Cyber Boxing Zone\" website which list lineal champions of the \"Queensberry Era\" to date.\nMinor sanctioning bodies.\nThey are: International Boxing Organization (IBO), World Professional Boxing Federation (WPBF), International Boxing Association (IBA), International Boxing Council (IBC), International Boxing Board (IBB), International Boxing League (IBL), International Boxing Union (IBU), Global Boxing Association (GBA), Global Boxing Council (GBC), Global Boxing Federation GBF, Global Boxing Organization (GBO), Global Boxing Union (GBU), National Boxing Association (NBA), Transcontinental World Boxing Association (TWBA), Universal Boxing Association (UBA), Universal Boxing Council (UBC), Universal Boxing Federation (UBF), Universal Boxing Organization (UBO), UNIBOX, United States Boxing Council (USBC), World Athletic Association (WAA), World Boxing Board (WBB), World Boxing Championship Committee (WBCC), World Boxing Foundation (WBFo), World Boxing Institute (WBI), World Boxing League (WBL), World Boxing Network (WBN), World Boxing Union (WBU).\nNote:\nList of men's quadruple champions.\nThis list is credited for boxers who have won championships in boxing from major sanctioning bodies (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO), The Ring.\nWBA has four recognized world champions, \"Super\", \"Undisputed\", \"Unified\", and \"Regular\".

        "text": "Gregory Robert Warren (born October 18, 1981) is an American former football long snapper. He played college football for the North Carolina Tar Heels and was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers as an undrafted free agent in after the 2005 NFL Draft.\nWarren earned two Super Bowl rings with the Steelers in Super Bowl XL over the Seattle Seahawks and Super Bowl XLIII over the Arizona Cardinals.\nPersonal life.\nGreg Warren attended Southern Wayne High School in Dudley, North Carolina. He was a four-year letterman in football, a three-year letterman in track &amp; field, and a member of the National Honor Society. In football, he won All-Conference Honorable Mention honors as a senior; starting for two years at center and deep snapper. In track &amp; field, he was a three-time All-Conference Honorable Mention honoree. Warren is married to his wife Ashley Keesee Warren.\nCollege career.\nWarren attended the University of North Carolina, where he started his college football career as a walk-on long snapper in 2000. Warren earned the starting position in 2001, and continued as the starting long snapper for the team until his graduation after the 2004 season. While playing football at UNC, Warren: won the Peach Bowl as a freshman, was awarded a scholarship in 2003, and played in 49 consecutive games for the Tar Heels. Warren still holds the squat (500 lbs.), power clean (364 lbs.), and bench press (360 lbs.) records for specialists. Senior year, Warren served as team captain, and won the Athletic Director's Scholar-Athlete Award.\nAcademically, Warren double majored in biology, and exercise &amp; sports science. Prior to his NFL career, Warren had been pursuing a career in education, as evidenced by his tenure as a teaching assistant at East Chapel Hill High School.\nProfessional career.\nDuring his rookie season in 2005, Warren was used entirely as a long snapper, beating former Steelers center Mike Schneck for the job.\nA restricted free agent in the 2008 offseason, Warren signed a three-year, $2.3 million contract with the Steelers on March 25.\nWarren sustained a season ending knee injury in a game against the New York Giants on October 25, 2008. The importance of a competent long snapper became evident after Warren left the game: the substitute long snapper, James Harrison, sent a snap sailing over the punter's head and out the back of the end zone resulting in a safety. This tied the score and gave the Giants good field position on the ensuing kick resulting in the go ahead touchdown late in the game. He was placed on injured reserve later that week.\nOn December 21, 2009, Warren was placed on injured reserve with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), officially ending his 2009 season in week 14.\nOn October 23, 2016, Warren had his first career fumble recovery against the New England Patriots after Julian Edelman fumbled the ball while returning a punt by Jordan Berry.\nOn February 2, 2017, Warren re-signed with the Steelers on a one-year contract.\nOn May 18, 2017, Warren was released by the Steelers after 12 seasons due to a failed physical."

His professional career lasted from 1968 to 1975, and he played for the NBA champion New York Knicks in 1970.\nEarly life.\nDon May was born in Dayton, Ohio, one of seven children of Edward S. May and Stella (Streit) May, and attended Belmont High School, where he played alongside another future college All-American and NBA player, Bill Hosket. The two once combined for 88 points in one game (50 by Hosket, 38 by May). Belmont captured the 1964 Ohio state championship with ease, winning the state semifinal and final by 24 and 29 points, respectively. Coached by John Ross, the Bison went 26-1 (with the loss in overtime after both May and Hosket fouled out) and May and Hosket were the first teammates ever to be named first-team All-Ohio.\nCollege career.\nThe 6'4\" forward attended the hometown University of Dayton. As a sophomore in 1965–66, he averaged 20.3 points and 11.4 rebounds per game as the Flyers went 23-6 and advanced to the NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen.\nIn his junior year of 1966–67, May increased his averages to 22.2 points and 16.7 rebounds per game as the Flyers went 25-6 and May was named consensus second-team All-American. The Flyers advanced to the NCAA tournament Final Four where, led by May's 34 points and 15 rebounds, they upset fourth-ranked North Carolina 76–62. In the NCAA title game, the Flyers fell to UCLA and future hall-of-famer Lew Alcindor despite May's 21 points and 17 rebounds.\nAs a senior, May averaged 23.4 points and 15.0 rebounds per game as the Flyers went 21-9. He was MVP of the 1967–1968 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), in which Dayton defeated the University of Kansas and its star guard Jo Jo White in the title game. May was again a consensus second-team All-American.\nMay's 1,980 career points and 1,301 rebounds are both second in Dayton history.\nNBA career.\nMay was selected in the third round of the 1968 NBA draft by the New York Knicks as well as in the third round of the 1968 ABA Draft by the Indiana Pacers.

        "title": "Joe Cobb (baseball)",
        "text": "Joseph Stanley Cobb (January 24, 1895 – December 24, 1947), born Joseph Stanley Serafin, was an American baseball catcher. He played professional baseball for 12 years between 1917 and 1931, including one game in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers on April 25, 1918. He was the starting catcher and batted .320 for both the 1923 and 1924 Baltimore Orioles, teams that are ranked as the 19th and fifth best minor league team in baseball history.\nEarly years.\nCobb was born Joseph Stanley Serafin in Hudson, Pennsylvania, in 1895. Before playing professional baseball, he worked as a coal miner. He joked that his agility could be attributed to \"avoiding rampaging mules\" when working in the coal mines. He was five feet, nine inches tall, weighed 170 pounds and was a right-handed batter and fielder.\nProfessional baseball.\nMinor leagues.\nCobb began playing professional baseball in 1917 with the Cumberland club in the Blue Ridge League. He appeared in 19 games and compiled a .385 batting average and .538 slugging percentage in 65 at bats.\nDetroit Tigers.\nAfter playing only 19 minor league games but compiling a .385 average, Cobb joined the Detroit Tigers in January 1918. After observing Cobb in spring training, Detroit sports writer Harry Bullion wrote that Cobb displayed \"astonishing form\" throwing to the bases\" and was \"cool as the proverbial iceberg, ruffles at nothing, and is never caught making the wrong play.\" Bullion added that one of Cobb's strongest boosters was Ty Cobb, though the two were not relatives. On April 13, 1918, he had three hits in five at bats and scored two runs in an exhibition game against the Cincinnati Reds.\nCobb appeared in only one major league game, an 8-4 loss to the Cleveland Indians on April 25, 1918. Cobb was a pinch hitter for pitcher Rudy Kallio in the bottom of the eighth inning, and did not appear in the field. A discrepancy in baseball records exists; according to his career record, Cobb drew a base on balls in his only major league plate appearance to compile a 1.000 career on-base percentage. However, the contemporary published box score for the one major league game Cobb played shows him going 0-for-1, and the more recently compiled Baseball Reference box score shows Cobb striking out in his one at-bat.\nReturn to minors.\nAfter his brief stint with the Tigers, Cobb was assigned to the St. Paul Saints. He appeared in 11 games for the Saints. On May 15, 1918, Cobb passed his physical examination for the Army and was scheduled to report for duty on June 1, 1918. When Cobb reported to the Army, it was revealed that his real name was Joseph Stanley Serafin. As of mid-June 1918, Cobb was still playing baseball when he was returned to Detroit by St. Paul and then assigned to Syracuse. By late July 1918, Cobb was reported to be in the Army.\nIn 1919, he began the season with the San Antonio Aces in the Texas League. He broke his hand during a game with San Antonio and was released on May 1, 1919, to the Jersey City Skeeters to recuperate from his injury and then resume playing. He appeared in 100 games for Jersey City and compiled a .232 batting average.\nAfter the 1919 season Cobb played at the semi-pro level. He played during the 1920 season with the independent Carnegie Steel Company team in Farrell, Pennsylvania, also known as the Farrell Steel club. He returned to his home in Plains, Pennsylvania, in July 1920 after his wife suffered a severe injury. In 1921, he played for the Massillon Agathons.\nIn 1923, Cobb returned to the higher levels of the minor leagues. He began the season with the Jersey City Skeeters and, on June 3, 1923, he was sold to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. Cobb appeared in 83 games for the 1923 Orioles, hit .320 and totaled 72 runs, 80 RBIs, 215 total bases, 19 doubles, 12 triples and 15 home runs. He was the starting catcher for the 1923 Baltimore team that compiled a 111-53 record and is ranked as the 19th best minor league team in baseball history. After the Orioles won the 1923 pennant, The Sporting News wrote an article describing Joe Cobb's role on the team: \"[Manager] Dunn's first moves were to obtain catcher Joe Cobb from Jersey City . . . and to sign veteran pitcher Chief Bender. The addition of the peppy Cobb put new life in the Orioles.\"\nIn 1924, after a brief holdout, Cobb returned to the Orioles. The 1924 Orioles compiled a 117-48 record and are rated as the fifth best minor league team in baseball history. Cobb was named to the International League's 1924 all-star team and hit .320 with 84 RBIs and 75 runs. Cobb also had the distinction of catching for future Hall of Famer Lefty Grove, who had his breakout year with the 1924 Orioles, going 26-6.\nCobb continued to play in the high minor leagues for Baltimore through 1926 and then for the Jersey City Skeeters (1926-1927), Wichita Falls Spudders (1927-1928), and Fort Worth Panthers (1928), before slipping to Class B ball where he played from 1929 to 1931. In 1931, Cobb was player-manager of the Harrisburg Senators of the New York–Pennsylvania League. In 1932, he was hired as the manager of the Plains team in the Wyoming League.\nLater years.\nJoe Cobb died in 1947 at age 52 in Allentown, Pennsylvania."

        "title": "World Series of Poker bracelet",
        "text": "The World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a poker player can win. Since 1976, a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual WSOP. Even if the victory occurred before 1976, WSOP championships are now counted as \"bracelets\". During the first years of the WSOP, only a handful of bracelets were awarded each year. In 1990, there were only 14 bracelet events. By 2000, that number increased to 24. As the popularity of poker has increased during the 2000s, the number of events has likewise increased. In 2011, 58 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP, seven at the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE), and one to the WSOP National Circuit Champion. This brought the total number of bracelets awarded up to 959. Five additional bracelets were awarded for the first time in April 2013 at the inaugural World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific (WSOP APAC) in Melbourne, Australia. In 2017, 74 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP and an additional 11 will be awarded at the WSOPE in Czech Republic.\nAfter the conclusion of the 2014 WSOP APAC, there have been 1083 bracelets awarded, 500 of which were won by 170 players who have won at least two bracelets, with all of the other bracelets being won by one-time winners. This includes (up to this point) 22 Main Event winners with one bracelet: Hal Fowler, Bill Smith, Mansour Matloubi, Brad Daugherty, Russ Hamilton, Noel Furlong, Robert Varkonyi, Chris Moneymaker, Greg Raymer, Joe Hachem, Jamie Gold, Jerry Yang, Peter Eastgate, Pius Heinz, Ryan Riess, Martin Jacobson, Qui Nguyen, Scott Blumstein, John Cynn, Hossein Ensan, Damian Salas, and Koray Aldemir.\nBracelet description.\nThe 1976 bracelet looked \"like gold nuggets kind of hammered flat\". The bracelet in 1976 cost approximately $500. In the 1980s, Las Vegas jeweler Mordechai Yerushalmi became the exclusive manufacturer of WSOP bracelets until Harrah's Entertainment bought the rights to the WSOP in 2004. According to 2003 WSOP Champion Chris Moneymaker, the design of the bracelet remained relatively unchanged under Yerushalmi. In 2005, Gold and Diamond International based in Memphis, TN won the bid from Harrah's Entertainment to manufacture the 2005 World Series of Poker bracelets. The company also manufactures the WSOP circuit rings.\nIn 2006, Frederick Goldman, Inc. made the WSOP bracelets while luxury watch maker Corum introduced some commemorative watches as part of the prize package. In 2006, the Champion's bracelet had 259 stones including 7.2 carats (1.4 g) of diamonds, 120 grams of white and yellow gold. It also used rubies to represent the heart and diamond suits, a sapphire to represent the spade and three black diamonds to represent the clubs.\nIn 2007, Corum became the official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. Some of the 2007 World Series of Poker champions received both a watch and a bracelet from Corum. Corum designed four variations for the 2007 World Series of Poker Bracelets. The standard version that is presented to 53 winners features 53 diamonds. The Ladies World Champion receives a bracelet that is adorned with four black diamonds, two rubies and 87 blue sapphires. The $50,000 HORSE Champion Bracelet has 91 black diamonds and two rubies. The World Series of Poker Main Event Bracelet has 120 diamonds on 136 grams of 18-karat (75 percent) white gold. The value of the 2007 bracelets have not been released, but the typical price of a Corum watch ranges from $1,500–$30,000+.\nIn 2008, the Main Event Bracelet had 291 diamonds, totalling 2.81 carats set in 168 grams of 18-karat white gold. The other 54 event bracelets consisted of 55 diamonds, totalling 0.25 carats set in 80 grams of 14-karat yellow gold.\nIn 2010, an Australian-based company OnTilt Designs Pty Ltd won a multi-year contract to become the official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. OnTilt jewelers decided that the 2010 bracelet design would return to the tradition of the 1970s and 1980s where the bracelet was a heavy piece of unadorned metal. American jewelry designer Steve Soffa was chosen to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets. The goal was to create a bracelet that somebody would actually want to wear every day. In 2011, OnTilt has also been chosen to manufacture the WSOP Circuit rings.\nIn 2012, Jason Arasheben, famed jewelry designer and owner of Jason of Beverly Hills was chosen as the official bracelet manufacturer of the WSOP. Arasheben had designed the championship rings for the 2009 and 2010 Los Angeles Lakers and the 2011 Green Bay Packers, among others. The Main Event bracelet will feature each suit in the deck in either rubies or black diamonds. In terms of sheer mass, it weighs in at over 160 grams of 14 karat gold and over 35 carats of flawless diamonds.\nA special platinum bracelet was awarded at the 2012 WSOP to the winner of The Big One for One Drop, Antonio Esfandiari. The event was a $1 million buy-in tournament created as a fundraiser for the One Drop Foundation, a charity established by Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté.\nPrestige.\nAt first, the bracelets did not have much prestige. Ten-time bracelet winner Doyle Brunson said that his first bracelet \"didn't mean anything\" to him and that he did not even pick up two of them.\nSome professional poker players believe that there are two types of poker players: those who have won a bracelet and those who have not. Those who have belong to an exclusive club. \"It's impossible to overstate the value of a World Series of Poker gold bracelet to anyone who takes the game seriously,\" stated World Series of Poker Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack during the 2006 bracelet unveiling. \"It is the equivalent of winning the Stanley Cup in hockey or the Lombardi Trophy in American football.\"\nMany professional poker players desire the recognition that is associated with the bracelet. Former Celebrity Poker Showdown host and poker star Phil Gordon said, \"I want that bracelet more than anything.\" Freddy Deeb said that he did not appreciate his first bracelet because he did not recognize what it meant. He said his 2007 bracelet, however, \"means everything to me\". Jennifer Tilly says that winning her 2005 Women's Championship bracelet was \"better than an Oscar\".\nWhen the World Poker Tour decided to offer a prize to its event champions, they decided to present them with WPT Bracelets. In so doing, WPT Founder, President and CEO Steve Lipscomb said, \"The championship bracelet has become synonymous with poker as a symbol of achievement and respect, and we are honored to continue the tradition that Benny Binion [the founder of the WSOP] began over 30 years ago.\"\nHistory.\nBracelets have not always been awarded for winning events. In 1970, the first WSOP Champion received nothing but a silver cup and whatever cash they won during the event. From 1971 to 1974, according to Becky Behnen (the daughter of WSOP founder Benny Binion), the winner received an undescribed \"corny trophy\". In 1975, the winners received a sterling plate. The following year, 1976, the WSOP started the tradition of issuing bracelets to the event winners.\nIn 1980 and 1981, one did not have to win a WSOP event to win a gold bracelet. In 1980 and 1981, H.D. \"Oklahoma Johny\" Hale and Chip Reese received a gold bracelet for being the \"Best All Around Player\" at the WSOP, respectively. These bracelets, however, are not considered in the count of WSOP championship bracelets.\nIn 2007, Thomas Bihl became the first person to ever win a WSOP bracelet outside Las Vegas, Nevada. Bihl won the £2,500 World Championship H.O.R.S.E. at the World Series of Poker Europe in London, England. Days later, Annette Obrestad became the youngest player to ever win a WSOP bracelet at 18 years, 364 days, also becoming the first woman to win a World Series Main Event (WSOPE). Caesars Entertainment (known until 2010 as Harrah's Entertainment), the owner of the WSOP, considers the WSOP Europe bracelet to be the same in prestige as those awarded every year in Las Vegas.\nIn 2008, Jesper Hougaard became the first person to have won both a WSOP and WSOPE bracelet.\nIn 2011, a World Series of Poker bracelet was awarded for the first time to the WSOP Circuit National Championship winner in the 100-qualifier event from May 27–29. The following year, the Circuit National Championship moved to New Orleans, where it was held in 2013.\nStarting in 2013, bracelets are also awarded in Australia at the World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific, held at Crown Melbourne.\nBracelet legacy.\nOf the three top WSOP bracelet winners, only Johnny Chan still has them all. He keeps them locked in a vault because they are worth, according to him, \"millions\". Doyle Brunson did not pick up two of his. Seventeen-time bracelet winner Phil Hellmuth gave away ten of his. \"To me,\" Hellmuth said, \"the bracelets have always been a really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, because I knew that they represented history.\"\nThree-time WSOP Bracelet winner Hamid Dastmalchi and six-time winner Ted Forrest had been playing for four days non-stop at the Mirage when Hamid started to complain about the 1992 Main Event Championship Bracelet he received. Bitter about a dispute with the Binion's Horseshoe, the owners of the WSOP at the time, Hamid told the table that the Binion's \"say it's worth $5,000, but I'd take $1,500 for it.\" To which Forrest responded \"Sold\" and immediately tossed Hamid $1,500 in chips. Dastmalchi mailed Forrest his bracelet. Ted Forrest also reported that three of his five bracelets have been stolen over the years, and that he gave his daughter one.\nIn November 2010, Peter Eastgate put his main event bracelet up for auction on eBay with a starting bid of $16,000. It eventually sold for $147,500, and this money was donated to UNICEF.\nWSOP Circuit rings.\nIn 2005, the inaugural World Series of Poker Circuit was founded, hosting events at many of their casinos around the country. In order to differentiate these events and to ensure the prestige of the WSOP Bracelet, the circuit events present a ring to the winners.\nCircuit National Championship.\nFrom 2011, the WSOP awarded a bracelet to the winner of the WSOP Circuit National Championship. The Circuit Event National Championship was an invitation only event that used the standings of players from the various circuit events in determining who was invited.\nMultiple bracelet winners.\nThe top bracelet winners are as follows:\nThe bracelet leaders by decade are:\nJohnny Moss, with a win at the 1971 WSOP, became the first person to have won multiple lifetime WSOP \"bracelets\" (as mentioned above, the first actual bracelet was given in 1976).\nMoss also was the first person to win five lifetime WSOP bracelets, with a win at the 1975 WSOP.\nJohnny Chan, with a win in Event No. 25 at the 2005 World Series of Poker, became the first person to win 10 lifetime WSOP bracelets, just a few days before Doyle Brunson won his 10th bracelet in Event No. 31 of that same WSOP.\nThe first person to win two bracelets in the same WSOP was Johnny Moss at the 1971 WSOP.\nThe first person to win three bracelets in the same WSOP was Walter \"Puggy\" Pearson, at the 1973 WSOP. As of the start of the 2023 WSOP, only six players have won three bracelets in a single WSOP.\nBill Boyd, Doyle Brunson and Loren Klein are the only players to have won bracelets in four consecutive years (Boyd from 1971 to 1974, Brunson from 1976 to 1979 and Klein from 2016 to 2019).\nAs of the completion of the 2023 World Series of Poker, with his wins in the 2016 World Series of Poker in the 2-7 No Limit Draw Lowball Championship and H.O.R.S.E. Championship, Jason Mercier is the only player to win multiple events in the same World Series of Poker with a buy-in of at least $10,000."

        "title": "Terry Ryan (ice hockey, born 1977)",
        "text": "Terrence William James Ryan (born January 14, 1977) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player and actor. He was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens eighth overall in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft and played eight games with the organization between 1996 and 1999.\nEarly life.\nRaised in Mount Pearl, Newfoundland, Ryan started playing sports at an early age. His father, Terry Ryan Sr., played for the Hamilton Red Wings in the OHA before venturing on his own hockey quest that would see him play five years of pro hockey highlighted by a year in the World Hockey Association with the Minnesota Fighting Saints.\nWhen the younger Ryan was 10, his second cousin Michelle Meger was killed in Edmonton by a drunk driver. Meger was in her early twenties when she died. The families were so close that Ryan stayed with her parents in Edmonton when he was drafted to the NHL. He continues to advocate against drunk driving.\nAs a youth, Ryan played in the 1990 and 1991 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Mount Pearl.\nIn 1991, at 14 years of age, Ryan was invited to play Junior “A” hockey for the Quesnel Millionaires in BC for two years, where he won the Top Scorer Award and was selected as a member of the Rocky Mountain League All Star Team.\nPlaying career.\nRyan was the third-overall draft pick in the major junior Western Hockey League bantam draft, by the Tri-City Americans. Ryan was named the Western Hockey League Rookie of the Year in ’93 and Most Improved Player in ‘94. The following year, he won the WHL's Plus-Minus Award, was named Most Spirited Player, and claimed the fourth overall ranking in league scoring (50 goals, 60 assists).\nRyan was selected eighth overall by the Montreal Canadiens, in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. His hockey career continued with the Fredericton Canadiens where he was named Rookie of the Year in 1998, claimed second in goals (21) and led the league in fights (34).\nDespite his high draft ranking, Ryan played only 8 games in the NHL over parts of three seasons, all spent with Montreal, failing to register a single point and suffering a career-ending ankle injury in 2001, ending his chances at returning to the big leagues. Due to such a short NHL career, Ryan is often considered a draft bust. The majority of his career was spent in the minor professional hockey leagues. He signed in St John's in 1999–2000 to play for his hometown Maple Leafs, but was never signed by Toronto themselves due to a contractual conflict with the Canadiens. In 2000, Ryan won the St. John's Maple Leafs Humanitarian of the Year Award; in 2003 he led the Orlando Seals with playoff goals (6) to help them win the league championship.\nOn January 14, 2024, his 47th birthday, Ryan signed a contract with the Newfoundland Growlers of the ECHL. Due to a shortened roster, Ryan would play for the team later that same day, his first game of professional hockey in over 20 years. He recorded 7 penalty minutes after instigating a fight with Zach Walker, in a 6–2 loss against the Adirondack Thunder. \nBall hockey career.\nIn 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 Ryan represented Canada at the ISBHF ball hockey tournament in Switzerland, Pittsburgh, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Canada respectively. He led the team to a gold medal in ’03 and ’07, won a silver in 2011, and won a bronze medal representing Canada again at the 2013 Worlds in St John’s, NL, his hometown. In 2011 in Bratislava, Slovakia, Ryan was Canada’s leading scorer. He also has two national ball hockey championships to his credit (Montreal Black Knights, 2008, and Newfoundland Black Horse, 2010). In 2016, he reached the provincial ball hockey championship finals. In 2018, his team, Colonial Auto Parts from St. John’s, won the 2018 Canadian men’s masters championship, and his other team, Black Horse, took silver in the national ball hockey championships in the senior men’s A competition.\nLater life.\nRyan has played Newfoundland senior hockey with the St. John’s Capitals and the Clarenville Caribous, who lost the 2014 Allan Cup final to the Dundas Real McCoys in overtime. He played with his hometown Mount Pearl Blades for two seasons, missing the playoffs both years. In 2006 he was named Top Scorer for the Avalon East League and the Newfoundland Provincial League; in 2007 he claimed the title of MVP and Avalon East Top Scorer. In 2008, he played with the Bentley Generals of the Alberta Senior Hockey League, winning a silver medal at the Allan Cup, and was named Top Scorer. Ryan is an avid baseball player in the summers, suiting up for the Mount Pearl Knights of the St John's men's baseball league. He also swims laps at the local swimming hole behind Agnes Pratt Mercy Home in Rennies River.\nRyan works in the film industry and has appeared on several episodes of the hit CBC television program \"Republic of Doyle\", playing small roles. He has also played himself in the OLN's \"Road Hockey Rumble\", and played Zombie #22 in Zack Snyder's \"Dawn of the Dead\" (2004). In addition to playing \"British Soldier #1\" (Episode 1) - (the first on-screen casualty in the Netflix/Discovery Channel television series \"Frontier\", starring Jason Momoa in the lead role), in 2017 Ryan also had small roles in \"Frontier Season 2\", \"Little Dog (CBC)\", \"Caught (CBC)\", \"Schitt's Creek\", and various short films. He wrote and played the lead role in a short film called \"A Stand In\" due in 2018. He has made multiple appearances on the hockey podcast Spittin' Chiclets and most recently appeared in the eighth season of the Crave/Hulu show \"Letterkenny\" as a hockey player whose Newfie chirps annoyed the native team bench. He has a regular role in the \"Letterkenny\" spinoff \"Shoresy\".\nRyan, who has a bachelor of arts degree (Folklore/English), released his first book, \"Tales of a First Round Nothing,\" in May 2014, which was well-received by critics. He is now also trying his hand at stand-up comedy and performed his second show to good reviews opening for Gerry Dee at the General Motors Centre in Oshawa, Ontario on April 22, 2016.\nIn 2017 and 2021, Ryan unsuccessfully ran for city council in Mount Pearl."

        "title": "Cricket in Wales",
        "text": "Cricket is a popular sport in Wales; it started in the late 18th century, and has been played in Wales ever since. All cricket within Wales is regulated by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), making it effectively part of the English cricket system. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is Wales' only first-class county team, and Welsh players are eligible to represent England as Wales does not currently have its own Test cricket team or cricket body. Cricket is played within the Welsh schools system, and is considered one of the country's main summer sports.\nHistory.\nCricket, as a sport, has its origins in England, with its first known set of rules written in 1744. The earliest definite reference to cricket in Wales is in 1763, when it was played at Pembroke. The first recorded match was played at Llanegwad in Carmarthenshire. The first club to be mentioned is Swansea, in 1785. By around 1800, matches were also being played in the north, specifically in Holywell; there are records of further matches in the Hanmer area in the 1820s.\nWith the development of the railways and better transport links, the game of cricket began to spread slowly across Wales and by the 1830s the first interclub fixtures were regularly played. On 5 May 1845, Cardiff Cricket Club was inaugurated, and after three years using the rented field at Longcross, now the location of the Cardiff Royal Infirmary, the team became associated with the Cardiff Arms Park. Both the Arms Park and St. Helen's, in Swansea, were cricket venues before they became associated with rugby union. By 1850 cricket had become a popular activity in many schools, and this in turn helped cricket to be adopted as a working-class sport rather than one associated with the gentry as it was in England.\n1859 saw the first match between select English and Welsh teams, when the All England XI played a South Wales XXII. The South Wales team were victorious and this led to the first attempt to form a first-class team in Wales. Although county teams were later formed, most were short lived; but in 1888 Glamorgan County Cricket Club was formed, which would become the most important first-class team in Wales. Glamorgan entered the Minor Counties Cricket Championship in 1897 and was joined by other county teams from Wales: Carmarthenshire, Monmouthshire and Denbighshire. In 1921 Glamorgan became the first county team to gain first-class status, and was the 17th member of the County Championship.\nFrom its earliest days Glamorgan refused to designate a county headquarters, playing its matches at both St. Helen's in Swansea and Sophia Gardens in Cardiff, to try to remain neutral between the two main cities of the county. In 1975, St. Helen's Ground in Swansea held the first international game to be played outside the usual Test venues of England, hosting a One-day International between England and New Zealand.\nDomestic competitions.\nIn men's cricket, Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. They also play in the Royal London One-Day Cup and the T20 Blast. Wales National County Cricket Club also play in the English National Counties competitions, for county teams that do not have first-class status.\nIn women's cricket, Wales currently play in the Women's Twenty20 Cup, and previously competed in the Women's County Championship. Within the regional domestic structure, Wales is represented by the Western Storm regional hub.\nWelsh Fire represent Wales in both the men's and women's competitions of The Hundred.\nTwo Welsh cricket leagues have received ECB accreditation: the North Wales Premier Cricket League and the South Wales Cricket League.\nCricket grounds.\nGlamorgan play at the following grounds: Penrhyn Avenue in Colwyn Bay, St. Helen's in Swansea, The Gnoll Cricket Ground in Neath and Sophia Gardens in Cardiff.\nOn 8 July 2009 Sophia Gardens held its first Test match, when it hosted the first match of the 2009 Ashes Series. The game ended in a draw.\nGoverning body.\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is the governing body of cricket in England and Wales. It was created on 1 January 1997 combining the roles of the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), the National Cricket Association (NCA) and the Cricket Council. They are full members of the International Cricket Council.\nCricket Wales is the governing body of cricket in Wales. It is an umbrella partnership body comprising the Welsh Cricket Association, Glamorgan Cricket, Wales National County Cricket Club, the Welsh Schools Cricket Association and Sport Wales.\nProposed national team.\nWelsh men's and women's cricket teams have played matches on a number of occasions. Generally however, Wales do not field a team in international competition, with players instead playing for England.\nRecently there have been calls for Wales to be represented by its own national team, as in other sports, similar to Scotland. The only Welsh cricketer to captain England on a major tour abroad was Tony Lewis in 1972–73.\nNotable Welsh cricketers.\nThe following Welsh people have played Test cricket for England:\nPopularity.\nCricket has struggled for national attention in Wales, whereas Cricket is said to be the national sport of England, Rugby Union holds that distinction in Wales, and the lack of a regular national team has also meant that cricket has a harder time capturing the public imagination in the way that the Welsh national rugby union team and football teams have. Historically, cricket has also had to complete with Welsh Baseball as a summer sport especially in Cardiff and Newport. Despite these issues both Glamorgan and international matches continue to attract significant support."

        "title": "Pusher (tennis)",
        "text": "In tennis, a pusher is a defensive player who \"pushes\" back any shot they can chase down, without deliberately hitting a winner. They can angle shots, aim deep, as well as produce effective lobs. Pushers are quick and consistent, rarely making errors. This style of play, similar to a \"human backboard\", often tires and frustrates more offensive opponents. They will try to win games by eliciting unforced errors from the opponent, i.e. by waiting for them to make the first mistake and losing the point. Pushers often to \"dink\" balls back with side-spin or backspin, placing their shots at disadvantageous locations for their opponents. \nCounter-strategies.\nPlaying pushers, especially in the lower levels of competition, can be difficult for players unaccustomed to their style. However, there are several counter-strategies players use to defeat pushers.\nPlaying the net.\nBringing pushers to the net is a good way to move them out of their comfort zones. Players use drop shots or chip and charge tactics to accomplish this. Volleying from the net can also be effective against pushers. Hitting the ball at the net cuts down on the time that the ball takes to reach other side, making it harder for the pushers to run down the ball. Even if they do reach it, chances are that their return shot will be an easy put-away. Varying the placements of volleys, so they do not become predictable, is also a good tactic.\nMental approach.\nPlayers should try to never let the pusher see them being frustrated. Pushers play with the mentality that, \"It's a lot more frustrating to make a mistake than to have an opponent hit a brilliant shot that no one could have gotten.\" A pusher's mental game is key to his or her success, and an opponent who is obviously tired and angry will make the pusher more confident. Players should try to stay calm and focused to outlast and beat pushers.\nTimed aggression.\nEmploying timed aggression is another viable approach. Since pushers tend to hit few winners and lack proficient passing shots, opponents can bide their time, waiting for the opportune moment to launch an attack. Exhibiting aggression when faced with a second serve is particularly effective, as it may represent the only instance during the rally where the pusher hits a shorter ball. Given that many of the pusher's shots possess deep trajectory, backspin, or limited pace, opponents recognize the importance of swiftly moving towards the ball. The pusher seeks to exploit any laziness in shot approach, and reaching the ball early enables players to strike balls on the rise, generating additional pace and rendering the return more challenging. \nPushers' weaknesses.\nHitting a moonball to a pusher's backhand side will often force them to hit a lob, allowing a relatively leisurely overhead to end the point. In some cases, players may be able to outlast the pusher by hitting several cross-court strokes and waiting for the pusher to hit a ball that can be volleyed away. If a player does not put a lot of topspin on their shots, their opponent may well try to control the center court. This forces the pusher to go for deeper and more angled shots, which are harder to hit without topspin."

        "text": "Paul J. Oliver (March 30, 1984 – September 24, 2013) was an American football safety of the National Football League (NFL) who was selected in the fourth round of the 2007 Supplemental NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers. He was also briefly a member of the New Orleans Saints.\nEarly years.\nOliver was heavily recruited as a \"Parade\" High School All-American for the Harrison High School Hoyas. He was also ranked as the #1 cornerback by Rivals.com in 2003, and at 185 pounds timed unofficially with a 4.32 second 40-yard dash and a 37-inch vertical jump.\nCollege career.\nOliver decided to stay close to home and committed to playing college football at the University of Georgia. After redshirting for a year, Oliver developed into a key reserve in his first two years playing, earning him preseason third-team All-SEC honors before his 3rd year. Oliver, thrust into a starting role broke out as one of the best corners in the SEC his junior year. In his first game as a starter, filling in for the injured DeMario Minter, Oliver shut down University of Florida star Chad Jackson, holding him to only 2 catches for 22 yards. Oliver was awarded with Georgia's Most Improved Defensive Player Award after the 2005 season.\nOliver had his best game as a Bulldog on November 25, 2006, against Georgia Tech shutting down the 2nd overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, Calvin Johnson, though not without some help from Georgia Tech quarterback Reggie Ball. Oliver, whose primary role was to contain Johnson, ended up frustrating the All-American by holding him to only 13 yards and 2 receptions, batting away 3 balls intended for Johnson and intercepting another. Reggie Ball threw the pass into heavy traffic on the Yellow Jackets final drive and Oliver came up with the interception sealing a 15-12 Bulldog victory. Oliver finished the day with 4 solo tackles, 3 of which were on third down plays in the red zone, and also forced a fumble. Oliver ended his three-season career at Georgia with 7 interceptions, 8 deflected passes, 94 tackles (74 solo), 8.5 tackles for loss, 3 sacks, 5 forced fumbles, and 2 recovered fumbles.\nEarly departure.\nOliver was ruled academically ineligible on May 17, 2007, and decided to apply for the 2007 supplemental draft held 2 months later on July 12, 2007. Oliver, who tested well in the Wonderlic Test, was seen as a player who lacked the motivation to succeed in school rather than not having the aptitude or intelligence.\nProfessional career.\n2007 Supplemental Draft.\nDespite not having as much time to train as other prospects who go through the normal draft process, Oliver was able to garner enough interest to be the consensus #1 player in the supplemental draft. The San Diego Chargers ended up bidding their 2008 4th rounder for the rights to select Oliver making him the first of only two players selected in 2007's supplemental draft. The other player was Maryland tackle Jared Gaither selected by the Baltimore Ravens one round after Oliver.\nIn a statement concerning Oliver, Chargers General Manager, A. J. Smith said, \"We had the opportunity to get a good football player today, and we took it. Paul Oliver is a very competitive, aggressive, confident player. He's not cautious about anything he does on the field. You know how we like depth. We'll add Paul to the mix as a Charger and time will tell.\"\nDespite timing poorly at his 2007 Pro Day, Oliver displayed good footwork and also did well in cornerback drills.\nNFL career.\nOliver played for the Chargers from 2007 to 2010. He then became a free agent and signed with the Saints, but was released after being injured during training camp. On September 21, 2011, Oliver returned to the Chargers for the 2011 season.\nDeath.\nOliver died by suicide from a self-inflicted gunshot on September 24, 2013. He is survived by his wife, the former Chelsea Young, and two children. Police on the incident state that Oliver shot himself in front of his wife and his two young boys. \nIt was later determined through analysis of Oliver's brain that he suffered from an advanced form of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, caused by repeated hits to the head he endured during his football playing career. He is one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with this disease."

Under Rule 7.01 of Major League Baseball's (MLB) Official Rules, a runner acquires the right to an unoccupied base when he touches it before he is out. Stolen bases were more common in baseball's dead-ball era, when teams relied more on stolen bases and hit and run plays than on home runs.\nRickey Henderson holds the MLB career stolen base record with 1,406. He is the only MLB player to have reached the 1,000 stolen bases milestone in his career. Following Henderson is Lou Brock with 938 stolen bases; Billy Hamilton is third on the all-time steals listing. The number of career steals attributed to Hamilton varies by source, but all sources hold his career steals placing him in third on the list before Ty Cobb (897), Tim Raines (808), Vince Coleman (752), Arlie Latham (742), Eddie Collins (741), Max Carey (738), and Honus Wagner (723), who are the only other players to have stolen at least 700 bases. Coleman is the leader for retired players that are not members of the Hall of Fame.Brock held the all-time career stolen bases before being surpassed by Henderson in 1991. Brock had held the record from 1977 to 1991. Before Brock, Hamilton held the record for eighty-one years, from 1897 to 1977. Before that, Latham held the record from 1887 to 1896. Latham was also the first player to collect 300 career stolen bases. With Kenny Lofton's retirement in 2007, 2008 was the first season since 1967 in which no active player had more than 500 career stolen bases. Between 2008 and 2010, no active player had more than 500 stolen bases until Juan Pierre collected his 500th stolen base on August 5, 2010. He was the leader in stolen bases for active players until his retirement at the end of the 2013 season."

The others are Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales.\nThe Commonwealth Games is the only major multi-sport event in which and teams compete as England, organised by Commonwealth Games England; at Olympic, Paralympic and European Games England participates as part of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, (along with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, 10 of the 13 British Overseas Territories and the three Crown Dependencies) through the British Olympic Association.\nGames summary.\nCommonwealth Games.\nAfter the 2022 Commonwealth Games, England was second in the All-time tally of medals, with an overall total of 2322 medals (773 Gold, 783 Silver and 766 Bronze). Australia has been the highest scoring team for fourteen games, England for seven and Canada for one.\nHost nation.\nEngland has hosted the Games thrice: \nCommonwealth Games England.\nCommonwealth Games England (CGE) is the organisation responsible for all matters relating to the Commonwealth Games in England. Membership of the Games Council consists of representatives of 26 sports in the Commonwealth Games programme from which the host city selects up to 17 sports for each Games. The officers are elected by the council and hold office for 4 years, their work will be supported by four salaried staff. The current president is Dame Kelly Holmes, who won her first international Gold medal at the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Victoria, Canada.\nCGE is a member of the Commonwealth Games Federation who have overall responsibility for the direction and control of the Commonwealth Games.\nHow it helps English competitors.\nSince 1994, the costs of the preparation of Team England have been supported with funding from Sport England, a public body that distributes public and lottery funds. This has enabled CGE to run extensive management, training and educational programmes, ensuring that competitors and officials alike are fully prepared to meet the challenges ahead.\nFunds.\nThe raising of funds for the team's participation in the Games themselves is the sole responsibility of CGE and is raised through sponsorship and fund-raising activities. Donations from commerce and industry as well as the general public towards the team's costs are always most gratefully received. Without this ongoing support Team England would not be able to participate in the Games.\nTeam symbols.\nBrand identity.\nIn the run-up to the 2010 Commonwealth Games, CGE adopted a new logo and brand identity. The new logo features a single red English lion which represents strength, power and performance. The team strapline is \"We are England\".\nFlag and victory anthem.\nTeam England uses the Cross of St George as its flag at the Commonwealth Games. This flag is common for all sporting teams that represent England as an entity distinct from the United Kingdom.\nSince 2010 onwards, Team England have used the hymn \"Jerusalem\" as their victory anthem. This replaced \"Land of Hope and Glory\" which was used at previous games. In April 2010, Commonwealth Games England conducted a poll of members of the public which would decide the anthem for the 2010 Games. The three options were \"God Save The Queen\", \"Jerusalem\" and \"Land of Hope and Glory\" with \"Jerusalem\" being the clear winner securing 52% of the vote."

        "title": "Big-eared climbing rat",
        "text": "The big-eared climbing rat (Ototylomys phyllotis) is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae. It is found in Central America from Mexico to Costa Rica.\nDescription.\nThe big-eared climbing rat is in the order Rodentia and in the family Cricetidae and is most widely distributed species in the genus \"Ototylomys\". A second species of the genus was described in 2017 from the Mexican state of Chiapas. The genus dates back 3.35 Mya, prior to the Great American Biotic Interchange and Its initial occurrence was near Honduras and El Salvador.\n\"Ototylomys\" is Greek for \"otus\" (ear), \"tylos\" (knob, knot, swelling), and \"mus\" (mouse), which describes the animals large ears and shelf-like skull.\nThe big-eared climbing rat is a slender rat with two colors; dark on top of its body and light below. Its eyes and ears are large. It has large naked ears and a long naked tail with scales. Its size and color varies depending on where it lives geographically but most populations have a creamy white underbelly except for those in Mexico and Guatemala, which have a slate-colored underbelly. The skull is flat on top and has a prominent interparietal bone and supraorbital ridges There is no sexual dimorphism in this species.\nPhylogeny.\nThe genus \"Ototylomys\" is most closely related to \"Tylomys\". They both are known as climbing rats that are endemic to Central America. They both have flattened braincases, elongated skulls, highly developed supraorbital ridges and incisive foramina. They also have similar reproductive glands. They differ in many traits some being that \"Ototylomys\" are smaller with larger ears. They also have a larger auditory bullae, their rostrum is narrower, and their baculum is longer and narrower compared to its size.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThis species ranges from Mexico to Costa Rica.\nDiet.\nThe diet of the big-eared climbing rat is still incomplete but it mostly consists of fruit and leaves. We know their dietary needs are very not well known because the big-eared climbing rats that have been successfully housed in laboratories often have their tails fall off due to malnutrition.\nBehavior.\nBig-eared climbing rats are arboreal and nocturnal and they are seen both on the ground and in the trees. Their copulatory behavior is peculiar in that there is a copulatory lock.\nPhysiology.\nThere does not seem to be a regular estrous cycle. The gestation length of the big-eared climbing rat is 52 days. Delayed implantation may occur in this species. The females exhibit post-partum estrus and the litter size may vary from 1-4.\nFrom birth, newborns have been observed to be very advanced for their age. They chased their mothers almost from birth and by day 2 they are already 50% of the adults body length and respond to loud noises. By day 6 they open their eyes and they cling to their mothers teats for 30 days. Timing of sexual maternity varies within this species.\nThe big-eared climbing rat has been a subject of study due to a disease caused by \"Leishmania mexicana\". This is an intracellular parasite that infects these rodents and makes them a good model choice for further research on this topic."

        "title": "1995 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 1995 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 66th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 11, 1995, at The Ballpark in Arlington in Arlington, Texas, the home of the Texas Rangers of the American League. It was the first All-Star Game held in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, but not the first hosted by the franchise (as the Washington Senators, the team hosted the game in 1962 and 1969).\nIn this All-Star Game, American League pitchers held National League batters to just three base hits, but all three were home runs. The game resulted in the National League defeating the American League 3–2. This is also the most recent All-Star Game to be televised by the ABC television network.\nBecause of the MLBPA Strike, and the lack of official champions, the leagues chose to designate the managers of the unofficial league champions (teams with the best record at the time of abandonment of the season) as managers for this All-Star Game. The All-Star break that season was actually only two days - because of the strike induced schedule in 1995, there were games scheduled for the next day. As a result, by the time this game ended, several players had already flown out of Texas to get to where their teams were playing the next day.\nThere were two color guards participating in the pregame ceremonies. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police National Color Guard from Ottawa, Ontario, carried the Canadian flag, while the 1995-96 Del Rio (TX) High School ROTC Color Guard carried the American flag. Country singer Michelle Wright later sang \"O Canada\", while fellow country singer (and native Texan) Lyle Lovett sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Nolan Ryan threw out the ceremonial first pitch.\nNational League President Len Coleman presented Jeff Conine with the All-Star Game MVP Award in lieu of the Commissioner of Baseball, marking the second year in a row that Coleman presided over the MVP Award presentation.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nBroadcasting.\nThe 1995 All-Star Game was the first Major League Baseball All-Star Game to be televised by ABC since the 1988 edition from Cincinnati. Just like in 1988, Al Michaels provided play-by-play duties for ABC alongside color commentators Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver. Also assisting in ABC's coverage were John Saunders (who interviewed players in the American League dugout), Lesley Visser (who interviewed players in the National League dugout as well as game MVP Jeff Conine), and Rick Dempsey (who interviewed players inside the bullpen at the Ballpark in Arlington).\nThe 1995 All-Star Game officially launched the second season for The Baseball Network, which was a consortium that ABC was in partnership with Major League Baseball as well as NBC. As previously alluded to, the inaugural season in 1994 was cut short due to a players' strike that began on August 12 and wound up causing the World Series (for which ABC was due to broadcast) to be cancelled. The strike proved to hurt the long term viability of The Baseball Network. The arraignment between Major League Baseball, ABC, and NBC was originally supposed to run at least through the 1999 season. But instead, both networks announced on June 22, 1995, that they would be dissolving The Baseball Network after that year's World Series."

        "text": "Daniel Murphy Connor (born November 2, 1985) is an American football coach and a former linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Carolina Panthers, Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants. He played college football at Penn State University, where he is currently a defensive analyst.\nEarly years.\nConnor was born in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. He attended Strath Haven High School, where he was a four-year starter and was rated the number one linebacker in the country. He was also named to the \"USA Today\" Top 25 Supreme Team. He played in the 2004 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.\nAs a junior, he rushed for over 1,500 yards and scored 29 touchdowns. On defense, he had more than 160 tackles to go along with 3 interceptions. As a senior, he rushed 231 times for 1,807 yards and 28 touchdowns, while making 141 tackles, 11 sacks and 3 interceptions.\nConnor started in 59 straight games and helped the team achieve a 56–3 record. He finished his high school career with 461 tackles, 38 sacks, 19 interceptions, 591 carries for 4,556 yards and 77 rushing touchdowns. He also practiced basketball and track.\nCollege career.\nConnor attended Pennsylvania State University, where he played for coach Joe Paterno's Penn State Nittany Lions football team from 2004 to 2007. He earned All-America honors his junior and senior seasons at Penn State and passed Nittany Lion great Paul Posluszny on November 3, 2007, to become first on Penn State's career tackles list.\nConnor's game-high nine tackles along with an interception of a Colt Brennan pass in the 2008 Senior Bowl earned him the game's Under Armour Award—essentially the North team's MVP.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nConnor's superlative college career led to his #23 ranking on \"Sports Illustrated\"'s list of the top 25 2008 NFL Draft candidates. He left the NFL Combine after getting sick. He ran a 4.63 40-yard dash at his Pro Day. He also bench pressed 225 lbs 22 times and jumped 35\" vertically.\nCarolina Panthers (first stint).\nConnor was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the third round (74th overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft. Due to the Panthers' wealth of talent at linebacker, Connor played sparingly—mostly on special teams—in the first 3 weeks before a torn ACL suffered during a loss to the Minnesota Vikings ended his season. On September 23, he was placed on the injured reserve list. He had 4 special teams tackles.\nIn 2009, he played mainly on special teams, collecting 14 special teams tackles (led the team), 19 defensive tackles, one quarterback pressure and one fumble recovery.\nIn 2010, despite reportedly fielding several trade inquiries during the offseason, the Panthers made it clear Connor would compete for a starting job that season after the team released veteran linebacker Na'il Diggs. He competed for the strongside linebacker position with James Anderson, before he was named the starter at middle linebacker after Jon Beason was moved to weakside linebacker. On November 9, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a fractured hip bone and Beason was moved back to middle linebacker. Connor finished with 60 tackles, one sack, 4 quarterback pressures and one pass defensed.\nIn 2011, he took over the middle linebacker starter position in the second game after Beason was lost for the year with a torn left Achilles tendon. He was inactive with a shoulder injury against the Detroit Lions. He registered 87 tackles (third on the team), one forced fumble and 3 special teams tackles.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn March 15, 2012, he was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys to play inside linebacker in the team's 3-4 defense and reuniting him with former Penn State teammate Sean Lee. He became a starter after Lee was lost for the year with a toe injury in the sixth game against the Carolina Panthers. He missed 2 games with a neck injury and was replaced with Ernie Sims. He appeared in 14 games (8 starts), making 58 tackles (3 for loss) and one pass defensed.\nOn March 11, 2013, Connor was released by the Cowboys.\nNew York Giants.\nOn March 16, 2013, Connor signed with the New York Giants. On September 12, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a neck injury and Mark Herzlich replaced him as the starter at middle linebacker. On November 4, he was released with an injury settlement.\nCarolina Panthers (second stint).\nOn November 13, 2013, he signed an undisclosed one-year deal to return to the Carolina Panthers. He appeared in 5 games as a backup and was not re-signed after the season.\nCoaching career.\nIn September 2014, Connor was hired as linebacker coach at West Chester University under Bill Zwaan.\nIn January 2016, Connor accepted the head coaching position at Archbishop John Carroll High School in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In January 2018, Connor became the defensive coordinator at Widener University.\nIn February 2022, Connor joined the staff at his alma mater, Penn State as a defensive analyst."

        "title": "Major League Baseball on the radio",
        "text": "Major League Baseball on the radio has been a tradition for over 100 years, and still exists today. Baseball was one of the first sports to be broadcast in the United States. Every team in Major League Baseball has a flagship station, and baseball is also broadcast on national radio.\nHistory.\nEarly period.\n1920s.\nThe first baseball game ever broadcast on radio was a Pittsburgh Pirates versus Philadelphia Phillies game on August 5, 1921. The game was broadcast by KDKA of Pittsburgh, and the Pirates defeated the Phillies 8-5. It was broadcast by KDKA staff announcer Harold Arlin. That year, KDKA and WJZ of Newark broadcast the first World Series on the radio, between the New York Giants and the New York Yankees, with Grantland Rice and Tommy Cowan calling the games for KDKA and WJZ, respectively. However, the broadcasters were not actually present at the game, but simply gave reports from a telegraph wire. In 1922, WJZ broadcast the entire series, with Rice doing play-by-play. For the 1923 World Series, Rice was joined on Westinghouse for the first time by Graham McNamee.\nDuring the 1923 World Series, Rice was the main broadcaster, but during the fourth inning of Game 3, he turned the microphone over to McNamee. This was the start of McNamee's career, and McNamee became the first color commentator. Although frequently criticized for his lack of expertise, McNamee helped popularize baseball. \nBy 1924-1925, baseball broadcasts were occurring sporadically in other cities. For example, in Chicago in early October 1924, station WGN (AM) broadcast a \"city series\" between the White Sox and the Cubs. WGN also broadcast the Chicago Cubs' home opener in April 1925. And in Boston, WBZ (AM) broadcast the opening day game for the Boston Braves, who played against the New York Giants. Newspapers said this was the first time either Boston team (the Braves or the Red Sox) had been on the air. Throughout the rest of the 1925 season, Boston station WNAC broadcast some of the Braves' home games. The Boston Red Sox, however, did not get on the air in Boston until 1926, also on WNAC, beginning with the opening day game against the Yankees. \nMeanwhile, the establishment of the National Broadcasting Company (later known as NBC) and the Columbia Broadcasting System (later called CBS) meant that by October 1927, two coast-to-coast networks were able to broadcast the World Series for the first time. Graham McNamee was chosen to announce the games for NBC and Major J. Andrew White was the announcer for CBS. In that first year, the commissioner of baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, gave permission for both networks to air the games. \n1930s.\nMany owners were still wary. By the 1930s, the two-team cities of Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Chicago had reached an agreement not to broadcast away games. In other words, if the Boston Braves were at home, listeners could hear that game on the radio, but could not listen to the Boston Red Sox away game. The owners' argument –\"they won't come to the park if you give the game away\"– was invalidated under this arrangement. The New York owners went one step further: in 1932 they agreed to ban all radio broadcasting –even of visitors' re-creations– from their parks. Larry MacPhail took over the Cincinnati Reds in 1933 and sold a controlling interest in the club to Powel Crosley, owner of two Cincinnati radio stations. It was a match made in economic heaven: MacPhail knew that broadcasting games would promote the team and Crosley could now boost his radio ratings. Their symbiosis is reminiscent of St. Louis beer-garden magnate Chris von der Ahe's takeover of the St. Louis team in order to sell more beer. When MacPhail moved to Brooklyn in 1938, he brought Reds announcer Red Barber with him and broke the New York radio ban. The next year was the first year that all the major league teams broadcast their games. Prophetically, it was also the year of the first televised baseball game.\nIn 1935, Baseball Commissioner Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis orchestrated a radio deal that covered the World Series. All three networks were involved, and baseball made US$400,000. Landis, as ever, was imperious; he dismissed Ted Husing as games announcer despite the fact that, with five World Series, Husing was second only to the ubiquitous Graham McNamee in Series-announcing experience. The amount of money involved in baseball broadcasting was growing. Gillette, the razor blade manufacturer and one of the first companies to realize the power of sports as an advertising vehicle, tried to flex its muscles by offering Red Barber a substantial amount to walk out on his Dodger contract and join Gillette on a new Yankees/Giants network. Barber refused. In 1946 the company was rich enough to sign a 10-year, $14-million deal for exclusive radio sponsorship of the World Series and All-Star Games.\nThough radio grew quickly as a medium for baseball, many teams were still apprehensive about it, fearing negative effects on attendance. Nevertheless, each team was allowed to reach its own policy by 1932, and the Chicago Cubs broadcast all of their games on WMAQ in 1935. The last holdouts were the New York teams—the Giants, Dodgers, and Yankees combined to block radio broadcasts of their games until 1938.\nBy the end of this period, radio had become increasingly commercialized. Wheaties started its long relationship with baseball in 1933, and in 1934, sponsorship rights to the World Series were first sold.\nGolden age.\nDuring the Golden Age of Radio, television sports broadcasting was in its infancy, and radio was still the main form of broadcasting baseball. Many notable broadcasters, such as Mel Allen, Red Barber, Harry Caray, Russ Hodges, Ernie Harwell, and Vin Scully, started in this period.\nHowever, broadcasting still did not look like the way it does today—recreations of games based on telegrams, the original means of broadcasting, were still widely used. The Liberty Broadcasting System operated solely through recreations of games, because live games were too expensive. Gordon McLendon broadcast games throughout the South from 1948 until 1952, when new blackout regulations forced him to stop. The Mutual Broadcasting System also broadcast a \"Game of the Day\" in the 1950s.\nModern period.\nHowever, as the Golden Era wound down, radio was gradually eclipsed by television. The World Series and All-Star Game continued to be broadcast nationally on the radio, with NBC Radio covering the Fall Classic from 1960–1975, and CBS Radio from 1976–1997; the latter network added League Championship Series (and, later, Division Series) coverage as baseball's postseason expanded. However, after Mutual's \"Game of the Day\" ended in 1960 there would not be regular-season baseball broadcast nationally on the radio until 1985, when CBS Radio started a Saturday \"Game of the Week\".\nBeginning in the two World Series teams' flagship radio stations were regularly permitted to produce their own Series broadcasts with local announcers and air them live. The affiliate stations in the teams' radio networks continued to be obligated to carry the national broadcasts, however.\nIn 1998, national radio broadcasts moved to ESPN Radio. ESPN Radio currently broadcasts \"Sunday Night Baseball\" games during the regular season, as well as Saturday and occasional weekday games, along with the All-Star Game and all postseason contests. Since 2021, TUDN Radio airs Spanish-language coverage of select regular season and postseason games, including the World Series. \nSince 2005, Major League Baseball has a partnership with XM Satellite Radio, launching a 24/7 channel MLB Home Plate which carries every major league game.

The game was held on July 10, 1990, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, the home of the Chicago Cubs of the National League. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 2–0. The game is remembered for a rain delay in the 7th inning that resulted in CBS airing \"Rescue 911\" during the delay. This is also the first game (and, so far, the only one) to feature two players bearing the same name: Gregg Olson was a pitcher, representing the AL squad and Baltimore Orioles, while catcher Greg Olson represented the NL squad and Atlanta Braves. Outfielder Jose Canseco of the Oakland Athletics and Second Baseman Ryne Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs were the leaders of their leagues in the fan votes.\nThe pregame ceremonies celebrated the 85th anniversary of the Great Lakes Naval Training Station which, as with previous All-Star Games held in Chicago, provided the colors presentation. After Wayne Messmer sang \"O Canada\", recording artist (and native Chicagoan) Richard Marx sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". The last All-Star Game previously held at Wrigley Field was represented by Ernie Banks who threw out the ceremonial first pitch.\nThe National League registered just two hits in the contest, the fewest by any team in the history of the All-Star Game.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nAmerican League.\nManager: \"Tony La Russa\", Oakland\nCoaches: Jeff Torborg, Chicago White Sox, Frank Robinson, Baltimore, Jim Lefebvre, Seattle\nNational League.\nManager: Roger Craig, San Francisco\nCoaches: Jim Leyland, Pittsburgh\nDon Zimmer, Chicago Cubs\nGame.\nGame summary.\nAll the scoring was done by the American League in a single inning.

This marked the 15th and final All-Star Game appearance of Ozzie Smith, who retired after the 1996 season. Smith entered the game in the top of the sixth inning. His first at-bat was greeted by chants of \"Oz-zie, Oz-zie\" from the Philadelphia crowd. Iron Man Cal Ripken Jr., who was in the midst of his record-breaking run of consecutive games played, broke his nose during the pre-game AL team picture. However, he was ready to go at game time and started at SS.\nDuring the pregame ceremonies, Kelsey Grammer of \"Frasier\" sang the American National Anthem and Canadian singer Sarah McLachlan sang the Canadian National Anthem. U.S. Congressman Jim Bunning (who was elected to the baseball hall-of-fame in 1996) joined other Phillies' hall of fame alumni Mike Schmidt, Steve Carlton, Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts in tossing the ceremonial first pitches.\nJoe Carter, the Toronto Blue Jays representative to the All-Star Game, received boos from the crowd for his home run that ended the 1993 World Series.\nThe game resulted in the National League defeating the American League 6–0. The National League would not win another All-Star Game until 2010.\nThen-Chairman of the Executive Committee Bud Selig presented the All-Star Game MVP Award to Mike Piazza. Bobby Brown had presented the MVP Award in 1993, while National League President Len Coleman had presented the award in 1994 and 1995. After presenting the MVP Award at the 1998 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Selig was officially named Commissioner of Baseball.\nThis is the only All-Star Game in which not a single pitcher walked a batter; appropriately, Braves closer Mark Wohlers was the final pitcher of the game.\nVeterans Stadium also held the \"distinction\" of being the most recent host stadium to be closed down, a distinction it lost after Yankee Stadium closed at the conclusion of the 2008 season. This is also, as of the end of the 2019 MLB season, the last MLB All-Star Game to be played on artificial turf (there are now five MLB stadiums with artificial turf, but all are of the next-generation variety).\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame."

It is found in Argentina and Bolivia in forested valleys and on slopes on the eastern side of the Andes Mountains.\nDescription.\nThe southern climbing mouse grows to a head-and-body length of about , with a tail some 110 to 135% longer than this. There is a clear demarcation line between the dorsal and ventral pelage; the dorsal fur is dense and varies in colour from greyish brown to orangish brown, while the hairs of the ventral region have dark grey bases and creamy tips. The ears are large and oval in shape and the molars are large. The hind-feet are fairly large with clearly-outlined dark patches on their upper surfaces extending to the bases of the digits. The tail is brown with short hairs along its length and a terminal tuft of hairs.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe southern climbing mouse is found on the eastern slopes of the Andes in South America. Its range extends from Jujuy Province in northwestern Argentina northwards to Santa Cruz Department in central Bolivia and La Paz Department in northwestern Bolivia. Its altitudinal range is between about , occurring at lower altitudes in Argentina and higher ones in La Paz, where it shares some of the valley systems with Gardner's climbing mouse (\"Rhipidomys gardneri\") but generally occurs at higher elevations than that species. Its typical habitat is the Yungas forest that occurs in the densely wooded valleys, but in Argentina it also occurs in montane, transitional and lowland forests. It is nocturnal and a good tree climber, and is sometimes considered a pest in coffee plantations.\nStatus.\nThe southern climbing mouse is a common species with a wide distribution which seems to have a stable population and has adapted to many habitats, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \"least concern\"."

The fur is rather coarse and short. The upper parts vary in colour from yellowish brown to reddish brown, the individual hairs being banded, and having black or dark brown guard hairs mixed among them.

It occurs in an arc from Trinidad and the island of Margarita, through the coastal region of northern Venezuela, and a swathe of west-central Venezuela (the southeasterly side of the Merida Andes and the foothills of the Eastern Cordillera) to Meta Department in central Colombia. This mouse is probably also present in the belt of humid forest connecting some of these areas. Further south than this, this mouse is replaced by the white-footed climbing mouse (\"Rhipidomys leucodactylus\"). Its altitudinal range is from sea level up to about .

It shares the same name with the women's tournament, and are disputed simultaneously. The number of participating clubs varies every year. The champion team qualifies for the South American Championship. Vôlei Natal, who play at the 10,000-capacity Ginásio Nélio Dias, are the current champions.\nHistory.\nFirst competitions.\nUntil the early 1960s, there were only state volleyball competitions in Brazil. A national level competition was inconceivable because of the geographical distances and lack of transportation infrastructure. Only in 1962 the first national volleyball competition was disputed, the Guarani Trophy of Champion clubs (). The competition was disputed two more times, being renamed in 1964 to Brazilian Championship of Champion Clubs (). Between 1965 and 1967 there was a hiatus without a national level competition, until the Brazilian Trophy () was organized in 1968 with teams from Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais. The competition was organized in such format until 1975.\nFully national competition and professionalism.\nOnly in 1976, the competition was opened to amateur clubs from all Brazilian states, and became truly national. It was renamed to Brazilian Championship () and was held every second year. In 1980 the Brazilian Championship had a major reorganization, becoming an annual competition and allowing professional teams for the first time. The competition's format changed in 1988, and started to follow the northern hemisphere calendar. Also, it was renamed to Brazilian National League (). The competition was disputed under this format between the seasons 1988-89 and 1993–94.\nThe foundation of Super League.\nThere was a last major change in the organization of the competition in the 1994–95 season. Again, it was renamed to Brazilian National Super League (). The first champion of the tournament, with the present format, was Frangosul/Ginástica.\nWomen's league.\nThe Women's Superliga most successful team have been Rio de Janeiro Vôlei Clube with eleven titles, since the creation of the Superliga, when Leites Nestlé won three consecutives titles from 1994–95 to 1996–97."

It is found in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.\nDescription.\nThe montane African climbing mice have short, soft brown to reddish-brown pelage with a dark stripe down the middle of their backs and dark gray or grayish underparts. They have tails that can equal up to 133% of their head and body length, which taper and are covered in scales and short hair.\nMontane African climbing mice have a typical mymorphous zygomatic arch with a narrow infraorbital foramen, due to the prominence of the lower anterior-positioned masseter muscles—resulting in only three molars in a row and grooved upper incisors.\nThe hind limbs of the montane African climbing mouse are elongated, with hind feet highly specialized for climbing. \"D. insignis\" have a reduced inner proximal foot pad, and a reduced first digit with a nail.\nThe montane African climbing mouse is one of the largest species of the genus Dendromus, with head and body length ranges from 76 mm to 90 mm and weigh from 7-20 g, up to 20% larger than other Dendromus species. Additionally, their head is relatively large compared to other genera of rodents, making up about 27% of their head and body length and resulting in longer molar rows.\nEcology.\nBehavior and Diet.\nThe montane African climbing mouse avoids predation by being nocturnal, using its well-adapted hind feet to climb twigs and dense grasses and its long hindlimbs to produce long jumps of up to 45 cm. Its climbing agility is used to contribute to its insectivorous and granivorous diet, and allows for nests to be above ground.\nRange and Habitat.\nIts home range of extends through mountainous areas but they generally dwell in heath and alpine zones. They have been documented across a wide range of high altitude locales, including elevations as high as 4240 m. Below 2000 m, grassland meets the montane forest, and \"D. insignis\" is less commonly found, as easy-to-climb dense vegetation is reduced."

The Home Run Derby was held on July 9 at AT&amp;T Park, the home field of the San Francisco Giants. As usual, the competition had eight competitors, seven of whom were eliminated over three rounds. The Home Run Derby was seen July 9 on ESPN at 8 p.m. EST.\nVladimir Guerrero of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim beat Alex Ríos of the Toronto Blue Jays 3–2 in the final. Sixteen years later, Guerrero's son Vladimir Guerrero Jr. would go on to win the 2023 contest making them the only father-son tandem to win the MLB Home Run Derby.\nCompetitors.\nThe eight competitors were 2006 winner Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies, Justin Morneau of the Minnesota Twins, Prince Fielder of the Milwaukee Brewers, Vladimir Guerrero of the Los Angeles Angels, Magglio Ordóñez of the Detroit Tigers, Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals (who last participated in 2003), Alex Ríos of the Toronto Blue Jays and Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies, who replaced the Florida Marlins' Miguel Cabrera, who was injured in a game on July 7 after being announced as a participant.\nRules.\nAny ball that is swung at by the batter must be hit over the outfield fence in fair territory to be ruled a home run. A swing and a miss is an out, but if the batter doesn't swing, no out is recorded.\nIn the event of a tie, a swing-off will be held. The contestant with the most home runs in five swings advances. If there is still a tie after five swings, each contestant will be given three swings to break the tie.\nRound One.\nEach contestant gets ten outs. The top four home run hitters advance on to the next round.\nRound Two.\nTotals from the first round carry over. Each batter again receives ten outs. The top two advance to the final round.\nRound Three.\nHome run totals do not carry over for this round. As in the first two rounds, both hitters have ten outs. The competitor who has the most home runs at the end of the round is the winner.\nCompetition.\n\"italics\" – Hall of Famer\nRecorded only seven of ten outs before hitting winning home run.&lt;br&gt;\nAdvanced after defeating Morneau 2-1 in a swing-off."

During his career, spent entirely in the minor leagues with the exception of one major league game, he was used almost exclusively as a first baseman. Wright played one game in Major League Baseball (MLB), for the Seattle Mariners.\nWright's one major league game was on April 14, 2002, which he started as the designated hitter for Seattle against the Texas Rangers. In three plate appearances, Wright achieved the distinction of striking out (second inning), hitting into a triple play (fourth inning), and hitting into a double play (sixth inning). He was replaced by Mark McLemore in the seventh inning; Seattle went on to win the game, 9–7. , Wright is the only player to serve as a designated hitter in his only MLB game.\nAfter retiring from professional baseball, Wright earned a degree in pharmacy at Idaho State University and returned to Utah to work as a pharmacist. He married Annica in 1997, with whom he has four children."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers from 2008 through 2015. He was an MLB All-Star in 2012.\nEarly life and high school.\nHarrison was born in Durham, North Carolina, on September 16, 1985. He attended South Granville High School in Creedmoor, North Carolina. He had signed a letter of intent to play baseball at North Carolina State University, but was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the third round of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft and subsequently signed a professional contract.\nProfessional career.\nMinor Leagues.\nHarrison made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast League's Gulf Coast Braves in . He played in with the Danville Braves of the Appalachian League and in with the Rome Braves of the Single-A South Atlantic League. saw Harrison split time between the Single-A Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Carolina League and the Double-A Mississippi Braves of the Southern League. He was named the Braves' Minor League Player of the Year, the Pelicans' Pitcher of the Year and was a Carolina League All-Star that season.\nEntering , Harrison was rated by \"Baseball America\" as the third-best prospect in the Braves organization and the seventh-best prospect in the Carolina League. He began 2007 with Double-A Mississippi, starting 20 games for the team, compiling a 5–9 record with a 3.39 ERA and 78 strikeouts. On July 30, 2007, Harrison, along with catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, minor league pitchers Neftalí Feliz and Beau Jones, and shortstop prospect Elvis Andrus, were traded by the Braves to the Texas Rangers for Mark Teixeira and Ron Mahay.\nTexas Rangers (2008–2015).\n2008.\nHarrison missed the end of the 2007 minor league regular season due to shoulder inflammation. He made his first appearance for the Rangers organization with the Surprise Rafters during the 2007 Arizona Fall League season, where he accounted for a perfect 5–0 record.\nAt the start of the season, Harrison was assigned to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders of the Texas League. On May 18, he threw a no-hitter against the San Antonio Missions, only the second no-hitter in RoughRiders' history. After only nine appearances with Frisco, Harrison earned a promotion to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks in June. While in Oklahoma, he went 3–1, with a 3.55 ERA in six appearances.\nAs the middle of the season wore on, the Rangers pitching staff suffered a number of injuries, and the team made the decision to call up Harrison from Frisco on July 8. He made his major league debut with the Rangers that day, defeating the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, 3–2, outdueling All-Star pitcher Joe Saunders in the process. On September 12, Harrison threw a complete-game shutout in a 7–0 road victory against the Oakland Athletics. This was the first shutout by a Rangers rookie left-hander in two decades. Harrison—one of 12 Rangers rookies to make their major league debuts in 2008—finished out the season in the majors, ending up with a 9–3 record and a 5.49 ERA.\n2009.\nIn 2009, Harrison was limited to 11 starts going 4-5 with a 6.11 ERA.\n2010.\nIn 2010, he was 3–2 with a 4.71 ERA, pitching in 37 games (6 of which he started).\nWith the Rangers finishing 90-72, the team made the postseason but lost to the San Francisco Giants in the 2010 World Series.\n2011.\nHarrison was 14–9, with a 3.39 ERA in 2011. He started the game the Rangers won to clinch the AL West (Pitched 6 innings, gave up a run). Harrison won Game 4 Of the ALDS versus the Tampa Bay Rays. With that win Texas won the series and advanced to the ALCS. The Rangers lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2011 World Series.\n2012.\n2012 was a good year for Harrison as he earned his first career All-Star selection. He went 18-11 with a 3.29 ERA in 32 starts to lead the Rangers in wins. However, they lost in the Wild Card Game.\n2013.\n2013 became a short-lived season for Harrison as he experienced back soreness. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to back stiffness on April 10, 2013. On April 20, 2013, Harrison underwent back surgery to repair a herniated disc. He underwent a second back surgery on May 2, 2013, which prematurely ended his season. In only 2 starts of the 2013 season, Harrison went 0-2 with an 8.44 ERA.\n2014.\nDuring the 2014 season, Harrison made only 4 starts going 1-1 with a 4.15 ERA. On May 13, 2014, Harrison left the game with an apparent back injury, which landed him on the disabled list the following day. On June 3, 2014, Harrison underwent spinal fusion surgery to alleviate lumbar herniation in his back, which ended his season. Doctors declared that it was not safe for Harrison to continue playing baseball or any other sport, even after making a full recovery.\n2015.\nHarrison started the 2015 season on the 60-day disabled list in an effort to continue recovery from his spinal fusion surgery. Sources projected that he would return by July or after the All-Star break. On July 27, during Harrison’s third appearance of the season (a start against the Yankees), he experienced more back pain, after which the Rangers elected to end his season.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn July 31, 2015, Harrison was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Nick Williams, Jorge Alfaro, Jake Thompson, Alec Asher, and Jerad Eickhoff in exchange for Cole Hamels and Jake Diekman. Harrison was released by the Phillies on November 15, 2016, having not thrown a single pitch for the organization. He retired during the offseason as a result of his recurring back injuries.\nPitching style.\nHarrison threw a sinkerballer, although he used five pitches regularly. The 89–94 mph sinker was complemented by a four-seam fastball (90–94), a cutter (85–88), a curveball (77–80), and a changeup (80–83). The changeup was rarely used against left-handed hitters, as was the cutter against right-handed hitters. His changeup garnered a very effective 37% whiff rate in the first half of 2012.\nPersonal life.\nMatt met his wife Meghan in 2002 while attending South Granville High School. They were married on December 13, 2008. On December 14, 2011, the couple welcomed their first child Addie Grace Harrison."

Hoffman was a three-time second team Helms Foundation All-American.\nProfessional playing career.\nHoffman was drafted by the Toronto Huskies in the 1947 BAA draft, but never played for the team as it folded before the season began. He instead signed with the Baltimore Bullets, and averaged 10.5 points per game in his rookie season and was named NBA Rookie of the Year—a designation not sanctioned by the NBA for the 1947–48 season. The Bullets went on to win the 1948 BAA Finals and were crowned BAA champions. Hoffman wanted his salary raised following his successful debut season, but the team refused, so Hoffman left to return to Indiana and became a salesman at Montgomery Ward. Hoffman re-signed with the team for the 1949–50 season.\nAfter playing for five seasons with the Bullets, the team disbanded in November 1954, fourteen games into the 1954–55 season.

He was replaced as the head baseball coach by former Boilermaker star Joe Sexson. He also worked as an assistant for the basketball team under head coach Ray Eddy.\nLater years.\nHe served as general manager for the Baltimore Bullets. from June 1963 through May 1965; the Bullets recorded an overall record of 68–92 (.425) and reached the NBA Western Division Finals in the 1964–65 season.\nIn 1977, he was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame.

It was founded in 2000 and joined the FIRA-AER (now Rugby Europe) as an associate member in 2002. Rugby Europe suspended the Rugby Federation of Armenia in November 2014 due to inactivity.\nHistory.\nRugby union in Armenia has not been popular historically, but the neighbouring Caucasus country, Georgia has a strong rugby culture in competition at international level including at the Rugby World Cup. Rugby was introduced to both Georgia and Armenia by Jacques Haspekian, an Armenian from Marseilles, France.\nThe first rugby games were played in the country in the 1960s, when Armenia was a Soviet republic. Rugby had been played in the Russian Empire as early as in 1908, and the first Soviet Championship took place in the 1930s. The game was forbidden in the USSR in 1948, but rugby competitions were eventually resumed in 1957. The Soviet Championship was reinstated in 1966, with Armenian club, Yerevan Dinamo RC, joining the top division. Armenia had its own representative team within the USSR, although it was not considered to be a proper national side.\nRugby in the Soviet era: 1960s to 1990.\nJacques Haspekian, part of the large Armenian diaspora in France, went to Armenia in the late 1950s. As a rugby enthusiast, he submitted a proposal to the Armenian Sports Committee to begin the development of rugby in the country. He did not gain approval as rugby was still regarded as a bourgeois sport by the regime, so he went to Georgia instead. Aspikian was to be one of the founders of rugby union in Georgia, later to become the strongest rugby region in the former USSR.\nIn 1963, Aspikian returned to Armenia and staged an exhibition match at Yerevan between two Georgian teams. The game generated suitable interest in rugby and led to foundation of Yerevan's first rugby competition in 1965. Rugby teams were formed in Yerevan's main sporting clubs of Dinamo, Spartak, Ashxatanq, and Burevestnik, and the game was also played by several universities. In the 1966–67 season, the Yerevan Dinamo Rugby Club entered the top division of the Soviet Championship. The national team of Armenia was formed at this time, with players largely drawn from the Dinamo team.\nThe Yerevan Spartak Rugby Club took Dinamo's place in the Soviet Championships in 1972. In a later season, Spartak reached the quarter-final stages of the Soviet Cup. However, the rugby teams were disbanded by the early 1990s due to the effects of the Armenia-Azerbaijan War and economic difficulties in Armenia following the demise of the Soviet Union. Armenia gained its independence from the USSR in 1991, but rugby in went into hibernation in the country for almost a decade.\nRugby since independence: 1991 onwards.\nRugby was re-established in Armenia in the year 2000, with the founding of the Rugby Federation of Armenia (RFA). Gagik Panikian become the RFA president in 2002 and pledged to improve the popularity of the sport and the quality of players Armenia produced. The RFA joined FIRA-AER (now Rugby Europe) as an associate member later in 2002. An Armenian 7s team and an Armenian national team were soon formed, largely drawn from players of Armenian heritage in France. The 15-man side played at the 2004 European Championships, defeating and .\nRecent events.\nIn 2014, Rugby Europe suspended the Rugby Federation of Armenia due to inactivity.\nClubs.\nAs of 2012, there were three rugby clubs in Armenia: Ararat, Artashat, and Ureni.\nExternal links.\nOfficial site:\nOther sites:"

        "title": "Carlos Carrasco (baseball)",
        "text": "Carlos Luis Carrasco (born March 21, 1987), nicknamed \"Cookie\", is a Venezuelan-American professional baseball pitcher for the Cleveland Guardians of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut with the Cleveland Indians in 2009 and has also played for the New York Mets. Listed at and , he throws and bats right-handed.\nEarly life.\nCarrasco was born in 1987 in Barquisimeto, Venezuela. By age 10 he was playing baseball, initially as a third baseman. He was discovered by a baseball scout in Venezuela at age 16, and threw for Sal Agostinelli, international scouting director for the Philadelphia Phillies, demonstrating a fastball. At a young age, Carrasco learned to throw left-handed, in addition to his natural right-handed delivery, but he does not consider himself ambidextrous.\nCareer.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nCarrasco was signed by the Phillies as an undrafted free agent on November 25, 2003. In 2006, Carrasco spent the entire season at the Single-A level with the Lakewood BlueClaws, compiling a 2.26 ERA in innings pitched. He split time in 2007 between the Single-A Clearwater Threshers and the Double-A Reading Phillies. Carrasco compiled a 2.84 ERA in innings pitched at Clearwater and a 4.86 ERA in innings pitched with Reading. Carrasco threw his first no-hitter on August 21, 2007. He was on the World roster of the 2006, 2007, and 2008 All-Star Futures Games.\nEntering the 2007 season, Carrasco was ranked as the top prospect in the Phillies organization and the 41st-best prospect in baseball. He was still ranked as the top prospect in the Phillies system entering 2008, and was listed as having the organization's best fastball and changeup.\nCleveland Indians.\nOn July 29, 2009, the Phillies traded Carrasco, along with Jason Donald, Lou Marson, and Jason Knapp to the Cleveland Indians for Cliff Lee and Ben Francisco. Carrasco made his major league debut on September 1. In five starts with the Indians, he had a 0–4 record with 8.87 ERA. During the 2010 season, Carrasco had a 2–2 record and 3.83 ERA in seven starts for Cleveland.\nOn July 29, 2011, against the Kansas City Royals, Carrasco surrendered a season-high 7 runs over innings highlighted by a grand slam by outfielder Melky Cabrera. Carrasco took out his frustration by throwing a pitch at the head of Kansas City Royals' designated hitter Billy Butler. This resulted in his immediate ejection by home plate umpire Scott Barry. Because of this action, MLB suspended Carrasco for 6 games and levied an undisclosed fine. According to Carrasco, the pitch was not intentional, but he was upset because Cabrera had admired his homer. Carrasco made 21 starts for Cleveland, pitching to an 8–9 record with 4.62 ERA and striking out 86 batters in innings. In September 2011, Carrasco underwent Tommy John surgery and eventually missed the entire 2012 season as a result.\nOn April 9, 2013, Carrasco made his first start since his Tommy John surgery and suspension. His season began with a rather poor outing against the New York Yankees during which he surrendered seven runs in innings. After giving up a 2-run homer to Robinson Cano, on the next pitch Carrasco hit batter Kevin Youkilis. This resulted in Carrasco's ejection by home plate umpire Jordan Baker. Major League Baseball eventually suspended Carrasco eight games and fined him $5,000 for \"intentionally throwing\" at Youkilis. This punishment appeared to take into account Carrasco's history and past actions. After the game, Indians manager Terry Francona said that Carrasco's actions \"didn't look good.\" On April 10, 2013, Carrasco was optioned to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers. Carrasco was recalled to the majors on June 8, and then sent back down to Triple-A on June 24. He was recalled on July 6, and then designated for assignment on July 7. He was then optioned to Columbus on July 9. Carrasco's record for the 2013 season with Cleveland was 1–4 with a 6.75 ERA.\nFor the 2014 season, Carrasco appeared in 40 games for Cleveland (14 starts) and had an 8–7 record with 2.55 ERA while striking out 140 batters in 134 innings.\nOn April 7, 2015, Carrasco signed a 4-year extension worth $22 million that also includes club options for 2019 and 2020.\nDuring a game against the Chicago White Sox on April 14, Carrasco was struck in the face by a line drive off the bat of Melky Cabrera. He left the game as he was carted off on a motor stretcher. Carrasco had a bruise on his jaw while X-rays were negative. On July 1, Carrasco took a no-hitter into the ninth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays, only to surrender a two-out, two-strike single to Joey Butler before retiring the side. It would have been the first no-hitter by an Indians pitcher since Len Barker's perfect game on May 15, 1981. On July 19, Carrasco hit the first single of his major league career against the Cincinnati Reds' Johnny Cueto in the top of the second inning. Carrasco went six innings giving up four hits and one earned run with a no decision. In 30 starts during the 2015 season, Carrasco compiled a 14–12 record with a 3.63 ERA, and struck out 216 batters in innings.\nCarrasco made two trips to the disabled list in 2016, the second of which resulted from a line drive to his right hand on September 17 that fractured the fifth metacarpal bone. This injury forced Carrasco to miss the entire postseason. Carrasco finished the 2016 season with an 11–8 record and 3.32 ERA in 25 starts, recording 150 strikeouts in innings.\nIn the fifth inning of a July 7, 2017, game against the Detroit Tigers, Carrasco pitched an immaculate inning, striking out the side on the minimum nine pitches. He became only the second pitcher in Indians history to do so, following Justin Masterson in 2014, and the 84th in Major League history. Carrasco struck out 14 Minnesota Twins batters on September 28, in a 5–2 game to give Cleveland their 100th win of the season. For the 2017 season, Carrasco was 18–6 with a 3.29 ERA, striking out 226 in 200 innings.\nDuring 2018, Carrasco struck out 231 batters in 192 innings, pitching to a record of 17–10 with a 3.38 ERA. On December 6, 2018, Carrasco signed a contract extension through the 2022 season with a club option for the 2023 season.\nOn June 5, 2019, Carrasco was placed on the 10-day injured list, with the team stating that he had been \"diagnosed with a blood condition.\" He subsequently spent the remainder of June on the injured list. On July 6, 2019, Carrasco revealed that he had been diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a treatable form of leukemia.\nOn August 28, 2019, Carrasco was activated from the IL. On September 1, he made his first appearance since his diagnosis, pitching an inning in relief against the Tampa Bay Rays. Carrasco was named the 2019 AL Comeback Player of the Year.\nWith the 2020 Cleveland Indians, Carrasco appeared in 12 games, compiling a 3–4 record with 2.91 ERA and 82 strikeouts in 68 innings pitched.\nNew York Mets.\nOn January 7, 2021, the Indians traded Carrasco and Francisco Lindor to the New York Mets for Amed Rosario, Andrés Giménez, Josh Wolf, and Isaiah Greene. During spring training, Carrasco tore his hamstring during a running drill and was expected be out for six to eight weeks. As of late April, he was expected to join the Mets rotation in the second week of May. On May 6, Carrasco was placed on the 60-day injured list as he continued to recover from the injury.\nHe was activated by the Mets in late July, and made his first appearance with the team on July 30, receiving a no decision in a start against the Cincinnati Reds. The first pitch Carrasco threw for the Mets was hit for a home run by Jonathan India. Carrasco's first season with the Mets was described as \"discouraging\" and \"frustrating.\" He finished the year with a 6.04 ERA in 12 starts.\nAfter the season, Carrasco revealed that he had been pitching with a bone fragment in his elbow which was repaired with surgery in October.\nCarrasco began the 2022 season with a 4 - 1 record in his first eight appearances for the Mets. On July 30, 2022, he earned his 100th career win after a 4–0 shutout against the Miami Marlins.\nOn November 10, 2022, the Mets exercised Carrasco's $14 million option for the 2023 season. On August 29, 2023, Carrasco was placed on waivers by the Mets, but was not claimed and remained with the club. He became a free agent following the season.\nCleveland Guardians (second stint).\nOn February 1, 2024, Carrasco signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Guardians. On March 22, it was announced that Carrasco had made Cleveland's Opening Day roster. The Guardians selected Carrasco's contract on March 28.\nPersonal life.\nCarrasco shared in a \"Players' Tribune\" article some rather unusual experiences during his early time in the United States. In his first spring training, he ate Domino's Pizza every day for 90 consecutive days, because \"it was the only thing I knew how to order.\" Domino's awarded him one month of free pizza for being their \"best customer.\" He added, he did little outside of baseball in his first few years in the U.S., including not speaking with his teammates. \"Not because I didn’t want to, but because I didn’t know how.\" After being traded to the Indians, he dedicated his efforts to learning English. In August 2016, he became a US citizen.\nCarrasco has five children with his wife, Karelis. In 2010, Carrasco and his daughter Camila, then four years old, visited children at a hospital, which inspired Camila to start to cut her hair with scissors to give to the cancer patients.\nCarrasco is heavily involved in community development and charity work; he has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars, time, and supplies to organizations located in his native Venezuela along with Colombia, the United States, Africa, and more. He was the 2019 recipient of the Roberto Clemente Award, given annually to an MLB player who \"best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team.\""

        "text": "Aerobic gymnastics or sport aerobics is a competitive sport originating from traditional aerobics in which complex, high-intensity movement patterns and elements of varying difficulty are performed to music.\nNature of the game.\nThe performance area is square for juniors or square for adults and for aero dance and step.\nIn International competition there are 9 different events: Individual Women, Individual Men, Mixed Pairs, Trios, Group (five athletes), Step and Dance (both two last categories have eight athletes). The last four are regardless of the genders of the athletes.\nThe performances are made up of four groups of elements. The routine must be performed entirely to music.\nIn the competition, there are specific requirements regarding the outfit, the number of elements performed, the number of lifts performed, the number of elements performed on the floor and much more.\nPerformances are scored in the following areas: artistry, execution, difficulty and the chair of the judges panel determines the final score deductions based on deductions that change with each code of points. If the combined scores are the same, the tiebreaker is the team with higher execution scores.\nThe long-term ultimate goal of the sport of aerobic gymnastics is to be included in the Olympic Games.\nCompetitive aerobic gymnastics.\nNational Aerobic Championships.\nThe National Aerobic Championships was a competition of aerobic gymnastics started in 1984 in the United States. Founded by Sport Fitness International, it was the first major championships in the sport predating the Aerobic Gymnastics World Championships by 11 years. From 1988 onwards the individual events were separated into individual men and women, mixed pair and team. The sport became popular around the world after it gained popularity in the US when major championships were aired on ESPN during the height of the fitness movement in the US. In recent years, the sport has experienced growth in Eastern Europe, China, Argentina, Mexico, Canada and Australia among other countries but has not grown significantly in the US as the creators of the sport in the USA struggled to transition the focus from fitness to gymnastics. As other countries have blended successfully with their gymnastic federations, the US, where the sport was created, has not been as successful in making that transition. USA Gymnastics does not officially acknowledge the sport as a gymnastic discipline even though the international governing body, the FIG, does so.\nFIG aerobics.\nThe competitive aerobic gymnastics are governed by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). The FIG designs the Code of Points and regulates all aspects of international elite competition. Within individual countries, gymnastics is regulated by national federations. In 1995, the FIG recognised sport aerobics as a new competitive gymnastics discipline, organised judges and coaches courses and launched the 1st Aerobic Gymnastics World Championships in Paris (34 countries). In 1997, the IWGA (International World Games Association) included Aerobic Gymnastics in its programme of the 5th World Games (Lahti, Finland). Since 1999 The European Union of Gymnastics has been conducting Aerobic European Gymnastics Championships in all uneven years. Leading nations who have provided World Medallists are: Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, France, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Romania, Russia and Spain.\nFISAF aerobics.\nFISAF stands for the Federation of International Sport Aerobics and Fitness. It is an independent, not-for-profit, international sport aerobics association with over 30 member countries around the world.\nFederation of International Sports, Aerobics and Fitness\nhttps://www.fisafinternational.com/\nhttps://www.fisafinternational.com/en/\nFISAF International \nSports Aerobics, Fitness and Hip Hop\nFISA–FOCA war\nFISAF\nIn popular culture.\nThe sport was added in the biannual Idol Star Athletics Championships for Lunar New Year, 2017 as a male team equivalent to the female individual rhythmic gymnastics, and the scores are given in accordance to FIG Standards. Seventeen (9.8 Technical+9.3 Execution-0.0 Penalty) and ASTRO (9.75+9.45-0.1) both scored 19.10 out of 20.00, but since ASTRO scored higher in Execution, ASTRO won the inaugural event.\nIn the American sketch comedy television series Key &amp; Peele, the duo parodies the '80s video footage of the National Aerobic Championship in a sketch showing one of the aerobic dancers experiencing a meltdown while dancing to the championship theme song."

        "title": "1957 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 1957 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 24th playing of the midseason exhibition baseball game between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 9, 1957, at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri, the home of the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League. The game was marked by controversy surrounding Cincinnati Redlegs fans stuffing the ballot box and electing all but one of their starting position players to the game. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 6–5.\nGame summary.\nSix runs were scored in the final inning, three by each team, for an exciting ending as the American League eked out a 6-5 victory.\nThe game's scoring began in the second inning with a Mickey Mantle single, Ted Williams walk and Vic Wertz base hit, followed by walks to Yogi Berra and Harvey Kuenn that put the AL on top, 2-0. The score remained that way until the sixth, when a Moose Skowron double and Berra single made it 3-0.\nScoring twice in the seventh, the NL closed the gap with a two-run double by Gus Bell, pinch-hitting for Frank Robinson. In the ninth, the AL appeared to seal the victory with a two-run double by Al Kaline and RBI double by Minnie Miñoso for a 6-2 advantage.\nStan Musial walked and Willie Mays tripled to begin the bottom of the ninth. After Ernie Banks delivered a run-scoring single, with its lead trimmed to 6-5, the AL brought in Bob Grim to face pinch-hitter Gil Hodges, who lined out to left field to end the game.\nCincinnati voting controversy.\nWhen fan voting to determine the game's starters was completed, no fewer than seven Cincinnati Redlegs players (Ed Bailey, Johnny Temple, Roy McMillan, Don Hoak, Frank Robinson, Gus Bell and Wally Post) had been elected to start in the All-Star Game, a record that still stands. The only non-Redleg elected for the National League was St. Louis Cardinal first baseman Stan Musial, who had only narrowly beaten his Reds counterpart George Crowe. Although Cincinnati had the second-best offense in the majors (they would score 747 runs that year, surpassed only by Milwaukee), most baseball observers felt they obviously did not deserve seven starters in the All-Star Game.\nAn investigation was launched by Commissioner Ford Frick, which found that the majority of the ballots cast had come from Cincinnati; in fact, \"The Cincinnati Times-Star\" newspaper had printed up pre-marked ballots with the Cincinnati starting lineup on them, and distributed them with each day's paper to make it easy for Redlegs fans to vote often for their favorite players. Meanwhile, Burger Beer, a Redlegs sponsor, had printed 250,000 similar ballots and distributed them to local bars, and stories emerged of bartenders refusing to serve alcohol to customers until they filled out a ballot.\nSubsequently, Frick suspended fans' voting rights, and appointed Willie Mays of the New York Giants and Hank Aaron of the Milwaukee Braves to substitute for Bell and Post. Bell was kept as a reserve (he would bat for Redlegs teammate Robinson in the seventh and slap a two-RBI double), while Post was injured and would have been unable to play in any event. Hoak and McMillan were each dismissed from the game after a single at-bat, in favour of future Hall of Famers Eddie Mathews and Ernie Banks, respectively. Temple batted twice before giving way to another future Cooperstown resident, Red Schoendienst. (Bailey caught the whole game, but was pinch-hit for in the bottom of the ninth.)\nManagers, players, and coaches picked the teams until fan voting rights were restored in 1970. To avoid a repeat of this incident, MLB officials evenly distributed the 26 million ballots for that year to 75,000 retail outlets and 150 minor and major league stadiums, while a special panel was also created to review the voting.\nDespite these (and other subsequent) measures, teams and media outlets still tell fans to vote for their favorite players instead of the best players; while the voting for the All-Star Game has remained a popularity contest, it is to a lesser extent than in 1957.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame."

Tennis Ireland governs the Ireland Davis Cup team and the Ireland Billie Jean King Cup team.\nHistory.\nTennis Ireland was formed in 1908 as the Irish Lawn Tennis Association, a federation of 14 Irish tennis clubs. It became independent of the Lawn Tennis Association following the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922.\nNotable winners of the Irish Championships/Irish Open.\nBelow is a list of Irish Championships/Irish Open winners some of whom were also Grand Slam finalists or former World No. 1 tennis players. \nIrish Major Tournament Champions.\nBelow is a list of Irish grand slam, Davis Cup, and Olympic champions. In total an Irish player has won a singles grand slam on eight occasions, a doubles grand slam on five occasions and a mixed doubles grand slam on four occasions. Irish players have won six Olympic medals in tennis. Eight Irish individuals have either won a grand slam event or an Olympic medal in tennis. All of these victories occurred prior to Ireland's secession from the United Kingdom; as such these individuals competed under the flag of the United Kingdom rather than the Flag of Ireland. \nIrish Champions of Major professional tennis tournaments before the Open Era.\nBefore the advent of the Open era of tennis competitions in April 1968, only amateurs were allowed to compete in established tournaments, including the four majors. However, many top tennis players turned professional to play legally for prize money in the years before the open era. There were also major pro events, where the world's top professional male players often played. These tournaments held with a certain tradition and longevity. According to Ellsworth Vines, \"the Wembley tournament in London..., the U.S. professional championship, and to some extent the tournament in Paris were the major professional tournaments prior to 1968.\" Below is a list of Irish Champions at these events.

        "text": "These are the profiles for the individual stages in the 2007 Tour de France, with the Prologue on 7 July, Stage 1 on 8 July, and Stage 10 on 18 July.\nPrologue.\nOn Saturday July 7, 2007, the Individual time trial started in Whitehall, London passing Westminster, then along \"Victoria Street\" and \"Buckingham Gate\", past Buckingham Palace and looping through Hyde Park before finishing in \"The Mall\". A distance of was covered by the riders. It was won by 's Fabian Cancellara, with a time of 8' 50\".\nStage 1.\nThis stage of the race started in London and headed through Westminster, Greenwich, Woolwich, Erith and into Kent, to Dartford, Gravesend, with an intermediate sprint for the points classification in Medway. The route headed south to Maidstone and another sprint, Tonbridge and then the first King of the Mountains climb before reaching Royal Tunbridge Wells, then the second climb at Goudhurst, another sprint in Tenterden, to Ashford and the final climb before finishing in Canterbury. All the climbs were Category 4.\nIt was won by Robbie McEwen, who sprinted from the back of the field to claim a surprise win. This was after an extended breakaway from British cyclist David Millar.\nStage 2.\nThe second stage marked the return of the Tour to the land of cycling, along the roads of the great Flanders classics: Tour of Flanders, Het Volk, etc. It was anticipated that the race should start to get more serious during this stage, with the wind and the risk of hitting the kerbs definitely playing an important role. It was fairly short at in length and with no categorized climbs.\nThere was a breakaway during the stage by Marcel Sieberg, Cedric Herve and Rubén Pérez who shared the bonuses available at the three sprints: however, this never stretched beyond 6 minutes ahead of the peloton and they were caught some 3 km from the finish.\nWithin the last 2 km, a rider fell sideways causing others to fall. Around 20 riders fell blocking the entire road and leaving approximately 30 riders to sprint for the victory, eventually taken by Gert Steegmans in his home country ahead of his compatriot and team-mate Tom Boonen, who took over the green jersey by coming second in the stage.\nStage 3.\nAt , this is the longest stage in this year's Tour. After Flanders, the peloton returned to France along some of the roads used for the Paris–Roubaix race, to finish in the town where that race starts. Nicolas Vogondy and Mathieu Ladagnous broke away from the field within the first 10 km, and were joined after 42 km by Stéphane Augé and Frederik Willems. By leading the breakaway group over the only classified climb of the day, the Cote de Blerancourt, Auge gained the polka dot shirt. The group was caught by race leader Fabian Cancellara, and by the rest of the peloton, some 500 meters from the finish. Cancellara held off the sprinters to win the stage and to gain time bonuses that extended his lead in the general classification.\nStage 4.\nThis stage headed virtually due south, with four category 4 climbs, passing through the Champagne region and the plains of Brie, before crossing the valleys in the Yonne department along its course. Injuries received in the race for points on the first hill, forced Xabier Zandio's immediate withdrawal, and caused Rémy Di Gregorio to finish almost 8 minutes behind the leaders and rendered him unfit to resume the race the next day. The main breakaway was initiated by Matthieu Sprick and he was joined by Sylvain Chavanel (whose time bonuses gained at intermediate sprints and hills lifted him into the top 10 in the general classification), Gorka Verdugo, Juan Antonio Flecha and Christian Knees; the lead over the peloton was never more than four minutes, and they were caught with just under 5 km remaining. In the first clean sprint of this year's race, Thor Hushovd won from Robert Hunter and earned time bonuses that moved him into second place overall.\nStage 5.\nThe fifth stage featured eight climbs, including one Category 2 climb. Many of the sprinters lost contact with the peloton, but all of the major contenders finished together, apart from Alexander Vinokourov. Vinokourov crashed before the final climb, and ended up losing more than a minute to the rest of the field. The stage was won by Filippo Pozzato.\nStage 6.\nThis stage is relatively flat, with only two category 4 climbs, and was the last opportunity for the sprinters to shine before the race went into the mountains. On the 40th anniversary of the death of Tom Simpson, rider Bradley Wiggins led from the two kilometre mark and at one stage was 18 minutes clear, but riding alone took its toll and with seven kilometres left he was reeled in. That left Tom Boonen to beat Óscar Freire and Erik Zabel in a sprint finish for his first Tour stage win in two years. After the stage Wiggins revealed his lone breakaway was a gift to his wife on her birthday, with Wiggins only finding out about the date's significance after the race.\nStage 7.\nThis was the first mountain stage and the start of the real difficulties for many of the riders. The first kilometres, with three smaller climbs, were a gradual introduction for the riders, before they tackled the Alps and the first real mountain pass of the Tour, the Col de la Colombière (16 km at 6.7%), lying 15 kilometres from the finish line.\nLinus Gerdemann was in a 15-man break for much of the 197.5 km stage but the T-Mobile rider went it alone over the Col de la Colombière, finishing 40 seconds clear of Iñigo Landaluze, to take the yellow jersey from Fabian Cancellara.\nInjured race favourites Alexander Vinokourov and Andreas Klöden finished in a group 3'38\" behind, as did fellow big names Cadel Evans, Alejandro Valverde and Levi Leipheimer.\nStage 8.\nThis was the shortest road stage, but was very tough. The climbing started from the outset, with two small climbs in the first 25 km before, from 75 kilometres out, tackling the Cormet de Roselend (19 km at 6%), the Montée d'Hauteville – the start of the Col du Petit Saint-Bernard – and the climb up to Tignes (18 km at 5.5%) for a very difficult finish at a height of 2068 m.\nDenmark's Michael Rasmussen went it alone for victory in Tignes to secure the Tour de France Yellow jersey. Rasmussen, who began the day 39th overall, was part of a breakaway halfway through the 165 km eighth stage. He went solo on the last climb to finish two minutes and 47 seconds ahead of Iban Mayo and 5:04 clear of Linus Gerdemann, now second overall.\nAlexander Vinokourov and Andreas Klöden both lost 4:29 while Michael Rogers crashed out of the race. T-Mobile leader Rogers was in the same group as Rasmussen – and the race leader on the road – on the descent of the Cormet de Roselend when he hit a roadside barrier. He bravely carried on before being forced to pull up later with a dislocated shoulder.\nLevi Leipheimer sustained a ten-second penalty for slipstreaming behind his team car after sustaining a mechanical issue which necessitated a bike change. Had this not occurred, Leipheimer would have finished 2nd overall in the general classification, 2 seconds in front of Cadel Evans.\nStage 9.\nThe riders made a cold start to the hors catégorie climb up to the Col de l'Iseran (15 km at 6%), followed by the Col du Télégraphe and the Col du Galibier (12 km at 6.7% and 17.5 km at 7%) with a 37 km downhill finish in Briançon.\nAfter joining with a breakaway, Colombian Mauricio Soler made a strong move over the Col du Télégraphe, and stayed away through the descent of the Col du Galibier to claim the first-ever Tour de France stage win for the wild-card team.\nSpeculation ensued after the race, as Alberto Contador had a flat tire while chasing Soler. Many believed that he would have caught Soler had this not happened.\nStage 10.\nThis was a long, mostly downhill stage finishing in Marseille. While most expected a group sprint, a five-man breakaway survived to the end, with Cédric Vasseur winning in the small sprint."

        "text": "Dennis Smith (born 2 August 1969) is a former English professional darts player who played in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) events. He was a stalwart on the PDC circuit, having played there since 1994, but has yet to capture a major title to add to his collection of Open wins. Smith has a very unusual throwing action, turning the dart into a 'flight first' position before returning it to a 'point first' position, rolling his eyes and then throwing. He has a unique, measured action learning his trade under the tutelage of Bob Anderson.\nPDC career.\nSmith's first major event came in the inaugural World Matchplay in 1994, beating American Dave Kelly in the first round but lost in the second round to Shayne Burgess. Smith then made his PDC World Darts Championship debut in 1995, defeating Alan Warriner and Tom Kirby to win group 4 and reach the quarter-finals, losing to John Lowe. Smith then suffered a first round exit in the 1995 World Matchplay and the 1996 PDC World Darts Championship. He reached the quarter-finals of the 1996 World Matchplay, beating Eric Bristow in the first round and then beat Lowe in round two before losing to Jamie Harvey. He then suffered a second successive first round exit in the 1997 World Championship.\nSmith then went through a poor run of form, reaching the second round in the 1997 World Matchplay, but suffered first round exits in the 1998 World Championship and the 1998 World Matchplay. His next big major run came in the 1999 PDC World Darts Championship, beating Peter Evison and Mick Manning to reach the quarter-finals, losing to Peter Manley. Though another first round exit at the World Matchplay followed, Smith achieved his best run in the 2000 PDC World Darts Championship, beating Cliff Lazarenko, John Part and Lowe to reach the semi-finals for the first time, losing 5–0 to Taylor.\nSmith then reached the second round of the 2000 World Matchplay and the 2000 World Grand Prix as well as the 2001 PDC World Darts Championship. Smith followed up with a quarter final place in the 2001 World Matchplay and a semi final place in the 2001 World Grand Prix. Another second round exit in the World Championship followed though. Smith played in the first Las Vegas Desert Classic in 2002, losing in the first round to Simon Whatley. He also lost in the first round of the 2002 World Matchplay but followed up by reaching the semi-finals of the Bob Anderson Classic and the quarter-finals of the World Grand Prix as well as the 2003 World Championship.\nSmith made three quarter final showing in major tournaments in 2003, in the Desert Classic, World Matchplay and the World Grand Prix but lost in the second round of the 2004 World Championship. Another quarter final in the Desert Classic in 2004 was followed up by a spell of poor form as Smith began battling personal problems while going through a divorce. Though he reached the quarter-finals of the World Matchplay and the semi-finals of the World Grand Prix in 2005, poor performances in floor events saw Smith slide down the rankings. Smith reached the second round in the 2006 PDC World Darts Championship. It would begin a complete loss of form for Smith where poor performances including a second round exit from the 2006 UK Open forced him to qualify for major tournaments. He qualified for the 2006 Las Vegas Desert Classic, losing in the first round to Dennis Priestley. He then suffered a first round defeat in the World Matchplay and failed to qualify for the World Grand Prix and then failed to qualify for the World Championship for the first time.\nSmith qualified once again for the Desert Classic. He was knocked out in the quarter-final by Part after beating Priestley and Darin Young. He then qualified again for the Desert Classic in 2008, but lost in the first round to James Wade.\nHe qualified for the 2009 PDC World Darts Championship, winning four matches at the qualifiers in Telford to take one of the last eight places at the Alexandra Palace. He caused a major surprise by beating number five seed Terry Jenkins in the first round. He then defeated Kevin McDine in the second round, coming from three sets to nil down to level the match at three sets all and eventually won the match 4–3. He would go out in round three, losing 4–1 to Mervyn King.\nAs of March 2016 he has not participated in any darts event."

        "title": "2007 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 20",
        "text": "These are the profiles for the individual stages in the 2007 Tour de France, with Stage 11 on 19 July, and Stage 20 on 29 July.\nStage 11.\nThis was the first of two transition stages between the Alps and the Pyrenees, with no climbs.\nRobbie Hunter took the stage when he powered for the line and held off Fabian Cancellara after a number of sprinters crashed in the final kilometre on a tight corner.\nFrench favourite Christophe Moreau finished more than three minutes after the leaders. He was caught napping when Astana hit the front shortly after going through the feed zone in Arles. Despite the best efforts of his AG2R team Moreau could not bridge the gap, which increased steadily as the leaders set a relentless pace. On a day in which no movement was expected at the top of the General Classification, Moreau, who crashed early in the stage, slipped from sixth to 14th after coming in three minutes 20 seconds back.\nMichael Rasmussen kept clear of danger on the 182.5 km flat route from Marseille to Montpellier to maintain his hold on the yellow jersey. And it looked as if Tom Boonen would tighten his grip on the green jersey with Erik Zabel off the pace, but the Belgian lost momentum on the fringes of the crash in the final kilometre and eventually came home 37th. New Zealander Julian Dean hit the deck along with Iker Camaño, Sebastien Hinault, Marcel Sieberg and Fränk Schleck.\nStage 12.\nThis was another transition stage heading west to Castres, with a category 2 climb just 40 km from the finish. The terrain was expected to offer some opportunities for the attackers but ending in a sprint at the finish line.\nThe first attack of the day to get away happened at about the 52 km mark when Amets Txurruka and Pierrick Fédrigo broke away from the peloton. A couple of chases, including a solo effort by Marcus Burghardt, briefly got away but were soon reeled in by the peloton.\nShortly after the descent from the category 2 climb near the finish, the pace set by Française des Jeux and Lampre–Fondital at the front of the peloton, in an effort to catch Txurruka and Fédrigo, became so blisteringly fast that some riders willingly dropped off the back of the peloton, knowing that by dropping off so close to the finish line they would not risk being disqualified.\nTxurruka and Fédrigo proved much more difficult to catch than first thought; as the peloton neared them within 10 km to the finish line, it was calculated that the catch would occur between 2 and 3 km to the line. The two valiantly fought on and wound up being caught just as the peloton reached the 1 km to go mark, leading to a classic bunched sprint at the finish, where the top three men in the points classification standings were the first three to the line.\nStage 13.\nThis was the first individual time trial since the prologue and was relatively flat with a twisty downhill finish.\nAn early downpour of rain saturated the road and made for dangerous conditions for many of the early riders. Reigning world time trial champion (and winner of the Prologue time trial) Fabian Cancellara had extreme difficulty negotiating a right-hand turn around the 30 km mark and lost most of his speed, before eventually crashing and losing a great deal of time. Others also fell at this turn.\nCofidis' Bradley Wiggins rode through the rain to set the first time to beat, that stood for most of the day. Alexander Vinokourov lead at every time check and shattered Wiggins' final time by more than two minutes. It is likely, however, that his performance was aided by drugs.\nGeneral classification leader Michael Rasmussen was expected to lose a great deal of time, having had one of the worst time trials ever for a top-flight professional in the 2005 Tour de France. He finished 11th originally, much better than expected, and was upgraded to 10th when Vinokourov was disqualified, though his own premature exit from the Tour days later casts doubt on this performance.\nThe rain let up by the time there were about 40 riders left to leave the starthouse, though the course still remained more treacherous than it would have been had the day been completely dry.\nVinokourov originally won the stage in 1h 06'34\", but on April 30, 2008, he was officially stripped of the victory due to his subsequent positive test for blood doping.\nStage 14.\nThe race headed into the Pyrenees. This stage started with a category 2 climb out of Mazamet and then followed a relatively calm route via Carcassonne, Limoux and Quillan before taking on the Port de Pailhères (17 km at 7.2%) and a very difficult finish at Plateau-de-Beille (16 km at 7.9%).\nA six-man breakaway formed out of a group that at first numbered 27. That 27-man group featured race leader Michael Rasmussen and his King of the Mountains rival Mauricio Soler. The six who went forward attained a maximum advantage before the Saunier Duval and Rabobank squads set to reeling them in. Their pace proved fast enough that the autobus formed almost immediately as the peloton started the ascent up the Port de Pailhères.\nMore splits occurred on the later climbs in the course, with the yellow jersey group, paced by Rasmussen's teammates, numbering some 45 riders for most of the stage.\nRasmussen attacked on the ascent to the Plateau-de-Beille, and only Alberto Contador could stay with him. They caught every member of the leading break. Soler had earlier taken the lead in the King of the Mountains, but Rasmussen retook it at the Plateau-de-Beille, though Contador outsprinted Rasmussen to the finish line.\nStage 15.\nThis was thought to be one of the major stages of the Tour, with no fewer than five major mountain passes – including the Col de Port, the Col de Portet d'Aspet (5.7 km climb at 6.9%), the Col de Menté (7.0 km climb at 8.1%), the Port de Balès (19.5 km at 6.2%), (the first time this climb was featured in the Tour), and finally the Col de Peyresourde (9.7 km climb at 7.8%) with a downhill finish in Loudenvielle.\nAn early 2-man break was joined by a 23-man chase group to form a leading group of 25 that represented 17 teams. Notables in this group included Alexander Vinokourov, the original stage winner, Kim Kirchen, was upgraded to the stage victory upon Vinokourov's disqualification, and Haimar Zubeldia, whose second place on the stage vaulted him into the top ten in the General Classification, as well as George Hincapie, Denis Menchov, and Bernhard Kohl.\nMany splits occurred on the way up the Col de Peyresourde, with Vinokourov taking a quick 30 second lead over his breakaway mates, holding on to that advantage to be the original stage winner. Michael Rasmussen and Alberto Contador traded attack after attack from the group they had been in, catching most of the early break, finishing in the top ten of the stage, and gaining time over other contenders such as Cadel Evans, Levi Leipheimer, Andreas Klöden, and Carlos Sastre, who were left in the remnants of the group they had left.\nVinokourov originally won the stage in 5h 34'28\", but on April 30, 2008, he was formally stripped of the victory due to his positive test for blood doping the next day.\nRest day 2.\nNews of a failed blood doping test by Astana rider Alexander Vinokourov after Stage 15 filtered through late on Monday evening. On Tuesday, the rest day, Marc Biver announced that the entire Astana squad remaining in the Tour would be withdrawn. Two of their riders, Andreas Klöden (5th) and Andrey Kashechkin (8th), were in the top 10. This altered the general classification standings.\nCorrected General classification after stage 15\nStage 16.\nAfter a rest day, the riders took in the Tour's hardest stage, and the last chance for the climbers to make the time gains they’d need before the final time trial. The race was thought to split up somewhat on the brutal Port de Larrau (14.7 km climb at 8.1%), despite the fact that its summit came just 79 km into the stage. The race dipped into Spain for some 50 kilometres at the summit, the fourth country visited in this year's Tour. From there, there was little reprieve for the riders, hitting the Alto Laza and the Col de la Pierre St Martin (14.2 km climb at 5.2%) before descending to the start of the difficult, and very steep, first-category Col de Marie-Blanque (9.3 km climb at 7.4%). The riders then climbed the infamous Col d'Aubisque (16.7 km climb at 7%), which rewarded out-and-out climbing ability and punish the legs of all the major contenders.\nThe Basque separatist group ETA carried out at least 1 explosion along the route near the town of Belagua. However the riders had already gone past that point and no one was hurt.\nAn early attack by Stéphane Augé, one-time holder of the polka-dot jersey during this Tour, was answered by José Vicente García, Gorka Verdugo and Christophe Rinero. As Verdugo, 67th and more than 90 minutes behind Michael Rasmussen, was the best-placed man in this break the peloton was more than happy to let them go. Barloworld set to pacing the peloton after the escape, with Rabobank staying close behind them.\nMauricio Soler came free from the peloton before the first climb of the day and took full points available to him, taking the lead outright in the King of the Mountains from Rasmussen. He and Carlos Sastre, for whom it was something of a surprise that he was able to get away from the peloton easily as he was 5th in the GC at the beginning of the day, worked together to stay away as long as possible. They wound up being caught with 11 kilometers left to race by a group containing Rasmussen, Alberto Contador, Levi Leipheimer, and numerous domestiques from their teams. Rasmussen came clear of this group on the way up the Aubisque to win the stage. It was thought at the time that this all but cinched his victory in the Tour, since only flat stages and an individual time trial remained, and that even a relatively weak time trialist like Rasmussen was unlikely to lose three to five minutes.\nWithdrawals.\nFollowing stage 16, Cofidis rider, Cristian Moreni, was arrested by French police after testing positive for synthetic testosterone after stage 11. With this, the entire Cofidis team withdrew the rest of their team from the Tour. Later that evening, news broke that overall leader, Michael Rasmussen, was withdrawn from the Tour by his Rabobank team due to allegedly lying about his whereabouts during a three-week training session in Mexico in which he was unavailable for UCI doping controls. This elevated Alberto Contador to the overall lead of the race. However, as this occurred after the jersey presentations of Stage 16, there would be no \"maillot jaune\" wearer on Stage 17.\nGeneral Classification at start of Stage 17\nStage 17.\nThe race left the mountains behind and turned north towards Paris. This stage had a series of small climbs, but was expected to give those sprinters who had survived the chance to earn some points.\nAt the 9 km mark and after a few attempted escapes, an eight-man break, including team leaders David Millar and Daniele Bennati, got away, but their lead was restricted for a long time to about two minutes by the peloton. The pace was being made by the \"virtual\" leader's team Discovery and Predictor–Lotto, despite the fact that no threat to the GC was posed: Jens Voigt, 34th overall and over an hour behind Alberto Contador, was the best placed man in the break. Caisse d'Epargne made the pace in earnest for a while. It was thought at the time that they wanted to try to keep their second position in the team classification, but their directeur sportif said the next day that they simply wanted to try to win the stage. The move was extremely unpopular within the peloton, with riders like Tom Boonen and Cadel Evans speaking up about it.\nDenis Menchov abandoned the Tour two hours into the stage. The Caisse d'Epargne riders dropped when the break extended to four minutes over the peloton, and Discovery retook the workload. The lead of the break extended more and more; essentially Discovery was content to let them go. When the lead ballooned to eight minutes, it was calculated, given the flat course, the peloton could not make the gap up even if they wanted to. A bunched sprint for ninth place and the 17 green jersey points it afforded was still expected.\nWith about 18 km, Daniele Righi and Manuel Quinziato were dropped by the leading group after an attack from Bennati; not long after, Millar and Matteo Tosatto were also dropped, leaving a leading group of four – Voigt, Bennati, Markus Fothen, and Martin Elmiger. Voigt took almost all of the workload. At just under 4 km to go, Voigt attacked the group, but Bennati bridged the gap. They tried to break away from Fothen and Elmiger but could not.\nBennati, easily the strongest sprinter in the break, got to the line first. Tom Boonen, holder of the green jersey, made it to the line ahead of his rivals Robert Hunter and Erik Zabel.\nStage 18.\nThis was a long stage, with a few small climbs near the start, and was regarded as the last chance for any surprises.\nAround 17 km into the stage, Michael Boogerd and Laurent Lefèvre launched the first successful attack of the day. They distanced themselves from the Discovery-led peloton that again seemed content to let the break get away, opting instead to protect Alberto Contador for the next day's individual time trial. The teams of the green jersey contenders also seemed fine with competing merely for fifth place rather than the 35 points given to the stage winner.\nThe two were quickly joined by a counter-attack from Axel Merckx and Sandy Casar; Boogerd and Lefevre sat up and allowed those two to join them. Casar struck a dog on the road when he and Frederick Willems were chasing Boogerd and Lefevre, and both of them went down. Casar got up quickly, but Willems was slower and wound up being absorbed by the peloton. The crash resulted in Casar tearing his gear and having to ride with a nasty wound on his exposed buttocks, since dropping off to change and have the wound treated would cost him his position. Later, the race doctor's car made it up to the leading group to tend to Casar's hip and right elbow, as well as a bee sting sustained by Boogerd.\nThe lead of the breakaway grew upwards of 17' 30\". With Boogerd challenging the top-ten GC places of Haimar Zubeldia and Mikel Astarloza on the road, Euskaltel–Euskadi came to the front of the peloton to take the workload when the leaders were around 28 km to the line. The gap more steadily fell from that point on, successfully knocking Boogerd out of the top ten.\nAs the breakaway neared the finish, the riders traded attacks, but there was no real beginning to the closing sprint. A quick closing kick from Casar gave him the stage win, with a 1-second gap over his mates. Boonen's Quick Step team came forward in the final two kilometers to lead him out, with Robert Hunter and Erik Zabel right in the mix. Boonen again made it to the line ahead of his rivals, essentially clinching the green jersey win. The peloton split on the way up the slight uphill finish, giving Cadel Evans and Yaroslav Popovych, among others, three seconds back on Contador.\nStage 19.\nThis was the second time trial stage, with long straight stretches, some beautiful sections of unbending road and some slight inclines (with one located about 600 m to the finish line). It was clear that time-trial specialists would be the center of attention. After an impressive performance during the Pyrenees crossing and the capture of the yellow jersey due to Michael Rasmussen's dismissal, Alberto Contador expressed his concerns about being beaten in the final time trial of the competition. Before the riders located above the 20th place started, Belgian Leif Hoste set a time of 1h 05' 32\", making him the 1st ranked rider of the stage for a long period of time. Nonetheless, with the start of the favourites for the stage, he gradually went down through the standings, finishing in 9th position. David Millar, who was expected to be a contender for victory, experienced mechanical trouble, needing to change bikes twice within the first kilometer.\nThree teams dominated the time trial: Discovery Channel, Caisse d'Epargne and Predictor–Lotto. Vladimir Karpets, current Spanish time trial champion, Iván Gutiérrez and Óscar Pereiro secured 3rd, 6th and 8th positions respectively for Caisse d'Epargne. On the other hand, Discovery Channel and Predictor–Lotto set up a fierce fight for the overall standings, primarily involving Alberto Contador, Levi Leipheimer and Cadel Evans. Of the top three GC riders, Leipheimer was the first off the start ramp followed by Evans and Contador. Leipheimer dominated the time trial, passing his three-minute man, Carlos Sastre, and shattering everyone's time at each intermediate time check before beating Karpets' time at the finish by almost two minutes. On the course, Evans needed to gain two seconds per kilometer on Contador in order to take the maillot jaune but he fell short of his goal by 23 seconds. He eventually completed the course in 1h 03' 35\", 51 seconds behind Leipheimer. After Leipheimer and Evans completed the course, Contador needed to cross the finish line within 1h 05' 25\" in order to keep the yellow jersey. In the end, he crossed the line in a time of 1h 05' 02\", just enough to keep the yellow jersey heading into the final flat ceremonial stage to Champs-Élysées in Paris, putting him on the verge of winning his first Grand Tour.\nSix years later, Leipheimer's results from this year's Tour were stripped.\nStage 20.\nThe grand finale, as the race entered Paris to complete the eight laps of the traditional circuit around the Champs-Élysées.\nThe ride to the Champs-Élysées is traditionally free of attacks prior to the famous avenue, and the GC standings from the previous stage usually stand as the final result, as only sprinters (who are very low in the GC at this point) will usually attack. However, with only 31 seconds separating the top three men, there was much speculation that that would not be the case during this final stage.\nHowever, the peloton proved to stay together all the way until the Champs-Élysées, except for brief escapes to nab the final intermediate sprint and two small climbs. Tradition held up; Discovery successfully led Contador onto the famous street before the sprinting began. Freddy Bichot briefly got away on the second circuit. Chris Horner of Cadel Evans' Predictor–Lotto team tried to get away soon after, but the peloton was much less willing to let him leave. When Alejandro Valverde and Axel Merckx counter-attacked Bichot to bring him back into the field, Discovery faded back.\nA ten-man group formed a measurable break over the peloton during the third circuit. Barloworld came to the front of the peloton to try to bring the break back. The catch occurred on the final circuit.\nDaniele Bennati won the last sprint to the line. Maillot jaune wearer, Alberto Contador, finished safely within the peloton to win the Tour overall, his first Grand Tour victory. The other classification leaders also crossed the line safely to confirm their win in their respective classifications. The traditional prize-giving commenced shortly after the race."

        "text": "Anthony Andrew Jones (born May 16, 1960) is an American football coach and former player. He was most recently the head football coach at Elizabeth City State University, a position he has held from 2018 to 2021. He served as head coach at Morehouse College from 1999 to 2001, and Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University from 2002 to 2013. Jones played eight seasons as a tight end in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins and San Diego Chargers during the 1980s. He was a member of the Redskins' 1987 Super Bowl championship team.\nPlaying career.\nJones initially attended the University of Maryland Eastern Shore but then transferred to Wichita State University where he played for head coach Willie Jeffries. He earned several honors as a tight end, including the Ben Hustle Award (1981) and All-Missouri Valley Conference recognition (1983). Following his senior season with the Shockers, Jones was selected in the eleventh round of the 1984 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. He went on to play eight seasons for the team, helping to win a Super Bowl championship in 1987. The Redskins traded him to the San Diego Chargers during the 1988 season, but Jones was forced to retire after suffering a knee injury before the next season.\nCoaching career.\nMorehouse.\nJones's first head coaching job was at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, where he spent four years. After serving as the offensive coordinator and assistant head coach in his first year with the Maroon Tigers, he was promoted to head coach in 1999. After going 2–8 in his first season, Jones led the Tigers to the first back-to-back eight-win seasons in school history. He was named SIAC Coach of the year both times. The 2000 campaign (8-3) qualified him and the Tigers as the second-most improved team in NCAA Division II.\nFollowing his second consecutive eight-win season (8-2), Jones was one of three finalists for the 2001 Eddie Robinson Coach of the year Award along with Doug Williams (Grambling State) and Rick Comegy (Tuskegee).\nAlabama A&amp;M.\nIn 2006, Jones led the Bulldogs to their first SWAC title and tied the school record with nine victories. The Bulldogs posted back-to-back nine-win seasons in 2005 and 2006. The 2006 SWAC Coach of the year has led A&amp;M to four SWAC title games in nine seasons and enters the 2011 campaign with an 82–54 career record.\nWith his 79–47 record while at Alabama A&amp;M, Jones' 79 wins at A&amp;M rank second all-time behind legendary A&amp;M coach Louis Crews, who won 93 games at A&amp;M. In 2005, Jones led the Bulldogs to their second SWAC East Championship under his reign, and a 9–3 record. The nine wins also earned Jones a milestone victory in the regular season finale, a 31–16 win at Prairie View served as the 50th win in Jones' career.\nAfter the Bulldogs posted tremendous 8-4 records in each of his first two seasons in 2002 and 2003, the team from the Rocket City capped off another outstanding season in 2004 with a 7–4 mark. With a 21–7 victory in the Magic City Classic Jones is 7–2 in his nine seasons against in-state rival Alabama State. The 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009 teams also captured the John Merritt Classic title, defeating Tennessee State in the season-opener. Alabama A&amp;M remains the only visiting team to have beaten Tennessee State in the John Merritt Classic's history.\nThree times, Jones has led A&amp;M to six-game winning streaks in his tenure. After two early losses in 2002, Jones' Bulldogs won six straight and eight of nine to finish the regular season. The Bulldogs captured the SWAC East (6-1). This led to A&amp;M's second berth in the SWAC championship in three years. In 2005, after a disappointing Homecoming loss to Texas Southern, the Bulldogs regrouped and won six straight games to finish the regular season en route to another SWAC East title and a berth in the SWAC Championship game. The 2009 season saw three two game win streaks and victories over Jackson State (13-5) and Mississippi Valley (17-12) in the final two contest of the season to earn Jones his fourth SWAC East championship and title game appearance.\nJones has led A&amp;M to five division championships in his 11 years as head coach - the most successful run in the history of the SWAC championship game.\nOn December 1, 2013, it was announced that Jones would not return as Alabama A&amp;M head coach. Jones served as Alabama A&amp;M football coach for 12 seasons.\nElizabeth City State.\nOn April 2, 2018, Jones was named as the head football coach for the Elizabeth City State University Vikings. ECSU competes in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA).\nFamily.\nJones' son Julian was a top football recruit out of Hazel Green High School in Alabama. The 16-year-old junior committed suicide on October 6, 2014. Several Division I college football programs recruited him and two schools (Mississippi and South Carolina) had already extended scholarship offers to him."

        "title": "José Calderón (basketball)",
        "text": "José Manuel Calderón Borrallo (; born September 28, 1981) is a Spanish basketball executive and former player who is a special advisor for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played professionally for 21 years including 14 seasons in the NBA, primarily with the Toronto Raptors\nwith whom he set an NBA record for the highest free throw percentage in a season (98.1% in 2008/09). With the Spain national team, he won a FIBA World Cup title in 2006, two Olympic silver medals in 2008 and 2012, as well as a bronze medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics. He also won a EuroBasket title in 2011, two silver medals in 2003 and 2007 as well as a bronze in 2013. Calderón earned an All-EuroBasket Team selection in 2007.\nEarly life and European career.\nJosé Calderón was born and raised in the town of Villanueva de la Serena, in Spain. His main inspiration for basketball came from his father, who used to play basketball for his hometown's team, Doncel La Serena. Calderón received an offer to play professional basketball after he won a junior team championship.\nAfter playing for Diputación Foral Alava, Calderón joined Lucentum Alicante (Spanish Second Division) in 1999, and he led his team to the ACB (Spanish First Division). The team had to return to the second division because of fierce competition. This helped Calderón adapt to the competition, and catalyzed an improvement to his game.\nIn 2001, Calderón joined ACB team Fuenlabrada. He averaged 9.7 points, and 1.7 assists in 18.6 minutes per game, and shot 83.2% from the free throw line. By the end of the season, he joined the Spain national team. In 2002, he played for the senior Spain national team in the 2002 FIBA World Championship at Indianapolis, where his team ended up in fifth place.\nAfter the summer, Calderón signed with TAU Vitoria. Calderon played three seasons with Tau Vitoria. His team won the Spanish Basketball King's Cup, and were also runners-up in both the Liga ACB (Spanish League) and the EuroLeague. In 2002–03, he averaged 7.5 points, 2.4 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.1 steals in the EuroLeague. In 2003–04, he averaged 7.2 points, 1.4 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 1.1 steals in the EuroLeague. In 2004–05, he averaged 11.6 points, 3.4 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.5 steals in the EuroLeague.\nNBA career.\nToronto Raptors (2005–2013).\nRookie season.\nCalderón entered the NBA when former Raptors GM Rob Babcock persuaded the Spanish guard to sign with the Toronto Raptors on August 3, 2005. Known as a talented playmaker, he struggled with his shooting in his first year in the NBA. By the end of the 2005–06 season, he was ranked third among all rookies in assists with 4.5 per game. He finished the season with 64 played games, having started in 11 of them. He averaged 5.5 points, 4.5 assists, 2.2 rebounds and an assists-per-turnover ratio of 2.85.\n2006–07 season.\nThroughout the 2006–07 season, Calderón played primarily as backup to T. J. Ford, turning in solid numbers from the bench. As acknowledged by coach Sam Mitchell as well as his teammates, Calderón's form was instrumental to the Raptors' push for a playoff spot, and later, the Atlantic Division title. He ended his regular season with improved averages of 8.8 points and 5.1 assists per game and .525 in field goal percentage, even though he had less playing time compared to his rookie season. In the 2007 NBA Playoffs, Calderón played in all of Toronto's games in the series against the New Jersey Nets, but the Raptors were defeated 4–2. Calderón averaged 13.0 points and 5.3 assists per game in his first NBA playoff season.\n2007–08 season.\nToronto continued to deploy Ford and Calderón in tandem for the point guard position to good effect. Ford was injured for several games in November and December and the Spaniard stepped in with impressive performances. In three games against the Memphis Grizzlies, Cleveland Cavaliers and Chicago Bulls, Calderón provided 37 assists while committing only three turnovers. 14 games into the season, he was also leading the league in assist-to-turnover ratio with 5.67 to 1, but even so, he said: \"But how I feel about the team right now is that we need T.J. Ford [for the next game].\" 35 games into the season, the Spaniard increased the turnover ratio to 6.15 to 1, setting him on course to break an NBA record (he went to end the season as the league-leader with 5.38 to 1). He shot at least 50% on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws, and is sometimes listed as a member of the NBA's 50–40–90 Club, even though he was sixteen free-throws shy of attaining the NBA league minimum number of makes in this category. By mid-season, he was touted as a possibility for making the All-Star reserve team. Even after Ford returned from injury for the final third of the campaign, Calderón was able to keep his place in the starting lineup. Ford had initially agreed to playing backup, but reportedly became frustrated at not being able to start. Calderón eventually asked the coaching staff to play Ford as starter instead, leading to widespread praise from the coaching staff, teammates, and fans. Given that he was going to become a free agent by the end of the campaign, there were even calls for Ford to be traded so that the team could be built around Calderón as point guard. By the end of the regular season, Calderón was fifth in the league for assists per game, and in the 2008 NBA Playoffs, Ford split the playing time with him about equally, with the two players combining for averages of 23.4 points and 13.6 assists per game. However, the Raptors were eliminated by the Orlando Magic in the first round four games to one.\n2008–09 season.\nOn July 9, 2008, Calderón re-signed with the Raptors to a multi-year deal, reported to be worth $7.5 million to $8.5 million a season. With the departure of Ford to the Indiana Pacers, the Spaniard was slated to start the point guard position for the Raptors. At the same time, new acquisition Jermaine O'Neal formed the frontcourt with Bosh. However, 17 games into the season, Toronto fired head coach Sam Mitchell and the line-ups were constantly shuffled. By the end of 2008, the Raptors were 12–20, but with Calderón out for almost a month thereafter, the team slipped to 16–28. When Calderón returned to the Raptors lineup, he helped snap a seven-game losing streak with a 114–94 victory over Chicago, recording 23 points on 9-of-10 shooting and 10 assists. Not long after, he set the second-longest streak in NBA history for consecutive free throws made (87). On March 13, 2009, Calderón surpassed Alvin Williams' franchise record for career assists with 1795. On March 29, 2009, in a game against Chicago, he tied the franchise record for most assists in game with 19, and not long after, set an NBA record for highest free-throw percentage in a season. These records, however, were overshadowed by the Raptors rapidly falling out of the playoffs picture soon after the All-Star break, and the criticism Calderón faced for being unable to defend and play an up-tempo game. Toronto eventually finished with a 33–49 record, with the Spaniard leading the Eastern Conference in assists per game and the league in free throw percentage and assist-to-turnover ratio.\n2009–10 season.\nThe Raptors underwent a significant roster overhaul in the preseason, such as bringing Jarrett Jack from Indiana to play as Calderón's back-up and point forward Hedo Türkoğlu to share in ball-handling duties. With a third of the season gone, the Spaniard picked up an injury that put him out for 12 games, resulting in Jack holding on to the starting spot even upon the former's return, paralleling the Ford-Calderón scenario in 2007–08. Still, the pair combined well and helped bring the Raptors to a 21–20 record at the mid-season mark.\nDuring the early stages of the 2010 offseason, the Raptors had a deal in place to send Calderon and Reggie Evans to the Charlotte Bobcats for Tyson Chandler and Boris Diaw. However, Michael Jordan, the owner of the Bobcats, nixed the deal right before it was finalized, which allowed Calderon to remain with the Raptors.\n2010–11 season.\nCalderón was ranked fifth in assists per game (8.9) at the conclusion of the regular season.\n2011–12 season.\nOn February 12, 2012, Calderón scored a career high 30 points in a 94–92 loss against the Lakers. Calderón led the league in assists per turnover (4.5) for the third time in five years at the conclusion of the regular season.\nDetroit Pistons (2013).\nOn January 30, 2013, Calderón was traded to the Detroit Pistons in a three-team trade which sent Tayshaun Prince, Austin Daye, and Ed Davis to the Memphis Grizzlies and Rudy Gay and Hamed Haddadi to Toronto. He became the starting point guard for the Pistons, and in just his fourth game for the franchise, he recorded 23 points and 10 assists in the 105-100 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.\nCalderón finished the season averaging 11.3 points and 7.1 assists per game. He also led the league in three-point shooting percentage (.461) and was second in assists per turnover (4.1).\nDallas Mavericks (2013–2014).\nOn July 11, 2013, Calderón signed with the Dallas Mavericks to a reported four-year, $28 million contract. He became the Mavericks lead point guard, starting in 81 games. He had his best game on December 20, 2013 against his former team, the Toronto Raptors, where he recorded 23 points and 9 assists. Calderón finished the season averaging 11.4 points and 4.7 assists per game.\nNew York Knicks (2014–2016).\nOn June 25, 2014, Calderón, along with Shane Larkin, Wayne Ellington, Samuel Dalembert and two 2014 second-round picks, was traded to the New York Knicks in exchange for Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton. In the process, he re-joined former Raptor teammate Andrea Bargnani. After a preseason injury kept him on sidelines for the first 13 games of the season, he made his Knicks debut on November 22, 2014 as he recorded 3 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals in the 91-83 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.\nOn March 23, 2015, Calderón was ruled out for the rest of the season after undergoing a procedure on his strained left Achilles tendon.\nOn March 13, 2016, he made a game-winning three-point shot with 0.2 seconds left on the clock to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers.\nLos Angeles Lakers (2016–2017).\nOn June 22, 2016, Calderón was traded, along with Jerian Grant and Robin Lopez, to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Derrick Rose, Justin Holiday and a 2017 second-round draft pick. On July 7, he was traded again, this time with two future second-round picks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for the rights to Ater Majok. On December 5, 2016, he was ruled out for two to four weeks with a right hamstring strain. On February 27, 2017, he was waived by the Lakers.\nAfter being waived by the Lakers, Calderón was set to join the Golden State Warriors. However, after Kevin Durant suffered a possible season-ending knee injury, the Warriors felt they needed a forward instead of a point guard to fill Durant's role. The Warriors still honored their agreement with Calderón, signing him on March 1, 2017 before waiving him later that day. While he was only with the team for two hours, the Warriors agreed to pay Calderón the $415,000 he would have earned if he had been on the team for the rest of the season.\nAtlanta Hawks (2017).\nOn March 4, 2017, Calderón was claimed off waivers by the Atlanta Hawks.\nCleveland Cavaliers (2017–2018).\nOn July 10, 2017, Calderón signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers. On April 3, 2018, Calderón scored a season-high 19 points, and recorded 4 assists and 4 rebounds, during a 112–106 win over the Toronto Raptors.\nThe Cavaliers eventually made it to the 2018 NBA Finals, before losing 4–0 to the Golden State Warriors.\nReturn to Detroit (2018–2019).\nOn July 7, 2018, Calderón signed with the Detroit Pistons.\nExecutive career.\nOn November 4, 2019, the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) announced that Calderón had joined them as the special assistant to the executive director for the 2019–20 NBA season.\nOn January 14, 2022, Calderón was hired by the Cleveland Cavaliers as a special advisor to the front office.\nNational team career.\nCalderón enjoyed a successful international career. When he played for Spain's national youth team, he won the gold medal at the 1998 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, as well as the bronze medal at the 2000 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship. As his career advanced, the point guard began appearing for the Spain national team. Calderón was part of the Spain national team which finished fifth at the 2002 FIBA World Championship and second at the 2003 EuroBasket. He was later named the team captain during the 2004 Summer Olympics, and on September 3, 2006, Calderón and his Spanish squad defeated Greece, and won the 2006 FIBA World Championship, along with future Raptors teammate, Jorge Garbajosa. In 2007 EuroBasket, Calderón and Garbajosa again featured for the Spanish team. In the knockout stages, Calderón recorded a game-high 17 points as Spain defeated Germany 83–55 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, Calderón scored 18 points in Spain's defeat of Greece. The Spaniard led his team in points again in the final, but Spain lost 60–59 to Russia. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, Calderón was part of the squad that won the silver medal, but was injured and therefore could not play in the semifinal and the final games. He averaged 7.3 points per game in the tournament. Calderón won another silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. He also made Spain's squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but played only sparingly.\nAt the end of the Olympics, he announced his retirement from the national team.\nPlayer profile.\nCalderón is one of the best free throw shooters in the NBA, having set an NBA record for free throw shooting (98.1%) in 2008–09 with 151 of 154 attempts. Known as a highly efficient player, Calderon's 2007–08 season would have made him one of eight players in NBA history to shoot at or over 50% on field goals, 40% on three-point field goals, and 90% on free throws for a full season, but he did not have enough free throws made to qualify.\nPersonal life.\nOn March 2, 2007, the Raptors announced that Calderón had been named a Right To Play Athlete Ambassador. Right To Play is an athlete-driven international humanitarian organization that uses sport and play as a tool for the development of children and youth in the most disadvantaged areas of the world. As part of the program, Calderón pledged $1000 for every assist he recorded in a home game against the Chicago Bulls on November 26, 2007. He ended the game with 14 assists.\nCalderon is a co-owner of an organic pig farm.\nHe is married to Ana Hurtado. The couple welcomed their first child, Manuel, in Villanueva de la Serena on May 23, 2010."

        "title": "List of Puerto Rican boxing world champions",
        "text": "In Puerto Rico, boxing is considered a major sport, having produced more amateur and professional world champions than any other sport in its history. Puerto Rico ranks 5th worldwide between countries with most boxing world champions in history (only behind USA, Mexico, UK and Japan). Also, in year 2004, became the first country to have had, at least, one world champion in every single one of the 17 current boxing weight divisions throughout the history (Provided that John Ruiz is considered as Puerto Rican and not counting Bridgerweight division). Puerto Rico ranks first in champions per capita with an astonishing 16 in every one million people. February 9, 2008 was the first time that boxers from Puerto Rico had held three of the four major welterweights titles (World Boxing Association, International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Organization) when Carlos Quintana defeated Paul Williams to join Miguel Cotto, and Kermit Cintron as champions in the division.\nIndividually, Puerto Rican world champions have earned numerous achievements. These include, Wilfredo Gómez's record for most defenses in the super bantamweight division and for most successive knockouts by a titleholder. On March 6, 1976, at age 17, Wilfred Benítez became the youngest world champion in the history of the sport. On September 3, 1994, Daniel Jiménez established a world record for the quickest knockout in a championship fight, defeating Harald Geier in 17 seconds (currently the second fastest). Juan Manuel López is sixth in this category, having defeated César Figueroa in 47 seconds during his first defense. Ossie Ocasio was the first World Boxing Association (WBA) cruiserweight champion, winning it on February 13, 1982. This accomplishment was mimicked in other organizations: José de Jesús, José Ruíz Matos, John John Molina and Héctor Camacho did it in their respective divisions in the World Boxing Organization (WBO). On June 7, 2014, Miguel Cotto made history by becoming Puerto Rico's first four-division world champion. In women's boxing, Amanda Serrano was the first IBF super featherweight champion and the first Puerto Rican boxer (male or female) to win major world titles in seven different weight classes (Camacho made it first, but four of his titles were considered minor world titles). Also, in 2023, Serrano was the first Puerto Rican to be Undisputed world champion in a single division (featherweight), having won the four belts on each of the major boxing organizations (WBO,WBC,IBF and later WBA).\nBoxing in Puerto Rico.\nBoxing was introduced and practiced in a clandestine manner in Puerto Rico while the archipelago was still a Spanish colony. Fights were organized in haciendas among the workers of the sugar and coffee plantations, and the objective was to determine the best fighter among the employees. Following the culmination of the Puerto Rican Campaign and Spanish–American War, American soldiers who were stationed in the main island practiced the sport. During World War I, a championship known as \"Campeonato Las Casas\" was held as training for military personnel. Nero Chen, the first Puerto Rican boxer to gain recognition, began his career in these tournaments. The Combat Maneuver Training Center followed this example and organized boxing activities, which they named \"Los Campeones del Campamento\". These were received with enthusiasm by the young recruits. Most of these events were celebrated without restriction due to military jurisdictional limits, although prohibitions were put in place for the civilian population. Illegal matches were organized on the rooftops of residences in Old San Juan, empty terrain's in El Condado and in hippodromes.\nOutside of the island, legendary opera tenor Antonio Paoli, fell on economic hardship due to the closing of european opera houses during the first world war. He decided to change careers and entered a period of training making his boxing debut in London in 1916. Paoli won his first 5 fights but injured his wrist in his 6th bout, deciding to retire.\nThe fact that a celebrity of his stature, who had been bestowed honors for his musical prowess by the pope, the spanish monarchs and the russian czar, would so quickly choose boxing as an alternate career shows how popular and deeply embedded in the culture of the island boxing was, even during its clandestine era.\nBy 1924, several young men were being taught to box by Gregario Rosa, a boxer who had won the featherweight championship of the Atlantic Fleet while serving in the Navy. Rosa established \"Jack Dempsey Physical Culture and Boxing Club\", a gym where he continued instructing more pugilists; however, the local police department would go in and arrest any boxer that participated in a card (organized boxing match). At times they were surprised to discover that several members of the law enforcement agencies and government were involved. In one case they discovered a group of police officers, including a colonel, two members of the governor's cabinet, numerous legislators and a judge at an event. The charges were archived; the decision was justified with a statement that said: \"How will we have a boxing world champion if we don't let the boys learn how to box?\"\nIn 1926, a boxing venue was opened in a military facility known as \"Cuartel de Ballajá\"; a fight card was organized weekly. Legislator Lorenzo Coballes Gandía redacted a proposal to legalize boxing, which was signed by governor Horace Mann Towner in May 1927. Consequently, the \"Primera Comisión Atlética de Boxeo\" (The First Athletic Boxing Commission) was created; this became the first organization dedicated to sanctioned boxing in Puerto Rico. \"Estadio Universal\" (Universal Stadium) became the first venue to organize legal boxing cards. The first event featured a fight between Enrique Chaffardet and Al Clemens as the main event, which was declared a draw by the judges. New stadiums were built in Bayamón, Caguas, Mayagüez, Ponce, Aguadilla and San Juan. The first Puerto Rican to win a world championship was Sixto Escobar, who won it on June 26, 1934. During the 1960s and 1970s, there was an increase in the number of pugilists who achieved this recognition. Including Wilfred Benítez who on March 6, 1976, became the youngest world champion in history at 17 years old. This tendency continued during the following two decades, reaching its peak between the 1980s and 1990s. There was a slight decline in the 1990s. Félix Trinidad was Puerto Rico's most notable champion during this period. The 2000s brought another increase, as over a dozen boxers won world championships.\nHéctor García, Dommys Delgado Berty, Francisco Varcárcel and José Peñagaricano have served as presidents of the Puerto Rico Boxing Commission. This organization gained more prominence in 1985 when it received full control as the sanctioning body in any professional fight organized in Puerto Rico. In 2000, the commission's regulation was revised to exclude professional wrestling, which up to that point had been under its scope. This was Peñagaricano's first proposal on taking office, since he considered professional wrestling \"a spectacle instead of a sport like boxing\". During the following decades, the Puerto Rico Boxing Commission became the first governing body to have a female president when Delgado Berty served from 1986 to 1988. It became the first commission to require pre-fight weigh-ins, a measure that was at first criticized, but was later adopted by other boxing organizations. In 2007, David Bernier, then Secretary of Recreation and Sports, approved a new rule in the boxing organization's regulation that prohibited the signing of any pugilist younger than 18 years old as a professional. In 2011, women's boxing saw an increase in popularity, gaining mainstream attention. This was fueled by the championships won by Ada Veléz and Amanda Serrano, as well as Kiria Tapia becoming the first Pan American champion in her division."

        "text": "The 2007 PGA Championship was the 89th PGA Championship, played August 9–12 at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Defending champion Tiger Woods won his fourth PGA Championship and 13th major title, two strokes ahead of runner-up Woody Austin.\nVenue.\nSimilar to the upgrades it received prior to the 2001 U.S. Open, Southern Hills underwent extensive renovations to prepare for the 2007 PGA Championship, including new greens and renovated bunkers, as well as an upgrade to the clubhouse. A gripping the United States impacted playing conditions significantly. The high temperature for the four days of the tournament reached 101, 99, 99, and 102. Joking about the heat after hooking one of his drives into the trees, Colin Montgomerie said \"at least it's in the shade\".\nIt was the seventh major championship and fourth PGA Championship at Southern Hills; the three previous winners were Dave Stockton (1970), Raymond Floyd (1982) and Nick Price (1994). The U.S. Open winners were Tommy Bolt (1958), Hubert Green (1977), and Retief Goosen (2001).\nCourse layout.\nLengths of the course in previous major championships:\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, August 9, 2007\"\nGraeme Storm led the field after the first round by shooting a bogey-free 65 (−5). Storm is playing in his first PGA Championship. Defending champion Tiger Woods began his campaign for his 13th major victory by shooting a 71 (+1). Other notable scores include: John Daly, currently ranked 423rd in the world, shooting a 67 (−3); Brad Lardon shot the best round of the day among those who qualified for the tournament through the PGA Professional National Championship by shooting an even-par 70; U.S. Open champion Ángel Cabrera shot a disappointing 81 (+11), largely due to a septuple-bogey 10 on the par 3 6th hole; Retief Goosen, the last major champion at Southern Hills (2001 U.S. Open), shot an even-par 70 including an eagle and a double-bogey. The scoring average for the round was 74.29 (+4.29) with 12 players under par. The par 4 18th hole ranked the toughest with a scoring average of 4.49 (+0.49). The par 3 11th hole was the easiest of the day with a scoring average of 2.97 (−0.03), the only hole that played under par.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 10, 2007\"\nTiger Woods scored a 63, tying the record for the lowest single-round score at a major championship. The feat had been previously accomplished 22 times by 20 other players, and also tied the course record set by Raymond Floyd in the 1982 PGA Championship. His birdie putt on the 18th hole for the record outright horseshoed around the cup but did not fall. Local fan favorite and former Oklahoma State golfer Scott Verplank also had a good round with a score of 66. The cut was at 145 (+5) and 72 players advanced. Only two PGA club professionals made the cut. Jim Furyk and Vijay Singh were among those who missed the cut. The scoring average for the round was 72.80 (+2.80) with 24 players under par for the round.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 11, 2007\"\nTiger Woods stretched his lead to three strokes, and has held at least a share of the 54-hole lead in a major 13 times. He was in the final group of three out of the four major championships in 2007. Boo Weekley shot the low round of the day, a five-under par 65. Sergio García was disqualified after the third round for signing an incorrect scorecard. Had he signed it correctly, he would have been at 219 (+9) in a tie for 63rd place. The scoring average for the round was 71.92 (+1.92) with 15 players under par for the round.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 12, 2007\"\nTiger Woods claimed his fourth PGA Championship and improved to 13–0 in major championships when holding at least a share of the 54-hole lead. He led by as many as five strokes in the third and fourth rounds. However, his bogey on the 14th hole, coupled with Woody Austin's third consecutive birdie at the 13th, whittled Woods' lead down to a single stroke. Woods rebounded, however, with a birdie on the 15th hole, and then parred in to claim the championship. Simon Dyson shot the low round of the day with a 64 (−6). The scoring average for the round was 71.82 (+1.82) with 16 players under par for the round.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nTelevision.\nTelevision coverage in the United States was provided by TNT and CBS."

        "title": "Battery (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, the battery is the pitcher and the catcher, who may also be called batterymen, or batterymates in relation to one another.\nHistory.\nOrigins of the term.\nThe use of the word 'battery' in baseball was first coined by Henry Chadwick in the 1860s in reference to the firepower of a team's pitching staff and inspired by the artillery batteries then in use in the American Civil War. Later, the term evolved to indicate the combined effectiveness of pitcher and catcher.\nPitching to a preferred batterymate.\nThroughout the history of baseball, although teams have typically carried multiple catchers, star pitchers have often preferred the familiarity of working consistently with a single batterymate.\nIn the early 20th century, some prominent pitchers were known to have picked their favorite catchers. Sportswriter Fred Lieb recalls the batteries of Christy Mathewson / Frank Bowerman beginning in 1899 with the New York Giants, Jack Coombs / Jack Lapp beginning in 1908 with the Philadelphia Athletics, Cy Young / Lou Criger gaining the greatest attention in 1901 with the Boston Americans (later the Red Sox), and Grover Cleveland Alexander / Bill Killefer beginning in 1911 with the Philadelphia Phillies. Other successful batteries were Ed Walsh / Billy Sullivan beginning in 1904, along with Walter Johnson / Muddy Ruel and Dazzy Vance / Hank DeBerry both starting in 1923.\nIn 1976, several major league pitchers chose their preferred catchers; a notion that had fallen out of practice for some decades. For instance, catcher Bob Boone of the Philadelphia Phillies, though one of the best catchers of his day, was replaced with Tim McCarver at the request of pitcher Steve Carlton. The Carlton/McCarver combination worked well in 32 out of Carlton's 35 games that season, plus one playoff game. The two had previously been batterymates for four years (1966–69) with the St. Louis Cardinals. Another battery-by-choice was superstitious rookie pitcher Mark Fidrych who was new to the Detroit Tigers in 1976, insisting on rookie catcher Bruce Kimm behind the plate. The Fidrych/Kimm combination started all 29 of Fidrych's 1976 season games. The two continued as a battery through 1977.\nKnuckleballers have often preferred pitching to \"personal\" batterymates due to the difficulty of catching the unusual pitch. One notable example was Boston Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield and his preferred catcher, Doug Mirabelli.\nMost starts.\nThe below table shows battery-mates that have appeared in more than 200 starts together since 1914.\nEspecially notable are the five Hall of Fame batteries below, including Lefty Grove (ranked by Bill James as the second-greatest pitcher of all time) and Mickey Cochrane (ranked by James as the eighth-greatest catcher) of the 1925–1933 Philadelphia Athletics, and Yogi Berra and Whitey Ford, who appeared in multiple World Series together for the New York Yankees between 1950 and 1963.\nMost no-hitters.\nThe table below lists the battery combinations that share the record for most major league no-hitters (2).\n(*) Catchers Silver Flint and King Kelly shared catching duties for Corcoran's August 19, 1880 no-hitter.\nSibling batteries.\nThe following chart of major league sibling batteries lists pitcher/catcher siblings who played on the same major league team during a single major league season. The pair may or may not have performed as a battery in an actual major league game.\nUnique among those listed below are Mort and Walker Cooper, who formed the National League's starting battery at both the 1942 and 1943 Major League Baseball All-Star Games, and also appeared as a battery in the 1942, 1943, and 1944 World Series, the only sibling battery to achieve either feat.\nOther records and firsts.\nMost games.\nThe battery that appeared in the most games together was Mariano Rivera and Jorge Posada, with 598 games together for the New York Yankees between 1995 and 2011.\nMost wins.\nThe record for most team wins by a starting battery is 213 by Adam Wainwright and Yadier Molina.\nMost innings.\nRed Faber and Ray Schalk, who played together for the Chicago White Sox between 1914 and 1928, recorded the most total innings as a battery (2553.2).\nSingle-game records.\nMadison Bumgarner and Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants became the major league's first battery to hit grand slams in the same game when they accomplished the feat on July 13, 2014 against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The home run was pitcher Bumgarner's second grand slam of the season (April 11).\nFirst Black battery.\nPitcher George Stovey and catcher Moses Fleetwood Walker formed the first Black battery in professional baseball history when they teamed up for the 1887 Newark Little Giants of the International Association. The tandem recorded ten consecutive wins to begin the season before the Chicago White Stockings refused to take the field on July 15, leading to the league's implementation of the color line.\nFather-son batteries.\nFrank Duncan, Jr. and his son, Frank Duncan III, of the 1941 Kansas City Monarchs are thought to be the only father-son battery in major league history.\nIn 2012, former major leaguer Roger Clemens came out of retirement to pitch for the minor league Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, and formed a battery with his son Koby Clemens in a game on September 7."

In a ten-game series, the Monarchs narrowly defeated Hilldale 5 games to 4, with one tie game. It was the first World Series between the respective champions of the NNL and ECL. It was the second year of existence for the ECL, but no agreement could be reached in 1923 for a postseason series, owing primarily to unresolved disputes between the leagues. Five members of the Baseball Hall of Fame participated in the series: Biz Mackey, Judy Johnson, and Louis Santop played for Hilldale, while Bullet Rogan and José Méndez played for the Monarchs. In addition, Monarchs owner J. L. Wilkinson was also inducted into the Hall.\nThe Games.\nGame One.\nOctober 3, 1924, at National League Park in Philadelphia\nGame Two.\nOctober 4, 1924, at Baker Bowl in Philadelphia\nGame Three.\nOctober 5, 1924, at Maryland Baseball Park in Baltimore\nGame Four.\nOctober 6, 1924, at Maryland Baseball Park in Baltimore\nAfter yesterday's tie game, another game was rescheduled for the following day.

        "text": "The Bryant Bulldogs men's basketball team represents Bryant University in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The team currently competes in the America East Conference. They are led by head coach Phil Martelli Jr. and play their home games at the Chace Athletic Center.\nHistory.\nBryant University competed in the NAIA as an NAIA independent program from 1963 until 1976 as the Bryant College Indians before the college became a member of the NCAA Division II level in 1977. Bryant's most successful season during the college's tenure in the NAIA came in the 1966–67 season when the team recorded an undefeated regular season, going 22–0 before losing the final two games of the 1966–67 season in the District 32 Tournament. The 22–2 overall record was the team's best during the NAIA years. The 22 wins set a team high win streak that still stands as a school record as of 2012. And the 22 total wins was not eclipsed until the 2003–04 season.\nWithin a few seasons of transitioning to NCAA Division II, the college became a charter member of the Northeast-10 Conference in 1980.\nIn 2008, Bryant began the transition to Division I with former Ohio University coach Tim O'Shea. The 2012–13 season marked the first year Bryant was eligible for the postseason, in which they qualified for the 2013 College Basketball Invitational.\nO'Shea retired following the 2017–18 season and Jared Grasso was named head coach on April 2, 2018. Grasso orchestrated one of the nation's best turnarounds in his first season in Smithfield, improving the Bulldogs to a 10-win total after inheriting a squad that went 3–28 the prior season. Grasso was named a finalist for the Joe B. Hall Coach of the Year Award, given to the nation's top first-year head coach. The Bulldogs would continue to improve in 2019–20, rising to 15 victories including a win over Fordham in December. Grasso would then lead the Bulldogs to back-to-back Northeast Conference Championship games in 2020-21 and 2021–22, as well as winning the school's first ever NEC regular season championship in 2022. The 2022 NEC Championship game against Wagner resulted in not only Bryant winning their first ever NEC tournament championship, but they also clinched their first appearance in the NCAA Division I Tournament. This was Bryant's last season in the NEC, as the team moved to the America East Conference.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I Tournament results.\nBryant has made one appearance in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, with an overall record of 0–1.\nNCAA Division II Tournament results.\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in seven NCAA Division II Tournaments. Their combined record is 10–9.\nNAIA Tournament results.\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in one NAIA Tournament. Their record is 0–1.\nCBI results.\nThe Bulldogs have appeared twice in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI). Their record is 0–2.\nCoaches.\nBryant University has had nine basketball coaches during its history:\nIn 2015, Bryant University assistant basketball coach Chris Burns came out as gay, making him the first openly gay coach in Division I men's basketball."

        "title": "Ed Wells (baseball)",
        "text": "Edwin Lee Wells (June 7, 1900 – May 1, 1986), nicknamed \"Satchelfoot\", was an American baseball pitcher. He played professional baseball for 14 seasons from 1923 to 1936, including 11 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers (1923–1927), New York Yankees (1929–1932), and St. Louis Browns (1933–1934). Wells was a left-handed pitcher, with a hard fastball and a slow curve. Wells appeared in 291 major league games with a 68–69 record and won a World Series championship with the Yankees in 1932.\nEarly years.\nWells was born in Ashland, Ohio, in 1900. His father, Loyal Wells, was an Iowa native and a farmer. His mother, Elizabeth Wells, was an Ohio native. Wells played college baseball for Bethany College in West Virginia.\nProfessional baseball.\nDetroit Tigers.\nWells played the 1922 season in the minor leagues at Ludington, Michigan where he had a 1.93 earned run average (ERA).\nIn 1923, Wells made his major league debut with the Detroit Tigers on June 16, 1923. He appeared in seven games, all in relief, compiling a 5.40 ERA in 10 inning pitched. He returned to the Tigers in 1924, appearing in 29 games, 15 as a starter, with a 6–8 record and 4.06 ERA. In 1925, Wells appeared in a career high 36 games, 14 as a starter, and compiled a 6–9 record with a 6.18 ERA.\nWells had his best season with the Tigers in 1926. He appeared in 36 games, including a career high 26 games as a starter and 178 innings pitched. He compiled a 12–10 record and 4.15 ERA and led the American League with four shutouts. He had two consecutive shutouts in June 1926 during a 33-inning scoreless streak.\nWells' manager in Detroit was his boyhood idol, Ty Cobb. Though one of the greatest hitters of all time, Cobb was, by his own account, not a particularly good coach of pitchers. Cobb biographer, Richard Bak, recounts a discussion between Cobb and Wells. Wells was having a tough time and asked Cobb \"what in the name of sense do you think my trouble is.\" Cobb replied \"Ed, that's not something I know nothing about – pitching.\"\nBirmingham Barons.\nWells returned to the minor leagues, playing for the Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association in 1927 and 1928. He compiled a 13–1 record with a 2.13 ERA in 1927 and a 25–7 record with a 2.78 ERA in 1928.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn August 28, 1928, the New York Yankees purchased Wells' contract from the Birmingham club subject to the caveat that he would not report to the Yankees until the spring of 1929. Wells was assigned the locker between Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Wells compiled records of 13–9 in 1929 and 12–3 in 1930 as a Yankee. In 1929, Wells had the second most wins among Yankees' pitchers, trailing only George Pipgras. On August 31, 1929, Wells pitched a one-hitter as Babe Ruth hit two home runs. His 1930 winning percentage of .800 (12–3) was the second best in the American League. In 1931, his winning percentage or .643 was eighth best in the league. In his four years with the Yankees, Wells was supported by one of the best batting lineups in history, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Tony Lazzeri, Bill Dickey, Bob Meusel, Leo Durocher, and Earle Combs.\nSt. Louis Browns.\nIn April 1933, the St. Louis Browns purchased Wells from the Yankees. He played two seasons in St. Louis with a combined two-year record of 7–21. He played his final major league game on September 17, 1934.\nMinor leagues.\nIn November 1934, the Browns sold Wells to the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). He appeared in 39 games for Hollywood in 1935 and compiled a 9–20 record with a 4.33 ERA.\nWells began the 1936 season with the San Diego Padres of the PCL. In June 1936, the Padres traded Wells to the Seattle Indians in exchange for Howard Craghead.\nWells concluded his playing career in 1937 with the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association.\nLater years.\nWells was married to Annie M. Wells, a Tennessee native.\nAfter his baseball career ended, Wells went into business. In 1940, he lived in Birmingham, Alabama, where he was a partner in a wholesale petroleum products. Wells died in Montgomery in 1986 at age 85."

        "text": "The 1989 Ashes series was a series of Test cricket matches contested between England and Australia for the Ashes. It formed part of the 1989 Australian tour of England. The six-Test series began on 8 June 1989 at Headingley in Leeds and ended on 29 August 1989 at The Oval in London.\nAustralia won the series 4–0 to win the Ashes for the first time since 1982-83, and the first time in England since 1975. Australia would go on to retain the Ashes until 2005, winning four series at home and a further three in England during this period.\nThe one-sidedness of the series was highlighted by Australia only using 12 players for the whole series, compared with England using 29 players.\nSquads.\nEngland\nManager: Micky Stewart\nAustralia\nCoach: Bob Simpson\nMatch details.\nFirst Test.\nAustralia went into the First Test at Headingley as major underdogs having lost the previous two Ashes series both home and away, and also drawing the three match Texaco Trophy One Day International series to England. The English press had branded the tourists as 'possibly one of the worst sides to ever tour England'.\nBut the Australian side was full of young talented confident players, were led well by the gritty and determined Allan Border and had planned well for the series.\nThe match was evenly poised on the first morning of day one, but then brilliant batting by a young Mark Taylor and a coming of age by Steve Waugh who both scored centuries, took the Australians over 600 who confidently declared, and set the tone for the rest of the series. Australia were not dismissed for less than 400 all series.\nThe first Test was also marked by the re-emergence of Terry Alderman. After his brilliant 1981 Ashes series in which he took 42 wickets, he suffered serious injury, and a temporary ban for touring South Africa, but came back re-invented as a swing bowler for the 1989 Ashes and took 10 wickets in the first Test to lead Australia to a 210 run victory.\nDay One\nEngland won the toss and confidently sent the tourists in to bat on what looked a lively pitch, in fact as the day wore on, batting became easier and easier. Australia retained their new opening partnership of Geoff Marsh and Mark Taylor who was playing in just his third Test and had so far failed to cement his place in the order. The first session saw the pair nervously trying to see off the new ball, and England's decision to bowl looked a good one when the opening stand was broken for 44, Marsh out for 16. The second wicket only added 13, with Australian stalwart David Boon caught behind for 9 and Australia teetering.\nThe Australian captain Allan Border came to the crease and slowly at first, but then with gathering momentum, he went about restoring the Australian innings alongside Mark Taylor, who appeared to be growing in confidence as the day went on. By the third session they had added 120 before Border mis-timed and was caught out for a determined 66. Australia had reached a healthy 174 for 3. Dean Jones joined Mark Taylor and the pair added a further 33 to see Australia at 207 for 3 at stumps on day one, with Taylor having batted the whole day not out on 96.\nDay Two\nJones and Taylor resumed on the second morning with everybody watching to see if the young New South Wales batsman Taylor, could add the four runs he needed for his maiden Test century and he did not disappoint, bringing up his ton shortly after the resumption. It was not the most glamorous of centuries, but filled the young batsman with the confidence he needed to secure his place in the team for much of the next decade. Jones and Taylor batted throughout the morning taking Australia to 273 for 4 when Taylor was finally dismissed for 136.\nWhilst the Englishmen may have been delighted to see the back of centurion Taylor, they would later regret the arrival of his replacement Steve Waugh, who throughout the remainder of the second day played an astonishing array of strokes all around the wicket, exemplified by his signature square cut, and simply tore the English bowling to pieces.\nFirst with Dean Jones, eventually dismissed for 79, and with Merv Hughes after Ian Healy was dismissed for 16, Waugh battered the English bowling to be 174 not out and have Australia 580 for 6 at stumps on day two. The bowler Hughes also seemed filled with confidence from Waugh's display and remained with him on 63 not out. The partnership of Waugh and Hughes reached 147, a record for the 7th wicket in England.\nWhere Taylor's century had been workman-like, Waugh's was one of flair, hitting the boundary 24 times, and it saw the coming of age of a batman who had struggled in previous series, having not scored a century in the first four years of his Test career.\nDay Three\nEngland began the third day facing the gloomy prospect of a rampant Australia and gloomy skies as well. They had the consolation of dismissing the stubborn Hughes, but Australia soon passed 600 and captain Allan Border declared immediately at 601 for 7, with Steve Waugh undismissed on 177*.\nAlthough the score they were chasing seemed daunting, England set about their innings in a sensible fashion, and although they lost Graham Gooch and Chris Broad before lunch, Allan Lamb and Kim Barnett set about building a solid partnership of 184, before Barnett was adjudged LBW for 80, replays suggested that the ball from Terry Alderman might have missed leg stump.\nThis method of dismissal was Alderman's trademark during the 1989 Ashes. He had the ability to obtain just enough swing such that balls which looked as if they would miss leg stump would swing back late and trap batsmen as they played the ball to leg. Given Alderman bowled so close to the stumps, umpires were inclined to give decisions in Alderman's favour. This was clearly before the days of the \"hawkeye\" predictive path – though several decisions given in Alderman's favour throughout the series (of which Barnett's was one) would probably not have been given out at the time of writing (December 2009).\nAs they skies turned heavier, Alderman seemed to extract more and more swing and beat the bat throughout the afternoon. England were having difficulty playing him, but kept the scoreboard ticking over nonetheless. Geoff Lawson had English captain David Gower caught behind for 26 in the final session bringing South African born Robin Smith to the crease. Lamb reached his century just before stumps on day three and remained 103 not out over night, England having reached a healthy 284 for 4 in reply.\nDay Four\nEngland resumed on the fourth day looking to get as close as possible to Australia's score in the hope of bowling them out cheaply in the second innings, and set up an easy chase. Lamb moved on from his overnight 103 in much the same fashion as he had done the previous day. Smith joined in and the pair looked quite comfortable throughout the morning. Lamb was batting confidently and the pair took their partnership past 50. A short time later however, Lamb was undone by a brilliant trade-mark bat-pad catch by David Boon off Alderman's bowling. A short time later Derek Pringle, out LBW, became debutant Greg Campbell's first ever Test wicket, and his only victim of the whole tour.\nEngland who had been progressing nicely were teetering and 338 for 6. Smith and Phil Newport briefly stabilised the innings, before Smith was undone by yet another straight ball from Terry Alderman, trapping him LBW for 66. Gooch and Barnett had been dismissed with identical deliveries. Newport was joined by Jack Russell and the pair took England past 400, but the Australian bowlers had their tails up. Newport went for a well made 36, caught hooking by Boon off Lawson, and Phillip DeFreitas lasted just 6 balls before being undone by the fourth straight one Terry Alderman, also out LBW. Russell and Neil Foster added a further 6 runs before was caught by Geoff Marsh off Lawson leaving England all out for 430, 171 runs in arrears. Terry Alderman was the pick of the Australian bowlers with 5 for 107 for the innings.\nEngland felt they probably still had a chance of victory if they could pick up quick wickets, and set up a low final day run chase, but would otherwise be looking for the draw. Things began brightly for England when Geoff Marsh was caught behind for only 6 off Neil Foster's bowling. But from then on David Boon and Mark Taylor looked determined to put the game out of England's reach, until Taylor was out for a well made 60 leaving Australia at 97 for 2. Captain Allan Border came in and looked determined to lead from the front, scoring at a fast rate, and when Boon was out for 43, Dean Jones emerged from the dressing room looking even more determined. The pair moved along at a rapid rate, taking Australia to 158 for 3 at stumps.\nDay Five\nEngland began day five looking as though they were looking to drag the day out for a draw, but Jones and Border had other ideas. Resuming their free-scoring from the previous evening, the pair moved rapidly onwards, Jones scoring at better than a run-a-ball for a well made 40 not out off 34 balls. Although not quite as rapid, Border's 60 not out off 76 was still quite pacey, and the captain clearly had a plan in mind when he soon declared the Australian innings closed at 230 for 3, leaving England an unlikely 401 for victory off two sessions.\nThat particular session will be remembered for some of the worst bowling ever witnessed by England fans. The attack was blatantly tired (from 2+ days in the field) but displayed their lack of fitness by still being tired even after 2 days off (rest days on Sundays were still the case in 1989). The Australian batsmen scored at over a run a ball that morning as Gower was left with 3 bowlers. In his autobiography, Gower remarked how bad a game Newport had had such that he was allowed only 5 overs (which cost 22 runs) in the second innings. It should also be remembered that the chance of victory for Australia was slim at best – declaring only around an hour before lunch to take ten wickets. The England bowlers were therefore demotivated by the feeling of going through the motions during that hour and the result was the fast scoring which firmly ensured there could be only one winner.\nAlthough the draw was looking likely, the Australian bowlers sensed victory. Alderman soon had Chris Broad out LBW to a full ball which bounced only about 6 inches. A wild stroke saw Barnett caught at slip for 34, and Lamb, the centurion of the first innings out for 4, England looked to be in trouble at 77 for 3. David Gower offered brief resistance with a well made 34 before he was caught behind off Geoff Lawson, leaving England at 134 for 4, and then the tail crumbled completely. Robin Smith (0 off 3 balls), then opener Graham Gooch (68 off 118) who had looked reasonably comfortable, were soon followed by Derek Pringle (0 off 27 balls), Jack Russell (2 off 22 balls), Phil Newport (8 off 27 balls), and finally Phillip DeFreitas (21 off 18 balls). England had lost 6 wickets for 57 runs to be all out for 191. Terry Alderman claimed 5 for 44 in the second innings, giving him match figures of 10 for 151, his best Test career figures, and making him man of the match.\nAustralia had won the first Test by 210 runs, and led the 1989 Ashes series 1–0. The English press duly lambasted the side for their poor performance, especially David Gower who had inserted Australia and watched them amass 600 runs. The media called for instant changes demanding the head of Derek Pringle in particular.\nSecond Test.\nThe only change to the team that the Australians made for the entire series came when the disappointing Greg Campbell, with only one wicket in the first test, was dropped for Trevor Hohns for the second test. The Australians would retain the same line up for the rest of the series.\nIf the English team had learned any lessons from the First Test, it was that they, and the English press had vastly underestimated the abilities of Allan Border's well-picked young batting line-up who had scored over 800 runs between them at Headingley. So when David Gower won the toss again at Lord's he wasn't going to repeat his mistake of sending Australia in again. The irony this time being that cloudy skies prevailed and bowling would have been the better option. He chose to bat, but Hughes and Alderman had England three wickets down by lunch, including Gatting first ball to another bat pad catch (he had been out in a similar fashion during the Old Trafford Texaco game). Gooch made 60 and Gower 57 as the England batsmen seemed intent on attack. While this was reflected in a score of 280 well before the close of play, they lost all 10 wickets in getting there.\nAs was so often the case during 1989, when the Australians batted, the clouds disappeared and the pitches were largely good. They again piled on runs, quickly passing the English score by the middle of day three, with Steve Waugh's brilliant 152 not out leading them eventually to 528, despite excellent bowling by John Emburey, who claimed 4 for 88. An astonishing supporting cameo of 74 off 94 balls from the Australian number 10 Geoff Lawson enabled Waugh's heroics, and helped see the Australians over 500, and also remained Lawson's best ever test innings.\nA first innings lead of 242 placed great pressure on the English batsmen, but their combined experience counted when it was required, and their captain David Gower led the fight-back with a well made 106. Robin Smith was unluckily dismissed for 96. However it was again Terry Alderman's turn with 6 for 128, 4 of them LBWs achieved through either dead straight balls or – his speciality – the late swing from leg stump making them virtually straight balls that the batsmen played across. England had made a solid 359, but their first innings had let them down, and it left Australia with a comfortable target of 118 runs for victory on the last day.\nDay One\nEngland won the toss and chose to bat on what looked a good Lord's batting pitch. Alderman began from the pavilion end and was bowling into the breeze, helping him to swing the ball. Graham Gooch and Chris Broad initially looked comfortable, but the ball began to move more as it wore on. Alderman finally struck, rapping Broad on the pads directly in front to have him LBW for 18. Kim Barnett was on the receiving end of some intimidating bowling from Merv Hughes, and the tactic paid off when Boon caught him at bat pad trying to fend a short ball away. Mike Gatting made a disappointing golden duck, dismissed in exactly the same fashion.\nDavid Gower (57 off 62 balls), Graham Gooch (60 off 123 balls), Robin Smith (32 off 36 balls), and Jack Russell (64 not out off 115 balls) provided some middle-order resistance, but it was not enough, as the tail once again folded, leaving England all out for 286. Merv Hughes had claimed 4 for 71, and Terry Alderman took 3 for 60.\nAustralia had to face an awkward four overs before stumps, but openers Marsh and Taylor remained not out at the close, Australia 4 for no loss.\nDay Two\nThe Australians began day two looking to go past England's total, and build a big lead, and that is exactly what they did. Geoff Marsh fell off just 14 balls for a disappointing 3, but Mark Taylor and David Boon added 145 for the second wicket, although it was hard work and slow-going. Taylor was caught LBW for 62 in a rare lapse of concentration in an otherwise well made innings, and Boon was dismissed 42 runs later, out for 94. Australia batted on throughout the second day but their progress was slow but steady.\nAllan Border added 35, and Dean Jones made 27, but the highlight of the second day came in the form of Steve Waugh who continued his imperious form from the first test, driving square of the wicket masterfully. Although he was not as quick scoring in the first test, he moved onto 35 not out by the close, with Merv Hughes once again by his side not out on 2. Australia had ground out runs throughout a slow second day to end on 276 for 6, still ten runs behind England's first innings score.\nDay Three\nWhen day three began, England may have harboured hopes of picking up the last four Australian wickets quickly, and setting about building a solid lead, however Steve Waugh wanted to press on. He was seeing the ball well, and moving into some of the best form of his career so far, and made the most of it. Well supported by Hughes, who made a solid 30, Waugh began to free his arms, and lifted the Australian's run-rate.\nHughes dismissal in the morning session left Australia 331 for 7, and England should have knocked over the last few wickets, but their inability to clean up the Australian tail cost them dearly. First Trevor Hohns with 21 off 38 balls, and then fast bowler Geoff Lawson with a career best of 74 off 94 balls provided the lower tail support Steve Waugh needed to go on with his innings. As the impetus of Waugh's innings grew, Lawson contented himself with spectating from the bowler's end, and playing defensively when he had to, although the 11 fours he struck during his innings testified to his ability to pick off the bad balls that were bowled to him. Lawson eventually fell to Emburey's off-spin for 74, but the damage had been done as he had supported Waugh to guide the Australian's past 500. With the fall of Terry Alderman's wicket, Australia ware all out for 528, a first innings lead of 242, with Steve Waugh once again not out on 152.\nNot content with creating a large first innings lead, the Australian's were determined to make the most of the remaining overs of the day, and set about the English top order. Two minutes into the English innings, Terry Alderman again bamboozled Graham Gooch with the inswinging yorker, trapping him LBW for a third ball duck. Kim Barnett followed a few overs later for 3, caught off the bowling of Alderman, and Chris Broad was clean bowled by Geoff Lawson for 20. At stumps on day 3, England were in trouble at 58 for 3, Gower and Gatting the not out batsmen.\nDay Four\nEngland emerged on the morning of the fourth day determined to fight back, and were led from the front by captain Gower. Gatting went during the morning session for 22, but then Gower and new partner Robin Smith put on 139 for the fifth wicket to rescue England's innings. Gower was out for 106 shortly after bringing up his ton, caught by Border off Hughes.\nJack Russell again provided stubborn resistance with 29, he and Smith guiding England into the lead, before Smith fell agonisingly close to his century on 96. John Emburey briefly led a wagging of the tail, and was not out on 21 with Graham Dilley on 4, with England 322 for 9 at the close of day 4.\nDay Five\nAustralia began the fifth day looking to knock over England's last wicket quickly, and set a modest chase, but Dilley and Emburey were determined to drag it out as long as possible. They remained for close to two hours, add 37 to England's overnight score, but finally succumbed when Hughes bowled a short pitched delivery to Dilley, who could only fend the ball into the waiting hands of David Boon. He was out for 24, and Emburey had made an excellent 36 not out, England finishing on 359 all out. Whilst it was England's best score of the series so far, it still only left Australia with a target of 117 to win.\nTerry Alderman was once again the pick of Australia's bowlers with 6 for 128, his career best innings figures and taking his tally for series so far to 19 in the first two tests, a remarkable 9 of which were LBW dismissals.\nAustralia were in no mood to mess around with their run chase and began aggressively, but it back-fired when Geoff Marsh was out clean bowled by Dilley for 1. Boon and Taylor then put on 42 for the second wicket, before Taylor was out for 27. Australia then wobbled, Allan Border out for 1, and Dean Jones out for a fourth ball duck, before ever reliable Steve Waugh joined David Boon, and the pair added the remaining 50 runs required for victory, the winning runs brought up by David Boon, who memorably swept Paul Jarvis to the square leg boundary for four to win. Boon ended on 58 not out, and Waugh, 21 not out, was yet to be dismissed in the series. Steve Waugh was named man of the match for his first innings 152*, which set up the victory when the game was evenly poised.\nAustralia had won the second test by 6 wickets, and led the 1989 Ashes series 2–0.\nThird Test.\nGloomy weather threatened the third test before it even began, and rain and bad light eventually cost over ten hours of lost play during the match. The return of Ian Botham lifted the hosts spirits who went into the match trailing 2–0 in the six test series, however in his first match back after over a year off following serious spinal surgery, the English champion was well below his best. A bigger surprise was the return of Chris Tavaré who had not appeared for England in over five years, and his selection appeared to some to be a sign of increasing desperation on the part of the English selectors.\nDean Jones inspired Australia to another big first innings score of 424 with a superb 157, and England only narrowly avoided the follow-on creeping to 242 with a rusty Ian Botham top scoring with 46. The highlight of the match for England was the first ever test wicket for debutant Angus Fraser who finally captured the wicket of Steve Waugh (undismissed in the first two tests) giving him a series average of 393.00. The rain ruined Australia's party and a dour Edgbaston test ended in an inevitable draw.\nDay One\nThe Australians won the toss and full of confidence from the 1400 plus runs already compiled in the first two tests, decided to bat again. The pitch was not ideal, and rain threatened throughout, but a solid start from Taylor and Marsh took the tourists to 88 for the first wicket and threatened more of the same. Marsh (42) and Taylor (43) both made solid starts and kept the score ticking over, but it was Allan Border's dismissal for 8 that actually changed Australia's innings for the better. Dean Jones came to the wicket with the Australians at 105 for 3, and looked determined for a well overdue big score. His last century had been a magnificent 216 against the West Indies the previous summer, and he had looked frustrated so far in the current series.\nJones set about his innings in a workman-like fashion and kept the scoreboard ticking over. He and Boon put on 96 for the fourth wicket, before the different pace at running between the wickets of the burly Tasmanian and greyhound-like Jones led to Boon's run out for 38. This brought Steve Waugh to the wicket for the Australians, who so far had not been dismissed all series. Jones had edged past fifty and was looking very confident as the day wore on. The pair added a further 31, and despite day one ending with an almost biblical-scale lightning storm and flash flood, Australia ended day one on 234 for 4, with Dean Jones 71 not out, and Steve Waugh 17 not out.\nDay Two\nIf rain had affected day one, it ruined day two with the ground virtually awash as play was due to begin. Although some overs were bowled the day was almost a total loss and complete wash-out. The players did emerge briefly, and in a rare glimmer of brightness for the England team, a young Angus Fraser on debut, had Steve Waugh finally dismissed for the first time in the series, bowled for 43. Ian Healy went the same way to the same bowler for a disappoint 2 a few overs later, and Dean Jones brought up his century.\nAfter a disappointing day's play, the Australians had added a mere 62 for the loss of two wickets, ending the day on 294 for 6, Dean Jones still not out on 101 and Merv Hughes not out on 1.\nDay Three\nThe third day was once again interrupted by rain, however Australia managed to continue pushing the game beyond England's reach, although the longer they batted the more likely a draw became. Dean Jones resumed not out on 101 and, although the Australians lost Merv Hughes cheaply, Jones and Trevor Hohns (40) put on 92 for the seventh wicket. Once again though the only winner on day three was the weather with much of the day lost to the rain.\nDay Four\nDean Jones resumed day for on 141 not out and took Australia past 400 with the help of Hohns, and then Geoff Lawson, however Jones himself was out for 157 soon after lawson's departure, and after an epic 4-day innings, Australia were finally all out for 424 with a match result looking very unlikely. Captain Allan Border may have fancied his chances of dismissing England cheaply twice, but the remaining time made the prospect seem unlikely. His hope would have been to bowl them out for a low total, enforce the follow-on and then either defeat them by the innings or set a low target score for victory.\nThe Australian pace trio of Alderman, Lawson and Hughes looked set for the task and got the early break-throughs they required, Gooch trapped LBW by Lawson for 8, Gower, LBW by Alderman for 8, and Tavaré caught at first slip by Mark Taylor off Alderman for 2 to leave England once again tittering at 47 for 3. Curtis who had reached 41 was next to go with the score on 75, and Barnett, out for 10, went soon after with the total unchanged. England were looking on the brink of an embarrassing first innings at 75 for 5 when veteran all-rounder Ian Botham, still not back to his best, came to the wicket. Although there was not much chance of him repeating his match-winning heroics of the 1981 Ashes series, Botham was determined to help England avoid defeat. He and wicket-keeper Jack Russell put on 96 for the sixth wicket to stabilise England's innings. Botham was finally bowled by Merv Hughes for 46, and Jack Russell went soon after for 42, leaving England at 171 for 7, but Australia's hopes of an unlikely victory were fading. At the end of day four England finished 185 for 7, with John Emburey (2) and Angus Fraser (12) at the crease.\nDay Five\nAllan Border would have still held out a faint hope of victory on the morning of day five, but it seemed unlikely. Fraser failed to add to his overnight score and was run out for 12 soon after the resumption. Emburey and Graham Dilley added 30 for the ninth wicket, much to the frustration of the Australians before Emburey fell for a well made 26 to a sharp chance taken by David Boon off Lawson. If the ninth wicket stand of 30 had frustrated the Australian bowlers the 10th wicket partnership of 27 between Dilley and Paul Jarvis was just annoying, and made an Australian victory all but impossible. Alderman finally trapped Jarivs LBW with what was fast becoming his trademark of the series, the inswinging yorker, but England had struggled to 242, which although a disappointing score, had dragged out their innings long enough to avoid the follow-on and not leave the Australians with enough time for victory.\nThe Australians began their second innings with the prospect of facing 65 overs, but without any real hope of victory, and seemed set to use the batting practice as part of the psychological battle. Marsh and Taylor began quite aggressively and quickly took the score past fifty, before Marsh was bowled by Jarvis for 42, the Australians on 81 for 1. Taylor and Boon went past the 100 mark, and Taylor brought up his fifty before, on 51, he mistimed and was caught by Botham off the part-time medium bowling off Graham Gooch. Wicket-Keeper Ian Healy was the surprise replacement, elevated up the order for batting practice, and he and Boon saw out the rest of the day, putting on 49 to leave Australia at 158 for 2 at stumps, and the match ending in a draw. Dean Jones' sparkling first innings 157 earned him the man-of-the-match award.\nAustralia retained their 2–0 lead in the 1989 Ashes series after the third test.\nFourth Test.\nEngland went into the fourth test still 2–0 down in the series, but knowing they had been reprieved by the weather in the third, and in desperate need of a win to get back into the series. Their only hopes of retaining the Ashes were by winning at least two of the remaining three tests, and at least leveling the series. An Australian win would mean their regaining the Ashes.\nOnce again, England opted to reshuffle their line-up, with batsmen Tavaré and Barnett both dropped for Robinson and the returning Robin Smith. The bowlers did not avoid the selectors' axe either, with Dilley and Jarvis replaced by Cook and Foster.\nEngland was disappointing in their first innings, all out early on the second day for a seemingly insufficient 260, undone by a rampant Lawson who claimed career best figures of 6/72. An impressive century to Robin Smith the only highlight in a lacklustre display.\nThe Australians replied with an impressive 447 driven by 4 half-centuries amongst their top six batsmen, and the fourth time in the series that they had done so. England's second innings was a mirror of the first, all out on the morning of the fifth day for 264, leaving the Australians with half a day to pick up the 78 runs required for victory, and the Ashes. A dogged not out century to wicket-keeper Jack Russell had delayed the inevitable, but when David Boon swept Nick Cook towards the square leg fence in the 32nd over of Australia's innings, the tourists passed the required mark and gained victory by 9 wickets, regaining the Ashes which England had held since 1985.\nDay One\nEngland won the toss and decided to bat first. Lawson gave the tourists an early breakthrough by clean-bowling Graham Gooch for 11. Tim Robinson, who had come into the side at number three, was out LBW bowled Lawson a few overs later, with England not having added to the score. Curtis again fell cheaply, clean bowled by Lawson for 22 and leaving England struggling at 57 for 3. Captain David Gower and the returning South African born Robin Smith worked to restore the innings with a diligent partnership of 75 for fourth wicket, but Gower was undone by the arm ball of off-spinner Trevor Hohns which struck him in front, and he was given out LBW for a well made 35. That bought champion batsman Ian Botham to the wicket, but he was out for a duck two overs later, bowled by Hohns. Jack Russell was trapped in front for 1 by Lawson a few overs later, and England's innings was disintegrating at 147 for 6. Emburey batted defensively to support Robin Smith, taking 34 balls to make his 5, but he too was eventually deceived by Hohns, out LBW. Some stubborn resistance by Neil Foster late in the day allowed Smith to bring up his century, and saw England finish the day on 224 for 7, Foster not out on 35 and Smith on 112.\nDay Two\nEngland began day two in the hope that Robin Smith could go on to a big score, and the tail would be there to provide support. Whilst Smith edged towards 150, the hoped for wagging of the tail did not emerge. Foster went early in the first session, and although the final two batsmen Angus Fraser and Nick Cook both absorbed a few overs each to help Smith move onto 143, neither really bothered the scorers, Fraser out for 2, and Cook was 0 not out when Smiths wicket finally fell, caught by Hohns off Merv Hughes. England all out for 260 early on day two.\nAustralia's unchanged opening pair Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh emerged looking typically aggressive and soon were also looking untroubled by England's blunt bowling attack. The opening pair Foster and Fraser were soon replaced by Emburey and Cook, but England's bowling looked out of depth, and struggled to work out where to bowl and Marsh and Taylor set about scoring freely. After an opening stand of 135, Marsh was caught behind tantalisingly close to his fifty, out for 47 off the bowling of a reinvigorated Botham. The loss of his partner seemed to unsettle Taylor, and he too soon fell, stumped for 85 trying to advance down the wicket to Emburey. David Boon was unusually disappointing, clean bowled by Angus Fraser for 12, and in a rare bright period for England they had taken 3 for 12 to leave Australia on 154 for 3.\nDean Jones and Allan Border soon resumed business as usual, batting comfortably throughout the afternoon to see Australia to 3 for 219 at stumps. Jones was not out on 49, and Border not out on 19.\nDay Three\nThe third day began with Australia trailing England by 41, with seven wickets in hand. Border and Jones continued where they had left off the previous evening, with the later posting his half-century soon after the resumption. The morning session was all Australia's, who soon went past England's total in a very one-sided session. A highlight of the destruction was Jones striking a clattering six into the stands off Emburey, before mis-timing to be clean bowled by Ian Botham for 69. This brought in-form Steve Waugh to the crease to join Border who was looking well set. Border soon brought up his fifty, the total passed 300, and then Waugh brought up his fifty. In a rare lapse during an otherwise perfect innings, Border snicked a thin edge to Russell off Foster, out for 80, with he and Waugh having added 88 for the fifth wicket. Foster trapped Australian wicket-keeper Ian Healy LBW for a golden duck the very next ball to be on a hat-trick, but his replacement Trevor Hohns easily blocked the hat-trick ball.\nHohns and Waugh took the Australian total past 400 for the fourth time in the series, with Waugh seemingly moving confidently towards another century. England fought back in the final session though, first removing Hohns, caught by Gower off Cook for a valiant 17 off 64 balls, and then Merv Hughes shortly after. Waugh, with only two bowlers remaining to bat with, seemed hurried to try to reach his century, and after having played masterfully throughout the day, began to rush things, which was to be his undoing. Without advancing the team total after Hughes' dismissal, Waugh fell for 92, caught by Curtis off the bowling of Angus Fraser. Numbers 10 and 11, Lawson and Alderman frustrated the England attack until stumps, not out on 13 and 5 respectively at stumps with Australia 441 for 9.\nDay three had begun with the game still fairly evenly poised, it ended with Australia once again in the ascendancy, and taking control of the match.\nDay Four\nEngland began day four determined to put a quick end to the wagging of Australia's tail and did so, promptly removing Lawson with the addition of just six runs, Australia all out for 447, a first innings lead of 187. England needed solid partnerships and a good second innings score to fight their way back into the match, but received neither. Graham Gooch and Tim Curtis again opened the batting, but Curtis was out for a second ball duck caught by Boon who took a sharp chance close in at Bat-pad off Terry Alderman. A succession of regular wickets then ensued, England unable to put a partnership together.\nRobinson was out LBW to Lawson for 12. Robin Smith caught behind by Healy off Alderman for 1. Gooch went next, caught Alderman bowled Lawson for 13, closely followed by Botham, LBW to Alderman for 4. Gower was caught cutting by Marsh at Gully for 15 off the bowling of Lawson, and England were reeling at 59 for 6. Australia smelt a route and were pressing the attack on all fronts with hostile bowling from an almost unplayable Alderman and an up-tempo Lawson. When either of them tired, England's 'relief' came in the form of pure intimidation from Merv Hughes, and Hohns, who was turning the ball well on a fairly even track.\nAll seemed lost for England until a defiant Jack Russell, ably supported by spinner John Emburey set about first blunting, and then when the opportunity arose, attacking the Australian bowlers. It was slow going, and often dourly defensive, but Russell and Emburey weathered the Australian attack, and set about adding to the total when they could. By stumps they had crawled along to 123 for 6, Russell not out on 47 and Emburey on 22. A vital partnership of 64 restoring some credibility to an England team threatening to collapse completely.\nDay Five\nEngland managed to push on with the job of restoring some pride to their innings on the morning of the fifth day, thanks largely to the heroics of Jack Russell. From his overnight 47 not out, Russell soon pushed past fifty, and his partner Emburey looked as though he wasn't going to surrender his wicket easily either. They batted throughout the morning adding to their overnight partnership of 64. Russell looked confident, and it seemed Australia's bowlers were lost for ideas on how to remove the pair. They looked as though they were willing to bat the day out and save the match. They soon took England past Australia's total, and set about building a lead, but with less than a days play remaining, an English victory looked out of the question. Emburey brought up his fifty, his first of the series. The pair looked to be quite comfortable, however soon after they had taken England past 200, Australia finally got the breakthrough they had sought. Alderman produced a brilliant outswinger which cut off the pitch, collecting the top of Emburey's off-stump, clean bowled for a well made 64.\nHis replacement Neil Foster batted for over half an hour in making 6, a clear sign England's hopes lay in batting out the day. However he too was eventually bowled by Alderman. Jack Russell brought up a deserved hundred, and whilst his heroics were in vain with no support around him, had the top order scored more the result may have been otherwise.\nFoster's replacement, Angus Fraser, likewise frustrated the Australian's who were going for the kill. He batted for 40 minutes in making 3 runs, and allowed Russell to continue pushing the score along. Fraser was out cutting off Trevor Hohns, caught by Geoff Marsh and England were left at 255 for 9. Nick Cook wasn't able to repeat the stalling of his two previous teammates and last only 10 minutes and 11 balls, although he did strike a clean boundary in his 5 runs. When he was caught behind off Merv Hughes, he left Russell stranded on 128 not out and England had been dismissed for 264 runs, leaving Australia a target of 78 with the best part of two sessions to get the runs.\nTaylor and Marsh went on the attack, sensing the possibility of a humiliating 10 wicket victory. However it was not to be. They made a solid opening stand of 62, but Marsh mistimed Emburey to be caught by Robinson for 31. That left Boon to come in, and he and Taylor mopped up the last few runs. Boon swept Nick Cook to the square leg boundary for four to bring up the winning runs, and Australia had regained the Ashes by taking an unassailable 3–0 lead with only two tests remaining to be played. Geoff Lawson's match figures of 9 for 153 earned him the man-of-the-match award.\nAustralia had won the fourth test by 9 wickets to lead the best of six match 1989 Ashes series 3–0.\nFifth Test.\nWith the Ashes loss in four tests to an Australian side touted as supposedly the worst to ever tour England prior to the start of the series, the England side entered the fifth test looking demoralised and dejected. The English selectors once again chopped and changed their line-up, including the addition of two debutants – Michael Atherton, and Devon Malcolm. Despite the series having already been decided, it was the fifth test at Trent Bridge which truly defined the 1989 Ashes series. Having won the toss and confidently decided to bat, Border's charges piled on the runs once again. The opening stand of 329 between Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh which lasted for nearly four sessions, the highest opening stand in an Ashes test, in any test in England, and the fifth highest partnership for the first wicket in all tests. Their stand allowed Australia to bat throughout day 2 and well into the third, reaching 600 for the second time in the series before declaring their innings closed with 6 wickets down.\nWith Terry Alderman again demolishing the demoralised England batting line-up, taking 5 for 69 to restrict them to 255, England were forced to follow on. They returned on the morning of day four with one first innings wicket in hand, and still 354 runs behind Australia. Their last wicket fell early on, and Border enforced the follow on. The second innings was much worse, lasting a disappointing 55 overs, all out for 167, the wickets being shared amongst the Australians.\nDay One\nThe Australians arrived in Nottingham for the Trent Bridge test giddy after regaining the Ashes, and being the first Australian side to win a series in England since the 1975 Ashes series. The weather and pitch looked suited to batting, and so on winning the toss, Allan Border had no hesitation in choosing to do so. What happened next went down as one of the most memorable moments in Ashes folklore.\nEngland opened the bowling with the relatively inexperienced pair of Devon Malcolm and Angus Fraser, and Australia's opening batsmen Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh tore them apart. The Nottingham crowd were treated to an exciting display of a mixture of stroke-play and powerful hitting. The pair batted throughout the morning and had soon passed 50. Botham and then Hemmings were brought in to bowl, but were equally ineffective. The Australians both looked set and determined, and rarely mis-timed or beaten.\nBy lunch the score had gone past 150, with both openers passing their half-centuries. After a well earned break, they resumed where they had left off, scoring freely throughout the afternoon. By tea they had gone past 200, Taylor the first to bring up his century, followed soon after by Marsh. The pair, as might be expected after such a long day, had slowed down in the final session, but by stumps Australia's score stood at 301 for 0. Taylor was not out on 141 and Marsh not out on 125. It was the first time ever in history that no wicket had fallen on the first day of a test match in England.\nDay Two\nThe Australian opening pair started day two where they had left off the day before. Free-flowing strokes around the wicket kept the scoreboard ticking over, and England's bowlers looked lost. They had tried six bowlers – Fraser, Malcolm, Botham, Hemmings, Cook, and batsman Atherton – before the breakthrough finally came mid-morning. Geoff Marsh was eventually caught by Botham off the bowling of Cook for 138. His innings had lasted over 7 hours, facing 382 balls and he struck 15 fours. The innings was to remain his all-time test best.\nThe England team had finally removed one of the openers, but his partner remained steadfast in his concentration, and was now joined by a determined looking David Boon. Boon, who for much of the dark days of mid-1980s Australian cricket had remained the rock in the top order, had yet to score a century so far in the series, and looked set to try to right that wrong. He and Taylor breezed the Australian total past 350, Taylor bringing up his 150 in the process.\nEngland had failed to capitalise on their breakthrough, and the Boon-Taylor partnership soon resumed the pace and tempo of the previous Taylor-Marsh one. They batted throughout the morning and Australia soon went past 400, with still only one wicket down. The England fielders looked tired and dejected. Mark Taylor soon brought up his personal 200, becoming the first Australian to score a double century in England since 1970. However, not long after, an exhausted looking Taylor tried to dance down the wicket once too often attempting to hit Cook down the ground, and was out excellently stumped by Russell for 219. His innings lasted just over 9 hours, during which he faced 461 balls and struck 23 fours. His dismissal saw Australia at 430 for 2, with the partnership of Boon and Taylor worth 101. It would remain Taylor's highest test score until he made an astonishing 334* during the 1998–99 Australia v Pakistan series.\nTaylor's dismissal did not end the misery for England's bowlers however. Captain Allan Border came to the wicket seemingly inspired by the efforts of his top three. He and Boon took the score past 500, before Boon was likewise stumped by Russell off Cook, out for 73, a century still eluding his despite his consistent batting throughout the series. Dean Jones added a rapid 22, but was out caught by Gower off Angus Fraser, and the one highlight of the Australian innings for England came next when the in-form Steve Waugh was out for a duck. Wicket-keeper Ian Healy joined his captain, and the pair saw Australia to 560 for 5 at stumps.\nDay Three\nDay three began with a dejected England looking as though they knew they had no hope of extracting a victory from the test, and also knowing they would have to bat out at least two days to salvage a draw. But that was yet to come, as Border and Healy resumed Australia's mammoth total. England got the early breakthrough though, dismissing Healy, clean bowled by Fraser, second ball of the day without adding to the overnight total. Off-spinner Trevor Hohns joined captain Border, and the pair batted through the morning taking Australia past 600. Border unselfishly stuck to his declaration target of 600, even though it left his 35 shy of a century on 65, and declared Australia's innings closed shortly before lunch on 602 for 6, the second time in the series Australia had passed 600.\nEngland were forced to face an awkward period before lunch, and duly obliged the tourists by succumbing to the pressure. Martyn Moxon fell to a third ball duck in the first over, caught by Waugh at point slashing at an out-swinger from Terry Alderman. Debutant Mike Atherton went two balls later, fooled by Alderman's now trademark in-swinging yorker which trapped him in front to be out LBW. England ended the first over 2 for 1. Tim Curtis fared little better, out a few overs later for 2, also out LBW to Alderman. Robin Smith and David Gower went someway to stabilising the England innings, but when captain Gower was tempted to play at an off-cutter outside the off stump by Geoff Lawson he got an outside edge and was caught behind for 11. Once again keeper Jack Russell was called upon to try to provide some lower order resistance for a failing England line-up. He did so, this time in the form of providing support for Smith, who started to look comfortable where the others had failed. Smith's stroke-play became audacious, even elegant at times. He soon moved past 50, but lost Russell soon after. The keeper-batsman caught behind by Healy off Lawson for 20. Hemmings likewise provided good support for Smith, chiming in with a useful 38, and helping Smith take the England total past 200 before he was spectacularly clean-bowled by Alderman. Smith soon crept over the line to make a well made century, but he was out 1 run later for 101, caught behind by Healy off Alderman, giving the West Australian yet another 5 wicket haul, his fifth of the series so far. Alderman finished the English first innings with 5 for 69.\nThe final session was one of minor frustrations for the Australia bowlers, who looked to knock over the England tail. First Fraser with 29, then an injured Ian Botham batting down the order with 11, and finally number 11 Devon Malcolm who along with fellow bowler Cook saw England survive to stumps, finishing the day on 246 for 9.\nDay Four\nThe last England pair continued to frustrate the Australian bowlers for the first few overs of day four, adding an extra 9 runs for the last wicket, but eventually Malcolm was out caught behind off Merv Hughes for 9, and England's first innings came to a close for 255 in 76.5 overs. Still 347 behind the Australian total, Border had no hesitation in making England follow on. Captain Gower decided that a captain's innings leading from the front was necessary, and promoted himself to number one in the order. Despite striking one glorious 4, it backfired spectacularly when he was out for 5 on the fifth ball of the innings, clean bowled by Geoff Lawson. Curtis added 6 and there was to be no heroics from Smith in the second innings, out for 26 to leave England at 67 for 3. Debutant Atherton looked to be finding his feet, despite being on the receiving end of some hostile bowling, and even more hostile sledging from Merv Hughes, and moved awkwardly on towards 50. He and demoted Moxon added a useful 49 for the fourth wicket, before Moxon succumbed to a peach of an in-swinging yorker by Alderman to have his off stump cart-wheeling backwards out of the ground.\nRussell could only add 1, clean bowled by Lawson, and when Atherton was caught and bowled by off-spinner Trevor Hohns for 47, a frustrating three shy of a debut half-century, England were again reeling on 120 for 6. Lunch brought little reprieve for England, who seemed consigned to their fate. Fraser could add only 1 before he was undone by the spin of Hohns and clean-bowled. Hemmings had kept the score creeping slowly along with a determined 35 was out LBW to Hughes and when Malcolm was clean bowled by Hughes for 5 a few overs later, leaving England 167 for 9, it was decided the match was lost, and England did not wish to risk injured Botham, who went 'absent hurt', England all out for 167. Mark Taylor's brilliant 219 earned him the man-of-the-match award.\nAustralia had won the fifth test of the 1989 Ashes series by an innings and 180 runs inside four days to lead the best of 6 test series 4–0.\nSixth Test.\nGoing into the sixth test at the Oval, all England could hope for was to salvage some pride in the form of at least a solitary test win. However the hosts had looked unlikely to challenge the tourists for all but a few sessions during the whole series. England made two more changes, the introduction of debutants Alan Igglesden and John Stephenson, but the picks seemed more likely to have come from the chance to expose them to the top level rather than hope that they might prove competitive against a clearly superior Australian side. Australia remained unchanged since the second test.\nAustralia won the toss, batted, and compiled over 400 runs for the sixth time in as many tests. Only rain interruptions denied Australia the chance of victory.\nEngland's bowlers again looked out of their depth against an in-form Australian top order led by centurion Dean Jones' sparkling 122 from 180 balls. In reply England were once again dismissed for under 300, despite excellent half-centuries to captain David Gower and bowler Gladstone Small.\nAustralia took their second innings to 219 for 4 declared, thanks to half-centuries from Allan Border and first innings centurion Jones, setting England an unlikely target of 403 in a day. Rain again intervened, but despite the interruptions the Australian bowlers made every effort to squeeze victory out of the shortened match, reducing England to 143 for 5, despite a well made 77 to Robin Smith, when play was eventually abandoned and the match ended in a draw.\nDay One\nAustralia won the toss again, and chose to bat. Openers Marsh and Taylor again got the tourists off to a solid start, but their heroics of the fifth test were not to be repeated, as Marsh was caught by debutant Igglesden off Galdstone Small for 17, the opening stand worth 48. David Boon came to the wicket and looked at ease, as he and Taylor set about building a solid second wicket partnership. The pair batted throughout the morning, and Taylor soon brought up his fifty. The young New South Welshman had been in majestic form throughout the series, and England had no answers for the well-timed left-hander. He pulled and drove with ease once again, to bring up his milestone. Boon likewise approached his half-century, but soon lost his partner Taylor, who rarely edged a ball outside off-stump of the bowling of Igglesden to be caught behind, and give the bowler his first ever test wicket. Taylor had gone for 71, and Australia were 130 for 2. Boon fell shortly after for 46, bringing Dean Jones to the wicket to partner his captain Allan Border. The pair seemed to enjoy each other's company, and once again built a solid 4th wicket partnership, batting throughout the remainder of the first day. Jones was in a hurry and scored freely, all around the wicket, working the field for quick singles and twos, and picking off the bad balls for four. Shortly before stumps he brought up his second century of the tour. At stumps on day one, Australia ended on 325 for 3, with Border not out on 66 and Jones on 114 not out.\nDay Two\nIt must have seemed like déjà vu for England as they started day two, with Australia again poised for a large total. Border and Jones resumed and added a further 20 before Border was caught behind of Capel for 76. Jones was finally removed for 122, and Steve Waugh, who seemed to have gone off the boil slightly following his blistering first three tests, went for a disappointing 14, clean bowled by Igglesden. Rain interrupted temporarily, but play soon resumed, and the South London crowd was then treated with a blistering display of low-order hitting from Queensland-born keeper Ian Healy, who battered 44 off 44 balls. His innings lasted less than an hour and contained six 4s, also taking the Australian total past 400 for the sixth time in as many tests. Eventually he fell, caught behind of the bowling of Derek Pringle, who then proceeded to tear into the tail, collecting the last four wickets. Although Trevor Hohns (30) and Merv Hughes (21) lasted long enough to take the Australian total to 468, the tourists were all out shortly before stumps. Enough play was left to force England to face an awkward few overs, and the Australians made the most of it, dislodging Graham Gooch LBW to Alderman for a third ball duck. England finished the day on 1 for 1, both not out batsmen yet to score.\nDay Three\nAlthough rain had threatened day two, it ruined day three. Enough play was had to get through 30-odd overs, but the interruptions were regular, and prevented both the Australian bowlers and the England batsmen from developing any sort of momentum. John Stephenson contributed 25 on debut, and captain David Gower ended the day on 43 not out, England yet again in diabolical trouble at 124 for 6.\nDay Four\nDay four began with more rain clouds looming, but holding off for the time being. Gower managed to push on from his overnight 43 to reach 76, and 27 from Derek Pringle, 31 to Nick Cook, and a well made 59 to number 9 Gladstone Small got England to 285, and avoid the follow-on. Terry Alderman had taken his sixth 5 wicket haul with figures of 5 for 66.\nAfter a short rain interruption Australia began their second innings, and in a rare failure for the series, Marsh was trapped LBW by Igglesden for 4. It was business as usual for Taylor and Boon though, who soon took the total past 50. By stumps the Australians were 87 for 1, with Taylor not out on 43, Boon not out on 29, and with a lead of 270.\nDay Five\nGoing into day five, the Australians sought to set a quick total, and try to give themselves enough time to bowl England out inside a day. They had accomplished the feat already during the series, but the weather continued to threaten over London. The tourists wanted quick runs, and Taylor attempted to attack from the outset, but was undone after adding just two runs caught behind off Small for 48. Boon was soon run out for 37, also trying to lift the run-rate, and then Border and Jones again combined to go on the attack. Border made 51 not out off 74 balls, and although Jones eventually fell, bowled by Capel for 50 off 69 balls, the pair had added a rapid partnership of 89. Steve Waugh joined his captain, but his stay was short lived, as they soon passed Border's desired target score of 400. The Australian second innings was declared closed on 219 for 4, leaving England an unlikely target of 403 of just over two sessions.\nThe weather continued to threaten Australia's chances of victory, but when Alderman cheaply removed first Stephenson (LBW for 11), then Gooch (caught and bowled for 10), and Lawson removed Atherton (bowled for 14), the Australians smelt victory. England were reduced further when Gower was caught at cover for 17 by Waugh off Lawson, and at 67 for 4, things seemed dire. Robin Smith came to the rescue, steadying the innings, and a very defensive 17 from Capel bought the hosts enough time to avoid defeat. Capel was eventually caught at slip by Taylor off Lawson, and Russell joined Smith who had brought up his half century. He finished not out on 77.\nThe pair eventually survived to the end of play, taking England to 5 for 143 and earning a draw. Rain had again seemingly denied Australia victory in a match they thoroughly dominated. Jones was named man-of-the-match for his first innings 122 and second innings 50.\nThe match ended in a draw with Australia winning the best of six 1989 Ashes series 4–0.\nPost-Series.\nAllan Border's tourists became the first Australian side to win an Ashes series in England since Ian Chappell's tourists won the 1975 Ashes series in England. In doing so they became the first Australian side to regain the Ashes in England since Bill Woodfull's side did so in the 1934 Ashes series.\nThe Australian series victory began a 14-year period of Australian dominance that would see the Australians win the next three Ashes series in England, and four Ashes series in Australia, until England eventually regained the Ashes in the 2005 Ashes series.\nIt also marked a turning point in the history of the Australian cricket team, which had struggled to come to terms with the impact of World Series Cricket throughout the 1980s, and was at an all-time low. The 1989 Ashes series sparked a rejuvenation of Australian cricket, which would see them rise to replace the West Indies as the world's predominant Test cricket team by the mid-1990s, and break the record for consecutive test match victories by the end of that decade.\nIn contrast, the one-sided nature of the series led to David Gower standing down as captain, and saw him replaced with Graham Gooch prior to the next series against the West Indies in the Caribbean. The England side went on a down turn, and despite featuring as losing finalists in the 1992 Cricket World Cup three years later, struggled for consistency for much of the next decade.\nExternal links.\nHighlights of all 6 Tests"

        "text": "Dwight Eugene Garner (October 25, 1964 – November 18, 2022) was an American professional football player who was a kick returner for the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football as a running back and returner for the California Golden Bears. Garner was involved in The Play for Cal, in which they scored a game-winning touchdown against Stanford after five laterals on a kickoff return. He played in the NFL for Washington in 1986.\nEarly life.\nGarner was born on October 25, 1964, in San Francisco. He attended Skyline High School in Oakland, California, and led the school to an Oakland Athletic League title. He had 400 yards of total offense and scored five touchdowns in the league championship game.\nFootball career.\nGarner went to college at the University of California, Berkeley, and played for the Golden Bears as an 18-year-old freshman in 1982. On November 20, Cal faced their Bay Area rival, Stanford, in their annual Big Game. The Bears trailed 20–19 after a field goal by the Cardinal with four seconds remaining. On the ensuing kickoff return, known as The Play, Garner made the third of five Cal laterals to score a touchdown for a 25–20 win. His lateral to Richard Rodgers, as well as the final lateral of The Play, have been heavily scrutinized over whether they were legal; Garner made his pass while being tackled by several Stanford players, who maintain that Garner's knee touched the ground before he passed the ball, thereby ending the play at that point. The official closest to Garner at that moment, head linesman Jack Langley, later ruled that Garner's forward progress had not been halted. After the game, Garner maintained, \"I was not down.\"\nGarner finished his four-year career at Berkeley with 1,048 yards rushing and 120 receptions for 1,027 yards. He also had 51 kickoff returns for 958 yards, and returned 35 punts for 274 yards and a touchdown. He scored 10 touchdowns overall.\nGarner joined the Washington Redskins in 1986 as a rookie free agent, and filled in as a kick returner during the season. In two regular season games, he returned seven kickoffs for 142 yards. He also played in three playoff games, returning five kicks for 98 yards. During the preseason in 1987, he was placed on injured reserve with a bruised foot.\nLater years.\nGarner became a risk manager for The Sports Authority in Coral Springs, Florida. He died in Florida from prostate cancer on November 18, 2022, two days before the 40th anniversary of The Play. He was 58."

        "title": "Anthony Hancock (American football)",
        "text": "Anthony Duane Hancock (born June 10, 1960) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). A first-round draft pick in the 1982 NFL draft, he played for five seasons with the Chiefs, retiring following the 1986 season. He played college football at the Tennessee Volunteers, leading the school in receiving in three consecutive seasons (1979–1981).\nNow a teacher at Bearden Middle School in Knoxville, Tennessee, Hancock is active with the Tennessee Education Association (TEA). In 2012, he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives, losing to the incumbent, Steve Hall.\nHigh school.\nHancock was born in Cleveland, Ohio. One of nine children, his father worked for Ford. He played running back at Cleveland's John Hay High School under Coach Sonny Harris, twice rushing for more than a thousand yards per season to win Cleveland's East League MVP honors. During his senior year, he accumulated 1,083 yards on 153 carries, and was named all-state. He also ran track, registering a personal best of 13.6 seconds in the high hurdles.\nCollege.\nHancock signed to play with the Tennessee Volunteers in 1978, part of a signing class that included future NFL players Mike Miller, Darryal Wilson, and Terry Daniels. Initially a running back, he switched to wide receiver a few games into the 1978 season. His best game as a freshman came in Tennessee's loss to rival Alabama, in which he caught three passes for 52 yards. He finished the season with seven receptions for 122 yards and a touchdown. He also returned five kickoffs for 77 yards, and two punts for 16 yards.\nHancock entered the 1979 season one of Tennessee's key receiving threats, having caught three passes for 109 yards in the Orange-and-White Game that spring. He finished the regular season with a team-leading 34 catches for 689 yards and four touchdowns, averaging just over 20 yards per catch. His 85-yard touchdown reception in Tennessee's win over Vanderbilt was, at the time, the longest in school history. He had a 41-yard touchdown reception earlier in the game that sparked a Tennessee rally, and finished the game with 163 receiving yards. He caught three passes for 116 yards in Tennessee's 27–22 loss to Purdue in the 1979 Bluebonnet Bowl. As a member of Tennessee's track team, he placed second in the high hurdles at the NCAA Indoor Championships.\nAlthough Tennessee's offense struggled during the 1980 season, Hancock nevertheless caught 33 passes for 580 yards and two touchdowns. He also rushed 17 times (mostly on reverses) for 131 yards and a touchdown. In the fourth quarter of Tennessee's 20–17 loss to Southern Cal, Hancock caught a short throw from Steve Alatorre and outran the Trojan secondary for a 56-yard, game-tying touchdown. He finished the game with 135 receiving yards. In Tennessee's win over Washington State, Hancock caught a 45-yard, third-down pass in the fourth quarter to set up a touchdown and thwart a late rally by the Cougars. In Tennessee's 23–10 win over Georgia Tech, Hancock caught 6 passes for 120 yards, including a 47-yard touchdown.\nGoing into the 1981 season, Tennessee coach Johnny Majors sought to get the ball to Hancock more often, stating, \"everytime he touches the ball, it seems like something good happens.\" In spite of missing the first three games of the season with a broken foot, Hancock registered 32 catches for 437 yards and 5 touchdowns, and rushed 16 times for 110 yards and a touchdown. In Tennessee's 10–7 win over Auburn, Hancock picked up 21 yards on a reverse to set up the Vols' only touchdown. Two weeks later against Georgia Tech, Hancock caught a 42-yard touchdown pass from Alatorre in the fourth quarter to lead the Vols to a 10–7 win. He caught six passes for 75 yards in Tennessee's loss to Alabama, and caught 9 passes for 60 yards in the Vols' win over Memphis State. In Tennessee's 28–21 win over Wisconsin in the 1981 Garden State Bowl, Hancock registered one of the best-ever postseason performances by a Vol receiver, catching 11 passes for 196 yards and a touchdown. His 11 receptions remains the most ever by a Vol receiver in a bowl game, and his 196 receiving yards is second only to Peerless Price's 199-yard outing in the 1999 BCS National Championship Game.\nDuring his four years at Tennessee, Hancock caught 106 passes for 1,826 yards 12 touchdowns, and rushed 38 times for 262 yards and two touchdowns. As of the 2012 season, his total career receiving yardage was the 10th-highest in school history. Along with teammates Willie Gault, Clyde Duncan and Lenny Taylor, he helped establish Tennessee's reputation as \"Wide Receiver U\" in the early 1980s. Hancock also helped recruit fellow John Hay alumnus and future All-American receiver Tim McGee to Tennessee in 1982.\nNFL.\nHancock was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the first round (11th overall) of the 1982 NFL draft. During his rookie year, he scored his first touchdown on a 41-yard reception in the Chiefs' 26–13 loss to San Francisco. His 609 kickoff return yards in 1982 included a long of 68 yards, and his 103 punt return yards included a long of 30 yards.\nHancock's best NFL season, statistically, was the 1983 season, when he caught 37 passes for 584 yards and a touchdown. He had seven catches for 87 yards in the Chiefs' 41–38 loss to San Diego, five catches for 94 yards in the Chiefs' 27–12 loss to Washington, and six catches for 73 yards, including a 45-yard touchdown, in the Chiefs' second loss of the season to the Chargers, 17–14.\nHancock had two strong games to open the 1984 season, catching three passes for 34 yards in the Chiefs' 37–27 win over Pittsburgh, and catching three passes for 109 yards, including a 46-yard touchdown, in the Chiefs' 27–22 win over Cincinnati. His production declined after the third game, however. He finished the season with 217 yards and a touchdown on 10 catches.\nDuring the 1985 season, Hancock caught 15 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns. He had a 41-yard touchdown reception in the Chiefs' loss to the Raiders, caught three passes for 62 yards in a loss to Houston, had four catches for 55 yards and a touchdown against Pittsburgh, and caught three passes for 79 yards in the Chiefs' win over Indianapolis. He was released after the 1986 season.\nPost-playing career.\nHancock returned to Knoxville in 1986, and was hired by the Boy Scouts of America to run its inner city scouting program. During his tenure, he recruited over 500 new scouts, 12 of whom became Eagle Scouts. He also worked with UT's Institute of Public Service, a role in which he advised TDOT-certified small businesses on financial planning and bidding. In the early 2000s, he began working for Knox County Schools, initially as a substitute teacher, before obtaining his special education certificate from UT. He currently works as a special education teacher at Bearden Middle School. He has been active with the state's teachers' union, the Tennessee Education Association, serving on the TEA's board of directors, as well as chair of the group's resolution committee.\nIn 2012, Hancock, a Democrat, ran against the Republican incumbent Steve Hall for the 18th District's seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. He campaigned on a platform of fostering an environment for small business innovation and expanding technology in schools, and pledged to keep taxes low. In October 2012, he appeared at a campaign stop with his former coach, Johnny Majors. On election day, he captured just 37.5% of the vote in the heavily Republican district."

        "title": "1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 68th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 8, 1997, at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, the home of the Cleveland Indians of the American League. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 3-1. The game marked the fifth time the All-Star Game was held in Cleveland and first since 1981. It was also the first All-Star game held at Jacobs Field, which opened three years earlier.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nGame summary.\nThe American League jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the 2nd inning led by a home run by Edgar Martínez of the Seattle Mariners. No one would score after that until the 7th inning when Javy López of the Atlanta Braves would tie the game with a home run of his own. However, in the bottom of the 7th, Bernie Williams of the New York Yankees walked and then Sandy Alomar Jr. of the Cleveland Indians hit a home run to give the American League the lead and the win, as they held on to defeat the National League 3-1. All the runs were driven in and scored by players either born (Alomar, López &amp; Williams) or raised (Martinez) in Puerto Rico. Winning pitcher José Rosado's family roots are also from that island.\nThe loudest ovation of the All-Star Game, which came early in the player introductions, was reserved for Kenny Lofton, whom the Indians had traded to the Atlanta Braves prior to the start of the 1997 season. Lofton was on the National League roster, but was injured and did not play. Also in the pregame ceremonies, Albert Belle, who was representing the Chicago White Sox, was booed for leaving the Indians as a free agent the previous winter.\nUnlike past years, the performance of \"O Canada\", this year by the McAuley Boys, was not televised. Instead, the Fox network, airing its first All-Star Game, went into a commercial break, resulting in angry phone calls from Canadian television viewers. The Canadian National Anthem was later shown on tape delay after the game in the Cleveland area. Country star LeAnn Rimes sang the National Anthem following the commercial break. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of baseball's breaking of the color barrier, the ceremonial first pitch featured former Indian Larry Doby, the first African-American player to play in the American League.\nOne of the more colorful moments in All-Star Game history occurred during an at bat with Randy Johnson of the Seattle Mariners pitching and Larry Walker of the Colorado Rockies at the plate. The teams of the two former Montreal Expos teammates had faced each other about one month prior. However, when Johnson started on June 12, Walker chose not to play, explaining that, \"I faced Randy one time in spring training and he almost killed me.\" In this All-Star Game, Walker batted against Johnson, who theatrically threw over his head. Ever adaptable, Walker placed his batting helmet backwards and switched sides in the batters' box to stand \"right-handed\" for one pitch. He ended the at bat by drawing a walk. The incident momentarily drew mirth and laughter from players in both dugouts, fans and announcers, and comparisons to Johnson pitching against John Kruk in the 1993 All-Star Game, in which he also threw over his head. In spite of garnering a reputation of avoiding Johnson, Walker batted .393 (11 hits in 28 at bats) against him in his career, nearly double the rate of all left-handed batters at .199.\nAlomar was named MVP of the game, becoming the first player to win the All Star Game MVP award as a member of the host team (Pedro Martínez in 1999 and Shane Bieber in 2019 would later win MVP awards in their home ballparks). After the game, Major League Baseball CEO Paul Beeston presented Alomar with the MVP Award in lieu of the Commissioner of Baseball, who would not be named until after the next All-Star Game, when then-Chairman of the Executive Committee Bud Selig was officially named Commissioner.\nThis was the last All-Star Game in which the Milwaukee Brewers were a member of the American League. The Brewers moved to the National League for the 1998 season."

The RMTC is the second oldest in Australia and the largest. It is one of only five clubs in the world with more than one court (along with Queens Club in London, Prested Hall, Cambridge University Real Tennis Club and the Racquet and Tennis Club).\nThe RMTC is the home of the Australian Open, as well as the largest (in terms of player involvement) Real Tennis tournament in the world, the Boomerang Cup. Robert Fahey, who holds the record for most World Championship wins, was a professional at RMTC prior to his move to the UK.\nHistory.\nIn 1882 Lord Normanby, the Governor of Victoria, opened the court of the Royal Melbourne Tennis Club at 343 Exhibition Street, Melbourne, just north of La Trobe St. This building originally consisted of a real tennis court and club rooms, but later included squash courts (said to have been Australia's first) and an indoor swimming pool.\nThe club's status was enhanced in 1897, when Queen Victoria granted a Royal Charter to the club enabling it to be known by its present title, The Royal Melbourne Tennis Club. Thomas Stone was appointed the first Professional and manager of the club and was in time succeeded by his son Woolner Stone. Thomas and then Woolner each made an immense contribution to the club over a period of many years.\nAs the City of Melbourne expanded, the costs of owning and maintaining the Exhibition Street building - prime city real estate - increased beyond the finanical means of the club. In 1974, the club committee sold the site and established the present club premises in Sherwood Street, Richmond. Today, the former Exhibition Street site houses the Mantra Hotel.\nThe new courts and clubhouse were officially opened in 1975 by Lord Aberdare, President of the Tennis and Rackets Association, and the facilities now include two tennis courts, a squash court, a bar, a swimming pool, a gymnasium, a library/meeting room and dining room."

        "text": "The Peru national cricket team is the team that represents Peru in international cricket. The team, which is organised by the Peru Cricket Association, became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2007 and has been an associate member since 2017. The Peruvian national side made its international debut in 1927, represented by the Lima Cricket and Football Club, playing against a touring MCC team. Regular competition against other South American teams began in the 1960s, and has since continued.\nHistory.\nPeru has participated in all but one edition of the South American Championship since the first tournament in 1995, and has more recently played in ICC Americas tournaments, generally in the lower divisions.\nPeru gained affiliate membership of the International Cricket Council on 29 June 2007. They have played in all but one edition of the South American Championship from 1995 onwards, hosting in 1999, 2007 and 2014, 2019.\nThey competed in the ICC Americas Championship from 2008 to 2011, with their best finish being 2nd in 2011.\nThey have also competed in the Central American Championship, in Panama City, in 2015.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Peru and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.\nPeru played their first T20I match against Brazil on 3 October 2019 during the 2019 South American Cricket Championship\nICC Americas Championship.\nCricket Peru men's team - the 'Llamas' - competed three times in the ICC Americas Division III, an officially sanctioned ranking tournament, overseen by the International Cricket Council that offered a pathway to World League Cricket and potentially to playing in the World Cup.\n1. Buenos Aires, Argentina: 12 – 16 Feb, 2008\nThis was a 50-over tournament, played at different venues in Buenos Aires, featuring 5 teams - Belize, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Turks &amp; Caicos Islands - that had a stunning climax with three teams in a position to win the tournament before the final ball of the tournament. The eventual winners were the Turks and Caicos Islands, who were promoted to Division II.\nSecond place went to Chile on account of their lower net run rate. Belize finished third.\nPeru, captained by Chris Abbott for the first match and Harry Hildebrand for the second and third matches, lost their first three games, but on the last day of the tournament, pulled off an upset by defeating Brazil, thereby securing fourth place, with Brazil in 5th.\n2. Santiago, Chile: 9 - 12 Oct, 2009\nAgain this was a 50-over tournament, played at Craighouse in Santiago, Chile, with only 4 teams: Belize, Brazil, Chile &amp; Peru. The Llamas, under the captaincy of Miles Buesst, lost all their games to finish fourth, but came close to defeating eventual champions, Brazil, in their final match, falling 17 short chasing 253.\n3. San Jose, Costa Rica: 14–18 March 2011\nThe format of this tournament was changed to T20, and featured 6 teams: Belize, Brazil, Chile, hosts Costa Rica, Falkland Islands and Peru, playing at Los Reyes Polo Club on the outskirts of San Jose. The shorter format suited the Llamas' style of play, and Peru, captained by Miles Buesst (and Mike Soulsby, for one match) enjoyed their most successful international tournament to date, with a record of four wins out of five, and a highly creditable 2nd-place finish. The only loss was to the eventual undefeated champions, Belize, on the first morning.\nSuccess was based on a disciplined bowling unit of Miles Buesst, Nadeem Ahmed, Javed Iqbal, Tony Sanford and Dinesh Ekanayake, taking advantage of the low bounce of the wickets, and a large, slow outfield, backed up by good fielding, to starve batsmen of runs and force them into errors. Runs were at a premium on the two pitches used, and so batsmen had to be patient and correct to weather the initial storm of the opposition’s top bowlers, before making hay against the lesser bowlers. This approach was typified by Mike Soulsby’s masterly half century, off 63 balls, against Chile, that won him the Man of the Match award.\nSeemingly low T20 scores of under a hundred against Chile and Costa Rica were easily defended, and even the free-scoring Belizean batsmen took 14 overs to score 65, losing 6 wickets along the way, and indicating that the ball would dominate the bat for most of the Championship.\nThis was certainly the case against Mexico, who batting first, were rolled over for 49; and then the Falkland Islands were dismissed for 22, the lowest score of the tournament, as some of Peru’s second-string bowlers came to the fore.\n2011 Squad:\nThe following list contains the 13 players in Peru's squad for the World Cricket League Americas Division Three 2011:\nAfter the tournament in 2011, ICC policy changed, with the focus shifting away from High Performance Cricket to increasing Participation Numbers. This decision was driven by an economic imperative. It was no longer part of Affiliate Membership Criteria to play in an international competition. As a result, Division Three of the ICC Americas Championship was scrapped, meaning that Peru – along with Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico and the Falkland Islands – was no longer included in any ICC-sponsored tournament.\nThere is no short to mid-term prospect of Peru being invited back to international ICC competitions.\nSouth American Championship.\nThe \"Llamas\" had been participating in the biennial South American Championships (SAC) since 1995. In the wake of the ICC decision to scrap the ICC Americas Div III tournament, it was decided to make the SAC an annual T20 Easter championship, with the hosting rotating between the four members of Cricket South America.\nSince 2013 the tournament has been played annually. In April 2014, it was the turn of Cricket Peru to host SAC XI. For the first time, Mexico were invited to join the tournament, which they did with great enthusiasm - so much so that they actually won the tournament, defeating Chile in the final, thereby taking the trophy out of South America for the first time!\nChile had won three games out of four leading up to the Final, but Brazil, Mexico and Peru had all won two games each; and so qualification to face Chile came down to wickets lost.\n2015's SAC XII, held in Santiago, Chile, saw a further expansion, with Colombia added to the line-up to make a 6-team competition. After the group stage, with all teams playing each other once, Argentina, Brazil and Chile all had four victories each; on account of their superior run rate, Argentina and Brazil advanced to the final, which was won comfortably by the youthful Argentinean side.\nMeanwhile, Peru had a disappointing tournament, playing good cricket in patches, and being generally competitive, without being able to string together a victory. A number of dropped catches in the deep proved costly over the course of the four days.\nThe SAC XIII in Rio de Janeiro, in October 2016, saw an upturn in the \"Llama\" fortunes, with Peru claiming the bronze medal by winning three out of five games, against hosts Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. Moreover, this was the first time that a Peruvian player had picked up an individual award at a S.A.C., as veteran all-rounder Miles Buesst, picked up the Bowling Award for his 11 wickets, and the overall Most Valuable Player award for his combined contribution with bat (181 runs) and ball.\nPeru's only losses were to the Championship finalists, Argentina and Chile. In a thrilling finale, underdogs Chile sprang a surprise on eight-time winners, Argentina, chasing down 164 with 2 wickets and 2 balls to spare.\nCentral American Championship.\nAfter the success of the expanded 2014 South American Championships in Lima, \"Cricket Panama\" were inspired to invite additional teams to their March 2015 Central American Championship (CAC) in Panama City. The invitees that accepted were Peru, Brazil and M.C.C, who took their place alongside regulars Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador and, of course, Panama.\nAnother of the CAC regulars, Belize, pulled out at the eleventh hour, and their place was taken by a Panama A side, to keep the number of teams at eight, divided into two groups of four, playing T20 games.\nThe Llamas first match, on March 17, was against the M.C.C, who had just been on the wrong end of a hard-fought series in Suriname, and were in no mood to be generous. Featuring a number of County players and ex-players, they racked up an imposing 200 for 8 off their 20 overs. Peru, batting second, were never in the hunt and faltered to 79, for a chastening loss.\nThe next game was against old sparring partners, Brazil, on March 18. Again Peru bowled first and did well to keep the Brazil score down to 141 for 8. The reply started well, with Hallett, Soulsby and Myers all making quick runs, but after a mid-innings stutter, the run rate started to climb alarmingly. Some good late innings clubbing, and hard running, from man-of-the-match Buesst (35*) and Chaplin (5*), saw Peru home with 3 balls to spare, for a famous 5-wicket victory.\nThe last group game was against Panama A on the morning of March 19. Batting first, Peru racked up 147 for 9 off their 20 overs, with Soulsby (39), Buesst (35) and Myers (29) the main contributors. In a mirror image of the game the day before, the Panama A reply got off to a fast start and then faltered in the middle overs, as they lost wickets and the run rate increased. However, they got over the line with 3 balls to spare, and 5 wickets in hand, thanks to some good death batting.\nThe upshot of these group games was that Peru came third in the group, thereby missing out on progressing to the semi-final stage. They were able to take solace in a victory, that afternoon, over Costa Rica, who had come also third in their group, to claim 5th place. Drained from the morning's narrow loss, Peru's batsman struggled to a total of 109 for 8 from their 20 overs, with Soulsby and Myers again in the runs. However, the bowlers, led by Spry (3 for 12) and Roughton (3 for 14) and backed up by some good fielding, did enough to keep the Costa Rica batting line-up down to a total of 91 all out.\nThis was a satisfying end to an excellent tournament, with two wins and two losses.\nAmistad Cup.\nThe development of cricket in Peru and Brazil has followed quite similar trajectories since their acceptance as Affiliate Members of the ICC in the early 2000s, with a small group of keen volunteers facing sizable geographical and cultural challenges. This has led to a close friendship off the pitch - with the sharing of ideas and resources - and a healthy rivalry on the pitch.\nTo encapsulate this relationship, in 2011 it was decided to inaugurate the Amistad Cup (actually a Thermos flask), which would be awarded to the winner of any men's cricket game between Peru and Brazil. The loser would be given the dubious prize of The Spork (half spoon, half fork), which was found as a hidden extra in the lid of the Thermos!\nPeru is the current holder of the Amistad Cup, having defeated Brazil by 8 wickets in the 2016 South American Championship.\nCoca Cup.\nOctober 2014 was the date of the inaugural Coca Cup, a tri-nation T20 series between Peru, Brazil and non-ICC affiliated Colombia. The venue was Bogota Sports Club, located just outside Colombia's capital city.\nThe tournament opened with Colombia v Peru on the morning of Sat, 4 October. Chasing 138 to win, Peru looked to be cruising to victory at 121 for 4 in the 17th over. However, a flurry of wickets, coupled with brainless batting, saw the Llamas fall 6 runs short, finishing on 131 for 9 after 20 overs.\nThe afternoon's game was Peru v Brazil. Peru batted first and had reached 117 for 6 off 17 overs, when rain halted play. When play resumed, it was decided that Brazil should start batting immediately. Brazil opener, Gregor Caisley, set about getting the runs in double-quick time, before bad light brought a premature end to proceedings, with Brazil in a strong position. The Brazil innings was finished the next day, Sunday. After a slight wobble, where Brazil lost 3 quick wickets, they overtook the Peru total with 5 balls to spare.\nSo two close losses meant that Peru missed out on the Final. This was played out between Brazil and Colombia, on the afternoon of Sunday, 5 October. Colombia had convincingly beaten Brazil that morning, in the group game; and having scored 157 for 7 in their 20 overs, were confident of taking the trophy. However, Caisley had other ideas, bludgeoning 69 in just 39 balls to take a large chunk out of the total. When he was out, Nick Jones, 24*, took up the mantle, and the Brazil batsmen passed the Colombia total for the loss of 4 wickets, with 10 balls to spare, to claim the first Coca Cup.\nRecords.\nInternational Match Summary — Peru\n\"Last updated 5 October 2019\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Peru\nMost T20I wickets for Peru\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #915.

        "title": "Eswatini national cricket team",
        "text": "The Eswatini national cricket team represents Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), a country in Southern Africa, in international cricket. The Eswatini national cricket team, which is administered by the Eswatini Cricket Association (ECA), became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2007. The ECA, along with the cricket associations of Cameroon, the Falkland Islands and Peru, was promoted to affiliate status in 2007 by the ICC. In 2017, they became associate members. Eswatini is also a member of the African Cricket Association. The Eswatini national cricket team would compete in the World Cricket League Africa Region and the ICC Africa Twenty20 Championship.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Eswatini and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 are eligible for T20I status.\nOrigins.\nCricket was first played in Swaziland in the 1970s by white expatriates who had come to the country to work. Swaziland has played international cricket since at least 1981, when Zambia toured for a two-match series. From 1992 the country played in the Zone Six African Cricket Confederation Championship which evolved into the Africa Cricket Association.\nSwaziland was accepted into the ICC in 2007 as an affiliate member alongside Cameroon, the Falkland Islands and Peru. Affiliate status was the lowest of the three grades of ICC membership until 2017, when affiliate membership was abolished. At that time all affiliate members of the ICC became associate members. Affiliate members cannot play Test matches.\n50 over cricket.\n2008.\nDivision Three.\nEswatini, as a member of the African Cricket Association, competes in the World Cricket League Africa Region which is a 50 over competition for African countries that are not full member of the ICC. For the 2008 edition, they would compete in division three. In the eight-team competition, Swaziland would compete alongside Gambia, Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Rwanda, Malawi, Ghana and a South African invitational team (South Africa's South Africa's national team are full member of the ICC). The Swazis were drawn in pool B with Gambia, Ghana and the South African invitational side. On 13 April 2008, the Swaziland national cricket team would play its first international match against Ghana at Willowmoore Park in South Africa. The Swazis would bat first and score 197 runs with captain Adrisbhai Patel the top scorer with 90 runs off 135 balls. The Ghanaians would chase the target inside 35 overs, having lost only three wickets. Therefore, Ghana won the match by seven wickets. The Swazis' second match was against the South African side. The South Africans won by 70 runs in a rain affected match. Swaziland's third pool match was their first ever win. They beat the Gambians by 91 runs after they bowled out the Gambians inside 44 overs for 135 runs after the Swazis' had set a target of 226 runs. These results would place Swaziland third in their pool. However, due to the South African side being ineligible to progress to the semi-finals, the Swazis made it to the semi-finals where they would play pool A topping Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leoneans would bat first and made 116 runs; Swaziland's Joseph Wright was the leading wicket taker with five. The Swazis would chase down the target in 30 overs to win by four wickets. Wright would top score for Swaziland with 48 runs. In the final the Swazis would play Ghana who had beaten Rwanda by eight wickets in their semi-final. In the final, held at Willowmoore Park, Swaziland would bat first and would score 195 runs. Abdul Patel would top score with 51 runs. In reply, the Ghanaians would chase down the total inside 42 overs, losing five wickets. Therefore, the Ghanaians won the match by five wickets.\nDivision Two.\nAfter their promotion from Division Three, the Swaziland national cricket team would compete in the 2008 ICC World Cricket League Africa Region Division Two. They would finish last in the competition, losing all their matches. Swaziland lost three matches by over 100 runs; to Nigeria, Mozambique and Zambia. They also lost to Ghana (by five wickets) and to Botswana (by ten wickets).\n2010.\nIn 2010 Swaziland would compete in Division Two of the ICC World Cricket League Africa Region Division. In the competition, they would be scheduled to play one game against Zambia, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Mozambique and Malawi. Both of Swaziland's first two games, against Ghana and Sierra Leone, would be abandoned due to rain. Swaziland then would play the Zambians, but lost by eight wickets. On 27 April 2010, the Swazis would play a game against Sierra Leone, which would be rescheduled due to the washout that had occurred earlier in the competition. Swaziland won by thirty runs in a rain-affected match. Swaziland then played Mozambique. Mozambique would score 127 runs and the Swazis would chase down the Mozambique total inside 43 overs to win by four wickets. Swaziland's final match of the competition was against Malawi. The Swazis won by nine wickets. The Swazis would finish third in the competition, behind Zambia and Ghana. They would not promote from Division Two.\nTwenty20 cricket.\n2011–2012.\nIn Twenty20 cricket (T20), Swaziland would compete in the ICC Africa Twenty20 Championship. They made their T20 debut in the 2011 Second Division. Swaziland would finish sixth out of nine teams in the competition. They won three matches with wins against Mozambique, Rwanda and Malawi. They beat Mozambique by eight wickets, Rwanda by six wickets and Malawi by five runs. Swaziland lost against Sierra Leone, Botswana, Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria. For the 2012 season, Swaziland again would compete in Division Two of the Africa Twenty20 Championship. The Swazis' only won one match; a six-wicket win over Seychelles. In the eight team competition, Swaziland would finish seventh; beating only Sierra Leone. Therefore, Swaziland, along with Sierra Leone, would be relegated to Division Three for the next season.\n2014.\nDivision Three.\nDue to their relegation in the previous year, Swaziland would compete in Division Three of the ICC Africa Twenty20 for 2014. The competition had four teams in it with Sierra Leone, Gambia and Rwanda competing alongside Swaziland. Each team would play twice against each other team. Swaziland's first game was a 63-run loss to Sierra Leone. The Swazis' then beat Gambia by 86 runs. Next they would play Rwanda and lost by six wickets. Swaziland then won three consecutive matches. They beat the Sierra Leoneans by 13 runs, the Gambians by 117 runs and the Rwandans by 34 runs. Overall, Swaziland won twelve points, the same as Sierra Leone. Rwanda won nine points and Gambia won two. Swaziland had a larger net run rate then Sierra Leone, and, therefore, Swaziland won the competition and promotion.\nDivision Two.\nDue to their promotion from Division Three, Swaziland would play in the 2014 ICC Africa Twenty20 Division Two. They won two matches; a 30-run win over Mozambique and an 8-run win over Seychelles. Overall they would finish fifth out of six teams and would not be promoted or relegated.\nSuspension.\nSwaziland originally was due to compete in the 2016 ICC Africa Twenty20 Division Two. However, in February 2016, the ICC would announce the disqualification of Swazis from the competition, as they had fielded ineligible players in the 2014 Division Three competition. At least five illegal Asian players would play for Swaziland in the competition, including two that had played for Mozambique in 2012. Sierra Leone would file a complaint to ICC, and the ICC would decide that Swaziland had breached the player eligibility regulations. This meant that Swaziland could not compete in the 2016 Division Two competition, and would instead be replaced by Sierra Leone and Rwanda.\nT20I status.\nEswatini returned to international cricket in the 2018–19 ICC T20 World Cup Africa Qualifier. They won only one match, against Mozambique, and finished last in the Southern Regional Qualifier.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Eswatini\n\"Last updated 31 March 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Eswatini\nMost T20I wickets for Eswatini\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2538.

        "text": "Bury Cricket Club is a cricket club in the Greater Manchester Cricket League (GMCL), which plays its home games at Bury Sports and Social Club on Radcliffe Road, Bury, Greater Manchester. the 1st XI captain is Dominic Morris.\nHistory of the Club.\nThe club was founded in 1845, initially playing its cricket in the Townside district of the town. However, the arrival of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway required the club to seek pastures new. They then located to Foundry Street in the town, but this land was also required for development, with the building of Barlow's Mill in 1852.\nOnce again the club had to move and found a site at Buckley Wells, currently Bury Grammar School's playing fields, where they stayed until 1922.\nIn 1919, Samuel Roberts provided land on Radcliffe Road to be used for sporting facilities for the people of Bury following the end of the Great War. It was here that Bury Cricket Club finally settled and this land is now Bury Sports &amp; Social Club where the grounds are used by both the cricket club and Bury Rugby Union Football Club. The club also has a Squash section and Bury Chess Club also use the facilities.\nHistorically, records of cricket matches at Radcliffe Road can be found right back to the late 1840s including a game in 1888 where Bury took on a side of touring Parsees. The ground has also hosted two Lancashire County Cricket Club 2nd XI matches, the first against Northumberland County Cricket Club in 1908 and the second against Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club 2nd XI in 1953.\nIn the 1930s the annual tour to North Wales was begun, which still continues to this day. More recently, in 1996, the club went professional, and in recent years has employed first class players from around the world.\nAs part of the NatWest Bank Cricket Force initiative, Bury CC were nominated for, and won, the Lancashire Cricket Board OSCA (Outstanding Service to Cricket Award) in 2013. This was due to all the work that was put in getting the ground ready for the 2013 season and particularly the finishing work that was done on the new pavilion.\nIn 2020, the club was due to celebrate its 175th anniversary, however celebrations were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2021, the club released a short feature film '175 Anniversary Story' celebrating the history of the club, and the individuals that had contributed so greatly.\nCricket History.\nBury were founder members of the Central Lancashire Cricket League (CLL) playing there in the 1892 season. They are the only club, with the exception of Todmorden Cricket Club, to have been members of both the CLL and the Lancashire League where they played in 1893 and 1894.\nDespite a long history in the Manchester and District Cricket Association (MDCA) the club had been limited to minor successes with the 2004 lifting of the JC Worthington Trophy by the 2nd XI being the highlight.\nHowever, in the 1990s the club began to develop its junior section which has become one of the largest and most successful in the region. The club's commitment to junior cricket was recognised by the award of the Sport England ClubMark and the Bury Metropolitan Borough Council Community Club of the Year in 2005.\nThis youth based approach led to more success on the field and, for the first time in their history, the 1st XI won the league in the 2012 season. This was to be Bury's final season in the MDCA as they had applied to, and been accepted as, members of the Bolton &amp; District Cricket Association (BDCA) for the 2013 season.\nIn 2013, the under 13s won the Cup, beating local rivals Walshaw to pick up the trophy in their debut BDCA season.\nIn the 2014 season, Bury's 1st XI won their first, and only, BDCA trophy, the knockout Cross Cup, beating Edgworth by 4 wickets.\nThe club's continued commitment to junior cricket was recognised by its re-accreditation of the Sport England ClubMark in August 2014.\nOn 25 May 2015 the club informed the BDCA of their intention to resign from the league. When the BDCA confirmed their receipt of the resignation, it was then announced that the club would be applying to join the new GMCL starting in season 2016.\nThe 3rd XI who had played their cricket in the North Manchester Cricket League (NMCL) also moved into the GMCL after the NMCL voted to join the new league en-bloc.\nIn 2017, the 1st XI reached the Derek Kay Cup final, losing out to Egerton Cricket Club, in a game played at Greenmount CC.\nIn 2019, the 3rd XI won the Sunday Premier Cup, defeating Roe Green in the final at Stretford CC. This was the club's first silverware in the GMCL.\nIn 2021, the 2nd XI were Division 4S&amp;W Champions and achieved promotion to Division 3 for 2022.\nClub President.\nThe following people have served as president of Bury Cricket Club :-\nClub Chairman.\nThe following people have served as chairman of Bury Cricket Club :-\nClub Captains.\nThe following players have captained Bury Cricket Club :-\nOverseas Players.\nThe following overseas players have represented Bury Cricket Club :-"

He never started a game for Alabama, but was drafted in the fifth round of the 1964 draft, by the Green Bay Packers along with the New York Jets in the eighth round; although New York offered a blank check, the prospect of playing for Green Bay proved to factor in his decision. Wright played in 101 games in nine seasons in the NFL, but never started.\nHe is the author of \"I'd Rather be Wright: Memoirs of an Itinerant Tackle\" (1974, with William Gildea and Kenneth Turan), a fly-on-the wall look at the pro football world of the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nIn 1969, Wright was the model for the NFL Man of the Year Award (which was changed to honor Walter Payton in 1999), which was sculpted by Daniel Bennett Schwartz; the award still bears Wright's likeness to this day. Wright worked as a salesman for veterinary pharmaceuticals and insurance before retiring, and he now lives in Augusta, Georgia."

In 1995 she won the title of European Champion after winning the final match against Croatia 3–0 in the Netherlands. She was a member of the Dutch women's team at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, United States. Her team took fifth place in the Olympic tournament. In 2007, Visser received the golden federation's pin because of her record status as an international and her merits for volleyball in the Netherlands. On 4 October 2009, the Netherlands, including Visser, won the silver medal of the 2009 European Championship in Poland. They lost the final match against Italy 3–0. In total she played five World Championships, nine European Championships and the Olympics.

Officially she ended her volleyball career on 4 February 2012.\nDeath.\nOn 13 May 2013, Visser and her boyfriend Lodewijk Severein disappeared shortly after checking into a hotel in the city of Murcia, Spain. They were supposed to meet a doctor the next day but failed to turn up, and the authorities were alerted. Their rental car was found on a city street more than a week later. Their bodies were found on 27 May 2013 in a shallow grave in a lemon grove, two weeks after they disappeared in the region. The pair had been abducted and killed. Spanish police arrested Juan Cuenca Lorente, ex-director of volleyball club CAV Murcia 2005, and Romanian nationals Valentin Ion and Constatin Stan. The police stated that there had been \"certain business disagreements\" between the murdered couple and the three men under arrest. Severein and Cuenca had planned to exploit a marble quarry, but these plans never materialized and Severein had requested several hundred thousand Euros of his investment to be returned. During the trial, Valentin Ion admitted to being present during the murder and that it took place on 14 May. After two years of investigation, the Spanish prosecution sought a 50-year prison sentence. \nIn November 2016 Valentin Ion and Juan Cuenca Lorente were sentenced to a 34-year prison term, but on appeal in March 2017 the prison terms were increased to 40 years."

        "text": ", known in the PAL region as Everybody's Golf: World Tour, and in North America as Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds, is the seventh game in the \"Everybody's Golf\" series and the first game released for the PlayStation 3. It was released in Japan on 26 July 2007 to make the 10th anniversary of the series debut on the PlayStation. Additionally, the game was sold in bundle deals with the PlayStation 3 in Japan.\nA demo was made available on the Japanese PlayStation Network in May 2007. The European localized demo was made available on the Australian PlayStation Network on 14 February 2008. The demo arrived in North America later on 26 June. The North American release has mild censorship, replacing the panties of the female players with biking shorts.\nGameplay.\n\"Everybody's Golf 5\" introduces a modified version of the \"3 click\" shot system. Instead of relying completely on the gauge at the bottom to estimate the strength and slice of the shot, the new system encourages you to use the actual character's golf swing to select the power. Once the strength of the shot is determined, the gauge disappears, and the accuracy of the shot relies on the player's timing when the club hits the ball.\nInitially, there are six courses in the game, five beginner characters, five intermediate characters, five advanced players, and seven caddies. Shigeki Maruyama will become the second real-life golfer to become a playable character and caddy.\nThere is a challenge mode where you compete in various tournaments and against other computer controlled players to increase your ranking and unlock various items.\nThe game has had a large graphical overhaul, with nearly every visual aspect becoming more detailed and realistic.\nPlayStation Move support was added to the Japanese version of the game in September 2011, and support for English language versions was added on 23 February 2012.\nDownloadable content.\nIn May 2008 two additional characters, Alex and Gloria, were made available for purchase from the PlayStation Store in Europe and North America. On 19 June an additional course, Oceania Resort Course, was made available for purchase from the PlayStation Store in Europe and North America. In 21 August, the character Kratos from the \"God of War\" series was made available as a playable character.\nIn March 2009 Sackboy from \"LittleBigPlanet\" was made available as a playable character.\nOther DLC for the game included Toro as a playable character and the Golfasaurus-Rex course as well.\nGame launching.\n\"Everybody's Golf 5\" is one of the few games that fully supported game launching in PlayStation Home, the PlayStation 3's online community-based service. With full support game launching, users were able to set up a multiplayer match in Home with advanced options. After they have set up their match, other users could join them or vice versa and then launch into the game directly from Home. The game launching feature had access in the dedicated game space for the \"Everybody's Golf\" series in Home.\nReception.\nThe game received \"favourable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\nChris Roper of \"IGN\" wrote: \"\"Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds\" is a tremendously fun golf game, one that should appease either casual or hardcore golf fans. It's an arcadey approach to the sport, for sure, but there's still a good deal of depth in the game that'll give veteran players plenty to work with. There could have been more courses, and the lack of voice support online is somewhat disappointing, but the overall package is a ton of fun and definitely worth picking up.\" Aaron Thomas of \"GameSpot\" wrote: \"The \"Hot Shots Golf\" series has changed very little during the past 10 years, but there's no question that while still good, this is a franchise in need of a shot in the arm -- or at the very least, more courses. But that said, the new swing and robust online play freshen things up just enough to make it worth getting a tee time with \"Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds\".\" Reviewing the Japanese version, Dave McCarthy of \"Eurogamer\" wrote: \"In spite of the fact that all you're doing is pressing a button three times, over and over again, it never gets boring. It would probably be too controversial to call it the best golf game, or the best PS3 game. But on both counts it's a remarkably close call.\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of all four nines for a total of 36 out of 40.\nMark Salmela of \"411Mania\" gave it a score of 8.8 out of 10, calling it \"a great addition to the franchise\" and \"a solid addition to the PS3 library.\" Gus Mastrapa of \"The A.V. Club\" gave it a B+, saying that the game \"appeals to the stat nerd without sucking every last bit of joy out of the affair.\" \"Maxim\" gave it a score of four stars out of five, saying, \"If you own a PS3 and haven't played a Hot Shots Golf game prior to this—it's the fifth game in the series—well, today's your lucky day, asshole. The notoriously lo-fi series gets a Blu-ray makeover, but still winds up somehow looking very much like its last-gen counterparts.\" Jason Hill of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave it four out of five, saying, \"The wonderfully accessible swing system, the delightful Japanese golfers, the ever-cheerful and encouraging caddies, the gorgeous courses and the chance to play at your own pace combine to ensure this is indeed a game everybody can enjoy.\"\nStuart Andrews of \"The Times\" gave it a favourable review, saying, \"The odd style of \"Everybody's Golf\" has been known to put off serious golfers, but beneath the cute-looking surface, this series has always played an excellent game.\" However, Earnest Cavalli of \"Wired\" gave it seven stars out of ten, saying that the game \"retains what fans love about the series and refuses to make any drastic changes. Long time fans will be absolutely ecstatic at this news, but for those of you who never got the appeal of \"Hot Shots\" in the first place, you certainly won't find it here.\""

        "text": "The Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association (VSDCA) is a turf cricket competition based in Melbourne, Australia. There are 32 clubs each fielding four teams (one per grade) plus an under 15 (formerly under 14) team in the annual J.G Craig (formerly R.M. Hatch) shield competition, which is regarded as the premier competition for the future of Victorian cricket. There are four divisions (North, South, East, West). In first and second grade these divisions rotate annually to ensure every club plays each other at least once every three years. In third and fourth division these do not change and the two 'leagues' are South-East and North-West.\nClubs.\nThese clubs also have other teams asides from the open age VSDCA and R. M. Hatch Shield (Under 15 Competition). All clubs run juniors programs. Many also have other open age teams in local competitions (some even play against each other in these competitions as well as the VSDCA), women's teams and children's programs such as the Milo \"Have a Go!\" program.\nAll clubs must provide two turf wickets with changing areas for players and umpires as well as areas for the players to park cars and shower. The club's home ground is usually of higher standard and is used for first and second grade with occasional fixture problems leading to third or fourth grade game. The second ground is usually of lower standard and will rarely have a bar or facilities near the 'home ground'.\nConnections to other associations.\nDue to its recognition as being Victoria's second highest form of club cricket (equal with Victorian Turf Cricket Association) and its control of the J.G. Craig Shield, which is seen as Victoria's premier under 15 tournament, the league is closely linked with other associations. Due to its high level of competitiveness it is the most common breeding ground for Premier players. Also to feed Hatch sides, clubs will often draw from their local associations (such as Broadmeadows, Coburg and Brunswick attracting players from the North West Cricket Association). Because it lacks any other form of junior competition its clubs are required to form alliances with other associations to ensure they are able to run a junior program.\nJ. G. Craig Shield (formerly R. M. Hatch Shield).\nFormerly an under-14 competition in the 2005/2006 season, it became an under-15s in a Cricket Victoria re-structure. For many aspiring young Victorian cricketers this is seen as an important milestone and often marks a player's first matches on professionally prepared turf wickets. Games are 45 overs a side one day matches.\nProfessionalism runs high in these teams as clubs aim to secure players for following seasons if they are not already playing seniors with that club. Many district clubs also watch these games with interest in their quest to secure young talent.\nThe matches are played in mid-January. This can lead to games being played in extreme temperatures which is dangerous to both players and spectators.\nIn the 2006/2007 Box Hill defeated Broadmeadows in the final. The 2019/2020 season was dominated by Bayswater who defeated Balwyn in the final having not lost a game all tournament. Former first class cricketer Peter Sacristani was present at the final to watch his grandson Max win the man of the match award having carried his bat for a classy 96 not out which broke the record for most runs in a final in the history of the competition. Max's Dad was also there but wasn't recognised.\nFixtures follow a similar format to that of the senior competition with the exception there are four individual divisions with the top team of each playing another team that finished top of its division in a semi final before the two winners of those games go on to play in the grand final."

        "title": "William Marshall (tennis)",
        "text": "William Cecil Marshall (29 April 1849 – 24 January 1921) was a British architect and amateur tennis player, known for finishing runner-up in the very first Wimbledon tournament to Spencer Gore in 1877. As an architect, he designed private houses and university buildings in Cambridge, a university building in Dublin, and tennis courts in Cambridge and London, and extended Down House for his friend Charles Darwin. He was an original member of the Art Workers' Guild.\nEarly life and education.\nWilliam Cecil Marshall was raised in the Lake District, where his father, Henry Cowper (or Cooper) Marshall, owned Derwent Island House on Derwent Water; he had previously served as Mayor of Leeds (1842–43). His paternal grandfather, John Marshall, was a wealthy Leeds industrialist who had moved to the Lake District on his retirement. His mother was Catherine \"née\" Spring Rice, the daughter of Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon. \nHe attended Rugby School and then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he played lawn tennis for the university against Oxford in 1870, 1871 and 1872.\nArchitectural career.\nMarshall first worked for the Cheltenham architect, John Middleton (1873), and subsequently for Basil Champneys and Thomas Graham Jackson. In 1876 he established his own architectural practice at Queen Square in London. An early commission was an extension of Charles Darwin's Down House, then in Kent (1876). \nMarshall's architectural designs include several university buildings in Cambridge on the New Museums and Downing science sites: the original Engineering Department (1894 and 1900) and the Old Examination Hall (1909) on the New Museums Site, and the neo-1680 Botany School (1904) and the Forestry (later Geography) building (1914) on the Downing Site. He also designed the Botany Building of Trinity College, Dublin. \nHis private houses in Cambridge include the Elizabethan-style Leckhampton House, off Grange Road, for the academic and spiritualist F. W. H. Myers (1881), the grade-II-listed Tudor Revival house Elterholm on Madingley Road for the historian, Thomas Thornley (1888), and possibly Wychfield on Huntingdon Road, now part of Trinity Hall. Elsewhere, commissions on private houses include a substantial extension to, and remodelling in Neo-Jacobean style of, a house called Borden Wood in the hamlet of Borden, in the West Sussex village of Milland; it is grade II listed. Marshall designed this in 1887, the same year in which he designed and built Tweenways in nearby Hindhead. This was a \"modest weekend house\" for himself, with a triple-gabled façade. It is now the Hindhead Music Centre.\nIn the Lake District, he worked on the church of St John the Evangelist in Keswick, which had been founded by his grandfather, extending the chancel in 1889. He was probably also responsible for alterations to St Peter's Church in Castle Carrock at around the same time, which \"Normanised\" the building. He may also be responsible for 1882 alterations to Monk Coniston Hall in Coniston, attributed to \"William Cecil Marshall of Leeds\". \nOne of his specialisms was tennis courts; these include a clubhouse and real tennis court for the Clare and Trinity Tennis Courts in Cambridge (1890), now part of a grade-II-listed building, as well as courts at the Queen's Club in London.\nHe was an original member of the Art Workers' Guild.\nTennis.\nMarshall was a defensive player who was no match for the aggressive Gore in the final, the Wimbledon local winning 6–1, 6–2, 6–4 in 48 minutes. There was a formally dressed crowd of about 200 who paid a shilling each to stand and watch; there were no stands. A field of 22 competitors assembled to play and had to finish by Thursday because an important cricket match was scheduled for Friday.\nHe also reached the third round in the 1879 tournament where he was defeated by eventual champion John Hartley.\nPersonal life.\nHe married Margaret Anna Lloyd, the daughter of the New Zealander J. F. Lloyd, an archdeacon; the couple had six children, three sons and three daughters. Margaret Marshall was noted as a suffragist. The family lived in Bedford Square in Bloomsbury, until his retirement in 1908, when they moved to Tweenways (now Leigh Heights), a house he had built near Hindhead in Surrey in the 1880s. \nOne of his daughters, Frances Partridge, was a diarist, known for her connections with the Bloomsbury Group. Another daughter, Rachel Alice \"Ray\" Garnett (1891–1940), was an illustrator and author of children's literature; she married the author David Garnett. One of his sons was the sociologist Thomas Humphrey Marshall.\nMarshall was an amateur artist and naturalist; in addition to tennis, he was a keen ice skater, and wrote a book on the topic. He was a friend and correspondent of Charles Darwin; his circle also included Leslie Stephen, John Ruskin and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Frances Partridge describes the family during her childhood as standing for \"love of Nature ... for Wordsworthian poetry and its pantheistic outlook; for eugenics, agnosticism, and the march of science; for class distinctions courteously observed.\" T. H. Marshall characterises the household as \"intellectually and artistically cultured and financially well-endowed.\"\nW. C. Marshall died at home in Hindhead on 24 January 1921.\nReferences.\nSources"

        "text": "Town Team Baseball is a variety of amateur baseball played in the United States. In Town Team baseball, sometimes also called townball, the teams represent either a given city or town, or a commercial enterprise which sponsors the team. Usually a statewide governing body sets uniform rules for two or more classes, including proximity (how close the player must live to the town for which he plays) and other eligibility rules, pay or stipends for players and coaches, boundaries, and rules to prevent players from switching teams without reason. Such governing bodies may also coordinate annual statewide playoffs, facilitate communication between teams and leagues, and help to arrange for training and placement of umpires.\nHistory.\nThe history of Town Team Baseball varies from state to state. In addition to the states included below, Townball is played in Iowa, Kansas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.\nMinnesota.\nTownball has been played in Minnesota since the 1920s. Townball enjoyed its peak of popularity in the 1940s and 1950s, with as many as 799 teams participating in the 1950 season. The first town baseball team in Minnesota is believed to have been Nininger's, in 1857. Although many towns in Minnesota have fielded baseball teams continuously since the 1880s, townball as we know it really came into existence in 1924 with the organization of the State Tournament, masterminded by the \"Saint Paul Pioneer Press\" and \"Saint Paul Dispatch\" writers Roy Dunlap and Lou McKenna. One year later, the AM-ABL was formed as a governing body for Townball in Minnesota. This organization still exists as the Minnesota Baseball Association.\nNumbers of teams and leagues operating in Minnesota peaked between the end of World War II (1945) and the arrival of Minnesota's new Major League Baseball team, the Minnesota Twins, in 1961. Since the minimum number of players required to field a team for a single game with no substitutions is nine, then at least 7191 (and in actuality a much larger number) individuals participated in Minnesota townball in the peak year, 1950.\nHistoric divisions.\nHistorically, Townball teams in Minnesota were divided into three classes: AA, A, and B. In Class AA leagues, teams were permitted three players from outside the local area, and salaries were unlimited; essentially, whatever the team's owners or shareholders could afford, they could pay. Because the unrestrained competition and unlimited budgets bankrupted many teams and forced others to move to a lower class, this form of Townball disappeared in Minnesota by 1960, its leagues all victims of their own excesses. Legendary football coach Bud Grant played Class AA townball in Minnesota and Wisconsin and remarked, \"I made more money playing [town team] baseball than I did playing for the Minneapolis Lakers...And we won an NBA title while I was playing for them.\" Another perspective came from a former official from Bird Island, Fabian Sheehan: \"We priced ourselves out of the business, but we sure had a good time doing it.\"\nNonetheless, some teams were able to turn a profit at this level. Former Fergus Falls pitcher Harley Oyloe said, \"As far as Fergus Falls, anyone who was around back then remembers those days and talks about them still. You tell the young kids that we used to have two or three thousand fans for a game and they think you're nuts.\"\nAt the Class A level, teams were permitted two players from outside the local area, and salaries were still unlimited. Class B teams were required to draw all their players from a 15-mile radius from city limits, and no salaries were permitted, although many players were enticed to relocate to towns with B-level teams by offers of employment in local schools or establishments. Because this was the most economical level of Townball, it was also the most prevalent. However, it was always the least prestigious level of amateur baseball in Minnesota. It was not unheard-of for a town to field a B-class team in addition to an A or AA level team. Some towns even fielded three teams, with lower-level teams developing talent and feeding it to higher-level teams.\nToday.\nIn some states, townball is all but extinct in its traditional form. In others, particularly in Minnesota and Wisconsin, it remains vibrant and popular.\nMinnesota.\nToday there are more than 300 active Townball teams in Minnesota, playing in over 30 leagues throughout Minnesota, with major concentrations in the southern and central areas of the state.\nModern divisions.\nThe classification system was revamped in 1986 to restore Minnesota amateur baseball to a 3-tiered format. Today the three classes are A, B, and C. Class A is reserved for teams from the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area and Class B teams are typically composed of larger outstate towns and teams that have won the Class C Championship. As of 2000, there were 48 teams in this class. All remaining teams are in Class C. There are 230 teams in this class as of 2012. This division is equivalent to class B under the old classification system. The 2019 champions in Minnesota were:\nThe Class B / Class C state tournament is awarded to different towns throughout the state each season. Typically, 2 towns in close proximity host the tournament. The tournaments for both classes are held in conjunction with each other at the same venues.\nNotable players.\nNotable players from Minnesota Town Team Baseball include Herb Brooks, Carmen Cozza, Bobby Dill, Paul Giel, Bud Grant, Sam \"Toothpick\" Jones, Dana Kiecker, Jerry Kindall, Corey Koskie, Dick Lanahan, Tom Mee, Eugene McCarthy, Gread McKinnis, Les Munns, Frank O'Rourke (the sports and western author, not the Major League infielder), Jim Pollard, Jim Rantz, Frank \"Pep\" Saul, Howie Schultz, Herb Score, Dick Siebert, Whitey Skoog, Moose Skowron, Hilton Smith, Terry Steinbach, Dick Stigman, Hy Vandenberg, Rudy York, and Bert Blyleven (for one game in the 2007 season), Jim Eisenreich, Eric Decker, Roy Larson\nNebraska.\nIn 2007 in Nebraska, under the auspices of the Nebraska Baseball Association, there were nine leagues fielding over 50 teams. By 2009, the organization has grown to 75 teams and reaches beyond the borders of Nebraska to accommodate out of state teams that have no other league in which to belong. Just three years old, the Nebraska Baseball Association has begun to pick up momentum and increased exposure. More towns are now assembling teams. The Nebraska Baseball Association structure was made possible with the research and assistance from the North Dakota Baseball Association, South Dakota Amateur Baseball Association, and the Minnesota Baseball Association. Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota are the only states in the country that have amateur state baseball organizations featuring legitimate qualifying district and state tournaments. Wyoming is seeking assistance from these states to establish another state baseball organization.\n2007 Class A\nState Champions: Lincoln Lawlor Polecats\nState Runner Up: Lincoln Reds\nState tournament site: Dunlap Field, Cairo, Ne.\nDistrict tournament sites: Hastings, Ne.; Crete, Ne.\n2007 Class B\nState Champions: Ogallala Moose Lodge #1624\nState Runner Up: Hartington Bankers\nState tournament site: Dunlap Field, Cairo, Ne.\nDistrict tournament sites: Schuyler, Ne.; Hartington, Ne.\n2008 Class A\nState Champions: Lincoln Dirtbags\nState Runner Up: Kearney Kernels\nTournament MVP: Jeremy Fries, Lincoln Dirtbags\nState tournament site: Kearney, Ne.\n2008 Class B\nState Champions: Wakefield Capitals\nState Runner Up: Yutan Pilots\nTournament MVP: Max Greve, Wakefield\nState tournament site: Wakefield, Ne.

The tournament is usually held on the last weekend in July. Teams competing in this division can have up to two players under 35 but neither of those players can pitch. Usually these under 35 players are catchers or middle infielders.\nClass A is reserved for development teams or teams that are new to amateur baseball. Many teams that field Class A are usually younger teams whom their main team usually play in the AA or AAA tournaments. Because of this, any player who plays in the A tournament that year cannot play in the AA or AAA tournaments as well. Also the winner of the Class A tournament automatically gets moved up to AA the next season.\nClass AA is the next highest up and is usually reserved for more established teams or teams that have players who have had college baseball experience. Class AA was added in 1965 and these teams are usually found in smaller towns or the talent level is not enough to play in AAA.\nClass AAA is the highest division of amateur baseball in North Dakota. Teams in this division are usually in bigger cities or college towns and have many of their players currently playing college baseball. The AAA division has been dominated by the Jamestown Elks and Jamestown Merchants since being added in 1991 as all but four times (1995, 2000, 2021 and 2022) that one of these two teams has won the AAA championship.\nFor 2023, the dates and number of teams for each tournament.

The WBA has 56 teams located throughout Central, Northern and Western Wisconsin along the St. Croix and Mississippi River valleys from Superior to La Crosse, and Hudson to Wausau.

In 2014, Mike \"Smitty\" Smith (then the manager of one of the teams) called for a split in that league and organized that league's New York teams into the Southwestern New York Men's Baseball League. The league's first title was decided in August 2014, when the Fillmore Town Team defeated the Little Valley Thunder. The league returned for its second season in 2015, expanding into Pennsylvania; that year, the team from Bradford, Pennsylvania defeated Fillmore for the championship. Bradford again defeated Fillmore for the 2016 title. The league was abandoned after the 2016 season after Smith opted to pursue a political campaign.\nThe five remaining Pennsylvania teams in Alle–Catt continue to play as their own league."

        "text": "Rugby Union South Australia (RUSA) is the governing body for the sport of rugby union in the state of South Australia. It is a member of Rugby Australia and runs an amateur club competition in Adelaide consisting of men's teams in Premier grade, Premier reserves, Division 2 and Division 2 reserves; and junior teams grouped by age from under 7 to under 18. As of 2013, a women's competition has been included. The RUSA also selects representative teams each year to compete against other Australian states and territories.\nHistory.\nThe SA Rugby Union was established in 1932 after journalist Ian Sabey, from The Advertiser, convened a public meeting. This meeting resulted in the formation of the Adelaide Rugby Club, with enough players to field two 7-a-side teams. Interest in the sport grew, and by the end of that year, the Royal Australian Navy, Adelaide University and the Waratahs were ready to field teams in a local competition.\nRugby in the Adelaide area grew quickly and within a year, South Australia had fielded a team against Victoria for its first interstate match.\nRugby League benefited in the 1940s, when the Port Adelaide Rugby Union team fractured and changed codes. Over the following two decades, rugby grew across the metropolitan region and by the 1950s, South Australia boasted eight clubs. In 1951, with the competition and therefore financial risks growing, it was decided that it was in the Union's best interest to become an incorporated body. In the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, the South Australian representative team competed in the Southern States Carnivals against Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The SARU financed its own tour of Queensland and ACT in 1971, playing in Canberra, Toowoomba, and Brisbane.\nBy 1971 clubs included: Army, Adelaide University, Glenelg, Burnside, Elizabeth, Flinders University, North Adelaide, Old Collegians, Onkaparinga, Port Adelaide, Roseworthy College Rams, Salisbury, Southern Suburbs, West Torrens and Woodville.\nClubs which have fielded rugby teams in the past are: Aquinas, Black Forest, Central Districts, Flinders University, Gawler, Murray Bridge, North-West Districts, Salisbury, Smithfield Plains, Edinburgh, Lincoln, Pulteney Grammar School, Salisbury High School, Salisbury Com. Schools, Salisbury Teachers College, S.C.A.E., South Australian Institute of Technology, St Peters College, St Marks College, Tea Tree Gully, Kingswood, Adelaide, Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Whyalla, Waratahs, North Adelaide Baptist, Prince Alfred Old Collegians, Army, East Torrens, RAAF, SA Railways Institute and RAN. In 1978 Glenelg was renamed Brighton, the club's second name change, having previously been known as Kingston. In 2006 the Roseworthy college Rams were renamed Barossa Rams. Burnside fielded no junior teams until they amalgamated with The Waratahs Junior Rugby Union Football Club in 1992. North Torrens was formed when West Torrens and North Adelaide merged. Western Districts Junior Rugby Union Football Club (the Vikings) is the junior team for the two senior clubs of Woodville and Port Adelaide.\nIn 1995, Adelaide University and Old Collegians RFC established women's teams. Initially playing infrequently while building player numbers. By 2013 sufficient clubs had established women's teams for the Union to establish a formal competition.\nIn 1999, SA Rugby again took on corporate change and release its Incorporated Association status and become a Company Limited by Guarantee, further underlining its commercial strength. In 2006, SA Rugby Union Ltd merged with the SA Junior Rugby Union.\nIn 2014 Old Collegians broke an 8-year drought to win the premier grade premiership\nCurrent clubs.\nAs of 2018, there are fourteen clubs which make up RUSA, eleven of these clubs field senior men's sides, eight field senior women's sides and 11 field junior sides. There is also a golden oldies club for players 35+, and a rugby sevens club for women and girls (12+).\nRepresentative teams.\nThe Black Falcons team is selected from senior players within South Australia each year, and competes against other amateur representative rugby teams from states including Victoria and Western Australia. Junior Falcons teams are also chosen to play in national age group competitions. The Southern Warriors is the women's seven-a-side team that competes in tournaments including the National Women's Sevens tournament.\nThe South Australian Under 20 team competes in the Southern States Championship and also plays occasional matches against other representative sides. Prior to 2008, state colts teams at under 21 and under 19 age levels were fielded in national competitions.\nFrom 2018 Black Falcons compete into Emerging States Championship and in 2019 also a second developing team, South Australia Under 23."

The CCC has toured the United Kingdom four times.\nThe night of the photo shoot for an ad campaign featuring the CCC modelling the new National English Football jersey in LA, one of the team members was an innocent bystander in a drive-by shooting in Compton and died. \nBackground and mission of the team.\nThe team was originally called the Los Angeles Krickets. In the early nineties the club toured England where they played at Hambledon. Upon their return the Los Angeles Krickets took a new direction when Disney signed up all members of the team for a film project. The publicity garnered by the tour was unprecedented in American cricket circles and included coverage by BBC Four, KTLA, ITV, Sky News, \"The Australian\", \"The Daily Telegraph\" and numerous local newspapers in England and Australia.\nCompton Cricket Club was started at the Dome Village Homeless Community in Downtown Los Angeles in 1995, by US homeless activist Ted Hayes and Hollywood movie producer Katy Haber, to combat the negative effects of poverty and homelessness. After a highly successful tour of Great Britain later that year, the LA Krickets expanded to include inner city Latino gang members from the City of Compton. The Compton Homies and the Popz (Compton Cricket Club) emerged in 1996 as the first All American Inner City Cricket Team. The club uses the ideals of sportsmanship, and the particular importance of etiquette and fair play in cricket, to help players develop respect for authority, a sense of self-esteem and self-discipline. The Compton Homies travelled to the UK in 1997, 1999, and 2001, joined LASCA (the Los Angeles Social Cricket Alliance) and won the British Cup twice.\nThe 'Homies' mission is to:\nThe team motto of 'Let the game begin again in America' harkens back to the former popularity of cricket in the United States during the 19th century.\nThe majority of the team is formed of the founding members and Hayes sees them as a \"cross-generational village-like team\".\nTour highlights.\nThe LA KRICKETS 1995 tour of the UK, laid the ground rules for future tours, sponsorship and partners and resulted in a movie deal with Disney. Since then, the Compton Homes and the Popz (CCC) 1997, 1999 and 2001 tours included games against the Windsor Castle Staff cricket team, \"Rap\" session rapping for HRH Prince Edward at Windsor Castle, a visit with His Royal Highness at Buckingham Palace, and with the Rt Hon Mo Mowlam at Stormont Castle, a cricket bat presentation to Gerry Adams at Stormont, Belfast and a Hurling Stick to David Pringle, to help broker the peace accord in Northern Ireland.\nA 2001 Game against the legendary Lashings team, with Brian Lara playing on the CCC cricket Club side.\nIn 2003, Warwickshire cricketer Paul Smith spent three weeks helping train the CCC. The trip was a part of Smith's work with 'Cricket Without Boundaries', a charity that seeks to empower communities through cricket.\nCurrent activities and plans.\nCCC vs the Afghan national cricket team.\nA match with the Afghanistan national cricket team is being planned. The original date for this groundbreaking cricket event had to be postponed due to lack of funding for the National Cricket team from Afghanistan to fly from their home camp to Los Angeles for the historical match.\nThis will be the first time that a cricket team from Afghanistan has toured America. The match will help raise money for an orphanage rebuilt by US marines in Afghanistan and continue the CCC's vital work around the world promoting greater peace through 'cricket diplomacy'.\nTour of Australia.\nThe clubs hopes that their recent historic Australian tour January 31 – February 12, 2011 will continue their development into a world class competitive and exhibition cricket team and sporting club, while the publicity generated by the tour will be used to highlight other Australian non-profit organizations that deal with similar issues in their own communities. Touring Australia also aims to raise awareness of the CCC with key stakeholders to improve cricket opportunities between the US and Australia.\nThe proposed tour and background to the Compton Cricket Club has recently (May 2007 – February 2010) received considerable attention in mainstream Australian and international media including CNN, Sky News, Channel 7, Sydney Morning Herald, ABC Radio National, Alpha magazine, Courier Mail, NT News, Ninemsn.com, ESPN.com, Dailynews.com, \"Dumbo Feather, pass it on\" magazine, Centralian advocate &amp; the Big Issue magazine.

        "text": "James Michael Gregory (November 4, 1935 – October 30, 2019) was a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and executive. Born in Port Colborne, Ontario and raised in Dunnville, Ontario, Gregory attended St. Michael's College School in Toronto where he became involved with the school's ice hockey teams, first as a trainer, eventually moving to management and coaching positions. He went on to coach and manage the Toronto Marlboros, winning two championships. He then moved to the National Hockey League's (NHL) Toronto Maple Leafs, serving as their general manager between 1969 and 1979. He led the team to eight playoff appearances during his ten-year tenure. He then moved to the NHL head offices, becoming the director of central scouting, and later took a directorship position in the hockey operations department, which he held until his death.\nEarly life.\nGregory was born in 1935 in Port Colborne, Ontario, and raised in the nearby town of Dunnville, Ontario. His father was born in England and was a Royal Canadian Air Force World War II veteran. Growing up in Dunnville, he developed a passion for hockey, in particular, the Toronto Maple Leafs, listening to Foster Hewitt's broadcasts on Hockey Night in Canada, and developing a relationship with his favourite player, Ted Kennedy. He learned the game from playing road hockey, and later on his local midget hockey team.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1952, he relocated to Toronto and attended St. Michael's College School, where he had intentions of playing ice hockey. After failing to place on the school's Junior B hockey team, he joined the Junior A team as a stats keeper and trainer at the insistence of teacher Father David Bauer. In 1961, he took a management position with the team, winning the Memorial Cup in that same year. The following hockey season however, the Majors hockey team withdrew from their league, and Gregory relocated to another high school team, the Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons, winning a championship. When the Maroons were merged into the Toronto Marlboros in 1964, the organization retained Gregory. He coached the club to a Memorial Cup victory that year. Later assuming the management duties as well, he guided the Marlies to another Memorial Cup in 1967. In 1959, while working for Colgate-Palmolive, he gained employment with the Toronto Maple Leafs after an interview with owner Stafford Smythe, which was set up with the assistance of his former school coach, teacher and mentor at St. Michael's, Father Bauer. His duties included maintaining his responsibilities with the Marlies, a Maple Leafs-sponsored team, along with scouting, and working at Smythe's summertime aggregate business.\nGregory was hired in 1967 by the Vancouver Canucks (an affiliate of the Maple Leafs) of the Western Hockey League as head coach. He remained there for one season, compiling a 26–41–5 record, for 5th place in the league. The following year, he became a scout for the Maple Leafs. In spring of 1969, when Punch Imlach was fired as general manager, Gregory was named as his replacement.\nExecutive career.\nIn Gregory's 10 years as general manager, the Maple Leafs made eight playoff appearances. They also introduced many future stars including Darryl Sittler, Lanny McDonald, Tiger Williams, Ian Turnbull, and Mike Palmateer, during a time which many players defected to the rival league, World Hockey Association. He was one of the first managers to turn to Europe as a source of NHL talent, recruiting defenseman Borje Salming and winger Inge Hammarstrom, in 1973, to play for the Leafs. Gregory was also responsible for introducing a scouting system within the organization, hiring five full-time scouts. However, after the Maple Leafs suffered an elimination in the quarterfinal round of the 1979 Stanley Cup playoffs, Gregory was fired by owner Harold Ballard, and replaced with his predecessor, Punch Imlach. Gregory learned of the news when he received a call from an NHL executive offering him the directorship of the NHL Central Scouting Bureau, unaware that Ballard had fired him.\nRecognized for his knowledge of potential European talent for the NHL, Gregory was offered and accepted the position of Director of the NHL Central Scouting Service in 1979, replacing Jack Button. Gregory remained until 1986, when he was named Executive Director of Hockey Operations for the NHL. In 1998, he was named chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame selection committee and Senior Vice President of Hockey Operations of the NHL. Considered to be a vital part of the NHL's Hockey Operations and Officiating Department, he was known for introducing goal reviews.\nPersonal life.\nGregory was married to Rosalie and they had four children: Andrea, Valerie, Maureen and David. Father Bauer performed the wedding ceremony for the couple.\nIn 2007, Gregory was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder, while he was on a hiatus from the selection committee due to ill health. He was awarded the Order of St. Michael from his alma mater, St. Michael's College School, in 2012. In that same year, the annual Player of the Game awards in the Canadian Hockey League's top prospects games were named after him in recognition for his support of the league.\nOn February 27, 2009, Gregory was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack, from which he later recovered. In 2011, he was treated for amyloidosis, a blood disorder. He died at his Toronto home on October 30, 2019, five days before his 84th birthday."

        "text": "Volleyball in Canada dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. Today, the sport is played at various levels of competition throughout the country.\nHistory.\nVolleyball was invented in the United States in 1895 and made its first appearance in Canada in 1900 when an Ottawa branch of the YMCA included it in its schedule. The sport caught on and soon spread to YMCAs in Toronto and Montreal. These centers conducted various tournaments, which were, for a long time, the only organized manifestations of the sport in Canada. While the sport spread throughout the United States, Russia and Asia before the First World War, it lay relatively dormant in Canada. With the creation of the Federation Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) shortly after the Second World War, the sport gained international recognition.\nCanada joined the FIVB in 1953, the same year the Canadian Volleyball Association was founded. Gordon Odell\nserved as interim president before Wes McVicar took over as the association's first president. The current president, Dave Carey, oversees an organization of over 80,000 members. Renamed Volleyball Canada (VC), the association has its headquarters in Ottawa. When founded, VC was divided into three regions: Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal. Today, the regions are drawn along provincial/territorial lines and take in the whole of Canada.\nCanada's first international experience in the sport took place in 1959 at the Pan-American Games in Chicago. Today, the Canadian teams strive to qualify for all of the international tournaments for which they are eligible. Since 1976, both the Men's and Women's indoor National Teams have participated in the Olympic Games and the World Championships on several occasions. The best result for both the Men's and Women's teams was achieved at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles where they finished 4th and 8th respectively. In 1998, Volleyball Canada became the umbrella organization for the national disabled volleyball program, a program that has had continued success since this partnership. The National Men's Standing Disabled Volleyball Team brought home Volleyball Canada's first gold medal at the 2002 World Championships in Poland, and went on to defend its title in 2004."

The Australians were the holders, having reclaimed the Ashes in England during the 1989 Ashes series, however the 1986-87 Ashes series, which was the previous series in Australia had been won by England. The English tourists were confident their home series loss in 1989 had been a blemish and that they were more than capable of reclaiming the Ashes 'down under'. The tourists were seemingly well prepared. During their home summer they had 1-0 victories in 3-test series against both India and New Zealand, and had played well in their warm-up matches.\nHowever the Australians, led by the authoritative Allan Border were in a ruthless mood. They had home series victories against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, but had lost a one-off test to New Zealand since the 1989 Ashes series victory, and Border and his men were determined to defend the trophy. The Australians came out aggressively from the start, and combined with moments of bad-luck for the tourists, proved too much pressure for the England side to handle. The five test series was won 3-0 by Australia. However, unlike the 1989 series, only the final test was an outright walkover: England showed considerably more fight than they had two years previously, and in fact narrowly had the better of the first innings in the first two Tests, but in each case suffered a second-innings batting collapse leaving Australia a comparatively small target to chase. The third Test was almost a reverse of the first two, Australia taking a narrow first innings lead (England actually declaring while still short of the Australian total), but collapsing in the second innings: however, stalwart defence by their last two wickets held England up for a couple of hours on the last day, and left them with just not enough time to chase the runs. And in the fourth Test, Australia took a large first-innings lead, and declared in their second innings to set England an improbably high target in the final innings: but they made such a good fist of the chase that the match could have swung either way if an extra day had been available.\nTest series.\n3rd Test.\nAustralia lead the five test series 2–0."

        "text": "William James O'Brien (born October 23, 1969), nicknamed \"the Teapot\", is an American football coach who is currently the head coach at Boston College. Previously, he was the head coach of the Houston Texans from 2014 to 2020, and at Penn State from 2012 to 2013. Prior to Boston College, O'Brien was the offensive coordinator for the New England Patriots. After the Patriots parted ways with longtime head coach Bill Belichick at the end of the 2023 season, O’Brien was not retained by the Patriots. \nO'Brien began his coaching career in 1993 at Brown University before spending more than a decade coaching in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). He joined the New England Patriots in 2007, eventually serving as quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator in 2011. In 2012, O'Brien was hired by Penn State to take over a program that had just endured a child sexual abuse scandal perpetuated by one of its coaches. In his first season as head coach, O'Brien led the team to an 8–4 record and won ESPN's National Coach of the Year award. After the 2012 season, he garnered significant interest to return to the National Football League (NFL) as a head coach and interviewed with both the Philadelphia Eagles and the Cleveland Browns. However, O'Brien decided to stay at Penn State, citing that it would send a poor message to leave after just one season. After his second season, O'Brien left Penn State to become the head coach of the Texans.\nHis tenure with the Texans included a 51–31 Divisional Round loss to the eventual Super Bowl winning Kansas City Chiefs team after leading 24–0 in the second quarter, and a controversial trade of star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins to the Arizona Cardinals. In 2020, O'Brien was fired by the Texans, and was hired by Alabama to be offensive coordinator in 2021. In 2023, he was re-hired by the Patriots to be the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. Following the season, O'Brien was hired by Boston College to be their head coach.\nEarly life.\nO'Brien was born on October 23, 1969, in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts to John O'Brien and Anne Murphy O'Brien. He grew up in Andover, Massachusetts with his parents and two brothers, John and Tom. As a child, Bill played Little League. After graduating from St. John's Preparatory School in Danvers, O'Brien attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where he played defensive end and linebacker for the Brown Bears from 1990 to 1992.\nCoaching career.\nCollege assistant.\nO'Brien's first coaching position was at Brown, where he coached tight ends in 1993 and inside linebackers in 1994. He then spent the next three seasons (1995–1997) as an offensive graduate assistant at Georgia Tech.\nO'Brien then coached the Yellow Jackets' running backs from 1998 to 2000. In 1999, running back Sean Gregory ran for 837 yards with six touchdowns. The following year, running back Joe Burns ran for 908 yards with 12 touchdowns.\nFrom 2001 to 2002, O'Brien served as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach and was named an assistant head coach for the 2002 season. In 2002, O'Brien was hired as Notre Dame's offensive Coordinator before George O'Leary was dismissed. As offensive coordinator at Georgia Tech in 2001 and 2002, his teams averaged 31 and 21.5 points per game, respectively as the teams went 9–4 and 7–6. In 2001, running back Joe Burns ran for 1,165 yards with 14 touchdowns and quarterback George Godsey threw for 3,085 yards with 18 touchdowns. In 2002 under Chan Gailey, running back Tony Hollings ran for 633 yards with 11 touchdowns, and wide receiver Kerry Watkins recorded 1,050 receiving yards and five touchdowns.\nIn 2003, O'Brien left to coach running backs at the University of Maryland, where he spent two seasons. In 2003, running back Josh Allen ran for 922 yards and eight touchdowns while Bruce Perry ran for 713 yards and six touchdowns.\nAs offensive coordinator at Duke in 2005 and 2006, O'Brien's teams averaged 16.1 and 14.9 points per game. In 2006, quarterback Thaddeus Lewis threw for 2,134 yards and 11 touchdowns.\nNew England Patriots.\nAfter two seasons with Duke, O'Brien was hired by the New England Patriots as an offensive assistant on February 27, 2007. On February 21, 2008, O'Brien was promoted to wide receivers coach. He became the quarterbacks coach and offensive play-caller following the 2008 season after quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels left to become head coach of the Denver Broncos. O'Brien was promoted to offensive coordinator in February 2011. He spent six seasons coaching within the Patriots offense and four of those six seasons as the play-caller. During this period, the Patriots offense had some of their most productive seasons as did quarterback Tom Brady.\nThe Patriots gave the Jacksonville Jaguars permission to interview O'Brien for their head coaching vacancy during the Patriots' playoff bye week; O'Brien was scheduled for an interview, but never actually interviewed for the job. Instead, he interviewed with Penn State staff on January 5, 2012, was offered the head coach position and signed a four-year contract to become the Nittany Lions' coach. O'Brien continued as New England's offensive coordinator through Super Bowl XLVI.\nPenn State.\nO'Brien was hired as Penn State's 15th head football coach, replacing Joe Paterno, who had coached the team from 1966 until his dismissal in 2011. He was introduced as the head coach at a press conference on January 7, 2012.\nResponse to sanctions.\nDue to the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, on July 24, 2012, the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) sanctioned Penn State with a four-year postseason ban and loss of 40 scholarships over a four-year period.\nIn light of these NCAA sanctions, O'Brien issued the following statement:\n\"Today we receive a very harsh penalty from the NCAA and as head coach of the Nittany Lions football program, I will do everything in my power to not only comply, but help guide the University forward to become a national leader in ethics, compliance and operational excellence. I knew when I accepted the position that there would be tough times ahead. But I am committed for the long term to Penn State and our student athletes.\nI was then and I remain convinced that our student athletes are the best in the country. I could not be more proud to lead this team and these courageous and humble young men into the upcoming 2012 season. Together we are committed to building a better athletic program and university\".\nBecause of a clause in his contract, O'Brien received an automatic four-year extension that guaranteed an extra year for every year of sanctions put on the program.\n2012.\nIn O'Brien's first game as Penn State's head coach, the Nittany Lions lost to the Ohio University Bobcats by a score of 24–14. His first win as the Penn State head coach took place on September 15, 2012, with a 34–7 win against the United States Naval Academy at Beaver Stadium, University Park, PA. Despite the fallout from the Jerry Sandusky scandal, O'Brien's first season as coach at Penn State was far more successful than anticipated and resulted in a final record of 8–4. He collected the most wins for a first-year head coach in school history and was awarded Big Ten Coach of the Year on November 27, 2012.\nO'Brien was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year by both the media and the coaches. On December 8, 2012, he was named the national coach of the year by ESPN. On January 17, 2013, O'Brien was awarded the 2012 Paul \"Bear\" Bryant College Coach of the Year Award.\nNFL interest.\nIn January 2013, O'Brien interviewed for the head coaching position with the Cleveland Browns and Philadelphia Eagles. However, he decided to remain at Penn State, stating: \"I'm not a one-and-done guy. I made a commitment to these players at Penn State and that's what I am going to do. I'm not gonna cut and run after one year, that's for sure.\" \nHouston Texans.\nAfter Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak was fired on December 6, 2013, multiple reports stated that O'Brien was interested in returning to the NFL. On December 29, O'Brien met with the Texans for further discussion about the Texans' head coaching job. He was officially introduced as the Texans' head coach on January 2, 2014. The Texans had finished 2–14 in 2013 and owned the first overall selection in the 2014 NFL Draft, which they would use on South Carolina defensive end Jadeveon Clowney.\n2014 season.\nO'Brien earned his first win as a head coach when the Texans beat the Washington Redskins in the season-opener by a score of 17–6. In O'Brien's first season with the Texans, they finished with a 9–7 record and narrowly missed the playoffs.\n2015 season.\nIn 2015, the Texans again finished with a 9–7 record and finished atop the AFC South. In the of the playoffs, the Texans were blown out 30–0 by the Kansas City Chiefs.\n2016 season.\nIn 2016, the Texans finished with a 9–7 record for the third consecutive year and won their second consecutive AFC South title. The Texans defeated the Oakland Raiders by a score of 27–14 in the , but then lost on the road in the by a score of 34–16 to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots.\n2017 season.\nThe 2017 season marked O'Brien's first as an NFL head coach in which his team did not finish with a winning record. The Texans had a 4–12 record, losing nine of their final 10 games. This season saw the debut of quarterback Deshaun Watson, whom the Texans selected in the first round with the 12th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. However, Watson's season prematurely ended after he tore his ACL in practice prior to Week 9, which along with injuries to various other players contributed to the team's collapse.\n2018 season.\nOn January 13, 2018, O'Brien received a four-year contract extension.\nThe Texans started the season 0–3, but then went on a nine-game winning streak and finished atop the AFC South with an 11–5 record.

They were eliminated in the with a 51–31 road loss to the eventual Super Bowl LIV champion Kansas City Chiefs despite a 24–0 lead in the second quarter.\nOn January 28, 2020, O'Brien was appointed as the Texans' general manager. The Texans had gone the entire 2019 season with the position vacant. During the offseason, O'Brien traded wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft to the Arizona Cardinals for running back David Johnson, a 2020 second-round pick, and a 2021 fourth-round pick, a move that was highly criticized.\n2020 season.\nFollowing a 0–4 start in 2020, O'Brien was fired by the Texans on October 5, 2020. He finished his tenure in Houston with a regular-season record and a playoff record for a combined record of 54–52.\nAlabama.\nOn January 21, 2021, O'Brien was named the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Alabama under head coach Nick Saban, replacing Steve Sarkisian, who left to become the head coach at the University of Texas at Austin.\nDuring the 2021 season, the Crimson Tide finished 13–2 (7–1 SEC) after winning the Southeastern Conference Championship against Georgia 41–24 and beating Cincinnati 27–6 in the CFP Semi-final, setting up a rematch against Georgia in the CFP National Championship game. Alabama was ultimately defeated by Georgia in the National Championship game 33–18. O’Brien’s offensive unit during the 2021 season was led by quarterback Bryce Young, who set the school record for most passing yards in a single game (559) and won several Player of the Year awards in 2021, including the Heisman Trophy. \nDuring the 2022 season, Alabama finished 11–2 (6–2 SEC) and ended the season as SEC Western Division co-champions, ranked No. 5 the AP Poll with a 45–20 win over Kansas State in the Sugar Bowl. \nOver the course of O’Brien’s two years as OC, Alabama had a record of 24–4 and averaged over 41 points per game.O’Brien received significant criticism from fans during his tenure at Alabama due to the teams’ inability to win a National Championship, as well as a lack of player development at the quarterback position, despite Young winning the Heisman and being drafted first overall in the 2023 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers.\nReturn to New England.\nOn January 24, 2023, O'Brien was named the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach of the New England Patriots.

From 2011 to 2014, the race served as the World Triathlon Corporation's 5150 Series U.S. Championships. Previously, it was part of the ITU Triathlon World Cup series from 2008 to 2010. \nThe annual triathlon event attracted many of the top professional triathletes in the world due, in part, to having the largest prize purse awarded for Olympic-distance races in the sport (and from 2008 to 2012, the largest in the sport overall). In addition to professional triathletes, the triathlon event features competition among amateur athletes as well.\nHistory.\nThe first edition of the event, held June 17, 2007, featured the largest prize in triathlon history, at $200,000 each for the men's and women's elite winners through organizer and presenting sponsor Hy-Vee, a regional grocer. Approximately 10,000 spectators came downtown to the event, which was held in downtown Des Moines, swimming at Gray's Lake and finishing at the Iowa State Capitol.\nThe 2008 edition, held June 22, served as the final United States qualifier for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to flooding, it was moved to West Des Moines. Initially, there was uncertainty about its Olympic-qualifying status, as bacteria levels in nearby Blue Heron Lake left the swimming option in questionable status. However, officials confirmed that there would be swimming. As part of the Olympic qualifying Hunter Kemper and Sarah Haskins claimed the final United States Olympic spots as Rasmus Henning and three-time World Champion Emma Snowsill were the overall winners.\nIn 2011, the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) announced that the Hy-Vee triathlon would serve as the site for its 5150 Series U.S. Championships. The race will have the largest prize purse in triathlon, with $1 million total being paid out and $151,500 going to the men and women's winners. The race was moved from June to Labor Day weekend and returned downtown after three years in West Des Moines.\nIn 2013, Hy-Vee announced that it was reducing the total purse from $1.1 million to $500,000. The men's and women's winners received $100,000 each with $20,000 going to 2nd place and $15,000 to third.\nHy-Vee opted to discontinue the event following the 2014 edition.\nPremier Event Management, who formerly produced the Hy-Vee Triathlon, kept the event going as The Des Moines Triathlon in 2015–2016.\nBeginning in 2017, IMG and Premier Event Management, announced that the Des Moines Triathlon is now a part of the Escape Series."

        "title": "American Tennis Association",
        "text": "The American Tennis Association (ATA) is based in Largo, Maryland, outside Washington, D.C., and is the oldest African-American sports organization in the United States. The core of the ATA's modern mission continues to be promoting tennis as a sport for black people and developing junior tennis players, but the ATA welcomes people of all backgrounds.\nHistory.\nBy the early 1890s, despite the association of tennis with upper-class whites, the sport began to attract athletes at black colleges and universities, such as the Tuskegee Institute and Howard University. Because the sport was segregated, blacks established their own tennis clubs around the Baltimore and Washington, D.C., areas to encourage players and create competitions, including Baltimore's Monumental Tennis Club and Washington, D.C.'s Association Tennis Club.\nIn response to the USTA prohibition against black players in their tournaments, a group of African-American businessmen, college professors, and physicians founded the ATA in Washington on November 30, 1916. Their initial mission statement was to build the infrastructure for black tennis tournaments, to unite black players and fans, and to promote the game within African-American communities. The founders are listed as: Dr. Harry S. McCard, Dr. William H. Wright, Dr. B.M. Rhetta, Ralph Cook, Henry Freeman, and Tally Holmes.\nIn early tournaments hosted by the ATA, such popular black players as Margaret Peters, Roumania Peters, James Trouman, and Emanuel McDuffle competed. The first ATA National Championships were held the following August at Druid Hill Park in Baltimore, with competitions in men's singles, women's singles, and men's doubles. The earliest tournament recorded might be in early August 1922 at the Germantown, PA YWCA being billed as the \"American Tennis Association National Championship Tennis Tournament.\nThe ATA partnered with prominent black colleges and universities to host their tournaments. This ensured that the tournaments could provide the court time and housing for players and officials, particularly in the Jim Crow South where blacks were excluded from many public facilities and hotels. The colleges and clubs also had facilities for banquet halls and the types of large spaces that enabled the players and fans to organize politically around other issues, and provided space for high-profile events where the universities cultivated donors.\nIn the 1940s, there was a now famous match between Don Budge, the \"white\" singles champion at the time, and Jimmie McDaniel, the black champion at the time. Held in Harlem, July 29, 1940, at the Cosmopolitan Tennis Club, in front of a capacity crowd of more than 2,000 patrons. Budge won [6-1, 6-2], but the color-barrier had been broken. Even Althea Gibson had quite a bit of involvement with the organization.\n21st century ATA.\nSince 2013, the ATA has been negotiating with the City of Fort Lauderdale and Broward County to build a national training center and home for the Black Tennis Hall of Fame. The city and county were selected because of the preeminence of Sistrunk Boulevard, a historically black neighborhood. The interior of the Hall of Fame is slated to be designed by a Grand Slam champion.\nAs an effort to secure and maintain a lasting presence online, Rocky Warner a certified tennis coach in Atlanta, Georgia and creative marketing designer volunteered to design, develop and maintain the ATA website. Warner rebranded the ATA Logo (see image below) that currently represents the National Tournament that takes place in the summer. Through the development of the website, Mr. Warner would sit on the executive board as he presented by-laws to the executive committee to represent the Southern Region of the ATA, known as the ATA SOUTH. (https://www.atasouth.org)\nWarner's efforts to unify the black tennis south under the ATA SOUTH has been slow as he first needed to build a grassroots youth tennis program in Atlanta. Sugar Creek Golf &amp; Tennis is the home to the ATA SOUTH and the only facility in Georgia with over 100 active black youth learning, training and competing within USTA team tennis, tournament play, Atlanta Lawn Tennis Association league play, UTR, WTN and ATA Regional Rally's. Warner has successfully directed ATA sanctioned tournaments and WTN events.\nAs part of the USTA’s partnership with the ATA, the National Campus will welcome the National Championships to its ground at least once every three to four years.\nThe 101st American Tennis Association National Championships were played at the USTA National campus between July 28 – August 4, 2018, with the final results posted.\nThe 102nd American Tennis Association National Championships were played in Fort Lauderdale in 2021.\nChampionships.\nFirst held in August 1917 at Druid Hill Park in Baltimore."

        "title": "Wimbledon and Sutton Railway",
        "text": "The Wimbledon and Sutton Railway (W&amp;SR) was a railway company established by an Act of Parliament in 1910 to build a railway line in Surrey (now south-west London) from Wimbledon to Sutton via Merton and Morden in the United Kingdom. The railway was promoted by local landowners hoping to increase their land's value through its housing development. It was initially planned that services on the railway would be operated by the London Underground's District Railway (DR) as an extension of its existing service from Wimbledon.\nDelays in finding the funding, opposition from the two mainline companies that the line was intended to connect, and World War I, led to the start of construction work being delayed until 1927. The line was completed and opened in January 1930, although the planned extension of the DR was not implemented and the service was provided by the Southern Railway. The opening of the line stimulated residential development as planned. Still, competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant that the line did not achieve the hoped-for passenger numbers.\nToday, the railway is part of the Sutton Loop Line from Streatham through Wimbledon to Sutton.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, the Surrey villages of Wimbledon and Sutton experienced rapid residential growth, stimulated by the railways running through their areas, with landowners in both areas profiting from the development of new suburban housing on their previously rural estates. Less accessible to the railways, the parishes of Merton and Morden, which lay between Wimbledon and Sutton, remained largely rural and, starting in the 1880s, a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring a new line through the area and increase the value of the land.\nUnsuccessful private bills were presented to Parliament in 1884, 1888, 1890 and 1891 seeking permission to construct a new railway between the London and South Western Railway's (L&amp;SWR's) line through Wimbledon station to the north and the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway's (LB&amp;SCR's) Sutton station in the south.\nEstablishment.\nOn 7 October 1908, engineer H. D. Searles-Wood and Sir George Smallman organised a meeting to consider a new plan for a Wimbledon to Sutton railway, and a committee was formed to promote the plan. A further meeting, held in 1909, included landowner William Innes, nephew of John Innes, the developer of Merton Park. It was estimated that £350,000 (approximately £ today) of capital was required, only part of which was to be provided by the promoters. Some of the remainder was sought from the DR (now the London Underground's District line) which the promoters hoped would operate the service over the line by extending its service from Wimbledon. On 16 November 1909, notice of the intention to bring a private bill before Parliament was published. \nThe bill proposed a line with ten stations, to be operated by electric trains, which would provide a service taking 32 minutes to reach Waterloo from Sutton. The LB&amp;SCR opposed the line on the grounds that it would compete with its own services from Sutton to Central London, and claimed that its own planned electrification of its lines to Victoria and London Bridge would offer quicker journeys than the W&amp;SR route. The LB&amp;SCR also believed that a connection for the W&amp;SR would give the DR service the chance to extend its service to Epsom and beyond. The L&amp;SWR had concerns that its tracks from Putney to Wimbledon, over which the DR provided the service, were already at capacity and could not cope with the extended DR service to Sutton.\nNonetheless, the \"Wimbledon and Sutton Railway Act 1910\" (10 Edw. 7 &amp; 1 Geo. 5. c. xlvii) received royal assent on 26 July 1910. The act approved the railway and allowed for the L&amp;SWR connection at Wimbledon, but did not allow for a connection to the LB&amp;SCR at Sutton; instead the W&amp;SR was to build a separate station with a pedestrian connection to the LB&amp;SCR's station. Intermediate stations were approved for Elm Grove in Wimbledon, adjacent to the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club's original grounds, Cannon Hill, Merton Park, Morden, Elm Farm, Sutton Common, Collingwood Road and Cheam. Power for the line was to be supplied by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), owner of the DR, from its Lots Road Power Station.\nDelays.\nFrom the beginning, the company encountered delays in implementing its plans. Neither of the two main line railway companies were interested in investing in the line, so the W&amp;SR's promoters approached the DR for assistance. In 1911, Albert Stanley, managing director of the DR, agreed that it would finance the construction, if the promoters would guarantee a return of £6,000 per year for ten years. The DR was to cover any shortfall below 4.5 per cent return on capital. To provide additional capacity for Sutton trains on the DR's Wimbledon branch, the DR published a bill on 21 November 1911 seeking permission to construct additional tracks on the L&amp;SWR owned section from Wimbledon to East Putney. The works were approved by the Metropolitan District Railway Act 1912 (2 &amp; 3 Geo. 5. c. lxv), which received assent on 7 August 1912. The L&amp;SWR was to build the additional tracks with the DR covering the cost.\nOn 22 November 1912, both the W&amp;SR and the DR published notices that further bills would be submitted to extend the time limit imposed by the 1910 act for the compulsory purchase of the land needed for the railway, to enable the W&amp;SR to raise additional capital, and to give the DR powers to take over the W&amp;SR. The DR bill contained provisions to increase the capacity on the DR-owned section of the Wimbledon branch, by constructing further additional tracks from south of Parsons Green to south of Walham Green station (now Fulham Broadway).\nThe requested extension of time and other powers were granted by the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway Act 1913 (3 &amp; 4 Geo. 5. c. xxxvii), given royal assent on 15 August 1913. In December 1912, the original promoters were replaced on the W&amp;SR board by UERL nominees and the shares in the company were transferred to the UERL or its shareholders. In late 1913, changes were made to the track layout at Wimbledon station, including a new platform for use by the W&amp;SR line trains, and land for the junctions with the L&amp;SWR mainline was purchased.\nOn 16 November 1914, after the outbreak of war, the DR gave notice of another bill which sought a further extension of time for land purchases. The DR was also to stand guarantor for the W&amp;SR and to lease the W&amp;SR's undertakings, in effect taking over the W&amp;SR. This was granted under the Metropolitan District Railway Act 1915 (5 &amp; 6 Geo. 5. c. xxii) on 24 June 1915. War-time restrictions prevented any construction and so extensions to the earlier acts were granted each year from 1918 to 1922 to give a final date of 26 July 1924 for completion of the compulsory purchase.\nRevised plans.\nIn November 1922, notices of new bills to be placed before Parliament were published by the W&amp;SR, and by the UERL's subsidiaries the London Electric Railway (LER) and the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR, now part of the London Underground's Northern line). Taken together, the bills brought significant changes to the plans for the Wimbledon to Sutton line.\nThe C&amp;SLR was an underground railway running in deep tunnels. In 1922, its line ran from Euston to Clapham Common. The C&amp;SLR proposed to extend it for \"6 miles, 1 furlong and 7.2 chains\" () from Clapham Common through Balham, Tooting, Merton (South Wimbledon) and Morden, to connect to the route of the W&amp;SR and then continue to Sutton. The LER, C&amp;SLR, and DR would invest in the construction of the W&amp;SR, for which the estimated cost had risen to £1.7 million (approximately £ today). The DR would operate trains over the W&amp;SR from Sutton to Wimbledon and thence to Central London; the C&amp;SLR would operate trains over the southern end of the W&amp;SR from Sutton to Morden, then via the new C&amp;SLR extension to Clapham Common and northwards. The plans also included the construction of a depot at Morden for use by DR and C&amp;SLR trains.\nThe Southern Railway (SR), successor to both the L&amp;SWR and the LB&amp;SCR under the 1923 grouping of railways, objected to the plan to extend the C&amp;SLR line to Sutton – Sir Herbert Walker, General Manager of the SR, described the proposals as an \"invasion\" of the SR's territory allocated by the grouping agreement. Walker proposed a limited extension of the CS&amp;LR as far as Tooting and offered to allow the C&amp;SLR's trains to run to Wimbledon via a connection to the SR's Tooting to Wimbledon line. He also proposed that the SR should build the W&amp;SR instead. The UERL rejected Walker's plan, claiming that the entire extension to Morden was needed as that was the only place to build the necessary depot. Without the compromise arrangement, the House of Lords rejected the whole scheme but the House of Commons, which wanted the Underground's service to be extended from Clapham, encouraged further negotiations between the UERL and SR.\nIn July 1923, an agreement was made that the SR would withdraw its objection in exchange for a transfer of the UERL's interests in the W&amp;SR. The District railway would be allowed to operate to Sutton via the W&amp;SR route, although this was not pursued further. The Wimbledon and Sutton Railway Act 1923 (13 &amp; 14 Geo. 5. c. xcvii), the London Electric Railway Act 1923 (13 &amp; 14 Geo. 5. c. ciii) and the City and South London Railway Act 1923 (13 &amp; 14 Geo. 5. c. ci) all received royal assent on 2 August 1923. The SR arranged for the take-over and winding-up of the W&amp;SR, which was authorised by the Southern Railway Act 1924 (14 &amp; 15 Geo. 5. c. lxvi).\nThe C&amp;SLR soon started construction of its southern extension which opened to a terminus at Morden on 13 September 1926, with a depot south of the station and within of the W&amp;SR route, although no connection was made between the two lines. Without the extension of the District line to Sutton, the additional tracks between Wimbledon and Putney were not required and the work was not carried out. The additional tracks between Parsons Green and Fulham Broadway were constructed, but have only been used as sidings. Once the C&amp;SLR line was opened, the Underground company established a network of bus routes to the south, using Morden station as their hub. These routes had a significant impact on the SR's operations in the area, with the SR estimating in 1928 that it had lost approximately four million passengers per year. The UERL, though, was able to demonstrate that its passenger numbers on its buses to Sutton station were actually more than double those for Morden.\nConstruction.\nConstruction of the line from Wimbledon to Sutton was slower. Work started at Wimbledon in October 1927, but property purchases were not completed until the middle of 1928 and the contractor, Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons, did not begin work at Sutton until July 1928. The landscape traversed by the line is undulating and rises from about above sea-level at Wimbledon to about at Sutton. Designed for operation exclusively by the electric multiple unit, extensive embankments and cuttings were constructed and steep gradients up to 1 in 44 (2.27%) and tight-radius curves were employed. Only 35 chains () of the route was built as level track and 24 bridges were required, the largest of which spans over the A24 close to Morden Park.\nThe station buildings at the two end stations, Wimbledon and Sutton, were rebuilt between 1927 and 1930 and six stations were constructed at Wimbledon Chase, South Merton, Morden South, St. Helier, Sutton Common and West Sutton. Fewer stations were built than planned in 1910 and only two of the intermediate stations (South Merton and Sutton Common) were on sites originally planned. With the exception of South Merton, which was built without (being accessed from the road by a long descending staircase), all stations had white stone or concrete-faced buildings, with access to the platforms by stairs up or down from street level. Provided with long island platforms, the stations could accommodate trains eight coaches long.\nOpening and Operation.\nWork from Wimbledon to South Merton was completed quickly, so that services could begin running as a single-track operation on 7 July 1929. The remainder of the line opened on 5 January 1930, more than forty-five years after the first Wimbledon to Sutton link was proposed.\nAs hoped by the original promoters, the opening of the line stimulated the construction of new areas of private and public residential development throughout the 1930s, although large areas remain as parks and playing fields. The St. Helier Estate was completed in 1936. The opening of the Wimbledon to Sutton line and the C&amp;SLR led the population of the parish of Morden, previously the most rural of the areas through which the lines passed, to increase from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931 and 35,417 in 1951.\nOrdinary ticket sales from Morden South station increased from 9,840 in 1930 to 50,817 in 1938 but, from the SR's perspective, the line was not a great success. The service, originally operating from West Croydon to Holborn Viaduct station in Central London, was slow and indirect and many of the potential passengers from the line's catchment area continued to use the buses and tube route via Morden.\nGoods services operated on the line, to a goods yard at St. Helier station, until it was closed in 1963, and to an Express Dairies bottling plant adjacent to Morden South station, which opened in 1954 and closed in 1992.\nThe line is now called the St Helier Line, and forms part of the Sutton Loop, served by trains from Thameslink and Southern.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The centre was opened on 18 November 1922 by the Auckland Lawn Tennis Association (now Tennis Auckland) on grounds leased from the Auckland City Council, that are a part of Pukekawa / Auckland Domain. Originally the centre had nine outdoor grass courts as well as a stand for 400 spectators. In 1977 the surface of the courts, 12 at the time, was changed to hardcourt. It currently hosts the ASB Classic for both men and women on consecutive weeks in January each year before the Australian Open. The centre is also a regular host of New Zealand Davis Cup team ties, including the 1975 and 1977 Eastern Zone finals. It is located on Stanley Street next to the Domain entrance.\nThe centre has twelve courts, all floodlit GreenSet hardcourts. Three are indoors and nine outdoors including the stadium court. As well as tennis, the centre court has hosted an International Beach Volleyball Tournament on the week after the ASB Classic.\nThe venue underwent redevelopment in 2010, adding advanced gym facilities, a rooftop swimming pool, a player lounge and bar, and reconfigured court layout. Plans were also made to add a retractable roof, but as of 2020 the roof project was awaiting government funding to proceed."

        "text": " \nThe India men's national basketball team represents India in international men's basketball. It is controlled by Basketball Federation of India.\nThe team made significant improvements as the sports of basketball is becoming more popular.\nA 1936 founding member of FIBA Asia, India has one of Asia's longest basketball traditions. Throughout its history, Team India qualified for the FIBA Asia Championship 26 times and is placed in the top five in appearances in this tournament. Further, India's basketball team won four gold medals and one silver medal at the South Asian Games and became the most successful team in the South Asian region. India have also won the SABA Championship six times. Team India celebrated its victory at the 2014 Lusofonia Games after they finished the tournament with a 4–0 record as they beat 11–time African Champions Angola in the final.\nIts most famous moment came at the 2014 FIBA Asia Cup with the win against home favorites and most successful Asian team China by seven points. This win has been labelled as the \"biggest basketball win in the nation's history.\"\nHistory.\nIndia appeared at the international stage for the first time ever at the 1965 Asian Basketball Championship where it started out as moderately competitive. India became a regular at the event and had their most successful tournament in 1975 when the team even reached the final four.\nPlagued by a lack of popularity and support for basketball at home, at times, India faded into oblivion and only had a handful of successful performances. Its most noteworthy tournament appearance was at the 1980 Summer Olympics when the team got its chance to represent Asia due to the cancellations of some teams who took part in the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. A few of the world's top basketball powers at that time (such as the United States and Canada) withdrew from the tournament. India finished 12th out of 12 in the Olympics after getting knocked out in the preliminary round by losing all three of their matches and then losing all five of their matches in the Classification round.\nWhile the results did not go India's way one game in particular caught the attention of basketball fans worldwide. India played against the Australian Team, one of the world's top basketball teams. India, which was made up solely of voluntary basketball players competed against the elite team of Australia for almost the whole game until it finally ceded to the Boomers 75–93 after leading at halftime 41–37.\nMany Indian players also made headlines while in the Soviet Union as well. Ajmer Singh gained worldwide attention as he was amongst the top 10 shooters there and became the 10th best pivot player in the tournament there. The late 90s saw the emergence of Sozhasingarayer Robinson, the first Indian basketball player who gained considerable international attention. Robinson led India to a surprising victory over South Korea, one of Asia's top teams. In 2005, however, Robinson complained that the structure and support for basketball in India was still mediocre and government officials did not do enough to support the sport. As a protest, he retired from the national team.\nAt the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship India was coached by former Sacramento Kings head coach Kenny Natt. In 2012, former NBA D-League and U.S. college coach, Scott Flemming, took over the team. Under his supervision, the team won the South Asia Championship in 2014. India had two wins and finished 3 places higher (11th) in the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship than in 2011. In 2014, the \"Young Cagers\" (as team India is often nicknamed) won the Lusofonia games with wins over Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and Angola in the gold medal game. This was Team India's first title ever in a non-Asian competition. In the 2014 FIBA Asia Cup India pulled off the biggest win in their 80-year history by defeating China on their home court 65–58. The establishment of a professional league was a major step in continuing this recent success the Indian team had experienced. India continued their dominance in South Asia by winning further South Asian Championships in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2021.\nHonours.\nIntercontinental\nContinental\nPast rosters.\n1980 Olympic Games: finished 12th among 12 teams\n1997 Asian Championship: finished 11th among 15 teams\nPankaj Malik, B.S.

        "text": "St. George's Golf and Country Club (originally \"The Royal York Golf Club\") is a golf course and country club located in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the west end neighbourhood of Islington.\nHistory.\nThe club was originally established in 1909 by Robert Home Smith from Stratford-upon-Avon, England who purchased the area of land which was located on the banks of the Humber River.\nThe club was built in co-ordination with the construction of the Royal York Hotel, which was being designed in downtown Toronto, with the plan being that the golf facilities would be necessary for the guests staying in the hotel. Leading the construction of the hotel was Sir Edward Wentworth Beatty, who was known to be acquainted with Smith. Leading construction of the golf course was Stanley Thompson, the leading Canadian golf course architect. At its Islington Avenue location, the course opened in 1929. The course, under the Royal York name, hosted the Canadian Open in 1933. However, in 1935 Smith died, and his executor trustee Godfrey S. Pettit, became president of the club.\nIn 1946 the name of the country club was changed from \"The Royal York Golf Club\" to \"St. George's Golf and Country Club\" as a result of the financial arrangement with the Canadian Pacific Railway (of which Beatty was president) ending. The club has been rated several times in the top three of Canada and amongst the top 100 in the world\nSt. George's has hosted the Canadian Open six times:\nThe course has been extended in length, to 7,025 yards, par 71, to attract more Canadian Open events. While the course is universally regarded as outstanding, issues of logistics, access, and available space in a crowded neighbourhood make hosting a tournament of this magnitude somewhat problematic. Logistical steps taken to host the Open include closing the busy thoroughfare Islington Avenue before and during the tournament, using the nearby Islington Golf Club's practice facilities, shuttling the players back and forth to Islington Golf Club, limiting the number of spectators who can access the course, and starting play for the first two rounds from the 1st and 9th tees (normally it would be the 1st and 10th tees). St. George's has been announced as the host for the Canadian Open in 2022.\nThe club has also hosted the Canadian Women's Open five times: 1975, 1978, 1980, 1982, and 1984. The course was also the host venue for golf of the 2017 Invictus Games.\nThe 2020 RBC Canadian Open tournament, which had been scheduled at the club, was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario. After a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian Open returned in 2022.\nCurling.\nIn 2020, members of the golf club voted to discontinue curling operations at St. George's, citing that curling was \"no longer a good fit for golf\". Since then, the curling space has been replaced by an indoor golf facility and pickle ball court."

        "title": "Notre Dame Rugby Football Club",
        "text": "The Notre Dame Rugby Football Club is the official rugby football club at the University of Notre Dame. It is the oldest collegiate rugby club in the Midwest and currently plays in the National Collegiate Rugby (NCR) D1, one of the highest levels of college rugby in the U.S.\nHistory.\nFounding and early years.\nEvidence of rugby matches being played at Notre Dame's Carter Field date back to the 1890s marking the sports origin at the university contemporaneous to that of the university's football team. The modern Notre Dame Rugby Football Club was founded in 1961 as one of the first collegiate rugby clubs in the Midwest. In the spring of 1962, Notre Dame narrowly defeated Wisconsin in the first club rugby match played in the Midwest.\nIn 1963, the Notre Dame Rugby Football Club was officially founded as a club sport. The team was founded by Bob Mier, a student who participated in the Wisconsin game the previous spring. With supervising faculty member and acting head coach Kenneth Featherstone, the team formed and competed in the Midwest Conference.\nIn April 1968, the Fighting Irish, chaperoned by Professor Peter Brady, traveled to Ireland for several exhibition matches. They went 2–3 against Irish teams, including losses to the Dublin League Champions, Navan, and runner-up, Delvin. Notre Dame was also defeated by University College Cork but gained victories over the Limerick Rovers and Thurles. The Fighting Irish traveled to Ireland again in March 1974. On this trip, Notre Dame went 2-2, losing to Tralee and again to University College Cork while defeating another Limerick team, the Bohemians, and University College Dublin.\nNational prominence.\nAfter suffering a losing record their first season, the A-side went on to have 3 winning seasons obtaining a 53–12 record. Likewise, the B-side also dominated its opposition obtaining a 40–1 record that included a 33-game winning streak which was finally ended by former SuperLeague side, the Chicago Lions.\nDuring the 1965-1966 year, the Fighting Irish won the Commonwealth Cup, Nassau Invitational, Midwest Tournament, Irish Challenge Cup, and the All-College Tournament. These wins resulted in the Fighting Irish being named Collegiate Rugby National Champions by Sports Illustrated. After this season, Notre Dame offered the rugby team the chance to become a varsity sport, but this was turned down via players' vote. Notre Dame was even named a \"national rugby power\" by the Washington Post.\nIn the fall season of 1972, the Fighting Irish defeated longtime rival, the Chicago Lions 15–12, upsetting the 1972 Midwest Champs. The game has been considered one of the most brutal matches in recent years. One player was knocked unconscious in the first minute of play with two others being removed at half-time, one with a broken jaw and the other with a broken leg. An English official said afterwards, \"I've seen teams play in Holland, England, and on the continent (Europe), but I've never seen a team hit like Notre Dame did that day.\" The next week, Notre Dame won a hard-fought victory over rival and defending National Champions Palmer College of Chiropractic 16–15. The Irish finished the fall season at 11–2. During the spring season of 1973, Notre Dame beat rival Ohio State and reclaimed the Silver Cup, a trophy passed to the victor of that game. The Fighting Irish finished the spring at 12–1, winning the Midwest Championship over the Chicago Lions, but losing the National Championship to repeat champions, Palmer. The 1975 B-Team went undefeated included a 3–0 victory over the Lions in their final game on Mark Keown's 30 yard penalty kick from the right sideline.\nThe team was suspended by the university for violations of the code of conduct and not reinstated until the early 1980s.\nFrom 1985 to 1992 the Irish returned to regional prowess, under the coaching of Art Maerlender winning or placing in the IPRU tournament in 1985, 86, 87, 88 and 89. The 1987–88 team had a combined fall and spring record of 16–2. The team joined the Chicago Area Rugby Football Union in 1990 and made it to the Midwest final round in each year from 1990 through 1994. The late Col. John Stephens was the long-serving faculty advisor who died in 1996. Incidents the next year invoked the \"double-secret probation,\" that resulted in the club's banishment from campus.\nBehavioral incidents.\nThe university placed the rugby club on probation twice in the 1980s as a result of bad behavior. The combined weight of these events and inexcusable misconduct during the 1995 spring season ultimately led to the club's disbandment on August 3, 1995.\nSouth Bend Old Boys RFC.\nTom McGinty, Dave Bishop, and John Friskel started a club team in the fall of 2000, eventually dubbed the South Bend Old Boys RFC, after playing for the South Bend blues the previous year and longing for a university-affiliated team. This club was successful over the next three years at scheduling matches with high-profile teams like Michigan, Michigan State, and Tennessee, surviving and competing (and racking up an impressive record) as a self-supporting club carpooling to away games.\nOut Side Irish.\nThe OIRFC was a rugby club that was unaffiliated with the University of Notre Dame but was composed of Notre Dame and Indiana University of South Bend students. The club was founded in the fall of 2004 by junior, Mike Schmitt and sophomore, Don Greiwe as an attempt to take the team in a more serious direction. In their first season the Out Side Irish only managed to schedule a few games due to low numbers and accessibility. They practiced only once per week and barely could scrap together fifteen live bodies to play matches, however they were able to recruit a strong freshman class and the next spring managed a record of 3–4.\nReinstatement (2007).\nAt the end of the 2006 season John Gallagher, Christopher Liedl, and Chris Harrington put together a formal application for club status with the university. After drafting a club constitution, and with the support of president Don Greiwe and vice president Brian Fallon, the club filed for official recognition. Practicing three times a week and posting a record of 9–1–1 the rugby club made a strong case for itself. With the support of numerous alumni and donors and after an application period of over six months the team was recognized in May 2007 and became the Notre Dame Rugby Football Club.\nOn May 18, 2007, 12 years after being banished, the university officially reinstated the Notre Dame Rugby Football Club. As an official club, the NDRFC's goals are to field a rugby team representing the University of Notre Dame, to compete with other club teams while abiding by the rules of the University of Notre Dame, USA Rugby, and the International Rugby Board (IRB), and to promote the physical education, mental and social well-being, and sportsmanship of members of the club through participation in and the playing of rugby.\nFollowing their reinstatement, the club rose rapidly through the Midwest RFU ranks after hiring Coach Sean O'Leary. O'Leary transferred from Northeastern University and acts as coach of the USA U17 national team. In the fall of their first season the Irish finished 8-1-1 against Division II competition, sparking a move up to Division I in the spring and an inclusion in the Eastern Division of the Midwestern Division I league.\nCollege Premier League\nThe Irish continued their successful ascent into the ranks of college rugby's elite programs over the next few years. Although they struggled in their first season in Division I, under the supervision of Coach O'Leary and a strong Class of 2011, the program consistently improved, becoming a Midwest powerhouse. USA Rugby recognized this when, in 2010, they invited the NDRFC to join its inaugural College Premier Division, composed of the top 31 teams in American college rugby. As a young program, the Irish were expected to struggle in the league, yet turned heads by compiling a 3–3 record and recording wins against programs such as LSU, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. In both 2010 and 2011, forward Nick Civetta was named an All-American, while scrumhalf Andy O’Connor consistently impressed and was awarded a position on the Midwest Select Side both years. Prop John Lalor was also named to the side in 2011.\nNBC Collegiate Rugby 7s Championship\nDue to the admittance of rugby 7s to the 2016 Olympics, 7s began to grow quickly in the US. In June 2010, NBC broadcast the inaugural Collegiate Championship Invitational (later the Collegiate Rugby Championship). Again, Notre Dame was recognized as a top-flight program, both in its rugby talent and marketability. A young team in 2010, the 2011 Irish CRC had not lost a single player to graduation. Their cohesion showed as they battled through the tournament's “Group of Death,” competing against 2010 champion Utah and eventual 2011 champion Dartmouth, as well as Catholic rival Boston College. Two last minute tries in the Utah and Dartmouth games relegated the Irish to the Challenger Bracket, yet they persevered and beat Midwest rival Ohio State 28–7 in the quarterfinals and a strong Navy side 12–10 in the semifinals to set up a match with LSU in the Challenger Finals. The side Notre Dame opened their CPD season against with a hard-fought win were not to be denied this time, however, and pulled out a strong win over the Irish. Nevertheless, the tournament was a success for Coach O’Leary's first class, showing just how far the program had progressed in a few short years—from nonexistent to nationally televised.\nTraditions.\nCrest.\nThe NDRFC crest was designed by Jaime Urquijo and Don Whitley following the club's reinstatement in 2007. In the center of the crest is a stylized Celtic cross, reminiscent of both Notre Dame's Irish heritage and its status as a Catholic university. Atop the arms of the cross is the club's original 1961 date of establishment. 1961 is listed instead of 2007 so as to stress the continuity between the old club and the new club and to recognize the three decades of successful history that existed prior to the club's disbandment.\nAt the bottom of the crest are the Notre Dame monogram and a shamrock similar to the one used on Notre Dame's basketball jerseys. These symbols reaffirm the club's strong desire to be affiliated with the university. The use of a pre-existing Notre Dame shamrock instead of the IRFU design (which was used as the club's logo when they were the Out Side Irish) or the London Irish variant (which appeared in the first versions of the crest) is particularly significant in this regard. It is also referencing the NDRFC's logo from the 1970s.\nJerseys.\nWhile the A-Side jerseys bear the Notre Dame colors of blue and gold, the B-Side jerseys are almost identical to those used by the Out Side Irish (which were imitations of the jerseys worn by the Irish national team). The kelly green of the B-Side jersey is a tribute to both the pre-1995 Notre Dame Rugby club as well as the Out Side Irish, whose tireless dedication and perseverance led to the club's reinstatement. Additionally, it recalls the famous green jerseys used on occasion by the football team.\nThe two different jersey designs are intended to remind club members that it is a privilege and an honor to wear the Blue and Gold of Notre Dame - one that is only granted to someone who has earned a place on the A-Side."

        "text": "The 2007 Pan American Games, officially known as the XV Pan American Games, were a continental multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from July 13 to July 29, 2007. At the Games, 5,633 athletes selected from 42 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 332 events in 34 sports divided into 47 disciplines. According to the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Pan American Games, 2,196 medals were awarded for every winning athlete, including individuals from teams, during 334 awards ceremonies.\nThirty-two nations earned medals at the Games, and nineteen won at least one gold medal. Antigua and Barbuda and El Salvador won their first ever gold medals. The Netherlands Antilles, the Bahamas, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, the Cayman Islands, Panama, the Dominican Republic and Saint Lucia improved their position in the general medal table compared to the 2003 Pan American Games, held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\nFor the first time since the 1955 Games, American athletes did not win more than 100 gold medals. The United States led the medal count for the 12th time, winning 97 gold medals. It also won the silver medal count, with 88, and the total medals count, with 237. Competitors from the host nation, Brazil, led the bronze medal count for the first time, with 65. Brazil won 52 gold medals, 40 silver medals and a total of 157 medals, its best ever overall performance and best placement in the medal table since the 1967 Games.\nMedal table.\nThe ranking in this table is based on the official medal standings approved by the executive committee of the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) on December 18, 2007. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals won by the athletes representing a nation. (In this context, a nation is an entity represented by a NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.\nIn boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals were awarded in each weight class. In baseball, atypical rainfall during the games forced the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Pan American Games to rearrange the schedule, and the competition for the bronze medal never took place. Mexico had to leave on the previously assigned date without playing for the third position. Therefore, the technical delegate ruled that Mexico and Nicaragua were each to be awarded a bronze medal.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChanges in medal standings.\nThe event closed on July 29 without a positive test for illegal drugs. During the closing ceremony of the Games, the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee called them the \"cleanest [Games] yet\". Mario Vazquez Raña, president of PASO, stated at the closing ceremony that the games had been the cleanest in Pan American history. However, shortly after the games ended, prohibited substances were detected in 4 of 1,262 tests. Following procedures recommended by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the PASO Medical Commission conducted an extensive review and submitted a report to the PASO Executive Committee. On December 18, 2007, the executive committee unanimously approved it, stripping the medals from four athletes and ordering an adjustment of the medal table.\nBrazilian swimmer Rebeca Gusmão tested positive for high levels of testosterone and was stripped of her four medals. She had won two gold medals in the 50 metre freestyle and 100 metre freestyle competitions, and another two medals with the Brazilian team; a silver medal at the 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay competition, and a bronze medal at the 4 × 100 metre medley relay competition. Gusmão's gold medal in the 50 metre freestyle went to Arlene Semeco of Venezuela, the silver medal to Vanessa García Vega of Puerto Rico, and the bronze medal to Flávia Delaroli of Brazil. She also lost her gold medal to Semeco in the 100 metre freestyle; Delaroli received the silver medal, and García Vega received the bronze medal. The Brazilian swimming team lost its silver medal in the 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay competition to the Canadian team, which passed the bronze medal to the Venezuelan team; and in the 4 × 100 metre medley relay competition Brazil lost its bronze medal to the Bahamian team.\nBrazilian weightlifter Fabrício Mafra lost his bronze medal in the men's 105 kg competition. He tested positive for abnormal levels of testosterone, and Damian Abbiate, the competitor from Argentina, received the medal in his place. Colombian cyclist Libardo Niño Corridor, who won a silver medal in the men's individual road time trial, tested positive for the banned substance erythropoietin (EPO), and consequently the silver medal went to Matias Medici of Argentina and the bronze medal to Dominique Rollin of Canada. Nicaraguan baseball player Pedro Wilder Rayo Rojas tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid boldenone, and lost his bronze medal from the men's baseball competition, but his teammates kept their medals."

        "text": "Joseph Esposito (born September 21, 1966) is an American basketball coach. Esposito is currently the associate head coach at The University of Missouri Kansas City and still a Basketball Analyst on ESPN Las Vegas on his free time. He was the head coach at Cesar Chavez HS in Phoenix, Arizona for two years and before that was an assistant coach for head men's basketball coach Marvin Menzies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). Esposito spent twelve years with Hall of Fame Coach Tubby Smith as an assistant basketball coach and Recruiting Coordinator at University of Memphis, an assistant coach and Recruiting Coordinator at Texas Tech University and the director of basketball operations and assistant coach at the University of Minnesota. He has head coaching experience at Assumption College, Angelo State University and The Villages Charter Schools. He was the associate head coach at Tennessee State University working for Frankie Allen.\nCoaching career.\nRoosevelt High School.\nEsposito's first coaching job came as the assistant basketball coach at FDR in Hyde Park, NY for legendary Hall of fame coach Duane Davis. Esposito also was named assistant AD and assistant baseball coach while serving there for two seasons. \nAssumption College.\nEsposito was an assistant coach, associate head coach, and head coach at NCAA Division II powerhouse Assumption College in Worcester, Massachusetts. The Greyhounds rattled off three straight Northeast-10 Conference Championships in 1990, 1991 and 1992, and notched a pair of NCAA Division II Tournament regional appearances. The Greyhounds averaged 22 wins a season and no team in the NE-10 has ever won three straight championships like they did. Assumption also set single-season records for wins and winning streaks at the school with Esposito on staff.\nTennessee State University.\nEsposito played a vital role at HBCU Tennessee State University as the associate head coach from 1995-98 for head coach Frankie Allen. Esposito was responsible for recruiting three Ohio Valley Conference Freshman of the Year award winners. Only one other school in the nation has had three straight Freshman of the Year award winner Georgia Tech. His 1996-97 and 1997-98 recruiting classes were ranked among the nation’s top 30 by Hoop Scoop. He also worked as an academic counselor while at Tennessee State improving their team GPA to over a 3.0 and graduated every player while he was there.\nAngelo State University.\nEsposito was hired at Angelo State in March of 1998 by athletic director Jerry Vandergriff. He took over one of the lowest ranked Division II programs in the Nation. ASU had three straight last place finished and averaged 2 conference wins a season those three years. At Angelo State University, his team recorded 118 wins and left the school with the highest winning percentage of any coach in the program's history. \nIn his first season at Angelo State in 1999, Esposito posted the best turnaround in Division II by any rookie head coach, improving the Rams' record by seven victories and having the first winning season since 1994. In his second year, he took the Rams to the Lone Star Conference Tournament and wins over nationally ranked Midwestern State and Central Oklahoma. The 2000 season his team posted a 20-win season, which was the second-best record in school history, surpassed only by Esposito's 2001 team that won 24 games.\nIn 2000-01, in just three season, the Rams advanced to the NCAA Division II Tournament for the first time in 10 years and the third time in school history. Angelo State won the Lone Star Conference South Division Championship with a 22-8 record, which tied the highest single-season win total in school history and 11-1 Conference record best ever in the Lone Star Conference. In addition, Esposito was voted LSC South Coach of the Year in 2001.\nIn 2002, Esposito led the Rams to its fourth consecutive winning season, the first time ASU had posted four straight winning seasons in two decades. In just four seasons, Esposito led the Rams to three of the top five single season win totals in school history and three straight post-season berths. In 2003, ASU posted its fifth consecutive winning season, a mark only matched one other time in the history of the program. He left the program as one of the winningest coaches in Lone Star Conference history, and graduated 100% of all his four year players.\nThe Villages Charter School.\nAt The Villages Charter High School Esposito helped advance the school to the Class 3A District 7 Final Four for the first time in school history. He built the foundation and buzz in the community which has propelled the program to one of the top high school basketball program in the state, still today.\nUniversity of Minnesota.\nEsposito was hired by Tubby Smith University of Minnesota on March 29, 2007.\nEsposito joined Coach Smith at Minnesota on the heels of several disappointing seasons for the Gophers, who had made the NCAA Tournament only once since Monson's hiring in 1999.\nIn the first season, the team improved from 8–22 in 2006–07 to 20–14 in 2007–08, and reached the Big Ten Tournament semifinals after defeating second-seeded Indiana. In the 2008–09 season, Minnesota had a record of 22–11 and a bid to the NCAA tournament, where the team was eliminated in the opening round. In the 2009–10 season, Smith's team struggled throughout the year, However in the Big Ten Tournament, the team won three games in three days to advance to Minnesota's first ever appearance in the Big Ten championship game. Though it lost that game, the team's run vaulted it into the NCAA tournament for the second consecutive year.\nThe 2010–11 the Gophers struggled to maintain the program's momentum, however, finishing 17–14. The 2011–12 Gophers were 19–14 overall. After earning a bid to play in the NIT, the Gophers won four consecutive games before losing in the NIT championship game to Stanford. They concluded the season with a 23–15 overall record, which tied for the most wins in a season in school history.\n2013 the Golden Gopher finished the season in the third round of the NCAA Tournament losing to The University of Florida. \nTexas Tech University.\nOn April 6, 2013, Texas Tech Tubby Smith announced the hiring of Joe Esposito as an Assistant Basketball Coach. Texas Tech had failed to make the NCAA tournament in the 7 years prior to Smith's hire at the school.\nThe first season (2013–2014) proved to be a challenge. The Red Raiders led by Jaye Crockett started the season 8–5 in non conference only to fade during Big 12 play finishing with a 6–12 conference mark. Although the team faded down the stretch, it showed that it could compete with the upper teams in the Big 12 as the Red Raiders won two games against ranked competition and lost many close games. The team finished with a 14–18 record overall and 9th in the 10 team Big 12. This season marked Smith's first losing season as a head coach in his career and proved that the rebuilding job in Lubbock was massive.\nThe second season started with an incredible recruiting class as they attempted to improve the Red Raiders talent level. They added Keenan Evans, Justin Gray, Norense Odiase, and Zach Smith in the offseason in the hopes of improving a depleted Red Raider team. The Red Raiders had their first victory over a top 25 team since the 2009 season with a January 15, 2014 upset over the #9 Iowa State Cyclones. Although the season started with plenty of promise, the Red Raiders finished a mediocre season with a first round Big 12 tournament exit against the Texas Longhorns.\nThe 2015–16 season proved to be the best, at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders started the season with a 12–7 record and a 2–6 record in the Big 12. The Red Raiders eventually led a turnaround and won 3 straight games against ranked opponents for the first time in school history. The season featured young stars Evans, Gray, Odiase, and Smith as well as senior leaders Devaugntah Williams and Toddrick Gotcher. The Red Raiders would close out the 2015–16 regular season by winning 6 of their last 8 games and finishing with an overall 19–12 record with a 9–9 record in Big 12 play. The turnaround was the biggest in the Big 12 with the Red Raiders completing a six-game improvement from the year prior in arguably the toughest conference in the country. On March 13, 2016, the Red Raiders were selected to participate in the 2016 NCAA tournament. Tubby Smith was named the Big 12 Coach of the Year for orchestrating the turnaround. On March 8, Smith was named as the \"Sporting News\" Coach of the Year for his rebuilding effort.\nThe University of Memphis.\nOn April 14, 2016, Smith accepted the head coaching position at Memphis, replacing former Memphis coach Josh Pastner who took the job at Georgia Tech. In April 2017 six of the top eight scorers transferred out of the program. Smith compiled a 22–13 record in his second year at Memphis, improving upon a 19–13 record in his first year. He was fired from the position on March 14, 2018.\nSmith replaced Josh Pastner who took the job at Georgia Tech. In April 2017, six of the top eight scorers transferred out of the program. A huge rebuild and Memphis signed the top recruiting classes in the Conference in the two seasons they were there. Memphis compiled a 22–13 record in his second year, improving upon a 19–13 record in his first year.\nUNLV.\nIn 2018 UNLV Head Basketball Coach Marvin Menzies hired Esposito as the special assistant to the head coach. The Rebels won 18 games, finished 4th in the Mountain West Conference and Menzies was let go. Menzies went from 11th place to 4th in the Conference. After the news of the firing there was a mass exit of the players leaving for Power 5 schools: Texas Tech, 2 players to Oregon, Baylor, USC and Temple.\nCesar Chavez High School.\nEsposito was hired at Cesar Chavez High School in 2020 to rebuild their program after losing the top high school basketball player in the state as well as 7 other players. In year one the Champions went 13-1 with the best record of all levels in Phoenix Union. Year two Chavez once again had the best record of all teams, all levels in Phoenix Union and only lost on game in the region.

        "title": "English rugby union system",
        "text": "Men's Rugby union in England consists of 106 leagues, which includes professional leagues at the highest level, down to amateur regional leagues. Promotion and relegation are in place throughout the system.\nWomen's Rugby union in England consists of 26 leagues, which includes a national semi-professional league at the highest level, down to amateur regional leagues. Promotion and relegation are in place throughout the system, with the exception of the Women's Premiership.\nHistory.\nHistorically, there were no leagues allowed as these were seen as a sign of professionalism. In the 1970s the RFU allowed the creation of regional merit leagues with the most significant ones being the North, Midlands, South West and London merit leagues. In 1984 the RFU approved the creation of two national merit tables where clubs had to play a minimum of eight games against the clubs in their division. 1985 saw the creation of a third national merit league. In 1987 this was formed into a true national league system.\nPrevious restructures.\nThe format and competitiveness of the leagues has changed greatly since the leagues were first formed and a widespread and global restructuring of the leagues was announced in November 2008, for implementation from the 2009–10 season. Under this new structure, the top league remained the 12-team Gallagher Premiership. The second tier league was rebranded and restructured as the RFU Championship which replaced the old National Division One. This league also had 12 teams, and like the Premiership, is professional. Beneath the two professional leagues, the National Leagues were restructured to include a new 16 team National League 1, 16 team National League 2 South and 16 team National League 2 North. The four top regional leagues became part of National League 3 at level five.\nFor the 2017-18 season, the National League 3 leagues were renamed to have Premier as part of their title in order to make a distinction between regional rugby union and the National Leagues above. Other changes that season saw London 3 North East be replaced by two new leagues - London 3 Eastern Counties and London 3 Essex - with teams transferred depending on location.\nRecent restructures.\nCommunity game.\nIn 2020, it was announced that a new league structure would be implemented in the community game from 2022–23. The new structure which was partly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will be reviewed every three years and saw the following changes:\nBelow level 6 leagues sizes will depend on number of teams and geographical location.\nProfessional game.\nIn February 2021, the RFU approved a moratorium on relegation from both the Premiership and Championship in response to uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also confirmed that league structure and minimum standards criteria for promotion were being reviewed. The moratorium only covered relegation and did not include promotion from the Championship meaning the Premiership expanded to 13 teams with the Championship reduced to 11 in 2021–22 with the promotion of Saracens.\nIn June 2021, as part of the wider review the moratorium was extended by a further two years in the Premiership and also included relegation from the Championship in 2021–22 and promotion from the Championship following the 2022–23 season. This means the Premiership may be further expanded to 14 teams in 2022–23 and the Championship may be reduced to 10. A summary of changes is outlines below:\nPromotion remains subject to minimum standards which have been reviewed and include several factors.\nLevel 1: Premiership Rugby.\nPremiership Rugby is the top level league in England, containing the best 10 professional clubs. The premiership still includes strict ground criteria and a salary cap that must be met by all participants. Promotion from the Championship remains (subject to eligibility), however the bottom side have not been relegated since the end of the 2019–20 season. The club seeking promotion must meet the minimum standards criteria. The champion is the top team in the RFU Championship after the league season. A play-off system was previously in place to decide which team were crowned champions. It was hoped this would bring to an end a select number of clubs bouncing between the leagues. (For example, each season between 2005–06 and 2008–09 saw the club relegated to National Division One earning promotion to the Premiership the following season, and also either the promotion or relegation of Leeds Carnegie). Debate still continues over the question of promotion and relegation, but with the strict criteria fears are reduced. From 2023–24 the last placed team from the Premiership will playoff against the Championship winner (subject to promotion eligibility) for a place in the following season's Premiership.\nLevel 2: RFU Championship.\nThe new RFU Championship was formed in 2009–10 to provide a second tier of professional competition. The former National Division One was decreased from 16 clubs to 12 to accommodate the new fixture structure. For the first three seasons this included:\nStarting with the 2012–13 season, the second group stage was discontinued. The top four teams at the end of the home-and-away season entered play-offs to determine the league champion, which earned promotion providing Premiership entry standards were met. The bottom team at the end of home-and-away season was relegated to, and replaced by the champions of, the third tier National League 1.\nFrom 2017–18 through to 2019–20 and from 2021–22 the championship play-off was eliminated. The league-season champions earned automatic promotion (again, assuming that they meet Premiership standards). Relegation criteria did not change. However, there was a moratorium placed on relegation in both 2020–21 and 2021–22. From 2023–24 the winner (subject to eligibility) will contest a playoff with the bottom placed team in the Premiership for a place in the next season's Premiership.\nLevels 3-4: National Leagues.\nThe new National League structure includes:\nLevel 3: National League 1.\nThe National League 1 was decreased from 16 to 14 teams. This resulted in a 26-game season on a home and away basis. The champions are promoted to the level 2 RFU Championship, and the bottom three sides are relegated to the level 4 National League 2 East, National League 2 West or National League 2 North depending on geographical location.\nLevel 4: National League 2 East, National League 2 West and National League 2 North.\nThe fourth tier is increased to three leagues of 14 teams each. The three league champions are promoted, with the bottom two in each league relegated to their respective regional division.\nRegional leagues.\nWith the restructuring, levels 5–11 became the new regional system. There are now 6 Regional 1 leagues, which are connected to the national leagues by promotion and relegation.\nThe system.\nThe table below shows the current structure of the system. For each division, its official name, sponsorship name (which differs from its historic name) and number of clubs is given. At levels 1–3, each division promotes to the national division(s) that lie directly above it and relegates to the national division(s) that lie directly below it. Below that level, clubs relegate to the nearest local league."

Cunningham appeared in 162 major league games, 123 as a pitcher, compiling a 16–25 win–loss record with a 3.13 earned run average (ERA). He also played for the Chattanooga Lookouts in 1915 and 1920 to 1927. \nEarly years.\nCunningham was born in Sturgeon Lake, Minnesota, in 1894.\nProfessional baseball.\nCunningham began his career in professional baseball in 1914 with Duluth White Sox of the Northern League. He appeared in 45 games for Duluth and compiled a 23–10 record.\nIn 1915, Cunningham attended spring training with the Detroit Tigers, but was farmed out on April 2, 1915, to the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association. He appeared in 46 games for the Lookouts and compiled a 24–12 record. Despite playing for a team with a losing record, Cunningham led the Southern Association with a .667 winning percentage.\nOn August 15, 1915, the Lookouts sold Cunningham back to the Detroit Tigers with the caveat that he need not report to Detroit until the Lookouts' season had ended. On March 29, 1916, Cunningham pitched a shutout in a spring training game with E. A. Batchelor writing that the spitball was his \"most deadly weapon\". Cunningham remained with the Tigers for a total of four years from 1916 to 1919, pitched in 123 games for the Tigers, including 36 as a starter, and compiled a record of 16–25 with a 3.13 earned run average (ERA) in 477 innings pitched. During the 1917 season, he ranked among the American League leaders with 44 pitching appearances (tenth) and 24 games finished (second).\nCunningham was also a strong hitter for a pitcher. He had a career on-base percentage of .337 (.438 in 1919), 36 walks, 10 extra base hits and 13 RBIs.

It is the main building within which the players usually change in dressing rooms and which is the main location for watching the cricket match for members and others. Pavilions can vary from modest and purely practical buildings at small venues to large and imposing edifices at some of the historic grounds where Test cricket is played.\nHistoric pavilions.\nThe pavilions at Lord's Cricket Ground and The Oval are typical of the Victorian architectural style often seen at most famous English grounds. The cricket pavilion in the University Parks at Oxford was designed by the leading Victorian architect Sir Thomas Graham Jackson. Other famous historical pavilions are Old Trafford and the Members Pavilion at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Entry is only enabled for members. Their seats are reserved by a member or player. A non-member is not entitled to enter the Members Pavilion.\nModern pavilions.\nAmongst the most distinctive of modern pavilions is that named after Sir Garfield Sobers at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. Other modern pavilions are those at the Rose Bowl in England and the Brabourne Stadium in India.\nAlternatives.\nDugouts or benches are generally used instead of pavilions in Twenty20 cricket. The dugout or bench is located just off the field of play, allowing players to enter and exit the field of play more quickly in comparison to a pavilion, therefore maintaining the faster pace of that form of the game (a batsman must be on the field within 90 seconds, rather than within the three minutes allowed in other forms of cricket, for not be given out, timed out) ."

        "text": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey team is the college ice hockey team of the University of Notre Dame, competing at the NCAA Division I level as an associate member of the Big Ten Conference. The Irish play their home games at Compton Family Ice Arena. The head coach of the Fighting Irish is Jeff Jackson, and his assistant coaches are Paul Pooley, Andy Slaggert, and Max Mobley.\nConference history.\nPrior to the 2013–14 season, the team competed in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, and also won its last ever conference championship. In the 2013–2014 season, the team began to play in the Hockey East conference, where it played until the conclusion of the 2016-2017 season. Beginning in the 2017–2018 season, the team joined the Big Ten Conference.\nHistory.\nIce hockey has existed on and off as both a club and varsity sport at Notre Dame since 1912. The modern era of Notre Dame hockey began in 1968, when the Fighting Irish began to play as a Division I independent. In 1971, the team joined its first conference, the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). The team continued playing in the WCHA for a decade until moving to the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) with the conference's three Michigan schools in 1981.\nThe Fighting Irish lasted only two years in the new CCHA, when ice hockey was downgraded to a club sport for the 1983–1984 season. During that season, the Fighting Irish played in the Central States Collegiate Hockey League (CSCHL). Notre Dame finished that season second in the CSCHL with a record of 13–2–0. In 1984–1985 Notre Dame Hockey was once again elevated to varsity status with the team playing as a Division I independent. In 1992 Notre Dame rejoined the CCHA. The Irish struggled to remain competitive in the CCHA, but began to improve under head coach Dave Poulin. In 2004, Poulin led the team to its first ever NCAA Tournament. However, the following season was dramatically different. They only won five games, the worst season in school history. Poulin resigned after the season.\nJeff Jackson era.\nIn 2005, Jeff Jackson took over as head coach. Jackson, who had already won two national championships at Lake Superior State University, had an immediate impact at Notre Dame. In his first season with the Irish, the team greatly improved upon the five-win season, boosting its record to 13–19–5. 2007 was even more successful. The Irish achieved their first ever number one ranking in both the Uscho.com and USA Today Polls and their first number one seeding for the NCAA Tournament. The following year, the Irish finished fourth in both the CCHA's regular season and playoffs, and again made the NCAA Tournament. Once there, the Irish went on to beat top-seeded New Hampshire 7–3 and third-seeded Michigan State 3–1 to advance to the Frozen Four for the first time in school history. From there, they defeated first-seeded Michigan in overtime to advance to the national title game, ultimately losing to Boston College 4–1. Notre Dame also became the first four-seed to advance to the national semi-finals, and eventually to the national title game since the new 16-team format was introduced in 2003. In the 2008–2009 season, the Irish added another CCHA regular season title and a CCHA Tournament title, defeating Michigan 5–2 in the title game. Notre Dame advanced to the 2009 NCAA Tournament where the Irish was upset by 16th seeded Bemidji State 1–5.\nThe following season, Notre Dame finished with a record of 13–17–8 and ended the season after being swept by Ohio State two games to none in the three game opening round series of the CCHA Playoffs. The Irish rebounded in the 2010–11 regular season at 23–13–5, and clinched their second trip to the Frozen Four in program history by defeating New Hampshire 2–1 in the Northeast Regional Final. The Fighting Irish faced the East Regional Champion Minnesota-Duluth in the national semi-finals. The Irish fell to the eventual national champion 3–4.\nIn October 2011, Notre Dame announced the team will join Hockey East starting in the 2013–14 season, in response to the conference realignment. The university also announced an expanded television broadcast deal with NBC. The Fighting Irish Hockey began the 2011–12 season in the Edmund P. Joyce Center and played the last hockey game at the Joyce Center on October 15, 2011 against Ohio State. The team opened the university's new 5,000-seat Compton Family Ice Arena on October 21, 2011 against Rensselaer. Following the move into the new arena the Irish improved to a 7–3 home record in the new facility that included wins over future Hockey East rivals, Boston University, ranked 3th in the NCAA, Boston College, ranked 4th, and 8th ranked Western Michigan. On January 4, 2012, former coach and long-time Notre Dame Athletic Department employee, Charles \"Lefty\" Smith died. Smith coached the team from 1968 to 1987 as the first varsity ice hockey after helping the program transition from club to varsity status. Following his coaching career, he continued at Notre Dame in the athletic department until retiring just three days before his death. The Fighting Irish finished the regular season with an overall record of 17–16–3 and a conference record of 12–13–3. The team defeated Ohio State in the opening round of the 2012 CCHA Tournament, sweeping the Buckeyes in two games by scores of 2–0 and 4–2. In the second round of the CCHA Tournament, the team was defeated by the Michigan Wolverines in two games in a series that saw the first game go into a double overtime. The team was defeated in the first round of the NCAA regional playoffs in 2013 and 2014, both times by the St. Cloud State Huskies.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nPostseason.\nNCAA Tournament Results.\nThe Fighting Irish have appeared in the NCAA Tournament 13 times.\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nSpencer Penrose Award\nTim Taylor Award\nMike Richter Award\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nWCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nMost Valuable Player\nFreshman of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-WCHA\nSecond Team All-WCHA\nCCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nBest Defensive Defenseman\nBest Goaltender\nCoach of the Year\nScholar-Athlete of the Year\nTerry Flanagan Memorial Award\nIlitch Humanitarian Award\nTournament Most Valuable Player\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-CCHA\nSecond Team All-CCHA\nCCHA All-Rookie Team\nHockey East.\nIndividual awards.\nBest Defensive Forward\nBest Defensive Defenseman\nThree-Stars Award\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-Hockey East\nSecond Team All-Hockey East\nThird Team All-Hockey East\nHockey East All-Rookie Team\nBig Ten.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nGoaltender of the Year\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-Big Ten\nSecond Team All-Big Ten\nBig Ten All-Freshman Team\nFighting Irish in the NHL.\nWHA.\nSeveral players also were members of WHA teams.\nSource:\nCompton Family Ice Arena.\nIn February 2009, The University of Notre Dame announced it will begin construction on a new, freestanding, on-campus ice arena designed to meet the needs of both the Irish hockey team and the local community. Construction on the 5,022-seat arena began on March 15, 2010 with the venue opening in the Fall of 2011. The arena held its first Notre Dame hockey game on October 21, 2011 when a sellout crowd saw Notre Dame defeat Rensselaer 5–2.\nThe new ice arena is located south of the Joyce Center, just north of Edison Road, and just west of where the new Irish track and field facility is being constructed. The majority of the general public arena seating is of the chair-back variety with bleacher seating in the student section. The Compton Family Center replaced the rink inside the Edmund P. Joyce Center. During the time that the Irish played at the Joyce Center, the facility was the second smallest home rink in the CCHA with a hockey capacity of 2,857. All seats were benchers, and most of the seating consists of temporary bleachers. In 2007, the Irish compiled an impressive 14–2–2 home record at the Joyce Center."

        "title": "1992 Major League Baseball expansion draft",
        "text": "On November 17, 1992, during the 1992–93 offseason, Major League Baseball (MLB) held an expansion draft in New York City to allow two expansion teams, the Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies, to build their rosters prior to debuting in the National League's (NL) East and West divisions, respectively, in the 1993 MLB season.\nThe 1990 collective bargaining agreement between MLB owners and the MLB Players Association allowed the NL to expand by two members to match the American League (AL). In June 1991, MLB accepted bids of groups from Miami, Florida, and Denver, Colorado, with debuts set for 1993.\nThe Marlins and Rockies used the expansion draft to build their teams using different strategies. As the Rockies had a smaller operating budget than the Marlins, the Rockies targeted prospects with low salaries, while the Marlins selected older players intended to provide more immediate impact. All three rounds of the draft were televised by ESPN.\nBackground.\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) team owners and the MLB Players Association agreed to expand the National League (NL) by two teams in the 1990 collective bargaining agreement. Prior to expansion, the NL had 12 teams while the American League had 14.\nIn June 1991, MLB accepted two bids for expansion franchises: one for Miami, Florida, and the other for Denver, Colorado. Both teams were set to debut in 1993. Expansion was approved unanimously by all teams in July 1991. The Denver group chose to call their franchise the Colorado Rockies, the same name used as the National Hockey League franchise that played in Denver from 1976 to 1982. The Miami group chose to call themselves the Florida Marlins to broaden their fanbase to the entire state, while reviving the nickname of the Miami Marlins, a defunct Minor League Baseball team. An expansion draft to stock both franchises was set for November 1992.\nProcedure.\nIn contrast to previous expansion drafts, players from both the American League (AL) and National League (NL) were available to the expansion clubs. Each existing club could protect 15 players on their 40-man roster from being drafted and only one player could be drafted from each team in each round. At the end of each round, NL teams could protect an additional three players and AL teams could protect an additional four. To further protect the AL teams, a maximum of eight AL teams could have three players chosen.\nAll unprotected MLB and minor league players were eligible except those chosen in the amateur drafts of 1991 or 1992 and players who were 18 or younger when signed in 1990. Players who were free agents after the 1992 season were not eligible for selection in the draft. The Rockies and Marlins, however, were not restricted in offering contracts to free agents. The Rockies signed their first free agent, Andrés Galarraga, to a one-year contract the day before the expansion draft.\nThe draft order was determined by a coin toss, the winner of which could choose either: (a) the first overall pick in the expansion draft and the 28th, and last, pick in the first round of the 1993 MLB amateur draft; or (b) allow the other team to pick first and receive both the second and third overall expansion draft picks, the right to pick first in the subsequent rounds of the expansion draft, and the 27th, and next-to-last, overall pick in the 1993 MLB amateur draft. Colorado won the toss and chose to pick first overall. The three rounds of the draft were televised by ESPN.\nResults.\nWith the first pick, the Rockies chose David Nied, who had a 3–0 win–loss record with a 1.17 earned run average in six MLB appearances with the Atlanta Braves. The Marlins' first selection, Nigel Wilson, spent the 1992 season with the Double-A Knoxville Smokies of the Toronto Blue Jays organization, and had no MLB experience.\nIn total, the Rockies and Marlins chose 41 pitchers with their combined 72 selections. Of the 72 players chosen, 11 were All-Stars during their careers. Jack Armstrong, Bryan Harvey, and Danny Jackson had been All-Stars before the expansion draft, while Andy Ashby, Brad Ausmus, Vinny Castilla, Jeff Conine, Carl Everett, Joe Girardi, Harvey, Trevor Hoffman, Jackson, and Eric Young became All-Stars later on in their careers. Hoffman would also be elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018.\nDraft-day trades.\nThe following trades were announced at the conclusion of the expansion draft:\nAftermath.\nSeveral older star players who were left unprotected, including Danny Tartabull, Jack Morris, and Shawon Dunston, were not selected due to their high salaries and advanced age. Based on the results of the expansion draft, the Marlins were projected to have a higher payroll in 1993 than the Rockies. The Rockies' payroll appeared to be $4 million, less than what the Marlins would pay Bryan Harvey.\nThe New York Yankees challenged the validity of the draft on the basis that the Marlins did not compensate the Yankees for the loss of territory in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the Yankees had a minor league team. They attempted to revoke the assignment of Hayes and Ausmus to the Rockies and Everett to the Marlins. Invoking the \"best interests of baseball\" clause, Commissioner Bud Selig and the major league executive council affirmed the draft results.\nIn the 1993 Major League Baseball season, the Marlins and Rockies both finished sixth out of seven teams in their respective divisions. The Rockies were the first team to reach the playoffs, using the roster they developed through the expansion draft to win the wild card in 1995, a record for the shortest amount of time for an expansion team to make the playoffs in any sport at the time. (The Arizona Diamondbacks would go on to break the record by reaching the playoffs in 1999, their second year of existence.) Ritz and Painter, both selected in the expansion draft, started Games 1 and 2 of the 1995 National League Division Series for the Rockies. The Rockies added free agent acquisition Larry Walker to a lineup of power hitters in Galarraga, Bichette, and Castilla, known collectively as the \"Blake Street Bombers\".\nMeanwhile, the Marlins kept fewer players they selected in the expansion draft than the Rockies. In 1996, the Rockies retained 13 players from the draft, while the Marlins had six. Jeff Conine, nicknamed \"Mr. Marlin\", was the only player selected in the expansion draft on the Marlins' 1997 World Series championship roster. However, the Marlins used the players selected in the expansion draft to craft their 1997 roster. The Marlins traded three players selected in the draft, Hoffman, Martínez and Berumen, to the San Diego Padres for Gary Sheffield, a key member of the 1997 Florida Marlins. However, other key players to the Marlins' World Series championship were signed as free agents. The 1997 Marlins set records by reaching and winning the World Series in the team's fifth year (these records were broken by the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, who won the World Series in their fourth year of existence) and were the first wild card team to win the World Series."

Her playing career was cut short by a knee injury.\nCoaching career.\nWade started her coaching career at Marietta High School in Marietta, Mississippi in 1933. Her first year, the team had a record of 12–2. She then moved on to coach at Belden High school, where her team had a record of 11–3. After that, she coached Cleveland High School's girls basketball team from 1935 to 1954 with a 453-89-6 record. Her teams won the Bolivar County Championships and entered the North Mississippi tournament fourteen out of her last fifteen years, and came in second in the state championships three consecutive years. Wade also coached the girls' track team to consecutive state championships in 1958 and 1959.\nWhen Delta State restarted the women's basketball team in 1973, Wade became the coach for them. They won three consecutive national championships at the AIAW women's basketball tournament in 1975, 1976 and 1977. Those seasons included a 51-game winning streak. She also coached a future Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Lusia Harris-Stewart.\nCleveland High School's Margaret Wade Gymnasium, on the campus of Margaret Green Junior High School, was named in her honor in 1977. The top women's collegiate player is now awarded the Wade Trophy named after her. She was inducted into the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame in 1992. She was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1985 and in the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999.\nA Mississippi Historical Marker honoring Margaret Wade was unveiled on the front lawn of Cleveland High School on October 11, 2008."

        "title": "Rugby–Leamington line",
        "text": "The Rugby to Leamington Line was a railway line running from Rugby to Leamington Spa. It was a branch line built by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and opened in 1851. The branch connected Leamington with the mainline from London to Birmingham (now the West Coast Main Line) which had been opened in 1838 by the LNWR's predecessor, the London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR).\nHistory.\nThe original proposal for the line were promoted by the \"Rugby and Leamington Railway Company\". The Act for the railway received Royal Assent on 13 August 1846. The line was to be built and operated by the London and Birmingham Railway, which became part of the LNWR the following year.\nAt Rugby, the branch diverged from the main line at a junction west of Rugby railway station and ran south-west for 15 miles and eight chains to Leamington, where it was joined end-on to the LNWR's existing branch line from Coventry to Leamington, which had been extended into Leamington town centre from its original terminus at Milverton station, which had been on the edge of the town.\nThe line from Rugby to Leamington opened throughout on 1 March 1851. The first intermediate station at Marton was opened on 1 January 1852, station opened on 1 February 1853. In February 1854, Leamington Spa Avenue station opened which was closer to the town centre than the original Milverton station, and was alongside the rival Great Western Railway's (GWR) Leamington station. The station at was opened twenty years after the opening of the line on 2 October 1871. The line was originally built as single track, but as traffic grew the line was doubled in stages from Rugby between 1882 and 1884. The lines were designated Up to Rugby and Down to Leamington.\nLocal trains for Leamington used the down (north) end bay platforms at Rugby. At the other end of the line, services from Rugby ran through to Warwick (Milverton) and this practice continued until closure because the loco shed and servicing depot for the Rugby-Leamington-Coventry lines was at Milverton.\nIn 1895, a new junction was created when the LNWR's single track line from Weedon to Daventry was extended westward to join the Rugby to Leamington line at Marton Junction, which was two miles southwest of Marton station in a deep cutting through a ridge of high ground.\nAt Leamington, the LNWR used a single track connection facing Rugby to exchange goods trains with the adjacent Great Western Railway. This connection was doubled in 1908 in order to cope with the increased traffic.\nThe local passenger service was withdrawn by British Railways in June 1959, and the local goods sidings were closed in the early 1960s, however the line continued to see use as a diversionary route by both passenger and freight trains until 1965, during the electrification of the West Coast Main Line. When this finished the line was closed as a through route on 4 April 1966, and the line closed between Marton Junction and Leamington, with the remainder of the track singled. The only remaining traffic was goods trains serving the Rugby Cement works at both Rugby and Southam, the latter of which was located on a stub of the former line to Weedon and so required trains to reverse at Marton Junction. Trains to the cement works at Southam continued until June 1985, with the track being lifted two years later. Infrequent trains served the cement works at Rugby until July 1991. The track at this end remained, and remains in place however.\nRoute.\nFrom Rugby, the general course of the line was southwest as far as Hunningham after which it swung west for the last five miles into Leamington. Most of the route was straight and lightly graded. For the first few miles out of Rugby the line was mainly routed in shallow cuttings but west of Birdingbury it crossed the River Leam on a low viaduct. From there it ran across the flat open expanse of Marton Moor before cutting through high ground to follow the valley of the River Leam for the last few miles.\nThe route had three civil engineering features of note: the deep cutting at Marton Junction; the lofty wrought-iron bridge spanning the cutting; and the viaduct over the canal near Radford Semele.\nThe cutting, approximately deep, took the line through a north–south ridge of high ground south of Hunningham. An ancient track, Ridgeway Lane, ran along the top of the ridge and met the cutting at its deepest point so the LNWR built a single-span wrought-iron trussed lattice girder bridge to carry the lane over the railway. At the time it was built (1851) this was the longest such bridge ever constructed. In later years, four lattice columns and cross-ties were added to reinforce the original structure. Known locally as 'the high bridge', this impressive example of Victorian civil engineering is still standing.\nTwo miles further west, the handsome five-arch brick-built Offchurch Viaduct carried the route over the Grand Union Canal and adjacent low ground: the arch above the canal itself was built with skewed courses. The viaduct still stands although the trackbed across it is fenced off.\nRemains.\nAt the Rugby end of the line the first half-mile of track is still in use as a siding. The rest of the line has been dismantled, and no track remains.\nMuch of the dismantled trackbed is intact but only a few sections are public rights of way. The trackbed from Draycote (southwest of the former Dunchurch station) to Birdingbury has been surfaced by Sustrans as part of National Cycle Network Route 41. The long straight stretch of trackbed from the A423 across Marton Moor to the cutting near Hunningham is mostly clear of undergrowth and is regularly used by walkers; however, there is no legal right of way and this section can be very muddy in winter.\nThe station houses at Dunchurch and Birdingbury are now private residences (even the platforms are still in place at Birdingbury) but there is little trace of Marton station itself and a small industrial estate occupies the site.\nFurther west, a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) stretch of trackbed from the Fosse Way to the Grand Union Canal, titled 'Offchurch Greenway' and also part of Route 41, is well surfaced and maintained, this is planned to be extended up to Birdingbury with construction originally scheduled to begin in summer 2021. West of the canal, the trackbed is on private land as far as the A425 road and beyond that most of the old railway has been built over.\nWithin Royal Leamington Spa itself, the route parallels the Chiltern Main Line for approximately east of Leamington Spa railway station on a series of brick viaducts that remain in situ. However some metal bridges over roads have been removed. There is no access to the viaducts, however the archways underneath are used by small businesses."

        "text": "Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon (29 February 1572 – 16 November 1638) was an English military commander and a politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1601 and 1624.\nLife.\nCecil was the third son of Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter, and his wife, Dorothy Neville, daughter of John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer, by his wife, Lucy Somerset, daughter of Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester. He was a grandson of Queen Elizabeth's great minister William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley.\nCecil served with the English forces in the Netherlands between 1596 and 1610, becoming a captain of foot in 1599. In May 1600 he was appointed to a troop of cavalry, which he commanded at the battle of Nieuport, under Sir Francis Vere. In 1601 he commanded a body of one thousand men raised in London for the relief of Ostend, then besieged by the Spanish, and on his return in September was knighted by Queen Elizabeth. He was elected Member of Parliament for Aldborough in 1601. In the spring of 1602, he was colonel of a regiment of English horse under Prince Maurice, and served in the expedition into Brabant and at the Siege of Grave. He commanded the English cavalry during the conquest of Sluis in 1604 during which he played a part in defeating the relief attempt by Ambrogio Spinola. He continued actively serving during the years immediately following, and made his reputation as a soldier. In 1610 he commanded the British and Irish contingent of four thousand men serving under Prince Christian of Anhalt in the War of the Jülich succession, at the siege of Juliers in July and August. This was the first ever army flagged as British under the Union Flag.\nAt court, his credit also stood high. In March 1612 he was sent, as the prince's proxy, to stand sponsor at the baptism of Henry Casimir, son of Count Ernest of Nassau, and Sophia Hedwig, niece of Anne of Denmark, at Arnhem. Cecil gave gifts of a cupboard of gilt plate, a diamond necklace with a locket, horses, and an embroidered petticoat for Sophia Hedwig. In April 1613 he had a commission to receive and pay all money for the journey of Lady Elizabeth and her husband, and in November he was ordered to request his lady to attend the electress at Heidelberg. In January 1618 he sued in vain for the comptrollership, and in February for the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster. In 1620 he was nominated by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham to command the English troops in Germany, but was superseded by Sir Horace Vere on the demand of Count Dohna, the agent of the king of Bohemia in England. A quarrel ensued between Cecil and Dohna, in the course of which Cecil assured his opponent that it was only his character as an ambassador which protected him from a demand for personal satisfaction. He was elected MP for Chichester in 1621. He supported Sir James Perrot's call on the House of Commons of England to commit to military support for the Palatinate in the early stages of the Thirty Years' War saying \"This declaration comes from heaven. It will do more for us than if we had ten thousand soldiers on the march.\" In 1624 he was elected MP for Dover.\nCecil was given command of Buckingham's military expedition to Spain in October 1625, but so mismanaged the attack on Cadiz that he entirely missed the treasure ships which were the main objective of the attack. Nevertheless, in the following month, November 1625, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cecil of Putney and Viscount Wimbledon, on the basis of his seat, Wimbledon House in Surrey. He returned to command the English forces in the Netherlands from 1627 (the Siege of Groenlo) until 1629 (the Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch). He served as Lord Lieutenant of Surrey from 1627 to 1638 and was Governor of Portsmouth from 1630 to 1638. He remained highly placed in the military establishment.\nFamily.\nCecil married three times. He married firstly in 1601 to Theodosia Noel (born 1585), daughter of Sir Andrew Noel of Dalby and Mabel Harington. They had five daughters; (1) Dorothy (1603–1652), who died unmarried, (2) Albinia (died 1660), who married Sir Christopher Wray of Ashby, (3) Elizabeth, who married Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham, (4) Frances (died 1684), who married first James Fiennes, 2nd Viscount Saye and Sele and second the Reverend Joshua Sprigge and (5) Utriche, baptised 20 March 1616 in Utrecht, probably named after Utrecht and probably died early.\nFollowing the death of his first wife, in February 1618 he married Diana Drury (d. 1631), daughter of Sir William Drury of Hawstead, Suffolk, and Elizabeth Stafford. Their only child, Anne, died in infancy. Cecil married thirdly, in 1635, Sophia Zouche (c. 1618–1691), daughter of Sir Edward Zouch of Woking and Dorothea Silking, by whom he had a son, Algernon, but this child also died aged less than a year old.\nWimbledon died in 1638 and is buried in the Cecil Chapel at St Mary's Church, Wimbledon. Both his titles became extinct on his death. Sophia remarried the Irish statesman Sir Robert King, with whom she had a daughter."

        "title": "Bob Anderson (baseball)",
        "text": "Robert Carl Anderson (September 29, 1935 – March 12, 2015) was an American professional baseball player and right-handed pitcher who appeared in 246 games in Major League Baseball (MLB) between and for the Chicago Cubs and Detroit Tigers. Born in East Chicago, Indiana, he graduated from Hammond High School and attended both Michigan State University and Western Michigan University. He stood tall and weighed during his active career.\nCareer overview.\nAnderson signed with Chicago in 1954 and reached the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League in 1956 as a member of the Cubs' top farm team, the Los Angeles Angels. He had a stellar season as a relief pitcher, working in 70 games and winning a dozen, for the PCL champion Angels. The following year, he was recalled by the Cubs in midyear and spent parts of 1957 and as a member of the Cubs' bullpen corps and spot starter. In , he made the Cubs' staff for good and became a full-time starting pitcher, posting a 21–24 record over the next two seasons in 66 assignments, with 12 complete games and his only MLB shutout, a 3–0 six-hit triumph against the pennant-contending Milwaukee Braves on August 24, 1959.\nIn 1961, he transitioned back to a bullpen role, and received only 19 more starting assignments over the rest of his MLB career. He was traded to Detroit after the season. Reunited with Bob Scheffing, his manager with the PCL Angels and the 1957–1959 Cubs, Anderson got into 32 games for the 1963 Tigers and posted the only winning season of his career, as he captured three of four decisions. He was dealt along with Rocky Colavito and $50,000 from the Tigers to the Kansas City Athletics for Jerry Lumpe, Dave Wickersham and Ed Rakow on November 18, . He did not make the 1964 Athletics' roster and spent the year back in minor league baseball before leaving the game.\nDuring his MLB career, he won 36 games, lost 46, and compiled an earned run average of 4.26. He was credited with 15 complete games. In 840 innings pitched, he allowed 858 hits and 319 bases on balls with 502 strikeouts.\nInvolved in unusual 1959 play.\nAnderson was involved in one of Major League Baseball's most unusual and weirdest plays of all time in its long history, which occurred during a game played on June 30, 1959, at Wrigley Field between the Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals.\nAnderson was pitching and Stan Musial was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. The home plate umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, however Anderson and Taylor contended Musial had foul tipped the ball and because the ball was still in play, and due to Delmore being embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was breaking for second, Cubs third baseman Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball, however that ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway.\nAbsentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor at which Anderson's throw flew high over Tony Taylor's head into centerfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticing Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head then tried to go to third base, however, on his way over there, was tagged by Banks, and after a delay was ruled out. Oddly, in the final accounting, this most unusual and different play made no difference in the result, a 4–1 victory for the visiting Cardinals."

        "title": "1992 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 1992 Giro d'Italia was the 75th edition of the race. It started off in Genoa on 24 May with an individual time trial. The race concluded in Milan with an individual time trial on 14 June. Twenty teams entered the race, which was won by the Spaniard Miguel Induráin of the team. Second and third respectively were the Italians Claudio Chiappucci and Franco Chioccioli. Indurain's victory in the 1992 Giro was his first step in completing the Giro – Tour double – winning the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France in one calendar year – becoming the sixth rider to accomplish this feat, with the first being Fausto Coppi in 1949.\nThierry Marie won the event's opening leg and in doing so, became the first rider to wear the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" (pink jersey) in this edition. He held the race lead for another stage, before he lost it to eventual winner Indurain upon the conclusion of the third stage who held it for the rest of the race's duration. Indurain built upon his advantage during the fourth and twenty-second stages, both individual time trials, and protected the lead by responding to most attacks from his rivals during the mountainous stages.\nIndurain became the first Spanish rider to win the Giro d'Italia. Indurain also won the secondary intergiro classification. In the race's other classifications, rider Pavel Tonkov of Russia finished as the best rider aged 25 or under in the general classification, finishing in seventh place overall; Mario Cipollini of the team was the winner of the points classification, with GB-MG Maglificio finishing as the winners of the team classification, ranking each of the twenty teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time.\nTeams.\nTwenty teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1992 edition of the Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 180 cyclists. Italy (71), France (19), Spain (19), Germany (11), and Colombia (10) all had more than 10 riders. Of these, 70 were riding the Giro d'Italia for the first time. The average age of riders was 27.48 years, ranging from 22–year–old Andrea Ferrigato () to 36–year–old Sean Kelly (). The team with the youngest average rider age was (25), while the oldest was (29). From the riders that began the race, 148 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams that took part in the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton did include the previous year's winner Franco Chioccioli. According to author Bill McGann, Miguel Induráin came into the race with the aims of riding it for preparation for the Tour de France in July. Claudio Chiappucci came into the race as a contender after finishing on the podium at the previous season's Giro d'Italia and Tour de France. The Spanish newspaper \"El País\" believed Indurain to be the favorite heading into the first day of racing. However, the newspaper did state that his chances were lower since his teammate Jean-François Bernard was not participating in the race due to an injury. \"l'Unità\" writer Dario Ceccarelli and \"Avui\" writer Recuero believed that Chiappucci and Indurain were the favorites to win the overall crown. Spanish newspaper \"Diari de Girona\" named Indurain, Chiappucci, Laurent Fignon, and Massimiliano Lelli the main contenders to win the race.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1992 Giro d'Italia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 30 November 1991. It contained three time trial events, all of which were individual. There were eleven stages containing high mountains, of which four had summit finishes: stage 10, to Monte Terminillo; stage 14, to Monte Bondone; stage 18, to Monviso; and stage 19, to Pila. The organizers chose to include no rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was longer and lacked an opening time trial prologue. In addition, this race contained one less of half stages.\n\"El País\" felt that the route was best suited for an all-round cyclist, while stating that final individual time trial would be decisive in determining the winner of the race. \"Avui\" writer Recuero believed that the course was the toughest in years, while also stating that many experts found that the race route was well balanced between the time spent in the mountains and the distance allocated to time trials. The race's nineteenth stage, which began and ended in Saluzzo, was named the queen stage for the amount of difficult mountains contained in the stage.\nRace overview.\nThe Giro began with a short individual time trial that navigated through the streets of Genoa, which was won by Thierry Marie by a margin of three seconds. The next day of racing culminated with a bunch sprint that was won by Jolly Componibili-Club 88's Endrio Leoni after the leading two-man breakaway just kilometers before the finish. controlled the pace-making for most of the third stage before general classification contender Claudio Chiappucci attacked. Chiappucci attacked near the end of the stage, but was caught by his rivals. 's Maximilian Sciandri edged out Massimiliano Lelli for the stage win as the race lead shifted from Marie to Miguel Induráin. Indurain increased his advantage over the rest of the competing riders by winning the stage 4 individual time trial by thirty-two seconds.\nThe race's sixth stage was the first stage containing several climbs of great difficulty. As the stage progressed, the general classification contenders formed a group on the road. Chiappucci and Marco Giovannetti attacked a few times, with all of their attempts being marked by the other riders. The contenders all crossed the finish line together seconds after stage winner Franco Vona, with Frenchman Laurent Fignon being the only one to lose time. The following day, sprinter Guido Bontempi and Giuseppe Petito formed a breakaway group that survived to the stage's conclusion, with Bontempi taking the stage victory. Stages 8 and 9 both came down to field sprints won by Mario Cipollini and Bontempi, respectively.\nThe event's tenth stage featured a summit finish to Monte Terminillo. The general classification contenders were all in a group together as they reached the final climb of the day. Piotr Ugrumov was the first of the group to attack and was joined by Roberto Conti shortly after. Behind, Indurain led a chase group that contained Andrew Hampsten, Chiappucci, Giovannetti, and Luis Herrera, while general classification hopefuls Chioccioli and Fignon dropped off the back since they could not keep pace. The group caught Conti, who was alone after Ugrumov slowed, and from there, Herrera attacked to win the stage. The next day's route was an undulating one. Chioccioli, Roberto Pagnin, and Marco Lietti formed a breakaway group and gained an advantage of three and a half minutes over the main field which was led by Indurain's team, Banesto. The group remained in front, Pagnin took the stage victory, and Indurain finished over two minutes later. With around nine kilometers remaining in the twelfth stage, there was an accident that saw Chiappicci and Giovannetti amongst others go down. The peloton continued on, gearing up for a sprint finish that Leoni won.\nThe race entered the Dolomites in the thirteenth stage. Indurain was attacked several times on the final climb of the day by Chioccioli, Giovannetti, and Chiappucci; however, he was able to counter each attack and the group of main competitors finished together three after the stage winner, Vona. The next day was the most mountainous of the race, according to \"El País\" writer Paolo Viberti, as it contained the Passo Pordoi and twice climbed Monte Bondone, with the second being the end of the stage. Giorgio Furlan launched a solo attack that won him the stage as the general classification contenders attacked each other behind. Indurain marked each move that was made by his rivals, except for a last ditch effort by Chioccioli that allowed him to finish five seconds ahead of the rest of the general classification hopefuls. The next leg of the race saw a nine-man group form a breakaway after the stage started. The breakaway group was not caught and reached the finish line where Castorama's François Simon won sprint to the line. Marco Saligari won the sixteenth stage after participating in a breakaway that lasted around .\nThe eighteenth stage featured a summit finish to the Pian del Re. After several rival riders attacked Indurain, a group of general classification riders were leading on the road going into the final climb of the day. As the climb wore on, the group thinned and 's Giovannetti attacked on a false flat with about remaining in the stage to win the day. Giancarlo Perini and Udo Bölts caught the nineteenth stage's leading rider on the road, Ramon González. Bölts attacked with two kilometers left on the day and rode solo to stage victory. Meanwhile, race leader Indurain countered all the attacks made by his rivals and maintained his advantage.\nThe event's twentieth stage saw Chioccioli and Chiappucci attack Indurain several times. Chioccioli won the stage and was the first over most of the categorized climbs on the stage, but Indurain finished with the same time. The penultimate stage resulted in a field sprint that was won by Cipollini for his fourth victory of this edition. The final stage of the race was a individual time trial. Race leader Indurain won the stage by two minutes and forty-six seconds over the second-place finisher on the stage, thereby sealing his overall victory.\nFive riders achieved multiple stage victories: Cipollini (stages 5, 8, 17, and 21), Bontempi (stages 7 and 9), Leoni (stages 2 and 12), Vona (stages 6 and 13), and Indurain (stages 4 and 22). Stage wins were achieved by eleven of the twenty competing squads, six of which won multiple stages. GB-MG Maglificio collected a total of seven stage wins through three riders, Cipollini, Vona, and Chioccioli (stage 20). Carrera Jeans-Vagabond amassed a total of two stage victories through Bontempi. Jolly Componibili-Club 88 achieved the same feat through Leoni. Castorama earned two stage wins through Marie (stage 1) and Simon (stage 15). Ariostea gained two stage victories through Furlan (stage 14) and Saligari (stage 16). Banesto collected two stage success through Indurain. Motorola, Postobón-Manzana-Ryalcao, Lotus-Festina, Gatorade-Chateau d'Ax, and Team Telekom all won a single stage at the Giro, the first through Sciandri (stage 3), the second through Herrera (stage 10), the third with Pagnin (stage 11), the fourth with Giovannetti (stage 18), and the fifth through Bölts (stage 19).\nClassification leadership.\nFive different jerseys were worn during the 1992 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. \"The Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Passo Pordoi. The first rider to cross the Pordoi Pass was Italian Claudio Chiappucci. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1968 were eligible for it.\nThe intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nAftermath.\nMiguel Induráin entered the Tour de France in July as the favorite to win the race. He would go on to win the race after taking the lead upon the finish of the thirteenth stage. By winning the Tour, he became the sixth rider to complete the Giro – Tour double in history. Indurain would go on to repeat this feat again the following calendar year. In April 2018, Indurain was placed into the Giro d'Italia Hall of Fame for his performances during the Giro d'Italia in his career. He was the sixth rider to be inducted."

        "text": "William J. Robinson (June 3, 1911 – April 28, 2008) was an American college basketball coach and scout. Robinson became the first African-American head coach in NCAA Division I history when he accepted the position at Illinois State University in 1970. He scouted for the Detroit Pistons for 28 years, and worked 22 years for the Detroit Lions as a part-time scout. Robinson, who is a member of seven athletic halls of fame, was also the first black high school coach in Michigan, winning two state championships in basketball.\nEarly life.\nRobinson was born in Wadesboro, North Carolina, and attended Steubenville High School in Steubenville, Ohio, where he quarterbacked the football team and played on the golf team. Robinson led his football team to an undefeated, unscored upon season, and finished second in the state golf tournament despite not being allowed on the course with the white players. He was also the captain of both the golf and football teams and also played baseball and ran track, the only player in state history to letter in five sports. Robinson also lettered in four sports at West Virginia State University, graduating in 1937.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from West Virginia State Robinson was unable to find a job, and sought a master's degree. Because of racial segregation in West Virginia, Robinson was forced to attend graduate school at the University of Michigan, earning a master's in physical education. After finishing graduate school, Robinson still could not find a job, and returned to Steubenville, and later began coaching at a YMCA in nearby Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He also coached YMCA basketball in Chicago, winning several city championships.\nRobinson's YMCA success got him his first high school coaching job at DuSable High School in Chicago. In 1943, Robinson was selected to take the head coaching position at Miller High School in Detroit. He was chosen as the person to calm an uneasy racial situation due to race riots in the city the previous summer. Robinson was the only black coach in Detroit for the next sixteen years. Robinson left Miller High and later went to Pershing High School in Detroit, where he won the state title in 1967 with a team led by Spencer Haywood, Ralph Simpson, Glenn Doughty, Paul Seal, and Marvin Lane, and won a second state title in 1970. He also coached Mel Daniels, Big Daddy Lipscomb and Ted Sizemore at the high school level. During his high school coaching career Robinson enabled more than 300 students to attend college, and organized coaching clinics for black coaches in the south, recruiting staff members of the Detroit Lions and Detroit Tigers to provide instruction. As a result of his efforts at the coaching clinics, Lions coach Buddy Parker hired Robinson as the first black scout in the NFL. As a scout Robinson discovered Pro Football Hall of Famers Charlie Sanders and Lem Barney.\nIn 1970 Robinson was hired as the head coach at Illinois State University, making him the first black head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. He compiled a record of 78-51 from 1970 to 1975 (see Illinois State Redbirds Men's Basketball Season-By-Season Records). His best player during that time was Doug Collins, the school's only consensus All-American and the #1 pick in the 1973 NBA draft. In 2003 Robinson received a lifetime achievement award from the Missouri Valley Conference.\nThe Pistons era.\nWill Robinson retired from Illinois State in 1975, and accepted a position as a scout for the Detroit Pistons in 1976. Robinson was responsible for discovering Joe Dumars and Dennis Rodman, key members of the Pistons' championship teams in 1989 and 1990. Robinson was actually offered the Pistons' head coaching position by general manager Jack McCloskey, who gave the job to Chuck Daly instead when Robinson turned down the position. Robinson retired from the Pistons in 2003, and during the 2003-04 NBA season the Pistons named their locker room \"Will Robinson Locker Room of Champions.\" The Pistons won their third NBA title that season.\nRobinson died on April 28, 2008, at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit at the age of 96. For the remainder of the 2008 NBA Playoffs, the Pistons uniforms wore a black patch in his memory."

        "text": "The Opening Ceremony of the XV Pan American Games took place on 13 July 2007. Considered an audition for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, the Opening Ceremony was praised by the media for its creativity and Olympic-style production value. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported:\nBrazil's 2nd largest city still must overcome doubts about crime and traffic, among other things, if it hopes to make good on its quixotic bid to play host to the 2016 Olympic Games. But Rio sure has the opening ceremony down pat. On Friday the city inaugurated the 15th Pan American Games with a lavish and creative 3½ -hour show that featured a symphony orchestra, three 100-foot-long coral snakes, Miss Brazil, an alligator the size of a 747, fireworks, a 1,500-piece percussion band and thousands of dancers dressed as everything from ocean waves to water lilies.\nApproximately 90,000 spectators and 5,000 athletes packed Rio de Janeiro's Maracanã Stadium for the occasion. The ceremony included a cast of 4,000 and a $17 million (US) budget. The Executive Producer of the Opening Ceremony was Scott Givens. More than 250 people were part of the creative and production teams with another 1,000 backstage volunteers. Scott Givens' team was responsible for the Opening Ceremony, Sports Production, the presentation of 2,252 medals, Sports Production and the Closing Ceremony.\nThe theme of the show was based on the theme of the Rio 2007 Games: \"Viva Essa Energia\" (Share this Energy).\nProceedings.\nThe show began at 17:30 local time (UTC-3) and lasted for two and a half hours.\nThe beginning had the Dragoons of Independence, the first regiment of the Brazilian army and the official guard of the Republic's president, bringing a Brazilian flag and an execution of the Brazilian national anthem sung by Elza Soares, the former wife of football player Mané Garrincha. The countdown, starting with the number 15, showed the cities which hosted the American event.\nThe first part was named \"Viva essa energia\" (Live this energy in Portuguese). And started with an afro-Brazilian boy named Cainan playing a tambour and guiding 1,150 rhythmists from the 17 Samba schools and presenting the official song of the XV Pan American Games, \"Viva essa Energia\", composed by Arnaldo Antunes, former singer the Brazilian rock band Titãs, and Liminha, singer the Brazilian rock band Os Mutantes, and sung by Ana Costa samba singer.\nThe parade of the athletes had a rhythm of a samba, chorinho and the bossa nova's rhythm played by the battery of samba schools which made a huge corridor when the athletes from the 42 nations passed between them. There was expectation about the entry of Panama's delegation due to interference by the Panamanian government on their national Olympic committee, the IOC have banned the participation of the country in official events but the PASO required the Panamanian athletes to participate using their organization's flag, so the IOC came back to the decision and authorised the participation of Panama.\nAt this games were created the PASO's anthem, composed by André Mehmari and performed by Orquestra Sinfônica Brasileira conducted by Roberto Minczuk.\nThe show were divided in three parts: \"A energia do Sol\" (The energy of sun), \"A energia da água\" (the energy of water), and \"A energia do homem\" (The man's energy). The show was coordinated by Rosa Magalhães from the Rio de Janeiro samba school GRES Imperatriz Leopoldinense.\nThe oath of the athletes was performed by Brazilian taekwondo athlete Natália Falavigna.\nContrary to plan and tradition, the games were not opened by Brazil's head of state, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, but by the head of the Brazilian Olympic Committee, Carlos Arthur Nuzman. Prior to the official opening, Lula had been repeatedly booed whenever the in-stadium camera showed him on the large screen set up inside the stadium."

        "text": "Domestic club rugby union within Scotland remains a predominantly amateur sport; however, semi-professional and professional outfits have been created in recent decades to participate in cross-border competitions.\nProfessional Outfits.\nWith the advent of professionalism in 1995 the Scottish Rugby Union, just like the Irish Rugby Football Union, decided that existing club sides would be unable to compete with their counterparts in new cross-border tournaments such as the European Cup and Celtic League. It was decided by the Scottish Rugby Union that new professional teams would be created based on the union's four historic geographical districts and building upon the legacy/vehicle of the Scottish Inter-District Championship:\nThe North and Midlands side was a de facto district based on the combination of The North and Midlands districts.\nDomestic Rugby.\nScottish League Championship.\nThe Scottish League Championship is the annual domestic league structure competed for by over 150 clubs at both national and regional levels. \nPrior to restructuring in 2010, there were six national leagues - three divisions in the Premiership, and three in the National League - above the Regional Leagues. Further restructuring before the 2014-15 season scrapped the regional Championship A &amp; B leagues which sat below the National League for two seasons. The current structure is:\nScottish Cup.\nThe Scottish Cup was introduced in 1995 as a complementary knock-out cup competition. Though the structure of the cup has been changed numerous times it is currently contested by all National League clubs in the first round, with Premiership teams being added in the second and third rounds. The main cup competition is supplemented by regional shield and bowl competitions which all culminate in a 'Finals Day' at Murrayfield Stadium.\nScottish SuperCup.\nDuring the 2006-07 season an extra cup competition (The Scottish SuperCup) was introduced to replace the loss of fixtures in the Premiership due to league restricting. With the reversal of this restriction the following season the cup became redundant and was abandoned after a single season.\nBritish and Irish Cup.\nFor the 2009-10 season a new cross-border tournament was introduced, the British and Irish Cup which would contain semi-professional clubs from the four home nations. Originally Scotland was represented by three sides but with restricting this has increased to four, who are determined by final positions in the League Championship.\nUnincorporated Leagues.\nScotland is also home to the oldest organised rugby union league in the world, the Border League, which was formed in 1901. The Border League does not take part in the pyramid structure to the National League, but all of its clubs play in both. Two small independent leagues remain, with only a handful of members: the Grampian Alliance League and the Highland Alliance League. For university and 2nd and 3rd XV leagues, see University Leagues in Scotland and 2nd XV Leagues in Scotland.\nThere are a small number of women's leagues in operation - see University Leagues in Scotland and SWRU League."

Davis, Pres., for $10,000. Another adjoining were bought for $6,000. $17,000 had already been raised by selling shares for $100 a share, so with $1,000 in the bank, they forged ahead. Tom Davis designed the nine-hole course, and with the help of many volunteers, many of whom belonged to the Glenwood Lions Club, the work began. Two dams were built to supply the water for the greens, the fairways were seeded (1963), and the members of the soon-to-be Ladies League for the course hand planted trees. Opening day was May 30, 1964. Dues the first year were $35.00, and if you belonged within a five-mile (8 km) radius of Glenwood, you could not play without being a member. The old farmhouse was used as a clubhouse. Later a new clubhouse was built at a cost of $185,000."

He compiled a career win–loss record of 34–57 with a 3.85 earned run average (ERA). He is the only Swedish-born player in MLB history to appear in more than 1 or 2 games.\nEarly years.\nErickson was born in Vårgårda, Sweden, in 1892.\nProfessional baseball.\nErickson was the second player born in Sweden to play in the major leagues. Erickson was a right-handed pitcher who debuted with the Giants in 1914. Erickson pitched in only one game for the Giants, going five innings and giving up seven runs, though none were earned. In 1916, the Detroit Tigers gave Erickson a second chance, and he played parts of three seasons in Detroit, never having a winning season. He was traded to the Senators in 1919 and had his best seasons there. In 1919, as a teammate of Walter Johnson, Erickson led the American League in strikeouts per nine innings with 5.52, though he also was among the league leaders in hit batsmen and wild pitches. In 1921, Erickson was among the league leaders in ERA (3.62), strikeouts per nine innings (3.57), shutouts (3) and hit batsmen (11).\nErickson also pitched for several minor league teams. He led the San Francisco Seals to a Pacific Coast League pennant in 1917 and won the 1917 PCL pitching Triple Crown, winning 31 games with a 1.93 earned run average and 307 strikeouts in 444 innings.\nLater years.\nAfter his days in professional baseball, he worked in the shipping department of a metal company and also ran a farm. He died in 1965 at the age of 73 in Jamestown, New York."

On September 19, 1986, Cowley threw a no-hitter for the White Sox against the California Angels.\nEarly career.\nCowley graduated from Lafayette High School in Lexington, Kentucky and was not selected in the 1976 Major League Baseball draft. He attended a tryout camp in Huntington, West Virginia and earned a contract with the Atlanta Braves.\n1986: Strikeout record and no-hitter.\nOn May 28, 1986, Cowley set the then-major league record for striking out the most consecutive batters to start a game when he struck out the first seven Texas Rangers that he faced. Despite the feat, Cowley lost the game, surrendering five earned runs in less than five innings before being removed.\nOn September 19 of that same year, Cowley pitched a 7-1 no-hitter against the California Angels at Anaheim Stadium. After the eighth inning, with Cowley just three outs away, approximately one-third of the 28,647 fans in attendance left the stadium, in keeping with the perception that sports fans in Southern California are more concerned with avoiding traffic than watching games. The no-hitter was also memorable because Cowley threw as many balls as he did strikes (69), walking seven men and surrendering one earned run. After the game, Angels first baseman Wally Joyner said: \"Not to put Joe Cowley down, but it wasn't impressive.\"\nCowley did not win again in 1986, and after four winless starts in 1987, was released by the Phillies. Cowley thus became the only pitcher in MLB history never to win another game after pitching a no-hitter."

His best performances came in the \"floor\" events (non-televised tournaments with many boards being used simultaneously), where he won six PDC Pro Tour titles.\nCareer.\nA former England international, Smith won the England, Welsh and Norway Opens in his early career, as well as qualifying for the British Darts Organisation version of the world championship on four occasions (losing in the first round each time), before switching from the BDO to the PDC. His wins in the Scottish and South-West Regional Finals for the 2005 UK Open saw him enter the televised finals as number one seed, and he later qualified for the Las Vegas Desert Classic.\nSmith narrowly missed out on an automatic place in the 2006 PDC World Championship after jumping to 33rd in the rankings, but came through the PDPA qualifiers to book his place at the Circus Tavern. He overcame Colin Monk and Ray Carver to reach the last 16, before losing out to Alan Warriner-Little.\nSmith did not win another Pro Tour title until October 2007, when he took the PDPA Scottish Players Championship in Irvine – beating James Wade with a 108 average in the final. He won a Players Championship in Dinslaken, Germany in June 2009, hitting a nine-dart finish in his quarter final before defeating Colin Lloyd to take the title.\nSmith suffered three successive first round defeats in the PDC World Championship, losing to Mensur Suljović in 2008, Tony Ayres in 2009, and Darin Young in 2010. He broke this trend in the 2011 PDC World Darts Championship when he beat Shane Tichowitsch 3–1, and reached the last-16 for the second time in his career with a 4–3 win over Mervyn King, which included Smith hitting seven 100+ out-shots.\nIn June, Smith won the Bobby Bourn Memorial Players Championship beating Dave Chisnall 6–2 earning himself £6000. On his way to the final he narrowly beat Wayne Atwood 6–5 before he beat James Richardson also 6–5. He then picked up his form to beat Alan Tabern 6–3 which meant he faced Andy Hamilton 6–2. in the quarter-finals he beat Gary Anderson 6–1 setting up a semi-final clash with the in-form James Wade whom he beat 6–3 before prevailing in the final against Dave Chisnall hitting two 12 darters and two thirteen darters to seal the win.\nAt the 2012 World Championship Smith played Scott Rand in the first round and was beaten 0–3, without winning a leg. At the UK Open, Smith beat Rand 9–6 and came back from 4–8 down in the last 32 to force a decider against Dennis Priestley which he lost. In July, Smith won his first ever match in seven attempts at the World Matchplay following a 10–6 victory over Paul Nicholson. He faced Adrian Lewis in the last 16 and was beaten 7–13. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Smith was 19th on the Order of Merit, comfortably inside the top 32 who qualified for the Players Championship Finals. He was beaten 2–6 by Andy Hamilton in the first round.\nSmith lost in the first round of the 2013 World Championship to qualifier Daryl Gurney 3–1, hitting just 15% of his darts at a double during the match. He beat James Hubbard 5–3 in the second round of the UK Open, before losing 9–7 to Gary Anderson. Smith's deepest run of the year was at the fourth Players Championship where he lost 6–4 to Jelle Klaasen in the semi-finals.\nSmith overcame Steve Brown 3–1 in the opening round of the 2014 World Championship but then let a 3–0 set lead slip against James Wade in the second round to lose 4–3, missing two darts for the match in the process. He suffered a heavy 9–3 loss to Gary Anderson in the third round of the UK Open. Smith defeated Kevin Dowling 6–3 and Anderson and Ronnie Baxter both 6–2 at the Austrian Darts Open to play in his sole quarter-final of 2014. He lost to home favourite Mensur Suljović 6–2. He was knocked out of the World Matchplay and World Grand Prix by Wade. At the Players Championship Finals, Smith beat Michael Smith 6–4, before Adrian Lewis won 10–3 in the second round.\nSmith lost the first two sets of his first round match against Ronny Huybrechts at the 2015 World Championship without winning a leg. He went two nil up in legs in the next set but missed a total of five darts for it to be beaten 3–0. He was unable to get past the last 16 of any event in 2015 and dropped out of the top 32 on the Order of Merit during the year, which meant he failed to qualify for the World Championship for the first time since the 2005 event. He lost 6–5 in the first round of the 2016 UK Open to Jermaine Wattimena. Throughout 2016 he failed to progress beyond the last 32 of a single tournament. He was the world number 74 after the 2017 World Championship and entered Q School to try and win his place on the tour back.

        "text": "Bill A \"Rock\" Schroeder (born Alfred A William Schroeder on September 7, 1958) is an American former Major League Baseball player and a current television sports broadcaster. He played for the Milwaukee Brewers and California Angels between 1983 and 1990. Since 1995, Schroeder has been the primary color commentator on Brewers telecasts. He is currently paired with Brian Anderson or Jeff Levering when Anderson is doing national assignments for Turner Sports.\nEarly life.\nSchroeder was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and raised in the Princeton Junction of West Windsor, New Jersey. He is a graduate of West Windsor-Plainsboro High School (now West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South). While playing high school baseball, he earned All-State honors in his junior and senior years. He attended Clemson University, and assisted the Clemson Tigers in capturing the Atlantic Coast Conference Championships in 1978 and 1979.\nIn 1978, Schroeder played collegiate summer baseball for the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). He led the league in home runs and RBI, and led the Mets to the league title. Schroeder was named the league's MVP and outstanding pro prospect, and was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2009.\nPlaying career.\nHe was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the eighth round of the 1979 amateur draft. Throughout his career, he was typically used as a platoon or bench player.\nUntil the 2007 season, Schroeder was the fastest Brewers rookie to reach 15 home runs, achieving the milestone in only 71 games. In 2007, the record was bested by Ryan Braun, who hit 15 home runs in his first 50 games.\nThe 1987 season was Schroeder's best. He batted .332, and was a key member of \"Team Streak\", the Brewers team that won its first 13 games, tying an MLB record. On April 15, 1987, Schroeder caught the first no-hitter and only no-hitter by a single pitcher in Brewers' history, pitched by Juan Nieves. On May 16, 1987, with the Brewers playing the Kansas City Royals, Schroeder broke up a no-hitter by Royals pitcher Charlie Leibrandt with a bunt single. That would prove to be the only hit of the game. He was also the starting catcher for the American League All stars in Nintendo's popular video game, RBI Baseball for 1987.\nIn 1988, he was traded to the California Angels, where he played less and was less productive than in Milwaukee. In 1990, he was released by the Angels, retiring shortly thereafter.\nAnnouncing career.\nSchroeder began his post-playing career by appearing as an analyst for a Milwaukee-area baseball television show, \"Baseball Sunday\", in 1994. For the following season, he was asked to be the color commentator for the Milwaukee Brewers' television broadcasts, a position he has held ever since.\nSchroeder appeared on WTMJ Radio's \"Talking Brewers\" from 1998 to 2000.\nSchroeder manages the Brewers Fantasy Camp in Maryvale, Phoenix, Arizona, and will often discuss it during broadcasts.\nReferences.\nhttps://www.mlb.com/brewers/news/brewers-throw-combined-no-hitter"

        "title": "List of boxing triple champions",
        "text": "In boxing, a triple champion is a boxer who has won world titles in three weight classes. For most of the 20th century it was a remarkable and rare achievement accomplished by only a handful of fighters. Beginning in the 1970s, triple champions have become increasingly more common due to the proliferation of weight classes and sanctioning bodies in the sport. Bob Fitzsimmons was boxing's first triple champion, successively winning the middleweight, heavyweight and light-heavyweight titles between 1894 and 1903.\nEarly history.\nThe first triple champion of boxing was Bob Fitzsimmons when he added the light-heavyweight title to his middleweight and heavyweight titles on November 25, 1903.\nBarney Ross was the first boxer to simultaneously hold world titles in two different weight classes when he won the 135-pound lightweight and 140-pound light-welterweight titles against Tony Canzoneri on June 23, 1933. Later Ross won the 147-pound welterweight world title from Jimmy McLarnin on May 28, 1934.\nHenry Armstrong was the first man to hold three titles in three divisions simultaneously. He won the featherweight world title from Petey Sarron on October 29, 1937, the welterweight world title from Barney Ross on May 31, 1938, and the lightweight world title in his next fight, on August 17 against Lou Ambers. Armstrong then immediately vacated the featherweight world title because he could no longer make the weight.\nWilfred Benítez was the youngest ever champion at any weight. Benitez first won the 140-pound WBA light-welterweight title from Antonio Cervantes on March 6, 1976, at the age of 17. He moved up in weight to win the 147-pound WBC welterweight title from Carlos Palomino on January 14, 1979, and finally won a third title when he added the 154-pound WBC light-middleweight title from Maurice Hope on May 23, 1981.\nRecognition.\nMajor sanctioning bodies.\nThere is some dispute on which sanctioning bodies are considered \"major\" enough to be deemed legitimate world championships. The \"Big Four\" sanctioning bodies are always included:\n\"The Ring\".\nThe Ring, boxing's most respected magazine, has awarded world championships in professional boxing within each weight class from its foundation in 1922 until the 1990s, and again since 2001. \"The Ring\" champions were, at one point, considered the linear reign to the throne, the man who beat the man. The lineal champion is also known as the true champion of the division. \"The Ring\" stopped awarding world titles in the 1990s but began again in 2002.\nIn 2002, \"The Ring\" created a championship system that is \"intended to reward fighters who, by satisfying rigid criteria, can justify a claim as the true and only world champion in a given weight class.\" \"The Ring\" claims to be more authoritative and open than the sanctioning bodies' rankings, with a page devoted to full explanations for ranking changes. A fighter pays no sanctioning fees to defend or fight for the title at stake, contrary to practices of the sanctioning bodies. There are currently only two ways that a boxer can win \"The Ring\"s title: defeat the reigning champion; or win a box-off between \"The Ring\"s number-one and number-two rated contenders (or, sometimes, number-one and number-three rated). There are also only three ways that a boxer can lose \"The Ring\"s title: lose a championship fight, move to a different weight class, or retire.\nIn May 2012, citing the number of vacancies in various weight classes as primary motivation, \"The Ring\" unveiled a new championship policy. Under the new policy, \"The Ring\" title can be awarded when the No. 1 and No. 2 ranked fighters face one another or when the No. 1 and 2 contenders choose not to fight one another and either of them fights No. 3, No. 4 or No. 5, the winner may be awarded \"The Ring\" title. In addition, there are now six ways for a fighter to lose his title: lose a fight in his championship weight class; move to another weight class; not schedule a fight in any weight class for 18 months; not schedule a fight in his championship weight class for 18 months, even if fighting at another weight class; not scheduling a fight with a top 5 contender in any weight class for two years; or retiring.\nMany media outlets and members are extremely critical of the new championship policy and state that if this new policy is followed \"The Ring\" title will lose the credibility it once held.\n\"Lineal\".\nThe Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB) lists a version of the lineal championship in their rankings. TBRB lists a champion when their two top-ranked fighters in any division meet and currently recognizes legitimate world champions or \"true champions\" in each weight classes. The Board was formed to continue where \"The Ring\" \"left off\" in the aftermath of its purchase by Golden Boy Promotions in 2007 and the following dismissal of Nigel Collins. After the new editors announced a controversial new championship policy in May 2012, three prominent members of the Ring Advisory Panel resigned. These three members (Springs Toledo, Cliff Rold and Tim Starks) became the founding members of the \"Transnational Boxing Rankings Board\", which was formed over the summer of 2012 with the assistance of Stewart Howe of England.\nSince 2012, a version of lineal champions is predetermined by the \"Transnational Boxing Rankings Board\", which promotes the concept of a singular world champion per weight class. Another version of lineal champions are listed on the \"Cyber Boxing Zone\" website which list lineal champions of the \"Queensberry Era\" to date.\nMinor sanctioning bodies.\nThey are: International Boxing Organization (IBO), World Professional Boxing Federation (WPBF), International Boxing Association (IBA), International Boxing Council (IBC), International Boxing Board (IBB), International Boxing League (IBL), International Boxing Union (IBU), Global Boxing Association (GBA), Global Boxing Council (GBC), Global Boxing Federation GBF, Global Boxing Organization (GBO), Global Boxing Union (GBU), National Boxing Association (NBA), Transcontinental World Boxing Association (TWBA), Universal Boxing Association (UBA), Universal Boxing Council (UBC), Universal Boxing Federation (UBF), Universal Boxing Organization (UBO), UNIBOX, United States Boxing Council (USBC), World Athletic Association (WAA), World Boxing Board (WBB), World Boxing Championship Committee (WBCC), World Boxing Foundation (WBFo), World Boxing Institute (WBI), World Boxing League (WBL), World Boxing Network (WBN), World Boxing Union (WBU).\nNote:\nList of men's triple champions.\nThe following is a list of triple champions who have held titles from one or more of the \"Big Four\" organizations (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) and The Ring. \nWBA has four recognized world champions, \"Super\", \"Undisputed\", \"Unified\" and \"Regular\". The highest tier title is considered the primary champion of the division. Only boxers who are in the primary champion lineage are listed.\nThe ranking of WBA's primary champions are as follows:\nOther former international/national-world boxing commissions and organizations from the beginning of boxing are also included here:\nList of women's triple champions.\nThe following is a list of women's triple champions who have held titles from one or more of the \"Big Four\" organizations (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) and The Ring. \nList of three division champions in the original eight weight classes.\nThis exclusive list features boxers that are three division champions based on the original eight weight classes. A feat where only a few boxers have achieved. The Original Eight weight classes are as follows: "

        "text": "The waterfall climbing cave fish (Cryptotora thamicola), also known as the cave angel fish, is a species of troglobitic hillstream loach endemic to Thailand. It reaches a length of SL. This fish is known for its fins, which can grapple onto terrain, and its ability to climb. This fish is the only known member of its genus.\nThe species has been recorded from eight subterranean sites within a large karst system (Pang Mapha karst formation) in Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand. The species has an extent of occurrence of nearly 200 km2, but an area of occupancy of 6 km2; the connectivity of this karst systems is unknown, some caves are definitely connected. The species is found in eight of the caves. It has been recorded from the Susa (from where it was first collected in May 1985) and Tham Mae Lana (Borowsky and Vidthayanon 2001). It may also occur in other submerged caves in the area. However, the species has a potential threat of agricultural pollution which could impact the whole karst system, making it one location.\nLike other cavefish, it is depigmented and has no visible eyes. This species coexists with another hypogean (underground-living) loach, \"Schistura oedipus\". The species is specialized for fast subterranean flowing water in the deeper zone of the cave (more than 500m from the entrance). It depends on cave microorganisms and organic matter, and is very sensitive to disturbance, water quality and hydrographic change.\nThe species is protected under Thai law, and is found within a National Park (Pai Basin NP), but this does not necessarily protect the species as there is little restrictions on agricultural practices and regulation of tourism is needed to reduce the potential impacts to the species habitat at some sites. Human disturbance from tourism activity (some of the habitat sites are popular for caving tourism and sightseeing) may threaten the species. Agriculture and deforestation are future major threats.\nIn 2016 it was reported that the waterfall climbing cave fish walks with a tetrapod-like diagonal-couplets lateral sequence gait, displaying a robust pelvic girdle attached to the vertebral column."

        "text": "The International Volleyball Association was a short lived co-ed professional volleyball league in the United States from 1975 to 1980. Like other major sports leagues in the United States, it had two geographic divisions. However, its teams were entirely in the west. It is one of the few examples of a professional sports league where men and women competed on the same teams.\nIn keeping with the \"International\" name, the league included one team, El Paso-Juarez Sol, which acknowledged both sides of the international twin town in its name.\nDivisions.\nThe league started with 5 teams in 1975, but split into two divisions with the addition of the Tucson Turquoise in 1976. The two divisions were Western, which consisted of teams on the Pacific Coast, and a second, called Eastern in 1975 and Continental after 1977, for teams from the Rocky Mountain states.\nThe only team from the Eastern or Continental Division to win a championship was the Tucson Sky in 1979.\nTeams.\nThe teams and the years of existence were:\nVenues:\nSeason by year.\n1975.\nRegular Season\nThe league consisted of a single division. The top three teams made the playoffs, with the top team receiving a bye in the first round.\nPlayoffs\nRound 1\nChampionship (Best 3 of 5)\n1976.\nRegular Season\nThe league was split into two divisions: The Eastern Division and the Western Division.

The top two teams from each division played for the division championship, with the winners advancing to play for the league title.\nContinental Division\nWestern Division\nPlayoffs and Championships\nBest 3 out of 5\nContinental Division\nWestern Division\nChampionship\nRecords\nAttendance\nThe league's total attendance during the 1977 regular season was 227,058, which set a new record for the league. Including both the regular season and the postseason, the league's total attendance was 240,803.\nAwards\nMost Valuable Male Player: Ed Skorek (El Paso-Juarez Sol)\nMost Valuable Female Player: Rosie Wegrich (San Diego Breakers)\nCoach of the Year: Dodge Parker (Orange County Stars)\nAll-IVA First Team\nEd Skorek (El Paso-Juarez Sol)\nRosie Wegrich (San Diego Breakers)\nJon Stanley (Denver Comets)\nStan Gosciniak (Phoenix Heat)\nHilary Johnson (Orange County Stars)\nJon Roberts (Orange County Stars)\nAll-IVA Second Team\nJose Garcia (Santa Barbara Spikers)\nLinda Fernandez (Santa Barbara Spikers)\nBebeto DeFreitas (Santa Barbara Spikers)\nLarry Benecke (Denver Comets)\nScott English (Phoenix Heat)\nDodge Parker (Orange County Stars)\nMercedes Gonzalez (Tucson Sky)\n1978.\nRegular Season\nThe final standings for the season are incomplete. The latest published standings for the league that list the win–loss records for every team read as follows:\nContinental Division\nWest Division\nBefore the playoffs began, the league announced that the Tucson Sky had forfeited their August 19 match against the San Diego Breakers, which had not been played due to the Sky's flight being delayed. After forfeiting the match, Tucson's final record was 21-15, while San Diego's record was 11-25. The Santa Barbara Spikers and Orange County Stars finished the season with the records shown in the table above. The El Paso-Juarez Sol finished with a 16-20 record.\nPlayoffs and Championship\nIn the Continental Division playoffs, the Tucson Sky faced the El Paso-Juarez Sol. Tucson won the first match at El Paso on August 31 in three straight sets (12-7, 12-3, 12-5). In the following match, which was played in Tucson on September 4, the Sky won 3-0 (13-11, 12-5, 12-7) to move into the finals.\nIn the West Division playoffs, the Santa Barbara Spikers played the Orange County Stars. The Stars won the first match, which was played on September 1, 3-1 (12-3, 12-9, 5-12, 15-13). On September 3, Santa Barbara won the second match 3-0 (12-10, 12-4, 12-10). With the series tied 1-1, the teams then played a tiebreaker, which Santa Barbara won 12-6 to advance to the finals.\nIn the finals, the Sky and Spikers played a close opening match on September 6. The Sky ultimately won 3-2 (12-6, 8-12, 12-10, 3-12, 6-3). Santa Barbara won the second match, which was played the following night, 3-0 (12-8, 12-5, 12-9). The match was immediately followed by a tiebreaker for the league title, which was at one point tied 8-8 before Santa Barbara scored four consecutive points to win 12-8.\nThe players for Santa Barbara were Reede Reynolds (USA), Luis Eymard (Brazil), Jose Luis Garcia (Mexico), Bebeto de Freitas (Brazil), Larry Milliken, Sue Herrington, Rosie Wegrich and Peter Stefaniuk.\nRecords and Statistics\nThe Tucson Sky's Scott English set four playoff match records for highest average (.700), highest efficiency (.650), most service aces (four), and most service aces in a series (seven). Tucson's Irma Cordero set playoff records for the highest serve receiving average (.962) and with two other players set the record for the highest serve receiving average in a match (1.000). Rosie Wegrich of the Santa Barbara Spikers played in her thirty-third playoff match, setting the new league record.\nThe Tucson Sky set three playoff match records, including highest average (.588), most service aces (eight), and most service aces in a series (24).\nAttendance\nTucson led the league with 2,347 fans per game, while the expansion Seattle Smashers averaged 2,306 fans per game after the All-Star break. The league's total attendance during the regular season (247,661) was nearly ten percent higher than it had been the previous season. Including the postseason, the IVA's total attendance for 1978 was 264,292.\nAwards\nMost Valuable Male Player: Bebeto DeFreitas (Santa Barbara Spikers)\nMost Valuable Female Player: Rosie Wegrich (Santa Barbara Spikers)\nCoach of the Year: Byron Shewman (Tucson Sky)\nAll-IVA First Team\nLuiz Eymard (Santa Barbara Spikers)\nBebeto DeFreitas (Santa Barbara Spikers)\nRosie Wegrich (Santa Barbara Spikers)\nGarth Pischke (El Paso-Juarez Sol)\nScott English (Tucson Sky)\nIrma Cordero (Tucson Sky)\nAll-IVA Second Team\nEd Skorek (Seattle Smashers)\nLinda Fernandez (Seattle Smashers)\nJon Stanley (Denver Comets)\nJon Robert (Orange County Stars)\nDodge Parker (Orange County Stars)\nHilary Johnson (San Diego Breakers)\n1979.\nRegular Season\nThe league remained divided into two divisions. Similar to the playoff format from the year before, the top two teams in each division played for the division championships, with the winners advancing to the league championship.\nContinental Division\nWestern Division\nPlayoffs and Championship\nBest 3 out of 5\nContinental Division\nWestern Division\nChampionship\n1980.\nThe IVA fell apart during the 1980 season. On June 11, the owners of the San Jose Diablos halted operations. On June 12, William Levy, the owner of the Santa Barbara Spikers, sold the team to Don Moger. Moger planned to move the team to Los Angeles. The league refused to approve the sale, believing that Moger planned to move the Spikers to Los Angeles during the season instead of waiting until 1981. Following the league's decision, Levy chose not to finance the team, which played no games after June 17. Next, the partnership that owned the Albuquerque Lasers announced on June 16 that it did not have enough money to continue running the franchise. Jim Matison and Don Sammis, who owned the Tucson Sky and Salt Lake Stingers, respectively, attempted to come to an agreement to purchase the league and keep it running. However, Sammis withdrew from the deal on July 9, and the league subsequently collapsed.\nNotable players.\nNBA great Wilt Chamberlain played for the Southern California Bangers in 1975, but did not play in 1976. When he became an investor in the IVA and president of the league in 1977, he returned as a player for the Orange County Stars. He played for the Seattle Smashers in 1978 and the Albuquerque Lasers in 1979."

        "text": " \nThe Philippines women's national basketball team is managed by the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP).\nCompared to the men's national team, the women's national team receives less reception from local basketball enthusiasts. Locally based players has no national league to play in after college which has a few leagues such as the WNCAA, Filoil Premier Cup, and Fr. Martin's Cup. The women's national team has been playing at Level II at the FIBA Asia Championship for Women for the past few editions of the tournament. Again in contrast of their men counterpart who were often describe as powerhouses in the Southeast Asia region, the women's national team has been behind Thailand and Malaysia in the past few years.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nWomen's basketball in the Philippines dates back as early as the 1910s. Basketball was first introduced to the Philippine public school system by the Americans as a women's sort in 1910 and was played in Interscholastic meets in 1911 until 1913. The sport used by Americans to promote good health and motherhood and citizenry grew in popularity among women. Women's basketball met opposition from conservative groups, particularly the Catholic Church who view bloomers worn by women basketball players as inappropriate. By the time skirts were allowed to be worn above bloomers as a compromise, women's basketball is already in the decline and is only played in provincial and local interscholastic meets. Indoor softball and as well as volleyball became the more preferred sport for Filipino women.\nSBP era (2007–present).\nPerlas Pilipinas 1.0 (2007–2015).\nOn 2007, Discovery Suites, a hotel brand, became the main sponsor of the women's national team. On 2008, Haydee Ong was appointed as head coach of the women's national team replacing Matthew \"Fritz\" Gaston, who guided the team to a bronze medal finish at the 2007 Southeast Asian Games in Thailand and a silver medal finish at the 2007 SEABA Championship for Women. Under Ong, the team won the gold medal at the 2010 SEABA Championship for Women, the country's first medal at the said tournament. The team previously won silver during the 1995, 1997, and 2007 editions of the tournament.\nThe team pushed for the naturalization of 6'3\" tall Chinese, Zheng Xiaojing, a move parallel to the naturalization of American-born Marcus Douthit for the men's national team. Zheng's naturalization process started with the filing of House Bill 02683 by Congressman Roberto Puno of Antipolo in August, about the same time as Douthit's. Head coach Ong lobbied the SBP and the Philippine Congress to hasten the naturalization process of Zheng so that she can join the national team for the 2011 editions of the FIBA Asia Championship and the Southeast Asian Games While Douthit was eventually naturalized, Zheng's naturalization was in limbo. In August 2014, team manager, Cynthia Tiu said that the team will focus on developing homegrown players than resort to naturalizing players. Tiu said that Zheng was disappointed but also said that a re-filing of her petition for naturalization cannot be done since Zheng is already married.\nPerlas Pilipinas 2.0 (2015–2019).\nThe SBP appointed Patrick Aquino as the new head coach of the national team. His first task will be to guide the national team at the 2015 Southeast Asian Games. Ever Bilena Cosmetics, Inc. has been made the new sponsor of the national team. SBP executive director Sonny Barrios pointed out the decision to make changes in the coaching staff of the women's team was made after discussions among members of the search and screening committee, which is composed of several basketball stakeholders.\nIn a historic run, Perlas officially promoted in the Level 1 of the FIBA Asia Women's Championships that will held in 2017, after the win against India, 82–76.\nGilas Pilipinas Women (2019–present).\nIn May 2019, the SBP announced that the Gilas Pilipinas name would be used across all its sporting programs for the men's, men's youth (men's under-19 and men's under-17), men's 3x3 and women's teams. Aquino assumed responsibility over the Gilas Pilipinas Women program.\nGilas Women attained their best finish at the FIBA Women's Asia Cup in the 2023 edition. They avoided the relegation playoff for the very first time by at least one group stage game at the expense of Chinese Taipei – also their first group stage win since their promotion to the first division in 2015. They finished sixth overall in a tournament of eight teams.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nPhilippines roster at the 2022 Asian Games."

        "text": "The Rugby Europe Women's Championship is an international competition contested between women's national teams who are members of Rugby Europe (known from 1999 to 2014 as FIRA - Association of European Rugby, and FIRA before that). The competition has its origins in a four nation \"European Cup\" held in 1988 but did not become an official FIRA competition until 1995. The competition has grown significantly and in some years it attracts sufficient entrants for it to be divided into two \"Pools\" (A and B) with the eight highest ranked entrants in any year (based on Rugby Europe rankings) in Pool A.\nSince 2000 only the winner of the tournament held in between the World Cups (every four years, as highlighted) is officially recognised \"European Champions\", although teams winning tournaments in other years are often unofficially also described as \"European Champions\". This can cause some confusion, not least because the structure of the four-yearly tournament is invariably identical to the annual event. To make identification easier the competitions in the four yearly cycle are highlighted.\nThe only major difference between the \"official\" European Championships and other tournaments is that in the latter, between 2001 and 2007, England and France tended not to send their full strength national squads to the competition - though until 2007 they still played as \"England\" or \"France\". This has resulted in some confusion about the status of games played by these nations - England do not consider their games to be full internationals (or \"tests\") and do not award caps, whereas while France also do not give caps to their players in such matches, they do recognise the games as tests matches. FIRA and all other competing nations consider all the games to be \"tests\".\nThe 2009 tournament acted as Europe's qualification tournament for the World Cup (all entrants sending full strength squads), after which the test match status problem was finally resolved. From 2010 onwards it was announced that the non-Championship tournaments would be known as the \"European Trophy\" and any Six Nations entrants would officially be \"A\" sides (though in 2010 Italy, as they had not qualified for the 2010 World Cup, entered their full strength squad)."

        "title": "Chris Lawrence (rugby league)",
        "text": "Chris Lawrence (born 19 October 1988) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played his entire career as a and for the Wests Tigers in the NRL, and has played for Australia at international level.\nHe also played for the Prime Minister's XIII and NSW City.\nBackground.\nLawrence was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nLawrence played junior football with Eaglevale St Andrews. While attending St Gregory's College, Campbelltown, he played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 2006.\nCareer.\n2006–2010.\nIn Round 21 of the 2006 season, and whilst still in high school, Lawrence made his debut for the Wests Tigers against the Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium. He is the youngest player to have debuted for the Tigers, at 17 years and 283 days old. He scored a try in that game, in which a second-string Tigers side scored an upset 20–6 win over the eventual premiers, and played in every match for the remainder of the year, picking up two tries in five appearances of his rookie season.\nThe following year, Lawrence played in eighteen of the Tigers' twenty-five matches as he went on to score sixteen first-grade tries, playing in a variety of positions. At season's end, he was selected to tour Papua New Guinea as a member of the Prime Minister's XIII.\nLawrence backed up his two-try performance in 2007 with another double in 2008 for the PM'S XIII. 2008 was the first year Lawrence cemented a position in the Wests Tigers side, starting every game in the centres.\nLawrence studied Exercise and Sports Science at Sydney University.\nLawrence celebrated his 50th NRL match with two tries in the round 3 game against the Sydney Roosters on 27 March 2009.\nHe was selected for City in the City vs Country match on 8 May 2009, but was unable to play due to injuring his ankle the week before. In 2009 Lawrence was then named in the 40-man New South Wales preliminary squad for State of Origin, but was not selected for any games. The following year he made his debut for City.\nAged just 21, Lawrence scored his 50th try towards the end of the 2010 season, in what was also his first semi-final appearance. He was named in the Australian squad for the Four Nations, and scored a try in his international debut against New Zealand in November.\n2011–14.\nAt the start of 2011, Lawrence signed a contract to remain with Wests Tigers until the end of 2015. He started the season with four tries from the first three matches, but then suffered a dislocated hip that kept him sidelined for over three months. Lawrence said, \"I asked the nurses (after I regained consciousness) if (the hip) went in alright. They said, 'No, it wasn’t easy. It took five or six people to get it back in.' So that was probably something I didn’t want to hear; about the positions and them trying to yank my leg back in.\" A further injury to his hamstring saw Lawrence play in just nine games for the season, but he was still selected in Australia's Four Nations squad, and played in every game of the series.\nLawrence played 20 games in 2012, sometimes at five-eighth due to injuries to the club's established halves. Lawrence admitted his form for the season was relatively poor, saying, \"Not making the top eight was disappointing as a team but you need to look at each individual performance and, myself included, we just didn't perform how we should have. I put a lot of pressure on myself to be better. I was happy with the way I played in 2011 but sometimes [in 2012] circumstances through my fault, sometimes no one's fault, sometimes through different things, didn't allow it to pan out that way.\"\nPlaying under new coach Mick Potter in 2013, Lawrence had another injury-disrupted season, playing in just 13 games. He had a similar start to the season in 2014, suffering from recurring hamstring problems. He said, \"I know myself my form was good in the pre-season trials. I unfortunately picked up an injury before round one and have been carrying that for the last couple of weeks.\" In round 9, Lawrence co-captained the Wests Tigers for the first time, with Aaron Woods. He went on to play 21 games in 2014, but scored just four tries.\n2015–17.\nBy the midpoint of the 2015 season, Lawrence had gone almost a year without scoring a try. New coach Jason Taylor moved him to the second row with Lawrence breaking his try-scoring drought with two tries against the Gold Coast Titans in round 13. Lawrence said, \"I played in the back row a bit when I first came into grade. Sheens put me in the back row, lock, five-eighth, on the wing and everywhere. It's a bit different being one closer to the middle, so obviously you have to do a bit more of the tough stuff and a few more tackles. So I just have to get my body a bit more used to that with the extra work.\"\nLawrence continued in the second row in 2016, but moved to five-eighth for one game in round 9 when Mitchell Moses was a late withdrawal after injuring himself in the warm-up. With Aaron Woods missing games with injury, Lawrence co-captained the Tigers in his absence. In May, he was named as captain of City. He said, \"Representing Australia was a career highlight but being told this is recognition of my leadership qualities on and off the field is special in a different way. I'm honoured and, while we have a young side, for someone like Brad Fittler to think of me to be his captain is humbling.\"\nLawrence played in the first ten games of the 2017 season, but injuries, including a pectoral tear, limited him to only four games for the rest of the year. In round 6 against the Cowboys, he became the fourth person to play 200 games for the Wests Tigers, and on 30 July, playing against the Titans, he equalled Benji Marshall's record for the most tries for the club with his 76th four-pointer.\n2018.\nWith the departure of Aaron Woods, Lawrence was named as one of five co-captains at Wests Tigers, alongside Benji Marshall, Elijah Taylor, Russell Packer and Josh Reynolds. Coach Ivan Cleary said, \"I just think it's the right model for us right now. When we started this pre-season, it was pretty obvious straight away that there was no real pecking order. There was no set culture to adhere to. It was all new.\" With the role rotating, Lawrence was the on-field captain for round 1.\nIn round 5 against the Melbourne Storm, Lawrence broke the record for most tries by a Wests Tigers player with his 77th, having previously been tied with Benji Marshall. After the game, he said, \"Yeah, it was good. More good to get off the nudie run to be honest.\" Lawrence went on to score seven tries in 2018, the most of any Wests Tigers forward for the season, and his best effort since 2010.\n2019.\nLawrence missed the start of the 2019 season after a head-clash with teammate Ben Matulino in the pre-season, which required plates to be inserted in his face. He said, \"My injuries were likened to a car accident. A couple of surgeons that I saw really hadn’t seen anything like it in rugby league, and that put the recovery in a bit of limbo because I didn't really know how long until I was going to be back. It was a week-by-week proposition – seeing the surgeons and specialists each week.\"\nIn Round 20, Lawrence scored his first try of the season as Wests defeated North Queensland 28–4 at Leichhardt Oval.\nOn 21 October, Lawrence signed a one-year contract extension with the club.\n2020.\nOn 18 August, Lawrence announced that the 2020 NRL season would be his last, saying, \"I just want to be remembered as that guy who got out and gave his all every time he was on the field, who did his job for his team and always put his body on the line and his team first.\" He made 12 appearances and towards the end of the season returned to his earlier position of centre. For the first time in his career, he failed to score a try in the season, but retired with the club record of 84 tries shared with Benji Marshall, and the highest total by a Wests Tigers centre with 54. It was said after his last game, \"any player who has ever lined up alongside Lawrence will say he's the hardest worker and the ultimate loyal clubman.\""

        "text": "The 2008 US Open was a tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts. It was the 128th edition of the US Open, and the fourth and final Grand Slam event of the year. It took place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, New York City, United States, from August 25 through September 8, 2008.\nThe men's defending champion, Roger Federer, won the US Open for a fifth consecutive time. Justine Henin, the women's defending champion, did not return to defend her title due to her retirement from tennis, for personal reasons, earlier in the year. Serena Williams was the champion on the women's side, winning her third US Open title; she had last won the event in 2002. Federer and Williams's opponents, Andy Murray and Jelena Janković, were making their débuts in Grand Slam finals. World number ones Rafael Nadal and Ana Ivanovic went out in the semifinal and second round, respectively. This was Nadal's best ever result at the US Open; for Ivanovic, it was her second early exit at a Grand Slam since her win at the 2008 French Open.\nThe home nation had success; Serena Williams was the first American to win a singles title since Andy Roddick in 2003. Twin brothers Bob and Mike Bryan won their second US Open title, and Liezel Huber (who became an American citizen in 2007) won the women's doubles with Zimbabwean Cara Black.\nPreparations.\nThe International Tennis Federation and United States Tennis Association offered audiences a number of new ways to access the Open in 2008. A YouTube channel was set up to broadcast highlights, and the official US Open website featured hourly updates of what was happening at the tournament. Multiple matches could be accessed at any one time, on handheld video devices courtesy of American Express. In celebration of the 40th anniversary since the US National Championships became \"open\" to professionals, a special opening ceremony was held, showcasing all the singles champions of the previous 40 years, with over two dozen of them in attendance. The ceremony was hosted by actor Forest Whitaker and included musical performances from funk band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. In addition to this, fans were shown nightly video tributes, and a commemorative book was published. On August 23, the annual Arthur Ashe Kids Day was held; Roger Federer, Andy Roddick, James Blake, Novak Djokovic, Ana Ivanovic, and Serena Williams led the player participation. Musical acts including the Jonas Brothers and Sean Kingston performed on this day as well.\nDay-by-day summaries.\n\"Day by day summaries of the men's and women's singles events, with men's, women's, and mixed doubles exits also listed. Both the men's and women's singles draw are composed of 128 players, with 32 of these players seeded.\"\nDay 1.\nSeeds progressing on the first day of play included David Ferrer, Andy Murray, David Nalbandian, Stanislas Wawrinka, Gilles Simon, Philipp Kohlschreiber, and Gaël Monfils. Recent Olympic gold medalist, and new World No. 1 Rafael Nadal, who acknowledged that he was suffering from fatigue post-match, advanced after being tested by qualifier Björn Phau; and Juan Martín del Potro, who entered the Open on a run of nineteen consecutive wins, and who, over the course of this run, had become the first player in ATP history to win his first four titles in as many tournaments, beat fellow Argentine Guillermo Cañas. Together Nadal and del Potro had completed the longest winning streaks on the tour in 2008, with Nadal's run having extended to 32 matches. Americans James Blake (seeded ninth) and Donald Young treated the home crowd to a match spanning five sets, in one of the scheduled night matches, with Blake emerging as the victor. Juan Mónaco and Feliciano López were the only seeds who failed to progress.\nIn the women's competition, Jelena Janković, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Vera Zvonareva, Marion Bartoli, Victoria Azarenka, Patty Schnyder, Caroline Wozniacki, Francesca Schiavone, Anabel Medina Garrigues, Katarina Srebotnik, and Sybille Bammer all made safe passage into the second round. Nadal's Olympic counterpart, Elena Dementieva, made hard work of her win against Akgul Amanmuradova, and former champion Lindsay Davenport, playing the US Open for the first time since her return to the sport from a break due to motherhood, beat recent Bank of the West Classic winner Aleksandra Wozniak in a comfortable two sets. Seeded losers included 2007 semifinalist Anna Chakvetadze, who lost to Ekaterina Makarova, making this her worst Slam finish in three years; Maria Kirilenko, who lost to Tamira Paszek; and Shahar Pe'er, who lost to Li Na 2–6, 6–0, 6–1.\nDay 2.\nDay 2 saw the first round matches from the bottom half of the draw begin; Fernando González, Fernando Verdasco, Ivo Karlović, Tommy Robredo, Igor Andreev, and Paul-Henri Mathieu all progressed. Defending champion and number two seed Roger Federer, playing his first Grand Slam since the 2004 Australian Open at a seeding lower than number one, beat Máximo González 6–3, 6–0, 6–3, and Andreas Seppi, the thirty-first seed, triumphed in five sets (6–3, 7–5, 3–6, 3–6, 6–3) over Hyung-taik Lee. Four seeds exited the tournament: Richard Gasquet, who lost in five sets to former world number two Tommy Haas; Tomáš Berdych, who lost to home favorite Sam Querrey in a humbling 6–3, 6–1, 6–2 scoreline; Canada Masters runner-up Nicolas Kiefer, who retired at two sets to one and 4–1 down in his match against Ivo Minář; and Mikhail Youzhny, who withdrew due to a viral illness.\nWorld No. 1 and top seed Ana Ivanovic, who had recently returned from injury, began her campaign with a hard-fought win over Vera Dushevina, coming through 6–1, 4–6, 6–4. The Williams sisters Venus and Serena, both former champions, advanced with relative ease, as did in-form player and US Open Series winner Dinara Safina. Agnieszka Radwańska, Ágnes Szávay, Flavia Pennetta, Alizé Cornet, Nadia Petrova, Nicole Vaidišová, Alona Bondarenko, Dominika Cibulková, and former world number one Amélie Mauresmo all scored victories to enter the second round. However, eleventh seed Daniela Hantuchová suffered a heavy defeat by qualifier Anna-Lena Grönefeld, and thirty-first seed Virginie Razzano was also beaten.\nMadison Dauenhauer of Anaconda, Montana was a spectator, and also Paul Hanley's niece, at the tournament\nDay 3.\nOn Day 3, the remaining men's first round matches were completed. Third-seeded Novak Djokovic, who had won the Australian Open earlier in the year, won in straight sets against Arnaud Clément, but was hampered by an ankle injury, for which he received courtside treatment. Andy Roddick produced a sterling performance to defeat Fabrice Santoro 6–2, 6–2, 6–2, and Nikolay Davydenko, who entered the tournament on a poor run of form was, by his own admission, surprisingly efficient in dispatching Dudi Sela 6–3, 6–3, 6–3. Nicolás Almagro, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Radek Štěpánek, and Marin Čilić won their matches to claim places in the second round, meaning that no seeds were knocked out on Day 3.\nIn the women's second round matches, Elena Dementieva, Patty Schnyder, Marion Bartoli, Victoria Azarenka, Caroline Wozniacki, Lindsay Davenport, Katarina Srebotnik, and Sybille Bammer all recorded routine victories to reach the third round. Two players who faced greater resistance from their opponents were Jelena Janković and Svetlana Kuznetsova. Janković, playing against Sofia Arvidsson, had match points in the second set, and eventually came through 6–3, 6–7(5), 6–4. The match, which lasted two hours and forty-four minutes, left Janković unable to complete her warmdown. Kuznetsova meanwhile, had to come back from being 4–2 down to Sorana Cîrstea in the first set, before winning in two. Fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva, a bronze medalist at the Olympic Games, lost to Tatiana Perebiynis; Francesca Schiavone lost to Anne Keothavong, making Keothavong the first British woman to reach the third round of the US Open since Jo Durie's run at the 1991 Open; and Anabel Medina Garrigues lost to recent Wimbledon semifinalist Zheng Jie.\nDay 4.\nThe second round of the men's singles commenced, and David Nalbandian, Stanislas Wawrinka, Ivo Karlović, Gilles Simon, and Juan Martín del Potro all reached the final sixty-four of the draw. Joining them was Rafael Nadal, who completed an imposing defeat over qualifier and world number 261 Ryler DeHeart, 6–1, 6–2, 6–4. Three seeds who faced sterner tests from their opponents were David Ferrer, who won a battling contest against Andreas Beck in four sets, Andy Murray, who was inconsistent in defeating Michaël Llodra 6–4, 1–6, 7–5, 7–6(7), and American James Blake, who was tied 4–6, 6–3, 1–0 with Steve Darcis before the Belgian's retirement. Two upsets occurred on Day 4: one involved Philipp Kohlschreiber, who retired against the Legg Mason Tennis Classic finalist of a fortnight previous, Viktor Troicki, at 2–6, 6–3, 6–4, 3–0 down; the other saw Paul-Henri Mathieu beaten by American Mardy Fish 6–2, 3–6, 6–3, 6–4.\nIn the second set of women's second round matches, world number 188 Julie Coin provided one of the biggest shocks of the tournament, as she defeated Ana Ivanovic, the World No. 1, 6–3, 4–6, 6–3. It was the earliest exit made by a top seed at the tournament since Maria Bueno's second round loss at the 1967 U.S. National Championships (Bueno received a first round bye), before the beginning of the Open Era. Ivanovic, who made a similarly unexpected exit at the Wimbledon Championships, conceded that she was not playing to the standard of a world number one. Coin set up a clash with Amélie Mauresmo, who bypassed the threat of Kaia Kanepi 2–6, 6–4, 6–0. Venus Williams eased to victory over Rossana de los Ríos 6–0, 6–3, and sister Serena won in similar fashion versus Elena Vesnina, 6–1, 6–1. A top ten seed who had greater problems progressing was Dinara Safina, who was troubled by her own unpredictable manner of play in defeating Roberta Vinci 6–4, 6–3; Agnieszka Radwańska, Nadia Petrova, Flavia Pennetta, Alizé Cornet, and Dominika Cibulková also came through. Two seeded players who fell were Ágnes Szávay, who lost to Tathiana Garbin 5–7, 6–2, 6–3, and Nicole Vaidišová, who lost to Séverine Brémond.\nDay 5.\nRoger Federer and Nikolay Davydenko completed easy wins, over Thiago Alves and Agustín Calleri respectively, to reach the third round on the fifth day of play at Flushing Meadows. Novak Djokovic was forced into a first set tiebreak against American qualifier Robert Kendrick, and, after having been 6–2 up, faced two sets points in Kendrick's favor, before winning it 10–8; Djokovic then took the next two sets, 6–4, 6–4. Afterwards, Djokovic credited the first set win to his improved mental strength. Another top ten seed who faced problems in the early stages of his match was Andy Roddick, who eventually secured a 3–6, 7–5, 6–2, 7–5 win over Ernests Gulbis. Fernando González won in straight sets against Bobby Reynolds, despite sustaining an ankle injury; Tommy Robredo ended 2000 champion Marat Safin's participation in four; and Gilles Müller and Jarkko Nieminen, two unseeded players, won their matches after each having been two sets down. Other seeds to make progress were Fernando Verdasco, Nicolás Almagro, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Igor Andreev, Dmitry Tursunov, Radek Štěpánek, Marin Čilić, and Andreas Seppi.\nIn the women's singles, Svetlana Kuznetsova became the second top five seed to be knocked out in the space of two days, as she succumbed to number twenty-eight seed Katarina Srebotnik, 6–3, 6–7(1), 6–3. Kuznetsova praised Srebotnik in defeat, saying that she had no qualms over her own performance. Jelena Janković, who was playing Zheng Jie, found herself in a similar predicament to Kuznetsova, in that she was facing a second difficult match-up in three days. Janković, however, prevailed, 7–5, 7–5, after a steadfast Zheng saved four match points in a final game that witnessed 11 deuces. Marion Bartoli reached the fourth round, beating veteran Lindsay Davenport, who would neither confirm nor deny whether she was on the brink of retirement. Elena Dementieva, Patty Schnyder, and Sybille Bammer all continued their progress through the early rounds, and Caroline Wozniacki, the twenty-first seed and winner of titles in Stockholm and New Haven in the month leading up to the Open, upset fourteenth seeded Victoria Azarenka.\nDay 6.\nDay 6 featured several upsets and lengthy contests, as four of the eight men's matches went to five sets, and five seeded players were knocked out. The win that \"The New York Times\" lauded as the greatest upset of the men's competition thus far, was Kei Nishikori's victory over 2007 semifinalist and fourth seed David Ferrer. Nishikori, ranked world number 126, won after Ferrer had staged a comeback from two sets down, and then saved five match points of his, 6–4, 6–4, 3–6, 2–6, 7–5. Aged 18, he was the youngest man to reach the fourth round at the US Open since Marat Safin in 1998, and the first Japanese man since Shuzo Matsuoka at the 1995 Wimbledon Championships to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam. Nishikori set up a tie with Juan Martín del Potro, who stretched his winning run to 22 matches with a 6–4, 6–7(4), 6–1, 3–6, 6–3 triumph over Gilles Simon, who was seeded one place higher than him at sixteenth. Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka both came through in five sets, and both had to forge comebacks after having been 2–0 down in sets. Murray, who at one point was two points away from losing the match, defeated Jürgen Melzer 6–7(5), 4–6, 7–6(5), 6–1, 6–3; whilst Wawrinka beat lucky loser Flavio Cipolla 5–7, 6–7(4), 6–4, 6–0, 6–4. Thirty-second seed Gaël Monfils, who had reached the semi-finals of his last Grand Slam, the French Open, knocked out number seven David Nalbandian; unseeded Mardy Fish beat number nine seed and good friend James Blake; and the also unseeded Sam Querrey beat number fourteen Ivo Karlović (all straight sets). Rafael Nadal also reached the fourth round.\nMilestones were also being set in the women's competition, as Anna-Lena Grönefeld (who beat number seventeen seed Alizé Cornet) became the first qualifier to reach the fourth round of the US Open since Anna Kournikova in 1996. The Williams sisters continued their progression untroubled, as each won on the scoreline of 6–2, 6–1 (Venus against number twenty-seven seed Alona Bondarenko, Serena against number thirty Ai Sugiyama). Dinara Safina was again forced into a tough match, eventually beating teenager Timea Bacsinszky 3–6, 7–5, 6–2, after being two points away from losing the match in the second set. In the other matches, ninth seed Agnieszka Radwańska eased to victory over eighteenth seed and recent Rogers Cup finalist Dominika Cibulková, 6–0, 6–3; sixteenth seed Flavia Pennetta beat Nadia Petrova, seeded three places lower; Amélie Mauresmo ended the run of Julie Coin; and wild card Séverine Brémond knocked Tathiana Garbin out of the tournament.\nDay 7.\nOn the day that marked the half-way point of the tournament, the men's third round matches were finished. Novak Djokovic, facing the number thirty seed and recent Pilot Pen Tennis champion Marin Čilić, was severely tested by the 19-year-old, but won through 6–7(7), 7–5, 6–4, 7–6(0) in four hours. Čilić continued to claw his way back into the match, as early breaks of serve by Djokovic in the final three sets were all nullified, and two match points were missed before he won. Roger Federer's win was in contrast to this, as he completed a comprehensive victory over number twenty-eight seed Radek Štěpánek, 6–3, 6–3, 6–2; and Andy Roddick also made easier passage to the fourth round, defeating number thirty Andreas Seppi 6–2, 7–5, 7–6(4). Both of these players were particularly successful on their serves. Nikolay Davydenko also put in a consummate performance to beat twenty-sixth seed Dmitry Tursunov, 6–2, 7–6, 6–3. Fifteenth seed Tommy Robredo knocked out the nineteenth seed and Australian Open finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (who was playing his first tournament since having knee surgery in May); eleventh seed Fernando González defeated Jarkko Nieminen in four sets; and number twenty-three seed Igor Andreev defeated his higher-ranked opponent, number thirteen Fernando Verdasco, 6–2, 6–4, 6–4. Finally, qualifier Gilles Müller, who had not won three successive Tour level matches since July 2005 coming into the event, beat a second opponent after being two sets to love down (this time number eighteen Nicolás Almagro) in consecutive rounds, 6–7(3), 3–6, 7–6(5), 7–6,(6) 7–5.\nNumber two seed Jelena Janković faced a third successive match in which she struggled to reach the next round, but came through against teenager Caroline Wozniacki 3–6, 6–2, 6–1. Janković, who faced a similarly stern test versus Wozniacki at Wimbledon, was sluggish in the opening set, but proved dangerous on the rebound, as she took the next two losing only three games, and played in a more aggressive manner. Elena Dementieva cruised to victory against Li Na, and fifteenth seed Patty Schnyder beat Katarina Srebotnik to reach her second US Open quarterfinal, her first having come ten years earlier. Notably, the other fourth round match played, between twenty-ninth seed Sybille Bammer and number twelve Marion Bartoli, matched the longest women's singles match on record at the Open, clocking in at three hours and three minutes—with Bammer prevailing, 7–6(3), 0–6, 6–4. Bartoli called the trainer twice during the match, and said afterwards that she had been ailed by a stomach bug and low blood pressure.\nDay 8.\nRafael Nadal faced the first opponent, home favorite Sam Querrey, to cause him a palpable threat, as he came through 6–2, 5–7, 7–6(2), 6–3. Nadal struggled in the latter stages of the second set (which was the first one he dropped in the tournament), and up until the tiebreak of the third, putting in a subdued performance in which the quality of his serve wavered. An American who did progress to the quarterfinals was Mardy Fish, who beat number thirty-two seed Gaël Monfils 7–5, 6–2, 6–2. Fish played an attack-minded match, hitting 49 winners and regularly utilizing serve and volley tactics. Meanwhile, in the men's night match between number six seed Andy Murray and number ten Stanislas Wawrinka, Murray secured an accomplished win (6–1, 6–3, 6–3), in what BBC journalist Piers Newbery called \"one of the best performances of his career\". Murray set up a clash with Juan Martín del Potro, who defeated Kei Nishikori in straight sets, 6–3, 6–4, 6–3.\nIn the women's singles, fourth seed Serena Williams continued to make serene progress, as she defeated Séverine Brémond 6–2, 6–2. Williams was highly successful on her first serve, with a conversion rate of 69%, and a points-won rate of 90%. Sister Venus, the number seven seed, set up a quarter-final clash with her, as she also completed an easy victory, over ninth seed Agnieszka Radwańska, 6–1, 6–3. Serena and Venus, who had recently played each other in the Wimbledon final (with Venus emerging the victor), expressed dismay at their seedings, which meant that they met at an earlier round than the final. The pair had previously faced each other in the Open final, with Venus winning in 2001 and Serena the following year. Also progressing was sixth seed Dinara Safina, who faced a difficult first set against Anna-Lena Grönefeld, 7–5, 6–0. Safina, who had encountered several difficult opponents before this round, revealed afterwards that she was in tears directly before the match, due to the physical exertion she had endured thus far. However, coach Zeljko Krajan had persuaded her to play, and she told reporters of her relief at having done so. Flavia Pennetta also navigated her way into the quarterfinals (the first time that she had reached this stage of a Grand Slam), defeating Amélie Mauresmo 6–3, 6–0. Mauresmo, a former world number one and two-time Grand Slam champion, played an error-strewn match, in which she served 14 double faults and hit 40 unforced errors.\nDay 9.\nOn Day 9, two of the top three seeds, and the two finalists from the previous year, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, were severely tested. Federer, aiming for his fifth consecutive Open title, was playing twenty-sixth seed Igor Andreev in one of the scheduled night matches on the Arthur Ashe Stadium; he was victorious in five sets, 6–7(5), 7–6(5), 6–3, 3–6, 6–3. Federer struggled to break Andreev's serve in the opening two sets, whereas Andreev broke Federer in the first game of the first, and had seven break points in the early games of the second (Andreev had a low success rate overall, only taking advantage of two out of fifteen break points in the whole match). In the final set Andreev, at 4–2 down, had five further break point opportunities, but failed to convert any as Federer served out the match. Djokovic was also pushed to five sets, defeating fifteenth seed Tommy Robredo 4–6, 6–2, 6–3, 5–7, 6–3 in nearly four hours. Robredo broke Djokovic's serve at 4–4 the first set, before Djokovic won sets two and three with some ease. However, after having broken serve in the fourth, Robredo leveled the match at 3–3, prompting the number three seed to smash his racket, and be the subject of booing from sections of the crowd. Djokovic failed to convert break points at 5–5, allowing Robredo to forge a break of his own and take it to a fifth set. Djokovic was able to close out the match after breaking at 2–2 in the final set. Djokovic was beset by problems related to both a hip injury (for which he required two time-outs) and exhaustion, having been unable to sleep until 4.30 am (UTC−5) on Day 8 after his match with Marin Čilić. Robredo responded by saying, \"I think that if you're not fit enough, then don't play.\" Djokovic set up a tie with sixth seed Andy Roddick, who easily beat eleventh seed and Olympic silver medalist Fernando González 6–2, 6–4, 6–1; 2003 champion Roddick acknowledged that he would have to complete an upset to defeat Djokovic, despite Djokovic's admission that whomever he faced in the next round would be a fitter opponent. Gilles Müller continued his unexpected run, as he defeated fifth seed Nikolay Davydenko in a demanding match that finished 6–4, 4–6, 6–3, 7–6(10). Müller, who served twenty aces, became the lowest-ranked player, at world number 130, to reach the quarterfinals of the Open since Nicolas Escudé (rank 136) in 1999, and the lowest-ranked at a Grand Slam tournament since Alexander Popp (rank 198) at Wimbledon 2003. He was also the first Luxembourgian to reach the quarterfinal stage of a Grand Slam.\nThe latter stages of the women's tournament began, as the quarterfinal matches in the bottom half of the draw were played. Fifth seed and 2004 finalist Elena Dementieva progressed first, defeating the fifteenth seed Patty Schnyder with a competent display, 6–2, 6–3. Dementieva won the first set with two breaks, and although Schnyder broke back to level at 3–3 in the second, Dementieva won the next three games. Jelena Janković, a semifinalist in 2006, joined her, completing an easy 6–1, 6–4 win over twenty-ninth seed Sybille Bammer, who was playing in her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. Janković, whose match was relocated to the Louis Armstrong Stadium after the Federer-Andreev match overran, was one of four players, along with Dementieva, Serena Williams, and Dinara Safina who stood a chance of claiming the World No. 1 spot at the end of the tournament.\nDay 10.\nThe first two quarterfinal matches of the men's singles were played; top seed Rafael Nadal and sixth seed Andy Murray advanced to set up a match versus each other. Murray, who played first, defeated seventeenth seed Juan Martín del Potro, and ended del Potro's 23-match winning streak in the process. Murray endeavored to victory in nearly four hours, with the final scoreline at 7–6(2) 7–6(1), 4–6, 7–5. There was a history of antagonism between the pair, despite having only played once before, at the 2008 Rome Masters; in this match, del Potro had allegedly hit a ball straight at Murray, and not apologized, and later insulted Murray's mother. In the first set, Murray raced ahead, and led 4–1 before del Potro went on to win the next four games. Murray then broke back, and dominated the tiebreak that took place shortly afterwards. In the second set, it was Murray who broke late in the set, at 5–5, and he had an opportunity to serve for the set. Although del Potro broke back, Murray again eased through the tiebreak. Murray accelerated to a 3–1 lead in the third set, but del Potro fought back, and won the set, affording Murray only one more game. The players exchanged two breaks of serve in the final set, before Murray gained a decisive break at 6–5 to reach his first Grand Slam semifinal. Murray said the history of ill feeling between the pair did not transfer itself to the court, and that del Potro had apologized as the players shook hands at the end. The nineteen-year-old del Potro, who was playing in his first Grand Slam quarterfinal, hailed Murray as one of \"best players in the world\" in his press conference; however, he was unable to finish the round of questioning, and left midway through in tears. In the match between Nadal and the unseeded American Mardy Fish, Fish continued to play the attacking brand of tennis that he had done in the previous round, and, in front of a partisan home crowd, won the first set 6–3. However, Nadal improved his performance in the following three sets, and produced a number of passing shots to counter Fish's aggressive play, eventually coming through 3–6, 6–1, 6–4, 6–2. Due in part to the longevity of the Williams-Williams match, the players remained on court until after 2.11 am, meaning that the match was sixteen minutes shy of the latest match ever played at the Open.\nThe late women's match was between the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, both of whom had won the Open title twice previously. Serena prevailed in two sets, 7–6(6), 7–6(7), but not without considerable difficulty. Venus took the initiative in the opening stages, breaking to lead 3–1, and had the advantage of serving for two sets points at 5–3, 40–15. However, Serena launched a comeback, and won the first set on a tiebreak score of 8–6. In a second set that mirrored the first in many ways, Venus broke at 3–2 up, and again served for the set at 5–3; Venus used an array of attacking shots, regularly approaching the net and playing a number of cross-court forehands. Venus then led Serena for a large portion of the second set tiebreak, but squandered eight sets points; Serena, meanwhile, won on her first match point to secure the tiebreak 9–7. Serena commented afterwards that the siblings were \"definitely playing the best [tennis of the tournament] so far.\" Sixth seed Dinara Safina filled the other semifinal spot, defeating sixteenth seed Flavia Pennetta 6–2, 6–3. Safina, who had reached the final stage of six of her previous seven tournaments, said that she hoped to emulate her brother Marat, who won his maiden Grand Slam tournament at Flushing Meadows in 2000.\nDay 11.\nDay 11 featured a men's quarterfinal, between Novak Djokovic and Andy Roddick, that, like the match between Murray and del Potro, was preceded, and in this case, followed, by a controversial incident somewhat extraneous to the match played. Roddick said, in a press conference held on Day 10, that Djokovic was \"either quick to call a trainer or the most courageous guy of all time\", insinuating that his opponent had a reputation for being injured (as he had been in his previous match) and, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, listed a series of esoteric conditions that Djokovic may have been afflicted with (\"Back and a hip? And a cramp? Bird flu? Anthrax? SARS? Common cough and cold?\"). The American, renowned for his serve, struggled with this aspect of his game in the early stages of the match, and Djokovic broke three times in the first set, winning in 27 minutes; he then took the second, needing only one break of serve in that set. However, Roddick, who had the support of the home crowd to his advantage, broke to lead 3–1 in the third, and he eventually won the set. In the fourth set, Roddick appeared to have gained momentum after breaking Djokovic's serve to lead 4–3. Roddick was playing with increased exuberance at this point, and the crowd became more vocal, even making noise during Djokovic's service motions. Roddick's serve failed him again though when, at 5–4, 30–0 up, he doubled-faulted twice and allowed Djokovic to break back; the number-three seed then went on to win the tie-break and seal the win 6–2, 6–3, 3–6, 7–6(5). Djokovic then vented his anger at Roddick's comments in a post-match, court-side interview, beginning by stating, sarcastically, \"Andy was saying that I have 16 injuries in the last match; obviously I don't, right?\" The crowd then began to boo Djokovic, to which he said, \"Like it or not, it's like that.\" The interviewer, wanting to defuse the situation, told Djokovic that, \"This crowd loves you, but you could turn them against you real fast\"; Djokovic responded by saying \"I know [the crowd] are already against me because they think I am faking everything.\" In a later interview, Roddick criticized Djokovic for being able to mock other players with his impressions, but being unable to receive mockery of himself in a gracious manner; Djokovic showed contrition, calling it a \"mistake\" and apologizing to Roddick. Djokovic had set up a match with the player he lost to in the 2007 final, Roger Federer, who had earlier beaten qualifier Gilles Müller 7–6(5), 6–4, 7–6(5). The former World No. 1 produced a measured performance, attacking Müller in the latter stages of the three sets. Müller fended off five set points in the first, before being broken in the tiebreak at 4–4. Federer broke serve at 4–4 (games) in the second set, and then served that set out; Müller put up stronger resistance in the third set tiebreak, leading 4–1 and 5–3, but after this allowed Federer to win the next four points. With this victory, Federer maintained his sequence of consecutive Grand Slam semifinals, with this being the eighteenth time he had done so.\nDay 12.\nOn women's semifinal day it was the two former World No. 1s, Jelena Janković and Serena Williams, who came through in blustery conditions. For Janković, it was the first time she had reached the final of a Grand Slam, having made the semi-finals on four previous occasions. She was also the third Serb to reach a Grand Slam final in 2008 (men's and women's singles), making them the most successful nation in this regard. She progressed first, defeating Elena Dementieva 6–4, 6–4. Dementieva was in the ascendency in the early part of the match, as she broke serve to lead 4–2 and dictated the play from the baseline. However, Dementieva began to hit more unforced errors at this point, and Janković took advantage of this, winning the next four games to secure the first set. On set point, which was on Dementieva's serve, Janković caused a minor controversy when she asked the ball boy for a towel, thus exceeding the 25 second time limit between points; she received a code violation (warning) from the umpire as a result of this incident. Both players struggled to hold serve in the early stages of the second set, and they traded two breaks apiece from 1–1 to 3–3. Both players then held serve to 4–4, before Janković broke at 5–4 to win the match. Dementieva had problems throughout the match; she was broken on serve five times, and committed forty-two unforced errors in total. However, she said that her recent Olympic triumph provided more than mere consolation, as she assigned a higher worth to the Olympic tennis event. Janković, who was in tears at the end of the match, had suffered a spate of injuries in 2008, and claimed that this was the first tournament of the year that she was injury free. Williams also won in two sets, defeating Dinara Safina 6–3, 6–2. Safina broke Williams in the first game of the match, but Williams soon asserted herself, and after having broken back, broke again to lead 5–3. Although Williams faced break points in this game, she eventually came through to win the first set. Safina, who was troubled by the wind for the whole match, was then broken after being 40–0 up in the first game of the second set. Williams eased to a 5–1 lead before closing out the match with a big serve. Williams told afterwards of her excitement of having an American player back in the final (the last women's singles final to feature an American woman was 2002, when, as previously mentioned, she and her sister played each other). Safina meanwhile, chastised her own behavior on the court, saying that she acted like a \"spoilt girl\" and would in the future try to contain her emotions.\nDay 13.\nFears had been raised on the days leading up to Day 13 that this would be the date on which the north-east coast of the US would be affected by the remnants of Hurricane Hanna, and they proved to be correct. A substantial part of \"Super Saturday\", as it often known (because the men's semifinals and women's final are played on the same day, something unique among the Grand Slam events), was called off due to rain. The United States Tennis Association's original contingency plan was to start the men's semifinals at the earlier time of 11 am (UTC−5), an hour earlier than tradition dictates. If the men's matches were completed, but the women's final could not be, then both finals would be played on Day 14, the final Sunday. Were none of the matches to be completed, Day 13's schedule would be forwarded by one day, and an extra day would be allocated for the men's final. Minor rescheduling took place on the day; for example, the match between Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray began at a later start time than the Roger Federer–Novak Djokovic match, 12:40 pm (it was relocated from the Arthur Ashe to Louis Armstrong Stadium), to allow people to see part of both matches. This created logistical problems for the organizers, as many fans left the semifinal between Federer and Djokovic to get good seats at the other. Ultimately, with one men's match finished, and another half-way completed, the organizers decided to designate a fifteenth day's play, with the women's final having been cancelled due to ongoing rain. The final decision was that on Day 14, the conclusion of the men's semifinal between Nadal and Murray and the women's final would be played in separate sessions, and the men's final would be played on the following day. This was the first time since the 1974 Open, when Billie Jean King beat Evonne Goolagong, that the women's final was not played on the Saturday, and the first time since 1987 that an extra day was required.\nIn the one men's semifinal that was completed, Federer, who had endured a poor season by his standards, defeated Djokovic 6–3, 5–7, 7–5, 6–2 to reach his third Grand Slam final of the year, and seventeenth overall. The last time the pair had met on hardcourts was in January, in the Australian Open semifinal, where Djokovic had convincingly beaten Federer; the time before this was in the aforementioned 2007 final, where Federer had won in straight sets. Both players made impressive starts to their encounter on this occasion, as they secured easy holds of serve the opening two games. However, in third game, Federer broke, and did not lose another service game in the first set. In the second set, it was Djokovic who gained the early break, and he led 3–1 before Federer rallied back to draw level at 4–4. However, this proved to be in vain as Federer, who had already saved two set points from 0–40 down, was broken at 5–6 to hand Djokovic the second set. The score was deadlocked at 5–5 in the third when Federer fashioned a crucial break of serve, and went on to win the set. During the match, Djokovic had felt the wrath of the US crowd, who were vociferous in their support for Federer, and who at times cheered when he hit unforced errors. After being broken at 5–5, Djokovic turned and gave them a mock gesture of thanks, which only incited them further. Federer added afterwards that he felt he had broken Djokovic's will by winning this set. Federer broke again in the fifth game of the fourth set, and did not lose another game as he cruised to victory. The other men's semifinal, between Nadal and Murray, was suspended with the score at 6–2, 7–6(5), 2–3 in Murray's favor (although he was a break down in the third). Murray began the match in an aggressive manner, serving and volleying, and hitting several winners from the back of the court. He was rewarded with two breaks of serve in the first set, at 1–1 and 4–2. Murray continued to bother Nadal on serve in the second, but could not break, despite holding seven break points, and facing none against himself. In the tie-break, he squandered an early lead before reeling off three points in a row at 4–5 down to gain a two-set advantage. Nadal broke Murray early in the second set, before a short postponement in play was initiated when a light rain appeared, in order to give the referee time to assess whether the court was still suitable for play. Murray queried the initial decision to stop play, but the rain soon came on stronger, and the match was suspended overnight.\nDay 14.\nThe first session of play on Day 14 saw Murray round off his victory against Nadal, 6–2, 7–6(5) 4–6, 6–4. Play resumed on Arthur Ashe Stadium, and Nadal won all three of his service games, fending off one break point from Murray in the process, to win the third set. Both players then had opportunities to break at the start of the fourth. Nadal had one in the first game, and Murray had seven in the second; this second game spanned a total of twenty-two points, and took 15 minutes to be concluded. The resolute Nadal held out though, and broke Murray to love in the next game. Murray came back into the match, leveling the scores at 3–3; and he broke again to win the match at 5–4. After a somewhat fortuitous net cord at deuce of that game, Murray hit a backhand pass at match point to confirm the win. Murray, who came into the match having failed to beat Nadal in five previous encounters, became the first Briton, male or female, since Greg Rusedski at the 1997 Open to reach the final of a Grand Slam singles tournament. Nadal, who was also playing in his first US Open semifinal, said that, with the number of matches he had played recently taken into consideration, he was pleased with his overall performance at the Open. Had the match gone to seeding, Nadal would have been facing his rival, Federer, for a third time in a Grand Slam final in 2008, after having already beaten him at the French Open and Wimbledon.\nThe women's singles final was also played, and Williams was victorious over Janković in two sets, 6–4, 7–5. Williams also reclaimed the number one berth for the first time since 2003, something that Janković would have done had she won the title. The players came into the final with a win–loss record against each other of 3-3, although Janković said beforehand that, \"Overall, she's, I think, the strongest player on the tour, together with her sister.\" The match was preceded by an opening ceremony that included Anita Baker singing the US national anthem, a group of people moving a gigantic American flag over the court, and a coin toss performed by Billie Jean King. The match, which the BBC called \"one of the more memorable US Open finals\", began in exciting fashion, with Serena being edged to deuce in the first game, as both players hit a number of winners and unforced errors in the opening stages. Janković appeared to be playing with greater confidence though, when she broke to love in the third game of the match. Any advantage that this break gave her was nullified in the next game, as Williams broke back from 40–0 down. Janković was broken again to go 4–2 down, but it was her turn to break back as Williams made several errors when serving for the set at 5–3. Her work was undone when she went 0–40 down in the subsequent game, and after saving one set point, ceded the first set to Williams on the following one.\nWilliams began the second set ominously for Janković, as she held to love and then forced two break points on her serve. The next four games saw the players contest several exhausting rallies, but Williams was the only one to force any break points, gaining a lead of 15–40 at 2–1 and 3–2, with Janković holding both times. Before the seventh game of the third set, Williams went to use her towel, and Janković complained to the umpire about the violation; the same one she had committed in the previous round. With the score at 40–30 in Williams's favor, Janković hit a winner, and although the decision of the line judge incensed Williams, it was shown to be clearly in on the Hawk-Eye review; Janković then won the game, and her next one when back on serve. She had her first three set points in the next game, racing to a 0–40 lead, but failed to convert any as Williams held on. With Janković serving for the set (5–4), Williams hit three winners to take a 0–40 lead, the final point in this sequence being her eighth in a row. Janković won the next three points, and after Williams twice held advantage, she hit an ace to bring up her fourth set point. However, Janković double-faulted on this opportunity, and allowed Williams to win the game on her sixth break point. Williams won the next two games, and although Janković had a game point at 6–5, she double-faulted, and Williams took the match on her second championship point.\nThis was the ninth Grand Slam tournament that Williams had won, and she did not drop a set on her way to doing so. At the time, Williams joined an elite group of six women who had won nine or more Grand Slam titles in the open era, equaling Monica Seles's tally with this triumph. Williams, who had dominated the sport from 2002 to 2003, but been ranked outside the top 125 in 2006, put her renaissance, not only in this tournament but for the whole of 2008, down to a better approach towards fitness. Williams had won her first Grand Slam at the Open, in 1999, and reflected on her future by saying that she wanted to win several more before her career was over. Janković meanwhile, said she was contented with her first outing in a Grand Slam final, and joked that she probably deserved an Oscar for the dramatic nature of her matches in the two weeks that led up to the final.\nDay 15.\nRoger Federer defeated Andy Murray in straight sets 6–2, 7–5, 6–2, to claim his fifth consecutive title, thus cementing his place in history as the first man since Bill Tilden in 1924 to have achieved this feat. The only other men to have done so were Richard Sears, in 1887, and Bill Larned, in 1911 (Jimmy Connors and Pete Sampras had each won five times, but not consecutively). Federer created a new record, becoming the first man to have won two different Grand Slam events five consecutive times (the other being Wimbledon), and this win left him one short of Pete Sampras's all-time men's record of 14 Grand Slam singles wins. In the context of Federer's career, this was the sixth straight year in which he had won a Grand Slam. Murray also came into the match aiming to break a pre-open-era record, his being one of national importance—the last British man to have won a Grand Slam singles title was Fred Perry at the 1936 U.S. National Championships, the last British woman to have done so was Virginia Wade at Wimbledon 1977.\nComing into this tournament, both players had contrasting records at Grand Slams: the twenty-seven-year-old Federer had reached sixteen Grand Slam finals, and won twelve, whereas the 21-year-old Murray had yet to reach the final of one. Murray also had the task of becoming the first man since Sergi Bruguera, at the 1993 French Open, to beat the top two players in the world at a Grand Slam. He did however, hold a win–loss record of 2–1 against Federer, and had most recently beaten him at the 2008 Dubai Tennis Championships. Murray, who expressed confidence coming into the final, said that this small positive record stood for little, and he, along with a number of commentators, including former Wimbledon champions Pat Cash and Michael Stich, acknowledged Federer to be the favorite, despite his disappointing year.\nThe match, dubbed by American sports promoter Don King as the \"Grapple in the Apple\", began at 5:00 pm (UTC−5). The pair easily held the opening three games, before Federer launched his first assault on Murray's serve at 2–1 up; he could not, however, convert his one break point opportunity. Federer eased through next service game, and broke Murray for the first time at 3–2 following a succession of errors from Murray. Federer fired another series of big serves in the seventh game, and then broke Murray to win the first set, 6–2, in twenty-seven minutes. Murray lost the first two games of the second set, meaning that Federer had won a cumulative total of six games in a row. Murray immediately broke back though, and appeared to have steadied himself by winning the next game, allowing Federer only one point. Federer failed to hit any successful first serves in the next game, and Murray gained three consecutive break points at 0–40. Federer won the next three points, despite, on evidence of a replay, having clearly hit one of his shots long. Because Murray did not stop the point, he could not challenge the call; after the match, when Murray was asked about this, he said he was disappointed, but thought that the rules were correct in not allowing retrospective challenges. Both players comfortably held the next four games, although some minor threats presented themselves for Federer at 4–4, 0–15 and 30–30 (Murray hit backhands long both times). Murray was aided in the next game, when he was serving to stay in the set, as Federer hit four unforced errors, all going long. Federer won the next game, and then seized his final opportunity on a Murray service game, winning the final game of the second set to love.\nFederer began to overpower his opponent in the third set; Murray was broken to love twice as Federer raced ahead to a 5–0 lead, with Murray winning only four points up to that point. He did, however, win the next two games. Federer broke the game after though, winning on his second championship point in a point that required three smashes from the defending champion. The match lasted one hour and fifty-one minutes, thirteen minutes fewer than it took to complete the women's final. The only players that Federer had not surpassed, in terms of US Open wins, at this point in his career were: Richard Sears, who had won seven straight, Bill Larned, who won seven overall, and Bill Tilden with six straight and seven overall (all three of these players played before the open era). In the last on-court televised interview, Federer was adamant that he would not stop at thirteen, describing such a scenario as \"terrible\". Federer, who at the time had a total win–loss record of 45–4 at the Open and 34-match winning streak, said that the streak was of great importance to him, especially after having lost at Wimbledon. Reflecting on his year, he said, \"I had a couple of tough Grand Slams this year. To take this one home is incredible.\" Murray said of the competition with Federer in tournaments that \"I got the better of him the past two times, but he definitely set the record straight\", and said, on his future, \"I know mentally now that I can get to a Slam final, and physically. The only thing it comes down to is the tennis.\" Paying tribute to Federer, he said that, \"I came up against, in my opinion, the best player ever to play the game.\"\nSummaries of other events.\nSeniors doubles.\nMen's.\nIn the men's doubles, American twins Bob and Mike Bryan won the sixth Grand Slam title of their careers, and their second at the US Open, having last won in 2005. They beat the pairing of Lukáš Dlouhý and Leander Paes, 7–6(5), 7–6(10). Dlouhy and Paes, who were the number seven seeds, were playing in only their sixth tournament as a team. Of the sixteen seeds, the Bryans and the Dlouhy-Paes combination were the only ones to make it as far as the quarterfinal stage. In the final itself, the Bryans had to come back from being a break down in the first set, before winning it in the tiebreak. In the second set, the teams traded breaks, before the Bryans came through a longer tiebreak. The pair came into the event having won the bronze medal at the Olympics, and they did not drop a set on their way to winning the tournament. This win allowed them to recover their number one spot in the rankings, dethroning Daniel Nestor, who had lost in the third round partnering Nenad Zimonjić. After the match, the 30-year-old brothers played down their chances of catching The Woodies, who won 11 Grand Slam titles in their career.\nWomen's.\nCara Black and Liezel Huber won the women's doubles, which was their fourth Grand Slam title together (Black's fifth overall), the first US Open win for either, and Huber's first as a US citizen (she was born in, and had previously represented, South Africa). Black and Huber were top seeds, but had last won a Grand Slam at Wimbledon 2007. In the final, they beat the tenth seeded team of Lisa Raymond and Samantha Stosur, both of whom were former World No. 1s and Grand Slam champions, 6–3, 7–6(6). Black and Huber had been down two set points in the second set tiebreak, at 6–4, but went on to win the next four points to ensure that, like the Bryans, they did not lose a set in any of their matches. Black and Huber had faced each other three days earlier in the mixed doubles final. Speaking of this match, Black said that it was \"one of the toughest matches I've ever played\" and that, because of this, \"I really wanted to win it for her.\"\nMixed.\nIn the mixed doubles, Black and Paes, seeded fifth, teamed up to defeat the unseeded partnership of Huber and Jamie Murray (brother of Andy), 7–6(6), 6–4. It was Paes's fourth mixed doubles title, Black's third, and their first together. Huber and Murray dominated the opening stages of the first set tiebreak, leading 5–2 and 6–4, before Black and Paes came back to take the set. Despite some pressure on Paes's serve in the early stages of the second set, Murray was broken early on, and Black and Paes took the title.\nJuniors.\nDue to the rain on Saturday, the boys' and girls' singles semi-finals were moved to an indoor tennis centre at Port Chester, New York.\nBoys'.\nThe boys' singles final saw reigning Wimbledon champion Grigor Dimitrov pitted against home favorite Devin Britton, a qualifier who had knocked out several seeds, including number two and reigning Australian Open champion Bernard Tomic, on his way to the final. Dimitrov, playing in his final junior tournament, defeated Britton 6–4, 6–3. Three American boys made the semifinals, making this the most successful tournament for the home nation since 2000, when Andy Roddick, Ytai Abougzir, and Robby Ginepri all reached that stage. Britton was surprised at his breakthrough, saying that he was \"happy to be in the main draw\" at the beginning of the event.\nGirls'.\nIn the girls' singles final, American wild card CoCo Vandeweghe defeated Gabriela Paz Franco 7–6(3), 6–1. Both players were inexperienced coming into the final: it was Vandeweghe's first tournament win on the ITF Tour, and Paz-Franco, who called the tournament an \"amazing experience\", was playing in her first junior Grand Slam. Vandeweghe, who is the niece of former basketball player Kiki Vandeweghe, credited her improved performances to greater maturity. Their match, like the boys' final, was concluded relatively quickly.\nBy reaching the finals, Britton and Vandeweghe became the first American boy/girl duo to make the singles finals since 1992, when Brian Dunn and Lindsay Davenport did so.\nDoubles.\nThe junior doubles competitions were rescheduled for Friday evening before Super Saturday, to avoid the weather. In the boys' doubles, Niki Moser and Cedrik-Marcel Stebe defeated Henri Kontinen and Christopher Rungkat in a close final, 7–6(5), 3–6, 10–8. In the girls', Noppawan Lertcheewakarn and Sandra Roma defeated Mallory Burdette and Sloane Stephens, 6–0, 6–2. Lertcheewakarn said she was glad to have won for Roma, who was playing in her final junior Grand Slam. Roma said that she would like to partner Lertcheewakarn again at some point in the future.\nSeniors.\nMen's singles.\n Roger Federer defeated Andy Murray, 6–2, 7–5, 6–2\nWomen's singles.\n Serena Williams defeated Jelena Janković, 6–4, 7–5\nMen's doubles.\n Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan defeated Lukáš Dlouhý / Leander Paes, 7–6(5), 7–6(10)\nWomen's doubles.\n Cara Black / Liezel Huber defeated Lisa Raymond / Samantha Stosur, 6–3, 7–6(6)\nMixed doubles.\n Cara Black / Leander Paes defeated Liezel Huber / Jamie Murray, 7–6(6), 6–4\nJuniors.\nBoys' singles.\n Grigor Dimitrov defeated Devin Britton, 6–4, 6–3\nGirls' singles.\n CoCo Vandeweghe defeated Gabriela Paz Franco, 7–6(3), 6–1\nBoys' doubles.\n Niki Moser / Cedrik-Marcel Stebe defeated Henri Kontinen / Christopher Rungkat, 7–6(5), 3–6, [10–8]\nGirls' doubles.\n Noppawan Lertcheewakarn / Sandra Roma defeated Mallory Burdette / Sloane Stephens, 6–0, 6–2\nWheelchair.\n\"The wheelchair events did not take place in 2008 due to a calendar conflict with the Beijing Summer Paralympic Games.\"\nLegends.\nMen's champions invitational.\n Pat Cash defeated Mats Wilander, 6–2, 6–2\nWomen's champions invitational.\n Martina Navratilova defeated Jana Novotná, 6–3, 6–3\nMixed champions invitational.\n Anne Smith / Stan Smith defeated Ilana Kloss / Guillermo Vilas, 6–4, 6–4\nQualifier entries.\nMen's qualifiers entries.\nThe following players received entry into a lucky loser spot:\nWomen's qualifiers entries.\nThe following players received entry into a lucky loser spot:\nProtected ranking.\nThe following players were accepted directly into the main draw using a protected ranking:\nWildcard entries.\nBelow are the lists of the wildcard awardees in the main draw."

        "title": "Jeff Abbott (baseball)",
        "text": "Jeffrey William Abbott (born August 17, 1972) is an American former professional baseball player who played outfielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1997 to 2001. He played for the Chicago White Sox and Florida Marlins.\nCareer.\nAbbott attended Dunwoody High School, in Dunwoody, Georgia and the University of Kentucky. He was first drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 32nd round (901st overall) of the 1993 MLB draft, but decided not to sign the contract offered to him. He was then drafted by the Chicago White Sox, again, in the 4th round (117th overall) of the 1994 MLB draft.\nAbbott began his minor league career with the Hickory Crawdads of the ‘A’ ball league Southern Atlantic League (North). After just four games he was called up to the GCL White Sox in the Gulf Coast League in 1994. In 63 games with the GCL White Sox he batted .393 with six home runs and 48 RBI. He began the 1995 season at advanced A ball league Prince William Cannons and in 70 games he batted .348 with four home runs and 48 RBI, before advancing to AA Birmingham Barons of the Southern League. In 55 games with the Barons he had three home runs and 28 RBI while batting with an average of .320.\nThe 1996 season saw Abbott playing for the AAA Nashville Sounds of the American Association where he would remain all year as the team's starting left fielder. There, in 113 games Abbott batted .325 with 14 home runs and 60 RBI while stealing 12 bases. He led the Trams starters in HR's and had the third highest batting average on the team. He was with Nashville for the 1997 season as well where he again batted over .300, this time hitting at .327 with 11 home runs and 63 RBI while again swiping a dozen bases, before getting the call to join the MLB in June of that year.\nAbbott made his first MLB plate appearance for the Chicago White Sox on June 10, 1997, against the New York Yankees’ Andy Pettite grounding into a double play. He collected his first two major league hits the next day off the Yankees Kenny Rogers. His first major league home run would come on September 15 in Milwaukee off the Brewers Cal Eldred. He would remain with the White Sox for the remainder of the season, playing ten errorless games in the outfield, and hitting .263 over 19 games with two RBI, and the lone home run. Abbott remained with the big club for the 1998 season, as the team's 4th outfielder. Abbott posted fairly respectable numbers averaging .279 with 12 home runs to with 41 RBI in 89 games that season, but his defense declined, as he committed four errors, for a rather poor .971 fielding average. Abbott began the 1999 campaign again with the White Sox, but following a poor first month (.158 avg. 2 HRs and only six RBI) he was demoted to the AAA Charlotte Knights of the International League where he regained his form with the bat to hit .318 with nine homers and 37 RBI in the 67 games he appeared.\n2000 had Abbott back in Chicago for another season with the White Sox. While hitting for average once again (.274) his power numbers dropped (only three home runs) along with 29 RBI over 80 games, where again Abbott served as an extra outfielder and occasional Designated Hitter. He saw his only postseason action in game 2 of the American League Division Series in which the White Sox were swept in 3 games by the Seattle Mariners.\nIn December 2000, Abbott was traded to the Florida Marlins in exchange for outfielder Julio Ramirez. Abbott opened the 2001 season in the Marlins farm system. He played briefly in both A and AA ball before batting .320 with 9 home runs and 24 RBI with the AAA Calgary Cannons of the Pacific Coast League before getting the call to the Marlins the end of July. With Florida, Abbott appeared in just 28 games in what would be his final major league season, and batted .262 with five RBI and no home runs primarily as a pinch hitter. Abbott was granted free agency following the 2001 season and signed with Boston Red Sox affiliate Pawtucket in the International League. Here he platooned in the outfield, while hitting .283 with ten home runs and 41 RBI in 100 games. The following season, Abbott's last in professional baseball, was spent with the AAA Tacoma Rainers the Seattle Mariners farm team, but he appeared in only four games, getting only two hits in fifteen at bats."

        "text": "The East Atlantic Gymnastics League (EAGL) is a collegiate women's gymnastics conference competing at the NCAA Division I level. The league comprises eight universities.\nHistory.\nEAGL was formed on July 31, 1995, when eight universities on the East Coast of the United States: the University of Maryland, the University of New Hampshire, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina State University, the University of Pittsburgh, Rutgers University, Towson University, and West Virginia University joined to form a conference solely for women’s gymnastics. In August 1996, the EAGL officially became an affiliated member of the NCAA.\nGeorge Washington University joined the league in 2004. Towson, one of the original league members, left EAGL in 2005 to rejoin the Eastern College Athletic Conference. On February 3, 2012, the Atlantic Coast Conference announced that with the addition of Pittsburgh to the conference it would begin sponsoring a gymnastics championship, withdrawing the membership of the Maryland, North Carolina, North Carolina State, and Pittsburgh from the EAGL. However, Rutgers and Maryland both joined the Big Ten in 2014, a conference with an established gymnastics championship. West Virginia left the EAGL in 2012 upon joining the Big 12, a conference that also sponsored gymnastics. As such, not enough schools fielding gymnastics teams remained in the ACC for that conference to sponsor gymnastics so North Carolina, NC State, and Pitt remained in the EAGL. Towson rejoined the league in 2013. On March 5, 2020, Long Island University announced plans to add a women's gymnastics team for the 2020-21 school year and join the EAGL. On November 14, 2020, Temple University announced it would be leaving the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference to join the EAGL.\nOn June 17, 2021, the Atlantic Coast Conference announced that, with the addition of NCAA Gymnastics at Clemson University, the ACC would begin sponsoring the sport for the 2023-24 school year, which will move Pittsburgh, North Carolina State and North Carolina from the EAGL to the ACC starting with the 2024 season."

        "text": "Thomas Mark Bradley (born July 12, 1956) is an American football coach and former collegiate player. He most recently served as the defensive backs coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Before joining the Steelers, he was the defensive coordinator for the UCLA Bruins football team. Before arriving at UCLA Bradley served as the senior associate head coach of the West Virginia Mountaineers football team. He is best known for his four-decade association with Penn State Nittany Lions football as a player and coach. Bradley served as the interim head coach of Penn State following Joe Paterno's dismissal nine games into his 46th season as head coach and left the Penn State program in 2012. Bradley has participated in a remarkable 34 bowl games. He played in four as a player at Penn State, twenty-seven coaching at Penn State, one coaching at West Virginia, and two coaching at UCLA. \nBradley has been recognized for his defense's outstanding performances. He was named the Associated Press Defensive Coordinator of the Year in 2005 and was named Rivals.Com Defensive Coordinator of the Year in 2008.

He became a full-time assistant midway through the 1979 season. Over the next 20 years, he coached running backs, wide receivers, defensive backs, linebackers, and special teams. In 1999 Bradley was named defensive coordinator at Penn State.\nBradley was a highly successful recruiter in addition to his role defensively. He served as lead recruiter for Nittany Lions such as Shane Conlan, Lavar Arrington, Paul Posluszny, Sean Lee, Brandon Short, and Justin King. Bradley has coached many All-American and all Big Ten standouts including Lavar Arrington, Paul Posluszny, Dan Connor, Devon Still, Shane Conlan, and David Macklin. Bradley was a part of 31 Bowl Games at Penn State.\nThrough the years Bradley remained loyal to Penn State and Paterno, and it was widely rumored that Paterno was preparing him to be his successor. Bradley's feelings about coaching at Penn State or another school have been quoted, \"there's a lot of loyalty that has been built up over the years. There's a family atmosphere between the staff, the players, and the community. It's a place that means a lot to my family. I don't want to go be a head coach just to say I've been a head coach. That's never been part of it. If I find something better, I'll go. But I haven't found it. It's that simple.\"\nIn January 2011, Bradley was reported to have been interviewed as a candidate for the head coaching openings at the University of Pittsburgh, and Temple University, but Bradley ultimately remained on Penn State's staff for 2011. On November 9, 2011, Bradley was named Penn State's interim head coach after the university's board of trustees fired Paterno.

It also occasionally plays host to Great Britain's Davis Cup home ties, as Centre Court is reserved for the Grand Slam tournament, with the one exception of the 2012 Olympic Games.\nWith a capacity of 12,345, it replaced the original, now-demolished No. 1 Court, which had stood on the west side of Centre Court since 1924, with a spectator capacity of 7,328. The old court was replaced by the Millennium Building, the media centre and facilities for players, members, and officials.\nHistory.\nFormer No. 1 Court.\nThe original No. 1 Court was built in 1924 and was attached to the west side of Centre Court. Originally it had a capacity of about 3,250 (2,500 seats and approximately 750 standing) which was increased over the years to 7,328 It was smaller than the current No. 1 Court and was said to have had a unique, more intimate atmosphere, making it a favourite of many players.\nThe Wightman Cup, an annual team tennis competition for women contested between teams from the United States and Great Britain was held on Court No 1 from 1946 to 1972.\nThe old court was replaced in 1997 by the current No. 1 Court situated to the north of Centre Court in Aorangi Park. The old No. 1 Court was demolished because its capacity for spectators was too low. The site of the old court is now occupied by the Millennium Building, the media centre, and facilities for players, members, and officials.\nCurrent No. 1 Court.\nThe current No. 1 Court in Aorangi Park was built in 1997, with a spectator capacity of 11,432. It was opened on 23 June 1997 and as part of the opening ceremony a salver was presented to 10 former champions who had won at least three singles titles. The first match played on the new court was between Tim Henman and Daniel Nestor.\nRetractable roof.\nIn April 2013, the All England Club confirmed its intention to build a retractable roof over No. 1 Court. As well as a retractable roof, the seating capacity of the court was increased by approximately 1,000 to seat 12,345 people.\nThe roof was completed in time for the 2019 Championships, with it being unveiled at a celebratory event attended by legendary former players in May 2019. The roof was closed for the first time in a competitive match on 3 July 2019 when Coco Gauff played Magdaléna Rybáriková, the match being moved from an outside court. The roof was closed again on 4 July 2019 during the Men's Doubles first round match featuring Andy Murray and Pierre-Hugues Herbert.\nReferences.\nSources"

        "title": "Single wicket cricket",
        "text": "Single wicket cricket is a form of cricket played between two individuals, who take turns to bat and bowl against each other. The one bowling is assisted by a team of fielders, who remain as fielders at the change of innings. The winner is the one who scores more runs. There was considerable interest in single wicket during the middle part of the 18th century when it enjoyed top-class status. \nAlmost never seen professionally today, it is most often encountered in local cricket clubs, in which there are a number of knockout rounds leading to a final. The exact rules can vary according to local practice: for example, a player might be deducted runs for an out rather than ending his or her innings. An innings typically is limited to two or three overs. When single wicket was popular in the 18th century, however, there was no overs limitation, and a player's innings ended only on his dismissal.\nIn the BBC Radio 4 drama, The Archers, there is a regular Single Wicket competition.\nHistory.\nSingle wicket has known periods of huge success when it was more popular than the eleven-a-side version of cricket. This was especially so among gamblers at the Artillery Ground during the middle years of the 18th century. Star performers at the time included Robert Colchin, Stephen Dingate, Tom Faulkner and Thomas Waymark.\nIt was in a single-wicket match on 22–23 May 1775 that Surrey bowler Lumpy Stevens beat Hampshire batsman John Small three times with the ball going through the two stump wicket of the day. As a result of Stevens' protests, the patrons agreed that a third stump should be added.\nDespite this famous match, single wicket experienced a lull during the Hambledon Era and in the early years of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), but its popularity soared again in the first half of the 19th century, when leading players like Alfred Mynn and Nicholas Felix took part in some significant matches. From about 1800 to the 1820s, single wicket matches were popular but riddled with gambling-related match fixing.\nWith the rise of the All-England Eleven and a growing interest in county cricket, single wicket lapsed again and has rarely been seen at the highest level since 1850, despite a brief revival in the 1960s. A single wicket competition called the Courage International Batsman of the Year was held at The Oval over two days in September 1979. The event was won by Clive Lloyd, who beat David Gower in the final.\nThe 2020 Ultimate Kricket Challenge was a form of single wicket cricket, in which players competed in head-to-head matches. Runs were scored by hitting into zones; and each player was assisted by a wicket-keeper and one other fielder when they were bowling, as well as being allowed a substitute bowler for up to 7 balls in each 15 ball innings. The inaugural tournament was won by Rashid Khan, who defeated Andre Russell in the final.\nAlternative definition.\nIn an 1831 issue of \"New Sporting Magazine\", \"single wicket\" cricket was not a one-on-one competition, but was defined as cricket with fewer than five players per team. In this modified form, runs could only be scored by hitting the ball to an area forward of the wicket, halving the zone in which runs could be scored. Otherwise the rules were similar to ordinary cricket, which the publication referred to as \"double wicket\"."

The page count averages anywhere from 136–172 pages depending on the time of year and main topics of interest are the men's college and high school lacrosse. Also receiving coverage is Major League Lacrosse, the National Lacrosse League, and women's lacrosse.

Formerly known as \"NLL Insider\", it was started in 2005 as a spinoff to Inside Lacrosse so that Inside Lacrosse could focus on field lacrosse while IL Indoor would focus on box lacrosse. It features its own forums similar to The Lacrosse Forums. Some of the writers are former NLL players including Teddy Jenner, Brian Shanahan, Marty O'Neill, and Tom Ryan.\nIL Indoor Forums.\nIL Indoor also has its own distinct message board forum, IL Indoor Forums which focuses primarily on National Lacrosse League news and discussions. This message board began in 2000 and was originally known as the National Lacrosse League Message Board until Inside Lacrosse purchased and then renamed it. It is the premier website for fan-based NLL journalism and is the location for serious NLL fans, staffers, and players to share news, rumors, opinions, and ideas for improving both the sport of box lacrosse and the NLL. It also serves as a living repository of NLL history and as a resource for new NLL fans to learn about the league, its rules, and its history by searching past posts or interacting with long-time fans.\nHistory.\nThe company was founded in 1996 by Robert Carpenter, a Duke lacrosse and Vestal, NY High School graduate. Knowing that fans cannot be truly invested in a sport if they don't have access to the news and the personalities surrounding it, Inside Lacrosse was born. A ham and egg operation run out of Carpenter's spare bedroom in Towson, Maryland was all about printing and sending weekly score bulletins to lacrosse junkies nationally, in first-class envelopes so nothing was out of date. The maiden issue was a 16-page black-and-white newspaper consisting mostly of box scores and stats. Among the content was the news of Michigan State and New Hampshire dropping their men's varsity programs and Syracuse's epic 22–21 win over Virginia.\nIn 2007, American City Business Journals acquired the magazine from Carpenter Publishing LLC."
