        "title": "2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup",
        "text": "The 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was the eighth ICC Men's T20 World Cup tournament. It was played in Australia from 16 October to 13 November 2022. In the final, England beat Pakistan by five wickets to win their second ICC Men's T20 World Cup title and draw level with the West Indies, who also won 2 ICC Men's T20 World Cup titles in both the 2012 and the 2016 edition. Sam Curran was named the Player of the match and also the Player of the tournament.\nAlthough originally scheduled to be held in 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) postponed the tournament because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the re-arranged tournament held in Australia in 2022. The host nation were also the defending champions.\nThe host cities for matches were Adelaide, Brisbane, Geelong, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The semi-finals took place at the Sydney Cricket Ground where Pakistan beat New Zealand by seven wickets, and at the Adelaide Oval where England beat India by ten wickets.\nA series of global qualifying matches took place for the right to play in the group stages of the tournament, with the two best placed teams from the groups entering the Super 12 stage, to compete alongside eight pre-qualified nations.\nBackground.\nIn April 2018, the ICC announced that the tournament would replace the scheduled 2021 ICC Champions Trophy. This was after the ICC granted full international status to Twenty20 matches played between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards.\nIn October 2019, it was reported that the ICC could scrap the T20 World Cup Qualifier, which would have been used as a pathway for qualification to the T20 World Cup. Therefore, twelve teams from the 2020 ICC T20 World Cup and four teams from qualification events would advance to the T20 World Cup. On 23 January 2020, the ICC confirmed the full details of qualification for the tournament. In May 2020, the ICC told the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that they reserve the rights to take away hosting rights from India, after the BCCI did not secure a tax exemption from the Indian government for the tournament.\nIn July 2020, when the previous edition of the tournament was being reviewed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Earl Eddings, the chairman of Cricket Australia suggested that Australia could host that tournament in October 2021, and India stage this tournament a year later in 2022. The ICC also confirmed that either Australia or India, the hosts for the tournaments originally scheduled to take place in 2020 and 2021 respectively, would host this tournament.\nSeveral warm-up matches were played between 10 and 19 October 2022 between all participants. The first set of matches featured the teams from the groups in the first round of the main tournament, before the teams in the Super 12 phase played their warm-up matches. These matches did not have either T20I or T20 status as teams were allowed to field all 15 members of their squad.\nTeams and qualifications.\nThe twelve teams that reached the Super 12 phase of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup automatically qualified for the 2022 tournament. Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa all qualified directly for the Super 12 phase of this tournament, based on their performances in the 2021 tournament and their rankings as of 15 November 2021. Namibia, Scotland, Sri Lanka and the West Indies were all placed in the group stage of the competition.\nThe remaining four places came from the top two teams from each of the two Global Qualifiers. The Global Qualifiers had a total of sixteen teams; the bottom four teams from the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup (Ireland, Netherlands, Oman and Papua New Guinea), the next four highest ranked T20I sides (Zimbabwe, Nepal, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore), and the eight teams that progressed from the Regional Finals. From the Global Qualifier A tournament, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates progressed to the T20 World Cup. The United Arab Emirates won the Global Qualifier A to be placed in Group A of the T20 World Cup, with Ireland placed in Group B. From the Global Qualifier B tournament, the Netherlands and Zimbabwe became the final two teams to qualify for the T20 World Cup. Zimbabwe won the Global Qualifier B tournament to be placed in Group B of the T20 World Cup, with the Netherlands being placed in Group A.\nGlobal Qualifiers.\nThe Global Qualifiers comprised the four lowest-ranked teams from the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup, the four best-ranked teams not already qualified for the World Cup or qualifiers; and eight teams from Regional Qualifiers. On 24 March 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that all ICC qualifying events scheduled to take place before 30 June 2020 had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, the ICC updated the qualification pathway following the disruption from the pandemic.\nIn August 2021, the ICC confirmed that the EAP qualifier had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the Philippines advanced to the Global Qualifiers as the highest-ranked team in the EAP region. In October 2021, Group B of the Asia qualifier was also cancelled due to the pandemic, with Hong Kong progressing as the highest-ranked team. In the Regional Final of the European qualifier, Jersey won their first four matches to confirm their progression to the Global Qualifiers. Germany finished in second place, ahead of Italy on net run rate, to also advance from the European group. Bahrain won Group A of the Asia qualifier, finishing just ahead of Qatar on net run rate. In the Americas qualifier, the United States became the first team from that group to reach the Global Qualifiers, after they won their first five matches. They were joined by Canada, who finished in second position in the Americas qualifier group. Uganda claimed the final place in the Global Qualifiers, after winning the Regional Final of the Africa qualifier.\nMatch officials.\nOn 3 October 2022, the ICC named the match referees and the umpires for the group stage of the tournament. On 7 November 2022, the ICC confirmed the match referees and the umpires for the semi-finals, with the officials for the final being named after the semi-finals.\nMatch referees\nUmpires\nSquads.\nOn 1 September 2022, Australia were the first team to announce their squad for the tournament. All the teams announced their preliminary squads by 22 September 2022.\nVenues.\nOn 15 November 2021, the ICC confirmed the venues that would host matches across the tournament. The host cities were Adelaide, Brisbane, Geelong, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The semi-finals took place at the Sydney Cricket Ground and the Adelaide Oval, with the final taking place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nPrize money.\nOn 30 September 2022, the ICC announced the prize money for the tournament.\nWarm-up matches.\nThe following warm-up matches for the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup were played between 10 and 19 October between all participants. The first set of matches featured the teams from the groups in the first round of the main tournament, before the teams in the Super 12 phase played their warm-up matches. These matches did not have either Twenty20 International (T20I) status or T20 status as teams were allowed to field all 15 members of their squad.\nFirst round.\nOn 21 March 2022, ICC confirmed the fixtures for the first round.\nKnockout stage.\nFinal.\nPakistan were asked to bat first who then scored a total of 137 runs for the fall of 8 wickets. Shan Masood was Pakistan's top scorer with 38 runs. England's Sam Curran finished with the figures of 3 wickets for 12 runs.\nIn the second innings, England finished the six-over powerplay with 49 runs for 3 wickets.\nIn the 13th over, the game changed when Shaheen Shah Afridi slid forward to take a catch off Shadab Khan, dismissing Harry Brook. Shaheen jarred his right knee\nin the process. With England needing 41 runs off five overs, Shaheen attempted to return for his third over after receiving some treatment. But he pulled out of his run-up once, then sent one down to Moeen Ali at 114 kph. Iftikhar Ahmed then completed Shaheen's remaining over after he took off the field. With scores level after Ben Stokes had brought up his maiden T20I fifty, he scored the winning run with six balls to spare.\nStatistics.\n\"The top five (or all those tied for fifth) in each category are listed.\"\nTeam of the tournament.\nOn 14 November 2022, the ICC announced its team of the tournament with Sam Curran being named as player of the tournament, and Jos Buttler as the captain of the team."

        "title": "1900 Metropolitan Rugby Union season",
        "text": "The 1900 Metropolitan Rugby Union season was the 27th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. It was the first season run for clubs that represented a district. Eight clubs (seven representing a district, the remaining club representing Sydney University) competed from May till August 1900. The season culminated in the first district premiership, which was won by Glebe. Glebe were crowned premiers by virtue of finishing the season on top of the table. \nBackground.\nAs early as 1893 it had been suggested to change the current structure of the premiership to a district-based formula. The idea was that district teams would distribute the top players amongst more teams creating a more equal competition. This would encourage crowds at matches to grow in size. However, members of the union were reluctant and voted against the proposal. This was based upon the grounds that the current clubs had a strong supporter base that may be lost if their club was barred from the competition. As well, it was believed that crowd sizes were adequate and not in fear of falling. The idea of district competition continued to be discussed over the following seasons.\nAt a NSWRFU meeting in early August, 1896, a motion was proposed and carried concerning district football. The proposal recommended that the County of Cumberland (Sydney and surrounding suburbs) be separated into eight districts and that the Senior and First Junior matches be played between these clubs. The eight districts proposed were North Sydney, Redfern, Glebe, St. George, Balmain, Paddington, Western Suburbs and East Sydney. The proposal included the University club who would only include players who were undergraduates. Districts were arranged upon electorate lines. The NSWRFU rejected the proposal in a heated and passionate meeting with the votes 44 to 16. \nOn 26 September 1898, at a meeting of the Metropolitan Rugby Football Union, the following recommendation was proposed, \"That the football competition next season shall be competed for by clubs whose members are residents of such districts as may be allowed to each club.\" A ballot was taken and the recommendation won 22 to 12. A committee was set up to draw up a scheme to divide the Sydney region into eight districts, including Sydney University. However, the change was postponed to start in 1900 due to the eminent arrival of the English team and being able to adequately form a competitive team.\nIn 1900 a meeting of the Metropolitan Rugby Football Union was held and a recommendation to establish district football in the coming season was made. The motion was carried with a majority in favour. In response, existing clubs indicated their support for the new competition by either disbanding the current club or removing themselves from the senior competition. Meetings were held across the city over the coming months to form the various district clubs. \nTeams.\nEight clubs contested the season; seven clubs representing a district and one club representing Sydney University. The 'Varsity were allowed to continue in the Premiership with the restriction that all players were required to be either current or former students. Each of the district clubs were newly formed with the foundations in former clubs.\nSeason summary.\nThe 1900 Sydney Rugby Premiership and the move to a district-based structure was deemed a success. Greater public interest in football was seen with crowd attendances at games a positive. At the final round of the season, the top-of-the-table clash between Glebe and Sydney University at University Oval saw approximately 7,000 in attendance.\nThe winning club, Glebe, demonstrated more consistency during the season than the other clubs. After starting the season with four wins in the first seven rounds, they consistently developed their team until they were regarded as the finest team over the remaining seven rounds. They also benefitted from a very low injury toll to their players. Glebe won the two lower grade competitions to add to their first grade triumph.\nSydney University performed very well to become runners-up considering they had a terrible injury toll. This included their captain HD Wood whose career was ended due to his injuries. Their success was mostly due to players such as Harry Blaney and Frank Futter who scored nearly half of their tries.\nFor a greater part of the season, North Sydney were favourites for the premiership having only lost one game in the first ten rounds. However, when the club met Glebe in round eleven, they lost the game and three of their players were injured. The next round saw another injury to a player. North Sydney lost the last four remaining games (rounds 11 to 14) and with that the premiership.\nLower grades.\nThe MRFU also conducted Second Grade and Third Grade competitions for teams representing the district clubs. Glebe were victorious in both lower grade competitions and were thus declared club champions across all three grades. Overall, the club had only lost two games across all three grades, being undefeated in both lower grade competitions.\nSecond grade.\nAll of the clubs competing in the First Grade competition entered a team in Second Grade. Teams were: North Sydney, South Sydney, Eastern Suburbs, Western Suburbs, Newtown, Glebe, Balmain and Sydney university. At the conclusion of the season, Glebe finished the season undefeated at the top of the table and were declared Premiers.\nThird grade.\nThe same clubs competed in the Third Grade competition. Teams were: North Sydney, South Sydney, Eastern Suburbs, Western Suburbs, Newtown, Glebe, Balmain and Sydney University. At the conclusion of the season, Glebe again finished the season undefeated at the top of the table and were declared Premiers."

In 2006, the company Bouygues completed construction of the first Ice Palace. In 2011, the country had opened the second Ice Palace worth €134.4 million. The total area of the new sports palace is 107,000 square meters, and in its center is the ice arena measuring 60 by 30 meters.\nTurkmenistan became a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) on 15 May 2015. It has been a full member of the IIHF and was the third former Soviet republic from Central Asia after Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to join the IIHF.\nThe first national team was formed in 2011, comprising players from Ashgabat-based teams: Oguzkhan, Alp Arslan, Shir and Burgut. In 2013, the under-20 national team played its first game against Minsk City, which was won by 7–2. In 2016, Turkmenistan played its first game against Ashgabat, which was won by 12–2.\nIn 2017, Turkmenistan made its international debut at the 2017 Asian Winter Games in Sapporo, Japan. Turkmenistan played in Division II and their first official game against Malaysia, winning by 9–2, and later went on to win the division by defeating Kyrgyzstan, 7–3 in the final. Their third game against Iran, winning by 12–2, but their opposition was disqualified due to the number of Iranian players were deemed ineligible. Iran still played their scheduled game against Turkmenistan on 23 February 2017. However, the game was considered as an exhibition game and its results has no bearing in the standings of the tournament. In 2018, the under-20 national team was supposed to make their debut at the 2018 IIHF World Junior Championship Division III Qualification tournament, but they withdrew prior to the tournament starting.

        "text": "Ryan Shea McKenna (born February 14, 1997) is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2021. Listed at and , he bats and throws right-handed.\nEarly life.\nMcKenna was born on February 14, 1997, in Grants Pass, Oregon, to parents Marty and Marlene. His family moved to Berwick, Maine when he was young. His father coached him from tee-ball through his freshman year. While in the seventh grade, McKenna joined his older brother on their high school's varsity baseball team.\nAmateur career.\nMcKenna attended Portsmouth Christian Academy (PCA) in Dover, New Hampshire, as a freshman before transferring to St. Thomas Aquinas High School. Within his second week at St. Thomas, his coach received phone calls from colleges inquiring about his post-secondary aspirations. In his sophomore season, McKenna committed to attend Liberty University on a 40 percent college baseball scholarship after attending one of their summer training camps. He later stated that the majority of that decision rested on their Judeo-Christian values. He then gained national attention after batting .308 with five stolen bases in the Area Code Games and performing well during the East Coast Pro Showcase. During his junior year with the St. Thomas Saints, McKenna, batted .551 and drove in 31 runs. In his senior year, McKenna hit .452 with five extra-base hits despite missing five of his team's 16-regular-season games due to a strained hamstring. He returned to help the St. Thomas Saints in the Division II tournament before they were upset by 11th-seeded John Stark of Weare in the tournament's preliminary round.\nProfessional career.\nThe Baltimore Orioles selected McKenna in the fourth round of the 2015 MLB draft, making him the first New England high school player chosen in the draft. He subsequently signed with the Orioles and made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Orioles of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, playing in only ten games due to an ankle injury. In 2016, he played for the Aberdeen IronBirds of the Low-A New York-Penn League, and batted .241 in 62 games. He played for the Delmarva Shorebirds of the Single-A South Atlantic League in 2017 where he batted .256 with seven home runs and 42 RBIs in 126 games.\nMcKenna began the 2018 season with the Frederick Keys of the High-A Carolina League, and earned a midseason promotion to the Bowie Baysox of the Double-A Eastern League. After the 2018 season, he played for the Glendale Desert Dogs of the Arizona Fall League. He returned to Bowie to start the 2019 season. McKenna was added to the Orioles 40–man roster following the 2019 season. McKenna did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn April 5, 2021, McKenna was promoted to the major leagues for the first time to fill in for Austin Hays, who was dealing with a hamstring strain. He made his MLB debut that day as the starting right fielder against the New York Yankees. He collected his first major league hit on April 11, a triple off of Nick Pivetta of the Boston Red Sox. On July 25, McKenna collected his first career home run with a solo shot off of Washington Nationals starter Paolo Espino. He finished his rookie campaign playing in 90 games and batting .183/.292/.266 with 2 home runs and 14 RBI. In 2022, McKenna played in a career–high 104 games for the Orioles, used often as a defensive replacement late in games. In 156 at–bats, he hit .237/.294/.340 with 2 home runs and 11 RBI.\nOn April 1, 2023, in a game against the Boston Red Sox, McKenna dropped a Masataka Yoshida fly ball with 2 outs in the bottom of the 9th inning and the Orioles ahead by 1 run. Catching the ball would have ended the game and given the Orioles the win. Baltimore, leading 7–1 at one point, would lose the game after the next batter, Adam Duvall, hit a walk-off 2-run homerun two pitches later off of Félix Bautista. On June 24, McKenna entered a game against the Seattle Mariners in the ninth inning as a defensive replacement for Anthony Santander. In the bottom of the tenth, McKenna came up to bat in Santander's spot, and hit a two–run, walk–off home run off of Justin Topa to seal the comeback for Baltimore. In 88 games for the Orioles in 2023, he hit .254/.316/.361 with two home runs and 18 RBI.\nMcKenna was optioned to Triple–A Norfolk to begin the 2024 season. However, on March 28, 2024, McKenna was designated for assignment following multiple roster moves. He cleared waivers and was sent outright to Norfolk on March 31. On April 26, McKenna was called up to the Orioles, replacing the struggling Jackson Holliday, who was sent down to Triple–A Norfolk."

        "title": "100-ball cricket",
        "text": "100-ball cricket is a short form of cricket designed to attract new audiences to the game with simplified rules, which was originally created by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for its new city-based competition The Hundred. \nThe 100 ball game has two teams each having a single innings, which is restricted to a maximum of 100 balls, and the match lasts approximately two and a half hours, somewhat shorter than the existing Twenty20 format.\nBefore the launch of the professional The Hundred competition in July 2021, the 100-ball format was trialled in several amateur local leagues across England.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe new 100-ball format was born out of a proposal by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2016 to launch a new franchise cricket competition, similar to the Indian Premier League. At first it was expected that the competition would use the existing Twenty20 format.\nFollowing discussions involving the ECB's marketing team, clubs were instead told in April 2018 that the competition would use an entirely new form of cricket designed to be simpler to follow and shorter to fit television schedules. The more detailed proposal was presented by the ECB to the chair and chief executives of the first-class counties and the MCC on 19 April 2018, and was unanimously supported by the board of the new competition. At first it was proposed that each innings would involve 15 six-ball overs and a final 10-ball over.\nIn February 2019, the ECB announced tweaks to the proposed rules of 100-ball cricket. The competition will instead contain 10 ten-ball overs, i.e. a change of ends after ten balls. A bowler will be delivering five or 10 consecutive balls. A bowler would deliver a maximum of 20 balls per innings. Power-play conditions were also announced.\nAmateur competitions.\nTrial events using the format have taken place at The Purchasers annual cricket festival at Belmont House in Kent, and club level in England.\nIn November 2018, the Warwickshire Cricket Board and Warwickshire County Cricket Club launched the 100-ball format club level tournament, which is designed to revitalise Sunday cricket at clubs across the Midlands. Called the Warwickshire Sunday Smash, the 16 team tournament is split into three divisions, with each side playing each team both home and away, throughout June and July. The teams include Solihull Blossomfield Cricket Club, Knowle &amp; Dorridge, Sutton Coldfield, Bedworth, Alcester &amp; Ragley, Stratford upon Avon, Water Orton, Four Oaks Saints, Moseley Ashfield and Aston Manor, who are all members of the Midlands Club Cricket Conference. The winners of each league and the best second place progressing to the Semi-Finals Day. The Finals Day took place on 1 September 2019 at Edgbaston. Stratford Upon Avon beat Knowle &amp; Dorridge to win the first 100 ball competition in the U.K.\nShropshire County Cricket Club introduced the Swancote Energy Smash, which began in June 2019. It is a six-team tournament that has been divided into two groups, with games being played every Thursday night. The winners of each group is due to play in the inaugural final in early September 2019. The six teams are Shifnal, Claverley, Worfield, Bridgnorth, Chelmarsh and Wombourne.\nIn May 2021 Shropshire Cricket league launched two 100-ball knock out competitions, known as the Aaron's 100 and Aaron's Premier 100, involving 53 teams from across Shropshire and mid-Wales.\nCricket Wales launched the Cricket Wales U19’s 100 Ball Cup for under 19 year olds. It started on 25 June 2021 and is due to end with the final on 13 August 2021 at Ynystawe Cricket Club.\nThe Cricket Paper National Girls U18 100 Ball Cup was established by Shrewsbury School. Originally known as the Shrewsbury School Girls U18 T20 in 2019, it is now a 100-ball cricket competition.\nProfessional competition.\nThe first professional competition using the 100-ball format was The Hundred in July 2021. The Hundred involves eight men's and women's teams across England and Wales. The first professional match using the new format involved the women's teams of the Oval Invincibles and Manchester Originals who played each other at The Oval in London on 21 July 2021.\nThe Africa Cricket Association plans to hold an annual 100-ball competition to further boost the game within the continent.\nFormat.\n100-ball cricket is a form of limited overs cricket, played by two teams each playing a single innings made up of 100 balls.\nThe format of the game is:\nReactions.\nEnglish journalist George Dobell wrote in 2018 that proposals for the new format outlined by the ECB were nothing more than a further step towards \"fast-food cricket\", whereas others support the proposals.\nEngland's then Test captain, Joe Root, welcomed the ECB's plans for its new-team format in 2020. According to Root, it will attract a completely new audience. ODI and T20 captain, Eoin Morgan, had a similar opinion about this format. Former T20 captain Stuart Broad said he was hugely optimistic about the new format. Michael Vaughan also echoed with Broad and stated that it will be a more appealing concept to broadcasters. Michael Atherton shared that a T20 match was to be completed in a 3-hour window and this can be achieved with the proposed format.\nNew Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham was bemused on this move, asking why the England and Wales Cricket Board is trying something different when the current format is already so successful. Current limited overs specialists Dawid Malan and Mark Wood shared that in spite of the new format, T20s will still remain as the preference.\nFormer MCC chief Keith Bradshaw called the 100-ball tournament an innovation for innovation's sake, reasoning that the main reason behind this thought process is that the ECB couldn't exploit the T20 boom. The England and Wales Professional Cricketers' Association shared that, overall, players were open to this new idea.\nMeanwhile, Cricket Australia has no plans to tinker with its existing Big Bash League. It also shared a concern that the introduction of shorter formats is further ignoring Test cricket."

The match was contested by IFK Kristianstad and Alingsås HK. Kristianstad won the match by 31–25 to win their third consecutive Swedish title.\nBackground.\nKristianstad entered the match as two-time defending champions, having won the titles in 2015 and 2016. Kristianstad had won the regular season, whereas Alingsås had finished fifth. Both regular season matches between the teams had finished with home wins, with Alingsås winning by 30–24 and Kristianstad by 25–16. The teams had previously faced each other in the quarter-finals in 2012 and 2013 and in the final in 2015 and 2016, with Kristianstad winning each time. It was the fifth time that Malmö Arena hosted the final, following 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016.\nRoad to the final.\nKristianstad defeated Eskilstuna Guif by 3–0 in the quarter-final series and Ystads IF by 3–1 in the semi-finals. Alingsås won both the quarter-finals against HK Malmö and the semi-finals against IK Sävehof by 3–1.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nKristianstad started the match strongly and led by 4–0 after nine minutes. The teams followed each other to 8–4, but Kristianstad extended the lead to 16–7 and led by 18–11 at half-time. Alingsås played better at the start of the second half and reduced the deficit to 22–19. However, after that they went eight minutes without a goal and Kristianstad extended the lead to 26-20. Kristianstad held on to the lead and won by 31–25. Kristianstad's Jerry Tollbring was the top scorer of the match at 10 goals. Andreas Flodman scored the most goals for Alingsås, 9.\nReactions.\nKristianstad player Albin Lagergren praised teammate Jerry Tollbring, saying that \"we just had to give the ball to Jerry and it was a goal, he did whatever he wanted to.\" According to Kristianstad captain Ólafur Guðmundsson his team's strong start to the match was decisive. Kristianstad goalkeeper Nebojša Simić praised his team's fans after the match saying that \"they are like wings on your back\". Alingsås coach Mikael Franzén said after the match: \"the uphill slope is too steep from the start against such a good team as Kristianstad. I can't say anymore than that it is fair, they push us down and don't give us the chance.\" He highlighted his team's inability to best Simić as a reason for the loss, saying \"[Simić] is good today, but not impossible. He makes some saves that are important, but naturally if we had got the better of him earlier you never know.\" Alingsås player Max Darj said \"we did a lot of things that we certainly shouldn't do. (...) We have been here before, we should have learned our lesson\"."

        "text": "The 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia at 3:30 (BST), about a half hour before the opening match which Russia won 5–0 over Saudi Arabia.\nMascots.\nZabivaka (English: \"The one who scores\"), was the official mascot for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and was voted for by a 53% margin. The design is of a wolf who represents fun, charm, and character. Former world cup winning, Brazilian striker Ronaldo was another mascot of the tournament. Ronaldo was the intended man to deliver the ceremonial first kick of the tournament but instead, he gave that honor to the child mascot who passed the official match ball to Zabivaka in order to start the tournament. The match ball (an Adidas Telstar 18) was sent into space with the International Space Station crew in March and came back to Earth in early June.\nSpeeches.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin gave the opening speech of the tournament in which he talked about an \"open, hospitable and friendly\" Russia hosting the tournament. He also described Russia's love for football, calling the tournament and the game \"a unity which cannot be affected by a different language, ideology or faith\". Putin ended by saying:\nPutin's speech was immediately followed by a short speech from FIFA President Gianni Infantino who said:\nFollowing the two speeches the performance of the ceremony were allowed to commence before the opening match between Russia and Saudi Arabia.\nPerformances.\nBritish pop singer Robbie Williams took centre stage at the end of the ceremony with a rendition of \"Let Me Entertain You\" before Russian soprano Aida Garifullina was carried out on to the pitch on the back of a \"firebird\" float. Williams sang a section of \"Feel\" before he and Garifullina performed a duet of \"Angels\" as performers emerged, dressed in the flags of all 32 teams and carrying a sign bearing the name of each nation. Williams then sang \"Rock DJ\" in an encore as the pitch was being cleared for the first match.\nControversy.\nDuring the encore, Williams gave the middle finger. Fox in the US apologised for the incident. The incident was not shown on ITV in the UK who had cut away prior to the encore. In addition, while singing Rock DJ, Williams sung, \"Pimpin' ain't easy. Most of them fleece me, but I did this for free.\" The lyrics \"But I did this for free\" replaced the lyrics \"Every night\".\nWilliams appeared on \"This Morning\" on 19 June and explained what happened, “It was one minute to kick off, I was under a lot of pressure, because there was one minute left and I didn't know how I was going to do half a minute, so I just did a one-minute countdown [using his middle finger].” Asked by presenter Phillip Schofield whether he regrets it, he said: \"Yeah, of course, yeah. I cannot trust me. And the last thing I said to my manager before we sat down on the sofa here was, 'what could go wrong,' because I don't know what I'm going to do at any time. There's no, sort of, plan. The plan was, sing in key, don't fall over. That was the plan and 99% of the plan, I pulled off.” When asked did the idea just enter his head he responded, “Nothing actually pops into my head. There's a block between me and sense... then something happens and then five minutes later, I'm like, 'Did I? Yeah, I did, didn't I?”. Williams changing his lyrics \"every night\" is still unexplained.\nDignitaries in attendance.\nA total of 21 foreign heads of state attended this match. It was the largest gathering of leaders for a FIFA World Cup match."

        "text": "Industry Hills Golf Club at Pacific Palms (commonly referred to as Industry Hills), is a golf club located in the City of Industry, California. It is made up of two 18-hole courses known as The Ike and The Babe. It is the location of PGA, LPGA, and Champions Tour qualifiers and hosted the 2011 Kia Classic.\nHistory.\nIndustry Hills was founded by Bill Bryant and designed by William P. Bell in 1979 and 1980. and built on top of a former landfill site. It is two 18-hole courses, one named after President Dwight D. Eisenhower (The Ike) and the other after Babe Zaharias (the Babe). The Eisenhower course opened in November 1979, and when built had eight lakes and 108 sand traps. The Zaharias course opened the following year with 52 sand traps. It is a shorter but narrower course than Eisenhower. \nThe course was built with a trolley-like funicular to transport golfers and carts up a steep hill at the finish of the 36th hole. The trolley runs to a snack bar that at one time held the rail car that carried the body of Winston Churchill at his funeral (the car was returned to Britain in 2007). The club also housed a golf library which was the only public golf library in the west, and only one of two in the United States.\nThe California Open moved to Industry Hills in 1980. The club also hosted the Olympia Gold Classic in both 1981 and 1982. The tournament stopped playing at the club after players complained about the length, the hills, and the rough. \nThe club was purchased by John Semcken and Ed Roski Jr. of Majestic Realty Co. in 2000. After the purchase, they undertook at $25 million renovation. \nIn 2011, the Kia Classic was moved to Industry Hills due to renovations taking place at La Costa Resort and Spa. The tournament used a combination of holes from both the Eisenhower and Zaharias courses, eliminating the long hills on some holes. \nIndustry Hills has also held the Monday qualifier for the Genesis Open.\nMovies and television.\nIndustry Hills has been used as a filming location for television and movies due to its close proximity to Hollywood.

        "text": "David Owen Fletcher (born May 31, 1994) is an American professional baseball infielder in the Atlanta Braves organization. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Angels.\nFletcher was born in Orange, California, and attended Cypress High School in Cypress, California. After four varsity seasons with Cypress, Fletcher played two seasons of college baseball for Loyola Marymount University. He was drafted by the Angels in the sixth round of the 2015 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut in 2018 and served as a utility player for his first three seasons before becoming a more permanent middle infielder in 2021.\nConsidered a contact hitter, Fletcher frequently served as the leadoff batter in front of Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani with the Angels. He is known for his soft-contact bloop hits and frequent contact, resulting in a low amount of walks and strikeouts. In his first three full seasons with the Angels, Fletcher led the team in hits. His 26-game hitting streak in 2021 was the longest in MLB that year and the second-longest in Angels history, behind Garret Anderson's 28.\nEarly life.\nDavid Owen Fletcher was born on May 31, 1994, in Orange, California. He is the son of Tim Fletcher, a former college football player for Saddleback College, construction worker, and army veteran, and Fernanda Fletcher, a professional dancer. Fletcher showed interest in baseball from a young age, playing soft toss at age four with Angels infielder Gary DiSarcina at a fan appreciation event. At age 13, Fletcher first trained with Stan Grebeck, a baseball coach and brother of former major leaguer Craig Grebeck. Grebeck took note of Fletcher's quick release on defense and predicted that he would eventually play in the major leagues. Fletcher continued to work with Grebeck, evolving his swing and training to hit high fastballs.\nFletcher attended Cypress High School in Cypress, California. He finished his sophomore season batting .317 with 15 runs batted in (RBIs). In his junior season, Fletcher was named by \"The Orange County Register\" as a top high school athlete in the county to watch in 2012, alongside Tyler Mahle. Through early April, he was batting .429 as Cypress's leadoff hitter with 10 stolen bases in 13 attempts. Fletcher finished his junior season batting .422 with a team-best 46 hits and only one strikeout in 119 plate appearances. Fletcher was selected to the \"Register's\" all-county second team, sharing honors with James Kaprielian, Jacob Nix, Tyler Mahle, and Ryan McMahon. In 2013, his senior year, Fletcher batted .437, aiding Cypress in winning the CIF Southern Section (CIF-SS) Division 2 championship. Following the season, he was named to the \"Register's\" all-county first team, the \"Los Angeles Times\" High School All-Star baseball team, and was named the CIF-SS Division 2 MVP.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from high school in 2013, Fletcher enrolled at Loyola Marymount University (LMU) and became a member of the LMU Lions baseball team of the West Coast Conference (WCC), beginning in the 2014 season. Fletcher chose to attend LMU over UC Irvine and UCLA. Prior to his first season with the Lions, he made his collegiate summer baseball debut with the Alaska Goldpanners of the Alaska Baseball League. In 35 games with the Goldpanners, Fletcher batted .246 with 15 RBIs and 20 stolen bases in 25 attempts.\nIn 2014, Fletcher's freshman year, he batted .329 with 28 RBIs and 17 stolen bases (21 attempts) in 56 games. After the season, he was honored by Baseball America and the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA) with freshman All-American team selections. Fletcher was also named to the All-WCC first team and was named the WCC Defensive Player of the Year. In the summer of 2014, Fletcher played with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), joining Bobby Dalbec, Jake Cronenworth, and Taylor Ward on the roster. In 41 games with Orleans, Fletcher batted .299 with 17 RBIs and seven stolen bases (eight attempts). He was named a CCBL All-Star.\nIn 2015, as a sophomore, Fletcher batted .308 with two home runs, 27 RBIs, and 14 stolen bases (17 attempts) in 55 games. He was named to the All-WCC first team for the second consecutive season and was selected as LMU's Male Athlete of the Year. While at LMU, Fletcher was majoring in psychology.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nFletcher was drafted by the Los Angeles Angels in the sixth round of the 2015 Major League Baseball draft, the 195th overall pick. Fletcher was one of six players from LMU taken in the 2015 draft and the earliest selection among the group. Fletcher had two years of collegiate eligibility remaining but ultimately signed with the Angels for a $406,900 bonus, a $178,800 over-slot signing.\nOn June 16, 2015, Fletcher was assigned to the Rookie Advanced-level Orem Owlz of the Pioneer League. He made his professional baseball debut on June 18, starting at shortstop and going 1-for-3 with an RBI and a walk against the Ogden Raptors. In his first 10 games, Fletcher went 16-for-46 (.348) with 11 RBIs and four stolen bases. In 34 games with Orem, Fletcher batted .336 with 27 RBIs and 11 stolen bases (14 attempts). On July 28, he was promoted to the Single-A Burlington Bees of the Midwest League. On August 26, Fletcher hit his first professional home run, a solo shot off Wisconsin Timber Rattlers starter David Burkhalter. In 32 games with Burlington, Fletcher batted .283 with a home run, 10 RBIs, and six stolen bases (seven attempts). Fletcher was sent back to Orem on September 5, spending his final three games of the season with the Owlz.\nIn 2016, Fletcher partook in his first spring training as a non-roster invitee and went 5-for-8 (.625) in 8 games. He began the minor league season with the Class A-Advanced Inland Empire 66ers of the California League. In his first 20 games with Inland Empire, he batted .169 with four RBIs and eight stolen bases on eight attempts. On May 2, Fletcher was sidelined with tendinitis in his left hand and was placed on the temporary inactive list. Although manager Chad Tracy stated his hope that Fletcher would return after a few days, he would not be activated until June 11. After his return, Fletcher spent most of the season with Inland Empire, batting .275 with three home runs, 31 RBI, and 15 stolen bases (16 attempts) in a total of 78 games. On August 16, he was promoted to the Double-A Arkansas Travelers of the Texas League. In 20 games with Arkansas, Fletcher batted .300 with six RBIs and a stolen base. Following the season, he played for the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League, going 11-for-41 (.268) with four RBIs and a pair of stolen bases in 10 games.\nFletcher was again a non-roster invitee to spring training in 2017 and later began the season with the Mobile BayBears of the Southern League, the new Angels Double-A affiliate. On April 11, he was placed on the 7-day disabled list and was reactivated on May 8. In 64 games with Mobile, Fletcher batted .276 with a home run, 22 RBIs, and 12 stolen bases (17 attempts). On July 15, he was promoted to the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees of the Pacific Coast League. In 47 games with Salt Lake, Fletcher batted .254 with two home runs, 17 RBIs, and eight stolen bases (nine attempts).\nIn 2018, Fletcher was a non-roster invitee to spring training camp for the third consecutive season. He began the season with the Salt Lake Bees. In 58 games with Salt Lake, Fletcher batted .350 with six home runs, 37 RBIs, and seven stolen bases (eight attempts).\nLos Angeles Angels.\n2018–2020: Utility role.\nThe Angels promoted Fletcher to the major leagues on June 12, 2018. He made his MLB debut on June 13, hitting a two-run triple off Seattle Mariners starter Marco Gonzales for his first major league hit and his first two RBIs. He later singled off relievers Mike Morin and Roenis Elías to finish his first game at 3-for-4 with two RBIs and five total bases. On July 12, Fletcher went 2-for-5 and hit his first major league home run, a leadoff home run against Mariners starter James Paxton on the second pitch he saw. In his first major league season, Fletcher played at second base, shortstop, third base, and right field. He batted .275 with a home run and 25 RBIs in 80 games.\nIn 2019, Fletcher made the Angels' Opening Day roster as an infielder. Early in April, he began to see playing time in left field due to an injury to Kole Calhoun and the subsequent move of Brian Goodwin to right field. By May, Fletcher continued to play in left field due to Justin Upton's extended turf toe injury absence. Angels manager Brad Ausmus stated his confidence in Fletcher's outfield abilities, saying he no longer viewed him as an \"infielder playing the outfield\". From May 21 to June 3, Fletcher composed a 13-game hitting streak, a span in which he went 22-for-53 (.415) with a home run and six RBIs. Fletcher finished the season batting .290 with six home runs, 49 RBIs, eight stolen bases (11 attempts), and a team-leading 173 hits in 154 games. He was driven in by Mike Trout 15 times, Shohei Ohtani 12 times, and Albert Pujols 12 times. Out of all major leaguers, he swung at the lowest percentage of pitches inside the strike zone (48.7%) and made contact with the highest percentage of pitches he swung at (91.1%), the highest percentage of pitches he swung at in the strike zone (96.1%), as well as the highest percentage of pitches he swung at outside the strike zone (82.6%).\nIn 2020, Fletcher began the season filling in for an injured Anthony Rendon at third base. Upon Rendon's return, Fletcher moved to shortstop to fill in for Andrelton Simmons, who was also recovering from an injury. Angels manager Joe Maddon stated that Fletcher would remain an everyday player once Simmons returned, either as a platoon at second base with Tommy La Stella or as a corner outfielder. When La Stella was traded on August 28, Fletcher became the team's primary second baseman. Fletcher finished the COVID-19-shortened season batting a team-leading .319 with three home runs and 18 RBIs in 49 games. He led the Angels in hits for the second consecutive season with 66. He received a single voting point for the American League MVP award, placing him in a tie for 17th in the final voting results.\n2021–2022: Time in the middle infield.\nOn April 1, 2021, just hours before the Angels' Opening Day game against the Chicago White Sox, it was announced that Fletcher signed a five-year, $26 million extension with the team. The deal included two club options that could extend the contract to seven years and $41 million in value. Upon signing the extension, Fletcher stated that he would like to play his entire career with the Angels. From June 13 to July 17, Fletcher compiled a 26-game hitting streak, including four-hit performances on June 14, July 6, and July 11. The streak ended on July 18 when he went 0-for-5 in a 7–4 loss to the Seattle Mariners. The streak was the longest in the majors for the 2021 season and was the second-longest in Angels history, surpassing Rod Carew's 25-game streak from 1982 but falling short of Garret Anderson's 28-game streak from 1998. Fletcher struggled near the end of the season, batting .161 with a .400 on-base plus slugging (OPS) in the final 51 games of the year. He finished the season batting .262 with two home runs, 47 RBIs, and 15 stolen bases (18 attempts) in 157 games. He had the highest percentage of softly hit balls of all major leaguers at 23.2%, the lowest percentage of hard-hit balls at 17.3%, and had the most infield hits in the major leagues with 28. He also took fewer pitches per plate appearance than any other MLB batter at 3.33.\nIn the first week of the 2022 season, Fletcher went 1-for-13 (.077) with an RBI. On April 12, he was placed on the 10-day injured list due to a left hip strain that originated during spring training and failed to fully heal before the start of the regular season. Fletcher met with a specialist in Philadelphia and received cortisone injections in an attempt to heal the injury without surgery. He returned on April 29 but continued to struggle at the plate, posting a season .158 batting average through May 7. On May 8, Fletcher was placed on the 15-day injured list as his hip injury had failed to heal. Fletcher returned to Philadelphia for evaluation and it was determined he would need surgery. He underwent the surgery on May 10 with a recovery timetable of approximately two months and an expectation that he would return before the end of the season. Fletcher returned to the Angels lineup on July 28, going 1-for-3 with a double in his first game back. In his first 15 games since returning from the surgery, he went 19-for-53 (.359) with two home runs and 10 RBIs. On September 10, Fletcher exited a game against the Houston Astros after receiving a contusion on his right hand. X-rays showed no bone breakage and he was considered day-to-day. On September 17, Fletcher was placed on the 10-day injured list. He returned to the Angels lineup on September 29, going 1-for-4 against the Oakland Athletics. Fletcher finished the season batting .255 with two home runs and 17 RBIs in 61 games.\n2023.\nFletcher began the 2023 season with the Angels but went 2-for-16 (.125) in limited playing time. He was optioned to the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees on April 15, 2023, following the promotion of Zach Neto. On April 17, Fletcher was removed from the 40-man roster and sent outright to Salt Lake. After 43 games for Salt Lake, his contract was selected back to the major league roster on June 24. In 11 more games, Fletcher hit .258 with one home run and seven RBIs. On July 14, he was again removed from the 40-man roster and outrighted to Triple–A Salt Lake. On September 14, Fletcher was again selected to the major league roster.\nAtlanta Braves.\nOn December 8, 2023, the Angels traded Fletcher and catcher Max Stassi to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for minor leaguers Evan White and Tyler Thomas. The Braves outrighted him to the Triple–A Gwinnett Stripers on December 13. Fletcher was added to the major league roster on April 16, 2024, following an injury to Ozzie Albies. In five games for the club, he went 2–for–8 (.250) with no home runs and two RBIs. On April 25, Fletcher was removed from the 40–man roster and sent outright to Triple–A Gwinnett.\nInternational career.\nOn August 31, Italy national baseball team manager Mike Piazza announced that Fletcher would join the roster for the 2023 World Baseball Classic. He joined Trey Mancini and Jordan Romano in a group of major leaguers committing to represent Italy for the competition. He was later joined by his brother, Dominic, marking the first time the two played on the same team since high school. Although an American citizen, Fletcher was eligible to play for the team because his mother was born in Italy. In 5 games, Fletcher went 4-for-20 (.200) as Italy was eliminated in the quarterfinals by the Japan national baseball team.\nPlayer profile.\nAt 5 ft 9 and 185 lbs (1.75 m, 85 kg), Fletcher is below average height for an MLB player. He is regarded as a contact hitter that accrues many of his hits from low-exit velocity bloop hits. Similar to Angels Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero, Fletcher is known for making contact with pitches outside of the strike zone, including an instance in 2020 where he hit a pitch above his head for a double. Fletcher posted the third-lowest average exit velocity in MLB in both 2019 and 2021 at 83.8 and 82.3 miles per hour (134.9 and 132.4 kilometers per hour) respectively.\nFletcher began his major league career as a utility player, having played at every defensive position except catcher, first base, and center fielder through his first three seasons with the Angels. When two of the Angels' catchers were placed on the injured list in 2019, Fletcher was named as the team's emergency catcher and worked with catching coach José Molina in preparation for the temporary role. With the trade of Tommy La Stella in the 2020 season, Fletcher was moved from the utility role and became the team's starting second baseman in 2021 and the starting shortstop in 2022.\nFletcher is acclaimed by fans and baseball media alike for his defensive abilities in the middle infield. Between his debut in June 2018 and April 2022, Fletcher posted a total of 41 Defensive Runs Saved, the 15th-most in MLB and the most on the Angels.\nFletcher has been considered an underrated player on a national scale, with \"Sports Illustrated\" labeling him \"baseball's most anonymous talent\". Due to his short stature, contact-hitting approach, and defensive abilities, Fletcher has been compared to former Angels middle infielder David Eckstein, a player that he idolized while growing up not far from Angel Stadium.\nFletcher has received endorsement deals from Budweiser, Bank of America, and New Balance.\nPersonal life.\nFletcher's younger brother, Dominic, is an outfielder in the major leagues. The two were teammates at Cypress High School in 2013 when David was a senior and Dominic was a freshman. The two played together for the first time professionally for the Italy national baseball team during the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\nFletcher and his wife, Kierra, married in January 2019 and reside in Orange County, California."

He played college football at Indiana, and was selected by the Panthers in the fourth round of the 2018 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nThomas's mother Martha died due to liver and kidney failure before Thomas was nine. His father died a year later due to a heart attack.\nCollege career.\nThomas graduated from Nassau Community College in 2016, and joined Indiana for his junior year. Thomas played all 13 games during his first year at Indiana, acting as a blocking tight end and recording only three catches. During his senior year, after a game against Georgia Southern, in which he had a 71-yard touchdown, Thomas was named the Mackey Award Tight End of the Week. As a senior, Thomas had 25 receptions for 376 yards and five touchdowns.\nFollowing his senior season at Indiana, Thomas was invited to the 2018 Senior Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nOn November 21, 2017, it was reported that Thomas has accepted his invitation to play in the 2018 Senior Bowl. Thomas helped his draft stock by impressing scouts during Senior Bowl practices. On January 27, 2018, Thomas played in the Reese's Senior Bowl and was part of Houston Texans' head coach Bill O'Brien's South team that defeated the North 45–16. He participated at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis and performed the majority of combine drills, but opted to skip the bench press due to a pre-existing shoulder injury.\nOn April 3, 2018, Thomas attended Indiana's pro day, but chose to stand on his combine numbers and only ran positional drills. He also attended private meetings and workouts with the Atlanta Falcons and Jacksonville Jaguars. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, his draft projections by NFL draft experts and scouts varied from as early as the second round to as late as the seventh round. The majority of experts projected him to be drafted in the second or third round. Thomas was also ranked as the fifth best tight end prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com and CBS Sports and was ranked the sixth best tight end by Scouts Inc.\nThe Carolina Panthers selected Thomas in the fourth round with the 101st overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. He was the sixth tight end drafted in 2018.\nOn May 10, 2018, the Panthers signed Thomas to a four-year, $3.20 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $747,994. He made his NFL debut in the season opener against the Dallas Cowboys. In the 16–8 victory, he had four receiving yards on his first two career receptions. In Week 16 against the Atlanta Falcons, he scored his first professional touchdown on a one-yard reception from quarterback Taylor Heinicke. In his rookie season, he appeared in all 16 games and started six of them. He totaled 36 receptions for 333 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns.\nIn the 2019 season, Thomas appeared in all 16 games, of which he started three. He totaled 16 receptions for 136 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown.\nOn February 25, 2022, Thomas signed a three-year, $16.5 million contract extension with the Panthers.\nOn October 14, 2023, Thomas was placed on injured reserve with a calf injury. He was activated on November 18.\nPersonal life.\nOn February 28, 2022, it was announced that Thomas would be facing five misdemeanor charges: reckless driving, operation of a vehicle that is not insured, attempt to flee/elude arrest, failure to heed light or siren, and driving with a revoked license. The charges stemmed from an incident in which Thomas and an unidentified driver of a red ATV were pulled over for not having license plates after which Thomas left the scene before being stopped and arrested."

Numerous golfers have been penalized at, or disqualified from, televised tournaments after a rules infringement which was not spotted by players or a referee at the time but was later noticed by a member of the public and communicated to tournament officials by phone, tweet or email. If a player has already signed their scorecard by the time such an infringement is discovered, disqualification is frequently the outcome. In April 2011, the USGA and The R&amp;A announced a rule change which would allow players to avoid disqualification if a rules infringement was discovered after they had signed their scorecard. In December 2017, the same bodies announced a local rule change which would greatly limit the number of such incidents from 1 January 2018."

        "title": "2021 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 2021 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 91st Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The game was hosted by the Colorado Rockies and played at Coors Field on July 13, with the American League (AL) defeating the National League (NL) 5–2. It was the eighth consecutive All-Star Game victory for the AL.\nThe game was originally to be hosted in Atlanta at Truist Park. However, following the Georgia State Legislature's passage of the Election Integrity Act of 2021, the game was moved to Coors Field in Denver. The All-Star Game was the second to be played in Denver after the 1998 game.\nKevin Cash of the Tampa Bay Rays managed the AL and Dave Roberts of the defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers managed the NL. For the first time in All-Star Game history, Los Angeles Angels player Shohei Ohtani served as the starting pitcher and lead-off batter. The matchup also featured the 200th home run of the All-Star Game, which was hit by Toronto Blue Jays player Vladimir Guerrero Jr.\nBackground.\nHost selection.\nOriginal selection of Atlanta.\nAtlanta was originally awarded the game on May 30, 2019; it was to be the first All-Star Game hosted by Truist Park and the third All-Star Game played in Atlanta after the 1972 and 2000 editions.\nGeorgia voting law and relocation to Denver.\nIn March 2021, there were calls for the All-Star Game to be moved from Atlanta, in protest of the Georgia State Legislature's passage of the Election Integrity Act of 2021. The bill contains various provisions that impact how elections are conducted in the state; some of these provisions have been considered by many on the political left to have a disproportionate impact on certain communities, such as African Americans and Hispanic Americans, MLBPA executive director Tony Clark stated that he was \"very much aware\" of the issue, and that he was willing to discuss the matter with Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred. A sizeable portion of the player base and fan base are Hispanic and that had factored into the relocation threat.\nIn an interview with ESPN's Sage Steele on March 31, President Joe Biden stated that he would \"strongly support\" moving the game out of Georgia, saying that Republican efforts to make voting laws more restrictive following the 2020 presidential election was \"Jim Crow on steroids\". On April 1, Manfred stated that he was \"talking to various constituencies within the game and I'm just not going beyond that in terms of what I would consider or not consider.\" In an April 1 interview with Fox News, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp criticized the efforts, calling them \"ridiculous\".\nOn April 2, MLB announced that the game and the 2021 MLB Draft (which was added to the All-Star festivities this year) would be moved from Georgia, and that the game would be relocated to a different city in another state, to be determined. Commissioner Manfred stated that \"Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box.\" Governor Kemp later responded by saying that he would not back down over his decision, claiming that MLB caved to \"fear, political opportunism, and liberal lies.\" Kemp also claimed that the move was an example of cancel culture. In a statement shared on Truth Social, former President Donald Trump also criticized the decision, calling for a boycott of MLB. Texas Governor Greg Abbott cancelled a planned appearance at the Texas Rangers' home opener, where he had been scheduled to throw out the first pitch, in protest of the decision to move the game. In a letter to the Rangers stating his decision, Abbott also wrote that he would not participate in any future events organized by MLB and that Texas would not bid to host future All-Star games or other MLB special events. On Twitter, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams at first called for the change; however, she later recognized the decision was not received well by Georgia citizens and eventually stated her disappointment over the decision, saying, \"I don't want to see Georgia families hurt by lost events and jobs,\" while also stating that she understood why it was made. In a tweet, former President Barack Obama also praised MLB for moving the game out of Georgia.\nOn April 14, five Republican senators and representatives introduced legislation to strip Major League Baseball of its antitrust exemption in response to the move.\nAn April 5 Morning Consult poll found that 39% of U.S. adults approved of the move while 28% percent of U.S. adults disapproved, and 32% of U.S. adults stated they had no opinion or didn't know about the move. Overall support for the move was higher among MLB fans, Democrats, and people of color compared to the general population. Data from Morning Consult Brand Intelligence also showed that Republican approval of MLB dropped by 35 percentage points from 47 points to 12 points.\nThe 2021 MLB All-Star Game became at least the third major sporting event in the United States to be relocated for political reasons. Prior relocations that were announced in protest of states' political decisions include the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, which the NBA relocated in 2016 from Charlotte, North Carolina, in response to the passage of Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act which critics found transphobic, and Super Bowl XXVII, which the NFL relocated in 1990 from Tempe, Arizona, in response to a failed state referendum to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\nOn April 5, MLB announced that Coors Field in Denver would host the All-Star Game.\nLogo and jerseys.\nOn April 23, the All-Star Game logo was unveiled, featuring the Rockies' colors of purple, white, black, and silver with a profile representing the Rocky Mountains at the bottom. On June 24, MLB announced that players would wear standardized jerseys during the All-Star Game, rather than their own team's jerseys—navy blue for American League players and white for National League players.\nRoster selections.\nVoting for All-Star Game starting players was conducted in two phases: the first phase determined three finalists for each defensive position in each league (with nine finalists for the three outfield positions in each league) plus a designated hitter for the American League, and the second phase determined the starting players. Voting for each phase was independent; that is, votes did not carry over between phases. First phase voting was held from June 3 through June 24, and second phase voting was June 28 through July 1. All voting was conducted online, at MLB.com (or associated mobile applications) or via Google Search. Starting players, as selected via voting, were announced on July 1. Reserve position players and all pitchers—selected through \"a combination of Player Ballot selections and choices made by the Commissioner’s Office\"—were announced on July 4.\nMLB requires that at least one player from each major-league team be selected to the game. However, there is no requirement for each team to have a player rostered for the game—for various reasons, each of the four players from the Houston Astros selected to the game became unavailable, leaving the Astros without a player on the American League's active roster for the game.\nThe total of 40 players named All-Stars for the first time set a new MLB record.\nGame summary.\nMLB allowed the American League to roster Shohei Ohtani as both the team's starting pitcher and starting designated hitter (DH), allowing Ohtani (and his replacement) to continue as DH even after he was removed from the game as a pitcher."

        "text": "The 2018 UK Championship (officially the 2018 Betway UK Championship) was a professional ranking snooker tournament, that took place from 27 November to 9 December 2018. It was the ninth ranking tournament and the first Triple Crown event of the 2018/2019 season. The event was broadcast on BBC Sport and Eurosport in the United Kingdom.\nRonnie O'Sullivan, the defending champion, defeated Mark Allen 10–6 in the final, winning his 7th UK Championship and his 34th ranking event overall. In doing so, he became the first player since Stephen Hendry in 1996 to successfully defend the UK title. O'Sullivan broke Hendry's record for the most Triple Crown titles (18), Steve Davis's record of UK Championship titles (6) and became the second player to defend all Triple Crown tournaments at least once, after Hendry. The win was 25 years after his first UK Championship title as a 17 year old in 1993.\nStuart Bingham made the event's highest of 145 in the first frame of his third round match against David Gilbert.\nPrize fund.\nThe total prize money for the event was identical to that of the previous year's event, with the winner earning £170,000 and an overall prize fund of £850,000. The breakdown of prize money and ranking points for this year is shown below:\nThe \"rolling 147 prize\" for a maximum break stood at £15,000 but was not claimed.\nTournament summary.\nThe 2018 UK Championship began on 27 November 2018. The tournament featured 128 players with no qualification round. All of the matches, up to and including the semi-finals, were played over a single session that was held as best of 11 matches, with the final played on 9 December over two sessions in a best of 19 frame match.\nEarly rounds (1–4).\nThe tournament opened on 27 November 2018 with the first round of 128 players, which saw a number of upsets: most notably twice champion and World number one, Mark Selby, fell to unseeded amateur James Cahill, 3–6; and former champion and ninth seed Shaun Murphy lost by the same scoreline to 120th seed Chen Feilong. Also, 12th seed Ryan Day lost 2–6 to 117th seed Joe O'Connor; 20th seed Anthony McGill lost 5–6 to 109th seed Lu Ning; and 102nd seed Sam Baird came from 1–5 down to beat 27th seed Liang Wenbo 6–5. Thrice champion and fourth seed John Higgins scraped past unseeded amateur Dechawat Poomjaeng 6–5, however, Higgins then lost in the second round 5–6 to Alan McManus.\nThe televised portion of the event began on 1 December as the second round got underway. This round saw defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan defeat Ken Doherty 6–5 despite being behind 1–4. Eighth seed Ding Junhui defeated Matthew Selt 6–5. 2018 Northern Ireland Open winner Judd Trump missed a black ball at the end of the tenth frame, which would have clinched a 6–4 win against Dominic Dale, but Trump then triumphed in the deciding frame, 6–5. James Cahill, who defeated world number one Mark Selby in the first round, lost to 64th seed Sunny Akani on another 5–6. Elsewhere in round two, Mark Williams and Barry Hawkins both recorded 6–0 whitewashes of their second round opponents, Daniel Wells and Ian Burns respectively. Hawkins' win was his second consecutive 6–0 win, having defeated his first round opponent Jamie Clarke by the same margin.\nThe third round, played from 3 December 2018, saw the competition's last 32 players compete. The lowest ranked player remaining in the competition, Joe O'Connor (ranked 117th), was defeated by England's Joe Perry 2–6. However, 109th seed Lu Ning defeated 13th seed Luca Brecel 6–4. Ronnie O'Sullivan defeated Zhou Yuelong in a whitewash 6–0 to progress to the last 16.\nThe fourth round began on 5 December 2018. Defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan progressed to the quarter-finals, defeating Jack Lisowski by a 6–1 scoreline. However, world champion Mark Williams lost to 15th seed Stephen Maguire in a deciding frame, having led 4–0 earlier in the match. Martin O'Donnell (ranked 56th) upset China's eighth seed Ding Junhui by 6–4, and then defeated Judd Trump by the same scoreline to eliminate him from the competition. Tom Ford survived a decider with Lu Ning, the lowest ranked player left in the tournament. Meanwhile, Mark Allen also survived a deciding frame against Neil Robertson to go through to the quarter-finals, after making two consecutive centuries from 4–5 down.\nFinals (quarter-finals to final).\nThe event's quarter-finals began on 7 December 2018. The afternoon session saw defending champion O'Sullivan defeat Martin O'Donnell 6–1. This was O'Donnell's first Triple Crown quarter-final. Prior to the 2018/19 season, he had only reached the semi-finals of the 2018 Snooker Shoot Out. World number 21 Joe Perry was defeated by Tom Ford 2–6. This was Ford's first Triple Crown semi-final, and his third semi-final appearance since the 2013 Players Championship. He was runner-up in the 2016 Paul Hunter Classic.\nThe second set of quarter-finals took place in the evening and saw Mark Allen defeat Stephen Maguire 6–1. Maguire blamed his loss on the playing conditions, stating that \"you can't play good snooker\" on the table used. Despite the scoreline, Allen said he felt as though \"he didn't play well\". In the last quarter-final, 2015 world champion Stuart Bingham defeated Kyren Wilson 6–2. During the match, Bingham attempted a maximum break; he potted fifteen reds and blacks, before missing the yellow ball.\nThe semi-finals were played once again as best of eleven frame matches on 8 December 2018. The first semi-final match saw Tom Ford play Ronnie O'Sullivan. Ford won the opening frame of the match, with a break of 68, but lost the remaining six frames of the match, finishing 1–6. O'Sullivan reached the final, his fourth in five years, having declined to enter the UK Championship in 2015.&lt;ref name=\"Ronnie/Ford\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The second semi-final was between Stuart Bingham and Mark Allen. The match finished in favour of Allen, who won 6–5, despite Bingham being ahead 4–2.\nThe final was played on 9 December 2018 as a best of 19 frames match, spread over two sessions. It was contested between 2011 UK Championship runner-up Mark Allen and 2017 champion Ronnie O'Sullivan. The first four frames of the final were shared, however, the remaining four frames of the first session were won by O'Sullivan, leaving him 6–2 ahead after the initial session. In the evening session, O'Sullivan won the first frame, before Allen scored the highest break of the final (105), and entered the interval at 4–8 behind. O'Sullivan won the next frame, leaving him one frame from winning the tournament. Allen responded to clinch the next two frames including an attempt at a maximum break, which failed. O'Sullivan compiled a break of 78 in the 16th frame to win the championship.\nOn winning the event, O'Sullivan overtook the record for both the number of UK Championship wins held by Steve Davis (6), and the total number of Triple Crown events held by Stephen Hendry (18). O'Sullivan's 2018 win was his seventh UK Championship, and nineteenth Triple Crown championship win overall. Of his achievement, O'Sullivan commented, \"It's amazing to beat my hero Stephen Hendry's record. He was the ultimate player. I've still got eight world titles to get, so I'm chasing that one,\" referring to Hendry's greater number of World Snooker Championship victories.\nCentury breaks.\nA total of 137 century breaks were made by 61 players during the 2018 UK Championship.\nSponsorship and broadcasting.\nThe event was sponsored by betting company Betway, sponsors of the UK Championship since 2015. The tournament's broadcasters were dependent on country, with the BBC and Eurosport broadcasting across the United Kingdom and Europe respectively. The event was broadcast in China by Superstars Online, and China Central Television. In Hong Kong, NowTV simulcasted the event with additional commentary.\nControversy.\nDuring the event, two players Yu Delu and Cao Yupeng, were found guilty of match fixing. World number 52, Yu, was banned for ten years and nine months for fixing five matches over a three-year period. Cao was banned from snooker for six years (with three-and-a-half years suspended) for fixing three matches. The chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, Jason Ferguson, expressed his disappointment, stating that the players involved \"risk their careers and they will be caught\". World champion Mark Williams has suggested that players found cheating \"should get banned for life\".\nRonnie O'Sullivan, who is critical of the number of events on the calendar and the punishing tour schedule, said he was ready to start a \"breakaway tour\" which would be separate from the World Snooker Tour. He stated that he would ask \"four or five unhappy players\", including Stephen Hendry and John Higgins, to start a new \"Champions League-style\" tour. He also indicated that he would invite players that were banned from World Snooker, including Yu and Cao. O'Sullivan insisted that the breakaway tour would benefit everybody, including the bottom-ranked players, but that his plan was a \"last resort\".\nIn response, World Snooker chairman, Barry Hearn called the plan \"nonsensical\", and \"damaging\" to the sport. Hearn also fielded criticism of the current tour schedule from players of all levels, including world champion Mark Williams, Stephen Maguire and Neil Robertson.\nAftermath.\nDuring the final, a draw was made for the 2019 Masters in January. The event would see first round matches between Mark Allen and Luca Brecel, and between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Stuart Bingham. Six weeks later, the 2019 Masters was won by Judd Trump, who defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final on 20 January 2019.\nThe next event of the season, the 2018 Scottish Open, began on 10 December, the day after the final of the UK Championship. O'Sullivan pulled out of the event hours after winning the UK Championship before his first round match with Daniel Wells. Having been given a bye through the first round, Wells reached his first ranking event semi-final, building a 4–0 lead against Mark Allen, before eventually losing 5–6. Although O'Sullivan was not a competitor, he attended the Scottish Open to work on Eurosport's coverage of the event.\nAllen, after being runner-up at the UK Championship, won the Scottish Open despite stating that he had \"disrespected\" the tournament. He had consumed alcohol throughout the week, calling his appearance at the final \"undeserved\"; his highest break in the first four frames of his semi-final was just 24."

Conference play began in late December and concluded in early March.\nOld Dominion won the C-USA regular season championship by two games. The conference used a regular season schedule format which the conference hoped will increase NCAA Tournament berths. whereby the 14 teams played each other once with a second game for travel partners in the first seven weeks of C-USA play. After those 14 games, the league standings determined the matchups for the rest of the regular season. The teams were divided into two groups of five (teams in first through fifth place and 6–10) and a group of four (11–14). During the final three weeks, teams played within their respective grouping for the last four games of conference play. Home and away games within the groups were determined by a preset formula. C-USA Commissioner Judy MacLeod said that \"With the goals to improve seeding and increase the number of teams that advance to the postseason, we viewed this as a great opportunity to enhance our top teams' resumes by providing them additional quality games within their conference schedule.\"\nThe C-USA tournament was held from March 13–16, 2019 at The Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas. Old Dominion defeated Western Kentucky in the Tournament championship game. As a result Old Dominion received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.

The teams were seeded into four pots based on their performances in the previous Asian Games in 2014.

        "title": "Robert Foster (American football)",
        "text": "Robert Foster Jr. (born May 7, 1994) is an American football wide receiver who is a free agent. He played college football at Alabama and signed with the Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent in 2018. He has also been a member of the Green Bay Packers, Washington Football Team, Miami Dolphins, Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants, and Indianapolis Colts.\nEarly years.\nFoster attended Central Valley High School in Monaca, Pennsylvania, just outside Pittsburgh, where he played both football and basketball. While on the way to a football camp, he survived a shooting in which one of his teammates was killed. Coming out of high school, Foster was the nation's No. 2 receiver ranked 23rd overall in the 2013 class. A 4-star recruit, Foster committed to Alabama over offers from Florida, Michigan, Ohio State, and Pittsburgh, among others.\nCollege career.\nDuring his redshirt sophomore season in 2015, Foster suffered a season-ending shoulder injury after catching 10 receptions 116 yards and two touchdowns in the first three games. He was limited in 2016 and considered transferring before deciding to stay with Alabama.\nIn 2017, he caught 14 passes for 174 yards and one touchdown. Overall, he caught 35 passes for 389 yards and three scores during his career at Alabama.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nDespite limited college statistics, Foster was invited to the 2018 NFL Scouting Combine due to his athleticism. He clocked a 4.41-second 40-yard dash, fifth overall among receivers.\nBuffalo Bills.\n2018.\nFoster signed with the Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent on May 11, 2018, reuniting with Brian Daboll, his one-time offensive coordinator at Alabama. In Week 2, against the Los Angeles Chargers, he recorded his first two professional receptions, which went for 30 yards. He was waived on October 18, 2018, and was re-signed to the practice squad. He was promoted to the active roster on November 10, 2018.\nFoster recorded his first 100-yard receiving game against the New York Jets on November 11, finishing with 105 yards on three receptions. Against the Jacksonville Jaguars two weeks later following the Bills' bye week, he recorded his first receiving touchdown, a 75-yard pass from Josh Allen. Foster finished that game with two receptions for 94 yards and the touchdown. In Week 13 against the Miami Dolphins he only caught one pass for 27 yards. In the next game against the New York Jets on December 9, he made a career high seven catches on eight targets for 104 yards.

It took the form of various art stations throughout Millstatt connected by a bicycle/ hiking route.\nConcept and organization.\nThe exhibition debuted 2018, and was repeated 2019 and 2020, based on a long term funding by the European Union (= EU Rural Development Policy 2014-2020). \nIt had stops at various locations in Millstatt and adjacent communities. These art stations formed a loop, which could be visited by art-interested visitors, either walking or cycling the trail (hence the name \"Art cycling in Millstatt\"). Works by (up to now) about 150 internationally known artists from Austria, Germany, United States, Switzerland, Hungary, Croatia, Romania, Poland, Italy, Greece, Spain, South Korea and Guatemala were connected in the yearly exhibitions.\nFor the first time, this exhibition concept also combined the various existing art and cultural institutions in Millstatt in a joint program. In addition, the concept opened up a number of new and sometimes unusual places in Millstatt as a presentation opportunity for modern art.\nThe access to modern art at art museums, art exhibitions and art galleries is often characterized by the fact that only an art-interested and art-oriented audience is able or wanting to participate. The project \"Art cycling in Millstatt\" provided a low-threshold mediating of art as follows:\nFrom 2021 onwards, \"Art cycling in Millstatt\" is replaced by a new concept called \"millstART\". Now the exhibition stations are concentrated in the Millstatt Abbey, and the concept of a low threshold access to art in a wider region was dropped.\nStations and artists.\nThere were 25 stations and 65 artists presented within the project 2018; \n62 artists were presented 2019 at 25 stations, too, though some new stations were added and some former stations dropped. 2020 25 artists were presented at 18 locations, already mostly in the area of the former Millstatt Abbey. \nAltogether 151 artists were presented at 39 locations in Millstatt between 2018 and 2020.\nStations\nArtists and art workshops\nThe artists presented and the art-workshops offered were representing several areas of contemporary visual arts (names and events are noted here with the year of presentation at \"Art cycling Millstatt\"):"

A ‘Swiss model’ pool stage similar to those adopted by the European Rugby Champions Cup and football’s UEFA Champions League or six pools of four with an additional round of 16 were under consideration.\nThe expansion to 24 teams was confirmed on 24 October.\nFormat.\nFinals format.\nTo accommodate the expansion from a 20-team finals tournament to 24 teams, the format was changed from the one used in 2023 with the addition of two extra groups in the group stage, and an extra round in the knockout phase.\nDevelopment and preparations.\nAustralia won their bid to host the 2027 Rugby World Cup on 12 May 2022.\nTeams.\nQualification.\nA total of 12 teams gained automatic qualification for the tournament by finishing in the top three of their pool at the 2023 Rugby World Cup, these positions being determined at the close of the pool stage.\nBidding.\nWorld Rugby was hoping to award the bids for both the 2027 and 2031 men's World Cups (along with the bids for the 2025 and 2029 women's World Cups) by May 2022. The process of talking to prospective nations began in February 2021 with the formal candidate process commencing three months later. Finalists were evaluated in February 2022.\nAs of June 2019, Argentina, Australia and Russia had declared their interest in hosting the 2027 Rugby World Cup, but Argentina withdrew their bid in April 2020, leaving two bidders. There was speculation that the United States and South Africa would be interested in hosting the event, but the South African Rugby Union has stated that it would not be bidding for the 2027 World Cup.\nWorld Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont suggested in late 2018 that the host of the Rugby World Cup following the 2023 event in France could be an emerging nation. World Rugby CEO Brett Gosper also suggested in 2019 that World Rugby may bid the 2027 and 2031 World Cups together (as they did with England 2015 and Japan 2019), so that they could make “a bolder decision and a traditional decision.” The hosts for the 2027 and 2031 tournaments will be revealed in May 2022.\nThe fact that three consecutive World Cups (England 2015, Japan 2019, and France 2023) will have occurred in the northern hemisphere made the southern hemisphere countries considered the favourites.\nOn 12 May 2022, it was announced that Australia would host the 2027 Rugby World Cup.\nAnnounced bidders.\nAustralia.\nRugby Australia announced on 13 December 2017 that Australia would bid for the 2027 Rugby World Cup. Australia has previously hosted the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup together with New Zealand, as well as the 2003 Rugby World Cup on its own.\nWithdrawn bids.\nArgentina.\nArgentina had announced on 5 October 2016 that it would bid for the 2027 Rugby World Cup, but withdrew its bid in April 2020. Argentina has never hosted the tournament before, and World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont had pledged that he would back the right of countries such as Argentina to bid for the event. Argentina is the only country to reach the World Cup semi-finals that has not hosted any World Cup matches. In April 2020, Argentina withdrew its bid to strengthen the Australian bid, making Australia favourites for the 2027 Rugby World Cup host.\nRussia.\nStanislav Druzhinin of the Russian Rugby Union said at a meeting on 31 May 2019 that Russia would apply to host the 2027 Rugby World Cup. Russia would use the 2018 FIFA World Cup stadiums and legacy for the 2027 Rugby World Cup. President Vladimir Putin backed Russia's bid to host the 2027 Rugby World Cup.\nRugby Union of Russia could not proceed with its bid to host after Court of Arbitration for Sport imposed a two-year ban on 17 December 2020 on Russia hosting any major sports tournament."

        "title": "1899 Metropolitan Rugby Union season",
        "text": "The 1899 Metropolitan Rugby Union season was the 26th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. It was the last season run for independent clubs who took their players from across the city. Eight clubs competed from May till September 1899. The season culminated in the premiership, which was won by Wallaroo. Wallaroo were crowned premiers by virtue of finishing the season on top of the table.\nTeams.\nSeven clubs contested the season. Paddington and Burwood were missing from the Senior grade having been disbanded during the previous season. Parramatta returned to the Premiership for the first time since 1894. Marrickville and Buccaneer both stepped up from the First Junior to the Senior grade. Marrickville were the current First Junior Premiers.\nSeason summary.\nThe 1899 Sydney Rugby Premiership saw the Wallaroo Football Club win the premiership by four points. The season finished much later than usual due to representative games and poor weather. As a result, the final round of the regular season was canceled in order to play out the finals for the two trophies. This did not effect the results of the premiership as Wallaroo were already too far ahead to be beaten and the finals were not included in the premiership.\nAccording to the club captain, Paddy Lane, Wallaroo fielded their best all-round team. Much of the scoring came from the back row with Alfonso Spragg, Charlie White, Iggy O'Donnell, John Futter and Frank Row scoring 32 of the teams tries. The team experienced good fortune to not have any major injuries during the season despite many of the team playing representatives games in addition to club games. Wallaroo won two out of the three awards for the season, with the team winning the Premiership and the Sydney Cricket Ground Trophy. They surprisingly lost the Agricultural Society Trophy final, only their second loss of the season.\nRandwick began the season with an impressive record. They were unbeaten until the eleventh round. This included inflicting the only loss for Wallaroo during the regular season, beating them by one point. The result was reversed when Wallaroo ended Randwick's unbeaten run, winning 11 points to nil. From there, Randwick won only one game in their last four, including fielding only 13 players in the Sydney Cricket Ground semi-final.\nAs in previous seasons, the Pirates Football Club came along with great dash and strength towards the end of the season. During the regular season games, the team had only won five games. This resulted in them not making the semi-finals for the Sydney Cricket Ground Trophy. However, they made their presence felt during the Agricultural Society Trophy games, winning all of the matches to the final and winning the final brilliantly. This was the third year in a row that the team had won the Agricultural Society Trophy.\nTrophy finals.\nEven though the premiership was decided at the end of the regular games, a finals series was organised. The games were not included in the premiership results. Two trophies were played for at the end of the season: the Sydney Cricket Ground Trophy and the Agricultural Society Trophy.\nFinals week 1, 16 September.\nSydney Cricket Ground Trophy.\nAt the end of the regular season, the top four teams qualified for the Sydney Cricket Ground Trophy. The first week of finals saw these teams play in the semi-finals for the SCG Trophy. As was expected, Wallaroo easily won their match against Marrickville to proceed to the final. The form of the victorious team was that which would have rivalled an Intercolonial match. In their semi-final, Randwick were only able to field 13 players with many unfamiliar faces. Despite this, the team held their own with the Wallaroo players barracking from the sidelines. Sydney won the game with a try in the dying moments to proceed to the final to play against Wallaroo.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nThe remaining four teams played the first games towards the Agricultural Society Trophy. In the first game, the Pirates easily won against the Buccaneers. The winners, like Randwick, also had trouble fielding a team to play with the team fielding many unfamiliar faces. The Buccaneer were eliminated from the final series after their loss to the Pirates. The second qualifying game did not happen as Parramatta forfeited the game and thus the final series. As a result, Sydney University received a forfeit to pass through the first qualifying round.\nFinals week 2, 23 September.\nSydney Cricket Ground Trophy.\nThe final for the trophy was closer than had been expected, despite the final scoreline. At the end of the first half, Wallaroo led Sydney by the slim margin of 1 point. And early in the second half, Sydney scored to take the lead 8 to 6. From there, Sydney failed to capitalise on their momentum and, through some mistakes, Wallaroo were able to score twice to win the match and the trophy.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nThe two second round qualifying games for the Agricultural Society Trophy were almost forgotten. Even the clubs struggled to field their best teams. Marrickville had only 11 players in their game against Sydney University. They were no match for the Varsity and lost the game by a large margin. The Pirates-Randwick game saw many unfamiliar faces participating. The Randwick team were almost entirely made up of reserves and, as a result, lost the match 6 to 0. The two victorious teams, the Pirates and Sydney University were to progress to the semi-finals for the Trophy against the two finalists for the SCG Trophy.\nFinals week 3, 27 September.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nThe semi-finals for the Agricultural Society Trophy were played midweek on Wednesday. Much of the interest in the games had been lost as the football season had drawn on longer than was necessary. There had been calls for the Union to cancel the semi's and the final. However, the Union ignored these requests and proceeded with the matches.\nThe weather on the Wednesday the matches were held turned out to be wet and windy. The first semi-final between Wallaroo and University was entirely one-sided with Wallaroo dominating the scoring. The second semi-final ended in a fiasco. Ten minutes into the game, a Sydney player was ordered off the field for striking an opponent. The player refused to go with the game suspended for approximately ten more minutes. After some discussion, the referee decided to end the match. The entire situation was presented that evening to the Union, who awarded the match to the Pirates. What play was seen during the match indicated that the Pirates were the better team.\nFinals week 4, 30 September.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nThe final for the Agricultural Society Trophy was played between the Premiers, Wallaroo, and the Pirates. The Pirates put a fantastic team in the field, all in sound condition. They had the measure of Wallaroo, demonstrating excellent defence. The team had an answer for each of the plays that Wallaroo had. During the game, Wallaroo had one moment where they were looking like scoring. However, a pass was fumbled, resulting in a lost opportunity. As in previous years, the Pirates had come good at the right time of the year. This was the third consecutive year that the Pirates had won the Agricultural Society Trophy.\nLower grades.\nThe MRFU also conducted Second Grade and Third Grade competitions.\nSecond Grade.\nThe following teams were involved in the Second Grade competition in 1899: Adelphi, Arncliffe, Endeavour, Glebe, Manly Federal, Mosman, Newtown, North Sydney, Permanent Artillery, Redfern Waratah, South Sydney, Sydney University B, Wallaroo II, Waverley. At the conclusion of the season, Glebe and South Sydney faced each other in the final. The game was drawn with a replay organised for a later date. Glebe won the replay 14 to 3 and were declared premiers.\nThird Grade.\nThe following teams were involved in the Third Grade competition in 1899: Balmain Carlingford, Bondi, Botany, Burwood, East Sydney, Forest Lodge Cambridge, Hurstville, Manly Wentworth, Newtown II, Pioneer, Strathfield, Sydney University III, Warrigal, Waverley Oaks, Permanent Artillery, South Sydney II, Redfern Waratah II. At the conclusion of the season, Forest Lodge Cambridge beat Waverley Oaks in the final 10 to 6."

        "text": "Steven Edwards (born March 1, 1973) is an American former professional basketball player.\nHigh school career.\nEdwards attended Miami Senior High School, where he had a very successful career and was named Florida Mr. Basketball twice: in his junior year, when he averaged 23.5 points, 7.0 rebounds and 6.0 assists, and in his senior year, when his averages were 18.1 points, 8.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists. Edwards won 2 state championships (1990 and 1991) and was a runner-up in the 1992 tournament with Miami Senior. His performances during his high school career earned him several honors; he was selected in the \"Parade\" All-America Third Team and was the Florida Gatorade Player of the Year in 1992, and some sources ranked him among the top 10 seniors of his class. He was also selected as a McDonald's All-American: he played in the 1992 McDonald's All-American Boys Game where he wore 32, his jersey number at Miami Senior, and scored 3 points (his only made field goal being a 3-point shot).\nCollege career.\nEdwards decided to stay in his hometown and committed to Miami. He immediately made an impact in his freshman season, which for him was the best in many statistical categories: he started 25 games of the 27 Miami played that season, and led the Big East in 3-point field goal percentage with an average of .382. He was the top scoring freshman in the conference and had a career-high 26-points game against Pitt on January 23, 1993. He was named in the 1993 Big East All-Rookie team and was the leading scorer for the Hurricanes that season. His sophomore season saw a sharp decline in his scoring average due to a knee injury suffered during the preseason. He played less minutes and started only 11 games. The following season he could start again for the Hurricanes, was the top scorer of the team and improved his rebounding average, which went up to 4.5 per game; he also recorded a .771 free throw percentage, which was the best of his college career and among the best of the Big East (ranked 4th in the conference). He was named team co-captain for his senior season (the other being Alex Fraser), and led again the Hurricanes in scoring with a 12.9 points per game average. He finished his college career with 110 games, 91 starts, and scoring a total of 1,393 points. At the end of his career he was also the leader for 3-pointers made in Hurricanes history (he has since been surpassed and now ranks 2nd).\nProfessional career.\nAfter the end of his senior season, Edwards was automatically eligible for the 1996 NBA draft, but he was not selected by any team. He began his professional career in Argentina and signed for Atenas de Córdoba: he was a 2-time national champion during his first 2 years at Atenas, and also won the 1998 Liga Sudamericana de Básquetbol. After a season at Boca Juniors he was part of the summer roster of the Utah Jazz in 2000 before being released in July 2000.\nEdwards then moved to Europe and was part of the roster of the St. Petersburg Lions: with the Russian team he played 5 Euroleague games, averaging 13.4 points and 3.8 rebounds. After the season ended he came back to Atenas, and stayed there for one more season. He spent part of the 2001–02 season with Universidad Complutense, and in April 2002 he signed for the Cantabria Lobos, with which he played 4 games in the top level of Spanish basketball, averaging 5.5 points and 1 rebound. After a year in Uruguay he played 5 season at UB La Palma.\nPersonal life.\nEdwards was born in Miami, Florida to John Benny and Laura Mae Edwards. His brothers Doug and Allen have also been basketball players: Doug played in the NBA for the Atlanta Hawks and the Vancouver Grizzlies, while Allen has played college basketball for Kentucky and went on to coaching."

        "text": "The 2018–19 Gallagher Premiership was the 32nd season of the top flight English domestic rugby union competition and the first one to be sponsored by Gallagher. The reigning champions entering the season were Saracens, who had claimed their fourth title after defeating Exeter Chiefs in the 2018 final. Bristol Bears had been promoted as champions from the 2017–18 RFU Championship at the first attempt.\nThe competition was broadcast by BT Sport for the sixth successive season and with five games also simulcast free-to-air on Channel 5. Highlights of each weekend's games were shown on Channel 5 with extended highlights on BT Sport.\nSummary.\nSaracens won their fifth title after defeating Exeter Chiefs in the final at Twickenham after having finished second in the regular season table. Newcastle Falcons were relegated after being unable to win their penultimate game of the season. It was the third time that Newcastle have been relegated from the top flight since the leagues began and the first time since the 2011–12 Premiership Rugby season.\nFor the first time since 2004, there was no London Double Header at Twickenham due to redevelopment work causing the closure of the stadium.\nTeams.\nTwelve teams compete in the league – the top eleven teams from the previous season and Bristol Bears who were promoted from the 2017–18 RFU Championship after a top flight absence of one year. They replaced London Irish who were relegated after one year in the top flight.\nPreseason.\nThe 2018 edition of the Premiership Rugby Sevens Series would be held on 27 and 28 July at Franklin's Gardens. All twelve Premiership teams would feature in one venue over two days. Teams would be split into four pools of three which played each other once in a round-robin basis with the tournament splitting into Cup and Plate competitions on the second day.\nFixtures.\nFixtures for the season were announced by Premiership Rugby on 6 July 2018.

        "title": "WrestleMania 39",
        "text": "WrestleMania 39 (marketed as WrestleMania Goes Hollywood) was the 39th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place as a two-night event on April 1 and 2, 2023, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California—the original location of WrestleMania 37 before the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to be relocated. WWE wrestler The Miz and rapper Snoop Dogg served as the hosts for the event.\nWrestleMania 39 was the sixth to be held in Greater Los Angeles (after 2, VII, XII, 2000, and 21), and the seventh in the state of California overall (including 31, which was held in the San Francisco Bay Area). It was the first WrestleMania to livestream on Binge in Australia. This would subsequently be the final WrestleMania in which WWE was still owned and controlled by the McMahon family as on April 3, the day after the event, it was confirmed that the company had been sold to Endeavor. The sale was finalized on September 12, with WWE merging with Ultimate Fighting Championship to become divisions of a new entity called TKO Group Holdings.\nThe card comprised a total of 15 matches, with eight on Night 1 and seven on Night 2. In the main event for Night 1, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn defeated The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) to win the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship, ending the latter's record setting male tag team title reign at 622 days. This was also the first time a tag team championship match was the main event of a WrestleMania, and only the second time a tag team match in general was the main event, after WrestleMania I in March 1985. In other prominent matches, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins defeated Logan Paul, Rey Mysterio defeated Dominik Mysterio, Rhea Ripley defeated Charlotte Flair to win the SmackDown Women's Championship, and in the opening bout, Austin Theory defeated John Cena to retain Raw's United States Championship. The event also included the in-ring return of Pat McAfee, who wrestled his first match since the 2022 SummerSlam, as well as the in-ring WWE debut of Snoop Dogg, who both defeated The Miz in impromptu matches, with the latter occurring on Night 2.\nIn the main event for Night 2, Roman Reigns defeated Cody Rhodes to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. This subsequently made Reigns the second wrestler after Hulk Hogan to enter three consecutive WrestleManias as world champion during the same reign but it made him the only wrestler to defend a world championship at each. In other prominent matches, Edge defeated \"The Demon\" Finn Bálor in a Hell in a Cell match, Gunther defeated Sheamus and Drew McIntyre in a triple threat match to retain SmackDown's Intercontinental Championship, Bianca Belair defeated Asuka to retain the Raw Women's Championship, and in the opening bout, Brock Lesnar defeated Omos. Night 2 was also notable for the return of Shane McMahon, who last appeared at the 2022 Royal Rumble.\nThe event received generally positive reviews from critics; the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship, the Intercontinental Championship, and the SmackDown Women's Championship matches were singled out as highlights throughout the entire event, with the former two rated five stars by Dave Meltzer. Although noting the event's reptiveness, critics also praised the Men's WrestleMania Showcase fatal four-way tag team match, Logan Paul vs. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, Rey Mysterio vs. Dominik Mysterio, and the Hell in a Cell match. WWE's use of Auschwitz footage in a staged video promoting the Mysterio match drew criticism for exploiting genuine historic footage, leading WWE to apologize and state its inclusion was due to an editing error.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event, having first been held in 1985. It was the company's first PPV produced and was also WWE's first major event available via livestreaming when the company launched the WWE Network in February 2014. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. Along with Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, it is one of the company's five biggest events of the year, referred to as the \"Big Five\". WrestleMania is ranked the sixth-most valuable sports brand in the world by Forbes, and has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host the year's edition of WrestleMania. WrestleMania 39 featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. On February 27, 2023, it was revealed that current WWE wrestler The Miz would serve as the host of the event. The official theme songs for the event were \"Less than Zero\" by The Weeknd and \"Hollywood Swinging\" by Kool &amp; the Gang.\nOn February 10, 2020, WWE announced that SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California would host WrestleMania 37 on March 28, 2021, with the event being promoted as \"WrestleMania Hollywood\". Wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer reported that WWE had originally pushed for SoFi Stadium to host WrestleMania in 2022, so it could promote the event as having a larger overall attendance than Super Bowl LVI (which was held at the same venue in February of that year). However, Inglewood city officials preferred that WrestleMania be held in 2021 to prepare for Super Bowl LVI.\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in October 2020, however, the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" reported that WWE was considering relocating WrestleMania 37, as the state of the pandemic in California made it increasingly unlikely that the event could be held with in-person spectators on the scheduled date. WWE had reportedly planned to relocate the event to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, which was originally scheduled to host WrestleMania 36 before the onset of the pandemic forced it to be scaled back and held at WWE's Orlando training facility instead. In late-September 2020, Florida governor Ron DeSantis lifted all mandatory capacity restrictions in the state, although sports teams continued to voluntarily impose capacity restrictions based on federal guidance. California allowed outdoor stadiums to re-open to in-state visitors only beginning April 1, 2021, with capacity restricted based on case positivity in individual regions.\nOn January 16, 2021, WWE officially announced that WrestleMania 37 had been relocated to Tampa, and that Inglewood would instead host WrestleMania 39 in 2023, with the aforementioned \"Hollywood\"-themed branding being carried over. WrestleMania 39 was the first since WrestleMania 21 to be held in Greater Los Angeles, and the seventh held in the state of California (after 2, VII, XII, 2000, 21, and 31). The event was originally announced to be held solely on Sunday, April 2, 2023, but during WrestleMania 38, it was revealed that like the previous three WrestleMania events, WrestleMania 39 was expanded to a two-night event, scheduled for Saturday, April 1 and Sunday, April 2. WrestleMania 39 was also the first to be held in an official Olympic Stadium as Sofi Stadium is one of the two main venues for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and the third since the Pontiac Silverdome (WrestleMania III) and the AT&amp;T Stadium (32 and 38) to be hosted in a FIFA World Cup venue as it is also one the stadiums to host matches for the 2026 edition of the tournament.\nTickets for the event went on sale on August 12, 2022. WWE also announced that WrestleMania Priority Passes would be available beginning July 22. These passes included premier seating, a dedicated stadium entrance, premium hospitality offerings, and meet-and-greets with current WWE wrestlers and legends. Ticket sales for WrestleMania 39 set a company record, with over 90,000 tickets sold within the first 24 hours, more than any other WWE event in history.\nWrestleMania was created by WWE owner Vince McMahon. In July 2022, McMahon announced his retirement, after having served as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company since 1982. His daughter, Stephanie McMahon, along with WWE president Nick Khan, took over as co-CEOs, and the former also took over as Chairwoman of WWE. Vince's son-in-law—Stephanie's husband—Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque took over creative control. Stephanie would resign as co-CEO and chairwoman in January 2023, and Vince would return as Executive Chairman while Khan became the sole CEO. Although Vince returned in an executive role, Triple H maintained complete creative control of booking WWE's storylines.\nBroadcast outlets.\nIn addition to airing on traditional pay-per-view, WrestleMania 39 was available to livestream on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in most international markets. It was also the first WrestleMania to livestream on Binge in Australia after the Australian version of the WWE Network merged under Foxtel's streaming service Binge in January.\nCelebrity involvement.\nAs is tradition at WrestleMania, celebrities outside of WWE were involved in various roles. Pop/reggaeton singer Becky G performed \"America the Beautiful\" for Night 1, while country singer Jimmie Allen did the same for Night 2. Actor and comedian Kevin Hart did the cold open for both nights of the event. Rapper and WWE Hall of Famer Snoop Dogg co-hosted the event alongside The Miz, drove Rey Mysterio out for his entrance on Night 1 in a tribute to Eddie Guerrero, and wrestled an impromptu improvised match during Night 2. Rapper Bad Bunny was also a guest commentator on the Spanish commentary team for Mysterio's match. YouTuber, rapper, and boxer KSI was involved in Logan Paul's match on Night 1, disguised as the Prime energy drink mascot, a brand he co-owns with Paul. San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle was in attendance and assisted Pat McAfee in his match against The Miz on Night 1. Rapper Lil Uzi Vert performed a portion of his song \"Just Wanna Rock\" prior to the main event of Night 1.\nOther WrestleMania Week events.\nAs part of the WrestleMania festivities, WWE held a number of events throughout the week. The week kicked off with a special \"WrestleMania Edition\" of \"Monday Night Raw\" on March 27, held at the Footprint Center in Phoenix, Arizona. The night before WrestleMania 39 on March 31, WWE kicked off WrestleMania Weekend itself with a special \"WrestleMania Edition\" of \"Friday Night SmackDown\", which hosted the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, won by Bobby Lashley. Immediately after \"SmackDown\", the 2023 WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony commenced. The day of WrestleMania Saturday, WWE's developmental brand NXT held its annual WrestleMania Week event, Stand &amp; Deliver. WrestleMania Week concluded with the \"Raw\" after WrestleMania on April 3. All of the weekend events were held live at the Crypto.com Arena in Downtown Los Angeles.\nOn February 1, 12 WWE wrestlers participated in the filming of an episode of \"Wheel of Fortune\" for a WWE-themed week that aired during WrestleMania week. It featured the 1996–98 format of 12 players with the three highest scoring participants advancing to the Friday Finals, with the winning civilian earning a trip to WrestleMania. WWE Hall of Famer The Undertaker also brought his \"1 deadMAN Show\" to Los Angeles during WrestleMania Weekend, which is a one-man touring show in which he tells stories from his 30-year career. It was held at The Novo at L.A. Live on March 31 at 11 p.m. Eastern Time.\nPromotional movie parodies.\nSimilar to WrestleMania 21, which also had a Hollywood theme, WrestleMania 39 was promoted on television with a series of parody movie and television trailers with WWE talent playing the starring roles from famous movies and shows.\nThese included:\nStorylines.\nThe event included matches that each resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nMain event matches.\nAt WrestleMania 38, Cody Rhodes made a surprise return to WWE after having been away from the company for six years—during this time, he reestablished himself by wrestling in various other promotions and helped found All Elite Wrestling (AEW) in January 2019. At the same event, Roman Reigns became the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion by retaining SmackDown's Universal Championship and winning Raw's WWE Championship. On the \"Raw\" after WrestleMania, Rhodes stated that he returned to win the WWE Championship, not only for himself, but also for his late father, Dusty, who never won the title. In June, Rhodes suffered a pectoral injury, which sidelined him for several months. At the 2023 Royal Rumble, Rhodes returned and won the men's Royal Rumble match to earn a match against Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania 39 in the main event of Night 2. While Rhodes simply wanted to win the championship to bring honor to his family, Reigns, by way of his special counsel Paul Heyman, made it personal, with Heyman stating that Dusty's last words to him were that although Cody was his favorite son, Reigns, who Dusty trained, was the son he always wanted. On the March 3 episode of \"SmackDown\", Rhodes confronted Reigns face-to-face for the first time. Rhodes claimed that throughout his career, he had always overcome the odds and would do it again at WrestleMania. Reigns reinforced what Heyman had said, and then told Rhodes that at WrestleMania, if there was anything that Dusty did not teach his own son, Reigns would. This match also makes Reigns the first wrestler to defend a world championship at three consecutive WrestleMania's during the same reign.\nSince late 2020, Kevin Owens had an on and off feud with The Bloodline. At in November 2022, Owens was on the opposing team in a WarGames match against The Bloodline, which included Owens' long time frenemy Sami Zayn, who joined The Bloodline as an honorary member in mid-2022. The Bloodline was victorious at Survivor Series thanks to Zayn betraying Owens. After Bloodline leader Roman Reigns defeated Owens at the 2023 Royal Rumble, Bloodline members The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) and Solo Sikoa attacked Owens, while Zayn watched on in uncertainty. Zayn then intervened when Reigns was about to hit Owens in the head with a steel chair, at which point Reigns ordered Zayn to attack Owens with the chair, but Zayn turned on Reigns and hit him with the chair. Zayn apologized to Jey, who he had become close with, only for Jimmy, Sikoa, and Reigns to attack Zayn as an emotionally distraught Jey left the ring as the rest of The Bloodline continued the assault. This led to a match between Reigns and Zayn at Elimination Chamber where Reigns won, but after the match, Owens prevented The Bloodline (except an absent Jey) from further attacking Zayn. On the following \"Raw\", Zayn said that despite their rough history, he and Owens should work together to take down The Bloodline. Owens said that he only assisted Zayn so that Zayn's family would not have to see him get destroyed like Owens did in front of his own family at the Royal Rumble and he told Zayn he would continue fighting alone. Over the next weeks, Zayn tried to convince The Usos that Reigns was manipulating them. Jimmy maintained his loyalty to his family, while Jey's uncertainty continued until the March 6 episode of \"Raw\" where he seemingly sided with Zayn, but then turned on him because Zayn was not family. The following week, Reigns' WrestleMania opponent Cody Rhodes attempted to help resolve issues between Owens and Zayn, but Owens refused; however, later that night, Owens came to Zayn's aid, who got ambushed by The Usos, and Owens and Zayn embraced. On the March 20 episode of \"Raw\", The Usos accepted Owens and Zayn's challenge for a match at WrestleMania 39 for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship. The match was scheduled for Night 1 in what would become the main event, marking the second WrestleMania in which a tag team match was the main event, after the very first WrestleMania in March 1985, but the first time for a tag team championship match to main event WrestleMania.\nUndercard matches.\nAt the Royal Rumble, Raw's Rhea Ripley won the women's Royal Rumble match to earn a women's championship match of her choice at WrestleMania 39. On the following episode of \"Raw\", she chose to challenge Charlotte Flair for the SmackDown Women's Championship, setting up a WrestleMania rematch between the two from WrestleMania 36 in 2020, where Flair had won that year's Royal Rumble and had chosen and defeated Ripley for the NXT Women's Championship. This subsequently marked the first women's WrestleMania rematch to happen at a WrestleMania, which was scheduled for Night 1 of the event.\nDue to the aforementioned women's Royal Rumble match winner choosing the SmackDown Women's Championship, an Elimination Chamber match was scheduled for the eponymous event to determine Bianca Belair's challenger for the Raw Women's Championship at WrestleMania 39. The match was won by Asuka, and the title match was scheduled for Night 2.\nOn the February 20 episode of \"Raw\", Omos and his manager MVP addressed the match between Brock Lesnar and Bobby Lashley from Elimination Chamber. MVP called Lesnar a coward and claimed that Lesnar intentionally disqualified himself because Lesnar knew he could not break Lashley's Hurt Lock submission. MVP then invited Lesnar to \"Raw\" the following week to accept Omos' challenge for a match at WrestleMania 39. The following week, after MVP sold him on the match, Lesnar accepted, and the match was scheduled for Night 2.\nOn the March 10 episode of \"SmackDown\", a fatal five-way match was contested, where the winner would face Gunther for the Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania 39. The match ended in a double pinfall, with Drew McIntyre and Sheamus named co-winners. It was then announced that the two would face each other the following week to determine the definitive number one contender, however, that match ended in a no-contest after Imperium (Gunther, Ludwig Kaiser, and Giovanni Vinci) attacked both participants. WWE official Adam Pearce then decided that Gunther would defend the championship against both McIntyre and Sheamus in a triple threat match at WrestleMania 39 on Night 2.\nSince April 2022, Austin Theory and John Cena had been teasing a match against each other over social media. The two briefly came face-to-face during Cena's 20-year anniversary celebration on the June 27, 2022, episode of \"Raw\", where Theory mocked Cena and called him out of touch. In February 2023, during the Elimination Chamber post-event press conference after Theory had retained the United States Championship at the event, Theory was annoyed that everyone was asking about Cena instead of his own accomplishments. After it was announced that Cena would be making his return on the March 6 episode of \"Raw\", Theory stated that he would be giving him a warm welcome back. Theory confronted Cena on that episode and claimed that Cena was an inspiration to him and then challenged Cena to face him at WrestleMania 39 for the United States Championship, however, Cena declined as he felt Theory was not ready. After some coaxing from Theory, Cena allowed his hometown of Boston to decide, and they cheered to see the match, which prompted Cena to accept the challenge. On March 24, it was confirmed that the match would open Night 1.\nAt the Royal Rumble, Logan Paul, who had been out with an injury since Crown Jewel in November 2022, made a surprise return as an entrant in the men's Royal Rumble match and eliminated Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins. Following this, Rollins began bad mouthing Paul in interviews, stating that he did not want Paul to be in WWE. At Elimination Chamber during the titular match, Paul snuck into the Chamber and attacked Rollins, costing him the United States Championship. Paul accepted Rollins' invitation to appear on the March 6 episode of \"Raw\", where Rollins wanted to fight only for Paul to decline and state that he would not fight for free and hinted that they could fight at WrestleMania 39. WrestleMania host The Miz then claimed that he could make the match official, and it was later confirmed. On his \"Impaulsive\" podcast, Paul stated that the match would be happening on Night 1.\nAt SummerSlam in July 2022, Bayley made her return from injury alongside Dakota Kai and Iyo Sky after Becky Lynch's match. Lynch would take time off due to an attack from Bayley, Kai, and Sky and the three dubbed themselves as Damage CTRL. Lynch made her return in November, and led her team in defeating Damage CTRL's team in a WarGames match at Survivor Series: WarGames. Over the next few weeks, Damage CTRL continued targeting Lynch and on the February 6, 2023, episode of \"Raw\", during a Steel Cage match between Lynch and Bayley, WWE Hall of Famer Lita returned and prevented Kai and Sky from interfering in the match, allowing Lynch to defeat Bayley. Lynch and Lita then defeated Kai and Sky on the February 27 episode to win the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship, thanks to returning fellow Hall of Famer, Trish Stratus, who prevented Bayley from interfering. The following week, Stratus, who had retired at SummerSlam in 2019, stated that she was coming out of retirement so that she, Lynch, and Lita could challenge Damage CTRL to a six-woman tag team match at WrestleMania 39 and Damage CTRL accepted. On \"The Tommy Tiernan Show\", Lynch confirmed the match would be on Night 1.\nAt WrestleMania 38, Edge won his match thanks to a distraction from Damian Priest. The two then formed a faction named The Judgment Day. Over the next couple of months, Rhea Ripley and Finn Bálor would also be added to the group. In June, however, Bálor, Priest, and Ripley turned on Edge, kicking him out of the group. In September, The Judgment Day recruited Dominik Mysterio. Edge continued his feud with The Judgment Day over the next few months, and he and his wife Beth Phoenix teamed up to defeat Bálor and Ripley at Elimination Chamber. On the following episode of \"Raw\", Edge, who felt his feud with The Judgment Day was over, lost his United States Championship match after interference from Bálor. The following week, Bálor said their feud was not done and challenged Edge to a match at WrestleMania 39. On the following week's episode, Edge interfered in Bálor's match, causing him to lose, and Edge challenged Bálor to meet him alone on the next episode. There, the two agreed to a Hell in a Cell match at WrestleMania 39 with Edge wanting to face Bálor's \"Demon\" persona and Bálor agreed. The match was scheduled for Night 2.\nOn the March 17 episode of \"SmackDown\", it was announced that at WrestleMania 39, there would be two WrestleMania Showcase matches, which would be fatal four-way tag team matches, with one each for the men and women. Qualifying matches for the women's Showcase began that night. Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez qualified first by defeating Tegan Nox and Emma. The following week, Natalya and Shotzi qualified by defeating Xia Li and Lacey Evans, and after the match, Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler were added, bypassing a qualifier match. The final qualifying match took place on the March 27 episode of \"Raw\", with Chelsea Green and Sonya Deville qualifying by defeating \"Michin\" Mia Yim and Candice LeRae. No qualifying matches were held for the men's Showcase as all four teams were announced on March 20: Braun Strowman and Ricochet, The Viking Raiders (Erik and Ivar), The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford), and Alpha Academy (Chad Gable and Otis). The men's Showcase was scheduled for Night 1 with the women's on Night 2.\nRey Mysterio would also have his own issues with The Judgment Day, which only heightened when his own son Dominik turned on him to join Judgment Day at Clash at the Castle in September 2022. Rey refused to fight his own son and was about to quit WWE, but he was convinced to stay, and he was traded to the SmackDown brand to avoid Judgment Day on Raw. However, their paths would cross again at the Royal Rumble. Rey was supposed to compete in the men's Royal Rumble match, but he never came out when his entrance music played. Dominik then entered, carrying Rey's mask, implying that he attacked his dad to prevent him from entering. With Judgment Day's Rhea Ripley winning the women's Royal Rumble and choosing to challenge for the SmackDown Women's Championship, the group began appearing on \"SmackDown\", thus Dominik began tormenting his dad again. On the March 10 episode, after it was announced that Rey would be the first inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2023, The Judgment Day interrupted and Dominik said his dad did not deserve the recognition. The following week, an emotional Rey said he wanted Dominik by his side for his Hall of Fame induction, but Dominik instead tried goading Rey into a match at WrestleMania 39. Rey, however, affirmed his position that he would not fight his son. On the March 24 episode, the Mysterio family were in attendance for Rey's match, which he lost thanks to interference from Dominik. Afterwards, Dominik disrespected his mother and sister, forcing Rey to intervene and hit Dominik. Rey then accepted the challenge for a match at WrestleMania 39, which was scheduled for Night 1. During this time, Legado Del Fantasma (Santos Escobar, Joaquin Wilde, Cruz Del Toro, and Zelina Vega) assisted Rey against The Judgment Day. On the March 31 episode of \"SmackDown\", they said they would have Rey's back if Judgment Day tried interfering at WrestleMania and Rey revived the Latino World Order (LWO), a faction Rey was a member of in World Championship Wrestling.\nCanceled match.\nOn the \"SmackDown\" before Elimination Chamber, Bray Wyatt stated that at WrestleMania, he would be challenging the winner of the Brock Lesnar vs. Bobby Lashley match occurring at Elimination Chamber. Lashley would win the match by disqualification and on the following \"Raw\", he said that no one, including Wyatt, could break his Hurt Lock submission and stated that everyone needed to show him respect or else he would put them down. Wyatt then began playing head games with Lashley on subsequent episodes of \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\", which further enraged him. Lashley then appeared on the March 3 episode of \"SmackDown\" to confront Wyatt, but was instead confronted by Wyatt's accomplice Uncle Howdy, who Lashley fended off. However, later that month, with Wyatt absent, the angle was dropped. It was then reported that Wyatt was dealing with an undisclosed illness. On August 19, it was revealed that the illness was life-threatening, but he was making positive progress towards a return.

Ripley subsequently became the first woman to win the Raw, SmackDown, NXT, NXT UK, and WWE Women's Tag Team championships.\nWrestleMania hosts The Miz and Snoop Dogg then came out to announce the attendance for Night 1 of 80,497. Snoop Dogg then claimed that the only thing better than an attendance record is for Miz to compete in a match, just as Pat McAfee made his return in his first appearance since SummerSlam 2022. Snoop Dogg, as the co-host, made the match official. During the match, McAfee dominated The Miz. In the closing moments of the impromptu penultimate match, The Miz shoved San Francisco 49ers player George Kittle, who was a seated at ringside. Kittle then jumped the barricade and struck The Miz, unbeknownst to the referee. McAfee then delivered a Swanton off the top turnbuckle to the Miz.

Owens performed the Stunner on Jimmy, and Zayn delivered one more Helluva Kick to Jey to win the titles and end The Usos' 622 day reign as SmackDown Tag Team Champions. As a result of this win, Owens became a Grand Slam Champion, as well as the first Quebec-born Grand Slam Champion in history; as for both Zayn and Owens, they became the first Quebec-born wrestlers to win a tag team championship since The Quebecers (Jacques Rougeau and Pierre Carl Ouellet) accomplished the feat 30 years prior to this event.\nNight 2.\nPreliminary matches.\nWrestleMania Sunday began with The Miz and Snoop Dogg hyping up the crowd for the event for Night 2.\nIn the first match, Brock Lesnar fought Omos (accompanied by MVP).

Miz then stated that he was not ready to compete in a match the previous night, and Snoop Dogg caught him off guard. Miz then boasted about competing in a suit and which prompted a returning Shane McMahon, in his first appearance since the 2022 Royal Rumble, to come out and challenge Miz. Snoop Dogg then officiated the match, however, McMahon would legitimately tear his quadriceps during the match, thus the match was stopped. In an improvised moment, Snoop Dogg then came into the ring and challenged Miz, punching him twice and performing a People's Elbow to win the impromptu match. This made The Miz the first wrestler to lose matches on both nights of WrestleMania since the event switched to a two-night format in 2020.\nIn the penultimate match, Edge battled \"The Demon\" Finn Bálor in a Hell in a Cell match.

Rhodes then performed Cross Rhodes on Reigns for a nearfall. Rhodes countered a Superman Punch attempt into a Pedigree for a nearfall. After a sunset flip attempt resulted in a nearfall, Rhodes applied the figure-four leglock on Reigns. Reigns was able to reverse the pressure, but Rhodes reached the ropes to void the submission. As Rhodes leapt off the top rope, Reigns moved out of the way and performed a Spear on Rhodes for a nearfall. Reigns followed up with forearm strikes and applied the Guillotine Choke, but Rhodes was able to escape. Rhodes went to kick Reigns, who dodged and Rhodes accidentally kicked the referee, incapacitating him. Reigns and Rhodes then knocked themselves out with simultaneous clotheslines. Rhodes made it to his feet first and as he attempted a DDT, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) ran in and attacked Rhodes, performing a 1D on him, only for Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn to make the save, with the two teams brawling into the crowd. Before that, Owens performed a Stunner on Reigns, followed by a Helluva Kick by Zayn on Reigns. With the referee back, Rhodes then covered Reigns for another nearfall. In the closing moments, Reigns and Rhodes exchanged more strikes. Rhodes countered a Superman Punch attempt, performed a Bionic Elbow, and followed up with two more Cross Rhodes. As Rhodes was preparing for a third Cross Rhodes, Heyman distracted the referee, allowing Sikoa to sneak in and perform the Samoan Spike on Rhodes. Reigns then performed a final spear on Rhodes to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. This marked the seventh time a heel won the main event of WrestleMania, including three in a row for Reigns.\nReception.\nWrestleMania 39 was the highest-grossing WWE event in history, generating a gate of $21.6 million. Although WWE claimed attendance numbers of 80,497 on Night 1 and 81,395 on Night 2 (161,892 total), wrestling journalist and historian Dave Meltzer contested these figures, saying they sold 67,303 and 67,553 tickets respectively, with maximum capacities of 67,530 and 67,603. Over the two days, more than 500 million views and 11 million hours of video content was streamed via social media. The event also received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship match, the Men's WrestleMania Showcase match, Logan Paul vs. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, Rey Mysterio vs. Dominik Mysterio, and the Hell in a Cell match. The SmackDown Women's Championship match was also lauded by critics, with professional wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer calling it \"among the best women's matches in WWE history\". However, while the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match was also praised, its ending was criticized for its repetitiveness. Meltzer gave five-star ratings to both the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship match on Night 1 and the Intercontinental Championship match on Night 2; these were the first WrestleMania matches to be awarded five stars by Meltzer since Bret Hart vs. \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin at WrestleMania 13 in 1997.\nWrestleMania 39 generated $215 million in economic impact for the Los Angeles region, breaking the previous year's record of $206.5 million in economic impact for the Dallas/Arlington region.\nWade Keller of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" gave the Night 2 main event match 4.5 stars, stating, \"What a story they told, and they had the crowd every step of the way\". There may have been \"too many shenanigans with ref bumps and interference\", but Keller \"wouldn't have been against WWE betting on Cody and going with him here\". He also said that \"they could think it wasn't time for Cody, but that's not necessarily a vote of no confidence since they could also see money in a rematch or two as \"the chase\" continues\". He concluded by stating that WWE accomplished \"fans reacting to near falls and the back and forth the way they did and care deeply about the finish\". Shakiel Mahjouri of \"CBS Sports\" gave the match an A+ grade, calling it \"a truly fantastic outing that had the crowd in the palm of the superstars' hands\". He stated that \"the outcome subverted expectations and it will be interesting to see where WWE takes things from here\".\nAs part of their year-end professional wrestling awards, ESPN named WrestleMania 39 as the Best PPV Event of the Year for 2023. Of \"Bleacher Report\"s 10 best WWE and AEW matches of 2023, the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match was ranked #8, the SmackDown Women's Championship match #6, the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship match #4, and the Intercontinental Championship match #1.\nAuschwitz imagery controversy.\nDuring the pre-show, WWE showed footage of the Auschwitz death camp in a video promoting the match between Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio. After the footage was used in reference to a staged video purporting to depict Dominik Mysterio's past jail time, the National Holocaust Museum issued a statement condemning WWE for exploiting holocaust imagery. Despite the apology, Holocaust historians remained concerned, with history professor Natalie Belsky telling the \"Washington Post\" \"Using imagery associated with the Holocaust for essentially what is kind of entertainment purposes can be seen as minimizing what happened and failing to recognize how horrific it was\".\nAftermath.\nSince January 2023, there had been speculation that WWE had been placed up for sale. Hours before WrestleMania 39 Night 2 began, CNBC reported via multiple sources that a deal between WWE and Endeavor, the parent company of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), was imminent. The deal involved a merger of WWE with the UFC into a new publicly traded company, with Endeavor holding a 51% stake. The sale was confirmed the next day on April 3. WrestleMania 39 subsequently became the final WrestleMania in which WWE was still owned and controlled by the McMahon family. The sale closed on September 12, 2023, with WWE and UFC subsequently becoming divisions of a new entity called TKO Group Holdings.\nRaw.\nTriple H opened the post-WrestleMania episode of \"Raw\", stating that despite the news about WWE (referencing Endeavor's purchase), nothing would change with the product, after which, he introduced Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns, who was accompanied by Paul Heyman and Solo Sikoa. Cody Rhodes interrupted and said Reigns only won because of Sikoa and then challenged Reigns to a rematch, but Reigns declined. Rhodes then challenged Reigns and Sikoa to a tag team match later that night, and Reigns accepted. Heyman then issued a condition that Rhodes' partner was someone who competed at WrestleMania 39 but also that person could not challenge Reigns for his titles as long as Reigns was champion. Brock Lesnar answered, with the latter stipulation not applying to him as he was already banned from challenging Reigns due to the stipulation of their 2022 SummerSlam match. However, the match never occurred due to Lesnar viciously assaulting Rhodes before the match could begin. This eventually led to a match between Lesnar and Rhodes at Backlash, which Rhodes won. They had two more matches; at Night of Champions, Lesnar won when he made Rhodes pass out to the Kimura lock, and at SummerSlam, Rhodes was victorious. Afterwards, he was endorsed by Lesnar. Reigns and Rhodes then went face-to-face for the first time since the \"Raw\" after WrestleMania on the October 13 episode of \"SmackDown\".\nRhodes then went on to win the men's Royal Rumble match at the 2024 Royal Rumble to earn a rematch against Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania XL. Despite involvement from The Rock and Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, Rhodes defeated Reigns in a rematch in the main event of WrestleMania XL Night 2 to become the new Undisputed WWE Universal Champion.\nAlso on \"Raw\", Rey Mysterio talked about his win over his son, Dominik, only for United States Champion Austin Theory to interrupt. This led to a non-title match immediately afterwards, where Theory was victorious after interference from Dominik. After the match, Dominik's Judgment Day stablemate Damian Priest attacked Bad Bunny, who was seated at ringside, and chokeslammed him through an announce table. On the April 24 episode, Bad Bunny returned and announced that although he was originally to be the host of Backlash, he would instead be facing Priest in a street fight at the event.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following \"SmackDown\", Sami Zayn still felt as if he could get through to Jey Uso and faced him in the main event of \"SmackDown\". Prior to the match backstage, Kevin Owens was attacked backstage by Solo Sikoa. Jey defeated Zayn after interference from Sikoa. Afterwards, Sikoa continued to attack Zayn until Jey stopped him only to attack Zayn himself. Matt Riddle then made the save due to his past history with The Bloodline, as Sikoa had sidelined Riddle back in December (kayfabe). The following week, Zayn and Owens' promo was interrupted by The Usos (Jey and Jimmy Uso) and Sikoa. Afterwards, a brawl broke out, with Zayn, Owens, and Riddle standing tall. On April 17, a six-man tag team match pitting The Bloodline (The Usos and Sikoa) against Riddle, Zayn, and Owens was scheduled for Backlash. It was also announced that Zayn and Owens would defend the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship against The Usos in a rematch on the April 28 episode, where Owens and Zayn retained.\nAlso on \"SmackDown\", Triple H announced that the WWE Draft would be returning. The dates for the 2023 draft were revealed the following week, beginning on the April 28 episode of \"SmackDown\" and concluding with the May 1 episode of \"Raw\". Draft results went into effect with the \"Raw\" after Backlash on May 8.\nDuring the draft, Asuka and Raw Women's Champion Bianca Belair were drafted to SmackDown. On the May 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", Asuka spat green mist to Belair. This set up a championship rematch between the two for Night of Champions.\nAlso on \"SmackDown\", The Brawling Brutes (Sheamus, Ridge Holland, and Butch) defeated Imperium (Intercontinental Champion Gunther, Ludwig Kaiser, and Giovanni Vinci) in a six-man tag team match. Imperium and Drew McIntyre were then drafted to Raw during the 2023 WWE Draft. McIntyre returned at Money in the Bank, where he attacked Gunther after the latter's successful title defense. This led to a title match between McIntyre and Gunther at SummerSlam, where Gunther retained."

        "text": "The men's points race, or “Course de Primes,” was a track cycling event at the 1900 Summer Olympics. The competition was held on 15 September 1900 at the Vélodrome de Vincennes. There were 13 competitors from 3 nations. The event was won by Enrico Brusoni of Italy, who won 5 of the laps including the last one. Karl Duill of Germany placed second, with Louis Trousselier of France third.\nBackground.\nThis was the first appearance of the event. It would not be held again until 1984; after that, it was held every Summer Games until 2008 when it was removed from the programme. The women's version was held from 1996 through 2008.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was broadly similar to the modern points race, but with significant differences. The event was 5 kilometres in length, with points awarded at each lap (prime) to the first three cyclists to finish the lap: 3 to the first to finish the lap, 2 to the second, and 1 to the third. The cyclist with the most points was the victor. On the last lap, the points were tripled: 9 to the winner of the race, 6 to second place, and 3 to third place.\nA single race was held, with all cyclists starting together.\nResults.\nThe event was held on 15 September. Ferdinand Vasserot won the first lap, but failed to gain more than 1 more point the rest of the way. Enrico Brusoni won the second and third laps to move into the lead with 6 points, with Louis Trousselier behind him on both of those laps for 4 points and second place. J. Bérard was the fourth-lap winner, moving between Brusoni and Trousselier with 5 points. Brusoni won the fifth lap to increase his lead, 9 points to Bérard's 5 and Trousselier's 4.\nThe sixth and seventh laps went to Karl Duill, bringing him to 7 points and second place only 2 points behind Brusoni; Trousselier picked up 2 points on the sixth to stay in third place as Bérard dropped to fourth. The top three spots would not change again after that. Brusoni re-extended his lead on the eighth lap, winning it to place him at 12 points to Duill's 7. In the ninth lap, Trousselier won with Duill behind him; this brought them both to 9 points, only 3 points behind Brusoni. \nBrusoni finished strong, however, with a win on the triple-value final lap for 9 points to take the top overall score at 21 points. Neither Duill nor Trousselier was able to score on that final lap. Duill held a tie-breaker over Trousselier, taking second place. Chaput's second-place finish on the last lap brought him 1 point behind the medalists."

        "text": "Horse racing was introduced to Thailand in the late nineteenth century and continues to take place at several locations throughout the country. Betting on horse races is one of the few legal forms of gambling in Thailand, and the sport became highly popular during the mid-twentieth century but has largely declined since. Today, people from lower income groups form the majority of spectators, while the races serve as a networking venue for elite members of society, who own most of the stables.\nHistory.\nThe first horse race took place in Thailand (then known as Siam) in 1897, following King Chulalongkorn's visit to Europe. Racecourses were soon after established in exclusive sports clubs, most notably the Royal Bangkok Sports Club (RBSC), founded in 1901. The Royal Turf Club followed in 1916.\nHorse racing originally catered to Western expatriates and Thai aristocrats. It was seen as a civilized activity, and betting was allowed even when other traditional forms of gambling were becoming outlawed. The sport spread to other societal groups in the 1920s, and rapidly gained in popularity. As a result, it began to be viewed as a form of immorality. In 1949, the government ordered that races take place no more than once a week in Bangkok.\nToward the end of the twentieth century, horse racing experienced a gradual decline as races became more restricted and other forms of (illegal) gambling gained popularity. Several racecourses underwent restructuring and/or change of ownership in the 1990s. The Royal Turf Club in Bangkok shut down in 2018. Today, six of eight racecourses throughout the country remain operational. In addition to the one left in Bangkok, there are racecourses in Nakhon Ratchasima, Udon Thani, Khon Kaen, Roi Et and Chiang Mai provinces. (The one in Maha Sarakham has since closed down.)"

Lane played club rugby with University College Cork, represented the Munster provincial team, was capped 17 times for Ireland, and was a member of the Lions team that toured in 1950.\nEarly life.\nLane was born in Cork, Ireland on April 3, 1926.\nRugby career.\nLane made his international début for Ireland in March 1947 against Wales in the Five Nations Championship. Injury kept him out of the 1948 Five Nations Championship, but he played in all four of Ireland's matches during the 1949 Championship that saw them clinch the title and the Triple Crown. Lane made his only appearance for the Barbarians invitational team in April 1949 against Cardiff during their Easter tour.\nFollowing three more appearances for Ireland in the 1950 Five Nations Championship, Lane was included in the Lions squad that was selected to tour New Zealand and Australia in 1950. Lane played in a total of 11 matches during the tour, including a test match against both New Zealand and Australia with the other nine appearances in tour matches against local opposition.\nFollowing the death of Lewis Jones in March 2024, Lane became the last surviving member of the 1950 Lions touring team. \nLane made three appearances in the 1951 Five Nations that again saw Ireland win the Championship, and played twice against South Africa in December that year as part of their tour of Europe. The first was in the test match for Ireland, and the second was in a tour game representing his province of Munster.\nIn the second of his two appearances in the 1952 Five Nations, Lane scored his only points for Ireland with a try against Scotland. His final appearances for Ireland came during the 1953 Five Nations.\nLane was inducted into the Rugby Writers of Ireland Hall of Fame in 2011. Lane's nephew, Michael Kiernan, was also an Ireland and Lions international."

        "title": "James Forrest (basketball)",
        "text": "James Curtnyle Forrest (born August 13, 1972) is an American former professional basketball player.\nHigh school career.\nHe was born in Charleston, South Carolina but he then moved to Atlanta, Georgia with his family and attended Southside High School (now Maynard H. Jackson) there. He established himself as one of the top recruits of the state of Georgia and as a sophomore he was named Mr. Georgia Basketball; he won the award again the following year, having been part of the Southside team that won the state championship in 1990, winning the final game against Columbia with a final record of 31–2. In his senior year at Southside High he averaged 30.5 points and 11.4 rebounds, and scored 55 points and grabbed 19 rebounds in a playoff semifinals game against Dougherty on March 8, 1991 during the state championship. He was also a two-time Georgia Gatorade Player of the Year (1990 and 1991). He was ranked among the top 10 seniors in the nation by most scouting reports. During his high school career he scored more than 2,000 points; scout Bob Gibbons compared Forrest to Larry Johnson due to similarities in size, scoring ability and physical strength. In 1991 he was also named in the \"Parade\" All-America First Team and was a McDonald's All-American. In the McDonald's All-American Game of 1991 he was the top scorer of the East team and the second highest scorer of the game (only Chris Webber had more points, with 28), and also added 10 rebounds. In March 1991 Forrest announced his commitment to play for Georgia Tech.\nCollege career.\nForrest and point guard Travis Best were considered the top two freshmen of the 1991–92 Georgia Tech team that had lost its star player, Kenny Anderson, who decided to declare for the 1991 NBA draft. They both started in the team along with Jon Barry, Malcolm Mackey and Matt Geiger. Forrest scored 16 points in his debut on November 20, 1991 against James Madison. Forrest had a very good season, being the third top scorer (13.3) and the third best rebounder (6.4) in the team. While he mainly played as power forward and center during his high school career, the presence of Mackey made him move to the small forward position. Forrest's freshman season is also remembered for one of the most iconic buzzer beaters in the history of the NCAA Tournament: during the Midwest Regional second-round game against USC, Georgia Tech was losing 78–76. With 0.8 seconds remaining, Geiger inbounded the ball to Forrest, who scored a 3-point shot (his only one of the season, having missed the previous 3 attempts) for a 79–78 win that qualified Georgia Tech for the Sweet 16.\nForrest improved significantly in his sophomore year and became the top scorer of the team during the 1992–93 season with an average of 19.5 points. He won the Everett Case Award as the MVP of the 1993 ACC men's basketball tournament and was an honorable mention in the All-ACC selection at the end of the season. At some point before the 1993 NBA draft, it seemed that Forrest could be planning to declare early for the draft, and some mock drafts predicted him to be a top-15 pick, but he decided to stay at Georgia Tech and continue to play college basketball. His junior season saw the departure of Mackey, and Forrest became the top rebounder of the team, and once again he was the top scorer, with Georgia Tech finishing 6th in the ACC conference. In March 1994 he was named in the All-ACC First team. Forrest's senior season was marked by his best rebounding average (8.3), but his scoring declined (18.8 points), while his teammate Travis Best scored 20.2. At the end of the season he was named in the All-ACC Third team and was an NCAA All-American honorable mention.\nProfessional career.\nAfter the end of his senior season, Forrest was automatically eligible for the 1995 NBA draft. While his teammate Best was selected with the 23rd pick by the Indiana Pacers, Forrest was not drafted, and in August had to undergo surgery for an injury to the Achilles tendon. He came back in 1996, and since he did not find a team in the United States, he began his professional career abroad. His first team was Hapoel Eilat of the Israeli top division. He averaged 14.5 points and 7.8 rebounds in 20 games during the 1996–97season, with a season high of 26 points versus Hapoel Holon. In July 1997 he was signed by the Los Angeles Lakers, but he was cut in October and he did not make the final roster. He then moved to Spain, signing with Ciudad the Huelva of Liga ACB in November 1997, and played 12 games averaging 18.8 points (with a season high of 31) and 5.9 rebounds. He moved to Italy for the following season, playing for Mabo Pistoia where he averaged 19.6 points and 9.3 rebounds in 37.0 minutes of playing time. The club did not participate in the following season and Forrest moved to Greece, signing a deal with Iraklio. He played 4 consecutive seasons in the Greek league, changing team every year: Iraklio, Aris Thessaloniki, Olympiacos (where he had the chance to play in the EuroLeague where he averaged 12.5 points and 6.0 rebounds) and Olympia Larissa.\nHe briefly came back to Spain in 2003 and played 1 game with Unicaja Málaga, then played once more for Itaklio where he averaged 17.5 points and 7.2 rebounds.\n He then played in Italy for 2 more seasons, and retired in 2005 after having played for Fabriano."

Later that year coach Steve Borthwick included him in the squad for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. He scored a try on his only appearance of the tournament in a pool stage game against Chile. However a neck injury sustained by Willis in that match ruled him out of the rest of the competition."

        "title": "1902 Metropolitan Rugby Union season",
        "text": "The 1902 Metropolitan Rugby Union season was the 29th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. It was the third season run for clubs that represented a district. Eight clubs (seven representing a district, the remaining club representing Sydney University) competed from May till August 1902. The season culminated in the third district premiership, which was won by Western Suburbs. Western Suburbs were crowned premiers by virtue of finishing the season on top of the table.\nTeams.\nEight clubs contested the season; seven clubs representing a district and one club representing Sydney University.\nSeason Summary.\nThe 1902 Sydney Rugby Premiership saw a popular win for the Western Suburbs District Football Club. The club had experienced the unfortunate and sad loss of their captain, William Shortland, at the end of the previous season. During the season, the team recovered from this huge loss to display improvement in defence, with only 4 tries scored against them over the final 7 rounds. Three-Quarter, Stanley Wickham demonstrated the importance of having a great goal kicker in the team, scoring 11 field goals during the season with 5 scored in one game against South Sydney.\nGlebe opened the season in magnificent form defeating the two teams that eventually finished above them on the ladder. However, as the season progressed the team was required to shift players around due to injuries to important members of the team. As a result, over the final four rounds Glebe drew with North Sydney, drew with Western Suburbs and lost the penultimate match to University 6 to 4. This meant that they were out of contention for the premiership in the final round.\nThe final round of the season had been originally scheduled for 26 July and was postponed to the end of August due to heavy and persistent rain. This meant that for the last round of games for the season, the two teams in contention for the premiership would face each other in a \"final\". In order that representatives in both teams be able to depart on time for the intercolonial matches in Queensland, the game was scheduled for Wednesday, 27 August at 2pm. Again rain interfered with the quality of the game which resulted in Western Suburbs winning against Sydney University 4 points to 3.\nAt the conclusion of the season, the rugby world lost another significant player with the death of former University captain Horace Jones. Jones had previously captained the NSW team in intercolonial matches and had retired from rugby at the end of the 1901 season due to ill health. His cause of death was sarcoma, a soft tissue cancer.\nLower Grades.\nThe MRFU also conducted Second Grade and Boroughs competitions this season.\nSecond Grade.\nThe eight First grade clubs entered a team each into the Second Grade competition. The season concluded with a final game between Glebe and Eastern Suburbs that was practically a final. The game ended in a draw. However, Glebe were declared premiers as they were one point ahead of Eastern Suburbs on the ladder.\nBoroughs Competition.\nSixteen teams participated in the first Boroughs Competition. This was a competition for teams that did not necessarily represent a district. Non-district teams acted as a feeder club for the larger district teams. These teams were: Manly, Glebe, Gipps, Willoughby, Surry Hills, Rockdale, Balmain, Newtown, Leichhardt, Burwood, Marrickville, University, Annandale, North Sydney, Mosman and Parramatta. At the conclusion of the season, Manly sat undefeated at the top of the table and were thus declared Premiers."

Eight clubs (seven representing a district, the remaining club representing Sydney University) competed from May till August 1903. The season culminated in the fourth district premiership, which was won by Eastern Suburbs. Eastern Suburbs were crowned premiers by virtue of finishing the season on top of the table.\nTeams.\nEight clubs contested the season; seven clubs representing a district and one club representing Sydney University.\nSeason Summary.\nThe success of Eastern Suburbs in the 1903 Sydney Rugby Premiership was popular with the football public. This was mostly due to the fact that the club were first-time winners and played the game in a sporting fashion. The team displayed excellent defence, letting in only eight tries during the season. Eastern Suburbs opened the season by defeating Glebe by 4 points to 3, and that victory proved a highly important one to both teams, as, at the close, there was one competition point between them. From start to finish of the season, Eastern Suburbs either held the leading position or shared the lead with another club.\nGlebe, who finished second, were the only team who scored at least one try in every match. The club finished strongly by winning the last 6 rounds of the season. As a pack they were superior to that of any other team, excepting Eastern Suburbs. At no time did they equal the best of their form in other seasons.\nAfter a bit of a slow start to the season, Newtown began to display outstanding brilliance in attack. This led them to move quickly up the ladder and finish the season in a strong third place. Newtown were the most brilliant all-round team in the competition, yet lacked that solidity.\nAt the conclusion of the season, the Rugby world saw the shock death of another of their players. Wallace Millican, three-quarter for Newtown, died of blood poisoning on 30 August after spending most of the week confined to his bed. Millican was 21 years old and hugely popular amongst the Newtown followers.\nLower Grades.\nThe MRFU also conducted Second Grade and Boroughs competitions this season.\nSecond Grade.\nTen teams participated in the Second Grade competition: the eight First Grade clubs entered a team each, in addition two Boroughs clubs, Willoughby and Manly, were permitted to each enter a team. The season concluded with Newtown undefeated at the top of the table by a margin of 8 points. They were therefore declared premiers.\nBoroughs Competition.\nSeventeen teams participated in the Boroughs Competition. The teams were split into two divisions of nine teams. In Division A was North Sydney, Willoughby, Mosman, Manly, East Sydney, Surrey Hills, Redfern, Balmain and Gipps. In Division B was Newtown, University, Waterloo, Rockdale, Glebe, Annandale, Leichhardt and Ashfield. At the end of the regular games, North Sydney finished at the top of Division A and Glebe finished at the top of Division B. The final saw Gipps beat Balmain 11 points to 6 to take the premiership."

        "text": "The final tournament of the 1934 FIFA World Cup was a single-elimination tournament involving the 16 teams which qualified for the tournament. The tournament began with the round of 16 on 27 May and concluded with the final on 10 June 1934. Italy won the final 2–1 for their first World Cup title.\n\"All times are in Central European Time ().\"\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nRound of 16.\nSpain vs Brazil.\nBrazil – who had only kept Carvalho Leite from the squad participating in the previous edition of the World Cup – were outclassed by Spain in the first half, who scored thrice. In the second half, Spanish players played more complacently. Leônidas pulled one back for Brazil, then he scored again moments later, but the goal was disallowed for offside. Later, Ricardo Zamora saved a penalty from Waldemar de Brito.\n&lt;section begin=R16-1 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-1 /&gt;\nHungary vs Egypt.\nHungary scored twice in 31 minutes. Rather than being disheartened, Egypt showed a positive attitude and leveled with two goals from Abdulrahman Fawzi. In the second half, Hungary played better and dictated the tempo, scoring two more goals and deserving to reach the quarter-finals.\n&lt;section begin=R16-2 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-2 /&gt;\nSwitzerland vs Netherlands.\nNetherlands were narrowly defeated by Switzerland. Switzerland took an early lead thanks to Leopold Kielholz finishing off a good piece of play from André Abegglen. Netherlands equalised with Kick Smit, who converted a free-kick by Puck van Heel. Kielholz restored the Swiss advantage before half-time with a long-range effort. After the interval, the lead was extended thanks to Abegglen's goal. Netherlands frequently threatened the Swiss goal, scoring one from a free-kick, but Switzerland held on for the victory.\n&lt;section begin=R16-3 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-3 /&gt;\nItaly vs United States.\nA superior Italian team had a comfortable victory against the United States, which had played against Mexico in the qualifying just three days earlier. Schiavio scored two goals in the first half, one of which was from more than 30 yards out. A good performance from the US goalkeeper Julius Hjulian did not prevent Italy scoring seven goals before the final whistle.\n&lt;section begin=R16-4 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-4 /&gt;\nCzechoslovakia vs Romania.\nRomania were the underdogs, yet they went ahead after just 11 minutes with a close range goal from Ștefan Dobay. After Silviu Bindea missed an opportunity to double Romania's advantage, Czechoslovakia scored twice and held on for the victory.\n&lt;section begin=R16-5 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-5 /&gt;\nSweden vs Argentina.\nArgentina proved a shadow of the team that was finalist in the 1930 World Cup. In fact, they presented a roster of newcomers as only Alfredo Devincenzi and Arcadio López were previously capped by the team. Argentina took the lead with a 25-yard free kick by Ernesto Belis. A more organised Sweden team soon equalized with Sven Jonasson. Argentina showed an excellent attacking prowess and went ahead again with an individual effort from Alberto Galateo. However, an efficient Sweden team took advantage of the defensive weakness of Argentina to score twice before the final whistle and hold on for the victory.\n&lt;section begin=R16-6 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=R16-6 /&gt;\nAustria vs France.\nFrance took the lead with a goal from Jean Nicolas, who had suffered a head injury in the early stages of the match. Austria drew level on the brink of half time thanks to a goal from the star Matthias Sindelar. An uneventful second half followed, so the match became the first in the history of World Cup to go to extra time. In the extra time, Austria prevailed and scored twice before France got a late second goal from the spot.\n&lt;section begin=R16-7 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-7 /&gt;\nGermany vs Belgium.\nA clinical Germany took their chance to achieve a scoreline that did not reflect the balance of the game. Belgium closed the first half in the lead, however, Germany came out stronger from the dressing room and overturned the results. Edmund Conen scored a hat-trick.\n&lt;section begin=R16-8 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-8 /&gt;\nQuarter-finals.\nAustria vs Hungary.\nAn extremely tough game prevented the two teams from truly showing the technical skills they possessed. Austria took an early lead with Johann Horvath, who finished a well-organised team move. Austria doubled their lead in the early stages of the second half. Shortly after, Hungary got one back thanks to a penalty caused by Karl Sesta. The match hung in the balance until Hungary lost two players: Imre Markos was red carded and István Avar got injured. After that, Austria comfortably cruised to the victory.\n&lt;section begin=QF1 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF1 /&gt;\nItaly vs Spain.\nThe first game between Italy and Spain was one of the most contentious and marred by several poor refereeing decisions, especially seeing Italy players challenging roughly the goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora. Spain went ahead with Luis Regueiro, but their lead did not last long. Italy equalized when Giovanni Ferrari knocked in a rebound, while Zamora was blocked off by Schiavio. The tie required a replay to settle.\n&lt;section begin=QF2 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF2 /&gt;\nGermany vs Sweden.\nPouring rain influenced the match, which saw very few notable moments in the first half. In the second half, Ernst Andersson suffered a head injury, and Germany took the lead with Karl Hohmann while the Swedish player was off. Hohmann scored again three minutes later. Sweden managed to get a goal back, but their subsequent efforts were not enough and Germany progressed to the first of many semi-finals.\n&lt;section begin=QF3 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF3 /&gt;\nCzechoslovakia vs Switzerland.\nIn a well-balanced game, Switzerland took the lead with Kielholz thanks to a counter-attacking play. Czechoslovakia equalized soon after with František Svoboda, who turned a chance created by Jiří Sobotka into a goal. In the second half, although Switzerland dominated the ball possession, it was Czechoslovakia scoring twice and holding on for the victory.\n&lt;section begin=QF4 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF4 /&gt;\nReplay: Italy vs Spain.\nThe replay was played the day after the first game. The exhaustion and the injuries resulting from the first tie forced Italy and Spain to make four and seven changes respectively. Most notably, the experienced Zamora had to give way to the uncapped goalkeeper Juan José Nogués. Once again, the game was marred by controversial refereeing decisions. In the first five minutes, Crisant Bosch was hacked down by Eraldo Monzeglio in the penalty box. The penalty was not given, but the tackle resulted in the injury of Bosch. With no substitutes available, Spain had to play the remainder of the game with 10 men. Giuseppe Meazza scored soon after from a corner kick situation. In the second half, two Spanish goals were disallowed: one for offside and the other for a foul on a Spanish player. The referee, René Mercet, was suspended in the aftermath of the tournament.\n&lt;section begin=QF2r /&gt;&lt;section end=QF2r /&gt;\nSemi-finals.\nItaly vs Austria.\nA torrential downpour hampered the Austrians' passing game while benefiting the more varied Italian game. Italy took the lead when a ball broke free from the Austrian goalkeeper because of an intervention by Giuseppe Meazza. The ball then hit the post and was turned into goal by a perfectly positioned Enrique Guaita. In the second half, Austrian efforts to equalize were stopped by Gianpiero Combi, and Italy managed to hold on for the victory.\n&lt;section begin=SF1 /&gt;&lt;section end=SF1 /&gt;\nCzechoslovakia vs Germany.\nThe game proved to be a clash of styles, with a more technical Czechoslovakia facing a physical German side. Czechoslovakia took the lead in the first half, but Germany drew level in the second half when František Plánička could not keep out a tame shot by Rudolf Noack. The Germany goal stimulated the Czechoslovakian side. Czechoslovakia took advantage of their finesse and attacking prowess to score twice with Oldřich Nejedlý, who completed a hat-trick.\n&lt;section begin=SF2 /&gt;&lt;section end=SF2 /&gt;\nThird place play-off.\nBoth teams changed their usual line-ups, resting several players. Austrian players wore an unusual light blue jersey borrowed from Napoli because of the clash of colours between the two traditional jerseys. Germany took the lead inside 25 seconds with the fastest goal of the tournament, scored by Ernst Lehner. They doubled the lead with Edmund Conen, but Austria got one back immediately after with Johann Horvath. Germany's third goal came after Karl Sesta attempted to sit on the ball to ridicule a German player; the ball was stolen by Conen, who crossed to Lehner. Sesta then scored a goal, but Germany held on for the victory.\n&lt;section begin=TPP /&gt;&lt;section end=TPP /&gt;"

        "text": "The final tournament of the 1938 FIFA World Cup was a single-elimination tournament involving the 16 teams which qualified for the tournament. The tournament began with the round of 16 on 4 June and concluded with the final on 19 June 1938. Italy won the final 4–2 for their second World Cup title.\n\"All times are in Western European Summer Time ().\"\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nRound of 16.\nSwitzerland vs Germany.\nSwitzerland adopted a precursor version of the \"Catenaccio\" system to try stopping the talented German forwards. Thanks to this tactical system, the Swiss managed to frustrate the Germans despite going behind after a goal from Gauchel. Switzerland drew level with Abegglen after a mistake from Willibald Schmaus. Although the Germans pushed for the win, the game ended with a draw, forcing a replay.\n&lt;section begin=R16-1 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-1 /&gt;\nHungary vs Dutch East Indies.\nThe difference in strength between the two teams was evident as the game resulted in a humiliation for the Dutch East Indies, which managed to hold out for just 13 minutes. In the second half, although Hungary relaxed their pressure, they were never truly troubled by the opponents.\n&lt;section begin=R16-2 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-2 /&gt;\nSweden vs Austria.\nAustria did not participate due to the Anschluss, so Sweden qualified directly to the quarter-finals.\n&lt;section begin=R16-3 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-3 /&gt;\nCuba vs Romania.\nCuba, who had only qualified because other Latin American selections had withdrawn, impressed against Romania. Romania scored first thanks to a goal that different sources attribute to either Silviu Bindea or Nicolae Kovács. Cuba drew level through Héctor Socorro, who converted a cross from José Magriñá and then took the lead with a goal from Magriñá himself. However, equalisers from Iuliu Baratky and Ștefan Dobay forced a replay.\n&lt;section begin=R16-4 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-4 /&gt;\nFrance vs Belgium.\nThe hosts took the lead with only 35 seconds on the clock thanks to a shot from close range by winger Émile Veinante. France doubled their advantage soon after, but the lead was halved before the interval thanks to Hendrik Isemborghs, who connected with a free kick from Bernard Voorhoof. In the second half, Jean Nicolas got his brace, sealing the victory for France.\n&lt;section begin=R16-5 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-5 /&gt;\nItaly vs Norway.\nMindful of the game played against Norway at the semi-finals of the 1936 Summer Olympics, when Italy managed to scrap a win only during extra time, Vittorio Pozzo was not to be overconfident. Italy managed to grab an early lead with Pietro Ferraris, but struggle to threaten Norway's goal further besides hitting the post once. In the second half, Norway was the better team, hitting the woodwork thrice and finally drawing level in the 83rd minute. Soon inside the extra time, Silvio Piola converted in goal a rebounded shot. Italy managed to hold out for the remaining time, reaching the quarter-finals.\n&lt;section begin=R16-6 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-6 /&gt;\nBrazil vs Poland.\n&lt;section begin=R16-7 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-7 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups R16-7 /&gt;\n&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;\nMatch rules\nCzechoslovakia vs Netherlands.\nFinalist at the 1934 World Cup, Czechoslovakia faced a modest Dutch team. Czechoslovakia dominated the ball but did not manage to convert their possession into clear-cut chances against a defensively sound Dutch team. In fact, Czechoslovakia managed to take the lead only in extra-time through a long-range effort, scoring a further two goals by the end of the game.\n&lt;section begin=R16-8 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-8 /&gt;\nReplay: Switzerland vs Germany.\nThis replay was five days later. Switzerland used the same line-ups as the first game, while Germany made a few changes. Georges Aeby was injured after a few minutes, forcing Switzerland to play with 10 men. Germany took soon advantage, scoring twice. However, Switzerland reacted well, and with Aeby back on the pitch in the second half, completed a remarkable comeback.\n&lt;section begin=R16-1r /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-1r /&gt;\nReplay: Cuba vs Romania.\nThe performance of Cuba's replacement goalkeeper Juan Ayra was equally exceptional as the one from Benito Carvajales in the original match. Romania took the lead with Ștefan Dobay in the first half, but Cuba fought back and scored two goals in rapid succession soon after the beginning of the second and managed to hold on to the score against all odds and reach the quarter-finals.\n&lt;section begin=R16-4r /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-4r /&gt;\nQuarter-finals.\nHungary vs Switzerland.\nHungary looked like the stronger team as the Swiss were missing key players such as Georges Aeby and Severino Minelli. Hungary took the lead with a header from György Sárosi. The result was in doubt for most of the second half, until Gyula Zsengellér sealed the game with a long-range effort in the dying minutes. Switzerland's manager Karl Rappan resigned after the game.\n&lt;section begin=QF1 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF1 /&gt;\nSweden vs Cuba.\nThe result was never in doubt as Sweden was more accustomed to playing at this level. Gustav Wetterström netted a hat-trick before half-time, with the Cubans unable to deal with the relentless Swedish forward play, especially after Joaquín Arias was forced to leave the pitch injured. Tomás Fernández missed a penalty for Cuba.\n&lt;section begin=QF2 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF2 /&gt;\nItaly vs France.\nTitle-holders Italy met hosts France in what was considered one of the most enticing games of the tournament. Italy wore their Fascist affiliated black shirts despite the anti-Fascism protests that the team had received in France. Italy had a better start, scoring within the first nine minutes, but France levelled immediately. In the second half, France tried to control the ball but, in doing so, they left themselves open for the lethal Italian counter-attack. Silvio Piola scored a brace while unmarked, leading Italy to the semi-finals.\n&lt;section begin=QF3 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF3 /&gt;\nBrazil vs Czechoslovakia.\n&lt;section begin=QF4 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups QF4 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Lineups QF4 /&gt;\nReplay: Brazil vs Czechoslovakia.\nBecause of the troubling effect of the first game, which saw several players getting injured or sent off, both teams had to make many changes to their line-ups (nine for Brazil and five for Czechoslovakia). Czechoslovakia took the lead with Vlastimil Kopecký in the 25th minute, but in the second half, stand-in captain Leônidas levelled the score for Brazil. Soon after, the referee disallowed a goal by Karel Senecký, despite the Czechoslovak players stating that it had crossed the line. The European representative continued to attack following that moment, leaving space for the Brazilians to swiftly counter, which debutant Roberto took advantage of to score his nation's second goal.\n&lt;section begin=QF4r /&gt;&lt;section end=QF4r /&gt;\nSemi-finals.\nHungary vs Sweden.\nSweden took the lead after just 35 seconds, but that remained the only goal scored by them. Hungary quickly settled in control of the game, scoring thrice before half-time. Sweden, who had impressed in previous games, could not resist the vastly superior opponent, who scored two additional goals in the second half, cruising towards the final after a comfortable win.\n&lt;section begin=SF1 /&gt;&lt;section end=SF1 /&gt;\nItaly vs Brazil.\nThe narrative leading to this highly anticipated match was built around an overconfident Brazil, who had impressed in the previous three matches. However, Italy had a better start to the game, creating the best chances but finding a well-positioned Walter stopping their attacks. In the second half, Italy soon found the net with Colaussi, before being awarded a penalty following a foul in the box by Domingos da Guia, his third in the tournament. The penalty was calmly converted by Meazza. At 2–0, Brazil pushed forward to break the Italian defence, but only managed to score a goal in the 87th minute with Romeu scoring from a corner kick. Some tense moments followed, but Italy managed to hold out for the remaining time, reaching their second final in a row.\n&lt;section begin=SF2 /&gt;&lt;section end=SF2 /&gt;\nThird place play-off.\nSweden started on the front foot, taking a double lead inside 38 minutes. In the first half, Brazil looked uninspired until they got one back before half-time. In the second half, Brazil was reinvigorated and pushed for the comeback. In the second half, Leônidas scored twice and even let Patesko kick a penalty that he missed. Perácio secured the victory in the 80th minute.\n&lt;section begin=TPP /&gt;&lt;section end=TPP /&gt;"

A total of 16 teams competed in the knockout phase.\nFor the first time, the video assistant referee (VAR) system was used in the Champions League knockout phase.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).\nFormat.\nEach tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then extra time was played. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced under more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the winners were decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, which was played as a single match, if the score was level at the end of normal time, extra time was played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score was still level.\n&lt;section begin=Format /&gt;\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\nFor the quarter-finals and semi-finals, teams from the same city (e.g., Manchester City and Manchester United) were not scheduled to play at home on the same day or consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control. To avoid such scheduling conflict, if the two teams were drawn to play at home for the same leg, the order of legs of the tie involving the team which was not titleholders of Champions League or Europa League (or lower-tier, if both were continental titleholders), or the team with the lower domestic ranking in the qualifying season (if neither team were continental title holder, e.g. Manchester United for this season) was reversed from the original draw.\nQualified teams.\nThe knockout phase involved the 16 teams which qualified as winners and runners-up of each of the eight groups in the group stage.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nRound of 16.\nThe draw for the round of 16 was held on 17 December 2018, 12:00 CET.\nManchester United became the first team in UEFA Champions League history to advance after losing at home by two goals or more in the first leg. Including the European Cup era, only Ajax managed this feat, winning a play-off match they forced in the 1968–69 European Cup quarter-finals against Benfica after losing 1–3 in the first leg at home and winning 3–1 in the second leg away.\nSummary.\nThe first legs were played on 12, 13, 19 and 20 February, and the second legs were played on 5, 6, 12 and 13 March 2019.\n&lt;section begin=R16 /&gt;\nMatches.\n\"Manchester City won 10–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Juventus won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"3–3 on aggregate; Manchester United won on away goals.\"\n\"Tottenham Hotspur won 4–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Barcelona won 5–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Porto won 4–3 on aggregate.\"\n\"Ajax won 5–3 on aggregate.\"\n\"Liverpool won 3–1 on aggregate.\"\nQuarter-finals.\nThe draw for the quarter-finals was held on 15 March 2019, 12:00 CET.\nSummary.\nThe first legs were played on 9 and 10 April, and the second legs were played on 16 and 17 April 2019.\n&lt;section begin=QF /&gt;\nNotes\n&lt;section end=QF /&gt;\nMatches.\n\"Ajax won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Liverpool won 6–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"4–4 on aggregate; Tottenham Hotspur won on away goals.\"\n\"Barcelona won 4–0 on aggregate.\"\nSemi-finals.\nThe draw for the semi-finals was held on 15 March 2019, 12:00 CET (after the quarter-final draw).

Ronnie O'Sullivan defeated Ding Junhui 572–258 on points in a 30 minute time based unlimited racks final.\nVenue, entrants and prize money.\nPower Snooker's inaugural tournament was a one-day event hosted at The O2 in London, held on 30 October 2010. Each match lasted a total of 30 minutes with the balls constantly being reracked at the end of each rack until the 30 minutes was up. Two thousand spectators watched the eight hours of tournament play in the indigO2 sub-venue. The players in the inaugural tournament competed for a £35,000 first prize.\nO'Sullivan was the first player to be confirmed as participating in the inaugural tournament, which was announced during the official launch. It was stated during the launch that the inaugural tournament would feature the four top ranked players in the world, alongside four wild card entrants. The other seven entrants were confirmed on 24 September, matching the players who were mooted by the organisers during the launch as possible entrants. The tournament draw took place on 12 October, with O'Sullivan facing Brecel in the opening game.\nDraw.\nPlay occurred over two sessions in a knock-out format. The first round of eight games took place in an afternoon session, producing four semi-finalists. The semi-finals, third place play off and final then took place in an evening session.\nMatch referees.\nThe tournament was refereed by two female professional cue-sport referees, Michaela Tabb from Scotland and Patricia Murphy from Ireland. Tabb was head-referee at most Matchroom Sport pool events (including the World Pool Championship and Mosconi Cup), and the first woman to referee a world ranking match and, in 2009, a World Snooker Championship final; while Murphy began refereeing professional snooker matches at the 2005 UK Championships.\nTabb said on the eve of the tournament that \"Power Snooker is an entirely new game with a totally new set of rules and will provide many exciting challenges to both the referees and the players. The game will be played at a faster pace than the traditional game, it's going to be very exciting to watch\", while Murphy said \"It'll be great to see how the audience react and join in with the action\".\nBroadcast.\nThe 2010 tournament was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on ITV4 for the whole eight hours of play. Talksport provided radio coverage. In addition to ITV4, the tournament was broadcast to 25 other countries in Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, China, Latin America and Oceana."

In 2015, as a senior, he batted .402. He was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 38th round of the 2015 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign, instead choosing to attend California Polytechnic State University where he played college baseball for the Cal Poly Mustangs.\nAs a freshman at Cal Poly in 2016, McKenna batted .261 with six home runs in 45 games. After the season, he played for the Eau Claire Express of the Northwoods League. In 2017, as a sophomore, he started all 56 of Cal Poly's games and compiled a .360 batting average with five home runs, 31 RBIs, 13 steals, 45 runs scored, 11 doubles, and two triples. He was named to the All-Big West First Team after the season. That summer he played in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth–Dennis Red Sox where he batted .298 with nine doubles, 16 RBIs, and seven stolen bases in 124 at-bats, and was named a league all-star. In 2018, as a junior, McKenna batted .339 with five home runs, 31 RBIs, and a .930 OPS in 57 games. He was named the 2018 Big West Field Player of the Year along with being named to the All-Big West First Team for the second straight year.\nProfessional career.\nMcKenna was selected by the Houston Astros in the fourth round, with the 132nd overall selection, of the 2018 Major League Baseball draft and signed for $432,500. He made his professional debut that year for the Tri-City ValleyCats of the Low–A New York–Penn League and was named an All-Star. He was promoted to the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Single–A Midwest League in August. Over 44 games between Tri-City and Quad Cities, McKenna hit .311/.394/.512 with seven home runs and 28 RBIs. In 2019, McKenna returned to Quad Cities, but played in only 65 games due to injury; over those games, he batted .252/.327/.303 with one home run and twenty RBIs.\nMcKenna did not play a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. To begin the 2021 season, he was assigned to the Asheville Tourists of the High-A East. He was promoted to the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Double-A Central in late June. He missed nearly a month due to injury. Over 79 games between the two teams, he slashed .261/.356/.478 with 15 home runs and 46 RBIs. He was assigned to the Sugar Land Space Cowboys of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League to begin the 2022 season, but was demoted to Corpus Christi in mid-June.

It is the 24th season of pan-European professional club rugby competition. This competition is the first to be sponsored by Heineken since the 2013–14 season.\nThe tournament started on 12 October 2018. The final, featuring the last two winners of the event, Saracens and Leinster, took place on 11 May 2019 at St James' Park in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, with Saracens being crowned champions for the third time.\nTeams.\nTwenty clubs from the three major European domestic and regional leagues competed in the Champions Cup. Nineteen of these qualified directly as a result of their league performance.\nIn a change to previous seasons, the play-off to decide the 20th team was not held. The final place in the Champions Cup is now directly awarded in the following order:\nThe distribution of teams is:\nThe following teams qualified for the 2018–19 tournament.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe twenty competing teams are seeded and split into four tiers, each containing five teams.\nFor the purpose of creating the tiers, clubs are ranked based on their domestic league performances and on their qualification for the knockout phases of their championships. For example, a losing quarter-finalist would be seeded below a losing semi-finalist, even if they finished above them in the regular season.\nBased on these seedings, teams are placed into one of the four tiers, with the top seed clubs being put in Tier 1. The nature of the tier system means that a draw is needed to allocate two of the three second seed clubs to Tier 1 and to allocate one of the three fourth seed clubs to Tier 2. The tiers are shown below. Brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nThe following restrictions will apply to the draw:\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 20 June 2018, in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nTeams in the same pool play each other twice, at home and away, in the group stage that begins on the weekend of 12–14 October 2018, and continues through to 18–20 January 2019. The five pool winners and three best runners-up progress to the quarter-finals.\nTeams are awarded group points based on match performances. Four points are awarded for a win, two points for a draw, one attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and one defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers are used, as directed by EPCR:\nKnock-out stage.\nFormat.\nThe eight qualifiers are ranked according to their performance in the pool stage and compete in the quarter-finals which will be held on the weekend of 28–31 March 2019. The four top teams will host the quarter-finals against the four lower teams in a 1v8, 2v7, 3v6 and 4v5 format.\nThe semi-finals were played on the weekend of 19–21 April 2019. As in recent seasons, a fixed semi-final bracket was set in advance. Beginning this season, the higher-seeded team received home country/venue advantage for each semi-final, regardless of whether they won their quarter-final at home or on the road. Also new for this season was the EPCR's use of discretion to allow semi-finals to be played at a qualified club's home venue.\nThe winners of the semi-finals contested the final, at St James' Park, on 11 May 2019.\nSeason records.\nTeam.\n52–3 Leinster at home to Wasps on 12 October 2018\n41–15 Munster away to Gloucester on 11 January 2019\n56–27 Saracens at home to Glasgow Warriors on 30 March 2019\nLeinster at home to Wasps on 12 October 2018\nLeinster at home to Wasps on 12 October 2018&lt;br&gt;\nLeinster at home to Bath on 15 December 2018&lt;br&gt;\nSaracens at home to Glasgow Warriors on 30 March 2019\nSaracens at home to Munster on 20 April 2019\nCastres at home to Exeter Chiefs on 20 October 2018&lt;br&gt;\nLyon at home to Saracens on 13 January 2019\nPlayer.\n Joey Carbery for Munster at away to Gloucester on 11 January 2019\nMultiple players\n Alex Lozowski for Saracens at home to Glasgow Warriors on 30 March 2019\n Owen Farrell for Saracens at home to Munster on 20 April 2019\n Julien Dumora for Castres at home to Exeter Chiefs on 20 October 2018&lt;br&gt;\n Jonathan Wisniewski for Lyon at home to Saracens on 13 January 2019\nAttendances.\nSaracens versus Leinster on 11 May 2019 (Final)\nNewcastle Falcons at home to Montpellier on 21 October 2018\nLeinster\nNewcastle Falcons"

        "text": "Super Rugby Women's is an annual professional women's rugby union club competition organised by Rugby Australia. It is contested by five clubs from Australia and one club from Fiji, who play a single series of round-robin matches to determine the four participants of a single-elimination tournament. The competition replaced the representative National Women's Championship with five teams owned by the Australian Super Rugby franchises, and began play in the 2018 season as an amateur league known as the Super W. The 2022 season saw the addition of a team from Fiji, and the introduction of salaries for players. The league adopted its current name in the 2024 season. Fijiana Drua are the current champions, while the New South Wales Waratahs have won the most championships (4).\nHistory.\nThe league commenced in the 2018 season as an amateur league. Buildcorp were named as the league's naming rights partner, while Gilbert were named as the official supplier of the league's rugby balls. For the inaugural season, the teams' playing lists were constructed from scratch throughout the later stages of 2018. Clubs were asked to nominate a list of desired players, with the Super W assigning two of these \"marquee\" players to each club. In addition, clubs were able to sign a number of players with existing connections to the club, or with arrangements for club sponsored work or study. In the 2019 season, the Western Force were replaced by a team representing RugbyWA.\nThe 2020 season was suspended following the fifth and final round of the regular season, due to lockdowns imposed by various state governments in late March, following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Australia. The planned playoff between the second-placed Reds and third-placed Brumbies, and the subsequent grand final, were cancelled in April; the first-placed Waratahs were declared champions once more. The Waratahs would finish a fourth straight undefeated season in 2021, which was played almost entirely at Coffs Harbour International Stadium in a pool format, and featured the temporary addition of a \"President's XV\" team composed of players from New South Wales and Queensland. The Western Force returned to the league, but withdrew after the first round to avoid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic in New South Wales.\nTeams.\nSix Super Rugby franchises, including five from Australia and one from Fiji, will field teams in the 2024 season of Super Rugby Women's. Players in the competition are required to be seventeen years of age or older.\nBroadcasting.\nDuring the 2020 season all matches were televised live by affiliate partners Fox Sports. Following Rugby Australia's broadcast deal with Nine Network, all games will be broadcast on streaming service Stan Sport, with one game a round being simulcast on Nine's flagship free to air channel. All matches are streamed live by Stan Sport.\nReferences.\nNotes\nCitations"

While serving as Portland's interim general manager in 2011–12, Buchanan made the trade that sent Gerald Wallace to the Nets in exchange for the first-round pick that was later used to draft Damian Lillard. When the Pacers were considering hiring Buchanan, CBS Sports' Chris Barnewall wrote, \"Buchanan is well respected across the league and his experience in college scouting is something the Pacers would find great value in.\"\nBuchanan went to Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, and worked as an assistant coach there from 1997 to 2002.

It was strongly supported by local business leaders but met opposition from local residents, campaigners and environmental groups anxious to preserve the 4,000-year-old sand dunes that were designated an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). In June 2019, Scottish Natural Heritage ruled that the golf course had \"partially destroyed\" the sand dune system, causing permanent habitat loss, and recommended that the SSSI status be revoked. The SSSI special status was removed in December 2020.\nThough the development was recommended for approval by Aberdeenshire Council officials the development was initially rejected by a local subcommittee of elected members. However it was subsequently approved following a controversial planning inquiry ordered by the Scottish Government in June 2008, at which Trump personally testified. Work began on the site in July 2010.\nIn March 2009, the Trump Organization had asked the Council to use its powers of compulsory purchase to acquire some areas of land at Balmedie not forming part of the original TIGLS site for which planning permission already existed. These included four family-owned properties. In response local campaigners established Tripping Up Trump, a movement aimed at protecting the families at Menie being threatened with eviction. When it emerged at the end of January 2011 that Queen guitarist Brian May had agreed to the use of the band's song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" in a film highlighting the plight of the families, Trump appeared to deny in a media statement that there had ever been an eviction threat, declaring \"we have no interest in compulsory purchase and have never applied for it.\"\nIn September 2011, the Trump Organization lodged a formal objection to the proposed construction of a wind farm off the Aberdeenshire coast not far from the site of the new hotel and luxury housing. Donald Trump also wrote personally to the First Minister of Scotland protesting mainly on aesthetic grounds at the proposed erection of offshore wind turbines, which he characterized as 'ugly'. His letter claimed that he was protesting on behalf of the Scottish people, 'not... merely for the benefit of Trump International Golf Links.' The Organization's subsequent lawsuit failed as did the appeal.\nIn 2011, a documentary directed by Anthony Baxter called \"You've Been Trumped\" was released, showing the situation of local residents adversely affected by the resort's construction. It contains footage of, among others, economists who query the benefits claimed for the local economy, environmentalists critical of the damage allegedly caused by the development and golfers who voice doubts about claims made for the resort by the Trump Organization. It also shows Anthony Baxter being arrested by a Grampian Police officer, while filming; he was later released without charge. Baxter has been quoted as saying that Trump branded the film 'boring' and Baxter himself 'a fraud'. The film has won several awards including the Hamptons Film Festival Social Justice Award, the Maysles Brothers Award for best documentary at the Denver Film Festival and the Sedona International Film Festival Director's Choice Award.\nThe course opened on July 10, 2012.\nDespite Trump's threat to withdraw any further investment in Scotland amid the wind turbine controversy, he later purchased the prestigious Turnberry resort in Ayrshire in April 2014.\nAberdeenshire Council granted planning approval for a second golf course on the Menie site, to be named the \"MacLeod Course\" after Donald Trump's mother Mary Anne MacLeod, in October 2020.\nOperation.\nBy 31 December 2018 the accounts reveal an overall expenditure on assets to date of £33,659,179. During the year there had been an operating loss of £866,991 and loss before tax of £1,077,504. This loss represented a small improvement on the previous year (2017), when it made a loss of around £1,250,000. The number of employees had reduced from 84 during 2017 to 77 in 2018. The shareholders' deficit increased by just over £1,000,000 to £11,725,897.\nFor 31 December 2019 the accounts reveal an overall asset value of £32,071,221. During the year there had been an operating loss of £896,367 and loss before tax of £1,105,763. This loss represented a further decline on the previous year (2018). The number of employees rose back up to 84 during 2019 from 77 in 2018. The shareholders' deficit again increased by over £1M to £12,783,441.\nIn February 2023, the company managing the golf course, Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd, reported pre-tax losses of 697,000 pounds ($860 000) in 2021.\nCoat of arms.\nIn 2008, Trump promoted the golf course with a coat of arms that he had used for his American businesses, but was warned by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the highest authority for Scottish heraldry, that a Scottish law disallows the use of unregistered arms. In January 2012, shortly after the inauguration of the golf course, Trump unveiled a new coat of arms that had been granted to \"The Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd\" by the Lord Lyon in 2011.\nA spokesperson for the golf course said that \"the coat of arms brings together visual elements that signify different aspects of the Trump family heritage [...], the Lion Rampant [in the crest] makes reference to Scotland and the stars to America. Three chevronels are used to denote the sky, sand dunes and sea—the essential components of the site, and the double-[headed] Eagle represents the dual nature and nationality of Trump's heritage (Scottish and German). The Eagle clutches golf balls making reference to the great name of golf, and the motto \"Numquam Concedere\" is Latin for Never Give Up—Trump's philosophy\".\nThe same coat of arms was later used for the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland."

Ireland won the WODI series 4-0 and the only test match. Irish women's cricket team managed to win the WODI series after winning the first three ODI matches (3-0) just prior to the start of the only test match, with Ireland winning the 4th One Day International on the next day (on 1 August 2000) after the conclusion of the test match which ended on 31 July 2000 and the fifth being abandoned due to rain.\nThe Irish team won the historical test match on its debut against Pakistan by an innings and 54 runs which was held in Dublin. This was also the only international test cricket match hosted by Ireland until 2018. \n18 years later after the first test appearance for the Ireland women's cricket team, their male counterparts, the Ireland men's national cricket team also made its test debut against Pakistan in 2018.\nIsobel Joyce who made her Women's test debut in 2000 against Pakistan for Irish women's team along with Ed Joyce who made his test debut in 2018 for Irish men's team became only the second brother-sister siblings to have played in test cricket following Denise Emerson and Terry Alderman of Australia. Ed Joyce and Isobel Joyce are also the only brother-sister siblings combination to have made their Test debuts when playing for their respective gender teams on the country's first ever test appearances."

        "text": "\"(Is This the Way to) The World Cup\" is a 2006 single by Tony Christie with lyrics written by Ian Stringer and George Webley and published by Tug Records. It was released as a version of Christie's successful \"Is This the Way to Amarillo\" single and created as a version to support the England national football team at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The song reached a peak of No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart, and remained on the chart for a total of 5 weeks.\nCreation.\nIn 2005, Christie had a hit with a Comic Relief re-release of \"Amarillo\" with Peter Kay that reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart for 7 weeks in a row. The BBC Three Counties Radio presenters Ian Stringer and George Webley wrote alternate lyrics to \"Amarillo\" to support England at the World Cup, which the song predicts England will win. Christie was convinced to record the song using those lyrics by the BBC Radio 1 presenter Chris Moyles. The music video for it was filmed at Barnet F.C.'s Underhill Stadium in London. Christie initially said about it: \"It's got a nice summery feel about it and people seem to like it\" and the BBC commissioned him to review other 2006 World Cup songs competing with him. The \"Manchester Evening News\" said about \"Is This the Way to the World Cup\" that: \"It's that cheesy, it's a classic\". Like with \"Amarillo\" the year before, the profits for the single went to charity, specifically SportsAid.\nChristie later came to regret performing the song, stating in a 2010 interview that it was \"dreadful\" and said he would \"...never ever do it again because it was crap\".\nCharts.\n\"(Is This the Way to) The World Cup\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number 11. The following week it reached its peak of No. 8 on the chart before dropping three consecutive weeks after to 11, 24 and 30 before exiting the charts after five weeks."

        "text": "The 1904 Metropolitan Rugby Union season was the 31st season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. It was the fifth season run for clubs that represented a district. Eight clubs (seven representing a district, the remaining club representing Sydney University) competed from May till September 1904. The season culminated in the fourth district premiership, which was won by Sydney University. Sydney University were crowned premiers by virtue of finishing the season on top of the table.\nTeams.\nEight clubs contested the season; seven clubs representing a district and one club representing Sydney University.\nSeason Summary.\nThe 1904 Sydney Rugby Premiership was the most successful on record. The attendance of the public at the various matches was, on the average, the greatest yet known in Sydney football. In nearly every district there were young players coming into First Grade, developing play through lessons learnt from the games against the visiting British team.\nFor the first time in thirteen years, Sydney University carried off the premiership without any question of legitimacy. The team were one of the best during the first round of games, but their performance slipped during the second round. However, the team were worthy premiership winners despite their drop in form. It was a popular victory for the old club.\nNorth Sydney finished the season in the runners-up position and could have won the premiership if they had not lost key players to the NSW tour of Queensland. Astonishingly, the team were only able to score 14 tries throughout the regular games compared to over twice that amount for the Varsity. In the end, they lost the premiership by one competition point.\nSouth Sydney were considered the most dangerous of all of the teams. They were some of the most cleverest players in the competition displaying control, excellent tackling and smart tactics. Their weak point was their three-quarter line who, if they had performed better, may have given the team the premiership. South Sydney lost the premiership by the slim margin of two points.\nLower Grades.\nThe MRFU also conducted Second Grade and Boroughs competitions this season.\nSecond Grade.\nTen teams participated in the Second Grade competition: the eight First Grade clubs entered a team each, in addition two Boroughs clubs, Gipps and Manly, were permitted to each enter a team. At the end of the regular games, North Sydney finished at the top of the ladder. The season concluded with a final between Sydney University and Glebe. The game resulted in a scoreless draw, with both teams declared joint premiers.\nBoroughs Competition.\nEighteen teams participated in the Boroughs Competition. The teams were split into two divisions of nine teams. In Division A was North Sydney, Willoughby, Mosman, Manly, East Sydney, Surry Hills, Redfern, Balmain and Gipps. In Division B was Marrickville, University, Waterloo, Rockdale, Glebe, Annandale, Leichhardt, Rozelle and Ashfield. At the end of the regular games, North Sydney finished at the top of Division A and Marrickville finished at the top of Division B. The final saw East Sydney beat Marrickville 6 points to 5 to take the premiership."

The six winners in the play-off round (four from Champions Path, two from League Path) advanced to the group stage, to join the 26 teams that entered the group stage.\nTimes are CEST (), as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nTeams.\nChampions Path.\nThe Champions Path includes all league champions which do not qualify directly for the group stage, and consists of the following rounds:\nAll teams eliminated from the Champions Path enter the Europa League:\nBelow are the participating teams of the Champions Path (with their 2018 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.\nLeague Path.\nThe League Path includes all league non-champions which do not qualify directly for the group stage, and consists of the following rounds:\nAll teams eliminated from the League Path enter the Europa League:\nBelow are the participating teams of the League Path (with their 2018 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.\nFormat.\nEach tie, apart from the preliminary round, is played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advance to the next round. If the aggregate score is level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scores more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals are also equal, then extra time is played. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shoot-out. In the preliminary round, where single-match semi-finals and final are hosted by one of the participating teams, if scores are level at the end of normal time, extra time is played, followed by penalty shoot-out if scores remain tied.\nIn the draws for each round, teams are seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots containing the same number of teams. A seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs (or the administrative \"home\" team in the preliminary round matches) in each tie decided by draw. As the identity of the winners of the previous round is not known at the time of the draws, the seeding is carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advances to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient is to advance, it simply take the seeding of its opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they are purely for convenience of the draw and do not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition. Teams from associations with political conflicts as decided by UEFA may not be drawn into the same tie. After the draws, the order of legs of a tie may be reversed by UEFA due to scheduling or venue conflicts.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).\nPreliminary round.\nThe draw for the preliminary round was held on 12 June 2018, 12:00 CEST, to determine the matchups of the semi-finals and the administrative \"home\" team of each semi-final and final.\nSeeding.\nA total of four teams were involved in the preliminary round draw.

        "title": "2019 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2019 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2018–19 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. In the best-of-seven playoff series held from May 30 through June 13, 2019, the Eastern Conference champion Toronto Raptors defeated the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors, , earning the franchise its first NBA championship as well as the first win by an NBA team based outside the United States. Acquired by the Raptors via a trade during the off-season, Kawhi Leonard was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second time in his career.\nThis was the first NBA Finals appearance for the Raptors, and the league's first finals with games played outside of the United States. Home-court advantage was awarded to Toronto, who finished the regular season with one more win (58–24) than Golden State (57–25). This was the first time in five consecutive NBA Finals appearances that the then-two-time defending NBA-champion Warriors did not have home-court advantage. This meant that Games 3, 4, and 6 were held in Golden State (the last postseason home games for the Warriors in Oracle Arena) and Games 1, 2, and 5 were in Toronto. Had it been necessary, Game 7 would have been held in Toronto. Also for the first time after the past four postseasons, the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers did not meet in the championship round. This was the first Finals since 2010 not to feature LeBron James, who played in the past eight Finals with the Cavaliers and the Miami Heat.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, this was the last NBA Finals until 2022 to be played in its traditional June schedule. This also was the last finals until the 2023 NBA Finals in which a team made its first trip to the NBA Finals in its franchise history. For the first time in NBA History, two national anthems were performed before the game started, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" for the country of the United States and \"O Canada\" for the country of Canada.\nBackground.\nGolden State Warriors.\nDuring the off-season, Golden State acquired DeMarcus Cousins, who was recovering from a ruptured left Achilles. He gave the Warriors a true, top-flight center for the first time under head coach Steve Kerr. During an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers in November 2018, Draymond Green cursed out teammate Kevin Durant over his upcoming free agency status after the season, and he was suspended for the much-publicized blowup. In January 2019, Cousins returned, and the Warriors became the first team in 42 years with a starting lineup of five NBA All-Stars from the previous season. The team finished the regular season with a 57–25 record, winning the Pacific Division and securing the 1st seed in the Western Conference.\nIn the playoffs, Golden State defeated the Clippers in six games in the first round, despite blowing leads at home in Games 2 and 5. Cousins tore his left quadriceps in Game 2, and was initially thought to be out for the remainder of the postseason. With an increased urgency and in a sign of respect towards their opponent, Kerr opened the following round against the Houston Rockets by moving Andre Iguodala from the bench and starting the Hamptons Five for the first time in the season. With the Splash Brothers—Warriors guards Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson—struggling with their shooting, Durant had been the team's best player in the playoffs, averaging a team-leading 35.4 points entering Game 5. However, Durant left the game late in the third quarter after suffering a strained right calf; he was later ruled out indefinitely. Led by Curry and Thompson, Golden State pulled out Game 5 without Durant, and won the series in six games thanks to Stephen Curry's 33-point second half. In the Western Conference Finals, Golden State swept the Portland Trail Blazers 4–0, with three of the wins including comebacks of 15 points or more. After starting nine consecutive games, Iguodala missed the deciding Game 4 with a sore left calf injury from Game 3. Curry averaged a series career-high 36.5 points, the highest average by a player in a four-game sweep in NBA history. This was Golden State's fifth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals, and they were aiming to be the first since the Shaq and Kobe-led Los Angeles Lakers to win 3-peat titles. After losing the Finals to the Raptors, they became the second team not to earn a 3-peat, joining the Miami Heat who lost their quest in 2014 to the San Antonio Spurs, who ended their own seven-year title drought. They were the second team in NBA history to achieve this feat, joining the Boston Celtics, who played in ten straight Finals (1957–1966).\nToronto Raptors.\nDuring the off-season, the Raptors fired coach Dwane Casey, who was named the 2018 NBA Coach of the Year weeks later, and replaced him with assistant coach Nick Nurse. They also traded DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Pöltl to the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. The move stunned the All-Star DeRozan, who had become a fan favorite in his nine seasons in Toronto. It was a risky move for the Raptors and their president, Masai Ujiri, as Leonard was one year away from becoming a free agent, and he wanted to leave the Spurs after playing in just nine games in 2017–18 due to tendinopathy in his left quadriceps, however the 2014 NBA Finals MVP made it through the season healthy while being systematically rested for 22 games. During the season, Toronto also traded a package that included Jonas Valančiūnas to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for one of the league's elite post-defenders, Marc Gasol.\nThe Raptors lost Game 1 of the first round to the Orlando Magic, but then won the next four games in a row to win the series in five games. After trailing 2–1 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference semifinals, they defeated them in seven games, with Leonard hitting the game-winner at the buzzer as the ball bounced four times on the rim before falling in, the first buzzer beater in a Game 7 in the NBA playoffs. Toronto advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals to face the Milwaukee Bucks. Despite trailing 2–0, the Raptors won the next four games to advance to the Finals in six games, as Leonard outplayed the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo, who won league MVP that season. This was their first trip to the NBA Finals in franchise history, breaking a 25-year drought for teams from Toronto appearing in the championship round of any of the four major North American professional sports leagues since Major League Baseball's Toronto Blue Jays won the 1993 World Series.\nRegular season series.\nThe Raptors won the regular season series 2–0.\nSeries summary.\nWinning team in bold.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nPascal Siakam scored a playoff career-high 32 points on 14-of-17 shooting to lead Toronto to a 118–109 win over Golden State in the first-ever NBA Finals game played outside the United States. The Raptors had a 10-point lead at the half. Siakam, the NBA Most Improved Player that season, shot 6-for-6 in the third quarter to keep the Warriors at bay. Toronto maintained a double-digit lead for most of the fourth quarter, countering every rally by Golden State.\nLeonard had 23 points, eight rebounds and five assists in his first NBA Finals game since he was named the Finals MVP in 2014. Gasol added 20 for the Raptors. Curry scored 34 and Thompson had 21 for Golden State, which had won Game 1 of the Finals in each of the last four years. Draymond Green had a triple-double with 10 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. Cousins returned from a quadriceps injury to come off the bench in his first NBA Finals game. After missing Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals with a left calf injury, Iguodala left near the end of this game after limping and favoring his right leg. Durant, the MVP of the last two NBA Finals, traveled with the team to Toronto, but remained sidelined. This was the only game in the entire series with the home team victorious.\nGame 2.\nThompson scored a team-high 25 points, and the Warriors outscored the Raptors 18–0 to start the second half before holding off a late Toronto rally to win 109–104. Thompson had 18 points in the first half to keep Golden State in the game. They trailed by 11 with almost two minutes left until halftime before cutting it to 59–54 at the half. The Warriors' 18 unanswered points to begin the second half were the most in NBA Finals history to start a half. Thompson left the game in the fourth quarter with a left hamstring injury after landing awkwardly on a three-point field goal attempt. Toronto scored 10 straight points to pull within two points at 106–104, but Iguodala cemented the win with a three-pointer with 5.9 seconds remaining in the game.\nCurry finished the game with 23 points after missing his first six shots of the game. Cousins, who was moved into the starting lineup, had 11 points, 10 rebounds and six assists, and Draymond Green had 17 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists to fall one assist short of his fourth straight triple-double. Warriors backup center Kevon Looney missed the second half with a chest contusion. Leonard led the Raptors with 34 points and 14 rebounds, and Fred VanVleet added 17 points. Game 1 star Siakam scored just 12 points on 5-for-18 shooting. Toronto was held to 37.2 percent shooting for the game.\nGame 3.\nLeonard scored 30 points and the Raptors shot 52.4 percent and made 17 three-pointers to win 123–109 on the road over the short-handed Warriors. Curry scored a playoff career-high 47 points, shooting 14 for 31 including 6 of 14 on 3-pointers, while his teammates totaled 62 points on 36.7 percent shooting. Golden State played without injured starters Thompson and Durant, and backup big man Looney. Toronto's Kyle Lowry had 23 points and five 3-pointers, and Danny Green added 18 points on 6 made 3s, as all five of their starters scored in double figures. VanVleet contributed 11 points off the bench.\nThompson practiced earlier in the day but did not warm up for the game. Kerr had said that the Warriors were not going to play him if there was risk of further damage. Looney was out with a cartilage fracture near his right collarbone.\nThe game was not without controversy, however, when Warriors investor Mark Stevens pushed Kyle Lowry while attempting to dive for a loose ball, a gesture for which Stevens was banned from attending Warriors games in the future.\nGame 4.\nToronto took a 3–1 lead in the series after Leonard scored 36 points and had 12 rebounds in a 105–92 road win over Golden State. The Raptors struggled early, falling behind by 11 early in the contest and only scoring 17 points in the opening period, before trailing 46–42 at halftime. They outscored the Warriors 37–21 in the third quarter, when Leonard scored 17 of his points, and led by as many as 16 in the final quarter. Serge Ibaka scored 20 points for Toronto, shooting 9 for 12 in 22 minutes off the bench. Thompson returned from injury to lead Golden State with 28 points, including six 3-pointers.\nSiakam added 19 points for the Raptors. VanVleet needed seven stitches in the fourth quarter after the Warriors' Shaun Livingston inadvertently elbowed him in the face. The only other player to score over 10 points for Golden State, Curry had 27 points, but shot just 9 for 22 and missed 7 of his 9 three-point attempts. Looney returned to score 10 points after Kerr initially declared him out for the series following his Game 2 injury.\nGame 5.\nCurry scored 31 points and Thompson had 26 to help the Warriors stave off elimination with a 106–105 win at Toronto. They combined for three straight 3-pointers after the Raptors led by six points with minutes left in the game. Durant returned after missing the previous nine games with his right calf injury, and scored 11 points in the first quarter. However, he was lost for the game two minutes into the second quarter when he tried to drive by Ibaka and suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon, falling and grabbing his lower right calf. He limped off the court and was helped to the locker room. Leonard scored 10 straight points in the fourth quarter to erase Golden State's 14-point lead. Lowry's potential championship-winning, 3-point shot at the buzzer fell short after it was partially blocked by Draymond Green.\nGolden State made 20 three-pointers, the second most in NBA Finals history behind Cleveland's 24 against the Warriors in Game 4 in 2017. Cousins, who did not enter the game until Durant's injury, had 14 points and six rebounds for the Warriors, and Green added 10 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Leonard had 26 points for the Raptors, while Lowry added 18 and Gasol 17 to lead six Raptors in double figures. Golden State played most of the second half without Looney, who aggravated his cartilage fracture after colliding with Lowry while battling for a rebound.\nDurant left the arena on crutches and in a walking boot. \"I don't believe there's anybody to blame [for Durant's injury], but I understand in this world, and if you have to, you can blame me,\" said Bob Myers, the Warriors' president of basketball operations. Durant underwent surgery to repair the tendon and was at risk of missing all of the following season. Originally expected to become a free agent after the 2018–19 season, he had a $31.5 million option to remain with Golden State for another season, but it was ultimately his last appearance with the Warriors, after a sign-and-trade to the Nets the following month.\nNurse was criticized for calling a timeout with Toronto up 103–97 after going on a 12–2 run; the Splash Brothers' three 3-pointers came after the break. In its Last Two Minutes report, the NBA stated that Cousins should have been called for a shooting foul on Gasol with 49 seconds left in the game, which would have given Gasol two free throws with the Raptors trailing 106–103 at the time.\nGame 6.\nLeonard scored 22 points and had six rebounds and was named the NBA Finals MVP after Toronto won 114–110 over Golden State to claim its first championship in franchise history. Thompson scored a game-high 30 points for the Warriors, but was lost for the game with 2:22 remaining in the third quarter after landing awkwardly and suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee on a drive to the basket contested by Danny Green. With the Raptors leading 111–110, the Warriors managed to force a turnover with 9.6 seconds left in the game, but Curry missed a three-pointer that would have forced a Game 7. Trying to secure the ball after the miss, Iguodala called a timeout, but the Warriors did not have any left, and were assessed a technical foul. It was academic, as time would have otherwise expired had they not attempted to stop the clock. Leonard was awarded three free throws to seal the Raptors' first-ever NBA championship title.\nLowry and Siakam led Toronto with 26 points each. Lowry scored 11 of his points in the first two-plus minutes of the contest. Van Vleet finished with 22 points, including 12 in the final period, and made five of the team's 13 three-pointers. Siakam added 10 rebounds. Curry had 21 points for Golden State, but he was hounded by the Raptors in the fourth quarter without Durant or Thompson available. Draymond Green had a triple-double with 11 points, 19 rebounds and 13 assists, but committed eight turnovers. Iguodala had 22 points despite shooting only 1 of 5 on free throws.\nLeonard averaged 28.5 points per game in the series, and joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James as the only players to be named Finals MVP with two different teams. Toronto was the first Canadian team to win the NBA title and the first non-American team to win any of the Big Four North American sports titles since the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball won the World Series in October 1993. This was the Warriors' last game ever at Oracle Arena, as they moved to the new Chase Center across the bay in San Francisco at the beginning of the 2019–20 season. They finished 0–3 at home in the series. The road team won the last five games of the series, the longest string of road wins in one Finals.\nIncident between Raptors president and law enforcement.\nMoments after the game's conclusion, Raptors executive Masai Ujiri was barred by an Alameda County Sheriff deputy from walking onto the floor for the team's trophy presentation, leading to an altercation between the two men.\nBody camera footage eventually released to the public revealed that Dep. Alan Strickland had shoved Ujiri twice in the chest after the executive had tried to access the court, prompting Ujiri to shove him back. The two men appeared to stare each other down for several seconds before Lowry arrived, embracing Ujiri and escorting him onto the floor for the celebration.\nWhile the footage does not display Ujiri wearing the credentials that would have allowed him to walk onto the floor, he is heard identifying himself as \"president of the Raptors\" while holding up the credentials he did have.\nFollowing the incident, Sheriff Greg Ahearn said he would recommend battery charges against Ujiri. However, after privately meeting with Ujiri and his lawyers, representatives from the county District Attorney's office announced there would be no criminal charges filed against him.\nStrickland separately sued Ujiri for $75,000, claiming to have suffered a concussion during the altercation. Ujiri countersued, and the two men later dropped their filings.\nPlayer statistics.\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left; background:#FDE910\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\nSponsorship.\nAs part of a multiyear partnership that began in 2018, the internet television service YouTube TV was the presenting sponsor of the series, even in Canada despite its lack of legal availability there at the time, which was officially named the \"NBA Finals 2019 presented by YouTube TV\".\nMedia coverage.\nIn the United States, the Finals was televised by ABC in English and ESPN Deportes in Spanish. Play-by-play commentator Mike Breen, and analysts Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy called the series on ABC, while Álvaro Martín (play-by-play) and Carlos Morales (analyst) were on ESPN Deportes. This was also Doris Burke's last year in the NBA Finals as sideline reporter on TV; a year later, she transitioned to calling the series as an analyst on the ESPN Radio.\nIn Canada, the Raptors' and the NBA's main local rightsholders, Sportsnet (which aired games 1, 3, and 5, and would have aired game 7) and TSN (games 2, 4, and 6) aired separate, local telecasts with the Raptors' commentary team of Matt Devlin on play-by-play, and Leo Rautins (Sportsnet) or Jack Armstrong (TSN) as analysts. TSN sister broadcast television network CTV 2 aired simulcasts of ABC's feed for games 2 and 4 in order to enforce simultaneous substitution rights on ABC stations carried on pay television, while game 6 was simulcast on CTV. Sportsnet's sister broadcast network Citytv similarly simulcast games 3 and 5. RDS broadcast all six games in French.\nAs the NBA's sole Canadian franchise, the Raptors' parent company Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (which is, in turn, majority owned between a partnership of Sportsnet and TSN's respective owners, Rogers Communications and BCE Inc.) manages the league's national media rights in Canada. The series technically marked the first time that a team's regional broadcaster has produced its own coverage of games during the NBA Finals; these local broadcasts had access to ABC's camera feeds, along with additional cameras that were part of its own production resources.\nViewership.\nIn Canada, Game 1 recorded an average of 3.3 million viewers on Sportsnet, making it the highest-rated NBA game in Canadian history. By contrast, with 10.77 million U.S. viewers, Game 1 was the second lowest-rated NBA Finals game in the U.S. after the 2020 NBA Finals. Analysts cited both the presence of a Canadian team (Canadian viewership does not count towards U.S. Nielsen ratings, leading to only one U.S. home market being reflected in viewership, being the San Francisco Bay Area market), and being the first NBA Finals not to feature a team with LeBron James since 2011, as factors in the drop. In the Warriors' home market, ratings were also lower in comparison to its past Game 1 appearances.\nThe Canadian record would be surpassed by Game 2, with an average of 4.3 million across TSN, the French-language broadcast on RDS, and CTV2's simulcast of ABC's broadcast, and an estimate that the game was seen at any point by at least 10 million viewers. The game also had a 68 percent ratings share in the Toronto–Hamilton market. Game 3 was seen by 3.8 million viewers across Sportsnet and Citytv. The downward trend of U.S. viewership continued on Game 4, with a 9.8 share for the Friday-night game (a 12.5 percent year-over-year decline over Game 4 in 2018). TSN reported average viewership of 4.631 million, surpassing Canadian NBA viewership records for the third time in the series.\nU.S. Game 5 viewership was 37% higher over Game 4, at 18.22 million, while Sportsnet reported an average of 6.4 million viewers across Sportsnet and the Citytv simulcast of ABC coverage—surpassing the series finale of \"The Big Bang Theory\" (4.33 million), Super Bowl LIII (4.34 million), and the 91st Academy Awards (5.21 million) as the most-watched television broadcast of 2019 in Canada, and once again the most-watched NBA telecast in Canada. The NBA itself estimated 6.9 million viewers when accounting for the French-language feed on RDS and estimated viewership on out-of-market stations.\nGame 6 further exceeded these numbers with an average of 7.7 million. TSN publicized that a total of 15.9 million unique viewers watched some point of the telecast, and 9.99 million were watching during the final minute. TSN also reported that Game 6 had an 82 percent share of viewers in the Toronto–Hamilton market—which it stated to be the highest in the region for a sports broadcast outside of the Olympic Games, summer or winter. Game 6's ratings in the United States were slightly higher over Game 5, with 18.34 million.\nVictory parade.\nOn June 17, the Raptors held a victory parade in Downtown Toronto, which began at the Princes' Gates at the east end of Exhibition Place, traveled east along Lake Shore Boulevard West, north along York Street and University Avenue, east along Queen Street West, and finished at Nathan Phillips Square next to Toronto City Hall. The parade was attended by an estimated crowd of two million fans, making this the largest public gathering in one place for one event in Canadian history, peacetime or wartime. However, due to this overcrowding, the parade was delayed an additional three hours as numerous fans bypassed the barricades, blocking the parade route. In addition, excessive crowds delayed emergency services from attending to people in the crowd falling ill from heat exhaustion and dehydration, which resulted in the death of an infant. Later on, the parade was marred by shootings, which occurred during the victory speeches. The shootings wounded four people, though did not inflict life-threatening injuries, and caused a stampede. Three suspects were arrested and two guns were recovered.\nAftermath.\nWarriors.\nIn the offseason, Kevin Durant left to join the Brooklyn Nets, but did not play until the 2020–21 season due to the Achilles injury he suffered in the Finals. Meanwhile, Klay Thompson did not play for the next two seasons due to the ACL injury he suffered in the Finals, and an Achilles tear he suffered in the succeeding offseason.\nWithout Thompson and Stephen Curry for most of the pandemic-shortened 2019–20 season, the Warriors finished with a conference-worst 15–50 record, and did not qualify for the Orlando bubble in the summer. In the 72-game 2020–21 season, they finished eighth in the conference with 39 wins and qualified for the play-in tournament, but lost to the Los Angeles Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies in the first and second phases, respectively. However, with Thompson and Curry back and healthy, the Warriors finished the 2021–22 season third in the conference with 53 wins, and eventually defeated the Boston Celtics in six games of the 2022 NBA Finals.\nRaptors.\nIn the 2019 offseason, Kawhi Leonard signed with the Los Angeles Clippers after only one season in Toronto. Nevertheless, the Raptors still finished the 2019–20 season 53–19 and were invited to the Orlando bubble during the summer. However, they lost in seven games to the Boston Celtics in the second round of the playoffs. The following season, the Raptors were forced to play all of their home games at Amalie Arena in Tampa due to Canadian travel restrictions brought on by the pandemic. The team finished the season out of the playoffs with 27 wins. However, in the 2021–22 season, the Raptors resumed playing home games in Toronto and ended with 48 wins; however, they lost in the opening round to the Philadelphia 76ers. The Raptors would become the last team to win the NBA championship on their debut appearance until the Denver Nuggets in 2023."

The Western Conference champion St. Louis Blues defeated the Eastern Conference champion Boston Bruins four games to three in the best-of-seven series. It was the Blues' first championship, in their 51st season of play (not including the 2004–05 lockout), ending what was then the third-longest championship drought in league history. The Bruins had home-ice advantage in the series with the better regular season record. The series began on May 27 and concluded on June 12. The Blues' Stanley Cup–winning run of 26 playoff games tied the 2014 Los Angeles Kings for the longest of any Stanley Cup–winning team in history.\nThis was a rematch of the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals, which Boston won in four games. This was the fourth consecutive Finals to both involve at least one team vying for its first championship and end with the champion clinching the Cup on the road. It was also the first time since 2011 where the Finals went the full seven games.\nEntering the 2019 finals, the Blues were the oldest franchise not to win a Stanley Cup and the only active team from the 1967 NHL expansion without a Stanley Cup. The Blues' victory resulted in all five of the active 1967 teams obtaining a Stanley Cup title, while the Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver Canucks became the oldest franchises not to win one.\nPaths to the Finals.\nBoston Bruins.\nThis was the Boston Bruins' 20th appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals, six years after , when they faced the Chicago Blackhawks and were defeated in six games. The Bruins last won the Stanley Cup in against the Vancouver Canucks in seven games, their sixth Cup in franchise history.\nBrad Marchand became the first Bruin since the 2005–06 season to score 100 points, finishing the regular season with 100 points in 79 games. David Pastrnak led the team in goals with 38. Tuukka Rask and Jaroslav Halak split the goaltending duties during the regular season. Halak had signed with the team during the off-season, and approaching the trade deadline the Bruins acquired forwards Charlie Coyle and Marcus Johansson.\nBoston finished the regular season with 107 points, finishing in second place in the Atlantic Division and third overall in the league. In the First Round of the playoffs, they defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games for the second consecutive playoff meeting against the Maple Leafs and third since the 2012–13 season. They then defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 4–2 in the Second Round. In the Conference Finals, Boston swept the Carolina Hurricanes.\nSt. Louis Blues.\nThis was the St. Louis Blues' fourth appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. Their last appearance in the Finals was in against the Bruins, which Boston won in a four-game sweep. All of St. Louis' prior appearances came during their first three seasons after the Blues and five other new teams formed the West Division in the 1967 NHL expansion. While the Blues were able to advance past their fellow expansion franchises, each Finals appearance ended with them being swept by Original Six teams that comprised the East Division, concluding with their 1970 defeat. In the years that followed, the other expansion teams from 1967 would win Stanley Cup titles (excluding the defunct California Golden Seals franchise), but the Blues went nearly half a century without reaching the Finals again and became the oldest franchise not to win the Stanley Cup.\nRyan O'Reilly, who was acquired via trade in the off-season led the team in scoring with 77 points and assists with 49. Vladimir Tarasenko led the team in goal-scoring with 33 goals.\nSt. Louis struggled early in the regular season, beginning the year with a 7–9–3 record. Head coach Mike Yeo was fired and assistant coach Craig Berube was named interim coach. Their record declined to an NHL-worst 15–18–4 with 34 points on January 2, 2019. However, the Blues went on a 30–10–5 run to finish the season with 99 points, third in the Central Division. Amid their turnaround, rookie goaltender Jordan Binnington was given his first start and went on to obtain 23 wins. In the playoffs, St. Louis defeated the Winnipeg Jets 4–2 in the First Round, eliminated the Dallas Stars in seven games, and won 4–2 against the San Jose Sharks in the Conference Finals.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nIn game one, Brayden Schenn scored the first goal of the Finals for the Blues, firing a wrist shot past Tuukka Rask. In the second period, Bruins forward David Pastrnak mistakenly passed back to an open Schenn who gave the puck to Vladimir Tarasenko who doubled the lead for St. Louis. The Bruins quickly scored after, as a pass by Sean Kuraly deflected off of intended target Connor Clifton's skate and then goalie Jordan Binnington's stick and into the net. Charlie McAvoy then tied the game on the power play speeding through the Blues zone to put one past Binnington. In the third period, Boston gained the lead as a net-mouth scramble ended up on Sean Kuraly's stick who fired it past Binnington. The Bruins continued their shot output, placing ten more on Binnington before being pulled. Brad Marchand sealed the Bruins victory after a successful defensive zone face-off put the puck into the Blues' zone and the forward shot it into the empty net.\nGame two.\nIn game two, Boston scored the first goal when Samuel Blais was given a penalty for goaltender interference and Charlie Coyle put the puck past St. Louis goaltender Jordan Binnington. The Blues struck back when Robert Bortuzzo's shot deflected off of Matt Grzelcyk and squeaked past Tuukka Rask on the short side. The Bruins scored 40 seconds later to take the lead again with Joakim Nordstrom moving around the St. Louis defenceman and backhanding his shot past Binnington. Vladimir Tarasenko then tied the game for the Blues when his shot rebounded off of Rask and backhanded his shot into the open net. In the second period, the Blues dominated in shots fourteen to six but neither team scored. However, Blues forward Tyler Bozak was high-sticked resulting in an injury to the forward; St. Louis was granted a 4-minute power-play. The teams were even in shots in the third period, but with no scoring, the game went into overtime. During the overtime period, Bruins defenceman Brandon Carlo tripped up Alexander Steen and on the delayed penalty, Carl Gunnarsson fired a slap shot past Rask giving St. Louis their first victory in the Finals in franchise history and tying the series 1–1.\nGame three.\nIn game three, Boston took over the first period with three unanswered goals. The first came from Patrice Bergeron on the power-play. The next came from Charlie Coyle whose wrist shot got past Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington. The last goal came from Sean Kuraly with less than ten seconds in the period; the goal was unsuccessfully challenged on an offside review. With power-play given to the Bruins from the failed offside challenge, David Pastrnak capitalized in the second period, backhanding his shot past Binnington. The Blues were able to get on the board as Zach Sanford passed to an open Ivan Barbashev for his third goal of the playoffs. However, the Bruins quickly had their four-goal restored when Colton Parayko was sent to the penalty box for high-sticking and Torey Krug cashed in for Boston's third power-play goal of the game. Binnington was pulled from the game following this goal and replaced with Jake Allen. In the third period, a roughing penalty by Bruins captain Zdeno Chara proved costly as Parayko scored on the given power-play, his slap shot deflecting off of Brandon Carlo. Although the Blues out shot the Bruins eleven to four, beyond the one goal, St. Louis could not get another past Tuukka Rask. Bruins forward Noel Acciari scored an empty-net goal to add insurance. Boston added another power-play goal with Marcus Johansson's slap shot cleanly beating Allen finalizing the score at 7–2. The Bruins scored on every power-play that they had in the game, scoring on each of their four power-play shots.\nGame four.\nIn game four, Ryan O'Reilly scored first for the Blues, scoring a wrap-around goal 43 seconds into the game. The Bruins counter-attacked when Zdeno Chara shot at Jordan Binnington and the rebound went to Charlie Coyle who slid it past the Blues goaltender. The Blues regained the lead when Alex Pietrangelo's shot rebounded to Vladimir Tarasenko firing a wrist shot past Tuukka Rask. In the second period, with Boston forward Connor Clifton resigned to the penalty box for an illegal check to the head, the Bruins, shorthanded, tied the game as Brandon Carlo picked up a rebound to shoot it past Binnington. Midway through the third period, however, the Blues regained the lead with a rebound going to O'Reilly. The Blues staved off the Bruins, limiting Boston's shots to five. Brayden Schenn sealed the game's final score at 4–2 with an empty-net goal tying the series at 2–2.\nGame five.\nIn game five, the Bruins piled on seventeen shots in the first period, but Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington held down the fort. The Blues got the first goal of the game in the second period as Ryan O'Reilly backhanded a shot past Tuukka Rask. The Bruins continued the pressure into the third period. In the third period, controversy occurred when Blues forward Tyler Bozak tripped Noel Acciari, but no penalty was called on the play. With play continuing while Acciari was down on the ice, David Perron scored with the puck deflecting off Rask into the net. The Bruins got on the board with less than seven minutes remaining when Oskar Sundqvist high-sticked Torey Krug, causing a delayed penalty, and the Boston defenceman passed to an open Jake DeBrusk who fired it past Binnington. The Blues played defensively for the final minutes to win the game 2–1 and lead the series 3–2.\nGame six.\nIn game six, after both Brayden Schenn and Ryan O'Reilly were sent to the penalty box for boarding and delay of game respectively, Boston forward Brad Marchand scored on the resulting 5-on-3 power play. In the second period, both teams were relatively even in shots, Boston with eight and St. Louis with ten, but neither team scored. In the third period, Bruins defenceman Brandon Carlo shot a bouncing puck towards Jordan Binnington which snuck under the Blues goaltender's blocker for the second goal of the game. Karson Kuhlman gave Boston a three-goal lead with his first goal of the playoffs. St. Louis got on the board when O'Reilly's shot appeared to cross the goal line after a video replay. The Bruins regained their three-goal lead when the Blues in a defensive scramble left David Pastnak alone in front of the net and he fired the puck past Binnington. The Blues pulled Binnington in an attempt to tie the game, but Zdeno Chara sealed the victory for the Bruins finalizing the score at 5–1 and sending the series to a seventh game.\nGame seven.\nIn game seven, Jay Bouwmeester's shot got through a screen of players and Ryan O'Reilly tipped the puck past Tuukka Rask for the opening goal. The Blues increased their lead with eight seconds remaining in the first period when Jaden Schwartz passed to an open Alex Pietrangelo who backhanded his shot for his third goal of the playoffs. Boston continued to pressure St. Louis in the second period with eleven shots, but Jordan Binnington kept the score at 2–0. In the third period, Vladimir Tarasenko followed the puck into the Bruins' zone and passed to an open Brayden Schenn who fired the puck past Rask. Zach Sanford made the score 4–0 as the Blues continued to work in the offensive zone, with David Perron working around the Bruins defenceman to pass to the open rookie forward. The Bruins then swapped Rask for an extra attacker and thwarted Binnington's shutout attempt with a goal from Matt Grzelcyk. With the 4–1 victory, the Blues became the last remaining expansion franchise from 1967 to win the Stanley Cup. O'Reilly was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe Stanley Cup was presented to Blues captain Alex Pietrangelo by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman following the Blues 4–1 win over the Bruins in game seven.\nThe following Blues players and staff qualified to have their names engraved on the Stanley Cup:\n2018–19 St. Louis Blues\nPlayer notes.\nThese players were on the extended roster during the playoffs, having played regular-season games for St. Louis.\nNone of these players played in the playoffs for St. Louis.

        "text": "The Premiership Rugby Cup is an English rugby union knockout cup competition for teams in Premiership Rugby and from the 2023–24 season the RFU Championship. It was created in 2018 to replace the Anglo-Welsh Cup after the withdrawal of the Welsh regions.\nHistory.\nThe Premiership Rugby Cup was created to replace the Anglo-Welsh Cup which had been running since 2005 when the Welsh regions joined the then English-only Powergen Cup. In the 2017–18 Anglo-Welsh Cup, all four of the Welsh regions finished bottom of their pools. In May 2018, the Welsh Rugby Union announced that they were going to be setting up a Welsh under-23s competition for their regions and would thus be unable to commit to Anglo-Welsh Cup games. Premiership Rugby Limited, which organises the English top flight, then announced that the Anglo-Welsh Cup would be replaced by the Premiership Rugby Cup, which would be solely for the English Premiership clubs. The new Premiership Cup was created to re-establish the significance of the domestic cup competition and support development of younger English Premiership players by providing a platform to compete in more matches at Premiership stadia.\nThe 2020–21 tournament was cancelled due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFormat.\nThe format for the competition until 2019–20 consisted of the twelve Premiership teams grouped into three pools of four with at least one club having one local derby match in their groups. The matches were typically held over either the Autumn International or Rugby World Cup and Six Nations Championship weekends. The three pool winners and the best runner-up entered the semi-finals with home advantage given to the team with the better record in the pool stage and the final would be held at the home of the highest ranked club. The winning club received £500,000.\nAfter a year's hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the competition returned for 2021–22 season. The thirteen premiership rugby teams were split into one pool of five teams and two pools of four teams. Each team played the other teams in their pool and also played an additional inter pool match if required.\nFor 2023–24 the twelve teams from the RFU Championship joined the ten teams from the Premiership. The first stage of the competition took place over five consecutive weekends during the Rugby World Cup."

He played the 2013–14 season in the USHL before playing collegiate hockey with Princeton University of the ECAC conference.\nRobinson's development improved each year with the Tigers ice hockey team, increasing his points totals and role within the team. In his senior season in 2017–18, Robinson was selected as team captain.

        "title": "Rugby league in Africa",
        "text": "Rugby league in Africa refers to the involvement of the sport of rugby league in the African continent.\nAs of 2020, rugby league has seen activity in countries such as Burundi, Cameroon, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Libya, Morocco, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and South Africa.\nHistory.\nInitial establishment in South Africa.\nRugby league in Africa was first conceptualised in South Africa in the 1950s. In 1953, Ludwig Japhet headed a committee which was solely formed for the purpose of promoting the sport in the country. Ludwig had a meeting with English administrator Bill Fallowfield to discuss the possibility of developing the game in South Africa. In 1957, games were organised against Great Britain and French national teams in Benoni, Durban, and East London for the purpose of promoting the sport. However, all teams saw the fixtures as friendly matches, which also resulted in the cancellation of the third match in East London.\nAfter the death of Ludwig Japhet, two organisations were formed in a bid to continue developing rugby league in South Africa. The National Rugby League (NRL) was headed by Norman Lacey, and the Rugby League South Africa (RLSA) was formed by Maurice Smith. As both organisations saw themselves as the governing body of the sport, they each had plans to commence a competition in the summer of 1962. Unfortunately for rugby league in South Africa, the two organisations could not settle their differences and each went ahead with their own competitions; so was born rugby league in South Africa, under confusing and hostile circumstances.\nIn 1962, after a merger between the NRL and RLSA, South Africa officially became a member of the RLIF. This meant South Africa would play international test-matches for the first time. South Africa's first official test match was a 30–49 defeat against Great Britain in front of 10,000 fans in Pretoria.\nDue to the developing success South Africa were experiencing with their national game, and the national team's promising results against Great Britain, the South Africans were invited for a tour of Australia to play against the Australian national team. However, the South Africans were totally outplayed in all their matches. This had a severe impact on the development on the sport in the country, and it wouldn't be until the 1990s that they would reappear on the international scene.\n1990s: Morocco and South Africa compete globally.\nAfter the sport suffered a 30-year hiatus, Dave Southern, a former player for the Widnes Vikings, wanted to re-introduce rugby league into the country South Africa. He was playing rugby union in Johannesburg at the time. In early 1990, an advertisement was placed in the Sunday Star newspaper looking for people who were interested in playing, officiating, supporting and developing Rugby League in South Africa to call Dave Southern. As a result of a positive response, trial games were held. In 1992, South African Rugby League held its first-ever domestic competition, and the South African national team played a test-series against Russia.\nAnother country that was beginning to incorporate the idea of rugby league was Kenya. Edward Rombo, a rugby-union player, who was playing for the Leeds Rhinos at the time, wanted to introduce the sport of rugby league into Kenya.\nMorocco were also a developing rugby league nation, and became an International rugby league member in 1995 as a result. They subsequently played their first international test-matches in the 1995 Emerging Nations tournament. However, they would finish at the bottom of their pool after losing both of their encounters.\nSouth Africa would become the first African nation to compete in the Rugby League World Cup. South Africa was grouped with Australia, England, and Fiji in the 1995 World Cup. South Africa were dominated in all their matches, only managing to score 12 points in the entire tournament.\nThe 1999 World Club Challenge between the Super League and NRL champions was mooted as a showpiece fixture at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. However this didn't eventuate.\n2000s.\nIn 2000, Rombo, alongside entrepreneur Eric Murungi, set up rugby league teams, coaching, and an official website in Kenya. However, despite the efforts, rugby league would struggle to establish a foothold in the country for at least another decade.\nIn 2009 there were two South Africans playing in Australia. Jarrod Saffy played for the St. George Illawarra Dragons in the game's premier NRL competition, while Allan Heldsinger played for the Redcliffe Dolphins in the Queensland Cup. In 2010 the Sydney Roosters had signed South African rugby union juniors JP Du Plessis, and Brian Skosana. The NRL had plans to sign more South Africans in the future.\nMorocco became the first African country to win an international event, by winning the 2009 Euro Med Challenge. Morocco's team included professional players Younes Khattabi and Jamal Fakir, the latter of whom had previously represented France.\n2010s: Africa United Rugby League.\nIn 2011, South Africa now had an established domestic league which included three competitions: Rhino Cup (first division), Protea Cup (second division), and Western Province Rugby League (third division).\nIn 2012, a similar concept to the Latin Heat was developed but for African-based players. This team would be known as Africa United.\nIn 2013, South Africa put forward a bid to host the 2017 World Cup. However the bid did not receive central government funding, and there were fears a South African World Cup would result in financial loss, for rugby league, due to the second nature of the sport compared to rugby union in the country.\nIn 2014, Kenya played their first ever rugby league international against an Italian representative team. 5,000 turned up to watch the match, which the Kenyans won by 10 points, at a local primary school in Watamu.\nIn 2015, South Africa were hosts of the Middle East-Africa play-off for the 2017 World Cup. The games were held in Brakpan. SARL president, Kobus Botha, hoped that this would be the first of many international events in the country, and as a result showcase the country as potential hosts for the 2021 World Cup. South Africa lost both matches to Lebanon convincingly. This resulted in the Rhinos failing to qualify for their third consecutive World Cup, and ended any possibility of SARL hosting the 2021 event.\nIn 2018, Africa United competed in the 2018 Emerging Nations Confederations Cup tournament. Africa United finished runners-up after losing to the Mediterranean-Middle East representatives in the final.\nIn 2019, former London Broncos player Ade Adebisi revealed how he was able to establish rugby league in Nigeria. A ten team competition was established, with 5 being based Lagos, and another 5 being based in the north of the country. Professional English clubs, Leeds Rhinos, Wakefield Trinity, and Whitehaven R.L.F.C., have also partnered with Nigerian RL to help set up the Lagos Rhinos, Lagos Haven, and Eko Trinity clubs.\nAs a result of Africa United, Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon were able play their first test-matches in a newly created Middle East-Africa Championship. Nigeria won the first edition, as hosts, in 2019. The Cameroon national team had to travel by bus for eight days go get to Lagos for the competition."

        "text": "The 1936 Summer Olympic Games were hosted in Germany, as determined by voting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) between May 1930 and April 1931, two years prior to the rise of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazi Party) to power. Nazi influence in Germany grew strongly after the German Federal Elections in 1932, and in January 1933, Adolf Hitler, the head of the Nazi Party, was appointed Chancellor and soon began to put his antisemitic ideology into practice.\nBy the time of the 1932 Olympics the Nazis were so much opposed to international competition that the International Olympic Committee sent its German member Karl Ritter von Halt to Hitler to reaffirm that the Games could take place at all in case the Nazis were in government. Hitler mainly said that international obligations were being kept, but did not show any enthusiasm for the Games. During 1933, Hitler's position changed and as of October 1933 the Games were seen by Hitler as a time to show the strength of the new Nazi Germany to the world; not only would the festivities be exciting and bold, but Hitler anticipated the Germans would dominate in every aspect of athletic competition. According to pseudoscientific Nazi racial theories, the Germans were seen as a \"master race\" whose physical prowess would be showcased at the Olympics.\nNazi Party views on sports and athletics.\nThe Nazis established a dictatorship in 1933, arresting their political rivals, and sought to bring all public and private institutions under their control. However, when it came to hosting the Olympics, there were no separate Nazi sports organizations. Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda Minister, was of the opinion that simply gaining power was only part of the process in creating the new German state; the Nazis needed to win the heart of the people. Sports were crucial to this success, as according to him it would \"strengthen the character of the German people, imbuing it with the fighting spirit and steadfast camaraderie necessary in the struggle for its existence\". Eventually Goebbels' ministry had eleven sections dedicated to athletics. Jewish athletes were expelled from all organized athletics, as mandated by the German Olympic Committee.\nOrganization and propaganda.\nInvitations to the Games were sent out to the Olympic Committees of various countries. Publicly, in sports and athletics Hitler had no stated policies about athletes and competitors, but his racism had caused worry among members of the IOC. Finland and Italy were the first to accept. Support for the Games within Germany was heavily sought after by Joseph Goebbels. He believed that every German should share in the responsibility of presenting the Games to the rest of the world. Goebbels' Ministry promoted the Olympics with colorful posters and athletic imagery, drawing a link between Nazi Germany and ancient Greece. Leni Reifenstahl, the film maker behind \"Triumph of the Will\" (1934), was employed and created a controversial documentary titled \"Olympia\" (1938) about the Summer Games. Elaborate plans were created and constructed, including a new stadium as well as a state-of-the-art Olympic Village. Hitler placed the full resources of the state behind the Olympic preparations. Goebbels and the Nazi regime covered up their violent, racist policies throughout the Games by removing anti-Semitic signs and toning back rhetoric of newspapers. Orders were made to allow foreign visitors to bypass certain laws and not be subjugated to Nazi homophobic laws. Tourists were mainly unaware of the change in the political atmosphere, thus the Nazi regime was successful in bypassing foreign scrutiny of their racial policies. The Games were exploited by Hitler and his Party, and spectators and journalists from around the world were presented with the fraudulent image of a tolerant and peaceful Germany.\nForeign appeasement.\nThe International Olympic Committee as well the Committees of several countries, attempted to rectify the racial issues in Germany. Henri de Baillet-Latour, the President of the IOC, was aware of the German sports authorities and the restrictive training possibilities for 'non-Aryans'. Boycott movements around the world surfaced in the United States, Great Britain, France, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and the Netherlands, as rumors of Nazi racism spread. Fierce debate occurred in the United States, causing some worry to the Nazis. The United States traditionally sends one of the largest teams to the games, generating interest and tourism. Many individual Jewish athletes boycotted the games or their country's qualifying trials. However, Baillet-Latour continued to support the German Olympic Committee, and reassured foreign visitors to the Nazi Games that they would, \"receive a cordial welcome without the risk of experiencing anything which might offend their principles\". The boycott movement eventually failed.\nJewish athletes excluded from participation.\nThe 'Aryans only' policies in Nazi Germany caused many world-class athletes to be left out of competitions. Jews or individuals with Jewish parents were systematically excluded from German sports facilities and associations. What follows is a short list of specific athletes banned from representing their country in world events.\nGerman placation.\nHelene Mayer, a fencer, was allowed on the German National team in order to appease international opinion. She herself was not Jewish, but she was viewed as 'non-Aryan' because her father was Jewish. She went on to win a silver medal, and on the podium, like all other German athletes, proceeded to give the Nazi salute."

A professional snooker player for various years from 1988 to 2000, he won the IBSF World Billiards Championship in 1997. First competing as an amateur in the 1979s, he competed in amateur and professional snooker and billiards championships in a career spanning nearly 40 years.

He was a part of the team which won the EBSA European Team Championship seniors tournament in 2011. Grech died on 21 August 2021, aged 66.\nHonours.\nGrech was awarded the Midalja għall-Qadi tar-Repubblika in 1997 after becoming the world champion.

First, the Shell Trophy (also known as the Plunket Shield), the first-class competition contested by the six major association teams, was becoming expensive to run in its double round robin format. Second, it was felt that the standard of New Zealand cricket would be improved by holding a competition in which the six teams combined to make three teams, and adding a team from overseas to make a four-team single round robin format.\nThe three domestic teams were:\nThe overseas teams were Bangladesh in 1997–98 and Pakistan A in 1998–99.\nThe format was abandoned after the 1998–99 season. In 2000–01 the Plunket Shield resumed its place as New Zealand’s only first-class competition, returning to its double round robin format.\nPlaying record.\nNorthern Conference played seven first-class matches, winning two, drawing four and losing one. They played four List A matches, winning the first two and losing the next two.\n1997–98: Captained by Dion Nash, Northern Conference won the first-class competition in 1997–98. They won their first two matches—Bangladesh by an innings and Southern Conference by 86 runs—and finished on top of the table after the round robin, then drew the final against Southern Conference with a first-innings lead.\nOf the seven centuries scored in the competition, Northern Conference batsmen scored four: two to Mark Bailey and one each to Nash and Blair Pocock. Of the 10 bowlers who took 10 or more wickets in the competition, four were Northern Conference bowlers, of whom Mark Haslam had the best average, 13 wickets at 13.23.\n1998–99: Again captained by Nash in 1998–99, Northern Conference drew their first match when a sub-standard pitch caused its abandonment, and drew their last, which was curtailed by rain. In between they lost by an innings to Central Conference. They finished last. None of their batsmen scored a century, and their best bowler was Daniel Vettori, who took nine wickets."

        "text": "The Rugby Football League Championship First Division was the top division of rugby league in Great Britain between 1895 and 1996, when it was replaced by the Super League.\nHistory.\n1895–1904: Foundations.\nThe first season of rugby league (1895–96) saw all the breakaway clubs play in a single league competition. The addition of new teams and the problems of travelling led to the league being split in two for the following season; into the Yorkshire League and the Lancashire League. This arrangement lasted until the 1901–02 season, when the top clubs from each league resigned and formed a single new competition. The following season the remaining clubs in the Yorkshire and Lancashire Leagues were re-organised to form a second division.\n1905–1970: Restructure.\nIn 1905–06 the two divisions were re-combined into a single competition. Clubs played all the teams in their own county on a home-and-away basis, results counting towards the re-formed Yorkshire and Lancashire Leagues. They also organised inter-county fixtures on an individual basis; all results were collated into a single table for the Championship. In order to even up the competition a top-four play-off series was used to determine the Championship.\nApart from the interventions of the two world wars, this system was retained until the 1962–63 season, when the league briefly returned to a two divisional system. This lasted only two years, and in the 1964–65 season they returned to one large division subdivided into county leagues. The play-offs were expanded to the top 16 teams and the Harry Sunderland Trophy was introduced as the man-of-the-match award for the decider.\n1970–1995: Premiership and reintroducing Second Division.\nIn the 1973–74 season they once again went back to two divisions. The play-off and the Yorkshire and Lancashire League were abandoned, and a new play-off type competition, the Premiership, was introduced however the team finishing top of the Championship were crowned champions. During this period in the late 1980s and early 1990s Wigan dominated both the Championship and Challenge Cup."

        "text": "Germany has participated in every edition of the World Athletics Championships since 1991. Prior to 1991, separate West Germany and East Germany teams competed at the global athletics competition. Germany has won the fifth highest total of gold medals at the event and has the fifth highest medal total overall. \nGermany's delegations are typically among the largest at the competition, numbering around 60-80 athletes. The country has a strong history in the sport for both men's and women's teams, and it enters competitors in most events at each championships. It ranks second behind the United States in the World Athletics placing tables, which awards points for top eight finishes. Germany has been most successful in the men's and women's throwing events, and the field events more generally. Its relay teams are competitive and regularly make the finals.\nThe country's most successful athlete is men's discus throw champion Lars Riedel, who from 1991 to 2001 won five world titles and one bronze medal. Another discus thrower, Robert Harting, has three gold medals and one silver medal to his name. Several women hold a claim to be Germany's most successful female athlete: Astrid Kumbernuss and Franka Dietzsch each have won three gold medals in throwing events, sprinter Grit Breuer has the highest total at six medals, while another sprinter Katrin Krabbe has two golds and two bronze medals (all won in 1991).\nAs of the 2019 World Athletics Championships, no German athlete has been disqualified from the competition for doping."

        "title": "Rugby World Cup '95",
        "text": "Rugby World Cup '95 is a video game developed by Creative Assembly and published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Genesis and DOS.\nGameplay.\n\"Rugby World Cup '95\" is a rugby game. The game was EA's first attempt at a rugby union simulation. The game uses the same engine as FIFA International Soccer, adapted by Electronic Arts's Slough development team to resemble the rules of rugby union instead of association football. Like FIFA, the game utilises an isometric viewpoint. The player controls one of the fifteen rugby players on their team at a time, with the ability to switch players on command. The game allows up to four human players at the same time, each controlling a different rugby player. The human players can choose to control a rugby player on the same team or on opposing teams. The remaining rugby players are controlled by the computer.\nFour modes of play — Friendly, World Cup, World Cup 95 and League — are available. Friendly engages the player in a single match between two teams of the player's choice. World Cup mode resembles the format of the Rugby World Cup, with the player controlling a team of their choice through a series of matches, starting with ? group matches with the possibility of progressing to ? further matches in a knockout format. World Cup 95 mode features the same format, but with the teams taking part and the order of the matches at the group stage being the same as the 1995 edition of the tournament. League consists of eight teams who contest a double round-robin tournament.\nThe game features all twenty national teams that participated in the 1995 Rugby World Cup, a further ten countries that participated in the qualifying stages, plus two fictional teams - the EA Barbarians and EA Maulers. The players on each of the teams have fictional names.\nPlayable nations.\n\"There are 30 national teams in the game\"\nReception.\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Genesis version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"\"Rugby World Cup '95\" is a quality sports game serving as a great welcome to the sport of rugby, oh, and not to mention the game is damn fun.\" Mean Machines magazine rated the Genesis version 90% and described it as \"a spot-on conversion\" of the sport. They described the player animation as \"superb\", noted that there was no evident slowdown when all thirty players appeared on screen at once, and noted that \"absolute control is offered over the players\"\nStuart Campbell reviewed the DOS version in PC Gamer, criticising the isometric perspective by stating it was difficult to work out where on the pitch the action was taking place from the markings and where other players on the team were located. He also noted that possession of the ball after a tackle appears to be decided at random, and the kicking controls take too long for the player to carry out and usually get interrupted by a tackle as a result. Awarding the game a score of 52%, Campbell's overall verdict was that it \"concentrates on realism at the expense of gameplay, but doesn't make a very good job of either\"."

Both men's and women's tournaments were held, with 12 women's and 16 men's teams competing, representing 19 different nations. Each team selected 12 players for the tournament. The men's competition was won by Great Britain, with the United States winning silver and Australia winning bronze. The women's competition was won by the Netherlands, with Great Britain winning silver and the host nation winning bronze.\nMedallists.\nThis was the best ever performance at a wheelchair basketball world championship by both the British men's and women's teams. The former had never won an official championship before (they had claimed the 1973 unofficial title), and the latter had never made the finals.\nSquads.\nEach of the 16 men's and 12 women's teams (from 19 different nations) selected a squad of 12 players for the tournament. Athletes are given an eight-level-score specific to wheelchair basketball, ranging from 0.5 to 4.5. Lower scores represent a higher degree of disability. The sum score of all players on the court cannot exceed 14.\nMen.\nPerformances.\nAll-Star Team.\nSource:\nWomen.\nPerformances.\nAll-Star Team.\nSource:\nControversy.\nDuring the women's game between China and Algeria, a Chinese coach struck one of his players. When the incident was reported to the Tournament Technical Committee (TTC), it immediately issued a one-match suspension. This was the maximum penalty that it could impose. However, the TTC felt that this penalty was inadequate, and referred the matter to the Secretary General of the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation, Maureen Orchard, who suspended the coach from the tournament."

This was the second edition of the European Rowing Championships and the first time that the coxed pair boat class was included.\nAt the FISA Congress held on 15 September, five federations were represented.\nEvent schedule.\nFISA, the International Rowing Federation, had been founded in 1892 and one of the motivations for having the body is to standardise the rules of racing which varied greatly, even within countries. Race distances were variable. The 1894 European Rowing Championships were raced over a 2000 m distance for all four boat classes; it just so happened that the available straight on the Saône allowed for this race distance. Nevertheless, this became the standard race distance and the 1894 Championships are credited with having set this distance.\nFour races took place on 16 September 1894. As only four teams competed, no heats had to be rowed. The teams represented France, Italy and Belgium. In addition, there was a team from Trieste. That city had only just (in 1891) lost its status as a free port and belonged to the Austria-Hungarian Empire. Contemporary sources list Trieste as being represented rather than Austria-Hungary. A rowing union had formed in Trieste and the decision had been made to send a coxed four to France. There were four rowing clubs competing for the honour to represent the port city. Three regattas were held during August that were all won by the team from Ginnastica."

        "title": "CUS Roma Rugby",
        "text": "CUS Roma Rugby is the rugby union section of Centro Universitario Sportivo di Roma, founded in 1947. During its history, the team took part in several national first division championships and won the Coppa Italia during the 1966–67 season.\nDue to financial problems, the union rejected the application of the university team to the 2016–17 Serie B season and the team is at risk of disappearing. In CUS Roma for that season it only remains the under-18 team which took part in the regional championship where it reached the second place.\nHistory.\nThe \"CUS Roma Rugby\" is born officially in 1947 as the rugby union section of the Centro Universitario Sportivo di Roma, which collects the legacy of the university sports group of the fascist era. Under the name GUF Roma, the team took part in serie A from 1934/35 to 1942/43, last championship played before the suspension due to the bellic events.\nIn 1950–51 CUS Roma is the first university club in the post-war to return in the top division. It was a short-lived experience, terminated with the relegation in serie B. In 1956–57 the team takes part again in Serie A, where they manage to resist for three consecutive seasons.\nThe first golden age for CUS Roma opens in 1962–63 with the return in the top division. The university club was suddenly projected to the top of the Italian rugby union. In 1964–65 and in 1965–66 CUS was in the second place for two consecutive times behind the eventual Italian champions, Partenope.\nIn 1966–67 the team reaches the third place, behind L'Aquila and the eventual champions, Fiamme Oro Padova. In the same season, in a historic final, CUS Roma beats CUS Torino 15–3 and wins the first edition of Coppa Italia.\nThe magical era stopped abruptly the following year, when CUS experienced one of the several splits that devastated its history. The entire team passed in block to Buscaglione Roma, a newly formed team which acquired CUS' sports tile and the right to take part in the top division. The university club had to start over. The team would not return to Serie A until the summer of 1974, with the victory against CUS Napoli in the decisive play-off which was played inL'Aquila, even if the permanence in the top division that time lasted the timespan of one season.\nThe club's importance at domestic level is witnessed also by the election of Sergio Luzzi-Conti, former head of the rugby union section and then CUS Roma president, to the office of president of Federazione Italiana Rugby, which he maintained from 1971 to 1974. In 1973 Luzzi-Conti was the inspirator of Italy first tour in South Africa, which marked an important breakthrough for the Italian rugby union.\nThe second CUS Roma Rugby's golden age was in the 1980s, with Alberto Gualtieri as chairman. The university club returns in Serie A for a season in 1982–83, but it was not until 1986–87 where the journey of a generation of new talents started. In four consecutive seasons the team takes parte to the Serie A1, new name assumed by the top division. In those years the championship registered the presence of the most important international players, who joined from the major Italian clubs. In the historic Acqua Acetosa field, CUS faced several rugby stars such as David Campese, John Kirwan and Naas Botha.\nNotwithstanding with the disproportion between the forces in field, CUS Roma does not demerit and, according to many fans, played the most beautiful and spectacular game of the championship, thanks to the quality of its backs. Many CUS players in those years were called up in the national team (Tinari, Pratichetti, Caranci, Salvati, De Biase, Ambrosio, to cite a few names). The player that was a symbol of that generation was Stefano Barba, centre with outstanding attack abilities who took part at the 1987 Rugby World Cup and collected more than 30 caps for Italy.\nIn the same years the youth sector was submitted to a development, which reached the top levels of the domestic scene, as demonstrated in the several finals reached in the various categories and the title of Italian Champion won by the under-17 squad in 1983.84 (under the name \"CUS Roma\") and in 1985/86 (under the name \"Primavera Roma\"). However, a breakaway group of executives and coaches of the youth teams in the late 1980s founded an autonomous team, U.S. Primavera, where the youth sector growth is still one of the club's main goals.\nIn the early 1990s the university sports facilities in Tor di Quinto was inaguruated, where it stands \"the biggest rugby field in Italy\". CUS Roma finally had an own playing field. It could be the chance for a further step forward, but the rising financial restraints and a series of team vicissitudes marked the start of an era of gradual resizing of the CUS' ambitions.\nThe first team, relegated in Serie A2 in 1989–90, dispute again a competition in the top division in 1993–94. In the following season the team plays in Serie A2 and is relegated to Serie B to later return in Serie A2 in 1995–96. That season was the last appearance in Serie A. Another split from a group of players and coaches gave birth to Unione Rugby Capitolina, weakening the CUS' organic in all the categories. From 1996 to 1997, CUS Roma Rugby plays in Serie B competition.\nIn the last two seasons, the entire CUS Roma team underwent a renovation, which brought to the election Gianfranco Morrone as chairman. The renovation affected also the rugby section: the new section Board, made up entirely of active players, is working hard to bring back the university rugby team of the capital to its level. At the end of the 2014–15 season, CUS Roma achieved the promotion to Serie A after 19 seasons played in Serie B (see \"La storia del CUS\" on cusromarugby.com). The 2015–2016 season was not as lucky for the team, which did not manage to remain in the top division, thus being relegated to Serie B."

The course sits next to the 311 acre (1.3 km²) Olmsted Brothers-designed Weequahic Park, which features a 2.2-mile rubberized jogging path around its 80-acre (324,000 m²) lake. It is also adjacent to Evergreen Cemetery, an American cemetery and located at 1137 North Broad Street, Hillside.\nThe course is home to golf pro legend Wiley Williams, who was one of the first African-American golfers to win a major New Jersey golf event and worked to introduce city youth to the sport. The course is also home to the First Tee Program of Essex County which teaches youth to golf.\nThe course was described in 2016 by the Golf Channel as a \"hidden gem.\""

        "text": "Samuel George Skinner (born 31 January 1995) is a professional rugby union player who plays as a lock for United Rugby Championship club Edinburgh. Born in England, he represents Scotland at international level after qualifying on ancestry grounds.\nEarly life.\nSkinner's father comes from Ayr.\nSkinner studied at the University of Exeter, achieving a first in business and economics, and captaining the University side to the 2016 BUCS Championship.\nClub career.\nAfter a late growth spurt, Skinner started his career with Taunton Titans. He played ten matches in National League Two South during the 2014-15 season.\nHe was then offered an academy deal by Exeter Chiefs, which he juggled with studying for his degree. This was later upgraded to a three year pro deal. “I trained and played for Exeter Chiefs alongside the university team [captaining Exeter to the BUCS Championship in 2016] and studied full-time,” explained Skinner. “They [the Chiefs] were brilliant. If I needed a week off for exams they were excellent at giving me that time. I was a late developer, I signed for Exeter at 90kg so for a year they allowed me to develop, to put on another 5-10kg and get my size up to Premiership and international level.”\nOn 14 November 2014, Skinner made his first-team debut in the LV Cup against Gloucester Rugby before making his Premiership debut against Northampton Saints. He scored his first top try for the Chiefs in a 36-14 home win over Newcastle Falcons in February 2017 before starting his first game against Wasps RFC in September 2017. His debut was called the ‘performance of the weekend’ in The Daily Telegraph. In May 2018, Skinner was a second-half replacement for Mitch Lees as Exeter lost to Saracens in the Premiership Grand Final at Twickenham Stadium. He was described as one of Exeter's ‘standout players this season’.\nSkinner won two Premierships with Exeter, and the Champions Cup in the double-winning year of 2020, before switching to Edinburgh Rugby in 2022.\nInternational career.\nWhile with Taunton he was picked up by the Scottish Exiles programme.\nIn June 2015, Skinner scored a try for the England Under-20 team against Wales in the pool stage of the 2015 World Rugby Under 20 Championship. Skinner came off the bench for the last five minutes in the final as England finished runners up to New Zealand.\nQualifying through this father, in October 2018 Skinner was called up to the senior Scotland squad for the Autumn Internationals.\nOn 10 November 2018 he was given his Scotland international debut, starting at lock against Fiji at Murrayfield Stadium. Skinner received the Man of the Match award; making 7 tackles and 44 metres in the game.\nA hamstring injury prevented Skinner contending for a world cup place. In 2023 Skinner was selected in Scotland's 33 player squad for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France."

Unveiled in 1927, it was the first equestrian statue of a monarch created by a woman sculptor.\nDescription.\nThe statue shows Christian IX of Denmark on horseback, holding the reins of the horse in his left hand.\nHistory.\nConstruction of the third and current Christiansborg Palace began in 1907 after the second Christiansborg Palace had been destroyed in a fire in 1884. Following Christian IX's death on 29 January 1906, it was decided to commemorate him with an equestrian statue that would complement the equestrian statue of Frederick VII in front of the palace. An invited competition held in 1908 was won by Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen. She found the model for the horse in Hannover, Germany. A wooden mockup of the sculpture was installed at Christiansborg Ridebane in 1911.\nThe statue was cast in royal bronze caster Carl and Poul Lauritz Rasmussen's foundry in Nørrebro. The plinth was designed by the architect Andreas Clemmesen and executed in stone carver Scheller's workshop. The monument was unveiled on 15 November 1927."

        "text": "The 2018–19 Rugby Pro D2 was the second-level French rugby union club competition, behind the Top 14, for the 2018–19 season. It ran alongside the 2018–19 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nOn 29 March 2019, Massy became the first side to be relegated, a narrow home defeat against Montauban condemning them to the drop with four games still left to play. The other relegation spot was much more keenly fought, going all the way to the last round, when on 5 May 2019 Bourg-en-Bresse were the second team to go down, despite winning their final game, just 1 point behind 14th placed Aurillac. Massy and Bourg-en-Bresse drop to Fédérale 1.\nThe promotion play-off final was between Brive (1st in the league stage) and Bayonne (3rd). As they had topped the league stage, Brive were slight favourites to make an instant return to the Top 14, while Bayonne had had two tough games including a memorable 38-34 semi-final away against league runners up, Oxonnax, who like Brive had also hoped to make an instant return to the Top 14. In the final held at the Stade du Hameau, Pau, Bayaonne shaded a close game, 21–19, to win their first ever Pro D2 title and return to the Top 14 after an absence of two seasons.\nDefeated finalists Brive had a second shot at promotion when they faced 2018–19 Top 14 13th placed side, Grenoble, in the relegation playoff. Brive won 28–22 to take Grenoble's place and join Bayonne in the 2019–20 Top 14. Grenoble and bottom club, Perpignan, would be relegated to the 2019–20 Rugby Pro D2.\nTeams.\nChanges in the lineup from 2017–18 were:\nCompetition format.\nThe regular season uses a double round-robin format, in which each team plays the others home and away.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nStarting with the 2017–18 season, Pro D2 conducts a play-off system identical to the one currently used in Top 14, with the top six teams qualifying for the play-offs and the top two teams receiving byes into the semi-finals. The winner of the play-offs earns the league championship and automatic promotion to the next season's Top 14; the runner-up enters a play-off with the second-from-bottom Top 14 team, with the winner of that play-off taking up the final place in Top 14.\nThis replaced the previous system in which the top team at the end of the regular season was declared champion, also earning a Top 14 place, while the second- through fifth-place teams competed in promotion play-offs. The play-off semi-finals were played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final was then played on neutral ground, and the winner earned the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nPromotion.\nPro D2 to Top 14.\nAs noted above, both promotion places will be determined by play-offs from 2017 to 2018 forward, with the winner of the Pro D2 play-offs earning promotion and the runner-up playing the second-from-bottom Top 14 team for the next season's final Top 14 place.\nFédérale 1 to Pro D2.\nAt the same time, LNR and the French Rugby Federation (FFR) changed the promotion process from Fédérale 1 to Pro D2. For three seasons (2017–18 to 2019–20), only one team will be promoted to Pro D2 through the Fédérale 1 competition. The second promotion place will be a \"wild card\" granted by LNR to a club that meets the following criteria:\nStarting with the 2020–21 season, LNR will create a third professional league, slotting between Pro D2 and Fédérale 1 in the league system.\nRelegation.\nNormally, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to Fédérale 1 at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher-placed team to be demoted instead, or bar a Fédérale 1 team from promotion.\nRelegation playoff.\nThe team finishing in 13th place of the Top 14 faces the runner-up of Pro D2, with the winner of this match playing in the 2019–20 Top 14 and the loser in the 2019–20 Pro D2.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags to the left of player names indicate national team as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules, or primary nationality for players who have not yet earned international senior caps. Players may hold one or more non-WR nationalities."

        "text": "The knockout stage of the 2019 Cricket World Cup consisted of two semi-finals, played at Old Trafford in Manchester on 9 July and Edgbaston in Birmingham on 11 July, and a final, at Lord's on 14 July. It was the third time Edgbaston hosted a World Cup semi-final and the fourth at Old Trafford – a record for a World Cup venue.\nRules.\nAll of the knockout games had a reserve day. If a reserve day came into play, the match would not be restarted but resumed from the previous day's play (if any). In the event of no play on the scheduled day or the reserve day, in the semi-finals, the team that finished higher in the group stage progressed to the final, and if no play were possible in the final, the trophy would be shared. If any match ended in a tie, a Super Over would be used to determine the winner; each team would select three batsmen and a bowler, with the full team available to field. There would be no penalty for the loss of a wicket, but the loss of two wickets would end the Super Over. If the scores in the Super Over were also tied, the winner would be determined by the two teams' overall boundary count, including both the match itself and the Super Over.\nQualification.\nOn 25 June 2019, Australia became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals, after beating England at Lord's. India were next to qualify, thanks to victory over Bangladesh at Edgbaston on 2 July. The following day saw tournament hosts England become the third team to qualify, after they beat New Zealand at the Riverside Ground. New Zealand were the fourth and final team to qualify, after Pakistan were unable to increase their net run rate sufficiently enough in their match against Bangladesh at Lord's. As group winners, India faced fourth-placed New Zealand in the first semi-final, while the second semi-final will feature Australia and England, who finished second and third, respectively. The International Cricket Council (ICC) appointed the umpires for the two matches on 7 July.\nSemi-finals.\nDue to persistent rain, the first semi-final was suspended in the 47th over of New Zealand's innings, and continued on 10 July. New Zealand eventually posted a total of 239/8 from their 50 overs; in response, India were bowled out for 221, 18 runs short, sending New Zealand through to their second Cricket World Cup final, having also played in the final in 2015.\nThe second semi-final saw England take on Australia at Edgbaston. Australia won the toss and chose to bat first, but lost three of their top four batsmen for single-figure scores, two of them to Chris Woakes, to reduce them to 14/3 a ball into the seventh over. Steve Smith held his wicket to top-score with 85 as Australia were bowled out for 223 with Woakes and Rashid being the best of the bowlers with three wickets apiece. England, with the help of an unbroken partnership of 79 between Joe Root and captain Eoin Morgan, saw them ease to an eight-wicket victory and their first World Cup final since 1992.\nIn popular culture.\nAn Australian docu-series - The Test was produced, following the Australian national cricket team in the aftermath of the Australian ball tampering scandal. The sixth episode of Season 1 featured Australia playing the semi-final against England."

        "text": "The 2019 Cricket World Cup Final was a One Day International cricket match played at Lord's in London, England, on 14 July 2019 to determine the winner of the 2019 Cricket World Cup. It was contested by the runners-up from the previous tournament, New Zealand, and the host nation, England. It was the fifth time Lord's had hosted the Cricket World Cup Final, the most of any ground.\nThe two teams were tied on 241 runs at the end of the match, resulting in a Super Over being played to break the tie. On the final ball of New Zealand's Super Over, after equalling the 15 runs England managed in their over, Martin Guptill attempted to score the winning run but was run out by Jason Roy and Jos Buttler, meaning the Super Over was also tied. England won on the boundary count-back rule, having scored 26 boundaries to New Zealand's 17, thus becoming Cricket World Cup winners for the first time.\nIt was the first time a One Day International final match required a Super Over, and subsequently the first time it had been decided by a boundary count. The match has been described as one of the greatest and most dramatic in the history of the sport, with some analysts describing it as the greatest match in the history of one-day cricket.\nBackground.\nThe 2019 Cricket World Cup started on 30 May and was hosted by England and Wales. Ten teams played each other once in a round-robin format with the top four teams going through to the semi-finals. Fourth-placed New Zealand beat group winners India in the first semi-final, and England, who finished third in the group, defeated second-placed Australia in the second.\nEngland played in their first final in 27 years, their last appearance coming in 1992, when they were defeated by Pakistan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Their other appearances in the final were in 1979 against the West Indies at Lord's and 1987 against Australia at Eden Gardens. Despite playing in the second-highest number of finals in the World Cup after Australia, they were yet to win the trophy. New Zealand played in their second final, and also their second in a row. They previously played in the 2015 final but were beaten by Australia.\nWhen England reached the final, demand increased greatly for it to be shown on a free-to-air television channel in the United Kingdom. Rights holders Sky Sports agreed to allow Channel 4, who had the rights to broadcast evening highlights of the tournament, to carry the final in a simulcast (England cricket matches are not compulsory events requiring free-to-air broadcast). However, due to an existing commitment by Channel 4 to cover the 2019 British Grand Prix, the coverage switched to their sister channel More4 during the motor racing, returning to Channel 4 after the Grand Prix had finished. It was the first time an England international match had been broadcast on free-to-air television in the UK since the 2005 Ashes series.\nWhichever team won the match would become the first new winner of the World Cup since Sri Lanka's victory in 1996. It was also the first world final with a guaranteed new winner since 1992.\nRoad to the final.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand retained the majority of the team that reached their maiden World Cup Final as co-hosts in 2015, although Kane Williamson took on the captaincy following Brendon McCullum's retirement. They finished level on 11 points with Pakistan in the round-robin stage (five wins, three losses and one no result after their match against India was interrupted by rain), but took fourth place by virtue of a better net run rate than Pakistan.\nIn the semi-finals, they were paired with India, who finished first in the round-robin stage. The match was played at Old Trafford in Manchester on 9 July. With New Zealand on 211/5 after 46.1 overs, Williamson having scored 67 and Ross Taylor on the same score at the time, the match was suspended by rain and ultimately play was pushed to the reserve day the next day. Eventually finishing on 239/8, Taylor eventually out for 74, they produced a spirited bowling and fielding performance to leave India 18 runs short. Man of the Match Matt Henry took 3/37, including openers Rohit Sharma and K. L. Rahul caught for just one each and Dinesh Karthik spectacularly caught by James Neesham for 6. Meanwhile, fellow pace bowler Trent Boult had captain Virat Kohli trapped lbw for one and top scorer Ravindra Jadeja caught by Williamson for 77 when a seventh-wicket partnership looked to be swinging the match back in India's favour. Finally, Martin Guptill ran out World Cup-winning captain MS Dhoni for 50 with a direct hit to leave India with just their tail.\nEngland.\nEngland, by contrast, entered as the top-ranked ODI team after director of cricket and former Ashes-winning captain Andrew Strauss helped orchestrate the national team's white-ball revamp following their bowing out in the group stage in 2015. Only a handful of the players who featured in 2019, including Irish-born captain Eoin Morgan, Test captain Joe Root, wicket-keeper Jos Buttler and bowling all-rounder Chris Woakes, were holdovers from that team, though a good number played in the narrow defeat against the West Indies in the 2016 World Twenty20 Final. Morgan was also the lone remaining member of England's 2010 World Twenty20 champion team – England's only ICC world championship going into this final.\nTheir campaign was nearly derailed after a loss at Lord's to defending champions and arch-rivals Australia left them having to beat both India and New Zealand to guarantee their semi-final spot. They won both games and finished third in the round-robin stage with 12 points (six wins and three losses out of nine matches). They met group runners-up Australia in the second semi-final at Edgbaston on 11 July and soundly defeated them by 8 wickets to progress to the final. Key moments included Woakes having David Warner caught for 9, Jofra Archer trapping captain Aaron Finch lbw for a golden duck, Buttler running out Australian top scorer and former captain Steve Smith through his legs on 85 and Jason Roy's 85 off 65 as England completed their chase with 107 balls to spare.\nMatch.\nMatch officials.\nOn 12 July 2019, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named Sri Lankan Kumar Dharmasena and South African Marais Erasmus as the on-field umpires, with Australian Rod Tucker as the third umpire, Pakistani Aleem Dar as the reserve umpire and Sri Lankan Ranjan Madugalle named as match referee.\nTeams and toss.\nBoth teams remained unchanged from their semi-final matches; New Zealand decided that the line-up that beat India against the odds would work in their favour in the final, while England's Jason Roy avoided suspension after his show of dissent in their semi-final match against Australia to open the batting for the hosts.\nSome early rain slightly delayed the toss, with the match starting at 10:45, 15 minutes later than scheduled. It was feared that the rain would interfere with the match, but it cleared up quickly, although the overcast conditions and wet grass changed the dynamic of the toss. New Zealand won the toss and decided to bat first.\nNew Zealand innings.\nMartin Guptill and Henry Nicholls opened the innings for New Zealand, with Nicholls scoring his first half-century of the tournament. A further 30 runs from captain Kane Williamson, and 47 from wicket-keeper Tom Latham, helped New Zealand to a total of 241/8 from their 50 overs. Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett took three wickets each for the hosts.\nEngland innings.\nDefending a middling score, the New Zealand bowlers bowled effectively, hampering England's top order, with only Jonny Bairstow managing more than a start with 36. With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over; however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught. But with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two dot balls, Stokes hit a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket, bringing their score to 233/8.\nFrom the third-last ball of the final over, Stokes drove the ball into mid-wicket. Guptill fielded the ball and threw it back to the striker's end as Stokes was returning to complete a second run; however, as Stokes dived for the crease, the ball deflected off his bat and to the boundary behind the wicket, resulting in four runs being added to the two that Stokes had run. The final two deliveries went for a run each, but England lost their last two wickets going for a second run each time.\nSuper Over.\nWith the scores tied at 241, the match went to a Super Over. Stokes and Buttler returned to the crease for England to face the bowling of Trent Boult; the pair scored 15 runs without loss, with both batsmen contributing a boundary four. For New Zealand, Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer, needing 16 runs to claim the title. Archer's over started badly, beginning with a wide, and a steady accumulation of runs, along with a six from Neesham off the third ball, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery. Facing his first ball of the Super Over and the last of the match, Guptill hit the ball to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one, and Guptill was run out well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs, the Super Over tied, but England's superior boundary count (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they won the World Cup title for the first time in four final appearances. Stokes earned Man of the Match honours with his unbeaten 84, plus eight runs in the Super Over.\nMatch details.\nFall of wickets: 1/29 (Guptill, 6.2 ov), 2/103 (Williamson, 22.4 ov), 3/118 (Nicholls, 26.5 ov), 4/141 (Taylor, 33.1 ov), 5/173 (Neesham, 39 ov), 6/219 (De Grandhomme, 46.5 ov), 7/232 (Latham, 48.3 ov), 8/240 (Henry, 49.3 ov)\nFall of wickets: 1/28 (Roy, 5.4 ov), 2/59 (Root, 16.3 ov), 3/71 (Bairstow, 19.3 ov), 4/86 (Morgan, 23.1 ov), 5/196 (Buttler, 44.5 ov), 6/203 (Woakes, 46.1 ov), 7/220 (Plunkett, 48.3 ov), 8/227 (Archer, 49 ov), 9/240 (Rashid, 49.5 ov), 10/241 (Wood, 50 ov)\nSuper Over\nPost-match.\nReaction.\nThe closeness of the match, with scores being level even after the end of the Super Over and England claiming the tie-breaker by having scored more boundaries throughout the match, combined with the dramatic turn of events in the final hour and the fact that it was played as a Cricket World Cup Final, led to many former and active players, analysts and media outlets describing it as the greatest cricket match ever played. Former England one-day bowler Stuart Broad called it \"the best white ball game of all time\". England players Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow declared the World Cup Final as \"the greatest game ever\".\n\"The Guardian\"s live commentator wrote: \"That is the most amazing game I have ever seen in my life.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" called it \"one of the most dramatic clashes in cricket history\", while \"ABC News\" referred to it as \"the greatest ODI ever played\". The headline of \"The Week\" was \"Super human Ben Stokes drags England to victory in the greatest cricket match\". With Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer contesting the Wimbledon Championships' longest ever singles final (which finished during the World Cup Final), and Lewis Hamilton winning the British Grand Prix on the same day, it was referred to as a \"golden sporting Sunday\".\nUmpire Kumar Dharmasena's decision to award England six runs following an overthrow boundary in the final over was criticised by former international umpire Simon Taufel, who said it was an \"error in judgment\" and a \"clear mistake\" by the on-field umpires. Law 19.8 of the Laws of Cricket says \"If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be: any runs for penalties awarded to either side; the allowance for the boundary; and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.\" As Stokes and Adil Rashid had not crossed at the moment the New Zealand fielder threw the ball, it was suggested that England should only have been awarded one completed run in addition to the overthrow boundary. Dharmasena later admitted this was an error, though said he would \"never regret the decision\". As a result of the incident, the Marylebone Cricket Club said it would review the overthrow rule. Some active and former players criticised the ICC rule of boundary count and not using the wicket count for a tied match. In the wake of the result of the final, the ICC scrapped the boundary count rule; teams will instead play as many Super Overs as are necessary until the one team wins.\nJacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand, said that despite the loss she felt \"incredibly proud of the Black Caps, and I hope every New Zealander does because they played remarkable cricket\". The New Zealand cricket coach, Gary Stead, said that sharing the World Cup is something that \"should be considered\".\nCelebrations.\nIn the wake of England's victory, the nation erupted into a state of national pride and celebrations that lasted into the night and most of the next day. The England team stayed at Lord's for most of the night celebrating. The next day, the team hosted an event at The Oval, inviting fans to meet and greet the team, and pose and take photos with the trophy.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May invited the England team to 10 Downing Street the day after the victory to celebrate and offer her congratulations. Former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major, himself a former Surrey County Cricket Club President and honorary life vice-president, was also in attendance. In December, Stokes was also named BBC Sports Personality of the Year, making him the first cricketer to win it since Andrew Flintoff in 2005. In the subsequent New Year's Honours List, six England players and staff received Order of the British Empire decorations: CBEs for Morgan and ECB chairman Colin Graves, OBEs for Stokes and coach Trevor Bayliss and MBEs for Buttler and Root.\nBroadcast.\nThe match was the first international cricket match to be broadcast on free-to-air TV in the United Kingdom since the 2005 Ashes series. 8.3 million viewers tuned in to see the final, making it one of the most viewed broadcasts of the year, with the highest audience share since the 2018 FIFA World Cup semi-Final between Croatia and England and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Christian V",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of Christian V, located in the centre of Kongens Nytorv, is the oldest of five equestrian statues of Danish monarchs in Copenhagen, Denmark. The equestrian statue was created by the French sculptor Abraham-César Lamoureux, inspired by French equestrian statues that had themselves been based on the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius. Dating from 1688, it was originally made in gilded lead but recast in bronze in 1939.\nDescription.\nWith direct inspiration from the equestrian statue of Louis XIII at the centre of Place des Vosges, it depicts the king dressed like a Roman imperator with a Laurel wreathed helmet.\nThe plinth is surrounded by four allegorical statues. Facing Charlottenborg Palace stand two figures of Minerva and Herkules, representing prudence and strength, while the opposite side features statues of Alexander the Great and Artemisia, personifications of fortitude and honour.\nEven though Lamoureux depicted the horse in a trot-like gait, with inspiration from Marcus Aurelius' horse at the Capitoline Hill, the design caused severe problems due to the soft metal used for the casting. The construction therefore had to be strengthened, and Lamoureux introduced a figure of a naked man crouched underneath the horse's hoof, personifying envy but in the same time affording support for the horse's barrel as the weakest point of the statue.\nHistory.\nShortly after Christian V was crowned in 1670, Kongens Nytorv was laid out as a \"place royale\" with inspiration from France. Land around the new square was distributed among interested wealthy citizens, including people from the new ranks. Buildings facing the square were required to have at least two stories and meet certain standards. The French sculptor Abraham-César Lamoureux was commissioned to create an equestrian statue of Christian V for the centre of the square.\nIn 1688, a Baroque garden complex with trees around a parterre and the gilded equestrian statue of Christian V in its centre, was inaugurated. In 1747 the entire square was rebuilt by Frederik V as a military drill and ceremony ground for the King's troops, which was used until 1908, when the square was re-shaped to its original design.\nThe equestrian statue was created in gilded lead. Over the centuries the soft metal used for casting the statue resulted in problems, particularly with the horse's front left leg, and finally Professor Einar Utzon-Frank from the Danish Academy of Fine Arts was commissioned to recast the statue in bronze. This happened from 1939 to 1942 and the new cast was reinaugurated on 22 May 1946."

        "text": "The 2018 Preakness Stakes was the 143rd running of the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the American Triple Crown. It was a Grade I stakes race with a purse of $1.5 million for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of miles (1.9 km). It was held on May 19, 2018, at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland and was broadcast on NBC from 5:00 pm to 7:15 pm EDT with coverage of the undercard on NBCSN starting at 2:30 pm.\nIt was a very muddy track and extremely foggy at post time with visibility down to a sixteenth of a mile. Out of the gate, Justify went to the early lead while Good Magic rushed up his inside to challenge. The two matched strides for the first mile before Good Magic tired somewhat down the stretch. Justify held off a fast closing Bravazo to win by half a length, keeping alive his hopes of winning the Triple Crown. The Maryland Jockey Club reported a track record total attendance of 134,487, the second highest attendance for American thoroughbred racing events in North America during 2018.\nField.\nEntries for the 2018 Preakness were taken on May 16. As is commonly the case with the Preakness, the field for the race featured the winner and other top horses from the Kentucky Derby, facing off with several \"new shooters\" – horses who either did not qualify for the Derby or whose connections chose to bypass that race to focus on the Preakness.\nThe heavy favorite for the race was Justify, the 2018 Kentucky Derby winner, even though he bruised his heel during the running of that race. His main rival was Good Magic, the champion two-year-colt of 2017 and runner-up in the Derby. Six other horses completed the field: Quip, winner of the Tampa Bay Derby and second in the Arkansas Derby, bypassed the Kentucky Derby to focus on the Preakness; Bravazo (sixth in the Derby); Lone Sailor (eighth); Diamond King (winner of the Federico Tesio Stakes); Sporting Chance (fourth in the Blue Grass Stakes); and Tenfold (fifth in the Arkansas Derby).\nRace description.\nThe conditions for the race were so poor that the \"Washington Post\" jokingly said the track \"should have been downgraded from 'sloppy' to 'biblical'\". After heavy downpours over several days, the rain finally stopped shortly before the race but then a heavy fog descended, limiting visibility to about a sixteenth of a mile. Despite the weather, a crowd of 134,487 watched at the track, the third-largest attendance in history. Total wagering on the race was a record $61.97 million, boosted by increases in wagering on exotics such as the trifecta and superfecta. The NBC broadcast received a 5.5 overnight rating and 12 share, a 12% increase over 2017. The ratings during the race itself peaked at 6.6 overnight with a 15 share.\nThe start was critical, and Justify broke well to take the early lead. To his inside, Good Magic rushed up to challenge and the two matched strides around the first turn and down the backstretch while setting moderate fractions. They picked up the pace rounding the final turn and opened a gap on the rest of the field. However, in mid-stretch, Tenfold started closing ground rapidly to Justify's outside while Bravazo, who had trailed by five lengths in mid-stretch, was moving fastest of all in the center of the track. Justify dug in to win by half a length over Bravazo, with Tenfold just a neck further back in third, another neck in front of Good Magic.\nIt was a record-tying seventh win of the Preakness for Justify's trainer, Bob Baffert. Five of those wins came with horses who had just won the Kentucky Derby: Silver Charm, Real Quiet, War Emblem and American Pharoah. Of these, only American Pharoah went on to complete the Triple Crown by winning the Belmont Stakes. Justify later duplicated this feat in the 2018 Belmont Stakes, making Baffert only the second person to train two Triple Crown winners.\nResults.\nTimes: mile – 0:23.11; mile – 0:47.19; mile – 1:11.42; mile – 1:36.10; final – 1:55.93.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (:23.11) (:24.08) (:24.23) (:24.68) (:19.83 for final )\nReference: Equibase Chart\nPayout.\nThe 143rd Preakness payout schedule"

A four-star recruit and the top ranked player in the state of South Carolina heading into Alabama, Miller was primarily used as an outside linebacker in college, although coach Nick Saban sometimes experimented with him at inside linebacker in practice due to his versatility.\nMiller's junior season was widely hampered by injuries, but was highlighted with a sack in the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship. In his senior season, Miller was a consistent threat off the edge recording 8.5 sacks. In week 3, Miller was named SEC Defensive Player of the Week after recording 2.5 sacks and 5 total tackles against the Ole Miss Rebels. Unfortunately, Miller strained his hamstring in the 2018 Orange Bowl and missed the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship game due to the injury.\nProfessional career.\nAt the 2019 NFL Scouting Combine, Miller recorded a 38.5-inch vertical jump and had the longest arm length measured for a linebacker at 35 1/8.\nMiller was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the fourth round (115th overall) of the 2019 NFL Draft. In week 3 against the Arizona Cardinals, Miller recorded his first 2 career sacks on fellow rookie Kyler Murray in the 38–20 win.\nOn August 3, 2020, Miller opted out of the 2020 season due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 31, 2021, Miller was waived by the Panthers.\nPersonal life.\nMiller's father, Corey Miller, was a nine-year NFL veteran who spent time with the New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings."

        "title": "1898 Metropolitan Rugby Union season",
        "text": "The 1898 Metropolitan Rugby Union season was the 25th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. Seven clubs competed from May till August 1898. The season culminated in the premiership, which was won by the Pirates. The Pirates were crowned premiers by virtue of finishing the season on top of the table.\nTeams.\nSeven clubs signed up with the Metropolitan Rugby Football Union to play the Senior Premiership. Lost from last season was the Wentworth Club. Added to the premiership were two new Senior teams from Burwood and Sydney.\nSeason summary.\nThe early rounds of the 1898 Sydney Rugby Premiership underwent much upheaval. The first round of games began with 7 teams competing. However, by the second round, Burwood had struck trouble forfeiting their first game of the season (in round one they had the bye). Before round three could get underway, the Burwood club had withdrawn from the Premiership and disbanded. Burwood had not played a single game. This caused the Metropolitan Rugby Football Union to reorganise the draw for the season and readjust the points. Byes accumulated to that point were removed and the forfeit against Sydney University scratched from the ladder. Within two weeks, Paddington had also struck trouble and withdrew from the Premiership. The club disbanded soon after. The two remaining games they were scheduled to play resulted in forfeits being handed to the opposing teams. When the finals began for the two trophies, only five teams were still playing. As a result, Sydney received a bye during the first week.\nThe Pirates Football Club had been in existence since 1889 and had not much success in finals football. Climbing through the junior grades, they consistently missed out on winning the final prize. When they moved into senior football in 1893, they consistently showed moments of brilliance but lacked the consistency of a season. During the last season, they proved themselves second to Randwick and won the Agricultural Society Trophy only after protesting against winners, Randwick, on the grounds of player eligibility. In 1898, the Pirates steadily improved throughout the season. They lost the SCG Trophy semi final, but won their way through magnificently to the Agricultural Society Trophy final. They were worthy winners of the Premiership with all round skill shown across the paddock.\nThe Sydney Football Club had a tremendously successful first season in senior football. They began the year winning only one out of their first four games. Despite losing their captain to injury, the team won tough matches against strong teams to make their way into the Agricultural Society final. They came up against a classy Pirates team and went down 9 points to 3. Runners-up in their first season boded well for the future.\nAfter spending the last four seasons as premiers, the Randwick Football Club found themselves on the wrong end of crowd favour. They began the season with such great potential but with spasmodic training and injuries to key players, the team lacked the success of previous seasons. Their defence was beside none, with the team allowing only seven tries against them all season. Randwick won the Sydney Cricket Ground Trophy to salvage a tough year.\nTrophy finals.\nFinals Week 1, 2 July.\nSydney Cricket Ground Trophy.\nThe top four teams on the ladder qualified to compete for the Sydney Cricket Ground Trophy. Heavy rain caused the semi-finals to be played under difficult conditions. In the first game, Randwick played what was regarded as their best performance so far in the season. As a result, they beat the more fancied Wallaroo team 3 points to nil. The University-Pirates game was an example of good wet weather football. University scored 10 points to nil in the second half of the game to win the contest 13 points to 3. Both winning teams progressed to the final for the trophy.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nAfter missing out on playing for the SCG Trophy, the Sydney Football Club still qualified for the Agricultural Society Trophy. As no other teams were still in existence to contend for the trophy, Sydney was given a bye and moved on to the next week of finals.\nFinals Week 2, 9th, 14 July.\nSydney Cricket Ground Trophy.\nThe largest crowd in club football was in attendance for the final for the trophy on Saturday, 9th. The two teams, University and Randwick, were evenly matched and played an exciting game. The match resulted in a scoreless draw. As a result, the game was replayed on the following Thursday, 14th.\nA perfect, warm afternoon saw approximately 3,000 attend the replay final. The game was an easy win for Randwick winning 15 to 3. University failed, unlike previous games against Randwick, to win the ball in the scrum. This resulted in the winning team having plenty of time to create scoring opportunities. The win gave Randwick their fourth SCG Trophy, the third in a row.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nWith the Pirates receiving a bye, only one game was played towards the Agricultural Society Trophy on Saturday, 9th. Wallaroo met the young Sydney club at the Agricultural Society Ground. The Sydney forwards controlled the ball in the scrum using dribbling rushes. This resulted in a win to the team 15 points to 5. Some rough play occurred near the end of the game which later saw Wallaroo protest the result on the grounds of incompetence on the part of the referee. The Union dismissed the protest and Wallaroo were eliminated from the competition.\nFinals Week 3, 6 August.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nThe premiership was interrupted for a few weeks to play the Intercolonial matches, NSW v. Queensland. As a result, the semi-finals for the Agricultural Society Trophy were not played until Saturday, 6 August. The first semi saw the Premiers, Randwick, defeated by the Pirates 6 points to 3. Overall, the game disappointed with only one try each. A penalty goal gave the Pirates the win with them progressing to the final. The second semi resulted in an astonishing win for Sydney, 19 to nil. The University team played without their entire regular three-quarter line due to a measles epidemic. Sydney were the stronger team, progressing to meet the Pirates in the final.\nFinals Week 4, 13 August.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nThe final was played in wonderful warm weather and attracted a sizeable crowd of 6,000. Both teams, the Pirates and Sydney, played strong games. There was little to differ between the two forward packs. The Pirates had the stronger backs, which assisted in giving them the win, 9 to 3. Once again, both teams scored a try, with the Pirates winning the match with two penalty goals. With this victory, the Pirates won the trophy for the second year. They were also awarded their first Premiership.\nLower grades.\nThe MRFU also conducted three junior competitions: First Juniors, Second Juniors and Third Juniors.\nFirst Juniors.\nNine clubs initially signed up for the First Junior Premiership. These were: Bulwara, Marrickville, Buccaneer, Manly Federal, Adelphi, Rockdale, North Sydney, Newtown and South Sydney. By the time of the first round, Wallaroo II had joined the competition making 10 teams. During the season, both North Sydney and Bulwara withdrew from the competition leaving only 8 teams competing for a spot in the finals. At the conclusion of the regular games, South Sydney, Rockdale, Newtown and Marrickville qualified for the semi-finals. The season ended with Marrickville winning the final against South Sydney 5 points to nil and being declared Premiers.\nSecond Juniors.\nIn 1898, the Second Junior Premiership saw 9 teams sign up. These were: Endeavour, Newtown Orlando, Redfern Waratah, Forest Lodge Cambridge, Waverley, Homebush, University II, Glebe and Gladesville. By the end of the regular games, Forest Lodge Cambridge had withdrawn from the competition leaving 8 teams. Redfern Waratah and Glebe were tied at the top of the ladder with 6 wins and a draw each. The two teams faced Waverley and Newtown Orlando in the semi-finals. The final saw Glebe beat Waverley 13 to 5 at the Burwood Cricket Ground. Glebe were declared Premiers with an unbeaten record winning 8 of their matches and drawing 1.\nThird Juniors.\nThe 14 teams that signed up for the Third Junior Premiership were: Arncliffe, Botany, Endeavour II, East Sydney, Marrickville B, Summer Hill Oaklands, Victoria, Granville Royal, Willoughby Federals, Newtown Avenue, Buccaneer II, Forest Lodge Cambridge II, South Sydney B, Alexandria Premier. At the conclusion of the regular games, Botany, Granville Royal, Willoughby Federals and Forest Lodge Cambridge II qualified for the semi-finals. The final was played between Botany and Willoughby Federals which resulted in a scoreless draw. The game was replayed with Botany winning the game and the Premiership."

        "text": "Lake Merced Golf Club is an 18-hole private golf club on the West Coast of the United States, located in Daly City, California, an adjacent suburb south of San Francisco.\nFounded in 1922, the course opened the following year. Originally designed by Willie Lock, Alister MacKenzie improved the bunkers and areas around the greens in 1929, and Rees Jones handled the course update in 1996. The course lost land on its eastern boundary to eminent domain in the 1960s for the construction of Interstate 280, and several holes were altered, redesigned by Robert Muir Graves.\nTour Events.\nLake Merced was the site of the Swinging Skirts LPGA Classic for three years (2014–2016) and was the host of the LPGA Mediheal Championship for many years. Lydia Ko won three of the first four events at the course (2014, 2015, 2018). More recently, the club hosted the final stop on Steph Curry's Underrated Golf Tour, the Curry Cup.\nRenovations.\nThe course was originally designed by Willie Locke, featured more than 200 bunkers and was extremely challenging to play. Only seven years after opening, the club hired Alister MacKenzie to renovate the golf course. MacKenzie made major modifications to the course - increased the length, removed 140 bunkers while restyling the remaining 90 or so in his unique and beautiful way, and built a new 17th hole (current hole #13). The routing remained largely the same until the construction of highway 280 in 1962 encroached on the east side of the property and forced a change led by Robert Muir Graves, rerouting almost all of the golf course and dramatically changing the look, feel and playing characteristics. The MacKenzie course featured sandy waste areas, deep barrancas, signature mounding, foot bridges and foot paths. In an effort to restore the original MacKenzie vision in 2021, Gil Hanse and his team moved 75,000 cubic yards of dirt, entirely rerouting the course. One of Gil's first missions was to reimagine the land as it was prior to heavy machinery and then restore that topography. In all, Gil and his contractors rebuilt all 18 greens, created a 36,000 square foot Himalaya-style putting course, built new short-game practice areas, added a turf research nursery, refurbished 150,000 square feet of bunkering, restored and expanded all 18 tee complexes, moved the practice facility from one end of the property to the other, and installed a two-wire irrigation system using flexible, no-leak HDPE piping. The team mimicked MacKenzie's bunker design with classic cloud formations, sitting down into the green or floating above the grade, and restored the original dramatic gradation.\nGil was extraordinarily precise and committed to restoring our lost holes from the past. Utilizing the club's massive collection of historical photos, aerials and maps, he was able to restore bunkers and greens to near-perfection, taking very little personal liberties to “improve\" what he thought was an incredible golf course. From a restoration standpoint, the club couldn't be happier or more impressed by the accuracy with which Gil was able to restore these features.\nMembers described the course prior to 2021 as brutal. Now they have replaced the long, difficult uphill shots with more enjoyable downhill approaches and deep bunkering designed by Rees Jones in the mid-1990s with shallower, larger MacKenzie-style bunkering which is easier to find but also easier to escape."

        "title": "International cricket in 2019",
        "text": "The 2019 international cricket season was from May 2019 to September 2019. The 2019 Cricket World Cup in England and Wales took place during this time, starting on 30 May 2019. 10 Test matches, 78 One Day Internationals (ODIs) and 109 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is), as well as 1 Women's Test, 9 Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs) and 130 Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is), were played during this period. Additionally, a number of other T20I/WT20I matches were also scheduled to be played in minor series involving associate nations. The season started with India leading the Test cricket rankings, England leading the ODI rankings and Pakistan leading the Twenty20 rankings. On 3 May, the International Cricket Council (ICC) expanded the men's T20I rankings to include all current Full Member and Associate members of the ICC, featuring 80 teams. In the women's rankings, Australia women lead both the WODI and WT20I tables.\nConcussion replacements were allowed to be used in all international cricket matches from 1 August 2019, after the ICC approved changes to the Playing Conditions to this effect. A concussion substitute was used for the first time in international cricket when Steve Smith was replaced by Marnus Labuschagne after being struck on the neck by a bouncer in the second Test of the Ashes.\nInternational men's cricket started with a one-off ODI between England and Ireland, which England won. The 2019 Cricket World Cup was held in England, starting in May. England won their first World Cup, beating New Zealand in a Super Over, after the final finished in a tie. Following the World Cup, the 71st Ashes series was played in this season. The Ashes Tests were the first Test matches in the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. Australia retained the Ashes, after winning the fourth Test of the series. The series was drawn 2–2, the first drawn Ashes series since 1972.\nIn the one-off test between England and Ireland, Ireland were bowled out for 38 in their second innings. This was the seventh lowest innings total in Test history, and the lowest since England bowled New Zealand out for 26 in 1955. In the third Test of the Ashes, England were bowled out for 67 in their first innings and went on to win the Test; this is the first time since 1887 that a team has been bowled out for less than 70 in their first innings and went on to win the match.\nThe 2019 Romania T20 Cup saw several records set in men's T20Is. The match between Czech Republic and Turkey saw the Czech Republic equal the record for the highest innings total in T20Is (278), Turkey bowled out for the lowest total in T20Is (21), and the largest margin of defeat in terms of runs (257).\nIn addition, several qualification events for the 2020 ICC T20 World Cup took place in this season. In the Africa qualifier, both Namibia and Kenya progressed to the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament. Jersey progressed from the Europe qualifier tournament and Singapore progressed from the Asia qualifier tournament. In the final qualifier tournament was the Americas group, which saw Canada and Bermuda progress. Qualification started for the 2023 Cricket World Cup this season, with the Scotland Tri-Nation Series kicking off Cricket World Cup League 2.\nIn July 2019, the ICC suspended Zimbabwe Cricket, for breach of the ICC Constitution, with the team barred from taking part in ICC events. It was the first time that a Full Member of the ICC had been suspended. As a result of Zimbabwe's suspension, the ICC replaced them in the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier with Nigeria and the 2019 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier tournament with Namibia. In addition, the ICC suspended the Croatian Cricket Federation and the Zambia Cricket Union for non-compliance issues, and expelled the Royal Moroccan Cricket Federation as they continued to remain non-compliant with the ICC Membership Criteria.\nWomen's cricket in this season saw the conclusion of qualification for the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup, with many of these events also being part of the 2021 Women's Cricket World Cup qualification process. Regional qualification groups saw teams progress to both the 2019 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier and 2020 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournaments. Zimbabwe initially qualified from the Africa group, before being replaced by Namibia. Papua New Guinea qualified from the EAP group, the United States qualified from the Americas group and the Netherlands qualified from the Europe group. The 2019 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier also took place during the season. Bangladesh and Thailand reached the final of the Qualifier to progress to the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. It was the first time that Thailand had qualified for a Women's T20 World Cup tournament. Bangladesh beat Thailand in the final of the Qualifier to win the tournament.\nThe 2019 Kwibuka Women's T20 Tournament saw several records set. Mali scored four of the five lowest innings totals in WT20Is, the lowest of which was six. In addition, the two highest innings totals in WT20Is was also set this tournament, with Uganda's 314/2 being the highest. In addition, four bilateral series were played, including the 23rd Women's Ashes, which was won by Australia.\nRankings.\nThe following were the rankings at the beginning of the season.\nJuly.\nZimbabwe women in Ireland.\nZimbabwe Women were scheduled to tour Ireland to play three 50-over matches and three WT20Is. However, the tour was cancelled due to funding issues from Zimbabwe Cricket.\nAugust.\nAfghanistan in Zimbabwe.\nIn July 2019, the ICC suspended Zimbabwe Cricket. The country was scheduled to host Afghanistan for a Test match, five ODIs and three T20I fixtures. On 20 August 2019, the Afghan Cricket Board announced the Test and T20I squads for its first fixtures of the 2019–20 season, with no reference to the tour of Zimbabwe.\n2019 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier.\nFinal standings.\n Qualified for the 2020 World Twenty20."

        "text": "William Jackson (8 August 1918 – 26 November 1985) was an Irish basketball and GAA player. Jackson was a member of the 1943 &amp; 1944 Roscommon All-Ireland winning teams. In 1943 they defeated Cavan with Bill \"Stonewall\" Jackson at left full back in a replay by a score of 2-7 - 2-2. Jackson was regarded as one of the soundest corner backs of the era. The following year the Connacht side beat Kerry 1-9 to 2-4 with Jackson lining out at right full back. Kerry were to enact revenge in the 1946 All-Ireland final in a replay.\nThe Castlrea native who played his club football for Tarmon &amp; St. Brigid's, was a member of the Railway Cup winning teams of 1944, 1945 &amp; 1946 as well as having 6 Connacht medals to his name. Jackson also refereed several inter-county clashes including the 1954 All-Ireland minor final between Kerry &amp; Dublin.\nIn March 2000, the Jackson was named at left corner back in the Roscommon GAA Team of the Millennium.\nIrish Olympian.\nThe Sgt. Major also competed for Ireland for Basketball in the men's tournament at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Historian Dr Tom Hunt describes the Irish contingent in his ‘Nuggets of Pure Olympic Gold’ column:\n“Ireland had a team in the 1948 Games which were held in London. This side are one of the hidden pieces of Irish Olympic history. They played five matches and lost all five. It was an all Army team with the exception of Harry Boland, whose uncle of the same name operated alongside Michael Collins in the War of Independence.\n“The most high profile player on the team was Bill Jackson, a legendary Roscommon footballer who won All-Ireland SFC titles in 1943 and 1944.”\n6 Members of the dominant Western Command from Athlone, including Jackson, were on the team. Jackson, who married Maureen McNamara, was joined on the team by brothers Dermot and Paddy Sheriff, who also married McNamara sisters.\nFrom 1941 to 1951, the Western Command won ten of the eleven army championships, losing just once. And in 1947 alone, the Custume Club created a record, winning the All Army championship, the Westmeath championship, the inter-county championship, the All-Ireland championship, the All-Ireland inter provincial championship, and the All Ireland and international blitz championships. And it was that wonderful record which helped secure the strong Athlone representation at the 1948 Olympics.\nIreland competed in a group with Mexico, France, Cuba &amp; Iran and to this day are the only Irish Basketball team to compete at the Olympic Games.\n6th Infantry Battalion.\nJackson continued to play on the Western Command basketball team following the Olympics alongside what was termed “The Family”, which included Dermot Sheriff and Paddy Sheriff as well as non-Olympians Ned Sheehan and Turlough O’Connor who were all brothers-in-law of one another. Jackson also served two foreign expeditions with the Army in the Congo and Cyprus. Jackson retired at the rank of Sergeant Major in 1978 after over 40 years of service and lived the rest of his life in Athlone."

A total of 32 teams competed in the group stage to decide the 16 places in the knockout phase of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 30 August 2018, 18:00 CEST, at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco.\nThe 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles (Regulations Article 13.06):\nOn 17 July 2014, the UEFA emergency panel ruled that Ukrainian and Russian clubs would not be drawn against each other \"until further notice\" due to the political unrest between the countries.\nMoreover, the draw was controlled for teams from the same association in order to split the teams evenly into the two sets of four groups (A–D, E–H) for maximum television coverage. On each matchday, one set of four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other set of four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups alternating between each matchday. The following pairings were announced by UEFA after the group stage teams were confirmed:\nThe fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public, with the following match sequence (Regulations Article 16.02):\n\"Note: Positions for scheduling do not use the seeding pots, e.g. Team 1 is not necessarily the team from Pot 1 in the draw.\"\nThere were scheduling restrictions: for example, teams from the same city (e.g. Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid) in general were not scheduled to play at home on the same matchday (to avoid them playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control), and teams from \"winter countries\" (e.g. Russia) were not scheduled to play at home on the last matchday (due to cold weather).\nTeams.\nBelow were the participating teams (with their 2018 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot.

Zone Bowling has 34 locations across Australia, and three locations across New Zealand.\nHistory.\nOriginally known as AMF Bowling Australia, originating as the Australian part of the bowling division of American Machine and Foundry (AMF). AMF began a joint venture to manufacture pinspotters in Australia in 1959 in view of the growing popularity of ten-pin bowling in the country at the time. By 1964 1,600 bowling lanes existed in Australia, but the popularity of the sport had begun to decline.\nIn 1985 a group of private investors in Richmond, Virginia, United States purchased the bowling division of American Machine and Foundry to form AMF Bowling Companies, Inc. (later known as AMF Bowling Worldwide). The company then bought two major Australian bowling chains to revive interest in bowling. AMF Australia expanded from 16 bowling centres to 30 by 1987, and to over 40 by 2004.\nAMF Bowling Worldwide sold its Australian division of to Macquarie Leisure Trust (later known as Ardent Leisure) in February 2005 as part of AMF's strategy at the time to re-focus on its U.S. bowling business.\nIn December 2017, The Entertainment and Education Group (TEEG) announced that they had purchased Ardent Leisure's bowling and entertainment division for $160 million in order to merge it with its Timezone entertainment business, forming a combined entertainment group encompassing Timezone, AMF, Kingpin and Playtime. All AMF bowling centres in Australia were rebranded as Zone Bowling.\nIn February 2019, TEEG opened its first of many dual branded venues of Zone Bowling and Timezone locations in Westfield Garden City. TEEG now has 15 dual venue locations which offer both Zone Bowling and Timezone."

        "text": "The 2019 United States Open Championship was the 119th U.S. Open, played from at Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, California. It was the seventh major and sixth U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, which last hosted U.S. Opens in 2000 and 2010, won by Tiger Woods and Graeme McDowell, respectively.\nGary Woodland won his first major title by three strokes over world number one Brooks Koepka. Ranked 25th coming into the tournament, and having never finished in the top 20 in the U.S. Open previously, he was generally seen as a surprise victor. Koepka had won four of the last nine majors, and was attempting to become the first player to win three straight U.S. Opens since 1905.\nWoodland shot 68 in the first round, and 65 in the second, to lead by two strokes after 36 holes. He shot 69 in the third round, to have a single-stroke lead over Justin Rose going into the final day. After shooting a 69 in the final round, he converted a 54-hole lead into a victory for the first time in eight attempts in stroke-play events. His 72-hole winning score, a 13-under-par 271, was the lowest relative to par since 2011 and included a stretch of 34 holes without a bogey. Woodland led the field in scrambling, having begun the week ranked 169th in that category.\nThe previous winner of the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, Graeme McDowell, finished tied for 16th with a 3-under-par 281. Tiger Woods was tied 58th after the first round, and began his final round by bogeying four of his first six holes, but rallied on the back nine to finish tied for 21st with a 2-under-par 282. Justin Rose entered the final round one shot back of Woodland but made three bogeys on his final seven holes to finish tied for 3rd. On his 49th birthday, six-time U.S. Open runner-up, Phil Mickelson finished with a 4-over-par 288, having won the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am earlier in the year at Pebble Beach.\n79 players made the cut, including four amateurs. The leading amateur was Norwegian Viktor Hovland, who had qualified by winning the 2018 U.S. Amateur, which was also held at Pebble Beach. He finished tied for 12th at 4-under-par, to become first low amateur at the Masters and U.S. Open in the same season since Matt Kuchar in 1998.\nThe U.S. Open traditionally has a winning score around par, but a joint record 31 players finished under par for the tournament. This was partly attributed by the media to the soft conditions resulting from a marine layer, and relatively low wind speeds for a links-style course.\nVenue.\nCourse layout.\nPebble Beach hosted the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February of the same year. The changes made to the course since that event include reducing par from 72 to 71, cutting the greens from .125\" to .110\", and growing the rough from 2\" to between 3-5\".\nPrevious course lengths for major championships\nField.\nAbout half the field consisted of players who are exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open.

Xander Schauffele eagled the 18th hole to join Rickie Fowler, Louis Oosthuizen and Aaron Wise in a tie for second. Two-time defending champion Brooks Koepka birdied four of his first six holes before falling back to two-under and a tie for 16th. Seventeen eagles were made during the round, a new U.S. Open record.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 14, 2019\"\nGary Woodland holed a 50-foot birdie putt on the 9th hole, the last of his round, to post a bogey-free round of 65 (−6) and take a two-shot lead. His 36-hole score of nine-under ties Gil Morgan in 1992 for lowest in a U.S. Open at Pebble Beach. First-round leader Justin Rose was in second place after a round of 70 (−1). Louis Oosthuizen was tied for the lead but had just one par on his back-nine, making four birdies and four bogeys to finish three shots behind. Rory McIlroy got to within a shot of the lead before a bogey at the 13th and double bogey at the par-5 14th, falling into a tie for fourth place and four behind. Brooks Koepka became the first defending champion since 1988 to begin his title defense with two sub-70 rounds and was part of a group tied for sixth, five behind.\nAmateurs: \"Wu (−2)\", \"Eaton (E)\", \"Hovland (E)\", \"Thorbjornsen (+2)\", Tibbits (+3), Rebula (+4), Eckroat (+5), Yu (+5), Hagestad (+7), Hillier (+7), O'Connell (+8), Parziale (+9), Young (+9), Norton (+13), Bling (+20)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 15, 2019\"\nGary Woodland, the 36-hole leader, was two-under par through 11 holes before finding trouble on the par-3 12th, hitting his tee shot into the rough. Still, off the green after his second shot, he made a 33-foot chip shot to save par. At the par-5 14th, his fourth shot almost rolled back down off the green but managed to stop just short. He then made a 42-foot putt to save par yet again. He parred the last four holes to shoot 69 (−2) and take a one-shot lead into the final round. Justin Rose got up-and-down from a greenside bunker for birdie at the par-5 18th to get to 10-under, a shot behind Woodland.\nLouis Oosthuizen birdied three holes in a row from the 15th to the 17th to get into a tie for third with Chez Reavie and two-time defending champion Brooks Koepka, four shots behind. Koepka didn't make a bogey in a round of 68 (−3).\nAmateurs: Wu (−2), Hovland (E), Eaton (+2), Thorbjornsen (+15)\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 16, 2019\"\nSummary.\nGary Woodland, who came into the final round with a one-shot lead, birdied two of his first three holes and, despite a bogey at the 9th, still led by two making the turn. Brooks Koepka was four-under through five holes but failed to birdie the par-5 6th from a greenside bunker and missed a six-foot putt for birdie at the 7th to trail by two going to the back-nine. At the par-5 14th hole, Woodland went for the green from 264 yards out, his 3-wood just clearing the bunker in front of the green and settling on the hill to the left of the green where he was able to make birdie. Koepka, meanwhile, failed to birdie the same hole after driving into the rough and hitting his third shot onto the same hill.\nStill leading by two heading to the par-3 17th, Woodland's tee shot finished on the fringe, 90 feet away from the hole. Forced to chip because of the mound dividing the green, he got his second shot to within 3 feet to save par. Koepka's approach at the par-5 18th went over the green where he failed to get up-and-down for birdie, missing a 9-foot putt to finish at 10-under. Now needing only a bogey at the last to win, Woodland hit an iron off the tee and laid up with his second shot. His third found the green 30 feet to the right of the flag, and he made the putt to shoot a final-round 69 (−2) and finish three shots ahead of Koepka at 13-under.\nJustin Rose, one back at the start of the round, played his final 11 holes in 4-over and fell back to a tie for third place with Jon Rahm, Chez Reavie, and Xander Schauffele. Amateur Viktor Hovland finished at 4-under 280, breaking Jack Nicklaus's record for lowest score by an amateur in the U.S. Open; he finished tied for 12th, which was the best by an amateur since Jim Simons tied for 5th in 1971.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;\nMedia.\nThis was the fifth U.S. Open televised by Fox and FS1. During Fox's primetime window in the first round, FS1 offered coverage hosted by Justin Kutcher following the group of Justin Rose, Jordan Spieth and Tiger Woods, and the group of Viktor Hovland, 2018 champion Brooks Koepka, and Francesco Molinari. Due to commitments to baseball and the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, there were no plans for similar coverage on FS1 during the remainder of the tournament."

The Ebbw Fawr river flows through Glyncoed in the eastern half of the community.\nThe boundaries of the Badminton community are coterminous with the electoral ward of the same name. According to the 2011 census the population of the Badminton ward was 3,110 (with 556 under the age of 18).\nBadminton has only one listed building in the area, namely Church House, a mid 19th-century two storey building which was probably contemporary to the (now demolished) St John's Church.\nThe Aneurin Bevan Memorial Stones are within the community boundaries (in the Beaufort electoral ward). Three smaller stones (representing the three towns of his constituency, Ebbw Vale, Rhymney and Tredegar) surround a larger stone representing Bevan.\nGovernance.\nBadminton is in the Blaenau Gwent parliamentary constituency for elections to the UK parliament and a constituency of the same name for elections to the Welsh Assembly government.\nThe Badminton ward elects two county councillors to Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council. At the May 2017 elections the ward elected two Independent councillors, Clive Meredith and Gregory Paulsen.

The\nHistory.\nThe National Sports Council organised the Prime Minister Cup in 2017 due to the suspension of the Cricket Association of Nepal by the International Cricket Council. A domestic one-day cricket tournament had not been held in the country for three years due to conflicts within the board which eventually led to its suspension. It replaced the National League Cricket as the premier domestic cricket tournament in Nepal, alongside the Manmohan Memorial National One-Day Cup.\nCompetition format.\nThe inaugural edition had eight teams, five regional teams and three departmental teams, competing in two round-robin groups with the top two teams from each group advancing to the semi-finals. All matches were played in the one-day format. The following season the five regional teams were replaced by teams representing the seven provinces, taking the number of teams to ten. The format remained unchained until the 2022 season.\nThe format is to be changed for the 2024 season, with the ten teams competing in a round-robin format and the top four teams qualifying for the play-offs and Men's Elite Trophy which will be played in multi day format.\nTeams.\nThe following ten teams currently participate in the Prime Minister One Day Cup.\nDefunct teams.\nThe following teams also appeared in the Prime Minister One Day Cup.\nTournament season and results.\nOut of the ten teams that have played in the Prime Minister One Day Cup.Armed Police Force Club won their maiden title.

        "text": "The 2030 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXVI Olympic Winter Games, is an upcoming international multi-sport event scheduled to take place in February 2030. The host city will be elected at the 142nd IOC Session in Paris on 23 July 2024, the eve of the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nBidding process.\nThe new IOC bidding process was approved at the 134th IOC Session on 24 June 2019 in Lausanne, Switzerland. The key proposals, driven by the relevant recommendations from Olympic Agenda 2020, are:\nThe IOC also modified the Olympic Charter to increase its flexibility in choosing hosts by making the date of elections more flexible and allowing multiple cities, regions, or countries to host instead of only single cities, regions or countries.\nFuture host winter commissions.\nThe full composition of the winter commissions, which oversee interested hosts or engage with potential hosts with which the IOC may want to create interest, is as follows:\nDialogue stages.\nAccording to the Future Host Commission's rules of conduct, the new IOC bidding system is divided into 2 dialogue stages:\nContinuous dialogue.\n\"Non-committal discussions between the IOC and interested parties (City/Region/Country/NOC interested in hosting) with regard to hosting future Olympic events.\"\nDuring the Olympic Summit on 9 December 2022 the IOC informed to remain in \"Continuous Dialogue\" with several well-developed projects by parties that have expressed interest in the Olympic Winter Games 2030 and with whom intense collaboration is ongoing. The Summit was also informed that the commission is looking into challenges and opportunities facing future Olympic Winter Games, such as the impact of climate change. A number of proposals which could have an impact on future elections were discussed, including rotation of the Games within a certain pool of hosts, minimum climate conditions and existing infrastructure criteria.\nUpon the request of the commission, the IOC Executive Board decided to give the Commission more time to study all these factors to make the best possible decisions about future hosting, including a revised 2030 election timeframe.\nTargeted dialogue.\n\"Targeted discussions with one or more interested parties (called preferred host(s)), as instructed by the IOC Executive Board. This follows a recommendation by the Future Host Commission as a result of continuous dialogue.\"\nFollowing a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)'s Future Host Commission for the Olympic Winter Games, the IOC Executive Board (EB) on 29 November 2023 invited the French National Olympic Committee (CNOSF) into \"Targeted Dialogue\" towards hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games 2030 in the French Alps.\nBidding parties.\nThe three first potential submitting bidding parties were revealed by Octavian Morariu, the chair of the Future Host Winter Commission, during the 135th IOC Session at the SwissTech Convention Centre in Lausanne, Switzerland in January 2020. He mentioned Salt Lake City of the United States, Sapporo of Japan and a joint bid from the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Zaragoza at the Pyrenees region have conducted feasibility studies. In 2022, Spain withdrew their bid. Vancouver, Canada, made a preliminary bid submission in February 2021, but withdrew in October 2022.\nMedia reported on 29 June 2023 that five countries have officially declared interest in hosting a future edition of the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games and that a sixth has expressed interest but has yet to enter into ‘continuous dialogue’. IOC Executive Director Christophe Dubi also confirmed the countries are:\nStakeholders.\nStakeholders are those cities or regions that have expressed potential interest in hosting the Games. To date, seven National Olympic Committees have expressed interest, though Spain, Canada and Japan later withdrew. The remaining four interested sites are as follows:\nDevelopments.\nA decision on the 2030 Winter Olympics host city has been delayed until 23 July 2024, to allow the IOC more time to carefully plan the future of the Winter Olympics. Due to impacts from climate change and another economic factors, the IOC is now studying a number of changes to future games, such as rotating host cities, limiting the games to existing or temporary venues, and establishing minimum average temperature requirements. It also considered awarding the 2030 and 2034 winter games simultaneously at the next IOC session, but IOC President Thomas Bach has ruled out that possibility because \"it would not be the right thing to do.\" However, at the 141st IOC Session in Mumbai, where these games were originally set to be awarded, the IOC approved to award both the 2030 and 2034 Winter Olympics at the 142nd IOC Session in Paris on the eve of the 2024 Summer Olympics."

        "text": "The 2019 World Snooker Championship (officially the 2019 Betfred World Snooker Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 20 April to 6 May 2019 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. It was the 43rd consecutive year the World Snooker Championship had been held at the Crucible, and the 20th and final ranking event of the 2018–19 snooker season. Qualifying for the tournament took place from 10 to 17 April 2019 at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield. Sports betting company Betfred sponsored the event.\nThe winner of the title was Judd Trump, who defeated John Higgins 18–9 in the final to claim his first World Championship. In doing so, Trump became the 11th player to win all three Triple Crown titles at least once. Defending champion Mark Williams lost 9–13 to David Gilbert in the second round of the tournament. For the first time in the history of the World Snooker Championship, an amateur player appeared at the main stage of the event—debutant James Cahill defeated world number one Ronnie O'Sullivan in the first round, before being narrowly defeated by Stephen Maguire in a second round deciding .\nThe tournament featured 100 century breaks; at the time, this was the highest number recorded at an official snooker event (superseded at the 2021 World Championship). The final match alone included 11 centuries, the most ever scored in the final of a ranking event. Higgins compiled the highest break, a 143, in his semi-final win over Gilbert. Shaun Murphy defeated Luo Honghao in the first round 10–0, the first whitewash at the World Championship since 1992.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the sport was popular in the British Isles. However, in the modern era it has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nThe championship features 32 professional and qualified amateur players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single elimination format, each played over several . The 32 competitors in the main tournament are selected using a combination of the top players in the world snooker rankings and a pre-tournament qualification stage. Joe Davis won the first World Championship in 1927, the final match being held in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held in the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England.\n, Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O’Sullivan are the event's most successful participants in the modern era, having both won the championship seven times. The 2018 World Championship had been won by Welsh professional player Mark Williams, who defeated Scotland's John Higgins 18–16 in the final. This was Williams' third world title, having won the championship in 2000 and 2003. The winner of the 2019 tournament earned prize money of £500,000, from a total pool of £2,231,000. The title sponsor of the event was sports betting company Betfred, who had sponsored the World Snooker Championship every year since 2015 (having previously sponsored the event from 2009 to 2012).\nFormat.\nThe 2019 World Snooker Championship took place between 20 April and 6May 2019 in Sheffield, England. The tournament was the last of twenty ranking events in the 2018/2019 season on the World Snooker Tour. It featured a 32-player main draw that was held at the Crucible Theatre, as well as a 128-player qualifying draw that was played at the English Institute of Sport from 10 to 17 April 2019, finishing three days before the start of the main draw. This was the 43rd consecutive year the tournament was held at the Crucible, and the 51st consecutive year the championship was contested using the modern knockout format.\nThe top 16 players in the latest world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. Defending champion Mark Williams was automatically seeded first overall. The remaining 15 seeds were allocated based on the latest world rankings, which were released after the China Open, the penultimate event of the season. Matches in the first round of the main draw were played as the best of 19 frames. The number of frames required to win a match increased progressively with each successive round, leading up to the final match which was played as the best of 35 frames.\nAll 16 non-seeded spots in the main draw were filled with players who had advanced through the qualifying rounds. There were 128 players in the qualifying draw, which comprised 106 of the remaining 112 players on the World Snooker Tour, as well as 22 wildcard places allotted to non-tour players. These invited players included the women's world champion and the European junior champion. As with the main draw, half of the participants in the qualifying draw were seeded players; those ranked from 17th to 80th in the world rankings were allocated one of 64 seeds in order of their ranking, while the other competitors were placed randomly into the draw. To reach the main draw at the Crucible, players needed to win three best-of-19-frames qualifying matches.\nParticipant summary.\nEight former world champions participated in the main tournament at the Crucible. They were Ronnie O'Sullivan (five titles: 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2013), John Higgins (four titles: 1998, 2007, 2009, 2011), Mark Williams (defending champion, three titles: 2001, 2003, 2018), Mark Selby (three titles: 2014, 2016, 2017), Shaun Murphy (one title: 2005), Graeme Dott (one title: 2006), Neil Robertson (one title: 2010), and Stuart Bingham (one title: 2015). This was O'Sullivan's 27th consecutive appearance in the final stages of the World Championship since his debut in 1993, equalling Stephen Hendry's record for consecutive appearances, and three short of Steve Davis's overall record of 30 appearances. Four other former World Championship finalists also competed: Ali Carter (twice: 2008 and 2012), Judd Trump (once: 2011), Barry Hawkins (once: 2013), and Ding Junhui (once: 2016). The youngest player to participate in the main stage of the tournament was Luo Honghao at 19 years of age, while 46-year-old Mark Davis was the oldest; both players entered the main draw through qualifying.\nThree former world champions participated in the qualifying rounds: Ken Doherty (1997), Peter Ebdon (2002) and Graeme Dott (2006). Of these, only Dott succeeded in qualifying for the main tournament at the Crucible. Also, four former World Championship finalists participated in the qualifying rounds: Jimmy White (six times: 1984 and 1990–1994), Nigel Bond (once: 1995), Matthew Stevens (twice: 2000 and 2005), and Ali Carter (twice: 2008 and 2012). Of these, only Carter qualified for the main tournament at the Crucible.\nPrize fund.\nThe total purse for the event was greater than for any prior snooker tournament. For the first time the total prize pool was over £2 million, with the winner being awarded £500,000. The breakdown of prize money was:\nThe prize for a maximum break in the main stage was £50,000.\nTournament summary.\nQualifying rounds.\nThe top 16 seeds automatically qualified for the competition's main draw. The defending champion Mark Williams was seeded first, whilst other seeds were allocated based on the world rankings following the China Open. The remaining players competed in the preliminary qualifying rounds, and were required to win three best-of-19-frames matches to reach the main stage of the championship.\nThe qualifying rounds took place at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield between 10 and 17 April 2019, with 16 players progressing to the main stage at the Crucible Theatre. A total of 128 players competed in the qualifying stage, including those tour players not automatically qualified for the main draw, as well as invited amateurs.\nJames Cahill became the first amateur player ever to qualify for the Crucible main stage of the World Championship, defeating fellow amateur Michael Judge 10–6 in the third qualifying round. Seven players—the largest number since 1999—advanced through the qualifying rounds to make their debuts at the main stage of the tournament. Besides Cahill, they were Scott Donaldson, Michael Georgiou (The first ever Cypriot to play at the crucible), Li Hang, Luo Honghao, Tian Pengfei and Zhao Xintong. The 2006 World Champion Graeme Dott and two-time finalist Ali Carter also qualified. Marco Fu failed to reach the main draw of the competition for the first time since 2004.\nFirst round.\nThe draw for the first round of the championship was made on 18 April 2019, the day after the conclusion of the qualifying rounds and two days before the start of the main event. The matches were drawn by World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn and 1991 World Champion John Parrott. The first round of the championship took place between 20 and 25 April 2019. All first round matches were played over two sessions as best-of-19 frames.\nTop half.\nThe tournament began with defending champion Mark Williams (seeded one) drawing qualifier Martin Gould. Both sessions of this first match were played on the opening day of the event. Gould won the first frame with a break of 64, before Williams took the next five with breaks of 55, 54 and 129, to lead 5–1.&lt;ref name=\"Williams/Gould1\" &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gould won frames seven and eight, but Williams took the session's final frame with a break of 97 to lead 6–3.&lt;ref name=\"Williams/GouldBBC\" &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Williams opened up a lead in frame ten, before Gould made a to force a . However, Williams potted the black to go ahead 7–3.&lt;ref name=\"Williams/Gould2\" &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gould then won frame 11, but Williams claimed the next two frames to open up a five-frame lead, at 9–4. Despite Gould responding with breaks of 70, 87 and 76, to reduce his deficit to 7–9, Williams clinched the 17th frame to win the match 10–7. After his victory, Williams complained that World Snooker had not allowed his 12-year-old son backstage before the match, which the governing body denied.\nEvent debutant Luo Honghao was drawn against 13th seed Shaun Murphy. Finishing 10–0 to Murphy, the match was a whitewash, only the second ever to be witnessed at the Crucible (the first being John Parrott's defeat of Eddie Charlton in the first round of the 1992 championship). Luo accumulated just 89 points during the entire match, the lowest number of points ever scored in a World Championship match, and more than 100 fewer than the previous record low of 191 scored by Danny Fowler when he lost 1–10 to Stephen Hendry in the 1993 championship. Fourth seed Neil Robertson met qualifier, Michael Georgiou, in the first round. At the conclusion of the initial session, Georgiou was 0–9 behind, having scored even fewer points than Luo in the first nine frames of the match. However, he won frame ten on the resumption of play in the second session, with a break of 90, thus avoiding both the whitewash and the lowest points total. Robertson later won the match 10–1 to progress to the second round.\nFifth seed John Higgins played qualifier Mark Davis, who had won six of the pair's last seven encounters.&lt;ref name=\"Higgins/Davis1\" &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins took a 6–3 lead after the first session, but then spent the night in Royal Hallamshire Hospital because his brother Jason had fallen down some stairs at the venue and fractured his kneecap. Higgins won the match 10–7 the following day.&lt;ref name=\"Higgins/Davis2\" &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nTwo former world champions, 12th seed Stuart Bingham (2015 winner) and qualifier Graeme Dott (2006 winner), met in the first round of the competition. Bingham led 8–1 after the first session, and later 9–4, before Dott won five frames to level the match at 9–9. Bingham won the deciding frame after Dott missed a simple shot on the .&lt;ref name=\"dott/bingham\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Dott explained that \"serious sleeping problems\" had caused him difficulties while playing.\nBottom half.\nThe first round match between 14th seed Luca Brecel and qualifier Gary Wilson, which featured a large amount of tactical play, was suspended when the afternoon session overran, with Wilson leading 9–8. On resuming that evening, Brecel won frame 18 to send the match to a deciding frame. After first requiring a re-rack, this frame lasted for 79 minutes and 31 seconds, setting the record for the longest frame ever played at the Crucible (breaking the previous record set in 2016 by Mark Selby and Marco Fu by more than three minutes) which Wilson won.&lt;ref name=\"Brecel/Wilson\" &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tenth seed Ding Junhui played qualifier Anthony McGill. After leading 6–3 overnight, Ding won the match 10–7 to progress to the second round.\nHaving lost eight of his previous 15 first round matches at the Crucible, 15th seed Stephen Maguire played event debutant Tian Pengfei. In frame 17, Maguire was 7–9 down and needed a on the colours to stay in the match. He snookered Tian on the , but then missed a difficult shot to a corner; however, on rebounding from the pocket, the blue hit the and went into the other baulk pocket. Maguire later described this fluke as \"just outrageous\" and admitted he \"got lucky\". He added and black to steal the frame, and then took the next two frames to win the match 10–9. Three-time former world champion and third seed, Mark Selby, played debutant Zhao Xintong. Despite trailing 1–5 after the first six frames, Selby won nine of the next eleven frames, with two breaks of 131, to win 10–7.\nAmateur player James Cahill drew the world number one Ronnie O'Sullivan, who had reached the finals of the other Triple Crown events earlier in the season. Cahill finished the first session with a 5–4 lead, and then went ahead 8–5 in the second session before O'Sullivan levelled the match at 8–8.&lt;ref name=\"Cahill/O'Sullivan\" &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cahill missed a straightforward shot on a after compiling an early break in frame 17; however, despite needing only the final pink and black to win, O'Sullivan missed the pink, allowing Cahill to clinch the frame. With a break of 56 in the next frame, Cahill won the match 10–8 to secure a place in the second round. This was Cahill's second win over the top-ranked player in the season, having defeated Mark Selby in the first round of the UK Championship five months earlier. Afterwards, O'Sullivan indicated that he had been unwell during the match, but former world champion Ken Doherty accused him of \"playing too casually\".\nSecond round.\nThe last 16 players in the competition took part in the second round, which was played between 25 and 29 April, with matches completed over three sessions as best of 25 frames. Fourth seed Neil Robertson played 13th seed Shaun Murphy. The first session of the match featured a maximum break attempt by Murphy; with just two red balls remaining, he asked for the screen between the tables to be lifted, allowing the spectators in the other half of the auditorium to watch his attempt at a maximum, but he failed to finish it. Prior to this dramatic turn of events, Robertson had won the first three frames of the match, without Murphy attempting a pot. Robertson led 5–3 after the first session and 10–6 after the second. He later won the first three frames of the final session to win the match 13–6.&lt;ref name=\"murphy/robertson\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Post-match, Murphy called Robertson \"just too good\" and \"unplayable\".\nDefending champion Mark Williams played 16th seed David Gilbert. After the first session, with Gilbert leading 5–3, Williams said he had been feeling chest pains during play. He was taken to Northern General Hospital overnight but returned the following morning for the second session of the match. He later tied the match 7–7, but was trailing again 7–9 after the second session. Gilbert then won the first four frames of the final session to win the match 13–9.\nAmateur player James Cahill drew 15th seed Stephen Maguire. After the first two sessions, Maguire was ahead 5–3 and 9–7, but Cahill then took three of the first four frames in the third session to level the match at 10–10. He also won frame 21, to take the lead for the first time in the match, but Maguire drew level in the following frame.&lt;ref name=\"Maguire/Cahill\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Both players missed shots in frame 23, with Cahill looking to win the frame before being penalised for a , and later going from a , allowing Maguire to pull ahead again 12–11. Cahill won frame 24, after Maguire missed a by a wide margin, taking the match to a deciding frame. Maguire won the decider, and the match, 13–12.\nThree-time world champion Mark Selby played qualifier Gary Wilson. Despite trailing 3–5 after the first session, Selby won four of the first five frames in the second session to lead 7–6; however, Wilson took the last three frames of the session to lead 9–7. Selby later tied the match at 10–10, before Wilson won three consecutive frames to secure a place in the quarter-finals. Two former world champions, fifth seed John Higgins and 12th seed Stuart Bingham, met in the second round. Bingham took an early 4–1 lead, but Higgins won the remaining frames of the first session, with a 132 break in the eighth, to level at 4–4. The second session was even, with no more than two frames separating the players, and the match was tied again at 8–8 and 11–11. In frame 23, Bingham missed a on two reds, allowing Higgins to claim the next two frames and the match, 13–11. Bingham described the close-fought encounter as a \"good battle\" and Higgins admitted he was \"over the moon\" to have won.&lt;ref name=\"Higgins/Bingham\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nNinth seed and 2013 runner-up, Barry Hawkins, played eighth seed Kyren Wilson. This match included nine century breaks, setting a new record for the second round of the championships. Hawkins made four century breaks of 105, 130, 136, and 137 during the first session, including a maximum break attempt; Wilson also compiled a century in frame five. With four frames in a row ending with a 100+ break, this was the first time since the 1999 semi-final between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Stephen Hendry that four centuries had been compiled in consecutive frames in a World Championship match. After winning the first four frames of the match, Hawkins ended the first session with a 6–2 lead. Wilson won the second session of the match 5–3, to trail 7–9, before twice drawing level at 9–9 and 10–10 in the final session. Despite Hawkins pulling ahead, at 10–9 and 11–10, Wilson won the last three frames of the match to progress to the next round, 13–11.&lt;ref name=\"Carter/Zhou\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nZhou Yuelong played Ali Carter in the only all-qualifier encounter of the second round. Zhou took four of the first five frames to lead 4–1, then led 5–3 after the first session, and held the lead at 9–7 after the second. On resuming the match in the final session, Carter won six straight frames to progress 13–9. Two former world finalists, Judd Trump and Ding Junhui, met in the second round. Trump took an early 5–1 lead in the first session, but Ding won eight of the next ten frames to lead 9–7 before the final session. Trump then took six frames in a row, including breaks of 93, 79, 54 and 103, to win the match 13–9.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals took place on 30 April and 1May, and like the previous round, matches were played as best of 25 frames across three sessions. Ali Carter played Gary Wilson in an all-qualifier match. Despite this being his first World Championship quarter-final, and after losing the first three frames of the match, Wilson won five straight frames to lead 5–3 after the first session. The pair shared the second session, with both players winning four frames, bringing the score to 9–7 ahead of the final session. Carter won two of the next three frames, including a break of 128, to trail 9–10, before Wilson won the next three to progress 13–9. Post-match, Carter said, \"You have to take your hat off to [Wilson]. I did not think he could play that good,\" noting that despite Wilson's low ranking of 32 \"[he] has to be the favourite to win it now, the way he has been playing.\"\nThe 2019 Masters champion, Judd Trump, played 15th seed Stephen Maguire. Having won six straight frames to conclude his second-round match against Ding Junhui, Trump won another six consecutive frames at the start of this match, scoring breaks of 131, 67, 106, 78 and 101, to lead 7–1 after the first session. He looked set to win the match in the second session without needing to play the third, extending his lead to 9–1. However, Maguire won four of the remaining frames, to trail 5–11 by the end of the session. Trump won the match 13–6, after just three frames of the final session. Maguire was fined £250 for swearing in a post-match press conference when he was asked to summarise his performance in the match.\nEighth seed Kyren Wilson played 16th seed David Gilbert. The pair had met earlier in the season, in the final of the 2019 German Masters, where Wilson had won the tournament 9–7. The two players shared the opening session of their quarter-final, 4–4; Gilbert then won six of the eight frames in the second session to lead 10–6 overnight. Wilson won two of the first three frames of the final session to trail 8–11, but Gilbert took the next two frames to win the match 13–8.\nFour-time world champion John Higgins played fourth seed Neil Robertson in the last of the quarter-finals. Robertson took an early 3–1 lead, but Higgins tied the match at 4–4. Robertson pulled away to 7–4 at the start of the second session, before Higgins won five frames in a row to take a 9–7 lead. After sharing the first six frames of the final session, Higgins won the match 13–10, with a century break of 101 in the next frame, to progress to the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nThe two semi-finals were played from 2to 5May, with the matches spread over four sessions as best of 33 frames. The first semi-final pitted four-time champion John Higgins against David Gilbert, who had never previously progressed past the second round of the championships. Higgins won the first two frames, but Gilbert tied the match at 2–2, with the help of a 94 break. Higgins then took a 3–2 lead, before Gilbert claimed the last three frames of the session, including a maximum break attempt, potting 15 red balls but failing a on the , to lead 5–3.\nGilbert won the first three frames of the second session, including a 125 break, to increase his lead to 8–3. He was ahead 56–17 in frame 12 but missed a pink into a , allowing Higgins to clear the table and clinch the frame. Higgins also won the next two frames, compiling breaks of 67, 52 and 58, to trail 6–8; however, Gilbert took the final two frames of the session to lead 10–6. Pundit John Virgo reflected that Higgins was \"not with it\", whilst six-time champion Steve Davis called Higgins' performance \"ridiculous\".\nWhen the match resumed for the third session, a crowd member was ejected from the auditorium for shouting out immediately after the shot in the initial frame; Gilbert took the frame, increasing his lead to 11–6. Higgins won two of the next three frames to stay four behind at 8–12. He then compiled a 143 break, the highest of the tournament, in frame 21; this was also the 86th century break of the championship so far, tying the record for the number of centuries in a World Snooker Championship, set in 2015.&lt;ref name=\"guardian Gilbert/Higgins\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert won the next frame, falling short of a century, with a break of 91. Higgins then won the final two frames of the session to reduce his deficit to 11–13.\nGilbert took the initial frame of the fourth (and final) session, but Higgins, having not led the match since mid-way through the first session, won the next four frames to go ahead 15–14. Gilbert then restored his lead by winning the next two frames, before Higgins scored a 139 break to level the score at 16–16, forcing a decider. Higgins won the final frame and the match after Gilbert missed the black ball from the spot. Both players gave emotional press conferences afterward, with Gilbert commenting, \"I have never won anything, I have come close but this is the best couple of weeks I have had in my snooker career by a mile. It might be the closest I will come to winning the World Championship.\" Higgins apologized for his poor play during the match, and for bringing Gilbert \"down to [his] level\" in the first three sessions.\nJudd Trump faced qualifier, Gary Wilson, in the second semi-final. They shared the opening session, 4–4, but Wilson later took a 6–5 lead with a break of 65. Trump won the next three frames with breaks of 73, 123 and 75, to lead 9–6, before Wilson compiled a 77 break, bringing the score to 9–7 after the first two sessions. Wilson won frame 17 with a break of 50; however, Trump took the next three frames, including a break of 114, which was the 87th century of the tournament (overtaking the previous all-time record of centuries compiled at any World Snooker Championship). Trump was 14–10 ahead at the end of the third session.\nWilson won the first frame of the final session, but Trump claimed the next three to win the match 17–11. Afterwards, Trump suggested that neither he nor Higgins had played particularly well in their respective semi-final matches, despite their both reaching the final. Wilson, ranked 30 in the world, said Judd deserved to win, but he commented on the poor playing conditions, saying: \"I wasn't good enough... but I've got to say that table is disgusting. It's running off all over the place, you're getting square bounces, kicks every other shot.\"\nFinal.\nThe final was played over four sessions on 5and 6May, as a best-of-35-frames match. It was a repeat of the 2011 World Championship final between John Higgins and Judd Trump, when Higgins won the match 18–15 to claim his fourth world title. To reach the 2019 final, Higgins had defeated Mark Davis, Stuart Bingham, Neil Robertson and David Gilbert, while Trump had defeated Thepchaiya Un-Nooh, Ding Junhui, Stephen Maguire and Gary Wilson. This was Higgins' third consecutive World Championship final (having been defeated by Mark Selby in 2017 and Mark Williams in 2018), and his eighth overall. Higgins had previously won the World Snooker Championship four times (in 1998, 2007, 2009 and 2011). This was Trump's second world final, his first being the 2011 loss to Higgins.\nTrump won the first two frames of the opening session, with breaks of 51 and 63. Higgins replied with a break of 139 to trail 1–2, before Trump scored a century of his own, a 105, to take a two-frame lead at the first mid-session interval. Breaks of 69, 34, 40 and 101 allowed Higgins to accumulate 244 unanswered points, claiming three consecutive frames to lead 4–3. Trump then tied the match at 4–4 by compiling the fourth century of the session.\nAt the beginning of the nine-frame evening session, Higgins compiled a break of 125, the third consecutive century of the match, to move ahead 5–4. Trump won the remaining eight frames of the session, including breaks of 135 and 114, to lead by seven frames overnight, 12–5. Steve Davis commented on the session: \"I've seen some astonishing snooker here, a lot of it from Ronnie O'Sullivan, but that was a different type of astonishing. I am a little bit in shock. He is making a lot of very difficult shots seem very easy.\"\nThe third session opened with an attempt at a maximum break from Higgins, who potted 14 reds and 14 blacks before running out of position for the final red; he played a full-table double to pot the red ball, but then missed the following black. He also won frame 19, to trail 7–12, but Trump took the next three to extend his lead to 15–7. Higgins won the next two frames, which prevented the match from concluding with a session to spare. Trump attempted a maximum break of his own in frame 25, but he a red into the middle pocket. Going into the evening session with a 16–9 lead, Trump won two straight frames to win the match 18–9 and claim the 2019 world title. This was the largest margin of victory in a World Championship final since 2009, when Higgins defeated Shaun Murphy by the same scoreline.\nWith eleven centuries between the two players, the final set the record for the most 100+ breaks in a single match, one more than the previous record held by Alan McManus and Ding Junhui in the semi-final of the 2016 World Championship. After the final, Higgins praised Trump's performance saying, \"I was the lucky one to not have to pay for a ticket, he was just awesome.\" BBC pundit Steve Davis commented, \"The standard in that final may have been the greatest we have ever seen and Judd Trump was at the heart of it.\" This was Trump's second Triple Crown title of the season after winning the Masters in January.\nMain draw.\nNumbers given in brackets after players' names show the seedings for the top 16 players in the competition. The sole amateur player in the championship is indicated with (a).\nQualifying.\nQualifying for the 2019 World Snooker Championship took place from 10 to 17 April 2019 at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield, using a 12-table set-up. Starting with a pool of 128 players, the qualifying competition consisted of three knock-out rounds, with all matches played over two sessions as best of 19 frames. The 16 winners of the third round matches progressed to the main stages of the tournament at the Crucible Theatre.\nThe tour players (ranked outside the top-16) were joined by wildcard amateur players who achieved success through the WPBSA qualifying criteria:\nPlayers ranked 17 to 80 in the 2018/2019 world rankings were seeded 1to 64 in qualifying. The remaining tour players plus the invited amateurs were drawn randomly.\nThere were 64 matches in the first round of qualifying. Each match was played between a seeded and a non-seeded player. Numbers given in brackets after players' names (in left-hand columns below) show the seedings (1 to 64) for the players ranked 17 to 80 in the 2018/2019 world rankings.\nWinners of the third round qualifying matches advanced to the main draw.\nCentury breaks.\nMain stage centuries.\nThe main stage of the 2019 World Snooker Championship yielded 100 centuries, made by 23 players. The highest break of the tournament, a 143, was compiled by John Higgins in his semi-final match with David Gilbert.\nThe championship broke a number of records in terms of century breaks, including the total number compiled in the main stage of a snooker tournament: there were 14 more centuries than the 86 recorded in both the 2015 and the 2016 championships. The final featured 11 century breaks, the highest number ever compiled in a single match, one more than the ten centuries in the 2016 semi-final between Ding Junhui and Allan McManus. Judd Trump equalled Ding's record of seven centuries made by one player in a world championship match.\nQualifying stage centuries.\nA total of 122 century breaks were made by 57 players during the qualifying stage of the World Championship.\nCoverage.\nThe 2019 World Snooker Championship was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by BBC Television and BBC Online, as well as on Eurosport. Internationally, the event was broadcast by DAZN in Canada and the United States, by SKY in New Zealand, and by Now TV in Hong Kong.\nWorld Snooker live streamed the event internationally on Facebook, doing so for the second time. Coverage of the qualifying rounds was also live streamed on Facebook, Eurosport Player and selected betting sites.\nIn Scotland, the BBC was criticised for showing the World Championship on BBC Scotland, rather than a speech by Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon on Scottish independence. The BBC defended the decision, explaining that the speech had been broadcast live on its BBC Scotland news website."

The franchises included are those of high-caliber independent teams prior to the organization of formal league play in 1920 and concludes with the dissolution of the remnant of the last major Negro league team, the Kansas City Monarchs then based out of Grand Rapids, Michigan, in about 1966. (The Indianapolis Clowns continued on through about 1988, but they had morphed into an entertainment act much as the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team of today.) All teams who played a season while a member of a major Negro league are included. The major leagues are the original Negro National League, the Eastern Colored League, the American Negro League, the East–West League, the second Negro National League and the Negro American League. Teams from the 1932 original Negro Southern League are also included which allows for the inclusion of the few high caliber minor Negro league teams.\nGraphical timeline of Negro league teams.\nThe two thick gray lines represent trying times: the first is the Panic of 1893 and the second is the Great Depression in 1933. Both crisis led to financial ruin and collapse of most teams and leagues. The two thick black lines represent the formation of organized league play in 1920 and the integration of Major League Baseball in 1946. After integration, the level of play deteriorated rapidly and dramatically. By 1950 all teams were considered to be of minor league status."

He is the current head coach of the Seattle Seawolves of Major League Rugby (MLR).\nHe is the former head coach of Welsh professional side the Ospreys in the Pro14, having previously been the team's forwards coach.\nPlaying career.\nDuring his playing career, Clarke was a hooker. He was capped at international level by , playing for the senior team eight times from 1995 to 1998. Clarke spent the much of his professional playing career with his native province of Ulster and played in the 1999 Heineken Cup Final victory against Colomiers, the first ever European title for an Irish side. He also spent several seasons with Northampton Saints in England across two spells, having studied at the university in the town and later worked as a teacher there. Clarke was forced to retire due to injury in 2001.\nCoaching.\nAfter his retirement from playing Clarke became a part of the Ulster coaching system, helping to establish the province's academy system. He was promoted to assistant coach under his former teammate Mark McCall, and served in this role during Ulster's 2005–06 Celtic League title-winning season. Following this success Clarke was hired by the IRFU as an Elite Player Development Manager, a newly created role with the directive of developing young Irish players. He also served as head coach of the Irish under-20 team and the Irish 'A' side during his time with the union.\nFollowing five years in his role with the IRFU, Clarke returned to Ulster in 2012 as an assistant under Mark Anscombe.

For this purpose, Adriatic League worked as only one country. For the draw, the teams were seeded into six pots, in accordance with the Club Ranking, based on their performance in European competitions during a three-year period and the lowest possible position that any club from that league can occupy in the draw is calculated by adding the results of the worst performing team from each league.\nThe fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public, with the following match sequence:\n\"Note: Positions for scheduling do not use the seeding pots, e.g., Team 1 is not necessarily the team from Pot 1 in the draw.\"\nThere were scheduling restrictions: for example, teams from the same city in general are not scheduled to play at home on the same round (to avoid them playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control).\nRegular season.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners, runners-up, third-placed teams and fourth-placed teams advanced to the Top 16, while the fifth-placed teams and sixth-placed teams were eliminated. The rounds were 2–3 October, 9–10 October, 16–17 October, 23–24 October, 30–31 October, 6–7 November, 13–14 November, 20–21 November, 11–12 December, and 18–19 December 2018.\nTop 16.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the Playoffs, while the third-placed teams and fourth-placed teams were eliminated. The rounds were 2–3 January, 8–9 January, 15–16 January, 22–23 January, 29–30 January, and 5–6 February 2019.\nPlayoffs.\nIn the playoffs, teams play against each other must win two games to win the series. Thus, if one team wins two games before all three games have been played, the game that remains is omitted. The team that finished in the higher Top 16 place will play the first and the third (if it is necessary) legs of the series at home. The playoffs involves the eight teams which qualified as winners and runners-up of each of the four groups in the Top 16."

The bouldering season began on April 7 at the World Cup in Meiringen, and concluded on 19 August at the World Cup in Munich. At each stop a qualifying was held on the first day, and the semi-final and final rounds were conducted on the second day of the competition. The winners were awarded trophies, and the best three finishers received medals. \nAt the end of the season an overall ranking was determined based upon points, which athletes were awarded for finishing in the top 30 of each individual event. Shauna Coxsey won the women's World Cup and Jongwon Chon won the men's World Cup.\nChanges from the previous season.\nFor the 2017 season the IFSC changed the timing method for the finals of World Cup tournaments. Beginning in 2017 any attempt would only be considered successful if the athlete had reached the top and demonstrated control over it within the four minute time limit. (\"four minutes dead\" rule) Previously boulderers had four minutes per boulder, but a boulderer was allowed to finish their attempt if they had successfully started the boulder within the four minute limit. (\"four minutes plus\" rule) \nStreaming controversy.\nBefore the start of the 2017 season the IFSC announced that they had signed a three-year contract with the streaming platform FloSports, which would have made the streams of climbing World Cups available only to paying customers instead of being freely accessible. This led to an online petition asking the IFSC to change their deal with FloSports, which was signed by more than 12,000 people, and an open letter by the Athletes' Commission. The Commission voiced their frustration over the way the IFSC had previously communicated with the community at large, and \"asked the athletes to withdraw cooperation with the livestream media until changes are made\". On the next day the IFSC apologized for having made a mistake, and announced that the deal with FloSports had not actually been signed yet despite the earlier press release, and would not be concluded.\nOverall ranking.\nNational teams.\n\"Country names as used by the IFSC\"\nMeiringen, Switzerland (7–8 April).\nWomen.\n78 athletes attended the World Cup in Meiringen.

After the death of teammate Jordan McNair, Plummer left the team and graduated in the winter of 2019 with a degree in communications and a minor in leadership studies."

        "title": "WrestleMania 37",
        "text": "WrestleMania 37 was the 37th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event was held as a two-night event, taking place on April 10 and 11, 2021, at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. Following the merger of the WWE Network under Peacock in the United States in March 2021, WrestleMania 37 became the first major WWE event for which U.S. subscribers could only livestream the event via Peacock. WWE Hall of Famers Hulk Hogan and Titus O'Neil served as the hosts of the event.\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place on March 28, 2021, at the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California; however, due to COVID-19 restrictions in California, WWE rescheduled and moved the event to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, which was the originally planned venue for WrestleMania 36 before the pandemic forced the event to be relocated and held behind closed doors at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida—in August 2020, Florida loosened its COVID-19 restrictions. As a result, the event marked the first time WWE had ticketed fans in attendance for an event during the COVID-19 pandemic, though to a limited capacity; the last WWE event to have ticketed fans was \"NXT\" on March 11, 2020, just before pandemic-related restrictions took effect. With the limited capacity, WWE claimed to have sold out of all available tickets and had an attendance of 25,675 spectators for each night, totaling 51,350 combined; however, this was disputed, with the actual number of tickets sold and the actual attendance number being around 20% lower than WWE's claimed numbers for both nights.\nThe card comprised 14 matches that were evenly divided between the two nights and unlike previous years, there were no matches contested on either night's Kickoff pre-show. In the main event for Night 1, Bianca Belair defeated Sasha Banks to win the SmackDown Women's Championship. This was the first time two African Americans headlined WrestleMania, as well as the second time women headlined the event after WrestleMania 35. Other prominent matches saw singer Bad Bunny and Damian Priest defeat The Miz and John Morrison, and in the opening bout, which was a main match for Raw, Bobby Lashley defeated Drew McIntyre by technical submission to retain the WWE Championship. In the main event for Night 2, which was SmackDown's main match, Roman Reigns defeated Daniel Bryan and Edge in a triple threat match to retain the Universal Championship. Also on the card, Rhea Ripley defeated Asuka to win the Raw Women's Championship. Natalya and Tamina became the first women at this event to ever compete in two separate matches at a single WrestleMania.\nThis was the first WrestleMania since 2002 to not feature John Cena in any capacity; the first since 2012 to not feature Brock Lesnar; and the first since 1988 to not feature Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, or Triple H as in-ring competitors (though Triple H, in his capacity as a real-life executive for the company, appeared at the beginning of Night 1 to welcome fans back). It was also the first WrestleMania since 2010 to feature WWE chairman and CEO Vince McMahon onscreen, when he opened the event to welcome fans back to WrestleMania and to their first in-person WWE event in over a year.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event, having first been held in 1985. It was the company's first pay-per-view produced and was also WWE's first major event available via livestreaming when the company launched the WWE Network in 2014. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". WrestleMania is ranked the sixth most valuable sports brand in the world by Forbes, and has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host the year's edition of WrestleMania. WrestleMania 37 featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions—unlike WrestleMania 36, it did not feature the NXT brand. \"Save Your Tears\" by The Weeknd, \"Head Up High\" by Fitz, and \"All The Gold\" by def rebel were the official theme songs for the event. WWE Hall of Famers Hulk Hogan and Titus O'Neil served as the hosts of WrestleMania 37.\nWrestleMania 37 was originally scheduled to be held in the city of Inglewood, California at SoFi Stadium on March 28, 2021, marketed as \"WrestleMania Hollywood\". It would have been the first since WrestleMania 21 to be held in Greater Los Angeles, and the seventh held in the state of California (after 2, VII, XII, 2000, 21, and 31). However, on January 16, WWE officially confirmed that WrestleMania 37 would be held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida—the originally planned venue for WrestleMania 36—as a two-night event on April 10 and 11, 2021. It was the fifth WrestleMania to be held in the state of Florida (after XXIV, XXVIII, 33, and 36). WrestleMania 37 adopted much of the pirate-themed marketing originally used for WrestleMania 36, including having a similar logo. It was also the first WWE event to have ticketed fans in attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tickets were originally to go on sale on March 16, but were delayed. Pre-sale tickets were then available on March 18 before tickets went on sale the following day. Individual tickets for each night, as well as two-night bundle packages, were made available, with a maximum capacity of 25,000 spectators for each night.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, WWE suspended its touring arena shows in mid-March 2020, and moved its weekly broadcasts for the Raw and SmackDown brands, as well as pay-per-views, to their WWE Performance Center training facility in Orlando, Florida, with no outside spectators and only essential staff present. This included WrestleMania 36, which was the first pay-per-view to be affected by the pandemic. NXT continued to broadcast from Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida, but with similar limitations. In late August, WWE moved its programming for Raw and SmackDown to Orlando's Amway Center in a bio-secure bubble called the WWE ThunderDome to display a virtual audience on LED displays around the ring, but still without outside spectators. In October, NXT moved to the Performance Center in a similar setup dubbed the Capitol Wrestling Center (which included a small live audience), while in December, the ThunderDome relocated to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.\nIn October 2020, it was reported by the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" that WWE was relocating WrestleMania 37 to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida as the state of the pandemic in California made it unlikely that the event could be held with in-person spectators on the originally scheduled date. By contrast, Florida officially removed capacity limits for sporting events in late August, but local sports organizations continued to voluntarily limit their capacity in accordance with CDC guidance. Rival promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) held tapings with spectators at Jacksonville's Daily's Place since late August 2020 at 15% of the venue's capacity. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL) began admitting fans to their games at Raymond James Stadium in October, with a maximum capacity of 25%, while Super Bowl LV was hosted by the stadium on February 7, 2021, with an official attendance of 24,835 spectators.\nOn January 16, 2021, WWE announced that WrestleMania 37 would take place at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, and, like WrestleMania 36, would be a two-night event, held on April 10 and 11, 2021. WWE also confirmed that SoFi Stadium would instead host WrestleMania 39 in 2023, as 2022's WrestleMania 38 was scheduled for AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Mayor of Tampa Jane Castor stated that the event would be \"in true WWE fashion, the perfect comeback story and marks a clear indication that our beautiful city is poised to bounce back stronger than ever.\" Mayor of Inglewood James T. Butts Jr. welcomed WWE's decision to allow Tampa to \"have their rightful WrestleMania moment\". In an interview with \"TMZ Sports\" on January 19, WWE's Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon affirmed WWE's plan to have live fans in attendance at WrestleMania 37, stating that \"hopefully, this will be the first opportunity for us to have our fans back in attendance\". She also said that they would be watching how the NFL handled hosting the Super Bowl to learn logistically what does and does not work.\nIn February, the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" reported that WWE were planning to cap attendance at 30,000 spectators for each night, but later reported that the promotion were hoping for 45,000, if it could be approved by the city of Tampa. On March 17, the \"Tampa Bay Times\" confirmed that the capacity for each night would be 25,000 spectators and that attendees would be separated by pods with physical distancing in place. They also confirmed that the stadium would administer temperature checks and wellness screenings, that masks would be required and they would have free masks available, and any transactions would be paperless.\nThe pandemic also resulted in the absence of John Cena, who although had focused heavily on his acting career since 2016, he had wrestled or appeared at every WrestleMania since WrestleMania XIX in 2003. Cena had been reported to wrestle or at least appear at WrestleMania 37, but due to his filming schedule for the HBO Max series \"Peacemaker\", which was shooting in Canada, it made it logistically impossible for him to travel to Florida, as upon his return to Canada, he would have had to quarantine for two weeks, which would have shut down production on the series. Two other big names that were absent at the event were Brock Lesnar and Goldberg. Lesnar last appeared at WrestleMania 36 and his contract expired in August 2020, and while it was believed that WWE would try to negotiate a new deal for Lesnar, there were no plans for him to appear at WrestleMania 37 by February 2021. Goldberg, who still had one more match on his contract for the year, had been briefly discussed to wrestle at the event, but by February, he was ultimately left out of any plans.\nBroadcast outlets.\nWrestleMania 37 was available on traditional pay-per-view. Additionally, on January 25, 2021, WWE announced that the streaming service Peacock would become the exclusive distributor of the WWE Network in the United States as part of a new agreement with NBCUniversal, which airs \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"NXT\" on the USA Network. On March 18, the WWE Network became a premium channel on Peacock, with premium subscribers to the service receiving access to the WWE Network at no additional cost. WrestleMania 37 was the first WrestleMania produced under this new agreement. After a brief transitional period, the standalone version of the WWE Network in the U.S. shut down on April 4, with future events only available via Peacock's WWE Network channel and traditional PPV. These changes did not impact the WWE Network outside of the U.S., which maintain the standalone service distributed by WWE and its existing partners. Following the event, WWE stated that WrestleMania 37 was Peacock's most-viewed live event to date, although they did not specify exact numbers.\nCelebrity involvement.\nAs is tradition at WrestleMania, celebrities from the entertainment field took part in the event in various capacities. Pop singer Bebe Rexha performed \"America the Beautiful\" prior to the show on Night 1, while country singer Ashland Craft did the same for Night 2. Two celebrities were directly involved in matches at the event. Rapper Bad Bunny wrestled in a tag team match, teaming with Damian Priest against The Miz and John Morrison on Night 1, while YouTube personality, actor, and boxer Logan Paul was the guest cornerman for Sami Zayn in his match against Kevin Owens on Night 2. Additionally, two musical artists performed the entrance themes for wrestlers' entrances live on Night 2. Singer Ash Costello from the rock band New Year's Day played Rhea Ripley's entrance theme, \"Brutality,\" for Ripley's entrance for her Raw Women's Championship match against defending champion Asuka, while rapper Wale did the same for Big E and his entrance theme \"Feel The Power\" for his Intercontinental Championship defense against Apollo Crews.\nOther WrestleMania Week events.\nAs part of the WrestleMania festivities during the week of the event, WWE held a number of events throughout the week. WrestleMania 37 Week began with the April 5 episode of \"Raw\". The 2021 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony then aired the following night on April 6. WWE's NXT brand held their major event, , on April 7 and 8, while a special episode of \"NXT UK\" called \"Prelude\" also aired midday on April 8. On April 9, the night before WrestleMania 37 Night 1, WWE aired a special \"WrestleMania Edition\" of \"SmackDown\". The episode featured the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, which was won by Jey Uso and was previously held at WrestleMania itself (with the exception of WrestleMania 36, in which the match was canceled due to concerns over the pandemic). The SmackDown Tag Team Championship was also defended on the episode in a fatal four-way match where Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode retained. Early on April 11, Peacock and WWE Network premiered a new episode of \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin's \"Broken Skull Sessions\", which featured AEW's Chris Jericho for the first time on WWE programming in nearly three years. The week was capped off by the \"Raw\" after WrestleMania on Monday April 12, and then finally, \"NXT\" began airing in its new Tuesday night slot.\nStorylines.\nThe event consisted of 14 matches that were evenly divided between the two nights. The matches resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nMain event matches.\nImmediately following WrestleMania XXVII in April 2011, Edge, who at the time held the now-defunct World Heavyweight Championship, was forced to retire and relinquish his title due to a severe neck injury; Edge was then inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2012.

The following year, Edge declared his participation for the 2021 Royal Rumble, vowing to win the men's Royal Rumble match so he could go to WrestleMania 37 and become a world champion again, as he had never lost his world title. At the event on January 31, Edge entered the match at number one and went on to win as a Raw wrestler and earned himself a world championship match of his choice at WrestleMania 37. Over the next week, Edge appeared on \"Raw\", \"NXT\", and \"SmackDown\", confronting each brand's world champion, but stated he would wait until after Elimination Chamber to make his decision. After SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns retained his title against Daniel Bryan at the event, Edge appeared and performed a Spear on Reigns. He then pointed to the WrestleMania sign, indicating that Edge had chosen to challenge Reigns for the Universal Championship, which was later confirmed. This came after Reigns demanded Edge to choose him, and after Reigns attacked Edge with a Spear on the February 19 episode of \"SmackDown\". However, Bryan also pursued Reigns for another championship match, mocking Reigns for defending the title against him immediately after Bryan had won SmackDown's Elimination Chamber match. At Fastlane, Bryan faced Reigns for the championship once again, with Edge acting as the special guest enforcer; Reigns won the match after Edge attacked both men with a steel chair.

Although Banks complimented Belair, she claimed that Belair was not the best as she did not have the SmackDown Women's Championship, playing off Belair's \"EST\" gimmick. On the February 26 episode of \"SmackDown\", Belair decided that she would challenge Banks for the SmackDown Women's Championship at WrestleMania 37.

This match also did not take place due to Shane injuring his knee while training; he selected Elias as his replacement to face Strowman, who defeated Elias. The following night on \"Raw\", Shane, along with Elias and Jaxson Ryker, continued to taunt Strowman, who came out and defeated Elias in a rematch.

After her brief appearance on the \"SmackDown\" after WrestleMania 37, Banks took time off but made her return during the July 30 episode, saving Belair from an attack by Carmella and Zelina Vega, who each wanted to challenge Belair for the title. Banks and Belair then teamed up and defeated Carmella and Vega, but after the match, Banks turned on and attacked Belair. A rematch between Banks and Belair for the title was later scheduled for SummerSlam. However, Banks was pulled from the event, and was replaced by another challenger who defeated Belair for the title. Banks and Belair would have their match on the October 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", where Banks was victorious.\nSami Zayn claimed that he lost to Kevin Owens at WrestleMania because he was distracted wondering if Logan Paul was okay. Zayn then called out Owens for a rematch, which was accepted by Owens, who defeated Zayn by count-out after Zayn retreated from the ring. Following the match, Owens chased Zayn and brought him back to the ring, after which Owens performed a Stunner on Zayn. After several weeks of Zayn being a hindrance to Owens, the two had another rematch at Hell in a Cell where Zayn won. The two had one further match on the July 2 episode of \"SmackDown\", where Owens defeated Zayn in a Last Man Standing match, which was also a qualifying match for the men's Money in the Bank ladder match.\nNew Intercontinental Champion Apollo Crews boasted about winning the championship. He introduced his new ally, Commander Azeez, who helped him win the title. Crews stated that Azeez was a former member of the Nigerian Elite Army and he would have given Big E a rematch for the title that night, however Big E was absent. Big E received a rematch against Crews for the title on the April 30 episode, only for the match to end via disqualification after Azeez interfered and attacked Big E.\nAfter Natalya and Tamina failed to defeat WWE Women's Tag Team Champions Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler, Natalya faced Baszler on \"SmackDown\" where Natalya was victorious. After the match, Jax attempted to attack Natalya, only for Tamina to attack Jax. On the April 30 episode, Natalya and Tamina defeated Jax and Baszler in a non-title match. This win earned Natalya and Tamina another title match, which occurred on the May 14 episode where they defeated Jax and Baszler to win the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship."

        "text": "WrestleMania 38 was the 38th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event was held as a two-night event, taking place on April 2 and 3, 2022, at the AT&amp;T Stadium in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex city of Arlington, Texas.\nThe event was the fourth WrestleMania to be held in the state of Texas (after X-Seven, 25, and 32) and the second in AT&amp;T Stadium after WrestleMania 32 in 2016. It was the third WrestleMania to feature Brock Lesnar vs. Roman Reigns in the main event (after 31 and 34). WWE billed the match as \"The Biggest WrestleMania Match of All-Time\", which was a Winner Takes All match for the promotion's two world championships, Raw's WWE Championship and SmackDown's Universal Championship, which were held by Lesnar and Reigns, respectively, going into the event. This would also be the last WrestleMania to take place under Vince McMahon's creative control, following his retirement on July 22; McMahon had served as chairman and chief executive officer of the company since 1982 and created WrestleMania in 1985, and although he returned to the company as Executive Chairman on January 10, 2023, he had no involvement in booking the event. McMahon’s involvement with the event in any capacity would come to an end as following a lawsuit in January 2024, McMahon resigned as Chairman of TKO Group Holdings, WWE’s parent company.\nThe card comprised a total of 16 matches, with seven on the first night and nine on the second. In an impromptu match that served as the main event for Night 1, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin defeated Kevin Owens in a No Holds Barred match, marking Austin's first match since WrestleMania XIX in 2003 and the final match of his career overall. This encounter had originally been advertised as a special edition of Owens' \"KO Show\" with Austin as the special guest. Other prominent matches saw a returning Cody Rhodes defeat Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, Charlotte Flair defeated Ronda Rousey to retain the SmackDown Women's Championship, and Bianca Belair defeated Becky Lynch to win the Raw Women's Championship, beginning her record-setting reign at 420 days. In the main event for Night 2, SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns defeated Raw's WWE Champion Brock Lesnar to claim both titles and become recognized as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. In other prominent matches, \"Jackass\"s Johnny Knoxville defeated Sami Zayn in an Anything Goes match and Edge defeated AJ Styles. Night 2 also featured WWE chairman Vince McMahon defeating \"SmackDown\" commentator Pat McAfee in an impromptu match after McAfee had defeated Austin Theory, marking McMahon's first match since 2012 and the last match of his career. Also on Night 2, the team of Sasha Banks and Naomi won the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship in a fatal four-way tag team match; this was Banks and Naomi's final WWE pay-per-view match. Naomi later returned to WWE at the 2024 Royal Rumble.\nThe event received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised the Raw Women's Championship, Raw Tag Team Championship match, Johnny Knoxville vs. Sami Zayn, Edge vs. AJ Styles, Pat McAfee's and Logan Paul's performance, Cody Rhodes vs. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, and the in-ring return of \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin while criticizing the main event for Night 2, Sheamus and Ridge Holland vs. The New Day, and panning Vince McMahon vs. McAfee.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event, having first been held in 1985. It was the company's first pay-per-view produced and was also WWE's first major event available via livestreaming when the company launched the WWE Network in February 2014. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, including Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were originally dubbed the \"Big Four\", and as of August 2021, it is one of the company's five biggest events of the year, along with Money in the Bank, referred to as the \"Big Five\". WrestleMania is ranked the sixth most valuable sports brand in the world by Forbes, and has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host the year's edition of WrestleMania. WrestleMania 38 featured wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The official theme songs for the event were \"Sacrifice\" by The Weeknd, \"I Feel Good\" by Pitbull, Anthony Watts, and DJWS, and \"All Nightmare Long\" by Metallica.\nOn January 16, 2021, in addition to announcing the date and location change of WrestleMania 37, which had to be rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the promotion revealed the dates and locations of the next two WrestleMania events. WrestleMania 38 was announced to be held at AT&amp;T Stadium in the Dallas suburb of Arlington, Texas. It was originally scheduled to be held solely on April 3, 2022; however, on October 25, 2021, it was revealed that like the previous two WrestleMania events, WrestleMania 38 was expanded to take place over two nights: Saturday, April 2, and Sunday, April 3, 2022. It was the fourth WrestleMania to be held in the state of Texas (after X-Seven, 25, and 32) and the second to be held in this venue, after WrestleMania 32 in 2016, which set the attendance record for a WrestleMania event at 101,763, which was, however, disputed. It was also the second WrestleMania since the Pontiac Silverdome (WrestleMania III) to be hosted in a FIFA World Cup venue as it is one of the venues hosting matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Travel packages became available on November 8, 2021, while general tickets went on sale on November 12.\nBroadcast outlets.\nIn addition to airing on traditional pay-per-view, WrestleMania 38 was available to livestream on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in international markets. Additionally, WWE partnered with Fathom Events to air both nights of WrestleMania 38 in movie theaters across the United States.\nCelebrity involvement.\nAs is tradition at WrestleMania, celebrities from the entertainment field took part in the event in various capacities. Social media personality Logan Paul, who appeared at WrestleMania 37, participated in a tag team match on WrestleMania Saturday, teaming with The Miz against Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio. \"Jackass\" actor and stuntman Johnny Knoxville competed in an Anything Goes match against Sami Zayn on WrestleMania Sunday. The Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders also appeared on stage to cheer Pat McAfee to the ring for his match against Austin Theory on WrestleMania Sunday. Additionally, country music singers Brantley Gilbert and Jessie James Decker performed \"America the Beautiful\" to open the event on Saturday and Sunday night, respectively, while DJ Valentino Khan had musical performances on both nights.\nOther WrestleMania Week events.\nAs part of the WrestleMania festivities during the week of the event, WWE held a number of events throughout the week. The week kicked off with a special \"WrestleMania Edition\" of \"Monday Night Raw\", held at the PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The night before WrestleMania 38 on April 1, WWE kicked off WrestleMania Weekend itself with a special \"WrestleMania Edition\" of \"Friday Night SmackDown\", which hosted the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, won by Madcap Moss, as well as a triple threat match for the Intercontinental Championship. Immediately after \"SmackDown\", the 2022 WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony commenced. The day of WrestleMania Saturday, WWE's NXT brand held its annual WrestleMania Week event, Stand &amp; Deliver, which aired at 1pm Eastern Time. WrestleMania Week concluded with the \"Raw\" after WrestleMania on April 4. All of the weekend events were held live from the American Airlines Center in Dallas.\nStorylines.\nThe event consisted of 16 matches, with seven on the first night and nine on the second, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nMain event matches.\nFor many years, Paul Heyman had been the advocate for Brock Lesnar. After Lesnar took a hiatus following WrestleMania 36 in April 2020, Heyman became the special counsel for Roman Reigns that August, guiding him to win SmackDown's Universal Championship. After Reigns retained the title at SummerSlam in August 2021, Lesnar returned to WWE and confronted Reigns, also implying that Heyman was still his advocate. Two months later at Crown Jewel, Reigns defeated Lesnar to retain the Universal Championship with help from The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso). A rematch was scheduled for the New Year's event Day 1, and Reigns fired Heyman as he believed Heyman was working with Lesnar behind his back. The Day 1 match, however, was canceled as Reigns tested positive for COVID-19. Due to his status as a free agent, Lesnar was instead added to Raw's multi-person WWE Championship match at Day 1 and won the title. On the following \"Raw\", Lesnar reunited with Heyman. On that week's \"SmackDown\", Lesnar challenged Reigns to a champion vs. champion match, but Reigns declined. At the Royal Rumble, Lesnar lost his WWE Championship after interference from Reigns and a double cross from Heyman, who realigned with Reigns. Later that night, Lesnar entered into the Royal Rumble match and won to earn himself a world championship match of his choice at WrestleMania 38. On the following episode of \"Raw\", Lesnar announced that he would challenge Reigns for the Universal Championship. Still wanting it to be a champion vs. champion match, and also wanting a rematch for losing his title, Lesnar was also added to the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber, which he won. With Reigns also retaining his title at the Royal Rumble and Elimination Chamber, it was confirmed that their WrestleMania match would be a Winner Takes All match for the WWE Championship and Universal Championship. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", during the contract signing for the match, the match was further stipulated as a Championship Unification match, and scheduled for the main event of Night 2.\nAfter weeks of disrespecting the state of Texas, on the March 7 episode of \"Raw\", Kevin Owens invited the \"Texas Rattlesnake\", \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, as a special guest on the \"KO Show\" at WrestleMania 38. A day later, Austin accepted and it was announced that the segment would occur on WrestleMania Saturday.\nUndercard matches.\nOn the February 25 episode of \"SmackDown\", Sasha Banks and Naomi announced that they were challenging Queen Zelina and Carmella for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 38. On the next episode of \"Raw\", Carmella and Zelina accepted. On March 4, the match was scheduled for Night 2. Rhea Ripley and Liv Morgan were added to the match after they defeated Zelina and Carmella in a non-title match on the March 7 episode of \"Raw\", and on the March 18 episode of \"SmackDown\", Shayna Baszler and Natalya were also added to the match after they caused a match pitting Banks and Naomi against Ripley and Morgan to end in a no-contest, making the match a fatal four-way tag team match.\nAt the Royal Rumble, Ronda Rousey, in her first appearance since WrestleMania 35 in April 2019, made a surprise return and won the women's Royal Rumble match to earn a women's championship match of her choice at WrestleMania 38. After pondering her choices due to having heated history with both reigning champions, on the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Rousey announced that she would challenge Charlotte Flair for the SmackDown Women's Championship. On February 24, the match was scheduled for Night 1.\nAt SummerSlam in August 2021, Becky Lynch, who had been on maternity leave since May 2020, made a surprise return and defeated Bianca Belair in an impromptu match to win the SmackDown Women's Championship in 26 seconds. Over the course of the next month, Lynch would continue to retain the championship against Belair using underhanded tactics before both were drafted to Raw in the 2021 WWE Draft; Lynch and Raw Women's Champion Charlotte Flair, who was drafted to SmackDown, traded their championships to keep the titles on their respective brands, thus Lynch became the Raw Women's Champion. After Belair failed to earn a title shot at the 2022 Royal Rumble and also failing to win the women's Royal Rumble match, Belair won the women's Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber to become the number one contender for the Raw Women's Championship at WrestleMania 38. Later that same event, Lynch retained the title, keeping her as the defending champion heading into her match against Belair at WrestleMania 38. This in turn scheduled the only two women to win in the main event of WrestleMania against each other at WrestleMania (Lynch at WrestleMania 35 and Belair at Night 1 of WrestleMania 37, respectively). On February 28, the match was scheduled for Night 1.\nOn the January 31 episode of \"Raw\", The Miz defeated Dominik Mysterio. The following week, Dominik and his father Rey Mysterio were guests on \"Miz TV\". Rey claimed that Miz cheated to defeat Dominik while Miz took issue that Rey had an opportunity to qualify for the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match while he did not and also that Rey was the cover star of the \"WWE 2K22\" video game. Miz also questioned if Rey was truly Dominik's dad, referencing the child custody battle that Rey had with Eddie Guerrero back at SummerSlam in 2005. Dominik then defeated Miz in a rematch. Rey then defeated Miz during the Elimination Chamber Kickoff pre-show. Later backstage, Miz accused Rey of cheating due to Dominik and said he would find a tag team partner who was a \"global superstar\". On the following episode of \"Raw\", as Miz teased the identity of his partner to face Rey and Dominik at WrestleMania 38, The Mysterios interrupted, stating it did not matter who Miz had chosen. Miz then revealed his partner as social media personality Logan Paul, after which, Miz and Paul attacked The Mysterios. On February 28, Miz confirmed via Twitter that the match would take place at Night 1.\nOn the February 21 episode of \"Raw\", Edge made his first post-Royal Rumble appearance where he issued an open challenge for WrestleMania 38. The following week, Edge came out to see who would answer his challenge, which was accepted by AJ Styles. Edge then stated he was glad Styles accepted as it was a match he had been wanting; however, he wanted the \"pitbull\" AJ Styles who reigned as WWE Champion, not the AJ Styles who had been Omos' tag team partner for the majority of the past year. Edge then turned heel and attacked Styles, after which, a conflicted Edge performed two con-chair-tos on Styles. On the March 7 episode, the match was scheduled for Night 2.\nOn March 3, 2022, WWE Chairman and chief executive officer Vince McMahon made a rare media appearance for a live interview on \"The Pat McAfee Show\". During the interview, McMahon offered Pat McAfee a match at WrestleMania 38. McAfee primarily served as the color commentator on \"SmackDown\", but gladly accepted and McMahon stated that he would find him an opponent. On the following night's episode of \"SmackDown\", Raw's Austin Theory, who had been under the tutelage of McMahon for the past several weeks, revealed himself as McAfee's opponent at WrestleMania 38. This marked McAfee's first match since in December 2020. On March 7, the match was scheduled for Night 2.\nAt Day 1, \"Jackass\" actor and stuntman Johnny Knoxville announced that he would be participating in the men's Royal Rumble match. Sami Zayn took issue of this, claiming that Knoxville was not qualified to compete, nor did he earn the opportunity. After Zayn lost his match on the following \"SmackDown\", Knoxville ran down to the ring and threw Zayn over the top rope, and ring announcer Mike Rome then announced that Knoxville had officially qualified for the Royal Rumble match, much to Zayn's displeasure. The two faced off in the Royal Rumble match where Zayn eliminated Knoxville. After Zayn had invited himself to the red carpet premiere of \"Jackass Forever\", for which he was kicked out, Knoxville then invited himself to Zayn's celebration for winning the Intercontinental Championship. Knoxville challenged Zayn for the title at WrestleMania 38, but Zayn declined. During Zayn's championship defense on the March 4 episode, Knoxville distracted Zayn, costing him the title. An enraged Zayn then challenged Knoxville to a match at WrestleMania 38, which Knoxville accepted. The match was subsequently scheduled for Night 2. After Knoxville shared Zayn's phone number, causing a multitude of people attempting to contact Zayn, Zayn changed the stipulation to an Anything Goes match, and Knoxville accepted.\nIn late 2021, Drew McIntyre began feuding with Happy Corbin and Madcap Moss. At Day 1, McIntyre defeated Moss. Later that night, however, Corbin and Moss attacked McIntyre backstage. McIntyre was reported to have surgery on his neck, but he returned at the Royal Rumble where he eliminated Moss and Corbin. McIntyre then defeated Moss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Elimination Chamber. On the following \"SmackDown\", McIntyre was scheduled to face Corbin, but Corbin and Moss attacked McIntyre, leading to McIntyre facing Moss again, which McIntyre won. On March 3, a match between McIntyre and Corbin was scheduled for Night 1 of WrestleMania 38.\nFor weeks, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins attempted to get a spot at WrestleMania. After failing to defeat Kevin Owens and AJ Styles to take their respective spots, Vince McMahon summoned Rollins into his office on the morning of March 28. McMahon stated that he would choose an opponent for Rollins to face at WrestleMania 38 and the opponent would be revealed at the event itself while Rollins was waiting in the ring on WrestleMania Saturday.\nOn the March 7 episode of \"Raw\", RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) defeated the teams of Kevin Owens and Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins and defending champions Alpha Academy (Otis and Chad Gable) in a triple threat tag team match to win the Raw Tag Team Championship and secure a spot at WrestleMania 38.

On March 21, a triple threat tag team match between RK-Bro, Alpha Academy, and The Street Profits for the Raw Tag Team Championship was scheduled for Night 2 of WrestleMania 38.\nOn the March 4 episode of \"SmackDown\", prior to The Usos' (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) successful SmackDown Tag Team Championship defense, they attacked Shinsuke Nakamura and Rick Boogs on the stage before introducing Universal Champion Roman Reigns. The following week, Boogs defeated Jey in a singles match, resulting in Boogs and Nakamura becoming the new number one contenders for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 38. On March 12, the match was scheduled for Night 1.\nOn the February 25 episode of \"SmackDown\", after The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Big E) won their match, they were confronted by Sheamus and Ridge Holland backstage. On the March 4 episode, Big E was scheduled to face Sheamus, but the match never began as Big E and Kingston were attacked by Sheamus and Holland, who then drove off on The New Day's ATV and destroyed it with sledgehammers. The following week, Sheamus and Holland introduced Pete Dunne, who was subsequently renamed \"Butch\". Later that night, Kingston and Big E lost to Holland and Sheamus; during the match, Holland performed an overhead belly-to-belly suplex on Big E at ringside, resulting in Big E landing on the top of his head. Big E was taken out of the arena on a stretcher and sent to a hospital, where he revealed how serious his injuries were. On the March 18 episode, Sheamus and Butch helped Holland defeat Kingston in a singles match. The following week, Xavier Woods, who recovered from an injury he suffered in mid-January, defeated Holland.

However, the match was cut from Night 1 due to time, and was rescheduled to Night 2.\nOn the March 28 episode of \"Raw\", following Omos' match, Omos was interviewed about who could challenge him next when Bobby Lashley, in his first appearance since Elimination Chamber, appeared. Lashley and Omos then engaged in a brawl, which ended when Lashley managed to knock Omos off his feet. Later that night, a match between the two was made official for Night 2 of WrestleMania 38.\nEvent.\nNight 1.\nPreliminary matches.\nWrestleMania Saturday opened with The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defending the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura and Rick Boogs. During the match, Boogs legitimately injured his right knee after attempting to lift both of The Usos on his shoulders. As Nakamura attempted to perform a Kinshasa on Jey, Jey countered with a Superkick. Jey tagged in Jimmy, who performed an Uso Splash on Nakamura for a nearfall. In the end, The Usos performed the 1D on Nakamura to retain the titles. Following the match, medical personnel tended to Boogs.\nNext, Drew McIntyre faced Happy Corbin (accompanied by Madcap Moss).

Lesnar then executed an F-5 on Reigns for a nearfall. As Lesnar attempted a second F-5, Reigns countered by sending Lesnar into the referee, incapacitating him. Reigns took the opportunity to attack Lesnar with a low blow and then strike Lesnar with the title for a nearfall. Reigns performed a Spear on Lesnar and as Reigns attempted another Spear, Lesnar countered and applied the Kimura lock on Reigns. However, Heyman helped Reigns void the submission. In the closing moments, as Lesnar attempted an F-5, Reigns escaped and performed a fourth Spear on Lesnar to win the match and claim both titles to become recognized as the first-ever Undisputed WWE Universal Champion, as well as marking the sixth time a heel won the main event of WrestleMania, including two in a row for Reigns. Although WWE billed the match as a championship unification match, both titles remain independently active, with Reigns recognized as a double champion.\nReception.\nAccording to the analytics firm Conviva, WrestleMania accumulated a record 2.2 billion impressions across all social platforms, compared to 1.8 billion for Super Bowl LVI, and up 10% from the previous year. In addition, WWE amassed 1.1 billion video views (up 47% from the previous year) across various social media networks, 13.1 million hours of video watch time (up 29% from the previous year), and 87 million engagements over the weekend of the event. Furthermore, WrestleMania 38 generated $206.5 million for the Dallas/Arlington region, setting a company record and the first time that a WrestleMania generated more than $200 million in economic impact.\nWWE reported that Night 1 of WrestleMania had an attendance of 77,899, and that Night 2 had an attendance of 78,453. Bryan Alvarez of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" reported the actual numbers as being 65,719 and 65,653, respectively.\nThe event received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised the Raw Women's Championship, Raw Tag Team Championship match, Johnny Knoxville vs. Sami Zayn, Edge vs. AJ Styles, Pat McAfee's and Logan Paul's performance, Cody Rhodes vs. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, and the in-ring return of \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin while criticizing the main event for Night 2, Sheamus and Ridge Holland vs. The New Day, and panning Vince McMahon vs. McAfee, which received a -2 star rating from Dave Meltzer.\nThe Raw Women's Championship match was praised. Brent Brookhouse of \"CBS Sports\" gave the match an A+ grade, the highest grade of the event, stating that the match \"stole the show\", was \"fantastic\", and that \"the crowd was absolutely mad for the finish\". He also mentioned that Belair \"is the next wrestler to have an Undertaker-style \"streak\" at WrestleMania\". Chris Mueller of \"Bleacher Report\" also gave the match a grade of A+, stating that \"a lot of fans were expecting this to be similar to SummerSlam, but with Belair winning this time\", but \"WWE gave them big entrances and more than enough time to make sure this was a great match\". He also said that the match \"felt more like a fight with a lot of aggression\", and concluded that \"this was the first bout that felt truly worthy of being on the WrestleMania card. Everything about it was as close to perfect as you can get\". Wade Keller of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" gave the match 4.5 stars, calling the match \"excellent\", and that Becky Lynch's dominance \"felt like it was ultimately giving away a Belair win\". He also said that the counters \"were really well executed\", the \"facial expressions and body language in between moves took the match to another level\", and that \"it felt like real redemption for Belair, even if Becky came across as being a notch better than her throughout most of the match\". Dave Meltzer gave the match 4.5 stars.\nCody Rhodes' return was also praised. \"CBS Sports\" said that \"the match got a bit sloppy, especially down the stretch but as a moment, it served its purpose quite well\", and gave the match a grade of B+. \"Bleacher Report\" gave the match an A grade, stating that it \"was a fantastic display of what you would call \"big-match wrestling.\" They played to the crowd, sold the big spots and made each other look like a million bucks\". He also said that \"even though this was Rhodes' big return, it was not a one-sided fight. Rollins made him work for the win\". \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" gave the match 4.25 stars, and called the match \"excellent\" while also stating that \"Cody's got to be mostly happy with that, even if there might have a spot or two where there was a little sign of rust\". He also liked Rhodes \"channeling his dad for the winning finishing sequence\", and concluded that \"there might have been some work to do\" in giving Rhodes \"a mega-star reaction\". Dave Meltzer gave the match 4.5 stars.\n\"CBS Sports\" praised Rey and Dominik Mysterio vs. The Miz and Logan Paul, stating that \"a celebrity match at WrestleMania was a fun ride\", and that \"Paul being a young, athletic performer didn't hurt anything\". \"Bleacher Report\" stated that Paul \"put in the work to make sure he did not embarrass himself here. Not only did he hold his own, but he also had a few impressive moments\". He concluded that \"Rey and The Miz being the veterans they are meant it had a little shine on it\", and that it exceeded expectations. \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" said that \"Logan showed good athleticism and didn't try to do too much\", and that \"what he did do looked really good\". Dave Metlzer gave the match 3.5 stars.\nFor the in-ring return of \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, \"CBS Sports\" gave it a grade of A, stating that \"this wasn't anywhere near the best of either man's career\", but \"as a purely \"special moment\" that played to the fans and the \"big moments\" of WrestleMania, it was fantastic\". He concluded that \"Given Austin's physical limitations -- the impact of a long history of knee injuries was particularly clear throughout -- you can't ask for a much better \"walk and brawl\" style match\". \"Bleacher Report\" said that the match was not \"a classic match that will be studied for years\", but it \"was fun, entertaining and memorable\", and \"this is what it takes to make a WrestleMania moment\". He concluded that Night 1 of the event \"ended up exceeding expectations. A couple of the results were genuinely shocking, we saw a few Match of the Year candidates and Austin worked his first match in nearly two decades. Not too shabby\". \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" said that \"the match wasn't pretty, and Austin didn't look like he was in his physical prime by any means when he was stomping KO in the corner, but he didn't embarrass himself either\". Dave Meltzer gave the match 3.5 stars.\n\"CBS Sports\" stated that the Anything Goes match between Johnny Knoxville and Sami Zayn \"was basically a Looney Tunes cartoon in the form of a wrestling match\". He said that \"some of the gimmicks didn't work\", but \"as pure entertainment, the match was a complete success\". Erik Beaston of \"Bleacher Report\" stated that match \"was either going to be a cluster of massive proportions that embarrassed everyone involved or a total blast\", but it \"was the latter and both performers deserve props for crafting a match that kept the fans invested and entertained throughout\". He concluded that \"this was a great example of garbage wrestling done at an elite level and perhaps Zayn's greatest accomplishment in his WWE run\". \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" said that the match \"was rather excruciating, but that was the point\", and that \"Knoxville played his part well and Sami was a delightful foil and spot on with his tone and mannerisms throughout\". The match was not given a rating by Dave Meltzer.\nFor the Raw Tag Team Championship match, \"CBS Sports\" called it \"really fun, all-action match to get the show off on the right foot\". \"Bleacher Report\" said that the match \"was a fantastic way to kick off the show and set the bar for the rest of the broadcast\". \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" called it \"an energetic crowd-pleasing opening tag match\", and that the match was \"a spotfest, but they managed to give every big spot a chance to breathe\". Dave Meltzer gave the match 4.25 stars.\nSheamus and Ridge Holland vs. The New Day was criticized, mainly due to it getting moved from Night 1 to Night 2 and lasting less than two minutes. \"CBS Sports\" called it \"terribly short and pointless\", and \"it's not that the outcome was wrong so much as the match just felt smashed in after getting cut from Night 1\". \"Bleacher Report\" stated that the match \"was deemed expendable on Saturday, so it was never expected to be a memorable contest\", and that \"the same team that has won everything for the last two months scored another win that did nothing to elevate them or make the feud any more meaningful\". \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" called it \"something they could have wedged into last night's show\". Dave Meltzer gave the match 0.25 stars.\nFor Pat McAfee vs. Austin Theory and McAfee vs. Vince McMahon, \"CBS Sports\" stated that \"the crowd was hot for McAfee and popped big for his win\", but gave McAfee vs. McMahon a grade of F, calling it \"ridiculous\" and it also made McAfee look ridiculous, but gave an A+ for the \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin vs. McMahon callback. \"Bleacher Report\" said that \"McAfee held his own, performed up to the moment and should be allowed back in the ring whenever the opportunity presents itself\". However, he also mentioned that \"the post-match\" \"threatened to undo everything accomplished by the first match\", stating that \"the WWE chairman made the former NFL kicker look like a geek\", but called it an \"impressive turnaround\". \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" said that \"McAfee did what he could to make that passable action, but nobody was holding McMahon to usual standards, of course. McMahon hammed it up\". Dave Meltzer gave McAfee vs. Theory 3.75 stars.\nFor the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship match, \"CBS Sports\" said that the match \"was served by pure non-stop action. Well-structured all-around\". \"Bleacher Report\" said that \"the effort was there\", but \"the match consisted more of spots and flashy sequences than an easily tracked narrative\", while also mentioning that \"one of the two babyface teams had to win here and, given the fact that Banks had competed at six WrestleManias without a win, this was as good a time as any to right that wrong\", and that Banks and Naomi's win \"will hopefully inspire the creative team to take the tag titles seriously\". Dave Meltzer gave the match 2.5 stars.\nFor the Winner Takes All Championship Unification match, \"CBS Sports\" called the finish \"sudden\" and that \"the match was a bit lacking in the overall drama compared to previous Reigns vs. Lesnar contests\", and called it \"a bit of a disappointment\", but concluded that \"there weren't many matches that disappointed across the weekend\". \"Bleacher Report\" also called the finish \"anticlimactic\", and that \"the feud, the competitors and the audience deserved something a bit more definitive than that\", but said that \"the right guy went over and Reigns finally has his defining WrestleMania moment, something he and WWE have chased for years\". \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" gave the match 4 stars, stating that while the finish came out of nowhere, the match was \"dramatic\" and that it \"had an epic feel. It didn't amount to an all-time classic, but the story it told was done really effectively and felt like a really big deal every minute of the way\". Keller also stated that \"Heyman was tremendous in his role\", and concluded that the story was \"Lesnar was just too happy-to-lucky and it made him a little soft\". Dave Meltzer gave the match 3.25 stars.\nFor the other rated matches on the card, according to Dave Meltzer, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match received 1.5 stars, Drew McIntyre vs. Happy Corbin received 2.75 stars, the SmackDown Women's Championship match received 2 stars, Bobby Lashley vs. Omos received 0.5 stars, and Edge vs. AJ Styles received 3.75 stars.\nAftermath.\nFollowing his well-received performance at the event, Logan Paul would go on to sign with WWE on June 30 later that year. Seeking revenge, Paul stated on a video that he would be coming for The Miz. He then appeared on the July 18 episode of \"Raw\" to confront The Miz, setting up a match between the two at SummerSlam, where Paul won.\nAlso, Sasha Banks and Naomi would successfully retain the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship against their WrestleMania opponents in regular tag team matches over the next few weeks. Their title defense on the May 13 episode of \"SmackDown\" would be their final televised WWE appearance, and their match at a WWE Live event on May 15 proved to be their final WWE match, as on the May 16 episode of \"Raw\", Banks and Naomi were scheduled to take part in a six-pack challenge to determine the number one contender for the Raw Women's Championship at Hell in a Cell, but due to legitimate creative frustrations, they walked out of the arena. They were subsequently suspended and stripped of their titles. This made WrestleMania 38 the last WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming event Banks and Naomi took part in. In December 2022, it was reported that contract negotiations with Banks fell through during the summer and she was done with WWE. Banks then debuted for both New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and World Wonder Ring Stardom at Wrestle Kingdom 17 on January 4, 2023, changing her ring name to Mercedes Moné. Additionally, on March 23, 2023, Naomi confirmed on her Instagram page that she was no longer with WWE. Naomi would later make her return to WWE at the 2024 Royal Rumble event.\nWrestleMania 38 would be the last WrestleMania to take place under Vince McMahon's creative control. On July 22, Vince announced his retirement from the company. In addition to creating WrestleMania, McMahon had served as chairman and chief executive officer of the company since 1982. Stephanie McMahon and Nick Khan took over as co-CEOs, and the former also took over as Chairwoman of WWE. Vince's son-in-law Stephanie's husband, Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque, took over creative control. Stephanie would resign as co-CEO and chairwoman on January 10, 2023, with Khan being named the sole CEO and Vince returning as Executive Chairman. Although Vince returned in an executive role, Triple H maintained complete control of booking WWE's storylines.\nRaw.\nCody Rhodes opened the post-WrestleMania episode of \"Raw\", revealing that he returned to WWE to live the legacy of his late father, Dusty Rhodes, and win the WWE Championship. The following week, he wrestled his first match on \"Raw\" since May 2016, where he defeated The Miz. After the match, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins confronted Rhodes, setting up a rematch between the two at WrestleMania Backlash, which Rhodes won. On \"Raw\" the next night, Rollins cost Rhodes a championship match. This would lead to a third match between the two at Hell in a Cell, this time as a Hell in a Cell match, where Rhodes, despite suffering a legitimate torn pectoral muscle before the event, managed to defeat Rollins again.\nThe Judgment Day (Edge and Damian Priest) would also continue their rivalry with AJ Styles, leading to a rematch between Styles and Edge at WrestleMania Backlash. At the event, despite Priest being banned from ringside, Edge again defeated Styles after interference from Rhea Ripley, who would join The Judgment Day. At Hell in a Cell, The Judgment Day defeated Styles' team in a six-person mixed tag team match, thus ending their feud with Styles. On \"Raw\" the following night, Finn Bálor was added to The Judgment Day. Afterwards, however, Bálor, Priest, and Ripley turned on Edge, kicking him out of the group. At Clash at the Castle in September, The Judgment Day recruited Dominik Mysterio. Edge then continued his feud with The Judgment Day over the next few months and into 2023. The rivalry would go all the way to a Hell in a Cell match between Bálor's \"Demon\" persona and Edge at Night 2 of WrestleMania 39, which was won by Edge.\nOn the following \"Raw\", MVP, Bobby Lashley's manager, turned on Lashley and sided with Omos. The following week, MVP stated that he did so because he lambasted Lashley for celebrating his WrestleMania moment without him. This would lead to a rematch between Lashley and Omos at WrestleMania Backlash, with Omos winning this time. On the May 16 episode of \"Raw\", Lashley defeated Omos again, this time in a Steel Cage match. The following week, a 2-on-1 handicap match pitting Lashley against MVP and Omos was scheduled for Hell in a Cell, which Lashley won to end the feud.\nFollowing his embarrassment by \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin at WrestleMania 38, on the April 11 episode of \"Raw\", Austin Theory was told by Vince McMahon that he would just be known as \"Theory\", as the name \"Austin\" did not suit Theory. During Clash at the Castle, Theory would revert to his Austin Theory ring name again.\nAlso on \"Raw\", Bianca Belair, who sported a black eye from her win over Becky Lynch at WrestleMania 38, stated that she would defend her newly-won Raw Women's Championship against everyone now that she was the champion. Three weeks later, Lynch made her first appearance since WrestleMania 38 and wanted a rematch for the title, but was interrupted by a returning Asuka. At Hell in a Cell, Asuka and Lynch were unsuccessful in defeating Belair in a triple threat match for the title. Lynch then completed her feud with Asuka on the July 4 episode of \"Raw\", defeating her in a No Holds Barred match. Belair soon reignited her feud with Lynch, leading to a title rematch at SummerSlam, where Belair retained. After the match, Lynch embraced Belair, turning face for the first time since May 2020. Belair would continue as champion until Night of Champions on May 27, 2023, where she lost the title to Asuka, ending her reign at 420 days, the longest in the title's history, as well as the longest WWE women's championship reign of the modern era.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following \"SmackDown\", Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns claimed he had nothing left to prove, but said that SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) needed to go to \"Raw\" and unify the Raw Tag Team Championship with their tag team titles so that The Bloodline would have all the gold. The following week, Raw Tag Team Champions RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) accepted the challenge and the match was scheduled for WrestleMania Backlash. However, on the April 29 episode, the match was changed to a six-man tag team match pitting The Bloodline against RK-Bro and Drew McIntyre, which was won by The Bloodline. The tag team championship unification match was rescheduled to the May 20 episode, where The Usos won to become the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champions.\nAfter WrestleMania 38, the trio of Sheamus, Ridge Holland, and Butch would dub themselves as The Brawling Brutes and continued their feud with The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods), with one member of each team scoring a win over the other in singles matches. This eventually led to a tables match pitting Sheamus and Holland against Woods and Kingston on the May 6 episode of \"SmackDown\", where Sheamus and Holland won after interference from Butch. After two more weeks of the teams trading wins in singles matches, on the May 27 episode, Drew McIntyre joined The New Day in defeating The Brawling Brutes in a six-man tag team match. The following week, The Brawling Brutes defeated The New Day and McIntyre in a rematch to end the feud.\nAfter Madcap Moss cost Happy Corbin his match at WrestleMania 38, dissension arose between the two, with Corbin blaming Moss for his loss. Over the coming weeks, the two continued to taunt each other, leading to a match at WrestleMania Backlash, where Moss won. On the following \"SmackDown\", Corbin attacked Moss, slamming his André the Giant Memorial Trophy on the chair wrapped around his neck, leading to Moss suffering a (kayfabe) cervical contusion. Moss returned on the June 3 episode, where he lost to Corbin via disqualification after using a steel chair, setting up a No Holds Barred match between the two at Hell in a Cell, where Moss won. The two had one further match on the June 17 episode as a \"Last Laugh\" match, which was won by Moss, thus ending their feud.\nAfter failing to defeat SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair, Ronda Rousey appeared on the following \"SmackDown\" to challenge Flair to an \"I Quit\" match for the title. Flair declined, ordering Rousey to go back to the locker room. During \"Talking Smack\" the next day, however, the championship rematch was scheduled for WrestleMania Backlash. At the event, Rousey defeated Flair to win the title for the first time. Afterwards, it was announced that Flair had (kayfabe) broken her radial bone in her forearm, putting her out of action for several months. Flair returned on the December 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", where she challenged and defeated Rousey in an impromptu match to reclaim the title for a record seventh time.\nOn the June 17 episode of \"SmackDown\", after Roman Reigns retained the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, he claimed that there was no one left to face him. Afterwards, Brock Lesnar made his first appearance since WrestleMania 38, and offered Reigns a handshake. As Reigns went to shake his hand, Lesnar attacked Reigns and then attacked The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), who had come to Reigns' aid. It was subsequently announced that Reigns would defend the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Lesnar in a Last Man Standing match at SummerSlam, which WWE billed as their last match against each other. At the event, Reigns, with interference from The Usos, Paul Heyman, and Theory, defeated Lesnar to retain the titles and end their rivalry. Reigns would eventually feud with Cody Rhodes, winning their first encounter at Night 2 of WrestleMania 39, but in the main event of Night 2 of WrestleMania XL, Rhodes defeated Reigns in a Bloodline Rules match to end Reigns' 1,316 day reign as Universal Champion."

        "title": "Irish cricket team in England in 2019",
        "text": "The Ireland cricket team toured England in July 2019 to play a one-off four-day Test match at Lord's. It was the first Test match to be played between the two sides, and was England's first four-day Test match since they toured New Zealand in 1971. It was Ireland's third Test match, and their twelfth international fixture against England.\nThe Test match was part of England's preparations for the 2019 Ashes series. Ahead of the Test, the England cricket team visited Ireland in May to play a one-off One Day International (ODI) match. Ireland also played a two-day warm-up match against a Middlesex 2nd XI side at the Merchant Taylors' School Ground in Northwood.\nEngland won the one-off Test match by 143 runs, with Ireland being bowled out for 38 runs in their second innings.\nSquads.\nAhead of the one-off Test, James Anderson was ruled out of England's squad with a calf injury.\nOnly Test.\nSummary.\nThe Test match, which was seen as a warm-up for the upcoming Ashes for the England team, was an historical occasion for the Ireland team, played out at Lord's. For England, Test debutants Olly Stone and Jason Roy, the latter who was part of the World Cup winning team, were among the players looking to find a place in the lineup for the Ashes series. Ireland's team, which was playing in just its third Test since achieving Test status in 2017, saw the debut of fast bowler Mark Adair.\nFaced with a flat, green pitch, which was expected to offer some assistance to the bowlers in the first few hours but then leave batting as a more straightforward affair, England won the toss and elected to bat. Things started to go wrong almost immediately, with Jason Roy out for five, caught on an edge to Paul Stirling at first slip, off a ball by Tim Murtagh, in the third over. Incoming Joe Denly managed to hold on to score 23 runs before being dismissed leg before wicket to Mark Adair, bringing the England total to 36 for two. at which point England lost six wickets for seven runs to end up at 43 for seven, four batsmen falling to Tim Murtagh, who became the first Irish player to get a five-wicket haul in Test cricket. Sam Curran and Olly Stone added some runs to the total, but the latter was bowled out by Adair for the final wicket, with England all out for 85 before lunch in just 23.4 overs, beating the previous 19th century Lord's record and marking the fourth time in the last three years that England lost ten wickets in a single session.\nResuming after lunch, as the surface began to improve, Ireland's openers brought the total to 45 for two before the partnership of Paul Stirling and Andrew Balbirnie brought Ireland's lead to 42 at tea, thanks in part to a rapid half century by Balbirnie. Good spells by Stuart Broad and Olly Stone, who each took three wickets after the interval, allowed England to remain in the game, with Ireland losing five wickets for just 17 runs and falling to 149 for seven. After the end of the pace bowlers' spells, however, Ireland's tail managed to recover and extended the lead to over a hundred thanks to efforts by Kevin O'Brien and Murtagh, to bring a first-innings total of 207 for Ireland.\nWith one over left in the first day's play, Jack Leach opened England's batting as nightwatchman, surviving the uneventful final over in what was a \"bizarre day of Test cricket\", which witnessed the fall of 20 wickets. The following morning saw the wicket of Rory Burns fall early, but a 145-run second wicket partnership between Leach and Jason Roy suggested that England might be able to set an intimidating second innings total for Ireland. However, after the fall of Roy's wicket, the only batsmen beside Leach to reach a half-century, Leach ended up eight runs short of becoming the first England nightwatchman to score a century, falling prey to the nervous nineties after batting for more than four hours. He joined Alex Tudor, Harold Larwood, Eddie Hemmings and Jack Russell in getting within ten runs of the milestone. England lost a further seven wickets for 77 runs, before play was interrupted early in the evening because of thunder and lightning. This left England on 303 for nine at the close, with Ireland having a chance of achieving an upset going into the third day. England's last wicket fell on the first ball of the following morning, leaving a target of 182 to win for Ireland.\nStuart Broad and Chris Woakes then opened the bowling for England, with Woakes getting an early breakthrough by dismissing the Ireland captain William Porterfield on the last ball of the fourth over. Things went downhill for Ireland from there, Broad and Woakes combining to take all ten wickets between them, with Woakes finishing six wickets for seventeen runs, taking his third five-wicket haul at Lord's. Despite interruptions due to the inclement weather, Ireland ended up being bowled out for 38 before the end of the morning session, lasting only 15.4 overs, the seventh-lowest total in a Test match innings. Jack Leach was named the man of the match, after his 92 runs in the second innings. Initially this was not enough to secure a spot in the first Test of the Ashes, however, he was named in the squad for the second Test, after Moeen Ali was dropped.\nAftermath.\nDespite the victory, England captain Joe Root later lashed out at the \"substandard pitch\" which did not come \"even close to a fair contest between bat and ball throughout the whole game\", and might have been a contributing factor to the low scores achieved, combined with similarly substandard batting displays by both sides. For his five-wicket haul in the first innings, Tim Murtagh's name was added to the Away Team Honours Board."

        "title": "British Grand Prix Trophy",
        "text": "The first British Grand Prix was held in 1926, however it was not until the fifth event, held in 1950, that a trophy was first awarded to the winner. The first trophy presented by the Royal Automobile Club was the Mervyn O'Gorman trophy, awarded from 1950 until the early 1970s, when it was replaced by the present gold Royal Automobile Club Trophy. The official, perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the British Grand Prix and then returned to the Royal Automobile Club, where it is permanently housed.\nSince 1952, the winner of the British Grand Prix has generally also been awarded a trophy by the principal sponsor of the race (for 1952, the Daily Express), which is won outright each year and replaced by a new trophy for the following year's event. In some years, it is the sponsor's trophy, rather than the official RAC trophy, which is handed to the winner on the podium, which is why post-race photographs since 1950 have shown many more than the two official trophies that have ever been awarded. The winners of international Grands Prix are awarded trophies from countries where the race took place, and by a variety of event sponsors, therefore international trophies may vary hugely in style and colour.\nThe current trophy holder is Max Verstappen The first trophy was awarded to Giuseppe Farina, whilst Stirling Moss was the first Briton to win. Forty-four drivers have won the British Grand Prix since 1926 (on two occasions with two drivers sharing the winning car), of whom thirty-nine have been recipients of the official winner's trophy. Twelve of the winners have been British, all having won since 1950 and including the joint victory by Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks in 1957.\nThe Royal Automobile Club Trophy.\nThe present official winner's trophy is a large, ornate trophy, being an example of a Victorian, two-handled cup. It is thinly covered with hallmarked sterling silver leaf. The classical waisted urn-shaped body is decorated with eight lobes to its upper half, each hand engraved with floral designs.\nThe lower half of the main body has four round, bead bordered insignias, the front-facing one is engraved with the title of the trophy. The cover mirrors the upper body with the eight lobes rising to large stylised types of fruit.\nThe stem of the trophy is all supported and reinforced by four-wheel and scroll cast brackets, the conventional heraldic engraving indicating Eton College and the Royal Automobile Club. The trophy is mounted on a polished mahogany base with gold plated plinth band engraved with the winners' names from 1948 to 2005 when a second larger base was added to accommodate future names. It is not known why the names of the winners from 1926 and 1927 have been omitted, nor why the winners from 1948 and 1949 are included, even though they never actually received the trophy.\nHistory.\nThe Mervyn O'Gorman trophy was an old Brooklands trophy, last awarded in 1909, which was donated by Mervyn O'Gorman to the RAC in April 1950, following the failure of the Brooklands race track to reopen after the Second World War. The last time this trophy was presented was at the 1972 British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch, with the Royal Automobile Club Trophy first awarded at the 1973 British Grand Prix at Silverstone the following year and was first pictured in the official event programme in 1974.\nLittle is known of the origins of the present gold trophy and despite much research, the Royal Automobile Club has never been able to establish where it came from. The only clue lies in the motto which displays, 'Floreat Etona' or 'let Eton Flourish', suggesting perhaps that it was donated to the Royal Automobile Club by the late Sir Charles Rolls, co-founder of the Rolls-Royce Motor Company and former pupil of Eton College.\nThe trophy was originally awarded at the Richmond Horse Show in 1898. The BRDC had it re-engraved, to succeed the Mervyn O'Gorman trophy, which by the 1970s was considered too heavy and cumbersome.\nOther awards.\nPrize money.\nBefore the institution of a winner's trophy, the only award for being placed in the British Grand Prix was the prize money on offer. For the first two British Grands Prix held at Brooklands, the prize money was £1,000 to the winner, £300 to the second-placed finisher and £200 for finishing third. For the first post-Second World War British Grand Prix in 1948, prize money was awarded to the entrants of the top ten finishers, ranging from £500 to the winner to £20 for tenth place, and the amounts awarded changed little over the next few years, although by 1958 the winner's prize had increased to £750.\nFred G. Craner Memorial Trophy.\nIn addition to the official winner's trophy, in 1950 the RAC also awarded for the first time a further perpetual trophy, the Fred G. Craner Memorial Car Trophy, for the highest-placed British competitor driving a British car, which was awarded until at least 1972. Fred Craner had been secretary of the Derby &amp; District Motor Club and instrumental in establishing Donington Park as a motor racing circuit and in organising the Donington Grands Prix. The first winner of this trophy was Bob Gerard driving an ERA, who finished fifth overall. The first occasion on which the winners of the British Grand Prix also won the Fred G. Craner Memorial Trophy was at Aintree in 1957, when the winners were Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks driving a Vanwall.\nWinners.\nMultiple winners.\n\"Embolded drivers are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\""

        "title": "Bouldering at the 2018 IFSC Climbing World Cup",
        "text": "The 2018 season of the IFSC Climbing World Cup was the 20th season of the competition. Bouldering competitions were held at seven stops of the IFSC Climbing World Cup. The bouldering season began on April 13 at the World Cup in Meiringen, and concluded on 18 August with the World Cup in Munich. At each stop a qualifying was held on the first day of the competition, and the semi-final and final rounds are conducted on the second day of the competition. The winners were awarded trophies, and the best three finishers received medals. At the end of the season an overall ranking was determined based upon points, which athletes were awarded for finishing in the top 30 of each individual event. Jernej Kruder won the seasonal title in the men's competition and Miho Nonaka won the women's. Japan won the national team competition.\nChanges from the previous season.\nFor the 2018 season the IFSC changed the scoring method for its tournaments. Previously topped boulders were the deciding factor, followed as tiebreakers in decreasing order of importance: attempts to tops, bonus holds (renamed to \"zones\"), and attempts to bonus holds. The first and second tiebreakers switched places which means that the results were determined by tops, zones, attempts to tops, and attempts to zones.\nAlso athletes now need to demonstrate firm control of the two starting hand holds. Previously touching all four marked start points in any manner was deemed sufficient to start an attempt.\nOverall ranking.\nThe overall ranking was determined based upon points, which athletes were awarded for finishing in the top 30 of each individual event. There were seven competitions in the season, but only the best six attempts were counted. The national ranking was the sum of the points of that country's three best male and female athletes. Results displayed \"(in brackets)\" were not counted.\nMen.\nThe results of the ten most successful athletes of the Bouldering World Cup 2018:\nWomen.\nThe results of the ten most successful athletes of the Bouldering World Cup 2018:\nNational Teams.\nThe results of the ten most successful countries of the Bouldering World Cup 2018:\n\"Country names as used by the IFSC\"\nMeiringen, Switzerland (13–14 April).\nWomen.\n99 athletes attended the World Cup in Meiringen. Miho Nonaka (4T4z 5 5) won the competition in front of Janja Garnbret (4T4z 7 5).\nMen.\n109 athletes attended the World Cup in Meiringen. Jernej Kruder (3T4z 7 8) won the competition in front of Tomoa Narasaki (2T4z 3 7).\nMoscow, Russia (21–22 April).\nWomen.\n100 athletes attended the World Cup in Moscow. Janja Garnbret (4T4z 7 5) won the competition in front of Miho Nonaka (4T4z 7 5), thereby reversing their finish order from Meiringen. As Garnbret and Nonoka achieved identical scores in the final their semi-final scores were used to determine final standings. Akiyo Noguchi, Fanny Gibert, and Shauna Coxsey came in 3rd, 5th, and 6th respectively, thus repeating their exact results from Meiringen. Petra Klingler completed the final in 4th place.\nMen.\n109 athletes attended the World Cup in Moscow. Tomoa Narasaki (4T4z 12 12) won the competition in front of Jernej Kruder (3T4z 5 6). Thus –as in the women's competition– the winner and runner-up from Meiringen switched places. Jongwon Chon and Alexey Rubtsov also managed back to back final appearances.\nChongqing, China (5–6 May).\nThe Chongqing World Cup was held outdoors and is affected by humidity to a greater extent than the European hosted World Cups. A lightning storm before the semi-finals made conditions difficult for climbers.\nThe routesetting used a large number of volumes which exhausted Gecko King's inventory.\nWomen.\n47 athletes attended the World Cup in Chongqing. Akiyo Noguchi (4T4z 5 5) won the competition in front of Miho Nonaka (3T3z 7 7). They led from the start as the only two competitors to top the first problem, a burly overhang with a feet first start.\nJanja Garnbret and Shauna Coxsey, who had made the finals of both previous World Cups did not attend Chongqing.\nNotably Gejo finished in front of Kipriianova for the bronze medal, a result that would have been reversed under the old scoring rules. This was the first time that results under the new system, which weights zones (bonuses) above attempts, differed from that of the old system.\nMen.\n83 athletes attended the World Cup in Chongqing. Of the four final problem the first one was flashed by all competitors, and the fourth yielded no points for anyone, thus the final standings were effectively decided by the second and fourth boulder only. Kokoro Fujii (3T3z 9 8) won the competition in front of Sean McColl (2T3z 2 4). Jernej Kruder and Alexey Rubtsov had their third straight finals appearances this season.\nJongwon Chon was not competing because of a scheduling clash with the South Korean Asian Games qualifications.\nTai'an, China (12–13 May).\nWomen.\n47 athletes attended the World Cup in Tai'an. Just as in Chongqing Akiyo Noguchi (4T4z 5 5) and Miho Nonaka (4T4z 10 7) dominated the women's final, each finishing two tops ahead of the competition. Noguchi claimed her second straight win while Nonaka continued her streak of finishing at least second in each bouldering competition this season.\nShauna Coxsey, Janja Garnbret and Petra Klingler were not competing.\nMen.\n93 athletes attended the World Cup in Tai'an. The final was decided on the final problem after all climbers achieved scores on the first three problems. Alex Khazanov (3T4z 7 9) was the only athlete to top the last boulder, and thus won the World Cup in front of Jernej Kruder (2T4z 2 5), the only climber to reach all finals of the season.\nHachioji, Japan (2–3 June).\nWomen.\n68 athletes attended the World Cup in Hachioji. As in the two preceding World Cups Akiyo Noguchi (3T3z 5 5) won in front of Miho Nonaka (3T3z 6 6). After the World Cup Noguchi and Nonaka thus led the competition for the seasonal title by a sufficient margin to leave only them in contention for first and second place.\nMen.\n91 athletes attended the World Cup in Hachioji. Gabriele Moroni (2T4z 3 6) won his first World Cup in his career of more than ten years. Tomoa Narasaki (1T3z 1 6) came in second. Jernej Kruder missed the finals for the first time in the season.\nVail, United States (8–9 June).\nWomen.\n58 athletes attended the World Cup in Vail. Alex Puccio (3T3z 6 4) won, attending her first World Cup of the 2018 season. The second place went to Miho Nonaka (2T3z 3 4), who continued her streak of finishing at least second in all World Cups of the season. The winner of the three previous World Cups, Akiyo Noguchi (1T3z 2 6), came in third, winning her tenth consecutive medal at Bouldering World Cups.\nMen.\n91 athletes attended the World Cup in Vail. Rei Sugimoto (3T4z 4 5) won in front of Sean Bailey (2T4z 2 6).\nMunich, Germany (17–18 August).\nWomen.\n102 athletes attended the World Cup in Munich. Janja Garnbret (4T4z 4 4) won, solving each problem in her first attempt. The second place went to Miho Nonaka (4T4z 5 5), who thus claimed the overall Bouldering World Cup title. The third place in Munich and the second place overall went to Akiyo Noguchi (4T4z 7 6).\nMen.\n128 athletes attended the World Cup in Munich. The seasonal overall Bouldering title was decided after the semi-finals when Tomoa Narasaki failed to advance to the finals. Jernej Kruder thus secured the overall title regardless of his eventual finish in the Munich men's final. Gregor Vezonik (2T4z 2 13) won the competition with Kruder (2T3z 9 7) coming second and Jakob Schubert (2T3z 9 11) finishing in third place."

        "text": "This article covers cricket broadcasting rights. For a list of sports broadcasting rights by countries, see list of sports television broadcast contracts.\nIn certain countries international cricket rights are protected and must be broadcast live and free-to-air.\nProtected TV rights.\nIndia.\nThe content rights holder is required to share the feed with national broadcaster Doordarshan for \"Sports events of National importance\". Doordarshan can broadcast the game only on terrestrial TV and its own direct to home platform. They are not permitted to share these signals with cable operators and other DTH providers. As of 2017 all official one-day international, Twenty20 and test matches played by the Indian men's cricket team, semifinals and finals of the men's World Cup and International Cricket Council Championship Trophy are considered as cricketing events of “national importance”.\nAustralia.\nAn anti-siphoning list gives the free-to-air broadcasters the first right to negotiate. For cricket, it includes all Test matches Australia plays at home or in England, home ODIs and home T20 internationals. It also includes Australia's matches in the World Cup or World T20 when played at home, and the final of any tournament hosted in Australia or New Zealand.\nUnited Kingdom.\nTest matches involving the English national team and world cup matches involving home nations as well as semi-finals and finals are included in the category B list of the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events. Category B events are allowed to be broadcast on pay TV provided there is adequate secondary coverage in the form of highlights and delayed broadcasts.\nPrimary rights sale.\nVarious cricket boards and the ICC often sell the rights first to a primary broadcaster who may later resell those rights to other streaming or broadcast partners in territories where the original broadcaster has no presence. For example, Star Sports bought the global rights for IPL in all territories and all platforms from BCCI and later resold these rights to Sky Sports for the UK market."

        "title": "Tennessee Volunteers women's golf",
        "text": "The Tennessee Volunteers women's golf team represents the University of Tennessee located in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Vols compete at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Vols currently rotate between 16 different golf courses located in the state of Tennessee. The current coach for the Lady Volunteer's is Diana Cantu who began in 2022. Until the 2022 season, the Lady Vols had appeared in an NCAA regional every year since the program began in 1993, and they were one of only 9 NCAA Division 1 teams to compete in every NCAA regional since the championship’s format was established. Overall the Lady Vols have competed in 29 NCAA Regionals and 14 NCAA Championships. \nHistory.\nDespite the SEC beginning to sponsor women's golf in 1980-81, Tennessee did not sponsor the sport at the varsity level for 12 more years until 1992-93. The Lady Vols were the last team in the SEC to begin play except for Arkansas who had their first season in time for the 1995-96 season. All-time the Lady Vols are tied for 6th in the SEC (with Texas A&amp;M and Alabama) for most appearances (14) in the NCAA Championships behind Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Auburn, and LSU. Their best finish nationally came at the 2000 and 2015 NCAA Championships where both teams finished 5th overall. The program is one of only two at Tennessee (the other being women's tennis) to never win a conference title. The Lady Vols have finished 2nd three times at the SEC Championships (1993, 1999, 2006), and won two NCAA Regionals. They were one of only 9 nationwide to qualify for every NCAA Regional until they failed to do so in the 2022 season. Additionally, the women's golf team posted winning seasons each year from inception until 2013-14, and have only had 6 losing seasons ever. \nJudi Pavón era.\nJudi Pavón took over the helm of the Lady Vol golf team in 2000. She has led the team to 18 straight NCAA regional appearances and 11 appearances in the NCAA Championships. From (2004-2007) Pavón lead the Lady Vols to the final rounds of the NCAA Championships. One of the best seasons in program history was in 2005 when they won the 2005 NCAA West regional and finished 6th at the NCAA Championships. In the 2006 season they won the NCAA East regional and finshied tied for 13th at the NCAA Championships. The Lady Vols had another record setting season in 2015, when they finished 5th at the NCAA tournament tying a program record. They would return to the NCAA Championships in 2016 and in 2019. Pavon retired and was replaced by former Maryland head coach and lady-vol player from 2006-2010, Diana Cantú.\nDiana Cantú era.\nBefore coming to Tennessee, Cantú served as head coach of the Maryland Terrapins for seven seasons. There, she earned Big 10 coach of the year honors after taking the Terrapins to their best ever finish at the Big 10 Championships (2nd) and their first ever NCAA Championship appearance in 2021. In her first season as head coach (2021-2022), the Lady Vols struggled to a 41-95-2 record and an 8th place SEC finish. Despite advancing to match play for the first time at SECs, the year ended with the Lady Vols failing to qualify for NCAA Regionals for the first time in program history. In Cantú's second season at the helm, she led the Lady Vols to an 11th place finish at the SEC Championship and back to the NCAA Regionals as a #7 seed.\nYearly record.\nSources\nNational honors.\nThroughout the history of the Lady Vols golf program, 13 golfers have earned 29 All-America honors.\nIndividual honors.\n32 Lady Vols have garnered All-SEC honors throughout the women's golf history including two SEC Player of The Year awards and three Freshman of The Year awards.\nMack and Jonnie Day Golf Facility.\nAlthough the Vols men’s and women’s golf teams host their home matches at a variety of different courses in the state of Tennessee they have recently welcomed a new state of the art practice facility on campus where the team can practice all year round. The practice facility resides on a 28-acre lot across from the University's Medical Center and contains a 3-hole course plus putting green. The new facility opened in 2010 and was finished in 2019 with the Blackburn-Furrow Golf Clubhouse. The 8,300 square foot clubhouse features offices for both the men and women's teams, heated hitting bays for year-round practice, video training space, locker rooms, team lounges, over 1,200 square feet of outdoor deck spaces, and a virtual-putting green."

        "title": "Josh Green (basketball)",
        "text": "Joshua Benjamin Green (born 16 November 2000) is an Australian professional basketball player for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Arizona Wildcats.\nGreen was part of the Australian basketball team that won bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nEarly life.\nGreen was born in Sydney to Australian mother Cahla and American-born father Delmas. His parents met while both were playing semi-professional basketball in Australia. The couple decided to raise a family in the north-west Sydney suburb of Castle Hill where Josh began playing basketball at the age of five when his mother started coaching him. Along with playing local basketball for the Hills Hornets as a child, Green tried an array of sports as a junior and excelled in Australian rules football, athletics, basketball, rugby, soccer and swimming. By the age of 10, he had been selected to represent his home state of New South Wales in nine separate sports. In fifth grade, Green traveled more than 12 hours by car to the outback town of Broken Hill in an attempt to gain selection for the under-12 state basketball team and was told he was good enough to be on the team but would have to wait a year or two so the older boys could play. Twelve months later, he captained the under-12 NSW Metro state team to a national title. Green switched to play club basketball for Penrith in 2013 and the decision paid off when he was selected to represent the under-14 and under-16 New South Wales state teams in successive years as a bottom-ager.\nGreen was also a prodigious Australian rules footballer in his younger years while playing locally for the Westbrook Bulldogs and would regularly attend Sydney Swans home games with his father. Green claims to have \"loved\" playing Australian rules football and has \"always been a big Swans fan\", naming Adam Goodes and Lance Franklin as his favourite players growing up. Such was his talent in Australian rules football, the Swans and fellow professional football club Greater Western Sydney Giants offered him a place in their junior developmental academies. At the age of 13, Green accepted an offer to join the Giants' academy. However, in November 2014 the family relocated to Phoenix, Arizona for the father's work commitments and Green was subsequently forced to quit Australian rules football.\nHigh school career.\nWhile in Sydney, Green attended The King's School in Parramatta and dominated the local basketball scene so much that he was selected to represent the New South Wales' under 16 state team at the age of 13. Later that year, the Green family relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, and in 2015, Josh enrolled at Mountain Ridge High School, where he impressed. In 2017, he transferred to the IMG Academy in Florida and became a five-star draft prospect. In the final game of his high school career, Green led IMG to a national championship victory with a 65–55 win over La Lumiere and was subsequently named MVP of the championship game.\nHe was selected for the 2019 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, along with fellow UA recruit Nico Mannion.\nRecruiting.\nGreen received an offer to join the Villanova Wildcats in April 2018. In July 2018, he received an offer to join the North Carolina Tar Heels.\nGreen was considered a top player in the 2019 recruiting class by 247Sports, Rivals and ESPN. On 4 October 2018, Green committed to play for the Arizona Wildcats over Kansas, North Carolina, Villanova, USC and UNLV. Green is a consensus five-star prospect out of IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. In October 2018, Green signed his NLI to the University of Arizona for basketball.\nCollege career.\nIn his second college game, Green scored 20 points as Arizona beat Illinois 90–69. Green missed a game against UCLA on 29 February due to a lower back sprain. Green averaged 12.0 points, 4.6 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.5 steals per game for the Wildcats as a freshman while shooting 36.1% from three-point range. Following the season, he declared for the 2020 NBA draft.\nProfessional career.\nGreen was selected with the 18th pick in the 2020 NBA draft by the Dallas Mavericks. He signed his rookie scale contract with the Mavericks 30 November 2020. Green made his NBA debut on 23 December, scoring two points in a 106–102 loss to the Phoenix Suns. On 18 February 2021, Green received his first NBA G League assignment, to the Salt Lake City Stars. The Mavericks qualified for the postseason, but were eliminated in the first round by the Los Angeles Clippers. Green played four total minutes during the seven-game series.\nOn 19 October 2021, Mavericks picked up Green's option for another year until the 2022–23 season. On 27 December, after a stint in health and safety protocols, Green had a career-high 10 assists in a 132–117 win against the Portland Trail Blazers. On 7 January 2022, Green scored a season-high 17 points in a 130–106 win over the Houston Rockets. Two days later, he surpassed his season high by scoring 18 points in a 113–99 win over the Chicago Bulls. On 21 April 2022, during the Mavericks' first round playoff series against the Utah Jazz, Green recorded 12 points, three rebounds, six assists and two steals in a 126–118 game 3 win. The Mavericks won their first playoff series and reached the Western Conference Finals, both for the first time since 2011. However, they fell to the eventual champions, the Golden State Warriors, in five games.\nOn 20 November 2022, Green scored 23 points, alongside two rebounds, in a 98–97 loss to the Denver Nuggets. On 9 December, during a 106–105 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, he suffered an elbow injury. He missed twenty straight games before returning to the lineup on 18 January 2023, scoring nine points in a 130–122 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On 6 February 2023, Green scored a career-high 29 points in a 124–111 win over the Utah Jazz. \nOn October 23, 2023, Green signed a three-year, $41 million extension with the Mavericks.\nNational team career.\nGreen was named in the 24-man squad selected to represent the Australian national team in FIBA World Cup Qualifiers against Qatar and Kazakhstan in September 2018. However, a torn labrum in his right shoulder prevented him from making his international debut. In January 2019, Green revealed his ambitions to represent Australia at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. On 6 February 2019, Green was named in the 23-man squad selected to represent Australia's Under-19 national team at the 2019 FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup. In March 2019, Green signalled his aspiration to represent Australia at the 2019 FIBA World Cup. Green made his senior debut for Australia in the first round of the 2020 Olympics against Nigeria and helped his country obtain their first-ever Olympic medal in men's basketball, beating Slovenia in the bronze medal game.\nPersonal life.\nJosh Green is the son of Cahla and Delmas Green. His father played at Oregon Tech, while both of his parents played professionally in Australia. He has three siblings, one of whom, a brother, Jay, currently plays for the Northern Arizona Lumberjacks."

        "title": "Tamworth Rugby Union Sporting Club",
        "text": "The Tamworth Rugby Union Sporting Club is an amateur rugby union club in Tamworth, New South Wales, Australia.\nThe club fields three men's teams and one women's team in the New England Rugby Union (NERU), an affiliate of the New South Wales Country Rugby Union.\nOrigins.\nWithin only six years of the union code being properly established in England, the Tamworth Grammar School issued a challenge to the Armidale Grammar School in 1877 for a 12-a-side match. The Tamworth Grammar School renamed Tamworth College, continued to be a strong nursery of rugby union well into the 1900s.\nTwo years later, this had motivated the formation of the senior Arlington Club and Tamworth Club, with goalposts erected on The Oval (now Bicentennial Park). Two years later, this had motivated the formation of the senior Arlington Club and Tamworth Club, with goalposts erected on The Oval (now Bicentennial Park).\nIn 1880, a rugby game was played against the Maitland Albions.\nThe Tamworth Rugby Club appeared in the list of clubs that formed the New England Branch of the New South Wales Rugby Union. On 12 May 1880, the Armidale Football Club was formed to play games rugby rules. In 1882, Tamworth was listed as one of the 35 clubs subscribed to the Southern Rugby Union at their annual general meeting.\nIn 1891, the Newcastle Football Club played Tamworth with a scratch team, winning 10 points to 3, and a combined Armidale team won against a local Tamworth team by three points.\nBy 1893 there were club competitions involving Tamworth, Gunnedah, Quirindi, Werris Creek, Boggabri and Narrabri. The Tamworth-Acme Club lost 0–6 against a team from the newly-formed New England Rugby Union.\nIn 1892, NERU was formed, with a subsequent formation meeting in 1893. The Tamworth-based teams were Acme, Tamworth and Royal Standard. Rugby continued to be played around Tamworth and Armidale, with teams leaving and joining the competition.\nIn 1900, Tamworth passed a resolution at its annual meeting to leave NERU. The issue was that the local clubs had supported NERU for several years, but NERU had never scheduled a final match in Tamworth.\nIn 1901, West Tamworth won the NERU championship, defeating the Albions (Armidale) 8–0. In 1903, Central North (Tamworth) was formed. It applied to affiliate with the NSW Rugby Union.\nNorth Tamworth won the Central Northern Rugby Union Cup in 1903, 1904 (Murrurundi 11–0) and 1905 (Murrurundi 16–0).\nIn 1911, the East Tamworth Club wrote to Central North Rugby Football, stating it strongly resented the move of some players to the new code.\nIn 1912, East Tamworth won the premiership over Walcha in the last game of the season with a one-point victory. The West Tamworth Rugby Union team played Walcha for the Danahey Cup. In outlying villages Dungowan, Nemingha and Woolomin were union rivals, before changing to rugby league. The East Tamworth Rugby Union Football Club was very successful in the local Tamworth \"Observer Cup\" competition, winning the cup in 1909, 1910 and 1912. \nThe split and World War I.\nMany rugby union competitions dissolved for patriotic reasons and lack of numbers during World War I. An \"Inverell Times\" report on 24 April 1915 stated that the North West Rugby Football Union decided that anyone who was able to train for football should enlist and resolved to abandon all competition games. Numbers were lost to the war effort or to the rival league code. A meeting of rugby enthusiasts at Nail's Criterion Hotel on 16 June 1916 resurrected the CNRU. The Manly Rugby Club visited Tamworth later that month and played games against the Tamworth Union 15. In July, Tamworth and Manilla played a match with funds raised devoted to a local patriotic fund.\nThe league movement affected rugby with the annual general meeting notice for the New England Football Union of 1919, where consideration was made as to whether the union should cease its activities in favour of the league game.\nThe revival.\nAn advertisement was placed in the Northern Daily Leader calling a meeting to gauge interest in forming a new club. About a dozen people attended. All were fellows who had played rugby in other places, one of whom was former Gordon player Stan Blake. The 1951 meeting resolved to form the Tamworth Rugby Union Club.\nAn application was made to enter a team in the 1952 New England competition with the inaugural game against the Armidale City Rugby Club on 5 April 1952.\nThe first group of players was made up of former rugby players and players who had never played the game before. Many were employees of the NSW Department of Main Roads and the Bank of Australasia. Because most of the players had to work Saturday mornings, which would prevent them from travelling to away games, Jeff Jefferies, manager of the bank and the first president of the reformed club, gave Saturday mornings off to any man who played rugby. Ted Wood from the NSW Department of Main Roads did the same.\nThe club's first try was not scored until the 1953 season by Doug Schultz.\nBy 1954, player numbers had increased such that a second grade side was playing and in 1955 with Ian Sinclair as coach the first grade side won the New England competition at Armidale against Glen Innes. Sinclair had to play as two forwards were injured.\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, Tamworth Rugby hosted games at Tamworth's No. 1 oval. Touring teams included the Fijians in 1954, who won against New England 37–14. The British Lions beat Combined Country 27–14 in 1959.\nThe revived Central North zone evolved from the old Southern Zone in 1958 under the approval of the NSWRU. A meeting had been held in Tamworth in November 1955 to discuss the formation of a new Southern Zone competition in New England. A further meeting was called by the Tamworth club in November 1956 to discuss football arrangements for 1957. Many clubs were upset by the stop-start nature of the NERFU competition when University and Armidale Teachers College holiday breaks meant players were not available to field teams.\nTeams in the Tamworth-based competition had played in the southern zone of the NEFRU for several years. In early 1958, the Walcha, Tamworth, Gunnedah and Quirindi clubs applied to the NSW Rugby Union for recognition as the Central Northern Union. Despite some opposition the application was granted. During this time other towns now playing in Central North formed their own clubs, as well as the establishment of the Tamworth Pirates Rugby Club, who evolved out of the Tamworth Country based at Kootingal.\nThe 1960s and 1970s.\nIn 1969, the Fijian national team revisited the region and played the New England team in front of 7000 people at No.1 oval winning the game 37–14.\nThe standard of play in Central North began to improve in this period with the appearance of the first Australian Rugby Manual, and the arrival at Tamworth of some ex-Sydney Grade players in Bill Feggans (NSW Representative), Peter Horsefield and Vince Symons strengthened the ranks of players and later Coaches. However, the great Narrabri teams of the Seventies steam-rolled all before them in the competition.\nThe 1980s and 1990s.\nIn 2000, most of the successful players from the 1990s either retired or moved away from Tamworth and the club could only field one senior team.\nThe 2000s and 2010s.\nThe new clubhouse was built in 2010. Club member and secretary Julian Smith, an architect, prepared the design. For stage 1, funding for the change rooms came from selling the Tamworth Club. Stage 2 was funded by a $300,000 loan from the National Australia Bank and a $1,000 per year contribution from 30 donors for a 3-year period to help offset the interest.The Tamworth club had club match days with usually two senior matches and no junior games. After merger talks between the two zones failed, and after a 59-year absence, the Tamworth club decided to rejoin the New England Rugby Union in 2018.\nPremierships.\nPremierships:"

At 28 degrees Celsius, the race conditions were unusually hot and Hawkins suffered exhaustion and collapsed on the road. He briefly tried to continue but again collapsed, hitting his head on the road side barrier. As race rules dictate that medics need athlete permission to intervene (and thus end the athlete's participation), he was left on the roadside for several minutes in view of spectators as he did not request assistance. The games organisers received criticism for not responding sooner to the athlete's distress, though the organisers stated that they had reacted in accordance to competition regulations. Hawkins was kept overnight at Gold Coast University Hospital for review. Paul Bush, chair of Commonwealth Games Scotland, asked for a formal review of the situation and to see if changes could be made in future races to prevent such outcomes.\nEight of the 25 entrants failed to finish the race.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Games records were as follows:\nSchedule.\nThe schedule was as follows:\nResults.\nThe results were as follows:"

        "title": "2018–19 NCAA Division I women's basketball season",
        "text": "The 2018–19 NCAA Division I women's basketball season began in November 2018 and concluded with the Final Four title game at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida, in April 2019. Practices officially began in September 2018.\nConference membership changes.\nSix schools joined new conferences for the 2018–19 season. Four schools switched between Division I conferences for the 2018–19 season. In addition, two schools moved from Division II starting this season. The former Division II schools are ineligible for NCAA-sponsored postseason play until completing their D-I transitions in 2022.\nIn addition to the schools changing conferences, the 2018–19 season was the last for Savannah State in D-I with its decision to reclassify all of its sports to D-II.\nFinally, one D-I member adopted a new institutional and athletic identity. The 2017–18 school year was the last for Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) as a single institution. Following the school's split into separate institutions governed by Indiana University and Purdue University, IPFW degree programs in health sciences are now overseen by Indiana University Fort Wayne, while all other degree programs are governed by Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW). As noted in the \"Season headlines\" section, the IPFW athletic program, rebranded in 2016 as the Fort Wayne Mastodons, became the Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons, representing only PFW.\nArenas.\nArenas reopening.\nFour teams returned to newly renovated arenas, all of which were closed for the 2017–18 season.\nTemporary arenas.\nHouston began the 2018–19 season at Texas Southern's Health and Physical Education Arena, where the Cougars played most of their 2017–18 home games. The women played three home games at Texas Southern before moving into Fertitta Center.\nRobert Morris planned to open the new UPMC Events Center on the site of its former on-campus Sewall Center in January 2019, but the opening has now been delayed to that summer. Until the new arena opens, the Colonials will continue to use the Student Recreation and Fitness Center, a building in the school's North Athletic Complex that opened in September 2017 as part of the UPMC Events Center project.\nSeason outlook.\nPreseason polls.\nThe top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaches Polls.\nRegular season.\nUpsets.\nAn upset is a victory by an underdog team. In the context of NCAA Division I women's basketball, this generally constitutes an unranked team defeating a team currently ranked in the Top 25. This list will highlight those upsets of ranked teams by unranked teams as well as upsets of #1 teams. Rankings are from the AP poll.\nBold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"—i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes).\nConference winners and tournament winners.\nEach of the 32 Division I athletic conferences ends its regular season with a single-elimination tournament. The team with the best regular-season record in each conference is given the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers used as needed in the case of ties for the top seeding. The winners of these tournaments receive automatic invitations to the 2019 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nTournament upsets.\nFor this list, an \"upset\" is defined as a win by a team seeded 7 or more spots below its defeated opponent.\nAward winners.\nAll-America teams.\nThe NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the Associated Press (AP), the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), the \"Sporting News\", and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize \"Sporting News\" as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\nCoaching changes.\nSeveral teams changed coaches during and after the season."

        "title": "United States National Women's Rowing Team",
        "text": "The United States National Women’s Rowing Team is a select group of elite female athletes who represent the United States in international rowing competitions. The team first competed at the Olympics in 1976 and has had a multitude of successes. The implementation of Title IX during the 1970s had a large and positive impact on women’s collegiate rowing, and allowed for a growth in interest and talent in order for the creation of the national team. The team is selected through a competitive, in-depth process that is facilitated by USRowing each year. Tom Terhaar served as the national women’s head coach from 2001 until fall of 2021, and was a large part of the team's success in the past decade. The team’s eight (8+) won the gold medal at every summer Olympics between 2004 and 2016, finishing fourth at the 2021 Olympics. The US women's crew won every World Rowing Championships from 2005 through 2016. The eight (8+) also presently holds the world record at 5:54.160.\nHistory.\nThe first international race that included the United States women's rowing team took place at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Prior to that summer, the United States women's rowing team did not compete at an international level. Other countries, like Germany and Russia, had strong national teams, and were already pushing to be recognized in international competitions. The International Rowing Federation, or FISA, began recognizing European women's teams in international competitions, which led to women's rowing becoming an Olympic sport. The International Rowing Federation introduced a women's commission in 1969, with the primary focus being the allowance of women to row at the Olympics and World Championships. As a result of the commission, six women's boat categories were added to the 1974 World Rowing Championships. This addition created more momentum towards the approval and inclusion of women's races at the Olympics, and in 1976 the same six races were officially added to the Olympic Games. The races were initially 1000 meters, but the International Rowing Federation pushed to change the race to the standard 2000 meters that men raced. This change was also implemented in the Olympics. Today, the same six races at the standard 2000 meters are held at international competitions.\nTitle IX.\nIntroduction of Title IX.\nIn the 1970s, Title IX was implemented across college campuses in the United States. During this time women were seeking equal treatment in the world of athletics, specifically collegiate athletics. After the implementation of Title IX, collegiate athletic programs had to address the imbalance between men's and women's sports offerings and scholarships. Some elite colleges, like Yale University, already had women's rowing clubs or programs, but these programs were not receiving the same funding or school support as the men's rowing programs. In 1975 the women's rowing team at Yale University protested to the athletic department for equal funding and conditions, and drew national attention to their program and to the need for equality in women's collegiate sports. The women on this team had previously been forced to wait for their men's team to shower after practice, and were not provided with a locker room or usable showers themselves. They sat in on buses and waited, no matter what the weather conditions were. At the time, the women's team was trying to gain access to usable showers. Collegiate and national journalists were able to capture the protest and draw attention to it. The national spotlight on the women's crew program drew attention to the importance of equal treatment for both men's and women's collegiate sports teams.\nFor many colleges with large male athletic teams, like football programs, women's rowing was an easy addition. Women's collegiate rowing was added to the NCAA, and many universities began to add scholarships in order to attract women to the team. Rowing is unique in that many women who are highly competitive in other sports can also be very successful rowers. Women who had no prior rowing experience, but who may have been athletes prior to college, could now try to join growing programs and find success on a new team. Schools that had previously developed the reputation of having successful women's collegiate crew programs, like Harvard University, now had competition from large universities. Large schools were able to spend more money on the development of their women's rowing programs because they were also spending large amounts on their men's teams. This spread out the competition nationally, and eliminated the program divide between Ivy League schools and large public universities. Today, there are women's programs in all three divisions of the NCAA. Both private and public colleges competitively race, and the sport continues to grow in popularity.\nImpact of Title IX.\nThe development in women's collegiate crew programs directly impacted the success of the women's national team. Women's teams across the United States were becoming faster, and the talent pool for the national team began to grow. During the 1976 Summer Olympics, the women's team won a bronze medal. This was one of their first successful international races, and the women were determined to continue to develop and succeed on an international level. More and more collegiate athletes became hopeful that they could be selected for the national team, and the competition continued to increase. Today, thousands of women compete in high school, collegiate, and post-grad races. The growing popularity has allowed USRowing to add two additional national teams: the Under 23 National Team, and the Under 19 National Team. Both of these teams compete on national and international levels against athletes of the same age group and allow younger, developing athletes to compete at a high-level. Additionally, the teams help discover athletes who may be still developing, and who could later be selected for the senior national team. The senior team does not have an age limit, which makes it the most difficult to be selected for.\nTeam selection.\nEach year USRowing facilitates the team selection process for both the men's and women's senior national teams. This process is competitive and intense, but has assisted in the growth and success of the national programs. There are two ways to become a part of the senior national team for the United States: by winning certain races in small boats, or being invited to participate in selection camps.\nBecause rowing has so many different types of races and boats, it can be difficult to find the right athletes for certain spots on the team. The national team's smaller boats, and some of the boats without coxswains, are the winners of specific races such as... These two races (specify the races I would change it but I don't know which ones) are chosen by USRowing, and are typically the World Championship trials, National Selection regattas, and the FISA World Cups. Each year USRowing releases a document with the specific qualifications in order to be a part of the national team. The document can include specific placements in the selected races, or overall performances during the regattas. Typically, the winner of each race, and potentially a couple other places, are the selected groups to join the team.\nFor the more competitive races and bigger boats, like the women's 8+ and 4-, the athletes are chosen via the USRowing selection camp, which is an invitation-only event. The national team coaches distribute the invitations to athletes who meet a certain criteria that they set in collaboration with the USRowing organization. These criteria can include performance at identification camps, coach recommendations, performance in competition leading up to the present time, training performance, and other performances or recommendation-based qualities. If an athlete meets the qualifications, they are invited by the national coaches to the official selection camp. The coaches will then evaluate each athlete, and ensure that they are both compatible with the other athletes and capable of becoming a national team member.\nThese processes are also used for selecting the Under 23 and Under 19 national teams. The Under 23 team uses the Under 23 World Championship as a trial for boat eligibility, allowing each winning United States boat to be eligible for the team. The Under 19 team also has trial races, but only selects the single and double scullers and pairs from this race. Both the Under 23 and Under 19 teams have similar criteria in terms of recommendations, performance at national identification events, and overall ability for athletes chosen for the selection camps.\nCoaches.\nTom Terhaar.\nThe present senior national team head coach is Tom Terhaar. Terhaar was a rower himself, and competed at both the high school and collegiate levels for St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute Northeastern University, and Rutgers University. He began his coaching career as the men's lightweight coach for Columbia University, and transitioned to an assistant coach for the women's national team in 1994.\nIn 2001, Terhaar became head coach of USRowing. International competitors at this time had rigorous programs for their female rowers, with intensive training schedules and high expectations, but prior to Terhaar's promotion, the U.S. team had been practicing significantly less than their competition. Terhaar implemented a \"three-a-day\" practice schedule; one that is similar to the time demands of a full-time profession. Rowers had previously been expected to either sweep row or scull row in their training, but not both; however, Terhaar began training all of the rowers to be able to scull and sweep row. This allowed for the women to be more versatile in their rowing, and more flexible in terms of being in different boats. The switch in training approach, and increase in practices and intensity proved to be quite successful. Within the first year of Terhaar becoming head coach the team began to perform significantly better. Only a year after becoming head coach, Terhaar led the women to a gold medal at the world championships. At their first Olympics with Terhaar in 2004, the women's 8+ won a silver medal. Since the initial successes after Terhaar's promotion to head coach, the women have achieved many other significant accomplishments.\nRecent success.\nThe women's team has achieved major wins in many recent international races. In every Olympics since his joining the team, the women's 8+ has medaled, and other boats have medaled or placed. Their silver medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics was the first medal the team had won in years. During the world championship that year the women finished with a silver medal, but have proven themselves and won nearly every year since then.\nDuring the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, the women's 8+ won gold. In the 2012 Summer Olympics the women continued to prove themselves, and commanded another gold. During the 2016 Summer Olympics the team won the competition yet again, and finished with another gold, beating out Great Britain by a few seconds.\nThe women also have performed well at World Championships and been noted for their consistency. For over a decade, they have finished with medals and some of the fastest times in the world. Their first gold medal with Terhaar came during the 2006 world championships, and was a morale and confidence booster in terms of being able to achieve success. They continued to win gold at the world championships through 2016. In 2017, the women placed fourth; a shocking result in their decade-long winning streak.\nAnother of the team's notable performances includes their world record for the women's 8+. During the 2013 world championships, the 8+ broke their own world record for the 2000 meter race, with a time of 5:54.160. The United States also set the world record in 1994 for the women's lightweight 4-, with a time of 6:36.400. "

After spending five seasons in the Angels farm system, he made his major league debut in 2019. On September 4, 2021, Suárez threw the first complete game of his career. In 2022, he accumulated over 100 innings pitched for the first time in his major league career.\nCareer.\nSuárez signed with the Los Angeles Angels as an international free agent on July 3, 2014. He spent his first professional season in 2015 with the Dominican Summer League Angels and Arizona League Angels, compiling a combined 3-3 record and 2.97 ERA in 15 games (13 starts).

He started 2018 with the Inland Empire 66ers and was promoted to the Mobile BayBears and Salt Lake Bees during the season. In 26 starts between the three clubs, he pitched to a 3-6 record with 3.92 ERA.\nThe Angels added Suárez to their 40-man roster after the 2018 season. He opened the 2019 season on the injured list with shoulder soreness, and was assigned back to Salt Lake upon his return. On June 2, Suárez was promoted to the major leagues for the first time to start versus the Seattle Mariners, where he picked up his first major league win. He finished the season with a 7.11 ERA in 81 innings, allowing 23 home runs.

In a May 7 outing against the Texas Rangers, Suárez departed after innings (in which he allowed 7 earned runs) with an apparent injury. An MRI revealed a left shoulder strain, and he was placed on the injured list the following day. He was transferred to the 60-day injured list on June 23. Suárez was activated from the injured list on September 11."

        "title": "Tennis ball theorem",
        "text": "In geometry, the tennis ball theorem states that any smooth curve on the surface of a sphere that divides the sphere into two equal-area subsets without touching or crossing itself must have at least four inflection points, points at which the curve does not consistently bend to only one side of its tangent line.\nThe tennis ball theorem was first published under this name by Vladimir Arnold in 1994, and is often attributed to Arnold, but a closely related result appears earlier in a 1968 paper by Beniamino Segre, and the tennis ball theorem itself is a special case of a theorem in a 1977 paper by Joel L. Weiner. The name of the theorem comes from the standard shape of a tennis ball, whose seam forms a curve that meets the conditions of the theorem; the same kind of curve is also used for the seams on baseballs.\nThe tennis ball theorem can be generalized to any curve that is not contained in a closed hemisphere. A centrally symmetric curve on the sphere must have at least six inflection points. The theorem is analogous to the four-vertex theorem according to which any smooth closed plane curve has at least four points of extreme curvature.\nStatement.\nPrecisely, an inflection point of a doubly continuously differentiable (formula_1) curve on the surface of a sphere is a point formula_2 with the following property: let formula_3 be the connected component containing formula_2 of the intersection of the curve with its tangent great circle at formula_2. (For most curves formula_3 will just be formula_2 itself, but it could also be an arc of the great circle.) Then, for formula_2 to be an inflection point, every neighborhood of formula_3 must contain points of the curve that belong to both of the hemispheres separated by this great circle.\nThe theorem states that every formula_1 curve that partitions the sphere into two equal-area components has at least four inflection points in this sense.\nExamples.\nThe tennis ball and baseball seams can be modeled mathematically by a curve made of four semicircular arcs, with exactly four inflection points where pairs of these arcs meet.\nA great circle also bisects the sphere's surface, and has infinitely many inflection points, one at each point of the curve. However, the condition that the curve divide the sphere's surface area equally is a necessary part of the theorem. Other curves that do not divide the area equally, such as circles that are not great circles, may have no inflection points at all.\nProof by curve shortening.\nOne proof of the tennis ball theorem uses the curve-shortening flow, a process for continuously moving the points of the curve towards their local centers of curvature. Applying this flow to the given curve can be shown to preserve the smoothness and area-bisecting property of the curve. Additionally, as the curve flows, its number of inflection points never increases. This flow eventually causes the curve to transform into a great circle, and \nthe convergence to this circle can be approximated by a Fourier series. Because curve-shortening does not change any other great circle, the first term in this series is zero, and combining this with a theorem of Sturm on the number of zeros of Fourier series shows that, as the curve nears this great circle, it has at least four inflection points. Therefore, the original curve also has at least four inflection points.\nRelated theorems.\nA generalization of the tennis ball theorem applies to any simple smooth curve on the sphere that is not contained in a closed hemisphere. As in the original tennis ball theorem, such curves must have at least four inflection points. If a curve on the sphere is centrally symmetric, it must have at least six inflection points.\nA closely related theorem of also concerns simple closed spherical curves, on spheres embedded into three-dimensional space. If, for such a curve, formula_11 is any point of the three-dimensional convex hull of a smooth curve on the sphere that is not a vertex of the curve, then at least four points of the curve have osculating planes passing through formula_11. In particular, for a curve not contained in a hemisphere, this theorem can be applied with formula_11 at the center of the sphere. Every inflection point of a spherical curve has an osculating plane that passes through the center of the sphere, but this might also be true of some other points.\nThis theorem is analogous to the four-vertex theorem, that every smooth simple closed curve in the plane has four vertices (extreme points of curvature). It is also analogous to a theorem of August Ferdinand Möbius that every non-contractible smooth curve in the projective plane has at least three inflection points."

        "text": "The 2019 Indianapolis 500 (branded as the 103rd Running of the Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge for sponsorship reasons) was an IndyCar Series event held on Sunday, May 26, 2019, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. The premier event of the 2019 IndyCar Series, the event ran 500 miles (200 laps). Simon Pagenaud won the race from the pole position, earning Team Penske's record-extending 18th Indy 500 victory. Pagenaud led 116 laps, taking the lead for the final time with just over one lap to go from 2016 winner Alexander Rossi. He became the first French-born winner since Gaston Chevrolet in 1920, and the first pole-sitter to win the race since 2009.\nThe month of May activities formally began on May 11 with the IndyCar Grand Prix on the combined road course. Practice for the Indianapolis 500 began on Tuesday, May 14, and time trials were held May 18–19. Carb Day, the traditional final day of practice, as well as the annual Pit Stop Challenge and Indy Lights Freedom 100, were held May 24. Simon Pagenaud became the second driver in a row to sweep both the IndyCar Grand Prix and the Indy 500 in the same year. Pagenaud also won the pole position, the record-extending 18th Indy 500 pole for Team Penske.\nWill Power, the winner in 2018, entered the race as the defending champion. During the Last Row Shootout on May 19, former Formula 1 World Champion Fernando Alonso, attempting his second Indy 500, was bumped from the field, and failed to qualify.\nThis would be the final Indianapolis 500 held under the ownership of the Hulman/George family. On November 3, 2019, it was announced that Penske Entertainment Corp., a subsidiary of the Penske Corporation, owned by Roger Penske, had purchased the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the IndyCar Series, and IMS Productions. The sale was finalized in January 2020.\nRace background.\nTrack changes.\nA recycled polyethylene (RPE) binding agent was applied to the oval track surface; six drivers participated in an aero and tire test at the track in October 2018 following the application.\nQualifying changes.\nA revised qualifying procedure was announced, modifying the Two-day format utilized from 2014 to 2018. Qualifying will continue to be held over two days (Saturday, May 18 &amp; Sunday, May 19), but bumping will be moved back to Sunday. Both the familiar Fast Nine Shootout and a new Last Row Shootout will be held Sunday. Cars will continue to use the traditional four-lap qualifying attempts.\nOn Saturday, the procedure will be as follows:\nOn Sunday, time trials will conclude as follows:\n2019 IndyCar Series.\nFive different drivers won the first five races of the 2019 IndyCar Series season. Josef Newgarden won the season-opening race at St. Petersburg. Series rookie Colton Herta won the inaugural race at Circuit of the Americas, in doing so became the youngest driver ever to win an Indy car race. Takuma Sato then won the race at Birmingham, and Alexander Rossi won at Long Beach. The month of May opened with Simon Pagenaud winning the IndyCar Grand Prix, his first win since 2017 and third win in the event. Entering the Indianapolis 500, Josef Newgarden led the championship points standings.\nFor the first time since 2015, no oval races were held prior to Indianapolis.\nSponsorship.\nOn January 31, 2019, it was announced that the online financial services company Gainbridge would become the new presenting sponsor of the 500 under a four-year deal.\nEntry list.\nThe official entry list was released with 36 car/driver combinations. All chassis are , with Firestone tires. \nSchedule.\nAn open test on the oval was scheduled for and held April 24, 2019 followed by a private manufacturer's test on the combined road course on April 29.\nTesting.\nAugust 2018.\nOn August 6, 2018 a private test was conducted at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval by Firestone. Two teams, one each representing Chevrolet and Honda, participated. Team Penske with driver Will Power tested for Chevy, and Chip Ganassi Racing with driver Scott Dixon tested for Honda. The test was focused on further development to the universal aero kits which debuted in 2018. After some criticism during the 2018 race, improvements were made to the front wing endplate and underwing panels to address stability issues. Speeds were not announced, and no incidents were reported.\nOctober 2018.\nA series-conducted test was scheduled for October 17, 2018 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Six teams tested with six cars, further developing aerodynamic specifications for the universal aero kit as well as Firestone tires. In addition, the drivers were able to experience for the first time the performance of the Speedway's pavement, which was recently upgraded with an application of the asphalt binding agent Recycled Polyethylene (RPE).\nNo speeds were announced, and no incidents were reported. Following the test, the participants expressed that the track had more grip, and the new tire was more consistent than the compound used in 2018.\nOval test — Friday April 19.\nThree Indy 500 rookies took part in an oval acclimation test at Texas Motor Speedway on April 19. Ben Hanley, Colton Herta and Marcus Ericsson took part in the test, which was conducted by IndyCar officials. The test provided the drivers with high-speed oval experience prior to the start of the Rookie Orientation Program. Conditions were reported as windy, and no incidents were reported.\nTime trials.\nBump Day/Pole Day — Sunday May 19.\nLast Row Shootout.\nThe six cars that failed to qualify on Saturday participated in the Last Row Shootout. Each car was permitted one qualifying attempt to fill positions 31-32-33. The three remaining cars would fail to qualify. Rain delayed the start of the Last Row Shootout until 4:30 p.m. The teams had been permitted only a brief practice session Sunday morning before weather moved into the area.\nAfter struggling during practice, and after managing only 33rd on Saturday, Sage Karam set the fastest speed of the session. After crashing and failing to make the top 30 on Saturday, James Hinchcliffe also qualified solidly. Fernando Alonso of McLaren found himself sitting on the bubble with only one car remaining in line. Second-year driver Kyle Kaiser of Juncos Racing was the final driver to make an attempt. Going into the month, the sponsorship for the Juncos team fell through. They suffered a crash in practice on Friday, and ranked last after Saturday's qualifying session. With zero practice laps on the day, Kaiser dramatically bumped out Alonso by 0.0129 seconds to make the starting field. \nAll three cars that failed to qualify were associated with Carlin (the McLaren entry was affiliated with Carlin). Charlie Kimball was the only Carlin entry to make the starting field (he had qualified 20th the day before and as such was not involved in the session). Despite an adequate budget, McLaren's effort with Fernando Alonso was riddled with mistakes, missteps, unpreparedness, and in hindsight was described as a \"comedy of errors\". During a test session at Texas, the team discovered they did not have a steering wheel. Later, a series of electrical issues cut into much-needed practice time. When Alonso crashed his primary car during practice, his backup car was not available because the team had sent it back to the paint shop when they realized it had been painted the wrong shade of orange. The painting gaffe cost the team two days of track time. One practice run on Sunday was aborted when the team realized they had made errors in their chassis setups from converting from imperial to metric units.\nFirestone Fast Nine Shootout.\nTeam Penske won their record-extending 18th Indianapolis 500 pole position, as driver Simon Pagenaud took the top spot in the Fast Nine Shootout. Three-time polesitter Ed Carpenter was the third car out and set the pace early on with a four-lap average of 229.889 mph. Carpenter's fourth career pole, however, was not to be, as Pagenaud narrowly edged him out by 0.07 seconds. After a disappointing run by Will Power, which saw him drop from 2nd on Saturday to 6th on Sunday, Spencer Pigot was the last car with a chance for the pole. Pigot's first lap was quick, but his four-lap average dropped off and he qualified third. \nEd Carpenter Racing qualified 2nd-3rd-4th, one of the best combined time trials result for a three-car (or larger) race team. Penske Racing qualified 1st-2nd-3rd in 1988, and 1st-3rd-4th in 2010 and 2018. Andretti Autosport also qualified 2nd-3rd-4th in 2012-2013.\nBecause of the earlier rain, the scheduled practice after the Fast Nine Shootout was cancelled. \nPost-qualifying practice.\nPit Stop Challenge.\nThe annual Pit Stop Challenge was held on May 24 following the Freedom 100 Indy Lights race. Victory in the event went to Arrow Schmidt Peterson Motorsports with Marcus Ericsson's No. 7 car. The team bested Chip Ganassi Racing's No. 9 car in a best of three shoot-out. The victory marked the first time since 2004 that a team other than Chip Ganassi Racing or Team Penske had done so.\nStarting grid.\nFailed to qualify\n' = Indianapolis 500 rookie&lt;br&gt;' = Former Indianapolis 500 winner\nRace summary.\nFirst half.\nRace day saw a high temperature of with overcast skies for most of the race. Despite forecasts of thunderstorms throughout the day, the race was unaffected by precipitation. \nThe start saw Simon Pagenaud pull out to the lead, with Ed Carpenter and Will Power behind. The first green flag run was short lived, with the first caution period coming after just four laps, when Colton Herta came to a halt at the exit of turn 4; a gearbox failure causing a quick end to the rookie's race. Racing resumed on lap 10, with Power moving into second place ahead of Carpenter, with Spencer Pigot running fourth. This order would remain intact until the first stops of the race, which began at lap 32. After the stops, the top 3 remained the same, while Josef Newgarden moved to fourth. During the pit sequence, Hélio Castroneves and James Davison collided in the pit lane, resulting in Davison spinning. Castroneves was handed a drive-through penalty for the incident. At lap 54, Ben Hanley became the race's second retirement, as a broken halfshaft brought an end to the DragonSpeed car's day, though Hanley managed to bring the car back to pit lane without the need for a caution period.\nThe second round of stops came beginning at lap 62, though just before this, Carpenter managed to get back around Power for second. Scott Dixon led his first laps of the day during this period, having saved enough fuel to stay out until lap 71. During this pit sequence, Jordan King was involved in a pit lane incident where he slid long in his box at hit one of his tire changers; the crew member suffered a leg injury and was transported to a local hospital. Just as the pit sequence ended, the second caution of the day came, as Kyle Kaiser crashed his car in turn 4, ending the day for the Juncos Racing entry. During the caution, Power was moved to the back of the field as a penalty for hitting one of his pit crew members during his previous pit stop. The running order now ran Pagenaud, Carpenter, Alexander Rossi, Newgarden, and Sébastien Bourdais. \nRacing resumed at lap 78 with the running order remaining largely the same until the next round of pit stops, starting around lap 99. Rossi led his first laps of the day during the pit sequence after managing to stay out until lap 106, but a slower pit stop dropped him back behind Newgarden and Bourdais. Scott Dixon led again, staying out to lap 111.\nSecond half.\nDespite the slow stop, Alexander Rossi quickly climbed back up the order, and by lap 112 was in second place and fighting with leader Simon Pagenaud. The two remained close until the next round of stops, beginning at lap 128. Rossi suffered an even slower pit stop when he came in on lap 136 when the fuel nozzle failed to engage properly. Rossi was saved from falling well off the leader by the race's third caution flag. Behind Rossi, Marcus Ericsson spun coming into the pit lane, making contact with the wall with the nose of the car. Though Ericsson's car was not damaged enough to end his race, the car had stalled and needed retrieval, necessitating the caution period. Those who had not yet stopped, including Scott Dixon, were forced to pit during the caution, placing them behind those who had already stopped. As the field prepared for the next restart, the running order was Pagenaud, Carpenter, Newgarden, Bourdais, and Rossi.\nRacing resumed at lap 148. Soon after, Josef Newgarden passed Carpenter for second and then successfully stole the lead away from his teammate Pagenaud. Pagenaud elected to stay behind Newgarden for several laps in an effort to conserve fuel and make it to the end on only one more pit stop. This lasted until lap 168, when Pagenaud passed Newgarden back just before pitting again and triggering the final round of pit stops. During the sequence, Rossi was able to jump past both Newgarden and third place Ed Carpenter thanks to the advantage of an undercut. Soon after, Rossi passed Pagenaud for the virtual lead of the race while an off sequence Spencer Pigot led. Just as this happened, caution came for the fourth and final time of the day for a multi-pile up in turn 3. Graham Rahal and Sébastien Bourdais made contact entering the turn, causing them to crash. Behind them, Felix Rosenqvist, Zach Veach, and Charlie Kimball also lost control of their cars trying to avoid the incident. Of the five cars involved, Kimball was the only one able to continue on with the race. Scott Dixon also received minor damage in the incident. Due to the lengthy necessary clean up, the race was red flagged. Bourdais was deemed to be at fault for the incident, and was handed a 30-second avoidable contact penalty, relegating him to a 30th place finish, placed behind all other drivers involved in the crash.\nFinish.\nAfter roughly 18 minutes, cars returned to the track, with the top five following Pigot's pit stop being Rossi, Pagenaud, Carpenter, Newgarden, and Takuma Sato, who had finally recovered from trouble during his first pit stop. Racing resumed at lap 186, with Pagenaud immediately passing Rossi in turn 1 to reclaim the lead. The two exchanged places again the next lap before Pagenaud again reclaimed the lead, with the battle cooling down for a few laps. Behind them, Sato managed to pass both Carpenter and Newgarden, placing the former winner suddenly in contention for victory. With three laps to go, Rossi retook the lead of the race, but one lap later, Pagenaud moved back around Rossi with a pass into turn 3. Despite Rossi's efforts to reel him back in on the final lap, Pagenaud held on to take victory. The final margin of victory was 0.2 seconds, the seventh closest in the history of the race.\nPagenaud's victory marked the first time since 1920 that a French-born driver had won the race. It was the elusive first Indianapolis 500 win for longtime IndyCar sponsor John Menard Jr. It also marked the first time since 2009 that the pole sitter had won. For winning, Pagenaud earned $2,669,529 out of a total purse of $13,090,536. Rookie of the Year honors went to Santino Ferrucci, who finished seventh in his Indy 500 debut.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\n Points include qualification points from Time Trials, 1 point for leading a lap, and 2 points for most laps led.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nNBC televised the race in the United States, having assumed the broadcast rights as part of a new, three-year deal to televise the entire IndyCar Series, replacing ABC for the first time since 1965 (NBCSN held cable rights over the previous contract, but selected races, including the Indianapolis 500, were part of a separate package sold to ABC). The race was called by NBC's commentary team of Leigh Diffey, Townsend Bell, and Paul Tracy. Mike Tirico served as on-air host for pre-race coverage, joined by Danica Patrick and Dale Earnhardt Jr. as analysts. Dillon Welch, whose father was a former ESPN pit reporter for the Indianapolis 500, was also a reporter. \nPortions of pre-race activities were exclusive to NBC Sports Gold's \"IndyCar Pass\" subscription, including most practice sessions and all of the first day of qualifying with the final hour simulcast by NBCSN along with the entirety of Carb Day also simulcast. Bump and Pole Day were exclusive to NBCSN; while NBC had a scheduled window, the session was delayed due to rain, and NBC had commitments to air an NHL playoff game. The season-long broadcast team of Jake Query, Anders Krohn, and Katie Hargitt covered the Indy Lights Freedom 100. NBCSN broadcast a two-hour pre-race show and a one-hour post-race show on race day.\nThe 2019 Indianapolis 500 saw an average of 5.4 million viewers, and a 3.9 overnight rating—a 15% increase over the 2018 edition (which was the least-viewed 500 since the introduction of live flag-to-flag coverage). \nRadio.\nThe race was carried by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. Mark Jaynes served as the chief announcer or \"Voice of the 500\" for the fourth consecutive year. For 2019, the booth announcers moved to a new location. The IMS Radio Network took over the studio formerly occupied by ABC television, on the second floor of the Pagoda renamed the Sid Collins Booth. NBC took over the booth high atop the Pagoda which the radio crew used to utilize. As a result, the chief announcer no longer had a clear view of turn one, and the separate turn one announcer (which was left vacant multiple times in the past several years) was brought back once again. Nick Yeoman took the prestigious turn one reporting location, as Jerry Baker was now permanently retired from the crew but was working with the public address department.\n1070 The Fan broadcast nightly with \"Trackside with Curt Cavin and Kevin Lee\", followed by Donald Davidson's \"The Talk of Gasoline Alley\"."

        "title": "Tour Championship (snooker)",
        "text": "The Tour Championship is a professional snooker tournament first held in 2019. The event features the twelve (previously eight) highest ranked players on the one-year ranking list, which reflects prize money won at ranking events since the beginning of the season. The Tour Championship is the third and final tournament in the Players Series, following the World Grand Prix and the Players Championship. The event features a prize fund of £380,000, with the winner receiving £150,000. The tournament is broadcast by ITV Sport in the United Kingdom and Eurosport across the rest of Europe. The reigning champion is Mark Williams, who won the 2024 Tour Championship with a 10–5 win over Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final.\nHistory.\nThe tournament was announced in April 2018, and was scheduled to be played for the first time in March 2019. The event was organised as the third and final event to make up the Coral Cup (now Players Series), tournaments sponsored by bookmakers Coral which use the rankings exclusively from the season prior. The tournaments in the Cup featured declining player entries, with the first event, the World Grand Prix having 32 participants, and the Players Championship 16. The Tour Championship is the tournament with the lowest number of entries of any tournament on the calendar, with just eight participants. The tournament is broadcast by ITV4 in the United Kingdom, Eurosport across Europe. The event also airs on Sky Sport in New Zealand, NowTV in Hong Kong, and Superstars Online in China.\nThe first edition of the tournament was played in 2019 at Venue Cymru in Llandudno, Wales after the Players Championship was moved from Llandudno to Preston in 2019. The 2019 Tour Championship was the first event since the 2010 UK Championship (and other than the World Snooker Championship) in which every match was played over multiple , with two in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, and three sessions in the final. The best-of-25-frames final, held on 23 and 24 March, was the first non-World Championship match of this length or longer since the 1992 UK Championship final. The 2019 final was played between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Neil Robertson, who had also met in the Players Championship final two weeks prior. O'Sullivan lead 5–3 after the first session and later won the match and the tournament 13–11. The win also gave O'Sullivan the Coral Cup for the 2018–19 season.\nThe 2020 Tour Championship was moved in both date and location due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Matches were also shortened with all matches being either best-of-17 or best-of-19 frame matches. It was originally organised to be played from 17 to 22 March 2020 but on the morning of the first day, it was postponed. On 5 June 2020, the tournament was rescheduled to be held between 20 and 26 June 2020 and moved to a different venue, the Marshall Arena in Milton Keynes, England. Due to the pandemic, Ding Junhui was unable to participate, and was replaced by Stephen Maguire. Maguire reached the final, where he defeated Mark Allen 10–6 in the final, to win his first ranking title since the 2013 Welsh Open.\nThe 2021 event was also held with no live audience but was held at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales with all matches as the best-of-19 frames. Defending champion Maguire did not qualify for the event, having not scored enough ranking points during the season. The final was between the two players who contested the 2019 event, Robertson and O'Sullivan. Robertson won the event with a 10–4 win in the final. O'Sullivan commented he could not compete with Robertson's performance, saying \"I've never seen anyone play as well as that.\"\nThe tournament, along with the other tournaments in the Players Series, was sponsored by Duelbits in 2023. Johnstone's Paint sponsored the 2024 event."

        "title": "2018 cricket pitch fixing and betting scandal",
        "text": "The 2018 Cricket Pitch Fixing scandal refers to the alleged doctoring of the pitch, a central strip of the playing field, in the home test matches of the Sri Lankan cricket team at the Galle International Stadium, as well as during the home test matches of the Indian cricket team.\nRevelation.\nRevealed by Al Jazeera, a documentary claimed that the groundsmen at these matches deliberately altered the nature of the pitch in order to produce results that favored the home team. The news reports claimed that two of the four-pitch fixing offenses occurred in Galle, with the groundsmen at Chennai being accused of pitch-fixing charges after hosting the final Test Match of the series between India and England in 2016.\nOn 29 May 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) criticized Al Jazeera for failing to share conclusive evidence of pitch-fixing before broadcasting the documentary regarding the match-fixing allegations. Critics also speculated whether the Al Jazeera news network deliberately revealed false allegations, citing that Al Jazeera's findings may have been edited and modified before releasing its documentary film. However, on 26 May 2018, a shocking development revealed that the curator of Galle International Stadium, Tharanga Indika, had indeed been involved in the operation, with the discovery of camera footage linking him to the scandal. Indika subsequently admitted to doctoring the pitch to manipulate match outcomes. The match-fixing issue remains under investigation by the ICC.\nThe Al Jazeera news network has continuously refused to provide the pitch-fixing related evidence to the ICC stating that the lives of journalists are at risk. In July 2018, Australian cricketer Glenn Maxwell was indirectly accused by Al Jazeera's documentary as a chief suspect in the possible match-fixing allegations during the third Test match held between India and Australia which happened at Ranchi, a match where Maxwell recorded his maiden test century. Maxwell denied all of the allegations leveled against him and replied that he didn't have any need to do such a thing to spoil the moment of cricket.\nBackground.\nThe pitch tampering incident involving both India and Sri Lanka is a developing controversy in international cricket following the 2018 Australian ball-tampering scandal.\nMatch fixing scandals in Sri Lanka have flared up in recent times, including alleged misconduct during a domestic first class cricket match between Panadura Cricket Club and Kalutara Physical Culture Club in 2017 with Chamara Silva who was the captain of the Panadura Cricket Club and Manoj Deshapriya being caught and banned by SLC for a certain period for being named in corruption allegations. Manoj Deshapriya, the captain of the Kalutara Physical Culture Club was also found guilty of match-fixing after the unusual scoring rate by Panadura side in a first class cricket match held in January 2017.\nThe match-fixing probe which has raised questions about the legitimacy of test cricket results was revealed by Al Jazeera just a few days after the announcement was made by the ICC that they were scrapping the traditional method of a coin toss in Test cricket matches to determine who would bat or bowl first. With regards to the match-fixing probe, the ICC cited that the host nation had been accused and found guilty of changing the pitch conditions to suit themselves in these longer format games.\nThe ICC also introduced a new rule on banning the use of smart watches and other electronic appliances on the field during play and in dressing rooms. The ICC called a ban on smart watches to avoid possible match fixing by implementing the new rule with immediate effect during the test series between England and Pakistan in 2018 barring the Pakistani players from wearing the smart watches during the first test.\nDevelopment.\nRobin Morris, a professional cricketer from Mumbai, was suspected by the ICC of playing a major role in match fixing during Sri Lanka home Test series against both Australia in 2016 and against India in 2017.\nThe Al Jazeera news channel allegedly discovered that the groundsman of the Galle International Stadium and Robin Morris had planned to fix the 1st test match between England and Sri Lanka held in Galle. Robin Morris told the under cover reporters that he bribed the groundsman to monitor and alter the conditions of the pitch in order to guarantee certain outcomes. Al Jazeera's documentary \"Cricket's Match-Fixers\" has identified the groundsman and Robin Morris along with another Sri Lankan, Tharindu Mendis, for planning to alter the pitch conditions. Al Jazeera also stated that it would telecast the documentary. The ICC has launched an investigation into the Al Jazeera's findings about the pitch tampering issue. The ICC has also asked for the evidence and relevant material from Al Jazeera.\nMeanwhile, Al Jazeera has also claimed that two more Sri Lankans including former Sri Lankan national cricketers Jeevantha Kulatunga and Dilhara Lokuhettige were involved in a match fixing controversy during a T-20 series in the United Arab Emirates. However, in a press release on 28 May 2018, Jeevantha Kulatunga has declined the allegations made by Al Jazeera.\nThe Pakistani first-class cricketer, Hasan Raza, who did not take part in the conversation with Robin Morris, Tharanga Indika, and Tharindu Mendis, according to the Al Jazeera documentary, has also been identified as the suspect linked to the fixing scandal. He is seen seated near Robin Morris (who he played with during his time at the Mumbai Champs team in the Indian Cricket League) in the Al Jazeera documentary. However, Hasan Raza denied the allegations made against him and replied that his name was unnecessarily dragged into the match-fixing controversy.\nThe groundsman of the Galle International Stadium who is also the assistant manager of the stadium gave a statement to Al Jazeera that he can manage pitches in such a way that it would favour either batsmen or bowlers.\nThe Al Jazeera's Investigation Unit also revealed that Hasan Raza, Jeevantha Kulatunga, and Dilhara Lokuhettige were preparing to make money by organizing and arranging a fake tournament in the UAE solely to make a huge collection of money to fix matches in the future. Al Jazeera also claimed that another businessman from India, Aneel Munawar, who also has close connections with crime boss Dawood Ibrahim is assumed to have dealt with a few international cricketers so as to have them underperform on the international cricket level by giving them huge bribes. Al Jazeera also released photographs which were taken in Sri Lanka's Cinnamon Grand Colombo related to Aneel Munawar, who was standing just some distance away from the former English cricketers, Tim Bresnan and Graeme Swann. Both of them were part of the England's squad at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 which was held in Sri Lanka.\nIt was also later identified that the former Secretary of the Galle District Cricket Association, Halambage Premasiri, who was shot dead in 2016 along with his son was also subsequently revealed to have connections regarding Galle pitch fixing. It was evident that Al Jazeera started investigations on pitch tampering incident just before the planned murder of Halambage Premasiri, which still remains a mystery.\nWest Indies v Sri Lanka 2018.\nConsidering the pitch fixing allegations probed by Al Jazeera-based mainly on Sri Lanka, apparent ball-tampering allegations were made by the match officials and umpires against the Sri Lankan team during their test series against the West Indies. Prior to the start of Day 3 of the second test match, the Sri Lankan cricket team marched protests against umpires' decision on starting the third day's play with a new ball, thereby replacing the old ball. The Sri Lankan cricket team, led by Dinesh Chandimal, refused to take the field on the third day of the test match after showing his disagreement on change of the ball, causing an hour delay to the start of the day after the apparent ball-tampering allegations made by the umpires.\nChandimal was found to be guilty of making ball tampering incidence. Video evidence indicated that on the second day's play, Chandimal was taking sweets out from his left pocket, putting them in his mouth, and applying saliva to the ball within the space of a few seconds. Two on-field umpires Ian Gould, Aleem Dar, television umpire Richard Kettleborough, and match referee Javagal Srinath observed the incidence carefully and charged him with one Test ban and two demerit points.\nAt the end of the match, the hearing with match referee Javagal Srinath, his team management, and other match officials took place with Chandimal and he wasn't able to recall what it was in his mouth when he polished the ball with saliva. As a result, match referee handed Chandimal the maximum punishment available under the ICC Code of Conduct, which was two suspension points and a fine of 100% of his match fee.\nHowever, before finishing the match, Chandimal pleaded not guilty for the ball tampering incidence and this caused trouble at the start of Day 3 test match. The conflict started in the morning, where two umpires asked to change the ball used in the previous day with a new ball. Sri Lankan players did not accept that and refused to go into the field for the match. The incidence got worse when coach Chandika Hathurusinghe and manager Asanka Gurusinha also got involved with the match referee and umpires. Over the next two hours, several animated discussions took place between management and cricket officials.\nWith that, Srinath took a decision and asked Sri Lanka to take the field before 11:30 am (the scheduled start had been 9:30), or forfeit the game. Players finally agreed to play the match \"under protest\". The Match referee awarded West Indies five penalty runs in the match after the incident.\nOn 11 July 2018, ICC concluded its hearing on the trio, who had pleaded guilty to a level-three spirit of cricket offense. His hearing took place before the start of the first Test match against South Africa, and he was found guilty. He received a two-match ban, with Suranga Lakmal captaining the side in his place. On 16 July 2018, independent Judicial Commissioner handed down a further eight suspension points with maximum possible punishment for their spirit of cricket offense and suspension for four ODIs as well.\nPostponement of 2018 Lanka Premier League.\nThe scheduled inaugural edition of the Lankan Premier League which was supposed to be held in August 2018 was indefinitely postponed as a result of the change in country's cricket administration. This was also assumed to have been postponed due to Al Jazeera's claims on match fixing probe in Sri Lanka.\nGalle pitch fixing.\nThe groundsman, Tharanga Indika, who is in-charge of the cricket ground was found guilty for helping the bookmakers to engage in match-fixing after allowing them to doctor the pitch conditions. The allegations were revealed by the Al Jazeera news network which filmed both the groundsman and the other match fixers on their targets of match-fixing.\nRobin Morris was intended to have influenced in fixing allegations relating to Sri Lankan home matches for attempting pitch tampering by the ICC during Sri Lanka's 2nd test match against Australia in Galle and Sri Lanka's 1st test match against India in Galle. Morris was reported to have given bribes to groundsman, Tharanga Indika, who works as the groundsman at the Galle International Stadium to monitor the pitch conditions in those two home matches played by Sri Lanka against Australia in 2016 and India in 2017, and was noticed to have earned from betting after analyzing the Galle pitch conditions. However, he denied all of the allegations against him, as revealed by Al Jazeera. He later revealed that he didn't place money for betting after analyzing the Galle pitch conditions in 2016 and 2017.\nOn 30 May 2018, the SLC said that a new pitch was formed replacing the pitch referred by Al Jazeera in its documentary film.\nSri Lanka v Australia 2016.\nRobin Morris explained that the Galle pitch was prepared in favour of the bowlers of the Sri Lankan cricket team during the 2nd test against Australia in 2016 where Sri Lanka managed to win the match by a massive margin of 229 runs. Australia lost all 20 wickets within 3 days and batting 501 balls. The groundsman said that the Galle wicket for the Australian test was prepared deliberately for the bowlers by preparing the pitch poorly without using a roller. He also ensured the bookmakers that the five-day test match would finish within three days rather than end in a draw. After knowing about the pitch conditions, the match-fixers made money by betting that the match would not end in a draw. The Australian cricket team also raised concerns over the pitch conditions at the time of the test match as they felt that the pitch didn't help the batters. Australian players including Steve Smith, David Warner, and Nathan Lyon complained to the match officials about the poor pitch conditions after a thrashing loss to Sri Lanka.\nSri Lanka v India 2017.\nThe Galle pitch for the Indian test was said to be prepared as batsmen friendly pitch where India piled up big first innings score of over 600 in the first innings, and also piled up 240 runs for the loss of only 3 wickets to demolish Sri Lanka and win the match. It was evident that Sri Lanka was restricted under 300 runs in both the innings and lost the match by 304 runs.\nSri Lanka v England 2018.\nRobin Morris, along with Dubai based business person Gaurav Rajkumar, Galle groundsman Tharanga Indika, and Sri Lankan first-class cricketer Tharindu Mendis have also been investigated by the ICC for attempting another pitch tampering at Galle in Sri Lanka's first test match against England as part of the England's series against Sri Lanka in November 2018. Concerns were raised by the English Cricket Board whether to play the series against Sri Lanka over the planned pitch tampering at the Galle Cricket Stadium for the first Test match or not.\nPitch fixing in India.\nIndia v England 2016.\nThe 5th and the final test match between England and India which was held in Chennai with India winning the match by an innings and 75 runs has been accused by Al Jazeera as the findings prove that the certain sessions of the test match may have been fixed by bookmakers. India posted a mammoth total of 759/7 with Karun Nair scoring a triple century in the 2nd innings of the match. The English cricket coach, Trevor Bayliss, denied Al Jazeera's allegations. He stated that the allegations are outrageous and he knew that such a documentary would be showcased in future. English skipper Joe Root also criticized and branded the match-fixing allegations against India in 2016 as ridiculous.\nResponse.\nSri Lanka Cricket.\nIn a media release on 26 May 2018, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced that it would cooperate with any kind of investigation undertaken by the ICC following the allegations. The current President of the Sri Lanka Cricket, Thilanga Sumathipala, announced that independent groundsmen would, with immediate effect, be appointed in the future to supervise ground preparation. Sri Lanka Cricket suspended Tharindu Mendis and Tharanga Indika with immediate effect, and reported the case to the Criminal Investigation Department of Sri Lanka.\nIn a press meet, the SLC vice-president Mohan de Silva commented that he and the SLC were finding it difficult to believe any of the allegations mounted by Al Jazeera on the Galle fixing scandal.\nThe SLC also refuted some of the allegations made by Al Jazeera, claiming that it is not a strange thing to prepare a turning bouncy track in Galle for test matches. The SLC defended Al Jazeera's claims on preparing a spin-friendly turning pitch to favour the spin bowlers during the 2016 Galle test match between Sri Lanka and Australia where Australia lost 18 out of the 20 wickets to Sri Lankan spinners in the Galle test. The SLC also reacted negatively to the documentary's claims on pointing out the involvement of the Galle groundsman, stating that the person didn't have any authoritative powers to alter the conditions of the pitch.\nThe SLC later revealed that the future test matches scheduled against England and South African cricket team at the Galle cricket stadium in 2018 would be shifted to other cricket grounds following the controversy. However, SLC planned not to shift the matches from Galle due to the unavailability of other cricket grounds to host test matches.\nDuring the renovations, another problem emerged that threatened to stop the construction. One of the new buildings being constructed blocked the view of the adjacent fort, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Galle Heritage Foundation and some other organisations expressed concern over this, pointing out that this may result in the fort being removed from the UNESCO world heritage sites. This issue was later resolved and the construction re-continued after some time.\nPostponement of SLC Elections.\nThe corruption allegations revolving around the SLC Board and the breakout of the pitch fixing scandal has ultimately led a stay order against conducting the SLC Board elections, scheduled to be held on 31 May 2018. The Court of Appeal issued a stay order against holding elections for the SLC until 14 June after a petition filed by Arjuna Ranatunga's younger brother, Nishantha Ranatunga, against Thilanga Sumathipala from contesting in the elections.\nFormer Sri Lankan world cup winning captain, Arjuna Ranatunga, also condemned and blamed the corruption allegations linking SLC Board and the president of the Board, Thilanga Sumathipala, while criticising the ICC's anti-corruption investigation unit for not taking proper actions against corruption allegations after referring to Al Jazeera's findings on alleged spot-fixing row.\nPrior to the scheduled SLC elections, the actor and politician, Ranjan Ramanayake, criticized the SLC elections as illegal and called Thilanga Sumathipala as a well known bookmaker.\nSri Lankan government.\nThe Sri Lankan government also requested SLC to inquire into the pitch fixing probe which has damaged the reputation of the history of cricket in Sri Lanka. The newly appointed Sri Lankan sports minister, Faiszer Musthapha, said that he watched the Al Jazeera documentary and told the reporters that he wrote a letter to the SLC on addressing the issue to the CID of Sri Lanka.\nBoard of Control for Cricket in India.\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) stated that it would take necessary actions against Robin Morris who is accused as the main suspect of the match fixing allegations. The BCCI announced that they will take legal actions against him only if he is found guilty in the ongoing investigations conducted by the ICC on corruption charges.\nPakistan Cricket Board.\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has commenced investigations on the influence of cricketer Hasan Raza over the alleged betting scandal and told that appropriate sanctions would be imposed on him if he is found guilty of being involved in corruption allegations. PCB contacted Hasan Raza and had been reviewing reports whether the disgraced cricketer took part in the spot-fixing allegations. The PCB banned Hasan Raza to take part in the 2018–19 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy.\nCricket Australia.\nFollowing the release of Al Jazeera's documentary, the CEO of the Cricket Australia, James Sutherland stated that he is not aware of any credible evidence linking the Australian cricket players in connection to the suspected match-fixing allegations in the fourth and the final test match between India and Australia in 2016.\nThe interim Australian test captain, Tim Paine, uttered that he is confident of the current situation of the Australian cricket team and responded that none of the Australian players would have been involved in such a match-fixing controversy after suffering from a major Australian ball-tampering scandal in March 2018.\nDespite Cricket Australia denying any wrongdoing by its team, Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell was reported by Al Jazeera to have been possibly involved in a match-fixing affair without mentioning his name directly in its documentary film. These accusations were, however, refused by the cricketer himself, and both Cricket Australia and Maxwell went on to say that it was just an act to target him unnecessarily and an attempt to spoil his moment after scoring his first test century against India in the Ranchi test, a match which was suspected by Al Jazeera in its documentary.\nEngland and Wales Cricket Board.\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) denied the match-fixing allegations reported by Al Jazeera during the final test match of England's test tour in India which was held in Chennai. Former English captain, Michael Atherton, claimed that the allegations made by Al-Jazeera regarding the Australian and English cricketers are ridiculous."

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, FIFA announced on 3 April 2020 that the tournament would be postponed and rescheduled. On 12 May 2020, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held between 20 January – 6 February 2021, subject to further monitoring. In July 2020, due to COVID-19 concerns with the highest cases and deaths of all Central America, Panama backed out from co-hosting leaving Costa Rica the solo host.\nOn 17 November 2020, FIFA announced that the 2020 edition of the tournament would be cancelled. Instead, Costa Rica were appointed as hosts of the next edition of the tournament in 2022.\nJapan were the defending champions, having won their first title in 2018.\nHost selection.\nFirst round of bidding.\nOn 25 July 2018, FIFA announced that bidding process had begun for the 2020 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup and the 2020 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. A member association was able to bid for both tournaments, with the caveat that two different hosts would be appointed. The following associations declared interest in hosting the event by the deadline of 12 September 2018.\nWhen India was appointed as the host of the U-17 Women's World Cup, they were then no longer eligible to be selected as host of the 2020 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.\nSecond round of bidding.\nAfter India and South Korea withdrew their bids, the bid process was reopened. Nigeria was considered to be in the running, with FIFA expected to conduct an inspection tour in August.\nIn a meeting held with Carlos Alvarado Quesada (the President of Costa Rica), Rodolfo Villalobos (the president of the Costa Rican Football Federation), Gianni Infantino said \"We raised the possibility that Costa Rica and Panama will host the FIFA Women's Under 20 World Cup in September 2020 and we have had a good reception of the news\".\nOn 20 December 2019, FIFA announced that Costa Rica and Panama would host the tournament in August 2020.\nQualified teams.\nA total of 16 teams would have qualified for the final tournament. In addition to Costa Rica who would have automatically qualified as host, 15 teams would have qualified from six continental competitions.

        "text": "GAM Esports is a professional \"League of Legends\" team competing in the Vietnam Championship Series (VCS), the highest level of competitive \"League of Legends\" in Vietnam. The team first rose to international prominence in 2017, after their exceptional performance at that year's Mid-Season Invitational (MSI).\nHistory.\n2014.\nThe team was founded in May 2014 after companies Tt Esports and Boba Net began a sponsorship with Team Miracle, which renamed to the Boba Marines five months later. During the 2014 VCS Summer Split, the team played as Tt Miracle Boba and finished the split in eight place with a 3–4 record. However, they were able to avoid relegation after the addition of former Saigon Jokers support and World Championship participant Junie.\n2015.\nFor the 2015 season, Archie, GoNy, and QTV rejoined their former teammates after leaving the Saigon Jokers, and the team renamed to the Boba Marines. The Marines failed to qualify for the spring split of the 2015 Garena Pro League (GPL), but did qualify for the summer split after finishing third in the 2015 VCS Spring Split. During the mid-season, the Marines replaced their mid laner Navy with Optimus from Saigon Fantastic Five. Despite showing improvement and winning the 2015 VCS Summer Split, the Marines were unable to win the 2015 GPL Summer Split.\n2016.\nIn 2016, the Marines finished third in the 2016 VCS Spring Split and fourth in the 2016 Mountain Dew Championship Series Summer Split (MDCS; i.e. VCS). The GPL also changed their qualification guidelines so that only champions of regional SEA tournaments could participate, meaning the Marines were unable to participate in GPL 2016.\n2017.\nBefore the 2017 season, the Marines' management made the decision to release their entire roster excluding Optimus and Archie. Afterwards, star players Ren, Levi, Slay, and Sergh joined the Marines as top, jungle, AD carry, and substitute support respectively. Tinikun also joined as head coach. The team received new sponsors, Gigabyte Technology and Adonis Icyber Gaming, and renamed to Marine Esports. As the GIGABYTE Marines, the team won the 2017 MDCS Spring Split and the 2017 GPL Spring Split without losing a single game, qualifying them for the 2017 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI).\nAt MSI 2017, the Marines finished the first round of the play-in group stage with a 5–1 record, only losing to Virtus.pro. In the second round, the Marines won the first two games of a best-of-five against Team SoloMid, before being reverse swept and losing 2–3. In the third and last qualifying round, the Marines beat SuperMassive eSports 3–1 to secure a spot in the main event. At the main event of MSI 2017 the Marines finished last in sixth place, with a 3–7 record. Despite their placement, the Marines' performance secured Vietnam a guaranteed group stage seed at the 2017 World Championships and an additional spot in the GPL.\nThe Marines were placed in Group B at the 2017 Worlds Championships, where they initially tied for second with Fnatic and Immortals, but had the highest seed going into the tiebreaker matches due to them having the shortest combined victory time. However, the Marines lost their tiebreaker match to Fnatic and did not advance to the knockout stage.\nShortly after the 2017 World Championships, Slay and Stark both announced they would be leaving the team. Optimus left the team post-season on 16 October 2017 and Levi joined American team 100 Thieves on 26 December 2017.\n2018.\nThe Marines finished third in the 2018 VCS Spring Split regular season with 9 wins and 5 losses, qualifying for playoffs, where they defeated Young Generation 3–1 in the quarterfinals and UTM Esports 3–1 in the semifinals. The Marines then played in the finals against EVOS Esports, narrowly losing to them 2–3.\nOn 14 June 2018, the team officially renamed to GAM Esports due to sponsorship changes. GAM then placed fifth in the 2018 VCS Summer Split with 8 wins and 6 losses.\n2019.\nIn spring 2019, GAM Esports missed out on playoffs for the second time, finishing in fifth place with 6 wins and 8 losses. Levi rejoined the team from JD Gaming on 14 May 2019 for the 2019 VCS Summer Split. The Marines ended the summer regular season in first place with an 11–3 record, qualifying for playoffs once again. In the semifinals they swept Lowkey Esports 3–0, moving on to face Team Flash in the grand finals, who they beat in a 3-0 fashion. GAM Esports qualified for the 2019 World Championship, where they were placed in group B alongside FunPlus Phoenix, J Team, and Splyce. They finished last in their group with 1 win and 5 losses.\n2020.\nGAM Esports went through various changes in 2020, signing Dia1, Easylove, and Palette while releasing Zeros and Zin. The team placed first in the 2020 VCS Spring regular season with 13 wins and 1 loss, but placed second in playoffs following a 2-3 loss against Team Flash. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Riot Games organised the 2020 Mid-Season Showdown featuring the top 2 PCS and top 2 VCS teams to replace the annual Mid-Season Invitational. GAM Esports finished fourth, securing a single win against Team Flash.\nIn summer 2020, GAM Esports once again finished first in the regular season, securing 12 wins and 2 losses. During playoffs, GAM Esports lost against Team Flash twice to place second in the event. Despite securing a spot at the 2020 World Championship, GAM Esports and Team Flash did not attend the event due to the pandemic. It was later announced that the teams would still receive 2.1 percent of the prize-pool."

As Chileans increased the pressure after the goal Elsener had to make some fine saves. Contreras and Sánchez also hit the woodwork. Just before halftime the score was level when Sánchez's shot was deflected by Morf. Six minutes into the second half Jaime Ramírez put Chile ahead and soon after Leonel Sánchez scored his second goal and secured the victory for Chile.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nWest Germany vs Italy.\nThis game saw not so many scoring chances for both sides. In the first half Uwe Seeler hit the bar, Albert Brülls and Omar Sívori also had their chances. In the second half the game became more physical and sometimes brutal but in the end defences overcame attacks and no goals were scored.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChile vs Italy.\nThe game was tough with much foul play. After only seven minutes Ferrini was sent off for kicking Landa and the game had to be interrupted for another eight minutes until the police escorted the Italian out of the field. Soon afterwards Leonel Sánchez responded to a series of kicks from Mario David by knocking him down with a punch in front of the linesman. The referee did nothing so David took revenge on Sánchez before halftime and was also sent off. Italians held out in the second half until Jaime Ramírez headed the ball into the net over two defenders after Sánchez's shot was punched away by Carlo Mattrel. In the last minutes Jorge Toro secured the Chilean victory with a long-range shot.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nWest Germany vs Switzerland.\nSwitzerland were left with just 10 men early in the game when Norbert Eschmann suffered an ankle injury after a sliding tackle by Horst Szymaniak. Albert Brülls scored the first goal just before halftime with a low shot into the far corner. Fourteen minutes into the second half Uwe Seeler got a long pass from Hans Schäfer and beat the Swiss goalkeeper for the second time. Switzerland could answer only with a Schneiter goal after a corner At the end of the game Brülls had another good chance but his first shot was parried by the goalkeeper and his second shot was cleared off the line by Schneiter.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nWest Germany vs Chile.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nItaly vs Switzerland.\nAlmost as soon as the game started Bruno Mora opened the score after Elsener deflected a crossshot by Pascutti.

        "text": "Group 3 of the 1962 FIFA World Cup took place from 30 May to 7 June 1962. The group consisted of Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Mexico, and Spain.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local time.\nBrazil vs Mexico.\nBrazilians attacked and Mexicans defended for most of the match. In the first half Pelé hit the woodwork with a free kick outside the box. Ten minutes after the break he made a cross from the right on Zagallo who headed the first goal. Then, after 73 minutes, Pele dribbled past four defenders and scored with his left foot from inside the penalty area.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCzechoslovakia vs Spain.\nSpain took the initiative but only managed to create danger in disorganized attacks. Spanish players repelled the harshness of the Czechs with the same violence. That fact provoked the snub of spectators who soon leaned in favour of Czechoslovakia. The injuries of Rivilla and Reija, the two defensive sides, made things worse for Spain. The Czechs seemed to settle for the draw but in 10 minutes' time a mistake from the centre of the Spanish field allowed Josef Štibrányi to face Carmelo's goal and score. The Spanish team weighed down by the injuries managed to create very little danger in the last minutes of the match.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBrazil vs Czechoslovakia.\nBrazil had to play part of the game with ten players after Pelé tore a thigh muscle midway through the first half. Neither side could break the deadlock and the game ended in 0-0 draw. The two sides would meet again in the final.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSpain vs Mexico.\nThe game had very little rhythm and Spanish attacks were lost or easily stopped by the Aztec defense or goalkeeper Carvajal. In the second half physical spending began to take its toll on Spain and Mexico took attack positions. However in one of counterattacks Luis Suárez and Puskas scored a goal which was cancelled for offside. In the last minutes of the game Mexicans claimed a penalty in the Spanish area. The game continued and the ball reached Gento who made a run on the left wing. Gento passed in to Peiró who finished past Carvajal a few seconds from the final whistle. Spain achieves victory, Santamaría, Pachín and Peiró were named the best men of the Spanish side according to the press.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBrazil vs Spain.\nSpain had control of the game in the first half and took the lead 10 minutes before halftime when Adelardo shot into the bottom corner from twenty meters. At the beginning of the second half Nílton Santos committed a foul inside the penalty area but the referee being far away from the episode awarded only a free kick to the Spanish team. Spain also had a goal disallowed for no evident reason. In the last 15 minutes of the game Amarildo (who was replacing Pele after the latter was injured in the previous match) scored twice to complete the Brazilian comeback.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMexico vs Czechoslovakia.\nIn this game Václav Mašek scored the fastest goal in the history of the tournament after only 15 seconds. Isidoro Díaz equalized after sweeping past two defenders, Alfredo del Águila made it 2-1 before half time. In the second half Mexicans secured their first World Cup victory with a late penalty converted by Héctor Hernández. Mašek’s record would be beaten 40 years later by Turkish footballer Hakan Şükür, after only 10 seconds. \n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "title": "Super Bowl LVIII",
        "text": "Super Bowl LVIII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2023 season. In a rematch of Super Bowl LIV from four years earlier, the American Football Conference (AFC) champion and defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers 25–22 in overtime. The Chiefs became the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls since the New England Patriots in 2004. The game was played on February 11, 2024, at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada. This was the first Super Bowl to be held in the state of Nevada. It marked the third straight year that the Super Bowl had been played in the Western United States, following host cities Inglewood, California, in 2022 and Glendale, Arizona, in 2023.\nAs this was the Chiefs' fourth Super Bowl appearance and third win in five years, many have said this game established them as a dynasty. It was the second Super Bowl to be decided in overtime, the first being Super Bowl LI, seven years earlier. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was named Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP), completing 34 of 46 passes for 333 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. Due to the seating capacity of Allegiant Stadium, the game's sellout attendance of 61,629 was the smallest crowd in Super Bowl history outside of Super Bowl LV, which was played during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe game was televised nationally by CBS, streamed on Paramount+, alternatively broadcast on youth-oriented sister network Nickelodeon, and televised on the Spanish-language network Univision. It was also the second simulcast in Super Bowl history since Super Bowl I. Super Bowl LVIII became the most watched program in American television history, with a total of 123.7 million average viewers across all platforms, which broke the average record of 115.1 million viewers set by the previous year's Super Bowl. The game saw the highest unduplicated total audience in history with more than 200 million viewers watching all or part of the game. It was the most-watched United States broadcast since the Apollo 11 moon landing, attributed to the Taylor Swift effect. The halftime show, headlined by Usher, peaked at 129.3 million viewers. The game's net playing time of 74 minutes and 57 seconds ranks as the longest in Super Bowl history.\nBackground.\nHost selection.\nOn May 23, 2018, the NFL picked New Orleans to host Super Bowl LVIII. The league picked the winning city from a list of candidates that it had compiled, a process that replaced an earlier one in which cities that wished to host a Super Bowl submitted bids to be debated and voted upon at the league owners' meetings. \nIn March 2020, the NFL and the NFL Players Association agreed to expand the regular season from 16 to 17 games beginning in 2021, pushing Super Bowl LVIII to February 11, 2024, and causing a conflict with the city's Mardi Gras celebrations.\nThe NFL announced on October 14, 2020, that New Orleans would host Super Bowl LIX instead of Super Bowl LVIII, and then announced on December 15, 2021, that Allegiant Stadium was chosen as the new site.\nLogo.\nThe official logo was unveiled on February 13, 2023; it follows the updated logo template established by Super Bowl LVI, with the traditional Roman numerals containing imagery of a sunset behind the skyline of the Las Vegas Strip and the Las Vegas sign. The numerals were also slanted inward to evoke the architecture of resorts such as the Bellagio and Wynn Las Vegas. The unveiling of this logo was met with acclaim, with many praising its originality and its effective representation of the host city's spirit amid the standardized designs used since 2011.\nTeams.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nUnder seventh-year head coach Kyle Shanahan, the San Francisco 49ers ended the 2023 season with a 12–5 record, the NFC's No. 1 seed, and a first-round bye.\nFollowing the success of rookie quarterback Brock Purdy, who led them to an NFC Championship Game the previous season, the 49ers traded away Trey Lance, the third overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft, and made Purdy the full-time starter. In his first full season as the starter, Purdy was named to the Pro Bowl, throwing for 4,280 yards, 31 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions and finished with a passer rating of 113.0, the highest in the league. The offense was also led by first-team All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey, whom the 49ers acquired midway through the 2022 season. He led the league in scrimmage yards (2,023) and total touchdowns (21). San Francisco's receiving core was led by Brandon Aiyuk, George Kittle, and Deebo Samuel, all of whom gained more than 1,000 scrimmage yards. The 49ers were the first team in league history to have four players with over 1,000 scrimmage yards. The 49ers' offense finished second in the league in total offense with 398.4 yards per game, which included finishing fourth in pass yards per game (257.9) and third in rush yards per game (140.5). The offensive line was spearheaded by left tackle Trent Williams, who received his third First-team All-Pro selection and his 11th Pro Bowl nomination.\nOn defense, the 49ers finished third in the league in scoring defense, giving up 17.5 points per game, and finished first in the league with 22 interceptions (tied with the Chicago Bears). San Francisco's defensive line featured Pro Bowl defensive end Nick Bosa, who led the team with 10.5 sacks, along with defensive tackle Javon Hargrave (seven sacks) and Arik Armstead (five sacks). First-team All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner led the team with 132 combined tackles, four interceptions, four forced fumbles, and 2.5 sacks. The secondary was led by second-team All-Pro cornerbacks Charvarius Ward (five interceptions and 72 tackles) and Deommodore Lenoir (three interceptions, 84 tackles).\nThis game marked the 49ers' eighth Super Bowl appearance. The franchise won its first five Super Bowl appearances (XVI, XIX, XXIII, XXIV, and XXIX) but lost its last two before this game (XLVII and LIV). Had the 49ers had won the game, they would have been the first NFC team to win six Super Bowls and the third team overall, joining the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nKansas City entered the 2023 NFL season as defending Super Bowl champions, having won Super Bowl LVII. They finished the 2023 season with an 11–6 record, their 11th consecutive winning season and eighth consecutive AFC West title under eleventh-year head coach Andy Reid, and as the No. 3 seed in the AFC.\nIn his sixth season as the starter, quarterback Patrick Mahomes had his worst statistical season in several categories, including yards per attempt (7.0), passing yards per game (261.4), interceptions (14), and passer rating (92.6). His receivers struggled at several points throughout the season, and going into week 18, the Chiefs led the league in dropped passes. Despite this, Mahomes set a career-high in completion percentage with 67.2% while throwing for 27 touchdowns. Tight end Travis Kelce led the Chiefs in receiving yards for the fourth time in five seasons, but finished with under 1,000 receiving yards for the first time since 2015. Rookie receiver Rashee Rice led the Chiefs' wide receivers with 938 yards and seven touchdowns, while second-year running back Isiah Pacheco ran for 935 yards and seven touchdowns. The offensive line featured two Pro Bowl selections: guard Joe Thuney and center Creed Humphrey.\nThe Chiefs' defensive line featured Pro Bowl defensive tackle Chris Jones, who had 10.5 sacks, and defensive end George Karlaftis (10.5 sacks). The secondary was led by cornerbacks L'Jarius Sneed (two interceptions, 78 tackles, 14 pass deflections) and All Pro Trent McDuffie (80 tackles, 5 forced fumbles, 3 sacks), along with safety Justin Reid (team-high 95 tackles, 1 interception, 3 sacks).\nSuper Bowl LVIII was the Chiefs' sixth Super Bowl appearance and fourth in the past five seasons. Entering the game, the Chiefs had won three Super Bowls (IV, LIV, and LVII) and lost two (I and LV). The Chiefs also won one pre-Super Bowl era AFL Championship, in 1962 (as the Dallas Texans).\nPlayoffs.\nAs the No. 1 seed in the NFC, the 49ers received a first-round bye. In the NFC Divisional Round, the 49ers hosted the No. 7 seed Green Bay Packers. Although the Packers took a 21–14 lead heading into the fourth quarter, the 49ers rallied to win the game 24–21 thanks to a late game-winning drive led by Brock Purdy that ended with a touchdown by Christian McCaffrey. Linebacker Dre Greenlaw sealed the game for the 49ers by intercepting quarterback Jordan Love on the Packers' final drive. This allowed the 49ers to advance to their third straight NFC Championship Game and their fourth in the last five seasons. In that game, the 49ers hosted the No. 3 seed Detroit Lions. The 49ers fell behind quickly, trailing 24–7 at halftime. They scored 27 straight points to take a 34–24 lead late in the fourth quarter. The Lions scored one more touchdown after that but failed to recover the ensuing onside kick attempt, sending the 49ers to their second Super Bowl in five seasons with a 34–31 win.\nAs the No. 3 seed in the AFC, the Chiefs hosted the No. 6 seed Miami Dolphins in the AFC Wild Card Round. Due to a cold wave in mid-January, the temperature was at this game's kickoff, which was the fourth-coldest in NFL history. The Chiefs defeated the Dolphins 26–7. The Dolphins' only points in the game came from a touchdown pass from quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to former Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill. The win saw the Chiefs play their first road playoff game in the Mahomes era, the AFC Divisional Round against the No. 2 seed Buffalo Bills. This game saw five lead changes between the two teams. The Chiefs won 27–24 as Buffalo kicker Tyler Bass missed a potential game-tying field goal wide right in the final two minutes. With that win, the Chiefs advanced to their sixth straight AFC Championship Game, which they played on the road against the No. 1 seed Baltimore Ravens. Miscues on both offense and defense doomed the Ravens; the Chiefs led 17–7 at halftime and came up with big defensive stops in the second half to win 17–10. The Chiefs won back-to-back AFC titles for the second time in the Patrick Mahomes era and advanced to their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons.\nPre-game notes.\nAs the designated home team in the Super Bowl's annual rotation between the two conferences, the Chiefs chose to wear their red home jerseys with white pants. The 49ers wore their white away jerseys with gold pants.\nAs the designated home team, the Chiefs practiced at the host team Las Vegas Raiders' practice facility in Henderson, Nevada, during the week leading up to the game. The 49ers practiced at UNLV's Fertitta Football Complex in Paradise, Nevada. Both teams stayed off-Strip at luxury hotels at the Lake Las Vegas resort area east of the city, with the Chiefs staying at the Westin and the 49ers staying at the Hilton.\nThe game was a rematch of Super Bowl LIV (played in February 2020), in which the Chiefs defeated the 49ers, 31–20, overcoming a 10-point fourth quarter deficit. Mahomes was named the MVP of that Super Bowl. Bill Vinovich was also the referee for that game, making him the first referee to preside over two Super Bowl meetings between the same teams.\nThis game was also the first since Super Bowl LV to feature the defending champion. That game saw the defending champion Chiefs fall to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThe game was dubbed by fans and media outlets as the \"Taylor Swift Bowl\" or \"Swiftie Bowl\", referencing singer-songwriter Taylor Swift and her fans, which are known as Swifties. The season broke viewership, merchandise, and ticket sales records for the NFL, following Swift's relationship with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and her frequent appearances at Chiefs games. Fans who began supporting the Chiefs due to Swift's association with them have been dubbed as \"Chiefties\".\nAs has been the case with the Chiefs in many nationally televised and publicized games in the past, some Indigenous people's groups used the high profile of Super Bowl LVIII to call on the team to change its name and for their fans to end the use of the tomahawk chop.\nBroadcasting.\nUnited States.\nTelevision.\nSuper BowlLVIII was televised by CBS, the network's 22nd broadcast of the game. It was the first Super Bowl to be broadcast under the new 11-year NFL television contract, which began a four-year rotation between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ABC/ESPN.\nCBS used 165 cameras, including six embedded within the goal posts (\"doink cams\"), 48 for high-frame-rate video (24 of which were in 4K for zooming), and 23 for augmented reality effects. Robotic cameras were placed in the city at The Strat, Planet Hollywood Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, and the Renaissance Las Vegas; another camera ran on a wire over the Bellagio fountains. CBS televised the game in 1080p with high-dynamic-range (HDR) color, upconverted to 4K UHD on Paramount+ and certain television providers. CBS built a studio set in front of the Bellagio fountains, from which it broadcast CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports HQ programs during Super Bowl week, as well as editions of \"CBS Mornings\" and \"The Talk\". \"The NFL Today\" began its pre-game coverage from the studio, then moved to sets outside Allegiant Stadium, then into the stadium as kickoff time approached.\nCBS's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz (play-by-play), Tony Romo (color commentary), Tracy Wolfson (sideline reporter), and Gene Steratore (rules analyst) called their third Super Bowl together, joined by additional sideline reporter Evan Washburn and special teams analyst Jay Feely. The pre-game show featured CBS Sports personalities Kyle Brandt, James Brown, Nate Burleson, Bill Cowher, Charles Davis, Ian Eagle, Boomer Esiason, Jonathan Jones, Jason McCourty, Matt Ryan, Phil Simms, and J. J. Watt. The series premiere of \"Tracker\" aired after the game. After late local programming, CBS also aired special Sunday-night episodes of its late-night shows \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and \"After Midnight\".\nCBS sub-licensed the Spanish-language rights to its last three Super Bowl games to ESPN Deportes, but TelevisaUnivision announced in May 2023 that it had reached an agreement with CBS to carry Super BowlLVIII via TUDN; the TUDN division was represented at the game by both Univision and Mexican network Canal 5, which produced separate broadcasts for each territory. Ramses Sandoval, Memo Schutz, and Martín Gramática were the broadcast team for Univision. CBS also carried Spanish commentary via SAP on the main broadcast.\nOn August1, 2023, CBS Sports announced that it would carry a youth-oriented alternate broadcast of the game on Paramount Global sister network Nickelodeon; the network has aired alternate broadcasts of select NFL games since 2021, but this was the first such broadcast for a Super Bowl. Billed as \"Super BowlLVIII: Live from Bikini Bottom\", the broadcast incorporated \"SpongeBob SquarePants\"-themed augmented reality effects and features (in addition to those seen on previous games aired by the network), and live appearances by characters from the series (such as \"analysts\" SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star, along with \"sideline reporter\" Sandy Cheeks) accompanying announcers Noah Eagle and Nate Burleson. Nickelodeon aired the series premiere of \"Rock Paper Scissors\" after the game.\nAdvertising.\nCBS charged $6.5 million to $7 million for a 30-second commercial, remaining steady with the previous year's game. Several health and beauty brands bought ads during the game, with analysts suggesting that these buys may have been motivated by Taylor Swift's presence at the game, and the potential for increased viewership by women. FanDuel's ad following their second \"Kick of Destiny\" featured a posthumous appearance by actor Carl Weathers, who died on February 1, 2024. Most of the advertising time sold by CBS also included airtime on the Nickelodeon simulcast, and selected advertisers were given opportunities to participate in promotional initiatives incorporating Nickelodeon personalities. Commercials for products inappropriate for children (such as alcohol, gambling, and R-rated films) were not carried; Paramount Global sold about 15 Nickelodeon-specific advertising slots for $200,000 to $300,000 each to replace these ads.\nAmid the AI boom, a number of commercials advertised artificial intelligence (AI)-related products and services, including Crowdstrike, Etsy's \"Gift Mode\" (powered by OpenAI GPT-4), Microsoft Copilot, and AI-based photo editing features on Google Pixel 8 smartphones. Generative artificial intelligence was satirized by a tease for \"Despicable Me 4\" depicting an AI art generator that was actually being run by minions. A super PAC supporting 2024 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. aired a spot, which called back to his uncle, John F. Kennedy’s campaign, during the game. Kennedy faced criticism from family members and friends who argued that the ad \"exploits and potentially tarnishes the legacy of a storied political family\".\nChinese online marketplace Temu showed their spot five times during and shortly after the game. Beyoncé starred in a commercial with actor Tony Hale for Verizon. Her appearance was teased by the company in the days leading up to the Super Bowl with teaser trailers referencing her sixth and seventh studio albums, \"Lemonade\" (2016) and \"Renaissance\" (2022). At the end of the commercial, which sees the singer attempt to \"break the internet\" in various ways, Beyoncé says, \"Okay, they ready. Drop the new music\"; at that time, the singer posted a teaser video on Instagram for her next studio album.\nA Vrbo commercial was heavily criticized by Newfoundland and Labrador over the misappropriation of the folk song \"I's the B'y\" in a scene set in a vacation rental out of a farmhouse that is overcrowded with animals. The provincial government demanded that the commercial be removed from television; Vrbo apologized on February 15 and announced that it would follow through doing so.\nThe Super Bowl Ad Meter survey conducted by \"USA Today\" was won by State Farm for their ad \"Like a Good Neighbaaa\" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito.\nStreaming.\nThe game streamed on Paramount+ in English, on TelevisaUnivision's Vix in Spanish, in addition to the paid NFL+ app.\nRadio.\nWestwood One held the national radio rights to the game, airing it on their various affiliates. The broadcast team featured booth announcers Kevin Harlan (play-by-play) and Kurt Warner (analyst), sideline reporters Mike Golic and Laura Okmin, and rules analyst Dean Blandino. Entravision broadcast the game in Spanish. Annually, over 25 million people listen to the Super Bowl via radio broadcast.\nInternational.\nSuper Bowl LVIII was broadcast in more than 150 countries on every continent except Antarctica, including:\nEntertainment.\nPregame.\nOn January 18, 2024, the NFL announced that country music singer Reba McEntire would perform the U.S. national anthem. Actor Daniel Durant performed the national anthem in American Sign Language. In addition, rapper Post Malone performed \"America the Beautiful\" and R&amp;B singer Andra Day accompanied by six female backup singers performed \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\", with actress Anjel Piñero and actor Shaheem Sanchez performing both songs in ASL.\nElectronic music artist Kaskade performed before and during the game, making him the first DJ to perform throughout the Super Bowl. He replaced Tiësto, who dropped out after a family emergency.\nThe NFL invited players and coaches from Lahainaluna High School in Lahaina, Hawaii, to serve as honorary captains during the coin toss ceremony. Lahaina was one of the communities ravaged by the 2023 Hawaii wildfires.\nHalftime.\nOn September24, 2023, it was announced that R&amp;B and pop singer Usher would headline the halftime show.\nUsher's performance included the songs \"Caught Up\", \"U Don't Have to Call\", \"Love in This Club\", \"Confessions Part II\", \"Nice &amp; Slow\", \"Burn\", \"U Got It Bad\", \"OMG\", and \"Yeah!\" (with interpolations of \"Freek-a-Leek\" by Petey Pablo and \"Get Low\" by Lil Jon). The show also featured surprise appearances by Alicia Keys, will.i.am, Lil Jon, Ludacris, H.E.R, and Sonic Boom of the South.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nAfter the Chiefs won the coin toss and deferred possession to the second half, the 49ers received the opening kickoff, which was a touchback. The 49ers' initial drive gained 49 yards in five plays, with Christian McCaffrey and Brock Purdy advancing the ball into Chiefs' territory before McCaffrey lost a fumble at the Kansas City 27-yard line, ending the drive and giving the Chiefs possession.\nThe Chiefs' first possession resulted in a punt after a three-and-out. The 49ers' following possession, which went for four plays and 16 yards, was hampered by a false start and a holding penalty. After the 49ers failed to convert a third-and-27, the drive ended in a punt. The next drive by the Chiefs, which went for four plays and ten yards, ended in a punt as well.\nFollowing these back-and-forth punts, the 49ers put up a ten-play, 46-yard drive that began at their own 17-yard line. Though the first quarter ended with the game still scoreless during this drive, it culminated in a 55-yard field goal by 49ers kicker Jake Moody, making the score 3–0 with 14:48 remaining in the second quarter. It set the record for the longest field goal completed in a Super Bowl.\nThe Chiefs began their next drive at their own 25-yard line. The Chiefs went down the field, moving 66 yards in four plays and reaching the 49ers' nine-yard line. But on the drive's fifth play, Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco fumbled the ball, which was recovered by the 49ers.\nThe next two possessions both ended in punts. The 49ers, after recovering the fumble, moved 21 yards in four plays before punting the ball away, and the Chiefs followed this up by going three-and-out. After the Chiefs punted the ball 50 yards to San Francisco's 33-yard line with 7:49 remaining in the second quarter, the 49ers began an eight-play, 67-yard touchdown drive that culminated in a 21-yard touchdown pass from wide receiver Jauan Jennings to running back McCaffrey. After the extra point was converted, the 49ers had extended their lead over the Chiefs to 10–0 with 4:23 remaining in the first half.\nThe Chiefs used most of the remaining time in the half in a 13-play, 65-yard drive that resulted in a 28-yard field goal by Harrison Butker, bringing the score to 10–3 in favor of the 49ers with 20 seconds remaining in the half. The 49ers took a knee to run the clock out.\nSecond half.\nThe second half began with a 49ers kickoff, which went for a touchback, putting the Chiefs at the 25-yard line. They fumbled on first down, but recovered it themselves for a ten-yard loss on the play. After a subsequent gain of ten yards on 2nd and 22, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw an interception to Ji'Ayir Brown on third down, giving the 49ers possession of at the Kansas City 44-yard line. Though starting inside of Kansas City territory, the 49ers were unable to score on the possession following the turnover, going three-and-out, but pinned the Chiefs at their own 2-yard line after a punt by Mitch Wishnowsky. Following this, the Chiefs and the 49ers traded three-and-out possessions.\nWith 9:02 remaining in the third quarter, the Chiefs had the ball at their own 14-yard line. Beginning with an 11-yard pass by Mahomes to tight-end Travis Kelce, Kansas City went on a nine-play, 47-yard drive that culminated in a 57-yard field goal by Butker. This field goal, which cut the Chiefs' deficit to four points, broke the record for the longest field goal completed in a Super Bowl set by Moody earlier in the game.\nThe 49ers went three-and-out on the ensuing drive. After Wishnowsky's 55-yard punt was returned seven yards to the Kansas City 25-yard line, the Chiefs ran three plays for eight yards, and punted the ball away. The 40-yard punt by Tommy Townsend landed on the San Francisco 25-yard line, and hit the leg of Darrell Luter Jr. at the 49ers 19-yard line after the ball bounced; Kansas City cornerback Jaylen Watson recovered the ball at the 49ers 16-yard line, thereby giving the Chiefs possession inside the San Francisco red zone. On the following play, the Chiefs scored on a 16-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes to wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling. After Butker converted the extra point, the Chiefs had a 13–10 lead with 2:28 remaining in the third quarter.\nThe 49ers began their next drive at their own 25-yard line. After San Francisco converted a 3rd and 5 on their own 30 on a 17-yard pass to Jennings, and 2nd and 1 on a two-yard run by fullback Kyle Juszczyk, the 49ers had advanced to the Chiefs' 42-yard line to close the third quarter. The drive continued, eventually resulting in a ten-yard touchdown pass from Purdy to Jennings after a total of 12 plays for 75 yards, which gave the 49ers a 16–13 lead with eleven minutes and twenty-seven seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. The extra point attempt following the touchdown was blocked by Chiefs linebacker Leo Chenal.\nDown three points, the Chiefs began to drive against the 49ers. With 9:22 left in the fourth quarter, on a 1st and 10 at the 49ers' 46-yard line, Mahomes fumbled the ball, but recovered and threw an incomplete pass on the play. The drive continued, totaling 12 plays and 69 yards; after marching down to San Francisco's 3-yard line, Mahomes was sacked on 3rd and goal. Butker kicked a 24-yard field goal, tying the game at 16–16 with 5:49 seconds remaining in the quarter.\nStarting on their own 25-yard line, the 49ers moved the ball down the field, getting a 1st and 10 at the Chiefs' 40-yard line after four plays. After a five-yard run by McCaffrey, Purdy threw an incomplete pass, and the two-minute warning occurred. Purdy threw another incomplete pass on third down, bringing up a 4th and 5 and setting up Moody for a field goal attempt. Moody converted a 53-yard field goal try, giving San Francisco a 19–16 lead with 1:53 remaining in the game.\nThe Chiefs began their final drive of regulation on their own 25-yard line with 1:53 remaining. The Chiefs began to drive down the field on the next several plays. After converting a 3rd and 2 from the San Francisco 43-yard line with 42 seconds remaining, and later a 3rd and 7 from the 49ers' 33-yard line, the Chiefs had a 1st down from the 49ers 11-yard line with ten seconds to go. After an incomplete pass from Mahomes intended for Kelce, with six seconds remaining, Butker kicked a game-tying 29-yard field goal to top off the 11-play, 64-yard drive, bringing the score to 19–19 with three seconds remaining. The 49ers took a knee to send the game to overtime.\nOvertime.\nIn overtime, the 49ers possessed the ball first, driving down the field before stalling at the Chiefs' 9-yard line and kicking a field goal. Mahomes and the Chiefs responded by driving 75 yards in 13 plays, converting two third downs and a fourth down to set up first-and-goal on the San Francisco 3-yard line. Mahomes then passed to Mecole Hardman for the game-winning touchdown. This was the first game in Super Bowl history in which the lead changed hands on the final play of the game.\nThis was the first playoff game to go to overtime since the NFL changed the overtime rules for playoff games prior to the 2022 season so that both teams get at least one chance to possess the ball in overtime even if a touchdown is scored on the initial possession. Several 49ers players admitted after the game that they were unaware of the rule change, with Arik Armstead stating that he and other players learned of the change at the beginning of the overtime period when it was displayed on the Allegiant Stadium video screen. The rule change did not affect the outcome of the game; since the 49ers scored a field goal on the initial possession, the Chiefs would still have had an opportunity to possess the ball under the pre-2022 rules.\nThe game lasted for 74 minutes and 57 seconds of game time, making it the longest Super Bowl and 7th-longest NFL postseason game ever.\nMahomes completed 34 of his 46 pass attempts for 333 yards with two touchdowns and one interception and was named the Super Bowl MVP for the third time in his career. He also ran for 66 yards. McCaffrey was the top rusher of the game with 22 carries for 80 yards. He also led the 49ers with eight catches for 80 yards and a receiving touchdown. The top receiver of the game was Kelce, with nine catches for 93 yards.\nFinal statistics.\nIndividual statistics.\nCompletions/attempts&lt;br&gt;Carries&lt;br&gt;Long gain&lt;br&gt;Receptions&lt;br&gt;Times targeted\nOfficials.\nSuper Bowl LVIII featured seven officials, a replay official, a replay assistant, and eight alternate officials. The numbers in parentheses below indicate their uniform numbers.\nSuper Bowl LVIII was the third time Vinovich refereed a Super Bowl, while Perlman and Hill officiated their final games after careers spanning 23 and 25 years, respectively. Killens, a former NFL linebacker, became the first person to officiate a Super Bowl after having played in one (he played for the Tennessee Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV).\nAftermath.\nThis marked the Chiefs' third Super Bowl title and fourth Super Bowl appearance in five seasons, leading many sports commentators to consider them to be a dynasty.\nAfter the game, the 49ers fired defensive coordinator Steve Wilks after one season on the job, citing poor defensive performances through the playoffs including the Super Bowl.\nVictory parade.\nA victory parade ran from Sixth Street to Union Station on February 14. The city council authorized almost $1 million in spending for the parade.\nA shooting took place at Union Station shortly after the parade. Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a DJ of local radio station KKFI, was killed and at least 21 others were non-fatally injured, including 11 children. Three suspects are arrested, two of them armed."

        "text": "José David Flores (born January 1, 1971) is a Puerto Rican minor league professional baseball coach and former minor league player. He is the bench coach of the Worcester Red Sox of Minor League Baseball. He previously coached in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies and Baltimore Orioles. He played baseball professionally in the minors from 1990 to 1994 as an infielder.\nMinor league playing career.\nThe Houston Astros selected Flores in the 38th round (1,014th overall) of the 1990 Major League Baseball draft. Beginning with the 1990 season, he was assigned to the Class A Short Season Auburn Astros of the New York–Penn League. In all, Flores played five years in Minor League Baseball (MiLB), all in the Astros' farm system, from 1990 to 1994.\nIn 1992 and 1993, Flores made 37 errors at shortstop, each year. In 1994, he spent his final season as an active player with the Double-A Jackson Generals of the Texas League, batting just .192.\nIn 1,340 minor league at bats, Flores had a .239/.310/.287 slash line, with five home runs, 36 stolen bases, and 115 runs batted in (RBIs). A utility infielder, he played 314 games at shortstop, 63 games at second base, and 26 games at third base. In Flores’ final season, he appeared in two games as a relief pitcher.\nCoaching and managing career.\nAfter retiring as a player, Flores has served as a manager, bench coach, third base coach, first base coach, and infield coach in the Puerto Rican Winter League (LBPRC). He managed the Puerto Rican national baseball team during the Guadalajara 2011 PanAm Games and the 2011 Baseball World Cup. He managed the Cidra Bravos of the FBAPR (PR Baseball Federation), winning back to back national titles during the 2005 and 2006 seasons, and was named manager of the year for 2005. He won his third national title with the club in 2009.\nFlores managed the 2008 Dominican Summer League Indians, and for five seasons, he worked for the Chicago Cubs as their infield coordinator.\nThe Philadelphia Phillies hired Flores to their major league coaching staff for the 2018 season. He was named first base coach and infield coach, and was also in charge of baserunning.\nIn 2019 and 2020, Flores was the Baltimore Orioles third base coach and infield coach. \nAfter he was engaged in a dugout shouting match about defensive positioning by ground-ball relief pitcher Richard Bleier, Bleier finally played in front of an infield that was not shifted for the final month of the 2019 season, and saw his results improve. In both 2019 and 2020, the team was the American League’s worst defensive infield by the Statcast metric outs above average. After the 2020 season his contract was not renewed.\nIn December 2021, Flores was named the bench coach of the Worcester Red Sox, the Triple-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox."

        "text": "Harry Grant (born 17 February 1998) is an Australian professional rugby league footballer who captains and plays as a for the Melbourne Storm in the National Rugby League (NRL) and Australia at international level.\nGrant played for the Wests Tigers on loan for the 2020 NRL season. The arrangement between Wests and the Storm to trade Grant with Paul Momirovski was the first loan arrangement in NRL history. \nHe has played at representative level for Queensland in State of Origin.\nEarly life.\nGrant was born in Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia and educated at St. Brendan's College, Yeppoon.\nGrant almost died when he was 12 years old after contracting a staphylococcal infection. He was admitted to intensive care and underwent three operations before being placed on a course of antibiotics for five months. He then sustained a compound fracture in one of his legs when he an all-terrain vehicle rolled on the beach. As a result, he was unable to play rugby league for two years.\nHis older brother George Grant is also a rugby league player who has represented the Central Queensland Capras in the Queensland Cup as well as the Yeppoon Seagulls in the Rockhampton Senior Local Rugby League competition.\nThey both played their junior rugby league for the Yeppoon Seagulls.\nPlaying career.\n2016 - 2017: Early career.\nGrant played for the Melbourne Storm Holden Cup team from 2016 to 2017, scoring 9 tries and playing 21 games.\nWhile playing for Melbourne Storm National Youth Competition, he also made appearances for Sunshine Coast Falcons in the Queensland Instrust Super Cup. At the seasons end at Rugby League Players Association Awards night he was recipient of the National Youth Competition player of the year award.\n2018 - 2019: NRL Debut and further development.\nHe made his NRL debut for the Melbourne Storm in their Round 11 match against Manly-Warringah . He had his Melbourne jersey (cap number 188) presented to him by Melbourne captain Cameron Smith.\nIn 2019, Grant spent the majority of the season playing for the Sunshine Coast Falcons in the Queensland Cup, taking them to the minor premiership and earning a spot in the Queensland Cup Team of the Year. He was also named the Falcons Player of the Year, winning the James Ackerman Medal. \nIn Round 25 he made his second NRL appearance, coming off the bench in Melbourne's 24–16 win over North Queensland.\n2020: Wests Tigers Loan.\nDuring the lead up to the 2020 NRL season the Wests Tigers and Melbourne Storm attempted to arrange a temporary player swap between Grant and Wests Tigers player Paul Momirovski. The primary catalyst of this was Wests Tigers requiring reinforcements at Grant's preferred position of hooker due to the retirement of Robbie Farah and long-term injury to Wests Tigers preferred replacement Jacob Liddle. Grant, being Melbourne's third choice at his preferred position behind Melbourne Storm captain Cameron Smith and New Zealand Kiwis international hooker Brandon Smith was receptive to the move and began to push for it himself. Initially the NRL salary cap administrators refused to process the request because Melbourne would have gone over the salary cap if the deal had been processed at that time.\nAfter the NRL initially rejected the arrangement Grant requested an immediate release from his Melbourne contract in the hopes of joining the Wests Tigers as soon as possible though this did not eventuate.\nThere were further delays due to injury to Brandon Smith causing Melbourne to hold up proceedings so they could have Grant provide back up to Cameron Smith in the early rounds of the season, and briefly by Momirovski wishing to sign a new contract with Wests Tigers prior to leaving, but the deal was finally made official during round 2 of the season on March 21, 2020. This deal was the first of its kind in the NRL.\nGrant was selected in the Queensland 27 man squad for the 2020 State of Origin series, Grant debut in Game 3 of the series in a 20-14 win scoring the match sealing try winning the series 2-1.\n2021 - present: Regular game time and National debut.\nDespite missing a number of games through injury, Grant was selected in the Queensland team for Game 1 of the 2021 State of Origin series.\nGrant played a total of 15 games for Melbourne in the 2021 NRL season as the club won 19 matches in a row and claimed the Minor Premiership. Grant played both finals matches including the preliminary final where Melbourne suffered a shock 10-6 loss against eventual premiers Penrith.\nIn October Grant was named in the Australia squad for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.\nGrant played for Australia in their 2021 Rugby League World Cup final victory over Samoa.\nIn November he was named in the .\nIn the opening game of the 2023 NRL season against the Parramatta Eels, Grant scored the first golden point try in Melbourne Storm history.\nGrant played in all three games of the 2023 State of Origin series as Queensland won the shield 2-1.

        "title": "Michael King (baseball)",
        "text": "Michael McRae King (born May 25, 1995) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the New York Yankees.\nAmateur career.\nKing attended Bishop Hendricken High School in Warwick, Rhode Island. He played for the school's baseball team as a pitcher and an outfielder, and helped the team win the Division I state championship in 2012, his junior year. In 2013, he was named the Gatorade Baseball Player of the Year for Rhode Island after pitching to a 7–0 win–loss record and a 0.30 earned run average (ERA) with 67 strikeouts and seven walks in 47 innings pitched. He also had a .469 batting average as an outfielder.\nKing graduated from Bishop Hendricken in 2013 and enrolled at Boston College, where he played college baseball for the Boston College Eagles. In 2015, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Harbor Hawks of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nProfessional career.\nMiami Marlins.\nThe Miami Marlins selected King in the 12th round, with the 353rd overall selection, of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft. He signed and made his professional debut that season with the Gulf Coast Marlins of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League before being promoted to the Batavia Muckdogs of the Low–A New York-Penn League and then to the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the Single–A South Atlantic League. In innings pitched between the three teams, he finished the season with a 3–3 record and a 4.11 ERA. He spent the 2017 season with Greensboro, where he went 11–9 with a 3.14 ERA in 26 games (25 starts).\nNew York Yankees.\nOn November 20, 2017, the Marlins traded King and international signing bonus money to the New York Yankees in exchange for Caleb Smith and Garrett Cooper. He began the 2018 season with the Tampa Tarpons of the High–A Florida State League, and earned midseason promotions to the Trenton Thunder of the Double–A Eastern League and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Triple–A International League.\nThe Yankees invited King to spring training as a non-roster player in 2019. He suffered a stress reaction in his pitching elbow and did not pitch in spring training. The Yankees promoted him to the major leagues on September 19. He made his major league debut on September 27 versus the Texas Rangers, pitching two innings in relief. In the shortened 60-game season in 2020, King recorded a 7.76 ERA in innings pitched across nine appearances, including four games started.\nOver the course of the 2021 season, King improved his slider with the assistance of Corey Kluber, a teammate. On June 4, during a game against the Boston Red Sox, King pitched an immaculate inning in the fourth inning, with three strikeouts on only nine pitches; it was the seventh in Yankees history and the first in the history of the Yankees–Red Sox rivalry. On July 8, King was placed on the injured list with a right middle finger contusion. He was later transferred to the 60-day injured list on July 27. King was activated on September 10. He finished the 2021 season with a 3.55 ERA in innings, recording 62 strikeouts and 24 walks.\nKing opened the 2022 season in the Yankees bullpen. He earned his first major league save on April 14, 2022. While playing against the Baltimore Orioles on July 22, King left the game with an elbow injury. His right elbow was fractured, and he underwent surgery that ruled him out for the rest of the season.\nIn spring training in 2023, King suggested to manager Aaron Boone that he could be used as a starting pitcher. He started the season as a reliever, but injuries to Yankees starters led to King becoming a starter in August. He had a 2.75 ERA in 49 appearances for the season, with a 1.88 ERA in eight games started. Boone said that he expects that King will pitch out of the starting rotation in 2024.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn December 6, 2023, the Yankees traded King, Drew Thorpe, Randy Vásquez, Jhony Brito, and Kyle Higashioka to the San Diego Padres for Juan Soto and Trent Grisham."

Five players also finished the year in the national ITA rankings.\nIn terms of sheer number of victories, from 2008 to 2011 the team wrapped up their most successful three-year period in program history with a 101–18 (.849) record, and year-end Top 19 rankings each season. The Vols went 31-2 in 2010, won 23 matches in 2008 and 2009, and claimed 24 wins in 2011. \nIn 2014 Winterbotham coached doubles pair Mikelis Libietis and Hunter Reese all the way to the 2014 NCAA doubles title. After 11 years of coaching UT, as well as a 217-104 match record, Sam Winterbotham was fired on May 4, 2017 at the conclusion of the 2017 season. The Vols had struggled and missed the NCAA Tournament for two consecutive years in 2016 and 2017. In Winterbothams last two years at Tennessee he had a combined 25-31 record and the Vols were 3-21 in SEC play.\nChris Woodruff era.\nWinterbotham was replaced by long term assistant and former NCAA Singles Champion at Tennessee Chris Woodruff. In Woodruff's first season as head coach he led the Vols to a 21-9 record and 4th place in the SEC regular season standings with an 8-4 conference record. Tennessee made the semifinals of the SEC tournament losing to Texas A&amp;M 4-0. The Vols returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2015 beating UNC Wilmington 4-0 in the first round before losing to North Carolina 4-0 in the NCAA round of 32. \nIn the 2019 season, Woodruff led Tennessee to the SEC title game, where they fell to #6 ranked Mississippi State. As the NCAA Tournament’s #14 seed, Tennessee fell in NCAA round of 16 to #3 seed Florida. They ended the season with a 22-8 overall record, and an 8-4 record in-conference. \nTennessee was ranked #19, with a 14-2 record, when the 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nIn the 2021 season, Tennessee defeated #13 Ole Miss, #12 South Carolina, and #1 ranked Florida in consecutive days to win their first SEC Tournament since 2010, and entered the NCAA tournament as the #3 overall seed with a 24-3 record, and a 10-2 conference record. In the NCAA Tournament, the Vols beat Alabama A&amp;M 5-0 and Memphis 4-0 in the round of 64 and 32. At the USTA National Campus in Orlando, Tennessee went on to defeat Arizona 4-3 in the NCAA round of 16, and #11 Georgia in the Elite 8. The team season ended with a 4-2 loss to #2 Baylor in the final four, concluding the year with a 28-4 record. One week later, Tennessee players Pat Harper and Adam Walton won the NCAA individual doubles championship for the program's first individual title since 2014. \nThe Volunteers continued their run as a national power in the 2022 season, where they defeated #12 Texas A&amp;M, #13 South Carolina, and #3 Baylor to advance to the ITA Indoor Championship. Despite losing to #4 TCU in the finals, Tennessee returned to the #1 overall ranking which they maintained for serval weeks. Despite struggling down the stretch and finishing 5th in the SEC with a conference record of 8-4, Tennessee made the semifinals of the SEC tournament and entered the NCAA tournament as the #6 overall seed. Hosting the first three rounds, the Vols defeated Tennessee Tech, Duke, and Florida State to advance to the NCAA final site destination hosted by Illinois. In the Elite 8, Tennessee got revenge from the previous season against #3 Baylor by winning 4-3, sending the Vols to the Final Four for the second consecutive season. There, eventual national champion and #7 seed Virginia ended the teams hope for their first national title. Tennessee finished with a final record of 26-8.\n2023 saw the Vols return to the ITA Indoor Championships for the 3rd consecutive year, where they lost 4-3 in a re-match of the 2022 NCAA semifinals with #5 Virginia before defeating #17 Stanford and Illinois in consolation rounds. In other notable non-conference matches, Tennessee lost to #5 Michigan Wolverines(4-1), and #14 Wake Forest (4-3), but defeated #9 Columbia (4-1). The Vols recorded ranked SEC wins over #12 Mississippi State (5-2), #4 Kentucky (4-0), #20 Florida (4-3), #5 South Carolina (6-1), and #25 Ole Miss (6-1). A pair of narrow 4-3 loses to #14 Auburn and #10 Georgia, put Tennessee at 2nd in the SEC with a 10-2 conference record. In the SEC Tournament, the second seeded Volunteers beat No. 7 seed Ole Miss, before falling in the semifinals to the No. 3 seed and eventual tournament champion, #5 Kentucky 4-3. The Vols were selected as a regional host site for the 4th year in a row, defeating Belmont and Wake Forest to advance to the Super Regionals. At the Knoxville Super Regional, the season came to an end with a close 4-2 loss to the No. 9 seed South Carolina.\nHead coaches.\nSource\nYearly record.\nSource\nNCAA Tournament Results.\nIn the NCAA Tournament, Tennessee holds a 56-31 record overall, including a 27-1 record when hosting the first two rounds in Knoxville.

Because the NCAA does not have a set standard number of games that each team must play, the scoring champion skews towards some teams rather than others (The Ivy League teams, for instance, do not start their seasons until almost a month after the official start of the NCAA season). Additionally, points scored in both conference and league tournament games are included, slanting the scoring titles towards players on teams that perform the best in the postseason.\nSeveral Players have won the league scoring title multiple times but only Phil Latreille has led the NCAA in scoring three separate times. Impressively, Latreille did so by averaging more than 4 points per game in each of the three seasons.\nAward winners.\nSource:\nSee also.\nCollege ice hockey statistics"

        "text": "Ian Harrison is a male former international table tennis player from England.\nTable tennis career.\nHe began playing table tennis at the age of 12 after asking for a table tennis set for Christmas, and soon after joined Cheltenham Spa T.T.C. Only a few years later, aged 15 he won the English Open Junior Boys Singles. That same season he was picked to play for England for the first time, in a friendly match against France.\nThe following year, 1957, he was picked for the higher level Swaythling Cup team to play at the World Championship in Stockholm. He competed at the World Table Tennis Championships, in the Swaythling Cup at six consecutive tournaments from 1957 to 1967.\nIn 1960 he won the English Open, the first English born men's winner for 36 years. That year Harrison also won the English Closed title, becoming the first player to win both the \"Open\" and \"Closed\" singles titles.\nThroughout his career Harrison had some notable international victories, including against Ichiro Ogimura from Japan in the World Championships of 1961 and three times World Champion, China’s Chuang Tse-Tung (Zhuang Zedong).\nIn 1959 a major change in table tennis came in the form of new bat technology: from pimpled rubber to sandwich rubber. This new material  enabled more, sometimes excessive, spin to be used and completely changed the game, greatly favoring more attacking styles. Harrison who had excelled as a  defensive player tried hard to adapt but never fully succeeded in making the change. In addition, an increasingly busy personal life (he now had a young son) meant he wasn't able to put in the required practice and so Ian Harrison decided, whilst still at the top, to retire from table tennis saying \"'Why did you retire? is a much nicer question than 'Why don't you retire?'\"\nDespite the issue of the game change, Harrison remained in the English team for another six years and won the English Closed Singles one more time in 1967. He won the English Closed Men's Doubles five times in 1960, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1968. He also won at mixed doubles, once in the English Open (1960) and once in the English Closed (1964).\nBefore he retired it was well recognized that Harrison had dominated English table tennis for years. Harrison was, and still is, the only player ever to have won all three of the English Open Men's singles, Junior Boys and the English Closed Men's singles. Throughout his entire career from 1957 to 1967 he played each year for England in every major championship: The World Table Tennis Championships and the Europeans. In total he played 178 times for England, won eight English National Table Tennis Championships, won over 100 Open titles around the world, and was England number one for 7 years."

        "title": "Canadian Elite Basketball League",
        "text": "The Canadian Elite Basketball League (CEBL; ) is the premier men's professional basketball league in Canada, as recognized by Canada Basketball. The CEBL was founded in 2017 and began play in 2019 with six teams all owned and operated by ownership group Canadian Basketball Ventures.\nThe league currently consists of 10 teams from six provinces, with four from Ontario, two from Alberta, and one each from British Columbia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Quebec, making the CEBL the largest professional sports league based entirely in Canada. CEBL teams play 20 regular-season games from May to August. The season culminates in the six-team playoffs that include a final four Championship Weekend where the league's champion is crowned.\nHistory.\nThe CEBL was first announced in October 2017. Niagara River Lions owner Richard Petko had been dissatisfied with the operations of the National Basketball League of Canada, which he deemed to be a \"shoestring business\" with no vision. He attempted to persuade the league to hire Mike Morreale, a former Canadian Football League player who, Petko felt, could do better at marketing the league and attracting sponsorship. However, after the NBL declined, Petko and Morreale decided to organize their own league, with Morreale as CEO. The six charter teams were officially unveiled in May 2018, with the River Lions joining five newly-created franchises in Abbotsford which moved to Langley in 2021, Edmonton, Guelph, Hamilton, and Saskatoon.\nMorreale stated that the CEBL would emphasize offering a \"party wrapped around a basketball game\" with \"a ton of value for the fans\" in order to attract spectators, including outdoor pre-game events, in-arena entertainment, autograph sessions, and other features. The CEBL will, initially, operate as a single entity, with all teams owned by the league under individual general managers. However, the league may spin out its franchises to individual owners, or a single investor, in the future.\nIn December 2018, the CEBL reached a five-year deal with New Era to be the official apparel provider of the league. The CEBL also reached an official agreement with Canada Basketball for it to be recognized as its first division professional league (in a league system akin to European competition); this endorsement also allows the CEBL access to resources from the governing body. Canada Basketball CEO Glen Grunwald stated that the league would provide an \"exciting new product and a further development opportunity for Canadian players, coaches, referees, administrators and management types.\" Due to this agreement, the league plays under the standard FIBA rules.\nIn January 2019, the CEBL announced a three-year agreement with Spalding to be the official ball of the league.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 CEBL season was postponed, and conducted as a shortened tournament in a bio-secure bubble behind closed doors, branded as the \"CEBL Summer Series\". Beginning in the 2020 season, the CEBL adopted the Elam Ending—as recently popularized by The Basketball Tournament and the NBA All-Star Game—for all games, under which the game clock is turned off near the end of the fourth quarter, and teams play to a target score to determine the winner.\nIn the 2021–22 season, the Edmonton Stingers represented Canada in the Basketball Champions League Americas (BCLA).\nExpansion.\nIn November 2019, the Ottawa Blackjacks were announced as the league's first expansion team, and seventh overall, beginning in the 2020 season.\nIn February 2021, Morreale announced that an expansion team in Montreal would be added no earlier than the 2022 season; due to COVID-19, no new expansion teams were added for the 2021 season. Later in 2021, the Scarborough Shooting Stars, the Montreal Alliance, and the Newfoundland Growlers were all announced as expansion teams for the 2022 season.\nIn November 2022, the league announced that the Winnipeg Sea Bears would join the CEBL beginning with the 2023 season, while the Newfoundland Growlers would be suspending operations. In August 2022, the league announced that the Guelph Nighthawks would be relocating to Calgary, Alberta as the Calgary Surge.\nIn August 2023, the CEBL Clash was played at the Videotron Centre in Quebec City. It was an all-star game between top players from the Eastern and Western Conferences. The event was done in partnership with Gestev, a subsidiary of Quebecor Sports and Entertainment Group. Upon announcing the CEBL Clash, it was confirmed that Gestev is seriously considering support for an expansion team in Quebec City for 2024 based on the success of the event. The CEBL Clash attracted over 7,000 spectators. Another team in the West will join along with the unnamed Quebec City team to keep the conferences balanced.\nOrganization.\nExecutives.\n, league executives include:\nPlayers.\nThe CEBL's main focus will be on showcasing and developing Canadian talent in basketball: at least 70% of each team's roster must consist of Canadian players. As it will be played over the spring and summer months, the CEBL also sought to attract players wanting to continue developing their game over the traditional offseason period. Players were expected to be drawn from collegiate alumni (including U Sports and U.S. NCAA basketball), players with experience in other international leagues, as well as members of the Canadian national team.\nThe salary cap is $8,000 per team per game.\nBroadcasting.\nDuring the first season, games were primarily streamed on an in-house platform known as CEBL.tv; the league stated that it would provide the necessary means for each team to produce \"a really good official and professional looking live stream that we can share without any kind of limitations to who can see it.\" The league considered the possibility of selling television rights to its championship to a traditional broadcaster. On June 12, 2019, the CEBL announced that CBC Sports would stream all remaining games of the inaugural season on its digital platforms. It subsequently announced in November 2019 that CBC Sports had agreed to a three-year deal, which will also see eight games (seven regular-season games and the championship game) per-season aired on CBC Television.\nFor the 2020 season, the CEBL also began streaming games on Twitch. On August 7, the CEBL and Mediapro announced new rights deals in the Asia-Pacific and Oceania regions, such as Astro (Malaysia), Fox Sports Australia, SingTel, Sportscast (Taiwan), and TapGo (Philippines).\nA feature length documentary about the 2020 \"Summer Series\", produced by Ward 1 Studios, was broadcast May 29, 2021 on CBC.\nAhead of the 2023 season, the CEBL announced a broadcast rights agreement with Bell Media. Games will air on TSN in English and RDS in French, with a \"game of the week\" package on TSN throughout the season, RDS particularly carrying Montreal Alliance games, and all games streaming on TSN+."

This will be the second time the final will be held in England in the era of the current Challenge Cup, and the 12th including finals of the original Challenge Cup.\nTeams.\nA total of 20 teams qualified for the 2018–19 European Rugby Challenge Cup; 18 qualified from across the Gallagher Premiership, Guinness Pro14 and Top 14, as a direct result of their domestic league performance, with two qualifying through the Continental Shield competition. Subject to the allocation of the 20th place in the 2018–19 Champions Cup as per EPCR rules, the distribution of teams was:\nThe following clubs qualified for the Challenge Cup.\nQualifying competition – European Rugby Continental Shield.\nThe qualification tournament was reformatted as a competition in its own right, the European Rugby Continental Shield, in 2017. Eight teams were split into two pools of four to compete in the pool stage of the European Rugby Continental Shield. Each team played the four teams in the other pool once. The winner of each pool then played-off against the runner-up of the other pool. The winners of these two qualifying play-offs played each other in a two-legged play-off for a place in the Challenge Cup.\nThe two Russian teams who had competed in the 2017–18 tournament played each other in a two-legged qualifying play-off for a place in the Challenge Cup. The winners of the two qualifying play-offs, having both qualified for the Challenge Cup, then played each other in the European Rugby Continental Shield final in May 2018.\nIneligible teams.\nHeidelberger RK were due to become the first German club to take part in either of the two major European rugby union competitions after qualification from the 2017–18 European Rugby Continental Shield. However, they were ruled ineligible by EPC Rugby due to their primary financial backer, Hans-Peter Wild, also being the majority shareholder in Stade Français and therefore being in a position to influence two teams in the competition.\nTimișoara Saracens, who had been eliminated by Heidelberger RK at the Continental Shield semi-final stage (effectively the Challenge Cup play-off) were confirmed as their replacement on 11 June 2018.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe 20 competing teams were seeded and split into four tiers; seeding was based on performance in their respective domestic leagues. Where promotion and relegation is in effect in a league, the promoted team was seeded last, or (if multiple teams are promoted) by performance in the lower competition.\nTeams are taken from a league in order of rank and put into a tier. A draw is used to allocate two second seeds to Tier 1; the remaining team goes into Tier 2. This allocation indirectly determines which fourth-seeded team entered Tier 2, while the others enter Tier 3.\nGiven the nature of the Continental Shield — a competition including developing rugby nations and Italian clubs not competing in the Pro14 — the two qualifiers from that competition were automatically included in Tier 4 and are seeded equally, despite officially being ranked 1 and 2 from that competition.\nThe brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 20 June 2018 in the Olympic Museum, Lausanne, Switzerland.\nTeams in the same pool play each other twice, both at home and away in the group stage started in October 2018, and continues through to January 2019. The pool winners and three best runners-up progressed to the quarter-finals.\nTeams are awarded competition points, based on match result. Teams receive four points for a win, two points for a draw, one attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and one defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers will be used, as directed by EPCR:\nKnock-out stage.\nFormat.\nThe eight qualifiers are ranked according to their performance in the pool stage and compete in the quarter-finals which will be held on the weekend of 28–31 March 2019. The four top teams will host the quarter-finals against the four lower teams in a 1v8, 2v7, 3v6 and 4v5 format.\nThe semi-finals will be played on the weekend of 19–21 April 2019. As in recent seasons, a fixed semi-final bracket is set in advance. However, beginning this season the higher-seeded team will host each semi-final regardless of whether they won their quarter-final at home or on the road.\nThe winners of the semi-finals will contest the final, at St James' Park, on 10 May 2019.\nSeason records.\nTeam.\n111–3 Northampton Saints at home to Timișoara Saracens on 18 January 2019\n82–21 La Rochelle away to Enisei-STM on 13 October 2018\n111–3 Northampton Saints at home to Timișoara Saracens on 18 January 2019\nBristol Bears at home Enisei-STM on 19 January 2019\nNorthampton Saints at home to Timișoara Saracens on 18 January 2019\nLa Rochelle away to Zebre on 19 January 2018\nClermont at home to Harlequins on 20 April 2019\nPlayer.\n Maxime Lafage for La Rochelle away to Enisei-STM on 13 October 2018&lt;br&gt;\n Andy Uren for Bristol Bears at home Enisei-STM on 19 January 2019\n Andy Uren for Bristol Bears at home Enisei-STM on 19 January 2019\n James Grayson for Northampton Saints at home to Timișoara Saracens on 18 January 2019&lt;br&gt;\n Callum Sheedy for Bristol Bears at home Enisei-STM on 19 January 2019\n Ihaia West for La Rochelle away to Zebre on 19 January 2019\n Camille Lopez for Clermont at home to Harlequins on 20 April 2019\nAttendances.\nClermont versus La Rochelle on 10 May 2019 (Final)\nEnisei-STM at home to Bristol Bears on 12 January 2019\nClermont\nEnisei-STM"

        "text": "The 1901 Metropolitan Rugby Union season was the 28th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. It was the second season run for clubs that represented a district. Eight clubs (seven representing a district, the remaining club representing Sydney University) competed from May till August 1901. The season culminated in the second district premiership, which was won by Glebe and Sydney University. Both teams had finished the season at the top of the premiership table and as a result were to play a final to determine the Premiership. However, both clubs decided not to play a final resulting in both being declared joint premiers.\nTeams.\nEight clubs contested the season; seven clubs representing a district and one club representing Sydney University.\nSeason Summary.\nThe 1901 Sydney Rugby Premiership was deemed the greatest season ever seen in Sydney up to that time. Public interest was never before so keen with proceeds for the matches far exceeding previous seasons. The standard of play had improved with a new group of young players joining the senior grade teams and being chosen to play in representative matches.\nAt the end of the season, the two clubs Glebe and Sydney University finished tied at the top of the table. As per the rules of the period, the two teams were to face each other in a final to determine the premiership. To the disappointment of the public, both clubs decided not to play the final and were thus declared joint premiers. Both clubs had lost key players to the tour of New Zealand.\nIt was difficult to pick which of the two premiers were the better team. Both teams displayed consistency during the season. University winning 5 games in the first round and 5 in the second round. Together, three-quarters Harry Blaney, Arthur Fisher and Andrew McDowell scored the majority of the points for the \"Varsity\". Glebe were unbeaten in the second round of games and were considered to have a better forward pack. Unfortunately during the season they had the higher injury toll affecting their back line.\nAt the conclusion of the season, the football world was shocked by the sudden death of Western Suburbs captain, William Shortland. Shortland had only just returned from the rugby tour of New Zealand on Friday, 13 September. In the early hours of Tuesday, 17 September he succumbed to a, \"cold of the kidneys\" He was only 26 years of age.\nLower Grades.\nThe MRFU also conducted Second Grade and Third Grade competitions this season.\nSecond Grade.\nThe eight clubs that were participating in First Grade entered a team for the Second Grade competition. At the end of the regular season games, Glebe and Sydney University finished on the same points at the top of the ladder. In the final, University won 9 points to 6 and were thus declared Premiers. Newtown did not see out the season, withdrawing after two rounds.\nThird Grade.\nSeven of the First Grade clubs entered a team into the Third Grade competition. The only club missing was Western Suburbs. Balmain finished the season undefeated at the top of the ladder and were declared Premiers."

        "title": "Discrete skeleton evolution",
        "text": "Discrete Skeleton Evolution (DSE) describes an iterative approach to reducing a morphological or topological skeleton. It is a form of pruning in that it removes noisy or redundant branches (spurs) generated by the skeletonization process, while preserving information-rich \"trunk\" segments. The value assigned to individual branches varies from algorithm to algorithm, with the general goal being to convey the features of interest of the original contour with a few carefully chosen lines. Usually, clarity for human vision (aka. the ability to \"read\" some features of the original shape from the skeleton) is valued as well. DSE algorithms are distinguished by complex, recursive decision-making processes with high computational requirements. Pruning methods such as by structuring element (SE) convolution and the Hough transform are general purpose algorithms which quickly pass through an image and eliminate all branches shorter than a given threshold. DSE methods are most applicable when detail retention and contour reconstruction are valued.\nMethodology.\nPre-processing.\nInput images will typical contain more data than is necessary to generate an initial skeleton, and thus must be reduced in some way. Reducing the resolution, converting to grayscale, and then binary by masking or thresholding are common first steps. Noise removal may occur before and/or after converting an image to binary. Morphological operations such as closing, opening, and smoothing of the binary image may also be part of pre-processing. Ideally, the binarized contour should be as noise-free as possible before the skeleton is generated.\nSkeletonization.\nDSE techniques may be applied to an existing skeleton or incorporated as part of the skeleton growing algorithm. Suitable skeletons may be obtained using a variety of methods:\nSignificance Measures.\nDSE and related methods remove entire spurious branches while leaving the main trunk intact. The intended result is typically optimized for visual clarity and retention of information, such that the original contour can be reconstructed from the fully pruned skeleton. The value of various properties must be weighted by the application, and improving the efficiency is an ongoing topic of research in computer vision and image processing. Some significance measures include:\nIteration.\nEach branch is evaluated during a pass through the skeletonized image according to the specific algorithm being used. Low value branches are removed and the process is repeated until a desired threshold of simplicity is reached.\nReconstruction.\nIf all points on the output skeleton are the center points of maximal disks of the image and the radius information is retained, a contour image can be reconstructed\nApplications.\nHandwriting and text parsing.\nVariability in hand-written text is an ongoing challenge, simplification makes it somewhat easier for computer vision algorithms to make judgements about intended characters.\nSoft body classification (animals).\nThe maximal disks centered on the skeleton imply roughly spherical masses, the features of the extracted skeleton are relatively unchanged even as the soft body deforms or self-occludes. Skeleton information is one facet of determining whether two animals are the \"same\" some way, though it must usually be paired with another technique to effectively identify a target.\nMedical uses.\nInvestigation of organs, tissue damage and deformation caused by disease."
