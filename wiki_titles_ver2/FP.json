        "title": "Dalby Olympic Swimming Pool",
        "text": "Dalby Olympic Swimming Pool is a heritage-listed swimming pool at 58 Patrick Street, Dalby, Western Downs Region, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Clifford Ernest Plant and built in 1936. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 20 March 2008.\nHistory.\nThe Dalby Olympic Swimming Pool complex was constructed in 1936 and is the earliest identified Olympic standard pool in Queensland constructed outside Brisbane.\nDalby was one of the earliest European settlements on the Darling Downs. The township was surveyed in 1853, the first land sales took place in 1857, and the Town of Dalby was proclaimed a municipality in 1863.\nDalby has a long association with swimming as a sport. Initially, a swimming hole in Myall Creek was used, but in 1902 an artesian bore was sunk on the bank and baths were built nearby to take advantage of the bore water. The Dalby Amateur Swimming Club was formed in 1912. In 1920 a new bore was sunk and in 1924 a public baths (the Dalby Bore Baths) was constructed close to it. This facility closed in September 1938, possibly because the new Olympic Pool had supplanted it.\nFrom the 1910s, swimming as both a competitive and recreational sport gained rapidly in popularity in Queensland, and indeed, world-wide. In 1908 the Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA) was formed with the goals of standardising the rules for swimming, diving and water polo, obtaining control of world records, and ensuring the direction of Olympic Games competitions for swimming, diving and water polo.\nSwimming was given further impetus by the 1924 Olympic Games held in Paris. The Piscine des Tourelles, an 8-lane pool measuring in length by in width, was specially constructed for swimming events, setting the Olympic standards. Swimmers hoping to compete internationally now needed a pool of this size in order to practice effectively. The precise requirements to meet Olympic pool standards have since been refined and cover width, depth, and temperature and light densities.\nIn Brisbane, the Fortitude Valley Baths were rebuilt in 1925-1926 to the Olympic standard, being in length and wide. This pool no longer survives.\nBy the 1930s, swimming was a glamorous sport internationally, with sport and medal winners such as Duke Kahanamoku, Johnny Weissmuller and Buster Crabbe becoming Hollywood celebrities. In Sydney, four Olympic-standard pools were constructed in the 1930s, municipal councils taking advantage of loans and other financial incentives offered by a government keen to create work by encouraging civic building projects. The pool buildings and surrounds of the new Olympic pools were architect designed. A notable survivor is the North Sydney Olympic Pool Complex opened on 4 April 1936.\nDesign problems with the new large pools included the provision of adequate water filtration and the prevention of algae. The firm of AH Pierce &amp; Co., still associated with commercial pools, imported calcium hypochlorite from England and pool builders took a keen interest in others' pool designs. Pool facilities usually comprised an Olympic-standard pool for recreation and competitions, a smaller pool for children, diving tower, spectators' stand, men's and women's changing rooms and club meeting rooms.\nBy the early 1930s Dalby was experiencing renewed growth and prosperity, reflecting extensive land reclamation in the surrounding district in the wake of the eradication of the prickly pear cactus. This noxious weed had wasted thousands of hectares of agricultural and grazing land in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Annual Report of the Department of Public Lands identified Dalby, Chinchilla and Miles as the towns experiencing the most progress. Under the Intermittent Relief Scheme established during the Depression, the Department of Works remodelled and added to the Dalby State School. The Dalby Court House and Police Station were also built in the first half of the 1930s.\nIn 1933, Dalby Town Council formed an Olympic pool committee. The idea for a pool and tennis courts in Dalby had been suggested in correspondence to the Council by the Dalby Chamber of Commerce in 1931. The Dalby Town Council appointed William J Reinhold as the consulting engineer and Clifford E Plant as the architect. Plant is noted for the Kings Beach Bathing Pavilion and the Redcliffe Bathing Pavilions Group, designed and constructed in the 1930s.\nExcavation work commenced on 1 July 1936 and the first patrons were admitted late in October of that year, with 1550 people using the pool in the first weekend. The complex was completed at a cost of and was officially opened on 14 November 1936 by Frank Cooper, MLA, Minister for Public Instruction, before a crowd of approximately 2,000 people. Commending the Dalby Town Council on its initiative, Cooper commented that there was no town twice or even 10 times the size of Dalby that had a swimming pool like theirs.\nAt the time, the pool was the most modern in Queensland, using the latest filtration and chlorinating equipment to treat the artesian water used to fill the pools. In March 1938 the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alfred James Jones, visited Dalby with the Chairman of the Brisbane Parks and Baths committee in order to inspect it before planning similar pools for Brisbane, though it was some years before such plans were implemented.\nThe opening of the Dalby pool gave an impetus to regional swimming and a number of swimming clubs were formed including the Dalby and District Swimming and Life-Saving Club, and the association of the pool with community sports clubs continues. The first major swimming carnival was held in February 1937. During the Second World War, aircrew from No. 12 Squadron stationed nearby received their forced landing at sea training in the Dalby pool.\nThe 1956 Melbourne Olympics led to an increased interest in competition swimming and most surviving early Olympic pools in Australia date from the preparation for, or interest stemming from, these games. Between 1949 and 1960, Dalby district swimmers gained approximately 100 places in Queensland swimming and diving championships. The pool was visited and used by a number of famous Australian swimmers including Dawn Fraser, Murray Rose and members of the Konrad family. During 1957-8 the Dalby pool recorded an annual attendance of 143,167.\nThe original timber spectator stand for the pool was replaced by a concrete stand in 1971 and named for a former pool manager and coach, Arthur G Obst.\nIn 1983, the pool area underwent renovation. This work included the replacement of the circulation pipe work, the plant room and water treatment plant, the concrete concourses around the pool and the substitution of skimmer boxes for scum gutters. More recently, the pools have been lined with fibreglass and fibreglass features have been added to the children's pool.\nThe Dalby Pool Complex remains the venue for large swimming carnivals, one of which, the Dalby Open, attracted 1734 nominations in 2002.\nDescription.\nThe pool complex is in a parkland setting to the rear of Dalby War Memorial and Gates and adjacent to Myall Creek. It is part of a large recreational precinct which includes a lawn bowls club and croquet club.\nThe open-air pool complex is approached from Patrick Street by twin paths that divide behind the war memorial, to which the pool pavilion forms a backdrop. A formal arrangement of garden beds and flagpoles fills this space.\nThe symmetrically placed entry pavilion is a single storey rectangular building spanning the width of the pool complex. It has a hipped roof with gables at each end of the front and a central gabled porch leading to turnstiles and the pool area. This area contains granite panels commemorating the opening of the pool complex. The building is clad with weatherboards on the lower section with panels of fibrous cement sheeting above. It is lit by six pane casement windows. The south-east part of the building contains a service area and kiosk and club meeting rooms are located in the north-west end of the building.\nThe rear of the building also has a central gabled porch and a timber pergola over a paved area that separates the building from the pool.\nPositioned between the entry pavilion and the main pool, and at right-angles to the latter, is a children's pool measuring . It has recent additions of fibreglass rocks and play features. The main pool measures . Concrete concourses and lawns surround the pool and a spectators' stand is positioned along one side, with changing rooms beneath. There is a brick plant room at the far end of the pool.\nAlso located within the pool complex grounds is a pool caretaker's residence. This is a small, high-set, timber cottage with an enclosed front verandah.\nThe Arthur G Obst Stand is not the original structure and is not considered significant for heritage purposes.\nHeritage listing.\nDalby Swimming Pool Complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 20 March 2008 having satisfied the following criteria.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\nThe Dalby Swimming Pool complex, constructed and opened in 1936, is important in demonstrating the development of competition swimming in Queensland. As an Olympic standard pool built in the 1930s, it illustrates the surge of public interest both in competitive and recreational swimming during the interwar period. As a facility which demonstrated how artesian water might be used to the advantage of a community, the Dalby Swimming Pool also is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history. It is also important in illustrating the 1930s expansion of civic work in the former prickly pear belt, following the eradication of this pest in the late 1920s and early 1930s. As land cleared of prickly pear cactus was utilised for agriculture, grazing and dairying, towns throughout the prickly pear belt, especially Dalby, Chinchilla and Miles, experienced renewed growth and prosperity.\nThe place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.\nThe Dalby Swimming Pool complex is rare as the earliest identified surviving Olympic-sized swimming pool complex in Queensland. It is the earliest known Olympic Pool complex constructed in Queensland outside Brisbane, and retains its two pools (competition and children's), entrance pavilion, and caretaker's residence.\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\nThe Dalby Swimming Pool Complex has a strong association with the community of Dalby and the surrounding area as an important sports venue for swimming events, enabling Dalby swimmers access to wider Australian competition, and has at times attracted Australian/international swimming stars."

His nonprofit focuses on the personal and social development of its participants by encouraging them to do what they love, be involved in community engagement, interact in positive social change and develop valuable attributes and characteristics that will help them thrive individually and communally as young adults and responsible citizens.\nThe AI3 Leadership Academy was created by Ireland and childhood friend, Joe Summa, with the intention of bridging people of all backgrounds within the Waterbury community through basketball. This foundation was a response to the deteriorating of outdoor courts in the Waterbury area, and to give the youth a physical place to play basketball. The 2019 AI3 Skills camp had an attendance of over 200 kids, helping to fulfill Ireland's vision."

Against West Virginia University, he tallied 9 tackles, one sack and 2 forced fumbles, including the one that set up the winning field goal in Pittsburgh's 6-3 win. He made a season-high 10 tackles in the upset 30–22 win against the University of Notre Dame. He had a memorable play against Penn State University, when he returned an interception 69 yards to seal a 10-0 victory with 42 seconds remaining in the game. It was Pitt's first shutout over Penn State since 1955 (a 20-0 victory).\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOwens was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the tenth round (263rd overall) of the 1988 NFL Draft.

        "title": "2005 Belmont Stakes",
        "text": "The 2005 Belmont Stakes was the 137th running of the Belmont Stakes. The race, known as the \"test of the champion\" and sometimes called the \"final jewel\" in thoroughbred horse racing's Triple Crown series. It was held on June 11, 2005, three weeks after the Preakness Stakes and five weeks after the Kentucky Derby.\nIn 2005, the Kentucky Derby was won by long-shot Giacomo while the Preakness Stakes was won by Afleet Alex. Therefore, there was no Triple Crown at stake, which caused a sharp decline in attendance from the year before when Smarty Jones was attempting to sweep the three races. The race proved fairly uneventful, with favorite Afleet Alex winning by seven lengths and stamping himself as the top three-year-old in the nation. Longshots finished in the next three places, resulting in high payouts for the trifecta and superfecta.\nPre-race.\nGiacomo won the 2005 Kentucky Derby in a major upset at odds of 50-1. Afleet Alex, who had finished third in the Derby, rebounded to win the Preakness Stakes despite nearly falling when another horse swerved into his path at the head of the stretch. Afleet Alex was favored to win the Belmont, with morning line odds set at 6-5 while Giacomo was the second choice at 4-1. The third choice at 6-1 was Reverberate, who had finished second in his previous start in the Peter Pan Stakes. The other horses in the field were all at double digit odds. Trainer Nick Zito entered three horses in the Belmont, having already entered five in the Derby and three in the Preakness without finishing in the money. Andromeda's Hero was considered to have the best chance, having finished eighth in the Derby and with an excellent pedigree for the taxing distance. \nAfleet Alex arrived at Belmont Park on June 4. His trainer Tim Ritchey focused on long exercise sessions to build up the colt's stamina, including two gallops on the Wednesday before the race when the colt galloped a total of miles. Meanwhile, various racetracks across the country agreed to set up Alex's Lemonade Stands on Belmont day to raise money for pediatric cancer research. The charity was set up by a young girl, Alex Scott, and had come to the attention of Afleet Alex's owners. By the end of 2005, over $4 million had been raised. By 2015, the fundraising has surpassed $100 million, and the publicity associated with Afleet Alex's Triple Crown run was a major factor in the continued success.\nA \"docile\" crowd of 62,274 showed up to watch the race. The previous year, a record crowd of over 120,000 had attended to watch Smarty Jones attempt to sweep the Triple Crown.\nRace description.\nLongshot Pinpoint went to the early lead and set a slow pace, with Afleet Alex sitting back in eighth place. His jockey, Jeremy Rose, had been cautioned about making his move too early – a common mistake for young jockeys not familiar with the dimensions of Belmont Park. \"He was the best horse\", he said. \"I knew that if I didn't do something stupid, I was going to win this race. He's just that good.\"\nHis biggest challenger, Giacomo, raced just a few lengths behind the early leaders, a change from his normal come-from-behind tactics. His jockey Mike Smith explained that the horse had \"flipped his palate\" before the start of the race, which obstructed his breathing. \"I could hear (a roaring sound) into the gate\", said Smith, \"and it got louder during the race.\" By being closer to the pace, Smith hoped to conserve energy and get a jump on Afleet Alex. Giacomo moved to the lead at the top of the stretch but then tired, eventually finishing seventh.\nAfleet Alex continued to rate near the back of the pack for the first miles then unleashed a \"devastating\" kick around the far turn. He quickly hit the lead and continued to draw away down the stretch, winning by seven lengths. He ran the final quarter mile in 24.50 seconds, the fastest closing fraction since Arts and Letters in 1969. \"We expected this kind of performance\", said Ritchey. \"I wasn't surprised he was that far back, but when he got rolling, it was a lot of fun.\"\nAndromeda's Hero and Nolan's Cat used similar tactics to Afleet Alex but could not match his acceleration. Andromeda's Hero moved from 10th place early in the race to finish 2nd, while Nolan's Cat closed from 11th to 3rd. \"I stayed comfortable in good position, trying to stay close to Afleet Alex,\" said Rafael Bejarano, the jockey of Andromeda's Hero. \"When he moved at the three-eighths pole, I followed him, and when I asked my horse at the quarter pole, my horse started running strong. But Afleet Alex just ran away.\"\nDue to the slow early pace, the final time was a modest 2:28.75.\nChart.\nSource: Equibase&lt;br&gt;\nTimes: – 0:24.47; – 0:48.62; – 1:12.92; mile – 1:38.05; – 2:02.45; final – 2:28.75.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:24.47) (:24.15) (:24.30) (:25.13) (:26.20) (:24.50)\nPayout.\nThe 137th Belmont Payout Schedule"

        "text": "The Fiji women's national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Fiji in international Women's cricket matches. Fiji has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1965. The national women's team made its international debut against Samoa in 2010 and its Women's Twenty20 International (T20I) debut in 2019. It is included in the ICC East Asia-Pacific development region.\nHistory.\nCricket was introduced to Fiji by European settlers in 1874, and the native population began taking up the game in 1878. The governor of Fiji at the time listed introducing cricket to the native Fijians as one of the achievements of his tenure in his memoirs.\nThe Fiji women's cricket team came into existence some time in the middle of 2009. In January 2010, Cricket Fiji announced its first international series would take place against Samoa the following month. Fiji's first international match was played against Samoa on 2 February 2010 at Faleata Oval, Apia. The Fijian captain for the team's inaugural tour was former New Zealand international Losi Harford, who scored 57 runs opening the batting as Fiji lost to Samoa by six runs on debut.\nIn January 2011, Cricket Fiji announced its women's team's second tour. This one was to Vanuatu.\nIn April 2018, the ICC granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members, with all Twenty20 matches played between Fiji women and other international sides after 1 July 2018 having the full T20I status. Fiji made its T20I debut at the 2019 ICC Women's Qualifier EAP in Vanuatu, losing all five matches. The team's next T20I appearances came in the 2019 Pacific Games in Samoa, again failing to win ay games.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. Fiji were named in the 2021 ICC Women's T20 World Cup EAP Qualifier regional group, alongside seven other teams. However, the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFiji lost 19 consecutive T20I matches between its debut in 2019 and its inaugural T20I victory against Samoa in the 2023 Women's Pacific Island Cricket Challenge. This surpassed the previous record of 15 consecutive defeats held by Bangladesh.\nCurrent Squad.\n\"Updated as on 21 January 2024\"\nThis lists all the players who played for Fiji in the past 12 months or were named in the most recent squad.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Fiji Women\n\"Last updated 21 January 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Fiji Women\nMost T20I wickets for Fiji Women\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to WT20I #1741.

Finally, on August 3, 2016, all five sports (counting baseball and softball together as one sport) were approved for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic program. One of the biggest obstacles for skateboarding for an inclusion at the Olympics was that huge injuries in skateboarding were so risky (which can include death) and the IOC was less likely to take liabilities. Also the skateboarding sub-culture helped push the idea that the Olympic Games were too \"mainstream\" for the sport, and as a result skateboarding organizations did not campaign heavily to put the sport in the Olympic Games.\nMedal table.\nSources:"

The race, known as the \"test of the champion\" and sometimes called the \"final jewel\" in thoroughbred horse racing's Triple Crown series, was held on June 7, 2003, three weeks after the Preakness Stakes and five weeks after the Kentucky Derby.\nNew York-bred Funny Cide won the Derby and Preakness and attracted an enthusiastic following. Before a near-record crowd, Funny Cide's attempt to win the Triple Crown was derailed by Empire Maker, who had finished second as the favorite in the Derby and had skipped the Preakness to train up to the Belmont.\nPre-race.\nFunny Cide won the 2003 Kentucky Derby in an upset, then turned in a dominating performance to win the Preakness. For the Belmont he faced only five other horses, but all of them were more rested. In particular, Empire Maker had skipped the Preakness after finishing second in the Derby as the favorite. He was considered to have an excellent chance in the Belmont, having beaten Funny Cide earlier in the year in the Wood Memorial. \nA crowd of 101,562 showed up despite the cold, rainy weather. It was a near-record for Belmont Park, just behind the 2002 attendance of 103,222 that watched Sarava upset War Emblem's Triple Crown bid.\nRace description.\nFunny Cide broke well and went to the early lead. Although he set reasonable fractions, the jockeys in the race saw cause for concern. José A. Santos on Funny Cide felt the horse was not handling the sloppy track, while Jerry Bailey on Empire Maker felt Funny Cide was running rank, wasting valuable energy. Funny Cide led for the first mile but tired around the far turn where he was passed by Empire Maker. Ten Most Wanted made a late run to finish second, while Funny Cide held on for third.\nDespite a Hall of Fame career, it was the first win in a Triple Crown race for trainer Robert Frankel. \"I really wanted to win it, more so for the horse,\" said Frankel. \"I just wanted to prove he was the best horse. I was very, very confident all week. I didn't think I could get beat.\"\nFunny Cide became the ninth horse since Affirmed in 1978 to win the first two legs of the Triple Crown, only to fall short in the Belmont. \"I am very proud for all of the New Yorkers, Spanish people and New York-bred people who came out to support this horse today,\" said Santos said. \"To win the Triple Crown is very difficult. That is why it has been 25 years since somebody did it.\"\nChart.\nSource: Equibase&lt;br&gt;\nTimes: — 0:23.85; — 0:48.70; — 1:13.51; mile — 1:38.05; — 2:02.62; final — 2:28.26.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:23.85) (:24.85) (:24.81) (:24.54) (:24.57) (:25.64)\nPayout.\nThe 135th Belmont Payout Schedule\nThere was no Superfecta betting.

        "title": "Ice hockey in Canada",
        "text": "Ice hockey, simply referred to as \"hockey\" in both English and French in Canada, dates back to the 19th century. The sport is very popular and played year-round and at every level in the country. Born of various influences from stick-and-ball games brought from the United Kingdom and indigenous games, the contemporary sport of ice hockey originated in Montreal. It is the official national winter sport of Canada. Hockey is widely considered Canada's national pastime, with high levels of participation by children, men, and women at various levels of competition.\nHistory.\nThe game of ice hockey has its roots in the various stick-and-ball games played over the centuries in the United Kingdom, and North America. From prior to the establishment of Canada, Europeans are recorded as having played versions of field hockey and its relatives, while the Mi'kmaq indigenous peoples of the Maritimes also had a ball-and-stick game, and made many hockey sticks used by Europeans in the 1800s. Similarly, ice skating team games which eventually became the organized sport of bandy were also played. From these roots, the contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in Montreal, where the first indoor hockey game was played on March 3, 1875, at the Victoria Skating Rink, organized by James Creighton, a McGill University student from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained. The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) later adopted the Canadian rules as the official rules of ice hockey.\nAnnual championships began in Montreal in the 1880s, leading to the awarding of the Stanley Cup, considered the oldest trophy in North American sports. Lord Stanley of Preston was appointed by Queen Victoria to be the Governor General of Canada on June 11, 1888. While governor, ice hockey was still just forming in Canada. He first got to see the game of hockey played at Montreal's 1889 Winter Carnival. During the carnival he watched the Montreal Victorias play the Montreal Hockey Club. Afterwards, Stanley and his family became very involved in the game of ice hockey. His two sons, Arthur and Algernon, convinced their father to donate a trophy that would be considered to be a visible sign of the ice hockey championship, which was a silver bowl inlaid with gold. The trophy was first presented in 1893 and was called the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup. The name of the trophy has since been known as the Stanley Cup. Several traditions remain from early amateur play, including hand-shakes between opposing teams after a championship match.\nProfessionalism began in the 1890s, with players being paid under the table in various sports, including ice hockey and lacrosse. Openly professional leagues emerged after 1900. Five cities in the United States and Ontario formed the International Professional Hockey League (IPHL) in 1904. The American-based league was the beginning of professional ice hockey. The IPHL attracted high-end Canadian players, depriving Canada of some of its best players. Other early professional play took place in Northern Ontario (the Timiskaming League) and in the Maritimes (the Coloured Hockey League). Although many Canadian amateur teams paid their players under the table, most Canadian hockey associations still stuck to the codes of amateurism. The IPHL ceased after three years, but that was long enough to spark the creation of a Canadian-based professional league, the Ontario Professional Hockey League, in 1908. Though some believe the IHL's short existence was due to lack of spectator interest, the primary reason the league failed was a loss of good players back to Canadian teams that by 1906 played in hockey associations, such as the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association, that allowed professionals to play alongside amateurs. The National Hockey Association was formed in 1910, leading to the National Hockey League in 1917. The Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs are two of the NHL's Original Six franchises, and its two most successful; the Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup 24 times, and the Maple Leafs 13.\nThe violence of the sport instigated the Ottawa Silver Seven and Montreal Wanderers rivalry of 1907. Newspapers described hockey as a combination of \"brutal butchery\" and \"strenuous spectacle,\" speaking to public perceptions and different ways of experiencing the game. Ideals of respectable, middle-class masculinity and rough, working-class masculinity co-existed within accounts of fast, skilled, rugged, hard-hitting hockey.\nDuring the 1920s, the Winnipeg's senior hockey league champions for the 1919-20 season, the Winnipeg Falcons, featuring the Icelandic Canadians, became Canadian national champions and won the 1920 Olympic gold medal for Canada in Antwerp. With their devotion to Canada in World War I, their integration made this team a symbol of Canadian masculinity, unaffected by the ethnic stereotyping and discrimination that affected some other sports teams during the 1920s.\nDuring the Great Depression, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association was forced to re-evaluate its position on amateurism in hockey and to assess its relationship to the amateur sports infrastructure in Canada, which was headed by the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada. The lacklustre performance of the Canadian national hockey team at the 1936 Olympics, over player availability forced radical changes on approaches to how the game was formulated in the country.\nThe Canadian national men's team dominated international amateur play from the 1920s until the early 1950s, when the introduction of state-sponsored national ice hockey programs, notably from the Soviet Union, began to dominate over the club-based Canadian program. Canada would change to a national team composed of amateurs and eventually withdraw from international senior-level competition in a dispute over the introduction of professionals, considered Canada's best, to counter the dominance and provide an \"even playing field\" in the eyes of Canadian ice hockey officials.\nIn September 1972, Canada's best hockey players from the National Hockey League (NHL) played the elite amateurs from the Soviet Union in an exhibition series. When Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau had met his Soviet counterpart, Alexei Kosygin, in 1971, their discussions included increasing the hockey competitions between the two countries. Soon after, hockey hierarchies of both nations decided on a series of eight games, four to be played across Canada and four in Moscow. For Canadians, the Summit Series was intended to be a celebration of their global supremacy in ice hockey. The architects of Soviet hockey, on the other hand, had designs on surprising Canada and the world with their skill and claiming the Canadian game as their own.\nThe Summit Series was the catalyst for a re-examination of the Canadian hockey system, organization, coaching, and training methods. The changes in Canadian ice hockey, along with the acceptance of professional players in international play, would eventually lead to a return to international competition in the 1990s, and an Olympic gold medal in 2002, Canada's first in fifty years. The 1990s also saw the introduction of international championships in women's ice hockey, with a Canadian national women's team formed, leading to Olympic participation, and the development of professional women's hockey.\nThe Hockey Hall of Fame, located in Toronto, Ontario, is the permanent home of many ice hockey trophies, including the Stanley Cup. The Hall also honours the greatest ice hockey players, inducting players annually. Some of the great Canadian hockey players honoured in the Hall include Wayne Gretzky, who holds many NHL scoring records; Maurice Richard, a hero in Quebec who led the Montreal Canadiens to eight Stanley Cups; Gordie Howe; and Bobby Orr, among many others.\nNational and international competitions.\nProminent trophies for national championships in Canada are the Memorial Cup for the top junior-age men's team and the Allan Cup for the top men's senior team. There are national championships in several other divisions of play. Hockey Canada is the sport's official governing body in Canada and is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). A Canadian national men's team, composed of professionals, competes in the annual IIHF Men's World Championship, the Spengler Cup invitational tournament, and the Olympics. Russia and the U.S. are considered Canada's major rivals.\nParticipation rates.\nIce hockey is one of the most played sports in the country at the youth level and remains popular for adults whether in organized professional, amateur or recreational leagues. Numerous tournaments are held annually, and ice hockey games are often part of winter carnivals, and many outdoor ice rinks are constructed for the winter season. In 2010, an estimated 1.3 million Canadian adults participated in ice hockey, second to golf.\nThe sport is the third-most popular sport among Canadian children. A 2010 survey estimated that 22% of households have a child playing ice hockey, while 25% of households have a child playing soccer, and 24% of households have a child participating in swimming. The sport faces increasing competition from other popular sports such as basketball and soccer,\n which have high participation rates. Another factor facing participation rates is the relative higher cost of hockey equipment. In 2013, the average cost of ice hockey equipment for youth was estimated at while basketball equipment cost $310 and soccer equipment cost $160.\nWomen's ice hockey.\nWomen's hockey in Canada is growing. However, it has a long history dating back to the nineteenth century. Women's shinny games were known to have been organized in Ontario as early as the 1880s, including at the behest of Lady Isobel, daughter of Lord Stanley. Women's hockey proliferated in the early 1900s, particularly at the collegiate level. The First World War provided an early opportunity for growth and a degree of professionalization. In Montreal, investors established the Eastern Ladies Hockey League in 1915, which regularly drew thousands of fans. The league was so popular that, in its first year, it hastily organized two additional teams to bring its total to six teams. Albertine Lapensée emerged as an early star player in this era. In Ottawa, the Alerts women's team found similar success, drawing thousands of fans and winning a \"world series\" in Pittsburgh over an American team called the Polar Milk Maids. However, the return of professional men's hockey after the war and the onset of the Great Depression together led to a slump in women's hockey, particularly at the professional level. One exception to this trend was the Preston Rivulettes, an Ontario team that dominated women's hockey through the 1930s. The Second World War further set women's hockey back.\nA major milestone in the women's game occurred in 1975 with the organization of the Ontario Women's Hockey Association by Fran Rider, which established infrastructure dedicated to growing the women's game. The establishment and success of the Edmonton Chimos women's team in the late 1970s and 1980s further created the impetus for the formation of a national women's championship, which first occurred in 1982.\nThe women's game then developed significantly at the international stage. In 1987, Rider led organizing the first, unofficial, Women's World Championship, which took place in Toronto and was won by Canada. In 1990, the International Ice Hockey Federation organized the first official Women's Worlds, which took place in Ottawa and was again won by Canada. The Canadian national team has been dominant on the international stage, and has formed an enduring rivalry with the United States. Women's hockey was featured at the Winter Olympics for the first time in 1998, and the Canadian and American teams have contested every Olympic final except for 2006, when Canada defeated Sweden in the final. Hayley Wickenheiser and Marie-Philip Poulin are the all-time leading women's Olympic scorers. Canada won the most recent Olympic tournament in 2022.\nTop-level and professional women's hockey has developed in starts and stops since the late twentieth century. The National Women's Hockey League (NWHL) launched in 1999, featuring teams mainly in Ontario and Quebec. Some teams from Western Canada competed intermittently, but a Western Women's Hockey League was formed in 2004. From the 2001–02 season to the 2012–13 season, female Hockey Canada registrations increased by 59%. The Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL) largely replaced the NWHL and ran for 12 seasons, from 2007 to 2019, with teams competing for the Clarkson Cup. The CWHL, which operated on a non-profit basis, did not pay player salaries, but it did at times offer stipends and bonuses, and it aspired to become a professional league. However, the league lacked financial stability, and folded in 2019. A new National Women's Hockey League, which did offer player salaries, was established in the United States in 2015, and it expanded into Canada in 2020 with the addition of the Toronto Six. However, after the collapse of the CWHL, hundreds of prominent women's players, including Canadian and American Olympians, founded the Professional Women's Hockey Players' Association (PWHPA) and opted to boycott existing leagues in pursuit of a unified, financially stable professional league.\nIn 2023, the NWHL—rebranded as the Premier Hockey Federation in 2021—was purchased and ultimately dissolved as part of the foundation of the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL), the unified league many players had been working towards. The league debuted in January 2024. Three of its six charter franchises are located in Canada in Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. Toronto hosted the inaugural PWHL game on January 1, 2024. The next day, a sold-out game at Ottawa's TD Place Arena between Ottawa and Montreal set a new attendance record for professional women's hockey with 8,318 fans.\nNational identity.\nIce hockey is considered a major component of Canadian culture and national identity.\nCanada's national game debate.\nIn May 1964, former Canadian Amateur Hockey Association president and then current member of parliament Jack Roxburgh did extensive research to find if Canadian parliament had ever declared a national game, and specifically looked into whether lacrosse was officially declared. After going through parliamentary records, he found no law was ever enacted. The Canadian Press reported at the time that the myth of lacrosse as Canada's national game possibly came from a book published in 1869 titled \"Lacrosse, the National Game of Canada\", and that the Canadian Lacrosse Association was founded in 1867. His endeavour to declare hockey as Canada's national game coincided with the Great Canadian Flag Debate. On October 28, 1964, Roxburgh moved to introduce Bill C–132, with respect to declaring hockey as the national game of Canada.\nCanadian Lacrosse Association members responded to the motion by calling it insulting and \"out of line\", and vowed to fight it. On June 11, 1965, Bob Prittie replied by introducing a separate bill to have lacrosse declared as Canada's national game and stated that, \"I think it is fitting at this time when we are considering national flags, national anthems and other national symbols, that this particular matter should be settled now\". The choice of Canada's national game was debated in 1965, but neither bill was passed when parliament was dissolved. In 1967, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson proposed to name national summer and winter games, but nothing was resolved. Finally in April 1994, Bill C–212 was passed to recognize hockey as Canada's official winter game, and lacrosse as its summer game."

Basketball is the second most popular sport in the United States (counting amateur levels), after American football. In terms of revenue, the NBA is the third most profitable sports league in the United States and the world, after the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB). Basketball was invented in 1891 by Canadian physical education teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts.\nNBA.\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world's premier men's professional basketball league and one of the major professional sports leagues of North America. It contains 30 teams (29 teams in the U.S. and 1 in Canada) that play an 82-game season from October to June. After the regular season, eight teams from each conference compete in the playoffs for the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy The NBA gets high ratings on television.\nRace and ethnicity.\nThe composition of race and ethnicity in the National Basketball Association (NBA) has changed throughout the league's history.\nBy 2020, 81.1% of players in the NBA are Black (if mixed are also counted as black), 17.9% white, 12.5% mixed race (mostly half-black half-white), and 1.1% of other races. The league has the highest percentage of Black players of any major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. As of 2020, the NBA's viewership appears to be predominantly Black and Hispanic.\nNational teams.\nSince the 1992 Summer Olympics, NBA players have represented the United States in international competition and won numerous important tournaments. The Dream Team was the unofficial nickname of the United States men's basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics. The Women's national team has won eight gold medals at the Olympics.\nHigh school Basketball.\nHigh school Basketball is a popular activity. The National Federation of State High School Associations featured 541,479 boys and 429,504 girls in basketball teams as of the 2014–15 season.\nMany high school basketball teams have intense local followings, especially in the Midwest and Upper South. Indiana has 10 of the 12 largest high school gyms in the United States, and is famous for its basketball passion, known as Hoosier Hysteria.\nCollege Basketball.\nCollege basketball is quite popular and draws TV high ratings. Every March, a 68-team, six-round, single-elimination tournament (commonly called March Madness) determines the national champions of NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament men's college basketball.\nWomen's Basketball.\nWomen's Basketball Association was the first attempt at a professional women's basketball league in 1984. The American Basketball League was one the first professional female leagues in the United States.\nThe Women's National Basketball Association or WNBA is an organization governing a professional basketball league for women in the United States. The WNBA was formed in 1996 as the women's counterpart to the National Basketball Association, and league play began in 1997. The regular WNBA season is June to September (North American Spring and Summer). Most WNBA teams play at the same venue as their NBA counterparts. The WNBA is the premier professional Basketball league for women in the world. Despite being the premier women's basketball league the WNBA struggles to attract a large mainstream audience. Women's NCAA Basketball is also popular, although less so than men's basketball.\nThe women's national team has won eight Olympic gold medals and ten FIBA World Cups."

        "title": "Ice hockey in the United States",
        "text": "Ice hockey, referred to in the US simply as \"hockey\", is a popular sport in the United States. Hockey in the US began in 1894 when the first artificial ice rink was built in Baltimore, Maryland. Now hockey is most popular in regions of the US with cold winter climates, such as the northeast and the upper Midwest. However, since the 1990s, ice hockey has become increasingly popular in the Sun Belt due in large part to the expansion of the National Hockey League to the southeast and southwest US, coupled with the mass relocation of many residents from northern cities with strong hockey support to these Sun Belt locations.\nHistory of ice hockey in the United States.\nThe contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in Montreal, Quebec, where the first indoor hockey game was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. The game soon spread south through Canadian immigrants, who played the stick and ball game referred to as \"shinny\" on frozen ponds and lakes in the winter. The first organized game of this precursor to modern ice hockey in the United States was on November 17, 1883 on the Lower School Pond of St. Paul's School in Concord, NH. The first known formal game of ice hockey in the United States was subsequently played between Yale University and Johns Hopkins University in 1893, and is generally considered to be the start of present-day ice hockey in the nation.\nIn 1894, the first artificial ice rink was built in Maryland. The rink was called the North Avenue Ice Palace, which was located in Baltimore, Maryland. A few years later, in 1896, the first ice hockey league in the United States was formed called The US Amateur Hockey League. It was founded in New York City around the same time as the second artificial ice rink was opened in New York, New York, called the St. Nicholas Arena. The US Amateur Hockey League then became a member of the International Professional Hockey League in 1904. There were five teams from the United States and Ontario that formed the International Ice Hockey Federation. This league only lasted three seasons but it was the first professional ice hockey league that the United States participated in.\nBy 1898 the following leagues had already formed: the Amateur Hockey League of New York, the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada, and the Ontario Hockey Association. The 1898 Spalding Athletic Library book includes rules (laws) and results for each league (association).\nMeanwhile, teams in western Canada formed the Pacific Coast Hockey Association in 1911. This league created new designs and rules that helped ice hockey evolve into the game it is today. Some of these new innovations that were created were blue lines that were painted under the ice which divided the ice into three sections, goaltenders are allowed to fall and slide on the ice to help prevent the other team from scoring a goal, forward passing is permitted in the neutral zone, and the game was split into three periods of 20 minutes. In 1912, the game changed again reducing the number of on-ice players to six players from the previous seven.\nNational Hockey League.\nThe NHL is the major professional hockey league in North America, with 25 US-based teams and 7 Canadian-based teams competing for the Stanley Cup. While NHL stars are still not as readily familiar to the general American public as are stars of the NFL, MLB, and the NBA, average attendance for NHL games in the US has surpassed average NBA attendance in recent seasons, buoyed in part by the NHL Winter Classic being played in large outdoor stadiums.\nIn 1924, the Boston Bruins were the first American team to join the National Hockey League. During that season, the first NHL game was played in the United States where the Boston Bruins defeated the Montreal Maroons 2–1. That same season, the NHL increased the season schedule from 24 games to 30 games. Three more American teams the New York Rangers, Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Cougars, joined the NHL in the year 1926. That same year, the Western Hockey League fell apart and sold most of its players to the new NHL teams. This makes the NHL the top hockey league in North America. In 1942, the Brooklyn Americans withdrew from the NHL. This left the Canadiens, Maple Leafs, Red Wings, Bruins, Rangers, and Black Hawks as the only teams left in the NHL for the next 25 years. Those six teams are now called \"the Original Six.\"\nNew Brunswick-born skater Willie O'Ree became the first black ice hockey player in the NHL for the Boston Bruins. while Val James was the first African American player to compete in the NHL for the Buffalo Sabres and Toronto Maple Leafs.\nIn 1972 the World Hockey Association formed of 12 teams from Canada and the United States intended to rival the NHL but ultimately failed and many of the teams merged with the NHL.\nStanley Cup.\nThe Stanley Cup is the oldest trophy in North American sports. Lord Stanley of Preston was appointed by Queen Victoria to be the Governor General of Canada on June 11, 1888. While governor, Ice hockey was still just forming in Canada. He first got to see the game of hockey played at Montreal's 1889 Winter Carnival. During the carnival he watched the Montreal Victorias play the Montreal Hockey Club. Since then he and his family became very involved in the game of ice hockey. His two sons, Arthur and Algernon, convinced their father to donate a trophy that would be considered to be a visible sign of the ice hockey championship. This trophy was a silver bowl inlaid with gold. The trophy was first presented in 1893 and was called the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup. The name of the trophy was later changed to the famous name, The Stanley Cup.\nIn 1914 the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, joined the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. After that, the trustees of the Stanley Cup made a statement that the Stanley Cup was no longer for the best team in Canada, but now the best team in the whole world. The Rosebuds became the first American team to compete in the Stanley Cup Finals two years later. In the year 1917, the team Seattle Metropolitans was the first American team to win the Stanley Cup. Once that season was over, the National Hockey Association was changed into the NHL or the National Hockey League.\nMinor leagues.\nMinor league professional hockey leagues in the US include the American Hockey League and the ECHL. Additionally, nine US-based teams compete in the three member leagues of the Canadian Hockey League.\nUSA Hockey is the official governing body for amateur hockey in the US The United States Hockey Hall of Fame is located in Eveleth, Minnesota.\nIce hockey structure.\nThe United States ice hockey structure includes elements from traditional American scholastic high school and college athletics, affiliated and independent minor leagues, and the unique \"Major Junior\" leagues. The hierarchy of the ice hockey league system forms a pyramid with a large number of regional minor and development leagues making up the base of the pyramid and a linear progression through the professional minor leagues leading to the Nation Hockey League at the top of the pyramid.\nAmateur ice hockey.\nCollege hockey has a regional following in the northeastern and upper midwestern United States. However in the 2015 season, the Arizona State hockey program made its jump from club to the varsity level. College hockey is increasingly being used to develop players for the NHL and other professional leagues (the US has junior leagues, the United States Hockey League and North American Hockey League, but they are more restricted to protect junior players' college eligibility). The Frozen Four is college hockey's national championship.\nSummer senior ice hockey is increasing in popularity in the 21st century, with Edina, Minnesota's Da Beauty League and Buffalo, New York's Fattey Hockey League both drawing NHL players who use the leagues to stay in shape during the offseason. Da Beauty League, established in 2016, is considered the nation's premier summer ice hockey league and benefits from corporate sponsorship from the Minnesota business community.\nThe GLHL is a travel, full-contact league that plays for the Kohlman Cup every year. Teams are all based in Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan. Several of the teams in the GLHL are the oldest hockey teams in the world, including the Portage Lake Pioneers and Calumet Wolverines, both established in the early 1900s.\nOlympics.\nA hockey tournament debuted in the Summer Olympics in 1920 and would later also be recognized as the first World Ice Hockey Championship. Canada took the gold medal, with the United States getting the silver. The Canadians went on to claim three consecutive golds after the sport was permanently transferred to the newly established Winter Olympics in 1924. In 1936, their streak was ended by the British team that went on to beat the Canadians and tie the Americans, claiming the gold. Canada reclaimed gold in 1948 and defended it in 1952. However, the Soviet Union ended Canadian dominance in 1956, winning gold, and went on to win all Olympic tournaments until 1992 with 1960 and 1980, when the Americans were victorious, being lone exceptions. Much of this has to do with the fact that, unlike the Soviets, the Canadians were unable to use their best players. After 1992, four nations won gold medals: Canada (7th, 8th, and 9th titles), Sweden (1st and 2nd title), Czech Republic (1st title), Russia (9th title), and, the most recent champions, Finland (1st title). From 1998 to 2014, NHL players participated in the Olympics. In 1994, 2018, and 2022 players from all professional leagues except the NHL and AHL competed. Prior to 1947 there was no nationally recognized national governing body for ice hockey in the United States. The Amateur Hockey Association of the United States or AHAUS, which later became USA Hockey, was created that year and has remained the governing body of ice hockey in the United States since then. The United States men's team has won two gold medals (1960, 1980), eight silver medals (1920, 1924, 1932, 1952, 1956, 1972, 2002, 2010) and one bronze medal (1936). The 1980 gold medal victory is still remembered as one of the greatest upsets in sporting history, with team USA beating four-time defending champions the USSR in the medal round.\nOn the women's side, the US national team won the first Olympic tournament featuring women in 1998. The Americans won gold again in 2018 and have played in every Olympic final except for one, in 2006, when they won bronze. As such, they have four silver medals.\nWomen's ice hockey.\nWomen's ice hockey is growing in the United States. The Premier Hockey Federation (PHF), founded in 2015 as the National Women's Hockey League, was the first in North America to pay its players a salary, and at its foundation featured four teams from the Northeast. Through partnerships with NHL teams, the league expanded to five teams for its fourth season in 2018, adding the Minnesota Whitecaps (a long-established independent team) that year, before expanding into Canada in 2020. However, after the dissolution of the Canadian Women's Hockey League in 2019, hundreds of prominent women's players, including several American Olympians, founded the Professional Women's Hockey Players' Association and opted to boycott existing leagues in pursuit of a unified, financially stable professional league. In 2023, the PHF was purchased and ultimately dissolved as part of the foundation of the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL), the unified league many players had been working towards. The league debuted in January 2024, with three of its six charter franchises located in the US in Boston, New York, and Minnesota.\nTelevision coverage.\nIn 1957, CBS was the first US television network to carry NHL games. Later, the television network NBC also started carrying some NHL games. Both television networks held rights to show NHL games at times, but neither television network showed a full NHL schedule. They only carried select games from the Stanley Cup Finals. From the year 1971 to the year 1995 no United States television network had exclusive coverage of the NHL games. The USA television network started carrying 35 regular-season games and played the full schedule of the playoff games from the year 1981 to 1985. ESPN replaced the USA network in 1985 and then Sports Channel replaced ESPN in 1989. ESPN came back and later took over the NHL contract in 1993. The Fox network joined ESPN in the year 1995. After the 1999 season, ABC, a sister network of ESPN, took over as the NHL's over-the-air broadcast partner in the US, a role it held until 2004. Following the 2004–05 lockout, the NHL signed a new television contract with NBC, initially with co-existing cable TV rights with OLN/Versus. In 2011, NBC and the NHL signed a new 10-year deal, and shortly after, Versus was rebranded into NBCSN following NBC's merger with Comcast. The new deal also made available all televised playoff games on a national basis, with NBC's sister networks such as CNBC and the USA Network broadcasting a limited number of playoff games. Following the 2021 season, the NHL elected to split American TV rights, with ESPN and new partner TNT inking new seven-year contracts. This deal also allows all Stanley Cup Final games to air on over-the-air television (in this case ABC), though only on even-numbered seasons.\nPop culture.\nMovies such as \"Miracle\", \"The Mighty Ducks\", \"Youngblood\", \"Soul on Ice, and Goon (film)\" have become part of American culture regarding hockey.\nFanbase.\nIce hockey is one of the 4 major sports watched in the United States, and the US-based National Hockey League is watched by many people around the world.\nIce hockey is traditionally popular in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States, particularly in Massachusetts (and New England in general), Michigan, New York (especially Upstate New York) and Minnesota. Minnesota is known as the State of Hockey and the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area is the hockey capital of the US.\nThe NHL has also made inroads into other areas of the US not historically known for hockey. Teams based in North Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, and California have all contributed to an increase in the sport's popularity in those states, with Dallas, Tampa Bay, Carolina, Anaheim, Los Angeles, and Vegas all winning the Stanley Cup at least once each since 1999.\nThe NHL is trying to grow the sport of ice hockey by attempting to diversify the fanbase and expand from its traditional demographic. A notable example is the Chicago Blackhawks, who have seen a significant increase in attention from ethnic minorities since their Stanley Cup successes in the 2010s, which has resulted in the team setting up outreach programs for urban youths and low income neighborhoods. The Washington Capitals also have noteworthy outreach programs for to garner interest ice hockey.\nThe NHL has outreach programs like \"Hockey is for Everyone\" to make ice hockey more accessible to urban youth and low income communities.\nPresent day.\nAs of the year 2015, there are over 2,000 ice rinks in the United States alone (United States, 2008). There are now 32 teams participating in the NHL, with 25 in the United States and 7 in Canada. As of spring 2014, the United States has won 16 medals (gold, silver, and bronze) total.\nThe US now has more youth hockey players than all other countries, excluding Canada, combined. The legacy of the Miracle on Ice is believed to be influential in popularizing the sport from a regional sport to a mainstream sport.\nNumber of players by state.\nUSA Hockey.\nIn the 2022-23 season, USA Hockey had 556,186 registered hockey players, including male, female and junior. \nPlayers by Birth State (as of April 16, 2024).\nNational Hockey League.\nThere are currently 299 US-born hockey players representing 36 states in the National Hockey League (NHL). Minnesota now has more active NHL players than any other state or province other than Ontario. \nPlayers by Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nAs of the 2023 - 24 NHL season, the Minneapolis–St. Paul–Bloomington, MN-WI MSA has produced more NHL players than any other U.S. metropolitan area. \nAmerican Hockey League.\nThe American Hockey League (AHL) is a professional ice hockey league based in Springfield, Massachusetts. It is considered the primary developmental league for the National Hockey League (NHL). The league currently has 400 US-born players. \nECHL.\nThe ECHL (formerly known as the East Coast Hockey League) is a league based in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. It is considered the premier \"AA\" or secondary professional league in the United States and Canada and is a tier below the American Hockey League (AHL). \nSouthern Professional Hockey League.\nThe Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL) is a professional ice hockey independent minor league based in Huntersville, North Carolina. It is considered a lower-level professional league. \nNCAA Division I.\nDivision I men's ice hockey is made up of 64 schools. Minnesota produces more NCAA Division I players than every other US state as well as any Canadian province. \nUnited States Hockey League.\nThe United States Hockey League (USHL) is the top junior ice hockey league in the United States. The league consists of 16 teams throughout the Midwestern United States, for players between the ages of 16 and 21. The USHL is strictly amateur, allowing former players to compete in NCAA college hockey. \nNorth American Hockey League.\nThe North American Hockey League (NAHL) is a Tier II junior hockey league headquartered in Addison, Texas.

He first played for Queensland in 1978 and for Australia in 1980. His last match for Australia was in the 1987 World Cup. Although Gould's career was cut short due to injury, he is widely considered one of the greatest fullbacks to ever play for Australia. \nIn 2009 Gould was elected to the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame and was also added to the Queensland team of the century.\nRugby career.\nFormer Australian winger David Campese in \"On a Wing and a Prayer\" wrote of Gould that:\nCampese further writes in \"Campo: Still Entertaining\" that:\nFormer Australian five-eighth Mark Ella writes in \"Path to Victory\" that:\nFormer Australian coach Alan Jones has called Gould the best player he ever coached. In \"Wallaby Gold: The History of Australian Test Rugby\" Jones is recorded as saying that, \"...my best player, I think, was Roger Gould. If your defensive line is going to hold up, the opposition are going to roof it, and you've just got to have someone who's absolutely rock-solid. Gould was a flawless. He was a freak. He did did wonderful things.\"\nIn \"Ella: The Definitive Biography\" Alan Jones is documented as saying:\nFormer Australian flanker Simon Poidevin in \"For Love Not Money\" wrote of Gould that, 'I say emphatically here and now that Gould is the best fullback I’ve ever played with or against, and I’d never leave him out of any side for which he was available. As a fullback, he was without peer.'\nFormer Australian dual-international Michael O'Connor in \"The Best of Both Worlds\" wrote of Gould that, 'The fact is, Roger Gould is the best fullback I’ve ever played with. He would take the bomb ninety-nine times out of one hundred and he wouldn’t just take it, he would hurt people while he was doing it. Usually, you feel confident about creaming a fullback taking a high ball, but if you tried it with Roger, you would end up with six studs in your face. He was so strong and aggressive. He put his foot up and he just couldn’t be moved.’\nIn \"Path to Victory\" rugby writer Terry Smith describes Gould thus:"

        "text": "The Men's European Volleyball Championship (\"EuroVolley\") is the official competition for senior men's national volleyball teams of Europe, organized by the European Volleyball Confederation (CEV). The initial gap between championships was variable, but since 1975 they have been awarded every two years. The current champion is Poland, which won its second title at the 2023 tournament.\nHistory.\nThe first tournament was held in 1948 with participation of six national teams. Being only participant from Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia captured gold. The teams from Eastern Europe dominated at the tournament for next four decades. The next two editions held in 1950 and 1951 were won by the Soviet Union (who also won two World Championships in 1949 and 1952). However, in late 1950s Czechoslovakia managed to return at first positions. They captured European gold in 1955 and repeated this success at next edition in 1958 (also winning World Championship in 1956). In 1963, twice runner-up Romania won its maiden European title at the home tournament.\nThe victory in 1967 marked the beginning of the 20-year era of dominance of the Soviet Union. From 1967 to 1987, Soviet team didn't lose any tournament by winning 9 European titles in a row. The names of leading Soviet players of these times such as Vyacheslav Zaytsev, Aleksandr Savin, Vladimir Kondra, Viljar Loor, Yury Panchenko and Vladimir Chernyshyov are known to volleyball enthusiasts all over the world. From 1977 to 1985, Soviet team was coached by Vyacheslav Platonov who led national team to five European titles in a row as well as to two World Championship titles (1978, 1982), two World Cup titles (1977, 1981) and Olympic gold in 1980. The main European rival of Soviet team at these times, Poland (1974 World Champion and 1976 Olympic Champion) was runner-up for the five times in a row (from 1975 to 1983).\nSoviet domination was ceased in 1989 when Italy under leadership of Argentinian coach Julio Velasco unprecedentally won their first ever official tournament. Soviet team surprisingly failed to even reach podium after losing to Sweden (hosts) in semifinals and to Netherlands in a bronze-medal match. However, in 1991, in their last participation at the competition, Soviet Union won European title for the 12th time after 3–0 victories over a Netherlands in semifinals and Italy in the final match. Vyacheslav Platonov won European title as head coach for the record sixth time.\nFollowing the Soviet Union's dissolution in December 1991, Italy led by such players as Andrea Gardini, Andrea Giani, Paolo Tofoli and Lorenzo Bernardi became indisputably the best team not only in Europe but also in the world. They won three World Championships in a row (1990, 1994, 1998) and also dominated at European Championships by winning five of the next seven tournaments (from 1993 to 2005). However, ironically they never managed to win Olympic gold. Netherlands who became Olympic Champion in 1996 also managed to win their maiden European title at the home tournament next year. FR Yugoslavia who won Olympic gold in 2000 also became European Champion for the first time at the next-year tournament.\nAfter victory in 2005, the period of Italy's dominance came to end, and more national teams were managed to win their maiden European title. The next tournament was surprisingly won by Spain who managed to beat home favorites – Russia – in a closest 5th-set tie-breaker. In 2009, Poland became European Champion for the first time. The next tournament was won by Serbia for the first time since dissolution of the Serbia and Montenegro (the country which was previously known as FR Yugoslavia). In 2013, Russia (who became Olympic Champion in 2012) finally managed to win their first European title since the Soviet Union's dissolution. The next edition was successful for France who also won their maiden European gold.\nThe 2017 European Championship took place in Poland. It was won by Russia who defeated Germany in a 5th-set tie-breaker. The 2019 European Championship was co-hosted by four countries for first time – France, Slovenia, Belgium and the Netherlands. Serbia won this tournament after 3-1 victory over Slovenia in the final match in Paris. The co-host countries of 2021 edition were Poland, Czech Republic, Estonia and Finland. In the final match held in Katowice, Italy defeated Slovenia in a 5th-set tie-breaker and won their seventh European title – the first in 16 years. Next year Italy achieved another success in Katowice by defeating Poland at the opponent's home ground in the final match of the 2022 World Championship. However, next year Poland managed to take revenge by beating Italy 3-0 in a final match of the 2023 European Championship which was held in Rome. It was second European victory in the history of Polish men's national volleyball team.\nThe 33 European Championship tournaments have been won by nine different nations. Russia have won fourteen times (twelve as Soviet Union). The other European Championship winners are Italy, with seven titles; Czech Republic (as Czechoslovakia) and Serbia (one as FR Yugoslavia), with three titles each; Poland, with two titles; and France, Netherlands, Romania and Spain, with one title each.\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding two years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the \"European Championship Finals\". 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about two weeks.\nItaly holds record for the participation at the European Championships (32 times) by missing only one tournament. Bulgaria and France participated at the 31 continental tournaments each. Russia also participated at the 31 European Championships (sixteen as Soviet Union).\nMost successful players.\nBoldface denotes active volleyball players and highest medal count among all players (including these who not included in these tables) per type.\nMultiple medalists.\nThe table shows players who have won at least 6 medals in total at the European Championships."

        "title": "Peter Patton (basketball)",
        "text": "Peter Patton (born 1973) is an American basketball coach and administrator as well as a former basketball player. He is currently the Director of Player Development for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has previously been a shooting coach in the NBA for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Dallas Mavericks. \nHe played college basketball for the DePaul Blue Demons before playing in the International Basketball Association and Croatia. He set the DePaul single-season three-point shooting percentage record. In high school, he was a highly-touted multisport athlete who as a quarterback/punter was the Chicago Catholic League co-MVP in football after leading his high school football team to the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) semi-finals twice. He also played high school baseball and basketball.\nEarly life.\nPatton states that he attended basketball camps from an early age. He attended a camp by Ray Meyer in Wisconsin as a sixth grader, earning the nickname General Patton. Meyer was the father of Joey Meyer who succeeded him as DePaul head coach. Patton also claims to have attended basketball camps at the University of Indiana from sixth grade through his high school freshman year.\nHigh school career.\nPatton attended Loyola Academy in Wilmette, Illinois. He played basketball, football and baseball at Loyola in the Chicago Catholic League. He was a gridiron football quarterback, basketball guard and baseball pitcher-first baseman who was regarded as one of the best three-sport athletes of his day in the Chicago metropolitan area. \nAs a sophomore he was the starting quarterback, point guard and pitcher for Loyola. As a junior, he led Loyola to the IHSA 1990 Class 6A football semi-finals where they lost to Thornton Township High School. After the season, he was mentioned as one of the three best football prospects (along with Chris Piggott and Bryan Jurewicz) in the Chicago area. In basketball, Loyola (18–10) lost in the IHSA 1991 Class AA basketball sectional round to DePaul College Prep (known as Gordon Tech), whose star was future DePaul teammate Tom Kleinschmidt. \nAs a senior, Patton led an undefeated Loyola team to the IHSA 1991 Class 6A state football semi-finals to lose to Glenbard North High School. Patton, who also served as punter, was Chicago Catholic League co-MVP. That November, \"Chicago Sun-Times\" journalist Taylor Bell described Patton as \"one of the best three-sport athletes produced in Illinois since Dike Eddleman created his legend in Centralia 50 years ago\". Loyola (16–10) lost in the 1992 IHSA basketball sectional semi-finals.\nThe only football recruiting visit that Patton made was to Indiana because recruiters were unsure which sport he would choose. By early March 1992, he chose basketball over football. In late March 1992, Patton verbally committed to DePaul for basketball over athletic scholarship offers from Northern Illinois and Evansville and an opportunity to be a preferred walk-on at Illinois. On April 15, 1992, Patton signed his National Letter of Intent with DePaul. Patton would have been likely in the playing rotation at either Evansville or Northern as a freshman. In fact, if he had met the admissions standards at Northwestern, he would have been in the rotation there as well, but he did not meet the standards. Patton had dreamt of playing for Indiana, but in the end they ranked Patton below Malcolm Sims. At DePaul, Patton was expected to perform as a backup to Howard Nathan and bolster DePaul at the point guard position where they were lacking depth alongside shooting guard/small forward Kleinschmidt. As a senior, his multi-sport star status put him in the conversation along with the likes of Dani Tyler and Chris Collins for \"Chicago Tribune\" athlete of the year recognition.\nCollege career.\nOn September 3, 1992, DePaul announced that Nathan was \"dismissed for academic reasons\". Nathan had started eight games as a freshman, led the team in steals and placed second all-time among DePaul freshmen in assists and steals. Head coach Joey Meyer was evaluating Patton and Brandon Cole as his potential starting point guards. On the eve of opening night it was not clear who would start. After the first few games, Patton was described as \"a semi-starter\" by \"Sun-Times\" writer Toni Ginnetti.\nPatton played four seasons of college basketball for the DePaul Blue Demons between 1992 and 1996. He never missed a game in college and set the DePaul single-season three-point percentage record as a junior (54.1%), a mark that still stood as of 2016.\nPlaying career.\nIn 1996, Patton had a two-game stint with the Carolina Cardinals of the United States Basketball League (USBL). He went on to play 30 games in the International Basketball Association (IBA) for the Dakota Wizards during the 1996–97 season, where he earned All-IBA Second Team honors. In 1997–98, he played 34 games in the IBA for the Magic City Snowbears.\nFor the 1998–99 season, Patton played in Croatia for Kandid Olimpija Osijek. He averaged 7.3 points and 2.5 assists before he was waived in January 1999.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2016, Patton joined the Minnesota Timberwolves coaching staff as a shooting coach. Between 2018 and 2023, Patton served as shooting coach of the Dallas Mavericks. In 2023, the Chicago Bulls hired Patton as the Director of Player Development."

        "title": "Cricket in Oceania",
        "text": "The popularity of cricket in Oceania varies from place to place – in some countries, it is the national sport, while in others it is not played at all. A number of Oceanian countries are members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and participate in tournaments organised by the ICC East Asia-Pacific (EAP) development program. The other major regional competition is the cricket tournament at the Pacific Games, which is open to ICC non-members.\nCricket by country.\nAmerican Samoa.\nAs in neighbouring Samoa (formerly Western Samoa), the most popular form of cricket in American Samoa, an unincorporated territory of the United States, is the traditional version known as \"kilikiti\". The most significant event of the cricketing calendar is the annual tournament on Flag Day (the national holiday), which attracts large numbers of both men's and women's village teams. The prize money for the 2015 tournament totalled US$24,000. In June 2000, it was stated that a representative team from American Samoa was going to play the Samoan national team at newly renovated ground in Apia, although it is unclear if the fixture went ahead. It was also suggested that American Samoa might participate in the cricket event at the 2003 South Pacific Games in Fiji, but that did not eventuate.\nCook Islands.\nOrganised cricket in the Cook Islands, an associated state of New Zealand, dates from at least 1910, when a cricket club was founded on Rarotonga. The game quickly spread to the outer atolls of Aitutaki and Mangaia, but in the 1950s entered into decline, with only six to eight clubs remaining in Rarotonga. A revival occurred in the 1990s, and the national governing body, the Cook Islands Cricket Association (CICA), became an affiliate member of the ICC in 2000. Outside of Rarotonga, cricket is most popular on Pukapuka, which lies closer to Samoa than to the rest of the islands.\nThe Cook Islands national team made its international debut in 2001, against Norfolk Island, and has since participated in ICC East Asia-Pacific regional tournaments and the Pacific Games. The national women's team debuted in 2012. Unlike in many other Pacific countries, women's cricket was only popularised in the country in the late 2000s. Participation has increased rapidly since then, and the CICA has won an ICC development award for its work in promoting the game amongst women. CICA has cultivated relationships with New Zealand domestic teams, initially with Auckland Cricket and later with the Northern Districts Cricket Association.\nFiji.\nCricket was introduced to the Fijian Islands in 1874, during the time of the short-lived Kingdom of Fiji, when a team from Levuka played against a visiting Royal Navy ship. Fiji toured New Zealand in early 1895, they had only been playing first-class cricket for 21 years. Fiji's first international match was against the West Indies in 1956.\nGuam.\nCricket is popular among Indian expatriates in Guam, an unincorporated U.S. territory. The Guam Cricket Club was founded in 1992, and in 2010 had \"about 25 members\". Matches are played at Ypao Beach Field and on the University of Guam's playing fields. Plans to field a national team have been hampered by the lack of a dedicated ground and the frequent movement of players in and out of the country. Guam has been described as \"the westernmost point in all of USA territory where cricket is played\".\nKiribati.\nArthur Grimble, a future Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony, recounted in his memoir, \"A Pattern of Islands\", that cricket was \"going strong\" on Ocean Island (now Banaba) at the time of his arrival in 1914. Ten years later, according to Grimble, it was \"popular everywhere\" in the islands, although it subsequently declined. Cricket was still regularly played on Ocean Island in the 1950s, where there were two main teams – one featuring mainly Australians and New Zealanders employed by the British Phosphate Commission, and the other featuring members of the local police force, who were predominantly indigenous Gilbertese. The pitch on the island's sports ground was made from coconut matting ground, with the outfield was covered in pieces of coral. According to the 1997 \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", a Kiribati representative team had toured Tuvalu in a fixture earlier in the 1990s, winning the match after their last batsman hit a six off the final ball.\nNauru.\nThere are a number of photographs of formal cricket matches being played on Nauru in the early 20th century. One of these, dating from 1908 (during the period of the German protectorate), depicts Europeans and Nauruans playing together on a pitch surrounded by palm trees (watched on from a makeshift pavilion), and is titled \"1st Match at Nauru\". During the time of the British Phosphate Commission, cricket was cited by Australian newspapers as a key part of social life in the island. More recently, cricket has been popular (especially among Sri Lankans) in the Australian immigration detention centre on Nauru.\nNorfolk Island.\nCricket is recorded as having been played on Norfolk Island, an external territory of Australia, as early as 1838, by soldiers stationed on the island. It continued to be played after the island was settled in 1856 by Pitcairn Islanders, descended from the mutineers of the \"Bounty\" and of mixed European and Polynesian stock. John Patteson, an ex-first-class cricketer and future Bishop of Melanesia, was a missionary on Norfolk during that period. From 1876 until well into the 20th century, a match was played annually on Bounty Day, the national holiday, a tradition that was resumed in 1997. In 2001, it was reported that there were three clubs on the island (playing both a knockout tournament and a regular league), regular tours from the Australian mainland, and a junior development program, assisted by the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA). Norfolk Island's cricket ground is located at Kingston Oval (or Kingston Common), with an artificial matting pitch overlooked by Kingston's convict-era buildings, which are World Heritage Sites.\nA Norfolk Island representative team toured Auckland, New Zealand, in January 2001, and played at least two matches – one against an Auckland Secondary Schools team, and then a 50-over fixture against the Cook Islands, which it lost by seven wickets. Those matches are the only ones recorded for an island representative team. Excluded from the Pacifica Cup, which was played in 2001 and 2002, the Norfolk Island Cricket Association had expressed its intention to enter a team into the cricket tournament at the 2003 South Pacific Games, but this, along with its desire for affiliate membership of the ICC, did not eventuate. Their last tour was to the Pitcairn Islands in 2014.\nNiue.\nA 2011 Radio New Zealand article made reference to a Niue Cricket Association, and mentioned that a league had recently been established featuring ten village teams. The Niuean language, where the sport is known as \"kilikiki\", contains a rich vocabulary of cricket-related terms.\nPitcairn Island.\nCricket was introduced to Pitcairn Island (a British overseas territory) in the 19th century, by islanders who had learned the game on Norfolk Island. The sport was once played regularly, but is now played less often, in part due to an ageing population. A 1957 \"National Geographic\" profile of the island noted that women-only matches were played, and featured a photograph of a game in progress on a matting pitch, with palm trees marking the boundary. , there is an annual match on the Queen's Official Birthday, in which most of the island participates. The previous year had seen a tour by a team of Norfolk Islanders. Owing to a lack of level ground on the island, a matting pitch is still used, placed on the lawn in front of the island's school. In the past, bulldozers were used to clear a suitable ground.\nSolomon Islands.\nCricket was introduced to the Solomon Islands archipelago in the late 19th century, by islanders who had learnt the game at school on Norfolk Island. Unlike in other parts of Melanesia, there was no prior history of ball games in the islands. Plum Warner's 1912 collection, \"Imperial Cricket\", contained a description of cricket in the Solomon Islands by Cecil Wilson, the Bishop of Melanesia. He praised the islanders' skills, especially their bowling and throwing, but noted that there were difficulties in obtaining equipment and finding room to play.\nBy the 1960s, interest in the sport had waned outside of the capital, Honiara. The Solomon Islands national side made its debut in 1977, drawing a match against the touring Fijian national team. The team participated in the cricket tournament at the 1991 South Pacific Games in Papua New Guinea, and won at least one match (against New Caledonia). Cricket has since further declined in the country, with the national team last playing in 1999 (against an Australian club side). A national governing body, the Solomon Islands Cricket Association, was formed in 2000, at which point there were estimated to be only 18–20 indigenous players remaining (with the rest being expatriates from cricket-playing countries). A four-team league was established in Honiara in 2009, with support from AusAID (the Australian government's overseas aid program) . A writer in the 2015 \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", suggested that \"cricket now teeters precariously\" in the country. Solomon Islands is the only independent country in Melanesia that is not an ICC member.\nTokelau.\nIn Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand, \"kilikiti\" is the only form of cricket played, and has been cited as the \"favourite community sport\". The sport is played on all three of Tokelau's atolls, Atafu, Fakaofo, and Nukunonu. Although the sport was introduced to Nukunonu first, in the 1890s, the local pitch was created only in the 1960s, by filling in a saltwater lagoon with baskets of coral gravel. Atafu and Fakaofo both have concrete pitches, and \"Test matches\" between the two atolls date to 1931. In Atafu, men and women play separately, while in Fakaofo they play together, although underarm bowling is used for the women.\nTuvalu.\nCricket was first introduced to Tuvalu (formerly the Ellice Islands) by Christian missionaries during the 1890s, although individual islands were not exposed until much later – for example, Vaitupu was only introduced to the sport in the 1920s, when a New Zealander began teaching the sport at Motufoua Secondary School. The only form of the sport currently played is \"kilikiti\". Football is more popular, in part due to a lack of space for cricket fields – in Funafuti, Tuvalu's capital and most populous atoll, one of the cricket venues is the runway at Funafuti International Airport. A Tuvaluan national side participated in the cricket tournament at the 1979 South Pacific Games in Fiji. However, it lost all three of its matches, against Papua New Guinea, Tonga, and Western Samoa. According to the 1997 \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", Tuvalu had hosted Kiribati in a fixture earlier in the 1990s, narrowly losing after the last Kiribati batsman hit a six off the final ball of the game.\nWallis and Futuna.\nAs in New Caledonia, another French overseas territory in the South Pacific, the most popular variant of cricket in Wallis and Futuna is \"kilikiti\" (or \"le cricket traditionnel\" in French). At least two stamps have been issued (in 1998 and 2005) depicting kilikiti on the islands. In August 2001, it was reported that steps were being undertaken to popularise the standard form of the game, with equipment donated from New Caledonia. A governing body, the Wallis &amp; Futuna Cricket Association, had been established with the intent of joining ICC East Asia-Pacific and participating in the cricket tournament at the 2003 South Pacific Games in Fiji. Neither of these goals were met."

        "title": "Cricket in Norfolk Island",
        "text": "Cricket is recorded as having been played on Norfolk Island, an external territory of Australia, as early as 1838, by soldiers stationed on the island. It continued to be played after the island was settled in 1856 by Pitcairn Islanders, descended from the mutineers of the \"Bounty\" and of mixed European and Polynesian stock. John Patteson, an ex-first-class cricketer and future Bishop of Melanesia, was a missionary on Norfolk during that period. From 1876 until well into the 20th century, a match was played annually on Bounty Day, the national holiday, a tradition that was resumed in 1997. In 2001, it was reported that there were three clubs on the island (playing both a knockout tournament and a regular league), regular tours from the Australian mainland, and a junior development program, assisted by the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA). Norfolk Island's cricket ground is located at Kingston Oval (or Kingston Common), which is the oldest cricket pitch in the Southern Hemisphere used since 1838, now with artificial matting overlooked by Kingston's convict-era buildings, which are World Heritage Sites.\nA Norfolk Island representative team toured Auckland, New Zealand, in January 2001, and played at least two matches – one against an Auckland Secondary Schools team, and then a 50-over fixture against the Cook Islands, which it lost by seven wickets. Those matches are the only ones recorded for an island representative team. Excluded from the Pacifica Cup, which was played in 2001 and 2002, the Norfolk Island Cricket Association had expressed its intention to enter a team into the cricket tournament at the 2003 South Pacific Games, but this, along with its desire for affiliate membership of the ICC, did not eventuate. Their last tour was to the Pitcairn Islands in 2014."

        "text": "Baseball was featured at the 2020 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, for the first time since the 2008 Summer Olympics. Six national teams competed in the tournament: Israel, Japan (host), Mexico, South Korea, the United States, and the Dominican Republic.\nBaseball/softball was one of five sports that were added to the programme of the 2020 Summer Olympics only. It will not return in 2024. The tournament was originally scheduled to be held in 2020, but on 24 March 2020, the Olympics were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the games were played behind closed doors.\nQualification.\nSix national teams qualified for the Olympic baseball tournament. Japan automatically qualified, as the host nation. Israel qualified by winning the September 2019 Europe/Africa continental tournament. \nTwo teams qualified through the 2019 WBSC Premier12 tournament in November 2019. South Korea qualified as the best-placed team from the Asia/Oceania region (other than Japan, which already qualified as host), while Mexico qualified as the best-placed team from the Americas. \nThe United States qualified by winning the Americas Qualifying Event that was originally scheduled to take place in March 2020, but was postponed to May/June 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The final spot was awarded to the Dominican Republic which won a world Final Qualifying Tournament in late June 2021.\nCompetition format.\nThe small number of teams in the tournament resulted in an unusual competition format being adopted that featured 16 games. There was an opening group round-robin round, and a modified double-elimination bracket.\nFor the group round, there were two pools of three teams each. Each team played the other two teams in its pool once. A total of six games were played in the group round.\nIn the knockout round, the first three games featured teams that each finished in the same position in their respective pools (A1 vs B1, A2 vs B2, A3 vs B3). The loser of the A3 vs. B3 game was eliminated (with only one loss in the elimination round, plus one or two in the group stage). After this, play continued in double-elimination format until there is one team left in each of the winners and losers brackets. Those two teams played in the gold medal game (a single game; the losers bracket representative does not need to beat the winners bracket representative twice). The last two teams eliminated from the losers bracket played in the bronze medal game. In total, 10 games are played in the knockout round:\nThus, the best two teams from group play face each other in the quarterfinals, with a possible rematch later in the tournament (including the gold medal game, if the winner also wins its next game and the loser wins its next two).\nGroup stage.\nThe schedule was announced on 28 June 2021.

        "text": "Competition climbing made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan . Two events were held, one each for men and women. The format controversially consisted of one combined event with three disciplines: lead climbing, speed climbing and bouldering. The medals were determined based on best performance across all three disciplines. This format was previously tested at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics. The Olympic code for sports climbing is CLB.\nTwo qualification boulders were leaked on YouTube; the video was quickly taken down and the boulders were reset.\nFormat.\nOn August 3, 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) formally announced that competition climbing would be a medal sport in the 2020 Summer Olympics. The inclusion was proposed by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) in 2015.\nThe decision to combine three disciplines of lead climbing, bouldering, and speed climbing with one set of medals per sex caused widespread criticism in the climbing world.\nClimber Lynn Hill said the decision to include speed climbing was like \"asking a middle-distance runner to compete in the sprint.\" Czech climber Adam Ondra, who later competed as a finalist at the Olympics, voiced similar sentiments in an interview stating that anything would be better than this combination. There is some overlap between athletes in the categories of lead climbing and bouldering, but speed climbing is usually seen as a separate discipline which is practiced by specialized athletes. Climber Shauna Coxsey stated, \"No boulderer has transitioned to speed and lead, and no speed climber has done it to bouldering and lead.\"\nMembers of the IFSC explained that they were only granted one gold medal per gender by the Olympic committee and they did not want to exclude speed climbing. The IFSC's goal for the 2020 Olympics was primarily to establish climbing and its three disciplines as Olympic sports; changes to the format could follow later. This tactic proved to be successful as they were granted a second set of medals for the 2024 Summer Olympics, where speed climbing will be a separate event from the combined event of lead climbing and bouldering.\nThe final rankings were calculated by multiplying the climbers' rankings in each discipline, with the best score being the lowest one.\nQualification.\nThere were 40 quota spots available for competition climbing. Each National Olympic Committee could obtain a maximum of 2 spots in each event (total 4 maximum across the 2 events). Each event had 20 competitors qualify: 18 from qualification, 1 from the host (Japan), and 1 from Tripartite Commission invitations.\nThe 2019 IFSC Climbing World Championships served as one qualification event with 7 spots per gender being awarded to the top finishers of the combined event.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule for the events was as follows.\nParticipating nations.\n40 climbers from 19 nations qualified. Qualification events included the 2019 IFSC Climbing World Championships, Olympic Qualifying Event, and continental championships."

        "text": " \nThe History of the Sri Lanka national cricket team began with the formation of the Colombo Cricket Club in 1832. By the 1880s a national team, the Ceylon national cricket team, was formed which began playing first-class cricket by the 1920s. The Ceylon national cricket team had achieved associate member status of the International Cricket Council in 1965. Renamed Sri Lanka in 1972, the national team first competed in top level international cricket in 1975, when they played against West Indies during 1975 Cricket World Cup; West Indies won the match by 9 wickets at Old Trafford, Manchester, England.\nAfter Sri Lanka awarded Test status on 21 July 1981 as the eighth Test playing nation, they had to wait until 6 September 1985, where Sri Lanka recorded their first Test win by beating India, in the second match of the series by 149 runs at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium, Colombo. As of 10 July 2018, Sri Lanka have played 272 Test matches; they have won 86 matches, lost 101 matches, and 85 matches were drawn. They have also won the 2001-02 Asian Test Championship, defeating Pakistan in the final by an innings and 175 runs.\nSri Lanka registered their first ODI win against India at Manchester, England, on 16 June 1979. As of 10 July 2018, Sri Lanka have played 816 ODI matches, winning 376 matches and losing 399; they also tied 5 matches, whilst 36 had no result. They also won the 1996 Cricket World Cup, co-champions in 2002 ICC Champions Trophy and also became six times Asian champions in 1986, 1997, 2004, 2008, 2014 and 2022 Asia Cup.\nSri Lanka played their first Twenty20 International (T20I) match at the Rose Bowl, on 15 June 2006, against England, winning the match by 2 runs. In 2014, they won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, defeating India by 6 wickets. As of 10 July 2018, Sri Lanka have played 108 T20I matches and won 54 of them; 52 were lost and 1 tied and 1 no result match as well.\nAs of January 2016, Sri Lanka have faced all nine teams in Test cricket, with their most frequent opponent being Pakistan, playing 51 matches against them. Sri Lanka have registered more wins against Pakistan and Bangladesh than any other team, with 14. In ODI matches, Sri Lanka have played against 17 teams; they have played against India most frequently, with a winning percentage of 39.49 in 149 matches. Within usual major ODI nations, Sri Lanka have defeated England on 34 occasions, which is their best record in ODIs. The team have competed against 13 countries in T20Is, and have played 15 matches against New Zealand. Sri Lanka have defeated Australia and West Indies 6 occasions each. Sri Lanka was the best T20I team in the world, where they ranked number one in more than 32 months, and reached World Twenty20 final in three times.\nThe Sri Lanka national cricket team represents Sri Lanka in international cricket and is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.\nEarly years.\nCricket was brought to Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, by the British during the British Period. It is assumed the game was first played in the country by the early 1800s, though the first recorded cricket match was played in 1832. The earliest definite mention of cricket in Ceylon was a report in the \"Colombo Journal\" on 5 September 1832 which called for the formation of a cricket club. The Colombo Cricket Club was formed soon afterwards and matches began in November 1832.\nIn October 1882, Ivo Bligh's team played an odds game in Colombo \"en route\" to Australia, where they \"recovered those Ashes\". In 1888–89, an English team led by Georg\nVernon toured Ceylon and India, including an 11-a-side game against All-Ceylon at Kandy. In 1890, the Australian team \"en route\" to England played in Colombo.\nMarylebone Cricket Club (MCC) teams have visited on no less than 23 occasions since 1911–12, most recently in 2000–01.\nBy 1911, there had been five English teams in Ceylon. Those were led by Ivo Bligh in 1882–83; George Vernon in 1889–90; WG Grace in 1891–92; Lord Hawke in 1892–93; and Andrew Stoddart in 1894–95. The Bligh, Grace and Stoddart teams were \"en route\" to Australia while the Vernon and Hawke ventures took in Ceylon as part of visits to India.\n1920s–1960s.\nCeylon played its first first-class match under that name against Marylebone Cricket Club at Nomads Ground, Victoria Park, Colombo in 1926–27, losing by an innings.\nThe team's first win came against Patiala at Dhruve Pandove Stadium in 1932–33.\nFirst-class cricket in Ceylon became restricted to games against visiting touring teams, notably the English and Australian teams who used Ceylon as a stopover on the long voyage to each other's country. Douglas Jardine's infamous \"bodyline team\" was there in 1932–33. Occasionally, teams representative of Ceylon played matches abroad, especially in India. English team Sir Julien Cahn's XI visited Ceylon in 1936–37.\nThe India national cricket team visited Ceylon in April 1945 and played one first-class match against Ceylon at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo. The match was drawn on account of bad weather. India's team was a strong one captained by Vijay Merchant and including notable players such as Shute Banerjee, Mushtaq Ali, Lala Amarnath, Vijay Hazare and Rusi Modi.\nSeveral Australian teams stopped and played matches in Ceylon while traveling to England and back. In the aftermath of World War II, came the Australian Services cricket team in Ceylon and India in 1945–46, featuring Keith Miller who scored a century in Colombo. Miller returned as part of the Australian cricket team in England in 1948 which played a game in Colombo during a stopover on their voyage to England.\nThe West Indies cricket team visited Ceylon in February 1949 and played two first-class matches versus Ceylon. The West Indies won the first match at Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo by an innings and 22 runs after scoring 462–2 declared with centuries by Allan Rae, Everton Weekes and Clyde Walcott. Prior Jones took ten wickets in the match. The second match at the same venue was drawn, Rae making another century for West Indies.\nThe Pakistan national cricket team visited Ceylon in August 1949 to play two first-class matches versus Ceylon. Both games were played at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo. Pakistan, captained by Mohammad Saeed, won the first match by an innings and 192 runs, Saeed himself top-scoring with 93. The great Pakistan bowler Fazal Mahmood took 4–15 as Ceylon were bowled out for only 95 in their second innings. Pakistan won the second match by 10 wickets despite some good batting by Ceylon in their first innings.\nFrom 1953–4 until 1975–6, the Ceylon Cricket Association played a first-class match against Madras (later renamed Tamil Nadu) for the Gopalan Trophy. This fixture was played in Colombo roughly every two years, with one further fixture in 1982–3, alternating with the fixture being held in Madras.\nIndia visited Ceylon in November 1956 and played two first-class international matches against Ceylon at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo. Both matches were drawn. The Indian team was captained by Polly Umrigar and included Nari Contractor, Subhash Gupte, Pankaj Roy, A. G. Kripal Singh and Vijay Manjrekar.\n1960s.\nSri Lanka had associate member status of the International Cricket Council from 1965 to 1981 when they would be awarded full membership.\nIn 1964-65 Ceylon beat a Pakistan A team in Ceylon and a full Indian team in India. West Indies visited Ceylon in January 1967 and played a single first-class match at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo versus Ceylon. The match was drawn. West Indies was captained by Gary Sobers who scored 115 in his team's only innings. Other centuries were scored by Basil Butcher and Clive Lloyd.\nCeylon looked to a tour of England in 1968 to advance their case to be elevated to Test status. A schedule of 19 matches was arranged from early June to early August, including a match at Lord's against the MCC, nine first-class matches against county teams, and five other first-class matches.\nHowever, the Board of Control for Cricket in Ceylon had insufficient money to pay for the trip, and private donations had to be sought. Also, the government was reluctant to release the necessary foreign exchange at a time when it was struggling to afford vital imports.\nThe final straw was the selection of the team in April 1968. Chandra Schaffter, one of the four selectors, resigned when he found that the other selectors were going to select each other in the team, one of them as captain. The selected team was Herbert Fernando (captain), Michael Tissera (vice-captain), Ranjit Fernando, Abu Fuard, Gamini Goonesena, Stanley Jayasinghe, T. B. Kehelgamuwa, Dan Piachaud, Anurudda Polonowita, Mano Ponniah, Buddy Reid, Daya Sahabandu, Anura Tennekoon and Dhansiri Weerasinghe. Herbert Fernando and Dhansiri Weerasinghe were the two selectors who chose themselves. The resultant uproar caused the tour to be cancelled in May, just days before the team was scheduled to leave.\nIn 1969–70 another Australian team arrived in Ceylon. This team played one first-class match against the national Ceylon team before going on to India for a five-Test series.\n1970s.\nPakistan visited Sri Lanka in November 1972 to play a single first-class match versus the Sri Lanka national team at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo.

India defeated Sri Lanka at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground by 6 wickets but the other three first-class games were impacted by the weather and were drawn.\nWest Indies visited Sri Lanka in February 1975 as part of a wider tour of India and Pakistan. Captained by Clive Lloyd, West Indies played two first-class matches against Sri Lanka, that were both drawn, and a limited overs match that West Indies won by 8 wickets.\nSri Lanka first competed in top-level international cricket in 1975, when they played against the West Indies during 1975 Cricket World Cup; the West Indies won the match by 9 wickets at Old Trafford, Manchester, England.\nPakistan toured Sri Lanka in January 1976 to play three first-class and two limited overs matches. Sri Lanka surprisingly won the opening first-class match at Colombo Cricket Club Ground by 4 wickets and then Pakistan won the second match at the same venue by the same margin. In between, Pakistan played the Sri Lanka Board president's XI at Asgiriya Stadium in Kandy and they won this by 7 wickets.\nEnglish team D. H. Robins' XI visited Sri Lanka in 1977–78\nPakistan, captained by Majid Khan, visited Sri Lanka in April 1979 to play a limited overs match versus the Sri Lanka national team.

Zimbabwe also played three limited overs matches against the Sri Lankan XI.\nThe English cricket team had a short spell in Sri Lanka at the start of their tour of India in 1984–85.

The Sri Lankan team was led by Arjuna Ranatunga, where they played their first round in Group A with Australia, West Indies, India, Zimbabwe and Kenya. Australia and The West Indies forfeited the matches against Sri Lanka held in Sri Lankan soil due to safety concerns, so Sri Lanka won both matches by a walkover. Sri Lanka won against Zimbabwe by 6 wickets, courtesy of Aravinda de Silva's 91 runs, which was recorded as the highest ever score for a Sri Lankan in the World Cup, and highest ever for any player at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground at that time.

Skipper Arjuna and Hashan Tillakaratne also played valuable innings. Indian pacer Javagal Srinath took 3 wickets.\nSri Lanka finished with 251/8 in 50 overs, giving Indians a good chance of winning the match. But the Sri Lankan bowling was so good, Navjot Singh Sidhu and skipper Mohammad Azharuddin got out very early. Sachin Tendulkar along with Sanjay Manjrekar slowly built the innings, but their wickets gave Sri Lanka a big chance of winning. When India was 120/8, the Indian fans got aggressive, throwing bottles and other materials into the ground, where the match could not be continued further. The umpires went onto a discussion with both teams and decided to award the match to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka went on to their first finals in World Cup history.\nThe finals was against Australia led by Mark Taylor at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore. Before the match, former 1992 Cricket World Cup winning captain Imran Khan talked with Sri Lankan captain Ranatunga, stating that if they won the toss, to choose batting first. This was because the ground was more favorable to batting first and bowling under lights. In the toss, however, Ranatunga won the match, but chose to field first. After a blazing start from captain Mark Taylor and young superstar and future captain Ricky Ponting, Australia fell from being 1–137 to 5–170 after which Sri Lanka's four-prong spin attack took its toll. After Australia crashed to a 7–241 in its quota of 50 overs, Sri Lanka overcame a nervous start where they lost both openers before the score was 30, to win in 45 overs. Sri Lankan batting sensation Aravinda played a match-winning knock of 107, not out, and was assisted ably by fellow veterans Asanka Gurusinha (65) and captain Ranatunga (47*). De Silva was named man of the match after he had taken 3–42 in his 10 overs eairlier in the Australian innings &amp; Sanath Jayasuriya got man of the series award.\nSri Lankan cricket's greatest moment undoubtedly came during the aforementioned 1996 World Cup, when they defeated the top-ranked Australian team under the capaincy of Arjuna Ranatunga and the extraordinary performance of Aravinda de Silva in the finals. Sri Lanka lost their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana early but then Asanka Gurusinha and de Silva, settled in. Gurusinha dismissed after valuable 57 and then de Silva had the match winning partnership with skipper Ranatunga. Sri Lanka needed 51 off the last ten overs. De Silva hundred's, a knock which was a lesson in application, was the third ton in a World Cup final, after Clive Lloyd's in 1975 and Viv Richards' in 1979. It was the first time to won the World Cup final while chasing in the history as first instance to win the World Cup in home continent.\nSri Lanka's game style over the course of the series revolutionized One Day International Cricket, and was characterized by the highly aggressive batting of their openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana in the first fifteen overs of the innings to take advantage of the fielding restrictions imposed during this period. This strategy has since become a hallmark of One Day International cricket.\nThe sixth edition of Asia Cup, was held in Sri Lanka for the second time. Four subcontinent teams participated to the tournament. Ranatunga led the world cup victorious team into the Asia Cup. In the first match against Pakistan, Sri Lanka scored 239 runs along with Marvan Atapattu's fifty. Pakistan scored 224 runs, where Jayasuriya took 4 wickets. Sri Lanka won the match by 15 runs.

They grouped in Group A with South Africa, India, Zimbabwe, England and Kenya.\nSri Lanka played their first group match with England, where they only scored 204 bowled out in 48.2 overs. the high bouncing pitches gave the subcontinent players a real headache. England won the match comfortably by 8 wickets. In the second group match, against South Africa, they played badly.

Sanath Jayasuriya led the team. The team was grouped in Pool B with South Africa, New Zealand, West Indies, Bangladesh, Canada and Kenya. The first match was against New Zealand, where Blackcaps captain Stephen Fleming won the toss and sent Sri Lanka in to bat first. Sri Lanka's opening batsmen- Jayasuriya and Marvan Atapattu were going strong and kept a steady run rate until the fifth over when they conceded their first wicket. Skipper Jayasuriya dominated the Blackcaps bowling attack by scoring 120 runs. The final score at the end of the innings was 272/7. The second innings didn't start very well for New Zealand, losing their opening batsman, Nathan Astle, in the first over and captain Flemming in the second. The first real form of excitement came for New Zealand supporters when Styris and Cairns start hitting a few boundaries. Scott Styris overpassed Jayasuriya's batting by his 141 runs, but New Zealand all out for 217 in the total. Sri Lanka won by 47 runs and Jayasuriya was named man of the match.\nNext match was against Bangladesh, where Chaminda Vaas became the only bowler to claim a hat tricks in the first three balls of any form of international cricket when he took the first three wickets off the opening three balls of the match. With this feat, Vaas became the third of only four players to have achieved two hat tricks. Bangladesh poorly scored 124/10. Sri Lankan opening batsmen reached the target without a wicket falling. At the very next match against Canada, Sri Lanka again involved for a World record, where Canada total of 36 was the lowest total in World Cup history and lowest in all ODIs. Sri Lanka comfortably won the match by 9 wickets.\nAll these World Record matches next became a desperate sad for all the Sri Lankans. They lost the match to underdog Kenyans for the first time. The match was at Kenyan soil, Kenya batted first and scored 201 runs courtesy of 60 runs by Kennedy Otieno. Murali took 4 wickets and Vaas with 3 wickets. Sri Lanka came to bat, only Aravinda scored 41 runs. All the others scored less than 30. Sri Lanka all out for just 157 runs in 45 overs.

Last group match was against South Africa, Sri Lanka batted first and scored 268/9. South Africa was at 229/6 when rain came. According to Duckworth–Lewis method, the match was tied. Finally, Sri Lanka reached top of the Pool B, and selected for the quarterfinals.\nIn the quarterfinals, they suffered heavy losses to Australia and India, only won over Zimbabwe. This result gave them fourth place in standings, where Kenya recorded first semi-final birth in the history. Sri Lanka's semi-final was against Australia. On a difficult, slow pitch at Port Elizabeth, Australia struggled their way to 212 (7 wickets, 50 overs) against tight Sri Lankan bowling, thanks mainly to a great innings from Andrew Symonds (91* from 118 balls, 7 fours, 1 six), demonstrating again captain Ricky Ponting's faith in him. Vaas, continuing his excellent tournament, took three wickets. Australia's pace attack then ripped through the Sri Lankan top order, with Brett Lee (3/35 in 8 overs) taking three early wickets and Glenn McGrath (1/20 in 7 overs) taking one. By the time rain arrived in the 39th over, continued tight bowling had squeezed Sri Lanka to 123 (7 wickets, 38.1 overs), well behind the target given by the Duckworth–Lewis method. This is the match in which Adam Gilchrist famously \"walked\" despite being given not out.\nAfter semi final loss in World Cup, Aravinda de Silva retired from international cricket by making a great hole in the line up. He ended the career as Sri Lanka's greatest batsman and the longest-serving player in international cricket that stretches back nearly two decades. Eighth edition of Asia Cup was held in Sri Lanka with the participation of four test playing Asian nations with two leading Asian associate nations, the UAE and Hong Kong. Atapattu led the Sri Lanka team which contained new young faces in international arena.\nIn the first match, Sri Lanka thrashed UAE by 116 runs. Avishka Gunawardene, whose fine 73 helped Sri Lanka to 239 was enough for the win, and UAE's batsmen were easily dismissed for 123 in 47.5 overs. In the second match, Sri Lanka batted first and scored 282 runs with Mahela Jayawardene's fifty. In chasing, India started poorly and lost 5 wickets for 71 runs. Rahul Dravid scored 82 runs was the only Indian performance in the match. Sri Lanka finally won the match by 12 runs and qualified for the Super Four stage as the favorites to win the tournament.\nDuring Super Four stage, Sri Lanka won the matches Pakistan and Bangladesh to reach consecutive Asia Cup final. Against Bangladesh, Jayasuriya scored his devastating best with an unbeaten 107 runs and Gunawardene scored unbeaten 64. Sri Lanka won the match by 10 wickets with 16 overs to spare. Jayasuriya continued his blistering hitting in the game against India, where he scored 130 runs. With 18 balls left, and 18 runs needed to win the match, Sri Lanka lost the grip with quick wickets of Jayasuriya, Dilshan and Chandana. 11 were needed from the final six balls, Zaheer Khan bowled a magnificent last over to win the game for India by 4 runs. The two opponents met again in the final of the Asia Cup, where Sri Lankans batted first and scored 228 runs. Atapattu top scored with 65 runs. India scored only 203 runs in their 50 overs and Sri Lanka won the Asia Cup for the third time.\nWest Indies islands hosted the 9th Cricket World Cup, where Sri Lanka was led by Mahela Jayawardena. The 12 teams were grouped into four groups, with Sri Lanka in group B. India, Bangladesh and Bermuda played with Sri Lanka in group matches. Bermuda's World Cup debut became the second-heaviest defeat at the World Cup, 40 runs worse than Scotland's defeat the day before. After Sri Lanka won the toss and batted, they scored 321/6 in 50 overs while skipper Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva all collected half-centuries. Kevin Hurdle took two wickets for Bermuda, but his second over lasted 14 balls due to no-balls and wides. Bermuda fell to 20 for four after Lasith Malinga had taken three wickets in three overs, ending with bowling figures of three for 10. With the seven first men down, Lionel Cann paired up with Delyone Borden for a 25-run partnership, the largest of the innings. Farveez Maharoof removed both before Murali had Dwayne Leverock lbw to end the innings for 78, Bermuda's lowest total ever in One-day Internationals. Sri Lanka won the match by 243 runs.\nNext match for Sri Lanka was against Bangladesh, who won the match against India and was in good performance before coming to this match. But Bangladesh's chances of reaching the Super Eights by means of net run rate diminished after a 198-run defeat to Sri Lanka, the third-heaviest of their history and the largest since their 200-run defeat to India in 2003. It was only due to the rain during Bangladesh's innings and the consequently readjusted target that the margin of victory was smaller; Bangladesh were bowled out for 112, with all the Sri Lankan bowlers except Jayasuriya taking wickets, but Jayasuriya had already contributed with seven sixes in his 24th One-day International century as Sri Lanka totalled 318 for four. Spinners Mohammad Rafique and Abdur Razzak were the only ones to keep the economy rate below five an over, while for Sri Lanka only Russel Arnold cost more than five an over. Four Sri Lankan batsmen outscored Bangladesh' top-scoring batsman, Mohammad Ashraful, who made 45 not out from number seven.\nLast group match was against the neighbors-India, who was at the brink of eliminating from the tournament. So the match was highly valuable to Indians than Lankans. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, went through to the second stage unbeaten, after newcomers to the team Upul Tharanga and Chamara Silva both struck half-centuries and Murali took three wickets, including wicket-keeper MS Dhoni for a duck.\nIndian pacer Zaheer Khan started off with a wide, but also had Jayasuriya caught behind in his opening spell, striking at the end of the seventh over, and also had Tharanga in trouble with in-cutters. Tharanga, however, batted through nearly two thirds of the match for his 64, and none of the bowlers kept the run rate below four as Sri Lanka made it to 254 for six, due to poor cricket from India. For Sri Lanka, Vaas struck twice within eleven overs, taking a return catch off Robin Uthappa and having Ganguly caught for a 23-ball seven. Tendulkar followed in the next over, bowled by Dilhara Fernando for his second duck of the tournament, but Virender Sehwag and skipper Rahul Dravid made it through the next ten overs, before the \"turning point\" arrived when Murali had Sehwag caught at first slip in his third over; the next six overs yielded only 14 runs and two more wickets, after Dhoni went lbw to Murali, and India needed 141 runs off 22 overs. Despite double-digit scores from Ajit Agarkar, Harbhajan Singh and Munaf Patel, they were bowled out for 185. India eliminated and Sri Lanka through to Super 8s.\nSuper 8s has gone pretty well for Sri Lankans, with their performances, only lost to South Africa and Australia. In the first Super 8 match for Sri Lanka vs South Africa, Malinga took four wickets with four consecutive deliveries in international cricket. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat, and lost their first five wickets for 98, with Charl Langeveldt taking two in his first spell. Tillakaratne Dilshan and Russel Arnold built a sixth-wicket stand of 97 in nearly 20 overs, but Dilshan was caught off Makhaya Ntini's bowling, and then Langeveldt took 3 in 5 balls as Sri Lanka were bowled out in the final over for 209. In reply, Vaas had AB de Villiers bowled in the first over, but Jacques Kallis added 95 with Graeme Smith and 65 with Herschelle Gibbs, leading South Africa to within four runs of victory with his 86. Then Lasith Malinga struck and show begun. His four-in-four had Shaun Pollock, Andrew Hall, Kallis and Ntini. Though South Africa managed a run off Vaas in the intermediate over. South Africa now needed three runs to win with one wicket in hand, and eleven deliveries went by before Robin Peterson got an outside edge to a Malinga ball, which went out of reach of slip and went fine for four. South Africa won the match by only 1 wicket, in a very tied game. With this feat, Lasith Malinga became the only bowler to get four consecutive wickets in four balls in any form of the game.\nNext match was against the hosts-West Indies. The start of the match was delayed due to bad weather, but a full 50-over match was played, which resulted in West Indies' third defeat in four days. Jayasuriya and Jayawardene added 183 for the third wicket, before Dilshan came in and took 39 off 22 deliveries as the final eleven overs yielded 84 runs. In the meantime, Jayasuriya scored his 35th ODI century, the second most prolific ODI century maker in history after Tendulkar. In reply, West Indies needed 170 off 94 when Ramnaresh Sarwan was stumped off Jayasuriya; they only got 56 of those, and were bowled out for 190, with four batsmen out in single figures. Sri Lanka won the match by huge 113 runs.\nAgainst England, the match again became a nail biter. Sri Lanka batted first and made 235, bowled out off the last ball with a run out. England lost their openers for 0 and 10, but Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen made a stand of 90 for the third wicket, and skipper Paul Collingwood joined Pietersen to add a further 25 before Pietersen was caught and bowled by Murali. England then lost two more wickets for seven runs to Dilhara Fernando, and required 103 off 16.3 overs with four wickets in hand. However, Ravi Bopara scored a half-century in his fourth One-Day International innings, as he and Paul Nixon took England within three runs of victory. However, Fernando returned for the last over, and bowled Bopara off the last ball giving Sri Lanka victory. During the match, Jayasuriya became the most capped ODI player, surpassing Tendulkar. Sri Lanka won two of last three matches -won against New Zealand and Ireland, lost to Australia, secured their place to semi-finals.\nIn the semi-final, Sri Lanka met New Zealand again, where Sri Lanka scored 289/7 courtesy of century by skipper Jayawardena. New Zealand only scored 208 runs and eliminated from the World Cup. Sri Lanka selected for their second final in World Cups, against same opponent as in 1996-Australians. Aussie skipper Ricky Ponting won the toss and elected to bat. However, the start of play was delayed due to rain, and the match was reduced to 38 overs per side. Gilchrist played an incredible innings of 149 – the highest for any batsman in a World Cup final – to give Australia an imposing total going in at the break. But the innings was in controversy due to Gilchrist usage of squash ball inside the left glove.\nWhile Sri Lankan batsmen Sangakkara and Jayasuriya were adding 116 for the second wicket, the contest was alive, but after the pair got out, Sri Lanka's chances slowly diminished. Further rain forced the reduction of Sri Lanka's innings to just 36 overs, with the target revised to 269. At the end of the 33rd over, with Sri Lanka still trailing the adjusted D/L target by 37 runs, the umpires suspended the game due to bad light. While Australia's players began to celebrate their victory (since the minimum 20 overs had been reached), the umpires incorrectly announced that because the match was suspended due to light and not rain, the final three overs would have to be bowled the following day. With Sri Lanka needing 61 runs from 18 deliveries, Jayawardene agreed there was no need to return the following day, and instructed his team to resume batting, with Ponting agreeing to play only spinners. The umpires later apologised for their error: the match should have ended then with Australia winning by 37 runs. The last three overs were played in almost complete darkness, during which Sri Lanka added just nine runs, giving Australia a 53-run victory by the D-L method, as Sri Lanka had batted two overs fewer than they had.\nThe first edition of World Twenty20 World Championship, which was hosted by South Africa. Sri Lanka played under the captaincy of Mahela Jayawardena in Group C along with New Zealand and Kenya. First match was against Kenyans, which was a world record-breaking match.

Sangakkara bowled by Jimmy Kamande when the score was 94 in 9 overs. The show time begun then, where Jayasuriya and Jayawardena scored unfaithfully for all the bowlers. Jayasuriya caught when he was in magnificent 88, with 11 fours and 4 sixes. Jayawardena on the other hand, played a brilliant innings, scored 65 from just 27 ball when until he was lbw. Sri Lanka was 215/6 in 18 overs, when Jehan Mubarak came to the crease. He scored an unbelievable sixes down the ground to Nehemiah Odhiambo and Peter Ongondo.

However, this only stood for a matter of hours, as Chris Gayle scored 62.38% of West Indies' total. West Indies scored just 101 all out in their 20 overs. Angelo Mathews proved his ability also with the ball, where he took first 3 wickets of West Indian top order. Sri Lanka easily moved to their first T20 International final.

Misbah stayed not out till the end for a well made 83, kept Pakistan to 277/7 at the end.\nSri Lanka started off with a very good reply, with their openers Tharanga and Dilshan accelerating steadily after a slow start to add 76 in just over 14 overs until Hafeez had Tharanga caught at point. This was the turning point of the match, as three more wickets, including that of Dilshan fell soon after to leave Sri Lanka tottering at 96/4. Sangakkara rode his luck with Kamran missing two stumpings off him, and staged a recovery with Chamara Silva, but his luck eventually ran out as the required run rate went up, with Afridi having him caught at long on one short of his fifty. Jayawadena was bowled by pacer Shoaib Akhtar with a magnificent in swing. Silva struggled to time the ball early in his innings, being 16 off 49 balls at one point, but he then accelerated rapidly to reach his half-century, but Afridi returned to remove dangerous looking Angelo Mathews. Silva eventually fell for 57 when Kamran did get a stumping right, and despite Kulasekara's cameo, Sri Lanka ended up 11 short.\nIn the next match against Kenyans, Malinga took a hat-trick, the second in his career. He became the first bowler to take two World Cup hat-tricks, and the fourth bowler to take two career ODI hat-tricks. Sri Lanka comfortably chased the target of 146 by giving one wicket only.\nSri Lanka against Australia match was abandoned due to heavy rain. In the next match against Zimbabwe, Tharanga and Dilshan set a new World Cup record for the opening partnership, scoring 282 runs, beating the previous record of 194. It was also the first occasion in a World Cup that both openers made a century. With their victory over Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka became the first team to qualify for the quarter-finals of the tournament. In reply, Zimbabwe made a good start, but were dismissed for 188 runs with 11 overs spare. As in previous wins against New Zealand, this New Zealand vs Sri Lanka match was not a surprising one, because Lankans were the better ones to win the match even before the match. Skipper Sangakkara scored 111 runs and Lankans got 265/9. Blackcaps struggled from the very first ball, where they were all out for 153.\nIn the quarterfinals, Sri Lankan counterpart was England. England total of 229 was easily reached by Dilshan and Tharanga. Both made centuries as Sri Lanka chased down a target by ten wickets. This run chase set a new record for the highest successful run chase in a ten-wicket victory in ODI history. Sri Lanka qualified easily for the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, for a second consecutive time, Sri Lanka defeated New Zealand in the semi-finals of the World Cup and made it to the finals. This match marked the last match Murali played on Sri Lankan soil. Sri Lanka won the match by 5 wickets and reached their first consecutive World Cup final, this time against India.\nSri Lanka started the innings slowly, constrained by good bowling from Zaheer and committed fielding from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, and Virat Kohli inside the 30-yard circle. Zaheer began with three consecutive maidens and the wicket of Tharanga, conceding only six runs in his five-over spell. Dilshan was bowled by Harbhajan when a delivery carried on to the stumps after deflecting off his gloves. Sangakkara came in after Tharanga's dismissal, and was building a solid foundation with Dilshan before the latter was dismissed. Jayawardene came to the crease when Sri Lanka were 60/2 in the 17th over. Sangakkara and Mahela went about the task of consolidating the innings, but eventually Sangakkara was caught behind by Dhoni at 48. New batsman Thilan Samaraweera was adjudged not out by the umpire when a ball hit his thigh pad off the bowling of Yuvraj Singh. The Indians decided to review the decision and he was ultimately given out. Chamara Kapugedera, who was playing his first World Cup match, was caught off a deceptive slower ball by Zaheer Khan. Jayawardene, meanwhile, continued with his quality batting, ultimately scoring 103 not out from 88 balls in a high-class batting display. Helped by the hard-hitting of Kulasekara and Thisara, Sri Lanka scored 91 runs in the last 10 overs, including 63 in the batting powerplay (45–50 overs) to take the score to 274/6.\nIndia had a shaky start, with Sehwag and Tendulkar both early by Malinga, leaving them struggling at 31 for two. Kohli and Gautam Gambhir started the recovery with some fluent stroke play and quick running between wickets, taking India to 114 before Kohli was caught-and-bowled by Dilshan for 35. When he was on 30, Gambhir mistimed a shot off the bowling of Suraj Randiv, sending the ball high up in the air, but Kulasekara could not hold on to a difficult chance at long off. Kohli and Gambhir put together an 83-run partnership before Kohli's dismissal. Dhoni came in after Kohli to bat at number five. Gambhir and Dhoni added 109 for the fourth wicket with Gambhir scoring 97. Gambhir tried to finish his century with a boundary, but was bowled by Thisara. Following Gambhir's dismissal, 52 runs were required off 52 balls. Yuvraj and Dhoni took India to victory, and Dhoni sealed the match hitting a six off Kulasekara, when only 4 runs were required off 11 balls. Dhoni finished on 91 not out from 79 deliveries. With this defeat, Sri Lanka lost their second consecutive World Cup final defeat in ODIs. After the match, Murali retired from all international cricket at the greatest spin bowler ever in world cricket.\nThe eleventh edition of Asia Cup was held in Bangladesh. Only four test playing nations were participated. The series was highlighted as a black mark in Sri Lanka's Asia Cup history. Mahela Jayawardene led the team which seemed to be a powerful line up. In the first match, Sri Lanka lost to India by 50 runs. Sangakkara and Jayawardene scored fifties, but it was not enough to overcome the century scored by Indian Virat Kohli. In the second match against Pakistan, Sri Lanka bowled out for 188 runs where 7 batsmen got out for single digit scores. Sangakkara scored 71 runs and Upul Tharanga, who was pushed to 6th batting position scored a fifty. Pakistan chased down the target in 40th over with a bonus point. Sri Lanka played final pool game against Bangladesh, where Bangladesh won the match by 5 wickets in D/L method. Again, Sri Lanka's top order collapsed where middle order rebuilt the innings up to respectable total of 232. Sri Lanka failed to qualify for the final of the Asia Cup for the first time. It is also the eighth time in Asia and the second time in multi-team tournaments in the subcontinent that Sri Lanka have failed to win a single match.\nFinally, Sri Lanka hosted a World T20 after being the runner-up in 2011 Cricket World Cup. This is the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 tournament held in an Asian country, the last three having been held in South Africa, England and the West Indies. Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga has been chosen as the event ambassador of the tournament by ICC. Sri Lanka was led by Mahela Jayawarderna for the second time after 2007 World Twenty20. Sri Lanka played in Group C with South Africa and Zimbabwe. All group matches were held in Hambantota.\nThe first match of the tournament was between the Hosts and Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe won the toss and put Sri Lanka in to bat. They finished with 182/4 in 20 overs, giving a huge task for their opponents. Zimbabwe came to the crease, but didn't take too long to be dismissed for 100 runs on the board. Ajantha Mendis was all over the vultures, where he took 6 wickets for 8 runs, giving Sri Lanka an 82 run victory. This is the best bowling figures in Twenty20 International history, that was previously also held by Mendis against Aussies with 6 for 13.\nIn the next against Proteas, rain interrupted in numerous occasions, which gave only 7 over per side match. South Africa batted first and AB de Villiers smashed 30 runs from 13 balls, where they finished with 78/4 in 7 overs. Sri Lanka was not good at all, only scored 46/5, no any batsmen scored more than 15 runs. South Africa won the match by 32 runs, which is a huge margin in T20s. However, both team qualified for the Super 8s.\nSri Lanka played in Group 1 with West Indies, England, and New Zealand. Against New Zealand, the match was tied, where both teams scored 174. But, Sri Lanka had good chance to win the match, wickets in last over and misunderstandings gave a tied game. However, Sri Lanka won the Super Over and won the match. In the next two matches, Sri Lanka won very easily against West Indies and England.\nThe Sri Lankan third consecutive World T20 semi-final was against Pakistanis. Sri Lanka scored 139/4, where Mahela paced the innings with his 42 runs. While chasing, skipper Mohammad Hafeez scored 40 runs, all the other players were undone by Rangana Herath. The 16 runs victory gave Sri Lankans to win their first T20 title, which was against West Indies.\nAfter Chris Gayle, who had decimated Australia in the semifinals, was dismissed for just 3 to leave the West Indies at 2-14 after 5.5 overs, Marlon Samuels produced 78 from 55 balls, including the longest six of the tournament at 108 meters. Captain Darren Sammy also led a late charge that produced 108 runs in the latter 10 overs to set Sri Lanka a target of 138. They then restricted Sri Lanka to 39/1 after eight overs, produced two run outs and held each Sri Lankan batsman to no more than 33 (posted by captain Mahela Jayawardene). Kulasekara mustered a brief fightback (26 runs from 16 balls) but holed out to leave the tail end exposed, and Sri Lanka was soon all out 36 runs short. Samuels earned Man of the Match honours for being the top-scoring batsman on either side while also taking 1–15 in his four overs of bowling. For the first time, a host nation (Sri Lanka) competed in the final of the ICC World Twenty20. Ajantha Mendis was the highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets.\nThe twelfth edition of Asia Cup was held in Bangladesh with the participation of four test playing nations and Associate member Afghanistan. After a disastrous previous Asia Cup in 2012, Sri Lanka went to the tournament with many bilateral ODI series wins. Angelo Mathews captained the team, with permanent opener Tillakaratne Dilshan pulled out from the series due to injury. In the first match, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan by 12 runs courtesy of five wicket haul by Malinga. In batting, new opener Lahiru Thirimanne scored a magnificent hundred. Malinga took his 250th ODI wicketat 163 matches and became the fastest Sri Lankan to achieve the milestone. In the next match, Sangakkara scored an under-pressure 83-ball century to help Sri Lanka beat India by two wickets. Ajantha Mendis took four wickets for 60 runs in his comeback match.\nIn the next match, Sangakkara continued his sublime form in the Asia Cup to guide Sri Lanka to a massive 129-run win over Afghanistan. This was the first encounter between the two team in international level as well. With this win, Sri Lanka qualified for the Asia Cup final. Sri Lanka defeated Bangladesh by 3 wickets in their final pool game. Bangladesh scored 204 runs after batting first. Sri Lanka had a shaky start, when Kusal Perera gone for duck in the second ball of the first over. At one stage, Sri Lanka were 75 for 5, until Angelo Mathews and Chaturanga de Silva added match winning partnership for the sixth wicket.\nIn the final against Pakistan, Sri Lanka were the favorites to win the title. Pakistan batted first and scored 260 runs with the held of Fawad Alam's unbeaten century. Malinga took his sixth ODI five-wicket haul, which was also the third against Pakistan. Sri Lankan openers contributed with 56-run partnership until Kusal Perera stumped for Saeed Ajmal. In the very next ball, Ajmal took the wicket of Sangakkara, by handing a golden duck. Then Jayawardene along with Thirimanne had a 156-run partnership guiding the team to victory. Thirimanne scored 101 runs and Sri Lanka won the match and Asia Cup by 5 wickets. Thirimanne finished as the highest run scorer of the series with 279 runs and won the player of the series award. Malinga became the highest wicket taker with 11 wickets and won the man of the match award in the final.\nAs the runner-up of previous World T20 competition, Sri Lanka went Bangladesh under the captaincy of Dinesh Chandimal to 2014 ICC World Twenty20. In the group stage at Super 10 stage, they played with South Africa, New Zealand, England, and Netherlands. In the first match, Sri Lanka played with South Africa. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat first. They had a good understanding about Bangladeshi pitches, due to Bangladesh bilateral tournament and 2014 Asia Cup, which was held prior to the World T20 at the same site. Sri Lankan opener Kusal Perera reminded all sorts of aggressive shots by legendary Sanath Jayasuriya. Kusal's master stroke was a photocopy of Jayasuriya and he devastated Dale Steyn, Morné Morkel, and Lonwabo Tsotsobe. He scored 61 runs off 40 balls giving Sri Lanka a total of 165/7. South Africans was not down as yet, where they progressively built the innings. With the wickets in crucial intervals, they ended up in the losing side with 5 runs short. Kusal was the Man-of-the-Match.\nThe next match was against talented Netherlands, who show their powerful strokes against Ireland in this tournament. But all those stroke play was undone by magnificent bowling by Mathews, Kulasekara, and Malinga. Dutch were all out for 39 runs, which is the \nlowest by any team in a T20I match. Sri Lanka chased this easy target by 5 overs, which also earns Biggest victory in terms of balls remaining in all T20I.\nIn the very next match against England, beat Sri Lanka by 6 wickets with courtesy of unbeaten 116 by Alex Hales. Sri Lanka batted first and scored 189/4. Mahela scored 89 runs. England always maintained the required run rate very well, which gave them a fast hitting in last few overs. England scored 190/4 in 19.2 and won the match.\nThe last group match was a thrilling match for both teams, where Sri Lanka came as the favorites to win the match. Skipper Chandimal was out of play due to some injuries, so Lasith Malinga captained the match. By batting first, Sri Lanka scored only 119 all out, Mahela scored 25 runs as the best batsman. Blackcaps came to the crease as the favorites to win the match, because 120 is not a huge task at all to them as smashers - Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, and Corey Anderson. During the match, Anderson was injured and so New Zealand played with only 10 players in batting. New Zealand started pretty well with Guptill and Kane Williamson. At this time, Malinga decided to go with Rangana Herath, who turned the match in nowhere. Herath ball Guptill and he lunges forward to push to mid-on. Sets off for a single straight away but his partner is not at all interested. The bowler is wise to the mistake, rushes across to his right and cuts the ball in its path and sends in a rocket throw and Sangakkara whips the bails off. After this run-out, it wall all Herath. He stumped skipper McCullum, then caught Ross Taylor to lbw. Next, Herath bowled James Neesham in first ball he faced. He then captured Luke Ronchi for lbw, and New Zealand were never in the game. Finally New Zealand all out for just 60 runs, which is the lowest score by a test playing nation in Twenty20 Internationals. Herath finished with 5 wickets for 3 runs, earned him Man-of-the-match. With this win, Sri Lanka moved their fourth consecutive World T20 semi-finals.\nThe semi-finals was against defending World T20 champions- West Indies. Malinga again led the team. But this time, Lankans were all over West Indies, where Sri Lanka scored 160/6. In chasing, West Indies was 80/4 when rain came into play. Rain and hail ended the match after 13.5 overs in the West Indies' innings. Their par score was 107 runs according to the Duckworth–Lewis method. So, Sri Lanka won by 27 runs in D/L method. At the presentation, West Indies skipper Darren Sammy stated that, \"rain and god gave Sanga and Mehela\" a big farewell party. This World Cup belongs to them. So, good luck to both of them\". The final was not easy at all, with their opposition being a difficult one - India. The match was led by Malinga for third time, where he gave permanent T20I captaincy.\nSri Lanka and India had played each other over sixty times in the last seven years, with India winning the majority of the matches. During the tournament India was the only unbeaten team heading into the final, whereas Sri Lanka had lost a group match to England. Despite this, statistically there had been little between the two teams during the tournament. India, sent into bat by Sri Lanka after they won the toss, posted 130 runs in their 20 overs. Virat Kohli top scored with 77, but Yuvraj Singh's 11 runs off 21 balls slowed the innings momentum in the final overs. Malinga and Kulasekara showcased outstanding death bowling, where Kohli and Dhoni could not capitalize. Sri Lanka reached 134 runs in 17.5 overs with the loss of 4 wickets. Kumar Sangakkara, playing his last Twenty20 international match, guided Sri Lanka home with an unbeaten 52 runs. Sangakkara was named Player of the Match, while Kohli was named Player of the Tournament. After all losses in major World Cups in 4 times, Sri Lanka finally ended with Champions. With this match, Mahela and Sanga retired from twenty20 internationals. The words of Sammy became true at last.\nThe World cup was hosted by Australia and New Zealand in 2015. Sri Lanka was captained by Angelo Mathews. The first match was against New Zealand, where Blackcaps scored a huge total of 331/6 with blasted innings of Corey Anderson. Sri Lanka opened with very well, but the wickets in crucial intervals gave them a backward push. Lahiru Thirimanne scored 65 runs, and finally Sri Lanka bowled out for 233, with 98 runs lost at the end.\nThe next match was against debut World Cup contestants- Afghanistan. Afghanistan got off to a solid start before both their openers were dismissed off consecutive overs and the score read 40/2 in the tenth over. Asghar Stanikzai and Samiullah Shenwari built a steady third-wicket partnership which was broken when Afghanistan had reached 128 in the 28th over. Following this, Afghanistan started losing wickets at regular intervals to the Sri Lankan pace bowlers before finally being bowled out for 232 in 49.4 overs. Malinga and Mathews picked 3 wickets each for Sri Lanka.\nSri Lanka's innings got off to a disastrous start as both openers fell for ducks within the second over, which was the second time in ODI history where this has occurred. Then in the sixth over, they lost the wicket of Sangakkara with the score at 18/3. They slipped into further trouble when Dimuth Karunaratne was dismissed in the 12th over with the Sri Lankan total still at 51. Then the maestro Jayawardene came to the crease. He and Mathews then added 126 runs for the fifth wicket and Mathews was run out for 44 and Jayawardene was dismissed soon after completing his 19th ODI hundred. Thisara, who came in to bat with Sri Lanka in a precarious position of 178/6, struck an unbeaten 47 from 26 balls to guide his team to a four-wicket win with ten balls to spare.\nAgainst Bangladesh, Sri Lanka off to a flier with magnificent hundreds by Dilshan (161*) and Sangakkara (105*). With this century, Dilshan broke the earlier record of highest individual score by a Sri Lankan in World Cups by Aravinda (144). This century is also the highest individual score in an ODI without hitting a six. Bangladesh only scored 240/10 and Sri Lanka won the match by 92 runs.\nNext match was against British men, where English captain Eoin Morgan won the toss and elected to bat first. England openers started solidly, but, from 62/0, the innings was reduced to 101/3 in the 21st over. Joe Root and Morgan added 60 runs for the 4th wicket before the dismissal of Morgan. The fifth wicket partnership between Root and James Taylor yielded 98 runs in 11 overs. Taylor fell for 25, following which Root was also dismissed for a 108-ball 121. England were 265/6 in the 47th over, before Jos Buttler struck an unbeaten 39 in 19 balls to take the total to 309/6 at the end of 50 overs.\nSri Lankan innings began with Thirimanne being dropped on 3. His opening partner Dilshan was out for 44 immediately after their partnership had reached 100 runs. Sangakkara joined Thirimanne and the left-hand duo punished the England bowlers with each of the batsmen making hundreds. Thirimanne struck a six off the third ball of the 48th over to complete an emphatic 9-wicket victory. Thirimanne remained unbeaten on a 143-ball 139, while Sangakkara won the Man of the Match for his unbeaten 117 off just 86 balls. This was Sangakkara second consecutive century.\nThe match against Australians was a real thriller. Australia batted first where they posted a huge 376/9, with the help of brutal 51 ball century of Glenn Maxwell. Sri Lanka chasing was not good at first, where Thirimanne was got out early. but then Dilshan joined Sangakkara to a 196 run partnership. Dilshan hit six fours off an over, bowled by Mitchell Johnson, which was the first time this has happened in World Cup history. After dismissal of Dilshan, the middle-order failed to gain partnerships with Sangakkara, who batting really well. Sangakkara scored his third consecutive century. With Sanga's wicket, Sri Lanka lost wickets quickly and scored 312/9 in 50 overs. Australia won the match by 64 runs. In the last group stage match, Sri Lanka easily defeated Scotland by 148 runs. Sangakkara scored his fourth consecutive century by scoring 124 runs. He became the first batsman in ODI history to score 4 consecutive ODI centuries'. Sri Lanka scored 363/9. Scotland only scored 215 runs.\nIn the quarter-final, Sri Lanka met South Africans. The match was a shock to all the fans across the globe, where Sri Lanka scored 133 runs all out. Sanga scored 45 runs and all the others were struggled by South African impressive bowling attack- Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir. South Africa won the match very easily, only one wicket fell. With this match, Sanga and Jayawardena ended their ODI career. This match gave Lankans, their first defeat without making for the semi-finals after 1999 World Cup.\nThe 2016 Asia Cup was held in Bangladesh from 24 February to 6 March 2016. It was the 13th edition of the Asia Cup, the fifth to be held in Bangladesh, and the first to be played using the T20I format. This is due to Asian Cricket Council agreed to play Asia Cup in both ODI and T20I formats in rotational basis with the upcoming ICC major event. Four test playing nations with associate member UAE were participated to the tournament. Sri Lanka entered to the tournament as the defending champions from previous edition and champions of 2014 World Twenty20. They were the No.1 ranked team in T20I arena at the time. Lasith Malinga led the team in Asia Cup.\nIn the first match against UAE, Sri Lanka only managed to score 129 runs. It is their lowest total against an Associate nation in T20Is. However, with brilliant bowling by Malinga and Kulasekara, Sri Lanka won the match by 14 runs. Malinga took 4 for 26 and Kulasekara took 3 for 10 in the match. After the first match, Malinga was injured again and left out from the tournament. In the next match against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka lost by 23 runs. This was recorded as the first win by Bangladesh against Sri Lanka in T20Is. Sri Lanka lost to India and then to Pakistan very cheaply and removed from the Asia cup. During the tournament, Tillakaratne Dilshan became the first player to score 200 fours in T20Is.\nOne of the major upsets in Sri Lankan cricket history came during this World Twenty20 series, which was held in India. Prior to the World Twenty20, Sri Lanka played 5 cricket series but lost every series with single victory against West Indies (lost to Pakistan, New Zealand, India and 2016 Asia Cup). Permanent captain Lasith Malinga injured throughout all series, new Sri Lanka cricket selection committee appointed Angelo Mathews as the captain for World Twenty20, and Malinga eventually dropped from the squad quickly due to injury.\nLost both practice matches to New Zealand and Pakistan, Sri Lanka entered into the Super 10 stage as the underdogs, not as the defending champions. First match was against Afghanistan, where they batted first and scored 153/7 in 20 overs with brilliant fifty by afghan captain Asghar Stanikzai. Sri Lanka started the chasing with a magnificent start, where they took 41 runs in powerplay. Chandimal eventually got out for 18 runs and Thirimanne also backed him in to pavilion after scored 6 runs. Thisara Perera and Chamara Kapugedera scored some shots, but the key performance came from the veteran Tillakaratne Dilshan. He scored unbeaten 83 runs by 56 runs, guided the team to win first match in the series.\nSecond match was against West Indies, where they looked so strong in the group. Sri Lanka batted first and only managed to score 122/9 in 20 overs. Few poor umpire decision gone wrong way to the Lankans as well, where lbw decision for Dilshan was highly criticised by the commentators. West Indies came to the crease, where Gayle was not in the frame. With the fast start with Andre Fletcher, Windies won the match by 7 wickets.\nThird and most important match in the group came against England. England batted first and scored 171/4 with Jos Buttler's magnificent fifty. Sri Lanka in the chase, again looked so poor, where 50 runs for 5 wickets after 9 overs. The defending champions were on the brink of a huge defeat in the match, Angelo Mathews came to the crease. He with Kapugedera smashed England spinner in all corners where the match went down to the wire at the end. With falling wickets in regular intervals, Sri Lanka lost the match by 10 runs at the end, where skipper Mathews played a gem of an innings with a hamstring injury. But his 54 ball 73 was not enough at the end and Sri Lanka along with South Africa were eliminated from the World Twenty20.\nLast match for Sri Lanka was against South Africa, which was the match for the pride for both teams. Sri Lankan start was superb, where Chandimal and Dilshan easily hit through all areas with ease. But with Chandimal got out to Aaron Phangiso, Sri Lanka batting card falling one after the other. With 19.3 overs, Sri Lanka were all out for just 120 runs. South Africa won the match easily by 8 wickets at the end. Throughout the tournament, no any Sri Lankan batsmen has been successful, where veteran Dilshan's 83 was the highest by a Sri Lankan at this World Twenty20. The poor performances in all three departments gave their losses in the tour.\nSince the retirement of three legends (Sangakkara, Mahela and Dilshan), Sri Lankan strength collapsed in a regular manner. With the start of 2016-17 cricket season just after the 2016 ICC World Twenty20, Sri Lanka showed a clear decrease in all three formats of the game, hence moved deeper in the ICC Rankings. In the year 2017, Sri Lanka played 13 Tests, 29 ODIs and 15 T20Is. In 13 Tests, Sri Lanka won 4 and lost 7 matches. In 29 ODIs, Sri Lanka only won 5 and lost 23 matches including three 5-0 whitewashes. In 15 T20Is, they won 5 and lost 10 matches. At the start of 2017, Sri Lanka was in a tour for South Africa and already lost the test series. Sri Lanka won the T20I series 2–1, their first ever series win in any format in South Africa, despite South Africa have been rested many major players for the series. The ODI series was not so good however, where they faced a 5-0 whitewash.\nAfter South Africa tour, Sri Lanka went Australia for a 3-match T20I series. With magical performances by newcomer Asela Gunaratne, Sri Lanka won the series 2–1. In March, Sri Lanka hosted Bangladesh for a full series, but things went wrong in their home soil. Test series was drawn 1-1, by giving Bangladesh, their first Test win against Sri Lanka. The ODI series was also drawn 1–1, whereas the T20I series also finished 1–1.\nThe biggest event in 2017 was 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. Sri Lanka competed in the group B along with India, Pakistan and South Africa. In the first match, South Africa won the match by 96 runs. Then in the second match, Sri Lanka won the match against India by recording Sri Lanka's joint-highest successful run-chase in ODIs and the highest successful run chase by any team in the history of the Champions Trophy. However against Pakistan, Sri Lanka lost the match and were eliminated, largely due to poor fielding performances.\nAfter the Champions Trophy, Zimbabwe toured Sri Lanka and this time, Zimbabwe showcased their strength in ODI arena. Sri Lanka lost the series 3–2, giving Zimbabweans their first ever series win against Sri Lanka. The captaincy of Mathews was highly criticized after the loss and Mathews said that the defeat was \"one of the lowest points in his career\" and stepped down as captain of the team in all three formats the following day. Under the new captain Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka won the one-off test by recording the highest successful run chase by any team in a Test in Asia, and the highest successful chase by Sri Lanka in Tests.\nSri Lanka then met India in a home series with some confidence with their latest test win and win against India in the Champions Trophy. But the all three formats went wrong for Sri Lanka, where they lost all 9 matches in the series, including 3 Tests, 5 ODIs and one-off T20I. Sri Lanka bagged many worst records in this series. The 5-0 ODI whitewash recorded as the first time Sri Lanka had suffered a whitewash at home in ODIs. Sri Lanka tried many captains throughout the series, but no one showed success.\nWith reduced performances in all formats and without many key players, Sri Lanka went to the UAE for a complete series against Pakistan. They only won the Test series 2–0, which was recorded as the first ever win by a visiting team against Pakistan in the UAE. The second Test match in the series was also the first day/night Test for Sri Lanka. The confidence booster in the test series did not passed to limited over internationals, where they suffered their third 5-0 ODI series whitewash as well. Sri Lanka became the first side to be whitewashed 5–0 three times in ODIs in the same calendar year, after previously losing to South Africa in January and India in August.\nSri Lanka's last fixture for 2017 was against India again but now in their home conditions. With the some fight in the Test series, India won the series 1–0 with two draws. With 12 consecutive defeats in ODI arena, Sri Lanka moved to Dharamsala for the 3-match ODI series. In the first ODI, Suranga Lakmal used swinging and seaming bowling performance to rip through Indian batting line-up to restrict them to 112, which is India's third-lowest in ODIs at home and their lowest at home when batting first. Sri Lanka finally won the match by 7 wickets. This win gave Lankans their first win after 12 consecutive ODI losses in 2017. The next two matches were belong to India, where Sri Lanka lost the series 2–1. India won the T20I series as well 3–0.\nThe year 2017 is highlighted as a black mark in Sri Lanka cricket in all three formats, specially in the ODI arena. They moved to number 7 and 8 in World Rankings. Many officials and players were continuously changed, where many players earned international debuts.\nThe 14th edition of Asia Cup was held in the UAE for the third time. Five test playing nations with Hong Kong were participated to the tournament. Sri Lanka added another black mark to their golden history and eliminated from the tournament within three days span. Angelo Mathews named as the captain of the team and veteran pacer Lasith Malinga was recalled for the ODI team after a year. Sri Lanka was in Group B along with Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Bangladesh faced Sri Lanka in the opening game of the tournament, where Bangladesh posted 261 in their 50 overs. Malinga made a good comeback with two wickets in the first over of the match. He finished with 4 for 23 runs. Tharanga started the chase very positive, where he hit 4 fours and 1 six. But with wickets in regular intervals, Sri Lanka scored only 124 runs and lost the match by 137 runs. This loss is recorded as the biggest loss by Sri Lanka in Asia Cup history and lowest total against Bangladesh in ODIs. This is also the biggest defeat for any of the three major Asian teams - India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka - in the Asia Cup. In the next game, Sri Lanka played rising Afghanistan. Sri Lanka shocked by a 91-run loss to Afghans largely due to poor fielding and batting. This is Sri Lanka's first defeat against Afghanistan. Afghans scored 249 runs after batting first. Thisara Perera took a five-wicket haul in the match. In reply, Tharanga top scored with 36 runs and others were fallen to the Afghan spinners.\nThe World cup was hosted by England and Wales in 2019. Sri Lanka was captained by Dimuth Karunaratne. Even though he captained Sri Lanka test team with two memorable wins against South Africa in South Africa, Karunaratne last played ODIs for Sri Lanka in 2015 World Cup. The first match was against New Zealand, where Sri Lanka bowled out for 136 runs in 29.2 overs. Karunaratne scored an unbeaten fifty, where eight players scored less than 10 runs. Karunaratne became the second cricketer to carry his bat in a World Cup match. New Zealand started World Cup campaign with a comfortable victory with 10 wickets win. Against rising Afghanistan in the second match, Sri Lanka again scored sub par total of 201 runs, where Kusal Perera top scored with 78 runs. Sri Lankan bowlers led by Malinga and Nuwan Pradeep secured the match for Sri Lanka by restricting Afghans for 152 runs. With career best 4 wickets for 31 runs, Pradeep won man of the match award.\nThe next two games against Pakistan and Bangladesh were washed out due to rain which earned Sri Lanka two points to move up in the table. Sri Lanka played against Australia in the next match, where Australia won by 87 runs. Australia batted first and scored 334 runs with the century by Aaron Finch. During the chase, Sri Lankan openers made a solid foundation with 115 runs in 15 overs. Kusal was dismissed for 52 and then Karunaratne dismissed for 97 runs. After the two wickets, Australia took the momentum back and restricted Sri Lanka for 247 runs.\nWith two big losses and two abandoned games, Sri Lanka was at the brink of eliminating from the World Cup. However, they continued to dominate against favorites and eventual World Cup champions and hosts England for the fourth consecutive time in World Cup history. Sri Lanka batted first and scored modest total of 232/9. Mathews top scored with unbeaten 85 runs. In the chase of England, Malinga struck on the second ball of the match to dismiss Jonny Bairstow and then James Vince for 14. Wickets at regular intervals slowed down the England chase, where Dhananjaya de Silva took two wickets in one over to favor the game towards Sri Lanka. English allrounder Ben Stokes continued to delayed Sri Lanka's victory, where he scored unbeaten 82 runs. Finally England lost the match by 20 runs. With 4 for 43, veteran Malinga won man of the match award. With this shocking win, the race for the final four was reopened and England was in trouble to move to the semi-finals. During the match, Malinga became the fourth bowler to take 50 wickets in World Cup history after fellow Sri Lanka Muralitharan, Pakistani pacer Wasim Akram and Aussie pacer Glenn McGrath. He also became the quickest to achieve the milestone with 26 innings in World Cups.\nIn the next match which was a must win game for Sri Lanka to continue their hopes to final four, Sri Lanka lost the match against South Africa by 9 wickets. No any Sri Lanka scored above 50 in the match. As a result of the match, Sri Lanka eliminated from the World Cup along with Bangladesh. The next match was against West Indies. Sri Lanka batted first and posted a total of 338/6. In the match, Avishka Fernando scored his maiden ODI century, becoming the youngest Sri Lankan to score a World Cup century. In reply, West Indies were under control for most of the innings, where young batsman Nicholas Pooran also scored his maiden ODI century. This was the first time in World Cup history that two men under the age of 25 scored hundreds in the same match. Then comes the craziest ball of the tournament, where Angelo Mathews bowled the 48th over of the chase, having not bowled a single ball previously in this World Cup or, in any ODI since December 2017. In his first ball, Pooran edged the ball and was dismissed. This turned the match again towards Sri Lanka. Finally, Sri Lanka won the match by 23 runs. In the final match of the tournament, Sri Lanka played against India. Sri Lanka scored 264 in fifty overs powered by the century of Angelo Mathews. This was his third ODI century, where all three came against India. India chased down the target in 43rd over and won the match by 7 wickets. Sri Lanka finished the tournament as sixth in the table with 3 wins, 4 losses and 2 abandoned matches.\n2020s.\nOnce the No. 1 T20 side in the world, Sri Lanka forced to play in a qualifying tournament in order to gain entry to the 2020 T20 World Cup due to lower rankings. Sri Lanka slipped to ninth on the T20 rankings after losing 12 of their 16 most-recent matches in 2018 thus did not gained automatic entry into the \"Super 12\" round. Instead, Sri Lanka will have to finish in the top two in a group of four in the opening round of the competition, in order to progress into the part of the tournament into which the eight top teams gain automatic entry.\nSri Lanka started their World Cup campaign with a comfortable win against Namibia with 7 wickets. Namibia batted first and only scored 96 runs, where Maheesh Theekshana ripped through the Namibian batting line-up. In the next match, Sri Lanka played against Ireland. Sri Lanka batted first where they lost three wickets for less than ten runs. But then the team managed to score 150-plus, first time that has occurred in T20Is courtesy of 123 run partnership between Pathum Nissanka and Wanindu Hasaranga, the highest for the fourth wicket in T20 World Cups. In the end, Ireland bowled out for 101 runs and Sri Lanka won by 70 runs and moved to the Super 12s round. Sri Lanka then played against Netherlands in their final Group 1 fixture. Netherlands were bowled out again very cheaply for 44 runs, the second-lowest in the men's T20 World Cup. It was also the lowest T20 total by any team in the UAE. Sri Lanka won the match by 8 wickets with 77 balls remaining. With this win, Sri Lanka assured the spot in Group A along with Australia, South Africa, England, West Indies and Bangladesh.\nIn Group A, Sri Lanka first played against Bangladesh, where Bangladesh scored a daunting 171 in the first innings. In the chase, Charith Asalanka produced the innings of the game, hitting 80 not out off 49 balls, whereas Bhanuka Rajapaksa struck 53 off 31, guided Sri Lanka to a 5 wicket win. The second match was against Australia, where Sri Lanka lost by 7 wickets. Then against South Africa, Sri Lanka edged closer to win the match, but David Miller stole 15 runs in the final over to win the match for South Africa. However, in the match, Hasaranga got a hat trick, becoming first Sri Lankan to take a hat trick in a T20 World Cup. Against England, Sri Lanka faced a must win situation to qualify for semi finals. Even though Hasaranga impressed with both bat and ball in the match, England finally won the match by 26 runs courtesy of Jos Butler's century. On 4 November 2021, Sri Lanka played the final match of the tournament, against defending champions West Indies. Sri Lanka batted first and scored a total of 189 runs with the help of Asalanka, and Nissanka fifties. West Indies only scored 169 runs where Sri Lanka finished the tournament with 20-run win. Meanwhile, Hasaranga ended the tournament as the highest wicket taker with 16 scalps, surpassing the previous record of 15 wickets by fellow Sri Lankan Ajantha Mendis. Later, both Asalanka and Hasaranga was included in the ICC T20 World Cup team of 2021.\nThe 15th edition of Asia Cup was held in the UAE for the fourth time and in T20I format. Five test playing nations with Hong Kong were participated to the tournament. In the first match against Afghanistan, Sri Lanka scored only 105 runs where Afghans chased the target within 10 overs. In the next match which was a must win situation, Bangladesh batted first and made a total of 183 in 20 overs. In the chase, Kusal Mendis made counter attack with a 37-ball 60 and Dasun Shanaka struck a 33-ball 45. Sri Lanka still needed 25 runs from 12 balls where Chamika Karunaratne, Asitha Fernando and Maheesh Theekshana made valuable contributions and eventually won by 2 wickets with 3 balls to spare. With this win, Sri Lanka end their six-match losing streak in Asia Cups, and their first win since beating UAE in 2016. In Super 4s, Sri Lanka met Afghanistan again where Afghans made a solid total of 175/6. In reply, Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis made a solid platform at the top, before cameos from Danushka Gunathilaka, Bhanuka Rajapaksa and Wanindu Hasaranga sealed the win. \nThe next match was against the favorites, India. They batted first and made 173/8 due to Rohit Sharma's fifty. Meanwhile Virat Kohli was dismissed for naught of a brilliant inswing by pacer Dilshan Madushanka. Sri Lanka had a good opening stand where Kusal Mendis and Pathum Nissanka added 97 runs in 11.1 overs with both made fifties. In the end, Rajapaksa and Shanaka made winning combination and recorded third straight 170-plus chase. With this win, Sri Lanka qualified for the Asia Cup final. In the final Super 4 match, Sri Lanka made another victory over Pakistan by 5 wickets. Pakistan scored only 121 runs and the chase was mastered by 48-ball 55 from Pathum Nissanka. With this win, Sri Lanka became the only team to win all three games in this year's Asia cup. Sri Lanka met Pakistan again in the final, where Sri Lanka batted first and from 58 for 5, they later reached to 170 for 6. Rajapaksa made 71 in 45 balls and Hasaranga made cameo 21-ball 36 runs. In the chase, Madushan's two-in-two to remove Babar and Fakhar Zaman set the tone and eventually bowled out for 147. Sri Lanka won the match by 23 runs and became Asia cup champions for the 6th time. Later, Hasaranga won the player of the series award."

        "title": "Gap (American football)",
        "text": "Gaps in American football are the spaces in between the splits of the offensive linemen. A \"hole\" is a space in between the defensive linemen.\nGap naming and defensive line positioning.\nGap names.\nThe gaps on either side of the offensive center and between the guards are called \"A\" gaps. A gap between the offensive guard and tackle is called a \"B\" gap. The gaps outside the\noffensive tackle are called \"C\" gaps. If there is a tight end, the gap outside the tight end and opposite the tackle is a \"D\" gap.\nDefensive line positioning.\nLine positioning is described by numbers, from 0 to 9. Even numbers are face to face with offensive players, odd numbers are to the side (on the shoulder) of opposing players. If a defensive lineman is face to face with an offensive center, he is said to be in a 0 technique. If he is face to face with a guard, the defender is in a 2 technique. If the defender is face to face with a tackle, he is in a 4 technique. If the defender is aligned directly across from a tight end, it is described as a 6 technique.\nShade technique.\nNumbers are also used to describe when players are aligned not directly on a player, but aligned with the shoulders of a blocker. This kind of alignment is often called a shade. To be aligned on the shoulders of a center is called a 1 technique. To be aligned on the inside shoulder of a guard is a 2i technique. To be aligned on the outside shoulder of a guard is a 3 technique. To be aligned on the inside of a tackle is a 4i technique. And to be aligned on the outside shoulder of a tackle is a 5 technique. Assignments of 7 and 9 are not universal, but a 7 can mean a player on the inside shoulder of a tight end, and a 9 technique is usually a couple feet on the outside away from any blocker.\nOne-gap line play versus two-gap line play.\nIn a one-gap defensive line technique, a player is assigned a single gap to defend against the run. He does not have to line up in the gap, but he does have to be able to shed any blocker attempting to keep him from defending the gap. In a two-gap defensive technique, the defensive lineman generally has to control or defeat the offensive player in front of him to guard the run on both gaps that flank the offensive player.\nThe gap defensive technique is older than the use of the term. In Jones and Wilkinson, when describing the nose guard play in their 5-2 defense, the authors warn that the guard must never allow the center to cut you either way (i.e. two-gap technique). All other defensive linemen are only asked to prevent their opposing linemen from blocking them in one-gap play, but they do not use the phrase 'gap' in their text.\nShoot the gap.\nShooting the gap is a term used in American football. To \"shoot the gap\", a defensive lineman will exploit the space between the offensive linemen during a pass rush. The defensive lineman is usually one of the defensive tackles. The gaps are given different letters depending on their distance from the center. The gaps between the center and the guard are known as the \"A gaps\", and the gaps between the guard and the tackle are known as the \"B gaps\". Shooting the gap requires the defensive lineman to turn his shoulders and get past the offensive line into the backfield by any means possible, usually by diving through the gap. The play is often used during a blitz, as the defense will try to rush past the offensive line in order to get to the quarterback and cause a quarterback sack."

It was the thirteenth edition of the Under-19 Cricket World Cup, and the second to be held in South Africa after the 1998 event. Sixteen teams took part in the tournament, split into four groups of four. The top two teams from each group advanced to the Super League, with the bottom two teams in each group progressing to the Plate League. Bangladesh were the defending champions.\nIn the first Super League semi-final, India beat Pakistan by ten wickets to advance to the final, with Yashasvi Jaiswal scoring an unbeaten century. In the second Super League semi-final, Bangladesh beat New Zealand by six wickets, with Mahmudul Hasan Joy scoring a century. The third-place playoff match between Pakistan and New Zealand was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain. Therefore, Pakistan finished in third place, after scoring more points than New Zealand in the group stage of the tournament.\nIn the final, India batted first and were all out for 177 runs in 47.2 overs. Due to a rain interruption, Bangladesh were set a revised target of 170 runs from 46 overs, per the DLS method, which Bangladesh chased down in 42.1 overs. Bangladesh beat India by three wickets to win the tournament. It was Bangladesh's first championship win in an ICC event at any level.\nQualification.\nThe top eleven full members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) at the 2018 World Cup qualified automatically for the 2020 tournament; Ireland were the only full member to fail to qualify automatically. They were joined by the winners of the five regional qualification tournaments. Fifty teams took part in the qualification pathway matches during 2018 and 2019. The first qualification matches took place in the Europe Division 2 group at various club cricket grounds in Essex and Hertfordshire, England, on 31 July 2018. The final round of qualification fixtures took place in the Netherlands in July &amp; August 2019.\nNigeria became the first team to win their regional qualification group, and qualified for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup for the first time in their history. Japan also qualified for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup for the first time in their history. Japan were scheduled to play Papua New Guinea in their final qualification fixture, but Papua New Guinea forfeited the match. The Papua New Guinea Cricket Board later suspended ten of the players for a year, after bringing the game into disrepute following a shoplifting incident. Canada, Scotland and the United Arab Emirates were the remaining three teams to secure qualification.\nUmpires.\nOn 7 January 2020, the ICC appointed the officials for the tournament.

Some claim it is a links course, and links are traditionally where the strips of land lie before you reach the beach and the shoreline proper. Which was true here, but the parts of the course closest to the beach here are on the clifftops beside it. This means it's an elevated course, eighty feet above sea level in places.

On the leaderboard, only Chris Stroud was affected, two-under for his round with five holes remaining. Play resumed at 7:30 am on Saturday. \nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 12, 2017\"\nWith the second round completed on Saturday morning, the third round began at 9:50 am EDT in groups of three at ten-minute intervals, with the final group at 2:00 pm. \nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 13, 2017\"\nSummary.\nEntering the final round with a one-stroke lead, Kevin Kisner failed to record a birdie on the front-nine and bogeyed the par-5 7th after hitting his approach into the water. Hideki Matsuyama birdied both 6 and 7 to tie Kisner. Justin Thomas began the round two back and tied for the lead with a birdie putt at the 9th. Chris Stroud also birdied the ninth to tie, while Francesco Molinari's run of four birdies in five holes on his back-nine meant that five players were atop the leaderboard at seven-under.\nAt the par-5 tenth, Thomas' putt for birdie paused on the lip of the cup for several seconds before falling in. He then chipped in at 13 for another birdie. At the par-3 17th, he hit his approach to and converted the birdie opportunity to get to nine-under. Matsuyama birdied the tenth to take solo possession of the lead, but made five bogeys to finish and fell to five-under. Kisner made his first birdie of the day at 10, but followed with two more bogeys. He managed to birdie both 14 and 15 before three-putting for bogey at the 16th. After a par at 17, Kisner needed to hole his approach from the fairway on the last to force a playoff, but found the water and made double bogey.\nIn the penultimate pairing and leading by three on the final tee, Thomas drove into a fairway bunker and then played conservatively. His third shot from the rough was to the right side of the green; he sank his short putt for bogey for 68 (−3) and 276 (−8). Patrick Reed had three birdies on the back to get to within a shot of the lead, but bogeyed the 18th after finding a fairway bunker off the tee and tied for second, two strokes behind Thomas. Molinari's chances were diminished when he also drove into a bunker at 16 and failed to get up-and-down. Louis Oosthuizen holed out from 34 yards on the par-5 15th for an eagle and birdied 18 to tie Reed and Molinari for second. With the finish Oosthuizen became the seventh golfer to finish runner-up in all four major championships. Stroud played the back-nine in six-over to fall to a tie for ninth. \nFinal leaderboard.\n\"Note: Top 15 and ties qualify for the 2018 PGA Championship; top 4 and ties qualify for the 2018 Masters Tournament\"\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career putouts as a shortstop leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a putout (denoted by PO or fly out when appropriate) is given to a defensive player who records an out by tagging a runner with the ball when he is not touching a base, catching a batted or thrown ball and tagging a base to put out a batter or runner (a force out), catching a thrown ball and tagging a base to record an out on an appeal play, catching a third strike (a strikeout), catching a batted ball on the fly (a flyout), or being positioned closest to a runner called out for interference. Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is a baseball or softball fielding position in the infield, commonly stationed between second and third base, which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions. The position is mostly filled by defensive specialists, so shortstops are generally relatively poor batters who typically hit lower in the batting order. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6.\nPutouts are most commonly recorded by shortstops by stepping on second base after receiving a throw from the first baseman, second baseman, or pitcher to force out a runner on a ground out, often beginning a double play; a shortstop generally benefits in this respect from playing alongside an excellent second baseman with great range and quickness. Other ways in which shortstops often record a putout include catching a pop-up or line drive, fielding a ground ball close enough to second base that they can step on the bag for a force out before the runner advances from first base, tagging a runner after a throw from the catcher or pitcher on a stolen base attempt or a pickoff play, receiving a throw from an outfielder to tag out a runner trying to stretch a single into a double, receiving a throw to retire a runner who fails to tag up on a fly ball out, receiving a throw to force out a runner on a bunt (possibly a sacrifice hit attempt), and tagging a runner stranded between bases in a rundown play. Sometimes a shortstop will record a putout while covering third base if the third baseman is charging toward the plate on an expected bunt. Occasionally, a shortstop can record two putouts on a single play; with a runner taking a lead off second base and less than two out, the shortstop can catch a line drive near the base, then step on the bag before the runner can return, completing a double play; alternately, if a runner on first base breaks for second base when the ball is hit, the shortstop can catch a line drive and tag the runner before they can stop and return to first. On eight occasions in major league history, a shortstop has recorded three putouts on a single play for an unassisted triple play, always by catching a line drive, then stepping on second base and tagging the runner advancing from first base.\nAs strikeout totals have risen in baseball, the frequency of other defensive outs including ground outs has declined; as a result, putout totals for second basemen have likewise declined. The top five career leaders all began their careers prior to 1916, and only four of the top 16 were active after 1950, and only two of them after 1973. Through 2022, only six of the top 40 single-season totals have been recorded since 1922, and none of the top 85 since 1949; none of the top 181 have been recorded since 1964, and only three of the top 485 have been recorded since 1992. Rabbit Maranville is the all-time leader in career putouts as a shortstop with 5,139; he is the only shortstop to record more than 5,000 career putouts."

        "text": "The 1966 NCAA University Division basketball championship game was the final of the 1966 NCAA University Division basketball tournament and determined the national champion in the 1965–66 NCAA University Division men's basketball season. The game was held on March 19, 1966, at Cole Field House in College Park, Maryland. The Kentucky Wildcats, the number one ranked team in men's college basketball, faced the Texas Western Miners, who were ranked third in the nation. \nTexas Western's starting lineup of five African Americans was the first all-black lineup in an NCAA title game; their opponents, by contrast, fielded an all-white squad. The Miners won 72–65, claiming the school's first national championship in men's college basketball. Their victory challenged assumptions widely held about black players at the time, and major college programs intensified their recruiting efforts towards African-American players in the years following the game.\nBackground.\nKentucky.\nThe Wildcats, coached by Adolph Rupp, began the 1965–66 season with an 83–55 win over Hardin–Simmons University on December 1, 1965. In road games at Virginia and Illinois, Kentucky prevailed by 26 and 18 points respectively. Wins in three games at home gave the Wildcats a 6–0 win–loss record, and the team was selected at number ten in the AP Poll, having previously been unranked. After three more victories by margins of 10 points or more, the Wildcats began play in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) on January 8, 1966, at Florida. Kentucky won 78–64, before a contest in Georgia that required two overtime periods. The Wildcats, by this time up to second in the national rankings, managed a four-point victory. The team reached number one in the AP Poll in the February 8 rankings, and Kentucky's undefeated streak continued into early March. In the Wildcats' next-to-last regular season game, Tennessee handed them their first loss, by a score of 69–62. With a 103–74 win over Tulane, Kentucky completed the regular season with a record of 24–1 (15–1 in conference play), and had the top ranking in the AP Poll. Forward Pat Riley was the team's leading scorer; including postseason play, he averaged 21.9 points per game, and his 8.9 rebounds per game also led the club. Guard Louie Dampier had a 21.1 point-per-game average and played the most minutes of anyone on the Wildcats' roster. Larry Conley led Kentucky in assists.\nKentucky received an invitation to the NCAA Tournament and was placed in the Mideast region. The team did not play in the first round; its first appearance in the tournament came in the regional semifinals against Dayton. With an 86–79 victory, the Wildcats moved on to the regional final. Playing against Michigan, Kentucky reached the Final Four with a second straight seven-point win. The Wildcats' opponent in the Final Four was Duke, the champion of the East region. The Blue Devils held a one-point lead at halftime, but the Wildcats earned an 83–79 victory. Dampier led Kentucky with 23 points, while Riley added 19.\nTexas Western.\nCoached by Don Haskins, the Miners' first game was on December 4, 1965, against Eastern New Mexico. Texas Western won by an 89–38 score, and added eight victories over the next 25 days. On December 30, the Miners faced Iowa, the fourth-ranked team in the country at the time. An 86–68 win, along with a nine-point victory over Tulsa, saw the Miners enter the January 4 rankings at number nine. Texas Western won three more games in January by double-digit margins. After defeating New Mexico State on February 1, the Miners played at Colorado State, prevailing by two points. An 81–72 win over Arizona moved the Miners to 17–0 for the season, and five further victories left them undefeated entering March. Their winning streak reached 23 games, with a second win against New Mexico State. In their last regular season game, the Miners suffered their first loss, against Seattle, 74–72, leaving them at 23–1. The team ended the regular season third in the AP Poll, having reached a peak position of second. Bobby Joe Hill had a team-high 15.0 points per game, while Dave Lattin had an average of 14.0 points per game and 8.6 rebounds per game. Orsten Artis and Nevil Shed also averaged more than 10.0 points per game, and Harry Flournoy led the Miners with 10.7 rebounds per game. In contrast to Kentucky, who sportswriter Michael Wilbon later called \"as white as milk\", the Miners' entire starting lineup consisted of African-Americans.\nTexas Western was placed in the Midwest region in the NCAA Tournament. Unlike the Wildcats, the Miners played in the first round of the tournament, defeating Oklahoma City by 15 points. The Miners then faced Cincinnati in a contest that went into overtime; they emerged with a 78–76 win and a berth in the regional final against Kansas. Texas Western was stretched into double overtime, but they earned an 81–80 victory and a Final Four appearance. The Miners won by seven points against Utah to reach the national championship game, overcoming a 38-point effort by the Utes' Jerry Chambers. Artis led the Miners in scoring with 22 points; Hill had 18 points, and Willie Worsley added 12.\nGame summary.\nThe game took place on March 19 at Cole Field House, on the campus of the University of Maryland, College Park, in front of an announced crowd of 14,253 fans. It was preceded by a third-place contest between the losing teams in the Final Four, Duke and Utah; the Blue Devils won 79–77. The championship game, which started at 10 p.m., was not broadcast on a major American station, instead airing on tape delay in certain cities. Sports Network Incorporated handled the original broadcast, and the full-length telecast appeared on ESPN in 2016. The Miners fielded an all-black starting lineup for the championship game, becoming the first team ever to do so in an NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament final. Haskins motivated his team by telling them about a promise made by Rupp that his white Kentucky team would not be defeated by an all-African-American lineup. The rotation employed by Haskins in the final consisted exclusively of black players, with two African-American bench players used along with the five starters. Haskins said of his roster choices that he had \"played [his] best players, who happened to be black.\"\nRiley won the opening tip for Kentucky, but the referee ruled that he had illegally jumped too early and awarded possession to Texas Western. On the Wildcats' first possession, Lattin committed a foul on Riley while trying to block his shot. Twice in the early stages of the game, Lattin scored on slam dunks; this came after Haskins had told him to dunk as early as possible, in an attempt to \"send a message\" to Kentucky. Defensively, the Wildcats utilized a 1–3–1 zone; in response to their move, Haskins opted to start three guards in the Miners' lineup, as Worsley joined Hill and Artis. The teams were tied at 9–9 before a Miners free throw which put them in front. Hill had steals on two straight Wildcats possessions around midway through the first half, and scored following each turnover. The sequence gave the Miners a larger lead, and was described by writer Frank Deford as a turning point in the game. The second dunk by Lattin followed, which gave the Miners a 16–11 advantage. Writer Curry Kirkpatrick described the game as \"slow, tedious, [and] almost flat.\" Future college basketball coach Gary Williams, who was in attendance, later complimented the Miners' ball movement, recalling that \"There were possessions where Texas Western passed it 10 times before taking a shot\". At halftime, Texas Western led by three points, 34–31.\nKentucky rallied to within a point of Texas Western in the opening three minutes of the second half, but could not catch them even when they had three shots in a row to achieve a tie. Behind scores by Artis and Hill, the Miners recorded six consecutive points to extend their lead. Texas Western maintained their lead with effective free throw shooting; over a 37-minute period, the Miners attempted 27 free throws, making all but one. Texas Western ultimately took a nine-point advantage and was able to control the pace; Gordon S. White Jr. of \"The New York Times\" wrote that their margin was \"safe enough for the fancy ball-handlers to slow the game during the last three minutes. Dribbles by Cager took the final few seconds off of the clock, as the Miners won 72–65 to earn the NCAA University Division title. It was the school's first men's college basketball championship, and remains their only one as of the 2021–22 season. Texas Western was the first school from Texas to win a men's national championship, and remained the only one until Baylor in 2021.\nStatistical summary.\nHill was the game's leading scorer with 20 points, on 7-of-17 shooting. Lattin added 16 points for the Miners, while Artis had 15 points; both players were perfect on free throws, as Lattin made all of his six attempts and Artis converted five. Lattin recorded nine rebounds on the night, while Artis had eight and Willie Cager contributed six. For the Wildcats, Riley and Dampier each tallied 19 points. Conley, with 10 points, was the only other Kentucky player to record double-digit points on the night. Dampier matched Lattin's total of nine rebounds, and Conley and Tommy Kron had eight and seven respectively.\nTexas Western converted 22 of their 49 field goal attempts, for a 44.9% total. The team made more than 80% of their free throws, missing only six of 34 attempts. Kentucky's shooters were held to 38.6% shooting in the game, making 27 of 70 field goals. The Wildcats were successful on all but two of their free throws, but they had 21 fewer attempts than the Miners. Kentucky committed nearly twice as many fouls (23) as Texas Western, who had 12 fouls called against them. Two Kentucky players – Conley and Thad Jaracz – fouled out of the game, while two others ended the contest with four fouls. Texas Western had a 35–33 rebounding advantage for the game.\nAftermath.\nThe 1966 NCAA University Division Championship Game is primarily remembered for Texas Western's victory with its entirely African-American starting lineup, which challenged stereotypes of the era. At the time, it was commonly believed that teams with all-black lineups would not play with self-control; Perry Wallace, the first black basketball player to compete in the SEC, said, \"There was a certain style of play whites expected from blacks.\" Before the game, the Miners were portrayed in the media as a team with weak defending and an up-tempo offense, when their actual playing style was vastly different. Worsely said that \"We were more white-oriented than any of the other teams in the Final Four,\" in terms of playing with discipline. After leading Texas Western to the championship, Haskins received many racist letters, along with some claiming that he was exploiting black players. According to Haskins, death threats were made against the Miners before a game against SMU the following season.\nThe 1966–67 Wildcats finished with a 13–13 record, following a back injury suffered by Riley in the offseason that limited his effectiveness. A victory over Alabama in the last game of the season was required to prevent Rupp from having more losses than wins for the first time. Rupp coached Kentucky for five more seasons, through 1971–72. His teams made the NCAA Tournament in each of the five seasons, but were unable to reach the Final Four. Texas Western entered 1966–67 ranked second in the country, and remained in the top 10 throughout the season. The Miners were defeated by Pacific in their second NCAA tournament game and finished at 22–6. That year, the school was renamed to the University of Texas at El Paso, its current name. It took three seasons for UTEP to return to the NCAA Tournament; Haskins coached the Miners through the 1998–99 season.\nIn the first season after the 1966 title game, all conferences in the Southern U.S. featured at least one black men's basketball player. This marked a change from the 1965–66 season, when numerous Southern conferences, such as the SEC and Atlantic Coast Conference, had not yet integrated. Large college programs began to more actively recruit African Americans for their basketball rosters, removing unofficial quotas that had been in place. By 1985, the number of black players in Division I more than doubled. Kirkpatrick wrote that the game \"changed the sport forever. And maybe changed a nation as well.\"\nTexas Western was the only team from Texas to win the national championship in basketball until Baylor did so in 2021."

Shortly following the Pan Am Jets' dominating performance at the International Stoke Mandville Games, wheelchair netball was switched to wheelchair basketball for all future Games.\nHistory.\nIn 1960 the inaugural Rome Paralympic Games included wheelchair basketball as one of its initial events. During this inaugural 1960 Paralympic Games the wheelchair basketball competition was divided into two constructs: Class A for athletes with complete lesions, and Class B for those with incomplete lesions. With the 1960 Paralympic Games, the United States Men's National Wheelchair Basketball Team competed in both classifications, winning two gold medals. The same occurred in the following 1964 Tokyo Paralympic Games, as the United States Men's National Wheelchair Basketball Team claimed both gold medals.\nThe success of the United States Men's National Wheelchair Basketball Team has continued since those initial Paralympic Games, although the team had not won gold medals since 1988 and finally ended that drought in the most recent tournament in 2016.\nThe United States Men's Wheelchair Basketball Team also competes internationally in the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation's (IWBF) World Wheelchair Basketball Championships, the Parapan American Games, and the IWBF's U23 World Wheelchair Basketball Championships. The United States Men's National Wheelchair Basketball Team has enjoyed great success in each of these tournaments in addition to the Paralympic Games. They are the only team to have won the IWBF World Wheelchair Basketball Championships in three successive tournaments (accomplishing that feat twice; 1979-1986 &amp; 1994-2002) and medalling in nearly every tournament held of the Parapan American Games, as well as the IWBF’s U23 World Wheelchair Basketball Championships.\nParalympic Games.\nResults achieved at the Paralympic Games:"

        "text": "Global Cycling Network (GCN) is a cycling-related YouTube channel which was launched in the United Kingdom in 2013. It is part of the cycling-themed multi-channel network Play Sports Network, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery through its TNT Sports unit. The channel is presented by 2008 Vuelta a Extremadura winner Daniel Lloyd, Under-23 British National Mountain Biking champion Simon Richardson, Oliver Bridgewood, Alex Paton, Welsh former track cyclist Manon Lloyd, 2018 Irish national road racing champion Conor Dunne, and James Lowsley-Williams. It is headquartered in Bath, Somerset under its parent company. They are also correlated with Global Mountain Biking Network (GMBN), a channel who have featured riders in their short form content such as Elliot's MTB, and Global Triathlon Network (GTN).\nHistory.\nOn 1 January 2013, Global Cycling Network was launched by SHIFT Active Media founder Simon Wear, under Google's now-defunct YouTube Original Channel Initiative, as part of its multi-channel network media strategy. Wear's original objective was to create a \"network of quality cycling video content creators and give cycling global promotion through an official channel\". The YouTube channel also provides a media channel for the promotion of the parent company's client brands.\nIn 2015, the channel was awarded Best Vlogger/Best Use of Video during the Cycling Media Awards 2015 awards night, which aims to recognise the best of UK cycling media. In 2016 the parent company's multi-channel network division was spun off as Play Sports Network, and management of the channel was transferred to the new company. On 18 April 2017 the channel broke the 1 million subscriber mark.\nOn 27 February 2017, Discovery Communications, the owner of Eurosport, announced the acquisition of a 20% stake in Play Sports Group, the company that owns the GCN channel. In 2019, Discovery Communications acquired a controlling interest in Play Sports Group and the GCN franchise, increasing holdings to 71%.\nIn February 2018, GCN announced the addition of time trial and duathlon world champion Emma Pooley to the team. On 24 March 2019, Pooley announced that after presenting for a year she would be leaving the channel to concentrate on engineering.\nOn 3 July 2018, GCN announced another new presenter, cycling journalist and PhD graduate Oliver Bridgewood, who previously worked as a writer and video producer at \"Cycling Weekly\".\nOn 26 July 2019, GCN introduced Jeremy Powers, a former professional racing cyclist who has won over 90 UCI victories, four USA Cyclocross National Championships, the 2015 Pan-American UCI cyclocross championships, and the most cyclocross races by any American male.\nOn 24 December 2019, GCN announced the addition of former Welsh track cyclist 2016 UEC European Track Championships team pursuit bronze medallist Manon Lloyd as a presenter.\nOn 29 October 2020, GCN announced the addition of Alex Paton as a presenter on their GCN Tech channel.\nContent.\nGlobal Cycling Network's content tends to be predominantly road cycling-related, with regular sections consisting of instructional videos, including videos on bicycle riding, maintenance and tech news, how-to videos, and a weekly news bulletin, \"The GCN Show\". The channel also features interviews of professional cyclists and coverage of international professional cycling events, including the Tour of Beijing, Dubai Tour, and the three Grand Tour races (the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a España). Occasionally, the channel also creates videos on cyclo-cross and less frequently, mountain biking (mostly covered on Global Cycling Network's sister channel, Global Mountain Bike Network).\nThe channel also produces a \"Road Bike Party\" series of videos featuring former trials rider Martyn Ashton performing stunts on road bikes. It was a continuation of Ashton's independently-created first video, Road Bike Party 1. As of April 2017, Road Bike Party 2 had received more than 15 million views.\nIn 2014, British Cycling partnered with Global Cycling Network in the creation of its Racesmart campaign, which aimed to promote safe cycle racing in Great Britain."

        "text": "The 2022 ICC Under-19 Men's Cricket World Cup was an international limited-overs cricket tournament that was held in the West Indies in January and February 2022 with sixteen teams taking part. It was the fourteenth edition of the Under-19 Men's Cricket World Cup, and the first that was held in the West Indies. Bangladesh were the defending champions.\nIn March 2021, Cricket West Indies confirmed that the format would be the same as previous editions, with teams competing to progress to the Plate and Super League phases of the tournament. In November 2021, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed the full schedule for the tournament, with matches played in Antigua and Barbuda, Guyana, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Trinidad; the final was played at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua and Barbuda. New Zealand decided to withdraw from the tournament due to the extensive mandatory quarantine restrictions for minors on their return home and Scotland won a wildcard to replace the country, with Scotland named as their replacement.\nEngland became the first team to reach the final of the tournament, after they beat Afghanistan by 15 runs in the first Super League semi-final match. It was the first time that England had reached the final of the Under-19 Cricket World cup since winning the 1998 tournament in South Africa. In the second semi-final, India beat Australia by 96 runs, progressing to their fourth consecutive Under-19 Cricket World Cup final.\nAustralia beat Afghanistan in the final playoff match of the tournament to finish in third place. In the final, India beat England by four wickets to win their fifth Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Dewald Brevis of South Africa was named the Player of the Tournament, after scoring 506 runs.\nQualification.\nThe top eleven teams from the previous tournament qualified automatically. They were joined by the five winners of regional qualification tournaments. In August 2021, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that the Americas, Asia, and EAP regional qualifiers had all been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Papua New Guinea all qualified directly to the 2022 Under-19 Cricket World Cup based on their past performances in the last five regional qualifiers. In the African group, Uganda won the Division 1 tournament to become the final team to qualify. In the European group, Ireland beat Scotland in the regional final to qualify. However, in November 2021, the ICC confirmed that Scotland won a wildcard and replaced New Zealand in the tournament, after the country was forced to withdraw due to the extensive mandatory quarantine restrictions placed on the return of minors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUmpires.\nOn 9 January 2022, the ICC appointed the officials for the tournament. Along with the nineteen umpires, Denavon Hayles, Graeme Labrooy and Phil Whitticase were also named as the match referees.\nSquads.\nEach team selected a squad of fifteen players for the tournament, excluding reserves, with South Africa being the first team to name their squad. Afghanistan's departure was delayed due to visa issues, resulting in their warm-up matches being cancelled. After taking part in the 2021 ACC Under-19 Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates, the Afghanistan team flew from Dubai, via Manchester, to the Caribbean. As a result, some of the Group C fixtures were revised to accommodate Afghanistan's late arrival.\nGroup stage.\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFinal standings.\nThe final standings for the tournament were as follows:\nTeam of the tournament.\nOn 6 February 2022, the ICC announced the most valuable team of the tournament."

        "text": "The individual show jumping in equestrian at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London was held at the Wembley Stadium on 14 August. The competition consisted of a single round of jumping. In the case of a tie in points, a jump-off was arranged. The jump-off had no time limit, however, the time taken to complete the jump-off was used as a tie-breaker. The points from the individual competition were also used in the team competition. There were 44 competitors from 15 nations, with nations able to send up to three riders each. The event was won by Humberto Mariles of Mexico, with his teammate Rubén Uriza taking silver at the top of a three-way jump-off for second place. Mariles' win was Mexico's first victory in the event. Jean-François d'Orgeix of France earned that nation's first individual jumping medal since 1928 with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nNone of the top 10 riders from the pre-war 1936 competition returned. \nBrazil, Denmark, Finland, and Ireland each made their debut in the event. France and Sweden both competed for the seventh time, tied for the most of any nation; Sweden had missed only the inaugural 1900 competition, while France missed the individual jumping in 1932.\nCompetition format.\nThe team and individual jumping competitions used the same scores. A single round of jumping was held.\nThe jumping test featured 16 obstacles (19 total jumps) over 870 metres. Points were lost for faults (including elimination for the third refusal on the course) and for exceeding the time limit. Ties for medals were determined by jump-off; other ties were not broken. In the jump-off, there was no time limit but instead the time was used as a tie-breaker if pairs had the same number of faults.\nResults.\nMariles was the last rider. Three riders had already finished with 8 faults apiece. Only two teams (Spain and Great Britain) had finished; with Mariles' teammates both having completed the course, he needed only finish the course to earn a team bronze. A score under 39 would earn team silver for Mexico; under 28.50, team gold. Those marks would turn out to be well more than Mariles needed; he had the best run of anyone with only 4 jumping penalties (knocking down the 15th jump) and an over-time penalty of 2.25, for a total of 6.25 penalties and the gold medal."

        "title": "2004 Belmont Stakes",
        "text": "The 2004 Belmont Stakes was the 136th running of the Belmont Stakes. The race, known as the \"test of the champion\" and sometimes called the \"final jewel\" in thoroughbred horse racing's Triple Crown series, was held on June 5, 2004, three weeks after the Preakness Stakes and five weeks after the Kentucky Derby.\nFor the third year in a row, a horse won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, only to lose the Belmont Stakes, lengthening the Triple Crown drought to 26 years. In 2004 before a record crowd, Smarty Jones was thought to have an excellent chance of completing the series as he was unbeaten and dominant in his earlier races. However, he failed to relax during the early part of the race when pressured by horses who eventually finished well back. Smarty Jones hit the lead with over half a mile to go but did not have enough energy left to withstand a late charge by Birdstone, who won at odds of 36–1.\nPre-race.\nUndefeated in the lead-up to the Triple Crown series, Smarty Jones won the Kentucky Derby by lengths, and then won the Preakness Stakes by lengths. As a result, he became the heaviest favorite for the Belmont Stakes since Spectacular Bid and Secretariat in the 1970s. When he returned to his home base at Philadelphia Park after winning the Preakness, some 10,000 fans turned out just to see him gallop in the morning. When he traveled to Belmont Park a week before the race, he was accompanied through Pennsylvania by two motorcycle police officers, while other police cars blocked key intersections and three helicopters circled overhead. The cavalcade drove past a billboard on the Pennsylvania turnpike that read, \"Look out New York, Smarty's Coming!\" His owners received thousands of letters of encouragement and Smarty Jones merchandise was in high demand. \"Smarty Fever\" led to the largest attendance at Belmont Park in its history: 120,139.\nThere were concerns though. Smarty Jones was sired by a sprinter and his broodmare sire was also a sprinter, making his stamina a question mark. He had faced a grueling prep season without any time off since his first race in November 2003. His dominant performance in the Preakness may have taken too much out of him. His trainer, John Servis, tried to keep the horse fresh by giving the colt only one slow workout in the 5 weeks between the Derby and Belmont, while trying to keep the edge off by giving him just enough slower exercise.\nAnother concern was the constant attention from press and other visitors, which disrupted the stable routine. Barclay Tagg, who had been through a similar experience with Funny Cide, later recalled visiting Smarty Jones's barn one night at around midnight. \"There were six guards in front of his stall, cutting up and drinking beer, and the light was on in his stall\", he said. \"It's very hard to keep the commotion down.\"\nRock Hard Ten was the second favorite for the Belmont after finishing second in both the Derby and Preakness. His owners had been disappointed in his Preakness performance though, feeling the horse would have done better if he had been closer to the pace. His jockey at the time, Hall of Famer Gary Stevens, disagreed and declined to ride the horse in the Belmont. \"I wasn't about to... ride him in the Belmont if it meant following orders I couldn't live with\", he said. Alex Solis picked up the mount.\nPurge was the third choice in the field after winning the Peter Pan Stakes, while Eddington was the next choice after finishing third in the Preakness. The remaining horses were given little chance, including two entries by trainer Nick Zito. In particular, Birdstone was the \"most maligned colt on the Derby trail\" because of his small size and slight frame – he weighed only about 900 pounds at the time of the Belmont. Despite Birdstone's excellent breeding and respectable eighth-place finish in the Derby, he was a 36-1 long-shot for the Belmont.\nRace description.\nSmarty Jones got a good start and settled into third place behind Purge and Rock Hard Ten while running four-wide. The opening quarter-mile was a reasonable 24.33 seconds and the first half-mile went in 48.65 seconds. The pace then started to pick up significantly. Purge dropped back and Eddington moved forward to challenge for the lead while racing five wide. \"I knew there was trouble on the backstretch. [Smarty Jones] wasn't settled\", said Servis. \"That was my concern the whole three weeks, trying to take the edge off. I wasn't able to do it. That's horse racing.\"\nPressured by Rock Hard Ten to the inside and Eddington to the outside, Smarty Jones ran the third quarter-mile in 23 seconds while the fourth quarter went in :23. Rounding the final turn, the challengers started to drop back as Smarty Jones completed the first miles in a rapid 2:00.52 – a time fast enough to have won all but four Kentucky Derbies. His lead was opening and the crowd was in a frenzy.\nIn the final furlong though, Smarty Jones's stride started to falter. Track announcer Tom Durkin realized the pace might catch up with the horse and warned the crowd:\n“The whip is out on Smarty Jones... It’s been 26 years... Just one furlong away... They’re coming down to the finish... Can Smarty Jones hold on? ... Here comes Birdstone... Birdstone surges past... Birdstone wins the Belmont Stakes... Smarty Jones was valiant, but vanquished.\"&lt;br&gt; – Tom Durkin\nThe crowd was stunned. \"We came to see a coronation and instead we got a sporting event. Sometimes that happens\", said John Hendrickson, the husband of Birdstone's owner, Marylou Whitney. \"I’ve never been in a crowd of 120,000 people where it went from roaring to dead silence.\" In the winner's circle, Whitney apologized. \"I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry that Smarty Jones couldn’t win today,\" she said. \"We would have been happy to run second.\"\nThe result remains controversial due to the tactics used with Rock Hard Ten and Eddington. Many felt that Jerry Bailey in particular on Eddington did not ride to win, as the early move while racing wide sacrificed his horse's chances. \"I never saw two riders ride so hard to lose a race in my life\", said Roy Chapman, the owner of Smarty Jones, a week after the race. \"They just were out for one thing: making sure Smarty didn’t win.\" Some also criticized Smarty Jones's jockey, Stewart Elliott, for letting the horse move too early. Servis was more philosophical. \"When he was dragging Stewie out of the saddle on the backside, I had a bad feeling,\" he said. \"You can't do that and win going a mile and a half. That was one of the things that helped us in the Derby and the Preakness; he relaxed so well. He just didn't relax today.\"\nChart.\nSource: Equibase&lt;br&gt;\nTimes: — 0:24.33; — 0:48.65; — 1:11.76; mile — 1:35.44; — 2:00.52; final — 2:27.50.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:24.33) (:24.32) (:23.11) (:23.68) (:25.08) (:26.98)\nPayout.\nThe 136th Belmont Payout Schedule"

She grew up in California and started taking riding lessons at the age of five. She grew as a rider and was supported by her family, who had some equestrian background, as her grandfather, Robert Barron Frieze, was a jockey's agent, and her mother rode casually. Davis accompanied her mother to the barn a few times a week and quickly became interested in horses. Her early riding career was with trainer Chacha Levinson at the Sullivan Canyon Preservation Association. She later moved to train with Archie Cox at Middle Ranch to compete in the hunters and equitation on the A and AA levels. During her time with Cox, Davis won many national championships in the equitation and hunters which include World Champion Hunter Rider in 2007. Davis showed in the pony and junior hunters competitive divisions before convincing her mother to let her compete in the jumper ring when she was fourteen. From then on, she advanced from the Low Junior Jumpers (1.20m) on her first junior jumper, Mister Mind. Growing up, Davis also played soccer, but she later dropped the sport at age sixteen to pursue equestrian competition full-time.\nDavis went to her first international competition when she attended the North American Junior and Young Rider Championships (NAJYRC). In 2009, she was the Individual Silver medalist with True Love, and in 2010 was on the Zone 10 Gold Medal winning team.\nDavis graduated from Stanford University (California). She is now based in Europe and travels the Western European circuit while still making frequent appearances in the United States show circuit.\nDavis is now in the upper levels of show jumping and was selected to be a member on the 2016 US Olympic Show Jumping Team that competed in Rio de Janeiro. She was selected to compete with her top mount, Barron, whom she has competed with in Nations Cups, World Cup Finals, and the 2014 World Equestrian Games.\nDavis placed tenth at the 2012 U.S. Olympic trials but did not make the Olympic team that year.

        "title": "Bosham Sailing Club",
        "text": "Bosham Sailing Club is the oldest sailing club in Chichester Harbour and was founded in 1907 It is located in the historic village of Bosham in West Sussex. Its clubhouse is the Old Mill on Bosham Quay.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded by Captain E.K. Collis-Chapman in a converted stable on the Bosham waterfront. Its first members consisted of mostly local fishermen and recreational sailors.\nAt the end of World War One the club was briefly named \"Bosham and Itchenor Sailing Club\". It reverted to its pre-war name in 1922 and Itchenor Sailing Club was formed in 1927.\nIn 1927 the club moved to the upper half of the Raptackle building on the Quay, from where it still continues to start many of its races. In 1947, the club purchased a Motor Gun Boat (MGB) (No. 614) to provide a clubhouse and sleeping accommodation. The club continued to use the MGB as its clubhouse until it moved into a newly rebuilt Mill House in 1954. In December 2019, the club purchased the freehold of the clubhouse.\nThe club's burgee is a red bell on a white background. This alludes to the legend of the \"Bosham Bell\" which tells of a Viking raiding party's attempt to sail off with the monastery's tenor bell, however the bell toppled over taking the Vikings and their ship to the bottom of the Bosham Channel. Local folklore has it that the bell can sometimes be heard tolling from beneath the waters.\nThe club has a long association with the Société des Régates du Havre yacht club (Est 1838).\nIn October 2016 the club had 1,442 members. The clubhouse has a bar, restaurant and changing facilities, and its terrace overlooks the Bosham Channel.\nSailing.\nClub Racing.\nThere is an active dinghy sailing programme which has events on every weekend from early March to the end of October and a Winter series leading up to Christmas. The club offer handicap racing on most Sundays which allows its members to race any class of dinghy. The main classes of dinghy sailed at the club are the Laser, Finn, Wayfarer. International 420, RS Feva, Topper, and Optimist. Open events are held for many of these classes throughout the year.\nDepending on the state of the tide, racing starts from a starting platform at the end of Bosham Quay, a starting line at Cobnor near the entrance to the Bosham Channel, or from the club's Committee Boat (\"Glad Emma\") anchored in Chichester Harbour.\nRYA Training.\nBosham Sailing Club is recognised by the RYA as an accredited training centre and runs a range of dinghy, powerboat and sailing theory courses for members and non-members. It is also a test centre for the ICC.\nClassic Day Boats.\nThe club has an active racing and social program for its fleet of over 100 Classic Day Boats. These are yachts of a design that would have seemed familiar to spectators of Chichester Harbour races during the years up to the 1950s having no sheltered accommodation and having pivoting centreplates. They are more heavily built than a dinghy and are capable of being left on an open mooring. The club hosts its annual Classic Boat Revival for classic racing dinghies and dayboats each September which has been described by Yachts &amp; Yachting magazine as the \"premier classic small boat event in the UK\"\nBosham Junior Week.\nBosham Junior Week is an annual week-long sailing event in August each year for young sailors from 8–18 years of age (Cadets) held on the Cobnor Estate, near Chidham, West Sussex. Cadet racing has been taking place at the club since the 1920s and Junior Week emerged in its current form in the 1980s.\nA trophy is awarded each year for racing on the windiest day of the week in memory of the Olympic sailor and club member, Glyn Charles, who died in the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.\nIn 2017 the event attracted 149 participants in 107 boats.\nAnnual Regatta.\nRegattas in Chichester Harbour began in the 19th Century as sailing competitions between each of the harbour village's fishing fleets and were organised by the local customs officers. The first recorded Bosham Regatta took place in 1903 and the Club's Commodore (then Col. A.T.Simpson) took on the organisation of the event from 1908 onwards. An annual regatta has taken place since then with the occasional break for World Wars and unsuitable weather. The oldest surviving trophy still being awarded at the regatta is the Eadie Cup which was first presented in 1923."

It was the second season featuring an expanded 18-team format, following the competition's expansion from 15 teams prior to the 2016 season.\nAfter 17 rounds of matches between 23 February and 15 July – with Rounds 15 and 16 split due to the 2017 mid-year rugby union internationals and British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand – four conference winners and four wildcard teams progressed to the finals series, which will consist of quarterfinals, semifinals and a final on 5 August.\nCompetition format.\nThe 18 participating teams were divided into two geographical groups, each consisting of two conferences: the Australasian Group, with five teams in the Australian Conference and five teams in the New Zealand Conference, and the South African Group, with six South African teams, one Argentine team and one Japanese team split into two four-team conferences – an Africa 1 Conference and an Africa 2 Conference.\nIn the group stages, there were 17 rounds of matches, where each team played 15 matches and had two rounds of byes for a total of 135 matches. Due to the British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand in June and July, Rounds 15 and 16 were split; Round 15 of the Australian and New Zealand Conferences were played on the weekend of 3 June, with Round 16 of the New Zealand Conference scheduled for the following week. The South African Conference Round 15 matches were played on the weekend of 1 July, with the Round 16 matches for the Australian and South African conferences scheduled for a week later.\nTeams played six intra-conference matches; in the four-team African Conferences, each team played the other three teams in their conference at home and away, while in the five-team Australasian Conferences, each team played two teams home and away and once against the other two teams (one at home and one away). The other nine matches were a single round of matches against each team in the other conference in their group, as well as against each team from one of the conferences in the other group. For 2017, the teams in Africa 1 played the teams in the New Zealand Conference, while the teams in Africa 2 played the teams in the Australian Conference.\nThe top team in each of the four conferences qualified for the quarterfinals. The next three highest-ranked teams in the Australasian Group and the next highest-ranked team in the South African group also qualified to the quarterfinals as wildcards. The conference winners were seeded #1 to #4 for the quarterfinals, in order of log points gained during the group stages, while the wildcards were seeded as #5 to #8 in order of log points gained during the group stages.\nIn the quarterfinals, the conference winners hosted the first round of the finals, with the highest-seeded conference winner hosting the fourth-seeded wildcard entry, the second-seeded conference winner hosting the third-seeded wildcard entry, the third-seeded conference winner hosting the second-seeded wildcard entry and the fourth-seeded conference winner hosting the top-seed wildcard entry.\nThe quarterfinal winners progressed to the semifinals. Instead of the following the Shaughnessy playoff format used from 1996 to 2016, the semi-finals were drawn according to a predetermined bracket. Under the new format, the winner of Quarter-final 1 (which featured the highest-seeded conference winner and the lowest-seeded wildcard) will play the winner of Quarter-final 4 (which featured the fourth-seeded conference winner and the highest-seeded wildcard) and likewise with the winners of Quarter-finals 2 and 3. The two semi-final hosts were the highest-seeded winners of their respective quarter-finals.\nThe winners of the semifinals advanced to the final, at the venue of the highest-seeded team.\nChanges for 2018.\nOn 9 April 2017, SANZAAR announced that the competition would return to a 15-team format for 2018, with two teams from South Africa and one team from Australia being dropped.

O'Sullivan played for the Canberra Raiders (winning the 1989 and 1990 Grand Finals). O'Sullivan's position of choice was .\nPlaying career.\nCronulla-Sutherland Sharks.\nO'Sullivan trialed with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks for the 1981 season, but he was suspended whilst playing in a trial match during the 1981 pre-season and missed being graded by the Cronulla club.\nCanberra Raiders.\nO'Sullivan made his first grade début for the Canberra Raiders in the club's inaugural season of 1982. Although he started the season in reserve grade, he finished the year as the Raiders' leading try-scorer with 12 tries.\nIn 1987, he played in the club's maiden Grand Final appearance against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, he showed his quick thinking when he feigned injury close to the try line before miraculously springing to his feet to back up and score the Raiders' only try in the match. The Raiders were defeated 18-8 in front of 50,201 in what was the last Grand Final played at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nOldham RLFC.\nO'Sullivan played for English side Oldham in the 1988–89 English season scoring three tries, and kicking four field goals.\nCanberra Raiders 2.\nBack in Australia in 1989, O'Sullivan was part of the Raiders' 19-14 Grand Final victory over the Balmain Tigers in which he helped his side's fightback by setting up a dramatic last-minute try by kicking a well placed cross-field bomb on the final tackle in which the Balmain side would fumble, Canberra's Laurie Daley would pick up the loose ball and pass it to the unmarked Canberra John Ferguson who would dart and weave his way infield to score under the posts, sending the Grand Final into extra-time for the first time in history. O'Sullivan also kicked the vital field goal which gave the Raiders a 15-14 lead in extra-time. He traveled with the Raiders to England in the post-season for the 1989 World Club Challenge playing five-eighth in Canberra's 30-18 loss to Widnes at the Old Trafford stadium in Manchester.\nMore success followed O'Sullivan in 1990. He was a member of the Raiders' team in their successful 18-14 win over the Penrith Panthers in the 1990 Grand Final.\nWarrington.\nAfter the 1990 NSWRL season ended, O'Sullivan once again traveled to England, this time playing for Warrington in the 1990-91 English season scoring three tries.\nSwinton.\nO'Sullivan did not take part in the Raiders' 1991 NSWRL season campaign instead choosing to stay in England to play for Swinton in the upcoming 1991-92 English season.\nCanberra Raiders 3.\nIn 1992, O'Sullivan returned to the Raiders in what was a troubled season in which they only won 10 games. After making only six appearances in the 1992 NSWRL season, O'Sullivan decided to retire at season's end. With 202 appearances, he held the record for most appearances with the Raiders until Steve Walters surpassed him in the 1995 season. O'Sullivan is currently ranked 11th on the Raiders' list for most appearances behind Jason Croker (318), Jarrod Croker (307), Josh Papalii (282), Laurie Daley (244), Jack Wighton (242), Simon Woolford (234), Steve Walters (228), Ruben Wiki, (224), Alan Tongue (220), and Ricky Stuart (203).\nPost playing.\nIn 2006, O'Sullivan was picked in the Raiders' 25-man \"Dream Team\" picked in the Canberra Times to commemorate the club's 25th season in 2006."

In 2017, the game celebrated its 10th anniversary of title sponsorship by Under Armour; it was decided in extra innings and featured a walk-off hit, both firsts in the game's history, and was won by the American team, 2–1 in 11 innings.\nGame results.\nNote: games broadcast on MLB Network are usually streamed on MLB.com\nNotable alumni.\n2005.\nSource: \n2006.\nSource: \n2007.\nSource: \n2008.\nSource: \n2009.\nSource:\n2010.\nSource: \n2011.\nSource: \n2012.\nSource: \n2013.\nSource: \n2014.\nSource: \n2015.\nSource: \n2016.\nSource: \n2017.\nSource: \n2018.\nSource: \n2019.\nSource: "

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career putouts as a catcher leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a putout (denoted by \"PO\") is given to a defensive player who records an out by tagging a runner with the ball when he is not touching a base (a tagout), catching a batted or thrown ball and tagging a base to put out a batter or runner (a force out), catching a thrown ball and tagging a base to record an out on an appeal play, catching a third strike (a strikeout), catching a batted ball on the fly (a flyout), or being positioned closest to a batter or runner called out for interference. The catcher is a defensive position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to these primary duties, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the catcher is assigned the number 2.\nThe great majority of putouts recorded by catchers result from strikeouts, with almost all of the rest resulting from catching pop-ups and retiring runners tagged out or forced out at home plate, including attempts to steal home. On rare occasions, a catcher can record two putouts on a single play, usually by tagging out a runner trying to steal home immediately after the batter has struck out; on August 2, 1985, Carlton Fisk of the Chicago White Sox tagged out two New York Yankees moments apart at home plate when both tried to score on a double. The feat was duplicated by Paul Lo Duca of the New York Mets in Game 1 of the 2006 National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Putout totals are often not regarded as a strong indicator of a catcher's defensive skill because of the high number resulting from strikeouts. As trends in baseball have changed, with an increasing number of strikeouts per game, the proportion of catchers' putouts from strikeouts has risen steadily. In 1901, about 73% of catchers' putouts in the major leagues resulted from strikeouts (the figure is imprecise due to the occasional uncaught third strike either resulting in no putout or a putout being awarded to a different player); that figure rose to 78% in 1930, 84% in 1950 and 92% in 1980. In the 2021 season, 99% of catchers' putouts resulted from strikeouts; remarkably, the Atlanta Braves pitching staff recorded 1,417 strikeouts, but the team's catchers only recorded 1,394 putouts. Accordingly, putout totals for catchers have also risen steadily; through 2021, the top six major league catchers in career putouts, and 11 of the top 16, all made their major league debuts after 1990, with all 16 debuting in 1969 or later. Through 2021, 12 of the top 13 single-season totals were recorded in 2016 or later, and 90 of the top 100 were recorded since 1993.\nYadier Molina holds the record for the most putouts by a catcher with 15,122. Molina surpassed the previous holder, Hall of Famer Iván Rodríguez, on June 14, 2022, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Rodríguez (14,864) remains the only other catcher to record 14,000 career putouts."

        "text": "Julian Wilson (born October 25, 1991) is an American football coach and former cornerback who is currently the defensive backs coach at Abilene Christian University. He was previously a graduate assistant at Texas Tech University. He played college football at Oklahoma.\nEarly years.\nWilson was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to Faye Wilson and Darrell McCowan, who was a two-year letterman in football at Oklahoma State in 1991–92. Wilson attended Southmoore High School in Moore, Oklahoma, where he was a two-sport athlete in football and track. He didn’t start playing football until his freshman year in high school. In 2008, he collected 43 tackles and broke up six passes on defense while recording 21 catches for 265 yards and three scores on offense, earning All-Region honors by \"PrepStar\". As a senior in 2009, he defended seven of the top-10 receivers in Oklahoma 6A (playing teams like Del City, Mustang, Bartlesville and Lawton), and due to his cover abilities, many teams refused to throw his way. For his season efforts, Wilson was tabbed on the All-District team and was named All-State by \"The Oklahoman\". He was also named to the All-Vype Football Team and was awarded the title of \"Lockdown Defender\" (award given to the best defender) at the 2009 Vype Showdown seven-on-seven passing league.\nWilson was also an heralded track sprinter. As a seventh and eighth grader, he didn’t lose a race in and he made it to the state finals as a freshman while at Westmoore. At a meet in Moore on April 9, 2009, Wilson ran a 10.4 to win the 100-meter dash and a 21.4 to win the 200-meter dash despite being hampered by a tight hamstring. Later in the season, Wilson ran a personal-best 10.2 in the 100-meter dash. At the John Jacobs Track Meet, he was part of a Southmoore 4x100-meter relay team that came up just short of a new state record as the Sabercats ran a 41.1. Following his senior season, Wilson was invited to perform at the 2009 Army All-American Combine held in San Antonio, Texas on January 5. Listed at 6'2\", 172 lbs, he ended up running the third-fastest 40-yard dash among all participants with a 4.53 second sprint and completed the 20-yard shuttle in 4.28 seconds.\nConsidered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Wilson was rated among Oklahoma's top high school seniors as the state's 19th best player and was given a recruit ranking of 5.6. He was also viewed as a three-star recruit by Scout.com and a four-star recruit by ESPN.com. Wilson committed to Oklahoma on December 18, 2009.\nCollege career.\nWilson attended the University of Oklahoma from 2011 to 2014, where he was a three-year letterwinner and a two-year starter at cornerback. He was redshirted as a true freshman in 2010. Wilson appeared in 48 career games with 22 starts during his career with the Sooners, collecting 99 tackles (76 of them solo and 6.5 for loss), four interceptions (one of which went for 100 yards as he returned it for a touchdown), and 15 pass deflections.\nFreshman season (2011).\nAs a redshirt freshman in 2011, Wilson earned his first letter appearing in eleven games as a reserve safety and special teams player.

        "title": "Professional Esports Association",
        "text": "Professional Esports Association (PEA) is an American association of nine North American esports organizations. It was founded in 2016 as a member-owned esports league by seven American esports teams. Jason Katz was the league's commissioner from its founding until his departure in February 2017.\nThe association was created with the aim of having a \"stable, healthy, long-term environment for the players\". It planned to institute an equal profit sharing system between players and owners, instead of relying on the traditional prize pool system. The PEA's first planned competition was a \"\" (\"CS:GO\") league, which was scheduled to begin in January 2017 with a minimum $1 million prize pool.\nIn December 2016, a decision by the PEA to disallow players from competing in the ESL Pro League was met with opposition from players, leading them to issue an open letter protesting the decision. In response to the letter, the PEA held a vote on the issue, which ended with players voting to play in the ESL Pro League. As a result, the association suspended its plans for a \"CS:GO\" league, four months after its inception. In May 2017, the PEA announced that it would be shifting its focus from hosting esports leagues to \"[contributing] towards a productive and profitable North American esports ecosystem\".\nHistory.\nThe Professional Esports Association was founded in September 2016, with Team SoloMid (TSM), Cloud9, Team Liquid, Counter Logic Gaming, Immortals, NRG Esports, and compLexity Gaming as founding members. The announcement followed the founding of the World Esports Association (WESA), which included many European esports teams, by ESL. In its founding announcement, the PEA described itself as an \"Owner-Operated league aiming to be the NBA of eSport\" by instituting an equal 50-percent profit share between owners and players, while also providing insurance and retirement benefits for players. It also promised players \"a strong voice in every major league decision\", through player representation in a Rules and a Grievances Committee. The league's founding commissioner was Jason Katz, who was previously the COO of Azubu, an esports streaming website. Katz also served as the vice president of global marketing for the Championship Gaming Series, a televised esports league that folded in 2008.\nThe PEA's first planned competition was a \"\" (\"CS:GO\") league, originally scheduled to begin in January 2017 with a minimum $1 million prize pool in its first year. The inaugural season was to be held over ten weeks, with two matches per week and a $500,000 prize pool.\nPlayer open letter.\nIn December 2016, shortly after the league's inception, 25 of its 35 member players signed an open letter expressing frustration towards the league ownership's lack of communication and its decision to disallow PEA players from competing in the ESL Pro League. According to the letter written by player representative Scott \"SirScoots\" Smith, the players were told that the owners had the contractual right to determine where they play, which \"came as a shock\", given previous indications by the league and its owners granting that decision to the players. The letter also alleged that players were being disenfranchised by the ownership, as players were only allotted three of seven votes on the PEA Rules Committee, while the rest belonged to the team owners and the league itself. According to Smith, the players were told by league commissioner Jason Katz that the uneven structure was designed to avoid stalemates, and that the two votes belonging to the PEA should be considered \"unbiased\".\nFiring of sgares.\nAfter the letter's release, TSM player Sean \"sgares\" Gares published a conversation between him and TSM owner Andy Dinh in which Dinh expressed his intention to replace Gares over his lack of communication with Dinh before the letter was published. In a subsequent statement, Dinh accused Gares of \"mis[leading] and manipulat[ing]\" other TSM players into signing a letter they \"had not read and did not understand\". Gares denied the accusations of manipulation, saying he spoke with Dinh about the players' concerns before the letter's publication. The other four players on TSM also denied being manipulated by Gares, saying in a statement that \"some of us may have had more information than others or been more involved in this endeavor, but we all understood what we were doing when we gave the okay to put our names on the letter\". TSM's \"CS:GO\" roster ultimately disbanded in January 2017, with the organization citing its deteriorating relationship with its remaining players and the latter's desire to continue playing with Gares. A day after the split, Gares and the rest of the former TSM \"CS:GO\" roster were signed by Misfits Gaming.\nPEA response.\nThe PEA responded with its own letter, stating that while it was not an exclusive league, it disputed the financial viability of players participating in both leagues due to the PEA's revenue-sharing model and \"issues with over-saturation\". According to the association, it had attempted a deal with WESA to resolve the oversaturation issue, but was declined. WESA in turn said it had \"politely declined\" an offer from the PEA that amounted to \"terminating the [North American] division of the ESL Pro League\".\nThe letter also reaffirmed the league's \"contractual right to decide where their players compete\" but offered to arrange a meeting for players to decide whether to compete in the ESL Pro League or the PEA league in the upcoming season.\nLeague suspension and subsequent activities.\nIn January 2017, PEA member players voted to compete in the ESL Pro League rather than the upcoming inaugural PEA season. This prompted the PEA to suspend its \"CS:GO\" league, with the organization also citing \"[in]sufficient financial support in the ecosystem... to profitably operate a third prominent online league, due to the oversaturation of the marketplace and the recent upward spiral in operating costs\". On February 17, 2017, the PEA announced Katz's departure from his position as part of a \"reorganisation of its management structure\", in which its Board of Governors would take over management duties in the interim.\nAfter suspending its \"CS:GO\" league, the PEA added Team Dignitas and Misfits Gaming to its membership in May 2017. It also announced its intention to change its focus from operating esports leagues to \"[contributing] towards a productive and profitable North American esports ecosystem\". The PEA was reportedly still active in early 2018; in an interview, PEA spokesperson and NRG Esports co-owner Andy Miller stated that the group was still active behind-the-scenes and \"focusing on bringing our marketing and fanbase, which is mainly North American, to brands and publishers\". Miller also said that while the PEA no longer had any plans to launch their own esports league, they were in discussions with \"a number of publishers about helping them launch their esports leagues\".\nMembership.\nAs of July 2019, the association had nine member organizations."

It ran alongside the 2015–16 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR). \nTeams.\nChanges in the lineup from 2014–15 were:\nCompetition format.\nThe top team at the end of the regular season (after all the teams played one another twice, once at home, once away), is declared champion and earns a spot in the next Top 14 season. Teams ranked second to fifth compete in promotion playoffs, with the semifinals being played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final is then played on neutral ground, and the winner earns the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nRelegation.\nNormally, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to Fédérale 1 at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher-placed team to be demoted instead, or prevent one of the two finalists in Fédérale 1 from promotion.\nThis season saw an example of the latter situation. Following the 2015–16 season, 15th-place Dax was spared relegation after Pro D2 side Tarbes was relegated due to excessive debt and failed in an appeal of the decision.\nPlay–offs.\nThe highest ranked team at the end of the regular season, Lyon OU, earned automatic promotion to the Top 14 as \"champion de France de PRO D2 2016\".\nSemi–finals.\nThe semi–finals followed a 2 v 5, 3 v 4 system, with the higher ranked team playing at home.\nFinal.\nThe winners of the semi–finals played off for the second promotion spot to the Top 14."

McGregor graduated from Grant High School in Portland, Oregon. He served in the Marines during World War 2. He was also pioneer in promoting American basketball to European teams by taking players that had not been drafted by the NBA and playing exhibition games against European teams. Many players from these teams were signed to contracts to play in Europe - far before this became a commonplace. McGregor received fees when these players signed contracts - and thus an early agent in international basketball. McGregor was inducted into the Grant High School Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011.

        "title": "2017 Major League Baseball season",
        "text": "The 2017 Major League Baseball season began on April 2 with three games, including the 2016 World Series champions Chicago Cubs facing off against the St. Louis Cardinals, the regular season ended in late September. The postseason began on October 3. The World Series began October 24 and Game 7 was played on November 1, in which the Houston Astros defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games, to capture their first World Series championship in franchise history.\nThe 88th Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held on July 11 at Marlins Park, the home of the Miami Marlins. For the first time since 2002 when the game ended in a tie, the All Star Game did not determine home field advantage for the World Series. Instead, home field advantage was awarded to the team with the better regular season record. The American League won 2–1 in 10 innings.\nAfter the 2019 season, Mike Fiers alleged that the 2017 Astros used technology to illicitly steal their opponents' signs and relay it to their hitters. The Astros used this method throughout the 2017 season, and part of the 2018 season. MLB and the Astros opened an investigation into this sign stealing allegation. MLB found the Astros used technology to cheat during their 2017 season and suspended Astros' manager A. J. Hinch and Astros' general manager Jeff Luhnow for one year; the Astros fired Luhnow and Hinch the same day. Alex Cora, who was the Astros bench coach in 2017 and the Red Sox manager from 2018 to 2019, parted ways with the Red Sox after the scandal broke.\nSchedule.\nAs has been the case since 2013, all teams played their four division opponents 19 times each for a total of 76 games. They played six or seven games against each of the other ten same-league opponents for a total of 66 games, and 20 inter-league games. The primary inter-league match-ups were AL East vs. NL Central, AL Central vs. NL West, and AL West vs. NL East. Teams also played four games against a designated interleague rival.\nOn March 9, it was announced that the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals would play a game at the minor league BB&amp;T Ballpark in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, on August 20. The game coincided with the Little League World Series, held annually in nearby South Williamsport, and was exclusively attended by Little League players and their families.\nEffect of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\nAs a consequence of Hurricane Harvey damaging the Houston area, the three-game Lone Star Series between the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros from August 29 to 31 was moved from Minute Maid Park to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. Although the Astros were the designated home team, they wore their away uniforms during the series while the Rangers wore their home uniforms. The Astros returned to Minute Maid Park for a three-game series with the New York Mets, beginning with a split doubleheader on September 2.\nThe Tampa Bay Rays' three-game set with the New York Yankees from September 11 to 13 was moved from Tropicana Field to Queens' Citi Field due to Hurricane Irma's impending landfall on the Tampa Bay Area.\nIrma's damage to South Florida also forced the Miami Marlins' three-game set with the Milwaukee Brewers from September 15 to 17 to move from Marlins Park to the Brewers' home field at Miller Park, with the Marlins as the designated home team. Similar to the Rangers–Astros series in Tampa Bay, the Marlins wore their away uniforms as the 'home' team, while the Brewers wore their home uniforms as the 'away' team.\nRule changes.\nIn March 2017, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association agreed to seven rule changes.\nFurthermore, the collective bargaining agreement that goes in effect this season prohibits any player who makes plays his first game starting in the 2017 season from using tobacco at any time in a stadium, in official interviews, or appearances. Players who had service are not permitted to use tobacco in interviews or appearances, and cannot display any tobacco packages.\nTechnology changes.\nFor the 2017 season, the TrackMan component of Major League Baseball's Statcast platform has replaced the previous PITCHf/x system for official measurements of pitch speed. The new system uses a doppler radar to calculate pitch speed based on maximum velocity (typically from the release of the pitch), rather than the speed measured from home plate. The change in data source has led to discrepancies in pitch speed reports between those reported in 2016 and 2017, with some pitches registering slightly higher speeds than with the previous system.\nUniforms.\nWholesale changes.\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks tweaked their uniform set that was unveiled last season. The pant stripes now reach to the hip, while the gradient below was removed. The road uniform lettering is also changed to improve visibility.\nThe San Diego Padres unveiled new home and road uniforms, with noticeable changes such as the team name and the removal of yellow on the home uniforms, the bowtie-shaped lettering in the city name on the road uniforms, and the interlocking \"SD\" on both uniforms.\nAlternate changes.\nThe Kansas City Royals unveiled an updated version of their gold-trimmed white uniform, featuring gold numbers and blue lettering. It was paired with a blue cap featuring the gold 'KC' lettering, and was worn on Friday home games.\nThe Washington Nationals unveiled a white alternate uniform featuring the 'curly W' logo in a Stars and Stripes design. It was paired with two caps featuring the 'curly W' Stars and Stripes design: a navy cap with red brim, and a red cap with navy brim. The uniforms were worn during patriotic-themed and weekend day games.\nCoinciding with Canada's 150th anniversary, the Toronto Blue Jays unveiled a red alternate uniform featuring a monochrome red rendition of the team's logo, complete with red belts, socks and cleats, and a red cap featuring the maple leaf logo. It was worn on Sunday home games and select other games in the month of July. They also promoted their white-paneled home caps to alternate status after wearing them once the past two seasons.\nThe Cleveland Indians retired their cream alternate uniforms. The red caps that were formerly paired with the cream uniforms will now be worn with the navy alternates at select home games.\nThe Cincinnati Reds changed their caps on Military Appreciation nights from camo to olive, with a white horseshoe \"C\".\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates changed their caps on Thursday home games to mustard, while still wearing their camo jerseys.\nThe New York Mets changed the brim of their home alternate caps from orange to blue, while the Mr. Met patch on both alternate uniforms were replaced with the primary Mets logo.\nSpring training changes.\nAll spring training uniforms in 2017 featured a pattern on the names and numbers. The pattern was the same for all 30 teams. In addition, seven teams unveiled new caps to be worn for spring training. The New York Yankees introduced a home cap with a pinstripe visor and a road cap with a grey crown and a navy visor. The Seattle Mariners replaced their compass logo with their original M-shaped trident updated in current team colors. The Chicago Cubs added an alternate cap featuring an \"angry cub\" logo. The Atlanta Braves added a solid navy cap with a tomahawk. Tampa Bay Rays added a powder blue cap with a white front panel, featuring their starburst logo. Cleveland Indians changed the front panel of their cap from white to red. The New York Mets replaced the \"Mr. Met\" logo with their \"NY\" logo.\nAnniversaries and special events.\nThe following teams wore commemorative patches for special occasions:\nOther uniforms.\nThe Cubs wore gold-trimmed numbers and letters on the backs of their shirts April 10 and 12 to mark their winning the 2016 World Series title.\nPlayers, managers, coaches and umpires wore #42 on April 15, the 70th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's debut in the majors.\nOn April 17 (Patriots' Day), the Boston Red Sox wore home white jerseys with \"BOSTON\" written on the front to mark the four-year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings. The uniform also sported the 2013 navy-blue circular patch with a white border on the left shoulder saying \"B Strong\" (with the red B in the classic font featured on the Red Sox's caps).\nThe Padres wore camouflage uniforms on April 23, Air Force Appreciation Day. They wore them again on June 25, Naval Appreciation Day.\nThe Reds and Giants wore Spanish language \"Los Rojos\" and \"Gigantes\" uniforms May 5, Cinco de Mayo.

        "text": "The WPI Engineers men's basketball team is the college basketball program representing Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). The Engineers compete in the Division III (DIII) of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the NEWMAC. WPI's men's basketball program began competing regularly as a varsity sport in 1918. The team is currently coached by Chris Bartley.\nWPI plays its home games at Harrington Auditorium, located on the campus in Worcester, Massachusetts, with a capacity of 3,000.\nHistory.\nAlthough an informal team played in 1902, the WPI Engineers basketball team was sponsored by the Athletic Association in 1903, but then was abolished in the spring of 1910. The sport was brought back in 1915, but only as an intramural. It wasn't until the winter of 1917–1918, that basketball became an intercollegiate sport again. The team won back to back New England Championships during the 1919–20 and 1920–21 and seasons. According to the Premo-Porretta Power Poll, the 1919–20 team would have been ranked 25th in the country.\nThe 1965–66 team was defeated by Army 71–62 on December 8, 1965. The win marked the first career coaching victory for the Hall of Fame coach, Bobby Knight.\nDuring the 2012–13 season, the team was ranked second in the nation in National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III and had their best start ever, going undefeated for their first 22 games. On February 24, 2013, WPI beat Springfield College in overtime to win the NEWMAC Championship and secure a place in the 2013 NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament.\nThe Engineers had a program record 27 victories during their 2021–22 season, which included a NEWMAC regular season championship, a NEWMAC tournament championship, and an Elite Eight appearance in the 2022 NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament. This marked the program's second NCAA quarterfinal game and first since 1985. "

        "text": "Stephen Todd Anderson Jr. (born January 30, 1993) is an American football tight end who is a free agent. He played college football at California and signed with the Houston Texans as an undrafted free agent in 2016. He has also played for the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Chargers.\nEarly years.\nAnderson attended and played high school football for Piedmont Hills High School.\nHe graduated from Piedmont Hills in 2011 and attended the University of California, Berkeley.\nCollege career.\nAnderson attended and played college football for the University of California Golden Bears from 2011 to 2015.\nAnderson redshirted as a true freshman in 2011. As a redshirt freshman in 2012, he appeared in four games. In the 2013 season opener against Portland State, he had his first three career collegiate receptions for 22 yards. Overall, in the 2013 season, he had 14 receptions for 125 yards. His role in the offense expanded in 2014. On September 20, against Arizona, he had 43 receiving yards and his first collegiate touchdown. In the next game, against Colorado, he had seven receptions for 136 yards and a touchdown. In the next game at Washington State, he had five receptions for 95 yards. On October 24, in the game against Oregon at Levi's Stadium, he had 32 receiving yards and a touchdown in the loss. On November 1, against Oregon State, he had nine receptions for 117 yards. Overall, in the 2014 season, he had 46 receptions for 661 yards and five touchdowns. His production dropped in the 2015 season, but he remained as a presence in the offense. On October 10, against Utah, he had six receptions for a season-high 99 yards. In the 2015 season, he finished with 41 receptions for 474 yards and two touchdowns. Overall, he played in 37 games with 25 starts all during the last four seasons of his five campaigns with the program. He finished his career with 101 receptions for 1,260 yards and seven touchdowns. He earned both honorable mention All-Pac-12 selection of the league's coaches and Cal's Ken Cotton Award as the team's Most Courageous Player as a junior and senior.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nAnderson was one of 15 tight ends to receive an invitation to attend the NFL combine. Although he primarily played wide receiver at Cal, he chose to transition to tight end. He was limited to performing the bench press, vertical jump, and broad jump due to a hamstring injury. Anderson was the lightest tight end and tied UCLA's Thomas Duarte as the shortest of the tight ends at 6'2\". Among his position group at the combine, he finished first in the vertical jump (38\"), fourth in the broad jump (9'11\"), and tenth in the bench press (16). On March 18, 2016, Anderson opted to participate at Cal's pro day, along with Jared Goff, Bryce Treggs, Daniel Lasco, Maurice Harris, Kenny Lawler, Trevor Davis, Kyle Kragen, Stefan McClure, Darius Powe, and two others. His performance in the 40-yard dash, 20-yard dash, and 10-yard dash would've finished first among his position group at the combine. Anderson's time in the three-cone drill would've garnered him fourth place. He also ran positional drills and caught passes for the team representatives and scouts from all 32 NFL teams. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Anderson was projected to be selected as early as the fourth to fifth round or as late as the sixth to seventh round. He was ranked as the top fullback prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com.\nHouston Texans.\n2016.\nAnderson went undrafted in the 2016 NFL Draft. On April 30, 2016, the Houston Texans signed Anderson as an undrafted free agent to a three-year, $1.62 million contract that includes a $5,000 signing bonus.\nThroughout his first training camp, he competed with Anthony Denham and Eric Tomlinson for a roster spot. Anderson received a bulk of first team reps during training camp after C. J. Fiedorowicz and Ryan Griffin missed stretches of camp due to injuries. Head coach Bill O'Brien named Anderson the Texans' third tight end, behind C. J. Fiedorowicz and Ryan Griffin, to begin the regular season. Offensive coordinator George Godsey developed a hybrid H-back role for Anderson, better utilizing his speed and receiving ability.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Texans' season-opener against the Chicago Bears and caught three passes for 25 yards during the 23–14 victory. He made his first career reception at the start of the second quarter, catching a 12-yard pass from Brock Osweiler before being tackled by Bears' safety Adrian Amos. In Week 3, Anderson suffered a hamstring injury during the Texans' 27–0 loss at the New England Patriots. Unfortunately, the injured hamstring caused him to miss the next three games (Weeks 4–6). On November 13, 2016, Anderson caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from Brock Osweiler, as the Texans defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 24–21. He finished his rookie season in with a total of 11 receptions for 93 receiving yards and one touchdown in 13 games.\nThe Houston Texans finished atop the AFC South with a 9–7 record in 2016.

They were eliminated in the Divisional Round after losing a 34–16 game to the eventual Super Bowl LI champion Patriots.\n2017.\nHe competed for a roster spot throughout training camp against Rashaun Allen, Evan Baylis, and Zach Conque. He was named the Texans' third tight end on their depth chart behind Fiedorowicz and Griffin.\nHe earned his first career start in the Texans' season-opener against the Jaguars and caught two passes for 14 yards before leaving the game after suffering a concussion. C. J. Fiedorowicz and Ryan Griffin also suffered concussions during the Texans' 29–7 loss. He remained in concussion protocol and was inactive for the Texans' \"Thursday Night Football\" game against the Cincinnati Bengals four days later. On October 8, 2017, Anderson caught two passes for a season-high 63 yards in Houston's 42–34 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. Anderson became the second tight end on the Texans' depth chart after C. J. Fiedorowicz missed eight games after suffering his second concussion. On December 3, 2017, Anderson caught a season-high five passes for 79 yards and a touchdown in the Texans' 24–13 loss at the Tennessee Titans. His first touchdown of the season came on a four-yard pass by Tom Savage in the second quarter.

On the 2021 season, he had 16 receptions for 165 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown.\nArizona Cardinals.\nOn April 4, 2022, Anderson signed with the Arizona Cardinals on a one-year contract. He was released during final roster cuts on August 30, but quickly re–signed with the team two days later. He appeared in 16 games in the 2022 season. He had three receptions for nine yards on the year and a majority of his playing time was on special teams.\nLos Angeles Chargers (second stint).\nOn November 15, 2023, Anderson was signed to the Chargers practice squad.

        "title": "2017 Vuelta a España",
        "text": "The 2017 Vuelta a España was a three-week Grand Tour cycling stage race that took place in Spain between 19 August and 10 September 2017. The race was the 72nd edition of the Vuelta a España and the final Grand Tour of the 2017 cycling season. The race started in Nîmes, France, and finished in Madrid. It was the first time the race has started in France and only the third time it has started outside Spain, after 1997 (Portugal) and 2009 (Netherlands).\nThe general classification was won by 2017 Tour de France champion Chris Froome from , ahead of Vincenzo Nibali of . \nFroome became the third rider to win the Tour-Vuelta double after Jacques Anquetil (1963) and Bernard Hinault (1978), and the first to do so since the Vuelta was moved to its current calendar position. \nFroome also won the points and combination classifications, becoming the first rider to win three jerseys in a single Vuelta since Denis Menchov in 2007. The mountains classification was won by rider Davide Villella, while 's Alberto Contador won the combativity award in his final Grand Tour, as well as the final mountain stage atop the iconic Angliru. Astana took the team award.\nTeams.\nThe 2017 edition of the Vuelta a España consisted of 22 teams. All eighteen UCI WorldTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. On 27 March 2017, the organiser of the Vuelta, Unipublic, announced the four second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations. The presentation of the teams – where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place inside the Arena of Nîmes in Nîmes, France, on 19 August, before the start of stage one, held in the city.\nEach squad was allowed a maximum of nine riders, resulting in a start list total of 198 riders. Of these, 75 were competing in their first Vuelta a España. The total number of riders that finished the race was 158. The riders came from 33 countries. Six countries had more than 10 riders in the race: Spain (31), France (20), Italy (20), Belgium (17), the Netherlands (15), and Colombia (12). The average age of riders in the race was 27.6 years, ranging from the 20-year-old Lennard Kämna () to the 40-year-old Svein Tuft (). had the youngest average age while had the oldest.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nReigning Vuelta champion Nairo Quintana () chose not to defend his title, after having competed in both the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France earlier in the season. Chris Froome (), who arrived at the Vuelta having won his fourth Tour de France the month before, was considered the favourite by most commentators and bookmakers. Froome had previously finished second at the Vuelta on three occasions. A victory in Spain would make him only the third rider after Jacques Anquetil (in 1963) and Bernard Hinault (in 1978) to win both the Tour and the Vuelta in the same season, and the first rider to do so since the race was moved in the calendar from spring to late summer. It would also make him the first British rider to win the race.\nIn Quintana's absence, bib number one was handed to three-time winner Alberto Contador (), who announced in early August that he would retire from cycling after the race. Contador was considered to be among the favourites, although his performances in recent Grand Tours had cast doubt upon his potential. 2010 winner Vincenzo Nibali () was considered to be Froome's closest rival for overall victory, having skipped the Tour de France. Fabio Aru (), winner of the 2015 edition, started the race as a favourite as well after he performed well to finish fifth overall at the Tour de France.\nThe previous year's third-placed finisher, Esteban Chaves (), was also given chances to win the race overall. Other riders mentioned to potentially finish high in the general classification were Steven Kruijswijk () and Rafał Majka (), third in 2015. Potential favourites to make their debut at the Vuelta were Ilnur Zakarin (), who had finished fifth at the Giro d'Italia in May, as well as both Adam and Simon Yates (both ).\nRoute and stages.\nThe route of the 2017 Vuelta a España was revealed by Unipublic on 12 January 2017. Keeping with the tradition of the past few years, the race started off with a team time trial. However, the race started in France, just the third time in history that the Spanish Grand Tour began outside of its home country.\nThe third stage saw the race leave France, with a mountain stage to Andorra la Vella. The first uphill finale was on stage 5, with a summit finish atop the Ermita de Santa Lucía. The queen stage of the 2017 Vuelta was stage 20, which featured a summit finish atop the Alto de l'Angliru. Finally, the race ended with a customary circuit race in Madrid.\nClassification leadership.\nThe Vuelta a España had three individual classifications, for which jerseys were awarded daily to the leading rider, as well as a team competition. The primary classification was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the two individual time trials. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the leader of the general classification, and wears the red jersey. The leader of the general classification at the end of the race was considered the overall winner of the Vuelta a España.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe next classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, third-, second-, and first- and special-category. The leader wore a white jersey with blue polka dots.\nThe final of the individual classifications was the combination classification. A rider's ranking in the combination classification was determined by tallying up his positions in the general, points, and mountains classifications. The leader wore a white jersey. If no rider was classified in all three classifications, riders classified in two would have been considered, and if that was tied the general classification will decide the winner.\nThere was also the team classification. After each stage, the times of the three highest finishers of each team are added together. The victory was awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative time at the end of the event.\nIn addition, there were two individual awards: the combativity award and the young rider award. The combativity award was given after each stage to the rider \"who displayed the most generous\neffort and best sporting spirit.\" The daily winner wore a green number bib the following stage. At the end of the Vuelta, a jury decides the top three riders for the \"Most Combative Rider of\nLa Vuelta\", with a public vote deciding the victor. The young rider award is calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1992. The leader wore a red number bib.\nA total of €1,120,230 will be awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification will receive €150,000, with the second and third placed riders getting €57,000 and €30,000 respectively. All finishers in the top 20 were awarded with money. The holders of the four individual classifications benefited on each stage they led. The final winners of the points and combined were given €11,000, while the mountains classification got €23,100 and the most combative rider got €3,000. The team classification winners were given €12,500. €11,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2–20. There was also a special award with a prize of €1,000, the Cima Alberto Fernández, given to first rider (Miguel Ángel López) to reach the summit of the Alto Hoya de la Mora at the finish of stage fifteen.\nUCI rankings.\nThe race was the 25th of the 38 events in the UCI World Tour, with riders from the WorldTeams competing for individually and for their teams for points that contributed towards the rankings. Riders from both the WorldTeams and Professional Continental teams also competed individually and for their nations for points that contributed towards the UCI World Ranking, which included all UCI races. The points accrued by Chris Froome moved him up to second from tenth in the World Tour and rose to third from sixth in the World Ranking. Greg Van Avermaet () held the lead of both individual rankings. took the lead of the World Tour team ranking and Belgium remained top of the World Ranking nation ranking.\nAdverse analytical finding.\nOn 13 December 2017, it was announced by Team Sky that Chris Froome was found with 2000 ng/ml of Salbutamol in a sample collected on 7 September, after the finish of stage 18. Froome, who suffers from asthma, is allowed a dose of 1000 ng/ml. If the UCI had found this to be a doping violation, he could have lost his Vuelta title and faced a potential ban from competitive cycling. On 2 July 2018, the UCI, with the cooperation of WADA, ruled that upon review of the submitted evidence that there was no wrongdoing and closed the case, exonerating Froome and allowing his 2017 Vuelta win to stand."

        "text": "Slovenia competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from 9 to 25 February 2018. 71 athletes competed in 9 sports, including the men's national ice hockey team.\nSlovenian athletes won two Olympic medals: biathlete Jakov Fak won silver in men's individual while snowboarder Žan Košir won bronze in men's parallel giant slalom, his third Olympic medal in total. The country ranked 24th in the medal table. The ice hockey team won two games in the preliminary round, against United States and Slovakia, but lost in the playoffs against Norway.\nSummary.\nIn January 2018, the Olympic Committee of Slovenia officially confirmed 71 competitors who would represent the country at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Slovenia men's national ice hockey team already qualified for the Olympic tournament at the qualification tournament in 2016. Vesna Fabjan, a cross-country skier and a bronze medalist from Sochi, was chosen as the flag-bearer for the opening ceremony. The selection was conducted using a Facebook poll among three candidates, Fabjan, biathlete Jakov Fak, and ice hockey player Mitja Robar. Fak later distanced himself from the poll after being targeted by hate speech in online forums, having previously represented Croatia at the 2010 Winter Olympics. In Vancouver, Fak won a bronze medal in men's sprint.\nIn Sochi, Slovenia won a record eight medals, including two gold by alpine skier Tina Maze. Since the 2014 Olympics, Maze retired from competitive skiing, as did the biathlete Teja Gregorin. The media expectations were lower than before the Sochi Olympics. Alpine skier Ilka Štuhec, the 2017 downhill World Champion and second in the overall 2016-17 World Cup standings, suffered an injury in autumn 2017 and had to skip the entire 2017-18 season. The strongest potential candidate for medals was Jakov Fak, who had strong World Cup performances earlier in the season, with media noting that freestyle skier Filip Flisar, ski jumpers, or alpine skiers were also capable of achieving good results.\nIn alpine skiing, the best Slovenian result was a 4th place of Žan Kranjec in giant slalom, while skiers won three more top-10 finishes. In team event, Slovenian team was eliminated in the round of 16 against Sweden. The best result in women's events was an 11th place of Ana Bucik in women's combined.\nIn biathlon, five men and two women competed. Jakov Fak faced some problems at the first two events but won a silver medal at the men's individual event, covering all 20 targets. Among other prominent results, Fak finished 10th in mass start, Klemen Bauer 10th in individual, and Urška Poje 12th in women's individual, covering all 20 targets.\nIn cross-country skiing, the best results were achieved by Anamarija Lampič who finished 7th in sprint and 6th in team sprint together with Alenka Čebašek.\nAt the men's ice hockey tournament, Slovenia competed in Group B with United States, Slovakia, and Olympic Athletes from Russia in the preliminary round. Following the NHL's decision not to allow its players to participate at the tournament, Slovenia's top player Anže Kopitar of Los Angeles Kings was unable to join the team. In their first game, Slovenia beat the United States 3-2 in overtime, having returned from 0-2 in the last third. Goal scorers for Slovenia were Jan Urbas and Jan Muršak. In the second game, Slovenia lost 2-8 to the OAR team, with Žiga Pance and Muršak scoring for Slovenia. Slovenia won against Slovakia 3-2 after a penalty shootout. Slovenia finished 2nd in their group and faced Norway in the playoff. Norway won 2-1 in overtime and Slovenia finished 9th in the overall ranking. Just before the game against Norway, the IOC announced that Žiga Jeglič tested positive for doping. In his reaction, Jeglič stated that he had neglected to report his use of an asthma drug containing fenoterol which his doctor had prescribed for him. Jelgič was suspended from the games and had to skip the game against Norway.\nIn ski jumping, the best individual results were a 7th place of Nika Križnar in women's normal hill individual and an 11th place of Peter Prevc in men's large hill individual. Slovenian team finished 5th at the team event.\nIn snowboarding, none of the three athletes in freestyle events qualified for the finals. In parallel event (giant slalom), Žan Košir, Tim Mastnak, and Glorija Kotnik qualified to the finals. Mastnak and Kotnik were eliminated in the round of 16 while Košir won a bronze medal after defeating Sylvain Dufour of France. Košir's semifinal defeat against Lee Sang-ho of South Korea caused some controversy as the photo finish clearly showed Košir crossing the finish line well ahead of Lee. Later, FIS officials explained that the time was measured correctly and that the photo finish footage is irrelevant. Ultimately, Košir stated that he was happy with the medal he won, having skipped the previous two seasons due to back injuries.\nAmong other events, Tilen Sirše finished 39th in luge, the best Slovenian result in Nordic combined was a 28th place of Vid Vrhovnik in normal hill/10 km, and Filip Flisar finished 7th in men's ski cross. Flisar was the flagbearer for Slovenia at the closing ceremony.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating at the Games per sport/discipline.\nBiathlon.\nBased on their Nations Cup ranking in the 2016–17 Biathlon World Cup, Slovenia has qualified 5 men and 2 women.\nIce hockey.\nMen's tournament.\nSlovenia men's national ice hockey team qualified by winning the final qualification tournament in Minsk, Belarus.\nLuge.\nBased on the results from the World Cups during the 2017–18 Luge World Cup season, Slovenia qualified 2 sleds, but rejected one quota.\nSki jumping.\nSlovenia qualified nine quota places in ski jumping."

The event began on Thursday 2 February at the Metro Radio Arena in Newcastle and ended with the Play-offs at The O2 Arena in London on Thursday 18 May. This was the fourth year that the tournament was sponsored by Betway.\nMichael van Gerwen, the 2016 champion, retained his title by winning the last-leg decider against Peter Wright in the final, after Wright missed six darts to win 11–9. Kim Huybrechts became the first player in Premier League Darts history to fail to win a match in the tournament.\nFormat.\nThe tournament format is identical to that since 2013.

Each canoe or kayak can hold one person (1), two people (2), or four people (4). For each of the specific canoes or kayaks, such as a K-1 (kayak single), the competition distances can be 200, 500, 1000 or 5000 metres. When a competition is listed as a K-2 500m event, for example, it means two people are in a kayak competing over a distance of 500 metres.\nParacanoe competitions are contested in either a va'a (V), an outrigger canoe (which includes a second pontoon) with a single-blade paddle, or in a kayak (as above). All international competitions are held over 200 metres in single-man boats, with three event classes in both types of vessel for men and women depending on the level of an athlete's impairment. The lower the classification number, the more severe the impairment is – for example, VL1 is a va'a competition for those with particularly severe impairments.\nCanoe sprint.\nMen's events.\n Non-Olympic classes\nWomen's events.\n Non-Olympic classes\nParacanoe.\nMedal events.\n Non-Paralympic classes"

        "text": "The Crooked Billet is a pub at 14–15 Crooked Billet, facing onto Wimbledon Common, Wimbledon, London. The building dates from the early 18th century and became the Crooked Billet during the 1750s. The district of Wimbledon called Crooked Billet may have taken its name from the pub.\nIn 1888 Young's Brewery leased the Crooked Billet pub, and bought the freehold in 1928. In 1974 Young's Brewery purchased the nearby Hand in Hand. After the pubs were enlarged and refurbished, they were sold in 2006. The pubs are separated from the green. In Wright's Alley, ale was historically delivered to customers by Shire horses pulling brewer's drays.\nAlong with the Hand in Hand, the Crooked Billet faces onto a small triangular green. Nearby can be found King's College School. Eagle House and Wimbledon House are also in the vicinity.\nThe pub's cellars are said to be haunted by the ghost of an Irish woman."

Both the East and West courses are open to the public and are made in 18-hole championship style. The men's and women's Michigan State Spartans golf teams are resident there. The West course was redesigned by golf course architect Arthur Hills – an alumnus of Michigan State. The East course was redesigned in 1997. The courses also contain a golf center for practice.\nThe courses were rated four star by \"Golf Digest\" in 1999. The courses are named after Forest Akers, an alumnus of who donated the land to the institution. A condition of the donation was that the course also had to serve as an arboretum and as a result it hosts a variety of plant life native to Michigan. It is the only golf course to feature an arboretum. The original course was designed by W. Bruce Matthews. The West course was opened in 1958. The West Course is the most challenging of the two, and the East course is a par-72 course since its redesign in 1997.\nGiven the quality of the courses, it has served as the venue for college championships included the NCAA regionals, Big Ten Conference Championships and the Western Junior Championships. In addition to golf, the courses served as the venue for the NCAA Men's Division I Cross Country Championships during its early history. Indeed, it was the only location used for the championship for the first 25 editions that it was held."

        "text": "Pat Ford is a Canadian retired ice hockey player and head coach, most recently leading the Findlay Oilers in their final season as a Division I program.\nCareer.\nPat Ford played four years at Wisconsin in the mid 1980s, winning the WCHA tournament in his senior season. After graduating with a degree in bacteriology Ford briefly was a member of both the Canadian National Team and Swindon Wildcats before retiring as a player.\nIn 1990 he started his coaching career as an assistant at Madison Edgewood while also working as a graduate assistant with his alma mater. He became a full-time assistant with Northern Michigan in 1992 and two years later returned to Madison to take the same position with the Badgers. In the summer of 2002 Ford was hired as an associate coach for Findlay shortly after his former boss Jeff Sauer announced his retirement. While things appeared to be heading in the right direction for Ford, a year later the administration at Findlay changed and he soon was named as head coach after former bench boss Craig Barnett resigned. by January the following year Findlay announced that the team would be reduced to club status once more but Ford provided one final achievement for the program, winning their only playoff game in the 2004 CHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. Rather than continue to search for coaching opportunities Ford hung up his whistle after the season was over and continued his career working for Hellenbrand Water, a company in Waunakee, Wisconsin.\nPersonal life.\nPat Ford has three sons with his wife Cammie, Jason, Keegan and Kevin. Jason is entering his junior year with Wisconsin. Keegan had attended Wisconsin in 2014 but, after playing only twelve games, left the program and transferred to Michigan Tech where he is set to begin playing in the fall of 2016. Kevin is currently playing junior hockey for the Kirkland Lake Gold Miners. (as of 2016)"

        "text": "Corey A. Baker (born November 23, 1989) is an Israeli-American former professional baseball pitcher in the St. Louis Cardinals organization, and a former video replay coordinator for the Minnesota Twins. He plays for the Israel National Baseball Team.\nWhile in high school, Baker played three seasons for the Bayside Yankees traveling baseball team and had a 20-1 record. He pitched in college for the University of Pittsburgh Panthers, was named in 2010 to the All-Big East First Team, and to the ABCA/Rawlings All-East Region First Team, and ended his college career as the university's all-time career wins leader, with 24.\nBaker was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 49th round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. In 2013, he was a Midwest League All Star with the Peoria Chiefs. In May 2016, he was named Texas League Pitcher of the Week while pitching for the AA Springfield Cardinals.\nIn September 2016 Baker pitched as a starter for Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic qualifier, winning his only start. He also pitched for Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic main tournament. In October 2018, he became a dual Israeli citizen. Baker is competing on the Israel national baseball team for qualification for the 2020 Olympics.\nEarly and personal life.\nBaker was born in New York, New York, to Mark (a TV producer, who grew up in Brooklyn) and Leah Baker, and was raised in New City, New York. He is Jewish, and grew up attending a Reform congregation in New City, where he attended Hebrew school twice a week and had his bar mitzvah. Baker played in the Maccabi Games in the 11-to-12 age group. He now lives in Seattle, Washington.\nIn October 2018 he became a dual Israeli citizen, partly to help Israel's baseball team make the 2020 Olympics.\nHigh school.\nBaker attended Clarkstown South High School in West Nyack, New York, where for three years he pitched and played second base. He was a two-time all-league selection as a junior and senior, and named all-county, all-section, and runner-up Section Player of the Year as a senior, and threw a no-hitter in his final season. He graduated in 2007. He also played three seasons of summer baseball for the Bayside Yankees traveling baseball team, for whom he had a 20-1 record.\nCollege.\nBaker then pitched for the University of Pittsburgh Panthers, attending the school on a partial baseball scholarship, while majoring in history and minoring in political science. As a sophomore, in March 2009 he was named Big East Pitcher of the Week. As a junior, in 2010 he was 11-3 (with his 11 wins the third-most in the country) and was named to the All-Big East First Team, and to the ABCA/Rawlings All-East Region First Team. He ended his career with the school as the Pittsburgh Panthers' all-time career wins leader, with 24, and fourth all-time in school history with 221 strikeouts.\nHe plans to eventually return to school to study for a master's degree in Sports Management.\nMinor leagues.\nBaker was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 49th round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft (a round that no longer exists, as the following year the MLB draft was limited to 40 rounds), and signed for a small bonus. He made his professional debut in 2011 with the Batavia Muckdogs of the Class A- New York-Pennsylvania League. He started the 2013 season playing for the Peoria Chiefs of the Class A Midwest League where he was an All Star, and then pitched for the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Class A+ Florida State League, before joining the Springfield Cardinals of the Class AA Texas League at the end of the season. In 2014, he pitched for Palm Beach and Springfield, and in a combined 37 games (5 starts) he was 6-2 with a 2.87 ERA and 2 saves.\nOn August 31, 2015, Baker pitched his first career shutout for Springfield. That year, after leading all Springfield pitchers with 88 strikeouts as he split time between the starting rotation and the bullpen, he led Springfield to the Texas League playoffs. Springfield pitching coach Jason Simontacchi said of Baker that he: can pitch as a closer ... middle relief, and as a starter. Baker throws strikes. ... He's got a super sinker, when it is right, it is very good, and I think that pitch could play at the big-league level. His changeup is a swing and miss pitch, can throw it in any count, and he mixes in a slider towards righties.\nPitching for Springfield again the following season, he was named Texas League Pitcher of the Week for April 25-May 1, 2016. Baker then ended the season pitching as a starter for the Memphis Redbirds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League.\nBaker was a non-roster invitee to the Cardinals major league spring training camp in 2017. He began the season pitching in relief as a closer for Springfield. At mid-season, he was a Texas League All-Star. On July 13, 2017, Baker was released from Cardinals organization after having spent 7 years in their minor league system. Pitching for the Springfield Cardinals in 2017, in 40 innings over 25 relief appearances he had a 2.48 ERA and led the team with six saves, in six save opportunities.\nIn the 2017-18 season, Baker pitched for the Leones del Caracas of the Venezuelan Winter League, where he was 1-0 with a 3.74 ERA in 15 games.\nMinnesota Twins replay coordinator.\nAt the start of the 2018 season, Baker retired as a player. He joined the Minnesota Twins as their replay coordinator for the 2018 season. \nTeam Israel.\nBaker pitched for Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic qualifier. As part of demonstrating that Baker was Jewish and therefore eligible to pitch for Team Israel, his family sent the team a bar mitzvah photo of Baker at age 13, wearing a yarmulke and dark suit, and holding a torah. Baker's only appearance in the tournament was a start in the second game against Brazil. Israel won the game 1-0, advancing to the finals, and Baker was credited with the win. Baker threw 83 pitches over 5 shutout innings, while giving up a hit, three walks, and striking out six.\nBaker pitched as the # 2 starter for Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic in the main tournament, in March 2017.\nBaker is competing on the Israel national baseball team for qualification for the 2020 Olympics. He pitched in one game in relief as the team played in the 2019 European Baseball Championship - B-Pool in early July 2019 in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria, winning all of its games and advancing to the playoffs against Team Lithuania in the 2019 Playoff Series at the end of July 2019 for the last qualifying spot for the 2019 European Baseball Championship. He was 0-0 with a 4.50 ERA in two innings."

He threw a 84 mph fastball. He was an All-League selection as a junior, and named All-County, Second Team All-Long Island, 2012 honorable mention Rawlings/Perfect Game Preseason All-America, \"Perfect Game\" first team All-Northeast Region, MVP of the Nassau County Exceptional Senior Game, and won the Best Pitcher Award for the RTC Grand Slam Challenge (Long Island All-Star Game).\nCollege.\nKatz then pitched for the St. John's Red Storm, attending the school on a baseball and academic scholarship, while majoring in sports management and minoring in business. As a freshman, Katz made 22 appearances, including two starts, and went 1–3 with one save and a 5.33 ERA. During the summer of 2013, Katz pitched in the Hamptons Collegiate Baseball League for the Shelter Island Bucks and in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. \"Baseball America\" named Katz the top pitching prospect in the Hamptons Collegiate Baseball League for that season, and \"Perfect Game\" named him the Hamptons pitcher with the best breaking ball.\nAs a sophomore, Katz appeared in 16 games, including nine starts, and went 1–2 with a 3.86 ERA and 39 strikeouts in 42.0 innings of work. On April 2, 2014, Katz started and struck out five in 6.0 scoreless innings of no-hit ball to earn the win as part of a combined one-hit shutout at Wagner.

Orioles Executive Vice President Dan Duquette said of Katz: He has a good fastball and excellent strikeout record. A lot of guys like him and they project him to be a major league reliever. We’re going to send him to Frederick... He showed a good fastball and a really good breaking ball in the [World Baseball Classic]. We got a couple good looks at him. At the time of the trade, Katz had struck out 10.1 batters per 9 innings in his 62-game, 102-inning minor league career.

In 2019 he was 0–0 with a 4.70 ERA over 15.1 innings for the Ducks. He became a free agent following the season.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn February 12, 2020, Katz signed a minor league deal with the Kansas City Royals.

Katz was released by the Royals organization on November 12.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn May 4, 2021, Katz signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs. He was assigned to the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Low-A East, later receiving promotions to the South Bend Cubs of the High-A Central and the Tennessee Smokies of the Double-A South. In 20 appearances between the three affiliates, Katz posted a cumulative 6.51 ERA with 44 strikeouts in 47 innings pitched. He elected minor league free agency following the season on November 7.\nStaten Island FerryHawks.\nOn April 18, 2022, Katz signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.

He pitched in 4 games, pitching 3.1 scoreless innings.\nIn October 2018 he became a dual Israeli citizen, partly to help Israel’s baseball team make the 2020 Olympics.\nHe pitched for the Israel national baseball team in two relief appearances at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo in the summer of 2021.\nHe played for Team Israel in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. He played for Team Israel manager and former All-Star Ian Kinsler, and alongside All-Star outfielder Joc Pederson and pitcher Dean Kremer, among others.\nKatz pitched for Team Israel in the 2023 European Baseball Championship in September 2023 in the Czech Republic.\nBusiness venture; Stadium Custom Kicks.\nKatz, who describes himself as \"a big sneakerhead,\" started a company named Stadium Custom Kicks (\"SCK\"), which customizes baseball cleats. He began by watching online videos to learn how to paint sneakers, and then purchased paint and developed a design. When he first began customizing cleats, the first pair he customized was for himself for the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Rob Refsnyder, a New York Yankee at the time, saw the design on an Instagram account, and direct-messaged Katz, asking: \"Hey, can my friend Aaron and I send in a bunch of cleats?” Refsnyder and a rookie outfielder named Aaron Judge thus became his first major league clients. The company was officially born in August 2019, after Major League Baseball ended its insistence on uniformity in 2018, which had been reflected in its Collective Bargaining Agreement’s Footwear Supplier Regulations “51 percent rule,” which required that players’ cleats mainly display their team’s primary colors.

        "text": "The 1908 Interstate rugby league series was the first series of matches between the then newly formed New South Wales and Queensland rugby league football teams. In what was rugby league in Australia's first year, three matches were played in July and all were won by New South Wales. These matches began the tradition of annual series between New South Wales and Queensland that would go on to form the basis of the State of Origin series.\nFollowing the success of the 1907–08 All Golds tour, the Queensland rugby league team went on to arrange three games against New South Wales at the Sydney Agricultural Ground. Although remaining winless, thrashed 43-0 and 37-8 in the first two games, the tight 12-3 result in the third match gave Queensland its first-ever rugby league stars, with Mick Bolewski, Bill Hardcastle, Bill Heidke and Jack Fihelly all being selected for the first-ever Kangaroo tour to England.\nGame 1.\nStill some months away from having their own competition, Queensland traveled to Sydney to play rugby league football against New South Wales for the first time.\nWith the likes of the great Dally Messenger, Billy Cann, Jersey O'Malley and skipper Arthur Hennessy in their ranks the Blues represented the cream of the newly established NSWRFL, whilst Queensland had done well to assemble a team as they had not yet established a club competition. It was no surprise, then, that NSW proved far superior in this inaugural meeting, with South Sydney winger Tommy Anderson posting four tries as the Blues raced to a 43-0 win.\nGame 2.\nNew South Wales selected a completely new team for the second match. This is regarded as an exhibition match and is not included in official interstate rugby league totals.\nGame 3.\nThe last game of the series was played on a slippery Royal Agricultural Ground before approximately 6,000. In what was described as a fast match, New South Wales led 5-3 at half time, keeping the Queenslanders out eventually winning 12-3."

Initially the tournament was played in the year following the Olympic Games, except for 1973 when no tournament was held, but since 1991 the World Cup has been awarded in the year preceding the Olympic Games.\nThe current champions are the United States, who won their third title at the 2023 tournament.\nThe current format of the competition involves eight teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation Japan, competing in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks. The World Cup (with exception of the 2019 edition) acts as the first qualification event for the following year's Olympic Games with the top two teams qualifying.\nThe 15 World Cup tournaments have been won by six different national teams. Russia is the most successful team, having won the title six times (four as Soviet Union). The other World Cup winners are Brazil and the United States with three titles each, followed by Cuba, Italy and East Germany with one title each.\nThis tournament should not be confused with the FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship.\nHistory.\nThe World Cup was created in 1965 with the purpose of partially filling the gap between the two most important volleyball tournaments, the Olympic Games and the World Championship, which take place in alternating four-year cycles. The establishment of a third international competition would leave only one in every four years with no major events. The World Cup has a smaller entry than the World Championship, with at most twelve teams.\nThe World Cup was to be held in the year following the Olympic Games. The first two tournaments were for men's volleyball only; in 1973, a women's tournament was also introduced. Originally, each tournament had a different host, but in 1977 the competition was transferred to Japan on a permanent basis.\nIn the 1990s, the installment of annual international events such as the World League and the Grand Prix made the original motivations for the creation of the World Cup obsolete. Instead of letting a consolidated event disappear for lack of interest, the FIVB decided to change its format in 1991: it would be held in the year preceding, and not following, the Olympic Games; and it would be considered a first international Olympic qualification tournament, granting the winners a direct berth in the games.\nThis move saved the competition. The possibility of securing an early berth for the Olympic Games, thus avoiding extraneous and in some cases tight continental qualification procedures, became a consistent motivation for the national federations to participate in the World Cup. In 1995, the number of Olympic spots granted at the competition was increased to three, as it remained until 2011. In 2015 the number of spots was only two again.\nWith the change of qualification for the Paris Summer Olympics, the 2023 World Cup will serve as one of the three Olympic qualification tournaments. Only eight teams will participate in this edition, with two tickets to Paris Olympics for the top two teams.\nWinners.\nRussia (considered as the inheritors of the records of the former Soviet Union), Brazil and United States are the only teams that have won the Men's World Cup more than once.\nThe Soviets took the gold at the opening edition of the tournament, in 1965. Four years later, the winner was also a socialist nation, East Germany.\nScheduled for Uruguay, the 1973 edition was cancelled. In 1977, competition was resumed in Japan, and the Soviet Union came back for two wins in a row. In 1985, they were once again runners-up, but lost the decisive match to United States in five sets. In 1989, Cuba surprised the world and beat a rising Italy to take the gold.\nWith the competition now set as a qualifying event for the Olympic Games, the Soviet Union, led by Dmitri Fomin won the title in 1991, at the brink of dissolution. The Italians, who hadn't participated in this edition, finally conquered their gold medal in 1995. Inheriting a large part of the former Soviet volleyball programme, Russia were the winners in 1999.\nThe following two editions, played in 2003 and 2007 respectively, were won by favorites Brazil. In 2011, Russia regained the title, while the 2015 edition was won by the United States for the second time. Brazil won the title for the third time in 2019.\nCompetition formula.\nThe World Cup is the most stable from all competition formulas employed by the FIVB. The following rules apply:"

With the help of superstar player Lang Ping, China won the following two editions, in 1981 and 1985.\nThen Cuba stepped forward to begin its amazing World Cup career, winning its first title in 1989. With the tournament now as an Olympic qualifier, there followed three more consecutive victories, in 1991, 1995 and 1999.\nChina came back in 2003 with a remarkably offensive team to win its third title.\nItaly won the 2007 edition with an outstanding record of eleven wins in eleven games and only two sets left to the opponents (both lost against Serbia). Italy took a second win in a row in 2011, getting the better hand on United States and China. In 2015, China regained the title and then successfully defended it in 2019.\nCompetition formula.\nThe World Cup is the most stable from all competition formulas employed by the FIVB.

After Kent State alum Tom Viggiano headed the program for the 1987–88 season, Bill Switaj was brought in once it was confirmed that the program would continue to exist beyond 1988 despite budgetary concerns. The program's entire season was cancelled that September in response to a hazing incident.\nThe Golden Flashes would finally debut with Switaj as their coach in 1989.

        "text": "American Football (also known as LP2) is the eponymous second studio album by American rock band American Football, released on October 21, 2016 through Polyvinyl. It was the band's first release since their debut self-titled album \"American Football\" in September 1999 and disbandment in 2000. In April 2014, American Football announced they would be reforming after fifteen years for a number of live performances, playing shows through the year and into 2015. In early 2016, American Football began recording the second album with Jason Cupp at ARC Studios in Omaha, Nebraska, and at SHIRK Studios in Chicago, Illinois.\nBackground.\nAmerican Football released their debut self-titled album in September 1999 through Polyvinyl. The band broke up due to the members no longer living in the same city and their college courses coming to an end. Vocalist/guitarist Mike Kinsella said that they \"never had any ambitious goals. [...] we weren't kids who wanted to [...] tour all summer.\" Kinsella and guitarist Steve Holmes both moved to Chicago and remained in contact at first. Meanwhile, drummer Steve Lamos moved to Colorado, later becoming a professor. Kinsella wanted to form a new group where he had full creative control, eventually creating the project Owen.\nIn April 2014 American Football announced they were reuniting for live performances. Holmes said the group realized that \"the time was ripe for three middle aged dudes to play some old songs about teenage feelings, and stand around tuning guitars for a long time.\" American Football, with the addition of Kinsella's cousin Nate playing bass, played a surprise show in August in Chicago. They then followed this up with playing a festival in September, then three shows in New York. Further dates running into December were also played, as well as the band's first UK shows the following May.\nThe album's cover artwork depicts the interior of the American Football House, the same house featured on the cover of the band's 1999 debut album.\nComposition.\nThe majority of the group's songs are created from Kinsella and Holmes' intertwining guitar parts. Kinsella described \"Give Me the Gun\" as \"just me checking in on a distressed loved one done in my best Bernard Sumner impersonation\".\nRecording.\nThe album was recorded in April 2016 at ARC Studios, located in Omaha, Nebraska, and SHIRK Studios, located in Chicago, Illinois. Production duties were handled by the group and Jason Cupp.\nRelease.\nOn August 23, 2016, the band's second self-titled album was announced for release. On the same day, \"I've Been So Lost for So Long\" was made available for streaming, and the album's cover art and track listing was revealed. On September 7, \"Give Me the Gun\" was made available for streaming. \"Desire Gets in the Way\" was released to radio on October 5. \"American Football\" was released on October 21 through Polyvinyl in the U.S. and through Wichita in Europe. The group performed a series of release shows in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and London. The cover of the album was the interior of the same house as featured on their eponymous debut album or best known as \"American Football house\".\nReception.\n\"American Football\" received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website \"Metacritic\" assigned a normalized score of 78/100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 19 critic reviews."

        "text": "Canada competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from February 9 to 25, 2018. It was the nation's 23rd appearance at the Winter Olympics, having competed at every Games since their inception in 1924. Canada competed in all sports disciplines, except Nordic combined. The chef de mission was Isabelle Charest, who was appointed in February 2017.\nOn January 16, 2018, figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir were announced as the country's flag bearers during the opening ceremony. This was the first time two athletes were named as Canada's opening ceremony flag bearer. On February 24, 2018, short track speed skater Kim Boutin was named the flag bearer for the closing ceremony.\nInstead of setting a specific medal count as a target, the Canadian Olympic Committee aimed \"to contend for No. 1\" in the medal count. Private data analytics company Gracenote projected that the Canadian team would win 28 medals. Canada finished with 11 gold medals and 29 overall (ranking 3rd in both categories). This was the most successful Canadian performance in terms of overall medals, surpassing the 26 won at the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nFor the first time since its official introduction at the 1998 Winter Olympics, Canada failed to medal in men's and women's curling, but did win gold in mixed doubles curling, a category making its Olympic debut.\nHistory.\nOn Day 2 of the Games, Mark McMorris won the bronze medal in the men's slopestyle. This was eleven months after the snowboarder ended up in a coma.\nPairs skater Eric Radford became the first openly gay man to win a gold medal at any Winter Olympics, as part of the Canadian team that won the team figure skating competition. A corner of Canada Olympic House was set aside as Pride House for the duration of the Olympics.\nAlex Gough won Canada's first ever permanent luge medal on February 13. She had been part of the 2014 luge relay team which briefly won a previous Olympic bronze due to a Russian doping disqualification, but that finding had been overturned on appeal.\nOn February 23, Canada broke its record for most ever Winter Olympic medals, previously at 26, with figure skater Kaetlyn Osmond winning the 27th medal.\nA day before the closing ceremony, on February 24, Canada won its 28th medal when Sebastien Toutant took gold in the first ever \"big air\" competition in snowboarding. That medal was Canada's 500th Olympic medal (not counting two medals (gold and silver) at the 1906 Olympic Games).\nCanada maintained its record for the most gold medals at a single Games—14 at Vancouver 2010—and now shares the honor with Norway and Germany, which equalled that mark at these Games.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating at the Games per sport/discipline.\nAlpine skiing.\nCanada qualified a total of 15 male and female athletes for alpine skiing.

        "title": "Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) was the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) designation of select Russian athletes permitted to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The designation was instigated following the suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee after the Russian doping scandal. This was the second time that Russian athletes had participated under the neutral Olympic flag, the first being in the Unified Team of 1992.\nDuring the 2018 Winter Olympics, two athletes from this team tested positive for banned substances and were found guilty of doping by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Both were sanctioned by the IOC and their results were annulled as a consequence of the ruling.\nBackground.\nRussian doping allegations.\nIn December 2014, German public broadcaster ARD aired a documentary which made wide-ranging allegations that Russia organized a state-run doping program which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events.\nIn May 2016, \"The New York Times\" published allegations by the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, Federal Security Service (FSB) intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games. Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that a third of the Russian medals won at Sochi were the result of doping. On 18 July 2016, an independent investigation commissioned by WADA concluded that it was shown \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the RUSADA, the Ministry of Sport, the FSB and the Centre of Sports Preparation of the National Teams of Russia had \"operated for the protection of doped Russian athletes\" within a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using \"the disappearing positive [test] methodology\". According to the McLaren Report, the Disappearing Positive Methodology operated from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\". It was used on 643 positive samples, a number that the authors consider \"only a minimum\" due to limited access to Russian records.\nOn 9 December 2016, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren published the second part of his independent report. The investigation found that from 2011 to 2015, more than 1,000 Russian competitors in various sports (including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports) benefited from the cover-up. Following the release of the McLaren report, the IOC announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games. \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation. As of late December 2017, 13 medals had been stripped and 43 Russian athletes had been disqualified for competition in 2018. The number of athletes under investigation rose to 36 (and eventually 46) in December.\nRussia has denied the existence of a doping program with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, blaming the United States for \"using the Olympics to meddle in the [2018] Russian presidential election\", that he would later win. \nOfficial sanctions.\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended from the 2018 Winter Olympics with immediate effect. Athletes who had no previous drug violations and a consistent history of drug testing were to be allowed to compete under the Olympic Flag as an \"Olympic Athlete from Russia\" (OAR). Under the terms of the decree, Russian government officials were barred from the Games, and neither the country's flag nor anthem would be present (the Olympic Flag and Olympic Anthem would be used instead). On 20 December 2017 the IOC proposed an alternative logo for the OAR athletes' uniforms (shown on right). IOC President Thomas Bach said that \"after following due process [the IOC] has issued proportional sanctions for this systematic manipulation while protecting the clean athletes\".\nAs of January 2018, the IOC had sanctioned 43 Russian athletes from the 2014 Winter Olympics and banned them from competing in the 2018 edition and all other future Olympic Games as part of the Oswald Commission. All but one of these athletes appealed against their bans to CAS. The court overturned the sanctions on 28 athletes, meaning that their Sochi medals and results were reinstated, but decided that there was sufficient evidence against eleven of the athletes to uphold their Sochi sanctions. The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". The IOC were careful to note that the CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. The court also decided that none of the 39 athletes should be banned from all future Olympic Games, but only the 2018 Games. Three of the 42 Russian athletes that originally appealed are still waiting for their hearing, which will be conducted after the 2018 Games.\nAn original pool of 500 Russian athletes was put forward for consideration for the 2018 Games and 111 were immediately removed from consideration. The remaining athletes had to meet pre-games conditions such as further pre-games tests and reanalysis from stored samples. Only if these requirements were met would the athletes be considered for invitation to the Games. None of the athletes who had been sanctioned by the Oswald Commission were still in the pool at this stage.\nThe final number of neutral Russian athletes invited to compete was 169 and, after speed skater Olga Graf dropped out, the eventual total was 168.\nReaction in Russia.\nIn the past, the Russian president Vladimir Putin and other officials had stated that it would be an embarrassment for Russia if its athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag. However, his spokesman later revealed that no boycott had actually been discussed prior to the IOC's decision. After the announcement, Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechnya, announced that none of the Chechen athletes would be permitted to participate under a neutral flag.\nOn 6 December, Putin stated that his government were prepared to allow Russian athletes to compete at the Games as individuals, but there were still calls from other Russian politicians for a boycott. Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, proposed to send fans to the Games with a Soviet Victory Banner. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, suggested that the United States \"fears honest competition\"; while Vladimir Putin was of the opinion that the United States had used its influence within the IOC to \"orchestrate the doping scandal\". He called the IOC decision an unfair \"collective punishment\", saying \"It all looks like an absolutely orchestrated and politically motivated decision. For me, there are no doubts about this.\"\nThe popular Russian newspaper \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\" reported that 86% of Russians opposed participating in the Olympics under a neutral flag, and many Russian fans attended the Games wearing the Russian colours and chanting \"Russia!\" in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban. After the games, Russian figure skater Evgenia Medvedeva revealed in an Instagram post that the Russian tricolor was hidden on the OAR medal ceremony uniforms underneath a white fur scarf buttoned on the front of the jacket.\nCriticism.\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation voiced support for allowing the full participation of \"all clean Russian athletes\" in the 2018 Winter Games, calling on the IOC to refrain from imposing \"collective punishment\".\nThe IOC's decision was heavily criticized by Jack Robertson, who was primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of WADA. Robertson argued that the IOC had issued \"a non-punitive punishment meant to save face while protecting the [IOC's] and Russia's commercial and political interests\". He also highlighted the fact that Russian whistleblowers proved beyond doubt that \"99 percent of [their] national-level teammates were doping\". According to Robertson, \"[WADA] has discovered that when a Russian athlete [reaches] the national level, he or she [has] no choice in the matter: [it is] either dope, or you're done\". He added \"There is currently no intelligence I have seen or heard about that indicates the state-sponsored doping program has ceased.\" It was also reported that Russian officials intensively lobbied US politicians in an apparent attempt to secure Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov's extradition to Russia (Rodchenkov being the main whistleblower).\nThe CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals was fiercely criticised by Olympic officials, including IOC president Thomas Bach who said the decision was \"extremely disappointing and surprising\". Whistleblower Rodchenkov's lawyer stated that \"the CAS decision would allow doped athletes to escape without punishment\", also that \"[the CAS decision] provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt Russian doping system generally, and Putin specifically\".\nFailed doping tests.\nCurler Alexander Krushelnitskiy failed his doping test after winning bronze in the mixed doubles curling as he tested positive for meldonium. This is a drug used for treating heart conditions such as angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders. It has the effect of increasing blood flow and can lead to an improvement in endurance. Meldonium was placed on WADA's list of substances banned from use by athletes two years previously. He later received a four-year suspension. Norway was subsequently awarded the bronze medal for the mixed doubles curling event.\nNadezhda Sergeeva, a bobsleigh pilot, tested positive for trimetazidine, which is also included in WADA's list of banned substances. She placed 12th in the women's competition.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors that could participate at the Games per sport/discipline.\nAlpine skiing.\nRussia has qualified three male and two female skiers.\nBiathlon.\nBased on their Nations Cup rankings in the 2016–17 Biathlon World Cup, Russia has qualified 6 men and 5 women.

In its post-Olympics World Ranking, the IIHF counted this as a result for the Russian team. The IIHF considers this victory to be Russia's second gold medal in the Olympics, as they also attributed the 1992 Unified Team gold medal to Russia. However, the IOC attributes neither of those results to Russia.\nAfter they return to Moscow, the entire Russian gold medal-winning team and other Olympic medalists participated in a Vladimir Putin's presidential rally, where they sang the Russian anthem.\nWomen's tournament.\nRussia women's national ice hockey team qualified by finishing 4th in the 2016 IIHF World Ranking.\nLuge.\nBased on the results from the World Cups during the 2017–18 Luge World Cup season, Russia qualified 8 sleds (10 athletes).

The Nashville Vols won the game and thus the pennant by .002 percentage points, after finishing the prior season in last place. Both teams had the same number of losses (56), but the New Orleans Pelicans were in first place with 76 wins to the Vols' second-place 74. Carl Sitton used his spitball to out-pitch Ted Breitenstein for a complete-game, nine-strikeout, four-hit, shutout. According to one account, \"By one run, by one point, Nashville has won the Southern League pennant, nosing New Orleans out literally by an eyelash. Saturday's game, which was the deciding one, between Nashville and New Orleans was the greatest exhibition of the national game ever seen in the south and the finish in the league race probably sets a record in baseball history\".\nNashville scored in the seventh inning with the bases loaded. With two outs, catcher Ed Hurlburt hit a single. Then Sitton did too. Harry \"Deerfoot\" Bay bunted perfectly down the third base line, Bay's fondest memory in his long baseball career. Julius Augustus \"Doc\" Wiseman then drove in the winning run. Sitton was thrown out at home after Hurlburt scored. The time of the game was one hour and forty-two minutes."

        "title": "Pulling (American football)",
        "text": "Pulling is when a blocking player in American football leaves his usual spot in order to pick up another assignment on the opposite side of the field, running behind the other offensive linemen, to sprint out in front of a running back and engage a defensive player beyond the initial width of the offensive line.\nGuards.\nThis technique is most commonly used by guards. In most playbooks, guards pull for outside runs as a lead blocker, such as a sweep play, and on counter plays, where the far-side guard pulls to block a play-side lineman. \nSince the guard is free of responsibility for play-side outside runs and far-side counter plays, pulling is generally a unique responsibility for guards.\nTackles.\nWhile tackles can also pull, this strategy is generally less common as they are too far away to pull to the opposite side of the formation (for counter plays) and have the responsibility of blocking the outside defender (generally the defensive end) for outside runs.\nHistory.\nJohn Heisman is credited with first pulling guards. Vanderbilt's Dan McGugin soon followed.\nTrap block.\nPop Warner invented the trap block with his single wing. The offensive line deliberately allows a defensive player to cross the line of scrimmage untouched, and then blocks him with a guard or tackle from the opposite side.\nPacker sweep.\nIn the 1960s, National Football League (NFL) coach Vince Lombardi of the Green Bay Packers utilized the Packers sweep play in which guards Jerry Kramer and Fuzzy Thurston rapidly pulled out from their normal positions and led blocking for the running back (typically Paul Hornung or Jim Taylor) going around the end. It was an integral part of an offense that won five NFL titles in seven years."

The tour also included five other first-class matches.\nCeylon's victory in the third unofficial Test was its first victory over a Test-playing nation. It is still Sri Lanka's only victory over India in India. Ceylon had previously beaten a Pakistan A team in Colombo in August 1964.\nThe Ceylon team.\nOf the 17 tourists, 13 (all but Devaraj, Dias, Ranjit Fernando and Idroos) appeared in the three-match series against India. India used 19 players. The Ceylon manager was Nissal Seneratne.\nThe tour.\nAfter a drawn match against Indian Universities in Madras, the Ceylon team played India in Bangalore. The strong Indian team won easily: batting first, they scored 508 for 4 (centuries to Dilip Sardesai and Hanumant Singh) before declaring and dismissing Ceylon for 205 and 257, B. S. Chandrasekhar taking five wickets in each innings.\nThe second unofficial Test followed in Hyderabad a few days later and resulted in another clear win for India. India declared at 505 for 6 (centuries to M. L. Jaisimha and Chandu Borde), dismissed Ceylon for 280 and 378, then scored 154 for 3 (a century to Farokh Engineer) to win by seven wickets. Stanley Jayasinghe, who had scored 20 and 63 (top score) in the first match, top-scored in each innings with 78 and 135 in this second match, and Michael Tissera scored 26 and 122. Ceylon then drew against Maharashtra, and lost by nine wickets in Baroda to an inexperienced Indian Board President's XI which included only one Test player.\nFor the third match in the series in Ahmedabad, India made six changes, creating a much younger team. The first day was washed out, and play did not begin until late on the second day. The pitch remained damp throughout the match. On the third day India were dismissed for 189, Jayasinghe taking 6 for 38 and Norton Fredrick 4 for 85. During the innings a ball struck Ceylon's opening batsman Trevelyan Edward, fielding in slips, over the eye, breaking his spectacles and necessitating several stitches in the wound. He could play no further part in the game, so Ceylon batted in both innings with only ten men available. At stumps on the third day Ceylon were 144 for seven. Sensing that dew would make the pitch difficult for batting on the final morning, Tissera declared at the overnight score, 45 runs in arrears, and Fredrick, Jayasinghe and Anurudda Polonowita each took three wickets in dismissing India for 66 in 26.4 overs. Ceylon reached their target of 112 in 55.2 overs, Tissera hitting the winning runs.\nThe remaining two matches, against Bombay and Madras, were drawn.\nLeading players.\nIn the three matches against India, Jayasinghe was Ceylon's outstanding player, making 318 runs at an average of 53.00, and taking nine wickets at 16.33. Tissera was the next most successful batsman, with 249 runs at 49.80, and Fredrick the next most successful bowler, with eight wickets at 27.87."

        "title": "List of AAU men's basketball champions",
        "text": "The Amateur Athletic Union Tournament is the annual American amateur basketball championship series for Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) teams. It started in 1897 and has continued until present. Most finals have been played in a single final format, apart from some occasions that the winner's tournament had been decided by a round robin format.\nLater, professional players like David Robinson, Larry Brown, and Gregg Popovich were crowned champions of the AAU. Popovich and Robinson represented the U.S. Armed Forces All-Stars. Between 1920 and 1950, some of the strongest basketball teams in the United States were sponsored by corporations, including Phillips 66, 20th Century Fox, Safeway Inc., Caterpillar Inc., and others.\nHistory.\nBy the early 1930s, a few teams had earned reputations for basketball excellence and produced AAU All-Americans such as Forrest DeBernardi, Melvin Miller and Chuck Hyatt. In 1936 the significance of the tournament soared as it became integral part of the process to select US first Olympic team. When the stakes became higher, the competition between AAU and NCAA grew more intense as each organization asserted its claim to represent the US in international competition\nBut the AAU tournaments came to rise during the 1950s and 1960s with teams like the Phillips 66ers, the Peoria Caterpillars, the Akron Goodyears, the Denver D-C Truckers and the Wichita Vickers. These teams played a full schedule each season, topping 30 games a year and traveling throughout the country. Some of them also helped introduce the American style of basketball to foreign players. In 1956, the Buchan Bakers played games in Japan, the Philippines, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Spain.\nDuring the 1950s, the rosters of the top amateur teams were filled with former college stars, many of whom had been drafted by the NBA, which was still in its formative years. The amateur teams sometimes offered more money than the pro teams as well as the security of full-time employment. AAU basketball was particularly strong in the Midwest, Southwest and West Coast, where the NBA had not yet established a presence. \nThe top teams also played in the National Industrial Basketball League, which began play in the 1947–48 season, two years before the establishment of the NBA. The NIBL had as many as eleven teams for the 1951–52 season and had nine teams during its next to last season in 1959–60. The Phillips 66ers won the NIBL title 11 of the leagues 14 years of existence.\nBut the goal for all these teams was winning the National AAU Tournament, held each year in Denver. The tournament field was determined by play in regional AAU tournaments, and included the top industrial teams, armed services teams, and often teams just put together for the tournament. Between 1943 and 1963, the Phillips 66ers won the tournament 10 times and the Peoria Caterpillars won five times. But there was always a chance for a surprise team to slip past the favorites. The Buchan Bakers, long shots at the outset of the tournament, won the national championship in 1956. Other one-time winners included the Oakland Bittners, led by Don Barksdale, in 1949 and Stewart Chevrolet, led by George Yardley, in 1951.\nThe appeal of AAU basketball began to decline in the early 1960s as the NBA gained prominence with such players as Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West. The NIBL folded in 1961, and with expansion of the NBA and the formation of the American Basketball Association in the late 1960s, the annual National AAU Tournament faded from prominence.\nAAU Champions.\n1897 New York 23 Street YMCA (1) (\"Round Robin\") \n1898 \"not held\"\n1899 New York Knickerbocker Athletic Club (1) (\"Round Robin\")\n1900 New York Knickerbocker Athletic Club (2) (\"Round Robin\")\n1901 Ravenwood YMCA (1) \n1902 \"not held\"\n1903 \"not held\"\n1904 Buffalo Germans (1) (\"Round Robin\")\n1905 Kansas City Athletic Club (1)\n1910 National Guard Co.

It was the 83rd edition of the championship, and Slovakia's Peter Sagan was the defending champion.\nSagan became the first rider since Paolo Bettini in 2006 and 2007 to retain the rainbow jersey, after winning the sprint finish from a select group of riders that had made a break from the rest of the field in the opening half of the race, in the desert crosswinds. The silver medal went to 2011 world champion Mark Cavendish from Great Britain, a bike length in arrears of Sagan, with the bronze medal going to Belgium's Tom Boonen, the 2005 world champion. It was the first time that all three medallists were previous world title winners.\nCourse.\nThe race was due to start and finish in the capital city of Doha, the home base for the Tour of Qatar. The route for the Worlds road races was presented in February 2015, which was made up of a loop of through the desert and a finishing circuit in Doha city centre, including of cobblestones. The finishing circuit of on The Pearl Island was used for a stage of February's Tour of Qatar: riders noted that the course was highly technical, going through 24 roundabouts, with stage winner Alexander Kristoff comparing it to a criterium. However it was also noted that the lack of long straight sections meant that the effect of the crosswinds frequently occurring in Qatar would be significantly lessened, reducing the race's unpredictability.\nSubsequently, in August 2016 it was reported that the UCI had made changes to the course, increasing the amount of riding through the desert to and reducing the number of laps of the finishing circuit from eleven down to seven. The start of the men's race was also moved to the Aspire Zone, with the riders heading out northwards towards Al Khor and returning to Doha.\nQualification.\nQualification was based on performances on the UCI run tours and UCI World Ranking during 2016. Results from January to the middle of August counted towards the qualification criteria on both the UCI World Ranking and the UCI Continental Circuits across the world, with the rankings being determined upon the release of the numerous rankings on 22 August 2016.\nThe following nations qualified.\nSchedule.\nAll times are in ().\nParticipating nations.\n199 cyclists from 48 nations were entered in the men's road race, with 197 riders taking the start.

The facility served as the home of London Irish with the clubs' administrative offices being based here. The professional side used the facility for training, Premiership Rugby Shield matches and pre-season friendlies. London Irish Amateur train and play all home games here.\nHistory and setting.\nHaving replaced the facility at The Avenue, the fields sit in the club's natural green-buffered 63-acre holding. The previous owner of this parcel of Metropolitan Green Belt was a golf club (supporting its driving range and nine hole-course). A remnant of its landscaping is a small, professionally-planted pondside reserve.\nFacilities.\nOverview.\nThe site has four full-size grass pitches, one full size synthetic (4G) pitch and twelve junior pitches plus a long clubhouse. The northern end of the clubhouse contains changing facilities for the amateur clubs plus a function room and conference room. The southern end of the clubhouse was used by the professional side and features their changing room, gym and administrative facilities. A shop for amateur team merchandise is within the building. With the demise of the professional side the future of the ground is unclear.\nWider training use.\nThe facilities have been built to world-class specification and are regularly used by community groups including the GAA. It was also an approved training based for the 2015 Rugby World Cup being used by Wales, Fiji, Argentina and New Zealand.\nThe New York Jets, Baltimore Ravens, New Orleans Saints, Arizona Cardinals, Philadelphia Eagles and Houston Texans NFL teams also trained here ahead of their NFL London Games in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively with New Orleans returning in 2022. London Irish reciprocated the Jets' agreement by using their facilities ahead of their premiership match in the United States in 2016.\nEvents.\nHospitality, including the bar, is open to local residents for much of the week. Fireworks annually and fundraising events are held during the year, including comedy nights. On Saturday mornings green verges around the pitches host the local Parkrun. \nCharity Matches dedicated to Matt Ratana took place here with both London Irish and Premiership Rugby sponsoring the event."

        "text": "The 43rd Ryder Cup Matches were held in the United States from September 24–26, 2021, on the Straits course at Whistling Straits, Haven, Wisconsin. Europe was the holder of the Ryder Cup after its win over the United States in 2018 at Le Golf National. \nThe United States, fielding its youngest team in its history, regained the Ryder Cup in 2021 with a record 19–9 victory. This was the largest margin of victory in a Ryder Cup since 1967. Continental Europe joined the Ryder Cup in 1979; this is Europe's heaviest defeat in Ryder Cup history. Combined with its 2016 win at Hazeltine, the United States won back-to-back Ryder Cups on home soil for the first time since 1979 and 1983.\nDue to several tournaments, including a number of majors, shifting their schedules due to the COVID-19 pandemic (including one major being canceled and one being moved to November), the Ryder Cup was originally scheduled to take place only five days after the final round of the rescheduled U.S. Open, from September 25 to 27, 2020.\nOn July 8, 2020, the PGA of America announced the postponement of the event to September 24 to 26, 2021, because of the pandemic. The next Ryder Cup was rescheduled to 2023 and further odd years, while the Presidents Cup was also rescheduled into 2022 and further even years, resetting the annual rotation of both events to how they were scheduled before the September 11 attacks in 2001.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The event took place from September 24–26, 2021 at the Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wisconsin. The event was played over three days, with four foursomes (alternate shots) and four fourball matches on the first day. The second day followed with the same matches, and the third day had twelve singles matches. The event was played between teams of twelve representing the United States and Europe. As the hosting team, the United States captain determined which matches were played during the morning session, and which were played in the afternoon.\nWith a total of 28 points available, 14 points were required to win the Cup, and 14 points were required for the defending champion to retain the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes.\nTeam selection.\nUnited States.\nThe United States qualification rules were announced on February 20, 2019. These were amended on August 5, 2020. The qualification rules are similar to those used for the 2018 Ryder Cup. The majority of the team are selected from the Ryder Cup points list, which is based on prize money won in important tournaments, with one point awarded for every $1,000 earned unless otherwise stated below. The team consists of:\nThe leading 15 players in the final points list after the final qualifying event, the BMW Championship, were:\nEurope.\nThe European team qualification rules were announced on May 8, 2019. There was one significant change from the previous Ryder Cup, with the number of captain's picks reduced from four to three. Following the postponement, points were frozen from after the Qatar Masters until January 1, 2021, with the new end date and amendments to the points multipliers expected to be announced before then. The team consisted of:\nThe leading players in the final point lists were:\nTeams.\nCaptains.\nBoth team captains were announced in early 2019; Pádraig Harrington was named as the European team captain on January 8, and Wisconsin native Steve Stricker as the U.S. team captain on February 20.\nVice-captains.\nFor the U.S. team, in October 2019, Stricker announced Jim Furyk as his first vice-captain. On May 11, 2020, Zach Johnson and Davis Love III were revealed as the next two vice-captains. On September 1, 2021, Stricker named his final two vice-captains, Phil Mickelson and Fred Couples.\nFor the European team, in September 2019, Harrington announced Robert Karlsson as his first vice-captain. In May 2020, he accidentally revealed Luke Donald as his second vice-captain during an interview. In June 2021, Harrington announced two more of his vice-captains, Martin Kaymer and Graeme McDowell. On September 15, 2021, nine days ahead of the tournament, Henrik Stenson was named as the fifth and final European vice-captain.\nPlayers.\nThe hosting United States team contained eight (of their twelve) players in the top 10 of the world rankings, while also containing eight players under the age of 30 and six rookies, the most in one team since 2008. Based on the Official World Golf Rankings prior to the event, ten of the U.S. players were ranked ahead of Europe's second-highest-ranked player (No. 14, Viktor Hovland).\nViktor Hovland (Norway) and Bernd Wiesberger (Austria) were the first players from their countries to qualify for a Ryder Cup team. Lee Westwood was the oldest player to represent the European team since Christy O'Connor Snr in 1973.\nCourse.\nThe 11th hole was converted to a par-4 for this Ryder Cup.\nEvent summary.\nFriday's matches.\nThe opening round of four foursomes matches started at 7:05 am local time. Pairings were announced at the Opening Ceremony on Thursday. The first point was won by Europe, with Jon Rahm and Sergio García winning, 3 and 1, against Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth. The first point for the United States was won by Dustin Johnson and Collin Morikawa winning, 3 and 2, against Paul Casey and Viktor Hovland. After winning the first five holes, the second American point was won by Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele by winning 5 and 3, over Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter. The final point of the session, third overall for the United States to take a 3–1 lead was won by Brooks Koepka and Daniel Berger winning, 2 and 1, against Lee Westwood and Matt Fitzpatrick.\nThe first result of the afternoon fourball matches came in the third match, which Tony Finau and Harris English won, 4 and 3, over Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, giving Team USA an overall 4–1 lead. Team USA won the second point of the session when Dustin Johnson and Xander Schauffele won, 2 and 1, against Paul Casey and Bernd Wiesberger, giving the Americans a 5–1 lead. The second overall match and third points of the session was tied between Bryson DeChambeau and Scottie Scheffler and Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton, giving the United States a 5–1 lead. In the final match, Justin Thomas and Patrick Cantlay tied their match with Tommy Fleetwood and Viktor Hovland giving the Americans 3 points to Europe's 1 point for the afternoon session. The United States ended day 1 with a 6–2 lead, the largest first-day lead for either side since the 2004 Ryder Cup.\nSaturday's matches.\nRahm and García won the opening foursomes match, 3 and 1, against Koepka and Berger, despite being three down after five holes. Johnson and Morikawa won six of the first nine holes on their way to winning 2 and 1 over Casey and Hatton. Spieth and Thomas won their first points of the week with a 2 up victory over Wiesberger and Hovland. Cantlay and Schauffele won their second match as partners, earning the Americans their third point of the session with a 2 and 1 victory against Westwood and Fitzpatrick. The United States team ended the Saturday morning session with a 9–3 lead.\nIn the afternoon fourball matches, Lowry and Hatton both earned their first full point of the week with a 1 up victory over Finau and English. Rahm and García continued their dominance as a pairing, earning their third point as partners with a 2 and 1 win against Koepka and Spieth. The third match of the day was all square through 13 holes but the American pairing of Scheffler and DeChambeau won the next four holes for a 3 and 1 victory against Fleetwood and Hovland. The final match of the day saw Johnson and Morikawa earn their third overall point as a pairing with a 4 and 3 victory against Poulter and McIlroy. With the session shared 2–2, the United States team maintained its six-point lead. The 11–5 lead was the largest lead through two days of a Ryder Cup since 1975.\nSunday's matches.\nTeam Europe won the opening singles match of the day when McIlroy defeated Schauffele, 3 and 2, however the United States team went on to win six of the next eight matches to regain the Ryder Cup. Scheffler birdied five of the first six holes and ultimately defeated the previously unbeaten Rahm, 4 and 3; Cantlay remained unbeaten for the week with a 4 and 2 victory over Lowry; and DeChambeau, having eagled the opening hole after driving the green, never trailed in his 3 and 2 win over García to take the team to 14 points. The cup winning point came when Morikawa and Hovland tied their match, bringing the overall score to 14–6.\nIn the remaining matches, Koepka defeated Wiesberger, 2 and 1; Thomas won five of the first nine holes in defeating Tyrrell Hatton, 4 and 3; Johnson made 8 birdies in his 1 up victory against Casey, going a record tying 5–0–0 on the week; team Europe earned two full points when Poulter won, 3 and 2, against Finau and Westwood won the 18th hole for a 1 up victory over English; Spieth and Fleetwood tied their match. Finally, Berger secured a 1 up victory over Fitzpatrick to give the United States team a record 19 points.\nThe United States went 7–3–2 in singles matches to defeat Europe 19–9. This was the largest margin of victory in a Ryder Cup since the United States beat Great Britain and Ireland by 10 points in 1975 (in a format in which 32 rather than 28 match points were decided).\nSource:\nIndividual player records.\nEach entry refers to the win–loss–tie record of the player.\nMedia.\nThe 2021 Ryder Cup was televised in the United States by Golf Channel, NBC and on NBC streaming site Peacock. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the event was broadcast by Sky Sports; the broadcaster re-branded its Sky Sports Golf channel as Sky Sports Ryder Cup for the week of the event. Both owned by Comcast, both the Golf Channel and Sky Sports held joint broadcasts, particularly during their morning buildup shows for each day. Highlights were also shown on BBC in the UK each night."

As a result of the plan, a recreational cycling group called the Geelong Bicycle Riders' Association was formed in 1979 and is now known as the Geelong Touring Cyclists.\nLater, the 1996 Barwon Bicycle Plan set out targets of achieving 8% of all journeys in the region by bicycle in the year 2000 and 15% by the year 2005, but this along with the Geelong Cycling Strategy 2008–2013 have failed to stop the reduction in ridership in a vehicle dominated era.\nBicycle Users Geelong was formed in 1995 by the Barwon Regional Bicycle Council.\nA Geelong Critical Mass (cycling) ride was started in 2010 and is no longer active.\nIn 2014, A Priority Bicycle Network (PBN) was adopted by the Geelong Council. Its aims being to \"elevate the importance of routes within the overall bicycle network and to prioritise works to be undertaken to improve conditions for cyclists\".\nCompetitive cycling.\nThe annual Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race is held in Geelong. The 2010 UCI Road World Championships race was held in Geelong.\nRussell Mockridge and Leigh Howard are some of Geelong's best known racing cyclists. Tour De France winner Cadel Evans has lived in Barwon Heads, Victoria - a township on the outskirts of the City of Greater Geelong municipality."

        "text": "The 2016 Super Rugby Final was played between the Hurricanes and the Lions. It was the 21st final in the Super Rugby competition's history and the first under the expanded 18-team format. The Hurricanes had qualified in first place of the log standings during the regular season, while the Lions had qualified in second place. Both teams hosted quarter-final and semi-final matches. In the quarter-finals the Hurricanes beat the Sharks while the Lions beat the record Super rugby winners Crusaders. For the semi-finals it was the Hurricanes defeating fellow New Zealand team Chiefs in Wellington and the Lions defeating New Zealand team Highlanders in Johannesburg. Because of being the higher placed team in the regular season log standings, the final was held in Wellington.\nThe Final attracted a crowd attendance of 39,000.\nRoad to the Final.\nThe 2016 Super Rugby competition involved an expanded 18-team format. The 18 teams were grouped geographically in two regional groups, each consisting of two conferences: the Australasian Group, with five teams in the Australian Conference and five teams in the New Zealand Conference and the South African Group, with six South African teams, one Argentinean team and one Japanese team split into a four-team Africa 1 Conference and a four-team Africa 2 Conference. The four conference winners qualified for the Quarter Finals, where they had home ground advantage against the four wildcard teams, made up of the third to fifth placed teams in the Australasian Group and the third placed team in the South African Group.\nIn the quarter-finals, there were wins for Highlanders over the Brumbies, Hurricanes beat Sharks while keeping them with no points, Lions beat Crusaders and Chiefs triumphing over Stormers. In the semi-finals, the Hurricanes defeated Chiefs in Wellington and the Lions defeated Highlanders in Johannesburg. The Hurricanes won their first title by defeating Lions.\nThe play-off fixtures were as follows:\nFinal.\nSummary.\nThe Hurricanes won their first Super Rugby title with a dominant 20-3 win over the Lions in Wellington with tries from Cory Jane and man-of-the-match Beauden Barrett. Victor Vito celebrated his 100th and final match for the Wellington-based side in style. Tries were difficult to get with the wet, cold and windy weather conditions with both tries scored off Lions mistakes and Barrett chipped in with 10 points from the boot with two conversions and two penalties to spark tumultuous scenes in the packed stadium. The Lions were unable to find a way to unlock the Hurricanes defence, while Elton Jantjies had a forgettable night in front of goal, scoring only one of his three kicks. The match began with Jantjies missing an early penalty and Jane had a try disallowed in the 6th minute after the TMO ruled correctly that Brad Shields had knocked-on in the build-up. The veteran winger was not to be denied for long, in the 22nd minute when the Hurricanes defence again proved its worth causing Jantjies to throw a wild pass under pressure in his own 22, forcing Lionel Mapoe to make a clearing kick, but the ball went straight to Jane, who raced in to score at the corner. Barrett slotted the conversion to add to the earlier 11th-minute penalty to give the Hurricanes a 10-0 lead. Jantjies reduced the deficit with a penalty three minutes later.\nBarrett extended his side's lead to 13-3 with another penalty midway through the second half. The match was effectively ended as a contest 11 minutes from full-time when the Lions botched a lineout clearance close to their own line. Replacement hooker Ricky Riccitelli hacked the ball on and the fly-half pounced on it inside the Lions in-goal area for his side's second try making Hurricanes to become the fifth New Zealand side to be crowned Super champions having previously lost both the 2006 and 2015 finals as well as being five times beaten semi-finalists."

        "title": "Cricket in Japan",
        "text": "Cricket is a growing sport in Japan. It was introduced to Japan by the British, with the first match played in 1863 and the first club formed in 1868, both in Yokohama. Until the 1980s, it was played almost exclusively by expatriates. The sport's governing body is the Japan Cricket Association (JCA), which was formed in 1984 and has been a member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1989, initially as an affiliate member and as an associate member since 2005.\nHistory.\nThe first cricket match in Japan was played on 25 June 1863. British merchants at the foreign settlement in Yokohama (a treaty port) challenged sailors on a Royal Navy ship to a game. The invitation was a ploy to ensure that the merchant community would be protected in the case of an ambush from local samurai, as they had been warned of a planned attack on that date. The participants in the match carried revolvers and rifles to ensure their safety, although no attack eventuated. The first cricket club in Japan was the Yokohama Cricket Club, which was formed in 1868 by a Scotsman, James Mollison.\nThroughout most of the 20th century, the only cricket played in Japan was between the expatriate communities in Yokohama and Kobe. However, in the 1980s, cricket was introduced into several universities, by Japanese students who had learnt the game in other countries. The Japan Cricket Association (JCA) was formed in 1984, and became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1989, and an affiliate member of the International Women's Cricket Council (IWCC) in 1995. The first major international tournament for the national men's team was the 1996 ACC Trophy in Malaysia, while the national women's team made its debut at the 2003 IWCC Trophy in the Netherlands. Club cricket in Japan was originally played over two days, with limited-overs league only being established in 1999.\nThe qualification for the U-19 Cricket World Cup was a major milestone for the country and their first big tournament.\nVenues.\nThe headquarters of the Japan Cricket Association (JCA) are in Sano, a city in Tochigi Prefecture, Honshu. The Sano International Cricket Ground is the primary venue for cricket in Japan, and hosts regular men's and women's international tournaments. In March 2016, plans were announced to bring the ground up to the standards required to host One Day International (ODI) matches, with the installation of floodlights, the construction of a new pavilion\n Outside of Sano, the Fujigawa Green Park Cricket Ground in Fuji, Shizuoka Prefecture, hosted the 2004 East Asia-Pacific Cricket Challenge (part of the 2007 World Cup qualifying process), which featured the national teams of Japan, Fiji, Indonesia, and Tonga.\nDemographics.\nUntil the 1980s, almost all cricket in Japan was played by foreigners. In July 2016, it was estimated that cricket was played in Japan by 3,000 people across 200 teams. \nNotable players.\nFourteen women have represented Japan in One Day International (ODI) cricket, all at the 2003 IWCC Trophy. The national men's team has not come close to reaching the same level of play.\nAt least four male first-class cricketers are known to have been born in Japan, all of whom were of British descent:"

Italy had previously won this event in 1928, tying Switzerland for second-most wins among nations. Sweden (silver) and Finland (bronze) each won their first medal in the men's coxed four. Switzerland had its three-Games silver-medal streak broken, without a Swiss crew competing.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nThere was no clear favourite for the event. No nation had won the European Rowing Championships since the previous Olympic Games more than once. Only the Soviet Union had won a European Rowing Championship medal twice since 1952. Italy had come third at the 1956 European Rowing Championships.\nNo nations made their debut in the event. The United States made its eighth appearance, most among nations to that point. Notable absences included France (previously tied with the United States for most appearances at seven) and Switzerland (which had won gold or silver in each of their six appearances).\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nThe competition venue had five lanes, but the organising committee had restricted races to four teams. This allowed for changing wind conditions, where the most affected lane could be left unused. Ten teams from ten nations attended the competition. On all days, the coxed four were the first races held of the day.\nThe competition featured four rounds (three main rounds and a repechage).\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThree heats were rowed on 23 November. Two of the heats had three teams and one had four teams, with the first two teams to qualify for the semi-final, and the remaining teams progressing to the round one repechage.\nRepechage.\nFour boats competed in the one repechage on 24 November in two heats, with the winner qualifying for the semi-final.\nSemifinals.\nTwo heats were rowed in the semi-finals on 26 November, with the top two teams qualifying for the final.\nFinal.\nFour teams reached the final, which was decided in one race held on 27 November. The team from Italy, which had won its heat and semi-final, won the final in an unremarkable race leading from start to finish."

        "text": "The 2017 SummerSlam was the 30th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on August 20, 2017, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York for the third consecutive year.\nThirteen matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. The event featured eight championship matches, the most for a SummerSlam event, where five of the titles changed hands. In the main event, Brock Lesnar defeated Braun Strowman, Roman Reigns, and Samoa Joe in a fatal four-way match to retain Raw's Universal Championship and in the penultimate match, Jinder Mahal defeated Shinsuke Nakamura to retain SmackDown's WWE Championship. In other prominent matches, AJ Styles defeated Kevin Owens to retain SmackDown's United States Championship in a match that featured Shane McMahon as the special guest referee, Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins defeated Cesaro and Sheamus to win the Raw Tag Team Championship, and Sasha Banks defeated Alexa Bliss to win her record-tying fourth Raw Women's Championship.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual professional wrestling event produced every August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. Announced on September 28, 2015, the 2017 event was the 30th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 20, 2017, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York for the third consecutive year. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions, and in addition to airing on traditional PPV worldwide, the event was available to livestream on the WWE Network. Tickets went on sale on March 25 through Ticketmaster.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised 13 matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\nOn the June 19 episode of \"Raw\", Roman Reigns proclaimed himself to be the number one contender for the Universal Championship at SummerSlam. Later that night, Braun Strowman returned and cost Reigns his match against Samoa Joe and challenged Reigns to an ambulance match at Great Balls of Fire. At the event, Strowman defeated Reigns, but Reigns retaliated by locking Strowman in the ambulance and crashing it, leaving him bloodied and injured, while Brock Lesnar defeated Joe to retain the Universal Championship. The following night on \"Raw\", as Raw General Manager Kurt Angle was about to reveal his plans for Lesnar's championship match at SummerSlam, Reigns interrupted, wanting the match. Joe then came out, wanting a rematch. Reigns and Joe were then scheduled for a number one contender match. During the match, Strowman returned and attacked both Reigns and Joe, resulting in a no contest. It was then decided that Lesnar would defend the title against Reigns, Joe, and Strowman in a fatal four-way match at SummerSlam. The following week, Heyman proclaimed that if Lesnar were to lose the Universal Championship at SummerSlam, then he and Lesnar would leave WWE.\nAt Battleground, Natalya won a fatal five-way elimination match to become the number one contender for Naomi's SmackDown Women's Championship at SummerSlam.\nAt Great Balls of Fire, Sasha Banks defeated Alexa Bliss by count-out, thus Bliss retained the Raw Women's Championship. Over the next couple of weeks, Bayley scored pins over Bliss in a tag team match, and a non-title singles match. Bayley in turn felt she deserved a title shot, while Banks felt she deserved a rematch due to Bliss' actions at Great Balls of Fire. A number one contender's match between the two the following week was won by Bayley. Bayley then suffered a legitimate shoulder injury, incurred during a match with Nia Jax, forcing her to relinquish her number one contender's spot. Two triple threat matches were then scheduled for the following episode of \"Raw\" with the winner of each facing each other to determine the new number one contender for the Raw Women's Championship. Banks won the first triple threat match by defeating Alicia Fox and Emma, while Jax won the second by defeating Dana Brooke and Mickie James. The following week, Banks defeated Jax to become the new number one contender against Bliss at SummerSlam.\nAt Battleground, Jinder Mahal defeated Randy Orton in a Punjabi Prison match to retain the WWE Championship with help from The Singh Brothers and the return of The Great Khali. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Mahal demanded a new opponent for SummerSlam. John Cena came out, congratulated Mahal, and then challenged him for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam. However, SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan said Cena had to earn his opportunity and scheduled a number one contender's match between Cena and Shinsuke Nakamura. The following week, Nakamura defeated Cena to become the number one contender for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam.\nOn the Great Balls of Fire Kickoff pre-show, Neville defeated Akira Tozawa to retain the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. On the July 31 episode of \"Raw\", a number one contender's match was scheduled between Tozawa and Ariya Daivari for the following night's \"205 Live\" with the winner facing Neville for the Cruiserweight Championship at SummerSlam. On \"205 Live\", Tozawa defeated Daivari to become the number one contender. On the August 14 episode of \"Raw\", Tozawa received his title match early and defeated Neville to become the new Cruiserweight Champion, and their originally scheduled SummerSlam match was made a rematch with Neville as the challenger. On August 16, WWE confirmed that the match would take place on the SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show.\nAt Battleground, Kevin Owens defeated AJ Styles to win his third United States Championship. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Styles wanted to invoke his championship rematch, but he was interrupted by the returning Chris Jericho, who also wanted to invoke his rematch from when he lost the title to Owens back in May. As both Styles and Jericho were contractually owed rematches, SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon decided that they would both get their rematches for the title in a triple threat match that night against Owens, where Styles pinned Jericho to regain the title.

On the July 31 episode of \"Raw\", Rollins was confronted by Cesaro and Sheamus and later won a match against Sheamus. After the match, Cesaro and Sheamus attacked Rollins before Ambrose came down to make the save. Backstage, Ambrose told Rollins that he would not help him if Rollins got outnumbered again.

Jordan said that he did not want preferential treatment, and The Miz made some irritable comments about Angle. The Miz then took a swing at Jordan, but Jordan ducked and suplexed Miz into his Miztourage (Curtis Axel and Bo Dallas). On the August 14 episode of \"Raw\", Jordan defeated The Miz by disqualification after the Miztourage attacked Jordan; The Hardy Boyz (Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy) then ran out to even the odds by assisting Jordan in fending off the Miztourage. This led to a six-man tag team match later that night between The Miz and The Miztourage against The Hardy Boyz and Jordan, where the latter won.

        "title": "2016–17 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2016–17 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2016–17 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Hoyas, led by 13th-year head coach John Thompson III, played their home games at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., and were members of the Big East Conference.\nThe season saw the return of Jonathan Wallace, the Hoyas′ standout point guard from 2004 to 2008, to the basketball program as a special assistant after eight seasons playing professional basketball in the NBA Summer League, the National Basketball Association Developmental League, Belgium, Germany, and Angola.\nThe Hoyas finished the season at 14–18, 5–13 in Big East play, to finish in ninth place in the conference. As the No. 9 seed in the Big East tournament, they lost in the first round to St. John's. Georgetown finished the season with a losing record for the second straight year, the first time that had happened since the 1972 and 1973 seasons, and without an invitation to a postseason tournament in consecutive years for the first time since 1972 and 1973.\nOn March 23, 2017, Georgetown officials announced that John Thompson III had been fired. On April 2, it was reported that Basketball Hall of Famer and Georgetown alumnus Patrick Ewing would replace Thompson as head coach.\nPrevious season.\nThe Hoyas finished the 2015–16 season 15–18, 7–11 in Big East play to finish in eighth place. They defeated DePaul in the first round of the Big East tournament to advance to the quarterfinals where they lost to Villanova. For the first time in John Thompson III's twelve years as head coach, the Hoyas did not make a postseason tournament.\nPreseason.\nPrior to the season, Georgetown was picked to finish in a tie for fourth place in a poll of Big East coaches. Isaac Copeland was named to the preseason All-Big East second team and L. J. Peak received an Honorable Mention.\nSeason recap.\nGeorgetown had lost three players since the conclusion of the previous season. Little-used walk-on senior guard Riyan Williams – the son of Georgetown great Reggie Williams – had graduated with a year of college eligibility remaining and chose to transfer to NCAA Division II Goldey-Beacom College to play his final year of college basketball, and sophomore forward Paul White, the team's leading scorer off the bench during his freshman year but limited by a hip injury to seven games during the 2015–2016 season, had transferred to Oregon at the end of August 2016. By far the team's biggest loss, however, was guard D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera, whose graduation in 2016 left the Hoyas without their leading scorer of the past three seasons. Although a natural shooting guard who finished his college career as Georgetown's fifth-leading all-time scorer and with more three-pointers made than any previous Hoya, Smith-Rivera had also served as the team's point guard for the past two seasons, and the team keenly felt the loss of both his scoring ability and his in-game leadership.\nAt forward, senior Reggie Cameron, juniors Isaac Copeland, Trey Mourning, and L. J. Peak, and sophomores Marcus Derrickson and Kaleb Johnson all returned for 2016–2017. Junior guard Tre Campbell and sophomore center Jesse Govan also came back for another season. Forward Akoy Agau, who had transferred from Louisville in January 2015 and had planned to begin play for Georgetown in January 2016 after sitting out the two full semesters the National Collegiate Athletic Association mandated for transferring players, had missed the entire 2015–2016 season while recovering from knee surgery, but he finally would make his Georgetown debut in 2016–2017 as a redshirt junior. A surprise returnee from the previous season was fifth-year senior center Bradley Hayes; he was due to graduate in 2016, and virtually everyone, including Hayes himself, believed as the 2015–2016 season came to an end that his college career was over. However, John Thompson III applied for an NCAA waiver that would allow Hayes to return for a fifth year as a redshirt senior in 2016–2017 because he had played in only nine games and for only 14 minutes during his freshman year and had a semester to go to complete his degree. The NCAA granted the waiver, provided that Hayes sat out the first four games of the 2016–2017 season. The team's former student manager, junior guard Ra'Mond Hines, who had made the team for the first time as a walk-on late the previous season, also returned to the team for 2016–2017, again as a walk-on.\nTwo freshmen joined the team, guard Jagan Moseley and walk-on forward George Muresan, the son of former National Basketball Association center Gheorghe Muresan. Also arriving for the year were two upperclassmen. Guard Rodney Pryor had transferred from Robert Morris and was eligible to play for Georgetown immediately as a redshirt senior because he had graduated from Robert Morris the previous spring. Junior guard Jonathan Mulmore, a junior college transfer from Allegany College of Maryland, also joined the team.\nThe 2016–2017 squad's athleticism raised the prospect of Georgetown playing a more uptempo game than had been the custom during the 12 previous seasons under John Thompson III, who favored the more deliberate \"Princeton offense\"; during the offseason, Thompson had revamped his coaching staff and discussed at length the idea of adopting his system to accommodate a new style of play, promising a faster team. Although the shadow of the losing season the previous year hung over the returning players, the 2016–2017 season began with qualified optimism because of the number of experienced players on the roster and Georgetown's size relative to other teams in the Big East, which had lost a number of notable \"big men\" over the offseason. At least some observers considered Georgetown's frontcourt a strength and deemed it unlikely that Georgetown would suffer through another uncharacteristically mediocre season because of the Hoyas′ pattern of recurring success over many years and quick recoveries from the occasional poor seasons. But the Hoyas faced a particularly challenging early nonconference schedule, and the departure of Smith-Rivera left questions as to how well the backcourt would perform and who would step up to lead the team.\nNonconference schedule.\nGeorgetown began its season by defeating South Carolina Upstate in a game at the Verizon Center in which the Hoyas started only one player (Isaac Copeland) who had started their final game of the previous season. Georgetown displayed a very different style of play from that seen previously under John Thompson III, with frequent presses and more running, and won 105–60. It was Georgetown's greatest offensive output since the Hoyas scored 111 points against Missouri in an overtime victory on November 30, 2010, the fifth time the Hoyas had scored 100 or more points in a game during John Thompson III's 13 seasons as head coach, and the third-highest scoring output of Thompson's tenure. It was the highest-scoring season opener under Thompson, the first 100-plus-point season opener for Georgetown since they beat NCAA Division III Marymount 108–47 to start the 2001–2002 season, and the first time the Hoyas had scored 100 points or more in a season opener against an NCAA Division I opponent since defeating Colgate 106-57 to begin the 1995–1996 season. Making his Hoya debut, Rodney Pryor sank a career-high six three-pointers on eight attempts from beyond the arc. and shot 13-of-16 (81.3 percent) from the field overall on the way to a 32-point game. Pryor scored 26 points in the first half alone, and the 68 points the Hoyas scored by halftime set a school record for first-half points, eclipsing the 57 points they scored in the first half against Savannah State on December 8, 2008, and it was the highest-scoring half for Georgetown in the 21st century to that point. Overall, the Hoyas shot 66.7 percent from the field, and L. J. Peak scored 14 points against the Spartans, Jesse Govan had 11, Isaac Copeland scored 10, and Tre Campbell came off the bench to add 10.\nThree days later, Georgetown took part in the annual Gavitt Tipoff Games, a series of eight games per year between teams of the Big East Conference and Big Ten Conference. For the second straight year, Georgetown drew Maryland as its Big Ten opponent, hosting the Terrapins at the Verizon Center – the first time the Hoyas had hosted the Terrapins since 1993. The Hoyas made 37 of their 42 free throws but blew a 68–59 lead with 2:21 remaining as Maryland went on a 17–7 scoring run the rest of the way to win the game, 76–75, defeating Georgetown for the second season in a row. Maryland's players stormed the court to celebrate the victory. Scoring 21 points, L. J. Peak led a balanced Georgetown attack which also saw Rodney Pryor score 14 points, Isaac Copeland finish with a double-double (13 points and 13 rebounds), and Jesse Govan add 12 points.\nNext up for the Hoyas was the Maui Invitational Tournament. Georgetown began the tournament by hosting a non-bracketed opening-round game against Arkansas State at McDonough Gymnasium, the Hoyas′ first game on campus since the 2014 National Invitation Tournament. The Hoyas shot only 3-for-18 (16.7 percent) from three-point range and, despite Jesse Govan's 20 points, L. J. Peak's 18, and Isaac Copeland's 11, the Red Wolves led by double figures for much of the game and held off a 22-7 late-game Georgetown rally to upset the Hoyas 78–72. Thanks to the surprising loss, Georgetown opened its season with a 1–2 record for the second straight year.\nFour days later, the Hoyas were in Hawaii at the Lahaina Civic Center in Lahaina, Maui, to open the bracketed championship round of the tournament with a quarterfinal match-up against their first ranked opponent of the year, No. 13 Oregon. The Ducks struggled against a strong Hoya defense and did not score a field goal for the first six minutes, shooting 7-for-29 (24.1 percent) from the field in the first half. Rodney Pryor, meanwhile, led Georgetown through Oregon's pressure defense during the half, and his buzzer-beating three-pointer gave the Hoyas a 38–21 halftime lead. In the second half, however, the Ducks′ pressure defense was far more effective, and it allowed them to force turnovers and make easy transition baskets. While Georgetown missed its first 12 shots of the second half, Oregon opened the half with a 22–4 scoring run that gave the Ducks a 43–42 lead. The Hoyas then staged a 10–2 scoring run of their own to pull out to a 52–45 lead with three minutes to play. Oregon responded with a late run and, with 3.8 seconds remaining, closed to a 63–61 deficit on a long three-pointer by junior forward Dillon Brooks, but L. J. Peak hit two free throws with 2.7 seconds to play to secure a 65–61 upset Georgetown victory. Pryor had a double-double with 26 points and 10 rebounds, and Peak finished with 17 points. The Hoyas evened their record at 2–2, but had begun to show a tendency toward inconsistent play during their first four games, sometimes playing dominating basketball and then struggling mightily during other stretches of their games.\nThe Hoyas advanced to the semifinals the next day to meet another ranked opponent, No. 16 Wisconsin, which had defeated Tennessee in the quarterfinals the previous day. The Hoyas never really found their shooting touch, but they held their own in the first half and Wisconsin clung to a 32–29 lead at halftime. During the second half, however, the Badgers opened with a scoring run that gave them a 44–34 lead, and by midway through the half led 53–39 on their way to a 73–57 victory. During the game, Wisconsin shot only 5-for-22 (22.7 percent) from three-point range, but rebounding proved to be the game's decisive factor: Wisconsin had a 19-1 advantage in offensive rebounds and scored 20 second-chance points, and overall the Badgers outrebounded the Hoyas 50-21 and outscored Georgetown 38–16 in the paint. The Hoyas′ poor performance on the boards prompted John Thompson III to observe during his post-game comments, \"We have to get some guys that understand that it′s not just about points and minutes, and care about all aspects of the game.\" L. J. Peak led the Hoyas with 18 points and Rodney Pryor finished with 14. For the second straight season, the Hoyas opened with a 2–3 record.\nThe loss to Wisconsin relegated the Hoyas to the third-place game, in which they faced Oklahoma State the next day. Oklahoma State had beaten UConn in the quarterfinals, but then suffered a one-sided defeat at the hands of No. 4 North Carolina in the semifinals. The Cowboys began the game with a sluggish and lackluster effort that led Oklahoma State head coach Brad Underwood to call an early time out, slam down his clipboard, berate his team, and replace four starters with bench players. Underwood's admonishment and the lineup change sparked much greater energy among his players, who presented the Hoyas with a strong pressure defense the rest of the way. This time, turnovers were the decisive factor: The Hoyas fell victim to sloppy ball-handling, and Oklahoma State forced 14 turnovers – 11 of them steals – in the first half alone and led 50–35 at the half. For the game overall, Georgetown shot 51 percent from the field, but Oklahoma State scored 41 points off 28 turnovers, including 19 steals, and had a 59–16 advantage in points off the bench. Rodney Pryor scored 15 points and Bradley Hayes 13, and Akoy Agau scored in double figures for the first time as a Hoya, finishing with 11 points, but the Cowboys won 97–70. Georgetown finished in fourth place in the tournament and fell to 2–4 on the season. It was Georgetown's worst start since the 1971–1972 team opened 1–5 on its way to a 3–23 final record.\nThe Hoyas returned to the Verizon Center to sweep a three-game homestand, defeating Howard, Coppin State, and Elon; the Elon game, by far the closest of the three, was a part of the annual BB&amp;T Classic, in which Georgetown made both its third consecutive appearance and third appearance overall and improved its all-time record in the Classic to 3–0. Rodney Pryor led the Hoyas in all three games; he scored 26 points against Howard and 30 points against Coppin State, tying his career high with seven three-pointers, and he finished with 23 points against Elon. L. J. Peak scored 14 points against Howard and had a career-high 10 assists against Coppin State – the first Georgetown player to have double-digit assists since Markel Starks had 11 on March 3, 2014. Peak followed that performance with a 22-point game against Elon. Akoy Agau scored 14 against Howard, a new high for him as a Hoya, and Tre Campbell finished with 12 points in the Howard game. Bradley Hayes had 10 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and three blocked shots against Coppin State, while Jessie Govan grabbed a career-best 11 rebounds in the Coppin State game and scored 13 points against Elon. Against Coppin State, the Hoyas shot 45.2 percent from three-point range, making a season-high 14 three-pointers on 31 attempts.\nSix days after beating Elon, Georgetown traveled to Miami to meet La Salle – a team Georgetown had played only twice since 1965 – in the Hoophall Miami Invitational. The Hoyas broke a tie and ran away from the Explorers with a late run in the final 8:44 to win, improving their all-time record against La Salle to 10–15 and extending their winning streak to four, as L. J. Peak scored 24 points Rodney Pryor 19, Jesse Govan 18, and Jagan Moseley scored in double figures for the first time as a Hoya with 14 points, while Marcus Derrickson contributed nine points and eight rebounds.\nOn December 12, two days after the La Salle game, John Thompson III announced that Isaac Copeland had decided to transfer to Nebraska at the end of the semester. Copeland gave no reason for leaving Georgetown, but the arrival of Rodney Pryor and increased playing time for reserves Marcus Derrickson and Kaleb Johnson as well as his own declining performance and injuries had led to reduced playing time for him.\nAfter another week off following the La Salle game, the Hoyas journeyed to the Carrier Dome to face Syracuse – their archrival throughout the 34-season history of the original Big East Conference of 1979–2013 – on a snowy day on which Syracuse honored former Orange great Dwayne \"Pearl\" Washington, who had died of cancer in April 2016. Syracuse jumped out to an 11–4 lead, its largest of the game, in the first 5:08, but Georgetown came back and L. J. Peak sank a basket to tie the game at 31–31 with two minutes left until the intermission, in part thanks to Peak's 12 first-half points. The game was tied 33–33 at halftime, but Georgetown pulled ahead to its largest lead of the game, 67–60, with only 2:36 left to play. The Orange closed to 69–66 with 1:04 left, but the Hoyas hit nine free throws in the final 38 seconds to come away with a 78–71 victory, their sixth over the Orange in the last eight meetings. Peak had a double-double with 23 points and 11 rebounds and Rodney Pryor scored 20 points. Georgetown, which entered the game averaging 28.5 trips to the free-throw line per game and shooting 77.5 percent in free throws, went 22-of-25 from the free-throw line, while Syracuse made only 14 of its 25 free throw attempts. The Hoyas improved their all-time record against Syracuse to 43–49, their all-time road record against Syracuse to 13–30, and their record against the Orange under John Thompson III to 11–7.\nGeorgetown closed out the nonconference portion of its season by returning to the Verizon Center to defeat UNC Greensboro in a game in which Jesse Govan went 9-for-13 (69.2 percent) from the field, including 2-for-2 in three-pointers, and had 20 points, nine rebounds, five assists, and four blocks, while L. J. Peak contributed 16 points, Marcus Derrickson scored 15 points, and Rodney Pryor added 12. The Hoyas had won five straight to enter the Big East season with a record of 8–4.\nConference schedule.\nThe Hoyas opened the Big East season with a loss at Marquette, in which Rodney Pryor finished with 23 points, Jesse Govan scored 11, and Marcus Derrickson came off the bench for 11. They then came home to host their third ranked opponent of the year, No. 17 Xavier, at the Verizon Center on New Year's Eve 2016. Xavier was one of four Big East teams ranked in the Top 17 at the time. Peak scored 16 points in the first half, and the underdog Hoyas led 38–36 at halftime and pulled out to a six-point lead early in the second half. Xavier came back to tie the game at 54–54, but Peak completed a three-point play – scoring his last points of the game – to put Georgetown ahead 57–54 with 11:41 left to play. Xavier increasingly used a 1-3-1 zone defense as the second half progressed, and this gave the Musketeers greater defensive success against the Hoyas. Xavier took the lead for good at 62–59 with 8:23 remaining during a 13-5 scoring run that gave the Musketeers their largest lead of the game, 74–62, with 3:58 left to play. Rodney Pryor led a Georgetown comeback by scoring 10 points in a row, but his potential game-tying three-pointer missed with Xavier leading 77–74 and 24 seconds remaining. Although Georgetown held Xavier to 39 percent shooting from the field, and rendered Xavier's leading scorer, junior guard Trevon Bluiett, ineffective throughout the game, Musketeer redshirt sophomore guard Edmond Sumner, playing on his birthday, scored a career-high 28 points. From the free-throw line, Xavier went 29-for-38 (76.3 percent) with Sumner alone going 14-for-17 (82.4 percent), while Georgetown as a team shot 14-for-23 (60.9 percent) from the line. Georgetown shot 50 percent from the field, and Peak finished with a team-high 21 points, Pryor with 20, and Derrickson with 12, but Xavier held on to win, 81–76. Georgetown had its first 0–2 start in Big East play since the 2012–2013 season.\nA visit to Providence four days later to play the first game of 2017 resulted in a third loss and Georgetown's first 0-3 start in conference play since the 1999-2000 season. Marcus Derrickson had a career-high 26 points, Rodney Pryor scored 16, and Akoy Agau had his first career double-double with 12 points and a career-best 12 rebounds, but Georgetown remained winless on the road against the Friars since February 18, 2012. The Hoyas then hosted their second ranked conference opponent of the season, No. 18 Butler, which three days earlier had upset No. 1 Villanova. Georgetown led 32–31 at halftime. With a minute left to play, the Hoyas held a 66–63 lead, but Butler sophomore center Nate Fowler's three-pointer tied the game at 66–66 with 58 seconds to play. Jagan Moseley hit two free throws with 38 seconds on the clock to give the Hoyas a 68–66 lead, but Fowler's two free throws with eight seconds left again tied the game at 68–68. Georgetown had a chance to avoid overtime and pull off an upset, but L. J. Peak's attempt at a buzzer-beating turnaround jumper as time expired in regulation bounced off the rim. Butler never trailed in overtime and took the lead for good with 3:04 to play on two free throws by redshirt senior guard Kethan Savage. The Bulldogs won, 85–76, their third consecutive victory over the Hoyas. The Hoyas outscored the Bulldogs 40–20 in the paint and Butler shot only 39.1 percent from the field, but the Bulldogs stayed in the game on 10-of-20 shooting from three-point range. Peak scored a team-high 21 points, Jagan Moseley contributed a career-best 20, Marcus Derrickson contributed 14 points, and Bradley Hayes narrowly missed a double-double with 10 points and nine rebounds, but Rodney Pryor, the Big East's scoring co-leader entering the game, averaging 19.8 points, went scoreless on 0-for-8 shooting against a spirited defensive effort by Butler freshman guard Kamar Baldwin, who also scored a career-high 16 points for the Bulldogs. Georgetown saw its record fall to 8–8 and opened its conference season 0–4 for the first time since the 1998-1999 season, and, along with DePaul, was one of two teams still winless in the Big East.\nTwo days after the loss to Butler, Georgetown's four-game homestand continued with its first conference win, a runaway victory over St. John's – the Hoyas′ twelfth straight home win over the Red Storm – with L. J. Peak scoring 16 points that included a 10-for-10 free-throw shooting performance, Rodney Pryor and Jagan Moseley each scoring 13 points, and Marcus Derrickson adding 11. A break from conference action followed, as UConn visited the Verizon Center to conclude a home-and-home series begun the previous season. The Hoyas and Huskies were charter members of the original Big East Conference in 1979 and had met each season throughout that conference's 34-year history, but the rivalry had lapsed when Georgetown left the conference in the summer of 2013 to join the new Big East Conference while UConn remained behind in the old conference, renamed the American Athletic Conference and marketed as \"the American;\" the two-season home-and-home series revived play between the teams after a two-season absence. UConn had won the previous year, but this time the Hoyas overcame a 14-point second-half deficit to beat the Huskies and improve their all-time record against UConn to 36–30. L. J. Peak scored 21 points, 16 of them in the second half, Jesse Govan came off the bench to finish with 15, and Rodney Pryor had 14. Georgetown's two-game winning streak and four-game homestand both came to an end two days later, when Providence visited Georgetown and won easily to sweep the regular-season series between the teams and stretch its winning streak against the Hoyas to six. Peak scored 13 points and Pryor 12, but the Hoyas as a team shot only 18-for-55 (32.7 percent) from the field and only 5-for-23 (21.7 percent) from three-point range against the Friars.\nWith a conference record of 1–5 and an overall record of 10–9, Georgetown began a stretch of three straight games in seven days against ranked conference opponents. First they visited No. 22 Xavier. The Musketeers entered the game having lost three games in a row, all against ranked Big East teams, their longest losing streak in three years. Xavier clung to a 34–33 lead at halftime, but pulled out to a 12-point advantage in the second half. The Hoyas came back to tie the game at 58–58, but Xavier then went on a decisive 12–3 scoring run to take a 70–61 lead. Rodney Pryor scored 23 points and L. J. Peak finished with 12, but fouling and rebounding undid the Hoyas; the Musketeers repeatedly drew fouls by driving the basket and went 36-for-49 from the free-throw line, while the Hoyas made 11 out of 14 free throws. Xavier won 86–75, handing Georgetown its sixth loss in seven games and dropping the Hoyas to 10–10 on the season and 1–6 in the Big East. In play against ranked teams, Georgetown had lost four straight games and nine of its last ten.\nGeorgetown next returned to the Verizon Center to host No. 16 Creighton. The Bluejays were the second-best shooting team in NCAA Division I at 52.8 percent from the field, and tenth in three-point shooting at 40.8 percent, but had suffered a major loss when a season-ending knee injury sidelined their point guard, senior Maurice Watson Jr., nine days earlier during a game against Xavier. Jonathan Mulmore made his first start as a Hoya. Rodney Pryor had an outstanding first half in which he dunked several times, sank two of his three three-pointers, and scored 15 points. Thanks in part to a 13–2 scoring run, Georgetown led 39–27 at the half. The Hoyas extended their lead to as many as 22 points in the second half and never led by fewer than 14 points during the last 15:32 of the game. Georgetown cruised to a 71–51 upset victory. Creighton shot only 34.5 percent from the field and only 1-for-18 (5.6 percent) from three-point range, and it was the Bluejays′ lowest-scoring game of the season. Georgetown outrebounded Creighton 47–36. L. J. Peak scored 20 points, Pryor finished with 18, and Jesse Govan added 15. The win was Georgetown's first conference victory over any team other than DePaul and St. John's – perennially the two teams at the bottom of the conference's standings – since a win over Creighton on January 26, 2016, and it improved Georgetown's conference record to 2–6, allowing the Hoyas to avoid their first 1–7 conference start since the 1998-1999 season.\nThe Hoyas traveled to Indianapolis to face No. 11 Butler in their next game. Butler – winner of four straight games overall and 14 straight at home, including 11–0 thus far in the 2016–2017 season – led 41–40 at halftime. During one stretch in the second half, Rodney Pryor, despite playing with four fouls, scored 11 straight points, nine of them on three straight contested three-pointers, giving Georgetown a 72–65 lead. The Bulldogs then closed the gap, scoring seven straight points to tie the game at 72–72. The Hoyas led 79–77 with 1:03 to play when Jesse Govan hit a long, unexpected three-pointer – only the third three-pointer he had ever made in Big East play – to give Georgetown an 82–77 lead. The Bulldogs never had another chance to tie or take the lead, and Georgetown won 85–81. During the three-year tenure of Butler head coach Chris Holtmann, the Bulldogs had won all 30 previous games in which they had scored 80 or more points. The Hoyas shot 63.8 percent from the field for the game and 72.7 percent in the second half. L. J. Peak scored 22 points and Pryor 20, while Govan went 8-for-9 from the field overall and 3-for-3 in three-pointers and tied his season high by finishing with 20 points.\nThe back-to-back wins over Creighton and Butler gave the Hoyas a 3–3 record against ranked teams for the season and, with a weaker part of their schedule coming up, raised hopes that the team could turn its season around after a difficult start over the first three months. The Hoyas concluded January by winning their third game in a row, defeating DePaul in a close one at the Verizon Center thanks largely to L. J. Peak scoring five points in the final minute and Jesse Govan blocking a shot with 40 seconds to play. Rodney Pryor scored a game-high 26 points, Govan finished with 14, and Peak contributed 13. The victory was Georgetown's 20th over DePaul in the last 21 meetings between the teams and improved Georgetown's record to 13–10 overall, 4–6 in the Big East, but the Hoyas were destined to win only one more game all season.\nThe team's February collapse began with an overtime loss to Seton Hall at the Verizon Center on February 4 in which L. J. Peak scored 18 points, Rodney Pryor had 13, and Marcus Derrickson finished with nine points and eight rebounds. On February 6, as the Hoyas headed north through Howard County, Maryland, on Interstate 95 on their way to Pennsylvania to play No. 2 Villanova, their team bus struck the rear of a sport-utility vehicle, causing the SUV to veer off the highway and overturn. The team and its staff got off the bus to assist the two occupants of the SUV, who were taken to a hospital, then boarded another bus to finish their journey. No one aboard the bus requested medical attention, but when the Hoyas met Villanova at The Pavilion the following afternoon, Tre Campbell sat out with a banged knee and John Thompson III was observed hobbling along the sideline in apparent pain. The Wildcats missed six of their first seven three-point attempts, but then Villanova senior guard Josh Hart sparked an offensive surge by hitting three three-pointers and scoring 17 first-half points; Villanova took a 17-point first-half lead and still led 43–28 at halftime. In the second half, Hart fell silent on offense and the Hoyas made a comeback bid, mounting a 17–4 scoring run that cut a Wildcat 17-point lead to 60–58 with 3:49 left to play. With Georgetown threatening an upset, Hart regained his form on offense, hitting two clutch shots, a three-pointer and a layup, to give the Wildcats a 70–61 lead. Hart finished with a game-high 25 points and Villanova won 75–64 for its 48th straight victory at The Pavilion. Peak scored 21 points and Pryor had 20 points and nine rebounds, but the back-to-back losses dropped Georgetown to 13–12 overall and 4–8 in the Big East.\nAfter a safer and much less eventful return trip to Washington, the Hoyas beat Marquette at the Verizon Center. Georgetown shot 53.7 percent from the field as a team, and no fewer than three Hoyas scored 20 points or more: Jesse Govan, Rodney Pryor, and L. J. Peak combined for 23-of-42 (54.7 percent) shooting, and Govan had a game-high 23 points along with eight rebounds, Pryor finished with a double-double (20 points and 10 rebounds), and Peak scored 20 points, including the 1,000th point of his collegiate career. Third in the United States in three-point shooting at 42.4 percent, the Golden Eagles managed only 3-of-14 (21.4 percent) from beyond the arc against Georgetown. It was Georgetown's last win of the season and the 278th and final win of John Thompson III's 13-year tenure as Georgetown's head coach.\nAfter an eight-day break in action, Georgetown went back on the road for its eighth game of the season against a ranked opponent, facing No. 20 Creighton. Led by redshirt junior guard Marcus Foster – who sank four three-pointers and scored a game-high 35 points – the Bluejays shot 53 percent from the field compared to only 38.5 percent for the Hoyas, who managed only a 3-for-22 (13.6 percent) performance from three-point range. Creighton led 41–33 at halftime and went on a 19–6 scoring run in the second half to take a 60–44 lead. The Hoyas appeared to be mounting a comeback, closing to 66–55, when their shooting went cold and they went scoreless for the next minutes as Creighton cruised to an 87–70 win. L. J. Peak scored a team-high 23 points, Rodney Pryor finished with 16, and Jesse Govan had 12, while Akoy Agau had nine points, nine rebounds, and three blocked shots, but also five turnovers. The Hoyas entered the game as one of the Big East's best defensive teams, but the 87 points the Bluejays scored were the second-most Georgetown had given up all season, and Creighton posted the third-highest shooting percentage of any team that had faced the Hoyas during the season.\nThree more losses followed in a game at the Verizon Center against DePaul and road games against St. John's and Seton Hall. The DePaul game broke a 10-game losing streak for the Blue Demons and a six-game Georgetown winning streak against DePaul, and it was only the second time in the last 22 meetings between the schools that DePaul had beaten Georgetown. Rodney Pryor scored 14 points against DePaul, had 22 points including five three-pointers against St. John's, and finished with 11 against Seton Hall. In the DePaul game, Jesse Govan had 18 points and Marcus Derrickson had 11. L. J. Peak scored 20 points against St. John's and 15 against Seton Hall. Against St. John's, Jesse Govan scored 13 and Kaleb Johnson added 11.\nThe Hoyas closed out the regular season by hosting No. 2 Villanova at the Verizon Center. Villanova led 38–28 at halftime, but Georgetown cut the Wildcats′ lead to four points, 39–35, with 16:42 remaining in the game. Villanova was shooting only 34.8 percent from the field, on pace for a season low, and holding a 46–39 lead with 11:50 remaining in the game when the Wildcat shooters began to find the range. With a little over seven minutes remaining, Wildcat senior guard Josh Hart hit two consecutive three-pointers to give Villanova a decisive 60–45 lead, and the game degenerated into a rout from there, as Villanova scored on 15 of 17 possessions and made 12 of its final 16 shots – improving its shooting percentage from the field to 46.3 percent for the game – on the way to an 81–55 win. Rodney Pryor led Georgetown with 21 points; he was the only Georgetown player to score in double figures, and the Hoyas committed 20 turnovers. It was Villanova's fifth straight win against Georgetown, the longest winning streak ever in the rivalry between the schools.\nGeorgetown's regular season ended with a five-game losing streak and losses in seven of its final eight games, and the Hoyas posted a regular-season record of 14–17 overall and 5–13 in the Big East, good for a ninth-place conference finish. It was the team's worst conference record since a 4–12 finish in the original Big East in the 2003–2004 season, and its worst conference finish since it finished in 11th place in the original Big East in 2008–2009. In reporting the results of the final game against Villanova, the Associated Press referred to \"the disaster of Thompson′s 13th season on the Hilltop [i.e., at Georgetown],\" and when a reporter tried to ask John Thompson III questions about the future of the Georgetown men's basketball program as it faced a likely second consecutive losing season, a team spokesman interrupted, saying \"Leave it to game-related questions, please.\"\nBig East tournament.\nWith a No. 9 seed in the 2017 Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden, Georgetown faced eighth-seeded St. John's in the first round. Both schools were charter members of the original Big East Conference when it was created in 1979, and it was their seventh meeting in the tournament since it began in 1980. Former Georgetown head coach John Thompson Jr., and former Georgetown great Allen Iverson, both members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, attended the game. In the original Big East's heyday in the mid-1980s, when St. John's head coach Chris Mullin had played for the Red Storm and John Thompson III's father, John Thompson Jr., had coached the Hoyas, the two schools had been national powers and great rivals, and both teams entered the game aware of this history. St. John's made only five of its first 21 shots from the field, but led 38–34 at halftime, and also led for most of the second half. With 8:35 left to play and St. John's ahead 59–55, the game briefly took on the character of the very physical games of the original Big East in the 1980s when Red Storm junior forward Amar Alibegović fouled L. J. Peak hard under the basket and a shoving match ensued between several players, resulting in the officials calling a flagrant foul against Alibegović and technical fouls against both Chris Mullin and Georgetown assistant coach Patrick Ewing Jr., a former Georgetown player whose father, Patrick Ewing, had played against Mullin as Georgetown's center at the peak of the 1980s rivalry between the teams. After the scuffle, Peak made one free throw to cut the Red Storm's lead to 59–56. After that, the Hoyas got within one point of St. John's three times but could never take the lead. The Red Storm led 74–68 with three minutes to play, but did not score again. In Georgetown's final possession, which began with 6.6 seconds remaining and St. John's clinging to a 74–73 lead, both Peak and Marcus Derrickson missed close-in shots, allowing St. John's to hang on for a 74–73 win. Georgetown's season came to an end, while St. John's snapped a six-year losing streak in the Big East tournament and moved on to face Villanova in the quarterfinals the following day. The Red Storm finished shooting 37.7 percent from the field overall, including 5-for-20 (25 percent) from three-point range, while the Hoyas shot 45.8 percent from the field overall and made five of their 21 three-point shots (23.8 percent). Playing in their last game for Georgetown, Peak scored a game-high 24 points, 22 of them in the second half, and Rodney Pryor contributed 17. Derrickson scored 11 points.\nWith a record of 14–18 and having lost their last six games and eight of their last nine, Georgetown received no invitation to either the NCAA tournament or the National Invitation Tournament for the second straight year. It was the first time Georgetown had two consecutive losing seasons since 1971–1972 and 1972–1973, and the first time the Hoyas had received an invitation to neither the NCAA Tournament or the NIT in two consecutive seasons since 1973 and 1974. For the second straight season, the Hoyas never made the Top 25 in either the Associated Press Poll or the Coaches Poll – the first time that had happened in consecutive seasons since 2002-2003 and 2003-2004.\nJohn Thompson III fired.\nThe failure of the 2016–2017 team, coming on the heels of a similar failure the previous season, left the Georgetown basketball program in turmoil. In his 13 years at Georgetown, John Thompson III had an overall record of 278–151, with 11 winning seasons, eight appearances in the NCAA Tournament and three in the NIT. Since the notorious loss to 15th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast in the 2013 NCAA tournament, however, Georgetown had endured the worst four-year stretch of his tenure as head coach. Those four years coincided with the first four seasons of the new Big East Conference; it consisted of a group of schools brought in from mid-major conferences combined with some of the less-competitive teams from the original Big East, and the Hoyas and their fans had expected the team to dominate the new conference as its flagship program. Instead, over those four years the Hoyas had posted an overall record of 69–62, and their 32–40 Big East record was third-worst in the conference; the Hoyas had no regular-season or conference-tournament championships in the new Big East, had missed the NCAA Tournament in three of the new conference's four seasons, had lost in the second game of their lone NCAA appearance – as well as in the second game of their only NIT appearance – and had finished with two consecutive losing seasons in which they had no postseason play whatsoever. For the second year in a row, the team had an up-and-down early season and collapsed in February; the 2016-2017 season ended with six consecutive losses, including to DePaul and St. John's – both long the cellar-dwellers of the Big East – and the team's 14-18 record was the worst for Georgetown since the 1971-1972 team's dismal 3–23 finish. Although Thompson emphasized defense, the Hoyas′ defense had been mediocre over its four years in the new Big East, never ranking higher than 110th among the 351 NCAA Division I teams in defensive efficiency, and the 2016–2017 squad's defense statistics were poor: 116th in the defensive efficiency and 302nd in fouls committed, while allowing opponents 10 offensive rebounds per game. On offense, the Hoyas had gone five seasons without ever ranking in the top 50 teams in offensive efficiency, and in three seasons had ranked worse than 100th.\nBy late February, signs began to appear in the student section at the Verizon Center and on the road at Madison Square Garden reading \"Fire Thompson\" and \"Degioia Do Your Job\" – a plea for Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia to fire Thompson – and cheers of \"Fire Thompson!\" became common from the stands. In early March, Georgetown students launched a petition demanding that the university fire Thompson; it garnered 1,700 signatures by mid-March. Adding fuel to the fire, Thompson's attempt to address Georgetown's lack of a true point guard since the graduation of Markel Starks in 2014 by recruiting Tremont Waters, an elite point guard prospect, for the following season failed when Waters requested his release from Georgetown on March 11, highlighting to the fan base how much of its star power the Georgetown program had lost since its 2007 Final Four appearance. More negative publicity arose when school financial disclosures revealed that Thompson had received annual pay increases from 2008 to through 2014, resulting in a salary of $3.6 million a year that likely made him one of the ten most highly compensated college basketball coaches in the United States. Amid a rising chorus of criticism by Georgetown students and alumni of Thompson's performance, and press articles by students and ESPN describing dissatisfaction among Georgetown students and alumni with the direction of the men's basketball program, Georgetown University announced on March 23 that it had fired Thompson, bringing his 13-year tenure as head coach to an end.\nWhen Thompson arrived at Georgetown to take charge of the program in 2004, he inherited a team that had finished with a losing record the previous season. Also inheriting his predecessor Craig Esherick′s last recruiting class, which included point guard Jonathan Wallace and two future NBA players, forward Jeff Green and center Roy Hibbert, and himself recruiting DaJuan Summers, he had led the Hoyas back to the NCAA Tournament, reaching the Sweet Sixteen in 2006 and the Final Four in 2007 in his third season with the Hoyas. Over the next eight seasons, Georgetown made six NCAA Tournament appearances, but won only three NCAA tournament games, never advancing beyond the Round of 32 and losing in each case to lower-seeded teams, all but one of them double-digit seeds. The loss in 2008, to 10th-seeded Davidson, was shocking at the time but in retrospect was understandable, given that Davidson was led by future NBA great Stephen Curry. However, it was the harbinger of what turned out to be a gradual, decade-long slide into mediocrity. The later losses – to 14th-seeded Ohio in 2010, to 11th-seeded VCU in 2011, to 11th-seeded North Carolina State in 2012, and above all to 15th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast in 2013, as well as to fifth-seeded Utah in 2015 – had no such straightforward explanation.\nWhile the team that centered around the 2011 recruiting class's Greg Whittington and Otto Porter Jr. showed signs of potential greatness, it never reached the heights of the 2006–2007 Final Four team, and after Porter departed for the NBA in 2013 after his sophomore season, Thompson's recruiting efforts paid fewer and fewer dividends. Thompson remained committed to his \"Princeton offense\" despite its growing obsolescence in the face of the evolution of the college game, and his adherence to it harmed his recruiting efforts, as potential recruits sought opportunities elsewhere under systems that better fit their playing style and showcased the athletic abilities that NBA scouts favored. Washington, D.C., and its suburbs remained a hotbed of high-school basketball talent, but Thompson had markedly less success in recruiting Washington-area players than his predecessors John Thompson Jr. and Craig Esherick; observers noted that Villanova had built the dominant team and perennial winner in the new Big East Conference – a team that made deep runs annually in the NCAA Tournament and won the national championship in 2016 – at least partially by recruiting two star players from Washington's Maryland suburbs, guards Josh Hart from Silver Spring and Kris Jenkins from Upper Marlboro; both had grown up as Hoya fans, but Thompson lost out to Villanova head coach Jay Wright in recruiting Hart and never pursued Jenkins. Under Thompson, the program had a high number of players transfer to other schools, finding that under Thompson they had too little playing time and few opportunities to showcase their athleticism.\nThe dismissal of both Greg Whittington and Joshua Smith from the 2013–14 team could explain that team's failure, but Thompson's declining success in recruiting players who fit into his system and who would develop successfully at the college level began to affect the program's success. The highly touted 2014 recruiting class – which included Tre Campbell, Trey Mourning, L. J. Peak, and Paul White – despite some success in its first season, also was notable for is lack of development on the court. Only Peak showed progress as a junior, and only Mourning remained at Georgetown for a full four years of collegiate eligibility. The glory years of Georgetown's men's basketball program had become too distant to resonate with potential recruits, and without NBA-caliber talent after Porter's departure, the once-proud Georgetown program had gone from a perennial national power to consistently mediocre performances that culminated in two straight losing seasons and declining fan interest and attendance at home games; for two straight years, Georgetown had struggled to fill even half the seats for its home games at the Verizon Center.\nPatrick Ewing hired.\nRather than fire Thompson soon after the Hoyas′ season ended, Georgetown waited until two weeks later to announce his termination, by which time some top options for the head coaching position already had accepted offers elsewhere. Georgetown athletic director Lee Reed and Paul Tagliabue, a former Georgetown player and one-time commissioner of the National Football League, led the effort to find a new head coach, but observers came to the conclusion that the university had no plan in place for who it wanted to succeed Thompson before it fired him, making the school's search for a successor appear bumbling. Notre Dame's Mike Brey, Xavier's Chris Mack, and Texas's Shaka Smart all rebuffed Georgetown's inquiries, and Harvard′s Tommy Amaker privately expressed disinterest in the job because of his concerns over internal politics at Georgetown, fearing that the influence that John Thompson III's father, John Thompson Jr., still wielded over the program despite having resigned as head coach in January 1999 could lead to a negative political environment for any new head coach. Georgetown informed recently fired Indiana head coach Tom Crean that he was not a candidate, but the names of Providence's Ed Cooley – who made clear that he had no desire to leave Providence – Rhode Island's Danny Hurley, Minnesota's Richard Pitino, Duke assistant coach Jeff Capel, USC's Andy Enfield, South Carolina's Frank Martin, and Charlotte Hornets assistant coach and Georgetown alumnus Patrick Ewing all were mentioned in the swirl of media speculation that followed Thompson's firing.\nOn April 3, 2017, Georgetown announced that it had hired Patrick Ewing as its next head basketball coach. Generally regarded as the greatest player in Georgetown history, Ewing had been Georgetown's star center from 1981 to 1985, leading the Hoyas to three appearances in the NCAA Tournament championship game and the 1984 national championship, then going on to a Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame NBA career as a player from 1985 to 2002 and as an assistant coach from 2002 to 2017. It was Ewing's first head coaching job at any level of basketball, and it marked his first foray into college basketball since his graduation from Georgetown in 1985.\nWrap-up.\nRodney Pryor completed his only season as a Hoya as the team's leading scorer for the year; he started all 32 games, shooting 48.0 percent from the field overall and 41.2 percent in three-pointers, averaging a team-high 18.0 points and leading the team with 5.0 rebounds per game. L. J. Peak also started all 32 games, and he averaged 16.3 points and 3.8 rebounds per game, shooting 48.1 percent from the field overall and 32.7 percent from three-point range. Jesse Govan played in every game, starting 21 of them, shooting 53.0 percent in field-goal attempts and 40.0 percent from three-point range, and he averaged 10.1 points and 5.0 rebounds per game. Marcus Derrickson played in 28 games and started 17 of them, averaging 8.3 points per game on 43.2 percent field-goal shooting overall and 34.4 percent from three-point range, and he had 4.4 rebounds per game. In his only season in action with the Hoyas, Akoy Agau appeared in all 32 games and started eight of them; he ended the season with a field-goal percentage of 50.6 and with per-game averages of 4.5 points and 4.3 rebounds. Bradley Hayes appeared in 25 games, starting 11 of them, and he finished with 4.2 points and 4.0 rebounds per game, shooting 53.4 percent from the field. Jagan Moseley started 20 of the 31 games he played in, and he averaged 4.2 points per game on 45.0 percent shooting from the field – 24.3 percent from beyond the arc – and grabbed 2.2 rebounds per game. Playing in all 32 games, Jonathan Mulmore had 12 starts and averaged 3.6 points and 1.4 rebounds per game, shooting 35.7 percent overall and 34.5 percent in three-pointers. Tre Campbell averaged 3.5 points and 1.2 rebounds in the 20 games he played in, all off the bench, and shot 38.7 percent from the field overall and 34.3 percent from three-point range, while Kaleb Johnson started twice in his 30 appearances, shooting 44.2 percent from the field overall and 25.0 percent in three-pointers, averaging 2.3 points per game and pulling down an average of 1.3 rebounds per game. Reggie Cameron played in 17 games, all off the bench, averaging 1.7 points and 0.9 rebound, and Trey Mourning played in only 10 games, all as a reserve, averaging 0.8 point per game. Before his mid-season transfer, Isaac Copeland played in seven games, started five, and averaged 5.5 points and 3.3 rebounds per game, shooting 27.5 percent from the field. Walk-ons Ra'Mond Hines and George Muresan each played in five games.\nRodney Pryor, Bradley Hayes, and Reggie Cameron all graduated in 2017. In addition to his lone year at Georgetown, Pryor played for Robert Morris in 2014–2015 and 2015–2016, and in his three-season college career he appeared in 96 games, starting 84, shooting 46.5 percent overall from the field and 38.1 percent from three-point range and averaging 17.1 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. Hayes played parts of five seasons for Georgetown; an afterthought for the first three, he had his breakout game against Eastern Washington in the 2015 NCAA tournament, and he made his greatest contributions to the team over the next two seasons. He finished his career having played in 94 games, starting 38 of them, shooting 53.4 percent from the field and averaging 4.0 points and 3.4 rebounds per game. Cameron appeared in 104 games in his four years at Georgetown, starting 18 of them, and finished his college career with a 37.4 shooting percentage from the field overall and 32.6 percent from three-point range, averaging 3.4 points and 1.3 rebounds per game.\nA number of other players also left the team after the season. L. J. Peak announced on March 21 – two days before the university fired Thompson – that he had decided to forego his senior year of college and enter the 2017 NBA draft; Peak completed his three-season college career with 98 games played, including 76 starts, averaging 12.1 points and 3.1 rebounds per game and shooting 46.1 percent from the field, 33.5 percent from three-point range. He went undrafted, but played professionally outside the NBA. Isaac Copeland, who had transferred to Nebraska in mid-season, received word that the NCAA had granted him a medical hardship waiver that would permit him to begin play for the Cornhuskers at the beginning of the 2017–2018 season after sitting out only one semester. In his seasons as a Hoya, Copeland had appeared in 73 games and started 49, shooting 50.0 percent from the field and 29.1 percent from beyond the arc, averaging 8.6 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. Akoy Agau, after finishing his only season of action with the Hoyas, announced on May 27 that he would transfer to SMU, where, as a graduate transfer, he would be eligible to begin play immediately in the 2017–2018 season. In early August 2017, Georgetown announced that Tre Campbell, amid rumors that he would miss the 2017–2018 season due to injuries he sustained in the February 2017 bus accident and other injuries he suffered during the 2017 offseason, would remain on scholarship but had been released from the basketball program for personal reasons. He completed his three seasons on the team having played in 84 games, starting 21 of them, averaging 3.7 points per game on 34.7 percent shooting from the field overall and 31.7 percent in three-pointers, and he grabbed 1.4 rebounds per game. Campbell remained at school at Georgetown, sitting out the 2017-2018 basketball season and graduating in 2018, and with a year of college eligibility remaining after his graduation, announced on May 8, 2018, that he would transfer to South Carolina where, as a graduate transfer, he would be eligible to begin play immediately in the 2018-2019 season. Rumors arose in mid-March that junior Trey Mourning, after limited playing time in three seasons as a Hoya and spending the last two games of the season on the sideline wearing a suit, would transfer from Georgetown, although in June the news broke that Mourning would return to Georgetown for his senior year after all.\nAt the end of the season, and with a new coach, the Hoyas faced an uncertain future. The failure of most of John Thompson III's recent recruiting efforts and the loss of the team's top scorers left Georgetown with what \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Pete Thamel described as a \"program [that] is already buzz-less, lacking an on-court identity,\" and with \"a roster so devoid of talent it would make 1980s Hoyas weep.\" Ewing was untested as a head coach and lacked familiarity with modern college basketball, and his hiring was viewed as a great gamble that had a high potential payoff if he quickly learned how to navigate the complexities of college recruiting and player development. As one of his first steps, Ewing attempted to re-recruit Tremont Waters, but Waters ultimately spurned his efforts, and in June he committed to LSU instead. Georgetown's program was in decline, and Waters's decision demonstrated how little attraction it held for nationally prominent recruits, The Hoyas were relying on Ewing to lay a foundation for it to return to national greatness.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| Big East tournament"

        "text": "In team sports, the term home advantage – also called home ground, home field, home court, or home ice advantage – describes the benefit that the home team is said to gain over the visiting team. This benefit has been attributed to psychological effects supporting fans have on the competitors or referees; to psychological or physiological advantages of playing near home in familiar; to the disadvantages away teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and, in some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly.\nCricket is the most popular sport in Sri Lanka. The country has eight grounds that have been used to host international cricket matches. CCC ground hosted only Test matches, and Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium hosted only ODI matches. Besides them, Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium hosted only ODIs and T20Is up to date. Five grounds hosted all three forms of the game. \nIn cricket, hosts have the home advantage in playing international cricket. They can prepare the grounds for their suitability and according to the abilities of their players. Therefore each cricketing nation play well in their home grounds than other international venues. This home advantage can be very serious in major international tours such as ICC Cricket World Cup, ICC World Twenty20, ICC Champions Trophy and Asia Cup, which is a real boost to win the tournament. The record of Sri Lanka in their home grounds is no such difference. They have played more games and won more games in their home soil.\nRecord by Sri Lanka.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium in Pyeongchang, South Korea on 9 February 2018. It began at 20:00 KST and finished at approximately 22:20 KST. The Games were officially opened by President of the Republic of Korea Moon Jae-in.\nPreparations.\nThe site of the opening ceremony, Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium, was built specifically for the Games. The pentagonal stadium seated 35,000. The organizers for the event said the shape was chosen because it is a combination of different traditonal shapes - a circle, a square, and a triangle, which represent heaven, earth, and mankind. No Olympic or Paralympic events were held at the stadium, which was only used for the opening and closing ceremonies. The venue was torn down afterwards.\nThe broadcast of the Opening Ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games was available in more than 200 countries around the world.\nCeremony.\nThe ceremony's message centered on peace, passion, harmony, and convergence.\nFive children from rural Gangwon province led the ceremony, and were used to symbolize the five Olympic rings, with their names being chosen to represent fire, water, wood, metal, and earth, the five elements that are believed to make up the Earth.\nAugmented reality and 5G technology were also incorporated in the event. The largest drone show in history, featuring 1,218 Shooting Star drones, was planned for the ceremony but cancelled at the last minute; television audiences were shown a version that had been recorded the previous December.\nDuring the opening ceremony the organizing committee was a victim of a cyber attack, but without major consequences.\nProgramme.\nCountdown.\nThe ceremony began with a short film set in Incheon International Airport and across South Korea, depicting the posters of the previous editions of the Games. When the video arrived at the Sangwon Temple, the feed cut to a live shot of the stage, with a recreation of The Bell of Sangwon Temple standing in the centre. The countdown then took place around the bell.\nThe Land of Peace.\nA video introducing the five children from rural Gangwon was shown. In the video, they are shown entering a cave, and are guided out by a white tiger, with the feed once again transitioning to a live shot of the five children with the tiger inside the stadium. As they crossed the stage, a depiction of the Baekdudaegan mountain range was projected onto it.\nThey were joined by performers handling puppets resembling the flora and fauna of Gangwon Province, as well as the four guardians - the white tiger, a blue dragon, a vermillion bird, and a black tortoise. As the segment progressed, an Inmyeonjo appeared on center stage representing peace.\nThe segment ended as an augmented reality constellation dome rose over the stage.\nEntrance of the President of the Republic of Korea.\nMoon Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea, and Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee were introduced.\nTaeguk: Harmony of the Cosmos.\nWhite light then illuminated the stadium as 371 \"janggu\" players performed on stage. They performed a \"janggu\" dance, and the segment culminated with the performers changing their costumes from white to red and blue, taking the form of the \"Taeguk\".\nKorean National Flag and Anthem.\nWith the formation of the \"Taeguk\" on stage, the National Flag entered the stadium, carried by notable Korean athletes. As they carried the flag across the stadium, they were joined in the stadium by the Traditional Guard of Honour and the Royal Marching Band, who performed \"chitwa\" music, or traditonal marching music.\nThe flag was then raised, with The Rainbow Choir, consisting of 75 children from multicultural families, performing the National Anthem.\nParade of Nations.\nThe Parade of Nations was led, according to custom due to hosting the original ancient Olympics, by the Greek team, followed by other competing countries in alphabetical order based on their names in the Korean language, with the host country, South Korea, concluding the march.\nThe delegations from both the host nation South Korea and North Korea (Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics) marched under the Korean unification flag. South Korean Won Yun-jong and North Korean Hwang Chung-gum both held the flagpole.\nDespite the cold temperatures, Bermuda's delegation wore shorts and Tongan Pita Taufatofua repeated his shirtless and oiled up Summer Olympic appearance.\nBackground music for the parade began with an instrumental version of \"Hand in Hand\" by Koreana and included modern remixes of Korean songs from throughout the ages from \"Short Hair\" by Cho Yong-pil and \"The Beauty\" by Shin Jung Hyun &amp; Yup Juns of the 1970s, as well as the following modern K-pop hits: \"Gangnam Style\" by Psy, \"Likey\" by Twice, \"Fantastic Baby\" by Big Bang, \"DNA\" by BTS, and \"Red Flavor\" by Red Velvet.\nArirang: The River of Time.\nThe segment began with an older man singing \"Jeongseon Arirang\" as the five children rode a raft across the stage. A storm descended, however the buckwheat flowers that were being projected onto the stage remained strong, evoking the \"Miracle of the Hangang River\" and representing the resilience of Koreans.\nDuring the segment, an intruder entered the stage, standing behind the singer before being escorted away by security.\nAll For The Future.\nA video depicting the dreams and futures of the five children opened the segment. Back in the stadium, performers handling \"Gates to the Future\" performed a choreography invoking South Korea's status as an IT powerhouse, as well as the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\nThe segment culminated with the raising of the Media Link in the center of the stage, and the word \"future\" projected onto it in different languages.\nOpening Speeches.\nLee Hee-beom, President &amp; CEO of the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic &amp; Paralympic Winter Games made an opening welcome speech to the athletes of the world in Korean. This was followed by Thomas Bach, IOC President who made an address as well. Bach then invited the President of the Republic of Korea Moon Jae-in to declare open the XXIII Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang in Korean.\nPeace in Motion.\nThe five children were joined by families from across Gangwon Province, who one by one, lit each other's candles. During this, four Korean singers - Ha Hyun-woo of the band Guckkasten, Ahn Ji-young of the musical duo Bolbbalgan4, Lee Eun-mi and Jeon In-kwon with his band Deulgukhwa performed John Lennon's Imagine, with the feed occasionally cutting to footage of street musicians from across the world having joined in the performance.\nAt the conclusion of the song, the five children released a dove shaped balloon, and the feed again transitioned to a prerecorded video. The video depicted snowboarders descending Alpensia, and the formation of the Olympic Rings by 1,218 drones, a world record at the time.\nThe drones would later be used during the victory ceremonies, cultural performances, and the closing ceremony.\nThe Olympic Flag, Anthem, and Oaths.\nEight flagbearers consisting of Olympic medalists and young athletes brought the Olympic Flag into the stadium. The flag was then raised as Hwang Su-mi performed the Olympic Anthem.\nThe Olympic Oaths were then taken.\nLighting of the Olympic Flame.\nFollowing a short montage recapping the torch relay, the Olympic torch was carried into the stadium by Chun Lee-kyung, four time Olympic champion in short-track speed skating. She passed the torch to Park Inbee, Olympic champion in golf. She in turn passed it to Ahn Jung-hwan, a football player notable for representing South Korea at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He passed it to Jong Su-hyon from North Korea and Park Jong-ah from South Korea, both representing the unified Korean ice hockey team, who carried the torch and headed up stairs toward the cauldron.\nAs the torch neared the cauldron, an ice skating rink with South Korean figure skater Yuna Kim was revealed. Yuna Kim is the well-known figure skater who won gold medal in 2010 and silver medal in 2014. The cauldron was designed to represent a full moon when it is not lit. Kim received the torch and lit the cauldron.\nWish Fire.\nThe final segment featured Korean dance group Just Jerk (who became known internationally for their participation in the twelfth season of \"America's Got Talent\") entered the stage dressed as Dokkaebi, and performers with sparklers on roller blades. This segment in total featured 2,000 fireworks within and out of the stadium, some reaching as high as .\nHacking of computer systems.\nOn 24 February, \"The Washington Post\" reported that U.S. intelligence uncovered Russian spies hacked computers during the Opening Ceremony. Analysts believed the Russians instigated the 9 February attack as a way to retaliate for the International Olympic Committee's decision to restrict the participation of Russian athletes in the 2018 Winter Olympics as punishment for doping violations.\nSandworm, a Russian cybermilitary unit of the GRU, is believed to be responsible for the attack. The worm used is known as \"Olympic Destroyer\". It targeted all Olympic IT infrastructure, and succeeded in taking down WiFi, feeds to jumbotrons, ticketing systems, and other Olympic systems. It was timed to go off at the start of the opening ceremonies. It was unique in that the hackers attempted to use many false signatures to blame other countries such as North Korea and China.\nDignitaries in attendance.\nAbout 25 heads of state attended the ceremony, in addition to the UN Secretary General. President of Russia Vladimir Putin was invited to attend, but declined due to the symbolic ban on Russia by the IOC.\nDignitaries from abroad.\nOn 9 February 2018, Kim Yo-jong—sister of Kim Jong-un—attended the ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea. This was a first time that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea since the Korean War. Kim Yo-jong shook hands with South Korean president Moon Jae-in before sitting down to watch the ceremony together."

The flag bearers from each participating country entered the stadium informally in single file, ordered by \"ganada\" order of the Korean alphabet, and behind them marched all the athletes. Marching alongside the athletes were Soohorang, the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic mascot, and Hodori, mascot of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.\nHandover of the Olympic flag.\nFirst, the Greek flag was raised while its anthem played. The Olympic flag was then lowered and passed by the mayor of Pyeongchang County, Shiim Jae-kook, to IOC President Thomas Bach, who then handed it over to the mayor of Beijing, Chen Jining. This was then followed by the raising of the flag of China, and the playing of its anthem. The flag was raised again in Tokyo, Japan for the 2020 Summer Olympics on 23 July 2021 for the opening ceremony.\nSee You in Beijing 2022.\nBeijing, the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, presented a special performance \"See You in Beijing in 2022\" directed by Chinese film director Zhang Yimou, who also presented the 2008 Summer Olympics opening and closing ceremonies. The presentation featured a modern image of China with two pandas skating and people forming red lines that became a dragon, as pandas and dragons are national icons for China. The skaters also trail lines to form the emblem of the Games. China's Paramount leader Xi Jinping made a cameo appearance by video expressing the welcome message on behalf of the Chinese people.\nGames declared closed.\nIOC President Thomas Bach formally closed the games, calling them 'The Games of New Horizons'. Soon after, the cauldron was extinguished."

The games featured 102 events in 15 sports, making it the first Winter Olympics to surpass 100 medal events. Four new disciplines in existing sports were introduced to the Winter Olympic program in Pyeongchang, including big air snowboarding, mixed doubles curling, mass start speed skating, and mixed team alpine skiing.\nThe Netherlands achieved a podium sweep in speed skating, in the women's 3,000 metres. Norway achieved a podium sweep in cross-country skiing, in the men's 30 km skiathlon. Germany achieved a podium sweep in nordic combined, in the individual large hill/10 km. At the 2018 Winter Olympics, athletes were tied in three events. In the women's 10 km cross-country skiing, two bronze medals were awarded due to a tie. In the two-man bobsleigh, two gold medals and no silver medal were awarded due to a tie. In the four-man bobsleigh, two silver medals and no bronze medal were awarded due to a tie.\nGoing in, Canada held the record for most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics with 14, which it won in Vancouver in 2010. This mark was equalled by both Norway and Germany at these Olympics. Norway set the record for most total medals at a single Winter Olympics with 39, surpassing the 37 medals of the United States won at the 2010 Winter Olympics. The mark of 30 NOCs winning medals is the highest for any Winter Olympic Games. Hungary won its first Winter Olympic gold medal ever. Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen (two gold, one silver, and two bronze) achieved five medals, more than any other athlete. With 15 medals, she became the most decorated athlete in Winter Olympics history. Swedish cross-country skier Charlotte Kalla finished with four medals (one gold, three silver), as did her compatriot and fellow cross-country skier Stina Nilsson (one gold, two silvers, one bronze) and Russian cross-country skier Alexander Bolshunov (three silver, one bronze) who was competing for the Olympic Athletes from Russia. Norwegian cross-country skier Johannes Høsflot Klæbo and French biathlete Martin Fourcade tied for the most gold medals, with three each. Ester Ledecká of the Czech Republic became the first female Winter Olympian to achieve a gold medal in two separate sports at a single Games, winning in both alpine skiing and snowboarding.\nMedal table.\nThe medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If there is still a tie after that, then the nations shared the tied rank and are listed alphabetically according to their NOC code.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

As the originator of the Olympics, the Greek team entered first. Other teams entered in alphabetical order based on the names of countries in the Korean language.

However, following solidarity negotiations with North Korea, the host nation was instead represented by the unified Korean delegation, consisting of the South Korean and North Korean teams, marching under the Korean Unification Flag.\nThe names of the nations were announced in French, followed by English and Korean, the official languages of the Olympic movement and the host nation, in accordance with traditional and International Olympic Committee (IOC) guidelines. Background music included such Korean songs from throughout the ages from as old as the folk song Arirang, to \"Short Hair\" by Cho Yong-pil and \"The Beauty\" by Shin Jung Hyun &amp; Yup Juns of the 1970s, and modern K-pop hits such as \"Gangnam Style\" by Psy, \"Likey\" by Twice, \"Fantastic Baby\" by Big Bang, \"DNA\" by BTS, and \"Red Flavor\" by Red Velvet.\nList.\nBelow is a list of parading countries and their announced flag bearer, in the same order as the parade.

        "title": "1972–73 Serie A (basketball)",
        "text": "The 1972–73 Serie A basketball championship was the 50th season of the Serie A, the highest professional basketball league in Italy.\nThe regular season ran from 22 October 1972 to 22 April 1973, an expanded league saw fourteen teams play 26 games each. As Ignis Varese and Simmenthal Milano ended joint first with an equal head-to-head record, a single playoff game decided the title for the third year running.\nVarese won the game, played in Bologna, to reclaim the title from Milano, earning their sixth overall title (and a spot in the European Champions Cup).\nPreseason.\nPerennial powerhouses Simmenthal Milano and Ignis Varese were seen as even-matched overwhelming favourites to fight for the title, which Milano had won the previous season following a title playoff game against Ignis.\nAspiring team Forst Cantù, on the back of a good season that had seen them beat Ignis away, were touted as a possible third powerhouse that could join the title fight.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, promoted sides Gamma Varese and Brill Cagliari were the favourites to go back down, with Gorena Padova and Partenope Napoli to possibly join them in the relegation fight. \nThe most important squad change saw American Bob Morse replace star Mexican Manuel Raga as Ignis' sole foreigner in the league (they were both allowed to play in European competition) with his adaptation or lack of crucial to their title chances. \nThough they had lost substitute Tony Gennari to Splügen Venezia, the Nikolić coached team had otherwise kept their major Italians such as Dino Meneghin.\nSimmenthal, coached by Cesare Rubini, trusted their all-action American Art Kenney and their young Italians such as Giulio Iellini and Renzo Bariviera, whilst the form of an ageing Massimo Masini could prove important.\nThe upstarts from Cantù meanwhile, counted on the combination of American center Bob Lienhard with promising Italians Pierluigi Marzorati and Carlo Recalcati, whilst Mobilquattro Milano made an important signing in Chuck Jura.\nLeague regulations called for all clubs to play in arenas holding at least 3,500 spectators but four clubs (Cantù, Padova, Venezia and Saclà Asti) were given exemptions for the season though their arenas fell short of requirements (Asti's arena hosting only 700 for example).\nRegular season.\nThe three favourites initially comfortably raced into a shared lead, this changed with Simmenthal's upset in the fifth round to mid-table Splügen Venezia led by American Steve Hawes and Gennari. \nThe Milanese would recover however, decisively downing Cantù 87-76 in the first clash between the three top sides on 10 December, using the same starting five (Kenney, Iellini, Masini, Bariviera and Giuseppe Brumatti) for 40 minutes to stifle their opponents' scoring.\nAfter Ignis also downed Cantù, the title chase reverted to the usual two-horse race between them and Simmenthal, with a clash in Milan on 14 January 1973.\nThe home-side eked out a close 76-72 to go level on points with Ignis.\nIn a game of two halves – with an entertaining first half (42-40) and a scrappy second one – Simmenthal won the game on the back of good performances both in attack and defense from Barivera (23 points), Masini and a diminished Kenney (both 14 points).\nIgnis, meanwhile, relied too heavily on the selfish Morse – leading the league in scoring – who scored 29 points (on 14 for 23 shooting) but played his teammates ouf of the game.\nThe next rounds saw the status quo remain, with the most notable event being an Ignis' 25-point victory over Simmenthal, though this time in the European Champions Cup first semi-final in early March.\nIgnis played modest Brill Cagliari (before last in the league) in between the two semi-finals, with fatigue and lack of focus certainly playing a part in the surprising 75-76 defeat to the Sardinians that saw Simmenthal overtake them and move into first place by two points.\nAfter both beat Cantù anew, the title was to be decided once again by the return match between the powerhouses on 18 April, this time in Varese, with the home-team – unbeaten against Simmenthal at home for nearly eight years – confident of winning.\nThat prediction proved to be correct as the newly crowned European Champions took the game 90-79, helped by two scoring performances by Ivan Bisson (34 points) and Morse (30 points).\nSimmenthal and Varese traded blows equally during the first two quarters, before Kenney struck Meneghin whilst they were fighting for a ball, leaving him with a bloodied nose that took him off the court for the game.\nTensions flared after this incident, with the public raging after both the referees (who left the American unpunished) and Kenney, who dominated Meneghin's replacement Ottorino Flaborea to grab offensive rebounds and push Milano in front.\nHowever the same Kenney's departure from the court seven minutes into the second half for five fouls, followed three minutes later by Masini for the same reasons, decisively changed the flow of the game in Varese's favour, they soon took a ten-point lead they would not relinquish.\nThe last round unsurprisingly saw both win their games to finish on the same points and head-to-head record, once again creating the need for a one-off play-off game to crown the champion (the third such occurrence in as many years).\nStandings.\nSource: Lega Basket\nIndividual scoring table.\n\"Source: unofficial statistics compiled by the Giganti del Basket magazine (official statistics started from the 1975–76 season).\"\nPostseason.\nTitle playoff.\nThe title-deciding playoff game was played in Bologna's Palazzo dello Sport on 25 April 1973 in front of 7,000 people.\nSimmenthal first took a 10-6 lead on the back of Bariviera's efficient marking of Morse, staying ahead for nearly all the first half before Marino Zanatta put Ignis in front 16 minutes in (30-29).\nThe same Zanatta picked up his fourth foul soon after and his absence in defense saw Simmenthal push in front, taking a 63-54 lead 33 minutes in.\nHowever, a minute later Kenney departed after committing his fifth foul, followed two minutes later by Bariviera with the score (68-63) still favouring the Milanese though the loss of two of their forwards put them on the back foot.\nIgnis took advantage of the height differential and their forwards, Meneghin (playing with a face mask to protect his nose), Morse (top-scorer with 31 points) and Bisson (marked by a 12 cm smaller Brumatti) scored seemingly at will, equalising (68-68) two minutes from the end before racing home to a 74-70 win to claim the title back from Simmenthal.\nItalian Cup.\nHolders Simmenthal were surprisingly sent crashing out at the quarterfinal stage by Saclà who were joined in the Brescia-based final four by another promoted side, Cagliari, with the other semi-final pitting Varese against Cantù.\nSaclà and Ignis made it to the final, which was easily won 94-65 by the Italian champions, who added the cup to their domestic, European and Intercontinental titles.\nAs they were already qualified for the 1973–74 European Champions Cup, Asti took their place in the European Cup Winners' Cup.\nChampionship-winning squad.\nIgnis Varese 1972–73 Serie A champions\nSource: Lega Basket"

Additional qualifiers were determined in playoffs held on 30 November 2016.\nMen's.\nTop 16 \"(seeded)\"\n17–24 in BDO rankings \"(first round)\"\n25–26 in BDO rankings \"(preliminary round)\"\n2016 finalist not in top 26 \"(preliminary round)\"\nRegional table qualifiers \"(preliminary round)\"\nPlayoff qualifiers \"(preliminary round)\"\nWomen's.\nTop 8 \"(seeded)\"\n9–14 in BDO rankings\nPlayoff qualifiers\nDraw bracket.\nMen.\nPreliminary round.\nAll matches are the first to 3 sets.\nYouth.\nFor the third consecutive year, a youth final was played on the Lakeside stage during the Championships. In November 2016, the Youth tournament was played down to the final two. The final took place on 12 January, and was contested between 14 year old Nathan Girvan from Scotland and 16 year old Justin van Tergouw from the Netherlands. The format was first to three sets.\nJustin van Tergouw was crowned champion, after only dropping one leg and recording a 3–0 victory, whilst throwing a three dart average of 88.20.\nTV coverage.\nStarting from this year's World Championship Channel 4 signed a 2-year deal to broadcast both the men's and women's World Championship. Channel 4 showed afternoon games and the first semi final. BT Sport showed the evening games and the second semi final. The final was shown on both channels.\nOutside of the United Kingdom, live coverage of all matches was provided by YouTube on the BDO's own channel.\nChannel 4.\nIt was announced in December 2016 that Rob Walker would present Channel 4's World Darts coverage. He was joined in the studio by analysts Deta Hedman and Paul Nicholson. Bobby George also featured in Channel 4's coverage, however, unlike the BBC where he was their main pundit, he instead did 'special features'. Reporters for the tournament were Seema Jaswal and Danny Crates. In a similar arrangement that the BBC had with BT Sport, they shared commentary teams. This was led by John Rawling who was joined by Vassos Alexander and Jim Proudfoot in the commentary booth.\nChannel 4 had the rights to all afternoon sessions, the first men's semi final, and shared coverage of the men's final.\nBT Sport.\nBT Sport broadcast their 3rd BDO World Darts Championships. Ray Stubbs, who presented BT Sport's coverage of darts since its inception, moved to Talksport 2 and was replaced by Matt Smith. He was joined in the studio alongside two-time Lakeside semi finalist Chris Mason who acted as their analyst throughout the championships. They shared the same commentary team as Channel 4 which was led by John Rawling, with Vassos Alexander and Jim Proudfoot also in the commentary box, alongside Mason and Paul Nicholson. Reshmin Chowdury was BT Sport's roving reporter from the Lakeside once again. BT Sport broadcast each evening session, the 2nd men's semi final and shared coverage of the final."

        "title": "List of British cyclists who have led the Tour de France general classification",
        "text": "Since the establishment of the competition in 1903, nine British riders have led the general classification in the Tour de France at the end of a stage during one of the 103 editions of the Tours de France. As of the end of the 2018 Tour, this equals a total of 101 stages.\nHistory.\nOne of the three Grand Tours of professional road bicycle racing, the Tour de France is the most famous road cycling event in the world, and is held annually around the month of July. Although all riders compete together, the winners of the Tour are divided into classifications, each best known by the coloured jersey that is worn by the leader of it; the general classification (GC), represented by the yellow jersey (French: \"maillot jaune\"), is for the overall leader in terms of the lowest time. The other individual classifications in the Tour are the points classification, commonly seen as the sprinters' classification (green jersey), the mountains classification (polka dot jersey), and the young rider classification (white jersey).\nThe first British rider to wear the yellow jersey was Tom Simpson in 1962, after he finished in the leading group of riders on stage twelve from Pau to Saint-Gaudens. He lost the lead in the following stage's mountain time trial. Thirty-two years later, at the 1994 Tour, Chris Boardman won the opening prologue in Lille. He wore yellow for the next three stages until the end of the team time trial on stage three. On the sixth stage from Cherbourg to Rennes, Sean Yates then took the lead of the race, holding yellow for one stage. In 1997, Boardman again took the yellow jersey after he won the prologue in Rouen. He lost it in the following stage that, although finished in a bunch sprint, awarded a time bonus to the winner. He came back the next year to win the prologue in Dublin. He held it until stage two when he crashed out of the race. In 2000, David Millar won the opening individual time trial in Futuroscope to hold yellow until stage four's team time trial.\nThe next British rider to lead the general classification was Bradley Wiggins in 2012, after he placed second behind compatriot and teammate Chris Froome on stage seven's summit finish at the La Planche des Belles Filles ski station. Wiggins held the yellow jersey until the end of the Tour to become the first Briton to win the race. Froome came in second overall, and the following year went one better and won the Tour after gaining and holding the lead to the end after his victory on stage eight's mountain course from Castres to Ax 3 Domaines. After he was forced to retire due to an injury in 2014, Froome came back in 2015, and on stage three's summit finish at Huy claimed the yellow jersey, although he lost it the following day after a solo win from German rider Tony Martin. Froome took the yellow jersey back from Martin after he retired from the Tour after stage six. No rider wore yellow for the seven stage as Martin had finished the stage, so Froome held it after the seventh; he defended it until the conclusion of the race to win his second Tour. He also claimed the mountains classification, the first time a rider had won both in the same year since Eddy Merckx in 1970. In 2016, Mark Cavendish won the opening stage's bunch sprint at Utah Beach to become the seventh British rider to wear yellow. He lost the jersey after the next stage's uphill sprint finish. Froome's solo victory after the descent into Bagnères-de-Luchon saw him take the race lead, which he held to the end of the Tour and win his third title."

        "text": "The represents Japan in international wheelchair rugby. Japan is the third most successful team in the Asia-Oceania region, finishing outside the medal places only once in eight appearances at the IWRF Asia-Oceania Championship. Japan have won the tournament once, in 2015 and are also the 2014 Asian Para Games champions. They have reached four Summer Paralympics, with their best finish being 4th in the 2012 Games in London.\nHistory.\nThe Japan Wheelchair Rugby Federation (formerly the Japan Quad Rugby Federation) was established in April 1997, in response to the introduction of wheelchair rugby at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta. A wheelchair rugby club structure was already in existence and a national team was quickly formed, with a tour to Australia undertaken by the end of the year. In 2001 Japan sent their national team to the inaugural IWRF Asia-Oceania Championship and have been a constant fixture at the event ever since. In the first five Asia-Oceania Games, Japan was normally the third placed team, behind the dominance of Australia and New Zealand.\nIn 2004 Japan qualified for their first Summer Paralympics. Although initially unsuccessful, with only two wins over China in the first 11 games of their first two Paralympics, the team showed improvement in the buildup to the 2012 Games in London. The team's first breakthrough came at the 2011 IWRF Asia-Oceania Championship, where they finished second for the first time, beating New Zealand into third place. They followed this by finishing second in their group at the 2012 Paralympics by beating both Britain and France. Japan finished fourth at the Games just outside the medal positions. Wheelchair rugby was introduced at the 2014 Asian Para Games, which Japan won, beating South Korea in the final. The next year Japan won their first IWRF Asia-Oceania Championship, beating Australia 56–51 in the gold medal play off, finishing the year ranked as the 3rd best team in the world.\nParalympic Games.\nJapan have appeared in three Summer Paralympics, 2004 in Athens, 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London. They have qualified for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio when they won the 2015 IWRF Asia-Oceania Championship. \nThe 2004 Paralympics in Beijing was the second Games to host a wheelchair rugby event, after its introduction in the previous Games in Sydney. Japan became the first Asian nation to qualify for the Wheelchair rugby tournament. Japan were placed in Group A, along with Australia, New Zealand and the United States. They lost all three-round matches, though their match against Australia was close affair, finishing 48–47 to the Australians. In the medal round they were paired against Great Britain and a loss saw an end to their medal chances. They finished the 2004 tournament in last place. They returned four years later, qualifying due to their world ranking. They again found themselves in Group A, facing Canada, the United States and hosts China. They recorded their first Paralympic win with victory over China, but due to loses to both Canada and the States, they finished in the bottom half of the overall table, finishing seventh overall.\nIn the 2012 Games in London Japan qualified through the group stage for the first time in their history, beating both France and hosts Great Britain in the qualifying round. In the medal round they lost against eventual champions Australia in the semi-finals, and in the bronze medal play-off match they were beaten by the United States to finish in fourth place.\nWorld Wheelchair Rugby Championships.\nJapan first entered the World Wheelchair Rugby Championships in 2002 where they finished eighth from a field of 12. The team returned for the next games in 2006 in Christchurch, New Zealand, where they finished fifth. The 2010 Championships, in Vancouver, was the team's best to date. They qualified through their group and succeeded into the medal stages. Although losing their semi-final encounter, they were able to beat Sweden in the bronze medal match to finish third overall. At the 2014 IWRF World Championship Japan finished second in their group during the qualifying stages but were beaten by Australia in the semi-final. The team were then faced the United States for the bronze medal encounter, but lost 62–56 to finish in fourth place."

        "text": "Charles B. Walker Stadium at Lents Park is a baseball stadium located in Lents Park in the Lents neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It has been home to the West Coast League Portland Pickles baseball team since 2016. The Pickles play thirty home games per sixty game season. The team pays rent to the City, cleans the stadium, and provides security during games. Outside of the dates set aside for the team, the stadium is open for permitted play by anyone who reserves it. The Northwest Independent Baseball League plays many of its games at Walker Stadium.\nThe ballpark has hosted as many as 1,877 fans for a Pickles game.\nHistory.\nThe City of Portland purchased 32 acres from private owners in the 1940s and 1950s to assemble land between SE 88th Ave, SE 92nd Ave, SE Holgate Blvd and SE Steele St to expand Lents Park. The city prepared a central plan in 1953 to propose locations for a baseball stadium, playing fields, tennis courts, community buildings, pathways, and parking areas. Construction on the stadium began in 1956 and included lights for night games. The stadium was named for Charles B. Walker, the city's first Sports Director in 1935 who helped organize the first men's and women's softball tournaments held west of the Mississippi, and in 1950 was appointed as commissioner of the Amateur Softball Association (ASA) for the Portland area.\nIn 2008, Merritt Paulson, owner of the Portland Beavers examined building an 8,000 to 9,000 seat minor league ballpark on the site of Walker Stadium for $45 million. Paulson planned to begin construction in March 2010, and the Beavers would play there in 2011. The location was eventually rejected for the Beavers due to objections from neighbors.\n2016 Renovation.\nIn March 2015, Portland and Great West League officials announced plans to renovate the stadium, adding 500 seats and concessions and complementing the city's urban renewal goals for the Lents neighborhood. Walker Stadium was supposed to have received upgrades as part of a 1994 bond measure but other municipal projects competed for limited funding.\nUnder the plans, the public-private partnership of the Portland Pickles, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, and the Portland Development Commission spent $650,000 to upgrade the city-owned ballpark with Portland's urban renewal agency paying $200,000, the parks bureau $50,000, and the baseball team $400,000. The renovations included new seating with chair-backs, new scoreboard, new dugouts, new grass, a playground, and other improvements. The team agreed to pay $200 per-game in rent with payments beginning in 2016 and annual 3.5 percent increases.\nThe renovation was completed in June 2016 on schedule for the Pickles' first game. Portland Mayor Charlie Hales threw out the first pitch at the first game at Walker Stadium on June 10, 2016, an extra-inning loss to the Marysville Gold Sox."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of King Chulalongkorn",
        "text": "Equestrian statue of Chulalongkorn the Great, () other known as Equestrian statue (, , ) is an outdoor sculpture in cast bronze at the center of the Royal Plaza in Bangkok, Thailand, honoring King Chulalongkorn. It was erected on 11 November 1908 to commemorate his 40th anniversary of his accession to the throne, the longest-reigning monarch in Siamese history at that time.\nDescription and location.\nThe statue is cast in bronze. It is 5 meters in height and weighs 6 tons. It is attached to a 25-centimeter thick bronze base on top of a 2-meter-wide, 5-meter-long and 6-meter-tall marble pedestal.\nThe statue itself depicts Chulalongkorn in military uniform of Field marshal, wearing his decorations; he holds the reins in his left hand and a baton in his right.\nThe statue stands at the center of the Royal Plaza, facing southwest towards Ratchadamnoen Avenue. It lies to south of the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, to the west of Suan Amphon and to the east of Sanam Suea Pa.\nHistory.\nIt was believed that Chulalongkorn had desired for an equestrian statue since he was a young King. In the 13 June 1874 edition of The Illustrated London News, it was reported that a silver equestrian statue of Chulalongkorn was cast by an English metallurgist of the Messrs. Hunt and Roskell by Chulalongkorn's commission. However, there are no other source or evidence that mentioned of this fact.\nDuring Chulalongkorn's second 'Grand Tour' of Europe in 1907, he visited the Palace of Versailles in France and made a remark that he was impressed by the Equestrian Statue of King Louis XIV and thought that if an equestrian statue of him were to be erected at a plaza between Ratchadamnoen Avenue and the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, it would be majestic which were similar to other modern nations in Europe. \nHowever, there are also argument that Chulalongkorn rather made a remark about the statue of Italian King Victor Emmanuel II in Milan, Italy that it was \"very beautiful\". This is supported by the fact that Chulalongkorn had expressed his interest and fascination in the sculpture and metallurgy of Italy since his first 'Grand Tour' of Europe in 1897.\nHis remark was later made known to Crown Prince Vajiravudh, the regent of Siam at that time, and after consultation with his ministers, they proposed that in commemoration of Chulalongkorn's 40th anniversary of his accession to the throne in 1908, an equestrian statue were to be erected by public donation.\nAfter Chulalongkorn's approval, Prince Charoonsak Kridakara, Siamese ambassador to France, was assigned to find a suitable foundry for the sculpture. He recommended Susse Frères, a well-known foundry company located in Paris, France because it was satisfactory in terms of reputation, price and experience.\nTwo French prominent metallurgist, Clovis-Edmond Masson and Georges Saulo, were in charge of such work. On 22 August 1907, Chulalongkorn went to the Susse Frères foundry and mounted on a horse statue to be modeled. The statue was initially modeled after an equestrian statue of the Spanish King Alfonso XIII, whose statue had just been cast by Susse Frères in 1906. However, since Alfonso XIII was a tall and slender man, the statue had to be adjusted to the body of Chulalongkorn. The statue was complete and then shipped to Siam, reaching the port in Bangkok on 11 November 1908, which coincided with Rajamangalabhisek Royal Ceremony which commemorated Chulalongkorn's 40th anniversary of his accession to the throne, the longest-reigning monarch in Siamese history.\nThe budget for the statue was estimated to be around 200,000 baht but the money donated from the public exceeded the expected amount to around 1,200,000 baht. The excess of such amount was offered to Chulalongkorn for future public use upon his discretion. However, before deciding what the money should be spent on, Chulalongkorn died on 23 October 1910. His successor, Vajiravudh, later used such money to build Chulalongkorn University in his honor."

        "text": "David Edwards (December 2, 1971 – March 24, 2020) was an American basketball player. A 5'10\" point guard, he played college basketball for Georgetown and Texas A&amp;M before going on to play professionally in Europe. In 1996, he set the Úrvalsdeild karla assists single game record with 18.\nHigh school career.\nEdwards was born in Richmond, Virginia and moved to New York City before high school, living in public housing. and played at Andrew Jackson High School under coach Chuck Granby. At Jackson he averaged 41 points per game as a senior. His 947 points during that season was a New York City scoring record. It was a New York State Public High School Athletic Association for one day that Edwards set on February 17, 1989 surpassing Curtis Aiken 924 single-season record in a playoff loss before Marcus Whitfield reached 958 in his 21st game, a playoff win for Burgard Vocational High School on February 18. He was considered to be one of the best players to ever come out of Queens, New York. His ability led to debate as to whether or not he was better than future NBA player Kenny Anderson. Edwards played streetball at Rucker Park and was known to impress the crowd. He committed to Georgetown over offers from Iowa and Loyola Marymount.\nCollege career.\nEdwards played initially at Georgetown University, where he averaged 5.4 points per game as a freshman. He posted 14 assists in this first game. Through his first 12 games Edwards led the Hoyas with 89 assists. He experienced disagreements with coach John Thompson and transferred. This disagreement was based on Thompson focusing on big men such as Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, and Edwards later admitted was immature and was not \"a complete player.\"\nEdwards transferred to play at Texas A&amp;M under Kermit Davis, but Davis resigned after one season due to recruiting violations. Davis was replaced as head coach by Tony Barone, and Edwards needed time to adjust to the coach's structured offense. As a senior, he averaged 13.3 points, 5.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game. He was one of six players to post a triple-double on consecutive games on March 5, and March 10, 1994. His 265 assists as a senior remain a school record. During his senior season at Texas A&amp;M, he was the runner-up for the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award, given to the best senior in the country under 6-feet tall. Edwards was a three-time All-Southwest Conference selection. During his career at Texas A&amp;M, he tallied 1,167 points, 602 assists and 228 steals, and he was the school's total assists and steals leader until 2016 when he was surpassed by Alex Caruso. Edwards maintained a 6.5 Assists college average while Caruso had a 4.7 assists college average.\nProfessional career.\nLithuania.\nEdwards began his professional basketball career with BC Šilutė in the Lithuanian Basketball League during the 1995–1996 season where he averaged 23.2 points, 8.7 assists and 4.4 steals per game, leading the league in assists and steals while coming in second in the league in scoring.\nIceland.\nHe signed with KR in the Icelandic Úrvalsdeild karla in October 1996, replacing Champ Wrencher. In his first game on 17 October, he had 22 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists in a 79–79 tie against ÍA in the Icelandic Company Cup. In the second game, he had 12 points, 13 assists and 7 steals in KR's 82–79 victory. He helped KR to the finals of the Company Cup in November where they lost to Keflavík 101–107. In the game, Edwards had 25 points, 10 assists and 5 steals. In his six games in the Company Cup, he averaged 18.2 points and 10.5 assists.\nOn 8 December, Edwards set a Úrvalsdeild record with 18 assists in a 88–91 loss against ÍR, breaking Jón Kr. Gíslason's old record of 17 assists set in 1991. The record stood until 21 November 2022, when it was broken by Vincent Malik Shahid. On 15 December, he scored a season high 38 points in a 106–111 loss against Grindavík in the Úrvalsdeild. Following the game, he had a heated discussion with referee Helgi Bragason which ended with Helgi disqualifying him from the game which automatically resulted in a 1-game suspension. Following the Christmas break, Edwards was replaced by Geoff Herman. He appeared in 8 games in the Úrvalsdeild, averaging 20.8 points, 10.4 assists and 4.3 steals per game.\nPost-basketball career.\nEdwards served as a recreation manager at the non-profit organization Elmcor Youth and Services Activities. He coached basketball at The Mary Louis Academy in Queens.\nPersonal life and death.\nHis father, Dave Edwards was a 4-year player and a 3-year captain at Virginia Commonwealth University. He had two sons, David and Corey. Corey played basketball at George Mason and coaches at Montverde Academy.\nEdwards died in Queens, New York of COVID-19 on March 24, 2020. He was just 48 years old."

        "text": "The 2016–17 ISU Speed Skating World Cup, officially the \"ISU World Cup Speed Skating 2016–2017\", was a series of international speed skating competitions that ran the entire season. The season started on 11 November 2016 in Harbin, China, and ended with the final on 11 March 2017 in Stavanger, Norway.\nIn total, six competition weekends were held at six different locations, 18 cups were contested (nine for men, and nine for women), and 88 races took place. Additionally, there were two Grand World Cups, one for men and one for women, in which all individual races, regardless of distance, counted.\nThe World Cup is organized by the International Skating Union (ISU).\nCalendar.\nThe detailed schedule for the season.\nIn addition, there were two combination cups, the allround combination and the sprint combination. For the allround combination, the distances were 1500 + 5000 metres for men, and 1500 + 3000 metres for women. For the sprint combination, the distances were 500 + 1000 metres, both for men and women. These cups were contested only in World Cup 5, in Berlin, Germany.\nEntry rules.\nQualification criteria.\nIn order to qualify, skaters had to achieve the following results in ISU events, international competitions or national championships between 1 July 2015 and the entry deadline for the competition concerned.\nFor the mass start and team pursuit events, skaters who had achieved any one of the above results were qualified. However, every ISU member nation was allowed to enter a maximum of one skater per gender who had not achieved any of these results, provided that they had achieved a 1500 m result of 1:57.50 (men) or 2:10.00 (women).\nNation quotas.\nEvery ISU member nation was allowed to enter at least one competitor for each distance, subject to the qualification criteria above. Additionally, countries placed among the top 40 in the final 2015–16 World Cup were allowed an additional entry per top 40 (though 5 riders in the top 40 were required to have the full quotum of 5). The maximum quota was 5 skaters. A member nation organizing a World Cup competition was granted the maximum quota in all events. Member nations not mentioned were allowed to enter a maximum of one skater for each distance.\nFor the mass start event, a member nation was allowed to enter a maximum of two skaters, all subject to the qualifying criteria above. For the team pursuit and team sprint events, a member nation was allowed to enter one team only per category (men/women).\nThe World Cup competitions 1–4 served as qualifying events for the 2017 European Championships and 2017 World Single Distance Championships. World Cup 5 served as a qualifying event for the 2017 World Allround Championships and 2017 World Sprint Championships. Results from World Cups 1–5 defined the seeding for the Single Distance Championships. World Cup 5 had extended entry quotas due to its status as qualifying event; each ISU member nation got one more quota place than its highest quota of either of the two distances in the competition, however, the maximum quota was still 5 places.\nCompetition format.\nSeeding of skaters.\nIf the number of entered skaters exceeded a certain limit, skaters competed in two separate divisions, A and B. In the first competition, the composition of skaters in the respective division was determined by the ranking of the skaters in the respective distance category from the 2015–16 World Cup and the seeding submitted by the respective team leaders before the draw. For each country and distance category, the number of skaters in the ranking top of the previous year decided the number of places available in Division A, but the team leader's seeding decided which skater goes into which division.\nIn the following competitions, the current World Cup ranking was used, with special considerations to top-placed skaters in Division B of the previous competition. A skater was also under certain conditions allowed to apply for a wild card for Division A, but only the first time the skater participated in a distance category, and not in the first and last competitions of the season. In the last competition for the season, there was no Division B.\nPoints system.\nPoints tables.\nWorld Cup points for all competitions, except the last, were awarded in both divisions, using two sets of tables, A1/B1 and A2/B2. Tables A1 and B1 were used when the number of competitors in Division A exceeded 16, while tables A2 and B2 were used when that number was between 12 and 16. However, if table B1 was used for Division B in the first race in an event that is raced twice in the same competition, it was used also in the second race, regardless of the number of competitors in Division A.\nFor the last competition, since there was no Division B, points were awarded using table A3.\n \nMass start ranking.\nThe mass start races were over 20 laps for men and 15 laps for women. There were three intermediate sprints, at 5, 10 and 15 laps for men, and at 4, 8 and 12 laps for women. Race points were awarded to the four first skaters at the intermediate sprints, and to the six first skaters at the final sprint. The accumulated points a skater collected during a race decided the final ranking. For skaters who were tied in race points, including those who had failed to collect any, their finishing order broke the tie.\nGrand World Cup.\nIn order to determine an overall World Cup winner, one for men and one for women, a special points system was used, awarding points for the top five skaters in each individual event.\nPrize money.\nAdditionally, the Grand World Cup winner of each category (men/women) was awarded $20000.\nWorld records.\nWorld records going into the 2016–17 season."

        "title": "Guerilla Cricket",
        "text": "Guerilla Cricket is an Internet radio site that broadcasts commentaries of cricket matches internationally, as a separate entity from those produced by official organisations such as the BBC. It was set up in 2014 up by alumni of Test Match Sofa, an earlier alternative commentary site. Broadcasts have emanated from a variety of sites in London, where the commentators describe the television coverage to listeners, while engaging in wide ranging discussion of the cricket and anything else taking their fancy.\nSince international cricket has returned following the COVID-19 pandemic, the site has utilized Zoom to ensure that its commentators are socially distant while continuing to provide commentary. This has allowed the use of commentators based outside of England, including Australia, Singapore, and the United States.\nIreland vs Pakistan.\nGuerilla Cricket successfully bid for the exclusive radio rights to Ireland's inaugural Test match against Pakistan, beating both the BBC and Talksport to be the official radio partners of Cricket Ireland. The game was held at Malahide, near Dublin, from May 11–15, 2018. It was the first time the team commentated live from the match itself.\nCoverage.\nWhile initially focused on England's international cricket matches, the service has developed over a number of years to cover major series involving India, Pakistan, Australia and South Africa, as well as World Cup and IPL T20 cricket. Perhaps the most unusual coverage was of the Under 19 World Cup game between England and Namibia.\nSense of humour.\nGuerilla Cricket is known for its sense of humour, irreverence and surrealism, in sharp contrast to the formal nature of official broadcasts such as Test Match Special. Its method of operation puts it beyond the reach of the game's controlling body in England, the England and Wales Cricket Board, and it is unlikely that any current test players would be allowed to appear. The site has benefited from social media in its commentary, unlike traditional, one-way, broadcasting, which allows an exchange of information. A fan of the site has been seen wearing a gorilla costume at matches.\nUK General Elections.\nAs well as providing cricket commentary, Guerilla Cricket also provided on-air coverage of the UK General Elections in 2015 and 2017, providing their usual irreverent views as events unfolded. Key events were marked with musical jingles provided by James Sherwood who has provided a number of songs which are used within the cricket commentary, including the Guerilla Cricket theme tune.\nFundraising appeals.\nA number of appeals have enabled Guerilla Cricket to remain on-air and broadcast worldwide free commentary. In July 2015, the site ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to raise £3,000 to broadcast the 2015 Ashes series live from the Jetlag Bar in London. A subsequent campaign the following winter raised over £5,000 to broadcast test series in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa. More recently, a campaign has raised nearly £3,000 to enable the team to cover Ireland's inaugural Test match."

Gehnäll Persson had been promoted to lieutenant three weeks before the competition. Just two and a half weeks after the competition, the Swedish army demoted him back to sergeant. According to the regulations at the time, only officers and “gentlemen riders” were eligible to take part, but not non-commissioned officers. Since Persson had only been promoted for the period surrounding the games, this was considered a violation of the rules. The incident led to the FEI modernizing its entry conditions, which were perceived as outdated.\nCompetition format.\nThe team and individual dressage competitions used the same results. A test was to be carried out from memory by each rider within 13 minutes, losing half a point for every second over the time limit."

An outfielder (OF) is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter, who are identified as the left fielder (LF), the center fielder (CF), and the right fielder (RF). An outfielder's duty is to try to catch long-fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. Outfielders normally play behind the six other members of the defense who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, outfielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the outfielders are assigned the numbers 7 (left field), 8 (center field), and 9 (right field).\nThe overwhelming majority of putouts recorded by outfielders, almost to exclusivity, result from catching fly balls. However, in extraordinary circumstances, an outfielder may record a putout by receiving a throw to force out or tag out a runner while covering a base if one or more infielders are out of position to retrieve an errant throw, or by tagging a runner stranded between bases in a rundown play; however, even in such circumstances, outfielders will more typically act as a backup to infielders than cover a base themselves. Historically, putout totals for outfielders rose after 1920 with the end of the dead-ball era; the same circumstances which had kept home run totals low, such as overused baseballs and legal adulterations including the spitball, had similarly hindered the type of power hitting which lent itself to long fly balls. But as strikeout totals have risen in baseball in recent decades, the frequency of other defensive outs including flyouts has declined; as a result, putout totals for outfielders have likewise declined. Through the 2022 season, all but eight of the top 76 single-season outfield putout totals were recorded between 1920 and 1988; only one of the top 498 totals was recorded before 1912.\nBecause game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics prior to 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Because they are expected to cover more territory in the outfield than their counterparts on either side, often being the fastest player of the three, center fielders typically record the highest putout totals; due to the frequency of fly balls, center fielders typically record more putouts than other players, except for catchers and first basemen, who record higher totals due to the frequency of strikeouts and ground outs respectively. 6 of the top 7 career leaders in outfield putouts, and 14 of the top 18, were center fielders. Willie Mays is the all-time leader in career putouts as an outfielder with 7,095; he is the only outfielder to record more than 7,000 career putouts. Tris Speaker (6,788), Rickey Henderson (6,468), Max Carey (6,363), Ty Cobb (6,361), and Richie Ashburn (6,089) are the only other outfielders to record more than 6,000 career putouts. Andrew McCutchen, who had 3,675 putouts through the 2022 season to place him 106th all-time, is the leader among active players."

        "title": "Boxing in the United States",
        "text": "The origins of Boxing in the United States can be traced as far back as the 19th century. Boxing, as, a form of martial art and solo sport, has been around for centuries. Some people practice it as a form of self-defence while doing it as a part of their workout regime. The United States became the center of professional boxing in the early 20th century.\nThe United States became the center of professional boxing in the early 20th century. The National Boxing Association was founded in 1921 and began to sanction title fights.\nJoe Louis was an American professional boxer who competed from 1934 to 1951. He reigned as the world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949, and is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. In 2005, Louis was ranked as the best heavyweight of all time by the International Boxing Research Organization, and was ranked number one on \"The Ring\" magazine's list of the \"100 greatest punchers of all time\". Louis had the longest single reign as champion of any heavyweight boxer in history.\nLouis is widely regarded as the first person of African-American descent to achieve the status of a nationwide hero within the United States, and was also a focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to and during World War II. He was instrumental in integrating the game of golf, breaking the sport's color barrier in America by appearing under a sponsor's exemption in a PGA event in 1952.\nSince the late 1990s boxing has declined in popularity for a myriad of factors such as more sports entertainment options and combat alternatives such as MMA's UFC amongst a younger demographic. Lack of mainstream coverage in newspapers and access on major television networks. Also the lack of a US Heavyweight world champion.\nIt was hoped in 2015 that the Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao fight would re-invigorate interest in the sport in the United States but because the fight was disappointing it was perceived as doing further harm to the image of the sport in the United States.\nHistory.\nThe sport of boxing came to the United States from England in the late 1700s and took root in the 1800s mainly in large urban areas such as Boston, New York City, and New Orleans.\nJohn L. Sullivan became the first American heavyweight champion in 1882 under the bare knuckle boxing rules and again in 1892, becoming the first world Heavyweight champion of the gloved era. He was defeated by James Corbett, often referred to as the father of modern boxing due to his innovative scientific technique, in 1892.\nJack Johnson was the first African American heavyweight champion.\nProfessional boxing.\nIn 1920, the Walker Law legalized prizefighting in New York state by establishing the New York State Athletic Commission. In response, representatives from 13 states established the National Boxing Association and also began to sanction title fights. The NYSAC and NBA sometimes crowned different \"world champions\" in the same division, leading to confusion about who was the real champion.\nJack Dempsey became one of the most popular athletes in the 1920s promoted by the likes of Tex Rickard.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, many African American boxers were restricted by the competitions they could enter, see Murderers' Row . \nAfter World War II, television took on an important role in professional boxing. It was popular because of its relatively low production costs compared with other sports, professional boxing was a major feature of television programming throughout much of the 1950s and early 1960s.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Muhammad Ali became an iconic figure, transformed the role and image of the African American athlete in America by his embrace of racial pride, and transcended the sport by refusing to serve in the Vietnam War. In the 1980s and 1990s, major boxers such as Mike Tyson and Riddick Bowe were marked by crime and self-destruction.\nAmateur boxing.\nThe Amateur Athletic Union of the United States was founded in 1888 and began its annual championships in boxing the same year. In 1926 the Chicago Tribune started a boxing competition called the Golden Gloves. The United States of America Amateur Boxing Federation (now USA Boxing), which governs American amateur boxing, was formed after Amateur Sports Act of 1978 enabled the governance of sports in the US by organizations other than the AAU. This act made each sport set up its own National governing body (NGB). Each of these governing bodies would be part of the United States Olympic Committee, but would not be run by the Committee.\nIn 1992 Dallas Malloy won a case and USA Boxing admitted women to its program, being the first governing body in the world to do so.\nAn international organization for amateur boxing was begun in 1946, known as the International Amateur Boxing Association. The development amateur scene of boxing has seen the United States as a world beater. In the Olympics the US has won 106 Olympic medals to date: 47 gold, 23 silver and 36 bronzes. Most heavyweight champions of this century originate from the United States.\nWomen's boxing.\nThe first recorded women's boxing match in the United States occurred in New York in 1888, when Hattie Leslie beat Alice Leary in a brutal fight.\nWomen's boxing at a professional and amateur was rarely acknowledged until 1970's Cathy 'Cat' Davis , Marian Trimiar and Jackie Tonawanda were pioneers as they were the first women in the United States to get a license for boxing in the United States. Cathy Davis was the female boxer to appear on the cover of Ring Magazine.\nIn the 1990s, Women's boxing had a brief period of popularity due to likes of Christy Martin and Laila Ali. But early into 2000's, the sport fell back to relative obscurity due to lack of promotion, television exposure and poor matchmaking. Many female professional boxers in the United States struggle to make a viable living due to lack of financial opportunities and promotional opportunities. In 2012, interest in women's boxing was revived when women were allowed to compete in boxing at the Olympic games for the first time.\nTelevision and media coverage.\nBoxing used to be a popular staple viewing on American television due to its low costs and production values and was broadcast on all the major networks. Since the 1970s, it is mostly broadcast on pay-per-view and pay television channels, like HBO and Showtime. However, this and a myriad of factors resulted the sport's decline in popularity beginning in the late 1990s. One noted factor was the sport's exclusivity to these premium outlets, while mixed martial arts events were eventually broadcast on major television networks and more accessible platforms, drawing in a younger demographic and more mainstream coverage.\nIt was hoped that the 2015 Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao PPV would re-invigorate interest in the sport in the United States, but the eponymous main event was considered disappointing and was perceived as doing further harm to the image of the sport. 2015 would also mark the launch of Al Haymon's Premier Boxing Champions, which would help reintroduce the sport to mainstream audiences by airing events on both broadcast and cable networks and incorporating thematic elements to court younger viewership. At its peak, the series saw 4.8 million viewers for the 2016 Errol Spence Jr. vs Leonard Bundu telecast on NBC.\nThe 2017 match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor garnered major mainstream attention, in-part due to the celebrity status of UFC fighter Conor McGregor. The event received 4.3 million domestic buys; the second-highest buy rate in pay-per-view history. In the same year, Top Rank began a multi-year broadcasting agreement with ESPN, in which the network would broadcast events airing across its linear and digital properties, and an option to carry events on pay-per-view. ESPN would extend the agreement through 2025 on August 2, 2018."

Al Ahly is the biggest team in Egypt, Africa, and the Middle east.\n- The players of first-team names were: Farouk Yousef, Nabih Eskander, Samir Beltagy, and Mokhtar Abdelhamid.\n- The team manager was Amin Abu Haif.\n- The first two championships that the Al Ahly table tennis team won was the Cairo Zone Championship and the El Ebrashy Beek Cup\nHome Arena.\nWhen Al Ahly created handball, basketball, and volleyball teams, they believed it was incumbent upon them to erect an arena to host the home games. In 1978, they were low on funding. Because of this, the project was postponed. Later, on February 4, 1994, Al Ahly opened his sports hall officially in time of Al Ahly Chairman Saleh Selim\nOpening Ceremony\nAfter many years of waiting, Al Ahly finally achieved his dream of having his very own sports hall arena. On February 4, 1994, Al Ahly officially opened his arena in grand fashion. The ceremony started with words from then-incumbent Al Ahly chairman, Saleh Selim. With this speech, he declared that the name of the hall would be the \"Prince Abdalla El Faisl Hall\" because of the role he played in creating Al Ahly."

Brancaster West Marshes are a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area under the European Union Birds Directive, because they provide an important habitat for birds. Due to sea level rise, efforts to mitigate coastal erosion are in place in the area.\nEarth flood embankments were built nearby in 1978 to protect again storm surges, and there has also been the need for the course to implement defensive measures of its own.\nThe original course was laid out by Horace Hutchinson, but due to the fragility of the marshland and coast, it had undergone many changes over the past century, and there are now two crossings between holes 2 and 17 and 4 and 5. At times of high tide the course can become an island, thereby rendering parts of the layout inaccessible."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career putouts as a second baseman leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a putout (denoted by PO or fly out when appropriate) is given to a defensive player who records an out by tagging a runner with the ball when he is not touching a base, catching a batted or thrown ball and tagging a base to put out a batter or runner (a force out), catching a thrown ball and tagging a base to record an out on an appeal play, catching a third strike (a strikeout), catching a batted ball on the fly (a flyout), or being positioned closest to a runner called out for interference. In baseball and softball, the second baseman is a fielding position in the infield, commonly stationed between second and first base. The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet, needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly, and must be able to make the pivot on a double play. In addition, second basemen are almost always right-handed. Only four left-handed throwing players have appeared as second basemen in the major leagues since 1950; one of the four, Gonzalo Márquez, was listed as the second baseman in the starting lineup for two games in 1973, batting in the first inning, but was replaced before his team took the field on defense, and none of the other three players lasted even a complete inning at the position. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.\nPutouts are most commonly recorded by second basemen by stepping on second base after receiving a throw from another infielder or the pitcher to force out a runner on a ground out, often beginning a double play; a second baseman generally benefits in this respect from playing alongside an excellent shortstop with great range and quickness. Other ways in which second basemen often record a putout include catching a pop-up or line drive, fielding a ground ball close enough to second base that they can step on the bag for a force out before the runner advances from first base, tagging a runner after a throw from the catcher or pitcher on a stolen base attempt or a pickoff play, receiving a throw from an outfielder to tag out a runner trying to stretch a single into a double, receiving a throw to retire a runner who fails to tag up on a fly ball out, receiving a throw to force out a runner on a bunt (possibly a sacrifice hit attempt), and tagging a runner stranded between bases in a rundown play. Sometimes a second baseman will record a putout while covering first base if the first baseman is charging toward the plate on an expected bunt. Occasionally, a second baseman can record two putouts on a single play; with a runner taking a lead off second base and less than two out, the second baseman can catch a line drive near the base, then step on the bag before the runner can return, completing a double play; alternately, if a runner on first base breaks for second base when the ball is hit, the second baseman can catch a line drive and tag the runner before they can stop and return to first. On five occasions in major league history, a second baseman has recorded three putouts on a single play for an unassisted triple play, always by catching a line drive, then stepping on second base and tagging the runner advancing from first base (one of the five tagged the runner before stepping on the bag). The first and most famous of these occurred in Game Five of the 1920 World Series, when Cleveland Indians second baseman Bill Wambsganss accomplished the feat in the fifth inning.\nAs strikeout totals have risen in baseball, the frequency of other defensive outs including ground outs has declined; as a result, putout totals for second basemen have likewise declined, and seven of the top eight career leaders began their careers before 1961. Through 2021, only five of the top 19 single-season totals have been recorded since 1936, only eight of the top 70 since 1962, and only two of the top 154 since 1980; only four of the top 500 have been recorded since 2000. Bid McPhee, who retired in 1899 and is the only second baseman ever to record 500 putouts in a season, is the all-time leader in career putouts as a second baseman with 6,552. Eddie Collins (6,526) and Nellie Fox (6,090) are the only other second basemen with over 6,000 career putouts."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career putouts as a third baseman leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a putout (denoted by PO or fly out when appropriate) is given to a defensive player who records an out by tagging a runner with the ball when he is not touching a base, catching a batted or thrown ball and tagging a base to put out a batter or runner (a force out), catching a thrown ball and tagging a base to record an out on an appeal play, catching a third strike (a strikeout), catching a batted ball on the fly (a fly out), or being positioned closest to a runner called out for interference. Third base, or 3B, is the third of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner in order to score a run for that player's team. A third baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest third base, and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base. The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls, often being the closest infielder (roughly 90–120 feet) to the batter. The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm, as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base. The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play, and must also field fly balls in both fair and foul territory. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.\nThird basemen typically record putouts by stepping on third base after receiving a throw from another infielder or the pitcher to force out a runner on a ground out, by catching a pop-up or line drive, or by fielding a ground ball close enough to third base that they can step on the bag for a force out before the runner advances from second base. Other ways in which third basemen often record a putout include receiving a throw from an outfielder to tag a runner trying to reach third base, tagging a runner after a throw from the catcher or pitcher on a stolen base attempt or a pickoff play, receiving a throw to retire a runner who fails to tag up on a fly ball out, receiving a throw to force out a runner on a bunt (possibly a sacrifice hit attempt), and tagging a runner stranded between bases in a rundown play. Because fewer runners advance to third base than to the preceding bases, because of the higher difficulty of throwing out a runner taking a lead off second base, and because there are far fewer attempts to steal third base than second base, third basemen generally record far fewer putouts than any other players except pitchers. Occasionally, a third baseman can record two putouts on a single play; with a runner taking a lead off third base and less than two out, the third baseman can catch a line drive near the base, then step on the bag before the runner can return, completing a double play; alternately, if a runner on second base breaks for third base when the ball is hit, the third baseman can catch a line drive and tag the runner before they can stop and return to second.\nAs strikeout totals have risen in baseball, the frequency of other defensive outs including ground outs has declined; as a result, putout totals for third basemen have likewise declined, and all but three of the top 25 career leaders began their careers prior to 1961 even though career lengths for third basemen have steadily increased since 1920; eight of the top 13 began their careers before 1925. Through 2022, only four of the top 63 single-season totals have been recorded since 1929, only four of the top 138 since 1957, and only six of the top 499 since 1976. Brooks Robinson is the all-time leader in career putouts as a third baseman with 2,697; he is the only third baseman with more than 2,500 career putouts."

        "title": "2018 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2018 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, the 63rd season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 26th season since it was renamed from the European Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kyiv, Ukraine on 26 May 2018, between Spanish side and defending champions Real Madrid, who had won the competition in each of the previous two seasons, and English side Liverpool, making their eighth final appearance and first since 2007. The two sides had previously met in the 1981 final.\nAfter Liverpool's Sadio Mané cancelled out Karim Benzema's opener for Real Madrid, two goals from man of the match Gareth Bale proved the difference in a 3–1 win for the Spaniards, making them the first team to win three back-to-back titles in the Champions League era and the first since Bayern Munich defeated Saint-Étienne in the 1976 European Cup final; it was additionally their fourth title in five seasons and their 13th European Cup overall. They also earned the right to play the winners of the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League, Atlético Madrid, in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup and to enter the semi-finals of the 2018 FIFA Club World Cup, losing the former and winning the latter. Additionally, Real Madrid qualified to enter the group stage of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League, but since they already qualified through their league performance, the berth reserved was given to the champions of the 2017–18 Czech First League, the 11th-ranked association according to next season's access list.\nTeams.\n\"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\"\nVenue.\nThe NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium was announced as the final venue on 15 September 2016, following the decision of the UEFA Executive Committee meeting in Athens, Greece. This was the sixth European Cup/Champions League final hosted at an Eastern European venue following those in 1973 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the 1983, 1994 and 2007 finals hosted by Athens, Greece, as well as the 2008 final in Moscow, Russia.\nThe Olimpiyskiy Stadium was built in 1923 and it has been renovated three times, most recently in 2011 in preparation for the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament. The stadium was used as a venue in the 1980 Summer Olympics for its football event and the aforementioned European Championship, including the final match, which saw Spain beat Italy by the record-breaking score of 4–0 on the way to their third title. Its current capacity is 70,050 and it is used by the Ukraine national football team, Dynamo Kyiv, and major domestic matches like the Ukrainian Cup.\nBackground.\nDefending champions Real Madrid reached a record 16th final after a 4–3 aggregate win against German side Bayern Munich, knocking them out of the competition for the second consecutive season. This was Real Madrid's third consecutive final, and fourth final in five tournaments with an opportunity to win a record 13th title. Previously they won finals in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016 and 2017; and lost in 1962, 1964 and 1981. This was also their 20th final in all seasonal UEFA competitions, having also played in two Cup Winners' Cup finals (losing in 1971 and 1983) and two UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1985 and 1986). Real Madrid are only the third team since the competition's rebranding as the Champions League to reach three consecutive finals after A.C. Milan in 1995 and Juventus in 1998. They were the first team in the Champions League era, and the fourth overall, to win three straight finals, a feat only achieved by the Real Madrid side of the 1950s, as they went on to win a record five successive finals, as well as the Ajax and Bayern Munich squads of the 1970s in 1973 and 1976, respectively.\nLiverpool reached their eighth final, their first since 2007, after a 7–6 aggregate win against Italian side Roma. They had won the final on five occasions (1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005), and lost twice (1985 and 2007). This was also their 13th final in UEFA seasonal competitions, having played in one Cup Winners' Cup final (losing in 1966) and four UEFA Cup/Europa League finals (winning in 1973, 1976 and 2001; and losing in 2016). Liverpool were the first team since Bayern Munich in 2011–12 to reach the final having qualified for the competition through the play-off round. This was also the most recent occasion the final featured an English team (Chelsea). Liverpool were the most recent team to defeat Real Madrid in a European Cup final, winning 1–0 in Paris in 1981.\nBesides the 1981 final, the two teams had played each other four times in the Champions League era. Liverpool won both matches in the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League round of 16 (1–0 away and 4–0 at home), while Real Madrid won both matches in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League group stage (3–0 away and 1–0 at home).\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nPre-match.\nAmbassador.\nThe ambassador for the final was former Ukrainian international Andriy Shevchenko, who won the UEFA Champions League with Milan in 2003.\nTicketing.\nWith a stadium capacity of 63,000 for the final, a total of 40,700 tickets were available to fans and the general public, with the two finalist teams receiving 17,000 tickets each and with 6,700 tickets being available for sale to fans worldwide via UEFA.com from 15 to 22 March 2018 in four price categories: €450, €320, €160, and €70. The remaining tickets were allocated to the local organising committee, UEFA and national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters, and to serve the corporate hospitality programme.\nOpening ceremony.\nEnglish singer Dua Lipa performed at the opening ceremony preceding the final, by singing multiple songs (made by her) including her famous \"One Kiss\" and the fan-favorite \"No Lie\". Jamaican rapper Sean Paul joined her as a special guest to perform their collaborative song, \"No Lie\". The UEFA Champions League Anthem was performed by Croatian cello duo 2Cellos.\nRelated events.\nThe 2018 UEFA Women's Champions League final was held two days earlier, on 24 May 2018, at the Valeriy Lobanovskyi Dynamo Stadium between Wolfsburg and Lyon, Lyon emerging victorious 4–1. This was also the last time that the host city for the men's Champions League final was also automatically assigned the Women's Champions League final.\nThe annual UEFA Champions Festival was held between 24 and 27 May 2018 in the Kyiv city centre.\nIncidents.\nIn late May, \"The New York Times\" reported that some fans with allocated tickets had returned them after having trouble finding flights to and accommodation in Kyiv. Locals in Kyiv began offering free accommodation for fans affected by cancelled hotel and apartment arrangements. Several charter flights arranged for Liverpool fans were cancelled, leaving fans with tickets stranded and leading to an unsuccessful search for alternative solutions by the club and city government. Other airlines offered flights to Kyiv from airports in Liverpool and Manchester, using assigned slots at Kyiv's airports.\nOn 24 May, a group of Liverpool fans were attacked in a restaurant by 20 masked hooligans.\nMatch.\nOfficials.\nOn 7 May 2018, UEFA announced that Serbian Milorad Mažić would officiate the final. Mažić has been a FIFA referee since 2009, and gained UEFA's elite referee status in 2013. He was joined by his fellow countrymen, with Milovan Ristić and Dalibor Đurđević as assistant referees, Nenad Đokić and Danilo Grujić as additional assistant referees, and Nemanja Petrović as reserve assistant referee. The fourth official for the final was Frenchman Clément Turpin.\nSummary.\nThe match began with Liverpool's kickoff and the team's successive attacks to counter Madrid's slower, possession-based buildup. In the 23rd minute, a low shot by Trent Alexander-Arnold went through a defender's legs and forced a late save by Keylor Navas. Two minutes later, Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah was injured competing for the ball with Sergio Ramos, who had locked Salah's arm resulting in a fall. Due to a dislocated shoulder, Salah was substituted four minutes later for Adam Lallana. Madrid's Dani Carvajal was substituted in the 37th minute with a hamstring injury after an unsuccessful backheel. Minutes later, Karim Benzema appeared to score by finishing a shot started by a Cristiano Ronaldo header. His goal was disallowed however because he was judged to have been in an offside position. The first half ended scoreless, with Madrid dominating possession but Liverpool having more chances to score.\nThe first chance of the second half fell to Isco, who hit the crossbar. In the 51st minute, Benzema scored the match's first goal by deflecting a throw by Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius back into the net. Liverpool equalised four minutes later with a tap-in by Sadio Mané, who finished a header by Dejan Lovren after a corner kick by James Milner from the right. Gareth Bale was substituted in for Isco in the 61st minute and scored Madrid's second goal two minutes later, using an acrobatic bicycle kick to finish a cross by Marcelo from the left. Liverpool pressed for a second equalising goal, with a shot by Mané that hit the goal post and calls for a penalty for an alleged handball, but were also losing possession to Madrid. Ronaldo had a chance to score his first goal of the match during a counter-attack in the 73rd minute, but was tackled by Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson in the penalty box. Bale scored his second goal of the match in the 83rd minute on a shot that swerved in front of Karius and went through his hands and into the net. A second chance on goal for Ronaldo in the 93rd minute of play was interrupted by a pitch invader, who was captured by stadium stewards.\nDetails.\nThe \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held after the semi-final draw, which was held on 13 April 2018, 13:00 CEST, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nReal Madrid became the first team since Bayern Munich in 1974–76 to win three consecutive UEFA Champions Leagues or European Cups. The title was Madrid's 13th, another Champions League record, and their fourth in five years. Real Madrid's victory was the fifth consecutive title for a Spanish side in the Champions League, becoming the longest run for the trophy to be held by teams from the same country since English sides won six consecutive titles between 1977 and 1982.\nManager Zinedine Zidane became the first to win three consecutive Champions League titles and matched Carlo Ancelotti's record of Champions League era wins. Five days after the final, Zidane announced that he would step down as manager in favour of a \"different voice\". Cristiano Ronaldo became the first player to win the Champions League five times, surpassing the record set by Clarence Seedorf in 2007 and by Andrés Iniesta in 2015. The match also served as the last game for Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid, as he subsequently moved to Juventus in July.\nGareth Bale became the first substitute to score two goals in a Champions League final and was named man of the match. His first goal received acclaim as one of the best in Champions League history and was compared to Ronaldo's bicycle kick goal against Juventus in the quarter-final and manager Zinedine Zidane's goal in the 2002 final. \nSergio Ramos's tackle on Mohamed Salah received mixed reactions from the press and fans on whether the injury was the result of a deliberate blow or an accident. Egyptian fans responded with anger on social media, including insults that became trending topics on Twitter. A Change.org petition calling on UEFA and FIFA to punish Ramos for the challenge received 400,000 signatures within two days. A separate incident involving Ramos and Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius raised questions after a video showed him allegedly elbowing Karius in the face prior to his first goalkeeping error. UEFA declined to take action against Ramos for the incident with Karius. After an examination, on 4 June 2018, physiatrist Ross Zafonte at the Massachusetts General Hospital said in a statement that Karius suffered a concussion during the match and that, according to him, it was possible the concussion could have affected the player's performance.\nLiverpool manager Jürgen Klopp lost his sixth of seven major finals, including Champions League and league cups. After the match, Loris Karius tearfully apologised to Liverpool supporters who remained in the stands and stated that his mistakes \"lost the team the final\". After the match, he received online death threats and hate messages directed at him and his family. The game would end up being Karius's last for Liverpool, as he went on loans to Beşiktaş and Union Berlin before departing for Newcastle United in 2022."

The field for the Derby was limited to 20 horses, with up to four 'also eligibles' in case of a late withdrawal from the field.\nThe Road to the Kentucky Derby gives points to the top four finishers in specified races. The 2017 season consisted of 35 races, 19 races for the Kentucky Derby Prep Season and 16 races for the Kentucky Derby Championship Season. Earnings in non-restricted stakes acted as a tie breaker.

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career putouts as a first baseman leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a putout (denoted by \"PO\" or \"fly out\" when appropriate) is given to a defensive player who records an out by tagging a runner with the ball when he is not touching a base (a tagout), catching a batted or thrown ball and tagging a base to put out a batter or runner (a force out), catching a thrown ball and tagging a base to record an out on an appeal play, catching a third strike (a strikeout), catching a batted ball on the fly (a fly out), or being positioned closest to a runner called out for interference. First base, or 1B, is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player's team. A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base, and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.\nThe great majority of putouts recorded by first basemen result from their fielding a throw from one of the other three infielders or the pitcher on a ground out. Because of the frequency of ground outs, first basemen typically accumulate higher putout totals than players at any other position, and they often benefit in this area from the defensive skill of the other infielders. Other ways in which first basemen often record a putout include catching a pop-up or line drive, fielding a ground ball close enough to first base that they can step on the bag before the batter/runner arrives, tagging a runner on a pickoff play, receiving a throw to retire a runner who fails to tag up on a fly ball out, receiving a throw to retire a batter/runner on a bunt (often a sacrifice hit), and tagging a runner stranded between bases in a rundown play. Occasionally, a first baseman can record two putouts on a single play; with a runner taking a lead off first base and less than two out, the first baseman can catch a line drive near the base, then step on the bag before the runner can return, completing a double play. On two occasions in major league history, a first baseman has recorded three putouts on a single play for an unassisted triple play: On September 14, 1923, George Burns of the Boston Red Sox accomplished the feat in the second inning against the Cleveland Indians by catching a line drive, tagging the runner off first base, then sprinting to step on second base before the runner off that base could return. And on May 31, 1927, Johnny Neun of the Detroit Tigers completed a triple play in the same way, also against the Indians, securing a 1-0 victory in the ninth inning.\nAs strikeout totals have risen in baseball, the frequency of other defensive outs including ground outs has declined; as a result, putout totals for first basemen have likewise declined, and ten of the top eleven career leaders ended their careers before 1961. Through 2021, only two of the top 31 single-season totals have been recorded since 1927, and only 27 of the top 125 since 1945. Jake Beckley is the all-time leader in career putouts as a first baseman with 23,755. Cap Anson (21,699), Ed Konetchy (21,361), Eddie Murray (21,255), and Charlie Grimm (20,711) are the only other players to record 20,000 career putouts."

        "text": "The 2017 mid-year rugby union internationals (also known as the summer internationals in the Northern Hemisphere) were international rugby union matches that were mostly played in the Southern Hemisphere during the June international window.\nThe matches were part of World Rugby's Global rugby calendar (2012–19) that includes Test matches between the touring Northern Hemisphere nations and the home Southern Hemisphere nations. In addition to this, the global calendar gives Tier 2 nations the opportunity to play Tier 1 nations outside the November international window, increasing competitiveness from the Tier 2 sides.\nAustralia, the only southern hemisphere Tier 1 nation not to host a test series, staged three one-off test matches; Scotland, Italy and Fiji. The Fijian test was the first between the two sides in Australia since 2010, and was also the first Australia v Tier 2 nation match in Australia since Samoa visited in 2011. Fiji also played host to Italy and Scotland to become the second Tier 2 nation to play three back-back Tier 1 sides during an international window, after Samoa participated in the South African quadrangular tournament in 2013. En route to their test matches in Australia and Fiji, Italy and Scotland played each other in Singapore, which was the first ever Tier 1 v Tier 1 match played in the country.\nFor Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the matches acted as warm-ups ahead of the 2017 Rugby Championship. It was also a historic match when Kenya hosted Germany as the teams had never played each other before.\nSeries.\nThe international window coincided with the 2017 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, consisting of a three-test series between the Lions and New Zealand, plus seven non-test matches. Before the Lions series, New Zealand hosted Samoa for the first time since 2008. This was the first time that New Zealand hosted a Tier 2 nation since they played Fiji in June 2011. The match between New Zealand and Samoa followed a curtain raiser between Tonga and Wales, which was played at the same stadium, a neutral venue for the teams. Wales later travelled to Samoa, who hosted the Welsh for the first time since 1994.\nSouth Africa hosted France for the first time since 2010, while playing their first test series against the French since 2005. Argentina hosted England for a two-test series, while Japan hosted Ireland for the first time since 2005, the last time the two sides met. Before Ireland faced Japan, they played a one-off test away to the United States.\nOther tours.\nGeorgia travelled to the Americas where they played Canada, the United States and Argentina across the three week window. Romania, who no longer take part in the World Rugby Nations Cup, played three one-off matches, against Japan, Canada and Brazil. The Brazilian test was a historic first between the two nations, who had never played each other before, and was the first time since Brazil played a France XV side in 1985 that Brazil have played a team in a higher tier than them outside any tournament or competition. Before that test, Brazil played host to Portugal.\nFixtures.\n27–28 May.\nNotes:\n10 June.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\n16–17 June.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\n23–24 June.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\n1 July.\nNotes:\n8 July.\nNotes:"

        "text": "The 2017 Ivy League men's basketball tournament was a postseason conference tournament for the Ivy League. The tournament was March 11 and 12, 2017, at the Palestra on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\nThe tournament marked the first postseason tournament held by the Ivy League in men's basketball however the Ivy League continues to recognize the team or teams with the best record following the regular season to be the Ivy League Champion. In the tournament, league champion Princeton defeated Yale in the championship game to win the tournament. As a result, Princeton received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.\nBackground.\nThe Ivy League was the last NCAA Division I conference to hold a postseason tournament, instead choosing to award its automatic bids to the NCAA men's and women's tournaments to its regular-season champions; in the event that two teams finished tied atop the standings, Ivy League bylaws allowed for a one-game playoff to determine the recipient of the automatic bid, and in exceptionally rare cases, a three-team single-elimination tournament would be scheduled if three teams tied atop the standings (the Ivy League never had more than three regular season co-champions in one season). The Ivy League has historically resisted postseason play in all of its sports.\nIn March 2016, the League announced that it would institute men's and women's conference tournaments beginning with the 2016–17 season. Both tournaments would initially be held at the same site. The conference also reduced by one the number of regular-season games that its members are allowed to schedule.\nSeeds.\nThe top four teams in the Ivy League regular-season standings qualified for the tournament and were seeded according to their records in conference play, resulting in a Shaughnessy playoff.

        "text": "Jonathan Isaiah Jones (born September 20, 1993) is an American football cornerback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Auburn and signed with the Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 2016.\nEarly years.\nAs a junior in high school in 2011, Jones was one of the top high school hurdlers in the country. He placed third in the New Balance Nationals and then won the USA Track and Field Junior Olympics National Championship in the 110-meter hurdles.\nCollege career.\nJones was a four-year starter at cornerback at Auburn, and saw his first action as a true freshman in 2012. In August 2013, Jones broke his ankle and played in only five games his sophomore season. In 2014, he earned second-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) honors and was ninth in the nation with six interceptions and 17 passes defended, he would again earn second-team All-SEC notice during his 2015 senior year. He had 129 career tackles and seven interceptions in his four years with the Tigers.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nJones was projected to be a fourth or fifth round draft pick by NFL draft experts and analysts, but went undrafted in the 2016 NFL Draft possibly due to his lack of height, despite an impressive combine, being a top performer at the 40-yard dash and bench press. \n2016.\nOn May 1, 2016, the New England Patriots signed Jones to a three-year, $1.63 million contract as an undrafted free agent that included a signing bonus of $10,000.\nHe had a strong training camp and preseason edging out fellow undrafted rookie Cre'Von LeBlanc and 2015 seventh-round pick Darryl Roberts for the final cornerback spot on the Patriots 53-man roster thanks to his special teams contributions. Jones saw his first game action in the Patriots season opener against the Arizona Cardinals and recorded a tackle.\nIn Week 14 against the Ravens, Jones stopped a punt from entering the endzone, pinning the Ravens' offense on the 1-yard line. On the next play, defensive tackle Malcom Brown tackled Ravens' running back Kenneth Dixon in the backfield, resulting in a safety.\nOn February 5, 2017, Jones was part of the Patriots team that won Super Bowl LI. In the game, the Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34–28 in overtime. Coming back from a 25 point deficit in the third quarter.\n2017.\nIn 2017, Jones played in all 16 regular-season games with four starts as the team's nickel cornerback and core special teamer. In Week 8 against the Los Angeles Chargers, Jones intercepted Philip Rivers in the final seconds of the game to close out a 21–13 win. In the divisional round of the playoffs, Jones suffered an ankle injury and was placed on injured reserve on January 17, 2018. The Patriots still made it to Super Bowl LII, but lost 41–33 to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n2018.\nIn the AFC Championship Game for the 2018 season, held on January 20, 2019, the speedy Jones was utilized by the Patriots to shut down the Kansas City Chiefs' Tyreek Hill, who is also known for his speed. Jones was able to match the speed of Hill, and Hill was only targeted three times by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, finishing the game with just one catch. Jones was credited as a 'big reason why' the Patriots beat the Chiefs and secured a spot in Super Bowl LIII. The Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams, 13–3, to give Jones his second Super Bowl championship.\n2019.\nOn March 12, 2019, the Patriots placed a second-round restricted free agent tender on March 12, 2019.\nOn April 15, 2019, Jones re-signed with the Patriots on a one-year deal.\nOn September 7, 2019, Jones signed a three-year, $21 million contract extension with the Patriots, keeping him under contract through the 2022 season.\nIn week 8 against the Cleveland Browns, Jones forced a fumble off running back Nick Chubb which was recovered by teammate Devin McCourty in the 27–13 win.\n2020.\nIn Week 6 against the Denver Broncos, Jones recorded his first interception of the season off a pass thrown by Drew Lock during the 18–12 loss.\n2021.\nIn Week 6, Jones suffered a shoulder injury and was placed on injured reserve on October 23, 2021.\n2022.\nJones returned from his injury in 2022 and started 16 games after switching from slot cornerback to outside cornerback. He set career-highs with 11 passes defensed, four interceptions, and three forced fumbles, all of which led the team.\n2023.\nOn March 13, 2023, Jones re-signed with the Patriots on a two-year deal."

Also Antholz-Anterselva, Italy, withdrew their bid for 2021 championships before the vote took place due to winning of an election for the host of the 2020 event.\nJust before the Biathlon World Championships 2017 in Hochfilzen, Austria, IBU forced Russia to give back rights due to the doping scandal, for revote process after 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Republic of Korea.\nOn 9 September 2018, during the IBU Congress, Pokljuka was named the 2021 event host city without alternative with 49–1 votes.\nRussia doping ban.\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA plans to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2021-2022 World Championships and 2022 Winter Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they will not be permitted to compete in team sports. The title of the neutral banner has yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, on review of Russia's appeal of its case from WADA, ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation.\nBiathletes of the Russian national team perform at the tournament under the monochrome flag of the Russian Biathlon Union (RBU) as part of the RBU team. However, the IBU banned the use of the decoding of the abbreviation - the Russian Biathlon Union.

(NCAA women's volleyball is a fall sport, while NCAA men's volleyball is a spring sport.) In 2012, Beach Volleyball began as a recognized collegiate sport. By 2016 this conference officially began play as one of the firsts in the nation.\nHistory.\nThrough 2010, Big West volleyball teams had earned a combined 22 NCAA final four appearances among four teams.

On June 14, McMahon hit his first career home run. On August 11, with the Rockies trailing 0–2 to the Dodgers in the bottom of the 9th inning, McMahon hit a two-out three-run walk-off home run off Dodgers closer J. T. Chargois to give his team a 3–2 victory. It was McMahon's first career walk-off homerun and came only a day after he had hit another go-ahead home run against the Dodgers that proved to be the game winner.\nIn 2019, McMahon served as the Rockies' primary second baseman, playing other games at first base and third base. He batted .250/.329/.450, and had the highest strikeout percentage in the National League (29.7%). In the shortened 2020 season, McMahon hit .215/.295/.419 with 9 home runs and 26 RBIs in 52 games.\nOn April 6, 2021, in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, McMahon had his first career three home run game, with two solo shots off of starter Luke Weaver and one off of Alex Young. He finished the 2021 season slashing .254/.331/.449 with 23 home runs and a career-high 86 RBIs and 80 runs scored.\nOn March 21, 2022, McMahon signed a six year, $70 million contract extension with the Rockies.

        "text": "The 2016–17 Rugby Pro D2 was the second-level French rugby union club competition, behind the Top 14, for the 2016–17 season. It ran alongside the 2016–17 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nTeams.\nChanges in the lineup from 2015–16 were:\nCompetition format.\nThe top team at the end of the regular season (after all the teams played one another twice, once at home, once away), is declared champion and earns a spot in the next Top 14 season. Teams ranked second to fifth compete in promotion playoffs, with the semifinals being played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final is then played on neutral ground, and the winner earns the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nThe 2016–17 season was the last for the then-current Pro D2 promotion system. From 2017 to 2018 forward, Pro D2 will institute a playoff system identical to the one currently used in Top 14, with the top six teams qualifying for the playoffs and the top two teams receiving byes into the semifinals. The league championship and automatic promotion place will go to the winner of the playoffs; the runner-up will enter a playoff with the second-from-bottom Top 14 team, with the winner of that playoff taking up the final place in Top 14 for the following season.\nRelegation.\nNormally, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to Fédérale 1 at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher-placed team to be demoted instead, or prevent one of the two finalists in Fédérale 1 from promotion.\nPlay–offs.\nThe highest ranked team at the end of the regular season, Oyonnax Rugby, earned automatic promotion to the Top 14 as \"champion de France de PRO D2 2017\".\nSemi–finals.\nThe semi–finals followed a 2 v 5, 3 v 4 system, with the higher ranked team playing at home.\nFinal.\nThe winners of the semi–finals played off for the second promotion spot to the Top 14.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags to the left of player names indicate national team as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules, or primary nationality for players who have not yet earned international senior caps. Players may hold one or more non-WR nationalities."

He caught the eye of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh who proceeded to court Evans' parents. Evans gave his verbal commitment to play football at Michigan two days later. At the time, Evans said, \"If coach Harbaugh thinks you're good, you must be.\"\nAfter accepting an offer from Michigan, Evans was pursued by Ohio State, but he tweeted in early January 2016 that, though he was flattered by Ohio State's interest, he maintained his commitment to Michigan.\nRecruited as an athlete, Evans was known for his versatility, as he saw action in high school at running back, slot receiver and cornerback. During the preseason training camp prior to his freshman year in 2016, Evans drew praise for his explosiveness and speed. Teammate Drake Johnson described him as \"mad athletic\" and \"real smooth . . . like butter smooth, we're just like 'ooh, wow' \", and added, \"He just makes it look smooth and easy. He looks effortless when he does stuff, 'yeah, that was nice.'\"\nEvans has been described as having \"deceptive looks.\" Bob Wojnowski of \"The Detroit News\" wrote: \"He wears glasses (contacts during the game) and has sported a high-top haircut since he was a kid watching Will Smith on “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.”\n2016 season.\nOn September 3, 2016, Evans appeared in his first game for Michigan.

And you didn't get to see everything he can do.\" Mark Snyder of the \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote of the game that \"the spark came from freshman Chris Evans and his wiggle. Evans brought a different dimension than the bruising backs, maybe something U-M hasn’t seen since Denard Robinson.\"\nMitch Albom dubbed Evans \"Captain Fantastic\" and added \"it might be a case of A Star is Born.\" Michigan running backs coach Tyrone Wheatley said of Evans: \"He's like my Steph Curry in the room. Meaning that he can create his own space, can win one-on-ones and, most surprisingly ... I didn't realize how tough he was between the tackles.\"\nOn October 8, 2016, Evans registered his second 100-yard rushing game in a 78-0 victory over Rutgers. Evans led Michigan's rushing attack with 153 yards on 11 carries for an average of 13.9 yards per carry.\nThrough the first six games of the 2016 season, Evans was Michigan's leading rusher with 400 rushing yards and three touchdowns on 48 carries, an average of 8.3 yards per carry.\nIn the 2016 Capital One Orange Bowl, Evans scored a 30-yard touchdown to give his team the lead with less than two minutes to play.

In February 2019, the team released a statement that Evans was no longer with the program. He announced via Twitter that he had \"academic issues\" and planned to continue his career at Michigan. In June, Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed that Evans would be suspended for the 2019 season, but was eligible to return in 2020. It was later announced that Evans would return for the 2020 season as a fifth-year player.\nProfessional career.\n2021.\nEvans was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the sixth round, 202nd overall, of the 2021 NFL Draft.

It was one of the launch titles for both the Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and Neo Geo AES (home) platforms in the United States, the second golf game created by SNK after 1988's \"Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf\", as well as one of the two golf games released for the Neo Geo, with the other one being Nazca Corporation's 1996 \"Neo Turf Masters\".\nIn the game, the players compete with either computer-controlled opponents or against other players in matches across various golf courses set in two country clubs. Despite being initially launched for the Neo Geo MVS, \"Top Player's Golf\" would be later released for both Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD in 1991 and 1994 respectively, and has since been re-released through download services for various consoles, among other ways to play it as of date.\n\"Top Player's Golf\" received mixed reception from critics after its initial launch with praise towards the presentation and digitized voice samples but many were divided in regards to the gameplay and visuals.\nGameplay.\n\"Top Player's Golf\" is a golf game similar to \"Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf\" and other golf titles from the era, where players compete in matches on various golf courses set across two country clubs. There are three game modes and four golfers to choose from at the main menu: Stroke Play is the main single-player mode where one player compete against CPU-controlled opponents in 18 holes. Match Play is similar to the first mode, except that two players compete against each other and the player with the lowest score wins. The last mode, Nassau Game, in which one player competes with either a CPU or another human opponent and the player with the lowest score wins, with events such as longest drive or closest to the pin contests appearing on occasions. Before starting each mode, players have the option of having a caddie for advice and tips in how to complete a course. If a memory card is present, the players are allowed to save their progress and resume into the last course the game saved at.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"Top Player's Golf\" was initially launched for arcades on May 23, 1990. It was also released during the same period for the Neo Geo AES, when the system was originally a rental-only system for video game stores and hotels in Japan before this was later reversed due to high demand and came to the market as a luxury console on July 1, 1991. It was later re-released for the Neo Geo CD on September 9, 1994, as one of the launch titles for the system, featuring an arranged CD-quality soundtrack and other changes. The game has received a re-release in recent years on various digital distribution platforms such as the PlayStation Network, Nintendo eShop and Xbox Live. It was also recently included in the international version of the Neo Geo mini.\nReception.\nIn Japan, \"Game Machine\" listed \"Top Player's Golf\" on their December 15, 1990 issue as being the twentieth most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles such as \"Quiz H.Q.\". The game received mixed reception from critics after its initial launch."

McDonnell did not play in any test matches as New Zealand did not play their first until 1903.\nCareer.\nDescribed as \"tricky and clever\", McDonnell was educated at Wanganui High School and then Te Aute College. McDonnell first played provincially for Hawke's Bay in 1893. The next year he switched to the Wanganui province. He then returned to play for Hawke's Bay in 1895. In 1896 he again represented Wanganui and continued playing in the province until 1900.\nIt was in 1896, the start of his second stint playing for Wanganui that McDonnell became an All Black. He was called into the team to play Queensland in Wellington after the initial pick, Alfred Wilson, became unable to play because of injury. The game was won 9-0. McDonnell did not score any points in his sole appearance.\nAlso in 1896, while playing for Wanganui in a 32-0 win over Manawatu, McDonnell became the first player in New Zealand first class history to score four tries in a game."

        "title": "Hearthstone in esports",
        "text": "Blizzard Entertainment's online collectible card game \"Hearthstone\" became played professionally quickly after its release in March 2014. The game is played as an esport, with high-level tournaments such as Blizzard's official World Championship featuring prize pool of up to $1 million, and livestreamers can earn money streaming gameplay on Twitch.\nHistory of \"Hearthstone\" competition.\n2013.\nThe first \"Hearthstone\" tournament was held at BlizzCon on November 11, 2013, only a few months after the release of the game's closed beta and several months before the official release of the game in March 2014. Blizzard selected eight prominent \"Hearthstone\" players to compete at what they titled the \"Hearthstone Innkeeper's Invitational\". The tournament was won by Artosis, who was subsequently crowned the \"Grandmaster of the Hearth\".\n2014.\nAfter the official release of the in early 2014, more \"Hearthstone\" tournaments followed, including events at EGX Rezzed and DreamHack Bucharest. BlizzCon 2014 featured a \"Hearthstone\" tournament with a $250,000 USD prize pool, the largest up to that point, and players from the Americas, Europe, and Asia qualified for the event through winning regional tournaments.\nIn June 2014, the organization of Assembly Summer 2014, a Finnish qualifying tournament for the International e-Sports Federation's (IeSF) World Championship, sparked controversy when it was announced that tournament would be open for men only. The cause was that the World Championship was also slated to have an all-male line-up, and its qualifying events were subject to the same rules. According to the IeSF, the rule was set in place in order to \"secure traditional sports status\" for esports. The forced gender division was abolished a few days after it was announced for Assembly Summer when the IeSF switched to an \"open for all\" format.\nJune also saw a cheating scandal when Radu \"Rdu\" Dima won first prize and US$10,000 at DreamHack Summer. During Rdu's final match against AmazHS, he got a Battle.net message stating the content of AmazHS' hand. Though the information was no longer relevant in the game, Rdu was upset about the unsolicited help and tournament organizers called for a 20-minute break in which Rdu's \"friend list\" was deleted, though they decided the round was won fairly. Though AmazHS gave his support to Rdu afterward, he stated that DreamHack should have been better at organizing the tournament and implored Blizzard to implement game modes in which such forms of cheating are not possible.\nIn \"Hearthstone\"s first year, a total of 52 tournaments and series awarded US$1,000 or more to individual players. Over the year, over US$1,000,000 worth of prize money was awarded during 2014, large tournaments being the World Championships and the World Cyber Arena. James \"Firebat\" Kostesich was the most successful tournament player, winning a total of US$105,650. Fifteen players made above the United States federal minimum wage through tournaments alone in 2014, and many players make more through livestreaming their \"Hearthstone\" games.\n\"Hearthstone\"'s inaugural World Championship concluded at BlizzCon 2014 and featured a total prize pool of US$250,000 and the Last Hero Standing format. James \"Firebat\" Kostesich defeated Wang \"Tiddler Celestial\" Xieyu in the finals, becoming the first World Champion and earning US$100,000.\n2015.\nIn March 2015, \"Red Bull\"s Jon Partridge stated that \"Hearthstone\" was \"emerging as one of the world's top esports.\" Technology company Nvidia held a professional \"Hearthstone\" tournament series that spanned eight weeks, from the end of March to the middle of May, with a total prize pool of US$25,000. The tournament, which was split up in Professional Division of 16 high-level players and an open worldwide Amateur Division, was a qualifying event of the 2015 World Championship.\nBlizzard's official 2015 \"Hearthstone\" World Championship tournament concluded at BlizzCon 2015. Sixteen players qualified for the event by improving their rankings at Blizzard-sanctioned tournaments. Four players per region eventually qualified for the World Championship by improving their regional rankings in Europe, North and Latin America, China, and Asia-Pacific. This World Championship was the first to be held with the Conquest format with a ban. Swedish player Sebastian \"Ostkaka\" Engwall defeated Canadian player Dylan \"Hotform\" Mullins to earn US$100,000 and the title of World Champion.\n2016.\nIn November 2015, Blizzard announced a change in the \"Hearthstone\" season structure, where the game's esports calendar would be split into Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring seasons, each running for three months. Players have to earn enough HCT points in order to qualify for major tournaments at the end of each season which are held in three of the game's regions. Companies like Kyoto esports, StriveWire, and Zotac host tournaments that give players points to qualify for the seasonal major tournaments. The winners of each tournament qualified automatically for the World Championship. Through this setup, 12 players qualify for the event, while Blizzard appoints four players from China in some other manner. The 2016 \"Hearthstone\" World Tour featured over US$1,900,000 in prize money.\nThe third Hearthstone World Championship was held at BlizzCon 2016 on November 5 with the Conquest format and a prize pool of US$1,000,000, four times as much as in 2015. It was played in a Swiss tournament format and one class could be banned from use by one's opponent. The winner was Russian Pavel \"Pavel\" Beltiukov, who defeated Artem \"DrHippi\" Karevets to earn the top prize of US$250,000.\n2017.\nThe 2017 Hearthstone World Championship is the fourth year of the Hearthstone World Championship. Breaking from the tradition of previous years, the 2017 Hearthstone World Championship took place in January 2018 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, instead of during BlizzCon near the end of the year. The winner was Chen \"Tom60229\" WeiLin from Taiwan, who defeated Frank \"Fr0zen\" Zhang to earn the top prize of US$250,000.\n2018.\nThe 2018 Hearthstone World Championship will be the Hearthstone Championship Tour's final event and was held in April 2019 in Taipei, Taiwan with a $1 million prize pool. The fifth Hearthstone World Championship winner was Norwegian Casper \"Hunterace\" Notto that received $250,000.\n2019.\nBlizzard is replacing the previously used tour system with three variations of a single class deck called \"Specialist\". More than $4 million will be available in the prize pool. Blizzard will hold the first tournaments primarily online and will be region-locked. The winners will go on to compete in the live global tournaments throughout 2019. The fifth Hearthstone World Championship took place in April 2019 and was held in Taipei; the winner was Norwegian Casper \"Hunterace\" Notto that received $250,000.\nGrandmasters Season 2 will remove the Specialist format used in Season 1. Instead, players will bring four decks, each from a different class. Before the match begins, each player chooses a deck to \"shield\", which means the other player cannot ban it. Then each player will ban one deck from the opponent. If a player wins with a deck, then the next match another deck must be played. If a player loses, then they can replay the deck.\nIn October 2019, Blizzard announced it would ban a player for one year from competing and forfeited all of his winnings earned during Season 2 because he spoke in support of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests during a tournament interview, which violated the rule against promoting a political stance during a broadcast. A few days later, Blizzard revised its decision so it gave back the prize money and reduced the suspension to six months.\nThe sixth Hearthstone World Championship winner was Chinese Xiaomeng \"VKLiooon\" Li, who lives in China that received $200,000; VKLiooon was also the first woman to win a Hearthstone world championship and to win a BlizzCon tournament.\n2020.\nThe seventh Hearthstone World Championship winner was Japanese Kenta \"Glory\" Sato that received $200,000.\n2021.\nThe eighth Hearthstone World Championship winner was Japanese Wataru \"Posesi\" Ishibashi that received $200,000. He defeated the 2020 Hearthstone World Champion, Kenta \"Glory\" Sato, in the final round to win the title. This was also the first ever time that the defending champion qualified for the next World Championship tournament, but Kenta \"Glory\" Sato ended up just one series away from winning it back-to-back.\n2022.\nThe ninth Hearthstone World Championship winner was German Raphael \"Bunnyhoppor\" Peltzer that received $100,000. He defeated Jack \"DeadDraw\" Bancroft, who is his teammate in Team Liquid, in the final. The defending champion Wataru \"Posesi\" Ishibashi also qualified for the tournament and he ended up losing in the quarterfinal.\n2023.\nThe tenth Hearthstone World Championship winner was British Thomas \"PocketTrain\" Swinton that received $100,000. He defeated \"CJkaka\" from Taiwan in the final. En route he defeated fellow countryman, practice partner and sometimes friend British Thomas \"Meati\" Wayland.\nStreaming.\nFor many professional \"Hearthstone\" players, rather than tournament earnings, livestreaming is their main source of income. In 2014, Kinguin project coordinator Giovanni Varriale stated that \"Hearthstone\" was one of the most popular games on Twitch, with \"thousands of people spend[ing] hours watching the best players in action.\"\nGame design.\n\"Hearthstone\" is a digital and online card game, comparable to traditional collectible card games such as \"\".\nExpansions.\nThe game features a large amount of inherent randomness as calculated through a random number generator (a property referred to as \"RNG\"). Some cards may have excessively random effects and may be able to completely sway a game through RNG. Various fans are worried about the future of the game's competitive scene due to unbalanced cards being introduced in new expansions. In an interview with \"Polygon\", \"Hearthstone\" associate designer Dean Ayala stated that newly introduced cards can add to the strategy of the game, and that expanding \"Hearthstone\" is \"all about finding the balance with what is ok and what isn't ok.\" Ayala explained that a large part of adding new cards to the game is trying to view each card through the lens of each possible type of player and how the card may be used.\nCulture.\nThe practice of \"win trading\", where players forfeit games in order to help other players gain in ranking, can be used to reach Legend ranking with less effort. However, win trading is considered cheating, and Blizzard gives out permanent bans for people who indulge in the practice.\nIn 2014, professional coaching services became popular, where high-level players discuss strategies with their clients and give tips for improvement. Nathan 'ThatsAdmirable' Zamora stated that the work is his main source of income, and that the service is useful for players that have plateaued and are unsure on how to change their play style.\nIn August 2014, competitive \"Hearthstone\" player Ryan \"Realz\" Masterson was hired by Blizzard in order to help with the balancing of the game.\nControversy.\nDuring a GrandMasters Season 2 match on October 6, 2019, player Chung \"Blitzchung\" Ng Wai made statements in support of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. During a post-match interview on the official Taiwanese broadcast, Blitzchung wore ski goggles and a respirator mask similarly to the protesters, and used the popular pro-democracy slogan \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\". Blizzard considered the gesture to be a violation of rules forbidding players from engaging in conduct that \"brings [the player] into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public or otherwise damages\" the reputation of the company. As a result, Blizzard removed Blitzchung from the tournament, rescinded his Season 2 prize winnings, and banned him from \"Hearthstone\" competitions for one year. Blizzard also terminated its contract with the two casters involved in the broadcast. Blizzard stated that while it \"[stands] by one's right to express individual thoughts and opinions\", players were still subject to their official rules and regulations during competition.\nThe removal of Blitzchung led to criticism of Blizzard and calls for a boycott of the company. As coverage of the protests have been subject to censorship in mainland China, critics considered the decision to be an act of self-censorship intended to appease Chinese investors and stakeholders. Chinese conglomerate Tencent owns a minority stake in Activision Blizzard. Comparisons were also drawn with a recent controversy involving Daryl Morey, owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team, over a Twitter posting that similarly pledged support for the protests. The developers of the similar game \"Gods Unchained\" invited Blitzchung to its own tournament, offering to also repay the winnings that Blizzard had rescinded."

Organised by the Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and backed by Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the plot is thought to have targeted the England–Tunisia match on 15 June 1998, and involved infiltrating the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille in order to attack players and spectators during the game, attack the hotel in Paris hosting the United States national team, and finally hijacking an aircraft and crashing it into the Civaux Nuclear Power Plant near Poitiers.\nRaids and arrests.\nThe original suspect of the plot was French-Algerian Farid Melouk, who had previously been sentenced \"in absentia\" to seven years in prison in France for his connection to the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings. Melouk had reportedly been tracked by intelligence services following his entry into Belgium, where he was found to be in contact with Ahmed Zaoui and a GIA-linked Brussels mosque. On 3 March, after two weeks of surveillance, 50 police officers stormed a house where Melouk was staying with others involved in the plot. Ten people including Swedish and Danish nationals were arrested in the 12-hour siege, amid a series of anti-terrorism raids in Belgium. Large amounts of liquid explosives were found during the raid, as well as detonators, a Kalashnikov rifle, several handguns and thousands of US dollars in cash. In addition, a large number of documents, brochures and maps relating to the World Cup were retrieved. More explosives were uncovered in a follow-up raid of another house.\nThe March raid was part of a joint security operation between Belgium, France, Sweden, Italy and the United Kingdom. Despite initial Belgian claims denying links to any plot against the World Cup, the plot was later confirmed by the French counter-intelligence chief. Melouk was sentenced to 9 years in prison for charges including attempted murder. In early May, eight suspected militants linked to the plot were arrested in the United Kingdom. \nOn 26 May, 88 people were detained in co-ordinated operations across France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Germany. In France, 53 men including Algerian, French and Tunisian nationals suspected of links to ex-GIA commander Hassan Hattab were detained across 43 locations, including in Marseilles, Paris, Lyon and Corsica; 40 were released within two days. Five Algerians were arrested in Germany after raids across several cities, ten in Belgium, two in Switzerland, six in Italy, and many more detained. The French Interior Minister, Jean-Pierre Chevènement, said on French television after the arrests that investigators had found evidence of plots to attack the World Cup. Islamist paraphernalia and $150,000 in cash were found during the raids, but no explosives or arms. 24 people were taken to trial, of which eight were convicted. Some police sources have said that a goal of the May raids was to crush GIA support networks. According to one counterterrorism official, the resort to mass arrests during this period which included several other cases such as those of the \"Chalabi network\" reflected the need for intelligence about radical Islamist networks. According to a counter-terrorism magistrate, Jean-Louis Bruguière, the May raids were a preventive measure to protect the tournament.\nPlot and aftermath.\nThe plot involved terrorists infiltrating the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille as stadium crew, in order to attack English players and spectators during the England–Tunisia match on 15 June. Terrorists had reportedly planned to blow up the England substitute bench (targeting youngsters David Beckham and Michael Owen), shoot English players and throw grenades into the stands. Other terrorists were then to storm the United States national team's hotel in Paris and attack American players watching the game there. The attacks would be followed by the hijacking of an aircraft by another group of terrorists to be crashed into the Civaux Nuclear Power Plant near Poitiers, causing a nuclear meltdown.\nThe details, and even existence, of the plot were kept secret from managers, players and the media, but were known to security services including The Football Association staff. In 2009, the England manager in 1998, Glenn Hoddle, revealed that he had only been informed of the plot \"years later\", while the FA's Director of Communications during 1998, David Davies, said that he had been informed of the plot before the match by the FA's Head of Security, Brian Hayes. The match was otherwise marred by supporter riots in Marseille, with British vehicles being bricked while bottles were thrown across the streets, causing police to use tear gas as large numbers of supporters were injured and arrested.\nAlthough organised by GIA operatives, the plot reportedly had the backing and support of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Although bin Laden had a rented place in the stands of Arsenal Football Club, he wanted to destroy English football. Laden funded and assisted in the development of the murder plan, promised to provide additional financial support for implementation and weapons, and participated in the training of key GIA individuals at an al-Qaeda training camp. According to the bin Laden biographer, Yossef Bodansky, the World Cup plot being foiled was one of the reasons for \"dormant terrorist networks\" eventually responsible for the August 1998 United States embassy bombings being \"reactivated\".\nA terror plot against the UEFA Euro 2000 was discovered after Dutch intelligence services intercepted calls made between GIA operatives from inside French prisons. Three men were detained in French prisons as a result of the plot, and three were subsequently arrested in the Netherlands. One of the French prisoners detained for the plot was Adel Mechat, who served six years in prison after having been arrested in Germany and extradited to France as part of the 1998 World Cup raids.\nOn the night before the first-ever football match between France and Algeria in October 2001, police seized explosives and arrested four Islamist militants suspected of having targeted the game after a phone call had been intercepted with warnings to stay away from the Stade de France. Other items retrieved included bulletproof vests and explosives manuals. The match itself was marred with controversy and was eventually stopped with 15 minutes playing time left after Algerian fans stormed the field."

        "title": "Stony Brook Seawolves women's basketball",
        "text": "The Stony Brook Seawolves women’s basketball team is the college basketball program representing Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York. The Seawolves currently participate as part of the NCAA Division I basketball, and compete in the Coastal Athletic Association. The Seawolves currently play their home games in the Island Federal Credit Union Arena.\nStony Brook reached the NCAA tournament for the first time in 2021, a year after the team's 28–3 season ended prematurely with the cancelation of the America East Championship and NCAA Tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHistory.\nStony Brook began play in the 1969–70 season at the Division III level. The program advanced to Division II beginning in the 1995–96 year, and fully transitioned to Division I in 1999, hiring Trish Roberts as head coach. \nStony Brook played two independent seasons as before joining the America East Conference in 2001. In Stony Brook's first America East season, the Seawolves finished in seventh place but earned two upsets in the tournament to advance to the finals. Stony Brook almost reached the NCAA Tournament but fell to Hartford 50–47. Roberts failed to reach double-digit victories in her next two seasons and resigned on August 25, 2004. She cited family issues but \"Newsday\" reported that several players left the team and Roberts clashed with first team All-Conference player Sherry Jordan. \nSacramento Monarchs assistant Maura McHugh was named interim head coach on September 10 and promoted to full-time head coach on April 26, 2005 after an 8–20 season. In McHugh's second season, Stony Brook won 20 games for the first time in program history and finished a program-best second place in the regular season. On December 2, 2005, Stony Brook played No. 19 Temple, its first ranked opponent in program history, and pulled the 58–56 upset. The Seawolves lost in the conference semifinals but qualified for the WNIT, where they lost to Hofstra in the program's first-ever postseason appearance. After another second-place finish in the conference regular season in 2006–07 at 14–2, the Seawolves were upset by UMBC in the quarterfinals and McHugh resigned three months later.\nMcHugh's assistant Michele Cherry was named her successor, but Cherry suffered three straight 20-loss seasons and was on course for a fourth before she resigned in the middle of the 2010–11 campaign, leading assistant Evelyn Thompson to handle head coaching duties for the remainder of the season.\nOn April 7, 2011, Canisius associate head coach Beth O'Boyle was named Stony Brook's fourth Division I head coach. O'Boyle went 4–26 in her first season and improved by 10 wins in each of the next two years. She won a program record 24 games in 2013–14 as Stony Brook returned to the America East Championship for the first time since 2002, but were blown out 70–46 by Albany. Stony Brook qualified for the 2014 WNIT and lost to Michigan 86–48 in Ann Arbor. The Wolverines' head coach was former Stony Brook player Kim Barnes Arico. On April 28, 2014, O'Boyle resigned to accept the head coaching position at VCU.\nOn June 15, 2014, Auburn assistant head coach Caroline McCombs was named as O'Boyle's successor. In McCombs' first two seasons, Stony Brook finished with 17 wins and in third place in the America East, earning bids to the WBI both times, losing to Siena in 2015 and Youngstown State in 2016. McCombs became the program's all-time winningest head coach on November 21, 2018 with her 67th win, surpassing Roberts. Stony Brook won its first game against a Power Five school by defeating Penn State 81–70 on November 25, 2018. Her first 20-win season came in 2018–19 but ended in the America East semifinals with a loss to Hartford. McCombs reached 100 career victories on January 2, 2020.\nThe 2019–20 season saw Stony Brook shatter program records, at one point owning a 22-game winning streak, the longest in the nation. Stony Brook defeated Pittsburgh in December for its second program Power Five victory. The Seawolves won their first America East regular season title after defeating Vermont to improve to 25–1 and 13–0 in conference. As the top seed, Stony Brook advanced to the America East Championship with a 28–3 record, set to face Maine at home, but the game was canceled a day before as the COVID-19 pandemic began to sweep through the United States. The Seawolves still earned the America East title as the highest seed remaining.\nStony Brook earned its redemption in the 2020–21 season. The Seawolves, as the second seed in the America East Tournament, earned a bye to the semifinals, routing UMass Lowell to set up a championship rematch with top-seeded Maine. On the road, Stony Brook came back from an 11-point deficit to upset Maine 64–60 and clinch its first trip to the NCAA Tournament in program history. Stony Brook lost 79–44 to Arizona in the first round. McCombs announced on April 2, 2021 that she would be leaving Stony Brook after seven years to be George Washington's new head coach.\nOn April 28, 2021, James Madison assistant Ashley Langford was hired to replace McCombs. In Langford's first season, Stony Brook finished 23–6 with wins over St. John's, Rutgers and Washington State. However, Stony Brook was banned from the America East tournament because the team announced it would be leaving the conference to join the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). Stony Brook was invited to the WNIT, losing at VCU 56–48. In 2022–23, Stony Brook finished 18–13 in its first CAA season, losing to Northeastern in the second round of the conference tournament. Stony Brook won the 2023–24 CAA regular season title by going 25–3 overall and 16–2 in conference. \nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Seawolves have appeared in the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament one time.

No investigative action was taken against coach Scheuerman or varsity players (including All-American Don Nelson). Hawkins was barred from playing in NCAA, NIA, or the NBA due to these allegations until his lawsuit for reinstatement was successful in 1969, and he played with the Phoenix Suns.\nSaint Joseph's University was stripped of its third-place finish in the 1961 NCAA tournament.

During the 1988–89 season, he entered three WPBSA main tour qualifying events, reaching the final of Event 2 of the Pro Ticket Series, where Thai prospect James Wattana defeated him 5–1, and winning his match against Gary Filtness 5–2 in the Professional Play-offs to secure his place on tour.\nCampbell's first season as a professional was underwhelming; early exits in the Hong Kong Open to Les Dodd and in the Asian Open to John Rea were followed by second-round losses in the next four ranking events. In the 1990 European Open, he overcame Pat Houlihan and Dave Gilbert to reach the last 64, but was beaten there 5–4 by John Virgo.\nAt the 1990 Dubai Classic, Campbell produced the best performance of his career, defeating Ken Owers, Craig Edwards and Tony Meo to reach the last 32, where he lost 3–5 to Jason Whittaker; he repeated this feat in that season's European Open, but again could progress no further, losing 2–5 to Steve James.\nCampbell's ranking had improved to 66th for the 1990–91 season, but the next was poor, heralding only three wins from fourteen matches. Having lost all nine of his matches in 1992–93, he did not play professionally again; ranked 158th by that season's conclusion, Campbell was relegated from the tour in 1994."

        "text": "Templeogue Basketball Club is an Irish basketball club based in Dublin. The club has teams competing in Dublin Leagues and National Competitions, with the senior men's representative team, Griffith College Templeogue, playing in the Irish Super League.\nHistory.\nTempleogue Basketball Club was established in 1976 by a group of Past Pupils from Templeogue College. It was not until 2012 that a senior men's team entered one of Ireland's national competitions. For the 2012–13 season, Templeogue entered the National League Division 1 and made their debut on 29 September 2012 against Ulster Elks. After losing their season opener, they won their first match two weeks later. Between October and February, Templeogue remained unbeaten thanks to American import Isaac Gordon. They finished as Division 1 Northern Conference runners-up in 2012–13.\nIn 2013, Templeogue were admitted into the Premier League for the 2013–14 season. The team recruited Conor and Daniel James from UCD Marian to team up with their younger brother Stephen. Their first season in the top league ended with just one win in eighteen games.\nThe 2014–15 season saw Templeogue's Premier League team climb the ladder. After starting their campaign with three straight defeats, Templeogue bounced back to finish the regular season in third place with an 11–7 record. Their strong form at the back end of the season saw coach Mark Keenan and centre Jason Killeen win Coach and Player of the Month respectively for March 2015. They went on to reach the Champions Trophy final, where they were defeated 85–73 by UCC Demons.\nIn 2015–16, Templeogue were undefeated over their first 10 games, but stumbled over their final eight to finish the regular season in third place with a 14–4 record. Their form over the first half of the season saw them reach the National Cup final. There they defeated Swords Thunder 78–75 to claim the first national trophy in club history. The Final MVP was awarded to small forward Michael Bonaparte after he scored 21 points.\nIn 2016–17, Templeogue won their first league title after finishing first on the regular-season table with a 20–2 record. They went on to reach the Champions Trophy final, where they lost to Tralee Warriors.\nIn 2017–18, Templeogue reached the National Cup final for the second time in three years, where they defeated UCD Marian 68–62 behind 23 points from MVP Lorcan Murphy. They went on to reach their third Champions Trophy final in four years, but were once again defeated by Tralee Warriors.\nIn 2018–19, Templeogue were triumphant at last in the Champions Trophy tournament, defeating Belfast Star 77–62 in the final to win their first Champions Trophy title.\nIn 2019–20, Templeogue reached the National Cup final for the third time in five years, where they defeated Éanna 78–68 behind 33 points from MVP Lorcan Murphy."

        "title": "Clock golf",
        "text": "Clock golf is a game based on golf, originating in the mid 19th century. Players putt a golf ball from each in turn of 12 numbered points arranged in a circle as in a clock face, to a single hole placed within the circle. Alternative names include Clock-Golf, Round the Clock Golf, and Golf Around the Clock. \nJaques of London's description suggests that clock golf can be played wherever there is space for \"an approximate circle of 10–30ft in diameter\", and that shrubs and other obstacles can add to the interest. The hole is not placed centrally, so the 12 \"holes\" of the game can be of different lengths. A writer in \"Landscape Architecture Magazine\", 1926, suggests that it needs a circle of 20-24ft, and lists it among \"the lawn sports now commonly played\".\nSHAPE America offered a set of instructions for \"Golf Around the Clock\" as a \"lead-up game\" useful as a preliminary for learners of golf.\nHistory of clock golf.\nThe firm Jaques of London claim that they \"originated the popular garden game of Clock Golf in the mid 19th century\". The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest illustration of the use of the term dates from 1905. The wording on an early boxed set of equipment was \"Clock Golf - A new game for the lawn - Interesting to golfers and a most popular amusement at garden parties\". Metal roman numbers for clock golf have been made by F.H.Ayres of London and Hamleys. The firm of A.G. Spalding of New York manufactured a set using numbers 1–12 around 1900, and in the late 1920s the firm of P.S.P. Inc sold a stylish set of 1–12, painted alternately red and white, presented in a tin under the name \"Round the Clock Golf\".\nThe game has often been offered to hotel guests as an entertainment. A 1905 print of \"Clock golf at the Royal Palm [Hotel], Miami, Fla\" is held by the Library of Congress, and in 1909, \"The New York Times\" reported that 30 guests, both ladies and gentlemen, had taken part in a clock golf tournament at the Pocono Mountain House hotel at Mount Pocono. A 1925 advertisement for a hotel in Bournemouth, England offers \"Croquet, Clock Golf, Billiards, etc.\" while in 2016, a hotel in Scarborough, England says that \"the children's play area, clock golf and putting green, provide plenty of fun activities for children of all ages\" and at one in Silkeborg, Denmark, \"You can also avail yourself of clock golf or the pétanque court.\"\nEnglish novelist E. F. Benson makes reference to clock golf in Chapter 8 of his novel \"Lucia in London\" (1927) in the Mapp and Lucia series. Daisy and Robert Quantock are playing the game on their lawn.\nBritish novelist P. G. Wodehouse makes reference to country house lodgers playing clock golf in \"Summer Moonshine\" (1937). Clock golf is played by the guests of Lord Emsworth in Wodehouses's novel, \"Something Fresh\".\nAgatha Christie's novel \"4:50 from Paddington\" (1957) features a (rusty) clock golf, and the game is played in her novel \"The Seven Dials Mystery\". Christie herself played clock golf at her home Greenway in Devon.\nClock golf was available to passengers on the promenade deck of the Short S.23 flying boat.\nThe first course in Denmark is said to have been at Gråsten Palace where Queen Ingrid enjoyed playing with her family.\nClock golf today.\n Jaques of London still sell equipment for the game, comprising a set of 12 markers numbered I to XII (with spikes on the back for insertion into the lawn), balls, and a pre-formed hole with flag. a Danish firm offered to install a prefabricated clock golf playing area with artificial grass surrounded by a granite border."

        "text": "The Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) is an Australian sports stadium located in Yarra Park in Melbourne, Victoria. The ground was established in 1853 and is the home ground of the Melbourne Cricket Club. It hosted the first match of Test cricket played and has been used for a variety of sports, including acting as the central venue for the 1956 Summer Olympic Games and 2006 Commonwealth Games. It has a spectator capacity of over 90,000, reduced from around 125,000 prior to redevelopments begun in the 1980s, and has been described as \"Australia's premier sporting venue\". The ground hosted the first One Day International in 1971 and its first Twenty20 International (T20I) in 2008 when both a men's and a women's T20I was played on the same day. The first women's international on the ground was played in 1935 and women's ODI cricket has been played on the ground. It has hosted the finals of the 1988 Women's Cricket World Cup, the 1992 and 2015 Men's World Cups, the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup and the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. This article details the five-wicket hauls taken on the ground in official international Test and One Day International matches.\nThe first five-wicket hauls in international cricket were taken in the 1877 Test match at the MCG. Three bowlers took five wickets in an innings in the match, Australia's Billy Midwinter taking the first five-wicket haul in the second innings of the match. England's Alfred Shaw and Australia's Tom Kendall also took five-wicket hauls during the match. The best bowling figures in a Test match innings on the ground are the nine wickets for the cost of 86 runs (9/86) taken by Pakistan's Sarfraz Nawaz against Australia in 1979 in what was described by \"Wisden\" as \"one of the greatest bowling feats in the history of Test cricket\". The best bowling on the ground by an Australian is the 9/121 taken by Arthur Mailey against England in 1921. Australia's Peggy Antonio took the only five-wicket haul in women's international cricket on the ground in 1934 in a Test match against England.\nThe first five-wicket haul in an ODI on the ground was taken by Pakistan's Abdul Qadir against Australia in 1984. The best ODI bowling figures at the MCG are the 6/42 taken by both Ajit Agarkar in 2004 and Yuzvendra Chahal in 2019. At the time these were the best bowling figures in an ODI in Australia.\nTest match five-wicket hauls.\nThere have been a total of 172 five-wicket hauls taken at the MCG in Test matches, one of which was taken in a women's Test match.\nOne Day International five-wicket hauls.\nOne Day International matches have seen 21 five-wicket hauls taken on the ground, all of them in men's matches."

Since the team's establishment in 2012 (following a predecessor team that existed from 1996 until 2012), it has been very successful, including a pair of ACHA second-place finishes at the Division 2 level in 2012–13 and 2013–14 and an appearance at the ACHA Division 1 national championship tournament to close the 2014–15 season. PSU is one of just three teams to appear in consecutive ACHA Division 2 championship games, joining the University of Minnesota-Duluth (2007–08) and Rainy River Community College (2008–11).\nJeremy Bean became the Lady Ice Lions' second head coach since the team's founding in 2017–18, as he took over for 2013–14 ACHA Division 2 Coach of the Year winner Patrick Fung.\nHistory.\nThe Lady Icers (1996–2012).\nPenn State's first women's hockey team – called the \"Lady Icers\" – began play in the 1996–97 season, after students Ellen Bradley and Kathy Beckford recruited players from around campus and Vinnie Scalamogna, the assistant manager of the Penn State Ice Pavilion (then the university's sole ice facility), as coach. The Lady Icers' first game, a 5–4 win over the Susquehanna Rockettes (an adult club team), took place on February 1, 1997.\nThe Lady Icers' most successful period began in 1999–2000 when it joined a conference known as the Mid-Atlantic Women's Collegiate Hockey Association along with many of the university's traditional rivals from other sports like the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Maryland, and Syracuse University, and ran up a perfect 8–0–0 league mark in the regular season, then defeated Pittsburgh 2–0 in the MAWCHA playoff championship game. Penn State would go on to repeat as MAWCHA regular season champions in 2000–01 and take the Delaware Valley Collegiate Hockey Conference regular season and playoff titles in 2002–03.\nIn 2000, the ACHA initiated its first women's division, with the Lady Icers as one of its inaugural members (the team would play in what was the ACHA's sole women's division through the 2005–06 season, and subsequently in Division 1 after the ACHA formed a second women's division). PSU participated in each of the ACHA's first four women's national championship tournaments (and six overall), peaking with a third-place finish in 2002's edition led by coach Billie Willits. The stars of that 2001–02 team included ACHA player of the year and tournament most valuable player Andrea Lavelle, as well as Katie King, who finished her career in 2005 as the top scorer in Lady Icers history.\nThe team helped launch the ECWHL in 2003 and would remain in the conference through the rest of its years in the ACHA. However, PSU struggled competitively through the middle part of the 2000s, thanks to issues with recruitment and retention, coaching continuity and cash flow – including a low point when the Lady Icers had to cancel a trip to the 2007 ECWHL playoffs for financial reasons. Mo Stroemel began his four years as head coach in the 2007–08 season, and is credited with stabilizing the club. Under Stroemel's watch, the Lady Icers made a final ACHA National Tournament appearance in 2010.\nAfter years of speculation the program transitioned to the NCAA Division I level along with the PSU men's ice hockey team for the 2012–13 season. The move was made possible thanks to a Penn State-record $88 million (later increased to $102 million) donation from Terry Pegula (a Penn State alumnus and billionaire hockey fan) and his wife Kim. The gift, announced on September 17, 2010, primarily was used to finance the construction of a new ice arena and endow scholarships.\nPenn State temporarily concluded its time in ACHA Division 1 in February 2012, with eventual NCAA team head coach Josh Brandwene behind the bench. That season, the Lady Icers played a mixed schedule, featuring ACHA and ECWHL opponents as well as eleven games against NCAA Division I and Division III teams – highlighted by Tess Weaver's overtime goal in an upset of NCAA Division I Sacred Heart on January 14, 2012. The team finished the year by claiming the ECWHL regular season title, but then losing to Rhode Island in the ECWHL playoff championship game.\nA new era begins (2012–2014).\nWhen the Lady Icers evolved to NCAA status following the 2011–12 season, several former members of that team who were not a part of the NCAA roster formed a new ACHA team at the Division 2 level during the summer of 2012. Mary Kate Tonetti led the push – an effort that would later help her win the ACHA's Off-Ice MVP Award for the 2012–13 season – along with 2011–12 Lady Icers teammates Carly Szyszko, Allie Rothman, Katie Vaughan, Ashton Schaffer and Sarah Eisenhut. Former Lady Icers assistant Patrick Fung was eventually brought on as head coach, while freshmen like Devon Fisk, Mandy Mortach, Jackie Saideh, Nina Elia and Tara Soukup helped fill out a small roster that included just 13 players when the re-christened team played its first-ever game, a 2–1 overtime loss to California (PA) at BladeRunners Ice Complex in Bethel Park, PA.\nPenn State's home rink in 2012–13, purportedly, was the same Penn State Ice Pavilion used by the Lady Icers. However, while the team did practice there (using a makeshift locker room with large sheets for walls), their status as a late-arriving first-year team, coupled with scheduling congestion at the soon-to-be-decommissioned single-sheet facility then hosting four intercollegiate hockey teams and other events, meant that they did not play a single on-campus home game. PSU did manage one off-campus home contest, a blowout of Slippery Rock on December 9, 2012, at Galactic Ice in nearby Altoona, PA. The twin themes of a thin schedule entirely on the road and a light roster would dominate most of the regular season, although key wins over Michigan State and particularly over West Chester (then the second-ranked team in the East Region, one of two in ACHA Division 2) helped Penn State sneak into the ACHA National Tournament as the number four team in the East Region, the final available bid.\nFew anticipated what came next at the tournament, held at the Ashburn Ice House in Ashburn, VA from March 7–10, 2013: wins over West No. 1 Alaska (2–1) and defending Division 2 national champion Wisconsin-Stout (3–1) on the first two days of the championships. With the top seed in the semifinals already secure after just the pair of games, the Lady Ice Lions tied with North Dakota State (3–3) to close the pool round of the tournament. In the semis, PSU once again ran into UW-Stout, a game that stands as one of the signature contests in team history. With the Blue Devils leading 1–0 midway through the third period, a Soukup shot on the power play from the top of the left circle flew through Fisk and past Stout goalie Kaye Collier. Following the remainder of regulation, a five-minute first overtime and nearly four minutes of a second one, Elia pushed home a third-chance transition goal after tries by Fisk and Elizabeth Denis to send the team to the national championship game. The run ended one win short however, as West Chester overturned an early 2–0 Penn State lead and took the title with a 5–2 victory.\nThe 2013–14 season was marked by both continuity and change. Nearly all of the senior-free 2012–13 squad returned (with second-leading scorer Mortach a notable exception), this time with a little bit of depth, thanks to a strong freshman class including future captains Lucy Yeatman, Anna Marcus and Cassie Dunne. Newness came in form of the Penn State's joining a conference for the first time, College Hockey East (CHE), a league that included Cal, West Chester and Delaware and guaranteed a robust schedule. PSU's other major issue during 2012–13 was cured with the opening of $90 million Pegula Ice Arena, a twin-sheet facility that allowed the team a permanent locker room and largely cured scheduling headaches. The Lady Ice Lions played the first intercollegiate hockey game in the arena's history, topping Liberty on September 27, 2013.\nOther than, notably, an intense rivalry with Cal that saw the teams split six overall meetings in 2013–14, high expectations and the remainder of the schedule proved no burden as Penn State ran up a 14–2–2 regular season record, 6–2–2 of which came within the CHE to take the league's regular-season title. Although the Vulcans defeated the Lady Ice Lions in the CHE's playoff championship game, a bid to the 2014 ACHA National Tournament at Fred Rust Ice Arena in Newark, DE was expected, with PSU placing in ACHA Division 2's East Region's top two during every 2013–14 ranking period (in stark contrast to the previous season).\nAt nationals a familiar pattern emerged, as Penn State opened with another tight win over Alaska (3–2), then topped Delaware (3–0) to once again wrap up a trip to the semifinals in short order. This time though, the repeat low-stakes game against NDSU and eventual Zoë M. Harris Player of the Year Kacie Johnson resulted in a dominating 5–2 Penn State win featuring two goals by Marcus. Fisk then added her own brace, with Vaughan making 20 necessary saves, as the Lady Ice Lions held on for a 2–1 victory over frequent nemesis Cal to head back to the ACHA Division 2 championship game. However, PSU once again came up short in the final, this time to Iowa State and tournament MVP Millie Luedtke, who scored the game's only goal on the power play with 7:21 remaining in the third period.\nElevation to ACHA Division 1 (2014–2017).\nFollowing the quick success of consecutive second-place finishes in ACHA Division 2, Penn State elected to move back to ACHA Division 1 for the 2014–15 season. As part of the jump, the team initiated membership in the ECWHL, significant as the league occupied by the previous Lady Icers team from 2003 to 2012.\nCoinciding with the division change, the Lady Ice Lions received a significant boost in the effort to succeed in Division 1 in the form of four players cut from PSU's NCAA Division I team during the 2014 offseason: forwards Darby Kern, Cara Mendelson and Katie Murphy, along with defenseman Madison Smiddy. Mendelson, Murphy and Smiddy had spent their freshman years in 2011–12 as Lady Icers before joining the NCAA team for two seasons, while Kern was a year younger with no prior ACHA experience. A fifth NCAA cut, Jessica Desorcie, also joined the Women's Ice Hockey Club as an assistant coach. Numerous key players from the Division 2 seasons also remained, including Fisk, Schaffer, Saideh, Elia and Tonetti, while the regular incoming class was highlighted by Kelly Watson, Riley O'Connor, Claire Gauthier and Tarika Embar. Tonetti, despite being a senior, was also an addition in a sense, as she was finally able to move back to her natural goaltending position after two years playing forward in order to balance out the occasionally-wobbly roster count.\nEven with the team's rapid growth, an uneven start to the season followed, as an opening sweep at Vermont was tailed by a somewhat uninspiring pair of wins against Delaware (now in a lower division, of course) and a goal-less weekend at Massachusetts. Slowly but surely though, big wins started rolling in. The first major blow was a 3–2 win over Rhode Island on November 9, 2014, and a 2–1 overtime result against UMass followed on January 10, 2015. The Rams were fourth in the ACHA rankings at the time of the meeting, while the Minutewomen were fifth.\nThe biggest though, by far, was a 4–3 victory over top-ranked Miami on January 18, 2015. Smiddy scored twice in the victory, including the opening goal and the game winner with 3:16 left. Saideh and O'Connor also scored goals that stalled the hosts' momentum at crucial points, while Tonetti offered 33 saves in one of the best performances of her career. Prior to the PSU win, the RedHawks had a 31-game unbeaten streak dating back 359 days, as well as a 25-game unbeaten streak at Goggin Ice Center. Additionally, MU had been the number one team in every ACHA Division 1 ranking issued since the beginning of the 2013–14 season (a streak that would last until that October) and had won the 2014 ACHA Division 1 title to initiate a run of three straight ACHA championship games (winning again in 2016).\nThanks largely to the Miami win – and despite a loss to URI in the ECWHL playoff semifinals that nearly undid everything – Penn State qualified for the 2015 ACHA National Tournament at York City Ice Arena in York, PA. However, the team saw a quicker exit than had been customary to that point, losing in overtime to eventual champion Liberty, followed by ties with UMass and Grand Valley State to drop out of the running after the pool round. On an individual level, Kern collected 61 points (on 34 goals and 27 assists) to lead the nation in scoring while being named as a finalist for the Zoë M. Harris Award and taking PSU's first First Team All-American award at the Division 1 level.\nAlthough Kern returned for a senior year in 2015–16 and once again posted stellar numbers (46 points, again among the national leaders), the Lady Ice Lions found their roster turnover too heavy to overcome and took the first step backward in team history, stumbling to a 5–20–2 overall record and finishing unranked. Critical personnel holes included the graduations of Tonetti, Smiddy, Murphy, Mendelson, captain Kim Badorrek and Taylor Nyman (followed by the graduations of Fisk and Schaffer in December 2015, midway through the season) as the team struggled on both ends of the ice – allowing 5.15 goals per game over the course of the year, while enduring a goal drought spanning three full games and parts of two others from November 13, 2015, through January 9, 2016. One highlight came on January 9, 2016, in the form of an overtime victory over eventual ECWHL playoff champion UMass.\nSeason by season results.\nLady Icers.\n† Although Penn State qualified for the 2010 ECWHL playoffs and was slated to play Massachusetts in the semifinals, the team was unable to travel to hosting Rhode Island due to weather concerns, resulting in UMass' automatic advancement to the championship game.\n‡ In the 2007 ECWHL playoffs, Penn State was originally scheduled to play Rhode Island in the semifinal round. However, PSU was unable to travel to the playoffs due to budgetary reasons, resulting in URI's automatic advancement to the championship game.\nProgram records.\nAs of February 28, 2017.\nSources:\nWomen's Ice Hockey Club.\nCareer scoring leaders.\n^ Lady Ice Lions players who spent part of their careers with the Lady Icers program in 2010–11 and 2011–12 have statistics from the previous team included.\nNotable goaltenders.\n^ Lady Ice Lions players who spent part of their careers with the Lady Icers program in 2010–11 and 2011–12 have statistics from the previous team included.\nACHA ranking history.\nWomen's Ice Hockey Club.\nACHA Division 1.\nACHA Division 1 rankings were issued five times per year in both 2014–15 and 2015–16, with the top eight in the fourth in-season ranking (fifth overall), released in February, receiving a bid to the ACHA National Tournament. Beginning with the 2016–17 season, the ACHA tabulated rankings each week during the season and issued them on Tuesdays following weekends including games.\nACHA Division 2.\nDuring both of Penn State's seasons in Division 2, every division team was assigned to either the East Region (as PSU was) or the West Region. Rankings were issued quarterly during the season. The fourth and final ranking, released in February, determined bids to and seeding for the ACHA National Tournament, with the top four teams in each region receiving invitations.\nLady Icers.\nNational rankings.\nThe ACHA began compiling a national ranking in 2003–04, issued four times per season, with the top twelve (from 2003–04 through 2008–09) or eight (from 2009–10 through 2011–12) in the fourth ranking, released in February, receiving a bid to the ACHA National Tournament.\nRegional rankings.\nFrom 2000–01 through 2002–03, regional rankings were the sole method for determining ACHA National Tournament bids. The inaugural 2000–01 season featured teams divided into East and West Regions, with the top four from each in February's final ranking invited to nationals. For 2001–02 and 2002–03, the setup was expanded to include East, Central and West Regions. Under that system, the top two from each region were invited to nationals, along with two wild card teams. In 2003–04, the tournament field was expanded to 12 teams, and a national ranking was introduced. The latter development diminished the importance of the regional rankings, as the national rankings were used to determine nationals bids. Regional champions were still awarded an autobid, however, even if ranked outside of the top 12 nationally. In 2004–05, growth in the number of ACHA women's teams resulted in an increase to four regions – Northeast, Southeast, Central and West – although things reverted to East, Central and West in 2007–08. The 2009–10 season was notable both for the fact that the tournament field was reduced back to eight teams and as the final year of the regional system, which had become largely antiquated as regional champions generally had little issue placing highly in the national rankings.\nThe Lady Icers were placed in the East or Southeast Region for the duration of the regional ranking's existence.\nACHA national honors.\nWomen's Ice Hockey Club.\nAnnual Awards.\nAwards earned during the 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons were in ACHA Division 2, all others were in ACHA Division 1\nCoach of the Year\nOff-Ice Most Valuable Player\nACHA Community Playmaker\nAcademic All-American\nFirst Team All-American\nSecond Team All-American\nAll-American Honorable Mention\nFirst Team All-Tournament\nSecond Team All-Tournament\nMonthly awards.\nDuring the 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons, the ACHA presented a series of monthly awards for both men's and women's divisions.\nHarrow Player of the Month\nWarrior Goaltender of the Month\nSher-Wood Freshman Spotlight\nGreat Skate Sportsmanship Award\nGongshow Stars in the Community\nLady Icers.\nZoe M.

Penn State has one of the ACHA's strongest track records for selection and, as of 2017, is one of just two schools to send at least one player to each of the four WUG women's tournaments entered by the United States and boasts nine total selections when including players and coaches. Four Lady Icers players and head coach Mo Stroemel were part of the 2011 squad that finished fourth in Erzurum, Turkey during USA Hockey's first trip to WUG. Goaltender Katie Vaughan was among those picked in 2011, and when she earned a repeat spot at the 2013 World University Games in Trentino, Italy, she officially became the first Lady Ice Lions-era player to participate in the event (Stroemel also returned to coach in 2013 but did not hold an official role with the Women's Ice Hockey Club at that time).\nVaughan went on to make history as an integral part of the second American squad in history to win a WUG medal by taking the bronze (a men's Team USA also won bronze in 1972, although they did so by finishing third in a three-team tournament), and the first group of women or men to do so since the ACHA began stocking the teams, an era that began in 2001 on the men's side. In Team USA's opening game in Trentino, on December 10, 2013, Vaughan made 33 saves in a 4–2 win to outduel Russian goalie Anna Prugova, who regularly competed for the senior Russia women's national ice hockey team, including at both the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics. Russia's roster also included several other regulars with the nation's lead national team, including Yekaterina Nikolayeva and Anna Shukina. Although Russia bounced back to top Team USA in a shootout in the tournament semifinals, the Americans recovered to defeat Japan 3–1 for the bronze medal – thanks to another stellar effort from the Penn Stater, with 37 saves on 38 Japanese shots.\nUSA Hockey honored Vaughan as its 2014 Adult Player of the Year thanks to her play at the World University Games.\nIn 2017, defenseman Cassie Dunne represented Penn State on Team USA in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Dunne, who was selected as a co-captain of the squad, and her teammates managed to repeat the 2013 podium finish by shutting out China 3–0 in the bronze medal match on February 6, 2017. Another key win for Team USA came on January 31, 2017, by a 3–2 count over a Japan team that featured several regulars for the Japan women's national ice hockey team, including Suzuka Taka and Yukiko Kawashima. That victory, in essence, allowed the Americans to advance to the tournament semifinals ahead of Japan.\nMadison Smiddy was Penn State's sole selection to Team USA for the 2015 World University Games in Granada, Spain. While Smiddy's iteration of the squad was the only one since 2011 to not make it to the semifinals, finishing fifth, the defenseman did play a key role in her side's biggest highlight by assisting on Emily Ford's overtime goal that capped a come-from-behind win over Kazakhstan. Smiddy finished WUG among the team leaders in defense scoring and plus-minus rating.\n2010 ACHA women's select team.\nAs a precursor to World University Games participation, the ACHA assembled a women's select team that toured Geneva, Switzerland, Chamonix, France and Méribel, France during April 2010. The team included Lady Icers players Sara Chroman, Heather Rossi and Denise Rohlik. Its final record overseas was 2–2–0, including two close losses to the France women's national ice hockey team and two decisive wins over local club teams.\nRivalries.\nRhode Island.\nRather infamously, from a Penn State perspective, the former Lady Icers team struggled mightily with perennial contender Rhode Island while both were ECWHL members from 2003 to 2012, with the Rams owning a 34–2–1 record against PSU during that time. Early in the Women's Ice Hockey Club's first ACHA Division 1 season, the newer team gave some indication of a change in era by earning a 3–2 win on November 9, 2014, at Bradford R. Boss Arena to split the teams' first-ever series. Cara Mendelson, Anna Marcus and Riley O'Connor scored for the Lady Ice Lions, with the latter's game-winning goal helping her subsequently collect ACHA rookie of the month honors. By the end of 2014–15, both PSU and URI found themselves on the bubble to receive one of the eight bids to the ACHA National Tournament given based on the end-of-season D1 rankings. With an automatic bid set to go outside of the top eight to the Western Women's Collegiate Hockey League champion and the Lady Ice Lions and Rams entering an ECWHL semifinal matchup during the weekend before that decisive poll ranked eighth and seventh, respectively, the result of the game was seen as effectively deciding a tournament bid. The victorious team would not only have that final word of course, but also the head-to-head advantage in the three-game season series. However, although Rhode Island won the game 4–1 with Kristy Kennedy scoring twice in the late going, Penn State was still selected for nationals while URI was left out for the first time since 2003.\nWhatever payback was owed for the nationals bid was exacted pretty thoroughly during the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons, as a resurgent Rams team topped a struggling PSU in all ten meetings during those years, including second and third consecutive victories in the ECWHL semifinals.\nMassachusetts.\nUMass has been arguably the ECWHL's top team since Penn State's re-entry through the Women's Ice Hockey Club, with league playoff titles and ACHA tournament bids in 2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17. Still, PSU has managed a pair of overtime wins against the Minutewomen in twelve regular season meetings. The first was on the strength of Mendelson's winner on January 10, 2015, with the 2–1 victory against then-fifth-ranked UMass a hefty pillar in the Lady Ice Lions' case for eventual inclusion in the 2015 ACHA National Tournament. Almost exactly one year later, on January 9, 2016, and with the Minutewomen again holding down the five spot in the ACHA rankings, Darian Dempsey provided the knockout punch in a 4–3 contest that saw PSU come back from a 3–1 deficit. Liz Tuorinsky forced the extra period on a blast from the point with 1:46 left in regulation. UMass, however, took the other ends of each of those series at Pegula Ice Arena in narrow decisions and has won each of the six games played at their home William D. Mullins Center.\nThe Minutewomen are the only ECWHL team Penn State has faced at the ACHA National Tournament in the post-2012 era. In that game, on March 5, 2015, the Lady Ice Lions ran out to a 3–1 lead after two periods but had to settle for a 3–3 tie after UMass' Amanda Abromson scored with 1:04 left in regulation.\nCalifornia (PA).\nThe Women's Ice Hockey Club's first-ever games were a pair of losses at Cal on October 6 and 7, 2012, but the rivalry between the teams didn't fully ramp up until both joined the newly formed women's division of College Hockey East in 2013–14. The Lady Ice Lions and Vulcans spent that entire campaign jockeying for first place in the conference, first place in ACHA Division 2's East Region and, of course, with each other. During the regular season, the teams split a pair of games at Cal's Rostraver Ice Garden in October, then another pair late in the year at Pegula Ice Arena. The final game of those four, a 3–1 Penn State win on February 1, 2014, clinched the CHE regular season championship for the Lady Ice Lions after the Vulcans had put that outcome in doubt with a heated 5–2 win the night before. However, Cal forced a different sort of split – in the CHE titles – with a 2–1 win over PSU in the league playoff final at York City Ice Arena in York, PA behind a goal and an assist from Megan Cooper, which also enabled the western Pennsylvanians to finish with the East Region's top seed heading into the ACHA National Tournament. At nationals though, Penn State would manage the last word by getting a pair of first-period Devon Fisk tallies and hanging on to end the Vulcans' season in the ACHA semifinals.\nThe Vulcans hold the series advantage with a 5–3–0 record, as the two teams have not played since PSU's move to ACHA Division 1 and out of the CHE following the 2013–14 season.\nWest Chester.\nLate in the Lady Ice Lions' first season, 2012–13, the team managed a road split with West Chester, the squad then ranked second in ACHA Division 2's East Region. In the victory, by a 2–1 count on January 26, 2013, Fisk and Tara Soukup offered goals, while Katie Vaughan made 24 saves. With only three other wins against two other ACHA opponents during an abbreviated regular season and neither of those victims finishing higher than seventh in their region, the WCU win constituted a major reason for Penn State's inclusion in the 2013 ACHA National Tournament as one of the top four in the East Region. The Rams, however, won the season's rubber and most important match by ending PSU's Cinderella tournament run with a 5–2 victory in the national championship game on March 10, 2013, behind three goals from Zoë M. Harris Player of the Year and eventual tournament MVP Becky Dobson.\nThe following season, West Chester joined CHE along with Penn State and Cal and played four more games against the Lady Ice Lions. The first two of those, at Pegula Ice Arena on November 9 and 10, 2013, saw PSU gain a measure of revenge with decisive 3–0 and 6–3 wins in a powder keg of a series that saw three Elizabeth Denis goals as well as a fight between Soukup and Dobson.\nLike the California (PA) series, the West Chester rivalry has been dormant since Penn State's move to ACHA Division 1 with the record presently 4–2–1 in PSU's favor.\nBuffalo.\nThanks in part to a weather-related cancellation in 2013 and a shift of Buffalo's team from ACHA Division 1 to Division 2 during the same 2014 offseason that saw the Women's Ice Hockey Club move from Division 2 to Division 1, PSU has not met UB since a Lady Icers sweep at the Ice Pavilion on September 30 and October 1, 2011. However, prior to 2011 when the teams played regularly (including as ECWHL rivals for eight seasons), an intense rivalry existed. On December 1, 2001, Penn State and Buffalo (then known as the \"Freeze\") engaged in a post-game brawl. The ACHA issued suspensions for four players from each team, each of which were for one game, except for a five-game ban handed to Lady Icers superstar Andrea Lavelle, who \"was clearly an instigator in the situation and refused to obey the repeated directions of the referees to vacate the area\". Penn State-Buffalo contests in the aftermath of the brawl saw vulgar insults traded between players and fans.\nPlayers.\nCurrent roster.\nAs of November 23, 2017."

        "text": "Craig Barnett is a Canadian ice hockey former player and head coach and current Commissioner of both the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association and Pennsylvania Interscholastic Hockey League as well as the director of player personnel for the North American Hockey League\nCareer.\nCraig Barnett began his college career at SUNY-Plattsburgh in 1984 after spending three seasons with the Oakville Blades. After redshirting his first year he joined the Cardinals and helped them to their first title game in 1986 as well as a national title the following year. Though the championship was later vacated Barnett had already embarked on his professional career. After two years as a minor-leaguer (mostly for the ECHL's Erie Panthers) Barnett retired as a player and began his coaching career.\nBarnett's first gig came with Mercyhurst as both an assistant coach and director of the Mercyhurst Ice Center. After two years he transitioned to Division I Kent State, again as an assistant, before being hired by Findlay as the program's first head coach. The Oilers started as a Division II program in 1996, playing as an independent squad for two years before joining the MCHA as a founding member and winning the first conference title in 1998–99 with a 23–5 record. After their first successful season Findlay was a surprise addition to the premier lineup of College Hockey America when it began play in 1999 not the least due to the fact that the NCAA mandates a 9-year waiting period for teams playing in divisions above their level. Regardless of the trouble Barnett soldiered on behind the Findlay bench, finishing with poor but respectable results each year. While the Oilers were automatic qualifiers for the conference tournament each year (as all member teams were) he failed in each of his four attempts to win a single game, losing in the quarterfinal round each time. In the summer of 2003 the University of Findlay administration changed and consequently, after eight years in Findlay, Craig Barnett resigned as coach to take over at Lake Forest Academy. Anyone left wondering why he resigned had their answer the following January when the school announced the program would revert to club status.\nBarnett spent only one year in Lake Forest before returning to the college ranks, this time as the Athletic Director for Becker College. Two years later he returned to his old stomping grounds in Erie, Pennsylvania as the AD for Mercyhurst. in 2011 he assumed the role as commissioner of the American Lacrosse Conference, remaining with the league until it was absorbed by the Big Ten in 2014. During his time with the ALC Barnett was tabbed by the North American Hockey League as coordinator of player personnel for both the NA3HL and NAPHL eventually working up to become director of player personnel for the NAHL. Barnett also returned to coaching in 2013, accepting the job at Cathedral Prep (with whom he won a state title in 2015) and three years later became the commissioner of the entire state ice hockey league. Barnett has also served as commissioner of the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association since 2014. (as of 2016)"

They became an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1998, having previously been an affiliate member since 1987.\nIn April 2018, the ICC granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between France women and another international side after 1 July 2018 were a full WT20I.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. The France women's team made their debut at an ICC women's event when they played in the 2021 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier group.\nHistory.\nIn May 2011, \"Coupe de France Féminine\" was established as part of a continuing commitment to the women's game in France. The first ever representative France women's team, les \"Dames de France\" played against Jersey Ladies (2011, Saumur and 2013, Jersey). Creation of an Indoor Women's National Championship is the newest development, involving four teams over four tournaments in 2013.\nOlder women too play in some clubs alongside their male counterparts, but efforts are now being specifically directed to involving women of all ages in the sport as part of the high priority being given to the development of women's cricket.\nFraud allegations and squad disbandment.\nIn November 2023, France 24 reported that the Association France Cricket had allegedly overexaggerated the popularity of women's cricket to access additional funding from the ICC, including by reporting results from \"ghost matches\" which did not actually take place. It was also reported that France may have failed the eligibility criteria for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier, which required a minimum of eight domestic women's teams playing at least five hard-ball matches each year. An ICC spokesperson stated that \"France's entry into the 2023 Women's T20 World Cup Qualifiers was determined by domestic activities that took place in 2021 and 2022 and pre-Covid\", but that \"members are also obliged to confirm to us that the information they provide to us is true and accurate\". In response, the Nantes Cricket Club reportedly \"sent a request to state prosecutors and police asking for an investigation into alleged fraudulent activity by the association\".\nFollowing the publication of the allegations by France 24, seventeen members of the French women's national squad signed an open letter calling for an official investigation into France Cricket's conduct. According to national team player Alix Brodin, some of the signatories to the letter received pressure from France Cricket not to proceed with publication. On 16 November 2023, France Cricket's sporting director Saravana Durairaj informed Tara Britton that she and her teammates would be suspended for breaching the organisation's code of conduct, which banned public criticism of the organisation. The French national team was subsequently withdrawn from the inaugural T10 Women's European Cricket Championship in December 2023. Players were asked to return their uniforms and were reportedly informed by France Cricket that they could only return to national selection if they apologised for the letter.\nIn April 2024, France 24 published further allegations of misconduct, documenting that three matches in division two of the women's national league supposedly held in April 2023 did not take place. It was additionally reported that, following the disbandment of the existing women's squad, that France had sought to incorporate members of the New Caledonia women's national cricket team into its national squad in order to meet eligibility requirements for the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup qualification process.\nCurrent squad.\nThis lists all the players who were named in the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier squad. \n\"Updated on 12 Sep 2023.\"\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — France Women\n\"Last updated 12 September 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to WT20I #1661.

Through the Touring Exhibitions Group (TEG) two main displays the 'Exhibition of British Surfing History' and 'An Art History of British Surfing' toured locations in the UK between 2004 and 2011 including London, Newquay, Aberdeen, Thurso, Marton, Brighton, Havant and Tynemouth.\nThese early exhibitions included the loan of a historic wooden surfboard, belonging to Hawaiian royalty, high chief Abner Paki, that dated back to the time of Captain James Cook. This was the first time it had been exhibited outside its native Hawaii. The board was loaned by the Bishop Museum in Honolulu and was displayed at the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum in Marton near Middlesbrough in north-east England. This exhibition also featured a visit by the Hawaiian cultural ambassador Tom Pohaku Stone, who carried out a public shaping of a traditional 'olo' surfboard which he donated to the Cook museum.\nThe surfing museum still maintains a mobile display which travels to surfing spots around the country. An oral history project, The First Wave, which collected the memories of early British surfers received funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.\nRegistered Charity status was awarded in 2010, with the updated name of the Museum of British Surfing. Its permanent site in Braunton, near the North Devon coast, opened on 6 April 2012 in the former goods shed of the old Braunton Railway Station on the Ilfracombe Branch Line. Several grants were awarded to help open the museum, notably from Leader 4, the North Devon Coast Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, North Devon Council Section 106 - and from other local councils and charitable trusts to develop 'The Yard' (the building leased from Braunton Parish Council which contains the museum), and the surrounding site including the management of a local skatepark. It was awarded the Collections Trust award for 'collections on a budget' as a result of the museums commitment to working towards carbon neutral status.\nThe founder Pete Robinson, donated \"as a gift to surfing in Britain\" his collection of surfboards and surfing memorabilia to start the museum. He left the project in 2015.\nThe museum has been run since 2015 on a voluntary basis by a board of trustees, Kevin Cook, Charlie Spurr, Ian Watson and Christian Dormer. It was awarded Arts Council England accreditation in February 2019.\nThe collection includes more than 200 different designs and shapes of British surfboards. . There are also videos and photographs including the story of Devonian Agatha Christie with a surfboard in Waikiki. There is also a photograph of King Edward VIII when he was Prince of Wales, also surfing at Waikiki, illustrating the aristocratic nature of the sport in the first half of the 20th century. A recent exhibition concerned the pioneer in agricultural education John Wrightson who is reputedly the first person in Britain to surf when under the guidance of two Hawaiian princes David Kawānanakoa and Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole he took to a board at Bridlington in 1890."

        "title": "Richmond Green cricket ground",
        "text": "Richmond Green cricket ground, on The Green at Richmond, London, has been a venue for cricket matches since the 17th century. The earliest reference dates from May 1666 and some top-class matches were played there in the first half of the 18th century. A match in 1731, which culminated in a riot, is the earliest in cricket history of which team scores are known. The result of a match in July 1741 is the sport's earliest known tie.\nHistory.\nThe earliest reference to cricket on The Green is from May 1666 when Sir Robert Paston, a resident of Richmond, wrote a letter to his wife and mentioned that their son had taken part in \"a game of criquett (\"sic\") on Richmond Green\".\nThe first match that is definitely known to have been played on The Green was between Surrey and Middlesex in June 1730. Surrey won but no details have survived.\nThe following year, on 23 August, a match between Mr Chambers' XI (a Richmond team) and the Duke of Richmond's XI (a Sussex team) is the earliest in cricket history of which team scores are known. Richmond's XI totalled 79 runs in their first innings and Chambers' XI replied with 119 to take a first innings lead of 40. Richmond's XI were all out for 72 in their second innings, so Chambers' XI needed 33 to win. The game ended promptly at a pre-agreed time when Chambers' XI had \"four or five more to have come in\" and needed \"about 8 to 10 notches\". The result was, therefore, a draw and this caused a fracas among the crowd who were incensed by the prompt finish because the Duke of Richmond had arrived late and delayed the start of the game. The riot resulted in some of Richmond's players \"having their shirts tore off their backs: and 'tis said a law suit will commence about the play\". The stake was 200 guineas.\nOn 22 July 1741, a match between Surrey and London resulted in cricket's earliest known tie.\nThe first time Richmond Cricket Club are known to have played on The Green was on 4 July 1743 when a combined Richmond &amp; Kingston team was defeated by London. The noted Kent player Robert Colchin guested for London and the match is his earliest recorded mention. Later matches on The Green involved the Richmond club against other parish teams – for example, Chertsey in 1761, 1765 and 1771; Kingston in 1767; and Montpelier in 1799 and 1800.\nPresent day.\nThe Green is presently home to two village cricket teams each affiliated to two of Richmond's pubs, \"The Prince's Head\" and \"The Cricketers\". Midweek matches are contested in the modern limited overs format of Twenty20 usually on a Tuesday or Thursdays, where surrounding village teams compete for the Len Smith Charity Shield."

The event was won by the team from New Zealand.\nBackground.\nBeginning in 1966, East Germany was for many years the dominating nation in the men's coxless four event at European, World, and Olympic level. Their last gold came with the 1980 Summer Olympics. At the three subsequent World Championships, the Soviet Union had the best success (with one gold and two silvers), followed by Switzerland (one gold and one silver) and West Germany (one gold).

        "text": "The men's coxed four (M4+) competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place at Lake Casitas in Ventura County, California, United States. There were 8 boats (40 competitors) from 8 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. It was held from 30 July to 5 August and the dominant nations were missing from the event due to the Eastern Bloc boycott. Great Britain dominated the regatta, winning the nation's first rowing gold since the 1948 Summer Olympics, back then in front of their home crowd at the Henley Royal Regatta course. The 1984 event started Steve Redgrave's Olympic rowing success that would eventually see him win five Olympic gold medals. It was Great Britain's first victory in the men's coxed four and first medal of any colour in the event since 1912. The other medaling nations had also not been to the podium in the coxed four recently; the United States took silver, that nation's first medal in the event since 1952, while New Zealand's bronze was its first medal since 1968.\nBackground.\nThis was the 17th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nEast Germany was the dominating country for the men's coxed four competition; since the 1977 World Rowing Championships, they had won this competition every year but at the most recent world championship in 1983, New Zealand claimed the title, displacing East Germany to the silver medal. The second most dominating nation at the time was the Soviet Union, which had claimed five top three finishes since the 1976 Summer Olympics. Both these Eastern Bloc nations were part of the boycott in 1984, and that left New Zealand as the reigning world champion as the favourite for the event. The USA was also highly rated, having won world championship silver and bronze in 1981 and 1982, respectively, and gold at the Pan American Games in 1983.\nFor the second consecutive Games (and fifth time in the last eight), no nations made their debut in the event. The United States made its 14th appearance, most of any nation to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nWith a small field again, the competition continued to use the three-round format from 1980.\nResults.\nNone of the eight teams swapped the position of their rowers during the competition.\nSemifinals.\nThe two heats in round one were rowed on 30 July. The winner of each heat advanced to the A final, while the remaining teams went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nOne heat was rowed in the repechage on 2 August. The first four teams advanced to the A final, while the remaining two teams went to the B final.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe B final was rowed on 3 August.\nFinal A.\nThe A final was rowed on 5 August."
